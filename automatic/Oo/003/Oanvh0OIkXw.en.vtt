00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
here door panels all look good the only

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.540 
here door panels all look good the only
other<00:02:22.700> thing<00:02:22.790> I<00:02:23.060> can<00:02:23.239> think<00:02:23.270> of<00:02:24.280> this<00:02:25.280> door

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
other thing I can think of this door

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:29.260 
other thing I can think of this door
panel<00:02:25.970> is<00:02:26.090> missing<00:02:26.450> the<00:02:26.540> fabric<00:02:27.050> coating<00:02:28.270> so

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.270 
panel is missing the fabric coating so

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:32.530 
panel is missing the fabric coating so
that<00:02:29.480> would<00:02:29.630> have<00:02:29.750> to<00:02:29.900> be<00:02:29.930> fixed<00:02:30.890> or<00:02:31.390> live<00:02:32.390> with

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
that would have to be fixed or live with

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.830 
that would have to be fixed or live with
it<00:02:32.660> the<00:02:32.750> way<00:02:32.840> it<00:02:32.959> is<00:02:33.020> doesn't<00:02:33.830> really<00:02:33.950> I<00:02:34.840> don't

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
it the way it is doesn't really I don't

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.890 
it the way it is doesn't really I don't
think<00:02:35.959> it<00:02:36.050> really<00:02:36.080> affects<00:02:36.620> the<00:02:37.900> functioning

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
think it really affects the functioning

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:47.520

in<00:05:37.759> the<00:05:37.909> summertime<00:05:38.239> because<00:05:38.659> keeps<00:05:39.289> the<00:05:39.469> Sun

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:39.679 
in the summertime because keeps the Sun

00:05:39.679 --> 00:05:41.949 
in the summertime because keeps the Sun
out<00:05:39.739> and<00:05:40.189> the<00:05:41.149> heat<00:05:41.360> let's<00:05:41.629> look<00:05:41.749> at<00:05:41.899> the

00:05:41.949 --> 00:05:41.959 
out and the heat let's look at the

00:05:41.959 --> 00:05:42.969 
out and the heat let's look at the
engine<00:05:42.110> real<00:05:42.379> quick<00:05:42.589> and<00:05:42.709> then<00:05:42.769> I<00:05:42.919> think

00:05:42.969 --> 00:05:42.979 
engine real quick and then I think

00:05:42.979 --> 00:05:47.979 
engine real quick and then I think
that'll<00:05:43.339> be<00:05:43.369> about<00:05:43.519> it<00:05:44.349> it's<00:05:45.349> quiet<00:05:46.749> the<00:05:47.749> only

00:05:47.979 --> 00:05:47.989 
that'll be about it it's quiet the only

00:05:47.989 --> 00:05:50.379 
that'll be about it it's quiet the only
thing<00:05:48.589> you<00:05:48.709> can<00:05:48.860> hear<00:05:49.339> is<00:05:49.399> the<00:05:49.429> electrical

00:05:50.379 --> 00:05:50.389 
thing you can hear is the electrical

00:05:50.389 --> 00:05:53.319 
thing you can hear is the electrical
interference<00:05:50.959> on<00:05:51.139> this<00:05:51.489> camera<00:05:52.489> I<00:05:52.909> sometimes

00:05:53.319 --> 00:05:53.329 
interference on this camera I sometimes

00:05:53.329 --> 00:05:54.879 
interference on this camera I sometimes
get<00:05:53.659> electrical<00:05:54.139> interference<00:05:54.649> with<00:05:54.799> the

00:05:54.879 --> 00:05:54.889 
get electrical interference with the

00:05:54.889 --> 00:05:57.279 
get electrical interference with the
motor<00:05:55.179> but<00:05:56.179> I<00:05:56.269> mean<00:05:56.419> you<00:05:56.509> can<00:05:56.659> see<00:05:56.869> a<00:05:56.899> steady

00:05:57.279 --> 00:05:57.289
