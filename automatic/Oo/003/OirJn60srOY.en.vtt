00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.089
 Hello everyone and welcome to a video of 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:08.849
 guide because this time I bring gp 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:12.660
 because it is to the channel we remember that it is the 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:14.610
 series where he analyzes the pokemon he used 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.529
 in my combats the way in which 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.690
 used and good of this occasion it is 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.189
 truth that I bring tainÃ¡n trump and to all 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.279
 that has used it so much skies in a 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.560
 combat in today's combat itself 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.269
 the days a few hours in other ways the 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.230
 link will be in the description itself 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.230
 they want to go see it 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:39.200
 because he has received his skill now 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:42.760
 hide that is rock head that we know 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:44.840
 what it does is that we do not receive damage 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:47.510
 let say 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.700
 derrick oil for the attacks that you 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.290
 nails like for example testarazo that is 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:54.770
 that's why this set is going to be used 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:56.510
 quite then as I say it is a 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:59.510
 law without an analysis of z and great trick of 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:02.840
 stability and watching the different sets 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:04.400
 that I recommend that I will believe 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.650
 4 voucher 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.930
 and good if you want you can support this 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.610
 tutorial with a like and let's go to it 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.110
 let's start selling our 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.240
 father I have some statistics the truth 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.640
 that are not for washing vale is very 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:19.310
 well have some health funds that are 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:22.820
 descendant 82 of base 1 attack is 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:24.200
 quite high worth 121 we see that you 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.960
 let's see the cheerful hardness and it's going to 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:30.800
 get to 341 and when to have that firm 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:35.479
 it would reach 375 which is a one nature 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:37.910
 So it's very also very very very high 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:41.130
 what is the defense that does not stay 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:43.530
 short 119 is also an ass 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.479
 obviously this little less defensive 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.430
 but that they endure physical blows the 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.079
 truth is that it comes very well although well 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.200
 it is true that for the special part and 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:54.630
 that limps more has 59 only then by 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.750
 that's where we are going to be more hurt and 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:00.689
 finally it has the speed of 71 that 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:09.119
 let's say we are 2 very 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:11.099
 low but they are both a little 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.160
 mediocre speed for example say 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:15.870
 base is worth something more decent 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.269
 but good 31 well let's see how 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.769
 we can improve this speed and now 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:22.080
 is to improve the speed because I'm going to 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:23.730
 bring to bring here or in the first 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.160
 set that I'm going to do that I'm going to talk about is 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.720
 the chosen handkerchief is worth the 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:31.260
 that he uses in the video that is in the 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:34.230
 description is valid and in today's video 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.120
 this will boost both with the period 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:39.060
 chosen as with the chosen appointment 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.769
 I think you can use it is the same or is 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.690
 obviously that depends on the roles 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:44.069
 They also help you but it's very good 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.530
 Berlin state that is primarily a 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:48.110
 set that we will see later 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.970
 after these two but this one 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:53.090
 because this depends on whether we want to scale 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:55.580
 or bambi of us that would be earthquake 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:58.550
 of these units can not miss 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.840
 with me ice and then here I put what 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:01.700
 what I want can you put what you want 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.739
 can get angry or fang come 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:07.670
 with videogames angry a good 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:09.739
 basket movement although they do not want 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:12.350
 close in this movement the case of 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:14.690
 that there are types like type to give the 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:16.700
 team the rival but good if not 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:18.080
 use twice the tusk to 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:20.180
 Fang is also true that it has its 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:22.400
 another skill that is here but 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:25.220
 well as I say this is the 7 with the 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:28.519
 red head skill these first two 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:31.010
 sets and by the statistics or 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:34.670
 be it from the sets is very simple so that 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:36.980
 attack more speed is worth but for 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:38.450
 so saying it's basically marsans is 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.300
 here in curiosity does not have much 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:44.600
 science then we come to the third and 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:47.210
 fourth let's say sets and what I wear then 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:50.480
 this one is more storm 

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:53.270
 Well polish, I think the 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:55.250
 polish or aragon an event does not usually 

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:57.110
 have been on two levels while 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:59.530
 advance when one goes up the attack and one 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:01.520
 speed depends what we want 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:03.800
 polish the truth if it is very good 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:06.110
 and if we do it with polish 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:09.230
 I recommend using it with life expects 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:11.270
 ok and then if we use aragon faces 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:12.740
 so I recommend using it with the mesh is 

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:15.350
 same although in truth it can be used 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:17.390
 will be enough hong kong with life sphere and 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:19.520
 obviously we will not break much 

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:21.260
 then then the other two or three 

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:23.840
 attacks are simple testarazo 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:26.060
 earthquake and ice fang this one can 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:28.280
 changing by fire also depends on what 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:30.500
 that we need our team no longer 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:33.950
 it can be for little physical wolves 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:35.930
 gray with the Andalusian and such although this 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:38.510
 point the truth that to have of rv but 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:41.420
 well some up who do we know she 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:43.310
 We are suspects again on behalf of the 

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:46.070
 sets is always going to be more attack more 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:47.690
 speed and as I say it depends 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:50.289
 of what you want can join the mesh 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:53.319
 sneaks to avoid burns 

00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:55.930
 and wait so really this set me 

00:04:53.319 --> 00:04:57.399
 I like it better but try so prefer 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:59.589
 take to climb because there you see a 

00:04:57.399 --> 00:05:05.110
 little very fast digital mega volution 

00:04:59.589 --> 00:05:06.849
 the new and ss and pc buffet is texas is 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:07.719
 lies is speed for the truth that 

00:05:06.849 --> 00:05:10.149
 it never hurts 

00:05:07.719 --> 00:05:12.879
 instead to lose hereu I think that 

00:05:10.149 --> 00:05:14.860
 this is the sequel mesh and four and 

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:17.110
 three attacks I implement even life 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:19.080
 wait I think it's the most appropriate and the 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:21.639
 what are you going to break is insurance sure 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:23.589
 so good is worth in this site 

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:25.809
 really the nose and for these four or 

00:05:23.589 --> 00:05:28.930
 four sets each choose the one you want 

00:05:25.809 --> 00:05:30.719
 if you have is yours you can not leave below 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:33.639
 in the description and I'll take a look 

00:05:30.719 --> 00:05:36.099
 one if you liked it you can always 

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:38.649
 give him a like crisis and his cries but 

00:05:36.099 --> 00:05:41.050
 the 36 my twitter page that are in 

00:05:38.649 --> 00:05:42.909
 the description and that will allow here a 

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:45.599
 greeting and until next time 

00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:45.599
 goodbye
