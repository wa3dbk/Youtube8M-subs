back<00:01:46.360> you<00:01:46.600> know<00:01:46.720> I<00:01:46.900> did<00:01:47.380> a<00:01:47.409> little<00:01:47.799> more

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
back you know I did a little more

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.010 
back you know I did a little more
research<00:01:48.310> and<00:01:48.790> I<00:01:49.000> looked<00:01:49.180> at<00:01:49.330> the<00:01:49.420> statistics

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
research and I looked at the statistics

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.289 
research and I looked at the statistics
in<00:01:50.170> other<00:01:50.350> community<00:01:50.940> rankings<00:01:51.940> and<00:01:52.210> I

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:52.299 
in other community rankings and I

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:55.109 
in other community rankings and I
noticed<00:01:52.600> that<00:01:52.659> V<00:01:53.080> the<00:01:53.770> amount<00:01:54.070> of<00:01:54.220> frost<00:01:54.880> to

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:55.119 
noticed that V the amount of frost to

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:57.060 
noticed that V the amount of frost to
and<00:01:55.270> holy<00:01:55.420> decays<00:01:55.869> was<00:01:56.140> perfectly<00:01:56.530> even<00:01:56.950> I

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.070 
and holy decays was perfectly even I

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:59.490 
and holy decays was perfectly even I
don't<00:01:57.820> know<00:01:57.880> if<00:01:58.060> some<00:01:58.270> of<00:01:58.330> them<00:01:58.450> and<00:01:58.720> were

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:02.799 
actually really high rating and playing

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:03.899 
actually really high rating and playing
unholy<00:02:03.100> and<00:02:03.250> I<00:02:03.310> could<00:02:03.490> tell<00:02:03.640> that<00:02:03.790> they<00:02:03.880> were

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:03.909 
unholy and I could tell that they were

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:05.370 
unholy and I could tell that they were
actually<00:02:04.150> playing<00:02:04.540> on<00:02:04.720> holding<00:02:04.960> pushing<00:02:05.260> it

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
actually playing on holding pushing it

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:06.990 
actually playing on holding pushing it
written<00:02:05.530> in<00:02:05.650> in<00:02:06.100> unholy<00:02:06.400> because<00:02:06.760> they<00:02:06.909> had

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
written in in unholy because they had

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.119 
written in in unholy because they had
like<00:02:07.229> enchanted<00:02:08.229> mastering<00:02:08.709> stuff<00:02:08.950> like<00:02:09.099> that

like enchanted mastering stuff like that

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:12.510 
like enchanted mastering stuff like that
so<00:02:09.970> I<00:02:10.239> you<00:02:10.720> know<00:02:10.780> I<00:02:10.840> carried<00:02:11.590> on<00:02:11.709> playing<00:02:11.920> and<00:02:12.280> I

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.950 
face rolled
every<00:02:17.260> motherfucker<00:02:17.680> in<00:02:17.800> fives<00:02:18.220> and<00:02:18.960> I've

later<00:02:22.270> on<00:02:22.510> in<00:02:22.690> this<00:02:22.840> video<00:02:22.990> so<00:02:24.000> basically

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
later on in this video so basically

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.830 
later on in this video so basically
unholy<00:02:25.690> is<00:02:25.900> back<00:02:26.110> but<00:02:26.560> it<00:02:27.430> is<00:02:27.820> viable<00:02:28.090> i<00:02:28.420> think

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
unholy is back but it is viable i think

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.600 
unholy is back but it is viable i think
is<00:02:28.930> perfectly<00:02:29.350> viable<00:02:29.710> class<00:02:30.130> to<00:02:30.370> playing

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
is perfectly viable class to playing

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.360 
is perfectly viable class to playing

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
freeze and tues maybe not twos and fives

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.490 
freeze and tues maybe not twos and fives
