00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:12.260
 well already on other opportunities I would 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:16.340
 I showed how you could transform a 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:19.279
 photography to drawing and painting in one in 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:23.150
 a video from quite some time ago we are going to 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:27.140
 see another way to achieve similarity 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:30.260
 with a picture of this picture there is 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:33.019
 several ways to perform this process 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:36.290
 of reaching this result with small 

00:00:33.019 --> 00:00:40.309
 final variations so that by 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:43.250
 that I decided to show you this one this 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:46.910
 another way that I think some of 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:49.430
 you will surely be interested and 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:51.170
 will be useful the image with which 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.420
 is going to do can be anyone me 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.789
 in this case I chose this image but 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:01:00.170
 it can be an animal a flower a bird 

00:00:55.789 --> 00:01:03.250
 a landscape or if not a family photo there 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:06.700
 what to do the process 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:08.980
 just at the end surely they are going to give 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:11.950
 account if it is lent or not because there 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:15.550
 some images that lend themselves and others 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:17.590
 not for all processes in general what 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:21.490
 first we're going to do this then 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:25.600
 it's very easy we are going to press control 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:27.960
 and j we are going to double twice the 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:31.260
 copy the layer twice 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:34.770
 to this top layer we're going to come to 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:36.490
 image adjustments and let's say of 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.920
 saturate 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.960
 well once we have this with 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:44.590
 control j again let's go back to 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:48.640
 copy this image and this layer 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:50.560
 top we're going to put it in the mode of 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:56.289
 about exposing color 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:02:01.979
 before that now we go back to 

00:01:56.289 --> 00:02:06.220
 image adjustments and let's say invest 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:08.470
 well once we have inverted 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:12.549
 this image there we are going to put it 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:16.480
 then in overexpose mode 

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:18.489
 color apparently disappears this but 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.069
 do not worry because that's how the 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:23.940
 process and what we are going to do then 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:27.390
 now it's coming to filters 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:30.360
 and we are going to blur and blur 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:33.750
 Gaussians but I'm already slow 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:38.330
 to this so that you have time to 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:41.550
 follow and do not get confused with the steps 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:45.770
 It is convenient to do as I always say 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:48.710
 a copy of the video or go to use it 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:51.690
 while you're looking at is over the internet 

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:54.720
 as for the amount of blur 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:57.540
 We do not have to see here that 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:02.100
 the result is the one we like most in 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:04.800
 this case I left 98 because if I exceed 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:07.140
 a little more begins to transform almost 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:11.010
 in the photograph nothing more original like 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:13.500
 that's why I'm doing if I go more 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:16.320
 Beyond left if I will get less 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.650
 having another effect also seemed to 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:21.950
 drawing but in this case I 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:24.120
 I personally chose 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:27.360
 let's say 9 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:30.900
 well once we have the blur 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:33.680
 of ocean we give them ok and we are going to 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.959
 combine these two layers 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:39.579
 pressing the shift key 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:43.050
 we click and with the right button 

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:45.840
 we say combine layers 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:49.920
 once these two are combined 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:52.590
 layers that are saturated we're going to 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.600
 put it in the luminosity mode this 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:58.220
 is for the purpose simply that 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:04:01.260
 return to recover the color that 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:04.480
 they had apparently lost 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:09.010
 now we go to filters 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:11.379
 artistic and here I choose in this case 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:15.489
 you can try others with 

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:17.859
 others of other forms of filter 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:20.350
 artistic I in this case I'm going to do 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:22.930
 with added edges 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:26.110
 here already in edges added you 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:28.630
 have these three options that if 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:31.090
 they want to follow these numbers follow the 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:33.910
 but I would say that you do the 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:36.940
 test because not all the images 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:39.760
 have the same size or have the 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:42.729
 same effect and the same colors 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:47.860
 originals and others in this case I'm going to 

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:50.650
 give these numbers that are 2 9 and 3 this 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:53.380
 des see what is best for them 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:57.370
 then I give them simply the 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:05:00.910
 mechanism of each process but then there is 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:04.060
 an elasticity that is going to make the 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:06.220
 result is or depends on what 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:08.650
 you have in mind and what you 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:10.569
 go see on the screen because I do not 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:12.460
 I can know what image 

00:05:10.569 --> 00:05:16.270
 you will take if I give them 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:18.520
 specific numbers here and you have 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:21.219
 an image of a dimension and color 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:22.599
 is different from mine, surely they do not go 

00:05:21.219 --> 00:05:27.369
 to have the same result 

00:05:22.599 --> 00:05:28.449
 we give it ok then and once we have 

00:05:27.369 --> 00:05:31.479
 added 

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:35.259
 these edges are going to come in the image of 

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:38.110
 new and we're going to adjustments and tone and 

00:05:35.259 --> 00:05:40.659
 saturation saturation environment let's 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:44.319
 check the box color and here 

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:47.680
 we are going to give more or less a tone 

00:05:44.319 --> 00:05:53.169
 here in half more or less than in this 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:55.089
 case would be 189 can be 185 190 what 

00:05:53.169 --> 00:05:57.699
 same in saturation we leave as well as 

00:05:55.089 --> 00:06:01.119
 is and we could give it a little bit of 

00:05:57.699 --> 00:06:05.139
 luminosity that here would be 4 and with that 

00:06:01.119 --> 00:06:07.360
 it's fine now we're going to combine 

00:06:05.139 --> 00:06:10.029
 these two upper layers we return to 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:12.699
 touch the shift key or shift we do 

00:06:10.029 --> 00:06:14.490
 click here and with right button we say 

00:06:12.699 --> 00:06:17.789
 combine layers 

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:19.830
 At this point we have almost our 

00:06:17.789 --> 00:06:21.740
 process achieved the only thing that we have to 

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:25.440
 do is to this top layer now 

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:28.259
 come to fusion mode and say by 

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:32.160
 example superimpose and notice that we have 

00:06:28.259 --> 00:06:34.530
 a very nice and very bright drawing 

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:36.900
 because we could also instead of 

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:39.060
 superimpose put for example soft euro 

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:42.150
 but notice that they lose luminosity in 

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:44.880
 first place and there are also areas that 

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:47.039
 they look a lot like the original photo and 

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:50.400
 they do not seem so much a drawing that's why I 

00:06:47.039 --> 00:06:53.849
 I prefer to put it in overlay mode 

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:57.630
 once with this we press again 

00:06:53.849 --> 00:07:01.530
 shift capital we click on this 

00:06:57.630 --> 00:07:03.870
 right button layer and we say combine 

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:05.220
 layers and we already have our photo 

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:07.800
 completed 

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:11.190
 well up here in this video I would 

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:13.860
 I apologize because I was longer 

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:15.900
 than usual I was away I 

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:19.290
 I took a little vacation they would give me 

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:22.500
 missing so now I leave you this that 

00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:24.720
 I hope as god is useful to them and 

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:27.840
 it is interesting at least 

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:32.040
 entertaining many achieve effects 

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:34.680
 cute of your I hope and will be as always 

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:38.420
 until my next video has been a great 

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:38.420
 I'd like to be with you again
