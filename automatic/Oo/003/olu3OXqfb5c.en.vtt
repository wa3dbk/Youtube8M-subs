hey<00:00:01.770> guys<00:00:01.979> so<00:00:02.190> this<00:00:02.340> is<00:00:02.520> my<00:00:02.730> 360<00:00:03.570> and<00:00:04.250> currently

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
hey guys so this is my 360 and currently

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.379 
hey guys so this is my 360 and currently
I've<00:00:05.430> just<00:00:05.640> removed<00:00:06.000> the<00:00:06.620> traditional<00:00:07.620> casing

00:00:08.379 --> 00:00:08.389 
I've just removed the traditional casing

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:11.690 
I've just removed the traditional casing
because<00:00:09.389> this<00:00:09.750> motherboard<00:00:10.320> is<00:00:10.860> actually<00:00:11.460> in

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
because this motherboard is actually in

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.660 
because this motherboard is actually in
a<00:00:12.030> failed<00:00:12.570> state<00:00:14.269> it's<00:00:15.269> been<00:00:15.960> repaired

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:16.670 
a failed state it's been repaired

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:20.269 
a failed state it's been repaired
several<00:00:17.670> times<00:00:17.940> as<00:00:18.410> you<00:00:19.410> can<00:00:19.529> see<00:00:19.770> the<00:00:20.010> x

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
several times as you can see the x

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.220 
several times as you can see the x
clamps<00:00:20.699> have<00:00:20.820> been<00:00:20.880> removed<00:00:21.420> and<00:00:21.660> i've

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
clamps have been removed and i've

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.910 
clamps have been removed and i've
replaced<00:00:22.970> the<00:00:23.970> motherboard<00:00:24.630> with<00:00:25.170> the<00:00:25.410> bolts

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
replaced the motherboard with the bolts

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.259 
replaced the motherboard with the bolts
and<00:00:26.250> washers<00:00:26.480> etc<00:00:28.279> which<00:00:29.279> is<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:29.640> x<00:00:29.789> clamp<00:00:30.090> fix

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
and washers etc which is the x clamp fix

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.319 
and washers etc which is the x clamp fix
which<00:00:30.990> i'm<00:00:31.140> sure<00:00:31.170> you<00:00:31.590> all<00:00:31.859> know<00:00:32.130> now<00:00:32.340> is<00:00:32.640> not<00:00:33.120> a

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
which i'm sure you all know now is not a

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.639 
which i'm sure you all know now is not a
permanent<00:00:33.780> fix<00:00:34.640> the<00:00:35.640> system<00:00:35.880> I<00:00:36.300> probably<00:00:37.200> got

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
permanent fix the system I probably got

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.069 
permanent fix the system I probably got
another<00:00:37.829> 50<00:00:38.579> hours<00:00:38.820> of<00:00:39.090> gameplay<00:00:39.390> out<00:00:39.809> of<00:00:39.960> it

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
another 50 hours of gameplay out of it

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.440 
another 50 hours of gameplay out of it
and<00:00:40.230> it<00:00:40.980> failed<00:00:41.250> again<00:00:42.530> so<00:00:43.530> yeah<00:00:44.190> it's<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:45.000> bx

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
and it failed again so yeah it's the bx

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.639 
and it failed again so yeah it's the bx
clamp<00:00:45.690> fix<00:00:45.960> is<00:00:46.200> another<00:00:46.530> permit<00:00:46.829> effects<00:00:47.570> and

00:00:48.639 --> 00:00:48.649 
clamp fix is another permit effects and

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:53.540 
clamp fix is another permit effects and
simply<00:00:49.649> by<00:00:50.120> adding<00:00:51.120> on<00:00:51.420> these<00:00:51.660> bolts<00:00:52.550> placing

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
simply by adding on these bolts placing

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.939 
simply by adding on these bolts placing
the<00:00:53.910> exurbs<00:00:54.270> doesn't<00:00:54.960> really<00:00:55.199> offer<00:00:55.500> a

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
the exurbs doesn't really offer a

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.849 
the exurbs doesn't really offer a
permanent<00:00:56.879> solution<00:00:57.320> as<00:00:58.320> you<00:00:58.680> guys<00:00:58.800> probably

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
permanent solution as you guys probably

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.459 
permanent solution as you guys probably
know<00:00:59.250> the<00:01:00.000> issue<00:01:00.180> is<00:01:00.420> a<00:01:00.449> heating<00:01:00.840> problem<00:01:01.199> so

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
know the issue is a heating problem so

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.729 
know the issue is a heating problem so
you<00:01:01.910> know<00:01:02.910> a<00:01:03.120> bit<00:01:03.719> more<00:01:03.750> is<00:01:04.049> required<00:01:04.199> to

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
you know a bit more is required to

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.810 
you know a bit more is required to
actually<00:01:04.949> keep<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.729> Xbox<00:01:06.210> running<00:01:06.960> at

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:07.820 
actually keep the Xbox running at

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.850 
actually keep the Xbox running at
optimal<00:01:08.820> temperature<00:01:09.330> so<00:01:10.290> basically<00:01:10.619> what

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
optimal temperature so basically what

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.590 
optimal temperature so basically what
I'm<00:01:10.950> trying<00:01:11.159> to<00:01:11.220> do<00:01:11.369> is<00:01:11.400> actually<00:01:11.700> explore<00:01:12.360> a

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
I'm trying to do is actually explore a

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.820 
I'm trying to do is actually explore a
new<00:01:12.659> area<00:01:13.290> to<00:01:13.830> actually<00:01:14.159> help<00:01:15.500> see<00:01:16.500> if<00:01:16.619> there's

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
new area to actually help see if there's

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.550 
new area to actually help see if there's
a<00:01:16.920> solution<00:01:17.790> to<00:01:17.939> this<00:01:18.259> what<00:01:19.259> I've<00:01:19.409> been

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
a solution to this what I've been

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.130 
a solution to this what I've been
thinking<00:01:19.830> is<00:01:20.189> possibly<00:01:20.640> water<00:01:21.540> cooling<00:01:21.990> this

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
thinking is possibly water cooling this

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:29.289 
thinking is possibly water cooling this
system<00:01:22.530> and<00:01:23.540> hopefully<00:01:24.680> that<00:01:25.680> could<00:01:25.920> offer<00:01:26.990> a

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:29.299 
system and hopefully that could offer a

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:33.260 
system and hopefully that could offer a
better<00:01:30.299> running<00:01:30.689> temperature<00:01:31.049> and<00:01:31.740> avoid<00:01:32.270> the

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
better running temperature and avoid the

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.980 
better running temperature and avoid the
system<00:01:33.689> constantly<00:01:34.020> failing<00:01:35.420> either<00:01:36.420> this<00:01:36.869> is

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
system constantly failing either this is

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.039 
system constantly failing either this is
an<00:01:37.079> 06<00:01:37.500> board<00:01:37.829> it's<00:01:38.729> not<00:01:38.970> a<00:01:39.000> falcon<00:01:39.450> it's<00:01:39.689> a<00:01:39.810> 12

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
an 06 board it's not a falcon it's a 12

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:47.870 
an 06 board it's not a falcon it's a 12
volt<00:01:40.640> 16.5<00:01:41.640> abs<00:01:41.970> and<00:01:44.329> it's<00:01:45.500> basically<00:01:46.850> all<00:01:47.850> it

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
volt 16.5 abs and it's basically all it

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.859 
volt 16.5 abs and it's basically all it
is<00:01:48.180> and<00:01:48.450> I<00:01:49.049> replace<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:50.040> old<00:01:50.939> heat<00:01:51.210> sense<00:01:51.509> with

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
is and I replace the old heat sense with

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.770 
is and I replace the old heat sense with
the<00:01:52.310> slightly<00:01:53.310> newer<00:01:53.670> heat<00:01:53.939> sinks<00:01:54.299> here<00:01:54.450> with

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
the slightly newer heat sinks here with

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.840 
the slightly newer heat sinks here with
the<00:01:54.869> copper<00:01:55.259> piping

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
the copper piping

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.520 
the copper piping
extra<00:01:57.210> added<00:01:57.840> red<00:01:58.560> hair<00:01:58.890> for<00:01:59.130> extra<00:01:59.310> cooling

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
extra added red hair for extra cooling

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.100 
extra added red hair for extra cooling
but<00:02:01.530> basically<00:02:02.030> that<00:02:03.030> didn't<00:02:03.360> actually<00:02:03.570> help

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
but basically that didn't actually help

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.700 
but basically that didn't actually help
me<00:02:04.790> help<00:02:05.790> the<00:02:05.940> system<00:02:06.299> to<00:02:06.450> run<00:02:06.659> any<00:02:07.229> better

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
me help the system to run any better

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.010 
me help the system to run any better
really<00:02:08.160> and<00:02:09.000> subsequently<00:02:09.899> failed<00:02:10.319> again

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
really and subsequently failed again

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.050 
really and subsequently failed again

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:24.319 
bolts onto the right degree etc but I've

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:28.820 
bolts onto the right degree etc but I've
just<00:02:25.319> basically<00:02:25.800> found<00:02:26.190> that<00:02:26.520> you<00:02:26.880> know<00:02:27.680> the<00:02:28.680> x

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
just basically found that you know the x

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.809 
just basically found that you know the x
clamp<00:02:29.190> fix<00:02:29.400> is<00:02:29.670> not<00:02:30.150> a<00:02:30.390> pair<00:02:30.630> of<00:02:30.870> fix<00:02:31.640> so<00:02:32.640> that's

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
clamp fix is not a pair of fix so that's

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:34.640 
clamp fix is not a pair of fix so that's
what<00:02:32.940> I'm<00:02:33.000> here<00:02:33.150> to<00:02:33.180> do<00:02:33.420> I'm<00:02:34.080> just<00:02:34.290> telling<00:02:34.470> you

cooling<00:02:52.410> this<00:02:52.650> system<00:02:53.100> so<00:02:54.090> this<00:02:54.720> is<00:02:54.870> basically

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:55.049 
cooling this system so this is basically

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:58.190

have you know try to resolve by
upgrading<00:03:17.370> certain<00:03:17.880> components<00:03:18.590> but

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 
upgrading certain components but

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:22.190 
upgrading certain components but
unfortunately<00:03:20.670> I<00:03:20.700> don't<00:03:21.060> think<00:03:21.480> it's<00:03:21.959> been

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
unfortunately I don't think it's been

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.970 
unfortunately I don't think it's been
resolved<00:03:22.940> even<00:03:23.940> with<00:03:24.329> the<00:03:24.510> new<00:03:24.540> Falcon<00:03:25.140> system

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
resolved even with the new Falcon system

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.920 
resolved even with the new Falcon system
I'm<00:03:26.790> not<00:03:27.090> sure<00:03:27.150> the<00:03:27.540> fair<00:03:27.810> rate<00:03:28.079> on<00:03:28.260> those<00:03:28.440> but

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
I'm not sure the fair rate on those but

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.840 
I'm not sure the fair rate on those but
maybe<00:03:30.930> maybe<00:03:31.470> it<00:03:31.709> is<00:03:31.829> a<00:03:31.859> fix<00:03:32.190> but<00:03:32.430> at<00:03:32.760> the

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
maybe maybe it is a fix but at the

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:35.090 
maybe maybe it is a fix but at the
moment<00:03:32.970> I<00:03:33.239> can't<00:03:33.600> afford<00:03:33.930> to<00:03:33.989> buy<00:03:34.230> yet<00:03:34.680> another
