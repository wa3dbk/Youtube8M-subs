00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
yeah very much yeah and I think the

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.999 
yeah very much yeah and I think the
biggest<00:01:48.360> thing<00:01:48.689> and<00:01:49.049> now<00:01:49.259> don't<00:01:49.409> ask<00:01:49.619> me<00:01:49.860> what

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
biggest thing and now don't ask me what

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.850 
biggest thing and now don't ask me what
they<00:01:50.159> are<00:01:50.340> right<00:01:50.610> but<00:01:51.540> I've<00:01:51.720> I<00:01:52.049> can<00:01:52.530> really<00:01:52.740> see

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
they are right but I've I can really see

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.429 
they are right but I've I can really see
how<00:01:52.979> it<00:01:53.009> influences<00:01:53.640> ya<00:01:54.090> when<00:01:54.780> you<00:01:54.899> know<00:01:55.200> you

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
how it influences ya when you know you

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.230

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
we we didn't go to school together we

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.259 
we we didn't go to school together we
weren't<00:03:49.859> all<00:03:49.979> the<00:03:50.010> same<00:03:50.310> age<00:03:50.549> and<00:03:50.879> we<00:03:50.940> had

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
weren't all the same age and we had

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:53.539 
weren't all the same age and we had
really<00:03:51.479> different<00:03:51.930> musical<00:03:52.260> tastes<00:03:52.709> and<00:03:52.889> we

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:53.549 
really different musical tastes and we

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:54.770

recreate that absolutely so it was yeah

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.280 
recreate that absolutely so it was yeah
it<00:03:59.489> was<00:03:59.790> almost<00:04:00.030> like<00:04:00.239> you<00:04:00.269> guys<00:04:00.569> kind<00:04:00.870> of<00:04:00.959> the

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:29.880 
together when we get together it's like

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:32.810 
together when we get together it's like
nothing<00:05:30.360> know<00:05:30.900> times<00:05:31.140> past<00:05:31.440> at<00:05:31.650> all<00:05:31.770> so<00:05:32.160> we
