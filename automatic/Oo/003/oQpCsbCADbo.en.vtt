00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
the screws which are t25 so you just

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:29.509 
the screws which are t25 so you just
need<00:00:23.100> a<00:00:24.080> t25<00:00:25.080> and<00:00:25.439> screw<00:00:26.430> driver<00:00:26.640> and<00:00:28.220> 225<00:00:29.220> bit

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
need a t25 and screw driver and 225 bit

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.639 
need a t25 and screw driver and 225 bit
to<00:00:29.880> take<00:00:30.810> them<00:00:30.960> out<00:00:31.080> and<00:00:32.899> the<00:00:33.899> wheel<00:00:34.469> lock

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
to take them out and the wheel lock

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.119 
to take them out and the wheel lock
slide<00:00:34.860> actually<00:00:35.040> comes<00:00:35.370> in<00:00:35.489> two<00:00:35.670> parts<00:00:36.590> so<00:00:37.590> the

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
slide actually comes in two parts so the

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.520 
slide actually comes in two parts so the
section<00:00:38.460> I'm<00:00:38.610> removing<00:00:39.020> goes<00:00:40.020> round<00:00:40.230> from<00:00:40.469> the

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
section I'm removing goes round from the

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.670 
section I'm removing goes round from the
bottom<00:00:40.860> here<00:00:41.360> all<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.600> way<00:00:42.690> to<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:42.930> top<00:00:43.140> and

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
bottom here all the way to the top and

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.670 
bottom here all the way to the top and
actually<00:00:44.010> finishes<00:00:44.460> halfway<00:00:45.450> down<00:00:45.629> and<00:00:46.500> I'm

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
actually finishes halfway down and I'm

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.330 
actually finishes halfway down and I'm
not<00:00:46.890> actually<00:00:47.129> replacing<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:47.940> lower<00:00:48.090> part<00:00:48.480> so

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:49.340 
not actually replacing the lower part so

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:53.330 
not actually replacing the lower part so
the<00:00:50.510> screws<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.809> bottom<00:00:52.110> part<00:00:52.379> can<00:00:52.980> stay<00:00:53.219> in

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
the screws the bottom part can stay in

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.430 
the screws the bottom part can stay in
place<00:00:53.579> and<00:00:53.850> it's<00:00:54.030> just<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.360> ones<00:00:54.570> that<00:00:55.230> come

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
place and it's just the ones that come

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.889 
place and it's just the ones that come
along<00:00:55.649> here<00:00:55.949> that<00:00:56.850> I<00:00:56.879> need<00:00:57.090> to<00:00:57.180> remove<00:00:57.449> in

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
order to get the liner out which goes

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.349 
order to get the liner out which goes
round<00:01:01.109> here<00:01:01.410> I've<00:01:01.980> also<00:01:02.190> got<00:01:02.579> a<00:01:02.609> section<00:01:03.000> at

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
round here I've also got a section at

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.840 
round here I've also got a section at
the<00:01:03.480> bottom<00:01:03.600> I<00:01:03.960> need<00:01:04.140> to<00:01:04.229> replace<00:01:04.500> and<00:01:04.860> I<00:01:05.670> need

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
to find the part number for that while

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.500 
to find the part number for that while
I'm<00:01:07.290> doing<00:01:07.530> it<00:01:09.890> once<00:01:10.890> all<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.310> screws<00:01:11.610> have

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
I'm doing it once all the screws have

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.280 
I'm doing it once all the screws have
been<00:01:12.570> removed<00:01:12.720> just<00:01:13.820> take<00:01:14.820> off

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
bitching out the existing liner see how

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.090 
bitching out the existing liner see how
much<00:01:26.880> dirt<00:01:27.150> collects<00:01:27.870> underneath<00:01:28.290> it<00:01:31.010> if<00:01:32.010> you

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
much dirt collects underneath it if you

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.590 
much dirt collects underneath it if you
look<00:01:32.280> over<00:01:32.490> here<00:01:32.550> this<00:01:33.030> is<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.330> one<00:01:33.450> I've<00:01:33.570> just

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
removed you can see this corner has been

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.140 
removed you can see this corner has been
broken<00:01:36.690> off<00:01:36.960> and<00:01:37.950> this<00:01:38.340> is<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:38.610> brand-new<00:01:38.910> one

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
broken off and this is the brand-new one

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.740 
broken off and this is the brand-new one
about<00:01:39.570> to<00:01:39.750> go<00:01:39.840> in<00:01:40.430> because<00:01:41.430> they<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:41.910> new<00:01:42.540> one

design<00:01:45.120> to<00:01:46.050> the<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.950> old<00:01:47.100> ones<00:01:47.310> that<00:01:47.400> come<00:01:47.700> off

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
design to the the old ones that come off

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.400 
design to the the old ones that come off
the<00:01:47.820> car<00:01:49.009> they're<00:01:50.009> both<00:01:50.160> still<00:01:50.400> 225<00:01:51.390> and<00:01:51.660> it's

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:52.410 
the car they're both still 225 and it's

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:56.270 
the car they're both still 225 and it's
just<00:01:52.590> a<00:01:52.680> slightly<00:01:52.950> deeper<00:01:53.600> socket<00:01:54.600> which<00:01:55.280> will

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
just a slightly deeper socket which will

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.420 
just a slightly deeper socket which will
make<00:01:56.460> it<00:01:56.580> easier<00:01:56.910> to<00:01:57.090> remove<00:01:57.360> in<00:01:57.690> the<00:01:57.750> future

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.430 
make it easier to remove in the future

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.999 
make it easier to remove in the future
there<00:01:59.430> are<00:01:59.729> eight<00:02:00.330> screws<00:02:01.200> that<00:02:01.590> need<00:02:01.650> to<00:02:01.979> be

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
there are eight screws that need to be

there are eight screws that need to be
put<00:02:02.520> back<00:02:02.550> in<00:02:02.910> in<00:02:03.180> order<00:02:03.509> to<00:02:03.690> refit<00:02:04.170> it<00:02:04.380> and<00:02:05.130> see

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
put back in in order to refit it and see

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:11.380 
put back in in order to refit it and see
three<00:02:06.000> screw<00:02:06.630> holes<00:02:06.660> there<00:02:07.580> fourth<00:02:08.580> one<00:02:08.880> here

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390

at the top just here so we now have the

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.500 
at the top just here so we now have the
new<00:02:24.780> wheel<00:02:24.989> liner<00:02:25.260> fitted<00:02:25.709> and<00:02:26.400> it's<00:02:26.820> fixed<00:02:27.360> in

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
new wheel liner fitted and it's fixed in

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:34.160 
new wheel liner fitted and it's fixed in
there<00:02:27.750> there<00:02:28.340> there<00:02:31.010> and<00:02:32.010> then<00:02:32.880> three<00:02:33.239> screws

there there there and then three screws

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.539 
there there there and then three screws
along<00:02:34.380> here<00:02:35.060> it's<00:02:36.060> face<00:02:36.989> from<00:02:37.230> underneath

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:37.549 
along here it's face from underneath

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:41.479 
along here it's face from underneath
that<00:02:38.549> was<00:02:38.760> broken<00:02:39.390> as<00:02:39.510> well<00:02:39.750> and<00:02:40.250> now<00:02:41.250> I've<00:02:41.459> got

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
that was broken as well and now I've got

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:44.240 
that was broken as well and now I've got
part<00:02:41.940> number<00:02:42.299> for<00:02:43.080> that<00:02:43.110> which<00:02:43.769> I'll<00:02:43.950> be<00:02:44.100> able

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250
