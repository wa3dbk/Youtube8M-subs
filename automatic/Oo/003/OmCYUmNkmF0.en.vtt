 Well, today I bring you a video of 

00:00:06.709 --> 00:00:10.940

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:13.129
 when on the channel this time it 's 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:16.250
 of books subject many of you in 

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:18.710
 the video of gifts of kings where you 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.870
 I showed Delirium trilogy I 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.250
 I'm currently reading you told me 

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:24.260
 is that you also like to read and that 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:27.110
 what did not do then videos about 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:29.210
 reading then not good then me that I 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:30.410
 I like to read because it seemed good to me 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.509
 that are also videos that maybe 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.490
 you have to have in the channel that not always 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:35.900
 everything is going to be a make- up so 

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:38.750
 I do not like doing things a little 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:40.520
 different at times and well then in this 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.430
 occasion as well as nothing I come to you 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.170
 explain or tell you then that we 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:48.260
 I would advise to read after the 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.940
 50 shadows trilogy dedicated this 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.040
 video to all these people who has 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:55.700
 liked this trilogy among those who 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:58.960
 I included I made a post a long time ago 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:03.250
 when I finished the great trilogy 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:05.140
 Well, giving my opinion and well, I'll tell you 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.659
 I'm going to leave here because it's on the blog 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:10.240
 know what I thought it was 50 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:14.320
 envelopes of gray is that it is a trilogy 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:16.869
 very pleasant and very easy to read is not that 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:20.050
 I loved it but it has 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:22.149
 entertaining and I many times there are books 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:25.149
 that maybe they 're really good 

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:27.190
 but I do not get to entertain 

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:29.740
 to the best to commit a crime saying what 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:32.170
 what am I going to say but I want 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:35.050
 say to me for example a book like the 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:38.590
 beehive of zela because it is a book that 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:41.200
 I read and that bored me sovereignly not 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:43.720
 has in my opinion under my point 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.179
 view does not have the people why to be 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:49.960
 always reading good books of awards 

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:52.210
 nobel of classical literature or things like that 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.890
 because maybe it bores me there 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:55.990
 I like a lot of classical literature 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:58.370
 but there is another that all this seems a 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.560
 then good 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:02.210
 I know that a lot of people have criticized 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.010
 these books saying they are bad 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.680
 quality that are poorly written that such or 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:10.100
 what good then I under my point 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:13.130
 True view literature as 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:15.320
 I do not know it's like it's really you 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:18.560
 You see that the book is not good for the 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:21.680
 that is well written will not be the author 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.720
 it is true that he has very little vocabulary 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.640
 that the scenes are very repetitive in 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.730
 many times and under the point of 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:31.070
 literary sight let's say it 's possible 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.720
 that may not look like good books but 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:34.880
 from my point of view they are very 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.460
 entertaining is to say they take you to a 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.950
 fantasy and above all are therefore that 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:42.860
 thought for which women we 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.240
 love and good all these are all these 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.520
 things but well I'm not going to make a 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:49.370
 criticism of grace because for that already 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:52.250
 I leave it in the post and I tell you that yes 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:55.340
 although it had seemed a bit fanciful 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:57.680
 and a bit surreal, it's true that 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:01.219
 it reads very fast and it entertains you 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:04.549
 but I have discovered good discovered 

00:03:01.219 --> 00:03:07.310
 after reading that trilogy I wanted to 

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:08.989
 very much read one of a similar style 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.900
 and that I personally liked 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:14.420
 rather more than the shades of gray os 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:17.120
 I talk about the crossfire trilogy that are 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:21.890
 these books here 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:24.980
 this is 3 is worth the first the first 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:27.920
 them is I do not hide you anything the second 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:30.909
 of them is reflected in you and the third 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:34.400
 is tied to you good 

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:37.040
 tell you this trilogy is very very similar 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:41.090
 craig the relevant literature 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:44.120
 in question of how quickly you 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:45.980
 the scenes happen it reads very 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.840
 easily like that of greg are 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:49.549
 very easy to read books that are read 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.650
 very fast they are very entertaining that 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:53.660
 They engage much and good as it is 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:55.700
 grade jump all come come see 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:04:00.170
 what happens next is not also 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:02.359
 more than an erotic romantic story and 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:04.370
 I think it's much more comfort 

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:07.310
 then there begins to develop a 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:09.950
 story of unbridled passion into 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:11.420
 the both protagonists for me 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:13.459
 personally the protagonists are 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:16.910
 much more successful than in the trilogy of 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:18.359
 gray are protagonists that you can 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:20.669
 believe more 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:24.870
 that have a past situation 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:29.250
 stormy much more difficult to deal with 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:31.379
 how happy I think the past 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:34.139
 dark to which the 50 is related 

00:04:31.379 --> 00:04:36.860
 shadows about gray's technology is 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:36.860
 much more 

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:43.250
 ridiculous we could say much more 

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:45.800
 taken to an exaggerated extreme and without 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:47.930
 however the life of these characters of 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:50.480
 the crossfire trilogy is much more 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:52.790
 traumatic much harder very much 

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:55.820
 harder and has left in them 

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:59.800
 sequels especially in the in the boy in 

00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:02.510
 video has left very serious sequels 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:05.000
 I'm going to tell you simply that you have a 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:07.490
 psychological illness that has to 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.640
 treat and all that makes you the 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:12.650
 history is much more interesting in the 

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:14.780
 Erotic theme I have to tell you that 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:19.490
 Well, personally, it has 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:22.940
 liked is treated with a contact 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:25.440
 I do not like it, it's a bit strong 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:29.820
 but without being unpleasant 

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:34.290
 I do not know I think much more of my taste 

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:37.260
 that the subject that deals with 50 shadows 

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:39.180
 that is good because it is tensed the I do not know 

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:42.480
 what about me personally then I do not 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:44.610
 it attracts a lot to read about those topics but 

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:47.460
 in this case it is very different from me that 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:48.990
 that makes me advise you these books 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:49.740
 after gray simply because 

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:52.890
 you are going to follow 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:55.140
 let's say that reading the same literature 

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:57.360
 that you have read with great is very 

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:59.940
 similar in the pse in that sense is a 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:03.180
 love story that carries a content 

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:06.720
 high voltage engaging much the 

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:08.070
 the characters are much more credible 

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:10.800
 history develops in a way 

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:13.110
 much more interesting the characters 

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:16.350
 secondary are very important in this 

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:19.830
 very very important story and maybe 

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:21.690
 in my opinion it is a story much 

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:24.660
 more accomplished than that of grail so 

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:26.130
 less it came to me more is that way to tell you 

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:28.140
 that in my view the worst of 

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:30.060
 this story is that everyone is 

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:32.280
 handsome 

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:33.360
 I was a little better than 

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:35.150
 descriptions of all the characters 

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:38.220
 were people absolutely 

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:39.720
 impressively pretty and that loads a 

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:42.240
 little is not said makes the story 

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:44.580
 be a world of super nice people who 

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:47.460
 I do not know then it is not necessary that the 

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:48.810
 history is reflected development but 

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:50.400
 well I do not want to roll more 

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:52.590
 I want to tell you then what is this 

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:54.540
 trilogy if you liked it seriously I think 

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:56.220
 personally that you will like it if the 

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:58.080
 aie if you see it read any I already 

00:06:56.220 --> 00:07:00.480
 I will comment jce I know that many people who 

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:02.700
 says that this is a bad copy of 50 

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:05.190
 shades of gray because to me the bad copy 

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:07.560
 I liked it better and I find books 

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:09.180
 that are very entertaining and very entertaining 

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:11.610
 Well, that's what I recommend if 

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:15.060
 you like this kind of literature 

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:17.819
 so nothing else I hope that I have 

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:20.789
 liked that you have interested at least 

00:07:17.819 --> 00:07:22.620
 the advice and well then, I say goodbye 

00:07:20.789 --> 00:07:24.719
 I send you a very strong kiss 

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:28.370
 thank you for being there and see you in the 

00:07:24.719 --> 00:07:28.370
 next video chao
