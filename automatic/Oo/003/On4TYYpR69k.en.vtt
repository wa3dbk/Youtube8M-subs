00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
know you quit a match you just don't get

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.120 
know you quit a match you just don't get
the<00:03:52.600> match<00:03:52.840> bonus<00:03:53.140> but<00:03:53.590> you<00:03:53.680> still<00:03:53.890> get<00:03:53.980> your

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:54.130 
the match bonus but you still get your

ex

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
ex

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.220 
ex
the<00:03:54.870> match<00:03:55.050> so<00:03:55.640> it's<00:03:56.640> kind<00:03:57.540> of<00:03:57.600> a<00:03:57.690> toss-up<00:03:58.110> I

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
the match so it's kind of a toss-up I

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:02.990 
the match so it's kind of a toss-up I
guess<00:03:58.640> it's<00:04:00.650> when<00:04:01.650> a<00:04:01.680> game<00:04:01.950> is<00:04:01.980> based<00:04:02.430> on<00:04:02.700> rage

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
guess it's when a game is based on rage

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.210 
guess it's when a game is based on rage
quitting<00:04:03.420> it's<00:04:03.630> not<00:04:03.900> a<00:04:03.930> good<00:04:04.170> sign<00:04:04.350> oh<00:04:04.560> and<00:04:04.770> tea

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
quitting it's not a good sign oh and tea

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:10.699
