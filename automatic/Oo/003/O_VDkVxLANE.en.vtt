in<00:00:04.830> this<00:00:05.830> lesson<00:00:06.069> we're<00:00:06.520> going<00:00:06.550> to<00:00:06.670> talk<00:00:06.819> about

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:06.970 
in this lesson we're going to talk about

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:09.690 
in this lesson we're going to talk about
freezing<00:00:07.359> sublevels<00:00:08.190> this<00:00:09.190> is<00:00:09.340> something<00:00:09.610> you

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:09.700 
freezing sublevels this is something you

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.430 
freezing sublevels this is something you
can<00:00:09.879> do<00:00:10.090> whenever<00:00:10.540> you<00:00:10.750> want<00:00:10.900> to<00:00:10.960> convert<00:00:11.290> a

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:11.440 
can do whenever you want to convert a

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.200 
can do whenever you want to convert a
mesh<00:00:11.680> with<00:00:12.100> more<00:00:12.370> than<00:00:12.490> a<00:00:12.520> few<00:00:12.639> subdivision

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:13.210 
mesh with more than a few subdivision

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:16.800 
mesh with more than a few subdivision
levels<00:00:13.510> into<00:00:13.750> a<00:00:14.170> dynamesh<00:00:15.570> you<00:00:16.570> get<00:00:16.720> this

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:16.810 
levels into a dynamesh you get this

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:18.780 
levels into a dynamesh you get this
little<00:00:17.020> message<00:00:17.380> it<00:00:17.529> says<00:00:17.740> hey<00:00:17.980> we<00:00:18.550> want<00:00:18.730> to

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:18.790 
little message it says hey we want to

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:20.790 
little message it says hey we want to
freeze<00:00:19.000> your<00:00:19.029> high-resolution<00:00:19.810> detail<00:00:20.200> when

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:20.800 
freeze your high-resolution detail when

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.889 
freeze your high-resolution detail when
going<00:00:20.980> into<00:00:21.099> dynamesh<00:00:21.610> mode<00:00:21.880> is<00:00:22.090> that<00:00:22.570> okay

00:00:22.889 --> 00:00:22.899 
going into dynamesh mode is that okay

00:00:22.899 --> 00:00:25.859 
going into dynamesh mode is that okay
you<00:00:23.619> can<00:00:23.770> either<00:00:23.860> say<00:00:24.070> yes<00:00:24.099> or<00:00:24.369> no<00:00:24.700> if<00:00:25.480> you<00:00:25.660> say

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:25.869 
you can either say yes or no if you say

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:29.670 
you can either say yes or no if you say
yes<00:00:27.119> it'll<00:00:28.119> freeze<00:00:28.450> your<00:00:28.570> levels<00:00:28.899> and<00:00:29.110> you<00:00:29.529> can

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:29.680 
yes it'll freeze your levels and you can

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.120 
yes it'll freeze your levels and you can
make<00:00:29.800> alterations<00:00:30.189> to<00:00:30.489> your<00:00:30.669> mesh<00:00:30.820> if<00:00:31.920> you<00:00:32.920> do

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:33.130 
make alterations to your mesh if you do

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:37.170 
make alterations to your mesh if you do
and<00:00:33.430> you<00:00:34.090> unfreeze<00:00:34.540> those<00:00:34.780> sub<00:00:35.020> levels<00:00:36.180> it's

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:37.180 
and you unfreeze those sub levels it's

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:38.700 
and you unfreeze those sub levels it's
going<00:00:37.330> to<00:00:37.390> try<00:00:37.510> to<00:00:37.540> reproach<00:00:37.960> act<00:00:38.170> that<00:00:38.320> detail

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:38.710 
going to try to reproach act that detail

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.310 
going to try to reproach act that detail
on<00:00:38.920> to<00:00:39.520> your<00:00:39.640> new<00:00:39.730> mesh<00:00:39.990> barring<00:00:40.990> any<00:00:41.080> of<00:00:41.230> the

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:41.320 
on to your new mesh barring any of the

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.980 
on to your new mesh barring any of the
changes<00:00:41.680> you<00:00:41.830> made<00:00:41.890> and<00:00:42.480> while<00:00:43.480> this<00:00:43.600> is<00:00:43.780> kind

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:43.990 
changes you made and while this is kind

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:46.530 
changes you made and while this is kind
of<00:00:44.050> cool<00:00:44.160> keep<00:00:45.160> in<00:00:45.280> mind<00:00:45.550> that<00:00:45.730> it's<00:00:46.150> not

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:46.540 
of cool keep in mind that it's not

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:49.110 
of cool keep in mind that it's not
always<00:00:46.720> a<00:00:46.840> hundred<00:00:47.140> percent<00:00:47.200> accurate<00:00:47.800> so<00:00:48.460> say

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:49.120 
always a hundred percent accurate so say

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:50.970 
always a hundred percent accurate so say
for<00:00:49.150> instance<00:00:49.300> I<00:00:49.720> had<00:00:49.960> six<00:00:50.380> subdivision

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:50.980 
for instance I had six subdivision

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.430 
for instance I had six subdivision
levels<00:00:51.280> here<00:00:51.550> turn<00:00:52.300> it<00:00:52.390> into<00:00:52.510> a<00:00:52.630> dynamesh<00:00:53.140> by

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:53.440 
levels here turn it into a dynamesh by

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.620 
levels here turn it into a dynamesh by
freezing<00:00:53.710> the<00:00:53.860> levels<00:00:54.250> then<00:00:54.520> unfroze<00:00:55.120> them<00:00:55.360> it

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:55.630 
freezing the levels then unfroze them it

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:58.560 
freezing the levels then unfroze them it
just<00:00:56.110> recreated<00:00:56.800> the<00:00:57.250> sub<00:00:57.489> D<00:00:57.640> levels<00:00:57.970> up<00:00:58.210> to

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:58.570 
just recreated the sub D levels up to

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:00.690 
just recreated the sub D levels up to
that<00:00:58.840> actual<00:00:59.260> resolution<00:00:59.590> which<00:01:00.400> basically

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:00.700 
that actual resolution which basically

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.819 
that actual resolution which basically
means<00:01:01.000> if<00:01:01.300> I<00:01:01.480> had<00:01:01.630> six<00:01:01.989> it<00:01:02.290> could<00:01:02.500> knock<00:01:02.680> it

00:01:02.819 --> 00:01:02.829 
means if I had six it could knock it

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:04.770 
means if I had six it could knock it
down<00:01:02.980> to<00:01:03.040> three<00:01:03.220> or<00:01:03.760> even<00:01:03.820> to<00:01:04.329> subdivision

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:04.780 
down to three or even to subdivision

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.039 
down to three or even to subdivision
levels<00:01:05.259> so<00:01:06.220> what<00:01:06.369> happens<00:01:06.700> if<00:01:06.880> you<00:01:07.000> say<00:01:07.210> no<00:01:07.540> to

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:08.049 
levels so what happens if you say no to

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:09.690 
levels so what happens if you say no to
freezing<00:01:08.320> your<00:01:08.560> sub<00:01:08.770> levels<00:01:09.100> when<00:01:09.250> converting

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:09.700 
freezing your sub levels when converting

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.750 
freezing your sub levels when converting
to<00:01:09.820> a<00:01:09.850> dynamesh<00:01:10.530> well<00:01:11.530> it<00:01:12.340> just<00:01:12.400> basically

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:12.760 
to a dynamesh well it just basically

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.480 
to a dynamesh well it just basically
erases<00:01:13.360> them<00:01:13.510> and<00:01:13.690> you<00:01:14.500> get<00:01:14.620> a<00:01:14.650> dynamesh<00:01:15.100> based

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:15.490 
erases them and you get a dynamesh based

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:18.300 
erases them and you get a dynamesh based
on<00:01:15.700> your<00:01:15.790> resolution<00:01:16.440> so<00:01:17.440> as<00:01:17.740> you<00:01:17.860> can<00:01:17.950> see<00:01:18.130> we

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:18.310 
on your resolution so as you can see we

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.719 
on your resolution so as you can see we
lost<00:01:18.520> a<00:01:18.760> lot<00:01:19.030> of<00:01:19.060> detail<00:01:19.659> on<00:01:19.870> this<00:01:20.020> thing<00:01:20.729> not

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:21.729 
lost a lot of detail on this thing not

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:23.880 
lost a lot of detail on this thing not
so<00:01:21.880> much<00:01:22.030> on<00:01:22.150> the<00:01:22.270> back<00:01:22.479> but<00:01:22.870> on<00:01:23.049> the<00:01:23.530> front<00:01:23.770> we

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890 
so much on the back but on the front we

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.460 
so much on the back but on the front we
lost<00:01:24.070> quite<00:01:24.310> a<00:01:24.370> bit<00:01:24.580> in<00:01:24.850> fact<00:01:25.690> by<00:01:25.930> zoom<00:01:26.260> in<00:01:26.440> a

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:26.470 
lost quite a bit in fact by zoom in a

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:31.289 
lost quite a bit in fact by zoom in a
little<00:01:26.620> bit<00:01:28.979> control-z<00:01:29.979> turn<00:01:30.610> it<00:01:30.729> back<00:01:30.880> into<00:01:31.120> a

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:31.299 
little bit control-z turn it back into a

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:33.870 
little bit control-z turn it back into a
subdivided<00:01:32.260> mesh<00:01:32.440> you<00:01:33.190> can<00:01:33.340> see<00:01:33.460> the<00:01:33.580> detail

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
subdivided mesh you can see the detail

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.820 
subdivided mesh you can see the detail
that<00:01:34.060> was<00:01:34.150> on<00:01:34.330> it<00:01:34.510> if<00:01:34.690> you<00:01:35.409> want<00:01:35.560> to<00:01:35.619> retain

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:35.830 
that was on it if you want to retain

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:38.340 
that was on it if you want to retain
more<00:01:36.130> detail<00:01:36.520> just<00:01:37.420> raise<00:01:37.630> your<00:01:37.659> resolution

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 
more detail just raise your resolution

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.750 
more detail just raise your resolution
to<00:01:38.680> like<00:01:38.830> 256<00:01:39.580> or<00:01:39.880> maybe<00:01:40.330> 512<00:01:40.990> and<00:01:41.490> then<00:01:42.490> press

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:42.760 
to like 256 or maybe 512 and then press

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:47.730 
to like 256 or maybe 512 and then press
dynamesh<00:01:44.070> don't<00:01:45.070> keep<00:01:45.250> your<00:01:45.400> sub<00:01:45.610> levels<00:01:46.740> as

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740 
dynamesh don't keep your sub levels as

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.740 
dynamesh don't keep your sub levels as
you<00:01:47.920> can<00:01:48.040> see<00:01:48.250> we<00:01:48.580> lost<00:01:48.850> a<00:01:49.060> little<00:01:49.450> bit<00:01:49.689> of

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:49.750 
you can see we lost a little bit of

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.530 
you can see we lost a little bit of
detail<00:01:50.200> going<00:01:50.950> into<00:01:51.189> a<00:01:51.220> 512<00:01:51.850> but<00:01:52.210> not<00:01:52.360> very

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:52.540 
detail going into a 512 but not very

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.140 
detail going into a 512 but not very
much<00:01:52.720> at<00:01:52.780> all

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:55.150 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.120 

so<00:01:56.150> moral<00:01:56.930> of<00:01:56.990> the<00:01:57.140> story<00:01:57.170> is<00:01:57.590> whenever<00:01:58.040> you

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
so moral of the story is whenever you

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.480 
so moral of the story is whenever you
convert<00:01:58.550> a<00:01:58.700> mesh<00:01:59.060> into<00:01:59.540> a<00:01:59.570> dynamesh<00:02:00.250> you<00:02:01.250> lose

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
convert a mesh into a dynamesh you lose

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:06.190 
convert a mesh into a dynamesh you lose
the<00:02:01.670> original<00:02:02.200> so<00:02:03.200> always<00:02:03.380> keep<00:02:03.530> that<00:02:03.830> in<00:02:03.980> mind
