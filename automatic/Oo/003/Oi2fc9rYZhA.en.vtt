car this is a Hadean it's supposed to be

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.370 
car this is a Hadean it's supposed to be
a<00:00:12.789> little<00:00:13.090> bit<00:00:13.269> quicker<00:00:13.420> than<00:00:13.719> the<00:00:13.840> rest<00:00:14.049> more

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:14.380 
a little bit quicker than the rest more

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:17.370 
a little bit quicker than the rest more
maneuverable<00:00:15.299> and<00:00:16.299> as<00:00:16.720> you<00:00:16.869> can<00:00:17.020> see<00:00:17.140> in<00:00:17.290> the

maneuverable and as you can see in the

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:21.179 
maneuverable and as you can see in the
box<00:00:17.590> whatever<00:00:18.060> zooms<00:00:19.060> in<00:00:19.330> focus<00:00:20.290> its<00:00:20.800> Android

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:21.189 
box whatever zooms in focus its Android

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:24.330 
box whatever zooms in focus its Android
and<00:00:21.460> iOS<00:00:22.390> device<00:00:22.960> enable<00:00:23.410> so<00:00:23.590> everybody's

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:24.340 
and iOS device enable so everybody's

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:26.790 
and iOS device enable so everybody's
gonna<00:00:24.520> jump<00:00:24.730> into<00:00:24.880> the<00:00:25.029> phone<00:00:25.320> and<00:00:26.320> here<00:00:26.649> you

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:26.800 
gonna jump into the phone and here you

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.409 
gonna jump into the phone and here you
can<00:00:26.919> see<00:00:27.220> those<00:00:27.489> are<00:00:27.669> the<00:00:27.759> add-ons<00:00:28.090> so<00:00:28.360> it

00:00:28.409 --> 00:00:28.419 
can see those are the add-ons so it

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:30.450 
can see those are the add-ons so it
comes<00:00:28.599> with<00:00:28.750> the<00:00:28.869> boost<00:00:29.079> as<00:00:29.470> well<00:00:29.500> as<00:00:29.710> a<00:00:29.980> backup

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:30.460 
comes with the boost as well as a backup

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.670 
comes with the boost as well as a backup
function<00:00:31.029> so<00:00:31.390> this<00:00:32.380> one<00:00:32.590> here<00:00:32.890> should<00:00:33.100> be<00:00:33.450> no

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
function so this one here should be no

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.540 
function so this one here should be no
different<00:00:35.680> on<00:00:35.739> the<00:00:35.829> track<00:00:36.070> the<00:00:36.250> other<00:00:36.399> ones

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:36.550 
different on the track the other ones

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:37.950 
different on the track the other ones
usually<00:00:36.820> have<00:00:36.910> the<00:00:37.000> tractor<00:00:37.359> beam<00:00:37.539> and<00:00:37.839> the

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:37.960 
usually have the tractor beam and the

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.389 
usually have the tractor beam and the
pulse<00:00:38.230> cannons<00:00:38.469> I<00:00:38.649> think<00:00:38.829> they're<00:00:38.920> called<00:00:39.129> so

00:00:39.389 --> 00:00:39.399 
pulse cannons I think they're called so

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:41.220 
pulse cannons I think they're called so
this<00:00:39.550> one<00:00:39.730> here<00:00:39.879> is<00:00:39.940> gonna<00:00:40.179> react<00:00:40.899> a<00:00:41.019> little

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:41.230 
this one here is gonna react a little

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:43.650 
this one here is gonna react a little
bit<00:00:41.320> differently<00:00:41.769> and<00:00:42.239> I<00:00:43.239> think<00:00:43.390> it's<00:00:43.510> really

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:43.660 
bit differently and I think it's really

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.619 
bit differently and I think it's really
gonna<00:00:43.839> shine<00:00:44.109> in<00:00:44.350> the<00:00:44.440> battle<00:00:44.739> mode<00:00:45.510> so<00:00:46.510> I've

00:00:46.619 --> 00:00:46.629 
gonna shine in the battle mode so I've

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:47.819 
gonna shine in the battle mode so I've

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.569 
really tying it they're quick I'd say
probably<00:02:14.260> 20<00:02:14.650> minutes<00:02:14.859> max<00:02:14.980> I<00:02:15.249> think<00:02:15.459> it's

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:15.579 
probably 20 minutes max I think it's

00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:17.160 
probably 20 minutes max I think it's
charging<00:02:16.030> you<00:02:16.090> get<00:02:16.239> good<00:02:16.420> runtime<00:02:16.810> out<00:02:16.959> of<00:02:17.079> it

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
charging you get good runtime out of it

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:18.100 
charging you get good runtime out of it
say<00:02:17.319> probably

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
say probably

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.040 
say probably
almost<00:02:18.410> 30<00:02:18.590> minutes<00:02:18.770> I<00:02:19.810> guess<00:02:20.810> it's<00:02:20.960> not

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
almost 30 minutes I guess it's not

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.050 
almost 30 minutes I guess it's not
consistent<00:02:21.440> racing<00:02:22.010> so<00:02:22.280> that<00:02:22.760> might<00:02:22.910> be<00:02:23.030> a

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
consistent racing so that might be a

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.090 
consistent racing so that might be a
little<00:02:23.150> bit<00:02:23.390> skewed<00:02:23.600> but<00:02:23.960> anyways<00:02:24.410> we'll<00:02:24.920> see

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100 
little bit skewed but anyways we'll see

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:26.950 
little bit skewed but anyways we'll see
these<00:02:25.250> guys<00:02:25.460> back<00:02:25.700> on<00:02:25.730> the<00:02:26.150> track<00:02:26.390> soon<00:02:26.690> so
