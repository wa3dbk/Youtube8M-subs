on this is well we brought we brought

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.800 
on this is well we brought we brought
five<00:00:15.780> bikes<00:00:16.049> to<00:00:16.740> the<00:00:16.770> show<00:00:17.010> this<00:00:17.220> year<00:00:17.810> we

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
five bikes to the show this year we

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.140 
five bikes to the show this year we
started<00:00:19.050> out<00:00:19.320> with<00:00:19.529> our<00:00:19.980> highest<00:00:20.789> end<00:00:21.000> bike

bike comes in at about 14 pounds thanks
to<00:00:31.170> these<00:00:31.289> wonderful<00:00:31.769> role<00:00:32.070> wheels<00:00:32.309> got<00:00:32.850> on

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
to these wonderful role wheels got on

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.010 
to these wonderful role wheels got on
here<00:00:33.440> and<00:00:34.790> the<00:00:35.790> idea<00:00:36.090> behind<00:00:36.239> here<00:00:36.660> is<00:00:36.809> we've

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
here and the idea behind here is we've

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.250 
here and the idea behind here is we've
got<00:00:37.370> carbon<00:00:38.370> fiber<00:00:38.730> in<00:00:39.030> late<00:00:39.300> in<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:39.629> titanium

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
got carbon fiber in late in the titanium

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.720 
got carbon fiber in late in the titanium
which<00:00:40.440> increases<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.129> torsional<00:00:41.579> rigidity

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
which increases the torsional rigidity

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.290 
which increases the torsional rigidity
of<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.210> bike<00:00:42.480> the<00:00:43.260> stiffness<00:00:43.739> overall<00:00:44.280> and<00:00:45.149> it

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
of the bike the stiffness overall and it

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.569 
of the bike the stiffness overall and it
makes<00:00:45.450> for<00:00:45.600> a<00:00:45.660> super<00:00:45.930> lightweight<00:00:46.110> frame<00:00:46.710> we

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
makes for a super lightweight frame we

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.209 
makes for a super lightweight frame we
also<00:00:47.730> brought<00:00:47.969> a<00:00:48.030> couple<00:00:48.270> of<00:00:48.390> folding<00:00:48.750> bikes
