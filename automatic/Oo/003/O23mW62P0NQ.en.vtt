00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
completely came off the pedal so I was

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.709 
completely came off the pedal so I was
looking<00:00:38.910> for<00:00:39.180> another<00:00:39.360> solution<00:00:39.780> I'm<00:00:41.719> still

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
looking for another solution I'm still

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.299
