00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:18.880
 for lack of physical activity to carry 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:21.970
 a diet more balanced by stress 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.920
 the bad digestion that affects us 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.899
 many is more common than you 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:29.349

00:00:25.899 --> 00:00:32.020

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:39.969
 intestinal welcome doctor 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.830
 very good morning doctor welcome 

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:44.410
 so it's first of all my doc we're going to 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:46.810
 talk about the bad intestinal function of 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:48.910
 the people this is a doctor process from 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:51.550
 that we are with the desire to take us 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:54.100
 a food to the mouth already from there 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:56.500
 the whole process starts like saliva 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.000
 help in this but good is there in some 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.010
 moment there is a moment where 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.680
 we have to help you also if it is 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:05.829
 you know what happens crystal there is a 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:07.780
 bacteria that goes around swarming that 

00:01:05.829 --> 00:01:10.119
 it's called 'helicobacter pylori' a lot 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:12.100
 people do not know that they have it in their 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:14.680
 stomach we have almost all the 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.550
 we have almost everyone and what happens and then 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.470
 is 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:19.660
 it would be many times activated by 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:22.180
 different circumstances that we 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:25.300
 it produces the pain in the stomach we 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:27.250
 inflammation produces gar is a malaise 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:31.120
 so the coconut 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:34.180
 it can be an inflammatory colitis and it's 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:36.190
 because we are also feeding that 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.620
 bacteria and we are eating badly 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:40.330
 with what it is that nourishes her that 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:43.330
 us terms, look for what 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:46.570
 we are the flours the products 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:49.120
 dairy the spicy two letters while 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:51.520
 that the sugar in soybeans is also 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:53.110
 real doctors live the dinner we say there's 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.090
 a serial milestone nothing else because I'm not 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:58.750
 taking too much care and you have to know that 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:00.760
 you will eat at breakfast at noon and 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:03.520
 in the evening at noon there's almost 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:06.430
 freedom not because we are all 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.170
 working this we eat what we can 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:10.030
 as it says the moment be the night is the 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.070
 most important for the time of the 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:15.300
 night is the lightest 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:19.260
 if I knew that a carrot juice 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:22.680
 raw potato with peel as I am 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:25.680
 showing past the extractor we 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:28.320
 was going to produce alkalinity the 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:31.140
 alkalinity instead of filling 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:33.630
 of omeprazole and ranitidine and cough that 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:36.750
 people already gave it more as well as pancho by 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:39.660
 if it is is counterproductive to 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:42.360
 this is going to help you also is this 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:45.450
 little leaf is called basil basil 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:48.930
 It has a special oil that makes 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:52.200
 times that the rich man who always works 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.640
 It is a very pleasant smell and alkalizes 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.370
 it's also alkaline it 's like this 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.290
 then you can have a smoothie 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.960
 some fruit I recommend the 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.590
 apple especially cow that is 

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:06.280
 very rich 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:09.310
 This reads water and will produce a 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:11.230
 immediate sense of well-being in 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.550
 Sometimes they tell us in a prologue 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:14.290
 example that after six o'clock the 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:17.019
 late let's try to avoid certain 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:19.690
 food, they sometimes tell us 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:21.519
 that fruits good but we're 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:24.069
 talking nutritionists say about this 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:26.080
 basically for people who want 

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:28.000
 lose weight and I understand glucose 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:30.150
 true yes but here what we are 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.530
 talking is healthy eating 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.860
 for people who have bad 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:34.860
 digestion 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:39.220
 pure today you bring several elements and 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:40.540
 let's see take note and in house 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.519
 because with the doctor manrique we are going to 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:45.610
 prepare something that is a smoothie 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:49.239
 We can say how to improve our 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:53.620
 a carrot juice celery carrot celery 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:54.400
 of raw potatoes and chayote, it seems to me 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:56.379
 we are going to be talking 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:59.349
 well here we have it here we have the 

00:03:56.379 --> 00:04:01.569
 We have it already striped, just in case 

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:04.420
 it is better to pass it through the extractor 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:07.300
 but if you do not have an extractor you can 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:12.640
 liquefy there is no throw the chayote 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:15.640
 I said I already happy here 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:19.390
 carrot carrot of course 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:21.100
 let's talk and dad also performs papa 

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:23.970
 raw what he had said a while ago 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:31.900
 with the skin and face well washed 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:33.730
 now if we place it at night it 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:35.890
 you can put if you want some sugar 

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:40.720
 tequilitas very much as you can see 

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:43.150
 We made it clear that it is clear that a good 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:45.400
 I made an anise after eating this 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:50.100
 exists because it is digestive yes clear that 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:50.100
 yes but one not a bottle 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:05:01.110
 because that is also important 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:02.819
 It tastes good it tastes good and especially you 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:05.669
 gives our vibra we all know that in the 

00:05:02.819 --> 00:05:08.029
 pound so that the new thing is to play what 

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:08.029
 old 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:17.400
 with that I wanted to crystal how you walk 

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:20.630
 tudela I wanted to be very thin other 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:23.630
 thing has nothing to do with what you are 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:23.630
 people 

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:31.450
 they then suddenly noticed quick 

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:33.580
 what are the ingredients of this 

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:38.530
 liquefied water puts you of course and 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:42.010
 carrot chayote papa and that there were 

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:44.260
 now celery since lots and bread dad and 

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:45.700
 dad good health a squeeze because if 

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:48.550
 I take many and everything a lot is not 

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:51.010
 definitely counterproductive what 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:52.660
 It happens that you are going to have to run 

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:57.190
 you know that this one they call the melon 

00:05:52.660 --> 00:06:01.810
 naturist because then later you take it 

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:02.770
 nothing else then he 's very rich like that but 

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:04.600
 that this other one here I had 

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:06.130
 mentioned to his kit that we would put him 

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:08.230
 to improve the pulse suddenly a 

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:10.300
 little taste but while I think 

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:14.140
 He said that sugar is what nourishes this 

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:17.410
 bacteria that everyone fears and the best that 

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:21.010
 it is also a magnificent strong flavor is 

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:23.140
 the potato that does the potato good 

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:25.030
 it is extremely at the end all the data 

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:28.150
 because instead of being complicated the 

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:30.220
 medication we already say for free that you 

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:31.810
