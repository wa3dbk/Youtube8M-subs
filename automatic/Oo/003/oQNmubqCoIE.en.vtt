review<00:00:07.359> of<00:00:07.390> this<00:00:07.569> game<00:00:07.810> I<00:00:07.840> enjoyed<00:00:08.350> it<00:00:08.469> a<00:00:08.530> great

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:08.740 
review of this game I enjoyed it a great

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:10.440 
review of this game I enjoyed it a great
deal<00:00:09.010> but<00:00:09.340> like<00:00:09.520> many<00:00:09.700> of<00:00:09.910> you<00:00:10.030> out<00:00:10.209> there<00:00:10.240> I

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:10.450 
deal but like many of you out there I

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:12.270 
deal but like many of you out there I
often<00:00:10.870> wonder<00:00:11.230> is<00:00:11.379> the<00:00:11.530> game<00:00:11.709> really<00:00:12.010> as<00:00:12.129> bad

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:12.280 
often wonder is the game really as bad

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:14.459 
often wonder is the game really as bad
as<00:00:12.340> the<00:00:12.580> reviewer<00:00:12.910> says<00:00:13.209> it<00:00:13.360> is<00:00:13.510> so<00:00:14.020> I<00:00:14.049> decided

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:14.469 
as the reviewer says it is so I decided

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:15.869 
as the reviewer says it is so I decided
to<00:00:14.590> go<00:00:14.740> out<00:00:14.860> and<00:00:15.010> play<00:00:15.100> cliffhanger<00:00:15.730> for

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:15.879 
to go out and play cliffhanger for

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:17.939 
to go out and play cliffhanger for
myself<00:00:16.270> and<00:00:16.570> at<00:00:16.869> first<00:00:17.050> I<00:00:17.260> thought<00:00:17.410> that<00:00:17.470> KOICA

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:17.949 
myself and at first I thought that KOICA

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:20.310 
myself and at first I thought that KOICA
suni<00:00:18.220> was<00:00:18.369> absolutely<00:00:19.119> right<00:00:19.420> the<00:00:19.840> game<00:00:20.080> was

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:20.320 
suni was absolutely right the game was

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.410 
suni was absolutely right the game was
horrible<00:00:20.830> now<00:00:21.250> normally<00:00:21.730> if<00:00:21.820> I<00:00:21.910> play<00:00:22.150> a<00:00:22.180> level

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:22.420 
horrible now normally if I play a level

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:24.210 
horrible now normally if I play a level
or<00:00:22.630> two<00:00:22.690> of<00:00:22.930> a<00:00:23.050> game<00:00:23.290> and<00:00:23.500> I<00:00:23.530> don't<00:00:23.590> like<00:00:23.920> it<00:00:24.130> I

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:24.220 
or two of a game and I don't like it I

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.400 
or two of a game and I don't like it I
quit<00:00:24.580> right<00:00:24.820> there<00:00:25.120> but<00:00:25.510> for<00:00:25.690> some<00:00:25.870> reason<00:00:26.320> I

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:26.410 
quit right there but for some reason I

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:28.020 
quit right there but for some reason I
decided<00:00:26.800> maybe<00:00:27.130> I<00:00:27.280> should<00:00:27.460> play<00:00:27.550> a<00:00:27.640> little<00:00:27.820> bit

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:28.030 
decided maybe I should play a little bit

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:29.490 
decided maybe I should play a little bit
more<00:00:28.210> maybe<00:00:28.450> it's<00:00:28.660> not<00:00:28.810> that<00:00:28.869> bad

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:29.500 
more maybe it's not that bad

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.439 
more maybe it's not that bad
so<00:00:29.800> I<00:00:29.830> played<00:00:30.100> another<00:00:30.250> level<00:00:30.670> and<00:00:30.970> another

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:31.449 
so I played another level and another

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:33.389 
so I played another level and another
and<00:00:31.720> another<00:00:31.900> and<00:00:32.349> before<00:00:32.680> I<00:00:32.890> knew<00:00:33.129> it<00:00:33.160> the

00:00:33.389 --> 00:00:33.399 
and another and before I knew it the

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:34.619 
and another and before I knew it the
game<00:00:33.579> was<00:00:33.730> actually<00:00:33.879> starting<00:00:34.329> that<00:00:34.420> brought

00:00:34.619 --> 00:00:34.629 
game was actually starting that brought

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:36.420 
game was actually starting that brought
me<00:00:34.840> don't<00:00:35.320> get<00:00:35.469> me<00:00:35.590> wrong<00:00:35.620> though<00:00:36.010> I<00:00:36.190> don't

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:36.430 
me don't get me wrong though I don't

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:37.590 
me don't get me wrong though I don't
think<00:00:36.550> this<00:00:36.640> game<00:00:36.819> is<00:00:36.969> some<00:00:37.149> kind<00:00:37.329> of<00:00:37.359> hidden

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:37.600 
think this game is some kind of hidden

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.029 
think this game is some kind of hidden
masterpiece<00:00:38.199> that<00:00:38.379> you<00:00:38.499> should<00:00:38.649> seek<00:00:38.890> out

00:00:39.029 --> 00:00:39.039 
masterpiece that you should seek out

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:40.860 
masterpiece that you should seek out
right<00:00:39.280> away<00:00:39.550> but<00:00:40.120> I<00:00:40.179> do<00:00:40.300> think<00:00:40.569> it's<00:00:40.749> a<00:00:40.839> little

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:40.870 
right away but I do think it's a little

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:42.450 
right away but I do think it's a little
better<00:00:41.170> than<00:00:41.319> quite<00:00:41.710> good<00:00:41.859> SUNY<00:00:42.190> and<00:00:42.280> other

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:42.460 
better than quite good SUNY and other

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:43.889 
better than quite good SUNY and other
reviewers<00:00:42.879> on<00:00:43.089> YouTube<00:00:43.420> have<00:00:43.539> given<00:00:43.809> it

00:00:43.889 --> 00:00:43.899 
reviewers on YouTube have given it

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:45.569 
reviewers on YouTube have given it
credit<00:00:44.019> for<00:00:44.229> or<00:00:44.649> maybe<00:00:44.859> I've<00:00:45.100> just<00:00:45.219> lost<00:00:45.460> my

00:00:45.569 --> 00:00:45.579 
credit for or maybe I've just lost my

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:47.069 
credit for or maybe I've just lost my
fucking<00:00:46.030> mind<00:00:46.179> because<00:00:46.510> of<00:00:46.629> all<00:00:46.719> the<00:00:46.839> shitty

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.599 

first<00:00:56.260> off<00:00:56.499> let's<00:00:56.739> look<00:00:56.889> at<00:00:57.010> the<00:00:57.100> graphics

00:00:57.599 --> 00:00:57.609 
first off let's look at the graphics

00:00:57.609 --> 00:00:59.579 
first off let's look at the graphics
they're<00:00:58.059> fucking<00:00:58.420> horrible<00:00:58.839> in<00:00:59.229> fact<00:00:59.469> these

00:00:59.579 --> 00:00:59.589

are<00:00:59.649> some<00:00:59.889> of<00:01:00.010> the<00:01:00.069> worst<00:01:00.249> fucking<00:01:00.519> graphics

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:01.120 
are some of the worst fucking graphics

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.270 
are some of the worst fucking graphics
I've<00:01:01.239> ever<00:01:01.389> seen<00:01:01.659> in<00:01:01.780> a<00:01:01.870> video<00:01:01.989> game<00:01:02.199> did<00:01:03.039> Sony

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:03.280 
I've ever seen in a video game did Sony

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:04.619 
I've ever seen in a video game did Sony
image<00:01:03.609> soft<00:01:03.850> really<00:01:04.059> think<00:01:04.390> that<00:01:04.479> they<00:01:04.570> could

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:04.629 
image soft really think that they could

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:06.360 
image soft really think that they could
release<00:01:04.989> a<00:01:05.019> game<00:01:05.350> with<00:01:05.470> graphics<00:01:05.920> this<00:01:06.040> shitty

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:06.370 
release a game with graphics this shitty

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:08.730 
release a game with graphics this shitty
I<00:01:06.610> genuinely<00:01:07.120> hope<00:01:07.659> that<00:01:07.870> Sony<00:01:08.140> image<00:01:08.500> soft

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:08.740 
I genuinely hope that Sony image soft

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.319 
I genuinely hope that Sony image soft
rushed<00:01:09.039> this<00:01:09.219> game<00:01:09.399> into<00:01:09.610> production<00:01:10.119> and<00:01:10.270> the

00:01:10.319 --> 00:01:10.329 
rushed this game into production and the

00:01:10.329 --> 00:01:11.760 
rushed this game into production and the
game<00:01:10.509> designers<00:01:10.960> didn't<00:01:11.200> have<00:01:11.320> time<00:01:11.500> to<00:01:11.560> make

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770 
game designers didn't have time to make

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:13.230 
game designers didn't have time to make
the<00:01:11.920> graphics<00:01:12.159> look<00:01:12.430> a<00:01:12.549> hell<00:01:12.700> of<00:01:12.729> a<00:01:12.880> lot<00:01:13.030> better

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.240 
the graphics look a hell of a lot better

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:14.940 
the graphics look a hell of a lot better
because<00:01:13.630> if<00:01:13.960> this<00:01:14.170> was<00:01:14.380> the<00:01:14.409> best<00:01:14.649> they<00:01:14.890> could

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:14.950 
because if this was the best they could

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:16.410 
because if this was the best they could
do<00:01:15.219> when<00:01:15.369> they<00:01:15.460> had<00:01:15.640> a<00:01:15.670> lot<00:01:15.880> of<00:01:15.909> time<00:01:16.180> to<00:01:16.329> make

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:16.420 
do when they had a lot of time to make

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.270 
do when they had a lot of time to make
this<00:01:16.479> game<00:01:16.869> then<00:01:17.259> that's<00:01:17.469> just<00:01:17.710> pathetic

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280 
this game then that's just pathetic

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.459 
this game then that's just pathetic
now<00:01:18.909> you<00:01:18.969> might<00:01:19.180> reasonably<00:01:19.659> ask<00:01:19.930> how<00:01:20.200> can<00:01:20.259> I

00:01:20.459 --> 00:01:20.469 
now you might reasonably ask how can I

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:22.170 
now you might reasonably ask how can I
defend<00:01:20.649> a<00:01:20.920> game<00:01:21.100> if<00:01:21.219> I<00:01:21.310> start<00:01:21.609> out<00:01:21.700> by<00:01:21.880> attack

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:22.180 
defend a game if I start out by attack

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:23.639 
defend a game if I start out by attack
against<00:01:22.420> graphics<00:01:22.869> well<00:01:23.350> look<00:01:23.469> at<00:01:23.560> the

00:01:23.639 --> 00:01:23.649 
against graphics well look at the

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:25.590 
against graphics well look at the
fucking<00:01:23.979> graphics<00:01:24.460> they're<00:01:24.759> horrible<00:01:25.240> how

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 
fucking graphics they're horrible how

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.060 
fucking graphics they're horrible how
the<00:01:25.659> fuck<00:01:25.930> could<00:01:26.020> I<00:01:26.109> possibly<00:01:26.530> defend<00:01:26.920> this

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:27.070 
the fuck could I possibly defend this

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:28.830 
the fuck could I possibly defend this
shit<00:01:27.340> but<00:01:27.759> on<00:01:27.880> the<00:01:28.000> other<00:01:28.090> hand<00:01:28.210> graphics

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840 
shit but on the other hand graphics

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.959 
shit but on the other hand graphics
alone<00:01:29.140> don't<00:01:29.350> make<00:01:29.469> or<00:01:29.770> break<00:01:29.890> a<00:01:30.009> game<00:01:30.310> if<00:01:30.729> that

00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:30.969 
alone don't make or break a game if that

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:32.459 
alone don't make or break a game if that
were<00:01:31.060> the<00:01:31.090> case<00:01:31.240> then<00:01:31.450> a<00:01:31.719> piece<00:01:31.899> of<00:01:32.079> shit<00:01:32.289> like

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:32.469 
were the case then a piece of shit like

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:33.840 
were the case then a piece of shit like
deadly<00:01:32.799> towers<00:01:33.159> would<00:01:33.250> be<00:01:33.369> considered<00:01:33.759> a

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:33.850 
deadly towers would be considered a

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:35.639 
deadly towers would be considered a
classic<00:01:34.149> while<00:01:34.509> a<00:01:34.539> classic<00:01:35.020> like<00:01:35.170> Tetris<00:01:35.380> will

00:01:35.639 --> 00:01:35.649 
classic while a classic like Tetris will

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:37.709 
classic while a classic like Tetris will
be<00:01:35.740> considered<00:01:36.100> a<00:01:36.189> piece<00:01:36.340> of<00:01:36.520> shit<00:01:36.759> so<00:01:37.509> if<00:01:37.630> you

00:01:37.709 --> 00:01:37.719 
be considered a piece of shit so if you

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:39.330 
be considered a piece of shit so if you
can<00:01:37.840> ignore<00:01:38.079> the<00:01:38.229> shitty<00:01:38.469> graphics<00:01:38.710> and<00:01:39.189> just

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
can ignore the shitty graphics and just

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.069 
can ignore the shitty graphics and just
focus<00:01:39.670> on<00:01:39.789> the<00:01:39.880> gameplay<00:01:40.329> itself<00:01:40.659> then<00:01:40.960> you'll

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:41.079 
focus on the gameplay itself then you'll

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:43.169 
focus on the gameplay itself then you'll
find<00:01:41.320> something<00:01:41.530> that<00:01:41.679> isn't<00:01:41.950> that<00:01:42.280> great<00:01:42.640> but

00:01:43.169 --> 00:01:43.179 
find something that isn't that great but

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:44.669 
find something that isn't that great but
it's<00:01:43.299> actually<00:01:43.630> fairly<00:01:43.899> playable<00:01:44.380> once<00:01:44.560> you

00:01:44.669 --> 00:01:44.679 
it's actually fairly playable once you

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:46.260 
it's actually fairly playable once you
get<00:01:44.799> into<00:01:44.920> it<00:01:45.130> now<00:01:45.280> I'm<00:01:45.549> not<00:01:45.579> gonna<00:01:45.789> lie<00:01:46.060> to<00:01:46.119> you

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.270 
get into it now I'm not gonna lie to you

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.480 
get into it now I'm not gonna lie to you
this<00:01:46.630> game<00:01:46.929> is<00:01:47.170> not<00:01:47.320> great<00:01:47.679> it's<00:01:48.130> not<00:01:48.280> even

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.490 
this game is not great it's not even

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.349 
this game is not great it's not even
very<00:01:48.670> good<00:01:48.820> but<00:01:49.600> what<00:01:49.749> it<00:01:49.869> is<00:01:49.899> is<00:01:50.320> decent<00:01:51.359> the

00:01:52.349 --> 00:01:52.359 
very good but what it is is decent the

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:54.029 
very good but what it is is decent the
game<00:01:52.570> is<00:01:52.719> your<00:01:52.869> basic<00:01:53.200> side<00:01:53.380> scroller<00:01:53.710> you<00:01:53.920> go

through each level performing

death-defying jumps and beating up a
variety<00:01:57.219> of<00:01:57.249> enemies<00:01:57.490> starting<00:01:58.119> out<00:01:58.210> with

variety of enemies starting out with

variety of enemies starting out with
animals<00:01:58.659> but<00:01:59.079> then<00:01:59.229> working<00:01:59.439> your<00:01:59.590> way<00:01:59.679> up<00:01:59.829> to

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
animals but then working your way up to

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:01.889 
animals but then working your way up to
terrorists<00:02:00.399> as<00:02:00.549> you<00:02:00.640> go<00:02:00.789> along<00:02:00.909> one<00:02:01.630> thing<00:02:01.810> I

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:01.899 
terrorists as you go along one thing I

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:03.149 
terrorists as you go along one thing I
like<00:02:02.079> about<00:02:02.109> this<00:02:02.469> game<00:02:02.679> is<00:02:02.799> that<00:02:02.829> though<00:02:03.039> the

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:03.159 
like about this game is that though the

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:04.859 
like about this game is that though the
jumps<00:02:03.490> are<00:02:03.549> difficult<00:02:04.030> at<00:02:04.119> first<00:02:04.149> once<00:02:04.780> you

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:04.869 
jumps are difficult at first once you

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:06.029 
jumps are difficult at first once you
figure<00:02:05.079> out<00:02:05.140> the<00:02:05.289> controls<00:02:05.560> they're<00:02:05.859> really

00:02:06.029 --> 00:02:06.039 
figure out the controls they're really

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:08.040 
figure out the controls they're really
not<00:02:06.159> that<00:02:06.219> bad<00:02:06.640> despite<00:02:07.450> what<00:02:07.630> coin<00:02:07.840> could

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 
not that bad despite what coin could

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:09.270 
not that bad despite what coin could
soon<00:02:08.229> I<00:02:08.350> said<00:02:08.530> I<00:02:08.560> really<00:02:08.830> don't<00:02:09.009> think<00:02:09.039> that

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
soon I said I really don't think that

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.620 
soon I said I really don't think that
jumping<00:02:09.460> this<00:02:09.729> game<00:02:09.940> is<00:02:10.090> that<00:02:10.119> horrible

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
jumping this game is that horrible

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.600 
jumping this game is that horrible
especially<00:02:11.260> when<00:02:11.770> you<00:02:11.860> compare<00:02:12.069> it<00:02:12.310> to<00:02:12.340> games

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
especially when you compare it to games

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.720 
especially when you compare it to games
like<00:02:12.730> darkman<00:02:13.510> the<00:02:14.200> Terminator<00:02:14.710> and<00:02:14.950> predator

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
like darkman the Terminator and predator

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.860 
like darkman the Terminator and predator
the<00:02:16.630> running<00:02:16.900> jumps<00:02:17.230> can<00:02:17.350> be<00:02:17.440> off

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
the running jumps can be off

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.059 
the running jumps can be off
because<00:02:18.140> first<00:02:18.379> you<00:02:18.470> have<00:02:18.560> to<00:02:18.680> collect<00:02:18.830> the

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:19.069 
because first you have to collect the

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:21.100 
because first you have to collect the
boots<00:02:19.280> to<00:02:19.459> be<00:02:19.580> able<00:02:19.670> to<00:02:19.790> run<00:02:20.000> it<00:02:20.150> all<00:02:20.299> also<00:02:21.049> to

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
boots to be able to run it all also to

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:22.630 
boots to be able to run it all also to
make<00:02:21.319> your<00:02:21.500> character<00:02:21.890> run<00:02:22.069> you<00:02:22.190> can't<00:02:22.430> just

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
make your character run you can't just

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.430 
make your character run you can't just
push<00:02:22.819> right<00:02:23.060> or<00:02:23.209> left<00:02:23.450> instead<00:02:24.140> you<00:02:24.230> have<00:02:24.349> to

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
push right or left instead you have to

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.110 
push right or left instead you have to
push<00:02:24.650> up<00:02:24.860> and<00:02:25.069> laughter<00:02:25.400> up<00:02:25.580> and<00:02:25.790> right<00:02:25.940> until

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
push up and laughter up and right until

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.880 
push up and laughter up and right until
he<00:02:26.180> gains<00:02:26.450> enough<00:02:26.720> momentum<00:02:26.840> to<00:02:27.170> do<00:02:27.349> it<00:02:27.500> at

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
he gains enough momentum to do it at

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:28.990 
he gains enough momentum to do it at
first<00:02:27.950> you<00:02:28.280> might<00:02:28.430> have<00:02:28.519> some<00:02:28.670> trouble<00:02:28.970> with

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
first you might have some trouble with

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.369 
first you might have some trouble with
the<00:02:29.150> controls<00:02:29.540> because<00:02:29.750> it<00:02:30.019> does<00:02:30.170> take<00:02:30.349> a

00:02:30.369 --> 00:02:30.379 
the controls because it does take a

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:31.720 
the controls because it does take a
little<00:02:30.590> while<00:02:30.769> to<00:02:30.799> get<00:02:31.069> used<00:02:31.280> to<00:02:31.400> them<00:02:31.519> and<00:02:31.670> you

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
little while to get used to them and you

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.009 
little while to get used to them and you
will<00:02:31.819> probably<00:02:31.970> fuck<00:02:32.269> up<00:02:32.420> the<00:02:32.540> jump<00:02:32.780> a<00:02:32.900> couple

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:33.019 
will probably fuck up the jump a couple

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:34.960 
will probably fuck up the jump a couple
times<00:02:33.409> but<00:02:33.950> stick<00:02:34.190> with<00:02:34.400> it<00:02:34.549> because<00:02:34.579> it's

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
times but stick with it because it's

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:36.309 
times but stick with it because it's
really<00:02:35.090> not<00:02:35.329> that<00:02:35.390> hard<00:02:35.750> and<00:02:35.930> once<00:02:36.079> you<00:02:36.200> get

00:02:36.309 --> 00:02:36.319 
really not that hard and once you get

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:37.869 
really not that hard and once you get
used<00:02:36.560> to<00:02:36.650> it<00:02:36.709> you'll<00:02:36.950> be<00:02:37.040> doing<00:02:37.310> it<00:02:37.400> like<00:02:37.549> a<00:02:37.579> pro

00:02:37.869 --> 00:02:37.879 
used to it you'll be doing it like a pro

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:40.180 
used to it you'll be doing it like a pro
also<00:02:38.450> this<00:02:38.870> rope<00:02:39.110> climbing<00:02:39.440> part<00:02:39.769> is<00:02:39.890> really

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
also this rope climbing part is really

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:41.979 
also this rope climbing part is really
weird<00:02:40.430> to<00:02:40.970> get<00:02:41.120> onto<00:02:41.390> the<00:02:41.480> rope<00:02:41.659> you<00:02:41.810> don't

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:41.989 
weird to get onto the rope you don't

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:43.149 
weird to get onto the rope you don't
just<00:02:42.140> jump<00:02:42.230> up<00:02:42.530> and<00:02:42.680> grab<00:02:42.950> it

00:02:43.149 --> 00:02:43.159 
just jump up and grab it

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:45.100 
just jump up and grab it
instead<00:02:43.640> you<00:02:43.730> have<00:02:43.849> to<00:02:43.879> jump<00:02:44.269> and<00:02:44.450> press<00:02:44.599> up<00:02:44.870> at

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
instead you have to jump and press up at

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:46.869 
instead you have to jump and press up at
the<00:02:45.230> same<00:02:45.440> time<00:02:45.470> and<00:02:46.040> if<00:02:46.310> you<00:02:46.400> don't<00:02:46.579> do<00:02:46.730> it

00:02:46.869 --> 00:02:46.879 
the same time and if you don't do it

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:48.759 
the same time and if you don't do it
just<00:02:46.909> right<00:02:47.180> you'll<00:02:47.569> miss<00:02:47.840> who<00:02:48.349> knows<00:02:48.530> what

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:48.769 
just right you'll miss who knows what

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:50.530 
just right you'll miss who knows what
the<00:02:48.920> logic<00:02:49.250> behind<00:02:49.400> this<00:02:49.730> part<00:02:49.970> was<00:02:50.150> or<00:02:50.390> maybe

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
the logic behind this part was or maybe

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.300 
the logic behind this part was or maybe
there<00:02:50.720> was<00:02:50.840> none<00:02:51.049> at<00:02:51.200> all<00:02:51.319> in<00:02:51.530> any<00:02:51.859> case<00:02:52.160> you

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
there was none at all in any case you

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:53.530 
there was none at all in any case you
only<00:02:52.370> have<00:02:52.549> to<00:02:52.640> do<00:02:52.790> this<00:02:52.910> about<00:02:53.180> two<00:02:53.359> or<00:02:53.510> three

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
only have to do this about two or three

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.000 
only have to do this about two or three
times<00:02:53.870> in<00:02:54.109> the<00:02:54.200> game<00:02:54.379> so<00:02:54.560> it's<00:02:54.680> really<00:02:54.799> not

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
times in the game so it's really not

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:56.910 
times in the game so it's really not
that<00:02:55.160> big<00:02:55.340> of<00:02:55.519> a<00:02:55.579> deal

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
that big of a deal

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.380 
that big of a deal
one<00:02:57.920> other<00:02:58.040> odd<00:02:58.310> part<00:02:58.640> is<00:02:58.760> that<00:02:58.910> the<00:02:59.060> Select

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
one other odd part is that the Select

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.000 
one other odd part is that the Select
weapon<00:02:59.810> do<00:02:59.900> you<00:02:59.959> have<00:03:00.109> to<00:03:00.200> press<00:03:00.410> down<00:03:00.440> in<00:03:00.829> a

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
weapon do you have to press down in a

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.039 
weapon do you have to press down in a
only<00:03:01.489> a<00:03:01.670> is<00:03:01.849> the<00:03:02.090> jump<00:03:02.390> button<00:03:02.659> so<00:03:02.810> it<00:03:02.870> really

00:03:03.039 --> 00:03:03.049 
only a is the jump button so it really

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:05.440 
only a is the jump button so it really
doesn't<00:03:03.379> make<00:03:03.470> any<00:03:03.650> sense<00:03:04.000> why<00:03:05.000> not<00:03:05.150> use<00:03:05.299> the

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
doesn't make any sense why not use the

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:06.729 
doesn't make any sense why not use the
select<00:03:05.810> button<00:03:05.989> it<00:03:06.200> doesn't<00:03:06.440> even<00:03:06.500> do

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:06.739 
select button it doesn't even do

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:08.050 
select button it doesn't even do
anything<00:03:06.950> in<00:03:07.159> the<00:03:07.250> game<00:03:07.459> where<00:03:07.970> the

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
anything in the game where the

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:09.550 
anything in the game where the
programmers<00:03:08.569> smoking<00:03:09.019> crack<00:03:09.260> when<00:03:09.470> they

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
programmers smoking crack when they

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.619 
programmers smoking crack when they
coated<00:03:09.890> this<00:03:10.010> damn<00:03:10.250> thing<00:03:10.549> despite<00:03:11.329> my

00:03:11.619 --> 00:03:11.629 
coated this damn thing despite my

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:13.000 
coated this damn thing despite my
complaints<00:03:12.170> there<00:03:12.319> are<00:03:12.409> some<00:03:12.620> parts<00:03:12.859> of<00:03:12.950> this

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
complaints there are some parts of this

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:14.890 
complaints there are some parts of this
game<00:03:13.099> that<00:03:13.400> I<00:03:13.489> really<00:03:13.519> like<00:03:13.909> for<00:03:14.420> example<00:03:14.510> this

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
game that I really like for example this

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.080 
game that I really like for example this
climbing<00:03:15.349> stage<00:03:15.590> now<00:03:16.280> I<00:03:16.310> know<00:03:16.430> that<00:03:16.670> koi<00:03:16.879> could

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
climbing stage now I know that koi could

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:18.309 
climbing stage now I know that koi could
soon<00:03:17.269> have<00:03:17.390> said<00:03:17.569> that<00:03:17.690> the<00:03:17.810> rocks<00:03:18.049> in<00:03:18.230> the

00:03:18.309 --> 00:03:18.319 
soon have said that the rocks in the

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:20.140 
soon have said that the rocks in the
stage<00:03:18.560> are<00:03:18.739> very<00:03:18.950> annoying<00:03:19.220> and<00:03:19.819> at<00:03:19.940> first

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
stage are very annoying and at first

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:21.550 
stage are very annoying and at first
they<00:03:20.329> are<00:03:20.359> because<00:03:20.780> they<00:03:20.900> fall<00:03:21.109> in<00:03:21.230> random

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
they are because they fall in random

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.530 
they are because they fall in random
patterns<00:03:21.950> that<00:03:22.069> you<00:03:22.190> can't<00:03:22.430> predict<00:03:22.819> but

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540 
patterns that you can't predict but

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:24.879 
patterns that you can't predict but
honestly<00:03:23.900> this<00:03:24.139> stage<00:03:24.349> is<00:03:24.530> not<00:03:24.560> that

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:24.889 
honestly this stage is not that

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:26.500 
honestly this stage is not that
difficult<00:03:25.130> even<00:03:25.669> if<00:03:25.880> you<00:03:25.970> get<00:03:26.120> hit<00:03:26.359> with<00:03:26.389> a

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
difficult even if you get hit with a

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:28.210 
difficult even if you get hit with a
rock<00:03:26.750> a<00:03:26.810> couple<00:03:27.290> of<00:03:27.410> times<00:03:27.620> you<00:03:27.829> won't<00:03:27.950> die<00:03:28.190> so

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
rock a couple of times you won't die so

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.580 
rock a couple of times you won't die so
long<00:03:28.669> as<00:03:28.790> you<00:03:28.849> don't<00:03:28.970> fall<00:03:29.239> too<00:03:29.480> far<00:03:29.510> at<00:03:30.380> least

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
long as you don't fall too far at least

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.140 
long as you don't fall too far at least
the<00:03:30.739> game<00:03:30.919> has<00:03:31.130> the<00:03:31.250> common<00:03:31.579> decency<00:03:31.730> to<00:03:32.120> give

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
the game has the common decency to give

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.000 
the game has the common decency to give
you<00:03:32.389> a<00:03:32.419> life<00:03:32.690> bar<00:03:32.930> plus<00:03:33.620> I<00:03:33.769> think<00:03:33.829> the

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010 
you a life bar plus I think the

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:35.770 
you a life bar plus I think the
randomness<00:03:34.549> of<00:03:34.700> the<00:03:34.760> rocks<00:03:35.060> actually<00:03:35.299> makes<00:03:35.660> a

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
randomness of the rocks actually makes a

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:37.869 
randomness of the rocks actually makes a
little<00:03:35.930> more<00:03:36.260> exciting<00:03:36.769> so<00:03:37.280> long<00:03:37.489> as<00:03:37.609> you<00:03:37.700> just

00:03:37.869 --> 00:03:37.879 
little more exciting so long as you just

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:40.390 
little more exciting so long as you just
keep<00:03:37.940> on<00:03:38.299> moving<00:03:38.750> you<00:03:38.900> should<00:03:39.139> be<00:03:39.260> okay<00:03:39.590> the

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
keep on moving you should be okay the

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.009 
keep on moving you should be okay the
same<00:03:40.639> deal<00:03:40.849> applies<00:03:41.180> to<00:03:41.359> the<00:03:41.450> other<00:03:41.480> climbing

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:42.019 
same deal applies to the other climbing

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:43.599 
same deal applies to the other climbing
level<00:03:42.290> just<00:03:42.560> keep<00:03:42.709> moving<00:03:43.069> as<00:03:43.160> fast<00:03:43.310> as<00:03:43.489> you

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:43.609 
level just keep moving as fast as you

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:44.920 
level just keep moving as fast as you
can<00:03:43.819> you<00:03:43.849> shouldn't<00:03:44.239> have<00:03:44.329> too<00:03:44.480> many<00:03:44.660> problems

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930

however at least they're smart enough to

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:31.690 
however at least they're smart enough to

you've already seen the fighting in this

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:37.300 
you've already seen the fighting in this
game<00:04:36.260> is<00:04:36.380> extremely<00:04:36.860> simple

game is extremely simple

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:39.760 
game is extremely simple
you<00:04:37.610> punch<00:04:37.940> you<00:04:38.330> kicked<00:04:38.690> you<00:04:39.140> can<00:04:39.290> jump<00:04:39.530> kick

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:39.770 
you punch you kicked you can jump kick

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:40.900 
you punch you kicked you can jump kick
although<00:04:40.010> that's<00:04:40.190> practically<00:04:40.700> worthless

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:40.910 
although that's practically worthless

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:42.910 
although that's practically worthless
and<00:04:41.690> that's<00:04:41.900> pretty<00:04:42.050> much<00:04:42.170> it<00:04:42.410> except<00:04:42.710> for<00:04:42.860> the

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:42.920 
and that's pretty much it except for the

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:45.610 
and that's pretty much it except for the
weapons<00:04:43.660> by<00:04:44.660> the<00:04:44.690> way<00:04:44.900> if<00:04:45.020> you<00:04:45.110> manage<00:04:45.350> to<00:04:45.470> hold

weapons by the way if you manage to hold

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:47.140 
weapons by the way if you manage to hold
on<00:04:45.800> to<00:04:45.950> your<00:04:46.040> weapons<00:04:46.400> in<00:04:46.490> this<00:04:46.580> game<00:04:46.670> it's<00:04:47.060> a

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:47.150 
on to your weapons in this game it's a

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:48.100 
on to your weapons in this game it's a
hell<00:04:47.300> of<00:04:47.330> a<00:04:47.510> lot<00:04:47.660> easier

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:48.110 
hell of a lot easier

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:49.840 
hell of a lot easier
in<00:04:48.470> fact<00:04:48.650> I<00:04:48.800> dare<00:04:49.010> say<00:04:49.040> that's<00:04:49.370> too<00:04:49.610> easy

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:49.850 
in fact I dare say that's too easy

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:51.160 
in fact I dare say that's too easy
because<00:04:50.060> all<00:04:50.330> you<00:04:50.390> have<00:04:50.540> to<00:04:50.630> do<00:04:50.750> to<00:04:50.840> beat<00:04:51.020> the

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:51.170 
because all you have to do to beat the

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:52.780 
because all you have to do to beat the
game<00:04:51.350> is<00:04:51.470> either<00:04:51.590> jump<00:04:51.980> over<00:04:52.220> enemies<00:04:52.610> or

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:52.790 
game is either jump over enemies or

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:54.820 
game is either jump over enemies or
shoot<00:04:53.030> them<00:04:53.120> from<00:04:53.240> a<00:04:53.390> distance<00:04:53.620> but<00:04:54.620> at<00:04:54.710> least

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:54.830 
shoot them from a distance but at least

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:56.710 
shoot them from a distance but at least
I'm<00:04:55.040> like<00:04:55.220> fucking<00:04:55.640> hunt<00:04:55.880> for<00:04:56.060> October<00:04:56.570> the

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:56.720 
I'm like fucking hunt for October the

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:58.060 
I'm like fucking hunt for October the
bullets<00:04:57.020> will<00:04:57.170> go<00:04:57.290> across<00:04:57.650> the<00:04:57.890> screen

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:58.070 
bullets will go across the screen

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:00.640 
bullets will go across the screen
instead<00:04:58.400> of<00:04:58.520> just<00:04:58.640> stopping<00:04:58.940> halfway<00:04:59.650> another

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:00.650 
instead of just stopping halfway another

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:02.140 
instead of just stopping halfway another
thing<00:05:00.890> I<00:05:00.980> really<00:05:01.130> like<00:05:01.280> about<00:05:01.610> this<00:05:01.880> game<00:05:02.000> is

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:02.150 
thing I really like about this game is

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:03.700 
thing I really like about this game is
that<00:05:02.300> it<00:05:02.480> stays<00:05:02.660> very<00:05:02.930> true<00:05:03.200> to<00:05:03.320> the<00:05:03.350> movie

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:03.710 
that it stays very true to the movie

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:05.380 
that it stays very true to the movie
it's<00:05:03.830> based<00:05:04.070> on<00:05:04.280> although<00:05:05.150> you<00:05:05.240> can

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:05.390 
it's based on although you can

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:07.420 
it's based on although you can
legitimately<00:05:05.900> argue<00:05:06.470> that<00:05:06.620> most<00:05:06.890> movie<00:05:07.220> based

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:07.430 
legitimately argue that most movie based

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:09.100 
legitimately argue that most movie based
games<00:05:07.670> do<00:05:07.880> stay<00:05:08.090> relatively<00:05:08.480> true<00:05:08.840> to<00:05:08.960> their

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:09.110 
games do stay relatively true to their

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:10.960 
games do stay relatively true to their
source<00:05:09.350> material<00:05:09.410> this<00:05:10.220> game<00:05:10.430> takes<00:05:10.700> it<00:05:10.850> one

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:10.970 
source material this game takes it one

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:12.490 
source material this game takes it one
step<00:05:11.030> further<00:05:11.420> and<00:05:11.690> literally<00:05:11.930> has<00:05:12.200> scenes

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:12.500 
step further and literally has scenes

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:15.160 
step further and literally has scenes
directly<00:05:13.040> from<00:05:13.310> the<00:05:13.610> movie<00:05:13.970> this<00:05:14.780> includes

directly from the movie this includes
the<00:05:15.350> fight<00:05:15.560> with<00:05:15.740> a<00:05:15.770> guy<00:05:16.010> in<00:05:16.070> the<00:05:16.190> slope<00:05:16.520> and

the fight with a guy in the slope and

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:18.400 
the fight with a guy in the slope and

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:18.410 
game even rides him down to the bottom

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:19.990

and gets off at the last second just

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.850 
and gets off at the last second just
like<00:05:20.090> the<00:05:20.330> movie<00:05:20.630> not<00:05:21.080> to<00:05:21.200> mention<00:05:21.380> the<00:05:21.560> battle

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:21.860
