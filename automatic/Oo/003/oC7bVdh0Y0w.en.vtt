00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
kind of going this one is on the bottom

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:44.410 
kind of going this one is on the bottom
the<00:01:39.630> easiest<00:01:39.899> way<00:01:40.109> to<00:01:40.139> get<00:01:40.409> them<00:01:40.560> out<00:01:41.209> is<00:01:42.209> to

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
the easiest way to get them out is to

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.590 
the easiest way to get them out is to
push

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.310 

if<00:01:48.080> he<00:01:48.260> can<00:01:48.440> push<00:01:49.570> next<00:01:50.570> time<00:01:50.810> get<00:01:50.990> somebody

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
if he can push next time get somebody

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.550 
if he can push next time get somebody
else<00:01:51.410> to<00:01:51.500> hold<00:01:51.710> the<00:01:51.800> camera

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.370 

the<00:01:55.040> metal<00:01:55.340> part<00:01:55.580> through<00:01:56.110> pull<00:01:57.110> it<00:01:57.200> out<00:01:57.350> just

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
the metal part through pull it out just

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.920 
the metal part through pull it out just
kind<00:01:57.740> of<00:01:57.770> where<00:01:57.980> the<00:01:58.100> weight<00:01:58.250> went<00:01:58.490> in<00:01:58.900> pull<00:01:59.900> it

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930 
kind of where the weight went in pull it

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.830 
kind of where the weight went in pull it
out<00:02:00.400> and<00:02:01.400> you'll<00:02:01.550> be<00:02:01.670> able<00:02:01.820> to<00:02:01.910> pull<00:02:02.630> these

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
out and you'll be able to pull these

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.920 
out and you'll be able to pull these
things<00:02:03.140> through<00:02:04.450> just<00:02:05.450> so<00:02:05.540> you<00:02:05.660> don't<00:02:05.690> have<00:02:05.810> to

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:05.930 
things through just so you don't have to

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:07.030 
things through just so you don't have to
sit<00:02:06.050> there<00:02:06.080> and<00:02:06.200> figure<00:02:06.380> out<00:02:06.530> how<00:02:06.680> to<00:02:06.740> do<00:02:06.890> it

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:07.040 
sit there and figure out how to do it

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.320 
sit there and figure out how to do it
it's<00:02:07.340> a<00:02:07.400> lot<00:02:07.490> easier<00:02:07.640> if<00:02:07.820> you<00:02:07.910> just<00:02:08.030> do<00:02:08.179> it<00:02:08.240> this

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
it's a lot easier if you just do it this

here<00:02:42.200> across<00:02:42.500> from<00:02:42.770> this<00:02:42.920> it<00:02:43.610> mounts<00:02:43.970> right

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
here across from this it mounts right

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:45.790 
here across from this it mounts right
there<00:02:44.330> screw<00:02:44.720> down<00:02:44.900> on<00:02:45.110> it<00:02:45.290> you<00:02:45.320> just<00:02:45.470> tighten

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:45.800 
there screw down on it you just tighten

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.280 
there screw down on it you just tighten
it<00:02:45.890> up<00:02:46.040> then<00:02:46.430> you<00:02:46.550> see<00:02:46.730> this<00:02:46.880> hole<00:02:47.120> right<00:02:47.480> here

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
it up then you see this hole right here

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:49.660 
it up then you see this hole right here
in<00:02:48.440> the<00:02:48.530> bottom<00:02:48.770> of<00:02:48.860> this<00:02:48.920> it'll<00:02:49.250> sit<00:02:49.459> right<00:02:49.610> on

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
in the bottom of this it'll sit right on

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:54.250 
in the bottom of this it'll sit right on
that<00:02:50.030> and<00:02:50.959> then<00:02:51.190> just<00:02:52.190> screws<00:02:52.580> into<00:02:53.030> it<00:02:53.260> so

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
that and then just screws into it so

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.130 
that and then just screws into it so
that's<00:02:54.470> how<00:02:54.590> that<00:02:55.550> works<00:02:55.850> and<00:02:56.660> at<00:02:56.780> this<00:02:56.900> time

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
that's how that works and at this time

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.130 
that's how that works and at this time

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
you would reply the hose clamp to the

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.229 
you would reply the hose clamp to the
bottom<00:03:00.440> of<00:03:00.560> this<00:03:00.739> well<00:03:01.550> when<00:03:01.850> you<00:03:01.940> put<00:03:02.120> it
