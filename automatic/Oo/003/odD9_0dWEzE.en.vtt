we're going to do the nose or this other
line<00:01:53.100> it's<00:01:54.090> going<00:01:54.180> to<00:01:54.240> be<00:01:54.299> easy<00:01:54.479> to<00:01:54.600> do<00:01:54.689> this

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
line it's going to be easy to do this

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.060 
line it's going to be easy to do this
for<00:01:55.020> now<00:01:55.140> so<00:01:55.380> we're<00:01:55.500> going<00:01:55.590> to<00:01:55.649> take<00:01:55.770> this<00:01:55.920> line

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
for now so we're going to take this line

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.830 
for now so we're going to take this line
is<00:01:56.189> going<00:01:56.250> to<00:01:56.369> go<00:01:56.460> into<00:01:56.670> the<00:01:56.729> nose<00:01:56.909> so<00:01:57.540> I<00:01:57.600> come

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
is going to go into the nose so I come

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.350 
is going to go into the nose so I come
down<00:01:57.869> it's<00:01:58.200> going<00:01:58.320> to<00:01:58.380> follow<00:01:58.560> this<00:01:58.860> line<00:01:58.920> as

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
down it's going to follow this line as

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.060 
down it's going to follow this line as
in<00:02:00.360> go<00:02:00.780> parallel<00:02:01.380> so<00:02:01.619> that<00:02:01.649> I<00:02:01.740> mean<00:02:01.890> it's<00:02:02.040> just

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
in go parallel so that I mean it's just

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.370 
in go parallel so that I mean it's just
kind<00:02:03.030> of<00:02:03.180> follow<00:02:03.390> the<00:02:03.570> line<00:02:03.750> so<00:02:03.960> this<00:02:04.079> is<00:02:04.259> going

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
kind of follow the line so this is going

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.219 
kind of follow the line so this is going
to<00:02:04.439> come<00:02:04.619> down<00:02:04.829> this<00:02:04.979> is<00:02:05.100> part<00:02:05.310> of<00:02:05.340> a<00:02:05.430> snow<00:02:06.229> then

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
to come down this is part of a snow then

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.969 
to come down this is part of a snow then

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
nose comes out like right here

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.740 
nose comes out like right here
so<00:02:13.920> that<00:02:14.130> line<00:02:14.570> going<00:02:15.570> to<00:02:15.690> meet<00:02:15.960> that<00:02:16.170> line<00:02:17.750> and

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
so that line going to meet that line and

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:25.840 
so that line going to meet that line and
so<00:02:19.380> we're<00:02:19.530> going<00:02:19.620> to<00:02:19.680> come<00:02:19.860> across<00:02:20.100> like<00:02:22.910> so

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:30.300 
bit and then it's going to come on and

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.510 
bit and then it's going to come on and
then<00:03:30.690> down<00:03:30.900> the<00:03:31.050> bottom<00:03:31.170> here<00:03:31.380> we're<00:03:32.280> going<00:03:32.459> to

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:34.490 
do this we're going to draw a line here

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:38.510 
do this we're going to draw a line here
and<00:03:35.490> then<00:03:36.480> we're<00:03:36.720> going<00:03:36.810> to<00:03:36.870> go<00:03:37.020> on<00:03:37.260> up<00:03:37.950> and

and then we're going to go on up and
meet<00:03:38.580> the<00:03:38.940> smile<00:03:39.270> there<00:03:39.750> we<00:03:39.900> go<00:03:40.020> perfect<00:03:42.140> now

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
meet the smile there we go perfect now

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
and we got one two three four lines so

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.460 
and we got one two three four lines so
here's<00:04:10.620> one<00:04:10.770> tooth<00:04:10.950> is<00:04:11.340> five<00:04:11.610> teeth<00:04:11.970> going<00:04:12.270> up
