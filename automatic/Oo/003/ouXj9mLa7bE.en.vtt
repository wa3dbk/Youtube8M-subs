00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.510 
that and let's look at the ghost it's
not<00:01:15.210> really<00:01:15.450> different<00:01:16.050> from<00:01:16.260> the<00:01:17.220> very<00:01:17.460> first

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
not really different from the very first

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.080 
not really different from the very first
one<00:01:17.910> that<00:01:18.030> came<00:01:18.180> out<00:01:18.590> but<00:01:19.760> it's<00:01:20.760> just

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
one that came out but it's just

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.600 
one that came out but it's just
highlighted<00:01:21.780> with<00:01:21.960> dirt<00:01:22.440> or<00:01:22.770> whatever<00:01:23.399> they

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
highlighted with dirt or whatever they

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.840 
highlighted with dirt or whatever they
want<00:01:23.820> like<00:01:24.330> whatever<00:01:25.290> they<00:01:25.520> wanted<00:01:26.520> you<00:01:26.670> to

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
want like whatever they wanted you to

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.820 
want like whatever they wanted you to
think<00:01:27.060> it<00:01:27.240> was<00:01:27.420> like<00:01:27.750> this<00:01:27.930> dark<00:01:28.229> patches<00:01:28.800> here

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:28.830 
think it was like this dark patches here

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:34.249 
think it was like this dark patches here
and<00:01:30.350> right<00:01:31.350> here<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:32.040> yellow<00:01:32.750> the<00:01:33.750> very<00:01:33.960> first

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
and right here the yellow the very first

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:35.660 
and right here the yellow the very first
one<00:01:34.440> that<00:01:34.560> came<00:01:34.710> out<00:01:34.860> was<00:01:35.040> a<00:01:35.100> different<00:01:35.490> color

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
one that came out was a different color

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.170 
one that came out was a different color
or<00:01:36.509> it<00:01:36.690> was<00:01:36.810> more<00:01:37.020> silver<00:01:37.440> I<00:01:37.470> think<00:01:37.830> and<00:01:38.180> the

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
or it was more silver I think and the

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.279 
or it was more silver I think and the
purple<00:01:39.540> looked<00:01:39.810> a<00:01:39.899> lot<00:01:40.020> better<00:01:40.759> but<00:01:42.080> this<00:01:43.080> is

00:01:43.279 --> 00:01:43.289 
purple looked a lot better but this is

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:45.249 
purple looked a lot better but this is
for<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.560> brute<00:01:43.860> so<00:01:44.220> I<00:01:44.250> guess<00:01:44.520> they<00:01:44.759> changed

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:45.259 
for the brute so I guess they changed

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:47.990 
for the brute so I guess they changed
they<00:01:46.259> repainted<00:01:46.830> it<00:01:46.979> like<00:01:47.190> all<00:01:47.369> other

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
they repainted it like all other

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.950 
they repainted it like all other
different<00:01:48.869> kinds<00:01:49.350> of<00:01:49.410> toys<00:01:52.039> okay<00:01:53.840> it's<00:01:54.840> not

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
different kinds of toys okay it's not

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.199 
different kinds of toys okay it's not
really<00:01:55.110> much<00:01:55.410> you<00:01:55.649> can<00:01:55.800> move<00:01:55.950> on<00:01:56.220> this<00:01:56.429> ghost

00:01:57.199 --> 00:01:57.209
