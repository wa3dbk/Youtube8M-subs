00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
that i do see what this device is that

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.859 
that i do see what this device is that
the<00:00:28.649> cables<00:00:29.129> that<00:00:29.640> you<00:00:29.849> have<00:00:30.090> to<00:00:30.239> plugins<00:00:30.689> can

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
the cables that you have to plugins can

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.729 
the cables that you have to plugins can
only<00:00:31.079> be<00:00:31.320> Kaponi<00:00:31.770> java<00:00:32.989> hdmi<00:00:33.989> that<00:00:34.290> like<00:00:34.530> some

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
only be Kaponi java hdmi that like some

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.740 
only be Kaponi java hdmi that like some
people<00:00:35.010> like<00:00:35.129> to<00:00:35.160> play<00:00:35.550> it<00:00:35.760> you<00:00:36.270> can<00:00:36.450> only<00:00:36.539> have

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
people like to play it you can only have

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.299 
people like to play it you can only have
a<00:00:36.809> component<00:00:37.200> cable<00:00:37.500> so<00:00:37.770> i<00:00:37.829> think<00:00:37.890> that's<00:00:38.129> a

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
a component cable so i think that's a

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.729 
a component cable so i think that's a
big<00:00:38.550> problem<00:00:38.940> with<00:00:39.210> this<00:00:39.390> device<00:00:39.809> and<00:00:40.170> it

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
big problem with this device and it

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.479 
big problem with this device and it
doesn't<00:00:41.129> really<00:00:41.249> play<00:00:41.550> good<00:00:41.879> in<00:00:42.179> HD<00:00:43.489> another

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
doesn't really play good in HD another

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.610 
doesn't really play good in HD another
problem<00:00:44.730> that<00:00:44.940> idea<00:00:45.390> face<00:00:45.719> with<00:00:45.989> this<00:00:46.140> device

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
problem that idea face with this device

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.130 
problem that idea face with this device
is<00:00:46.890> that<00:00:46.949> there<00:00:47.879> are<00:00:47.909> software<00:00:48.420> for<00:00:48.809> only

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
is that there are software for only

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.599 
is that there are software for only
works<00:00:49.679> with<00:00:50.010> a<00:00:50.539> pc<00:00:51.539> or<00:00:51.780> a<00:00:51.949> windows<00:00:52.949> computer<00:00:52.980> as

00:00:53.599 --> 00:00:53.609 
works with a pc or a windows computer as

00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:55.910 
works with a pc or a windows computer as
some<00:00:53.909> might<00:00:54.149> say<00:00:54.420> it<00:00:54.899> does<00:00:55.199> not<00:00:55.229> work<00:00:55.649> with<00:00:55.890> a

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
some might say it does not work with a

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.430 
some might say it does not work with a
mac<00:00:56.280> at<00:00:56.550> all<00:00:56.789> so<00:00:57.420> i<00:00:57.449> think<00:00:57.690> they<00:00:57.960> really<00:00:58.229> need

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
mac at all so i think they really need

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.529 
mac at all so i think they really need
to<00:00:58.620> fix<00:00:58.859> that<00:00:59.100> so<00:00:59.370> it<00:00:59.550> can<00:00:59.670> be<00:00:59.789> compatible<00:01:00.510> with

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
to fix that so it can be compatible with

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.490 
to fix that so it can be compatible with
all<00:01:01.019> machines<00:01:01.499> in<00:01:01.769> this<00:01:02.129> not<00:01:02.489> a<00:01:03.500> windows

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
all machines in this not a windows

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.530 
all machines in this not a windows
computer<00:01:04.530> but<00:01:05.190> Allah<00:01:05.400> nanette<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:06.060> software

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
computer but Allah nanette the software

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.450 
computer but Allah nanette the software
is<00:01:06.750> very<00:01:06.900> advanced<00:01:07.500> and<00:01:07.799> worked<00:01:08.040> very<00:01:08.340> well

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
is very advanced and worked very well

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.410 
is very advanced and worked very well
