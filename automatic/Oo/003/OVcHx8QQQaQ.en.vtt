00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
this is the crystal orbit flex with the

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.299 
this is the crystal orbit flex with the
multi<00:00:48.870> adapt<00:00:49.170> now<00:00:49.679> the<00:00:49.739> first<00:00:49.949> thing<00:00:50.070> i<00:00:50.219> want

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
multi adapt now the first thing i want

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.520 
multi adapt now the first thing i want
to<00:00:50.399> touch<00:00:50.550> on<00:00:50.760> is<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.600> multi<00:00:51.929> adapt<00:00:52.230> and<00:00:52.440> how

to touch on is the multi adapt and how
that<00:00:52.589> works<00:00:52.920> on<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.969> back<00:00:54.089> here<00:00:54.329> you<00:00:54.420> see<00:00:54.539> you

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
that works on the back here you see you

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.310 
that works on the back here you see you
have<00:00:54.780> a<00:00:54.809> clip<00:00:55.160> now<00:00:56.329> the<00:00:57.329> clip<00:00:57.539> actually<00:00:57.750> can<00:00:58.170> be

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
have a clip now the clip actually can be

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.650 
have a clip now the clip actually can be
transferred<00:00:59.070> and<00:00:59.399> change<00:00:59.940> into<00:01:00.239> many

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
transferred and change into many

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.479 
transferred and change into many
different<00:01:00.749> things<00:01:01.230> just<00:01:02.219> with<00:01:03.829> releasing<00:01:04.829> the

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
different things just with releasing the

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.969 
different things just with releasing the
latch<00:01:05.670> on<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.210> back<00:01:06.240> now<00:01:07.049> how<00:01:07.200> this<00:01:07.380> works<00:01:07.710> is

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
latch on the back now how this works is

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.890 
latch on the back now how this works is
there's<00:01:08.130> a<00:01:08.189> little<00:01:08.400> kind<00:01:08.850> of<00:01:08.939> a<00:01:09.000> pushpin<00:01:09.630> here

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
there's a little kind of a pushpin here

there's a little kind of a pushpin here
that<00:01:10.140> you<00:01:10.590> just<00:01:10.740> get<00:01:10.890> in<00:01:10.979> there<00:01:11.070> with<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.340> pin

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
that you just get in there with the pin

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.550 
that you just get in there with the pin
and<00:01:11.579> push<00:01:12.000> it<00:01:12.150> down<00:01:12.270> now<00:01:13.079> you<00:01:13.140> can<00:01:13.439> either

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
and push it down now you can either

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.340 
and push it down now you can either
leave<00:01:13.860> it<00:01:14.009> blank<00:01:14.159> leave<00:01:15.150> it<00:01:15.299> blank<00:01:15.479> leave<00:01:16.170> it

bottom which I
I'm<00:02:13.650> really<00:02:13.950> impressed<00:02:14.190> with<00:02:14.400> for<00:02:14.670> the<00:02:14.730> simple

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
I'm really impressed with for the simple

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.360 
I'm really impressed with for the simple
fact<00:02:15.060> that<00:02:15.420> I<00:02:15.780> used<00:02:16.200> to<00:02:16.319> have<00:02:16.440> a<00:02:16.470> leather<00:02:17.099> case

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
fact that I used to have a leather case

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.520 
fact that I used to have a leather case
very<00:02:17.760> similar<00:02:18.090> to<00:02:18.180> this<00:02:18.300> it<00:02:18.510> was<00:02:18.599> at<00:02:18.750> Rex<00:02:19.050> Tamia

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
very similar to this it was at Rex Tamia

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.660 
very similar to this it was at Rex Tamia
and<00:02:19.819> it<00:02:20.819> flipped<00:02:21.180> up<00:02:21.390> the<00:02:22.379> problem<00:02:22.739> with<00:02:22.890> with

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
and it flipped up the problem with with

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.360 
and it flipped up the problem with with
it<00:02:23.819> when<00:02:23.910> it<00:02:23.940> flips<00:02:24.269> up<00:02:24.450> is<00:02:24.890> when<00:02:25.890> you<00:02:26.040> put<00:02:26.250> the

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
it when it flips up is when you put the

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.550 
it when it flips up is when you put the
phone<00:02:26.519> up<00:02:26.550> to<00:02:26.700> your<00:02:26.819> ear<00:02:26.970> you<00:02:27.390> have<00:02:28.080> this

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
material used here on the back is really

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.210 
material used here on the back is really
it's<00:03:00.840> not<00:03:01.019> the<00:03:01.170> softest<00:03:01.560> material<00:03:01.709> in<00:03:02.129> the

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
it's not the softest material in the

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.360 
it's not the softest material in the
world<00:03:02.370> it's<00:03:02.519> a<00:03:02.579> little<00:03:02.849> bit<00:03:03.000> rough<00:03:03.239> and<00:03:04.370> with

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
world it's a little bit rough and with

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.180 
world it's a little bit rough and with
how<00:03:05.549> tight<00:03:06.030> the<00:03:06.390> phone<00:03:06.629> slides<00:03:07.049> in<00:03:07.349> here<00:03:07.709> it

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
how tight the phone slides in here it

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.630 
how tight the phone slides in here it
really<00:03:09.650> doesn't<00:03:10.650> make<00:03:10.799> me<00:03:10.980> so<00:03:11.099> much<00:03:11.220> nervous

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
really doesn't make me so much nervous

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.069 
really doesn't make me so much nervous
that's<00:03:11.790> going<00:03:11.940> to<00:03:12.000> scratch<00:03:12.329> the<00:03:12.599> phone<00:03:12.750> every

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:13.079 
that's going to scratch the phone every

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:15.949 
that's going to scratch the phone every
time<00:03:13.290> but<00:03:13.680> it<00:03:14.340> definitely<00:03:14.569> makes<00:03:15.569> me<00:03:15.750> think

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
time but it definitely makes me think

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:18.440 
time but it definitely makes me think
that<00:03:16.049> there<00:03:16.230> is<00:03:16.379> a<00:03:16.410> possibility<00:03:17.099> of<00:03:17.489> it<00:03:17.639> but

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
that there is a possibility of it but

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.930 
that there is a possibility of it but
once<00:03:18.720> it<00:03:18.840> gets<00:03:19.019> in<00:03:19.139> here<00:03:19.579> just<00:03:20.579> like<00:03:20.700> really

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
once it gets in here just like really

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.970 
once it gets in here just like really
any<00:03:21.209> leather<00:03:21.510> sliding<00:03:22.200> case<00:03:22.410> like<00:03:22.650> this<00:03:22.769> that

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
any leather sliding case like this that

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.580 
any leather sliding case like this that
I've<00:03:23.160> seen<00:03:23.340> at<00:03:23.519> least<00:03:23.639> you<00:03:24.480> have<00:03:24.690> the<00:03:25.109> bottom

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
I've seen at least you have the bottom

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.949 
I've seen at least you have the bottom

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
open up here let me get rid of that the

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:31.129 
open up here let me get rid of that the
bottom<00:03:28.290> opened<00:03:28.620> up<00:03:28.799> on<00:03:29.180> both<00:03:30.180> sides<00:03:30.420> chrome

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:31.139 
bottom opened up on both sides chrome

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:34.069 
bottom opened up on both sides chrome
exposed<00:03:31.950> chrome<00:03:32.880> exposure<00:03:33.239> along<00:03:33.690> the<00:03:33.870> top

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:34.079 
exposed chrome exposure along the top

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:37.430 
exposed chrome exposure along the top
and<00:03:34.349> along<00:03:35.010> with<00:03:35.040> the<00:03:35.340> sides<00:03:35.959> now<00:03:36.959> one<00:03:37.230> thing<00:03:37.260> I

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
and along with the sides now one thing I

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.020 
and along with the sides now one thing I
wasn't<00:03:37.620> so<00:03:37.859> fond<00:03:38.130> of<00:03:38.220> when<00:03:38.370> we<00:03:38.459> get<00:03:38.639> up<00:03:38.730> close

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
wasn't so fond of when we get up close

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.059 
wasn't so fond of when we get up close
here<00:03:39.209> is<00:03:39.389> as<00:03:39.569> you<00:03:39.750> can<00:03:39.840> tell<00:03:40.049> the<00:03:40.500> cut<00:03:40.769> out<00:03:40.859> here

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:41.069 
here is as you can tell the cut out here

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:43.430 
here is as you can tell the cut out here
isn't<00:03:41.280> really<00:03:41.790> that<00:03:42.000> accurate<00:03:42.299> so<00:03:42.870> the<00:03:43.079> strap

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
isn't really that accurate so the strap

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.539 
isn't really that accurate so the strap
here<00:03:43.950> actually<00:03:44.430> covers<00:03:45.209> the<00:03:45.599> silent<00:03:46.380> switch

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:46.549 
here actually covers the silent switch

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:48.979 
here actually covers the silent switch
so<00:03:47.549> you<00:03:47.880> definitely<00:03:48.030> have<00:03:48.269> to<00:03:48.359> dig<00:03:48.660> in<00:03:48.810> there<00:03:48.959> a

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989 
so you definitely have to dig in there a

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:50.720

pops right into place most the times of

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:07.699 
pops right into place most the times of
course<00:04:06.569> it's<00:04:06.780> not<00:04:06.870> going<00:04:07.019> to<00:04:07.169> this<00:04:07.290> time<00:04:07.500> and
