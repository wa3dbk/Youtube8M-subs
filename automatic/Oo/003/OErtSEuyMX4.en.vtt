00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:06.600
 talk there people are good 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:11.849
 so I'm bringing here one more 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:15.809
 tutorial and on this occasion I'll show 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:18.690
 how will you increase your 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:23.010
 performance of your android 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:25.680
 Ram memory consumption is first 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.550
 thing you will need access to 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.550
 2011 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:32.369
 so if you do not have root access you 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:36.239
 search the world for how to do 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:38.969
 ruth and where I have lived or an example as 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.070
 do the last motorola defy how to do 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.879
 mount no galaxy and 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:47.340
 finally you put the social name I will do 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:48.660
 after you do the Russian then 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:54.079
 you already have a useful 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:56.399
 we'll need an app called 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:01:03.199
 to the start 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:03.199
 so let's install she 's there 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:15.810
 Let's open here. 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:19.730
 all the applications you have in 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:22.530
 your android is delayed about 30 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:24.390
 seconds something around it 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.710
 here in my case it will take a while 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:31.950
 but because of what I'm recording 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:33.630
 so I'll speed up a little video for 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.230
 do not take too long 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.230
 okay 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:55.870
 It's good that you've already uploaded and this program 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:58.150
 does the following it prevents applications from 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:01.740
 nice judo with system 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:08.229
 he does with the same thing that does the 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:10.690
 oms config windows 7 that you can 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.000
 to remove the program from the 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.070
 system 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.910
 so here you will choose the 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:20.770
 application you do not use for example I 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:22.990
 not the map application 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:25.150
 so I do not see the need for him to stay 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:26.080
 running full-time domain more 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.810
 phone 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:32.530
 so we come here on maps we stay 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:38.560
 in it or forget to say something to 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:42.220
 It is how you will be going 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:44.680
 being so is with groups then 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:47.440
 options here in the 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:51.670
 android on the android go button options 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.660
 in grain pda say api application my 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.209
 God 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:57.640
 Then it's going to be so, so let's go to the 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:03:01.420
 new map application then the 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:04.060
 his needs are always active 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.560
 that god hungry to consume memory 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.920
 Ram who is already slightly 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.900
 Come on, we'll stay on maps. Let's go. 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:14.590
 track and be faithful 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:18.090
 Let's say I'm going to give an okay here and go. 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.090
 ask for access 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:24.980
 It's not in my case you did not ask because I already 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:28.000
 had done your good 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:31.730
 Other thing I do not use youtube 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:35.000
 I mean I do not even use the 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:39.319
 booting system wells to another 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:43.640
 Another time understood then let's see who 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:45.410
 Did the zebu cover ok then you do 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:49.220
 this with all the applications you 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:51.950
 not use because you even use 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:54.080
 finally you will be able to open later but in 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:55.760
 you will be able to open it and 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:57.080
 about it will prevent her from following 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.480
 with the system 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:00.470
 so as I've never app 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.180
 maps 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:04.519
 I 'll never use it so he never 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:08.390
 will never be opened in my memory 

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:12.349
 ram because the maps application it 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:15.349
 consumes a lot of ram goal so I 

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:17.900
 I advise you to disable it then 

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:22.490
 you're going to do it with all the 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:24.919
 programs that you do not use to vote 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:30.289
 quite simple the same way you did 

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:33.380
 to put the seville and zebu and call 

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:38.510
 put in lebu I do not know if I 'm talking 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:42.680
 But you preferred the video, it was that good. 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:44.510
 simple, very easy to do and then 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:46.850
 any doubt there you leave a 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:49.880
 comment to video creator 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:53.210
 and if you like, do not forget to leave it 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:56.030
 that lilic he likes that 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:59.000
 shared basis to help 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:00.860
