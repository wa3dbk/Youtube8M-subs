00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:06.439
 let's prepare light cheese cake and 

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:09.800
 without sugar the ingredients that 

00:00:06.439 --> 00:00:11.900
 we need are 250 grams of cheeses or 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:14.510
 light portions or white cheese we want 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:16.400
 or light type 200 philadelphia 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:19.250
 milliliters of cream or milk cream 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.710
 light breakfast mary cookies 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:24.410
 digestyc or the one we like the most 1 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:26.960
 teaspoon and a half of liquid stevia 10 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:29.300
 grams of neutral gelatine grenetine 100 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:32.090
 milliliters of skimmed milk and for 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:34.850
 decorate light jam candies 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:37.280
 Europeans what we like and we are going to 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:40.640
 Start by putting in a saucepan the 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:42.880
 cheese or the cheese in question with the 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.520
 cream 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:48.730
 and at low medium fire we are going to go 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:50.800
 melting well in this step we have 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:53.200
 have patience and we have to be 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.690
 insisting on dissolving the cheese well 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:58.390
 with the cream while we are going to hydrate the 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:00.160
 neutral gelatin or grenetine in our 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:01.890
 glass of 100 milliliters of milk 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.949
 skimmed 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.150
 we put it in the milk and we move it well 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.220
 with a spoon 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:12.160
 by the way milk is better than 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:14.350
 cold and once we have the cheese well 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:16.500
 dissolved that as you see it cost me 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:16.500
 quite 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:24.369
 we throw it into our mix of 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:26.200
 cream and cheese and without the mixture arriving 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:29.560
 to boil we will heat it at least 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:33.850
 for one or two minutes while we go 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:38.649
 to measure the stevia that as you can see are a 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:41.140
 teaspoon dessert and half can you 

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:42.880
 use another kind of different sweetener 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.340
 but you have to take into account the 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.920
 dosage as not all sweeten 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:50.649
 same and not all serve to cook 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:53.200
 they lose their sweetening properties 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:55.929
 with the heat so you'll just have to 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.000
 look in the container once we have the 

00:01:55.929 --> 00:02:01.119
 mix let's throw in some molds 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.429
 silicone a little bit of candy and 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:05.890
 although this part would make this recipe 

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:08.140
 no longer suitable for diabetics 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.810
 you can skip this step and at the end 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:13.209
 completely give the decoration touch or 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:16.180
 sweetener how best to suit you 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:18.640
 family and in your situation 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:22.000
 We are going to distribute the mixture for our 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:25.000
 molds to us we have left 8 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.750
 individual artists and we're going to 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.700
 put a round cookie to each one and 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.550
 we're going to take it to the fridge for a 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.800
 3 hours minimum 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:37.930
 once the mixture has set 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:40.990
 we help with a knife to unmold 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:43.720
 and we turn them over and as you can see 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:46.060
 will be ready in some we take advantage 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:49.660
 the candy and in others we decorate them with 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:51.780
 a little bit of light jam suitable for 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.780
 diabetics 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:58.250
 and now we have our cake 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:03:00.409
 light cheese and sugar-free as you see 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.239
 this time we have presented in molds 

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:04.010
 individual but that's no problem 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:07.730
 to make all the mixture in a mold 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:10.250
 big and have a family cake like 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:12.530
 you see is very easy and for those who do not 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.690
 have sugar problems or excess 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:17.659
 of weight you can make the same recipe 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:19.909
 with the ingredients with all their fat and 

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:22.340
 substituting stevia for 4 or 5 

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:24.260
 tablespoons of sugar so 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.870
 we wanted to make this recipe 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:29.299
 dedicated to people with problems of 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:31.430
 sugar or of excess weight or that 

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:34.459
 you just do not want to indulge 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:36.140
 too much caloric and we have given in the 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:41.409
 nail the result is surprising 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:41.409
 and they are delicious
