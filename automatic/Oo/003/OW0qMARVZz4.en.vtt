00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 or the machine the new routines of 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.910
 heating with rope that is going to 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.189
 prepare the body for routine 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.469
 intense let's start with your own 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.769
 circular movements out 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.240
 changing the foot eight repetitions 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:18.150
 also the same thing we're going to do circles 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.010
 inward eight times each time 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.140
 changing we do not forget to prepare the 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.590
 hips circles out with the 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.960
 knees wide enough eight times towards 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.900
 outside and the same thing we're going to do towards 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.660
 in changing the direction of 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.700
 important move prepare all 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.489
 joints in your body before 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:41.160
 any type of arms training 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.780
 back eight circles too 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.629
 shoulders are very important although 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.490
 when you jump the rope and yourself towards 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:51.760
 forward eight repetitions 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:53.430
 another hug the same eight times towards 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.460
 behind 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:59.090
 fast and wide movement and same eight 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.980
 times forward 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.140
 Now let's start heating the 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:07.100
 trunk the column so grab your 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:12.200
 rope folded between your hands and we're going to 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:16.430
 start doing turns 1 2 3 4 and 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:18.590
 so it goes a little deeper each time 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:23.390
 the movement and now inclinations 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:24.870
 side also side by side about 8 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.480
 times 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:30.870
 Now we are going to prepare very well the 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:35.820
 pectorals grab your rope and pass back 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:38.280
 and go back and forth this 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.530
 movement is great to stretch all 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:44.730
 the arms all your chest and obviously 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:48.210
 Warm up before jumps very well 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:51.300
 and we are going to start preparing ourselves 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.490
 to jump the rope even if not 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.860
 you know jump to the end of this video you 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.350
 I leave tutorial how to learn how to do it 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:01.140
 let's start with very jumps 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:05.820
 tiny little ones the rhythm can be 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:08.490
 slower if you do not need preparing from 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:11.220
 a little cardiovascular system for 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:15.380
 intense training that we are going to do 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.380
 obviously after warming 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.260
 jump jump 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:22.420
 and soon I will change for the jumps 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:26.080
 basic with both feet 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:29.290
 at the same time jumping is also one 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.970
 of the easiest jumps from this 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:34.480
 you have to start jumping when 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:36.670
 you need to learn and here the more 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.990
 fast jumps obviously more intense 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.630
 it will be around here but since the 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:44.320
 warming rhythm has to be to 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:46.630
 regular without going over the limit let's go 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:49.600
 do not increase a bit at the end of the 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:54.340
 Jumps now as the school agrees 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:58.570
 we jump so I do a 4x4 changing the 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:59.500
 leg one two three four other two 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:04.330
 three 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:06.760
 now I'm going to jump for 22 12 also like that 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:09.520
 heat prepares you for more agility 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.470
 have during the routine now I jump 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:13.690
 one by one so always when 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:16.600
 heat tries to change learn 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:20.080
 different jumps to later apply 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:22.630
 that agility in training 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.730
 and now I'm starting to increase a bit 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:28.300
 of knee rhythm and I have a little more 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:30.940
 upwards more working the legs 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:34.120
 tightening the abdominals here I do 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:36.280
 approximately 50 jumps but days 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.710
 up that will also increase a 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:41.170
 little the heart rate beat just what 

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:44.620
 we need to prepare body 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:47.650
 for the intense routine with the jumps 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:50.470
 it also depends on your level you can 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:52.870
 make it a bit slower you can take 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:56.650
 a little more time to learn some 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:04:00.250
 jumps you're still missing a bit and I 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:03.520
 I finish and soon finish the jumps 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:05.440
 to end up spilled with narrow law that 

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:08.830
 we go down preparing the 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:12.040
 hamstrings here calves also 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:14.670
 heel on the floor of 2 upwards the 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:17.519
 two legs 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:20.609
 now I have lunch is to start a little 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:22.440
 involve the adductors and I'm going towards 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:26.280
 down again 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:28.590
 well here you are ready you are ready 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:31.530
 to test my intense routine with rope 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:34.410
 here you have between plane in 15 minutes 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:35.580
 that does not know how to jump also check the 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:37.380
 tutorial routine

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:40.160
