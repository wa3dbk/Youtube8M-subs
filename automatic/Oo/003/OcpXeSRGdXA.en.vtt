to talk about the remarkable effect that

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:18.100 
to talk about the remarkable effect that
nightcrawlers<00:00:16.519> have<00:00:16.789> on<00:00:17.090> aiding<00:00:17.600> water<00:00:17.810> flow

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:18.110 
nightcrawlers have on aiding water flow

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:22.240 
nightcrawlers have on aiding water flow
into<00:00:18.770> and<00:00:19.010> through<00:00:19.880> soils<00:00:20.770> well<00:00:21.770> your<00:00:21.950> your

soil physicist Eileen so we better talk
about<00:00:25.250> it<00:00:25.580> about<00:00:26.119> water<00:00:26.300> flights<00:00:26.600> talk<00:00:26.960> about

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:27.289 
about it about water flights talk about

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:29.320 
about it about water flights talk about
that<00:00:27.529> wolf<00:00:27.800> code<00:00:28.100> because<00:00:28.550> of<00:00:28.730> obviously

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:29.330 
that wolf code because of obviously

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:31.450 
that wolf code because of obviously
water<00:00:29.720> is<00:00:29.930> a<00:00:29.960> free<00:00:30.289> resource<00:00:30.500> to<00:00:30.980> the<00:00:31.070> farmer

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:31.460 
water is a free resource to the farmer

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.650 
water is a free resource to the farmer
right<00:00:31.850> in<00:00:32.509> general<00:00:32.870> our<00:00:33.289> soils<00:00:34.130> are

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:34.660 
right in general our soils are

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.450 
right in general our soils are
excessively<00:00:35.660> wet<00:00:36.020> in<00:00:36.230> the<00:00:36.380> spring<00:00:36.649> and<00:00:37.130> and

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:37.460 
excessively wet in the spring and and

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.069 
excessively wet in the spring and and
that's<00:00:37.730> more<00:00:38.030> of<00:00:38.149> our<00:00:38.270> issue<00:00:38.420> and<00:00:38.780> that's<00:00:38.960> why

00:00:39.069 --> 00:00:39.079 
that's more of our issue and that's why

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:40.660 
that's more of our issue and that's why
we<00:00:39.290> use<00:00:39.320> tile<00:00:39.710> drainage<00:00:40.070> and<00:00:40.309> things<00:00:40.520> like

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:40.670 
we use tile drainage and things like

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.690 
we use tile drainage and things like
that<00:00:40.880> but<00:00:41.059> but<00:00:41.720> what<00:00:42.590> I'm<00:00:42.710> getting<00:00:42.890> at<00:00:43.220> really

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:43.700 
that but but what I'm getting at really

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.280 
that but but what I'm getting at really
is<00:00:43.850> that<00:00:44.180> the<00:00:44.360> nightcrawlers<00:00:44.690> but<00:00:45.170> in

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:45.290 
is that the nightcrawlers but in

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:46.870 
is that the nightcrawlers but in
particular<00:00:45.890> can<00:00:46.040> be<00:00:46.070> very<00:00:46.370> important<00:00:46.820> for

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:46.880 
particular can be very important for

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.209 
particular can be very important for
getting<00:00:47.260> infiltration<00:00:48.260> of<00:00:48.500> water<00:00:48.559> into<00:00:49.010> the

00:00:49.209 --> 00:00:49.219 
getting infiltration of water into the

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:52.180 
getting infiltration of water into the
soil<00:00:49.610> during<00:00:50.420> the<00:00:50.750> growing<00:00:51.290> season<00:00:51.469> so<00:00:51.920> when

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190 
soil during the growing season so when

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.490 
soil during the growing season so when
we<00:00:52.309> get<00:00:52.460> those<00:00:52.670> quick<00:00:53.360> thunderstorms<00:00:54.200> in<00:00:54.440> the

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:54.500 
we get those quick thunderstorms in the

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.229 
we get those quick thunderstorms in the
middle<00:00:54.770> of<00:00:54.860> the<00:00:54.950> summer<00:00:55.160> we<00:00:55.399> usually<00:00:55.760> want<00:00:55.940> all

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:56.239 
middle of the summer we usually want all

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:59.560 
middle of the summer we usually want all
that<00:00:56.510> water<00:00:56.719> to<00:00:56.930> go<00:00:57.200> in<00:00:58.030> because<00:00:59.030> that's<00:00:59.329> not

00:00:59.560 --> 00:00:59.570 
that water to go in because that's not

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:01.930 
that water to go in because that's not
when<00:00:59.930> we<00:01:00.079> have<00:01:00.110> excess<00:01:00.890> water<00:01:01.160> so<00:01:01.520> we<00:01:01.640> want<00:01:01.820> the

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:01.940 
when we have excess water so we want the

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:03.459 
when we have excess water so we want the
water<00:01:02.090> to<00:01:02.210> go<00:01:02.300> into<00:01:02.600> the<00:01:02.719> soil<00:01:02.930> but<00:01:03.170> but

00:01:03.459 --> 00:01:03.469 
water to go into the soil but but

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:07.380 
water to go into the soil but but
especially<00:01:03.739> with<00:01:04.250> soils<00:01:04.729> that<00:01:04.879> are<00:01:04.939> high<00:01:05.449> silt

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:07.390 
especially with soils that are high silt

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.060 
especially with soils that are high silt
sometimes<00:01:08.390> you<00:01:08.540> can<00:01:08.690> get<00:01:08.810> crusting<00:01:09.320> you<00:01:09.650> have

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.070 
sometimes you can get crusting you have

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.500 
sometimes you can get crusting you have
less<00:01:10.250> crusting<00:01:10.760> of<00:01:10.850> course<00:01:11.060> if<00:01:11.240> you're<00:01:11.390> in

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:11.510 
less crusting of course if you're in

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:13.510 
less crusting of course if you're in
no-till<00:01:11.900> yes<00:01:12.350> but<00:01:12.950> if<00:01:13.100> you<00:01:13.130> have<00:01:13.280> a<00:01:13.340> lot<00:01:13.490> of

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
no-till yes but if you have a lot of

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.000 
no-till yes but if you have a lot of
night<00:01:13.760> crawlers<00:01:14.240> those<00:01:14.750> deep<00:01:15.080> channels<00:01:15.710> that

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:16.010 
night crawlers those deep channels that

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:18.130 
night crawlers those deep channels that
the<00:01:16.159> night<00:01:16.310> crawlers<00:01:16.670> make<00:01:16.880> can<00:01:17.119> really<00:01:17.479> help

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.140 
the night crawlers make can really help

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.500 
the night crawlers make can really help
get<00:01:18.530> water<00:01:18.799> into<00:01:19.340> the<00:01:19.460> soil<00:01:19.610> profile<00:01:20.210> where

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:20.510 
get water into the soil profile where

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:22.149 
get water into the soil profile where
you<00:01:20.540> have<00:01:20.780> a<00:01:20.810> chance<00:01:21.110> for<00:01:21.320> your<00:01:21.470> crop<00:01:21.710> to<00:01:21.920> use

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:22.159 
you have a chance for your crop to use

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:24.429 
you have a chance for your crop to use
it<00:01:22.400> as<00:01:22.549> opposed<00:01:23.119> to<00:01:23.240> having<00:01:23.450> it<00:01:23.630> run<00:01:23.869> off<00:01:24.080> you

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:24.439 
it as opposed to having it run off you

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:26.740 
it as opposed to having it run off you
know<00:01:24.560> an<00:01:24.799> extra<00:01:25.189> inch<00:01:25.400> or<00:01:25.640> two<00:01:25.820> of<00:01:25.850> water<00:01:26.030> in<00:01:26.630> a

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 
know an extra inch or two of water in a

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.140 
know an extra inch or two of water in a
lot<00:01:26.960> of<00:01:26.990> our<00:01:27.229> summers<00:01:27.650> makes<00:01:28.189> makes<00:01:28.729> a<00:01:28.939> big

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:29.150 
lot of our summers makes makes a big

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.630 
lot of our summers makes makes a big
difference<00:01:29.570> in<00:01:29.750> okay<00:01:30.170> yield<00:01:30.380> yeah<00:01:30.860> yes<00:01:31.189> okay

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 
difference in okay yield yeah yes okay

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.590 
difference in okay yield yeah yes okay
all<00:01:32.000> right<00:01:32.150> and<00:01:32.930> I<00:01:33.049> happen<00:01:33.650> to<00:01:33.680> have<00:01:33.920> a<00:01:33.950> few

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:34.600 
all right and I happen to have a few

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.420 
all right and I happen to have a few
demonstrations<00:01:35.600> of<00:01:36.259> some<00:01:36.470> night<00:01:36.680> crawlers<00:01:36.860> if

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:37.430 
demonstrations of some night crawlers if

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:38.950 
demonstrations of some night crawlers if
you'd<00:01:37.580> like<00:01:37.759> to<00:01:38.030> see<00:01:38.299> of<00:01:38.509> Nightcrawler

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:38.960 
you'd like to see of Nightcrawler

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.630 
you'd like to see of Nightcrawler
channels<00:01:39.560> if<00:01:39.740> you'd<00:01:39.860> like<00:01:39.979> to<00:01:40.130> toast

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 
channels if you'd like to toast

channels if you'd like to toast
I<00:01:40.700> would<00:01:41.000> love<00:01:41.180> to<00:01:41.240> season<00:01:41.810> so<00:01:42.080> this<00:01:42.470> is<00:01:42.740> my

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
I would love to season so this is my

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.030 
I would love to season so this is my
technician<00:01:44.060> a<00:01:44.180> number<00:01:44.450> of<00:01:44.570> years<00:01:44.810> ago<00:01:45.040> went

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:46.040 
technician a number of years ago went

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:51.039 
technician a number of years ago went
out<00:01:46.220> and<00:01:46.490> poured<00:01:47.180> the<00:01:47.570> liquid<00:01:47.829> rubber<00:01:50.049> latex

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:51.049 
out and poured the liquid rubber latex

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:52.929 
out and poured the liquid rubber latex
basically<00:01:51.710> that<00:01:51.890> you<00:01:52.009> use<00:01:52.280> in<00:01:52.520> in<00:01:52.759> biology

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:52.939 
basically that you use in in biology

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:55.390 
basically that you use in in biology
classes<00:01:53.600> on<00:01:53.990> an<00:01:54.140> area<00:01:54.470> where<00:01:54.710> there<00:01:54.890> were<00:01:55.070> some

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:55.400 
classes on an area where there were some

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.580 
classes on an area where there were some
Nightcrawler<00:01:55.850> middens<00:01:56.360> then<00:01:57.049> he<00:01:57.140> came<00:01:57.320> back<00:01:57.560> a

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
Nightcrawler middens then he came back a

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.190 
Nightcrawler middens then he came back a
couple<00:01:57.770> days<00:01:58.040> later<00:01:58.490> after<00:01:58.880> it<00:01:59.329> had<00:01:59.540> hardened

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
couple days later after it had hardened

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.679 
couple days later after it had hardened
and<00:02:00.409> he<00:02:00.470> carefully<00:02:00.950> dug<00:02:01.579> it<00:02:01.880> out<00:02:02.030> and<00:02:02.390> you<00:02:02.509> can

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:02.689 
and he carefully dug it out and you can

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:05.740 
and he carefully dug it out and you can
see<00:02:03.049> the<00:02:03.740> these<00:02:04.189> were<00:02:04.490> Nightcrawler<00:02:05.119> channels

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
see the these were Nightcrawler channels

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.369 
see the these were Nightcrawler channels
all<00:02:06.049> in<00:02:06.530> in<00:02:06.860> this<00:02:07.189> one<00:02:07.939> square<00:02:08.239> foot<00:02:08.599> area<00:02:08.899> in

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:09.379 
all in in this one square foot area in

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:12.129 
all in in this one square foot area in
one<00:02:09.799> slip<00:02:10.249> foot<00:02:10.609> that<00:02:11.359> basically<00:02:11.959> those

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:12.139 
one slip foot that basically those

00:02:12.139 --> 00:02:14.049 
one slip foot that basically those
channels<00:02:12.499> are<00:02:12.799> going<00:02:13.069> down<00:02:13.219> they've<00:02:13.609> broken<00:02:13.879> a

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:14.059 
channels are going down they've broken a

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:15.010 
channels are going down they've broken a
little<00:02:14.299> bit<00:02:14.419> now<00:02:14.540> in<00:02:14.659> the<00:02:14.749> mean

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
little bit now in the mean

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.110 
little bit now in the mean
but<00:02:15.320> but<00:02:15.800> some<00:02:16.040> of<00:02:16.130> these<00:02:16.190> channels<00:02:16.520> were<00:02:16.850> down

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
but but some of these channels were down

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.900 
but but some of these channels were down
three<00:02:17.450> feet<00:02:17.660> deep<00:02:17.930> okay<00:02:18.530> and<00:02:18.920> just<00:02:18.950> imagine

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
three feet deep okay and just imagine

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.900 
three feet deep okay and just imagine
water<00:02:20.360> flowing<00:02:21.320> across<00:02:21.830> the<00:02:22.100> surface<00:02:22.340> and

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
water flowing across the surface and

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.390 
water flowing across the surface and
into<00:02:23.390> these<00:02:23.540> channels<00:02:24.080> how<00:02:24.230> much<00:02:24.470> water<00:02:25.100> can

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
into these channels how much water can

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.780 
into these channels how much water can
flow<00:02:25.610> down<00:02:25.640> those<00:02:26.150> those<00:02:26.540> big<00:02:27.080> and<00:02:27.440> deep

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
flow down those those big and deep

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.980 
flow down those those big and deep
channels<00:02:28.790> and<00:02:29.030> they're<00:02:29.150> very<00:02:29.300> vertical<00:02:29.600> you

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:29.990 
channels and they're very vertical you

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:31.540 
channels and they're very vertical you
can<00:02:30.170> see<00:02:30.350> that<00:02:30.680> there<00:02:30.890> but<00:02:31.070> you've<00:02:31.220> got<00:02:31.430> the

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550 
can see that there but you've got the

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:33.490 
can see that there but you've got the
vertical<00:02:32.030> flow<00:02:32.270> and<00:02:32.510> then<00:02:32.660> they<00:02:33.170> have<00:02:33.380> the

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
vertical flow and then they have the

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.770 
vertical flow and then they have the
chance<00:02:33.710> to<00:02:33.890> flow<00:02:34.190> laterally<00:02:34.910> as<00:02:35.030> oh<00:02:35.210> yes<00:02:35.450> yes

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
chance to flow laterally as oh yes yes

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.050 
chance to flow laterally as oh yes yes
right<00:02:36.230> once<00:02:36.470> the<00:02:36.590> water<00:02:36.800> is<00:02:36.920> down<00:02:37.160> in<00:02:37.310> the<00:02:37.400> soil

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
right once the water is down in the soil

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:39.640 
right once the water is down in the soil
it's<00:02:38.180> going<00:02:38.330> to<00:02:38.390> move<00:02:38.510> out<00:02:38.750> from<00:02:38.960> those<00:02:39.200> this

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
it's going to move out from those this

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.190 
it's going to move out from those this
is<00:02:39.680> a<00:02:39.860> fantastic<00:02:40.600> illustration<00:02:41.600> and<00:02:41.780> this<00:02:41.960> was

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
is a fantastic illustration and this was

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.340 
is a fantastic illustration and this was
taken<00:02:42.680> on<00:02:42.770> a<00:02:42.830> farm<00:02:43.190> field<00:02:43.460> yes<00:02:43.940> well<00:02:44.870> Audion<00:02:45.260> I

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
taken on a farm field yes well Audion I

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.290 
taken on a farm field yes well Audion I
love<00:02:45.620> this<00:02:45.830> yeah<00:02:46.190> right<00:02:46.430> yes<00:02:46.670> I<00:02:46.850> think<00:02:47.060> it's<00:02:47.210> a

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 
love this yeah right yes I think it's a

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:48.820 
love this yeah right yes I think it's a
great<00:02:47.420> great<00:02:47.690> demonstration<00:02:48.680> of

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830 
great great demonstration of

00:02:48.830 --> 00:03:01.340 
great great demonstration of
Nightcrawler<00:02:49.640> channels

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:04.160 

you

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170
