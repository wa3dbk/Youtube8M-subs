00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 good time of day in this exclusive 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.359
 the material will give you the opportunity to look 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.849
 into the inside of the heating pipe and 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:11.690
 see with your own eyes how much scale 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:14.340
 remains on the inner walls of the pipe 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:17.609
 of the scale within the heat exchanger 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.830
 coil degrades thermal conductivity in 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:23.820
 reduces boiler efficiency 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:26.910
 thereby increasing gas consumption 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.550
 and, accordingly, in vain spent our 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.949
 finance a little pipe information in 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.260
 which we will drop in earlier me 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.390
 there was a greenhouse for growing tulips and 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.790
 cucumber I used it to heat 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.239
 gas boiler heat exchanger of this azov 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.460
 co2 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.469
 was made of metal pipes 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.899
 one and a half inches in diameter for watering 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.140
 sit down in the greenhouse I used water 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:51.390
 systems it is trailed in the heating system 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:53.760
 there was a constant influx of fresh water then 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.510
 there is water constantly there was changing the system 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.520
 heating 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.920
 used four months a year 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.079
 warm up served 7 years after 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.480
 how the dutch flowers scored the whole market 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.790
 I disassembled the greenhouse and cut the pipes 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.400
 heating on the host legs when i cut 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.890
 the heat exchanger tube I just marveled 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.020
 seeing a huge amount of scum 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.770
 which is deposited on the inner walls 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.659
 this group 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.340
 I used this pipe for a small 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.710
 fence and now we will see 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.229
 how much scum has formed here and 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.900
 seen example make a conclusion system 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.830
 heating must be poured 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.869
 distilled water is no such 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.360
 opportunities rainwater and but 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:33.930
 rebuilt 3 heating system 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:36.299
 must be performed once correctly 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:39.500
 and reliably in order not to be 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:41.909
 further repairs of radiator replacement and 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.479
 pipelines i.e. once done and 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:47.070
 forever fill this system 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:49.590
 distilled water and not adding water 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.659
 enjoy a long long time and a dollar also 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.590
 should not allow water to break in 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.380
 heat exchanger 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:58.500
 above 90 degrees the lower the temperature 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:01.670
 less water will be thanks now 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.670
 for the attention of you all the best
