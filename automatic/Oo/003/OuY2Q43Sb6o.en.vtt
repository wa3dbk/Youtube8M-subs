00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.370 
you guys think is better personally I
use<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:51.149> a1<00:01:51.509> of<00:01:51.659> course<00:01:51.869> in<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.079> beginning

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
use the a1 of course in the beginning

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.899 
use the a1 of course in the beginning
because<00:01:52.500> that's<00:01:52.770> when<00:01:53.009> you<00:01:53.100> unlock<00:01:53.340> first<00:01:53.700> and

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
because that's when you unlock first and

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.709 
because that's when you unlock first and
I<00:01:54.530> didn't<00:01:55.530> really<00:01:55.979> like<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.430> gun<00:01:56.880> that<00:01:57.119> wasn't

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
I didn't really like the gun that wasn't

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.510 
I didn't really like the gun that wasn't
really<00:01:57.990> satisfied<00:01:58.170> with<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:58.740> sniping<00:01:59.250> with

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
less or more hitmarkers is probably the

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.119 
less or more hitmarkers is probably the
same<00:02:47.909> damage<00:02:48.299> and<00:02:48.689> game<00:02:48.900> and<00:02:49.230> and<00:02:49.379> all<00:02:50.099> that

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
guys is opinion on white which sniper

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.149 
guys is opinion on white which sniper
you<00:03:00.840> like<00:03:01.019> better<00:03:01.260> you<00:03:01.500> know<00:03:01.620> you<00:03:01.680> can't<00:03:01.980> just

00:03:02.149 --> 00:03:02.159 
you like better you know you can't just

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:04.729 
you like better you know you can't just
tell<00:03:02.459> me<00:03:02.609> oh<00:03:02.760> I<00:03:03.299> think<00:03:03.900> the<00:03:04.019> MSR<00:03:04.409> is<00:03:04.530> better

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
tell me oh I think the MSR is better

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:06.559 
tell me oh I think the MSR is better
because<00:03:04.950> it<00:03:05.220> represents<00:03:05.790> the<00:03:05.879> intervention

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:06.569 
because it represents the intervention

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:08.569 
because it represents the intervention
or<00:03:06.720> I<00:03:06.900> think<00:03:07.230> the<00:03:07.319> l1<00:03:07.680> is<00:03:07.889> better<00:03:08.159> because<00:03:08.340> it

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:08.579 
or I think the l1 is better because it

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:11.149 
or I think the l1 is better because it
looks<00:03:08.819> kinda<00:03:09.389> like<00:03:09.419> the<00:03:09.840> m40<00:03:10.530> you<00:03:10.650> know<00:03:10.739> I<00:03:10.919> want

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:11.159 
looks kinda like the m40 you know I want

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:14.390 
looks kinda like the m40 you know I want
a<00:03:11.250> real<00:03:11.459> explanation<00:03:12.319> like<00:03:13.319> oh<00:03:13.560> you<00:03:14.099> know<00:03:14.129> the

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
a real explanation like oh you know the

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.490 
a real explanation like oh you know the
MSR<00:03:14.819> is<00:03:15.000> better<00:03:15.359> because<00:03:15.629> it<00:03:15.959> seems<00:03:16.230> like<00:03:16.290> it

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
MSR is better because it seems like it

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.189 
MSR is better because it seems like it
has<00:03:16.650> a<00:03:16.680> slower<00:03:17.069> scoping<00:03:17.639> but<00:03:17.819> it<00:03:17.939> bolts<00:03:18.750> faster

00:03:19.189 --> 00:03:19.199 
has a slower scoping but it bolts faster

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:21.050 
has a slower scoping but it bolts faster
because<00:03:19.349> of<00:03:19.620> the<00:03:19.739> slower<00:03:19.979> scope<00:03:20.280> in<00:03:20.489> there<00:03:20.639> the

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
because of the slower scope in there the

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.360 
because of the slower scope in there the
l1<00:03:21.479> is<00:03:21.510> a<00:03:21.959> lot<00:03:22.440> better<00:03:22.620> because<00:03:22.859> the<00:03:23.069> scopes

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
l1 is a lot better because the scopes

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.309 
l1 is a lot better because the scopes
and<00:03:23.609> faster<00:03:24.030> and<00:03:24.239> i'm<00:03:24.449> not<00:03:24.599> sure<00:03:24.810> if<00:03:24.959> those<00:03:25.139> are

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:25.319 
and faster and i'm not sure if those are

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:27.409 
and faster and i'm not sure if those are
real<00:03:25.530> but<00:03:26.099> from<00:03:26.310> what<00:03:26.430> i<00:03:26.489> see<00:03:26.819> when<00:03:26.849> i<00:03:27.060> play<00:03:27.299> the

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:27.419 
real but from what i see when i play the

00:03:27.419 --> 00:03:29.809 
real but from what i see when i play the
game<00:03:27.599> it<00:03:27.780> looks<00:03:27.810> like<00:03:28.440> that<00:03:28.709> l1<00:03:29.280> zooms<00:03:29.609> in<00:03:29.790> a

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:29.819 
game it looks like that l1 zooms in a

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:31.759 
game it looks like that l1 zooms in a
little<00:03:30.299> bit<00:03:30.419> faster<00:03:30.629> but<00:03:31.049> it<00:03:31.079> bolts<00:03:31.440> a<00:03:31.530> little

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769 
little bit faster but it bolts a little

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:33.710 
little bit faster but it bolts a little
bit<00:03:31.859> slower<00:03:32.190> because<00:03:32.400> of<00:03:32.699> the<00:03:32.879> zooming<00:03:33.629> in

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
bit slower because of the zooming in

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.039 
bit slower because of the zooming in
fast<00:03:34.049> or<00:03:34.799> maybe<00:03:35.159> it<00:03:35.669> bolts<00:03:36.090> slower<00:03:36.419> a<00:03:36.569> period

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
fast or maybe it bolts slower a period

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:39.170 
fast or maybe it bolts slower a period
and<00:03:37.199> they<00:03:37.290> zoom<00:03:37.500> in<00:03:37.620> the<00:03:37.739> same<00:03:38.010> the<00:03:38.639> same<00:03:38.669> way

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
and they zoom in the same the same way

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.569 
and they zoom in the same the same way
but<00:03:40.139> either<00:03:40.349> way<00:03:40.560> it<00:03:40.590> has<00:03:40.829> a<00:03:40.859> little<00:03:41.280> weird

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:41.579 
but either way it has a little weird

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:44.059 
but either way it has a little weird
glitch<00:03:42.120> to<00:03:42.419> it<00:03:42.569> don't<00:03:42.780> really<00:03:43.079> enjoy<00:03:43.739> the
