00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
which of course also exists within

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.180 
which of course also exists within
animals<00:00:37.790> but<00:00:38.790> of<00:00:38.910> course<00:00:39.120> it's<00:00:39.270> amplified

park at the library in fairfield so much

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:58.880 
park at the library in fairfield so much
peace<00:00:55.020> so<00:00:55.680> much<00:00:55.860> harmony<00:00:56.250> that<00:00:56.789> exists<00:00:57.890> in

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
peace so much harmony that exists in

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.270 
peace so much harmony that exists in
animals<00:00:59.370> and<00:00:59.640> how<00:01:00.149> they're<00:01:00.359> not<00:01:00.480> driven<00:01:01.280> house

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
animals and how they're not driven house

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.130 
animals and how they're not driven house
they<00:01:02.489> are<00:01:02.550> totally<00:01:02.730> within<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.270> moment<00:01:03.690> that

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
they are totally within the moment that

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.920 
they are totally within the moment that
take<00:01:04.350> care<00:01:04.530> of<00:01:04.650> their<00:01:04.799> basic<00:01:05.189> needs<00:01:05.780> you<00:01:06.780> know

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
take care of their basic needs you know

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.350 
take care of their basic needs you know
how<00:01:07.049> they're<00:01:07.260> very<00:01:07.470> much<00:01:07.710> together<00:01:08.700> in

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
how they're very much together in

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:19.469 
how they're very much together in
harmony

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:19.479 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:25.380 

so<00:01:20.479> much<00:01:20.630> we<00:01:20.780> can<00:01:20.810> learn<00:01:21.020> from<00:01:21.080> animals

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:25.390 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:27.000 

all<00:01:26.020> we<00:01:26.170> would<00:01:26.290> have<00:01:26.320> to<00:01:26.470> do<00:01:26.650> is<00:01:26.770> to<00:01:26.860> pay

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:27.010 
all we would have to do is to pay

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:35.330 
all we would have to do is to pay
attention<00:01:31.530> so<00:01:32.530> pay<00:01:32.710> attention<00:01:32.740> to<00:01:33.310> each<00:01:33.370> other

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
attention so pay attention to each other

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.740 
attention so pay attention to each other
pay<00:01:36.340> attention<00:01:36.369> to<00:01:36.700> ourselves<00:01:36.850> first<00:01:37.390> of<00:01:37.600> all

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:37.750 
pay attention to ourselves first of all

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.920 
pay attention to ourselves first of all
she's<00:01:38.290> really<00:01:38.530> where<00:01:38.680> it<00:01:38.770> begins<00:01:39.720> one<00:01:40.720> of<00:01:40.840> the

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:40.930 
she's really where it begins one of the

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:42.540 
she's really where it begins one of the
tools<00:01:41.140> that<00:01:41.380> many<00:01:41.710> of<00:01:41.830> us<00:01:41.979> are<00:01:42.100> familiar<00:01:42.250> with

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:42.550 
tools that many of us are familiar with

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:47.100 
tools that many of us are familiar with
to<00:01:42.940> do<00:01:43.119> that<00:01:43.770> it's<00:01:44.770> meditation<00:01:45.990> Julie<00:01:46.990> is<00:01:47.050> a

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.110 
to do that it's meditation Julie is a

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.499 
to do that it's meditation Julie is a
matter<00:01:47.259> of<00:01:47.320> going<00:01:47.530> within<00:01:48.180> it's<00:01:49.180> about<00:01:49.270> the

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:49.509 
matter of going within it's about the

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:57.040 
matter of going within it's about the
inner<00:01:49.690> work

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:57.050 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.540 

actually<00:01:58.050> reminds<00:01:58.500> us<00:01:58.590> of<00:01:58.620> who<00:01:58.830> we<00:01:58.860> are<00:01:59.010> and

00:01:59.540 --> 00:01:59.550 
actually reminds us of who we are and

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:01.940 
actually reminds us of who we are and
helps<00:02:00.540> us<00:02:00.660> to<00:02:00.780> understand<00:02:01.170> better<00:02:01.290> our<00:02:01.500> nature

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
helps us to understand better our nature

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:08.540 
helps us to understand better our nature
or<00:02:02.190> human<00:02:02.580> nature<00:02:06.230> it<00:02:07.230> is<00:02:07.320> about<00:02:07.590> nature<00:02:08.070> we

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
or human nature it is about nature we

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:15.690 
or human nature it is about nature we
are<00:02:08.700> all<00:02:08.940> part<00:02:09.240> of<00:02:09.360> nature

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.699 

it<00:02:16.300> says<00:02:16.480> we<00:02:16.629> have<00:02:16.690> become<00:02:16.959> very<00:02:16.989> very<00:02:17.500> much

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
it says we have become very very much

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:19.290 
it says we have become very very much
part<00:02:18.190> of<00:02:18.400> this<00:02:18.550> world<00:02:18.819> which<00:02:19.030> in<00:02:19.209> a<00:02:19.270> way

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
part of this world which in a way

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.040 
part of this world which in a way
somehow<00:02:19.629> follows<00:02:20.080> very<00:02:20.230> unnatural<00:02:20.650> laws<00:02:22.050> but

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
somehow follows very unnatural laws but

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.290 
somehow follows very unnatural laws but
production<00:02:23.470> and<00:02:23.830> consumption<00:02:24.220> and<00:02:24.670> I've

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
production and consumption and I've

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:26.640 
production and consumption and I've
talked<00:02:25.510> about<00:02:25.750> these<00:02:25.900> things<00:02:26.019> before<00:02:26.200> and<00:02:26.590> I

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
talked about these things before and I

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:32.520 
talked about these things before and I
don't<00:02:26.800> want<00:02:26.920> to<00:02:26.980> repeat<00:02:27.069> myself<00:02:27.400> here<00:02:27.879> but<00:02:31.530> it

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
don't want to repeat myself here but it

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:44.720 
don't want to repeat myself here but it
is<00:02:32.650> about<00:02:33.239> being<00:02:34.239> more<00:02:34.569> natural

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.550 

how<00:02:45.420> we<00:02:45.480> live<00:02:45.720> our<00:02:45.750> live

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.970 

now<00:02:49.190> we<00:02:49.250> are<00:02:49.430> not<00:02:49.520> so<00:02:49.670> much<00:02:49.790> driven<00:02:50.680> to<00:02:51.680> get

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
now we are not so much driven to get

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.970 
now we are not so much driven to get
where<00:02:52.250> we<00:02:52.340> want<00:02:52.550> to<00:02:52.640> be<00:02:52.700> and<00:02:53.319> have<00:02:54.319> what<00:02:54.830> we

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
where we want to be and have what we

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.260 
where we want to be and have what we
think<00:02:55.280> we<00:02:55.430> are<00:02:55.459> lacking<00:02:57.700> but<00:02:58.700> to<00:02:58.849> be<00:02:58.970> more<00:02:59.180> in

00:02:59.260 --> 00:02:59.270 
think we are lacking but to be more in

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:04.600 
think we are lacking but to be more in
the<00:02:59.360> now<00:03:02.200> ultimately<00:03:03.200> that<00:03:03.590> driven<00:03:04.370> is

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:04.610 
the now ultimately that driven is

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:06.759 
the now ultimately that driven is
achievement<00:03:05.569> orientation<00:03:06.170> keeps<00:03:06.380> us<00:03:06.560> from

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:06.769 
achievement orientation keeps us from

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:10.600 
achievement orientation keeps us from
that<00:03:08.709> while<00:03:09.709> at<00:03:09.830> the<00:03:09.860> same<00:03:10.069> time<00:03:10.130> also<00:03:10.430> it

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:10.610 
that while at the same time also it

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:15.009 
that while at the same time also it
creates<00:03:10.760> a<00:03:10.970> lot<00:03:11.090> of<00:03:12.069> friction<00:03:13.300> between<00:03:14.300> people

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:30.769 
they don't really have that need so much

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:35.199 
they don't really have that need so much
in<00:03:31.069> tune<00:03:32.799> who<00:03:33.799> themselves<00:03:34.040> follow<00:03:35.000> the

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:37.459 
instinct you have the problem is with us

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:38.740 
instinct you have the problem is with us
human<00:03:37.700> beings<00:03:37.730> that<00:03:38.060> we<00:03:38.209> have<00:03:38.330> the<00:03:38.450> sense<00:03:38.660> of

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
human beings that we have the sense of

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:41.410 
human beings that we have the sense of
awareness<00:03:39.099> which<00:03:40.099> basically<00:03:40.580> separated<00:03:40.910> us

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:41.420 
awareness which basically separated us

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:45.190 
awareness which basically separated us
from<00:03:41.450> animals

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.690 

but<00:03:46.200> still<00:03:46.409> we<00:03:46.590> are<00:03:46.620> animals<00:03:47.040> and<00:03:47.400> I<00:03:47.430> think

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
but still we are animals and I think

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.800 
but still we are animals and I think
it's<00:03:47.819> very<00:03:47.909> important<00:03:48.299> to<00:03:48.330> remember<00:03:48.599> that

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:53.600 

this<00:03:51.810> is<00:03:51.930> not<00:03:52.049> a<00:03:52.080> bad<00:03:52.349> thing<00:03:52.680> at<00:03:52.950> all<00:03:53.099> it's

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
this is not a bad thing at all it's

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.399 
this is not a bad thing at all it's
actually<00:03:53.730> a<00:03:53.940> good<00:03:54.120> thing<00:03:54.180> because<00:03:54.420> we<00:03:55.170> are

00:03:55.399 --> 00:03:55.409 
actually a good thing because we are

00:03:55.409 --> 00:03:56.869 
actually a good thing because we are
part<00:03:55.709> of<00:03:55.830> nature<00:03:55.890> just<00:03:56.400> like<00:03:56.519> all<00:03:56.819> the

how can we get
