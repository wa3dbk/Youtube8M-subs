so<00:00:00.599> this<00:00:01.050> is<00:00:01.319> the<00:00:01.979> current<00:00:02.340> state<00:00:02.610> of<00:00:02.669> our

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:03.200 
so this is the current state of our

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.470 
so this is the current state of our

on<00:00:08.000> so<00:00:09.000> let<00:00:09.690> me<00:00:09.809> explain<00:00:10.080> the<00:00:10.290> electronics<00:00:10.830> for

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
on so let me explain the electronics for

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.480 
on so let me explain the electronics for
for<00:00:11.550> bid<00:00:11.900> this<00:00:12.900> part<00:00:13.259> over<00:00:13.650> here<00:00:13.830> is<00:00:13.950> basically

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
for bid this part over here is basically

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.620 
for bid this part over here is basically
an<00:00:14.759> Arduino<00:00:15.450> it's<00:00:15.750> just<00:00:16.320> an<00:00:16.470> atmega

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:17.630 
an Arduino it's just an atmega

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:19.760 
an Arduino it's just an atmega
microcontroller<00:00:18.630> and<00:00:19.170> we<00:00:19.289> use<00:00:19.439> it<00:00:19.619> to

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
microcontroller and we use it to

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.279 
microcontroller and we use it to
generate<00:00:20.279> the<00:00:20.430> signal<00:00:20.730> which<00:00:21.270> goes<00:00:21.300> over<00:00:21.990> this

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
generate the signal which goes over this

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.800 
generate the signal which goes over this
cable<00:00:22.859> to<00:00:23.039> this<00:00:23.310> board<00:00:23.699> we<00:00:24.300> have<00:00:24.449> a<00:00:24.539> little

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
cable to this board we have a little

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.390 
cable to this board we have a little
waterfall<00:00:25.140> over<00:00:25.619> here<00:00:25.949> and<00:00:26.160> some

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
waterfall over here and some

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.269 
waterfall over here and some
multiplexers<00:00:27.359> and<00:00:27.570> that<00:00:28.289> we<00:00:28.380> use<00:00:28.619> to<00:00:28.920> address

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
multiplexers and that we use to address

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.530 
multiplexers and that we use to address
on<00:00:29.880> a<00:00:30.269> single<00:00:31.199> line<00:00:31.470> in<00:00:31.980> this<00:00:32.279> grid<00:00:32.700> array<00:00:33.090> over

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
on a single line in this grid array over

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.400 
on a single line in this grid array over
here<00:00:33.960> and<00:00:34.250> we<00:00:35.250> have<00:00:35.360> horizontal<00:00:36.360> lines<00:00:36.989> on<00:00:37.320> the

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
here and we have horizontal lines on the

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.479 
here and we have horizontal lines on the
bottom<00:00:37.620> of<00:00:37.920> this<00:00:38.070> green<00:00:38.460> our<00:00:38.879> PCB<00:00:40.489> which

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
bottom of this green our PCB which

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.380 
bottom of this green our PCB which
basically<00:00:41.969> form<00:00:42.329> lots<00:00:42.660> of<00:00:42.840> little<00:00:43.140> capacitors

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:44.390 
basically form lots of little capacitors

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.650 
basically form lots of little capacitors
along<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.660> lines<00:00:45.930> of<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:47.039> board<00:00:47.309> and<00:00:47.660> we

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
along the lines of the board and we

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.340 
along the lines of the board and we
collect<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:49.800> coupled<00:00:50.579> signal<00:00:51.120> at<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.899> sensor

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
collect the coupled signal at the sensor

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.279 
collect the coupled signal at the sensor
board<00:00:52.559> over<00:00:52.860> here<00:00:53.059> little<00:00:54.059> amplifiers<00:00:54.870> there

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
board over here little amplifiers there

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.099 
board over here little amplifiers there
to<00:00:55.590> to<00:00:56.340> amplify<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.329> signal<00:00:57.719> because<00:00:57.960> it's

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
to to amplify the signal because it's

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.439 
to to amplify the signal because it's
very<00:00:58.320> weak<00:00:58.680> after<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.129> coupling<00:00:59.579> and<00:00:59.789> we<00:01:00.329> have

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
very weak after the coupling and we have

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.840 
very weak after the coupling and we have
another<00:01:00.690> set<00:01:00.989> of<00:01:01.399> multiplexers<00:01:02.399> that<00:01:02.609> we<00:01:02.699> use

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
another set of multiplexers that we use

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.329 
another set of multiplexers that we use
to<00:01:03.090> demultiplex<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.110> signal<00:01:04.559> into<00:01:04.830> a<00:01:04.860> single

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
to demultiplex the signal into a single

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.550 
to demultiplex the signal into a single
signal<00:01:05.790> cable<00:01:06.270> that<00:01:06.689> we<00:01:06.780> can<00:01:06.990> send<00:01:07.229> it<00:01:07.350> back<00:01:07.380> to

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
signal cable that we can send it back to

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.039 
signal cable that we can send it back to
the<00:01:07.890> meeting<00:01:08.100> board<00:01:08.430> over<00:01:08.760> here<00:01:09.119> which<00:01:09.540> is<00:01:09.570> on

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
the meeting board over here which is on

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.500 
the meeting board over here which is on
the<00:01:10.140> breadboard<00:01:10.619> right<00:01:10.920> now<00:01:11.360> then<00:01:12.360> in<00:01:12.479> the

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
the breadboard right now then in the

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.140 
the breadboard right now then in the
next<00:01:12.689> step<00:01:13.140> we<00:01:13.320> use<00:01:13.470> a<00:01:13.500> lock-in<00:01:14.130> amplifier<00:01:14.760> to

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
next step we use a lock-in amplifier to

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.770 
next step we use a lock-in amplifier to
kind<00:01:15.960> of<00:01:16.250> get<00:01:17.250> rid<00:01:17.490> of<00:01:17.670> most<00:01:18.180> of<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.570> noise

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
kind of get rid of most of the noise

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.530 
kind of get rid of most of the noise
that<00:01:18.990> we<00:01:19.200> pick<00:01:19.409> up<00:01:19.590> along<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:19.950> way<00:01:20.250> like<00:01:20.610> stray

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
that we pick up along the way like stray

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.910 
that we pick up along the way like stray
on<00:01:21.960> radiation<00:01:22.710> from<00:01:23.369> from<00:01:24.110> from<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.290> air<00:01:25.560> like

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
on radiation from from from the air like

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.469 
on radiation from from from the air like
TV<00:01:26.820> signals<00:01:27.420> and<00:01:29.180> signals<00:01:30.180> from<00:01:30.299> the

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
TV signals and signals from the

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.260 
TV signals and signals from the
powerlines<00:01:31.020> and<00:01:31.170> all<00:01:31.320> that<00:01:32.000> now<00:01:33.000> we<00:01:33.060> have<00:01:33.240> a

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
powerlines and all that now we have a

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.859 
powerlines and all that now we have a
little<00:01:33.509> differential<00:01:34.049> amp<00:01:34.530> over<00:01:35.009> here<00:01:35.869> which

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
little differential amp over here which

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.999 
little differential amp over here which
we<00:01:37.110> use<00:01:37.350> to<00:01:37.799> feed<00:01:38.130> a<00:01:38.579> peak<00:01:39.180> detector<00:01:39.930> that<00:01:40.590> some

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
we use to feed a peak detector that some

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.030 
we use to feed a peak detector that some
the<00:01:41.579> part<00:01:41.820> over<00:01:42.090> there<00:01:42.240> with<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.780> little<00:01:43.439> LED

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
the part over there with the little LED

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.219 
the part over there with the little LED
on<00:01:44.250> top<00:01:44.520> then<00:01:45.180> we<00:01:45.299> have<00:01:45.420> an<00:01:45.570> output<00:01:45.899> stage

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
on top then we have an output stage

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.490 
on top then we have an output stage
amplifier<00:01:47.159> and<00:01:47.549> finally<00:01:48.240> we<00:01:48.630> lead<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:49.020> signal

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
amplifier and finally we lead the signal

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.950 
amplifier and finally we lead the signal
back<00:01:49.860> to<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:52.159> analog<00:01:53.159> digital<00:01:53.570> converter<00:01:54.570> on

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
back to the analog digital converter on

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.580 
back to the analog digital converter on
the<00:01:55.520> atmega<00:01:56.659> microcontroller<00:01:57.659> then<00:01:57.960> we<00:01:58.409> take

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
the atmega microcontroller then we take

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.429 
the atmega microcontroller then we take
a<00:01:58.619> measurement<00:01:58.829> and<00:01:59.250> we<00:01:59.369> do<00:01:59.520> this<00:01:59.640> for

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:00.439 
a measurement and we do this for

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:03.440 
a measurement and we do this for
everything<00:02:01.439> a<00:02:01.710> single<00:02:02.009> cross<00:02:02.490> point<00:02:02.909> on<00:02:03.270> the

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
everything a single cross point on the

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.440 
everything a single cross point on the
PCB<00:02:03.840> and<00:02:04.770> we<00:02:04.920> do<00:02:05.040> this<00:02:05.189> 22<00:02:05.850> times<00:02:06.149> I<00:02:06.390> think

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
PCB and we do this 22 times I think

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.680 
PCB and we do this 22 times I think
right<00:02:06.869> now<00:02:06.899> per<00:02:07.799> second

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
right now per second

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.330 
right now per second
for<00:02:08.810> 22<00:02:09.530> frames<00:02:09.950> on<00:02:10.310> the<00:02:10.790> tracker<00:02:11.380> and<00:02:12.380> this<00:02:13.160> is

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
for 22 frames on the tracker and this is

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.340 
for 22 frames on the tracker and this is
what<00:02:13.670> the<00:02:13.850> tracking<00:02:14.120> data<00:02:14.420> looks<00:02:14.810> like<00:02:15.050> on<00:02:15.260> the

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
what the tracking data looks like on the

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:17.380 
what the tracking data looks like on the
computer<00:02:15.500> we're<00:02:16.100> using<00:02:16.310> a<00:02:16.550> processing<00:02:17.060> sketch

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
computer we're using a processing sketch

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.010 
computer we're using a processing sketch
to<00:02:17.750> visualize<00:02:18.260> it<00:02:18.530> and<00:02:19.390> it<00:02:20.390> works<00:02:20.690> pretty<00:02:20.870> much

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.020 
to visualize it and it works pretty much

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.080 
to visualize it and it works pretty much
like<00:02:21.170> a<00:02:21.380> camera<00:02:21.770> image<00:02:22.100> but<00:02:22.640> as<00:02:22.760> you<00:02:22.880> can<00:02:23.030> see

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
like a camera image but as you can see

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.630 
like a camera image but as you can see
it's<00:02:23.480> rather<00:02:23.870> low<00:02:24.200> fidelity<00:02:24.620> which<00:02:25.190> is<00:02:25.370> why<00:02:25.520> we

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
it's rather low fidelity which is why we

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.060 
it's rather low fidelity which is why we
use<00:02:26.110> interpolation<00:02:27.110> techniques<00:02:27.620> to<00:02:27.890> get<00:02:28.040> a

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.070 
use interpolation techniques to get a

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:30.520 
use interpolation techniques to get a
better<00:02:28.310> picture<00:02:28.640> like<00:02:29.630> this<00:02:29.960> one<00:02:30.200> as<00:02:30.380> an

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
better picture like this one as an

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.180 
better picture like this one as an
example<00:02:30.590> you<00:02:31.250> can<00:02:31.460> clearly<00:02:31.940> see<00:02:32.240> the<00:02:32.360> hand<00:02:32.600> and

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
example you can clearly see the hand and

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.500 
example you can clearly see the hand and
one<00:02:34.190> of<00:02:34.280> the<00:02:34.370> nice<00:02:34.520> properties<00:02:34.760> of<00:02:35.390> the

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
one of the nice properties of the

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.480 
one of the nice properties of the
sensors<00:02:35.990> like<00:02:36.380> that<00:02:36.680> sensor<00:02:36.950> like<00:02:37.100> this<00:02:37.280> is

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:37.490 
sensors like that sensor like this is

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:40.960 
sensors like that sensor like this is
that<00:02:38.120> you<00:02:38.240> get<00:02:38.480> a<00:02:39.050> pretty<00:02:40.040> good<00:02:40.220> picture<00:02:40.520> of

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
that you get a pretty good picture of

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.600 
that you get a pretty good picture of
the<00:02:41.690> actual<00:02:41.990> weight<00:02:42.320> distribution<00:02:42.830> of<00:02:43.370> the

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
the actual weight distribution of the

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:45.640 
the actual weight distribution of the
hands<00:02:44.030> on<00:02:44.150> the<00:02:44.300> screen<00:02:44.630> so<00:02:45.440> you<00:02:45.500> could

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
hands on the screen so you could

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.650 
hands on the screen so you could
probably<00:02:45.830> play<00:02:46.370> with<00:02:46.790> interactions<00:02:47.450> that<00:02:47.600> are

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
probably play with interactions that are

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.190 
probably play with interactions that are
based<00:02:47.930> on<00:02:48.230> this<00:02:48.470> and<00:02:48.850> another<00:02:50.200> beautiful

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
based on this and another beautiful

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.640 
based on this and another beautiful
property<00:02:51.830> is<00:02:51.890> that<00:02:52.250> you<00:02:52.310> can<00:02:53.530> pretty<00:02:54.530> much

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
property is that you can pretty much

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.490 
property is that you can pretty much
track<00:02:55.070> an<00:02:55.220> arbitrary<00:02:55.760> amount<00:02:56.090> of<00:02:56.270> fingers<00:02:56.690> at

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
track an arbitrary amount of fingers at

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.260 
track an arbitrary amount of fingers at
the<00:02:57.860> same<00:02:57.890> time<00:02:58.490> because<00:02:58.730> there<00:02:59.060> are<00:02:59.150> no

00:02:59.260 --> 00:02:59.270 
the same time because there are no

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:02.380 
the same time because there are no
problems<00:02:59.570> with<00:03:00.050> occlusion<00:03:00.830> or<00:03:01.390> similar

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
problems with occlusion or similar

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:07.150 
problems with occlusion or similar
issues<00:03:03.460> so<00:03:04.460> if<00:03:04.550> you<00:03:04.670> turn<00:03:04.910> on<00:03:04.940> the<00:03:05.420> tracker<00:03:06.160> so

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
issues so if you turn on the tracker so

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.340 
issues so if you turn on the tracker so
I<00:03:07.520> can<00:03:07.880> see<00:03:08.060> that<00:03:08.330> all<00:03:08.480> my<00:03:08.510> fingers<00:03:09.020> are<00:03:09.140> track

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.350 
I can see that all my fingers are track

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:12.460 
I can see that all my fingers are track
nicely<00:03:09.890> and<00:03:10.040> I<00:03:10.130> can<00:03:10.370> do<00:03:10.880> gestures<00:03:11.420> and<00:03:11.690> stuff

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
nicely and I can do gestures and stuff

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.710 
nicely and I can do gestures and stuff
like<00:03:12.650> that<00:03:12.860> and<00:03:13.270> it's<00:03:14.270> also<00:03:14.450> pretty

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
like that and it's also pretty

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.229 
like that and it's also pretty
responsive<00:03:15.410> so<00:03:15.680> even<00:03:15.980> fast<00:03:16.430> just<00:03:16.790> just<00:03:17.060> like

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:17.239 
responsive so even fast just just like

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:21.070 
responsive so even fast just just like
double<00:03:17.690> taps<00:03:17.959> are<00:03:18.290> recognized<00:03:19.070> and<00:03:19.720> we<00:03:20.720> can

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:21.080 
double taps are recognized and we can

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:23.800 
double taps are recognized and we can
track<00:03:21.500> at<00:03:21.739> least<00:03:22.040> twenty<00:03:22.489> fingers<00:03:22.880> as<00:03:23.120> we<00:03:23.600> can

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
track at least twenty fingers as we can

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:30.410 
track at least twenty fingers as we can
demonstrate<00:03:24.070> here

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.800 

and<00:03:31.350> we<00:03:31.680> also<00:03:31.860> implemented<00:03:32.400> a<00:03:32.700> rudimentary<00:03:33.180> to

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
and we also implemented a rudimentary to

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.290 
and we also implemented a rudimentary to
your<00:03:33.990> output<00:03:34.280> functionality<00:03:35.280> which<00:03:36.150> is

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:36.300 
your output functionality which is

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.809 
your output functionality which is
already<00:03:36.630> working<00:03:36.840> and<00:03:37.400> this<00:03:38.400> is<00:03:38.520> just<00:03:38.700> a

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:38.819 
already working and this is just a

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:45.350 
already working and this is just a
simple<00:03:39.120> demonstration<00:03:39.810> of<00:03:39.900> it<00:03:44.209> looking<00:03:45.209> very

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 
simple demonstration of it looking very

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.580 
simple demonstration of it looking very
promising<00:03:45.720> and<00:03:46.350> will<00:03:47.220> keep<00:03:47.580> you<00:03:47.730> up<00:03:47.880> to<00:03:47.910> date

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.590 
promising and will keep you up to date

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:52.370 
promising and will keep you up to date
thanks<00:03:49.590> for<00:03:49.830> watching
