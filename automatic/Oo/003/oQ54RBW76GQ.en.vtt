00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:06.270
 but let's proceed to fille 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:10.590
 copies of those that we brought in the 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:12.929
 lagoon alsina last Sunday to here 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:16.650
 as we see the pieces are whole with 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:19.159
 scale and the only thing we're going to do is 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.060
 fillet what of both sides without 

00:00:19.159 --> 00:00:25.259
 download it or notify the previously 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:27.210
 this is a quick and simple method for 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:28.720
 not waste time or fill the whole house 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.750
 scale 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:33.460
 and do it much faster directly 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:35.920
 with a common knife and current 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.870
 kitchen of a well-known Brazilian brand 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:41.360
 that in all houses there are at least 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:43.250
 one something sharp 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:46.250
 the sharper you are the better 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:48.380
 we take with the wolf towards us and 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.240
 we make a decision is from school that 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:52.760
 We were going to the head of 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:54.980
 space to be heard and we are 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.720
 cut and we stumbled on a fin in 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:59.800
 this case we give our knife the 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:04.390
 we cut and continue 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:09.600
 and it is the same thing we do for the other 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:09.600
 we turn it side down 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.700
 on the backbone we are traveling in 

00:01:13.679 --> 00:01:19.759
 this case the tail the head 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.610
 until the steak is ready to 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:24.040
 the two finalists 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:27.510
 this these visors with the spine 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.510
 we let out in this same newspaper 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:33.550
 We separate the files and what we do is 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:37.260
 be cleaning was passing rag and 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:37.260
 generating inconveniences 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:43.429
 a bag and the problem is over 

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:45.229
 good we take one of the purposes landmarks here 

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:46.939
 we see that he is dirty he still has the 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:49.030
 thorns and of course the other side 

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:52.759
 has the skin with the scales 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:56.289
 we directly make a cut he quoted us 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:56.289
 we go below the thorns 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:02.850
 when we get down we cut with envelope 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.830
 the fin we make a clean cut 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.850
 and already on this side we do not have a single 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.520
 Thorn 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.590
 then what we do is a small cut 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.140
 of 45 degrees 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.680
 or on the skin that will allow us 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:18.970
 affirm it with a finger and with the knife 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:24.840
 go moving 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:24.840
 to quickly remove the skin 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.650
 some skates 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:32.590
 but gently 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:34.659
 and extreme speed file in perfect 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.540
 been this subsidiary the only thing that we have 

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:40.689
 What to do now is rinse it and it's 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:42.519
 ready to be consumed with the rinse 

00:02:40.689 --> 00:02:43.959
 it raised the scales any rest 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:46.439
 I may have blood of whatever 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:49.180
 but as we see we have a legal purpose 

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:52.310
 spectacular we are not going to do it 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:55.970
 again with others that we have here 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:58.450
 in this case we extract the same 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.450
 thorns 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.160
 a little cut 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.000
 we cut to that we are also 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.930
 the part of the fin so that later 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.079
 they lock us 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:14.599
 when escaping the best said to take the 

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:19.010
 skin and the same thing we do a cut exists 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:21.530
 an angle to 45 smoothly we make sure 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:24.200
 that we have space to sign it and 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:26.030
 I go quietly with the knife what 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.939
 we are moving up and towards 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:31.849
 down to achieve that without us being 

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:36.920
 skin cuts still containing the 

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:40.980
 scales we get all the meat and 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:44.430
 we can take advantage of the piece 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:46.590
 in its greater proportion not certain already 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:49.379
 we have the file on the leather side and the 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:53.390
 side of the viscera of course what 

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:56.430
 we pay is withdrawn where we take out as well as 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:04:02.330
 as we say with this what we are going to 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:02.330
 do also here we see previously already 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:09.580
 we know filleted other good now the 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:12.940
 same process will remove the skin with 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:15.610
 scales and everything is rinsed and in the case 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:17.940
 second and purposes have JARRAI 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:17.940
 ready
