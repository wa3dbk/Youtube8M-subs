the<00:00:17.730> focus<00:00:18.270> is<00:00:18.480> something<00:00:19.470> interesting

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
the focus is something interesting

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.510 
the focus is something interesting
because<00:00:20.550> usually<00:00:20.900> for<00:00:21.900> copper<00:00:22.320> coating<00:00:22.890> is

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:23.520 
because usually for copper coating is

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.600 
because usually for copper coating is
usually<00:00:23.940> using<00:00:24.360> reserve<00:00:24.869> or<00:00:25.439> as<00:00:25.980> a<00:00:26.040> stopper

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:26.610 
usually using reserve or as a stopper

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:28.070 
usually using reserve or as a stopper
sauce<00:00:26.970> the<00:00:27.210> circuit

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
sauce the circuit

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.359 
sauce the circuit
but<00:00:28.710> to<00:00:29.550> serve<00:00:29.820> as<00:00:30.090> a<00:00:30.150> co-writer<00:00:30.590> is<00:00:31.590> something

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
but to serve as a co-writer is something

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.670 
but to serve as a co-writer is something
interesting<00:00:32.610> and<00:00:33.210> then<00:00:33.510> you<00:00:34.080> have<00:00:34.260> a<00:00:34.470> hammer

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
interesting and then you have a hammer

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.610 
interesting and then you have a hammer
different<00:00:35.340> combination<00:00:36.180> with<00:00:36.900> a<00:00:36.930> chakra<00:00:37.350> and

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
different combination with a chakra and

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.549 
different combination with a chakra and
shakers<00:00:38.309> of<00:00:38.430> their<00:00:38.670> own<00:00:39.059> wine<00:00:39.300> marital<00:00:39.900> for<00:00:40.410> by

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
shakers of their own wine marital for by

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.640 
shakers of their own wine marital for by
itself<00:00:40.830> so<00:00:41.520> we<00:00:41.940> also<00:00:42.180> get<00:00:42.629> different<00:00:42.960> textures

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:43.650 
itself so we also get different textures

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.040 
itself so we also get different textures
also<00:00:44.010> they're<00:00:44.640> solving<00:00:45.239> a<00:00:45.390> design<00:00:45.690> in<00:00:45.900> this

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050
