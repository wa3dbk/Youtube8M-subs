00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850 
then he's going to be even more

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:28.460 
then he's going to be even more
surprised<00:04:27.270> when<00:04:27.360> he<00:04:27.479> sees<00:04:27.539> another<00:04:27.930> X<00:04:28.229> there

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:28.470 
surprised when he sees another X there

haven't seen this build a whole it was a

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.430 
haven't seen this build a whole it was a

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.440 
little bit late it's gonna be a quite

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:37.129 
little bit late it's gonna be a quite
some<00:04:34.680> time<00:04:34.889> before<00:04:35.610> there<00:04:36.180> are<00:04:36.450> any<00:04:36.660> links<00:04:37.020> out

some time before there are any links out

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:40.129 
some time before there are any links out
on<00:04:37.260> the<00:04:37.350> map<00:04:37.610> and<00:04:38.610> in<00:04:39.510> the<00:04:39.720> early<00:04:39.930> days<00:04:40.110> of

on the map and in the early days of

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:42.050 
on the map and in the early days of
heart<00:04:40.470> of<00:04:40.530> the<00:04:40.590> swarm<00:04:40.800> players<00:04:41.220> often<00:04:41.550> said

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 
heart of the swarm players often said

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:45.080 
heart of the swarm players often said
that<00:04:42.090> proxy<00:04:42.930> reaper<00:04:43.410> is<00:04:43.560> a<00:04:43.889> hard<00:04:44.340> counter<00:04:44.789> to

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.090 
that proxy reaper is a hard counter to

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:46.909 
that proxy reaper is a hard counter to
hatch<00:04:45.240> first<00:04:45.599> so<00:04:45.930> we'll<00:04:46.530> have<00:04:46.650> to<00:04:46.740> wait<00:04:46.830> and

00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:46.919 
hatch first so we'll have to wait and

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:48.440 
hatch first so we'll have to wait and
see<00:04:47.039> how<00:04:47.220> much<00:04:47.370> damage<00:04:47.610> that<00:04:47.849> this<00:04:48.000> Reaper<00:04:48.300> can

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:48.450 
see how much damage that this Reaper can

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:49.909 
see how much damage that this Reaper can
actually<00:04:48.690> do<00:04:48.840> he's<00:04:48.990> gotten<00:04:49.200> one<00:04:49.380> kill<00:04:49.590> already

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:49.919 
actually do he's gotten one kill already

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:51.830 
actually do he's gotten one kill already
but<00:04:50.220> I<00:04:50.280> think<00:04:50.460> that<00:04:50.610> that<00:04:50.639> goes<00:04:51.300> more<00:04:51.599> for

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:51.840 
but I think that that goes more for

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:53.779 
but I think that that goes more for
those<00:04:51.960> crazy<00:04:52.320> Reaper<00:04:53.039> bills<00:04:53.280> there<00:04:53.490> are<00:04:53.580> eight
