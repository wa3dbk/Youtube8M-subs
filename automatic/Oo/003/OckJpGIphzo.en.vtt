well<00:00:04.710> I'm<00:00:05.480> building<00:00:06.480> a<00:00:06.600> I<00:00:07.309> guess<00:00:08.309> a<00:00:08.340> tipping

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
well I'm building a I guess a tipping

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.690 
well I'm building a I guess a tipping
transport<00:00:09.750> box<00:00:10.099> for<00:00:11.099> the<00:00:11.160> three-point<00:00:11.580> hitch

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
transport box for the three-point hitch

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.230 
transport box for the three-point hitch
of<00:00:11.850> the<00:00:11.940> tractor<00:00:13.550> these<00:00:14.550> are<00:00:14.730> gonna<00:00:14.850> be<00:00:15.060> the

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
of the tractor these are gonna be the

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.460 
of the tractor these are gonna be the
lower<00:00:16.609> arms<00:00:17.609> I<00:00:17.789> suppose<00:00:18.060> you'll<00:00:19.019> get<00:00:19.289> a<00:00:19.320> better

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
lower arms I suppose you'll get a better

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.100 
lower arms I suppose you'll get a better
idea<00:00:19.590> after<00:00:20.010> I<00:00:20.220> get<00:00:20.340> going<00:00:20.700> here<00:00:20.880> but<00:00:21.810> I've

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:22.110 
idea after I get going here but I've

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:24.590 
idea after I get going here but I've
taken<00:00:22.350> the<00:00:22.560> team<00:00:22.710> mechanical<00:00:23.340> tubing<00:00:23.699> with<00:00:24.210> a

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
taken the team mechanical tubing with a

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.029 
taken the team mechanical tubing with a
three-quarter<00:00:25.170> inch<00:00:25.310> inside<00:00:26.310> diameter<00:00:26.580> and

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:28.039 
three-quarter inch inside diameter and

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:30.890 
three-quarter inch inside diameter and
I'm<00:00:29.039> gonna<00:00:29.190> mount<00:00:29.369> them<00:00:29.609> in<00:00:29.699> here<00:00:30.090> I'm<00:00:30.720> gonna

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
I'm gonna mount them in here I'm gonna

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.920 
I'm gonna mount them in here I'm gonna
take<00:00:31.140> a<00:00:31.170> die<00:00:31.500> grinder<00:00:31.830> and<00:00:32.449> make<00:00:33.449> these<00:00:33.629> fit<00:00:33.899> a

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
take a die grinder and make these fit a

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.829 
take a die grinder and make these fit a
little<00:00:34.079> better<00:00:34.289> straighter<00:00:35.250> anyways<00:00:35.839> and

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:36.839 
little better straighter anyways and

00:00:36.839 --> 00:01:49.620 
little better straighter anyways and
that's<00:00:36.989> my<00:00:37.140> pivot<00:00:37.440> point<00:00:37.679> for<00:00:37.859> my<00:00:37.949> box

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.890 

and<00:01:50.630> that's<00:01:51.230> what<00:01:51.440> those<00:01:51.590> holes<00:01:51.650> are<00:01:52.040> for

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:52.900 
and that's what those holes are for

00:01:52.900 --> 00:02:08.390 
and that's what those holes are for
these<00:01:53.900> are<00:01:54.050> the<00:01:54.140> lower<00:01:54.530> link<00:01:54.770> pins

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:08.400 

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.790 

well<00:02:09.400> that<00:02:09.760> gives<00:02:09.970> you<00:02:10.119> some<00:02:10.390> idea<00:02:10.750> of<00:02:10.810> the

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
well that gives you some idea of the

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.680 
well that gives you some idea of the
shape<00:02:12.040> of<00:02:12.190> the<00:02:12.310> thing<00:02:12.550> you<00:02:13.330> can<00:02:13.450> see<00:02:13.600> the

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
shape of the thing you can see the

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.070 
shape of the thing you can see the
bushings<00:02:14.080> in<00:02:14.230> the<00:02:14.350> far<00:02:14.740> end<00:02:14.950> there<00:02:15.250> and<00:02:15.490> the

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
bushings in the far end there and the

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.480 
bushings in the far end there and the
pins<00:02:17.080> for<00:02:17.440> the<00:02:17.500> lower<00:02:17.680> links<00:02:18.640> front<00:02:19.510> end

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
pins for the lower links front end

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:27.540 
pins for the lower links front end
anyways<00:02:22.110> that's<00:02:23.110> it<00:02:25.560> this<00:02:26.560> is<00:02:26.620> a<00:02:26.800> carbide

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
anyways that's it this is a carbide

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:30.090 
anyways that's it this is a carbide
toothed<00:02:27.930> cutting<00:02:28.930> blade<00:02:29.170> as<00:02:29.560> opposed<00:02:29.950> to<00:02:30.010> a

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
toothed cutting blade as opposed to a

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:49.990 
toothed cutting blade as opposed to a
friction<00:02:30.430> blade<00:02:30.640> quite<00:02:31.480> effective

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:03:36.090 

that's<00:02:51.000> true<00:02:51.180> like<00:02:51.390> butter

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.100 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.980 

okay<00:03:37.100> well<00:03:37.340> since<00:03:38.270> this<00:03:38.390> is<00:03:38.570> a<00:03:38.600> pivot<00:03:38.960> point

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:38.990 
okay well since this is a pivot point

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:43.090 
okay well since this is a pivot point
I'm<00:03:39.470> using<00:03:39.740> a<00:03:39.770> 3/4<00:03:40.340> inch<00:03:40.870> great<00:03:41.870> 8<00:03:42.050> bolt<00:03:42.320> this

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:43.100 
I'm using a 3/4 inch great 8 bolt this

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:47.020 
I'm using a 3/4 inch great 8 bolt this
is<00:03:43.280> really<00:03:43.580> hard<00:03:43.820> and<00:03:45.280> it's<00:03:46.280> in<00:03:46.400> that<00:03:46.430> bushing

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.030 
is really hard and it's in that bushing

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.450 
is really hard and it's in that bushing
that<00:03:47.270> mechanical<00:03:48.110> tubing<00:03:48.440> just<00:03:48.620> to

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:49.460 
that mechanical tubing just to

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:52.230 
that mechanical tubing just to
strengthen<00:03:49.970> up<00:03:50.060> this<00:03:50.240> piece<00:03:50.480> of<00:03:50.630> pipe<00:03:50.810> and

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:52.240 
strengthen up this piece of pipe and

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:55.270 
strengthen up this piece of pipe and
I'll<00:03:53.240> also<00:03:53.420> put<00:03:53.750> the<00:03:53.930> smooth<00:03:54.440> end<00:03:54.740> of<00:03:54.980> the<00:03:55.070> bolt

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.280 
I'll also put the smooth end of the bolt

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.460 
I'll also put the smooth end of the bolt
on<00:03:55.520> this<00:03:56.120> end<00:03:56.360> because<00:03:56.690> that<00:03:56.720> is<00:03:57.020> where<00:03:57.320> my

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470 
on this end because that is where my

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:00.550 
on this end because that is where my
piece<00:03:58.220> of<00:03:58.340> angle<00:03:58.430> iron<00:03:58.610> will<00:03:58.820> pivot<00:03:59.180> and<00:03:59.560> the

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 
piece of angle iron will pivot and the

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.680 
piece of angle iron will pivot and the
threads<00:04:00.890> on<00:04:01.100> that<00:04:01.280> end<00:04:01.520> would<00:04:01.760> wear<00:04:01.970> faster<00:04:02.270> if

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:02.690 
threads on that end would wear faster if

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:06.420 
threads on that end would wear faster if
they<00:04:02.870> were<00:04:02.930> over<00:04:03.140> here

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:06.430 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:08.880 

okay<00:04:07.430> so<00:04:07.490> I've<00:04:08.030> made<00:04:08.150> a<00:04:08.210> little<00:04:08.390> more<00:04:08.600> progress

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:08.890 
okay so I've made a little more progress

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:13.240 
okay so I've made a little more progress
got<00:04:09.890> a<00:04:09.920> handle<00:04:10.280> on<00:04:10.340> the<00:04:10.430> side<00:04:10.960> and<00:04:11.960> this<00:04:12.920> is<00:04:13.100> the

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.250 
got a handle on the side and this is the

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:16.780 
got a handle on the side and this is the
latch<00:04:13.460> mechanism<00:04:13.730> I<00:04:14.180> came<00:04:14.390> up<00:04:14.510> with<00:04:15.580> no<00:04:16.580> know

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:16.790 
latch mechanism I came up with no know

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:19.570 
latch mechanism I came up with no know
if<00:04:16.940> you<00:04:17.320> tell<00:04:18.320> how<00:04:18.560> that<00:04:18.770> works<00:04:19.010> or<00:04:19.220> not<00:04:19.340> maybe

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:19.580 
if you tell how that works or not maybe

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:23.230 
if you tell how that works or not maybe
I'll<00:04:19.790> try<00:04:20.030> and<00:04:20.180> do<00:04:20.330> it<00:04:20.480> for<00:04:20.720> you<00:04:21.940> so<00:04:22.940> that's<00:04:23.030> the

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.240 
I'll try and do it for you so that's the

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:27.870 
I'll try and do it for you so that's the
arm<00:04:23.660> you<00:04:24.650> lift<00:04:24.860> up<00:04:24.980> on<00:04:25.190> the<00:04:25.280> arm<00:04:25.580> like<00:04:25.730> that

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:27.880 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.280 

there's<00:04:28.880> two<00:04:29.000> little<00:04:29.300> camming<00:04:29.840> things<00:04:30.080> in

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:30.290 
there's two little camming things in

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:35.560 
there's two little camming things in
there<00:04:30.500> and<00:04:31.130> if<00:04:31.250> you<00:04:31.340> pull<00:04:32.650> it<00:04:33.650> pushes<00:04:34.040> up<00:04:34.570> on

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:35.570 
there and if you pull it pushes up on

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:38.650 
there and if you pull it pushes up on
this<00:04:35.840> thing

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:38.660 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:49.270 

oh<00:04:45.850> yeah<00:04:46.850> pull<00:04:47.180> up<00:04:47.210> on<00:04:47.510> this<00:04:47.720> or<00:04:47.990> be<00:04:48.110> a<00:04:48.140> rope<00:04:49.040> on

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:49.280 
oh yeah pull up on this or be a rope on

00:04:49.280 --> 00:05:02.110 
oh yeah pull up on this or be a rope on
there<00:04:50.920> it<00:04:51.920> dumps<00:04:59.860> okay<00:05:00.860> so<00:05:01.220> I'm<00:05:01.460> just<00:05:01.490> cleaning

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:02.120 
there it dumps okay so I'm just cleaning

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.810 
there it dumps okay so I'm just cleaning
up<00:05:02.180> my<00:05:02.330> welts<00:05:02.720> and<00:05:03.460> one<00:05:04.460> of<00:05:04.520> the<00:05:04.580> things<00:05:04.730> that

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:04.820 
up my welts and one of the things that

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:09.430 
up my welts and one of the things that
drives<00:05:05.000> me<00:05:05.120> nuts<00:05:07.390> that's<00:05:08.390> spatter<00:05:08.780> so<00:05:09.260> clean

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:09.440 
drives me nuts that's spatter so clean

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:17.530 
drives me nuts that's spatter so clean
that<00:05:09.470> up<00:05:14.410> all<00:05:15.410> right<00:05:15.650> that's<00:05:15.890> my<00:05:16.540> tipping

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:17.540 
that up all right that's my tipping

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:20.970 
that up all right that's my tipping
transport<00:05:18.080> box<00:05:18.320> from<00:05:18.590> I<00:05:18.650> carry<00:05:18.950> all<00:05:19.190> I<00:05:19.810> put

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:20.980 
transport box from I carry all I put

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:23.350 
transport box from I carry all I put
tie-downs<00:05:21.980> all<00:05:22.220> around<00:05:22.520> it<00:05:22.700> in<00:05:22.910> case<00:05:23.090> I<00:05:23.180> wanted

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:23.360 
tie-downs all around it in case I wanted

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:27.010 
tie-downs all around it in case I wanted
to<00:05:23.480> tie<00:05:23.630> something<00:05:23.870> in<00:05:24.940> it<00:05:25.940> is<00:05:26.150> weighted<00:05:26.720> so

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:27.020 
to tie something in it is weighted so

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:30.310 
to tie something in it is weighted so
that<00:05:27.200> it's<00:05:27.770> pretty<00:05:28.100> much<00:05:28.310> neutral<00:05:28.610> weight<00:05:29.320> the

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:30.320 
that it's pretty much neutral weight the

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:32.950 
that it's pretty much neutral weight the
pivot<00:05:30.590> point<00:05:30.860> is<00:05:31.010> a<00:05:31.480> little<00:05:32.480> closer<00:05:32.660> to<00:05:32.810> the

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:32.960 
pivot point is a little closer to the

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:37.950 
pivot point is a little closer to the
front<00:05:33.170> than<00:05:33.320> the<00:05:33.410> back

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:37.960 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:39.840 

I<00:05:38.020> don't<00:05:38.830> know<00:05:38.889> what<00:05:39.039> else<00:05:39.160> I<00:05:39.340> can<00:05:39.400> tell<00:05:39.699> you

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:39.850 
I don't know what else I can tell you

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:44.480 
I don't know what else I can tell you
I'll<00:05:40.479> just<00:05:40.720> show<00:05:40.900> you<00:05:40.930> how<00:05:41.110> it<00:05:41.199> works

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:44.490 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:47.790 

now<00:05:45.490> the<00:05:45.550> paint<00:05:45.850> is<00:05:46.060> holding<00:05:46.630> the<00:05:46.840> latch<00:05:47.500> up<00:05:47.770> a

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:47.800 
now the paint is holding the latch up a

00:05:47.800 --> 00:06:04.219 
now the paint is holding the latch up a
little<00:05:48.039> bit<00:05:48.280> but<00:05:49.060> once<00:05:49.150> it<00:05:49.300> wears<00:05:49.449> in<00:05:49.720> metal

00:06:04.219 --> 00:06:04.229 

00:06:04.229 --> 00:06:07.919 

that's<00:06:05.229> all<00:06:05.410> there<00:06:05.560> is<00:06:05.650> to<00:06:05.770> it
