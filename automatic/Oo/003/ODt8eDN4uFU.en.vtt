Welcome to "3 Minute Boxing" this is "Tips to Improve Your Guard"

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:12.289
let's begin with the first one

00:00:12.289 --> 00:00:16.049
It's important to know when to put your hands up to protect your head,

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.519
when to put your hands lower to protect your body

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:20.210
when to close your guard

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.840
to protect your face, when to close down your elbows

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.039
to protect your lower body

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:29.039
but all that you'll find out when you start figuring out your opponent

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:29.699
like when you

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.489
start noticing what type of punches he/she throws more often, what movements he/she does,

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:39.070
if he/she is a stylist or a puncher. All of that will help you figure out

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.430
what kind of opponent you have in front of you to know

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:47.220
when it's the best time to 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:49.190
close down your guard

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:51.640
or what is that you might have to do.

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.330
What I'm trying to say is that your guard

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:56.210
never stays in one position

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.850
all the time. You don't go in there to box like this

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.150
and from here you throw all you punches and you're protected all the time, no

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.360
it always changes, sometimes you close it,

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.350
sometimes you bring it up a bit

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:10.770
it all depends, depends on the situation.

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.360
Sometimes we lower our hands when throwing punches or doing certain movements

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.000
for example, when we throw the straing right

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:24.000
we lower our left hand without knowing sometimes. The same happens when we throw the Jab, sometimes we lower our right hand.

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:30.110
also when we move to the sides bobbing and weaving

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:31.750
dodging punches.

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:37.020
To fix this, we need to do the following.

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.350
Steal a bit of yarn from your grandma' or you mom and cut a small piece

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.080
grab the piece of yarn and place it behind your finger

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:46.680
go around it

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.710
make a fist and the left over piece, you bite it with your back teeth, as close as possible

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:53.030
to your body

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.850
this is going to help you keep your guard up at all times

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:02.850
when your doing other movements.

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:22.989
Use two pieces of yarn when working on bobbing and weaving.

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:27.779
If you don't want to use yarn, what you can do is

00:02:27.779 --> 00:02:29.039
grab your ear.

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:32.829
with this part of your finger and your thumb, you grab your ear

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:37.889
throw the Jab and when you bring it back, you grab your ear again

00:02:37.889 --> 00:02:39.719
you can grab your ear right here

00:02:39.719 --> 00:02:46.719
and throw the Jab

00:02:52.389 --> 00:02:56.109
That technique will be easier for those of you that have big ears like me :)

00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:58.379
Remeber, the "Yarn Technique"

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:02.069
and the one where you touch your ear it's only to help you keep your hands up.

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:05.839
You're not always going to keep your guard up like this and leave your face open, you have to

00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:10.439
protect yourself like this too when they throw punches at you face obviously, but the point of those

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:14.329
techniques is only to keep your hands up and to not lower them

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:16.779
when throwing a punch

00:03:16.779 --> 00:03:18.379
or when moving side to side (bobbing)

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:19.140
and when weaving.
