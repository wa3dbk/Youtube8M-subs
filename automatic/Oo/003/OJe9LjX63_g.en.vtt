00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:26.900
 Hello guys 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:30.169
 the subject that we will now address is a theme 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:34.090
 very controversial company may require the 

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:36.260
 sind attested if that code 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.190
 usually related to a 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.920
 disease 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:43.129
 can the employer require that the 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:46.879
 medical certificate taken by the employee 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:48.110
 has this number is related to 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:51.470
 some disease 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:54.650
 well before that it is good that 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:57.890
 Let's ask the company can question the 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:01:00.890
 medical certificate brought by the employee 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:03.879
 Does the company have this competence 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:08.740
 the answer legally speaking is thus 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:11.270
 says article 60, paragraph 4 of the law 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:14.390
 8.213 91 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:17.900
 the company that has a medical service 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:20.259
 own agreement will be in charge of the 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:22.520
 medical examination and the payment of absences 

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:23.960
 corresponding to the period referred to in 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.960
 third paragraph 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.070
 this period are the first 15 days of 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.440
 removal 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.440
 they should only refer the insured to 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:35.720
 social security medical expertise 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.770
 when the disability exceeds 15 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.100
 days 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.570
 this law says the following medical service 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:45.860
 of the company 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:48.440
 he has the competence to evaluate the 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:51.760
 employee together with certificate that 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:55.550
 he brings and agrees with this certificate 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:58.250
 or even disagree 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:01.909
 is in that sense that it will 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:05.060
 appear number 10 of the board 2012 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:08.060
 federal medicine says the competent 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:10.220
 opinion the work doctor may 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:13.040
 disagree with medical certification terms 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:16.159
 issued by another doctor since 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:18.739
 justify this disagreement after the 

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:20.870
 due medical examination of the worker 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:23.180
 assuming responsibility for the 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:26.569
 consequences of their actions 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:29.480
 ie the year's work doctor 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:33.409
 requested a certificate brought by the employee 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:38.209
 for 30 days after the exam 

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:41.060
 done on the worker he can conclude 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:44.540
 according to what he knows of 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:47.510
 medical technician that that employer in the 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:50.750
 a job that is also known 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:53.239
 The doctor does not have to stay away for 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.989
 example 30 days can take a while 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:56.599
 smaller 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:58.669
 let's imagine he speaks not 30 days 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:03.290
 You're not going to stay, but I'll give it to you. 

00:02:58.669 --> 00:03:05.780
 15 days of removal if you do so 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.849
 company doctor the work doctor 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.650
 he is also assuming the 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:12.379
 consequences of this act 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:15.290
 often when the situation occurs 

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:18.409
 doctor asks for a reassessment of the 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:21.139
 same employee at the end of the 

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:24.650
 that he himself proposes to give 

00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:28.219
 more security in their conduct but the fact 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:29.989
 is legally the company can disagree if 

00:03:28.219 --> 00:03:32.689
 fine 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:35.629
 can the company then require that 

00:03:32.689 --> 00:03:39.009
 the medical certificate taken by the employee 

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:42.859
 have the disease code have sim 

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:45.590
 our understanding is not correct 

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:47.989
 the company is requiring the employee 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:51.560
 open your privacy 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:54.439
 to the extent that it places open 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:56.359
 the disease that has our 

00:03:54.439 --> 00:03:57.849
 understanding is that this should not 

00:03:56.359 --> 00:04:00.739
 even for reasons of 

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:04.340
 constitutional provisions for the 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:06.290
 intimacy and with the doctor 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:09.889
 let's imagine that the employee himself 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:10.969
 I told him, look, you 're going to give me a 

00:04:09.889 --> 00:04:13.189
 attestation 

00:04:10.969 --> 00:04:16.219
 I need to put the receiver 

00:04:13.189 --> 00:04:20.409
 attested because without this company's 

00:04:16.219 --> 00:04:24.349
 will not accept what the posture should be 

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:27.590
 of the doctor in the face of a situation 

00:04:24.349 --> 00:04:30.409
 good as doctors they are undergoing 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:35.120
 resolutions of the Federal Council of 

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:37.820
 medicine and says resolution 658 of 2002 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:38.969
 Article 5, doctors may only 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:41.369
 to provide 

00:04:38.969 --> 00:04:43.799
 all with coded diagnosis or not 

00:04:41.369 --> 00:04:46.289
 when for just cause the exercise of 

00:04:43.799 --> 00:04:49.199
 legal duty to request one's own 

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:52.919
 patient or legal representative and 

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:55.139
 in the case of the request for 

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:57.779
 quantified diagnosis placement 

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:59.849
 not be made by the patient or 

00:04:57.779 --> 00:05:03.449
 your legal representative 

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:07.409
 this agreement should be expressed 

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:11.029
 in the certificate itself, ie when there is 

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:14.969
 Employee request 

00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:17.519
 this employee then has the right to 

00:05:14.969 --> 00:05:20.339
 have your certificate on the site 

00:05:17.519 --> 00:05:23.189
 corresponding to the disease code 

00:05:20.339 --> 00:05:26.219
 if the request was made by him and 

00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:28.979
 this request this agreement 

00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:31.469
 is expressed in the state itself 

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:34.499
 a stature of the employee agreeing 

00:05:31.469 --> 00:05:38.219
 with the disclosure of the disease code 

00:05:34.499 --> 00:05:41.849
 there is no medical infraction for the doctor 

00:05:38.219 --> 00:05:44.729
 Okay now some may say but the 

00:05:41.849 --> 00:05:47.399
 doctor is coercing this 

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:49.919
 maid put the Indians on the certificate 

00:05:47.399 --> 00:05:52.469
 our understanding is that not the doctor 

00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:54.149
 will ask him do you want the 

00:05:52.469 --> 00:05:56.459
 Indians are placed 

00:05:54.149 --> 00:06:00.449
 maybe the employee himself disgusted by 

00:05:56.459 --> 00:06:03.209
 Please, put this on, I do not 

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:06.809
 receive those days expressed in the certificate 

00:06:03.209 --> 00:06:10.110
 then it is an employee decision now 

00:06:06.809 --> 00:06:12.479
 if there is any coercion to make it 

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:15.149
 there is not a doctor who is doing this 

00:06:12.479 --> 00:06:17.489
 equation is being made by the company and 

00:06:15.149 --> 00:06:21.479
 with respect to the company the doctor has not 

00:06:17.489 --> 00:06:22.979
 by itself the autonomy of making the company 

00:06:21.479 --> 00:06:24.959
 change of course 

00:06:22.979 --> 00:06:27.449
 This is a question for other actors 

00:06:24.959 --> 00:06:29.819
 public ministry of self- employment 

00:06:27.449 --> 00:06:32.429
 ministry of labor what the doctor 

00:06:29.819 --> 00:06:34.469
 have to guard is the secrecy of the 

00:06:32.429 --> 00:06:37.169
 employee patient 

00:06:34.469 --> 00:06:40.619
 if the employee himself asks for 

00:06:37.169 --> 00:06:42.149
 this secrecy is opened by virtue of 

00:06:40.619 --> 00:06:45.019
 personal interests 

00:06:42.149 --> 00:06:46.799
 the doctor can not go against the will 

00:06:45.019 --> 00:06:50.009
 of that employee 

00:06:46.799 --> 00:06:50.420
 this is our understanding on 10 

00:06:50.009 --> 00:06:54.590
 August 

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:55.760
 2012 in the light of the legislation 

00:06:54.590 --> 00:07:00.490
 we have today 

00:06:55.760 --> 00:07:00.490
 thank you until the next champions
