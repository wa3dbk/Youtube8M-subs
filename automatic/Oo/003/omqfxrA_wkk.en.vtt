millimeter cine lens world and this is

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.410 
millimeter cine lens world and this is
well<00:00:14.250> this<00:00:14.400> is<00:00:14.490> one<00:00:14.639> of<00:00:14.670> them<00:00:14.849> a<00:00:14.940> brand-new<00:00:15.240> one

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
well this is one of them a brand-new one

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.279 
well this is one of them a brand-new one
from<00:00:15.750> Zeiss<00:00:16.230> this<00:00:16.590> is<00:00:16.769> a<00:00:16.970> macro<00:00:17.970> 50<00:00:18.840> millimeter

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
from Zeiss this is a macro 50 millimeter

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.250 
from Zeiss this is a macro 50 millimeter
it's<00:00:19.590> a<00:00:19.680> compact<00:00:20.070> Prime<00:00:20.400> 2<00:00:21.050> they<00:00:22.050> are

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
it's a compact Prime 2 they are

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.680 
it's a compact Prime 2 they are
available<00:00:22.949> in<00:00:23.130> PL<00:00:23.850> mount<00:00:24.060> and<00:00:24.300> then

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:24.690 
available in PL mount and then

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:28.700 
available in PL mount and then
switchable<00:00:25.410> to<00:00:25.890> being<00:00:26.190> a<00:00:26.990> canon<00:00:27.990> eos<00:00:28.320> mount<00:00:28.560> so

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
switchable to being a canon eos mount so

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.439 
switchable to being a canon eos mount so
you<00:00:28.740> can<00:00:28.920> use<00:00:29.039> this<00:00:29.189> on<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:29.699> Canon<00:00:30.240> 5d

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
you can use this on the Canon 5d

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.779 
you can use this on the Canon 5d
actually<00:00:31.019> covers<00:00:31.470> the<00:00:31.500> full<00:00:31.920> sense<00:00:32.309> area<00:00:32.609> of

00:00:32.779 --> 00:00:32.789 
actually covers the full sense area of

00:00:32.789 --> 00:00:34.549 
actually covers the full sense area of
the<00:00:32.940> Canon<00:00:33.239> 5d<00:00:33.359> it's<00:00:33.750> meant<00:00:33.960> for<00:00:34.110> that<00:00:34.170> format

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
the Canon 5d it's meant for that format

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.700 
the Canon 5d it's meant for that format
so<00:00:35.489> it's<00:00:36.180> at<00:00:36.239> e<00:00:36.420> 2.1<00:00:36.840> lens<00:00:37.140> by<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.350> way<00:00:37.500> and

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
so it's at e 2.1 lens by the way and

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.709 
so it's at e 2.1 lens by the way and
what<00:00:38.460> does<00:00:38.550> it<00:00:38.670> mean<00:00:38.850> to<00:00:39.030> be<00:00:39.120> a<00:00:39.149> macro<00:00:39.510> first

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
what does it mean to be a macro first

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:40.970 
what does it mean to be a macro first
off<00:00:39.809> you<00:00:40.140> look<00:00:40.260> at<00:00:40.380> this<00:00:40.469> thing<00:00:40.620> it's<00:00:40.739> hard<00:00:40.800> to

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
off you look at this thing it's hard to

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.380 
off you look at this thing it's hard to
call<00:00:41.100> it<00:00:41.160> a<00:00:41.280> compact<00:00:41.610> prime<00:00:41.820> because<00:00:42.030> it's<00:00:42.149> a

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
call it a compact prime because it's a

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.180 
call it a compact prime because it's a
pretty<00:00:42.570> sizable<00:00:43.020> hunk<00:00:43.320> of<00:00:43.440> a<00:00:43.500> hunk<00:00:44.130> of

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
pretty sizable hunk of a hunk of

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.830 
pretty sizable hunk of a hunk of
equipment<00:00:44.579> here<00:00:44.730> and<00:00:44.910> imagine<00:00:45.510> if<00:00:45.600> you<00:00:45.690> just

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
equipment here and imagine if you just

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.540 
equipment here and imagine if you just
look<00:00:46.050> at<00:00:46.140> from<00:00:46.320> this<00:00:46.440> point<00:00:46.710> down<00:00:46.980> if<00:00:47.250> you<00:00:47.370> just

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
look at from this point down if you just

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.160 
look at from this point down if you just
took<00:00:47.700> that<00:00:47.850> away<00:00:48.000> that's<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.719> size<00:00:48.930> of<00:00:49.079> all

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
took that away that's the size of all

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.229 
took that away that's the size of all
the<00:00:49.260> other<00:00:49.550> compact<00:00:50.550> primes<00:00:50.820> and<00:00:51.059> that's

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
the other compact primes and that's

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.150 
the other compact primes and that's
because<00:00:51.629> to<00:00:51.899> be<00:00:52.020> a<00:00:52.050> macro<00:00:52.500> it<00:00:52.680> has<00:00:52.829> to<00:00:52.980> have

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
because to be a macro it has to have

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.889 
because to be a macro it has to have
this<00:00:53.340> interior<00:00:53.969> part<00:00:54.270> that<00:00:54.480> kind<00:00:54.600> of<00:00:54.750> goes

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
this interior part that kind of goes

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.020 
this interior part that kind of goes
back<00:00:54.930> and<00:00:55.440> forth<00:00:55.800> here<00:00:56.070> and<00:00:56.219> it<00:00:56.280> just<00:00:56.309> needed<00:00:56.910> a

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
back and forth here and it just needed a

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.020 
back and forth here and it just needed a
lot<00:00:57.149> of<00:00:57.270> housing<00:00:57.719> to<00:00:58.070> protect<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.190> lens<00:00:59.399> but

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
lot of housing to protect the lens but

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.600 
lot of housing to protect the lens but
it's<00:01:00.410> looks<00:01:01.410> can<00:01:01.620> be<00:01:01.649> deceiving<00:01:01.980> because<00:01:02.219> it

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:02.610 
it's looks can be deceiving because it

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:03.830 
it's looks can be deceiving because it
looks<00:01:02.820> like<00:01:02.940> this<00:01:03.090> massive<00:01:03.449> thing<00:01:03.480> but<00:01:03.780> you

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
looks like this massive thing but you

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.329 
looks like this massive thing but you
see<00:01:03.989> I'm<00:01:04.140> holding<00:01:04.350> it<00:01:04.680> I<00:01:04.799> mean<00:01:04.949> all<00:01:05.159> the

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
see I'm holding it I mean all the

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:06.529 
see I'm holding it I mean all the
compact<00:01:05.700> Prime's<00:01:05.939> are<00:01:06.119> extremely

00:01:06.529 --> 00:01:06.539 
compact Prime's are extremely

00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:07.999 
compact Prime's are extremely
lightweight<00:01:06.749> and<00:01:06.959> in<00:01:07.229> fact<00:01:07.380> here<00:01:07.679> as<00:01:07.770> an<00:01:07.889> old

00:01:07.999 --> 00:01:08.009 
lightweight and in fact here as an old

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:12.289 
lightweight and in fact here as an old
design<00:01:08.429> super<00:01:09.329> speed<00:01:09.539> lens<00:01:10.069> they<00:01:11.069> are<00:01:11.299> great

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
design super speed lens they are great

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:13.489 
design super speed lens they are great
big<00:01:12.479> difference<00:01:12.749> in<00:01:12.840> size<00:01:13.020> but<00:01:13.259> they<00:01:13.380> almost

00:01:13.489 --> 00:01:13.499 
big difference in size but they almost

00:01:13.499 --> 00:01:15.019 
big difference in size but they almost
they<00:01:13.770> weigh<00:01:13.889> almost<00:01:14.100> identical<00:01:14.700> I<00:01:14.789> mean<00:01:14.939> I

00:01:15.019 --> 00:01:15.029 
they weigh almost identical I mean I

00:01:15.029 --> 00:01:17.089 
they weigh almost identical I mean I
think<00:01:15.479> this<00:01:15.659> one's<00:01:15.869> done<00:01:16.170> harab<00:01:16.590> lighter<00:01:16.829> it's

00:01:17.089 --> 00:01:17.099 
think this one's done harab lighter it's

00:01:17.099 --> 00:01:18.529 
think this one's done harab lighter it's
really<00:01:17.429> pretty<00:01:17.819> much<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.060> exact<00:01:18.329> same<00:01:18.359> thing

00:01:18.529 --> 00:01:18.539 
really pretty much the exact same thing

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:21.410 
really pretty much the exact same thing
but<00:01:18.959> what<00:01:19.709> does<00:01:19.829> it<00:01:19.859> mean<00:01:20.579> to<00:01:20.759> be<00:01:20.849> a<00:01:20.880> macro<00:01:21.240> what

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
but what does it mean to be a macro what

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.629 
but what does it mean to be a macro what
does<00:01:21.509> that<00:01:21.539> get<00:01:21.810> me<00:01:21.840> well<00:01:22.289> I<00:01:22.560> have<00:01:23.219> an<00:01:23.340> area

00:01:23.629 --> 00:01:23.639 
does that get me well I have an area

00:01:23.639 --> 00:01:26.629 
does that get me well I have an area
directors<00:01:24.270> of<00:01:24.389> you<00:01:24.479> finder<00:01:24.810> I<00:01:25.170> can<00:01:25.439> just<00:01:25.639> pop

00:01:26.629 --> 00:01:26.639 
directors of you finder I can just pop

00:01:26.639 --> 00:01:29.480 
directors of you finder I can just pop
this<00:01:26.819> on<00:01:27.619> just<00:01:28.619> so<00:01:28.799> I<00:01:28.829> can<00:01:28.950> take<00:01:29.159> a<00:01:29.219> look

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
this on just so I can take a look

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.539 
this on just so I can take a look
through<00:01:30.419> it<00:01:30.659> and<00:01:30.929> I'm<00:01:31.679> just<00:01:31.859> gonna<00:01:31.979> put<00:01:32.249> it<00:01:32.369> at

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
through it and I'm just gonna put it at

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.999 
through it and I'm just gonna put it at
its<00:01:32.729> closest<00:01:33.149> focus<00:01:33.509> which<00:01:33.689> is<00:01:33.719> a<00:01:34.109> good<00:01:34.799> chunk

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
its closest focus which is a good chunk

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.289 
its closest focus which is a good chunk
below<00:01:35.399> 10<00:01:35.880> inches<00:01:36.270> actually<00:01:36.779> and<00:01:37.819> close<00:01:38.819> focus

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.629 
below 10 inches actually and close focus
take<00:01:39.509> my<00:01:39.630> thumb<00:01:39.869> here<00:01:40.109> close<00:01:40.859> focus<00:01:41.279> is<00:01:41.429> right

00:01:41.629 --> 00:01:41.639 
take my thumb here close focus is right

00:01:41.639 --> 00:01:44.479 
take my thumb here close focus is right
there<00:01:42.299> that<00:01:43.169> is<00:01:43.469> how<00:01:43.709> close<00:01:43.979> in<00:01:44.159> front<00:01:44.369> of<00:01:44.429> the

00:02:00.529 --> 00:02:00.539 
know what a macro is going to get me

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:04.760

down the scale and what that means is

when I'm at the one to two ratio say my

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.550 
when I'm at the one to two ratio say my
thumb<00:02:27.610> was<00:02:27.819> an<00:02:28.030> inch<00:02:28.300> wide<00:02:28.810> it's<00:02:29.110> not<00:02:29.290> flow

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
thumb was an inch wide it's not flow

thumb was an inch wide it's not flow
smaller<00:02:29.860> than<00:02:30.099> but<00:02:30.520> if<00:02:30.819> my<00:02:30.970> thumb<00:02:31.180> was<00:02:31.360> an<00:02:31.450> inch

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.690 
smaller than but if my thumb was an inch
wide<00:02:31.900> and<00:02:32.110> I<00:02:32.319> held<00:02:32.590> it<00:02:32.650> at<00:02:32.769> that<00:02:32.920> close<00:02:33.250> focus

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
wide and I held it at that close focus

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.240 
wide and I held it at that close focus
the<00:02:33.940> one<00:02:34.239> to<00:02:34.330> two<00:02:34.450> ratio<00:02:34.599> focus<00:02:35.200> point<00:02:35.440> then

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
the one to two ratio focus point then

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.900 
the one to two ratio focus point then
the<00:02:36.550> image<00:02:36.970> projected<00:02:37.630> onto<00:02:37.840> the<00:02:38.080> sensor<00:02:38.620> and

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
the image projected onto the sensor and

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.309 
the image projected onto the sensor and
the<00:02:39.910> lens<00:02:40.120> has<00:02:40.269> no<00:02:40.390> idea<00:02:40.630> what's<00:02:40.750> behind<00:02:40.870> here

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319 
the lens has no idea what's behind here

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:43.770 
the lens has no idea what's behind here
it's<00:02:41.830> just<00:02:42.010> what<00:02:42.280> size<00:02:42.760> it's<00:02:43.150> projecting<00:02:43.660> the

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
it's just what size it's projecting the

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.420 
it's just what size it's projecting the
image<00:02:43.810> projected<00:02:44.530> onto<00:02:44.709> the<00:02:44.860> spot<00:02:45.220> where

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
image projected onto the spot where

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.160 
image projected onto the spot where
things<00:02:45.730> are<00:02:45.819> going<00:02:45.910> to<00:02:45.970> come<00:02:46.120> in<00:02:46.209> focus<00:02:46.540> would

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
things are going to come in focus would

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:51.059 
things are going to come in focus would
be<00:02:47.230> half<00:02:48.069> an<00:02:48.250> inch<00:02:48.400> one<00:02:49.330> to<00:02:49.690> divide<00:02:50.530> it<00:02:50.709> by<00:02:51.010> two

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:51.069 
be half an inch one to divide it by two

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:53.910 
be half an inch one to divide it by two
one<00:02:51.580> to<00:02:51.790> two<00:02:52.030> ratio<00:02:52.810> so<00:02:53.230> if<00:02:53.319> it<00:02:53.410> was<00:02:53.530> at<00:02:53.650> the<00:02:53.739> one

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
one to two ratio so if it was at the one

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.500 
one to two ratio so if it was at the one
to<00:02:54.040> three<00:02:54.250> point<00:02:54.519> which<00:02:54.640> is<00:02:54.760> about<00:02:54.940> back<00:02:55.239> here

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
to three point which is about back here

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:58.559 
to three point which is about back here
a<00:02:55.540> little<00:02:55.690> then<00:02:56.410> it<00:02:57.069> would<00:02:57.250> be<00:02:57.459> 1/3<00:02:58.120> of<00:02:58.269> an<00:02:58.420> inch

00:02:58.559 --> 00:02:58.569 
a little then it would be 1/3 of an inch

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:00.479 
a little then it would be 1/3 of an inch
so<00:02:58.930> it<00:02:59.110> that's<00:02:59.410> you<00:02:59.980> know<00:03:00.069> it<00:03:00.190> gets<00:03:00.340> a<00:03:00.400> little

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:00.489 
so it that's you know it gets a little

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:01.620 
so it that's you know it gets a little
bit<00:03:00.670> smaller<00:03:00.760> it's<00:03:01.090> a<00:03:01.150> little<00:03:01.330> further<00:03:01.450> away

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
bit smaller it's a little further away

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:04.490 
bit smaller it's a little further away
so<00:03:01.930> a<00:03:02.620> 1/2<00:03:03.010> -<00:03:03.190> that's<00:03:03.640> a<00:03:03.790> pretty<00:03:04.330> big

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
so a 1/2 - that's a pretty big

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.410 
so a 1/2 - that's a pretty big
magnification<00:03:05.500> imagine<00:03:05.980> that<00:03:06.519> that<00:03:07.120> thumb

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
magnification imagine that that thumb

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.900 
magnification imagine that that thumb
filling<00:03:08.170> more<00:03:08.590> than<00:03:08.799> you<00:03:09.130> know<00:03:09.220> if<00:03:09.370> I<00:03:09.459> get<00:03:09.670> it

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
filling more than you know if I get it

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:11.880 
filling more than you know if I get it
I'm<00:03:10.599> not<00:03:10.810> gonna<00:03:10.900> adjust<00:03:11.170> the<00:03:11.260> focus<00:03:11.530> here<00:03:11.680> but

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
I'm not gonna adjust the focus here but

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:13.979 
I'm not gonna adjust the focus here but
I<00:03:12.130> can<00:03:12.370> probably<00:03:12.519> get<00:03:12.760> like<00:03:12.910> seven<00:03:13.870> or<00:03:13.900> eight

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:13.989 
I can probably get like seven or eight

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:16.199 
I can probably get like seven or eight
thumbs<00:03:14.380> across<00:03:14.860> on<00:03:15.220> this<00:03:15.760> screen<00:03:16.030> while

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
thumbs across on this screen while

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:17.850 
thumbs across on this screen while
imagine<00:03:16.660> getting<00:03:16.870> that<00:03:17.049> thumb<00:03:17.290> so<00:03:17.500> it<00:03:17.530> filled

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:17.860 
imagine getting that thumb so it filled

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.580 
imagine getting that thumb so it filled
more<00:03:18.430> than<00:03:18.579> half<00:03:19.030> of<00:03:19.239> the<00:03:19.780> Earth<00:03:19.900> screen<00:03:20.380> right

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
more than half of the Earth screen right

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.680 
more than half of the Earth screen right
there<00:03:20.859> that's<00:03:21.370> what<00:03:21.670> this<00:03:21.790> lens<00:03:22.060> does<00:03:22.359> for<00:03:22.600> you

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
there that's what this lens does for you

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.720 
there that's what this lens does for you
and<00:03:22.900> it<00:03:23.650> does<00:03:23.890> it<00:03:24.070> without<00:03:24.160> having<00:03:24.459> to<00:03:24.609> be

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
and it does it without having to be

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:26.940 
and it does it without having to be
extremely<00:03:25.090> telephoto<00:03:25.660> because<00:03:26.019> this<00:03:26.230> is<00:03:26.410> a<00:03:26.440> 50

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950

that focal length for macro there used
to<00:03:38.019> be<00:03:38.079> a<00:03:38.170> few<00:03:38.350> 60<00:03:38.829> millimeters<00:03:39.430> and<00:03:39.819> now

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
to be a few 60 millimeters and now

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:43.620 
to be a few 60 millimeters and now
generally<00:03:41.019> you<00:03:41.079> can<00:03:41.200> find<00:03:41.440> some<00:03:41.620> 100<00:03:42.100> or<00:03:42.630> 135
