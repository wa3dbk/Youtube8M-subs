your round approach I am also using a

your round approach I am also using a

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
link band for the Moto 360 so that's

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:20.820 
link band for the Moto 360 so that's
probably<00:02:19.660> where<00:02:20.050> a<00:02:20.080> lot<00:02:20.319> of<00:02:20.349> the<00:02:20.440> heaviness
