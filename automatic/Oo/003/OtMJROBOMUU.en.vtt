wider age range from 10 to 17 we really

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:06.929 
wider age range from 10 to 17 we really

want to understand the different tasks

00:04:06.939 --> 00:04:08.309 
want to understand the different tasks
that<00:04:06.969> are<00:04:07.419> performed<00:04:07.510> we<00:04:07.840> started<00:04:08.079> off<00:04:08.139> with<00:04:08.230> a

00:04:08.309 --> 00:04:08.319 
that are performed we started off with a

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:10.289 
that are performed we started off with a
mowing<00:04:08.620> task<00:04:08.859> in<00:04:09.069> a<00:04:09.129> farm<00:04:09.370> field<00:04:09.459> then<00:04:09.969> we<00:04:10.150> have

00:04:10.289 --> 00:04:10.299 
mowing task in a farm field then we have

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:12.839 
mowing task in a farm field then we have
the<00:04:10.719> driver<00:04:10.989> traversed<00:04:11.709> through<00:04:11.980> a<00:04:12.040> farmyard

00:04:12.839 --> 00:04:12.849 
the driver traversed through a farmyard

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:14.640 
the driver traversed through a farmyard
and<00:04:13.180> then<00:04:13.329> from<00:04:13.810> there<00:04:13.989> it's<00:04:14.200> basically<00:04:14.379> a

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
and then from there it's basically a

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:16.469 
and then from there it's basically a
road<00:04:14.859> trip<00:04:15.129> to<00:04:15.430> get<00:04:15.549> to<00:04:15.669> another<00:04:15.879> farm<00:04:16.180> there

00:04:16.469 --> 00:04:16.479 
road trip to get to another farm there

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:18.120

initial results were expected around the

end of the year Steve Jake and will were
one<00:04:23.710> of<00:04:23.740> the<00:04:23.860> first<00:04:24.039> families<00:04:24.280> to<00:04:24.580> participate

00:04:24.689 --> 00:04:24.699 
one of the first families to participate

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:27.180 
one of the first families to participate
I<00:04:25.419> would<00:04:25.690> say<00:04:25.900> that<00:04:26.169> the<00:04:26.349> the<00:04:26.590> research<00:04:26.919> being

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
I would say that the the research being

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:29.640 
I would say that the the research being
done<00:04:27.400> here<00:04:27.580> will<00:04:27.820> just<00:04:28.030> help<00:04:28.210> qualify<00:04:29.169> and

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:29.650 
done here will just help qualify and

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:31.290 
done here will just help qualify and
maybe<00:04:29.889> make<00:04:30.340> you<00:04:30.490> feel<00:04:30.669> more<00:04:30.880> comfortable

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300 
maybe make you feel more comfortable

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.210 
maybe make you feel more comfortable
about<00:04:31.660> the<00:04:32.020> tasks<00:04:32.530> that<00:04:32.590> you're<00:04:32.800> assigning

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:33.220

your youth Steve and his boys were

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:36.330 
your youth Steve and his boys were
excited<00:04:35.410> and<00:04:35.590> willing<00:04:35.830> to<00:04:35.949> help<00:04:36.070> with<00:04:36.220> the

research and they felt the tractor and

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:39.749 
research and they felt the tractor and
simulator<00:04:38.620> did<00:04:38.830> an<00:04:38.949> excellent<00:04:39.310> job<00:04:39.460> of

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:41.740 
replicating an actual farm environment I

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.650 
replicating an actual farm environment I
was<00:04:42.009> very<00:04:42.190> impressed<00:04:42.400> it's<00:04:43.240> a<00:04:43.389> very
