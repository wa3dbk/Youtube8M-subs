00:00:02.699 --> 00:00:08.410
 zigzag are you ok if you understand 

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:09.700
 then who can not call it difficult 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:24.759
 question is i normal 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:27.939
 Looking to compare and check 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:31.119
 sort of passed so hello to you all 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:33.520
 the king of my taste does not allow me 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:35.290
 talk about something low and disgusting so 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:37.930
 that speech today will be about the strongest in 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:39.940
 world and for the topic suppose i am for 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:42.730
 his title to the word 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:45.490
 heroes of 6 colors and let her about you 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:47.500
 not to say it is necessary considering that she is just 

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:49.510
 shouts such a number let your 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:52.000
 heart will tell you about the right way 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:54.280
 fight demons think you need 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:59.290
 send a nuclear bomb on them send 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:01:02.890
 army to call on god god god early 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:05.590
 he has not finished yet of course you need 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:07.749
 collect a bunch of heroes and they are exactly with everything 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.789
 handle the very best and to their 

00:01:07.749 --> 00:01:13.119
 sure seemed to me 6 as drawn 

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:14.439
 a7 this is so interesting that in the end 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:16.299
 lead to controversy 

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:18.369
 and attempts to kill each other principle 

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:19.899
 demon is not evil to seize the world usually 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:22.119
 not rushing and generally can wait 

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:22.780
 and so around such idea also turns 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:24.729
 anime plot 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.189
 the narration is conducted through the strongest 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:29.619
 in peace and then look in my honest 

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:33.130
 eyes and say that he is wrong cast 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:36.310
 mayer meet the protagonist naive 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:38.560
 deft bold and dior basically like me 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.810
 can't handle girls 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:44.590
 the main goal in life is to kill the demons and 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:47.439
 the root of all problems is the source of evil is 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:49.560
 just knows how to fight and loves trying 

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:52.090
 prove your strength and intelligence and 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.189
 bravery becomes one of the heroes 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.840
 further acquainted with the princess who 

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:59.439
 possesses very cute and 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:02.259
 charming eyes and some more 

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:04.599
 characters the atmosphere of the story is good 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:09.130
 nice drawn pleases beautiful fur 

00:02:04.599 --> 00:02:11.350
 although the demons in 3d draw weakly 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:12.890
 and the setting itself is not falling into 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:14.810
 chest harems panzu 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.180
 keep evolving along the way good 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.740
 beautiful fairy tales which by the way does not mean 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.319
 lack of beautiful girls 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:23.300
 have a look at who does it all in general 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:25.700
 makes you look and wait for the following 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:27.290
 series there are boring moments but it 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.860
 rather, the claims of someone who is not allowed 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.740
 call 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:33.770
 he lacks the dynamics of the plot and you should 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:36.050
 like whether to start watching yes 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:38.120
 if you like adventures and fights 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:40.610
 which does not exclude flickering beautiful 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.680
 girls on the screen even like a fairy tale plot 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:45.320
 it looks very bearable every time even 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.600
 twist the bet with a similar beginning lived yes 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:49.239
 there were heroes as a result I can recommend 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:53.630
 you to view 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:54.470
 God asked me to convey that not all came out yet 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:58.040
 series 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:03:03.880
 hey but what's this what to call it 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:06.880
 no time well see the neighbors woke up 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.880
 altogether
