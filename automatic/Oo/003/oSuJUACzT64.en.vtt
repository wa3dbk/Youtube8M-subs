but<00:02:23.500> it's<00:02:23.950> almost<00:02:24.220> like<00:02:24.670> when<00:02:25.660> when<00:02:26.410> he<00:02:26.799> can

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
but it's almost like when when he can

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.160 
but it's almost like when when he can
pick<00:02:27.250> this<00:02:27.430> shoe<00:02:27.640> up<00:02:27.790> and<00:02:27.970> put<00:02:28.180> it<00:02:28.540> on<00:02:28.720> his<00:02:28.750> foot

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
and then there's an emotional connection

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.970 
and then there's an emotional connection
for<00:02:31.510> him<00:02:31.660> that's<00:02:31.870> gonna<00:02:32.049> allow<00:02:32.170> him<00:02:32.590> to<00:02:32.769> maybe

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
for him that's gonna allow him to maybe

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:34.759 
for him that's gonna allow him to maybe
even<00:02:33.280> emotionally<00:02:33.970> play<00:02:34.180> at<00:02:34.299> a<00:02:34.329> higher<00:02:34.569> level
