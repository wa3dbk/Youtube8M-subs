00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.400
 hello everyone today I bring you 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.550
 a technique that I personally like 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:32.830
 I just started using it but 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:35.530
 the truth is that it makes me very pretty 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:39.240
 the the result and can be used to 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:42.690
 many things we will use 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:45.270
 the paper either sheets of some magazine 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.100
 some book some copies that we have 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.480
 that's why we're not going to use that 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.670
 let's throw it away 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:55.280
 let's use a mixture 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:58.429
 which is in this case I use 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:01.560
 two tablespoons of coffee coffee from which 

00:00:58.429 --> 00:01:04.950
 We use normally to drink 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:07.860
 and also use is like a fifth of 

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:10.530
 glass of water obviously the quantities 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:14.170
 they will depend on the color they want 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:17.090
 Take your mixture and let your paper remain 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:20.479
 I will also use 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.760
 this little sponge broach 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:24.600
 that already 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.600
 and this old lady 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.090
 what we are going to do 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:35.860
 is that we're going to take it whether they need 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:37.700
 the paper the size of your sheet or as in 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:40.689
 I like it 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.689
 is cut 

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:45.510
 pieces 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.510
 so 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:52.730
 right 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:55.120
 and this piece we are going to color 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:57.980
 with the mix that you just showed us 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:01.159
 I'm going to put an appointment basis here so that 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:04.320
 do not mistreat my table 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:06.659
 let's take the mixture 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.960
 Well, this alone is also with some 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:12.390
 cotton with a piece of cloth we're going 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:14.180
 to do a little bit and we squeezed it out 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.940
 stay the most 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:22.240
 dry that can be 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:22.240
 and we started coloring our paper 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.310
 we are going to do this 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:34.430
 depending on what we need not 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:37.930
 we can do it like I did what 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.930
 color in all the paper 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.290
 do another piece I do not know just like that 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:47.939
 like what 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:50.340
 doing spots in other colors nothing 

00:02:47.939 --> 00:02:51.650
 more the edges in order as you like 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.079
 prefer 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.420
 this we are going to let it dry when it is 

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:59.420
 almost dry we will put it inside 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:01.610
 a book that 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.850
 that of the paper then flat as 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:06.640
 originally you see 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:08.660
 in this case for the project that I think 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:13.050
 use this 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:16.660
 cut three circles of the same paper 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:19.050
 but if it be balls 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.050
 God 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.190
 I will also paint 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:28.400
 one of the circles we are going to 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.680
 do between a book as I told them to 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.410
 let our flat paper be this is not 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:36.350
 because what interests me is that they remain 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:39.350
 wrinkled and I like to give him the 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:42.820
 color when it 's like that the paper ok let's go 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:42.820
 to leave this dry 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:50.980
 here I have some that already 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:50.980
 says before 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:58.000
 and the truth is that I liked how they are 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:04:01.610
 the circles once they are already dry 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.740
 we load it a little more color with the 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:05.950
 humidity of the mixture thus re- 

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:05.950
 to extend 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:12.000
 we play and what we are going to do is 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:13.980
 obviously the three circles where three 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.620
 different sizes we are going to put the 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:20.850
 Marseille and over 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:23.490
 down forgive the one who follows him and at the end 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:25.720
 the smallest here I will do as a 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:28.360
 flower type 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:33.600
 I'm going to unite the three local pieces that 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:33.600
 with this we are going to join them through the center 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:41.270
 we open 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:41.270
 the little people 

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:46.190
 we do not have left 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:48.170
 our flower 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:50.870
 I can play a little more and 

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:52.639
 we need crumpled 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:54.889
 I have already done 

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:59.080
 as you can see it is a very technical 

00:04:54.889 --> 00:05:01.449
 easy and that I like a lot 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:04.720
 for decoration I am proposing a 

00:05:01.449 --> 00:05:06.250
 scrap page with this I have good 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:08.800
 I hope you liked this technique 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:10.629
 to put it into practice and that should 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.789
 leave me your comments if you have any 

00:05:10.629 --> 00:05:17.039
 I can definitely leave it here or write 

00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:17.039
 9 mail thank you for watching me there 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:32.060
