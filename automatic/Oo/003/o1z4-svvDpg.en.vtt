00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
which I talked about Dave Mustaine my

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.100 
which I talked about Dave Mustaine my
ex-girlfriend<00:00:11.670> who<00:00:12.120> dumped<00:00:12.480> me<00:00:12.509> in<00:00:12.660> Alaska

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
ex-girlfriend who dumped me in Alaska

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.310

that<00:00:13.559> we<00:00:14.400> were<00:00:14.519> playing<00:00:14.820> Wigan<00:00:15.690> Athletic<00:00:15.809> a

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
that we were playing Wigan Athletic a

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.950 
that we were playing Wigan Athletic a
Premier<00:00:16.859> League<00:00:17.039> side<00:00:17.400> in<00:00:17.940> the<00:00:18.180> FA<00:00:18.480> Cup<00:00:18.510> I

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
Premier League side in the FA Cup I

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.599 
Premier League side in the FA Cup I
thought<00:00:19.350> that<00:00:19.650> drawing<00:00:19.920> meant<00:00:20.220> that<00:00:20.369> we<00:00:20.460> would

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
thought that drawing meant that we would

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.189 
thought that drawing meant that we would
replay<00:00:21.000> each<00:00:21.150> other<00:00:21.390> but<00:00:21.570> in<00:00:21.689> fact<00:00:21.840> apparently

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
replay each other but in fact apparently

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.189 
replay each other but in fact apparently
drawing<00:00:22.740> means<00:00:22.949> that<00:00:23.220> we<00:00:23.400> will<00:00:23.609> now<00:00:24.090> be<00:00:24.199> going

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
drawing means that we will now be going

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.370 
drawing means that we will now be going
to<00:00:25.439> extra<00:00:25.980> time<00:00:26.220> so<00:00:26.730> that's<00:00:27.539> that's<00:00:28.140> what

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
to extra time so that's that's what

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.070 
to extra time so that's that's what
we're<00:00:28.529> doing<00:00:28.830> and<00:00:28.980> we<00:00:29.189> have<00:00:29.400> to<00:00:29.580> win<00:00:29.730> it<00:00:30.660> means

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
we're doing and we have to win it means

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:37.750 
we're doing and we have to win it means
everything<00:00:31.590> to<00:00:31.710> this<00:00:31.800> club<00:00:32.040> financially<00:00:32.700> oh
