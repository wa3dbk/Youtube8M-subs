00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:31.550 
out like a couple of years ago

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:35.540 
out like a couple of years ago
was<00:04:32.550> that<00:04:32.700> real<00:04:33.090> I<00:04:33.600> was<00:04:34.380> under<00:04:34.680> the<00:04:34.710> assumption

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
was that real I was under the assumption

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:37.159 
was that real I was under the assumption
that<00:04:35.580> it<00:04:35.820> was<00:04:36.000> not<00:04:36.240> famine<00:04:36.780> that<00:04:36.990> it<00:04:37.080> was

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:37.169 
that it was not famine that it was

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:40.000 
that it was not famine that it was
actually<00:04:37.590> real<00:04:37.860> and<00:04:38.130> they<00:04:38.520> were<00:04:38.580> gonna<00:04:38.880> do

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:40.010 
actually real and they were gonna do

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:42.770 
actually real and they were gonna do
something<00:04:41.010> with<00:04:41.250> it<00:04:41.520> but<00:04:41.880> I<00:04:41.940> guess<00:04:42.360> what<00:04:42.690> does

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780 
something with it but I guess what does

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:45.170 
something with it but I guess what does
it<00:04:42.960> just<00:04:43.140> act<00:04:43.470> it<00:04:43.740> I<00:04:43.890> guess<00:04:44.130> he<00:04:44.310> was<00:04:44.520> asked<00:04:45.090> if

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180 
it just act it I guess he was asked if

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.140 
it just act it I guess he was asked if
it<00:04:45.360> was<00:04:45.479> real<00:04:45.810> it<00:04:45.990> was<00:04:46.140> asked<00:04:46.620> of<00:04:46.740> course<00:04:47.150> but
