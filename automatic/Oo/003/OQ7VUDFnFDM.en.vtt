 the other side once again the image of the 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.890
 naruto because at that time only existed 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:21.840
 even if naruto was released then it was crazy 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.840
 that they have repeated the image on the side 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.990
 here at the top we have that 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.119
 highlight that I already said that it is well 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.899
 100 unpleasant cases gava could open 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:34.960
 the box 

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:36.909
 so the tip is always going to pull with 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:41.289
 Be careful around here you can open 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:43.479
 the house right then a stylus and 

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:45.390
 note that here in the upper part we 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:48.899
 we have some signatures 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:53.170
 these signatures belong to the team that 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:55.090
 produced the cool figure normally 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.590
 they do it with the first 200 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.569
 priorities 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:01.240
 So this review of the box I hope 

00:01:58.569 --> 00:02:03.880
 You liked it and we're going to 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:06.689

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:21.080

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:23.660
 base and a head and stake that 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.210
 he uses to drill the rim is never 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.830
 What does he use as a weapon? 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:30.740
 I will present each of the pieces for 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:33.110
 More details you here I'll start 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:35.330
 by the base 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:38.930
 so we just have a base 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:42.380
 circular with the well- written name below 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:44.750
 the name of the xtr line and the sleep producer 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:47.420
 here in the upper part we have two 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:51.070
 pins where you will fit the feet 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:54.740
 It's okay, a simple base. 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:55.550
 here we have legs notice that we 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:58.610
 Details 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:00.820
 I'll show you here for several 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:00.820
 angles 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:09.710
 this is just one detail is that feet up to 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:13.670
 nail polish 

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:16.850
 they did little to vary in 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:18.440
 assume doing a good job as a 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:22.340
 ever 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:27.320
 here the legs but a part here is the 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:31.790
 torso cost 1 top of pm is 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:34.300
 so that in the cover painting part of 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:34.300
 back 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:39.400
 the side 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:47.410
 the professional is just painting on the nails 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:55.870
 hand as you can see well detailed 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:59.310
 same as assuming do show 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:01.959
 for you now that the head of the foot 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:04.180
 I do not know if it was for you to see it right. 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:09.840
 the details but we'll try not to 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:12.519
 I'll come back here to the back side 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:14.800
 probably the front part 

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:17.709
 look at the band made with that 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:22.570
 chrome material gives a nice shine 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:24.210
 here again values ​​here gives a 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:27.210
 quick turn around 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:27.210

 here we have that gun that dad uses 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:38.900
 one to one simple piece of plastic 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:41.449
 There's nothing much to say about this game. 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:44.900
 just a piece of plastic yet the two 

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:49.070
 sides only that nothing very special 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:50.930
 look only then this is the contents of the box 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:56.470

 places and see how it got after 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:22.349

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:33.300
 now we have a view on the part of 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.300
 back 

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:42.390
 the view of the other side 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:51.199
 where you can better repair the 

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:52.880

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:17.449
 low cost and worth a lot you have 

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:21.800
