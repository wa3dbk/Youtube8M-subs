00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
here we are this is a makeshift

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.649 
here we are this is a makeshift
suspension<00:01:34.740> bridge<00:01:34.950> I<00:01:35.100> made<00:01:35.540> just<00:01:36.540> to

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
suspension bridge I made just to

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.440 
suspension bridge I made just to
basically<00:01:37.290> see<00:01:37.680> what<00:01:37.799> it<00:01:37.890> would<00:01:37.950> look<00:01:38.009> like

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
basically see what it would look like

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.179 
basically see what it would look like
this<00:01:39.450> is<00:01:39.630> basically<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.170> entrance<00:01:40.619> into<00:01:40.920> the

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
this is basically the entrance into the

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.249 
this is basically the entrance into the
swamp<00:01:41.549> area<00:01:41.970> as<00:01:42.420> you<00:01:42.600> can<00:01:42.750> see<00:01:42.869> I<00:01:42.899> don't<00:01:43.110> really

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
swamp area as you can see I don't really

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.499 
swamp area as you can see I don't really
finish<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.860> biomes<00:01:44.250> of<00:01:44.460> painting<00:01:45.390> it

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
finish the biomes of painting it

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.219 
are
that's<00:02:01.920> the<00:02:02.130> swamp<00:02:02.490> and<00:02:02.850> this<00:02:03.600> leads<00:02:03.840> into<00:02:04.049> the

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
that's the swamp and this leads into the

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.530 
that's the swamp and this leads into the
mountains

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:07.540 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:11.610 

I<00:02:08.550> think<00:02:09.550> maybe<00:02:09.880> a<00:02:10.000> little<00:02:10.150> too<00:02:10.420> much<00:02:10.450> snow<00:02:10.840> but

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
I think maybe a little too much snow but

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.020 
I think maybe a little too much snow but
as<00:02:11.650> I<00:02:11.860> said<00:02:11.920> I<00:02:12.070> haven't<00:02:12.340> finished<00:02:12.490> this<00:02:12.760> yet<00:02:13.000> so

I'll go into the all the details of
building<00:02:23.050> and<00:02:23.230> creating<00:02:23.680> caves<00:02:24.100> using<00:02:24.370> single

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
building and creating caves using single

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.750 
building and creating caves using single
tear<00:02:25.330> commands<00:02:25.630> and<00:02:25.840> stuff<00:02:25.990> like<00:02:26.140> that<00:02:26.760> so

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
tear commands and stuff like that so

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.580

there now right so now we are here
looking<00:02:35.470> down<00:02:35.530> to<00:02:36.430> the<00:02:36.520> forest<00:02:36.910> area<00:02:37.680> show<00:02:38.680> you

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:38.740 
looking down to the forest area show you

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:41.790 
looking down to the forest area show you
what<00:02:38.920> that<00:02:39.040> looks<00:02:39.250> like<00:02:40.380> basically<00:02:41.380> we<00:02:41.650> have

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
what that looks like basically we have

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.710 
what that looks like basically we have
this<00:02:42.010> kind<00:02:42.460> of<00:02:42.610> waterfall<00:02:43.480> I<00:02:43.510> created<00:02:45.450> this<00:02:46.450> is

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
this kind of waterfall I created this is

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.130 
this kind of waterfall I created this is
it's<00:02:47.620> pretty<00:02:47.770> good<00:02:48.010> I<00:02:48.660> guess<00:02:49.660> I<00:02:49.780> like<00:02:49.930> the<00:02:50.050> way

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
it's pretty good I guess I like the way

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.230 
it's pretty good I guess I like the way
it<00:02:50.200> turned<00:02:50.470> out<00:02:50.590> but<00:02:51.250> as<00:02:51.760> I<00:02:51.910> said<00:02:52.030> it's<00:02:52.210> not

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:52.240 
it turned out but as I said it's not

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.990 
it turned out but as I said it's not
finished<00:02:52.540> yet<00:02:52.780> it's<00:02:53.200> just<00:02:53.910> kind<00:02:54.910> of<00:02:54.940> like

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
finished yet it's just kind of like

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.690 
finished yet it's just kind of like
looking<00:02:55.840> to<00:02:56.050> see<00:02:56.200> how<00:02:56.320> it<00:02:56.440> would<00:02:56.560> look<00:02:56.590> like<00:02:56.770> I

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.790 

know<00:03:00.700> that's<00:03:00.850> nuts<00:03:01.150> that<00:03:01.390> if<00:03:02.380> you<00:03:02.470> come<00:03:02.650> this

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:02.800 
know that's nuts that if you come this

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.860 
know that's nuts that if you come this
way<00:03:03.040> so<00:03:03.730> you<00:03:03.850> just<00:03:03.940> quickly<00:03:04.270> travel<00:03:04.630> over

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
way so you just quickly travel over

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.640 
way so you just quickly travel over
there<00:03:06.360> that<00:03:07.360> will<00:03:07.480> be<00:03:07.600> the<00:03:07.720> entrance<00:03:08.110> into<00:03:08.560> the

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
there that will be the entrance into the

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.490 
there that will be the entrance into the
mountains<00:03:09.040> and<00:03:09.780> that<00:03:10.780> would<00:03:10.959> be<00:03:11.050> the<00:03:11.140> entrance

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
mountains and that would be the entrance

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.979 
mountains and that would be the entrance
from<00:03:11.650> forest<00:03:12.100> it<00:03:12.910> will<00:03:13.060> have<00:03:13.180> like<00:03:13.330> really<00:03:13.780> big

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:13.989 
from forest it will have like really big

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:17.070 
from forest it will have like really big
wooden<00:03:14.380> wall<00:03:14.820> that<00:03:15.820> will<00:03:16.030> look<00:03:16.180> pretty<00:03:16.810> good

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:17.080 
wooden wall that will look pretty good

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.229 
wooden wall that will look pretty good
and<00:03:17.350> hopefully<00:03:18.040> a<00:03:18.100> little<00:03:18.280> encampment<00:03:18.970> over

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
and hopefully a little encampment over

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:22.380 
and hopefully a little encampment over
here<00:03:19.480> and<00:03:20.459> yeah<00:03:21.459> I'll<00:03:21.670> show<00:03:21.880> you<00:03:21.940> what<00:03:22.150> this

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:22.390 
here and yeah I'll show you what this

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:25.800 
here and yeah I'll show you what this
leads<00:03:22.600> to<00:03:23.910> there's<00:03:24.910> a<00:03:25.030> big<00:03:25.239> part<00:03:25.540> into<00:03:25.780> the

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
leads to there's a big part into the

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.530 
leads to there's a big part into the
forest<00:03:26.290> which<00:03:27.190> leads<00:03:27.459> into<00:03:27.550> this<00:03:27.820> empty<00:03:28.090> gap

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
forest which leads into this empty gap

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.120 
forest which leads into this empty gap
and<00:03:28.860> that's<00:03:29.860> where<00:03:30.130> my<00:03:30.519> god<00:03:31.209> tree<00:03:31.570> will<00:03:31.750> go

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
and that's where my god tree will go

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.400 
and that's where my god tree will go
will<00:03:33.130> be<00:03:33.660> that's<00:03:34.660> why<00:03:34.780> I<00:03:34.810> left<00:03:34.930> the<00:03:35.019> gap<00:03:35.200> is

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.410 
will be that's why I left the gap is

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:38.090 
will be that's why I left the gap is
going<00:03:35.650> to<00:03:35.709> be<00:03:35.769> a<00:03:35.800> really<00:03:36.070> big<00:03:36.190> country<00:03:36.820> and

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
going to be a really big country and

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.949 
going to be a really big country and
that<00:03:39.100> would<00:03:39.310> look<00:03:39.459> pretty<00:03:39.760> good<00:03:40.180> on<00:03:40.450> its<00:03:40.750> time

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:40.959 
that would look pretty good on its time

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:43.400 
that would look pretty good on its time
so<00:03:41.800> yeah<00:03:41.980> anyway<00:03:42.310> thanks<00:03:42.640> for<00:03:42.670> watching<00:03:42.790> I'll
