to<00:00:18.150> move<00:00:18.600> the<00:00:18.779> logger<00:00:18.960> and<00:00:20.150> tap<00:00:21.150> on<00:00:21.180> a<00:00:21.330> tree<00:00:21.660> to

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
to move the logger and tap on a tree to

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.689 
to move the logger and tap on a tree to
cut<00:00:22.619> it<00:00:22.769> down<00:00:22.800> when<00:00:23.519> the<00:00:23.609> logger<00:00:23.820> is<00:00:24.060> nearby

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:25.699 
cut it down when the logger is nearby

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:28.730 
cut it down when the logger is nearby
see<00:00:26.699> when<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.090> trees<00:00:28.019> got<00:00:28.230> on<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:28.529> logger

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
see when the trees got on the logger

little<00:00:37.950> cut<00:00:38.760> it<00:00:38.879> down<00:00:39.059> note<00:00:39.960> that<00:00:40.140> this<00:00:40.350> tree

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
little cut it down note that this tree

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.280 
little cut it down note that this tree
is<00:00:40.710> a<00:00:40.860> little<00:00:41.430> bit<00:00:41.520> different<00:00:42.000> from<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.290> red

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
is a little bit different from the red

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.799 
is a little bit different from the red
one<00:00:43.530> it<00:00:43.770> occupies<00:00:44.280> two<00:00:45.000> squares<00:00:45.390> when<00:00:45.660> it

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
one it occupies two squares when it

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:51.500 
one it occupies two squares when it
falls<00:00:46.140> down<00:00:48.110> I'm<00:00:49.110> also<00:00:49.820> chemistry<00:00:50.820> I<00:00:51.000> know

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
falls down I'm also chemistry I know

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.369 
falls down I'm also chemistry I know
that<00:00:51.680> the<00:00:52.680> tree<00:00:53.309> only<00:00:53.820> force<00:00:54.180> to<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.110> other

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
that the tree only force to the other

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.920 
that the tree only force to the other
side<00:00:55.620> of<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:55.949> raga<00:00:56.160> so<00:00:56.789> if<00:00:56.969> i<00:00:57.090> try<00:00:57.390> to<00:00:57.449> cut<00:00:57.809> it

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
side of the raga so if i try to cut it

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.599 
side of the raga so if i try to cut it
down<00:00:58.129> upward<00:00:59.129> a<00:00:59.430> blog<00:00:59.850> you<00:00:59.969> will<00:01:00.000> move<00:01:00.329> to<00:01:00.690> me

00:01:01.599 --> 00:01:01.609 
down upward a blog you will move to me

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:06.980 
down upward a blog you will move to me
the<00:01:02.609> square<00:01:02.969> below<00:01:03.979> automatically<00:01:04.979> i<00:01:05.659> can<00:01:06.659> cut

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
the square below automatically i can cut

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.940 
the square below automatically i can cut
this<00:01:07.530> tree<00:01:07.590> down<00:01:07.830> also<00:01:09.049> notes<00:01:10.049> that<00:01:10.229> when<00:01:10.860> the

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
this tree down also notes that when the

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.130 
this tree down also notes that when the
tree<00:01:11.159> is<00:01:11.189> fallen<00:01:11.820> into<00:01:12.180> a<00:01:12.210> square<00:01:12.600> i<00:01:12.780> cannot

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
tree is fallen into a square i cannot

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.280 
tree is fallen into a square i cannot
step<00:01:13.409> on<00:01:13.650> it<00:01:13.830> unto<00:01:14.280> it<00:01:14.400> so<00:01:14.670> if<00:01:14.970> i<00:01:15.150> try<00:01:15.390> to<00:01:15.450> cut

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
step on it unto it so if i try to cut

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.450 
step on it unto it so if i try to cut
the<00:01:16.619> tree<00:01:17.430> down<00:01:17.460> word<00:01:17.970> it<00:01:18.900> tells<00:01:19.200> me<00:01:19.290> that<00:01:19.460> that

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
the tree down word it tells me that that

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.810 
the tree down word it tells me that that
square<00:01:20.939> is<00:01:21.060> not<00:01:21.270> reachable<00:01:22.040> if<00:01:23.040> i<00:01:23.220> try<00:01:23.400> to<00:01:23.460> cut

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
square is not reachable if i try to cut

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.380 
square is not reachable if i try to cut
it<00:01:23.939> to<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:24.540> right<00:01:25.250> it<00:01:26.250> tells<00:01:26.549> me<00:01:26.670> that<00:01:26.759> this

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
it to the right it tells me that this

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.039 
it to the right it tells me that this
square<00:01:27.840> is<00:01:27.869> already<00:01:28.799> occupied<00:01:29.130> and<00:01:29.640> to<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.689> to

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
square is already occupied and to the to

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.350 
square is already occupied and to the to
the<00:01:31.140> right<00:01:31.350> there<00:01:31.799> is<00:01:31.920> no<00:01:32.130> not<00:01:32.820> enough<00:01:33.150> space

for<00:01:33.900> me<00:01:34.049> to<00:01:34.079> canada<00:01:35.509> basically<00:01:36.509> i'm<00:01:36.630> stuck

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
for me to canada basically i'm stuck

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.230 
for me to canada basically i'm stuck
here<00:01:37.170> so<00:01:37.500> i<00:01:37.530> have<00:01:37.770> to<00:01:37.890> undo<00:01:38.250> and<00:01:38.549> do<00:01:38.850> all<00:01:39.090> the

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
here so i have to undo and do all the

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.770 
here so i have to undo and do all the
way<00:01:39.710> in<00:01:40.710> some<00:01:41.040> cases<00:01:41.250> you<00:01:41.490> just<00:01:41.759> have<00:01:41.909> to<00:01:42.119> undo

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
way in some cases you just have to undo

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.219 
way in some cases you just have to undo
one<00:01:43.020> or<00:01:43.170> two<00:01:43.350> steps<00:01:44.600> now<00:01:45.600> let's<00:01:45.869> try<00:01:46.170> another

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
one or two steps now let's try another

00:01:46.229 --> 00:02:00.590 
one or two steps now let's try another
approach<00:01:55.219> okay<00:01:56.219> um<00:01:58.189> now<00:01:59.189> whenever<00:01:59.880> you<00:02:00.149> see<00:02:00.360> a

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
approach okay um now whenever you see a

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.340 
approach okay um now whenever you see a
green<00:02:01.409> tree<00:02:01.710> like<00:02:01.920> this<00:02:02.719> where<00:02:03.719> you<00:02:03.750> can<00:02:04.049> see<00:02:04.320> a

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
green tree like this where you can see a

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.740 
green tree like this where you can see a
shadow<00:02:04.740> a<00:02:05.159> translucent<00:02:05.969> shadow<00:02:06.210> that<00:02:06.450> tells

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
shadow a translucent shadow that tells

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.380 
shadow a translucent shadow that tells
you<00:02:06.960> how<00:02:06.990> many<00:02:07.350> squares<00:02:08.190> are<00:02:08.310> coupe<00:02:08.729> occupies

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
you how many squares are coupe occupies

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.080 
you how many squares are coupe occupies
when<00:02:09.660> it's<00:02:09.899> fallen<00:02:10.610> for<00:02:11.610> this<00:02:11.879> example

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
when it's fallen for this example

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.880 
when it's fallen for this example
occupies<00:02:13.510> three<00:02:14.050> squares<00:02:16.290> or<00:02:17.290> whatever<00:02:17.739> you

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
occupies three squares or whatever you

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.430 
occupies three squares or whatever you
see<00:02:18.129> as<00:02:18.250> a<00:02:18.280> rock<00:02:19.030> it<00:02:19.330> means<00:02:19.780> you<00:02:19.930> cannot<00:02:20.110> step

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
see as a rock it means you cannot step

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.850 
see as a rock it means you cannot step
onto<00:02:20.709> it<00:02:21.069> cannot<00:02:21.640> pass<00:02:22.000> through<00:02:22.030> it<00:02:22.660> nor<00:02:23.590> can

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
onto it cannot pass through it nor can

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:30.770 
onto it cannot pass through it nor can
you<00:02:23.890> fall<00:02:24.340> a<00:02:24.370> tree<00:02:24.519> onto<00:02:24.940> it<00:02:27.900> all<00:02:28.900> right<00:02:29.019> a

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
you fall a tree onto it all right a

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.539 
you fall a tree onto it all right a
river<00:02:31.780> blocks<00:02:32.230> you<00:02:32.470> from<00:02:32.500> reaching<00:02:33.040> the<00:02:33.400> other

00:02:33.539 --> 00:02:33.549 
river blocks you from reaching the other

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:36.780
