00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:07.759
 hello everyone good information 

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:11.019
 on fifa 13 that had happened to me 

00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:14.240
 about the playstation vita la ps vita 

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:16.990
 we have the first details of fifa 13 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:19.990
 for the ps vita 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:23.020
 let's see fifa 13 for ps vita will count 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:26.200
 with the same base in physics and technology 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:28.310
 that the gameplay of ps3 means 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:31.580
 that 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:34.010
 well what does it mean that physics 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:35.809
 of the player is the technology the engine and 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.660
 everything everything they use for 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:42.280
 playstation3 will incorporate it into the 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:45.199
 playstation vita will be a very very equal 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:48.290
 99 percent but one hundred per cent to 99 

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:52.100
 good will also have eight modes of 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:56.300
 game including among others the 11 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:01:00.949
 against 11 tournament mode with more than more than 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:04.460
 50 real real competitions mode 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:07.820
 career and face to face online good 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:10.250
 we will continue to follow the tactile options 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:13.310
 of fifa 2 it means that the 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:16.970
 ps vita tactile options of the feef o 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:19.670
 will remain the same in fifa 13 we can 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:22.159
 kick with the rear touch screen and 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:24.560
 give passes touching any any 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:25.940
 place on the screen or will it continue 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.420
 same 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:31.520
 the question is that we must understand with 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:36.140
 the same physics and technology that 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:38.540
 I started 3 a fifa 12 net game or perform 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.950
 a game practically traced fifa 3 and 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:44.299
 Greece 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:50.539
 the question is that if the two fifa will be and 

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:54.399
 lufa 22.20 or it will be a fifa 13 13 13 that 

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:58.149
 is I mean I explained the fifa 12 and 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:02:02.600
 improved for the ps vita or that will be 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:05.500
 identical to that of the ps3 well well asserts 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.750
 when it comes out but we'll see 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:10.210
 let's hope it 's identical to your daughter 13 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:12.100
 let's hope I do not have the pcd seen but for 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:14.230
 those who have it although I would like 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:16.310
 buy me the purchase version but for 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:20.660
 what they have 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:22.790
 let's hope it's the same as the fifa 13 good 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:25.580
