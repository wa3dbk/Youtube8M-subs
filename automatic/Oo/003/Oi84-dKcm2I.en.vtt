00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
just have an older one I got it a while

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.240 
just have an older one I got it a while
back<00:01:11.270> so<00:01:12.270> once<00:01:12.570> in<00:01:12.780> here<00:01:13.049> you<00:01:13.229> can<00:01:13.470> hit<00:01:13.830> record

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
back so once in here you can hit record

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.039 
back so once in here you can hit record
the<00:01:14.400> screen<00:01:14.640> and<00:01:15.000> start<00:01:15.450> to<00:01:15.570> record<00:01:15.840> your

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
the screen and start to record your

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.969 
the screen and start to record your
screen<00:01:16.170> I<00:01:16.530> like<00:01:17.130> to<00:01:17.280> have<00:01:17.549> mine<00:01:17.820> in<00:01:18.380> 720p<00:01:19.380> for

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
screen I like to have mine in 720p for

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.270 
screen I like to have mine in 720p for
my<00:01:20.880> videos<00:01:21.360> to<00:01:21.570> be<00:01:21.600> 720p<00:01:22.320> but<00:01:22.590> it<00:01:22.710> depends<00:01:23.159> on

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
my videos to be 720p but it depends on

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.080 
my videos to be 720p but it depends on
your<00:01:23.460> screen<00:01:23.790> resolution<00:01:23.939> and<00:01:24.720> how<00:01:25.710> it<00:01:26.090> adapts

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
your screen resolution and how it adapts

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.469 
your screen resolution and how it adapts
so<00:01:27.270> I<00:01:27.420> keep<00:01:27.840> my<00:01:28.049> screen<00:01:28.470> resolution<00:01:28.650> close<00:01:29.520> to

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
so I keep my screen resolution close to

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.649 
so I keep my screen resolution close to
720p<00:01:31.259> to<00:01:32.040> make<00:01:32.220> it<00:01:32.369> look<00:01:32.579> better<00:01:32.729> but<00:01:33.390> I<00:01:33.450> mean

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
720p to make it look better but I mean

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.050 
720p to make it look better but I mean
it's<00:01:34.020> all<00:01:34.380> in<00:01:34.439> whatever<00:01:35.189> you<00:01:35.340> want<00:01:35.549> to<00:01:35.640> do<00:01:35.759> and

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
it's all in whatever you want to do and

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.609 
it's all in whatever you want to do and
you<00:01:36.630> could<00:01:36.780> try<00:01:36.990> it<00:01:37.020> out<00:01:37.170> and<00:01:37.350> see<00:01:37.470> how<00:01:37.560> it

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
you could try it out and see how it

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.850 
you could try it out and see how it
looks<00:01:38.119> but<00:01:39.119> right<00:01:39.360> here<00:01:39.390> I've<00:01:39.659> got<00:01:39.689> a<00:01:40.079> sample

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
looks but right here I've got a sample

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.580 
looks but right here I've got a sample
clip<00:01:41.310> and<00:01:41.610> what<00:01:42.390> I<00:01:42.420> do<00:01:42.570> is<00:01:42.930> I<00:01:42.960> just<00:01:43.200> go<00:01:43.530> to

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
clip and what I do is I just go to

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.380 
clip and what I do is I just go to
points<00:01:44.189> that<00:01:44.340> I<00:01:44.369> want<00:01:44.610> to<00:01:44.700> zoom<00:01:44.850> in<00:01:45.090> in<00:01:45.270> the

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
points that I want to zoom in in the

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.830 
points that I want to zoom in in the
