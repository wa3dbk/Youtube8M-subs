00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:05.930
 marco luque 

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:08.669
 You're a funny guy. 

00:00:08.669 --> 00:00:11.669
 it was just a kitchen icon 

00:00:12.489 --> 00:00:15.489
 for the duel between the last two 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:21.539
 patacas 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.429
 much sacrifice 

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:26.429
 I just wanted to become a successful man. 

00:00:27.319 --> 00:00:28.759
 the historian 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:31.759
 we will turn 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.490
 after the hard 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:40.490
 it's hard to turn it all on its own 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.960
 your phone does not stop 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.330
 when you're playing 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.520
 Do you feel 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.520
 I think that person is saying 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:59.870
 peter pepe deco 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.700
 Because of the disney there is a sensitive citizen 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.510
 several that behind all the people said the senator 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.270
 griseus 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:15.950
 actor's plans 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.950
 You've taken many healings from the directors. 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:23.020
 always six Brazilians love 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.710
 in 2002 accused 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.690
 in the lower house 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:34.450
 he is now on the table for 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.960
 He can give up more. 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.650
 But I used to put his huge employer. He's a person who 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:44.510
 instead of cartilage to lose goals 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.340
 normally 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.700
 if everyone is the same 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.380
 You're like I said. 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.380
 and I how are you 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.300
 Look, I think we're all like the others. 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.300
 since February 

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:11.559
 if there had been a stimulus there 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:16.019
 he is given with a good player 

00:02:20.889 --> 00:02:22.170
 I always dreamed 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.229
 we were with one more player in the state 

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:25.809
 get 

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:28.809
 Paulo, how are you? 

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:33.219
 live with my son 

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:37.260
 cqc people said you do not like a cup of coffee 

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:40.589
 You get machine coffee. 

00:02:40.589 --> 00:02:43.589
 or not the actor is stronger 

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:48.949
 the bodice on which two secretaries 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:52.519
 It's stronger, I prefer the other. 

00:02:56.469 --> 00:02:59.039
 honestly now 

00:02:59.039 --> 00:03:00.209
 in the background 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:03.209
 highlighting being released 

00:03:03.999 --> 00:03:06.499
 although in the background in the background 

00:03:06.499 --> 00:03:07.769
 the people 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:12.409
 in fact I would like to be taken more seriously but even making the Azores 

00:03:14.279 --> 00:03:18.669
 a round of applause for the next harvest the ufrj offers
