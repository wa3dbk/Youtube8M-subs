00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:52.989
 I will take 6 clips 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:01:03.449
 and I will join them here and so I wonder 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:03.449

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:12.810

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:28.170
 scissors for example these are the sides 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:37.780
 from either end of these clips 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:37.780
 that is, here is this head 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.850

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:58.320
 Now we take our with you most rashku 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:08.479
 the end that I cut off we take 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.479
 and insert into the hole for 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:19.280
 until the end and all the other clips that 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:23.130
 were attached to it and leave on 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:26.160
 arm outside that way 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:29.720
 made another earring 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:33.600
 and now my kitchen can wear them 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:37.650
 the clock is only ringing here 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:41.280
 for this we need where paperclips and 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:45.780
 bead bag 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:48.680
 first i will take one arrow and then 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.680
 one end 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:59.730
 slightly so here so that the bead could 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.730
 lie quietly 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:13.120
 rice is very tight to press a bead 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.120
 the second end 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:31.049
 so here I got it now I 

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:31.049
 take this end 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:38.980
 and bend it to either side 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:49.170
 so here it would be an earring in front and 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:52.350
 Now either here die here I bend 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:55.730

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:24.750
 little adjustments 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:33.510
 so i did exactly the same 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:36.350
 way and the second earring just bent 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:36.350

 earrings for monsters 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:56.170
 and for this we need two beads 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:05:00.840
 two paper clips and no glue gun 

00:04:56.170 --> 00:05:05.170

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:20.990

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:37.880
