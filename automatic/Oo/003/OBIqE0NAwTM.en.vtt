walking around with her she'll one

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.260 
walking around with her she'll one
appearances<00:02:21.180> so<00:02:21.390> maybe<00:02:22.200> I<00:02:22.320> should<00:02:22.620> I<00:02:23.210> think<00:02:24.210> I

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
appearances so maybe I should I think I

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:25.460 
appearances so maybe I should I think I
don't<00:02:24.480> see<00:02:24.540> this<00:02:24.630> added<00:02:24.990> benefit<00:02:25.260> then<00:02:25.380> I'm

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470
