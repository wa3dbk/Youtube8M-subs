I<00:00:28.370> like<00:00:28.790> to<00:00:28.940> take<00:00:29.180> a<00:00:29.210> cotton<00:00:29.690> ball<00:00:29.840> and<00:00:30.140> some

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:30.410 
I like to take a cotton ball and some

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.689 
I like to take a cotton ball and some
alcohol<00:00:30.880> go<00:00:31.880> ahead<00:00:32.239> put<00:00:32.929> some<00:00:33.140> on<00:00:33.320> there<00:00:33.699> then

00:00:34.689 --> 00:00:34.699 
alcohol go ahead put some on there then

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:38.680 
alcohol go ahead put some on there then
take<00:00:34.940> your<00:00:35.120> color<00:00:35.329> stick<00:00:35.690> and<00:00:36.070> just<00:00:37.269> twist<00:00:38.269> the

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:38.690 
take your color stick and just twist the

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:41.649 
take your color stick and just twist the
color<00:00:39.019> stick<00:00:39.409> into<00:00:39.769> the<00:00:40.100> cotton<00:00:40.579> ball<00:00:40.760> and<00:00:41.059> the

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:41.659 
color stick into the cotton ball and the

00:00:41.659 --> 00:00:43.660 
color stick into the cotton ball and the
reason<00:00:41.929> I<00:00:42.019> like<00:00:42.199> to<00:00:42.320> do<00:00:42.499> this<00:00:42.679> is<00:00:42.920> because<00:00:43.249> it

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:43.670 
reason I like to do this is because it

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.750 
reason I like to do this is because it
removes<00:00:43.969> that<00:00:44.239> first<00:00:44.570> layer<00:00:44.870> of<00:00:44.899> a<00:00:45.409> wax<00:00:45.649> on<00:00:46.069> the

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:46.760 
removes that first layer of a wax on the

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.720 
removes that first layer of a wax on the
color<00:00:46.969> stick<00:00:47.390> and<00:00:47.690> makes<00:00:48.620> it<00:00:48.769> easier<00:00:49.190> for<00:00:49.280> when

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:49.730 
color stick and makes it easier for when

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.410 
color stick and makes it easier for when
you're<00:00:49.909> ready<00:00:50.089> to<00:00:50.629> apply<00:00:50.870> it<00:00:50.929> to<00:00:51.050> your<00:00:51.230> skin<00:00:51.559> so
