lives<00:00:06.690> in<00:00:06.930> rivers<00:00:07.170> and<00:00:07.319> lakes<00:00:07.440> the<00:00:07.710> reason

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
lives in rivers and lakes the reason

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.980 
lives in rivers and lakes the reason
being<00:00:08.189> the<00:00:08.340> waters<00:00:08.700> murky<00:00:08.940> and<00:00:09.389> so<00:00:09.570> you<00:00:09.630> can't

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
being the waters murky and so you can't

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:11.660 
being the waters murky and so you can't
make<00:00:10.200> a<00:00:10.230> conventional<00:00:10.889> program<00:00:11.250> you<00:00:11.429> can't

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
make a conventional program you can't

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.009 
make a conventional program you can't
send<00:00:12.000> somebody<00:00:12.240> in<00:00:12.480> with<00:00:12.570> an<00:00:12.719> underwater

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
send somebody in with an underwater

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.410 
send somebody in with an underwater
camera<00:00:13.320> so<00:00:14.040> what<00:00:14.190> I<00:00:14.219> do<00:00:14.340> is<00:00:14.790> I<00:00:14.910> use<00:00:15.089> a<00:00:15.120> fishing

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
camera so what I do is I use a fishing

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.890 
camera so what I do is I use a fishing
line<00:00:15.750> but<00:00:16.020> this<00:00:16.289> to<00:00:16.800> me<00:00:16.830> is<00:00:17.010> more<00:00:17.190> of<00:00:17.550> a<00:00:17.900> means

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
line but this to me is more of a means

line but this to me is more of a means
to<00:00:19.109> an<00:00:19.199> end<00:00:19.350> it's<00:00:19.710> sort<00:00:20.070> of<00:00:20.160> it<00:00:21.150> sort<00:00:21.420> of<00:00:21.449> is

to an end it's sort of it sort of is
about<00:00:21.720> fishing<00:00:22.109> but<00:00:22.380> it's<00:00:22.500> not<00:00:22.650> about<00:00:22.830> fishing

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
about fishing but it's not about fishing

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.529 
about fishing but it's not about fishing
it's<00:00:23.279> more<00:00:23.460> about<00:00:23.640> the<00:00:23.789> end<00:00:23.910> result<00:00:24.060> it's<00:00:24.420> more

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
it's more about the end result it's more

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.779 
it's more about the end result it's more
about<00:00:24.660> the<00:00:24.810> fish<00:00:24.990> themselves<00:00:25.199> a<00:00:25.800> lot<00:00:26.640> of<00:00:26.730> the

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
about the fish themselves a lot of the

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.450 
about the fish themselves a lot of the
fish<00:00:26.910> that<00:00:26.939> I<00:00:27.119> go<00:00:27.269> after<00:00:27.660> that<00:00:27.779> I<00:00:28.460> initially

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
fish that I go after that I initially

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.060 
fish that I go after that I initially
hear<00:00:29.910> about<00:00:30.090> them<00:00:30.359> or<00:00:31.230> find<00:00:31.500> out<00:00:31.619> about<00:00:31.769> them

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
hear about them or find out about them

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.709 
hear about them or find out about them
from<00:00:32.369> old<00:00:32.610> books<00:00:32.969> some<00:00:33.300> old<00:00:33.930> sources<00:00:34.410> of

00:00:35.709 --> 00:00:35.719 
from old books some old sources of

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:38.780 
from old books some old sources of
exploration<00:00:36.719> or<00:00:36.840> whatever<00:00:37.489> the<00:00:38.489> thing<00:00:38.520> is

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
exploration or whatever the thing is

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.729 
exploration or whatever the thing is
there's<00:00:38.969> a<00:00:39.030> limit<00:00:39.390> to<00:00:39.420> how<00:00:39.690> much<00:00:39.930> you<00:00:40.110> can<00:00:40.440> find

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
there's a limit to how much you can find

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.500 
there's a limit to how much you can find
out<00:00:40.980> remotely<00:00:41.640> there<00:00:41.820> comes<00:00:42.000> a<00:00:42.090> point<00:00:42.120> where

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
out remotely there comes a point where

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.920 
out remotely there comes a point where
you've<00:00:42.629> got<00:00:42.989> a<00:00:43.020> good<00:00:43.230> just<00:00:43.469> go<00:00:43.680> and<00:00:44.010> start

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:44.930 
you've got a good just go and start

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.029 
you've got a good just go and start
intelligence-gathering<00:00:45.930> on<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.469> ground<00:00:46.680> and

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
intelligence-gathering on the ground and

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.819 
intelligence-gathering on the ground and
the<00:00:47.219> approach<00:00:47.520> that<00:00:47.550> I<00:00:48.410> make<00:00:49.410> a<00:00:49.440> point<00:00:49.680> of

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
the approach that I make a point of

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.100 
the approach that I make a point of
taking<00:00:49.980> is<00:00:50.430> is<00:00:50.750> communicating<00:00:51.750> directly<00:00:51.930> with

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
taking is is communicating directly with

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.110 
taking is is communicating directly with
the<00:00:52.289> local<00:00:52.530> people<00:00:52.710> what's<00:00:53.460> interesting<00:00:53.820> is<00:00:54.090> a

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
the local people what's interesting is a

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.490 
the local people what's interesting is a
lot<00:00:54.149> of<00:00:54.329> these<00:00:54.390> places<00:00:54.660> like<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.140> Congo<00:00:55.469> the

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
lot of these places like the Congo the

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.330 
lot of these places like the Congo the
Amazon<00:00:56.180> fishing<00:00:57.180> is<00:00:57.539> a<00:00:57.930> very<00:00:58.649> much<00:00:58.829> central<00:00:59.190> to

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
Amazon fishing is a very much central to

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.709 
Amazon fishing is a very much central to
people's<00:00:59.430> lives<00:00:59.820> it's<00:01:00.120> not<00:01:00.289> an<00:01:01.289> eccentric

00:01:02.709 --> 00:01:02.719 
people's lives it's not an eccentric

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:05.719 
people's lives it's not an eccentric
minority<00:01:03.719> activity<00:01:03.870> as<00:01:04.439> it<00:01:04.589> is<00:01:04.739> in<00:01:05.010> parts<00:01:05.610> of

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
minority activity as it is in parts of

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:06.950 
minority activity as it is in parts of
the<00:01:05.760> Western<00:01:06.150> world<00:01:06.330> so<00:01:06.570> this<00:01:06.689> is<00:01:06.810> something

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
the Western world so this is something

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.210 
the Western world so this is something
that's<00:01:07.140> very<00:01:07.229> important<00:01:07.740> to<00:01:07.770> them<00:01:07.950> and<00:01:08.070> once

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
that's very important to them and once

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.730 
that's very important to them and once
they<00:01:08.400> actually<00:01:09.140> get<00:01:10.140> a<00:01:10.170> sense<00:01:10.470> that<00:01:10.530> I<00:01:10.680> know

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
they actually get a sense that I know

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.140 
they actually get a sense that I know
what<00:01:11.070> I'm<00:01:11.159> talking<00:01:11.490> about<00:01:11.549> that<00:01:11.909> I<00:01:11.939> am

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
what I'm talking about that I am

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.660 
what I'm talking about that I am
actually<00:01:12.360> capable<00:01:12.750> of<00:01:13.170> catching<00:01:13.920> a<00:01:14.130> fish<00:01:14.310> even

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
actually capable of catching a fish even

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.880 
actually capable of catching a fish even
though<00:01:14.790> I'm<00:01:14.970> an<00:01:15.299> outsider<00:01:15.720> they'll<00:01:16.470> open<00:01:16.770> up

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
though I'm an outsider they'll open up

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.649 
though I'm an outsider they'll open up
they'll<00:01:17.100> tell<00:01:17.340> me<00:01:17.369> things<00:01:17.729> they<00:01:17.970> mostly

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
they'll tell me things they mostly

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.929 
they'll tell me things they mostly
wouldn't<00:01:19.020> tell<00:01:19.229> other<00:01:19.549> outsiders<00:01:20.549> and<00:01:20.820> then

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
wouldn't tell other outsiders and then

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.609 
wouldn't tell other outsiders and then
we<00:01:21.030> go<00:01:21.150> on<00:01:21.180> from<00:01:21.420> there<00:01:21.600> I<00:01:21.840> think<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.470> fish

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
we go on from there I think the fish

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.560 
we go on from there I think the fish
that<00:01:22.740> really<00:01:22.799> stands<00:01:23.520> out<00:01:23.700> for<00:01:23.790> me<00:01:23.850> is<00:01:23.970> the

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
that really stands out for me is the

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.039 
that really stands out for me is the
Goliath<00:01:25.020> tigerfish<00:01:25.560> from<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:25.920> Congo<00:01:26.900> this<00:01:27.900> is

the teeth 1000-pound great wattage but

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
this is a fish living in a river that

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.580 
this is a fish living in a river that
most<00:01:59.670> people<00:01:59.970> just<00:02:00.060> have<00:02:00.240> no<00:02:00.390> idea<00:02:00.420> that<00:02:01.380> it's

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
most people just have no idea that it's

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.950 
most people just have no idea that it's
there<00:02:01.800> but<00:02:02.070> to<00:02:02.310> catch<00:02:02.490> a<00:02:02.610> big<00:02:02.790> one<00:02:02.820> if<00:02:03.210> you<00:02:03.390> take

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
there but to catch a big one if you take

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.500 
there but to catch a big one if you take
the<00:02:04.170> time<00:02:04.440> from<00:02:05.400> my<00:02:05.520> very<00:02:05.790> first<00:02:05.850> going<00:02:06.390> to

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:06.510 
the time from my very first going to

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:07.490 
the time from my very first going to
that<00:02:06.630> part<00:02:06.840> of<00:02:06.930> the<00:02:06.990> world's<00:02:07.200> most<00:02:07.290> you're

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
that part of the world's most you're

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.790 
that part of the world's most you're
catching<00:02:07.770> it<00:02:07.830> in<00:02:07.980> 25<00:02:08.429> years<00:02:08.460> so<00:02:09.179> I<00:02:09.800> think

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
catching it in 25 years so I think

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.280 
catching it in 25 years so I think
there's<00:02:10.979> enough<00:02:11.160> life<00:02:11.580> left<00:02:12.300> now<00:02:12.630> to<00:02:12.690> have<00:02:13.080> any

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
there's enough life left now to have any

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.770 
there's enough life left now to have any
sort<00:02:13.530> of<00:02:13.650> similar<00:02:14.100> kind<00:02:14.370> of<00:02:14.490> experience

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
sort of similar kind of experience

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.530 
sort of similar kind of experience
there's<00:02:15.780> a<00:02:15.840> sort<00:02:16.140> of<00:02:16.230> a<00:02:16.970> bit<00:02:17.970> of<00:02:18.090> masochism

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
there's a sort of a bit of masochism

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.480 
there's a sort of a bit of masochism
possibly<00:02:19.080> in<00:02:19.230> it<00:02:19.350> but<00:02:19.470> I<00:02:19.500> think<00:02:19.890> one<00:02:20.190> thing

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
possibly in it but I think one thing

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.180 
possibly in it but I think one thing
that's<00:02:20.610> very<00:02:20.730> significant<00:02:21.540> is<00:02:21.750> that<00:02:22.190> any

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
that's very significant is that any

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.640 
that's very significant is that any
achievement<00:02:24.090> is<00:02:24.270> directly<00:02:24.870> proportional<00:02:25.620> to

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
achievement is directly proportional to

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.140 
achievement is directly proportional to
the<00:02:25.830> amount<00:02:26.010> of<00:02:26.280> work<00:02:26.520> the<00:02:26.820> amount<00:02:26.850> of

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
the amount of work the amount of

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:28.580 
the amount of work the amount of
suffering<00:02:27.600> that<00:02:27.630> you've<00:02:27.900> been<00:02:28.110> through<00:02:28.410> so

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
suffering that you've been through so

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:29.660 
suffering that you've been through so
although<00:02:28.830> it<00:02:28.950> might<00:02:29.040> not<00:02:29.100> be<00:02:29.310> very<00:02:29.490> pleasant

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
although it might not be very pleasant

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.150 
although it might not be very pleasant
at<00:02:30.000> the<00:02:30.090> time<00:02:30.709> we'll<00:02:31.709> there<00:02:31.860> are<00:02:31.920> certainly

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
at the time we'll there are certainly

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.830 
at the time we'll there are certainly
moments<00:02:32.640> but<00:02:32.790> it's<00:02:32.910> looking<00:02:33.209> back<00:02:33.450> on<00:02:33.660> it<00:02:33.810> you

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
moments but it's looking back on it you

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.320 
moments but it's looking back on it you
think<00:02:34.200> yes<00:02:34.470> that<00:02:34.680> was<00:02:34.910> really<00:02:35.910> worth<00:02:36.060> doing

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
think yes that was really worth doing

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.440 
think yes that was really worth doing
think<00:02:37.020> about<00:02:37.200> the<00:02:37.590> fish<00:02:38.520> that<00:02:38.700> I<00:02:38.760> go<00:02:38.940> after<00:02:39.120> or

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
think about the fish that I go after or

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.210 
think about the fish that I go after or
most<00:02:39.660> of<00:02:39.810> them<00:02:39.959> is<00:02:40.140> the<00:02:40.260> fact<00:02:40.410> that<00:02:40.620> they<00:02:40.830> are

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
most of them is the fact that they are

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.810 
most of them is the fact that they are
the<00:02:42.000> hape<00:02:42.209> X<00:02:42.420> predators<00:02:42.930> and<00:02:43.350> the<00:02:44.340> good<00:02:44.610> thing

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
the hape X predators and the good thing

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.540 
the hape X predators and the good thing
about<00:02:44.850> catching<00:02:45.450> them<00:02:45.600> is<00:02:45.840> that<00:02:46.260> if<00:02:46.980> the<00:02:47.250> apex

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
about catching them is that if the apex

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.030 
about catching them is that if the apex
predator<00:02:47.940> is<00:02:48.060> now<00:02:48.209> it<00:02:48.420> shows<00:02:48.690> that<00:02:49.170> everything

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
predator is now it shows that everything

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.130 
predator is now it shows that everything
further<00:02:50.489> down<00:02:50.790> the<00:02:51.120> food<00:02:51.300> pyramid<00:02:51.510> is<00:02:51.840> also

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
further down the food pyramid is also

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.110 
further down the food pyramid is also
there<00:02:52.320> so<00:02:52.500> it's<00:02:52.620> a<00:02:52.709> very<00:02:52.739> very<00:02:53.160> good<00:02:53.430> sign<00:02:53.730> of

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
there so it's a very very good sign of

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.800 
there so it's a very very good sign of
the<00:02:54.540> health<00:02:54.720> of<00:02:55.410> a<00:02:55.890> river<00:02:56.100> I<00:02:56.459> often<00:02:57.390> say<00:02:57.570> that<00:02:57.600> a

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
the health of a river I often say that a

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.759 
the health of a river I often say that a
world<00:02:58.110> without<00:02:59.360> is<00:03:00.360> actually<00:03:00.810> more

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:01.769 
world without is actually more

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:05.060 
world without is actually more
frightening<00:03:02.280> in<00:03:02.550> a<00:03:02.640> world<00:03:02.850> with
