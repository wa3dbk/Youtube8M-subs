in<00:03:54.570> a<00:03:54.630> temperate<00:03:55.200> rainforest

00:03:59.309 --> 00:03:59.319 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:01.440 

I<00:03:59.409> figure<00:04:00.249> if<00:04:00.370> this<00:04:00.579> little<00:04:00.790> thing<00:04:01.090> can<00:04:01.269> work

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:01.450 
I figure if this little thing can work

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.989 
I figure if this little thing can work
here<00:04:01.950> it'll<00:04:02.950> probably<00:04:03.280> work<00:04:03.459> just<00:04:03.879> about

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:03.999 
here it'll probably work just about

00:04:03.999 --> 00:04:04.819 
here it'll probably work just about
anywhere

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:04.829 
anywhere
