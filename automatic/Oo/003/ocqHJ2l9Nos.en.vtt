00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
six inches it's going to be like a

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.280 
six inches it's going to be like a
wheelie<00:01:02.460> almost<00:01:02.850> at<00:01:03.059> first<00:01:03.329> but<00:01:03.899> I<00:01:03.960> just<00:01:04.110> want

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
wheelie almost at first but I just want

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.590 
wheelie almost at first but I just want
you<00:01:04.350> to<00:01:04.409> pull<00:01:05.040> up<00:01:05.159> and<00:01:05.369> put<00:01:05.820> it<00:01:05.909> down<00:01:08.600> so

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
you to pull up and put it down so

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.690 
you to pull up and put it down so
basically<00:01:09.930> just<00:01:10.020> do<00:01:10.380> that<00:01:10.590> you<00:01:11.220> need<00:01:11.340> to<00:01:11.400> do<00:01:11.580> is

basically just do that you need to do is

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:12.890 
basically just do that you need to do is
you<00:01:11.790> just<00:01:11.820> pull<00:01:12.090> up<00:01:12.119> on<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.390> handlebars<00:01:12.720> and

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
you just pull up on the handlebars and

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.390 
you just pull up on the handlebars and
kind<00:01:13.140> of<00:01:13.260> lean<00:01:13.409> back<00:01:13.439> on<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:13.830> pedals<00:01:14.159> and

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
kind of lean back on the pedals and

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.940 
kind of lean back on the pedals and
you'll<00:01:14.760> feel<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.090> bike<00:01:15.240> come<00:01:15.479> off<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.750> ground

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
you'll feel the bike come off the ground

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.340 
you'll feel the bike come off the ground
so<00:01:16.950> that's<00:01:17.070> going<00:01:17.220> to<00:01:17.280> be<00:01:17.400> your<00:01:17.520> first<00:01:17.700> section

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.350 
so that's going to be your first section

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.660 
so that's going to be your first section
once<00:01:19.350> you<00:01:19.500> get<00:01:19.650> that<00:01:19.770> down<00:01:19.950> that<00:01:20.250> should<00:01:20.520> be

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
once you get that down that should be

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.240 
once you get that down that should be
fairly<00:01:20.880> easy<00:01:21.150> to<00:01:21.270> actually<00:01:21.720> do<00:01:21.979> but<00:01:22.979> then<00:01:23.070> once

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
fairly easy to actually do but then once

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.260 
fairly easy to actually do but then once
you've<00:01:23.369> got<00:01:23.520> that<00:01:23.670> you<00:01:23.850> want<00:01:24.000> to<00:01:24.060> think<00:01:24.210> about

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
you've got that you want to think about

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.670 
you've got that you want to think about
getting<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:24.689> back<00:01:24.840> wheel<00:01:25.020> okay<00:01:25.259> now<00:01:25.320> this<00:01:25.530> is

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
getting the back wheel okay now this is

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:26.270 
getting the back wheel okay now this is
the<00:01:25.799> hard<00:01:26.009> bit

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
the hard bit

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.240 
the hard bit
I<00:01:26.460> find<00:01:27.000> that<00:01:27.270> to<00:01:27.479> go<00:01:27.750> along<00:01:28.110> and<00:01:28.350> just<00:01:28.950> lean

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
I find that to go along and just lean

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.390 
I find that to go along and just lean
over<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:29.970> bar<00:01:30.240> slightly<00:01:30.920> turn<00:01:31.920> your<00:01:31.950> wrists

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
over the bar slightly turn your wrists

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.520 
over the bar slightly turn your wrists
in<00:01:32.549> like<00:01:33.210> so<00:01:33.540> and<00:01:33.750> then<00:01:33.960> kind<00:01:34.200> of<00:01:34.290> you<00:01:34.380> want<00:01:34.439> to

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
in like so and then kind of you want to

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.800 
in like so and then kind of you want to
do<00:01:34.650> this<00:01:34.799> movement<00:01:35.270> and<00:01:36.270> that<00:01:36.450> will<00:01:36.600> enable

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
do this movement and that will enable

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.630 
do this movement and that will enable
you<00:01:37.170> also<00:01:37.439> to<00:01:37.650> sort<00:01:37.979> of<00:01:38.040> lean<00:01:38.189> forward<00:01:38.579> and

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
you also to sort of lean forward and

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.090 
you also to sort of lean forward and
make<00:01:38.820> yourself<00:01:39.270> light<00:01:39.780> on<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.110> pedals<00:01:40.439> make

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
make yourself light on the pedals make

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.889 
make yourself light on the pedals make
your<00:01:41.310> body<00:01:41.460> weight<00:01:41.729> kind<00:01:42.090> of<00:01:42.210> light<00:01:42.420> by<00:01:42.600> sort

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
your body weight kind of light by sort

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.840 
your body weight kind of light by sort
of<00:01:42.960> putting<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.070> weight<00:01:44.280> on<00:01:44.310> the<00:01:44.520> balls<00:01:44.700> of

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
of putting the weight on the balls of

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.490 
of putting the weight on the balls of
your<00:01:44.970> feet<00:01:45.210> but<00:01:45.420> pushing<00:01:45.659> forward<00:01:46.170> so<00:01:46.350> you're

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
your feet but pushing forward so you're

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.109 
your feet but pushing forward so you're
going<00:01:46.619> to<00:01:46.680> get<00:01:46.770> that<00:01:46.920> kind<00:01:47.159> of<00:01:47.250> effect<00:01:47.579> the

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
going to get that kind of effect the

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.280 
going to get that kind of effect the
opposite<00:01:48.479> of<00:01:48.509> what<00:01:48.689> you<00:01:48.780> was<00:01:48.899> doing<00:01:49.140> on<00:01:49.229> the

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
opposite of what you was doing on the

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.240 
opposite of what you was doing on the
front<00:01:51.020> so<00:01:52.020> once<00:01:52.170> you've<00:01:52.350> got<00:01:52.500> that<00:01:52.649> down<00:01:52.920> you

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
front so once you've got that down you

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.380 
front so once you've got that down you
now<00:01:53.369> know<00:01:53.579> that<00:01:53.729> you<00:01:53.820> can<00:01:53.939> get<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.180> front

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
now know that you can get the front

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:55.760 
now know that you can get the front
wheel<00:01:54.540> off<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:54.720> ground<00:01:54.840> independently<00:01:55.649> and

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
wheel off the ground independently and

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.370 
wheel off the ground independently and
also<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.130> back<00:01:56.280> wheel<00:01:56.719> now<00:01:57.719> as<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:57.960> key<00:01:58.140> is<00:01:58.290> to

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
also the back wheel now as the key is to

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.109 
also the back wheel now as the key is to
actually<00:01:58.469> put<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:58.829> two<00:01:59.009> together<00:01:59.189> now<00:01:59.939> for

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
actually put the two together now for

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.280 
actually put the two together now for
this<00:02:00.210> you<00:02:00.329> need<00:02:00.450> to<00:02:00.570> kind<00:02:00.689> of<00:02:00.780> spring<00:02:01.079> load

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
this you need to kind of spring load

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.639 
this you need to kind of spring load
your<00:02:01.439> body<00:02:02.180> so<00:02:03.180> you<00:02:03.840> want<00:02:04.049> to<00:02:04.110> kind<00:02:04.229> of<00:02:04.380> like

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
your body so you want to kind of like

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.770 
your body so you want to kind of like
crouch<00:02:05.460> as<00:02:05.700> if<00:02:05.850> you're<00:02:05.969> going<00:02:06.119> to<00:02:06.210> pop

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
crouch as if you're going to pop

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.869 
crouch as if you're going to pop
yourself<00:02:06.930> up<00:02:07.409> but<00:02:08.340> you<00:02:08.429> want<00:02:08.580> to<00:02:08.610> make<00:02:08.759> sure

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
yourself up but you want to make sure

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.580 
yourself up but you want to make sure
the<00:02:09.000> bike<00:02:09.179> comes<00:02:09.390> up<00:02:09.599> with<00:02:09.780> you<00:02:10.020> it's<00:02:10.530> very

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
the bike comes up with you it's very

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.800 
the bike comes up with you it's very
easy<00:02:10.979> to<00:02:11.129> pop<00:02:11.520> yourself<00:02:11.910> up

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
easy to pop yourself up

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.510 
easy to pop yourself up
and<00:02:12.900> then<00:02:13.170> nothing<00:02:13.350> happens<00:02:13.800> you'll<00:02:14.069> go<00:02:14.280> up<00:02:14.340> at

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
and then nothing happens you'll go up at

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.630 
and then nothing happens you'll go up at
the<00:02:14.610> bike<00:02:14.790> road<00:02:15.090> so<00:02:15.810> you<00:02:15.840> need<00:02:16.200> to<00:02:16.319> actually

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
the bike road so you need to actually

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.130 
the bike road so you need to actually
get<00:02:17.640> in<00:02:17.790> the<00:02:17.880> right<00:02:18.030> position<00:02:18.540> and<00:02:18.720> make<00:02:18.930> sure

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
get in the right position and make sure

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:20.720 
get in the right position and make sure
that<00:02:19.410> you've<00:02:19.560> got<00:02:19.590> the<00:02:19.800> right<00:02:19.920> preload<00:02:20.430> going

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
that you've got the right preload going

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.730 
that you've got the right preload going
on<00:02:20.850> and<00:02:21.030> it's<00:02:21.810> going<00:02:21.990> to<00:02:22.050> come<00:02:22.230> up<00:02:22.380> and<00:02:22.560> now<00:02:22.680> to

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
on and it's going to come up and now to

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.500 
on and it's going to come up and now to
come<00:02:23.010> up<00:02:23.130> together<00:02:23.310> you're<00:02:24.120> going<00:02:24.240> to<00:02:24.300> need<00:02:24.420> to

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
come up together you're going to need to

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.840 
come up together you're going to need to
do<00:02:24.630> the<00:02:24.750> front<00:02:25.020> bit<00:02:25.230> as<00:02:25.380> well<00:02:25.590> but<00:02:26.459> as<00:02:26.580> you<00:02:26.730> do

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
do the front bit as well but as you do

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:28.220 
do the front bit as well but as you do
the<00:02:26.970> front<00:02:27.180> bit<00:02:27.360> you<00:02:27.510> want<00:02:27.569> to<00:02:27.660> press<00:02:27.870> down<00:02:27.900> the

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
the front bit you want to press down the

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.460 
the front bit you want to press down the
pedals<00:02:28.590> and<00:02:28.770> kind<00:02:29.370> of<00:02:29.489> hop<00:02:30.080> pressing<00:02:31.080> dig<00:02:31.290> into

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
pedals and kind of hop pressing dig into

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:32.840 
pedals and kind of hop pressing dig into
the<00:02:31.620> pedal<00:02:31.950> so<00:02:32.069> the<00:02:32.160> back<00:02:32.310> of<00:02:32.430> the<00:02:32.489> bike<00:02:32.610> comes

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
the pedal so the back of the bike comes

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.880 
the pedal so the back of the bike comes
up<00:02:33.030> at<00:02:33.150> the<00:02:33.180> same<00:02:33.480> time<00:02:33.780> as<00:02:33.930> the<00:02:34.050> front<00:02:34.290> so<00:02:34.800> it's

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
up at the same time as the front so it's

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.270 
up at the same time as the front so it's
virtually<00:02:35.010> going<00:02:35.790> to<00:02:35.880> do<00:02:36.000> that<00:02:36.739> at<00:02:37.739> first<00:02:37.980> it

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
virtually going to do that at first it

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.170 
virtually going to do that at first it
will<00:02:38.340> probably<00:02:38.610> go<00:02:38.730> all<00:02:39.230> over<00:02:40.230> the<00:02:40.620> place<00:02:40.800> but

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
will probably go all over the place but

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.940 
will probably go all over the place but
eventually<00:02:42.180> when<00:02:42.630> you<00:02:42.690> get<00:02:42.780> it<00:02:42.900> right<00:02:43.020> it<00:02:43.830> will

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
eventually when you get it right it will

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.050 
eventually when you get it right it will
come<00:02:44.100> up<00:02:44.160> together<00:02:44.310> and<00:02:44.700> it<00:02:44.820> will<00:02:44.910> land

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
come up together and it will land

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.120 
come up together and it will land
together<00:02:45.709> and<00:02:46.709> that<00:02:47.310> is<00:02:47.610> your<00:02:47.850> basic<00:02:48.000> bunnyhop

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
together and that is your basic bunnyhop

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.970 
together and that is your basic bunnyhop
then<00:02:50.130> obviously<00:02:50.280> the<00:02:50.970> more<00:02:51.180> you<00:02:51.300> do<00:02:51.450> that<00:02:51.480> the

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
then obviously the more you do that the

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.050 
then obviously the more you do that the
better<00:02:52.980> you'll<00:02:53.130> get<00:02:53.250> it<00:02:53.400> and<00:02:53.610> so<00:02:53.730> the<00:02:53.850> higher

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
better you'll get it and so the higher

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.479 
better you'll get it and so the higher
the<00:02:54.090> object<00:02:54.630> you<00:02:54.750> can<00:02:54.930> actually<00:02:55.190> try<00:02:56.190> and<00:02:56.220> jump

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
the object you can actually try and jump

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:00.199 
the object you can actually try and jump
over<00:02:56.670> etc<00:02:57.680> so<00:02:58.680> it<00:02:59.040> should<00:02:59.370> all<00:02:59.489> work<00:02:59.670> out<00:02:59.970> if

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
over etc so it should all work out if

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:01.699 
over etc so it should all work out if
you<00:03:00.360> stick<00:03:00.569> to<00:03:00.600> those<00:03:00.810> fundamentals<00:03:01.560> on<00:03:01.620> the

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
you stick to those fundamentals on the

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:05.510 
you stick to those fundamentals on the
trick<00:03:01.950> it<00:03:02.430> should<00:03:02.670> all<00:03:02.790> pan<00:03:03.030> out<00:03:03.180> in<00:03:03.300> the<00:03:03.390> end
