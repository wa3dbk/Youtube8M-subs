00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.010 

this<00:00:56.350> one<00:00:56.700> really<00:00:57.700> it<00:00:57.970> stays<00:00:58.300> in<00:00:58.480> the<00:00:58.570> shape<00:00:58.840> it

00:00:59.010 --> 00:00:59.020 
this one really it stays in the shape it

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:00.810 
this one really it stays in the shape it
was<00:00:59.050> before<00:00:59.559> the<00:00:59.890> only<00:01:00.040> thing<00:01:00.280> that<00:01:00.399> changes

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:00.820 
was before the only thing that changes

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:30.880 
was before the only thing that changes
is<00:01:01.030> it<00:01:01.450> gets<00:01:01.629> bigger<00:01:03.150> next<00:01:04.150> we<00:01:04.420> will<00:01:04.570> try

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.980 

look<00:01:31.890> at<00:01:32.040> that<00:01:32.369> it<00:01:32.610> only<00:01:32.790> goes<00:01:33.090> like<00:01:33.210> flat<00:01:33.780> out

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
look at that it only goes like flat out

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:34.960 
look at that it only goes like flat out
like<00:01:34.229> that

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:34.970 
like that

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.639 
like that
like<00:01:35.970> that<00:01:36.299> it<00:01:36.450> seems<00:01:36.780> like<00:01:36.869> that<00:01:37.200> would<00:01:37.439> just

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:37.649 
like that it seems like that would just

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:59.180 
like that it seems like that would just
cause<00:01:38.130> wings<00:01:43.970> plate<00:01:44.970> export

00:01:59.180 --> 00:01:59.190 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.330 

look<00:02:00.190> at<00:02:00.310> that<00:02:00.660> and<00:02:01.660> it's<00:02:02.080> true<00:02:02.650> what<00:02:02.830> they<00:02:02.890> say

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
look at that and it's true what they say

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:08.390 
look at that and it's true what they say
as<00:02:03.990> 360<00:02:04.990> degree<00:02:05.350> protection<00:02:06.270> so<00:02:07.270> overall<00:02:07.600> I

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:08.400 
as 360 degree protection so overall I

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:10.500 
as 360 degree protection so overall I
think<00:02:09.400> that<00:02:09.790> Playtex

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:10.510 
think that Playtex

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:13.740 
think that Playtex
is<00:02:10.660> the<00:02:11.500> most<00:02:11.680> protective<00:02:12.190> and<00:02:12.460> is<00:02:13.330> the<00:02:13.600> winner

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
is the most protective and is the winner

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.040 
is the most protective and is the winner
