00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.389
 now every day we talk about 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:05.879
 learn not to have them bring them a new 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:06.750
 video I'll explain some commands 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.660
 of the console 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.980
 I decided to leave it for another video I'm not going to 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.349
 be climbing as fast as possible 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.610
 after the next because the previous 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.020
 I have already lengthened and I do not want to do 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.090
 a 40 minute video to explain 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.449
 how to set the ninth place nobody 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.369
 so first the first things go to 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.180
 rid and the game and mayor has to 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.930
 appear all the games that have 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.960
 I have to return eses 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:33.560
 they went to where I was right clicking 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:37.280
 adopted two properties are going to be land 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:39.250
 options and I have these commands the most 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.780
 important of the entire script consoles and 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:44.390
 because that will allow him to be able to 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:47.960
 access the console I have no life 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:49.489
 which is not to see they saw when they open 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.410
 He gives them a fat man with a 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:53.930
 screw in the head once that's not what 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:57.070
 they are going to see and it's international because 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.070
 I was watching the merlin video and 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.510
 and what it's called and what has it has it 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.030
 configured so I really liked it 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.890
 very much that now they will see when 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.560
 we opened the game so they put there was no 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.630
 international consul to the only important 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.940
 it's console if they like to see the fat man that 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.530
 every time they open the game and they are not 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.750
 After that is good not put love 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.640
 do not go up and if you love how it is 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.700
 distribute the interface of the dota so 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.880
 they put york international that we're going to 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.740
 see or key close here 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.780
 I'm going to play and here is open to 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.420
 gifted and noticed when you what 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.610
 they opened that he did not jump the fat man did not 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:34.610
 He passed the blue screen appears 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.679
 more copada and it 's me so I already believe 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.149
 a game to make it shorter as 

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:40.850
 you can see here I am with the game with 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:43.789
 pop and we're going to bring the console if not 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:46.960
 come in the last video the console is 

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:46.960
 You can change from 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.070
 goal controls of jean-jacques to the 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.050
 consoles hello I have a script that is a 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.310
 key I do not use much and usually the 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:58.670
 they want to have a key 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.650
 in the previous game this is not going to 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:05.000
 to be using almost never will I show it 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:06.890
 to two interesting commands that is for 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.300
 can order with right click and to 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.600
 can increase the size of the faces 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:15.680
 of the minimum so that the command 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:18.340
 is writing so low force or down 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.340
 radio 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:25.820
 dash under attack space 1 far away inter 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:28.310
 and there it is perfect now you can go to the 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:30.030
 note and can earn with right click to 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:33.390
 report 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:35.220
 you can not deny only 50% day 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:38.210
 by marley from right click I'm giving 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:40.550
 right where you will tighten your shoulders 

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:42.710
 so they can look directly with 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:44.569
 right click let's go see some 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:47.250
 plus 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:48.930
 and you will not let me 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.690
 they're going to hit the tower and I'm going to 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.900
 try to eat what I can try to deny 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.610
 A) Yes 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.960
 but you can see that I'm attacking 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:59.790
 without having 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:01.760
 without having as a flame you have to 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.470
 tightening the or nothing is much easier to 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:07.260
 Deny by sea also the stop key 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.940
 I can send many phrases of nava 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.500
 can generate it with right click and 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.090
 then another command that is also 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.500
 interesting for beginners with 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.110
 put here the face of the hero very 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:19.040
 little girl how can they give can go to 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:20.960
 the console back and put 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:26.170
 Where is 

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:26.170
 It is not low minimum 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:32.190
 and a bass 6 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:36.510
 and here 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:38.280
 6 expected 6 spaces the default of 600 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.200
 we put the size you want to the 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.480
 caritas of the minimap for example we are going to 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.580
 put something ridiculous like 1200 that is 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.810
 a gigantic size that by agreeing to 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:47.490
 minimum they can see min in the sentry box 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:50.080
 from the post that I said before here we are going to 

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:54.490
 put something more ridiculous 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:56.850
 low minimum a low book 

00:03:54.490 --> 00:04:00.870
 and down 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:04.410
 6 space we are going to copy this for 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:06.410
 jonathan and describe the 2,800 well 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:08.340
 ridiculous and put the vintage face and 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:09.270
 monstrously large occupies almost all 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.170
 the screen 

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:12.690
 I know you are just beginning 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:14.820
 I recommend that you give them something 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:16.590
 big as a thousand for example I'm going to 

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:18.090
 put a thousand 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:20.730
 I close the console and can see a 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.989
 monstrously big face because that's how 

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:24.180
 allows them with a look at the map of 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:25.740
 where are you every time you just start 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:28.500
 what matters is whether the 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:29.610
 development in the middle or below if I know 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.830
 have well large faces them 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:34.110
 important as they learn from 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:36.510
 play what do I know what I know a month ago 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:38.970
 two months recommended that the faces 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:40.169
 smaller walks because because in 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:42.600
 an ink and can not see absolutely 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:44.460
 no mini-map imagine if 10 

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:47.639
 faces of this size can not be seen 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:50.130
 nothing I usually default I'll 

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:52.590
 put the one of lack that they compare 600 

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:54.360
 perfect is the default the sentry boxes very 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:56.700
 chiquitita is not good for 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:05:00.050
 I usually prefer to put it in 

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:01.669
 they call 700 I'm putting it now 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:03.169
 way to miss a little bit of 

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:06.009
 power is a little bigger the face 

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:09.169
 because you lose a little bit of vision 

00:05:06.009 --> 00:05:10.699
 because the very big face can see 

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:13.340
 very easily where is 

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:16.099
 each hero that are the two commands that 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:18.199
 what's the name I'm using now 

00:05:16.099 --> 00:05:21.409
 the next step is to make 

00:05:18.199 --> 00:05:22.610
 these two commands remain despite 

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:25.009
 that you close the capped and if 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:27.530
 you do not have to put it every time 

00:05:25.009 --> 00:05:28.610
 call every time they start the game like this 

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:30.229
 that I will be applying how to do 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:32.930
 so that these commands remain 

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:34.610
 matter put commands so as 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:36.440
 altavilla endows them with Abidal is 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:40.250
 seeing is so you have to go 

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:41.629
 to this folder I have it in the folder 

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:44.300
 of steam and they have to go I have in the 

00:05:41.629 --> 00:05:46.370
 disc c program files by 86 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:47.750
 skin I have it you have to go to 

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:50.120
 the destination folder matters where they have 

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:54.620
 installed after ana este pge as 

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:55.909
 beta gifted cfg sf who distrusts and 

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:58.400
 there they will appear these things that 

00:05:55.909 --> 00:06:00.759
 come here so what do you have 

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.759
 what to do is 

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:06.400
 I have that ready 

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:08.110
 they were a text file like this one 

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:10.210
 of notes and write the commands that 

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:12.310
 they want you to want to put us in our 

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:13.780
 case would be 2 force live leak space 

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:16.930
 one to be able to deny with right click 

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:20.800
 and enter and below they put minimum but 

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:24.189
 there are 700 so they keep it and then 

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:28.569
 they give it the name auto exc 

00:06:24.189 --> 00:06:29.930
 that is, spelling to you x 

00:06:28.569 --> 00:06:32.210
 c 

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:35.449
 and then they grab and they change the 

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:38.060
 extension that to put like this x that the 

00:06:35.449 --> 00:06:42.560
 they have to change for cfg and they will 

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:43.910
 to be something like this auto expekt.com not 

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:46.729
 matter if it tells you that you can damage the 

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:48.949
 file does not matter and it's that file what 

00:06:46.729 --> 00:06:50.509
 die they put it in the folder later to 

00:06:48.949 --> 00:06:51.620
 a kilo go and power and now every time 

00:06:50.509 --> 00:06:54.050
 that open the dow are going to have 

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:56.410
 configured with those two commands me in 

00:06:54.050 --> 00:07:00.139
 the description of the video being putting 

00:06:56.410 --> 00:07:02.180
 a link to the gamers in which they explain 

00:07:00.139 --> 00:07:03.740
 several more commands that you can put are 

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:05.270
 pretty useful things and they only have them 

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:07.960
 that set up once so good 

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:07.960
 progress has liked
