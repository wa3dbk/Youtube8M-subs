particular attention to our edge loops
here's<00:00:14.429> the<00:00:14.549> head<00:00:14.670> we're<00:00:14.849> gonna<00:00:14.940> be<00:00:15.089> making

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:16.670 
here's the head we're gonna be making

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:19.040 
here's the head we're gonna be making
and<00:00:17.670> after<00:00:18.150> we<00:00:18.240> get<00:00:18.359> done<00:00:18.420> with<00:00:18.660> this<00:00:18.779> since

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
and after we get done with this since

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.320 
and after we get done with this since
we're<00:00:19.289> gonna<00:00:19.560> keep<00:00:19.980> it<00:00:20.130> all<00:00:20.220> quads<00:00:20.520> it's<00:00:21.119> going

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
we're gonna keep it all quads it's going

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:22.640 
we're gonna keep it all quads it's going
to<00:00:21.390> be<00:00:21.449> really<00:00:21.689> well-behaved<00:00:22.199> and<00:00:22.410> we<00:00:22.470> can

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
to be really well-behaved and we can

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.050 
to be really well-behaved and we can
adjust<00:00:22.740> it<00:00:23.130> and<00:00:23.220> change<00:00:23.640> it<00:00:23.699> into<00:00:23.880> whatever

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
adjust it and change it into whatever

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.120 
adjust it and change it into whatever
you<00:00:24.269> want<00:00:24.420> for<00:00:25.050> an<00:00:25.140> example<00:00:25.470> of<00:00:25.619> this<00:00:25.800> I

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
you want for an example of this I

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.040 
you want for an example of this I
changed<00:00:27.119> him<00:00:27.240> into<00:00:27.480> this<00:00:29.060> okay<00:00:30.060> let's<00:00:30.960> get

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
changed him into this okay let's get

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:37.630 
changed him into this okay let's get
started<00:00:32.809> first<00:00:33.809> thing<00:00:33.930> let's<00:00:34.440> create<00:00:34.829> a<00:00:34.890> box

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:37.640 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.540 

it's<00:00:38.640> going<00:00:38.850> up<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.480> segment's<00:00:40.190> to<00:00:41.190> three<00:00:41.430> on

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
it's going up the segment's to three on

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:50.209 
it's going up the segment's to three on
each<00:00:44.629> refer<00:00:45.629> to<00:00:45.960> an<00:00:46.170> editable<00:00:46.469> poly<00:00:49.219> show

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
each refer to an editable poly show

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.709 
each refer to an editable poly show
edged<00:00:50.430> faces<00:00:50.730> take<00:00:51.360> off<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.629> grid<00:00:51.870> okay<00:00:53.719> we're

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
edged faces take off the grid okay we're

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.060 
edged faces take off the grid okay we're
gonna<00:00:54.840> have<00:00:55.110> to<00:00:55.199> make<00:00:55.320> this<00:00:55.500> round<00:00:55.770> almost

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
gonna have to make this round almost

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:02.540 
gonna have to make this round almost
like<00:00:56.340> a<00:00:56.370> circle<00:00:58.520> quick<00:00:59.520> way<00:00:59.670> to<00:00:59.730> do<00:00:59.940> that<00:01:01.550> is

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
like a circle quick way to do that is

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:10.510 
like a circle quick way to do that is
just<00:01:02.760> to<00:01:02.879> scale<00:01:03.120> up<00:01:03.270> all<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.510> center<00:01:03.809> verts

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.880 

okay<00:01:11.520> there's<00:01:11.790> a<00:01:11.850> start<00:01:12.090> important<00:01:12.680> we<00:01:13.680> can

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
okay there's a start important we can

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.770 
okay there's a start important we can
change<00:01:14.369> this<00:01:14.549> into<00:01:14.729> a<00:01:14.820> subdivision<00:01:15.210> surface

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
change this into a subdivision surface

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.890 
change this into a subdivision surface
so<00:01:15.960> we<00:01:16.049> can<00:01:16.170> see<00:01:16.380> our<00:01:16.470> changes<00:01:17.420> in<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.570> smooth

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
so we can see our changes in the smooth

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:29.690 
so we can see our changes in the smooth
version<00:01:24.710> sad<00:01:25.710> nice<00:01:26.070> smooth<00:01:26.340> modifier<00:01:28.700> you

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
version sad nice smooth modifier you

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.399 
version sad nice smooth modifier you
notice<00:01:29.880> when<00:01:30.000> you<00:01:30.060> come<00:01:30.240> down<00:01:30.270> here<00:01:32.240> actually

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:33.409 
notice when you come down here actually

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:37.010 
notice when you come down here actually
add<00:01:34.409> span<00:01:34.740> durations<00:01:35.189> first<00:01:35.570> just<00:01:36.570> one<00:01:36.750> and

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
add span durations first just one and

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.539 
add span durations first just one and
we'll<00:01:37.110> do<00:01:37.229> some<00:01:37.380> red<00:01:37.530> and<00:01:37.710> render<00:01:38.130> in<00:01:38.280> duration

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
we'll do some red and render in duration

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.889 
we'll do some red and render in duration
so<00:01:39.060> four<00:01:39.270> three<00:01:40.790> okay<00:01:41.790> notice<00:01:42.390> how<00:01:42.479> smooth<00:01:42.750> it

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
so four three okay notice how smooth it

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.580 
so four three okay notice how smooth it
is<00:01:43.790> and<00:01:44.790> when<00:01:44.909> you<00:01:44.939> go<00:01:45.090> one<00:01:45.299> left<00:01:45.600> down<00:01:45.869> change

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
is and when you go one left down change

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.590 
is and when you go one left down change
it<00:01:46.680> to<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:46.860> hard<00:01:47.009> version<00:01:47.159> if<00:01:48.060> you<00:01:48.119> click<00:01:48.390> this

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
it to the hard version if you click this

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.340 
it to the hard version if you click this
it<00:01:49.130> shows<00:01:50.130> you<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:50.579> top<00:01:51.450> everything<00:01:51.960> applied

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
it shows you the top everything applied

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.539 
it shows you the top everything applied
and<00:01:53.250> you<00:01:53.610> can<00:01:53.759> adjust<00:01:53.939> things<00:01:55.219> and<00:01:56.219> see<00:01:56.430> the

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
and you can adjust things and see the

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:03.740 
and you can adjust things and see the
boulders<00:01:56.939> in<00:01:57.090> real<00:01:57.240> time

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.570 

notice<00:02:04.750> how<00:02:04.840> this<00:02:04.960> model<00:02:05.290> has<00:02:05.500> all<00:02:06.190> quads

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:06.580 
notice how this model has all quads

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.870 
notice how this model has all quads
right<00:02:06.820> now<00:02:08.340> we're<00:02:09.340> going<00:02:09.460> to<00:02:09.520> try<00:02:09.640> to<00:02:09.700> maintain

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:09.880 
right now we're going to try to maintain

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.120 
right now we're going to try to maintain
this<00:02:10.330> and<00:02:10.630> the<00:02:11.530> way<00:02:11.590> we're<00:02:11.740> going<00:02:11.830> to<00:02:11.920> do<00:02:12.010> that

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
this and the way we're going to do that

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:16.230 
this and the way we're going to do that
is<00:02:12.370> if<00:02:12.640> we<00:02:12.760> only<00:02:13.030> extrude<00:02:14.580> you<00:02:15.580> notice<00:02:15.790> how<00:02:15.940> we

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:16.240 
is if we only extrude you notice how we

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.010 
is if we only extrude you notice how we
still<00:02:16.300> have<00:02:16.540> all<00:02:16.690> quads<00:02:18.510> so<00:02:19.510> we<00:02:19.750> only<00:02:19.870> do

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 
still have all quads so we only do

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:24.540 
still have all quads so we only do
extrude<00:02:20.380> operations<00:02:21.210> no<00:02:22.210> cuts<00:02:23.430> and<00:02:24.430> then

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
extrude operations no cuts and then

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:30.660 
extrude operations no cuts and then
we'll<00:02:24.700> keep<00:02:24.850> a<00:02:25.060> quad<00:02:25.630> model<00:02:27.690> okay<00:02:29.580> first<00:02:30.580> I

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
we'll keep a quad model okay first I

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:31.950 
we'll keep a quad model okay first I
need<00:02:30.700> to<00:02:30.850> explain<00:02:31.180> a<00:02:31.240> couple<00:02:31.480> things<00:02:31.720> right

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:31.960 
need to explain a couple things right

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:33.650 
need to explain a couple things right
now<00:02:32.170> that<00:02:32.320> I'm<00:02:32.380> going<00:02:32.530> to<00:02:32.590> be<00:02:32.680> talking<00:02:33.310> about

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
now that I'm going to be talking about

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.480 
now that I'm going to be talking about
that<00:02:34.660> might<00:02:34.840> say<00:02:35.020> edge<00:02:35.230> loops<00:02:35.500> a<00:02:35.620> lot<00:02:35.770> and<00:02:36.220> what

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:36.490 
that might say edge loops a lot and what

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:39.150 
that might say edge loops a lot and what
they<00:02:36.640> are<00:02:36.820> let's<00:02:37.360> see<00:02:37.480> how<00:02:37.540> these<00:02:37.690> edges<00:02:38.160> they

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
they are let's see how these edges they

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.400 
they are let's see how these edges they
loop<00:02:39.430> all<00:02:39.670> the<00:02:39.910> way<00:02:40.000> around<00:02:40.300> and<00:02:40.990> connect<00:02:41.290> back

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
loop all the way around and connect back

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.740 
loop all the way around and connect back
to<00:02:41.560> themselves<00:02:42.090> okay<00:02:43.090> those<00:02:43.300> are<00:02:43.330> called<00:02:43.570> edge

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
and it makes sense because if you look

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.330 
and it makes sense because if you look

they're circular around the eyes and
around<00:03:30.220> the<00:03:30.370> mouth<00:03:32.220> and<00:03:33.220> that's<00:03:33.640> what<00:03:33.820> gives

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
around the mouth and that's what gives

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:39.180 
around the mouth and that's what gives
the<00:03:34.630> real<00:03:34.810> face<00:03:35.080> its<00:03:35.850> animate<00:03:36.850> ability<00:03:38.190> wow

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
that's a big word I think it just made

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:43.770 
that's a big word I think it just made
it<00:03:40.480> up<00:03:40.720> okay

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780

some<00:03:44.080> hotkeys<00:03:44.500> I'm<00:03:44.620> going<00:03:44.739> to<00:03:44.800> be<00:03:44.860> using<00:03:45.160> all

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
some hotkeys I'm going to be using all

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.580 
some hotkeys I'm going to be using all
the<00:03:45.400> time<00:03:45.610> okay<00:03:46.360> W<00:03:46.750> switches<00:03:47.110> to<00:03:47.260> the<00:03:47.290> Move

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:47.590 
the time okay W switches to the Move

this<00:03:51.970> scale<00:03:53.010> Q<00:03:54.010> is<00:03:54.280> select<00:03:54.940> that<00:03:55.330> just<00:03:55.540> gets

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:55.690 
this scale Q is select that just gets

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:56.790 
this scale Q is select that just gets
rid<00:03:55.840> of<00:03:55.870> the<00:03:55.959> gizmo<00:03:56.260> so<00:03:56.440> you<00:03:56.530> can<00:03:56.650> select

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:56.800 
rid of the gizmo so you can select

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:03.660 
rid of the gizmo so you can select
things<00:03:57.040> easier<00:03:58.380> okay<00:03:59.380> and<00:04:00.040> also<00:04:02.310> just<00:04:03.310> like<00:04:03.430> to

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670 
things easier okay and also just like to

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:05.790 
things easier okay and also just like to
face<00:04:03.850> and<00:04:04.090> hit<00:04:04.209> alt<00:04:04.420> e<00:04:04.780> that'll<00:04:05.410> change<00:04:05.590> to

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:05.800 
face and hit alt e that'll change to

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:09.509 
face and hit alt e that'll change to
your<00:04:05.890> extrude<00:04:07.350> okay<00:04:08.350> if<00:04:08.560> you<00:04:08.680> go<00:04:08.859> to<00:04:08.920> edge<00:04:09.489> mode

00:04:09.509 --> 00:04:09.519 
your extrude okay if you go to edge mode

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:12.569 
your extrude okay if you go to edge mode
and<00:04:10.390> you<00:04:10.720> do<00:04:10.840> alt<00:04:11.109> see<00:04:11.560> that'll<00:04:12.130> change<00:04:12.310> to<00:04:12.489> the

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:12.579 
and you do alt see that'll change to the

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:13.710 
and you do alt see that'll change to the

can<00:04:14.720> we're<00:04:14.810> gonna<00:04:14.900> try<00:04:15.080> not<00:04:15.230> to<00:04:15.380> use<00:04:15.470> that<00:04:15.740> we

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.250 
can we're gonna try not to use that we

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.699 
can we're gonna try not to use that we

need to use that sometimes just a

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:22.300 
need to use that sometimes just a

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:28.780 
quads and I also changed one thing I

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:33.220 
quads and I also changed one thing I
added<00:04:29.780> my<00:04:29.900> own<00:04:29.930> custom<00:04:30.440> hotkey<00:04:31.120> alt<00:04:32.120> T<00:04:32.420> and

that's target weld okay that's all the
hotkeys<00:04:38.720> I'm<00:04:38.840> gonna<00:04:38.960> be<00:04:39.080> using
