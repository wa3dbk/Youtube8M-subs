00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
see where they went away to perform and

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.790 
see where they went away to perform and
compared<00:00:15.610> with<00:00:15.730> the<00:00:15.879> other<00:00:15.910> competitors<00:00:16.800> and

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:24.820 
started to run out of strains or he's

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.689 
started to run out of strains or he's
maintaining<00:00:25.390> or<00:00:25.810> so<00:00:26.410> you<00:00:26.470> kind<00:00:26.890> of<00:00:26.919> naturally

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:31.060 
the race during the inner race I can do

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.230 
the race during the inner race I can do
detailer<00:00:31.390> i<00:00:31.539> can<00:00:31.720> use<00:00:32.200> afterwards<00:00:33.090> but<00:00:34.090> i<00:00:34.150> know

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:34.240 
detailer i can use afterwards but i know

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.540 
detailer i can use afterwards but i know
beforehand<00:00:35.050> I<00:00:35.140> know<00:00:35.290> what<00:00:35.500> cannabis<00:00:35.860> could

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:36.550 
beforehand I know what cannabis could

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:39.030 
beforehand I know what cannabis could
expect<00:00:36.820> from<00:00:36.970> him<00:00:37.260> but<00:00:38.260> these<00:00:38.470> days<00:00:38.650> is<00:00:38.800> good

expect from him but these days is good
to<00:00:39.160> correct<00:00:39.460> something<00:00:39.640> afterwards<00:00:40.210> in<00:00:40.690> the

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:40.870 
to correct something afterwards in the

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:43.470 
to correct something afterwards in the
race<00:00:41.050> racing<00:00:41.590> I<00:00:41.830> cannot<00:00:42.130> use<00:00:42.280> this<00:00:42.490> data<00:00:42.730> ya

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:43.480 
race racing I cannot use this data ya

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.260 
race racing I cannot use this data ya
know<00:00:43.660> but<00:00:43.840> for<00:00:44.050> training<00:00:44.320> they're<00:00:44.500> perfect

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
know but for training they're perfect

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.250 
know but for training they're perfect
training<00:00:46.270> is<00:00:46.360> perfect<00:00:46.780> because<00:00:46.840> then<00:00:47.110> I<00:00:47.200> can

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:47.260 
training is perfect because then I can

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:52.040 
training is perfect because then I can
see<00:00:47.500> okay<00:00:47.880> he's<00:00:48.880> not<00:00:49.000> training<00:00:49.270> hard<00:00:49.510> enough

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.570 

trying<00:00:53.050> too<00:00:53.350> hard<00:00:53.380> so<00:00:53.770> we<00:00:53.800> don't<00:00:54.070> recover<00:00:54.310> to

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:54.580 
trying too hard so we don't recover to

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:56.190 
trying too hard so we don't recover to
the<00:00:54.700> race<00:00:54.850> so<00:00:55.270> he<00:00:55.360> comes<00:00:55.570> up<00:00:55.720> to<00:00:55.840> the<00:00:55.900> race<00:00:56.050> in

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:56.200 
the race so he comes up to the race in

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.050 
the race so he comes up to the race in
his<00:00:56.290> diet<00:00:56.560> and<00:00:56.860> I<00:00:57.100> can<00:00:57.250> see<00:00:57.400> on<00:00:57.520> the<00:00:57.640> train

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:58.060 
his diet and I can see on the train

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:00.300 
his diet and I can see on the train
races<00:00:58.570> as<00:00:58.690> you<00:00:58.840> know<00:00:59.020> he<00:00:59.620> works<00:00:59.800> too<00:00:59.950> hard<00:00:59.980> at

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:00.310 
races as you know he works too hard at

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:02.090 
races as you know he works too hard at
home<00:01:00.430> so<00:01:00.700> he's<00:01:00.850> tired<00:01:01.120> when<00:01:01.300> he<00:01:01.390> gets<00:01:01.540> to<00:01:01.660> erase

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
home so he's tired when he gets to erase

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.740 
home so he's tired when he gets to erase
or<00:01:03.100> I<00:01:03.160> can<00:01:03.640> see<00:01:03.790> on<00:01:03.910> the<00:01:04.000> curb<00:01:04.239> that<00:01:04.269> he's<00:01:04.600> never

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:04.750 
or I can see on the curb that he's never

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:07.830 
or I can see on the curb that he's never
gotten<00:01:05.019> up<00:01:05.290> to<00:01:05.320> his<00:01:05.590> maximum<00:01:06.340> limit<00:01:06.700> so<00:01:07.540> don't

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:07.840 
gotten up to his maximum limit so don't

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.570 
gotten up to his maximum limit so don't
work<00:01:07.960> hard<00:01:08.140> enough<00:01:08.229> when<00:01:08.560> he's<00:01:08.680> training<00:01:09.009> so

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:09.580 
work hard enough when he's training so

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:10.620 
work hard enough when he's training so
that's<00:01:09.759> why<00:01:09.880> he<00:01:10.000> can<00:01:10.180> reach<00:01:10.420> this<00:01:10.570> level

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:10.630 
that's why he can reach this level

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.050 
that's why he can reach this level
highest<00:01:11.229> level<00:01:11.499> when<00:01:11.619> he's<00:01:11.740> raising<00:01:11.979> so<00:01:12.909> we

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.060 
highest level when he's raising so we

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.239 
highest level when he's raising so we
get<00:01:13.210> is<00:01:13.420> very<00:01:13.659> valuable<00:01:13.810> to<00:01:14.229> see<00:01:14.679> the<00:01:14.829> station

00:01:15.239 --> 00:01:15.249 
get is very valuable to see the station

00:01:15.249 --> 00:01:16.460 
get is very valuable to see the station
so

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
so

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.940 
so
the<00:01:17.220> computer<00:01:17.640> is<00:01:18.140> okay<00:01:19.140> is<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.470> problem<00:01:19.830> for

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
the computer is okay is the problem for

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.870 
the computer is okay is the problem for
the<00:01:20.040> mechanics<00:01:20.930> timing<00:01:21.930> is<00:01:22.050> perfect<00:01:23.010> is<00:01:23.490> in

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
the mechanics timing is perfect is in

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:34.660 
the mechanics timing is perfect is in
one<00:01:24.510> computers<00:01:26.240> for<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.770> gardens<00:01:29.660> speed

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.920 

before<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:35.850> bots<00:01:36.800> hissing<00:01:37.800> creo<00:01:38.750> after<00:01:39.750> in

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
before the bots hissing creo after in

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.950 
before the bots hissing creo after in
the<00:01:40.080> computer<00:01:40.680> you<00:01:41.550> is<00:01:42.180> possible<00:01:42.690> you<00:01:42.780> the

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
the computer you is possible you the

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.530 
the computer you is possible you the
look<00:01:45.140> heavy

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:47.540 
look heavy

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:52.930 
look heavy
like<00:01:48.470> expected<00:01:49.750> i<00:01:50.750> use<00:01:51.110> the<00:01:51.260> governor<00:01:51.940> yes

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:52.940 
like expected i use the governor yes

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:57.160 
like expected i use the governor yes
five<00:01:53.210> founders<00:01:53.600> and<00:01:54.880> it's<00:01:55.880> got<00:01:56.090> some<00:01:56.300> special

to see sometimes you come on on the
roads<00:02:05.170> new<00:02:06.170> roads<00:02:06.470> you<00:02:06.680> don't<00:02:06.920> know<00:02:07.190> and<00:02:07.610> then

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
roads new roads you don't know and then

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.770 
roads new roads you don't know and then
when<00:02:08.780> you<00:02:09.220> do<00:02:10.220> the<00:02:10.429> out<00:02:10.820> print<00:02:11.150> of<00:02:11.330> the<00:02:11.420> evening

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
when you do the out print of the evening

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.230 
when you do the out print of the evening
on<00:02:11.930> your<00:02:12.110> computer<00:02:12.640> it's<00:02:13.640> really<00:02:13.970> nice<00:02:14.180> and

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:14.240 
on your computer it's really nice and

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.080 
on your computer it's really nice and
then<00:02:14.870> you<00:02:15.020> still<00:02:15.410> can<00:02:15.620> find<00:02:15.920> the<00:02:16.850> roads

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
then you still can find the roads

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.240 
then you still can find the roads
afterwards<00:02:17.690> you<00:02:17.810> can<00:02:17.930> find<00:02:18.260> them<00:02:18.440> and<00:02:18.560> find

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
afterwards you can find them and find

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.480 
afterwards you can find them and find
other<00:02:19.720> all<00:02:20.720> the<00:02:21.020> new<00:02:21.260> roads<00:02:21.590> to<00:02:22.130> do<00:02:22.280> on

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:22.490 
other all the new roads to do on

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:25.240 
other all the new roads to do on
training<00:02:22.820> and<00:02:23.180> so<00:02:23.930> it's<00:02:24.470> really<00:02:24.560> it's

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
training and so it's really it's

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.590

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
speed altitude so it's the most advanced

speed altitude so it's the most advanced
for<00:02:49.730> my<00:02:50.360> skin<00:02:51.519> it's<00:02:52.519> very<00:02:53.060> useful<00:02:53.360> because<00:02:53.630> I

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
for my skin it's very useful because I

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:55.740 
for my skin it's very useful because I
can<00:02:54.320> use<00:02:54.470> it<00:02:54.650> everyday<00:02:54.890> for<00:02:55.010> training

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
can use it everyday for training

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.390 
can use it everyday for training
download<00:02:56.750> it<00:02:56.959> into<00:02:57.200> the<00:02:57.530> the<00:02:57.980> garment

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
download it into the the garment

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.540 
download it into the the garment
software<00:02:58.880> and<00:02:59.840> then<00:03:00.110> I<00:03:00.350> can<00:03:00.530> look<00:03:00.709> back<00:03:00.739> a<00:03:01.250> week

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:01.550 
software and then I can look back a week

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:04.090 
software and then I can look back a week
a<00:03:01.820> month<00:03:01.850> to<00:03:02.480> month<00:03:02.690> three<00:03:03.110> months<00:03:03.470> last<00:03:03.860> year

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 
a month to month three months last year

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:08.720 
a month to month three months last year
and<00:03:04.880> I<00:03:05.030> think<00:03:05.239> compare<00:03:05.600> all<00:03:05.810> my<00:03:05.959> training<00:03:07.570> from

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
and I think compare all my training from

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.380 
and I think compare all my training from
one<00:03:09.420> day<00:03:09.599> to<00:03:09.659> another<00:03:10.580> and<00:03:11.580> I<00:03:11.670> could<00:03:12.030> I<00:03:12.209> can

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
one day to another and I could I can

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.690 
one day to another and I could I can
learn<00:03:12.540> trends<00:03:13.110> and<00:03:13.290> learn<00:03:13.920> learn<00:03:14.340> more<00:03:14.610> about

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
learn trends and learn learn more about

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.089 
learn trends and learn learn more about
my<00:03:15.000> body<00:03:15.209> this<00:03:15.450> way<00:03:15.690> so<00:03:16.319> too<00:03:16.379> it's<00:03:16.739> very<00:03:16.920> useful

00:03:17.089 --> 00:03:17.099 
my body this way so too it's very useful

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:21.110 
my body this way so too it's very useful
the<00:03:17.790> big<00:03:18.000> difference<00:03:18.150> is<00:03:18.569> I<00:03:18.870> came<00:03:19.260> out<00:03:20.120> with

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
the big difference is I came out with

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.600 
the big difference is I came out with
the<00:03:21.269> software<00:03:21.659> i<00:03:21.810> can<00:03:22.110> map<00:03:22.560> out<00:03:22.799> where<00:03:23.220> i<00:03:23.280> went

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
the software i can map out where i went

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:28.190 
the software i can map out where i went
with<00:03:26.180> like<00:03:27.180> we<00:03:27.330> demonstrated<00:03:27.900> on<00:03:28.080> the

distance<00:05:01.660> change<00:05:02.660> it<00:05:02.840> into<00:05:03.020> eight<00:05:03.890> different

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:03.950 
distance change it into eight different

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:08.930 
distance change it into eight different
screens<00:05:04.780> so<00:05:05.860> it<00:05:06.860> doesn't<00:05:07.220> everything<00:05:07.430> I<00:05:07.700> do<00:05:07.760> it

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:08.940

that's<00:06:16.380> why<00:06:16.500> the<00:06:16.560> garmin<00:06:16.919> is<00:06:17.040> useful<00:06:17.370> for<00:06:17.400> the

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:17.580 
that's why the garmin is useful for the

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:20.450 
that's why the garmin is useful for the
both<00:06:17.820> the<00:06:17.870> 590<00:06:18.870> 705<00:06:19.410> and<00:06:19.950> that's<00:06:20.070> why<00:06:20.190> using

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:20.460 
both the 590 705 and that's why using

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:23.300 
both the 590 705 and that's why using
the<00:06:20.640> racing<00:06:21.000> too<00:06:21.180> i<00:06:21.480> use<00:06:21.780> the<00:06:22.130> 500<00:06:23.130> in<00:06:23.220> the

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:23.310 
the racing too i use the 500 in the

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:25.880 
the racing too i use the 500 in the
races<00:06:23.669> just<00:06:24.270> so<00:06:24.419> that<00:06:24.570> i<00:06:24.600> can<00:06:24.750> i<00:06:25.230> can<00:06:25.650> record

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:25.890 
races just so that i can i can record

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:27.740 
races just so that i can i can record
the<00:06:26.460> power<00:06:26.669> out<00:06:26.820> what<00:06:26.970> i'm<00:06:27.120> doing<00:06:27.450> and<00:06:27.540> i<00:06:27.600> can

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:27.750 
the power out what i'm doing and i can

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:29.770 
the power out what i'm doing and i can
see<00:06:27.870> the<00:06:27.960> progression<00:06:28.140> and<00:06:28.950> I<00:06:29.040> can<00:06:29.190> see<00:06:29.370> that

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:29.780 
see the progression and I can see that

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:33.140 
see the progression and I can see that
like<00:06:30.780> on<00:06:31.550> sunday<00:06:32.550> i<00:06:32.580> can<00:06:32.760> see<00:06:32.880> that<00:06:32.910> was<00:06:33.120> a

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:33.150 
like on sunday i can see that was a

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:34.730 
like on sunday i can see that was a
really<00:06:33.360> hard<00:06:33.570> race<00:06:33.870> and<00:06:34.110> i<00:06:34.140> did<00:06:34.320> i<00:06:34.470> did<00:06:34.590> a

really hard race and i did i did a

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:36.860 
really hard race and i did i did a
really<00:06:34.919> good<00:06:35.070> performance<00:06:35.490> but<00:06:36.300> if<00:06:36.480> i<00:06:36.570> did<00:06:36.630> a<00:06:36.750> I

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:36.870 
really good performance but if i did a I

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:38.900 
really good performance but if i did a I
did<00:06:37.230> maybe<00:06:37.530> I<00:06:37.650> didn't<00:06:37.890> win<00:06:38.040> I<00:06:38.250> can<00:06:38.580> still<00:06:38.760> look

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:38.910 
did maybe I didn't win I can still look

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:42.440 
did maybe I didn't win I can still look
at<00:06:39.090> the<00:06:39.350> data<00:06:40.350> and<00:06:40.560> see<00:06:40.890> if<00:06:41.010> I<00:06:41.130> was<00:06:41.250> good<00:06:41.450> that's

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:42.450 
at the data and see if I was good that's

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:43.430 
at the data and see if I was good that's
really<00:06:42.600> good<00:06:42.690> for<00:06:42.810> the<00:06:42.960> mental<00:06:43.260> and<00:06:43.320> the

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:43.440 
really good for the mental and the

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:45.530 
really good for the mental and the
choice<00:06:43.980> just<00:06:44.190> helps<00:06:44.850> us<00:06:44.910> to<00:06:45.030> see<00:06:45.060> how<00:06:45.390> good

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:45.540 
choice just helps us to see how good

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:47.420 
choice just helps us to see how good
your<00:06:45.660> legs<00:06:45.900> are<00:06:46.080> and<00:06:46.320> do<00:06:46.890> I<00:06:46.950> if<00:06:47.220> you<00:06:47.280> have<00:06:47.370> a

your legs are and do I if you have a

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:51.150 
your legs are and do I if you have a

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:51.160 

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:52.770 

it'd<00:06:51.520> be<00:06:51.610> difficult<00:06:51.820> I<00:06:52.090> think<00:06:52.120> especially<00:06:52.510> the

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:52.780 
it'd be difficult I think especially the

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:54.810 
it'd be difficult I think especially the
500<00:06:53.290> because<00:06:53.560> of<00:06:53.680> a<00:06:53.740> small<00:06:54.130> ways<00:06:54.460> and<00:06:54.790> that

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:54.820 
500 because of a small ways and that

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:56.640 
500 because of a small ways and that
obviously<00:06:55.480> the<00:06:55.720> maps<00:06:55.930> who<00:06:56.050> don't<00:06:56.230> use<00:06:56.350> so<00:06:56.530> much

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:56.650 
obviously the maps who don't use so much

00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:58.590 
obviously the maps who don't use so much
book<00:06:56.950> with<00:06:57.100> the<00:06:57.160> 500<00:06:57.670> we<00:06:57.760> have<00:06:57.910> everything<00:06:58.480> in

00:06:58.590 --> 00:06:58.600 
book with the 500 we have everything in

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:00.870 
book with the 500 we have everything in
one<00:06:58.750> instead<00:06:59.440> of<00:06:59.560> having<00:06:59.710> like<00:07:00.280> every<00:07:00.790> other

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:00.880 
one instead of having like every other

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:02.310 
one instead of having like every other
team<00:07:01.120> and<00:07:01.150> the<00:07:01.390> parrot<00:07:01.600> are<00:07:01.750> they<00:07:02.170> have<00:07:02.290> a

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:02.320 
team and the parrot are they have a

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:04.230 
team and the parrot are they have a
computer<00:07:02.800> and<00:07:03.130> then<00:07:03.190> they<00:07:03.280> have<00:07:03.400> the<00:07:03.580> SRM<00:07:04.090> as

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:04.240 
computer and then they have the SRM as

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:05.850 
computer and then they have the SRM as
well<00:07:04.390> also<00:07:04.630> for<00:07:04.960> recording<00:07:05.290> the<00:07:05.380> data<00:07:05.560> and

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:05.860 
well also for recording the data and

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:07.770 
well also for recording the data and
everything<00:07:06.010> we<00:07:06.490> can<00:07:06.640> do<00:07:06.760> it<00:07:06.880> in<00:07:07.000> one<00:07:07.180> and<00:07:07.480> that

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:07.780 
everything we can do it in one and that

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:09.450 
everything we can do it in one and that
saves<00:07:07.990> that<00:07:08.320> saves<00:07:08.590> weight<00:07:08.800> with<00:07:09.010> a<00:07:09.070> bike<00:07:09.250> and

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:09.460 
saves that saves weight with a bike and

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:11.010 
saves that saves weight with a bike and
it<00:07:09.580> also<00:07:09.700> looks<00:07:09.970> better<00:07:10.180> is<00:07:10.630> better<00:07:10.780> for

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:11.020 
it also looks better is better for

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:12.900 
it also looks better is better for
aerodynamics<00:07:11.560> and<00:07:11.770> obviously<00:07:12.580> you<00:07:12.640> have<00:07:12.790> the

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:12.910 
aerodynamics and obviously you have the

00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:14.790 
aerodynamics and obviously you have the
nothing<00:07:13.510> too<00:07:13.720> so<00:07:13.900> you<00:07:13.990> can<00:07:14.140> find<00:07:14.650> your<00:07:14.710> way

00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:14.800 
nothing too so you can find your way

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:17.250 
nothing too so you can find your way
