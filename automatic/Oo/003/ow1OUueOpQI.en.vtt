 if when you go shopping all you have left 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.520
 short and in the end you have to buy yourself a 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.540
 pants that look good long but 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.540

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.820
 and when you finally find the 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.470
 perfect waist pants you have 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.090
 to put them inside the boots 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.940

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:45.940
 high heel shoes 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.000
 and to talk to two friends you have to 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.030

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.030
 nothing 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.869

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.030
 reaches shoulder height and when 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:13.479
