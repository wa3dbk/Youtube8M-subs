 does not go to the next round 

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:04.060
 good guys have made a duo in which 

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:04.060
 they have done good to redound 

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:08.350
 I have not said one yet 

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:13.080
 the one who have done what is very 

00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:16.910
 important have taken advantage of the virtues 

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:16.910
 of each of the singers 

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:23.930
 romantic one the bohemian side and 

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:26.390
 rambling of the other have joined and each 

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:30.520
 one has been in place that is well 

00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:30.520
 go to calamaro in a tube where you can 

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:38.490
 how good it looks to Luis Fonsi a 

00:07:35.289 --> 00:07:38.490
 little bit more pregnant the voice 

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:44.080
 and I think they have done a very good 

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:46.810
 scenic assembly 

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:48.639
 before this duo was clear to whom 

00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:50.979
 commands let's statements today by my 

00:07:48.639 --> 00:07:53.639
 part after the duo I do not have it anymore 

00:07:50.979 --> 00:07:53.639
 clear gentlemen
