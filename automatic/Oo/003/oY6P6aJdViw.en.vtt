00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.850 
you is pop into a crooked grind just
standing<00:01:53.880> still<00:01:54.210> like<00:01:55.050> just<00:01:55.290> stand<00:01:55.500> next<00:01:55.590> to

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
standing still like just stand next to

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.980 
standing still like just stand next to
the<00:01:55.920> ledge<00:01:56.160> pop<00:01:56.910> up<00:01:57.150> laying<00:01:57.540> in<00:01:57.690> the<00:01:57.780> crooked

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
the ledge pop up laying in the crooked

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.320 
the ledge pop up laying in the crooked
grind<00:01:58.260> and<00:01:58.500> then<00:01:59.070> do<00:01:59.190> a<00:01:59.220> nollie<00:01:59.520> out<00:01:59.820> off<00:02:00.120> to

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:00.330 
grind and then do a nollie out off to

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.690 
grind and then do a nollie out off to
the<00:02:00.450> side<00:02:00.830> the<00:02:01.830> interesting<00:02:02.220> things<00:02:02.430> about<00:02:02.550> a

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
the side the interesting things about a

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.730 
the side the interesting things about a
lot<00:02:02.790> of<00:02:02.970> these<00:02:03.120> tricks<00:02:03.450> is<00:02:03.660> you<00:02:04.350> don't<00:02:04.530> always

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
lot of these tricks is you don't always

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.070 
lot of these tricks is you don't always
even<00:02:05.130> have<00:02:05.430> to<00:02:05.700> take<00:02:05.910> them<00:02:06.090> off<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:06.480> edge<00:02:06.660> if

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:07.080 
even have to take them off the edge if

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.900 
even have to take them off the edge if
you<00:02:07.620> have<00:02:07.800> them<00:02:07.950> good<00:02:08.190> enough<00:02:08.399> you'll<00:02:08.670> be<00:02:08.729> able

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
you have them good enough you'll be able

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.140 
you have them good enough you'll be able
to<00:02:09.060> pop<00:02:09.269> out<00:02:09.479> in<00:02:09.629> the<00:02:09.719> middle<00:02:10.129> but<00:02:11.129> popping<00:02:12.030> out

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
to pop out in the middle but popping out

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.720 
to pop out in the middle but popping out
on<00:02:12.299> the<00:02:12.420> edge<00:02:12.599> is<00:02:13.049> easier<00:02:13.950> but<00:02:14.370> yeah<00:02:14.459> this<00:02:14.670> is

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
on the edge is easier but yeah this is

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:15.470 
on the edge is easier but yeah this is
one<00:02:14.969> of<00:02:14.999> those<00:02:15.150> things

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
one of those things

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.030 
one of those things
a lot<00:02:15.720> of<00:02:15.750> people<00:02:16.080> do<00:02:16.290> end<00:02:16.470> up<00:02:16.590> getting<00:02:16.890> stuck

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
a lot of people do end up getting stuck

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.250 
a lot of people do end up getting stuck
right<00:02:17.430> at<00:02:17.519> the<00:02:17.640> end<00:02:17.849> you'll<00:02:18.629> notice<00:02:18.989> every

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
right at the end you'll notice every

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.830 
right at the end you'll notice every
time<00:02:19.290> I<00:02:19.500> near<00:02:19.920> the<00:02:20.129> edge<00:02:20.459> of<00:02:20.879> the<00:02:21.000> bench<00:02:21.239> I'll

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
time I near the edge of the bench I'll

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.619 
time I near the edge of the bench I'll
kind<00:02:22.110> of<00:02:22.230> like<00:02:22.409> start<00:02:22.950> pushing<00:02:23.610> my<00:02:24.239> front<00:02:24.569> foot

00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:24.629 
kind of like start pushing my front foot

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:27.080 
kind of like start pushing my front foot
forward<00:02:25.080> and<00:02:25.319> just<00:02:25.530> nudging<00:02:25.860> it<00:02:26.159> off<00:02:26.340> the

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
forward and just nudging it off the

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.820 
forward and just nudging it off the
other<00:02:27.239> thing<00:02:27.540> that<00:02:27.930> I<00:02:27.959> feel<00:02:28.200> like<00:02:28.260> helps<00:02:28.680> out

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
other thing that I feel like helps out

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.309 
other thing that I feel like helps out
with<00:02:28.980> this<00:02:29.159> a<00:02:29.190> lot<00:02:29.489> is<00:02:29.730> it<00:02:30.420> just<00:02:30.810> like<00:02:30.989> no

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
with this a lot is it just like no

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:33.050 
with this a lot is it just like no
slides<00:02:31.709> and<00:02:32.040> popping<00:02:32.370> out<00:02:32.489> of<00:02:32.610> no<00:02:32.760> slides

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
slides and popping out of no slides

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.910 
slides and popping out of no slides
because<00:02:33.360> it<00:02:33.540> is<00:02:33.660> kind<00:02:33.900> of<00:02:34.019> a<00:02:34.080> similar<00:02:34.590> motion

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
because it is kind of a similar motion

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.220 
because it is kind of a similar motion
the<00:02:35.760> crooked<00:02:36.120> grind<00:02:36.239> in<00:02:36.480> and<00:02:36.629> no<00:02:36.750> slide<00:02:37.049> is

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
the crooked grind in and no slide is

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.740 
the crooked grind in and no slide is
very<00:02:37.500> similar<00:02:37.860> in<00:02:38.160> the<00:02:38.310> terms<00:02:38.580> that<00:02:38.700> all<00:02:39.330> of

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
very similar in the terms that all of

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.720 
very similar in the terms that all of
your<00:02:39.900> weight<00:02:40.170> is<00:02:40.410> on<00:02:40.440> your<00:02:40.709> front<00:02:41.040> foot<00:02:41.370> and

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
your weight is on your front foot and

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.330 
your weight is on your front foot and
just<00:02:42.239> the<00:02:42.420> way<00:02:42.959> that<00:02:43.230> you're<00:02:43.349> like<00:02:43.560> popping

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
just the way that you're like popping

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.500 
just the way that you're like popping
off<00:02:44.519> the<00:02:44.730> edge<00:02:44.909> of<00:02:45.390> the<00:02:45.569> of<00:02:46.110> the

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
off the edge of the of the

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.210 
off the edge of the of the
whatever-you-call-it<00:02:48.510> box<00:02:49.349> or<00:02:49.709> bench<00:02:49.950> or

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
whatever-you-call-it box or bench or

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.000 
whatever-you-call-it box or bench or
whatever<00:02:50.519> it<00:02:50.700> is<00:02:50.849> is<00:02:51.120> just<00:02:51.660> very<00:02:51.840> similar<00:02:52.140> cool

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
whatever it is is just very similar cool

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.420 
whatever it is is just very similar cool
so<00:02:53.220> watch<00:02:53.400> my<00:02:53.609> front<00:02:54.120> foot<00:02:54.209> here<00:02:54.629> pop<00:02:55.140> up<00:02:55.440> all

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
so watch my front foot here pop up all

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.990 
so watch my front foot here pop up all
my<00:02:56.760> weight<00:02:56.940> goes<00:02:57.209> here<00:02:57.720> I<00:02:57.900> land<00:02:58.799> so<00:02:59.250> now<00:02:59.760> my

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
my weight goes here I land so now my

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.449 
my weight goes here I land so now my
weight<00:03:00.239> is<00:03:00.450> like<00:03:00.959> back<00:03:01.290> and<00:03:01.620> my<00:03:01.859> front<00:03:02.129> foot<00:03:02.220> is

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
weight is like back and my front foot is

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:03.559 
weight is like back and my front foot is
forward<00:03:02.700> then<00:03:02.910> right<00:03:03.120> here<00:03:03.329> you're<00:03:03.480> gonna

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:03.569 
forward then right here you're gonna

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:05.180 
forward then right here you're gonna
notice<00:03:03.780> how<00:03:04.079> you<00:03:04.140> shove<00:03:04.500> my<00:03:04.709> front<00:03:05.010> foot

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
notice how you shove my front foot

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.150 
notice how you shove my front foot
forward<00:03:05.400> again<00:03:05.849> and<00:03:06.359> just<00:03:07.349> do<00:03:07.500> like<00:03:07.530> just<00:03:08.010> a

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
forward again and just do like just a

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.759 
forward again and just do like just a
little<00:03:08.430> nudge<00:03:09.120> just<00:03:09.599> enough<00:03:09.900> to<00:03:10.019> get<00:03:10.260> that<00:03:10.500> up

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769 
little nudge just enough to get that up

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:15.050 
little nudge just enough to get that up
and<00:03:11.220> off<00:03:11.670> over<00:03:12.209> the<00:03:12.720> corner<00:03:13.230> and<00:03:13.470> then<00:03:14.160> I<00:03:14.700> bring

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
and off over the corner and then I bring

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.170 
and off over the corner and then I bring
my<00:03:15.269> back<00:03:15.540> foot<00:03:15.840> down<00:03:16.109> wind<00:03:16.739> and<00:03:17.190> roll<00:03:17.370> away<00:03:17.519> so

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
my back foot down wind and roll away so

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:19.699 
my back foot down wind and roll away so
it's<00:03:18.299> just<00:03:18.390> that<00:03:18.629> little<00:03:18.840> nudge<00:03:19.260> it's<00:03:19.560> just

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
it's just that little nudge it's just

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:22.670 
it's just that little nudge it's just
kind<00:03:19.889> of<00:03:19.950> a<00:03:20.069> little<00:03:20.220> nollie<00:03:20.819> motion<00:03:21.750> but<00:03:22.470> again

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
kind of a little nollie motion but again

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.680 
kind of a little nollie motion but again
look<00:03:22.950> you<00:03:23.160> can<00:03:23.340> really<00:03:23.579> see<00:03:23.760> right<00:03:24.030> here<00:03:24.419> like

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
look you can really see right here like

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.509 
look you can really see right here like
look<00:03:24.870> at<00:03:24.989> where<00:03:25.109> my<00:03:25.260> weight<00:03:25.590> distribution<00:03:26.400> it

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
look at where my weight distribution it

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:29.330 
look at where my weight distribution it
is<00:03:26.549> it<00:03:27.000> is<00:03:27.269> really<00:03:27.599> far<00:03:27.840> back<00:03:28.169> if<00:03:28.829> your<00:03:29.099> weight

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
is it is really far back if your weight

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.750 
is it is really far back if your weight
is<00:03:29.549> too<00:03:30.239> far<00:03:30.569> distributed<00:03:31.260> forward<00:03:31.760> then

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
is too far distributed forward then

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.069 
is too far distributed forward then
that's<00:03:33.090> where<00:03:33.389> you're<00:03:33.480> gonna<00:03:33.540> have<00:03:33.750> a<00:03:33.810> much

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:34.079 
that's where you're gonna have a much

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:36.159 
that's where you're gonna have a much
larger<00:03:34.290> tendency<00:03:34.919> to<00:03:35.099> hang<00:03:35.370> up<00:03:35.579> on<00:03:35.730> the<00:03:35.880> bench

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:36.169 
larger tendency to hang up on the bench
