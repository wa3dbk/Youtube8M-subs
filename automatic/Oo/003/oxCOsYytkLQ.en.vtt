00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
that matter but I've been playing at

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.099 
that matter but I've been playing at
this<00:00:25.920> for<00:00:26.099> a<00:00:26.130> little<00:00:26.250> while<00:00:26.400> and<00:00:26.840> so<00:00:27.840> far<00:00:28.080> I

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
this for a little while and so far I

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.960 
this for a little while and so far I
like<00:00:28.230> it<00:00:28.560> I<00:00:28.680> mean<00:00:28.890> you've<00:00:29.010> got<00:00:29.039> two<00:00:29.369> options<00:00:29.400> if

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
like it I mean you've got two options if

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.510 
like it I mean you've got two options if
you<00:00:30.090> want<00:00:30.269> to<00:00:30.359> gain<00:00:30.570> with<00:00:31.260> controller<00:00:31.710> first

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
you want to gain with controller first

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.910 
you want to gain with controller first
one<00:00:32.669> is<00:00:32.759> you<00:00:32.880> can<00:00:33.030> jailbreak<00:00:33.559> which<00:00:34.559> I've<00:00:34.739> done

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
one is you can jailbreak which I've done

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.130 
one is you can jailbreak which I've done
and<00:00:35.280> you<00:00:35.760> use<00:00:35.910> a<00:00:35.940> playstation<00:00:36.660> 2<00:00:36.780> controller

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
and you use a playstation 2 controller

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.139 
and you use a playstation 2 controller
that's<00:00:37.920> actually<00:00:38.100> kind<00:00:38.430> of<00:00:38.460> limited<00:00:38.820> I<00:00:38.910> found

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
that's actually kind of limited I found

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:40.580 
that's actually kind of limited I found
that<00:00:39.270> it<00:00:39.360> works<00:00:39.510> with<00:00:39.660> some<00:00:39.870> games<00:00:40.140> and<00:00:40.320> others

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.290 
that it works with some games and others
that<00:00:40.739> don't<00:00:40.890> or<00:00:41.730> you<00:00:41.879> can<00:00:42.000> go<00:00:42.149> ahead<00:00:42.210> and

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
that don't or you can go ahead and

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.420 
that don't or you can go ahead and
splurge<00:00:42.629> and<00:00:42.899> buy<00:00:43.290> this<00:00:43.530> sucker<00:00:43.920> and<00:00:44.160> it<00:00:44.250> works

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
splurge and buy this sucker and it works

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.580 
splurge and buy this sucker and it works
with<00:00:44.610> pretty<00:00:44.879> much<00:00:44.969> any<00:00:45.270> game<00:00:46.170> that<00:00:46.200> is<00:00:46.559> a

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
with pretty much any game that is a

controller now I picked us up at the

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.569 
controller now I picked us up at the
apple<00:00:58.109> store<00:00:58.140> again<00:00:58.859> it's<00:00:59.129> a<00:00:59.190> little<00:00:59.370> pricey

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579

game<00:01:12.900> controller<00:01:13.290> but<00:01:14.010> I<00:01:14.040> found<00:01:14.250> that<00:01:14.369> it

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
game controller but I found that it

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.780 
game controller but I found that it
doesn't<00:01:14.880> work<00:01:15.119> with<00:01:15.720> every<00:01:16.229> game<00:01:16.409> like<00:01:16.790> right

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
doesn't work with every game like right

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.460 
doesn't work with every game like right
now<00:01:17.880> I've<00:01:17.970> got<00:01:18.030> asphalt<00:01:18.540> 8<00:01:18.689> open<00:01:19.049> and<00:01:19.290> I<00:01:19.350> was

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
now I've got asphalt 8 open and I was

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.590 
now I've got asphalt 8 open and I was
using<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:19.799> ps2<00:01:20.549> controller<00:01:20.909> and<00:01:21.119> a<00:01:21.180> jailbreak

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
using the ps2 controller and a jailbreak

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.090 
using the ps2 controller and a jailbreak
can<00:01:21.810> work<00:01:21.960> fine<00:01:22.259> but<00:01:22.290> when<00:01:22.619> i<00:01:22.680> try<00:01:22.860> to<00:01:22.890> play

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
can work fine but when i try to play

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.370 
can work fine but when i try to play
dead<00:01:23.310> trigger<00:01:23.549> for<00:01:24.390> whatever<00:01:24.630> reason<00:01:24.990> like

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
dead trigger for whatever reason like

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.359 
dead trigger for whatever reason like
partially<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.070> controls<00:01:26.610> worked<00:01:28.220> with<00:01:29.220> the

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
partially the controls worked with the

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.560 
partially the controls worked with the
jailbreak<00:01:29.850> so<00:01:30.950> with<00:01:31.950> this<00:01:32.159> it's<00:01:33.030> guaranteed

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
jailbreak so with this it's guaranteed

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.679 
jailbreak so with this it's guaranteed
to<00:01:33.600> work<00:01:33.979> if<00:01:34.979> you<00:01:35.130> go<00:01:35.250> to<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.369> stratus<00:01:36.030> steel

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
course if you go to the app store it

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.630 
course if you go to the app store it
will<00:01:46.380> tell<00:01:46.560> you<00:01:46.649> if<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.860> game<00:01:47.040> is<00:01:47.250> supported

will tell you if the game is supported

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.020 
will tell you if the game is supported
by<00:01:47.670> a<00:01:47.790> controller<00:01:48.570> or<00:01:48.689> not<00:01:48.899> but<00:01:49.850> let's<00:01:50.850> take<00:01:51.000> a

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
by a controller or not but let's take a

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.340 
by a controller or not but let's take a
look<00:01:51.180> at<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.329> hardware<00:01:51.540> this<00:01:51.960> does<00:01:52.170> take

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
look at the hardware this does take

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.910

worth it but I still think the price is
too<00:04:44.440> high<00:04:44.470> for<00:04:44.800> what<00:04:44.919> it<00:04:45.010> is<00:04:45.210> but<00:04:46.210> like<00:04:46.600> said

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:46.900 
too high for what it is but like said

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:48.810 
too high for what it is but like said
this<00:04:47.110> is<00:04:47.230> around<00:04:47.500> seventy<00:04:47.919> dollars<00:04:48.250> plus<00:04:48.490> tax

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:48.820
