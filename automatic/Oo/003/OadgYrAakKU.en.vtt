00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:49.520 
high but then it's better than those

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:51.310

and I thought there might follow them
I'm<00:07:19.400> not<00:07:19.640> gonna<00:07:19.790> make<00:07:20.000> it<00:07:20.210> so<00:07:20.390> it's<00:07:20.600> right<00:07:20.840> here

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:21.050 
I'm not gonna make it so it's right here

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:22.960 
I'm not gonna make it so it's right here
and<00:07:21.320> I'm<00:07:21.410> not<00:07:21.530> even<00:07:21.590> as<00:07:21.890> fast<00:07:22.160> as<00:07:22.340> they<00:07:22.460> are<00:07:22.640> so

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:22.970 
and I'm not even as fast as they are so

00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:25.450 
and I'm not even as fast as they are so
crazy
