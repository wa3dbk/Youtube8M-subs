a great deal of rain on a regular basis

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:34.470 
a great deal of rain on a regular basis
here<00:03:32.680> in<00:03:32.800> London<00:03:33.100> England<00:03:33.250> and<00:03:33.580> today<00:03:34.210> that<00:03:34.450> is

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:42.600 

I<00:03:41.320> think<00:03:41.800> it's<00:03:41.920> going<00:03:42.040> to<00:03:42.070> have<00:03:42.220> a<00:03:42.250> big<00:03:42.460> impact

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:42.610 
I think it's going to have a big impact

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:45.690 
I think it's going to have a big impact
on<00:03:43.120> this<00:03:43.330> game<00:03:43.630> because<00:03:44.200> the<00:03:44.800> field<00:03:45.160> here<00:03:45.460> at

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:45.700 
on this game because the field here at

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:47.370 
on this game because the field here at
Wembley<00:03:45.880> Stadium<00:03:46.120> or<00:03:46.750> as<00:03:46.870> it's<00:03:47.050> called<00:03:47.200> a

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:47.380 
Wembley Stadium or as it's called a

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.440 
Wembley Stadium or as it's called a
pitch<00:03:47.650> it's<00:03:48.250> a<00:03:48.400> different<00:03:48.850> type<00:03:49.030> of<00:03:49.060> grass

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
pitch it's a different type of grass

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:51.420 
pitch it's a different type of grass
it's<00:03:49.780> a<00:03:49.870> thinner<00:03:50.110> grass<00:03:50.410> it's<00:03:50.710> not<00:03:50.890> as<00:03:51.100> thick

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
it's a thinner grass it's not as thick

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.760 
it's a thinner grass it's not as thick
it's<00:03:51.910> kind<00:03:52.300> of<00:03:52.390> cut<00:03:52.630> short<00:03:53.020> it's<00:03:53.200> kinda<00:03:53.560> like<00:03:53.650> a

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:53.770 
it's kind of cut short it's kinda like a

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:57.270 
it's kind of cut short it's kinda like a
golf<00:03:54.070> fairway<00:03:54.640> these<00:03:55.210> guys<00:03:55.510> the<00:03:56.350> size<00:03:56.650> and<00:03:57.160> the

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 
golf fairway these guys the size and the

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.190 
golf fairway these guys the size and the
demands<00:03:57.910> to<00:03:58.150> make<00:03:58.180> these<00:03:58.480> sharp<00:03:58.780> cuts

00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.200 
demands to make these sharp cuts

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:00.540 
demands to make these sharp cuts
I<00:03:59.260> think<00:03:59.560> the<00:03:59.680> footing<00:04:00.040> is<00:04:00.190> going<00:04:00.400> to<00:04:00.460> be

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:00.550 
I think the footing is going to be

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:02.340 
I think the footing is going to be
critical<00:04:01.060> during<00:04:01.630> the<00:04:01.720> course<00:04:01.990> of<00:04:02.140> this<00:04:02.260> game

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:02.350 
critical during the course of this game

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:05.100 
critical during the course of this game
and<00:04:02.860> how<00:04:03.400> ironic<00:04:03.580> it<00:04:04.060> is<00:04:04.090> that<00:04:04.540> the<00:04:04.690> only

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:05.110 
and how ironic it is that the only

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:07.350 
and how ironic it is that the only
