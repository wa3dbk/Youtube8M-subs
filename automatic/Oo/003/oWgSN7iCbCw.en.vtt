reading a lot of the comments that had
gotten<00:00:05.730> on<00:00:05.850> my<00:00:05.879> last<00:00:06.150> video<00:00:06.390> here<00:00:06.839> I<00:00:06.870> figured

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
gotten on my last video here I figured

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:09.890 
gotten on my last video here I figured
I'd<00:00:07.350> explain<00:00:07.890> some<00:00:08.189> of<00:00:08.280> those<00:00:08.400> questions

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
I'd explain some of those questions

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.410 
I'd explain some of those questions
a<00:00:09.929> lot<00:00:10.320> of<00:00:10.410> people<00:00:10.650> have<00:00:10.769> asked<00:00:11.099> what<00:00:11.340> is<00:00:12.120> the

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
a lot of people have asked what is the

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:13.999 
a lot of people have asked what is the
pachinko<00:00:12.750> machine<00:00:13.200> and<00:00:13.410> what's<00:00:13.590> it<00:00:13.710> made<00:00:13.860> up

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
pachinko machine and what's it made up

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.790 
pachinko machine and what's it made up
of<00:00:14.219> and<00:00:14.570> as<00:00:15.570> you<00:00:15.870> can<00:00:16.020> see<00:00:16.199> here<00:00:16.410> I've<00:00:16.529> kind<00:00:16.710> of

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
of and as you can see here I've kind of

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.830 
of and as you can see here I've kind of
opened<00:00:17.039> the<00:00:17.070> door<00:00:17.310> up<00:00:17.550> and<00:00:18.119> if<00:00:18.539> you<00:00:18.660> look

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
opened the door up and if you look

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.230 
opened the door up and if you look
inside<00:00:19.020> here<00:00:19.710> you<00:00:20.520> can<00:00:20.699> see<00:00:20.880> all<00:00:20.910> of<00:00:21.029> these

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
inside here you can see all of these

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.540 
inside here you can see all of these
tiny<00:00:21.570> little<00:00:21.660> brass<00:00:22.109> pins<00:00:22.529> now<00:00:23.070> these<00:00:23.279> brass

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
tiny little brass pins now these brass

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.640 
tiny little brass pins now these brass
pins<00:00:23.850> are<00:00:24.029> all<00:00:24.150> bent<00:00:24.390> to<00:00:24.570> a<00:00:24.600> certain<00:00:24.990> angle<00:00:25.320> and

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
pins are all bent to a certain angle and

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.500 
pins are all bent to a certain angle and
they're<00:00:26.369> all<00:00:26.490> located<00:00:26.849> in<00:00:27.090> a<00:00:27.180> certain

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
they're all located in a certain

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.830 
they're all located in a certain
position<00:00:28.109> and<00:00:28.289> what<00:00:28.859> happens<00:00:29.279> here<00:00:29.609> is<00:00:29.840> these

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
position and what happens here is these

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.299 
position and what happens here is these
steel<00:00:31.140> bearings<00:00:31.650> this<00:00:31.859> is<00:00:31.980> what<00:00:32.099> I<00:00:32.130> was

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
steel bearings this is what I was

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.819 
steel bearings this is what I was
talking<00:00:32.730> about<00:00:32.790> before<00:00:33.410> each<00:00:34.410> one<00:00:34.649> of<00:00:34.739> these

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
talking about before each one of these

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.420 
talking about before each one of these
steel<00:00:35.130> bearings<00:00:35.579> is<00:00:36.050> about<00:00:37.050> four<00:00:37.440> yen<00:00:37.829> apiece

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
steel bearings is about four yen apiece

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.569 
steel bearings is about four yen apiece
so<00:00:38.700> about<00:00:38.910> four<00:00:39.180> cents<00:00:39.660> and<00:00:40.370> the<00:00:41.370> steel

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
so about four cents and the steel

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.240 
so about four cents and the steel
bearings<00:00:42.000> come<00:00:42.239> in<00:00:42.420> through<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.320> different

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
bearings come in through the different

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.810 
bearings come in through the different
various<00:00:44.520> slots<00:00:44.760> here<00:00:45.149> and<00:00:45.300> they<00:00:45.899> bounce<00:00:46.110> down

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:46.820 
various slots here and they bounce down

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.979 
various slots here and they bounce down
throughout<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:48.030> different<00:00:48.180> pins<00:00:48.570> and<00:00:48.899> then

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
throughout the different pins and then

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.170 
throughout the different pins and then
they<00:00:49.110> land<00:00:49.320> in<00:00:49.469> certain<00:00:49.770> positions<00:00:50.059> you<00:00:51.059> know

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
they land in certain positions you know

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.810 
they land in certain positions you know
some<00:00:51.390> of<00:00:51.510> them<00:00:52.160> since<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.250> doors<00:00:53.460> open<00:00:53.730> it's

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
some of them since the doors open it's

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.119 
some of them since the doors open it's
not<00:00:53.910> probably<00:00:54.180> gonna<00:00:54.329> work<00:00:54.480> so<00:00:54.690> well<00:00:54.899> but<00:00:55.440> they

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
not probably gonna work so well but they

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.740 
not probably gonna work so well but they
float<00:00:56.430> around<00:00:56.550> throughout<00:00:57.090> here<00:00:57.480> bounce

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
float around throughout here bounce

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.830 
float around throughout here bounce
around<00:00:58.100> and<00:00:59.100> this<00:00:59.760> casing<00:01:00.239> here<00:01:00.480> is<00:01:00.629> pretty

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
around and this casing here is pretty

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.510 
around and this casing here is pretty
strong<00:01:01.230> it's<00:01:01.469> made<00:01:01.620> out<00:01:01.770> of<00:01:01.859> a<00:01:01.949> lot<00:01:02.039> of<00:01:02.190> metal

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
strong it's made out of a lot of metal

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.729 
strong it's made out of a lot of metal
and<00:01:02.699> there's<00:01:03.539> a<00:01:03.600> little<00:01:03.809> bit<00:01:03.989> of<00:01:04.049> plastic<00:01:04.589> in

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
and there's a little bit of plastic in

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.399 
and there's a little bit of plastic in
it<00:01:04.890> but<00:01:05.430> they<00:01:05.970> wound<00:01:06.180> up<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.750> balls<00:01:06.960> wind<00:01:07.229> up

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
it but they wound up the balls wind up

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.020 
it but they wound up the balls wind up
bouncing<00:01:07.890> around<00:01:08.010> in<00:01:08.369> here

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
bouncing around in here

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.020 
bouncing around in here
they<00:01:09.330> slide<00:01:09.630> out<00:01:09.659> throughout<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.290> outside

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
they slide out throughout the outside

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.490 
they slide out throughout the outside
and<00:01:12.030> they<00:01:12.180> slide<00:01:12.450> out<00:01:12.479> throughout<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.170> inside

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
and they slide out throughout the inside

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.969 
and they slide out throughout the inside
here<00:01:14.070> it<00:01:14.220> depends<00:01:15.090> all<00:01:15.270> depends<00:01:15.840> on<00:01:16.020> where<00:01:16.710> the

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
here it depends all depends on where the

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.999 
here it depends all depends on where the
direction<00:01:17.549> of<00:01:17.820> them<00:01:18.060> goes<00:01:18.360> is<00:01:18.750> based<00:01:19.439> on<00:01:19.680> the

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
direction of them goes is based on the

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.030 
direction of them goes is based on the
lever<00:01:20.880> here<00:01:21.270> now<00:01:21.720> this<00:01:21.960> lever<00:01:22.200> you<00:01:22.439> must<00:01:22.680> have

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
lever here now this lever you must have

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.280 
lever here now this lever you must have
like<00:01:23.369> a<00:01:23.400> kind<00:01:24.180> of<00:01:24.210> firm<00:01:24.420> grip<00:01:24.659> on<00:01:24.810> it<00:01:24.990> in<00:01:25.140> order

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
like a kind of firm grip on it in order

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.490 
like a kind of firm grip on it in order
for<00:01:25.380> it<00:01:25.560> to<00:01:25.700> shoot<00:01:26.700> out<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:27.060> balls<00:01:27.350> if<00:01:28.350> you

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
for it to shoot out the balls if you

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.100 
for it to shoot out the balls if you
just<00:01:28.680> touch<00:01:28.890> this<00:01:29.130> by<00:01:29.520> itself<00:01:29.990> nothing<00:01:30.990> will

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
just touch this by itself nothing will

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.810 
just touch this by itself nothing will
happen<00:01:31.290> I<00:01:31.650> think<00:01:32.009> it's<00:01:32.100> based<00:01:32.280> on<00:01:32.460> like<00:01:32.790> a

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
happen I think it's based on like a

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.109 
happen I think it's based on like a
static<00:01:33.659> electric<00:01:33.780> kind<00:01:34.710> of<00:01:34.890> system<00:01:35.640> whereas

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
static electric kind of system whereas

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.789 
static electric kind of system whereas
if<00:01:36.329> you<00:01:36.420> make<00:01:36.570> full<00:01:36.810> contact<00:01:36.840> with<00:01:37.350> it<00:01:37.619> and

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
if you make full contact with it and

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.090 
if you make full contact with it and
then<00:01:37.920> turn<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:38.520> lever<00:01:39.030> here<00:01:39.439> the<00:01:40.439> balls<00:01:40.890> will

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
then turn the lever here the balls will

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.130 
then turn the lever here the balls will
start<00:01:41.340> to<00:01:41.490> shoot<00:01:42.090> around<00:01:42.210> here<00:01:42.630> on<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:42.780> inside

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
start to shoot around here on the inside

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.130 
start to shoot around here on the inside
of<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.320> casing<00:01:43.710> but<00:01:44.420> depending<00:01:45.420> on<00:01:45.570> how<00:01:45.780> hard

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
of the casing but depending on how hard

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.679 
of the casing but depending on how hard
or<00:01:46.439> how<00:01:46.799> far<00:01:47.070> you<00:01:47.130> turn<00:01:47.490> this<00:01:47.670> lever<00:01:47.939> is<00:01:48.090> how

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
or how far you turn this lever is how

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.510 
or how far you turn this lever is how
strong<00:01:49.079> the<00:01:49.229> balls<00:01:49.439> will<00:01:49.740> float<00:01:50.040> around<00:01:50.189> on

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
strong the balls will float around on

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.940 
strong the balls will float around on
the<00:01:50.610> inside<00:01:50.820> here<00:01:51.479> so<00:01:51.960> if<00:01:52.320> you<00:01:52.500> just<00:01:52.680> lightly

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
the inside here so if you just lightly

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.249 
the inside here so if you just lightly
touch<00:01:53.340> this<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:54.180> balls<00:01:54.360> will<00:01:54.630> sometimes<00:01:54.990> just

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
touch this the balls will sometimes just

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.830 
touch this the balls will sometimes just
shoot<00:01:55.439> down<00:01:55.710> from<00:01:56.610> this<00:01:56.880> top<00:01:57.210> part<00:01:57.450> here<00:01:57.780> and

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
shoot down from this top part here and

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.510 
shoot down from this top part here and
just<00:01:58.020> kind<00:01:58.170> of<00:01:58.229> bounce<00:01:58.439> down<00:01:58.710> a<00:01:58.740> little<00:01:59.009> bit<00:01:59.219> if

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
just kind of bounce down a little bit if

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.969 
just kind of bounce down a little bit if
you<00:01:59.939> turn<00:02:00.210> it<00:02:00.360> all<00:02:00.509> the<00:02:00.570> way<00:02:00.840> they'll<00:02:01.560> fly

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
you turn it all the way they'll fly

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.190 
you turn it all the way they'll fly
around<00:02:02.240> and<00:02:03.240> sometimes<00:02:03.780> they'll<00:02:03.960> go<00:02:04.079> around

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
around and sometimes they'll go around

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.139 
around and sometimes they'll go around
the<00:02:04.500> opposite<00:02:04.920> direction<00:02:05.070> it<00:02:05.520> all<00:02:05.640> depends

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
the opposite direction it all depends

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:10.279 
the opposite direction it all depends
but<00:02:07.280> in<00:02:08.280> Japan<00:02:08.670> pachinko<00:02:09.030> is<00:02:09.390> kind<00:02:09.629> of<00:02:09.720> like<00:02:09.959> a

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
what they were able to do with pachinko

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:20.759 
what they were able to do with pachinko
is<00:02:17.879> they<00:02:18.879> were<00:02:18.940> able<00:02:19.150> to<00:02:19.470> develop<00:02:20.470> a<00:02:20.560> system

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:20.769 
is they were able to develop a system

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:23.970 
is they were able to develop a system
where<00:02:21.250> all<00:02:21.489> of<00:02:21.970> these<00:02:22.120> steel<00:02:22.870> bearings<00:02:23.590> don't

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
where all of these steel bearings don't

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.570 
where all of these steel bearings don't
move<00:02:25.050> you<00:02:26.050> would<00:02:26.140> get<00:02:26.349> carts<00:02:26.860> and<00:02:27.129> carts<00:02:27.430> like

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
move you would get carts and carts like

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.330 
move you would get carts and carts like
these<00:02:28.060> kind<00:02:28.300> of<00:02:28.450> boxes<00:02:29.349> or<00:02:29.500> cases<00:02:29.920> filled<00:02:30.220> with

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
these kind of boxes or cases filled with

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.940 
these kind of boxes or cases filled with
them<00:02:30.670> and<00:02:30.940> they<00:02:31.750> would<00:02:31.870> count<00:02:32.110> them<00:02:32.319> out<00:02:32.440> in

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
them and they would count them out in

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.460 
them and they would count them out in
these<00:02:33.190> huge<00:02:33.430> drums<00:02:33.910> these<00:02:34.480> huge<00:02:34.750> machines<00:02:34.959> and

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
these huge drums these huge machines and

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.320 
these huge drums these huge machines and
then<00:02:36.069> depending<00:02:36.489> on<00:02:36.610> how<00:02:36.760> many<00:02:36.819> of<00:02:37.030> these<00:02:37.269> you

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
then depending on how many of these you

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:41.600 
then depending on how many of these you
had<00:02:38.040> you<00:02:39.040> could<00:02:39.190> get<00:02:39.430> either<00:02:40.140> prizes<00:02:41.140> like

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
had you could get either prizes like

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.770 
had you could get either prizes like
animals<00:02:42.610> stuffed<00:02:42.849> animals<00:02:43.209> things<00:02:43.420> like<00:02:43.569> that

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
animals stuffed animals things like that

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.780 
animals stuffed animals things like that
at<00:02:43.959> the<00:02:44.049> beginning<00:02:44.349> and<00:02:44.620> then<00:02:45.250> they<00:02:45.459> started

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
at the beginning and then they started

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:47.580 
at the beginning and then they started
to<00:02:45.940> change<00:02:46.150> it<00:02:46.329> to<00:02:46.480> cash<00:02:46.780> prizes

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
to change it to cash prizes

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.250 
to change it to cash prizes
so<00:02:48.010> essentially<00:02:48.610> you<00:02:48.910> are<00:02:48.959> gambling<00:02:49.959> and

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
so essentially you are gambling and

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.199 
so essentially you are gambling and
you're<00:02:50.650> getting<00:02:50.829> money<00:02:51.160> for<00:02:51.519> it<00:02:51.670> but<00:02:51.970> because

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
you're getting money for it but because

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:54.720 
you're getting money for it but because
it's<00:02:52.599> in<00:02:52.750> the<00:02:52.989> shape<00:02:53.200> of<00:02:53.380> a<00:02:53.530> prize<00:02:53.860> instead<00:02:54.579> of

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
it's in the shape of a prize instead of

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.920 
it's in the shape of a prize instead of
like<00:02:55.000> directly<00:02:55.959> giving<00:02:56.260> cash<00:02:57.000> it's<00:02:58.000> it's<00:02:58.690> been

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
like directly giving cash it's it's been

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.460 
like directly giving cash it's it's been
legalized<00:02:59.530> so<00:03:00.160> pachinko<00:03:00.670> is<00:03:00.819> like<00:03:01.090> the<00:03:01.239> only

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
legalized so pachinko is like the only

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.250 
legalized so pachinko is like the only
legalized<00:03:02.470> form<00:03:02.799> of<00:03:02.950> gambling<00:03:03.310> in<00:03:03.430> Japan<00:03:03.819> and

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
legalized form of gambling in Japan and

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.390 
legalized form of gambling in Japan and
like<00:03:05.260> I<00:03:05.349> said<00:03:05.530> before<00:03:05.680> these<00:03:06.010> things<00:03:06.190> are

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
like I said before these things are

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.330 
like I said before these things are
really<00:03:06.790> loud<00:03:07.239> especially<00:03:07.810> when<00:03:08.290> you<00:03:08.470> have<00:03:09.310> a

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
really loud especially when you have a

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.910 
really loud especially when you have a
lot<00:03:09.579> of<00:03:09.730> balls<00:03:10.209> floating<00:03:10.660> around<00:03:10.750> in<00:03:11.079> here<00:03:11.319> it

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
lot of balls floating around in here it

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.610 
lot of balls floating around in here it
just<00:03:12.069> sounds<00:03:12.430> like<00:03:12.489> a<00:03:13.390> bunch<00:03:13.959> of<00:03:14.079> marbles<00:03:14.440> in<00:03:14.590> a

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
just sounds like a bunch of marbles in a

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.370 
just sounds like a bunch of marbles in a
washing<00:03:14.829> machine<00:03:15.040> but<00:03:15.690> these<00:03:16.690> speakers<00:03:17.079> here

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:17.380 
washing machine but these speakers here

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:19.289 
washing machine but these speakers here
they're<00:03:18.010> designed<00:03:18.430> the<00:03:18.850> way<00:03:18.970> that<00:03:19.180> these

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:19.299 
they're designed the way that these

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:21.720 
they're designed the way that these
systems<00:03:19.780> are<00:03:19.930> designed<00:03:19.959> is<00:03:20.739> they're<00:03:21.579> supposed

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
systems are designed is they're supposed

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.000 
systems are designed is they're supposed
to<00:03:22.000> be<00:03:22.150> loud<00:03:22.359> because<00:03:22.840> these<00:03:23.109> machines<00:03:23.590> are<00:03:23.769> so

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
to be loud because these machines are so

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:26.490 
to be loud because these machines are so
noisy<00:03:24.910> when<00:03:25.480> the<00:03:25.630> balls<00:03:25.810> are<00:03:26.019> going<00:03:26.170> around

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
noisy when the balls are going around

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.410 
noisy when the balls are going around
these<00:03:27.130> speakers<00:03:27.400> have<00:03:27.670> to<00:03:27.790> put<00:03:27.940> out<00:03:28.030> a<00:03:28.060> lot<00:03:28.269> of

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 
these speakers have to put out a lot of

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.620 
these speakers have to put out a lot of
sound<00:03:28.660> so<00:03:29.290> naturally<00:03:30.280> when<00:03:30.819> you<00:03:31.269> plug<00:03:31.480> these

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:31.630

don't have anything set up these things

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.500 
don't have anything set up these things

small ones here I got these out of an
old<00:03:44.769> Famicom<00:03:45.250> disk<00:03:45.280> system<00:03:45.609> one<00:03:46.180> on<00:03:46.299> this<00:03:46.450> side

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:46.660 
old Famicom disk system one on this side

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.839 
old Famicom disk system one on this side
and<00:03:46.840> then<00:03:46.959> one<00:03:47.109> on<00:03:47.139> this<00:03:47.349> side<00:03:47.560> and<00:03:47.799> I<00:03:48.549> was<00:03:48.700> able

00:03:48.839 --> 00:03:48.849 
and then one on this side and I was able

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:50.640 
and then one on this side and I was able
to<00:03:48.970> adjust<00:03:49.389> the<00:03:49.569> volume<00:03:49.720> down<00:03:50.079> just<00:03:50.530> a<00:03:50.620> little

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
to adjust the volume down just a little

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:53.520 
to adjust the volume down just a little
bit<00:03:50.889> so<00:03:51.340> make<00:03:51.940> it<00:03:52.090> bearable<00:03:52.299> when<00:03:52.720> you<00:03:52.870> when

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
bit so make it bearable when you when

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:57.240 
bit so make it bearable when you when
you're<00:03:53.650> playing<00:03:53.680> with<00:03:54.099> it<00:03:54.310> but<00:03:55.060> um<00:03:55.709> yeah<00:03:56.709> these

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
you're playing with it but um yeah these

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:00.690 
you're playing with it but um yeah these
things<00:03:57.459> are<00:03:57.609> really<00:03:57.940> narrow<00:03:58.799> really<00:03:59.799> thin<00:04:00.069> as

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:00.700 
things are really narrow really thin as

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:03.960 
things are really narrow really thin as
you<00:04:00.880> can<00:04:01.030> see<00:04:01.209> here<00:04:01.480> the<00:04:02.169> width<00:04:02.739> is<00:04:02.980> it's<00:04:03.790> not

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 
you can see here the width is it's not

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:05.729 
you can see here the width is it's not
very<00:04:04.030> big<00:04:04.419> at<00:04:04.540> all<00:04:04.630> these<00:04:05.440> are<00:04:05.590> usually

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:05.739 
very big at all these are usually

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:09.300 
very big at all these are usually
encased<00:04:06.579> in<00:04:06.849> a<00:04:07.150> huge<00:04:07.690> role<00:04:08.049> in<00:04:08.310> pachinko

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.310 
encased in a huge role in pachinko

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:12.390 
encased in a huge role in pachinko
parlors<00:04:09.819> and<00:04:10.530> usually<00:04:11.530> in<00:04:11.620> case<00:04:11.799> in<00:04:11.950> like<00:04:12.130> wood

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 
parlors and usually in case in like wood

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.069 
parlors and usually in case in like wood
so<00:04:13.030> easily<00:04:13.840> removable<00:04:14.500> they're<00:04:15.190> still<00:04:15.489> heavy

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:16.079 
so easily removable they're still heavy

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:18.479 
so easily removable they're still heavy
I'm<00:04:17.079> trying<00:04:17.410> to<00:04:17.500> think<00:04:17.680> this<00:04:17.829> one<00:04:18.039> weighs<00:04:18.250> I

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.489 
I'm trying to think this one weighs I

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:23.290 
I'm trying to think this one weighs I
think<00:04:18.700> about<00:04:18.910> 50<00:04:19.810> kilos<00:04:20.200> or<00:04:20.880> around<00:04:21.880> that

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:23.300 
think about 50 kilos or around that

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.300 
think about 50 kilos or around that
a<00:04:23.330> bit<00:04:23.569> on<00:04:23.900> the<00:04:24.199> heavy<00:04:24.409> side<00:04:24.500> although<00:04:25.009> it<00:04:25.129> does

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:25.310 
a bit on the heavy side although it does

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:29.499 
a bit on the heavy side although it does
look<00:04:25.520> pretty<00:04:25.729> light<00:04:26.289> but<00:04:28.210> close<00:04:29.210> it<00:04:29.389> up<00:04:29.449> here

00:04:29.499 --> 00:04:29.509 
look pretty light but close it up here

00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:35.580 
look pretty light but close it up here
and<00:04:30.669> we'll<00:04:31.669> turn<00:04:31.849> it<00:04:32.000> on<00:04:32.060> again<00:04:32.360> I<00:04:32.690> don't<00:04:32.900> see

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:35.590 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:37.839 

it's<00:04:36.590> not<00:04:36.740> gonna<00:04:36.830> be<00:04:37.009> too<00:04:37.250> much<00:04:37.400> different

00:04:37.839 --> 00:04:37.849 
it's not gonna be too much different

00:04:37.849 --> 00:04:42.129 
it's not gonna be too much different
than<00:04:38.000> the<00:04:38.150> last<00:04:38.690> video<00:04:39.020> here<00:04:39.409> but<00:04:41.110> you<00:04:42.110> have

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:42.139 
than the last video here but you have

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:43.869 
than the last video here but you have
all<00:04:42.440> the<00:04:42.620> different<00:04:42.860> lighting<00:04:43.340> on<00:04:43.639> the

00:04:43.869 --> 00:04:43.879 
all the different lighting on the

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:46.439 
all the different lighting on the
outside<00:04:44.270> here<00:04:44.690> on<00:04:44.840> the<00:04:45.080> outside<00:04:45.379> of<00:04:45.500> the<00:04:45.560> panel

00:04:46.439 --> 00:04:46.449 
outside here on the outside of the panel

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:49.420 
outside here on the outside of the panel
these<00:04:47.449> are<00:04:47.569> just<00:04:47.720> regular<00:04:48.039> twist<00:04:49.039> out<00:04:49.190> light

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:49.430 
these are just regular twist out light

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:52.719 
these are just regular twist out light
bulbs<00:04:49.789> so<00:04:50.599> if<00:04:51.110> you<00:04:51.259> can<00:04:51.379> see<00:04:51.560> here<00:04:51.770> just<00:04:52.220> twist

00:04:52.719 --> 00:04:52.729 
bulbs so if you can see here just twist

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:54.999 
bulbs so if you can see here just twist
em<00:04:52.849> I'll<00:04:52.970> pop<00:04:53.240> them<00:04:53.389> out<00:04:53.509> and<00:04:53.860> all<00:04:54.860> the

00:04:54.999 --> 00:04:55.009 
em I'll pop them out and all the

00:04:55.009 --> 00:04:57.189 
em I'll pop them out and all the
circuitry<00:04:55.400> is<00:04:55.520> in<00:04:55.669> the<00:04:55.789> back<00:04:55.969> so<00:04:56.599> it's<00:04:56.990> kind<00:04:57.169> of

00:04:57.189 --> 00:04:57.199 
circuitry is in the back so it's kind of

00:04:57.199 --> 00:05:00.270 
circuitry is in the back so it's kind of
hard<00:04:57.379> to<00:04:57.440> get<00:04:58.039> a<00:04:58.069> look<00:04:58.280> at<00:04:58.370> that<00:04:58.430> from<00:04:58.819> here<00:04:59.150> but

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:00.280 
hard to get a look at that from here but

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:03.909 
hard to get a look at that from here but
I<00:05:01.280> would<00:05:02.030> try<00:05:02.629> and<00:05:02.719> show<00:05:02.960> you<00:05:03.020> this<00:05:03.289> thing<00:05:03.530> with

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:03.919 
I would try and show you this thing with

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:06.070 
I would try and show you this thing with
the<00:05:04.069> door<00:05:04.340> open<00:05:04.729> in<00:05:04.969> action<00:05:05.449> but<00:05:05.690> because<00:05:06.050> of

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:06.080 
the door open in action but because of

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:07.869 
the door open in action but because of
the<00:05:06.229> fact<00:05:06.409> that<00:05:06.560> the<00:05:06.740> balls<00:05:06.979> is<00:05:07.370> come<00:05:07.610> flying

00:05:07.869 --> 00:05:07.879 
the fact that the balls is come flying

00:05:07.879 --> 00:05:10.059 
the fact that the balls is come flying
out<00:05:08.120> like<00:05:08.449> this<00:05:08.659> direction<00:05:09.229> without<00:05:09.949> this

00:05:10.059 --> 00:05:10.069 
out like this direction without this

00:05:10.069 --> 00:05:13.689 
out like this direction without this
glass<00:05:10.340> pane<00:05:10.669> in<00:05:10.849> there<00:05:11.199> it<00:05:12.199> it's<00:05:12.979> impossible

00:05:13.689 --> 00:05:13.699 
glass pane in there it it's impossible

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:28.269 
glass pane in there it it's impossible
but<00:05:16.060> so<00:05:18.009> it's<00:05:19.009> more<00:05:19.280> of<00:05:19.400> these<00:05:26.770> now<00:05:27.770> if<00:05:28.039> you

00:05:28.269 --> 00:05:28.279 
but so it's more of these now if you

00:05:28.279 --> 00:05:36.760 
but so it's more of these now if you
lightly<00:05:34.360> it<00:05:35.360> won't<00:05:35.569> go<00:05:35.779> any<00:05:35.990> further<00:05:36.080> than<00:05:36.440> up

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:36.770 
lightly it won't go any further than up

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:40.749 
lightly it won't go any further than up
here<00:05:37.120> if<00:05:38.120> we<00:05:38.419> try<00:05:39.199> and<00:05:39.409> do<00:05:40.130> this<00:05:40.279> a<00:05:40.310> little<00:05:40.520> bit

00:05:40.749 --> 00:05:40.759 
here if we try and do this a little bit

00:05:40.759 --> 00:05:43.809 
here if we try and do this a little bit
stronger<00:05:41.800> you'll<00:05:42.800> see<00:05:43.009> now<00:05:43.279> they're<00:05:43.490> starting

00:05:43.809 --> 00:05:43.819 
stronger you'll see now they're starting

00:05:43.819 --> 00:05:46.540 
stronger you'll see now they're starting
to<00:05:43.849> come<00:05:43.969> on

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:46.550 

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:49.680 

and<00:05:46.639> the<00:05:47.210> whole<00:05:47.419> idea<00:05:47.449> behind<00:05:47.870> pachinko<00:05:48.620> -<00:05:49.039> is

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:49.690 
and the whole idea behind pachinko - is

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:53.559 
and the whole idea behind pachinko - is
you<00:05:50.690> want<00:05:50.840> to<00:05:50.930> have<00:05:51.050> a<00:05:51.110> constant<00:05:52.569> constant

00:05:53.559 --> 00:05:53.569 
you want to have a constant constant

00:05:53.569 --> 00:05:55.779 
you want to have a constant constant
thing<00:05:53.900> going<00:05:54.259> so<00:05:54.620> if<00:05:54.919> you<00:05:55.280> find<00:05:55.550> a<00:05:55.639> good

00:05:55.779 --> 00:05:55.789 
thing going so if you find a good

00:05:55.789 --> 00:05:57.460 
thing going so if you find a good
position<00:05:56.120> where<00:05:56.449> most<00:05:56.780> of<00:05:56.900> the<00:05:57.020> balls<00:05:57.199> are

00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:57.470 
position where most of the balls are

00:05:57.470 --> 00:05:58.899 
position where most of the balls are
coming<00:05:57.620> down<00:05:57.949> and<00:05:58.280> they're<00:05:58.430> landing<00:05:58.759> in<00:05:58.849> the

00:05:58.899 --> 00:05:58.909 
coming down and they're landing in the

00:05:58.909 --> 00:06:00.700 
coming down and they're landing in the
middle<00:05:58.970> you<00:05:59.659> basically<00:06:00.110> got<00:06:00.319> to<00:06:00.440> keep<00:06:00.590> your

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:00.710 
middle you basically got to keep your

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:03.730 
middle you basically got to keep your
hand<00:06:00.919> in<00:06:01.039> that<00:06:01.069> position<00:06:01.750> if<00:06:02.750> you<00:06:03.020> let<00:06:03.199> go<00:06:03.229> then

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:03.740 
hand in that position if you let go then

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:06.040 
hand in that position if you let go then
you're<00:06:03.949> risking<00:06:04.400> missing<00:06:05.090> a<00:06:05.300> continuous

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:06.050 
you're risking missing a continuous

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:07.779 
you're risking missing a continuous
bonus<00:06:06.440> that<00:06:06.650> happens<00:06:07.039> with<00:06:07.280> these<00:06:07.430> pachinko

00:06:07.779 --> 00:06:07.789 
bonus that happens with these pachinko
