00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.810
 We welcome to a new one 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.850
 video on a channel 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.830
 I made notes even me today 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.200
 and it's about the fifa 16 thing 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.090
 probably or included to 100 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.429
 are and then it is also about mine 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.990
 wunschliste for FIFA 16 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.080
 But I'll start with things first 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.779
 that are really relevant and not only 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.369
 My wishes are but first the 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.960
 Women's teams will be on everyone 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.220
 case there were a few national teams 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.140
 I've already got that for you 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.720
 think you all know that too 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:34.440
 and then there is a rumor the new one 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.300
 commentators at 416 are frank 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.910
 bushman he has just a few 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.190
 things announced on his facebook 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.680
 page and so it also excites him 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.539
 the sayings of him and so always wrong 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.730
 be switched to aid 16 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.129
 and I think he does not have that anymore either 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.770
 maybe just bum on it maybe 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.449
 there are also new commentators and 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.750
 then maybe it was there too 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.350
 is a new story mode story 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.140
 mode 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:04.409
 it was just that the revenue 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.840
 designer was looking for a story mode 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.320
 And that should also help sports betting 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.330
 to have 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.240
 so many now assume that it is 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:15.210
 for fifa 16 will be but it is just called 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.100
 even the fifa ea sports than to 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.540
 it sits so sitting on a fifa 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.189
 may also be that there is only too much the 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.500
 then come sit 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.900
 it was released by ea that 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.150
 No pyrotechnics drankommt they have indeed 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.979
 many desired but ea wants too 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.500
 retain this role model function 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.299
 and then he announced that it was 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.759
 There is no third league because they are easy 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.920
 have no licenses for it and if so 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.170
 i think i will be overpriced and expensive 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.000
 he also announced that unfortunately no 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.310
 hallen mode are six again 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.460
 so many have wished 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.649
 and then it's called the ea one 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.350
 perfect laptop version out 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:54.180
 I think that could work 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.189
 really agree 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.810
 an internet forum so on everyone 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:01.259
 case really wet for the laptop 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.540
 Owner then I wanted to say one more 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.920
 Major mode is my wish list 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.659
 actually the only thing I have 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.429
 really wish and maybe easy 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.560
 its price is here i come 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.569
 but again in the raid mode 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.430
 that you can either adjust that 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:16.200
 one is gold only 5000 because it can play 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.239
 or that would be the player 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.610
 just right if you like that 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:22.890
 officially vader mode could play and 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.209
 maybe against friends but ea 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.160
 then think probably that one 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:28.500
 transfer something with kohls like that 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.390
 could something be there again 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.980
 and that's why I'm not like that 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.050
 it is not safe or likely 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:37.830
 so that a major mode is present 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:39.810
 besides, a small wish is to me 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.459
 either an improvement of the circle 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.069
 range or that they take out completely 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:47.130
 because as well as that at the moment is that one 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:49.860
 player always can not be sold 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:52.380
 it probably can not be so ea 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.450
 It should be there either every day 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:57.810
 the cheap players can improve 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:59.640
 or just do no more as well 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.310
 I want that, for example, is one 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.200
 price has between 100 to 150 thousand 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.930
 that you can really afford it 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:09.780
 for that, the fifa points must be lower 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:12.470
 make the appeal and the packs cheaper 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:15.359
 makes otherwise rather small pieks when round 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:16.980
 450,000 that you can buy on each 

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:19.049
 case I would be interested in what he 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.390
 think about it just let mike 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:23.370
 davis liked this video and if so 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:26.069
 you also want to do things like that 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:28.350
 said my wish list and yes 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:32.430
 Write something in the comments 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:34.859
 holds and what your wishes are and 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:37.040
 then as I said I'm out people skin 

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:37.040
 purely
