00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.770 

I<00:00:07.940> think<00:00:08.940> there<00:00:09.059> are<00:00:09.090> a<00:00:09.150> couple<00:00:09.330> of<00:00:09.510> key

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
I think there are a couple of key

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.430 
I think there are a couple of key
takeaways<00:00:09.990> for<00:00:10.650> me<00:00:10.860> in<00:00:11.190> this<00:00:11.429> report<00:00:12.440> the

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
takeaways for me in this report the

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.589 
takeaways for me in this report the
first<00:00:13.680> is<00:00:14.330> just<00:00:15.330> the<00:00:15.900> having<00:00:16.740> a<00:00:17.040> real<00:00:17.939> solid

00:00:18.589 --> 00:00:18.599 
first is just the having a real solid

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:20.659 
first is just the having a real solid
estimate<00:00:19.290> of<00:00:19.500> how<00:00:19.680> large<00:00:19.980> the<00:00:20.220> public<00:00:20.520> health

00:00:20.659 --> 00:00:20.669 
estimate of how large the public health

00:00:20.669 --> 00:00:25.060 
estimate of how large the public health
workforce<00:00:20.880> is<00:00:21.720> and<00:00:22.050> the<00:00:23.039> diverse<00:00:23.750> kinds<00:00:24.750> of

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:25.070 
workforce is and the diverse kinds of

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:27.470 
workforce is and the diverse kinds of
activities<00:00:26.070> and<00:00:26.099> duties<00:00:26.730> that<00:00:26.939> public<00:00:27.300> health

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
and provides some real depth of

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.759 
and provides some real depth of
understanding<00:00:36.089> that<00:00:36.930> we<00:00:37.019> haven't<00:00:37.350> had<00:00:37.530> before

00:00:37.759 --> 00:00:37.769 
understanding that we haven't had before

00:00:37.769 --> 00:00:40.630 
understanding that we haven't had before

other key takeaway was the importance of

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:24.739

education and making sure that more and
more<00:01:29.490> that<00:01:29.820> we<00:01:29.969> see<00:01:30.329> public<00:01:31.259> health<00:01:31.560> nurses<00:01:32.009> as

00:01:32.209 --> 00:01:32.219 
more that we see public health nurses as

more that we see public health nurses as
being<00:01:32.640> prepared<00:01:34.249> educationally<00:01:35.249> for<00:01:36.060> the

00:01:38.239 --> 00:01:38.249 
jobs that public health needs to have

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:41.809 
jobs that public health needs to have
done<00:01:38.490> and<00:01:38.840> in<00:01:39.840> order<00:01:40.079> to<00:01:40.259> do<00:01:40.619> that<00:01:40.829> they<00:01:41.310> really

00:01:41.809 --> 00:01:41.819 
done and in order to do that they really

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:44.090 
done and in order to do that they really
need<00:01:41.999> to<00:01:42.119> have<00:01:42.299> bachelor's<00:01:43.020> preparation<00:01:43.740> for

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
need to have bachelor's preparation for

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:53.780 
need to have bachelor's preparation for
entry<00:01:44.640> into<00:01:44.759> practice<00:01:45.270> in<00:01:45.450> public<00:01:45.749> health

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.820 

you

00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:58.830 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.630 

you<00:01:59.820> know<00:01:59.940> there's<00:02:00.560> tremendous

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
you know there's tremendous

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.000 
you know there's tremendous
transformation<00:02:02.640> going<00:02:02.910> on<00:02:03.240> in<00:02:03.830> public<00:02:04.830> health

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:05.010 
transformation going on in public health

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:08.859 
transformation going on in public health
and<00:02:05.370> in<00:02:05.610> health<00:02:05.880> care<00:02:06.150> and<00:02:06.480> I<00:02:07.140> think<00:02:07.170> by<00:02:07.560> 2020

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
and in health care and I think by 2020

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:11.930 
and in health care and I think by 2020
we're<00:02:09.869> not<00:02:10.050> going<00:02:10.200> to<00:02:10.229> recognize<00:02:10.860> the<00:02:11.340> health

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
we're not going to recognize the health

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.940 
we're not going to recognize the health
care<00:02:12.150> system<00:02:12.720> or<00:02:12.960> the<00:02:13.260> public<00:02:13.560> health<00:02:13.740> system

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
care system or the public health system

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.140 
care system or the public health system
as<00:02:14.670> we<00:02:14.910> know<00:02:14.940> it<00:02:15.090> today<00:02:15.890> so<00:02:16.890> I<00:02:17.280> think<00:02:17.880> what's

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
as we know it today so I think what's

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.230 
as we know it today so I think what's
happening<00:02:18.660> with<00:02:18.990> some<00:02:19.740> of<00:02:19.800> the<00:02:19.950> changes<00:02:20.520> with

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
happening with some of the changes with

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.500 
happening with some of the changes with
the<00:02:21.420> Affordable<00:02:21.930> Care<00:02:21.960> Act<00:02:23.390> increasing<00:02:24.390> the

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
the Affordable Care Act increasing the

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.970 
the Affordable Care Act increasing the
amount<00:02:24.810> of<00:02:25.370> the<00:02:26.370> population<00:02:26.970> that's<00:02:27.120> covered

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
amount of the population that's covered

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.660 
amount of the population that's covered
in<00:02:28.980> in<00:02:29.550> many<00:02:29.790> places<00:02:30.920> we're<00:02:31.920> going<00:02:32.190> to<00:02:32.370> see

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
in in many places we're going to see

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.540 
in in many places we're going to see
many<00:02:33.510> health<00:02:33.780> departments<00:02:34.380> getting<00:02:35.070> out<00:02:35.310> of

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
many health departments getting out of

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.740 
many health departments getting out of
some<00:02:35.910> of<00:02:36.030> the<00:02:36.150> direct<00:02:36.540> care<00:02:37.140> business<00:02:38.150> and<00:02:39.150> I

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
some of the direct care business and I

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.740 
some of the direct care business and I
think<00:02:40.230> at<00:02:40.710> the<00:02:40.920> same<00:02:41.130> time<00:02:41.600> there<00:02:42.600> will<00:02:42.690> be

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
think at the same time there will be

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.270 
think at the same time there will be
other<00:02:43.110> things<00:02:43.230> that<00:02:43.710> public<00:02:44.100> health

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
other things that public health

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.950 
other things that public health
departments<00:02:45.000> will<00:02:45.150> be<00:02:45.180> doing<00:02:45.600> that<00:02:45.780> they're

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:45.960 
departments will be doing that they're

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.770 
departments will be doing that they're
not<00:02:45.990> doing<00:02:46.470> now<00:02:46.970> so<00:02:47.970> to<00:02:48.060> the<00:02:48.330> extent<00:02:48.570> that

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
not doing now so to the extent that

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.260 
not doing now so to the extent that
these<00:02:49.250> transformations<00:02:50.250> that<00:02:50.760> are<00:02:50.880> taking

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 
these transformations that are taking

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:54.920 
these transformations that are taking
place<00:02:51.510> the<00:02:52.940> reorganization<00:02:53.940> or<00:02:54.150> realignment

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
place the reorganization or realignment

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.220 
place the reorganization or realignment
of<00:02:55.020> health<00:02:55.320> departments<00:02:56.030> with<00:02:57.030> the<00:02:57.720> needs<00:02:57.990> and

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
their communities as long as these

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.560 
their communities as long as these
things<00:03:00.870> are<00:03:01.020> being<00:03:01.200> done<00:03:01.470> in<00:03:01.890> a<00:03:02.070> way<00:03:02.100> that

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:02.570 
things are being done in a way that

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:08.000 
things are being done in a way that
involves<00:03:03.570> a<00:03:03.690> community<00:03:04.820> that<00:03:05.820> is<00:03:06.739> clear<00:03:07.739> and

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
involves a community that is clear and

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:12.560 
involves a community that is clear and
transparent<00:03:08.340> to<00:03:09.620> the<00:03:10.620> the<00:03:11.190> voters<00:03:11.580> the

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
transparent to the the voters the

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:14.270 
transparent to the the voters the
residents<00:03:13.140> of<00:03:13.290> these<00:03:13.380> communities<00:03:13.980> that<00:03:14.160> are

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
residents of these communities that are

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.800 
residents of these communities that are
being<00:03:14.430> served<00:03:14.730> by<00:03:14.910> the<00:03:14.970> health<00:03:15.180> department's

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
being served by the health department's

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.350 
being served by the health department's
the<00:03:15.840> policymakers<00:03:16.830> then<00:03:17.610> I<00:03:17.820> really<00:03:18.150> don't

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
the policymakers then I really don't

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.449 
the policymakers then I really don't
have<00:03:18.450> concerns<00:03:19.200> about<00:03:19.530> the<00:03:19.830> changes<00:03:20.280> that<00:03:20.400> are

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
have concerns about the changes that are

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:29.000 
have concerns about the changes that are
taking<00:03:20.550> place

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:34.020 

you

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:38.810 

well<00:03:34.990> I<00:03:35.020> I<00:03:35.410> think<00:03:35.530> that<00:03:36.360> compensation<00:03:37.360> and

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:38.820 
well I I think that compensation and

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:41.970 
well I I think that compensation and
opportunities<00:03:39.820> for<00:03:40.060> promotion<00:03:40.300> are<00:03:41.110> always

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:41.980 
opportunities for promotion are always

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:47.880 
opportunities for promotion are always
key<00:03:42.490> in<00:03:43.980> recruitment<00:03:44.980> and<00:03:45.490> retention<00:03:45.820> of<00:03:46.890> any

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:47.890 
key in recruitment and retention of any

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:51.300 
key in recruitment and retention of any
part<00:03:48.250> of<00:03:48.370> a<00:03:48.460> workforce<00:03:48.910> and<00:03:49.480> so<00:03:50.310> they're

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
part of a workforce and so they're

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:54.449 
part of a workforce and so they're
highlighted<00:03:51.910> in<00:03:52.090> this<00:03:52.209> report<00:03:52.780> as<00:03:53.459> definitely

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:54.459 
highlighted in this report as definitely

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:57.990 
highlighted in this report as definitely
needing<00:03:54.970> attention<00:03:55.680> by<00:03:56.680> policymakers<00:03:57.250> and

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
needing attention by policymakers and

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.230 
needing attention by policymakers and
agency<00:03:58.570> directors<00:03:59.520> for<00:04:00.520> public<00:04:01.060> health

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
nurses across the country and I think

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.270 
nurses across the country and I think
they're<00:04:03.760> tremendously<00:04:04.300> important<00:04:05.070> but<00:04:06.070> what

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280 
they're tremendously important but what

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.990 
they're tremendously important but what
the<00:04:06.430> report<00:04:07.120> also<00:04:07.360> shows<00:04:07.900> is<00:04:08.410> that<00:04:09.220> public

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.000 
the report also shows is that public

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.470 
the report also shows is that public
health<00:04:10.300> nurses<00:04:10.720> are<00:04:10.930> very<00:04:11.730> very<00:04:12.730> satisfied

with their job they feel that they're

with their job they feel that they're

they're also voicing in this report that

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:32.070 
they're also voicing in this report that
they<00:04:29.950> really<00:04:30.340> as<00:04:30.580> a<00:04:30.940> professional<00:04:31.630> group<00:04:31.870> they

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080 
they really as a professional group they

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.860 
they really as a professional group they
really<00:04:32.410> do<00:04:32.620> have<00:04:32.830> a<00:04:33.360> tremendous<00:04:34.360> amount<00:04:34.540> of

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:34.870 
really do have a tremendous amount of

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:36.840 
really do have a tremendous amount of
both<00:04:35.310> responsibility<00:04:36.310> for<00:04:36.520> their<00:04:36.640> practice

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:36.850 
both responsibility for their practice

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:41.370 
both responsibility for their practice
and<00:04:37.830> autonomy<00:04:38.830> in<00:04:39.040> their<00:04:39.400> practice<00:04:39.940> and<00:04:40.570> I

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:41.380 
and autonomy in their practice and I

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:46.500 
and autonomy in their practice and I
think<00:04:41.770> that<00:04:42.070> these<00:04:42.370> three<00:04:43.360> factors<00:04:44.350> the<00:04:45.510> the

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:46.510 
think that these three factors the the

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:48.870 
think that these three factors the the
satisfaction<00:04:47.380> the<00:04:47.740> autonomy<00:04:48.640> and<00:04:48.820> the

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:48.880 
satisfaction the autonomy and the

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:51.930 
satisfaction the autonomy and the
responsibility<00:04:49.840> for<00:04:50.080> their<00:04:50.229> practice<00:04:50.940> are

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:51.940 
responsibility for their practice are

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:54.420 
responsibility for their practice are
all<00:04:52.210> things<00:04:52.540> that<00:04:52.919> perhaps<00:04:53.919> in<00:04:54.250> other

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:54.430 
all things that perhaps in other

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:56.850 
all things that perhaps in other
settings<00:04:54.870> nurses<00:04:55.870> don't<00:04:56.140> feel<00:04:56.500> that<00:04:56.680> they

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:56.860 
settings nurses don't feel that they

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:00.810 
settings nurses don't feel that they
have<00:04:57.100> as<00:04:57.340> much<00:04:57.370> control<00:04:57.790> over<00:04:58.560> our<00:04:59.560> are<00:05:00.460> as

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:00.820 
have as much control over our are as

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:05.159 
have as much control over our are as
able<00:05:01.600> to<00:05:01.840> make<00:05:02.820> you<00:05:03.820> know<00:05:03.940> such<00:05:04.419> contributions

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:05.169 
able to make you know such contributions

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:07.770 
able to make you know such contributions
to<00:05:05.380> an<00:05:05.470> agency's<00:05:06.010> mission<00:05:06.490> so<00:05:07.120> I<00:05:07.150> think<00:05:07.300> these

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:07.780 
to an agency's mission so I think these

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:10.560 
to an agency's mission so I think these
things<00:05:08.229> from<00:05:09.070> the<00:05:09.250> report<00:05:09.400> kind<00:05:09.940> of<00:05:10.030> stand<00:05:10.360> out

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:10.570 
things from the report kind of stand out

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:13.909 
things from the report kind of stand out
and<00:05:10.930> really<00:05:11.290> can<00:05:11.590> be<00:05:11.830> leveraged<00:05:12.520> in<00:05:12.820> terms<00:05:13.210> of

00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:13.919 
and really can be leveraged in terms of

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:17.520 
and really can be leveraged in terms of
recruiting<00:05:14.919> and<00:05:15.550> retaining<00:05:16.360> public<00:05:17.350> health

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:17.530 
recruiting and retaining public health

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:27.119 
recruiting and retaining public health
nurses<00:05:17.950> and<00:05:18.250> an<00:05:18.460> agency<00:05:18.970> level

00:05:27.119 --> 00:05:27.129 

00:05:27.129 --> 00:05:30.749 

I<00:05:28.349> say<00:05:29.349> they<00:05:29.499> definitely<00:05:29.830> should<00:05:30.219> do<00:05:30.339> it<00:05:30.520> I've

00:05:30.749 --> 00:05:30.759 
I say they definitely should do it I've

00:05:30.759 --> 00:05:32.909 
I say they definitely should do it I've
been<00:05:31.209> a<00:05:31.239> public<00:05:31.479> health<00:05:31.749> nurse<00:05:31.869> or<00:05:32.379> been<00:05:32.709> in

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:32.919 
been a public health nurse or been in

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:35.519 
been a public health nurse or been in
this<00:05:33.069> arena<00:05:33.339> for<00:05:33.819> over<00:05:34.360> 30<00:05:34.659> years<00:05:34.719> and<00:05:35.229> it's

00:05:35.519 --> 00:05:35.529 
this arena for over 30 years and it's

00:05:35.529 --> 00:05:40.469 
this arena for over 30 years and it's
been<00:05:35.649> a<00:05:35.709> blast<00:05:36.330> I<00:05:37.330> think<00:05:38.159> what<00:05:39.159> it<00:05:39.459> what<00:05:39.879> has

00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:40.479 
been a blast I think what it what has

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:43.439 
been a blast I think what it what has
come<00:05:40.689> through<00:05:40.899> in<00:05:40.989> my<00:05:41.489> career<00:05:42.489> and<00:05:42.849> I<00:05:42.999> think<00:05:43.029> is

00:05:43.439 --> 00:05:43.449 
come through in my career and I think is

00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:46.649 
come through in my career and I think is
is<00:05:43.919> spelled<00:05:44.919> out<00:05:45.069> in<00:05:45.339> aggregate<00:05:46.119> in<00:05:46.419> the

00:05:46.649 --> 00:05:46.659
