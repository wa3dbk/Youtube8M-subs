00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
event that i played this year I've only

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.060 
event that i played this year I've only
had<00:01:26.220> two<00:01:26.460> caches<00:01:26.729> I<00:01:27.450> cashed<00:01:28.320> in<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:28.530> 1500

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
had two caches I cashed in the 1500

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.060 
had two caches I cashed in the 1500
horse<00:01:29.280> and<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:29.670> 1500<00:01:30.270> PLO<00:01:30.680> for<00:01:31.680> very<00:01:31.860> little

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
horse and the 1500 PLO for very little

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.690 
horse and the 1500 PLO for very little
money<00:01:32.189> so<00:01:32.729> it's<00:01:33.119> been<00:01:33.420> a<00:01:33.450> pretty<00:01:34.079> rough<00:01:34.700> world

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
money so it's been a pretty rough world

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.480 
money so it's been a pretty rough world
series<00:01:36.090> so<00:01:36.270> far<00:01:36.299> but<00:01:37.259> I'm<00:01:37.530> hoping<00:01:38.130> to<00:01:38.310> salvage

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
series so far but I'm hoping to salvage

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.030 
series so far but I'm hoping to salvage
it<00:01:38.880> with<00:01:39.150> this<00:01:39.270> event<00:01:39.770> it's<00:01:40.770> been<00:01:40.950> an

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
it with this event it's been an

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.819 
it with this event it's been an
extremely<00:01:41.460> difficult<00:01:41.759> world<00:01:42.180> series<00:01:42.829> you

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
extremely difficult world series you

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.289 
extremely difficult world series you
know<00:01:43.950> it's<00:01:44.130> definitely<00:01:44.280> hard<00:01:44.670> to<00:01:44.729> deal<00:01:44.970> with

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
know it's definitely hard to deal with

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.149 
know it's definitely hard to deal with
the<00:01:45.990> variance<00:01:46.380> when<00:01:46.649> things<00:01:46.890> aren't<00:01:47.070> going

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
the variance when things aren't going

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:52.039 
the variance when things aren't going
your<00:01:47.369> way<00:01:47.570> I<00:01:48.950> I<00:01:50.299> was<00:01:51.299> really<00:01:51.570> looking<00:01:51.659> forward

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
your way I I was really looking forward

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.600 
your way I I was really looking forward
to<00:01:52.079> these<00:01:52.200> last<00:01:52.439> few<00:01:52.649> events<00:01:52.860> because<00:01:53.280> you

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
to these last few events because you

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.649 
to these last few events because you
know<00:01:53.700> too<00:01:54.030> big<00:01:54.390> p<00:01:54.659> lows<00:01:54.899> of<00:01:55.259> 5k<00:01:55.890> and<00:01:56.040> 10k<00:01:56.100> and

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:56.659 
know too big p lows of 5k and 10k and

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:00.200 
know too big p lows of 5k and 10k and
the<00:01:57.659> 25k<00:01:58.320> 6<00:01:58.590> max<00:01:58.829> which<00:01:59.280> unfortunately<00:01:59.670> I<00:02:00.000> had

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
the 25k 6 max which unfortunately I had

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.319 
the 25k 6 max which unfortunately I had
to<00:02:00.240> skip<00:02:00.600> today<00:02:01.040> because<00:02:02.040> I'm<00:02:02.189> in<00:02:02.340> day<00:02:02.490> three<00:02:02.820> I

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
to skip today because I'm in day three I

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.810 
to skip today because I'm in day three I
was<00:02:03.659> contemplating<00:02:03.990> playing<00:02:04.649> it<00:02:04.920> even<00:02:05.700> though

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
was contemplating playing it even though

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.150 
was contemplating playing it even though
I<00:02:05.850> was<00:02:06.090> in<00:02:06.240> this<00:02:06.390> tournament<00:02:07.170> still<00:02:07.619> because

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
I was in this tournament still because

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.540 
I was in this tournament still because
you<00:02:08.640> know<00:02:09.209> I'm<00:02:09.599> kind<00:02:10.050> of<00:02:10.110> short<00:02:10.349> not<00:02:10.830> short<00:02:11.310> but

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
you know I'm kind of short not short but
