00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:32.300 
course we're only going to take a look
at<00:02:29.860> the<00:02:29.920> ones<00:02:30.100> that<00:02:30.370> have<00:02:30.850> decently<00:02:31.420> high<00:02:31.600> bar

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
at the ones that have decently high bar

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.080 
at the ones that have decently high bar
because<00:02:33.310> those<00:02:33.520> are<00:02:33.640> the<00:02:33.700> ones<00:02:33.790> that<00:02:33.940> he's

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
because those are the ones that he's

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.190 
because those are the ones that he's
used<00:02:34.300> the<00:02:34.420> most<00:02:34.600> but<00:02:35.410> we<00:02:35.739> look<00:02:35.920> at<00:02:36.069> a<00:02:36.100> g36<00:02:36.790> here

seventeen<00:03:23.110> percent<00:03:23.260> accuracy<00:03:23.799> but<00:03:24.130> again<00:03:24.340> he

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489 
seventeen percent accuracy but again he

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:26.940 
seventeen percent accuracy but again he
uses<00:03:24.820> rapid<00:03:25.209> fire<00:03:25.390> and<00:03:25.630> extended<00:03:26.079> mag<00:03:26.260> so<00:03:26.560> he

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
uses rapid fire and extended mag so he

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.610 
uses rapid fire and extended mag so he
could<00:03:27.190> be<00:03:27.400> a<00:03:27.430> little<00:03:27.670> bit<00:03:27.820> more<00:03:28.320> spraying<00:03:29.320> with

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
could be a little bit more spraying with

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.830 
could be a little bit more spraying with
that<00:03:29.829> I<00:03:29.860> guess<00:03:30.250> it's<00:03:30.510> extremely<00:03:31.510> high<00:03:31.630> rate<00:03:31.780> of

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
that I guess it's extremely high rate of

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.160 
that I guess it's extremely high rate of
fire<00:03:31.959> but<00:03:32.739> as<00:03:32.829> you<00:03:32.950> can<00:03:33.040> see<00:03:33.130> with<00:03:33.220> the<00:03:33.310> mp7<00:03:34.170> 194

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.170

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:39.440 
fire but as you can see with the mp7 194
KD<00:03:35.890> but<00:03:36.160> definitely<00:03:36.730> a<00:03:36.790> better<00:03:36.940> accuracy<00:03:37.500> and

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
KD but definitely a better accuracy and

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.090

actually<00:03:40.450> I<00:03:40.480> would<00:03:40.660> have<00:03:41.170> doing<00:03:41.709> those<00:03:42.010> are

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:42.100 
actually I would have doing those are

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.160 
actually I would have doing those are
very<00:03:42.250> close<00:03:42.579> but<00:03:42.880> the<00:03:43.000> type<00:03:43.150> 95<00:03:43.450> is<00:03:43.810> higher

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:44.170 
very close but the type 95 is higher

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:47.160 
very close but the type 95 is higher
than<00:03:44.440> the<00:03:44.500> mp7<00:03:44.910> then<00:03:45.910> we<00:03:46.030> go<00:03:46.150> to<00:03:46.209> the<00:03:46.390> m4<00:03:46.959> which

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:47.170
