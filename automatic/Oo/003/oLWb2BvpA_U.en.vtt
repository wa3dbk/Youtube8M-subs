00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
listed them as rear so I'm not really

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.080 
listed them as rear so I'm not really
sure<00:00:40.620> of<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:40.739> rear<00:00:40.980> but<00:00:41.190> they're<00:00:41.309> called<00:00:41.550> um

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
sure of the rear but they're called um

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.119 
sure of the rear but they're called um
pie<00:00:42.450> shell<00:00:42.780> and<00:00:43.079> they're<00:00:43.290> these<00:00:43.500> fresh<00:00:43.800> cream

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
pie shell and they're these fresh cream

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.220 
pie shell and they're these fresh cream
ones<00:00:44.370> so<00:00:44.969> they<00:00:45.120> look<00:00:45.239> like<00:00:45.270> this<00:00:45.600> and<00:00:45.870> they're

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
ones so they look like this and they're

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.990 
ones so they look like this and they're
actually<00:00:46.379> pretty<00:00:46.559> thick<00:00:47.190> and<00:00:47.399> I<00:00:47.579> do<00:00:47.640> have<00:00:47.969> one

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
actually pretty thick and I do have one

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.729 
actually pretty thick and I do have one
that's<00:00:48.180> already<00:00:48.600> open<00:00:48.780> because<00:00:49.170> half<00:00:49.530> of<00:00:49.649> the

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
that's already open because half of the

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.439 
that's already open because half of the
package<00:00:50.160> was<00:00:50.340> kind<00:00:50.550> of<00:00:50.640> open<00:00:50.910> so<00:00:51.090> I<00:00:51.120> think<00:00:51.239> I

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
package was kind of open so I think I

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.139 
package was kind of open so I think I
might<00:00:51.570> just<00:00:51.780> keep<00:00:51.899> this<00:00:52.050> one<00:00:52.230> for<00:00:52.379> myself<00:00:53.149> so

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
might just keep this one for myself so

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.360 
might just keep this one for myself so
it<00:00:54.420> looks<00:00:54.600> like<00:00:54.719> this<00:00:55.170> and<00:00:55.590> it's<00:00:56.250> really

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
it looks like this and it's really

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:03.889 
it looks like this and it's really
really<00:00:56.760> squishy<00:01:01.550> so<00:01:02.550> I<00:01:02.579> got<00:01:02.879> those<00:01:03.090> and<00:01:03.449> next<00:01:03.809> I

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
really squishy so I got those and next I

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.929

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
of like a stress so I got a bunch of

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.690

those and the next thing I got are these

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.510 
those and the next thing I got are these
bread<00:02:16.060> wrist<00:02:16.330> cushions<00:02:16.810> and<00:02:17.470> this<00:02:17.860> one<00:02:18.070> is<00:02:18.310> a

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
bread wrist cushions and this one is a

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:19.920 
bread wrist cushions and this one is a
baguette<00:02:19.120> and<00:02:19.330> I<00:02:19.450> think<00:02:19.660> that's<00:02:19.780> how<00:02:19.870> you

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
baguette and I think that's how you

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.450 
baguette and I think that's how you
pronounce<00:02:20.140> it<00:02:20.440> and<00:02:20.740> it<00:02:20.920> comes<00:02:21.130> in<00:02:21.340> this

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:21.460 
pronounce it and it comes in this

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:23.130 
pronounce it and it comes in this
packaging<00:02:22.060> and<00:02:22.270> it<00:02:22.510> tells<00:02:22.690> you<00:02:22.780> that<00:02:22.810> it<00:02:23.020> can

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
packaging and it tells you that it can

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:24.540 
packaging and it tells you that it can
be<00:02:23.170> used<00:02:23.380> for<00:02:23.530> like<00:02:23.740> a<00:02:23.770> mouse<00:02:24.010> wrist<00:02:24.310> cushion

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
be used for like a mouse wrist cushion

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:27.000 
be used for like a mouse wrist cushion
so<00:02:25.030> it<00:02:25.330> looks<00:02:25.720> like<00:02:25.810> this<00:02:26.050> and<00:02:26.380> it<00:02:26.530> is<00:02:26.560> really

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
so it looks like this and it is really

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:35.610 
so it looks like this and it is really
squishy<00:02:33.540> so<00:02:34.540> that<00:02:34.780> is<00:02:35.050> pretty<00:02:35.380> much

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
squishy so that is pretty much

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.470 
squishy so that is pretty much
everything<00:02:35.890> that<00:02:36.430> I<00:02:36.459> got<00:02:36.700> and<00:02:37.000> the<00:02:37.090> reason<00:02:37.360> I'm
