00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
well i think that the tag team division

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.030 
well i think that the tag team division
WWE<00:01:50.130> has<00:01:50.399> definitely<00:01:51.229> blown<00:01:52.229> up<00:01:52.470> over<00:01:52.950> the

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
WWE has definitely blown up over the

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.950 
WWE has definitely blown up over the
last<00:01:53.250> year<00:01:53.640> or<00:01:53.670> so<00:01:53.820> because<00:01:54.210> i<00:01:54.450> mean<00:01:54.630> there<00:01:54.780> was

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
last year or so because i mean there was

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.109 
last year or so because i mean there was
a<00:01:54.990> while<00:01:55.259> there<00:01:55.560> where<00:01:56.250> they<00:01:56.909> were<00:01:57.000> just

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
a while there where they were just

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.700 
a while there where they were just
mixing<00:01:57.540> like<00:01:57.689> singles<00:01:58.110> partners<00:01:58.500> together

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
mixing like singles partners together

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.260 
mixing like singles partners together
and<00:01:59.100> making<00:01:59.250> them<00:01:59.460> tag<00:01:59.700> teams<00:02:00.000> and<00:02:00.180> there

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
and making them tag teams and there

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.120 
and making them tag teams and there
really<00:02:00.360> wasn't<00:02:00.689> any<00:02:00.990> kind<00:02:01.200> of<00:02:01.320> true<00:02:01.560> tag<00:02:01.829> teams

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130
