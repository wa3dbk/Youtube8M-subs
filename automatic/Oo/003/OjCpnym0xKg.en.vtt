for a band or something like that you
could<00:00:47.100> say<00:00:47.370> you<00:00:47.430> know<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:47.940> dimensions<00:00:48.450> of

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
could say you know the dimensions of

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.990 
could say you know the dimensions of
your<00:00:48.629> flyer<00:00:49.020> you<00:00:49.289> can<00:00:49.379> say<00:00:49.590> well<00:00:49.860> size<00:00:50.430> it's<00:00:50.910> a

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
your flyer you can say well size it's a

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.209 
your flyer you can say well size it's a
letter<00:00:51.210> you<00:00:51.960> know<00:00:52.079> or<00:00:52.320> you<00:00:52.469> go<00:00:52.620> for<00:00:52.860> a<00:00:52.920> screen

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
letter you know or you go for a screen

letter you know or you go for a screen
size<00:00:53.430> or<00:00:53.699> whatever<00:00:53.969> but<00:00:54.210> for<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:54.989> sake<00:00:55.199> this

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
size or whatever but for the sake this

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.220 
size or whatever but for the sake this
by<00:00:55.739> default<00:00:56.100> it's<00:00:56.489> a<00:00:56.640> dis<00:00:57.390> letter<00:00:57.629> size<00:00:57.870> which

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
by default it's a dis letter size which

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.430 
by default it's a dis letter size which
is<00:00:58.379> your<00:00:58.530> standard<00:00:58.829> you<00:00:59.070> know<00:00:59.190> 8<00:00:59.430> 8<00:00:59.789> 8<00:01:00.120> by<00:01:00.989> 11

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
is your standard you know 8 8 8 by 11

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.990 
is your standard you know 8 8 8 by 11
you<00:01:01.890> know<00:01:01.920> you<00:01:02.070> can<00:01:02.219> go<00:01:02.309> in<00:01:02.460> and<00:01:02.609> name<00:01:02.760> your

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
you know you can go in and name your

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.119 
you know you can go in and name your
project<00:01:03.239> will<00:01:03.690> just<00:01:03.809> call<00:01:04.350> this<00:01:04.530> temp<00:01:04.830> and

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
project will just call this temp and

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.740 
project will just call this temp and
then<00:01:05.580> CMYK<00:01:06.510> color<00:01:06.960> RGB<00:01:07.640> CMYK<00:01:08.640> is<00:01:09.240> used<00:01:09.510> for

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
then CMYK color RGB CMYK is used for

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.380 
then CMYK color RGB CMYK is used for
print<00:01:10.049> work<00:01:10.229> printers<00:01:11.010> print<00:01:11.369> and<00:01:11.460> CMYK<00:01:11.880> and

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
print work printers print and CMYK and

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.050 
print work printers print and CMYK and
RGB<00:01:13.140> is<00:01:13.380> more<00:01:13.590> what<00:01:13.740> your<00:01:13.890> monitor<00:01:14.280> displays

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
RGB is more what your monitor displays

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.609 
RGB is more what your monitor displays
so<00:01:15.299> if<00:01:15.450> let's<00:01:16.110> say<00:01:16.170> you're<00:01:16.320> gonna<00:01:16.409> do

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
so if let's say you're gonna do

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.140 
so if let's say you're gonna do
something<00:01:16.650> of<00:01:16.979> illustrator<00:01:17.490> and<00:01:17.729> then<00:01:17.939> move

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
something of illustrator and then move

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.120 
something of illustrator and then move
it<00:01:18.299> into<00:01:18.509> Photoshop<00:01:18.720> you'll<00:01:19.650> probably<00:01:19.860> want

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
it into Photoshop you'll probably want

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.280 
it into Photoshop you'll probably want
to<00:01:20.159> stay<00:01:20.340> with<00:01:20.460> RGB<00:01:20.790> but<00:01:21.180> if<00:01:21.420> you're<00:01:21.630> wanting

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
to stay with RGB but if you're wanting

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.350 
to stay with RGB but if you're wanting
to<00:01:22.530> print<00:01:22.830> whatever<00:01:23.490> you're<00:01:23.790> making<00:01:23.909> here<00:01:24.240> and

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
to print whatever you're making here and

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.719 
to print whatever you're making here and
stick<00:01:24.630> with<00:01:24.780> CMYK<00:01:25.520> so<00:01:26.520> just<00:01:27.509> hit<00:01:27.630> OK<00:01:27.960> and<00:01:28.200> then

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:28.729 
stick with CMYK so just hit OK and then

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:31.340 
stick with CMYK so just hit OK and then
it'll<00:01:29.729> create<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.270> artboard<00:01:31.049> that<00:01:31.259> you're

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
it'll create the artboard that you're

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.030 
it'll create the artboard that you're
gonna<00:01:31.470> work<00:01:31.710> on<00:01:31.920> and<00:01:32.479> really<00:01:33.619> it's<00:01:34.619> hard<00:01:34.860> to

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
gonna work on and really it's hard to

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.770 
gonna work on and really it's hard to
sum<00:01:35.250> up<00:01:35.400> exactly<00:01:35.939> everything<00:01:36.180> illustrator

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
sum up exactly everything illustrator

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.690 
sum up exactly everything illustrator
does<00:01:37.020> in<00:01:37.229> one<00:01:37.409> clip<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:37.950> best<00:01:38.159> thing<00:01:38.310> to<00:01:38.340> do<00:01:38.549> is

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
does in one clip the best thing to do is

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.390 
does in one clip the best thing to do is
to<00:01:38.820> go<00:01:38.970> in<00:01:39.119> and<00:01:39.270> start<00:01:39.450> playing<00:01:39.659> with<00:01:39.990> it<00:01:40.400> again

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
to go in and start playing with it again

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.560 
to go in and start playing with it again
like<00:01:41.579> you<00:01:41.790> can<00:01:41.970> choose<00:01:42.329> from<00:01:42.509> different

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
like you can choose from different

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.969 
like you can choose from different
shapes<00:01:43.170> stars<00:01:44.159> all<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:44.790> stuff<00:01:45.030> square<00:01:45.540> and

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:45.979 
shapes stars all the stuff square and

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:49.490 
shapes stars all the stuff square and
you<00:01:46.979> know<00:01:47.100> just<00:01:47.369> make<00:01:47.610> it<00:01:47.820> and<00:01:48.119> then<00:01:49.049> just<00:01:49.320> get

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
you know just make it and then just get

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.960 
you know just make it and then just get
