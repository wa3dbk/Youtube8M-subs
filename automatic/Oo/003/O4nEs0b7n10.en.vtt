this is beginning level yeah things
they're<00:00:24.660> colorful<00:00:25.140> now<00:00:25.500> they're<00:00:25.830> not<00:00:25.980> just

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160

read<00:00:26.460> I'm<00:00:27.449> in<00:00:27.570> a<00:00:27.599> variety<00:00:27.779> of<00:00:28.820> brighter<00:00:29.820> colors

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:31.369

stuff<00:00:32.510> okay<00:00:36.559> this<00:00:37.559> one<00:00:37.770> actually<00:00:37.920> has

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
stuff okay this one actually has

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.959 
stuff okay this one actually has
probably<00:00:39.059> one<00:00:39.420> of<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.600> easiest<00:00:39.680> patterns<00:00:40.969> the

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
probably one of the easiest patterns the

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.790 
probably one of the easiest patterns the
only<00:00:42.270> weird<00:00:42.510> thing<00:00:42.570> about<00:00:42.750> it<00:00:43.200> is<00:00:43.500> this

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
only weird thing about it is this

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.880 
only weird thing about it is this
pattern<00:00:44.309> I<00:00:45.079> believe<00:00:46.370> makes<00:00:47.370> run<00:00:47.730> out<00:00:47.850> of<00:00:47.879> time

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:48.890 
pattern I believe makes run out of time

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.080 
pattern I believe makes run out of time
