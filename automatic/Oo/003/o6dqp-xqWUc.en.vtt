didn't<00:01:46.479> have<00:01:46.570> a<00:01:46.600> general<00:01:47.020> idea<00:01:47.110> what<00:01:47.649> I<00:01:47.680> wanted

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890 
didn't have a general idea what I wanted

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.840 
didn't have a general idea what I wanted
the<00:01:48.100> shape<00:01:48.280> to<00:01:48.399> look<00:01:48.549> like<00:01:48.759> so<00:01:49.060> i<00:01:49.299> just<00:01:50.850> went

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850 
the shape to look like so i just went

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:54.120 
the shape to look like so i just went
with<00:01:52.060> it<00:01:52.119> until<00:01:52.450> i<00:01:52.630> felt<00:01:52.960> like<00:01:53.259> it<00:01:53.829> was<00:01:53.920> good

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130 
with it until i felt like it was good

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.760 
with it until i felt like it was good
enough<00:01:54.780> which<00:01:55.780> is<00:01:55.930> probably<00:01:56.200> the<00:01:56.350> wrong<00:01:56.560> way

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:56.770 
enough which is probably the wrong way

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.010 
enough which is probably the wrong way
to<00:01:56.829> do<00:01:57.009> it<00:01:57.360> seeing<00:01:58.360> how<00:01:58.450> this<00:01:58.509> is<00:01:58.659> the<00:01:58.780> first

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
to do it seeing how this is the first

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:04.010 
to do it seeing how this is the first
time<00:01:59.170> i<00:01:59.229> made<00:01:59.920> an<00:02:00.039> ornament<00:02:00.600> it's<00:02:01.600> all<00:02:01.780> right
