00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:39.660 
that hasn't helped but what do you make

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:42.950 
that hasn't helped but what do you make
of<00:04:39.720> the<00:04:39.990> start<00:04:40.350> and<00:04:40.940> is<00:04:41.940> something<00:04:42.630> like<00:04:42.750> that

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 
of the start and is something like that

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.990 
of the start and is something like that
have<00:04:43.169> any<00:04:43.440> impact<00:04:43.530> at<00:04:44.039> all<00:04:44.160> on<00:04:44.220> your<00:04:44.400> decision

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:45.000 
have any impact at all on your decision

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.570 
have any impact at all on your decision
oh<00:04:45.300> not<00:04:46.020> really<00:04:46.289> because<00:04:46.560> I<00:04:46.860> know<00:04:46.919> how<00:04:47.190> to<00:04:47.250> how

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:47.580 
oh not really because I know how to how

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:49.310 
oh not really because I know how to how
to<00:04:47.610> SEC<00:04:48.180> goes<00:04:48.389> and<00:04:48.660> you<00:04:48.690> know<00:04:48.810> how<00:04:48.930> college

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:49.320 
to SEC goes and you know how college

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:50.930 
to SEC goes and you know how college
girls<00:04:49.500> period<00:04:49.770> you<00:04:50.220> know<00:04:50.310> some<00:04:50.550> people<00:04:50.580> you

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:50.940
