00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:07.870 
hello everybody it's me QB and in this

hello everybody it's me QB and in this
video<00:00:08.170> I<00:00:08.380> would<00:00:08.620> like<00:00:08.830> to<00:00:09.160> talk<00:00:09.370> about<00:00:10.379> what

00:00:11.369 --> 00:00:11.379 
video I would like to talk about what

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:16.160 
video I would like to talk about what
role<00:00:11.709> genetics<00:00:12.429> play<00:00:12.849> and<00:00:13.650> hair<00:00:14.650> growth<00:00:14.950> I

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
role genetics play and hair growth I

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.669 
role genetics play and hair growth I
have<00:00:17.170> my<00:00:17.830> own<00:00:18.010> personal<00:00:18.850> views<00:00:19.240> on<00:00:19.660> how<00:00:20.349> I

00:00:20.669 --> 00:00:20.679 
have my own personal views on how I

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:25.109 
have my own personal views on how I
perceive<00:00:22.560> genetics<00:00:23.560> in<00:00:23.859> the<00:00:24.279> hair<00:00:24.550> role<00:00:24.789> in

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:25.119 
perceive genetics in the hair role in

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:29.310 
perceive genetics in the hair role in
the<00:00:25.390> hair<00:00:25.630> role<00:00:26.019> in<00:00:26.349> hair<00:00:26.679> growth<00:00:27.009> and<00:00:28.289> what<00:00:29.289> I

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:29.320 
the hair role in hair growth and what I

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.790 
the hair role in hair growth and what I
would<00:00:29.439> say<00:00:29.949> is<00:00:30.220> it<00:00:31.089> can<00:00:31.720> be<00:00:31.960> come<00:00:32.529> very

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:32.800 
would say is it can be come very

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.709 
would say is it can be come very
discouraging<00:00:33.640> when<00:00:34.540> some<00:00:35.200> women<00:00:35.590> think<00:00:35.950> that

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
discouraging when some women think that

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:42.270 
discouraging when some women think that
genetics<00:00:37.719> may<00:00:38.469> be<00:00:38.530> the<00:00:38.920> reason<00:00:39.070> that<00:00:40.949> her<00:00:41.949> hair

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:42.280 
genetics may be the reason that her hair

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.639 
genetics may be the reason that her hair
is<00:00:42.309> not<00:00:42.579> growing<00:00:42.969> and<00:00:43.770> I<00:00:44.770> would<00:00:45.579> like<00:00:45.760> to<00:00:45.789> just

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
is not growing and I would like to just

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.279 
is not growing and I would like to just
kind<00:00:47.649> of<00:00:47.739> again<00:00:48.430> to<00:00:48.640> share<00:00:48.910> my<00:00:49.090> views<00:00:49.510> on<00:00:49.809> how<00:00:50.050> i

160 pounds and that is due to my

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:33.389 
160 pounds and that is due to my
genetics<00:01:28.479> now<00:01:28.689> my<00:01:29.500> mother<00:01:29.740> is<00:01:30.299> a<00:01:31.299> very<00:01:32.250> she<00:01:33.250> has

genetics now my mother is a very she has
a<00:01:33.430> nice<00:01:33.670> body<00:01:33.700> and<00:01:34.560> yes<00:01:36.270> she<00:01:37.270> definitely<00:01:37.570> eats

what she wants and you know we

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.280 
what she wants and you know we
definitely<00:01:40.090> share<00:01:40.540> the<00:01:40.689> same<00:01:40.840> physical

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:41.290 
definitely share the same physical

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:43.830 
definitely share the same physical
traits<00:01:41.590> but<00:01:42.520> what<00:01:42.909> I<00:01:42.939> will<00:01:43.180> also<00:01:43.420> like<00:01:43.810> to

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
traits but what I will also like to

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.410 
traits but what I will also like to
mention<00:01:44.079> which<00:01:44.890> is<00:01:45.189> a<00:01:45.399> very<00:01:45.610> important<00:01:46.210> factor

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 
mention which is a very important factor

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.280 
mention which is a very important factor
when<00:01:46.719> dealing<00:01:47.110> with<00:01:47.229> genetics<00:01:47.890> is<00:01:48.869> it's<00:01:49.869> very

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:50.290 
when dealing with genetics is it's very

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:54.389 
when dealing with genetics is it's very
easy<00:01:50.680> to<00:01:51.310> focus<00:01:51.729> on<00:01:52.530> just<00:01:53.530> the<00:01:53.649> physical<00:01:53.890> part

00:01:54.389 --> 00:01:54.399 
easy to focus on just the physical part

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:59.160 
easy to focus on just the physical part
but<00:01:55.390> no<00:01:56.380> one<00:01:56.590> really<00:01:56.829> talks<00:01:57.460> about<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.990> other

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
but no one really talks about the other

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.469 
but no one really talks about the other
things<00:01:59.770> that<00:01:59.920> I<00:02:00.100> genetically<00:02:00.850> inherited<00:02:01.119> from

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:01.479 
things that I genetically inherited from

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:04.980 
things that I genetically inherited from
my<00:02:01.630> mother<00:02:01.979> I<00:02:02.979> jenever<00:02:03.990> genetically

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
my mother I jenever genetically

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:06.719 
my mother I jenever genetically
inherited<00:02:05.380> the<00:02:05.770> fact<00:02:06.009> that<00:02:06.100> she<00:02:06.340> goes<00:02:06.520> to<00:02:06.700> the

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
that if I didn't go in a gym hard it is

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.709 
that if I didn't go in a gym hard it is
definitely<00:02:51.680> a<00:02:51.919> balance<00:02:52.400> and<00:02:52.639> I<00:02:52.909> love<00:02:53.359> going<00:02:53.569> to

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:53.719 
definitely a balance and I love going to

00:02:53.719 --> 00:02:56.439 
definitely a balance and I love going to
the<00:02:53.900> gym<00:02:54.079> and<00:02:54.379> I<00:02:54.829> can't<00:02:55.129> even<00:02:55.879> imagine<00:02:56.000> not

going<00:02:56.780> to<00:02:56.900> the<00:02:56.989> gym<00:02:57.019> and<00:02:57.409> if<00:02:57.650> I<00:02:57.799> stopped<00:02:58.129> going

00:02:58.149 --> 00:02:58.159 
going to the gym and if I stopped going

00:02:58.159 --> 00:03:01.990 
going to the gym and if I stopped going
to<00:02:58.519> the<00:02:58.669> gym<00:02:59.000> I<00:02:59.209> would<00:02:59.689> not<00:03:00.230> inherit<00:03:01.069> her<00:03:01.609> genes

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
to the gym I would not inherit her genes

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.520 
to the gym I would not inherit her genes
as<00:03:02.329> far<00:03:02.629> as<00:03:03.280> that's<00:03:04.280> concerned<00:03:04.430> so<00:03:05.379> even<00:03:06.379> with

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
as far as that's concerned so even with

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.319 
as far as that's concerned so even with
the<00:03:06.680> hair<00:03:06.949> it's<00:03:07.760> like<00:03:08.260> okay<00:03:09.260> I<00:03:09.469> can

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:10.329 
the hair it's like okay I can

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:13.360 
the hair it's like okay I can
genetically<00:03:11.329> inherit<00:03:11.989> my<00:03:12.139> mother's<00:03:12.439> hair<00:03:12.829> but

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
genetically inherit my mother's hair but

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:15.460 
genetically inherit my mother's hair but
I<00:03:13.400> also<00:03:13.489> genetically<00:03:14.449> inherited<00:03:14.840> the<00:03:15.169> way<00:03:15.290> she

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
I also genetically inherited the way she

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.129 
I also genetically inherited the way she
combs<00:03:15.739> her<00:03:15.949> hair<00:03:16.040> the<00:03:16.819> way<00:03:16.939> she<00:03:17.180> oils<00:03:17.629> her

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:18.139 
combs her hair the way she oils her

00:03:18.139 --> 00:03:20.949 
combs her hair the way she oils her
scalp<00:03:18.560> and<00:03:18.739> oil<00:03:19.040> her<00:03:19.370> hair<00:03:19.729> and<00:03:19.970> all<00:03:20.689> these

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 
scalp and oil her hair and all these

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:23.619 
scalp and oil her hair and all these
other<00:03:21.019> things<00:03:21.470> see<00:03:21.680> no<00:03:21.889> one's<00:03:22.299> talking<00:03:23.299> about

00:03:23.619 --> 00:03:23.629 
other things see no one's talking about

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:26.890 
other things see no one's talking about
that<00:03:23.870> so<00:03:24.259> I<00:03:24.530> know<00:03:25.340> for<00:03:25.639> some<00:03:25.849> women<00:03:26.060> it<00:03:26.449> can<00:03:26.599> get

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
that so I know for some women it can get

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.050 
that so I know for some women it can get
a<00:03:27.079> bit<00:03:27.109> discouraging<00:03:28.009> to<00:03:28.220> think<00:03:28.489> that<00:03:28.729> genes

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
a bit discouraging to think that genes

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.110 
a bit discouraging to think that genes
play<00:03:29.239> a<00:03:29.329> big<00:03:29.569> role<00:03:29.689> but<00:03:30.620> you<00:03:31.430> cannot<00:03:31.759> tell<00:03:32.060> me

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
play a big role but you cannot tell me

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:37.270 
play a big role but you cannot tell me

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280 
if my mother had diabetes and she ate

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.819 
if my mother had diabetes and she ate
like<00:03:37.519> a<00:03:37.549> pig<00:03:37.699> and<00:03:38.239> she<00:03:38.509> was<00:03:38.659> fat<00:03:39.019> and<00:03:39.349> she<00:03:39.650> was

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270 
family then it's going to be more

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:28.119 
family then it's going to be more
difficult<00:04:26.509> because<00:04:26.840> you<00:04:27.259> weren't<00:04:27.560> there

00:04:28.119 --> 00:04:28.129 
difficult because you weren't there

wasn't an example set for you and that's
my<00:04:32.180> stance<00:04:32.689> on<00:04:32.990> genetics<00:04:33.560> and<00:04:33.770> a<00:04:33.830> role<00:04:34.009> at<00:04:34.189> play

another thing I wanted to mention about

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:39.640 
another thing I wanted to mention about
genetics<00:04:37.280> is<00:04:37.460> the<00:04:37.610> fact<00:04:37.849> that<00:04:38.349> when<00:04:39.349> you<00:04:39.439> go<00:04:39.590> to

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:08.960 
very very very small part and just

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:12.070 
very very very small part and just
starting<00:05:09.919> out<00:05:10.009> in<00:05:10.039> my<00:05:10.250> hair<00:05:10.490> journey<00:05:10.759> I<00:05:11.240> had

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:12.080 
starting out in my hair journey I had

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.860 
starting out in my hair journey I had
the<00:05:12.289> liberty<00:05:12.650> of<00:05:13.270> watching<00:05:14.270> this<00:05:14.389> young<00:05:14.599> lady

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:14.870 
the liberty of watching this young lady

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:16.830 
the liberty of watching this young lady
and<00:05:15.110> I<00:05:15.229> will<00:05:15.409> put<00:05:15.560> her<00:05:15.740> link<00:05:15.919> in<00:05:16.129> the<00:05:16.190> infobox

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:16.840 
and I will put her link in the infobox

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:20.950 
and I will put her link in the infobox
but<00:05:17.840> her<00:05:18.500> hair<00:05:18.830> grows<00:05:19.129> an<00:05:19.430> inch<00:05:19.490> every<00:05:20.300> three

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:20.960 
but her hair grows an inch every three

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:24.659 
but her hair grows an inch every three
months<00:05:21.409> and<00:05:21.610> her<00:05:22.610> hair<00:05:22.969> is<00:05:23.180> down<00:05:23.479> to<00:05:23.750> her<00:05:23.900> butt

00:05:24.659 --> 00:05:24.669 
months and her hair is down to her butt

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:28.390 
months and her hair is down to her butt
so<00:05:25.669> I<00:05:26.090> know<00:05:26.479> some<00:05:27.139> women<00:05:27.289> hair<00:05:27.710> are<00:05:27.979> growing

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:28.400 
so I know some women hair are growing

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:31.300 
so I know some women hair are growing
every<00:05:29.020> more<00:05:30.020> than<00:05:30.289> an<00:05:30.440> inch<00:05:30.680> every<00:05:30.949> three

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:31.310 
every more than an inch every three

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:34.689 
every more than an inch every three
months<00:05:31.699> so<00:05:32.419> she<00:05:32.479> can<00:05:33.110> do<00:05:33.259> it<00:05:33.469> I<00:05:33.650> can<00:05:33.949> do<00:05:34.340> it<00:05:34.370> and

00:05:34.689 --> 00:05:34.699 
months so she can do it I can do it and

00:05:34.699 --> 00:05:36.580 
months so she can do it I can do it and
I'm<00:05:34.849> on<00:05:35.029> my<00:05:35.060> way<00:05:35.180> there<00:05:35.599> and<00:05:35.840> if<00:05:35.990> I<00:05:36.169> can<00:05:36.409> do<00:05:36.560> it

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:36.590 
I'm on my way there and if I can do it

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:39.969 
I'm on my way there and if I can do it
you<00:05:36.860> can<00:05:36.889> do<00:05:37.219> it<00:05:37.250> and<00:05:37.810> when<00:05:38.810> i<00:05:38.870> saw<00:05:39.289> when<00:05:39.919> i

00:05:39.969 --> 00:05:39.979 
you can do it and when i saw when i

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:41.890 
you can do it and when i saw when i
started<00:05:40.339> my<00:05:40.460> hair<00:05:40.639> journey<00:05:40.849> and<00:05:41.210> i<00:05:41.360> saw<00:05:41.690> this

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:41.900 
started my hair journey and i saw this

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:45.430 
started my hair journey and i saw this
lady<00:05:42.110> i<00:05:42.469> did<00:05:43.099> not<00:05:43.279> have<00:05:43.490> to<00:05:43.699> question<00:05:44.440> her

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:45.440 
lady i did not have to question her

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:49.180 
lady i did not have to question her
genetics<00:05:46.039> I<00:05:46.250> didn't<00:05:46.699> care<00:05:46.969> if<00:05:47.270> she<00:05:48.020> had<00:05:48.889> always

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:49.190 
genetics I didn't care if she had always

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:52.959 
genetics I didn't care if she had always
had<00:05:49.490> long<00:05:49.759> hair<00:05:50.060> all<00:05:50.389> I<00:05:50.449> know<00:05:51.050> is<00:05:51.560> she<00:05:52.129> had<00:05:52.400> it

00:05:52.959 --> 00:05:52.969 
had long hair all I know is she had it

00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:57.279 
had long hair all I know is she had it
and<00:05:53.180> what<00:05:53.449> she<00:05:53.750> said<00:05:54.139> made<00:05:54.830> sense<00:05:56.080> period<00:05:57.080> I

00:05:57.279 --> 00:05:57.289 
and what she said made sense period I

00:05:57.289 --> 00:05:59.980 
and what she said made sense period I
didn't<00:05:58.039> question<00:05:58.580> if<00:05:58.849> her<00:05:59.029> hair<00:05:59.270> type<00:05:59.539> was<00:05:59.719> 4a

00:05:59.980 --> 00:05:59.990 
didn't question if her hair type was 4a

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:03.279 
didn't question if her hair type was 4a
4b<00:06:00.589> or<00:06:00.740> foresee<00:06:01.339> I<00:06:01.610> didn't<00:06:02.449> question<00:06:03.050> whether

00:06:03.279 --> 00:06:03.289 
4b or foresee I didn't question whether

00:06:03.289 --> 00:06:06.519 
4b or foresee I didn't question whether
she<00:06:03.680> was<00:06:03.830> mixed<00:06:04.460> or<00:06:04.819> this<00:06:05.270> all<00:06:05.719> I<00:06:05.779> know<00:06:06.020> is<00:06:06.169> she

00:06:06.519 --> 00:06:06.529 
she was mixed or this all I know is she

00:06:06.529 --> 00:06:09.010 
she was mixed or this all I know is she
looks<00:06:06.800> something<00:06:07.250> like<00:06:07.460> me<00:06:07.940> her<00:06:08.449> hair<00:06:08.750> looks

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:09.020 
looks something like me her hair looks

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:11.230 
looks something like me her hair looks
something<00:06:09.199> like<00:06:09.319> me<00:06:09.650> and<00:06:09.860> hers<00:06:10.520> was<00:06:10.789> long<00:06:11.029> and

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:11.240 
something like me and hers was long and

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:14.920 
something like me and hers was long and
mines<00:06:11.569> wasn't<00:06:12.080> and<00:06:12.229> I<00:06:13.039> that's<00:06:13.580> all<00:06:13.879> I<00:06:14.150> ran<00:06:14.690> with

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:14.930 
mines wasn't and I that's all I ran with

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:19.329 
mines wasn't and I that's all I ran with
I<00:06:15.169> didn't<00:06:16.039> question<00:06:16.940> her<00:06:17.659> genetics<00:06:18.319> heard<00:06:18.979> the

00:06:19.329 --> 00:06:19.339 
I didn't question her genetics heard the

00:06:19.339 --> 00:06:22.390 
I didn't question her genetics heard the
lack<00:06:19.550> of<00:06:19.789> their<00:06:20.089> of<00:06:20.270> it<00:06:20.539> was<00:06:21.050> just<00:06:21.349> she<00:06:22.009> did<00:06:22.279> it

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:22.400 
lack of their of it was just she did it

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:26.309 
lack of their of it was just she did it
and<00:06:22.580> I<00:06:22.969> can<00:06:23.210> do<00:06:23.330> it<00:06:23.360> and<00:06:23.659> you<00:06:23.990> can<00:06:24.229> do<00:06:24.379> it<00:06:24.560> and

00:06:26.309 --> 00:06:26.319 
and I can do it and you can do it and

00:06:26.319 --> 00:06:29.529 
and I can do it and you can do it and
genetics<00:06:27.319> the<00:06:28.159> whole<00:06:28.339> aspect<00:06:28.940> with<00:06:29.089> terminal

have someone in your family that has

00:06:35.989 --> 00:06:38.289 
have someone in your family that has
reached<00:06:36.289> their<00:06:36.619> terminal<00:06:37.129> length<00:06:37.339> then<00:06:37.999> you

00:06:38.289 --> 00:06:38.299 
reached their terminal length then you

00:06:38.299 --> 00:06:41.079 
reached their terminal length then you
know<00:06:38.539> your<00:06:38.749> terminal<00:06:39.199> length<00:06:39.429> but<00:06:40.429> a<00:06:40.579> lot<00:06:41.059> of

what is the full potential of your
