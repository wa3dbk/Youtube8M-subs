allows for that dynamic all the time and
the<00:00:55.800> only<00:00:55.920> way<00:00:56.100> I've<00:00:56.280> found<00:00:56.579> to<00:00:57.000> do<00:00:57.180> that<00:00:57.390> as<00:00:57.960> a

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
the only way I've found to do that as a

and<00:01:37.049> we<00:01:37.259> noticed<00:01:37.619> that<00:01:37.680> this<00:01:37.860> behavior<00:01:38.070> was

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
and we noticed that this behavior was

to address topics and be able to collate

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.480 
to address topics and be able to collate
them<00:01:45.030> into<00:01:45.360> into<00:01:45.720> one<00:01:45.750> stream<00:01:46.170> or<00:01:47.100> rebroadcast

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
them into into one stream or rebroadcast

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.030 
them into into one stream or rebroadcast
and<00:01:48.090> we<00:01:48.180> just<00:01:48.360> made<00:01:48.540> it<00:01:48.689> a<00:01:48.960> little<00:01:49.530> bit<00:01:49.710> easier

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
and we just made it a little bit easier

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.520 
and we just made it a little bit easier
we<00:01:50.220> built<00:01:50.430> into<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:50.880> technology<00:01:51.240> so<00:01:51.750> we've

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
we built into the technology so we've

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.340 
we built into the technology so we've
taken<00:01:52.829> a<00:01:53.100> lot<00:01:53.280> from<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:54.600> community<00:01:55.049> that's

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
taken a lot from the community that's

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.020 
taken a lot from the community that's
that's<00:01:55.799> actually<00:01:56.130> building<00:01:56.490> this<00:01:56.640> this

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
that's actually building this this

of vision you had in terms of your play

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:46.920 
of vision you had in terms of your play
using<00:03:44.560> Square<00:03:45.010> to<00:03:45.160> replace<00:03:45.519> cash<00:03:45.880> what<00:03:46.750> kind

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930 
using Square to replace cash what kind

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:49.199 
using Square to replace cash what kind
of<00:03:46.959> value<00:03:47.320> does<00:03:47.470> it<00:03:47.590> had<00:03:47.739> in<00:03:47.920> terms<00:03:48.130> of<00:03:48.280> having

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.209 
of value does it had in terms of having

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:50.640 
of value does it had in terms of having
real<00:03:49.359> cash<00:03:49.630> you<00:03:49.870> have<00:03:49.900> privacy<00:03:50.440> of

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
real cash you have privacy of

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:52.800 
real cash you have privacy of
transaction<00:03:51.310> you<00:03:51.549> have<00:03:51.579> the<00:03:52.090> value<00:03:52.690> of

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
transaction you have the value of

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:54.810 
transaction you have the value of
physical<00:03:52.959> physically<00:03:53.950> holding<00:03:54.250> money<00:03:54.459> how<00:03:54.760> do

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:54.820 
physical physically holding money how do

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:57.539 
physical physically holding money how do
you<00:03:55.030> plan<00:03:55.870> to<00:03:55.900> replace<00:03:56.380> that<00:03:56.560> square<00:03:57.010> I<00:03:57.130> think

00:03:57.539 --> 00:03:57.549 
you plan to replace that square I think

00:03:57.549 --> 00:03:58.770 
you plan to replace that square I think
there's<00:03:57.730> a<00:03:57.790> lot<00:03:57.970> of<00:03:58.000> conversation<00:03:58.690> about

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:58.780 
there's a lot of conversation about

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:00.900 
there's a lot of conversation about
replacing<00:03:59.380> cash<00:03:59.590> but<00:03:59.920> one<00:04:00.400> of<00:04:00.430> the<00:04:00.579> things<00:04:00.730> we

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:00.910 
replacing cash but one of the things we

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:03.000 
replacing cash but one of the things we
realized<00:04:01.120> early<00:04:01.420> on<00:04:01.569> is<00:04:01.870> we<00:04:02.079> want<00:04:02.590> merchants

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.010 
realized early on is we want merchants

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:04.680 
realized early on is we want merchants
to<00:04:03.100> be<00:04:03.190> able<00:04:03.280> to<00:04:03.400> accept<00:04:03.700> any<00:04:04.030> form<00:04:04.390> of<00:04:04.510> payment

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:04.690 
to be able to accept any form of payment

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:07.020 
to be able to accept any form of payment
that<00:04:04.989> comes<00:04:05.230> over<00:04:05.470> the<00:04:05.530> counter<00:04:05.799> so<00:04:06.579> if<00:04:06.850> it's

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 
that comes over the counter so if it's

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:09.199 
that comes over the counter so if it's
cash<00:04:07.299> if<00:04:07.569> it's<00:04:07.720> check<00:04:08.049> if<00:04:08.260> it's<00:04:08.440> card<00:04:08.769> if<00:04:09.010> it's

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:09.209 
cash if it's check if it's card if it's

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:11.099 
cash if it's check if it's card if it's
something<00:04:10.209> new<00:04:10.359> we're<00:04:10.600> not<00:04:10.720> talking<00:04:11.079> about

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:11.109 
something new we're not talking about

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:14.069 
something new we're not talking about
right<00:04:11.410> now<00:04:12.060> then<00:04:13.060> great<00:04:13.359> that<00:04:13.750> means<00:04:13.930> they

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:14.079 
right now then great that means they

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:16.319 
right now then great that means they
always<00:04:14.350> make<00:04:14.530> the<00:04:14.650> sale<00:04:14.859> and<00:04:15.819> that<00:04:16.000> means<00:04:16.209> the

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:16.329 
always make the sale and that means the

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:17.849 
always make the sale and that means the
buyer<00:04:16.479> always<00:04:16.750> gets<00:04:16.959> what<00:04:17.169> they<00:04:17.229> want<00:04:17.350> so<00:04:17.709> that

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:17.859 
buyer always gets what they want so that

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:20.370 
buyer always gets what they want so that
increases<00:04:18.220> commerce<00:04:18.669> so<00:04:18.970> fundamentally<00:04:19.900> the

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:20.380 
increases commerce so fundamentally the

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:21.719 
increases commerce so fundamentally the
merchant<00:04:20.680> doesn't<00:04:20.829> care<00:04:21.070> what<00:04:21.220> device<00:04:21.459> it<00:04:21.640> is

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:21.729 
merchant doesn't care what device it is

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:24.810 
merchant doesn't care what device it is
it's<00:04:22.720> just<00:04:23.110> they<00:04:23.770> make<00:04:23.800> a<00:04:23.979> sale<00:04:24.250> right<00:04:24.430> and

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
it's just they make a sale right and

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:27.190 
it's just they make a sale right and
then<00:04:25.300> we<00:04:25.510> have<00:04:25.690> all<00:04:26.020> this<00:04:26.169> data<00:04:26.229> to<00:04:26.710> to

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:27.200 
then we have all this data to to

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:28.480 
then we have all this data to to
share<00:04:27.320> back<00:04:27.530> with<00:04:27.710> them<00:04:27.830> about<00:04:28.070> how<00:04:28.250> to<00:04:28.280> build

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:28.490 
share back with them about how to build

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:31.570 
share back with them about how to build
their<00:04:28.670> business<00:04:28.700> right<00:04:29.360> so<00:04:29.860> that's<00:04:30.860> first<00:04:31.370> and

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:31.580 
their business right so that's first and

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:33.310 
their business right so that's first and
foremost<00:04:31.970> is<00:04:32.120> we<00:04:32.150> don't<00:04:32.510> necessarily<00:04:32.690> have<00:04:33.140> to

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:33.320 
foremost is we don't necessarily have to

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:36.190 
foremost is we don't necessarily have to
to<00:04:34.040> kill<00:04:34.250> cash<00:04:34.460> or<00:04:34.700> replace<00:04:34.970> cash<00:04:35.210> it's<00:04:35.480> it's

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:36.200 
to kill cash or replace cash it's it's

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:38.530 
to kill cash or replace cash it's it's
it's<00:04:36.590> a<00:04:36.680> perfectly<00:04:37.130> fine<00:04:37.310> vehicle<00:04:37.550> for<00:04:38.390> the

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:38.540 
it's a perfectly fine vehicle for the

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:40.750 
it's a perfectly fine vehicle for the
points<00:04:38.870> that<00:04:38.990> you<00:04:39.110> mentioned<00:04:39.610> the<00:04:40.610> reason

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:40.760 
points that you mentioned the reason

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:43.450 
points that you mentioned the reason
cash<00:04:41.180> still<00:04:41.510> exists<00:04:41.900> to<00:04:41.990> my<00:04:42.140> mind<00:04:42.380> is<00:04:42.620> because

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:43.460 
cash still exists to my mind is because

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:45.730 
cash still exists to my mind is because
there<00:04:44.180> can<00:04:44.360> be<00:04:44.510> anonymous<00:04:44.690> transactions<00:04:45.560> and

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:45.740 
there can be anonymous transactions and

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:48.040 
there can be anonymous transactions and
I<00:04:45.800> think<00:04:46.040> being<00:04:46.670> anonymous<00:04:47.180> is<00:04:47.480> an<00:04:47.630> important

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.050 
I think being anonymous is an important

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:51.130 
I think being anonymous is an important
part<00:04:48.260> of<00:04:48.410> democracy<00:04:49.340> I<00:04:49.940> think<00:04:50.510> it's<00:04:50.630> a<00:04:50.780> it's<00:04:51.050> a

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:51.140 
part of democracy I think it's a it's a

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:54.790 
part of democracy I think it's a it's a
critical<00:04:51.500> part<00:04:51.710> of<00:04:51.830> a<00:04:52.130> democracy<00:04:52.960> and<00:04:53.960> I<00:04:54.620> don't

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:54.800 
critical part of a democracy and I don't

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.680 
critical part of a democracy and I don't
think<00:04:55.010> that'll<00:04:55.220> go<00:04:55.340> away<00:04:55.480> but<00:04:56.480> the<00:04:56.570> other

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:56.690 
think that'll go away but the other

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:59.440 
think that'll go away but the other
thing<00:04:56.870> about<00:04:56.930> cash<00:04:57.290> is<00:04:57.560> it's<00:04:57.770> free<00:04:58.300> it's<00:04:59.300> free

00:04:59.440 --> 00:04:59.450 
thing about cash is it's free it's free

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:02.320 
thing about cash is it's free it's free
to<00:04:59.570> exchange<00:04:59.780> and<00:05:00.740> and<00:05:01.370> one<00:05:02.030> of<00:05:02.120> the<00:05:02.180> most

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:02.330 
to exchange and and one of the most

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:03.790 
to exchange and and one of the most
interesting<00:05:02.570> things<00:05:02.720> about<00:05:03.020> what<00:05:03.140> we<00:05:03.350> do<00:05:03.500> and

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:03.800 
interesting things about what we do and

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.190 
interesting things about what we do and
and<00:05:04.190> what<00:05:05.090> I'm<00:05:05.240> really<00:05:05.540> excited<00:05:05.690> about<00:05:05.930> with

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:06.200 
and what I'm really excited about with

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:09.010 
and what I'm really excited about with
both<00:05:06.440> Twitter<00:05:07.220> and<00:05:07.460> square<00:05:07.700> is<00:05:08.030> the<00:05:08.750> really

both Twitter and square is the really

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:10.360 
both Twitter and square is the really
fundamental<00:05:09.260> problems<00:05:09.920> one<00:05:10.220> is

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:10.370 
fundamental problems one is

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:12.760 
fundamental problems one is
communication<00:05:10.790> and<00:05:11.270> one<00:05:11.930> is<00:05:12.080> commerce<00:05:12.470> and

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:18.530 
sellers and it turns out if you really

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:19.390 
sellers and it turns out if you really
look<00:05:18.830> into<00:05:18.950> it

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:19.400 
look into it

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.840 
look into it
we<00:05:20.060> were<00:05:20.210> trading<00:05:20.590> things<00:05:21.640> buying<00:05:22.640> and

we were trading things buying and

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:25.450 
we were trading things buying and
selling<00:05:23.000> before<00:05:23.900> we<00:05:24.320> were<00:05:24.440> using<00:05:24.470> language<00:05:25.130> to
