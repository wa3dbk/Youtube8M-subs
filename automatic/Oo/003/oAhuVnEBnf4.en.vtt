00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
to draw this design with only straight

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:29.330 
to draw this design with only straight
lines<00:00:23.220> and<00:00:24.680> it<00:00:25.680> looks<00:00:25.920> pretty<00:00:26.369> cool<00:00:28.099> so<00:00:29.099> on

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
lines and it looks pretty cool so on

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.970 
lines and it looks pretty cool so on
anyways<00:00:30.179> to<00:00:30.420> get<00:00:30.570> to<00:00:30.720> this<00:00:30.900> this<00:00:31.199> is<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:31.560> final

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
is just pretty much a raindrop made out

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:47.119 
is just pretty much a raindrop made out
of<00:00:42.239> straight<00:00:42.540> line<00:00:42.780> and<00:00:44.450> um<00:00:45.739> how<00:00:46.739> you<00:00:46.800> make

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
of straight line and um how you make

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:52.790 
of straight line and um how you make
this<00:00:47.370> is<00:00:48.500> just<00:00:49.500> let<00:00:49.649> me<00:00:49.770> get<00:00:49.980> my<00:00:50.420> ruler<00:00:51.739> for<00:00:52.739> a

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
this is just let me get my ruler for a

00:00:52.800 --> 00:01:01.280 
this is just let me get my ruler for a
second

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:01.290 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:08.250

okay um to get this you need I think

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:19.060 
okay um to get this you need I think
it's<00:01:15.380> protractor<00:01:16.070> i'm<00:01:16.220> not<00:01:16.370> sure<00:01:16.610> but<00:01:18.070> on

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070 
it's protractor i'm not sure but on

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.240 
it's protractor i'm not sure but on
anyways<00:01:19.910> it's<00:01:20.630> like<00:01:20.840> a<00:01:20.870> circle<00:01:21.500> ruler<00:01:21.979> you

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:22.250 
anyways it's like a circle ruler you

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:23.890 
anyways it's like a circle ruler you
know<00:01:22.370> it<00:01:22.520> measures<00:01:22.850> the<00:01:22.880> degrees<00:01:23.450> i'm<00:01:23.720> not

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:23.900 
know it measures the degrees i'm not

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.660 
know it measures the degrees i'm not
sure<00:01:24.050> what<00:01:24.140> it's<00:01:24.320> called<00:01:24.530> when<00:01:25.280> i<00:01:25.340> was<00:01:25.550> you

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
sure what it's called when i was you

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.310 
sure what it's called when i was you
need<00:01:25.850> to<00:01:26.000> make<00:01:26.150> a<00:01:26.180> full<00:01:26.479> circle<00:01:26.930> out<00:01:27.080> of<00:01:27.200> that

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 
need to make a full circle out of that

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:32.100 
need to make a full circle out of that
and<00:01:27.530> market<00:01:27.920> every<00:01:28.420> five<00:01:29.420> degrees<00:01:30.460> my<00:01:31.460> guided

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:32.110 
and market every five degrees my guided

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:39.249 
and market every five degrees my guided
and<00:01:33.670> what<00:01:34.670> you<00:01:34.760> do<00:01:34.970> is<00:01:35.000> um<00:01:36.400> um<00:01:38.020> for<00:01:39.020> the<00:01:39.110> first

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:39.259 
and what you do is um um for the first

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:42.190 
and what you do is um um for the first
time<00:01:39.530> i<00:01:39.590> would<00:01:39.860> suggest<00:01:40.070> doing<00:01:40.430> this<00:01:40.930> you<00:01:41.930> mark

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
time i would suggest doing this you mark

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.469 
time i would suggest doing this you mark
it<00:01:42.440> the<00:01:42.890> first<00:01:43.190> one<00:01:43.490> is<00:01:43.520> right<00:01:43.910> here<00:01:44.240> and<00:01:44.450> you

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 
it the first one is right here and you

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:50.650 
it the first one is right here and you
keep<00:01:45.110> on<00:01:45.350> doing<00:01:46.899> ABCD<00:01:47.899> and<00:01:48.369> so<00:01:49.369> on<00:01:49.580> until<00:01:49.820> you

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:50.660 
keep on doing ABCD and so on until you

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:56.050 
keep on doing ABCD and so on until you
should<00:01:50.869> get<00:01:51.110> X<00:01:52.570> right<00:01:53.570> there<00:01:54.700> you<00:01:55.700> keep<00:01:55.940> on

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
should get X right there you keep on

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.270 
should get X right there you keep on
going<00:01:56.360> until<00:01:56.450> you<00:01:56.660> get<00:01:56.960> X<00:01:57.259> and<00:01:57.710> then<00:01:57.800> you<00:01:57.979> stop

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
going until you get X and then you stop

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:04.120 
going until you get X and then you stop
and<00:01:58.550> then<00:01:59.180> you<00:01:59.330> start<00:01:59.660> again<00:01:59.780> a<00:02:00.910> b<00:02:01.910> c<00:02:02.450> and<00:02:03.289> then

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
and then you start again a b c and then

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.029 
and then you start again a b c and then
you<00:02:04.700> should<00:02:04.970> stop<00:02:05.509> right<00:02:05.990> there<00:02:06.289> at<00:02:06.470> X<00:02:06.710> again

00:02:07.029 --> 00:02:07.039 
you should stop right there at X again

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:08.770 
you should stop right there at X again
and<00:02:07.310> do<00:02:07.759> the<00:02:07.850> same<00:02:08.030> thing<00:02:08.330> and<00:02:08.479> you<00:02:08.600> should

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
and do the same thing and you should

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.729 
and do the same thing and you should
stop<00:02:09.110> like<00:02:09.380> right<00:02:09.709> there<00:02:10.100> right<00:02:10.700> there<00:02:11.030> at<00:02:11.180> X

00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:11.739 
stop like right there right there at X

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:16.600 
stop like right there right there at X
and<00:02:12.739> so<00:02:13.070> um<00:02:13.540> how<00:02:14.540> you<00:02:14.600> do<00:02:14.900> it<00:02:15.080> is<00:02:15.320> this<00:02:16.190> is<00:02:16.430> the

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
and so um how you do it is this is the

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.390 
and so um how you do it is this is the
first<00:02:16.940> a<00:02:17.299> you<00:02:17.989> connect<00:02:18.320> the<00:02:18.470> first<00:02:18.769> a<00:02:19.010> to<00:02:19.070> the

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
first a you connect the first a to the

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.650 
first a you connect the first a to the
second<00:02:19.970> day<00:02:20.200> which<00:02:21.200> is<00:02:21.380> right<00:02:21.620> there<00:02:21.650> and<00:02:22.660> then

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
second day which is right there and then

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.780 
second day which is right there and then
you<00:02:23.780> draw<00:02:23.989> that<00:02:24.019> straight<00:02:24.530> line<00:02:24.769> then<00:02:25.070> you

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
you draw that straight line then you

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
you draw that straight line then you
move<00:02:26.000> to<00:02:26.030> the<00:02:26.360> B<00:02:26.540> and<00:02:26.900> that<00:02:27.530> be<00:02:27.799> and<00:02:28.420> so<00:02:29.420> on<00:02:29.660> and

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
move to the B and that be and so on and

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.630 
move to the B and that be and so on and
so<00:02:29.930> on<00:02:30.019> and<00:02:30.380> you<00:02:30.830> keep<00:02:31.040> on<00:02:31.190> going<00:02:31.549> until

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
so on and you keep on going until

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.130 
so on and you keep on going until
eventually<00:02:31.910> you<00:02:32.570> have<00:02:32.600> that<00:02:33.549> so<00:02:34.549> um<00:02:35.090> once<00:02:35.989> you

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
eventually you have that so um once you

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.060 
eventually you have that so um once you
don't<00:02:36.380> that<00:02:36.620> you<00:02:36.829> should<00:02:37.040> have<00:02:37.070> the<00:02:37.790> rain<00:02:38.090> drop

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.070 
don't that you should have the rain drop

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:41.949 
don't that you should have the rain drop
so<00:02:40.070> um<00:02:40.280> that's<00:02:40.610> it<00:02:40.880> for<00:02:41.060> this<00:02:41.150> video<00:02:41.390> I<00:02:41.570> am

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
so um that's it for this video I am
