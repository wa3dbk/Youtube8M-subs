00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.920
 so so guys on a dresser rolling on 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:08.280
 city bytovuhi decided to write it 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:11.490
 video because this morning I have to 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.710
 there was also a 14- year-old mother but damn 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.560
 The hub of the car I presented this 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:19.800
 unexpected let's say not pleasant 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:22.580
 a gift so now I will tell about him 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.840
 then look all the problem 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.519
 yesterday i arrived everything is ok car 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.560
 put everything was okay today 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.990
 I build and I walked and started Amma swore 2 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.610
 there are three minutes well, if I drove meters 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.190
 the action I went all gone out she 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.050
 just went out stalled and what I start looking for 3 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.870
 the generator is spinning all right, but 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.910
 such that there is no fuel damn I'm going 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.160
 look well, not just no fuel means 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.700
 logically that logically that fuel 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.340
 system 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.910
 come on filter started watching 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.160
 filter 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.870
 I will crank the fuel hoses stupidly does not arrive 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.390
 filter he all opz total just general 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.100
 well, you understand 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:01:00.660
 damn well then what thoughts at night pump 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:02.730
 a pump but there are two of them two pumps 1 which 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.530
 standing on the crankshaft there but the main one 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.510
 the pump is big there on the 12th first 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.880
 how well who shakes which 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.159
 shakes straight normally and the second there are tanks 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.020
 and in bat such a small motor 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.299
 which kind of boosts to help 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.720
 main motor and it's about 4 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:21.180
 ampere damn well I was thinking how to check 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.520
 I think how to check went to read no 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.200
 specifically scored this problem is smart 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.140
 people suggested a solution means look 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.869
 and they said what 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.460
 you try to pour it with me 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.530
 was know how much somewhere less 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.829
 try quarters of bokkanegra when Khan 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.540
 Well, almost full tank, that is, and if that 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.009
 there is an edge full tank pressure is poured 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.229
 created more respectively before 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.180
 until the main pump reaches him enough 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.940
 that in principle to drive him further yes by 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.890
 fuel system if 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:53.440
 Well, if it is not a motor that 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.659
 not a pump which batin means then 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.610
 something else was just the solution itself 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:59.409
 the simplest option, that is, how 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:02.380
 would poison is absolutely nothing at all 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:03.880
 lost cottage went flooded bought there on here 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.610
 because I quickly took another car 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:08.800
 went to refuel flooded so what 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.690
 I will help here therefore I am again an hour on my 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.950
 the scene of the car here I am going on that is 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.680
 now only i need to follow 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.390
 fuel level so that it does not fall 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.370
 below deck the same pressure card will also 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.319
 surrender to not enough let's say well 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.060
 This is a temporary solution to this problem. 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:24.580
 the solution is temporary but damn 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:27.250
 while there is no special money to repair it 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.780
 so for now I’ll ride 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.120
 repair will be due to the juice cost in 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:35.500
 first in my city ​​nobody wants 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:37.269
 take as well as someone wants but I say 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.890
 so do not want to contact them to such 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:40.540
 people such offices are just scary even 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.940
 go in there and the rest are normal 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.500
 services well, like normal blue they are 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.269
 they are not engaged in diesel engines already and how 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.620
 changed abnormal they are ready gasoline q 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:49.030
 that there may be, we think you are a 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.590
 diesel is not mind you 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.750
 here it is really very me 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.940
 upset today therefore because i 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:57.100
 I think if all this does not help me then I 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.630
 no longer knew where to think and mistakes 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.280
 this is the main thing on the computer there is no 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:03.100
 nothing there everything is tested everything in 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:06.190
 okay , well, everything is there and the car is stupid 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:07.360
 No , well, then you understand yes what is 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.670
 the essence of the problems that is the machine is not 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.250
 started up 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:14.680
 It turned out to be a broken motor and worth it 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:16.959
 you know how much it costs a hundred stop sidorov 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.340
 $ 150 worth and change I probably 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:20.170
 I will be myself because there is nothing complicated 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.480
 no yes and go then we have a lot 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:25.060
 there is no account but that's why I will not change 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.920
 here itself but as useful to you again 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.440
 is such useful information so that 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.329
 there was a solution let's say so if what if 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.950
 What if God forbid 

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:35.530
 all life can happen me too 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:37.360
 I thought that this would be like my best not 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:39.940
 happen here is the problem really 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:42.040
 so frequent very many write it on 4 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.750
 del will sign and so on there and therefore 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:47.480
 this is a problem it is present and 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:50.820
 check check it out that is 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:53.760
 check it for a decision yes that is, you can 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:56.340
 that's just such a way that's mean full 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.990
 i will be recording tomorrow so wait 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.850
 don't switch everything everyone thanks for 

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:03.230
 attention all I wanted said everything 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:03.230
 ran further bye
