00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.389
 Hi, I'm the Latvian style director. 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.609
 from west of brazil 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.680
 westwick people create content that makes 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.080
 part of people's lives is not because 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.349
 real people want home 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.660
 true so it 's strange present 

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:18.330
 winter notebook tastes where the 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.580
 people brings three delicious situations 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.859
 to his name Luciana 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.260
 training is a cook and has also been 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.470
 head of uff restaurants is the is bad 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.119
 that do not work together and 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:32.640
 recipes since I knew mark and 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.670
 I find the amazing product they sell and 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.079
 I did not develop that much for 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.780
 this moment in winter 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.820
 now that inspires me the main is the 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.180
 fire some dish in the fireplace or in the 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.550
 BBQ a breath of fresh air at night 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.920
 Soup people get a proposal 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:53.280
 completely trivial a table with 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.680
 rustic ceramics with a bit of copper 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:59.250
 where the mood is super relaxed 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.620
 and at the same time pretty authentic one 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.510
 recipe I thought was a soup of 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.390
 Pumpkin which is a classic soup 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.490
 traditional italian my personal touch is 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.110
 in this dish a spoonful but carbone 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.540
 to give speed and think himself 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:16.740
 looks more beautiful 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:19.770
 the psi folder people are inter new 'bringing 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.140
 pizza in the daytime and on the 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:25.200
 it was a recipe that you find interesting 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.430
 was to make a linguine a dry mass of 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.160
 south of italy 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:32.520

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:35.700
 there pro delay i know prawns peas 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:40.320
 Fresh oregano are simple ingredients 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:43.229
 good and this tasty round the fireplace 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.990
 brings a proposal closer to a table 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:48.990
 more bars a reception on the floor a 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.869
 Creative idea but out of the box 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:55.050
 more original imagine a lovely bread to see it 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:58.590
 grow in the field and do I brusquetas 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:01.020
 I really like the staff and possible onion. 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:04.560
 analyze it with butter goat cheese 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.990
 and asparagus and raw elisson and only the software 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:10.320
 With butter I can not get anything then you. 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:12.870
 preserve all the flavor because winter 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:16.320
 because in winter it is better to receive 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:19.140
 for turning our house into a refuge and 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:21.180
 unprecedented proposals to receive our 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:25.650
 friends our family our people 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:29.930
