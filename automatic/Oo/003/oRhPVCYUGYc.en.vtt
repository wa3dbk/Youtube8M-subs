 Because you can pass the fighting ability enough, it is the deepest conquest badge hero skill 

00:04:31.249 --> 00:04:41.419
 If it is a single activation, it is said that the combat power of the station team is reduced by 55% only in round 2 

00:04:38.869 --> 00:04:43.139
 It does not matter of course even Potala 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:46.349

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:23.000
 so 

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:27.380
 Yesterday you will attack with the guard and damage mitigation disabled. 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:31.430
 This looks similar to the above is yes surprise when they attack 

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:36.320
 It's a blue general, it's a locked-on enemy 8 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:36.660
