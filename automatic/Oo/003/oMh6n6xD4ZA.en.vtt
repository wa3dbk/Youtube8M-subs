00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:08.069
 today we will deal with you investor 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.080
 repair and investor general approach to 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.630
 the division of apartments in the studio base 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.450
 principle in real estate investing 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.230
 especially in small cheap segments 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.990
 and not only 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.460
 this division of big on little let's 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.580
 Let us analyze an example let's say you bought 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.800
 apartment odnushku there 36 meters 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.410
 that's how the object we are going to 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.929
 in the suburbs about 20 kilometers from 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:34.500
 screams if you pass it there just as 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.309
 there is then it can be set for 22 23 thousand 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.170
 rubles approximately 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.840
 and imagine that we assume 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.149
 mortgage 25 thousand rubles we bought in 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.360
 loan with a minimum down payment on 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:47.370
 10 15 20 percent what we get 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.730
 renting this apartment we will be in the red 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:53.129
 unprofitable and most people are 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:56.160
 believe that investments are unprofitable because 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:59.280
 that you will pay more on the mortgage 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.050
 what do you pay tenants but if we 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.120
 come to this question differently if 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.369
 we take this little odnushku and 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.619
 we will break into two small 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.479
 studios so man can there 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.540
 live a full life that is, and it's a little 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:15.810
 apartment yes there she is 17 meters only 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.729
 but we rent it already cheaper we rent for 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.520
 seventeen eighteen thousand rubles and 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:23.040
 rocket such studios brings already 35 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.400
 thousand rubles and now the picture is changing 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:29.159
 without them out of 35 25 we pay by 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.790
 mortgage and 10,000 remains us passive 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.790
 cash flow 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.800
 so we came to the apartment which 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.270
 split into two studio apartments in one 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:43.270
 studios we are with you 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.630
 he is the node itself here is the entrance to the main 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.930
 a door 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:49.270
 All together, all repairs took us 17 days 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.400
 investor repair is done quickly our 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:54.250
 the main task is to do it as much as possible 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:56.290
 quickly because we pay the mortgage if 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.900
 but also accordingly if not quickly 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:00.550
 we occupy the tenants do not do repairs then 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.140
 us more and more on the cat and 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:04.119
 accumulates a loss so you need it 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.100
 do fast but still 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:10.270
 quality enough beautiful 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:13.330
 the timing was tight enough 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:16.510
 but we managed 17 days even I would 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:18.820
 said 16 today and consider here 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.560
 the front door from here go 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:22.420
 respectively here is a small corridor and 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.820
 hence the division of one studio 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.950
 and 2 studio let's see this 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:28.780
 studios done we always minimize 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.660
 non-residential premises therefore corridor 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:35.380
 premises but the minimum here is such 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:37.450
 here's a cool wardrobe sofa tongues sofa 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:40.060
 which turns into a bed one more 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.730
 such a decision space on this such 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.590
 tables 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.810
 sold in ikea that is a folding table 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.940
 a table that immediately saves us a lot 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:52.060
 places and allows on the one hand if 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.799
 need to make a table if you do not need it 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.209
 and back it turned you like this 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:57.010
 shelf and space again 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:59.680
 freed and the most frequently asked 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.660
 the question is how to make a second bathroom 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.510
 2 bathrooms in one apartment 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:06.040
 Enough non standard process for 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:09.190
 it was necessary to buy a certain 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:11.320
 equipment where we have a pump to 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:15.130
 which pumps directly all the water 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:16.810
 and does not say so clogged riser 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:18.820
 here's a classic bathroom 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.769
 let's try to climb it all 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:23.530
 two square meters that is two meters 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:25.209
 here so here and one method wide 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.730
 investor bathroom is done by 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:30.310
 the minimization principle is again not alive 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.490
 space kitchen block all this one 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:34.780
 the thing is 

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:36.620
 90 centimeters kitchen unit 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:38.900
 respectively, immediately he goes here 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:41.060
 lockers here below and 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.860
 and a pair of chopsticks we are in the first 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:45.470
 studios respectively here is the main 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:48.470
 riser here go pipe cold hot 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:50.810
 water sewage and second studio need 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:53.560
 all end up here like this how it goes 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:56.420
 now if we see you see such 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:04:00.920
 tracks in which are hidden actually 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:02.480
 all pipes and how fun pipe such those 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:04.460
 who bring cold hot water 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:06.680
 they are hidden like this and walk along 

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:10.640
 apartments here these pipes fit there 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:13.670
 here they come already here in the second 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:17.200
 kitchen unit actually go further 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:21.670
 the bathroom here is the ventilation that is which 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:22.820
 makes the hood out of this bathroom in 

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:25.190
 the main 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:28.430
 that's exactly the same in the second studio made 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:31.460
 put such a sofa language and folding 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:33.950
 beautiful picture that bonus to us 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:35.870
 you painted the main builder yuri in 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:38.870
 This studio table is the most common made 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:41.630
 Ie ordinary table bought in this 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:44.390
 your mibura merlin bc and fridge too 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:45.590
 investors ska and the solution is that 

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:48.440
 most people have huge refrigerators 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:51.410
 not so necessary for people this is more 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:53.930
 degree this apartment is a place where not 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:57.800
 Comes sleep also here is investor 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:59.590
 the solution is such a locker 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:02.810
 that is, which again goes 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:05.750
 tremendous saving wall here this 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:07.970
 the wall it divides itself 2 studios 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:09.680
 that is, on this side, I am 110 different 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:12.560
 they are made of drywall with 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:17.230
 sound insulation inside and glass wool 0 plus 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:17.230
 some additional materials 

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:24.040
 As a rule, the problem of such studios of course 

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:26.350
 depends on the location here is extremely 

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:27.730
 important factor is proximity to 

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:30.100
 transport if we are talking about 

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:31.990
 near Moscow to close 

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:34.630
 there was a railway station to 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:38.380
 you could quickly get to the place 

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:41.140
 work and if we choose a place 

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:42.940
 successfully choose a place then we like 

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:44.650
 rule such studios surrender very 

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:47.950
 fast that is for literally 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:50.590
 a few days one week we settle 

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:52.840
 completely then both studios and in this 

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:54.670
 case in this particular example if 

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:57.430
 would this apartment give up completely like 

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:59.710
 odnushka it would be about 21 22 thousand 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:01.690
 per month in this case she gives up 

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:03.460
 seventeen eighteen thousand each 

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:06.850
 studios difference 

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:08.860
 count that is, there are 20 2035 probably you 

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:11.260
 agree that the difference is very, very 

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:13.210
 significant repeat the main principle 

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:15.730
 which you must understand that when we 

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:17.890
 hand over a lot of advantages then we divide 

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:20.400
 big on small first tenants for us 

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:22.960
 pays the mortgage the mortgage is extinguished that is 

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:25.990
 the apartment is increasingly moving into ours 

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:28.270
 the property is essentially the third is that 

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:30.100
 we constantly increase our cash flow 

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:32.710
 stretched up because we index 

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:34.450
 together with the rent the apartment itself 

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:38.050
 going up in price 

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:40.240
 and with it we still have a passive 

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:42.070
 cash flow in a small object this 

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:44.950
 maybe ten thousand rubles 

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:46.420
 as in the example of this apartment but the same 

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:48.940
 the most can be made a big object 

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:50.950
 for example with our townhouse which 

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:52.750
 divided into 10 studios there is already cash 

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:55.750
 stream of about two hundred thousand rubles 

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:57.310
 which of course is much more interesting but also 

00:06:55.750 --> 00:07:01.060
 costs naturally more 

00:06:57.310 --> 00:07:03.220
 and this format is fast in this case 

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:06.100
 the apartment was bought in a new building she 

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:08.080
 I gave up 17 days ago she gave up I 

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:10.360
 got your hands on the keys immediately the next 

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:11.950
 the day we notice with the builders passes 

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:15.510
 two and a half weeks all repairs 

00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:15.510
 fully ready we populate people
