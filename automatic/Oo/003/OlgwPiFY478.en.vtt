00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:04.650 

I<00:00:02.100> still<00:00:03.100> want<00:00:03.310> to<00:00:03.340> be<00:00:03.460> able<00:00:03.550> to<00:00:03.670> have<00:00:04.000> my<00:00:04.390> light

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:04.660 
I still want to be able to have my light

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:09.299 
I still want to be able to have my light
source<00:00:05.549> you<00:00:06.549> know<00:00:06.670> from<00:00:07.000> my<00:00:07.210> working<00:00:07.720> light<00:00:08.309> to

00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:09.309 
source you know from my working light to

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:12.720 
source you know from my working light to
shine<00:00:09.610> into<00:00:10.330> the<00:00:10.809> palm<00:00:11.219> because<00:00:12.219> you<00:00:12.369> can<00:00:12.520> see

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:12.730 
shine into the palm because you can see

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:14.459 
shine into the palm because you can see
the<00:00:12.910> majority<00:00:13.330> of<00:00:13.360> the<00:00:13.480> shadow<00:00:13.719> is<00:00:14.020> on<00:00:14.199> this

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:14.469 
the majority of the shadow is on this

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:16.920 
the majority of the shadow is on this
side<00:00:14.770> and<00:00:15.250> that's<00:00:15.940> really<00:00:16.180> important<00:00:16.720> for<00:00:16.750> me

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:16.930 
side and that's really important for me

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:17.609 
side and that's really important for me
too

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:17.619 
too

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:19.640 
too
I<00:00:17.650> want<00:00:18.220> to<00:00:18.280> have<00:00:18.400> every<00:00:18.910> opportunity<00:00:18.940> to

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
I want to have every opportunity to

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.620 
I want to have every opportunity to
really<00:00:20.650> see<00:00:20.680> the<00:00:21.460> value<00:00:22.000> that<00:00:22.030> I'm<00:00:22.330> putting

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:22.630 
really see the value that I'm putting

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:24.840 
really see the value that I'm putting
down<00:00:22.860> it's<00:00:23.860> not<00:00:24.040> going<00:00:24.190> to<00:00:24.280> do<00:00:24.370> me<00:00:24.550> a<00:00:24.580> lot<00:00:24.789> of

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:24.850 
down it's not going to do me a lot of

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:27.600 
down it's not going to do me a lot of
good<00:00:25.150> to<00:00:25.360> really<00:00:26.230> be<00:00:26.350> careful<00:00:26.830> and<00:00:27.010> take<00:00:27.310> it<00:00:27.490> a

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:27.610 
good to really be careful and take it a

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:29.760 
good to really be careful and take it a
little<00:00:27.850> at<00:00:28.000> a<00:00:28.119> time<00:00:28.150> so<00:00:29.080> that<00:00:29.110> I'm<00:00:29.350> in<00:00:29.380> complete

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:29.770 
little at a time so that I'm in complete

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:32.369 
little at a time so that I'm in complete
control<00:00:29.890> and<00:00:30.520> I<00:00:30.580> can<00:00:30.760> bring<00:00:31.060> a<00:00:31.210> value<00:00:31.600> up<00:00:31.810> to

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:32.379 
control and I can bring a value up to

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:34.380 
control and I can bring a value up to
what<00:00:32.590> I<00:00:32.619> think<00:00:32.770> is<00:00:33.100> just<00:00:33.460> right<00:00:33.879> for<00:00:33.910> the

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:34.390 
what I think is just right for the

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:36.569 
what I think is just right for the
balanced<00:00:34.870> overall<00:00:35.260> balance<00:00:35.590> of<00:00:35.680> the<00:00:35.829> drawing

00:00:36.569 --> 00:00:36.579 
balanced overall balance of the drawing

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:38.400 
balanced overall balance of the drawing
at<00:00:36.880> that<00:00:37.150> point<00:00:37.510> because<00:00:37.960> it's<00:00:38.230> going<00:00:38.350> to

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:38.410 
at that point because it's going to

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:40.410 
at that point because it's going to
change<00:00:38.680> I'm<00:00:39.100> gonna<00:00:39.340> see<00:00:39.610> it<00:00:39.730> differently<00:00:40.090> as<00:00:40.300> I

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:40.420 
change I'm gonna see it differently as I

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:43.889 
change I'm gonna see it differently as I
get<00:00:40.600> more<00:00:40.840> and<00:00:40.989> more<00:00:41.050> value<00:00:41.560> but<00:00:42.750> it's<00:00:43.750> not

00:00:43.889 --> 00:00:43.899 
get more and more value but it's not

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:45.150 
get more and more value but it's not
going<00:00:44.110> to<00:00:44.170> do<00:00:44.290> me<00:00:44.440> a<00:00:44.470> lot<00:00:44.680> of<00:00:44.710> good<00:00:44.920> if<00:00:45.040> I'm

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:45.160 
going to do me a lot of good if I'm

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.580 
going to do me a lot of good if I'm
working<00:00:45.370> in<00:00:45.640> a<00:00:45.730> shadow<00:00:46.030> and<00:00:46.420> I<00:00:47.079> have<00:00:47.350> this

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:47.590 
working in a shadow and I have this

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:51.000 
working in a shadow and I have this
light<00:00:47.950> way<00:00:48.250> over<00:00:48.550> here<00:00:49.050> and<00:00:50.050> now<00:00:50.380> you<00:00:50.440> can<00:00:50.800> see

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.010 
light way over here and now you can see

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:53.069 
light way over here and now you can see
over<00:00:51.250> on<00:00:51.760> the<00:00:52.000> other<00:00:52.149> side<00:00:52.450> I<00:00:52.480> know<00:00:52.720> it's<00:00:52.960> in

00:00:53.069 --> 00:00:53.079 
over on the other side I know it's in

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:54.810 
over on the other side I know it's in
the<00:00:53.170> way<00:00:53.320> but<00:00:53.620> now<00:00:54.100> I'm<00:00:54.399> going<00:00:54.579> to<00:00:54.670> have<00:00:54.790> a

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:54.820 
the way but now I'm going to have a

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.600 
the way but now I'm going to have a
different<00:00:55.480> sense<00:00:56.200> of<00:00:56.500> how<00:00:56.739> much<00:00:56.920> value<00:00:57.190> there

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:57.610 
different sense of how much value there

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:59.160 
different sense of how much value there
is<00:00:57.730> if<00:00:57.940> I'm<00:00:58.059> working<00:00:58.390> in<00:00:58.510> a<00:00:58.600> shadow<00:00:58.840> all<00:00:59.050> the

00:00:59.160 --> 00:00:59.170 
is if I'm working in a shadow all the

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:01.530 
is if I'm working in a shadow all the
time<00:00:59.380> so<00:01:00.100> I<00:01:00.129> have<00:01:00.460> enough<00:01:00.730> light<00:01:00.969> on<00:01:01.180> in<00:01:01.390> this

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:01.540 
time so I have enough light on in this

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:03.299 
time so I have enough light on in this
room<00:01:01.870> that<00:01:02.140> it<00:01:02.260> starts<00:01:02.559> becoming<00:01:02.890> a<00:01:03.070> little

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:03.309 
room that it starts becoming a little

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:05.700 
room that it starts becoming a little
bit<00:01:03.509> hard<00:01:04.509> to<00:01:04.600> see<00:01:04.689> that<00:01:04.960> shadow<00:01:05.259> but<00:01:05.560> it's

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:05.710 
bit hard to see that shadow but it's

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.940 
bit hard to see that shadow but it's
still<00:01:05.920> there<00:01:06.159> so<00:01:07.109> anyway<00:01:08.109> you're<00:01:08.530> gonna<00:01:08.619> clean

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:08.950 
still there so anyway you're gonna clean

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:10.319 
still there so anyway you're gonna clean
up<00:01:09.130> a<00:01:09.249> few<00:01:09.280> things<00:01:09.579> every<00:01:09.969> once<00:01:10.149> in<00:01:10.209> a<00:01:10.270> while

00:01:10.319 --> 00:01:10.329 
up a few things every once in a while

00:01:10.329 --> 00:01:13.639 
up a few things every once in a while
I'll<00:01:10.600> just<00:01:10.659> jump<00:01:11.139> in<00:01:11.319> and<00:01:11.499> I'll<00:01:11.619> I'll<00:01:12.149> maybe

00:01:13.639 --> 00:01:13.649 
I'll just jump in and I'll I'll maybe

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:17.129 
I'll just jump in and I'll I'll maybe
refine<00:01:14.729> you<00:01:15.729> know<00:01:15.850> a<00:01:15.880> few<00:01:16.149> strokes<00:01:16.479> that<00:01:16.869> maybe

00:01:17.129 --> 00:01:17.139 
refine you know a few strokes that maybe

00:01:17.139 --> 00:01:19.019 
refine you know a few strokes that maybe
got<00:01:17.409> a<00:01:17.439> little<00:01:17.709> separated<00:01:18.249> there<00:01:18.490> and<00:01:18.670> wayward

00:01:19.019 --> 00:01:19.029 
got a little separated there and wayward

00:01:19.029 --> 00:01:23.849 
got a little separated there and wayward
and<00:01:19.950> and<00:01:20.950> then<00:01:21.579> I'm<00:01:21.969> I'm<00:01:22.840> looking<00:01:23.200> for<00:01:23.619> again

00:01:23.849 --> 00:01:23.859 
and and then I'm I'm looking for again

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:26.039 
and and then I'm I'm looking for again
that<00:01:24.100> contrast<00:01:24.639> between<00:01:24.819> these<00:01:25.299> dimensional

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:26.049 
that contrast between these dimensional

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:28.139 
that contrast between these dimensional
clean<00:01:26.350> edges<00:01:26.560> having<00:01:27.459> a<00:01:27.549> chance<00:01:27.789> to<00:01:27.939> put<00:01:28.119> a

00:01:28.139 --> 00:01:28.149 
clean edges having a chance to put a

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:30.539 
clean edges having a chance to put a
little<00:01:28.299> darker<00:01:28.659> value<00:01:29.049> back<00:01:29.319> in<00:01:29.560> here<00:01:29.859> but

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:30.549 
little darker value back in here but

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:33.149 
little darker value back in here but
when<00:01:30.700> I'm<00:01:30.880> putting<00:01:31.179> the<00:01:31.270> value<00:01:31.749> here<00:01:32.229> this<00:01:32.950> is

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:33.159 
when I'm putting the value here this is

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:35.429 
when I'm putting the value here this is
what<00:01:33.340> it's<00:01:33.490> going<00:01:33.609> to<00:01:33.700> constantly<00:01:34.389> go<00:01:34.599> on<00:01:34.810> I'm

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:35.439 
what it's going to constantly go on I'm

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:37.050 
what it's going to constantly go on I'm
going<00:01:35.770> to<00:01:35.889> see<00:01:36.189> that<00:01:36.369> I'm<00:01:36.459> starting<00:01:36.729> to<00:01:36.880> catch

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.060 
going to see that I'm starting to catch

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.660 
going to see that I'm starting to catch
up<00:01:37.119> with<00:01:37.479> this<00:01:37.719> so<00:01:38.529> that's<00:01:38.829> the<00:01:39.099> indicator<00:01:39.579> I

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:39.670 
up with this so that's the indicator I

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:41.730 
up with this so that's the indicator I
don't<00:01:39.909> want<00:01:40.060> to<00:01:40.149> lose<00:01:40.359> the<00:01:40.749> definition<00:01:41.409> I<00:01:41.529> have

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
don't want to lose the definition I have

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.099 
don't want to lose the definition I have
in<00:01:41.889> these<00:01:42.039> parts<00:01:42.520> I<00:01:42.789> don't<00:01:43.389> want<00:01:43.539> to<00:01:43.630> have<00:01:43.810> this

00:01:44.099 --> 00:01:44.109 
in these parts I don't want to have this

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:45.929 
in these parts I don't want to have this
be<00:01:44.619> something<00:01:45.039> I'm<00:01:45.159> gonna<00:01:45.340> have<00:01:45.429> to<00:01:45.579> figure

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:45.939 
be something I'm gonna have to figure

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:48.209 
be something I'm gonna have to figure
out<00:01:46.119> all<00:01:46.299> over<00:01:46.329> again<00:01:46.929> because<00:01:47.380> I<00:01:47.590> just<00:01:47.709> got<00:01:48.009> so

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:48.219 
out all over again because I just got so

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:51.089 
out all over again because I just got so
carried<00:01:48.459> away<00:01:48.669> taking<00:01:49.479> the<00:01:49.569> value<00:01:49.959> up<00:01:50.169> that<00:01:50.859> I

00:01:51.089 --> 00:01:51.099 
carried away taking the value up that I

00:01:51.099 --> 00:01:54.480 
carried away taking the value up that I
I<00:01:51.789> just<00:01:52.359> completely<00:01:52.899> obliterated<00:01:53.200> all<00:01:54.009> the

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490 
I just completely obliterated all the

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:57.149 
I just completely obliterated all the
detail<00:01:54.880> and<00:01:55.149> the<00:01:55.419> edges<00:01:55.779> of<00:01:55.810> things<00:01:56.109> so<00:01:56.859> when<00:01:57.130> I

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:57.159 
detail and the edges of things so when I

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:00.330 
detail and the edges of things so when I
do<00:01:57.310> this<00:01:57.669> and<00:01:58.149> I'm<00:01:58.959> getting<00:01:59.649> that<00:01:59.770> value<00:02:00.189> in

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
do this and I'm getting that value in

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.760 
do this and I'm getting that value in
there<00:02:00.549> I<00:02:00.759> don't<00:02:01.450> want<00:02:01.840> to<00:02:01.959> go<00:02:02.049> all<00:02:02.289> the<00:02:02.739> way

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
there I don't want to go all the way

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:04.830 
there I don't want to go all the way
across<00:02:03.189> or<00:02:03.729> I'm<00:02:03.939> gonna<00:02:04.119> start<00:02:04.359> losing<00:02:04.569> that

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
across or I'm gonna start losing that

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.679 
across or I'm gonna start losing that
form<00:02:05.169> and<00:02:05.529> I<00:02:06.159> also<00:02:06.399> want<00:02:06.789> to<00:02:06.880> jump<00:02:07.090> in<00:02:07.270> here<00:02:07.450> now

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:07.689 
form and I also want to jump in here now

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:10.650 
form and I also want to jump in here now
and<00:02:07.989> I<00:02:08.500> want<00:02:08.739> to<00:02:08.860> come<00:02:09.039> up<00:02:09.220> with<00:02:09.399> a<00:02:09.660> another

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
and I want to come up with a another

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
and I want to come up with a another
grade<00:02:10.960> a<00:02:10.990> pencil<00:02:11.560> the<00:02:12.460> again<00:02:13.270> the<00:02:13.450> 2h<00:02:14.440> is<00:02:14.800> very

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
grade a pencil the again the 2h is very

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.449 
grade a pencil the again the 2h is very
limited<00:02:16.129> in<00:02:16.250> its<00:02:16.340> range<00:02:16.900> it's<00:02:17.900> quite<00:02:18.349> hard<00:02:18.739> and

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:19.459 
limited in its range it's quite hard and

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:20.890 
limited in its range it's quite hard and
sometimes<00:02:19.790> it<00:02:20.209> isn't<00:02:20.359> going<00:02:20.659> to<00:02:20.780> be

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
sometimes it isn't going to be

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.020 
sometimes it isn't going to be
everything<00:02:21.290> you<00:02:21.500> need<00:02:21.650> but<00:02:22.099> I'd<00:02:22.459> like<00:02:22.670> to<00:02:22.849> use

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
everything you need but I'd like to use

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.110 
everything you need but I'd like to use
it<00:02:23.209> every<00:02:23.450> time<00:02:23.870> I<00:02:24.079> have<00:02:24.680> a<00:02:24.709> chance<00:02:25.000> because<00:02:26.000> it

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
it every time I have a chance because it

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.849 
it every time I have a chance because it
still<00:02:26.329> gives<00:02:26.540> me<00:02:26.659> that<00:02:26.810> incremental<00:02:27.469> increase

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:27.859 
still gives me that incremental increase

00:02:27.859 --> 00:02:31.089 
still gives me that incremental increase
in<00:02:28.069> value<00:02:28.250> and<00:02:29.079> starts<00:02:30.079> helping<00:02:30.439> me<00:02:30.590> separate

00:02:31.089 --> 00:02:31.099 
in value and starts helping me separate

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:32.860 
in value and starts helping me separate
things<00:02:31.400> so<00:02:31.939> I'm<00:02:32.150> going<00:02:32.299> to<00:02:32.329> come<00:02:32.510> in<00:02:32.659> here

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
things so I'm going to come in here

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.470 
things so I'm going to come in here
again<00:02:32.959> and<00:02:33.500> even<00:02:34.430> though<00:02:34.579> I<00:02:34.609> may<00:02:34.909> change<00:02:35.150> it<00:02:35.389> a

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
again and even though I may change it a

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.119 
again and even though I may change it a
little<00:02:35.569> bit<00:02:35.780> later<00:02:35.989> I'm<00:02:36.260> gonna<00:02:36.650> reinforce

00:02:37.119 --> 00:02:37.129 
little bit later I'm gonna reinforce

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:39.729 
little bit later I'm gonna reinforce
that<00:02:37.700> darkest<00:02:38.209> deepest<00:02:38.659> part<00:02:38.989> in<00:02:39.230> there<00:02:39.469> and

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:39.739 
that darkest deepest part in there and

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:42.399 
that darkest deepest part in there and
do<00:02:40.489> it<00:02:40.519> in<00:02:40.760> a<00:02:40.849> way<00:02:41.030> that<00:02:41.060> doesn't<00:02:41.599> over<00:02:42.049> commit

00:02:42.399 --> 00:02:42.409 
do it in a way that doesn't over commit

00:02:42.409 --> 00:02:45.099 
do it in a way that doesn't over commit
me<00:02:42.620> but<00:02:43.219> still<00:02:43.579> stays<00:02:44.329> in<00:02:44.599> that<00:02:44.780> same

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:45.109 
me but still stays in that same

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:47.530 
me but still stays in that same
relationship<00:02:46.099> that<00:02:46.129> I<00:02:46.310> want<00:02:46.670> to<00:02:47.180> show<00:02:47.359> the

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
relationship that I want to show the

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.110 
relationship that I want to show the
difference<00:02:47.769> so<00:02:48.769> then<00:02:49.430> when<00:02:49.669> I<00:02:49.700> get<00:02:49.790> these

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
difference so then when I get these

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.069 
difference so then when I get these
things<00:02:50.359> like<00:02:50.689> this<00:02:50.989> now<00:02:51.620> I<00:02:52.069> can<00:02:52.430> start<00:02:53.079> coming

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:54.079 
things like this now I can start coming

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:57.759 
things like this now I can start coming
in<00:02:54.230> here<00:02:54.530> and<00:02:54.739> and<00:02:55.069> looking<00:02:55.970> for<00:02:56.269> the<00:02:56.769> other

00:02:57.759 --> 00:02:57.769 
in here and and looking for the other

00:02:57.769 --> 00:02:59.619 
in here and and looking for the other
gradations<00:02:58.519> that<00:02:58.579> are<00:02:58.730> gonna<00:02:58.849> be<00:02:59.090> making<00:02:59.329> up

00:02:59.619 --> 00:02:59.629 
gradations that are gonna be making up

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:01.869 
gradations that are gonna be making up
my<00:02:59.780> contours<00:03:00.319> so<00:03:00.590> already<00:03:01.400> we<00:03:01.669> have<00:03:01.849> a

00:03:01.869 --> 00:03:01.879 
my contours so already we have a

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:08.399 
my contours so already we have a
tremendous<00:03:03.730> contrast<00:03:04.730> in<00:03:05.169> value<00:03:06.169> and<00:03:06.650> in

00:03:08.399 --> 00:03:08.409 
tremendous contrast in value and in

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:10.869 
tremendous contrast in value and in
having<00:03:09.409> a<00:03:09.500> clean<00:03:09.739> edge<00:03:09.919> versus<00:03:10.340> a<00:03:10.370> contour

00:03:10.869 --> 00:03:10.879 
having a clean edge versus a contour

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:13.209 
having a clean edge versus a contour
remember<00:03:11.689> what<00:03:11.840> constitutes<00:03:12.409> a<00:03:12.530> contour<00:03:12.980> I

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:13.219 
remember what constitutes a contour I

00:03:13.219 --> 00:03:15.330 
remember what constitutes a contour I
can<00:03:13.579> see<00:03:13.790> in<00:03:14.030> and<00:03:14.659> out

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
can see in and out

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.550 
can see in and out
nothing<00:03:16.340> is<00:03:16.459> obliterating<00:03:17.299> my<00:03:17.450> view<00:03:17.659> nothing

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
nothing is obliterating my view nothing

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.280 
nothing is obliterating my view nothing
is<00:03:18.620> blocking<00:03:18.829> it<00:03:19.159> so<00:03:19.760> when<00:03:20.359> I'm<00:03:20.540> over<00:03:20.840> here<00:03:21.079> now

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
is blocking it so when I'm over here now

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.050 
is blocking it so when I'm over here now
I<00:03:21.319> can<00:03:21.709> concentrate<00:03:21.919> on<00:03:22.400> having<00:03:22.819> the<00:03:22.909> ultimate

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
I can concentrate on having the ultimate

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:25.990 
I can concentrate on having the ultimate
in<00:03:23.540> curve<00:03:23.810> I<00:03:24.199> want<00:03:24.919> to<00:03:25.069> be<00:03:25.190> able<00:03:25.310> to<00:03:25.459> make<00:03:25.790> sure

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
in curve I want to be able to make sure

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.460 
in curve I want to be able to make sure
that<00:03:26.180> I'm<00:03:26.299> not<00:03:26.479> coming<00:03:26.810> over<00:03:27.109> here<00:03:27.440> and

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
that I'm not coming over here and

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:29.770 
that I'm not coming over here and
suddenly<00:03:28.040> stopping<00:03:28.430> this<00:03:29.180> is<00:03:29.419> the<00:03:29.569> patch

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
suddenly stopping this is the patch

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:32.409 
suddenly stopping this is the patch
exercise<00:03:30.409> all<00:03:30.680> over<00:03:30.979> again<00:03:31.120> because<00:03:32.120> if<00:03:32.269> I

00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:32.419 
exercise all over again because if I

00:03:32.419 --> 00:03:34.089 
exercise all over again because if I
come<00:03:32.689> over<00:03:32.720> here<00:03:33.199> and<00:03:33.319> I'm<00:03:33.439> saying<00:03:33.620> well<00:03:33.829> I'm

00:03:34.089 --> 00:03:34.099 
come over here and I'm saying well I'm

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:35.679 
come over here and I'm saying well I'm
just<00:03:34.220> gonna<00:03:34.340> put<00:03:34.579> this<00:03:34.729> in<00:03:34.909> here<00:03:35.090> and<00:03:35.209> this

00:03:35.679 --> 00:03:35.689 
just gonna put this in here and this

00:03:35.689 --> 00:03:37.240 
just gonna put this in here and this
ends<00:03:35.900> up<00:03:36.019> by<00:03:36.139> being<00:03:36.319> quite<00:03:36.590> flat<00:03:36.889> and<00:03:36.919> then<00:03:37.220> I

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 
ends up by being quite flat and then I

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:38.199 
ends up by being quite flat and then I
stop<00:03:37.579> suddenly

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:38.209 
stop suddenly

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:40.000 
stop suddenly
well<00:03:38.599> then<00:03:38.810> I've<00:03:38.959> created<00:03:39.319> another<00:03:39.560> two

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
well then I've created another two

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:42.069 
well then I've created another two
competing<00:03:40.669> dimensional<00:03:41.299> edge<00:03:41.449> to<00:03:41.689> this<00:03:41.840> one

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:42.079 
competing dimensional edge to this one

competing dimensional edge to this one
and<00:03:42.709> I<00:03:42.829> don't<00:03:42.859> want<00:03:43.159> that<00:03:43.340> here<00:03:43.669> I<00:03:43.819> want<00:03:44.299> this

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:44.419 
and I don't want that here I want this

00:03:44.419 --> 00:03:47.259 
and I don't want that here I want this
to<00:03:44.629> be<00:03:44.780> a<00:03:45.099> contour<00:03:46.099> I<00:03:46.159> want<00:03:46.549> this<00:03:46.639> to<00:03:46.790> be<00:03:46.819> round

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:47.269 
to be a contour I want this to be round

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:50.259 
to be a contour I want this to be round
and<00:03:47.659> yet<00:03:48.379> there's<00:03:48.590> a<00:03:48.680> core<00:03:48.979> value<00:03:49.009> to<00:03:49.579> it<00:03:49.699> so<00:03:50.239> I

00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:50.269 
and yet there's a core value to it so I

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:51.909 
and yet there's a core value to it so I

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:51.919 
really want to make sure that I don't

really want to make sure that I don't
just<00:03:52.040> make<00:03:52.220> it<00:03:52.370> a<00:03:52.430> flat<00:03:52.609> area<00:03:53.060> I<00:03:53.479> want<00:03:54.079> to

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:57.939 
just make it a flat area I want to
always<00:03:54.769> see<00:03:55.579> a<00:03:55.849> range<00:03:56.419> of<00:03:56.720> value<00:03:57.109> I<00:03:57.379> want<00:03:57.829> to

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:05.019 
how can I make this contour it and round

how can I make this contour it and round
