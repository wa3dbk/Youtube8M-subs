00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
finally I start the checkout process I

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.720 
finally I start the checkout process I
have<00:04:11.440> a<00:04:11.470> sheet<00:04:11.710> to<00:04:11.830> be<00:04:11.950> signed<00:04:12.250> at<00:04:12.460> every

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:12.730

station very official I love checklists
so<00:04:16.630> the<00:04:16.720> first<00:04:16.870> table<00:04:17.140> is<00:04:17.350> class<00:04:17.590> tues<00:04:18.239> $15<00:04:19.239> now

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:19.450 
so the first table is class tues $15 now

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:23.400 
so the first table is class tues $15 now
or<00:04:19.840> $25<00:04:20.739> later<00:04:20.980> you<00:04:21.610> do<00:04:21.730> the<00:04:21.850> math<00:04:21.880> I<00:04:22.410> have

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:23.410 
or $25 later you do the math I have

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:25.680 
or $25 later you do the math I have
about<00:04:23.620> three<00:04:23.890> dollars<00:04:24.040> at<00:04:24.430> some<00:04:25.150> old<00:04:25.240> passes

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:25.690 
about three dollars at some old passes

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:26.880 
about three dollars at some old passes
in<00:04:25.810> my<00:04:25.900> wallet<00:04:26.110> so<00:04:26.350> I<00:04:26.380> guess<00:04:26.590> I'll<00:04:26.740> be<00:04:26.800> getting

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:26.890 
in my wallet so I guess I'll be getting

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:30.090 
in my wallet so I guess I'll be getting
back<00:04:27.130> to<00:04:27.190> them<00:04:28.470> if<00:04:29.470> you<00:04:29.620> pay<00:04:29.770> your<00:04:29.890> dues

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:30.100

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:32.370 
back to them if you pay your dues
however<00:04:30.580> you<00:04:31.270> get<00:04:31.390> a<00:04:31.450> fancy<00:04:31.960> pen<00:04:32.170> in<00:04:32.290> either

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:32.380 
however you get a fancy pen in either

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:37.350 
however you get a fancy pen in either
orange<00:04:32.950> or<00:04:33.510> wait<00:04:34.510> for<00:04:34.540> it<00:04:34.870> black<00:04:35.800> I<00:04:36.360> would

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360 
orange or wait for it black I would

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.580 
orange or wait for it black I would
never<00:04:37.510> have<00:04:37.690> guessed<00:04:37.840> these<00:04:38.050> colors<00:04:38.410> for<00:04:38.560> a

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:38.590 
never have guessed these colors for a

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:42.600 
never have guessed these colors for a
Princeton<00:04:38.950> giveaway<00:04:39.310> I<00:04:41.190> realized<00:04:42.190> later<00:04:42.460> that

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:42.610 
Princeton giveaway I realized later that

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:44.070 
Princeton giveaway I realized later that
these<00:04:42.940> pens<00:04:43.300> are<00:04:43.540> just<00:04:43.660> another<00:04:43.900> way<00:04:44.050> to

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.080 
these pens are just another way to

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:45.480 
these pens are just another way to
distinguish<00:04:44.740> who's<00:04:44.920> better<00:04:45.130> than<00:04:45.220> me<00:04:45.340> at

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:45.490 
distinguish who's better than me at

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:48.510 
distinguish who's better than me at
Princeton<00:04:46.170> so<00:04:47.170> I<00:04:47.200> assume<00:04:47.620> a<00:04:47.770> few<00:04:47.920> quintiles<00:04:48.340> of

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:48.520 
Princeton so I assume a few quintiles of

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:52.950 
Princeton so I assume a few quintiles of
you<00:04:48.640> have<00:04:48.820> these<00:04:48.970> pens<00:04:51.240> the<00:04:52.240> next<00:04:52.480> table<00:04:52.660> was

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:58.570 
growing sense of alarm and I was faced

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:00.900 
growing sense of alarm and I was faced
with<00:04:58.690> an<00:04:58.870> instant<00:04:59.200> realization<00:04:59.710> I<00:04:59.950> don't<00:05:00.670> have

with an instant realization I don't have
any<00:05:01.090> money<00:05:01.300> to<00:05:01.450> give<00:05:01.780> to<00:05:01.810> Princeton<00:05:02.500> because<00:05:02.950> I

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:03.430 
any money to give to Princeton because I

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:10.100
