00:00:00.919 --> 00:00:04.020
 Hello everyone and it became clear 

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:08.980
 it is not written to him Yulia Tymoshenko 

00:00:09.729 --> 00:00:12.729
 because now in the real sector 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:16.549
 foundation per second 

00:00:18.589 --> 00:00:20.089
 now winery 

00:00:20.089 --> 00:00:23.089
 I will say that I have 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.519
 buttons 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.689
 in the first lady ankh can be said playing 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:33.559
 on the server because the computer is not 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:36.080
 so weak that the players 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.130
 just impossible 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:42.360
 here substandard goods 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.360
 choosing the two guys is not all so 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.600
 And the second volume on the Solovki case 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.020
 monarch 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.130
 they invited me to play with 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:00.130
 our our almost two hours 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.880
 let's say because 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.960
 liked it first 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.270
 that is, there is no sand castle 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.460
 something like a castle 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.420
 the contribution is from mate g km highway 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.630
 for this, no buildings 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:19.570
 affecting 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:22.340
 we have a meter 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.350
 in general, nothing else through us 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.420
 What can I say 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.630
 I liked to play shoals 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.439
 but naturally it's interesting than when 

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:34.190
 one running 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:36.180
 two of us 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.180
 it is immediately apparent that 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.240
 about the same castle I was going 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.770
 build at home 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.660
 people will start great if you remember 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:49.710
 releases there on top of portman promised 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.710
 such a spicy thing happened 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
 so something like that was going to compass 3d 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:59.350
 if not 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:02.350
 by the way all the same 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:06.350
 institutions laconic 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.440
 at the crossroads we will start the role and the year there 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.079
 to build a castle 

00:02:11.079 --> 00:02:14.079
 dynamo bye 

00:02:15.889 --> 00:02:18.119
 but it's flowers compared to others 

00:02:18.119 --> 00:02:21.329
 the server on which I tried to lose 

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:23.339
 it was simply impossible to play there 

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:26.109
 I do not remember the name of the distorted 

00:02:26.109 --> 00:02:28.259
 then there was a lot of buildings a lot 

00:02:28.259 --> 00:02:30.059
 people played 

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:31.000
 tons 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.950
 innovation to put it in the corner and who 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.849
 faster route 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:38.209
 I used the opportunity I asked to go 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:40.109
 lose but nothing happened because 

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:41.870
 that even now loading on not 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.749
 got friends 

00:02:44.749 --> 00:02:47.949
 while i was offline here i'm watching guys 

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:49.559
 time wasted 

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:51.229
 since then not secured pe 

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:54.539
 damaged the walls of crops 

00:02:54.539 --> 00:02:56.109
 apartment once when i went in 

00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:57.099
 judicial system 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:02:59.989
 a small piece of sternik cake 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:02.449
 wooden construction race 

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:04.450
 guys so offended 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:07.120
 20 members are changing right away 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.999
 corovicin 

00:03:09.999 --> 00:03:12.709
 what to say just saw ii quarter water 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:14.789
 laudable 

00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:16.839
 but now it already looms there he 

00:03:16.839 --> 00:03:19.699
 Castle 

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:21.639
 John Bolton 

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:24.639
 but hiddink 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:29.599
 but apparently everything lays the phenomenon of domains 

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:32.599
 it is not clear how to play 

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:36.129
 what else to say 

00:03:37.469 --> 00:03:39.099
 from the height of this when it falls and breaks 

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:42.209
 such a bulygin would have decreased and 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:43.999
 OK good 

00:03:43.999 --> 00:03:46.999
 how many times have I adapted to myself 

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:51.969
 but in general, I have nothing more to say 

00:03:51.969 --> 00:03:53.590
 because last 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:56.059
 the institution was located 

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:57.849
 week of fasting 

00:03:57.849 --> 00:03:59.529
 one week and chat uah 

00:03:59.529 --> 00:04:01.059
 he didn't have a perfect time 

00:04:01.059 --> 00:04:02.919
 computer 

00:04:02.919 --> 00:04:04.859
 translated in others to them 

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:07.619
 spring summer all the same 

00:04:07.619 --> 00:04:10.619
 spend a lot of time on the street 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:13.989
 he is but he is more accurate this week 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:16.989
 last residue 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:21.919
 in total about 

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:24.830
 at four five o'clock we lost 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:27.059
 built mines 

00:04:27.059 --> 00:04:30.059
 absolutely scary 

00:04:34.689 --> 00:04:37.259
 single never played 

00:04:37.259 --> 00:04:40.520
 hands on so many mistakes in the workshop 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:43.089
 especially did not stop losing who can 

00:04:43.089 --> 00:04:44.510
 be and appeal to you 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:47.409
 one more release of something 

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:49.550
 and by the way about the comments people 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:52.550
 writes that hair is forbidden bullshit 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:55.260
 nato short gifts 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.610
 in the rooms of stone the essence is clear 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:01.199
 what can I say yes yes I myself think that 

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:02.999
 new entry house 

00:05:02.999 --> 00:05:05.569
 Pyongyang on the rack 

00:05:05.569 --> 00:05:08.569
 suffered five years decided for myself 

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:11.759
 so to speak 

00:05:11.759 --> 00:05:14.479
 MMK will not put not only paws account 

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:16.900
 number for yourself to see later 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.099
 remember smiled there somewhere in the middle 

00:05:19.099 --> 00:05:21.479
 architect cry in general it's just 

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:24.819
 memories of the game 

00:05:24.819 --> 00:05:25.930
 he 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:28.320
 that is, it is what other people are doing 

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:30.530
 good players writes like this 

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:33.789
 release a good explanation other 

00:05:33.789 --> 00:05:35.869
 nice to look interesting given 

00:05:35.869 --> 00:05:37.330
 release 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:39.000
 someone can make money 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.050
 perform 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:42.729
 Someone there opened lessons for beginners 

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:44.810
 deluxe good writer doctors 

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:45.900
 teams 

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:48.590
 I don't do it purely just because he 

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:50.620
 cafe as help take off 

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:53.300
 these feelings are not a judge 

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:55.789
 because after the game people are growing 

00:05:55.789 --> 00:05:58.789
 play in Korea 

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:01.849
 most likely on the edge 

00:06:01.849 --> 00:06:04.289
 will show we do not know what we are talking about this topic 

00:06:04.289 --> 00:06:06.860
 and what you have left to see is not yet 

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:09.199
 just a character of something else 

00:06:09.199 --> 00:06:09.939
 also being worked out 

00:06:09.939 --> 00:06:12.069
 characters removed 

00:06:12.069 --> 00:06:14.210
 Almaty 

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:16.759
 there are only memories 

00:06:16.759 --> 00:06:18.860
 I have my memories simple scheme 

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:20.779
 now 

00:06:20.779 --> 00:06:21.699
 i watched i really 

00:06:21.699 --> 00:06:22.940
 nice place 

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:24.229
 it's not funny 

00:06:24.229 --> 00:06:25.669
 by itself Yaroshenko 

00:06:25.669 --> 00:06:28.669
 I like 

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:33.550
 conscience 

00:06:36.589 --> 00:06:39.279
 but didnâ€™t consider surviving tons because if you 

00:06:39.279 --> 00:06:42.279
 it's good everything is high 

00:06:43.339 --> 00:06:45.639
 Well, anyway, Samara two
