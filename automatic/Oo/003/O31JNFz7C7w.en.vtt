00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.920
 and hello guys my name is Jason and 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.650
 I would like to show you one such trick 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.900
 boil gasp long I even 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.689
 not a trick this is so flexible because 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.480
 damn really cool he was done on bmx 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:27.269
 and he just fucking done he so 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:32.880
 it looks so cool this is kind of a trick 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:35.340
 like a bug in gta I donâ€™t know and so no 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.530
 No, that does not work and so here I am 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.079
 tried to do it already 40 minutes before 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.809
 start shooting and from me once 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.850
 It turned out he and I decided to shoot this thing 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.280
 because you would be so cool that 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.120
 Well, you guys know when it's your long 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.579
 does not work 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.649
 pruning will take and get it 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.410
 really cool is very, very cool 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:01:03.329
 because it's really nice when he 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:06.060
 it turns out damn so different so what 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:09.119
 also come in short we need to accelerate 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.890
 jump i'll show you a noticeable shoot in 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.900
 being an exit will fail if I 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.210
 In general, this business will pancake they 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.210
 no change at all 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.159
 do nothing like this monica decline she 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.759
 and videos often trick 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.650
 or by the way can I take pictures of tricks 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.630
 gta 5 well, that this thing is very similar to 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:32.220
 trick 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:33.479

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:38.100

 wahl how are these genes damn go nuts when 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:45.180
 cool and so we accelerate by jumping on 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.670

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.340
