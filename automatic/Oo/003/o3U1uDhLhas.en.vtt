00:03:31.369 --> 00:03:31.379 
bike did well I was really really

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:33.589 
bike did well I was really really
impressed<00:03:31.650> to<00:03:31.739> that<00:03:31.939> yeah<00:03:32.939> what<00:03:33.420> can<00:03:33.510> you

expect
1000<00:03:35.189> cc<00:03:35.310> supercharged<00:03:36.420> that's<00:03:36.959> impressive

00:03:37.399 --> 00:03:37.409 
1000 cc supercharged that's impressive

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:38.750 
1000 cc supercharged that's impressive
I<00:03:37.500> like<00:03:37.650> the<00:03:37.769> bit<00:03:37.920> it's<00:03:38.129> a<00:03:38.189> bit<00:03:38.220> of<00:03:38.400> a<00:03:38.430> beast

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
I like the bit it's a bit of a beast

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.729 
I like the bit it's a bit of a beast
what<00:03:39.120> sort<00:03:39.450> of<00:03:39.480> speeds<00:03:39.780> were<00:03:40.140> you<00:03:40.260> hitting<00:03:40.470> on

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
what sort of speeds were you hitting on

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:42.649 
what sort of speeds were you hitting on
the<00:03:41.099> back<00:03:41.310> Straker's<00:03:41.730> on<00:03:41.879> the<00:03:42.239> quarter<00:03:42.510> mile

00:03:42.649 --> 00:03:42.659 
the back Straker's on the quarter mile

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:44.690 
the back Straker's on the quarter mile
bit<00:03:42.900> there<00:03:43.379> was<00:03:43.439> hardly<00:03:43.680> any<00:03:43.950> space<00:03:44.250> at<00:03:44.609> the

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
bit there was hardly any space at the

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.250 
bit there was hardly any space at the
end<00:03:44.849> so<00:03:45.060> we<00:03:45.180> were<00:03:45.269> both<00:03:45.420> heavy<00:03:45.750> on<00:03:45.930> the<00:03:46.019> brakes

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
end so we were both heavy on the brakes

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.470 
end so we were both heavy on the brakes
in<00:03:47.099> way<00:03:47.310> too<00:03:47.370> much<00:03:47.609> attention<00:03:47.849> to<00:03:48.030> the<00:03:48.209> braking

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
in way too much attention to the braking

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.059 
in way too much attention to the braking
zone<00:03:48.629> for<00:03:48.900> the<00:03:49.230> quarter<00:03:49.470> mile<00:03:49.620> that<00:03:49.650> on<00:03:49.980> the

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:50.069 
zone for the quarter mile that on the

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:51.530 
zone for the quarter mile that on the
back<00:03:50.220> straight<00:03:50.489> I<00:03:50.639> was<00:03:50.760> doing<00:03:51.030> probably<00:03:51.359> about

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
back straight I was doing probably about

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.710 
back straight I was doing probably about
165<00:03:52.170> so<00:03:52.650> we<00:03:52.829> the<00:03:53.010> h2<00:03:53.489> managed<00:03:54.090> to<00:03:54.209> squeeze<00:03:54.510> out

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
165 so we the h2 managed to squeeze out

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.750 
165 so we the h2 managed to squeeze out
indicate<00:03:55.290> a<00:03:55.319> hundred<00:03:55.709> and<00:03:55.799> eighty<00:03:55.950> a<00:03:56.129> so

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
indicate a hundred and eighty a so

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.479

probably<00:03:57.060> about<00:03:57.269> 117<00:03:58.230> real<00:03:58.709> true<00:03:59.159> speed

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489
