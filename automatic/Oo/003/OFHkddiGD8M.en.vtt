00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
do a lot of shooting I typically when I

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.170

take this guy out to the range I fire

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.920

probably<00:01:00.510> between<00:01:02.000> 200<00:01:03.000> and<00:01:03.030> 300<00:01:03.239> rounds<00:01:03.629> at<00:01:03.899> a

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
probably between 200 and 300 rounds at a

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.080 
probably between 200 and 300 rounds at a
time<00:01:04.250> just<00:01:05.250> because<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.610> ammo<00:01:05.760> is<00:01:05.939> so

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
time just because the ammo is so

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.510 
time just because the ammo is so
expensive<00:01:06.450> on<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.860> front<00:01:08.159> of<00:01:08.250> this<00:01:08.340> guy

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
expensive on the front of this guy

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.920 
expensive on the front of this guy
amounted<00:01:09.090> a<00:01:09.240> bow<00:01:09.750> bro<00:01:10.110> type<00:01:11.420> bipod<00:01:12.420> system

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
amounted a bow bro type bipod system

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.590 
amounted a bow bro type bipod system
this<00:01:13.650> thing<00:01:13.920> is<00:01:14.040> made<00:01:14.280> out<00:01:14.310> of<00:01:14.490> aluminum<00:01:15.299> it's

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
this thing is made out of aluminum it's

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.370 
this thing is made out of aluminum it's
real<00:01:16.080> tight<00:01:17.000> tolerances<00:01:18.000> it<00:01:18.240> I<00:01:18.630> mean<00:01:18.930> it<00:01:19.049> feels

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
real tight tolerances it I mean it feels

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.850 
real tight tolerances it I mean it feels
good<00:01:19.740> it's<00:01:20.009> solid<00:01:20.340> probably<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.150> best<00:01:21.860> bipod

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
good it's solid probably the best bipod

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.760 
good it's solid probably the best bipod
system<00:01:23.250> I've<00:01:23.400> come<00:01:23.700> across<00:01:24.770> unfortunately

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
system I've come across unfortunately

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.819 
system I've come across unfortunately
it's<00:01:25.979> not<00:01:26.189> cheap<00:01:26.520> but<00:01:27.000> I<00:01:27.570> firmly<00:01:28.350> believe<00:01:28.799> that

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
it's not cheap but I firmly believe that

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.050 
it's not cheap but I firmly believe that
you<00:01:29.070> get<00:01:29.340> what<00:01:29.460> you<00:01:29.549> pay<00:01:29.729> for

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
you get what you pay for

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.289 
you get what you pay for
so<00:01:30.869> I<00:01:30.900> went<00:01:31.079> ahead<00:01:31.170> and<00:01:31.290> did<00:01:31.470> that<00:01:31.820> I've<00:01:32.820> got<00:01:33.030> a

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
so I went ahead and did that I've got a

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.700 
so I went ahead and did that I've got a
Turner<00:01:33.750> national<00:01:34.740> match<00:01:34.950> sling<00:01:35.400> on<00:01:35.610> here<00:01:36.710> just

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
a good quality sling on the back I've

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.550 
a good quality sling on the back I've
got<00:01:40.799> the<00:01:41.130> Springfield<00:01:42.090> Armory<00:01:42.509> cheek<00:01:43.290> piece

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
got the Springfield Armory cheek piece

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.969 
got the Springfield Armory cheek piece
system<00:01:43.829> I<00:01:44.280> can't<00:01:45.240> say<00:01:45.450> it's<00:01:45.630> all<00:01:46.229> that<00:01:46.649> great

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
system I can't say it's all that great

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.100 
system I can't say it's all that great
it<00:01:47.549> gets<00:01:47.909> the<00:01:48.060> job<00:01:48.090> done<00:01:48.299> but<00:01:48.780> I'm<00:01:48.930> probably

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
it gets the job done but I'm probably

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.359 
it gets the job done but I'm probably
going<00:01:49.350> to<00:01:49.409> replace<00:01:49.799> that<00:01:50.009> with<00:01:50.070> something

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
going to replace that with something

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.880 
going to replace that with something
else<00:01:50.670> I<00:01:51.149> do<00:01:51.840> like<00:01:52.170> that<00:01:52.320> it<00:01:52.439> just<00:01:52.619> kind<00:01:52.740> of

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
else I do like that it just kind of

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.550 
else I do like that it just kind of
velcro's<00:01:53.430> around<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:54.689> buttstock<00:01:55.020> so<00:01:55.470> it

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
velcro's around the buttstock so it

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.139 
velcro's around the buttstock so it
doesn't<00:01:55.799> actually<00:01:55.890> damage<00:01:56.460> the<00:01:56.610> stock<00:01:56.850> in<00:01:57.030> any

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
doesn't actually damage the stock in any

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:02.120 
doesn't actually damage the stock in any

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
this together I highly recommend it this

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.860 
this together I highly recommend it this
the<00:02:22.920> configuration<00:02:23.610> it's<00:02:23.819> in<00:02:23.970> now<00:02:24.150> is<00:02:24.390> similar

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
the configuration it's in now is similar

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.309 
the configuration it's in now is similar
to<00:02:25.110> a<00:02:25.280> m-21<00:02:26.280> or<00:02:26.610> m25<00:02:27.239> type<00:02:27.569> system<00:02:28.019> that<00:02:28.230> the

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 
to a m-21 or m25 type system that the

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:31.039 
to a m-21 or m25 type system that the
military<00:02:28.769> uses<00:02:29.250> it's<00:02:30.180> not<00:02:30.330> quite<00:02:30.599> the<00:02:30.780> same

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:31.049 
military uses it's not quite the same

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:35.150 
military uses it's not quite the same
obviously<00:02:31.650> the<00:02:32.129> rifle<00:02:32.459> is<00:02:32.519> not<00:02:32.549> full<00:02:32.879> auto<00:02:34.160> but

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
obviously the rifle is not full auto but

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.910 
obviously the rifle is not full auto but
the<00:02:35.940> biggest<00:02:36.629> downside<00:02:37.019> of<00:02:37.140> this<00:02:37.260> rifle<00:02:37.470> is<00:02:37.739> it

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
the biggest downside of this rifle is it

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.860 
the biggest downside of this rifle is it
is<00:02:38.069> crazy<00:02:38.549> heavy<00:02:38.879> and<00:02:39.180> especially<00:02:39.510> when<00:02:39.780> you

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
is crazy heavy and especially when you

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.479 
is crazy heavy and especially when you
add<00:02:40.019> the<00:02:40.319> scope<00:02:40.650> and<00:02:40.950> the<00:02:41.010> mounts<00:02:41.370> and

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
add the scope and the mounts and

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:43.479 
add the scope and the mounts and
everything<00:02:41.879> it<00:02:42.150> gets<00:02:42.299> pretty<00:02:42.569> heavy

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:43.489 
everything it gets pretty heavy

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:46.819 
everything it gets pretty heavy
definitely<00:02:44.489> a<00:02:44.519> bench<00:02:44.790> gun<00:02:45.120> but<00:02:46.079> you<00:02:46.319> can<00:02:46.500> you

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:46.829 
definitely a bench gun but you can you

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:49.100 
definitely a bench gun but you can you
can<00:02:46.860> get<00:02:47.370> crazy<00:02:47.670> accurate<00:02:48.209> with<00:02:48.360> this<00:02:48.540> thing<00:02:48.780> I

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
can get crazy accurate with this thing I

can get crazy accurate with this thing I
just<00:02:49.799> want<00:02:50.069> to<00:02:50.099> take<00:02:50.280> some<00:02:50.310> time<00:02:50.640> and<00:02:50.790> show<00:02:50.970> it

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
just want to take some time and show it

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.360

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
type rifles this is definitely one of

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.839 
type rifles this is definitely one of
the<00:02:57.569> best<00:02:57.780> in<00:02:58.019> my<00:02:58.170> opinion<00:02:58.220> the<00:02:59.220> 308<00:02:59.730> caliber
