learn about the mountains all these

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:00.430 
learn about the mountains all these
things<00:03:58.120> happen<00:03:59.120> and<00:03:59.239> I<00:03:59.360> think<00:03:59.690> that<00:03:59.989> there's

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:00.440 
things happen and I think that there's

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.590 
things happen and I think that there's
been<00:04:00.709> a<00:04:00.739> huge<00:04:00.829> void<00:04:01.340> since<00:04:01.670> Craig's<00:04:02.030> died<00:04:02.299> and

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:02.600 
been a huge void since Craig's died and

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.800 
been a huge void since Craig's died and
I<00:04:02.660> think<00:04:02.930> there's<00:04:03.130> especially<00:04:04.130> been<00:04:04.370> this

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.810 
I think there's especially been this

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:08.680 
I think there's especially been this
backcountry<00:04:05.810> void<00:04:06.320> so<00:04:07.100> I<00:04:07.549> guess<00:04:07.910> lastly<00:04:08.360> what

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:08.690 
backcountry void so I guess lastly what

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:10.660 
backcountry void so I guess lastly what
