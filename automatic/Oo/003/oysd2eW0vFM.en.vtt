00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
two plants so from two seeds from aeon

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:22.400 
two plants so from two seeds from aeon
seeds<00:02:17.120> we<00:02:18.120> planted<00:02:18.980> over<00:02:19.980> here<00:02:20.609> in<00:02:20.790> our<00:02:21.410> garden

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
seeds we planted over here in our garden

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.150 
seeds we planted over here in our garden
area<00:02:23.269> over<00:02:24.269> the<00:02:24.389> summer<00:02:24.660> and<00:02:24.989> from<00:02:25.829> those<00:02:25.980> two

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
area over the summer and from those two

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:31.930 
area over the summer and from those two
seeds<00:02:26.459> we<00:02:26.700> got<00:02:28.010> we<00:02:29.010> got<00:02:29.040> over<00:02:29.720> gosh

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
seeds we got we got over gosh

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.780 
seeds we got we got over gosh
my<00:02:32.940> guess<00:02:33.209> is<00:02:33.239> like<00:02:33.450> a<00:02:33.690> hundred<00:02:34.400> all<00:02:35.400> these

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
my guess is like a hundred all these

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:47.550 
my guess is like a hundred all these
seeds<00:02:41.090> from<00:02:42.090> to<00:02:42.389> have<00:02:45.109> over<00:02:46.109> a<00:02:46.139> hundred

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
seeds from to have over a hundred

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.000 
seeds from to have over a hundred
and<00:02:47.650> now<00:02:48.310> we<00:02:48.370> can<00:02:49.260> pass<00:02:50.260> those<00:02:50.530> on<00:02:50.680> to<00:02:50.709> other

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
and now we can pass those on to other

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.740 
and now we can pass those on to other
people<00:02:51.130> who<00:02:51.400> might<00:02:51.550> need<00:02:51.730> a<00:02:51.760> cover<00:02:52.030> crop<00:02:53.430> this

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
people who might need a cover crop this

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.809 
people who might need a cover crop this
coming<00:02:55.750> summer<00:02:56.020> season<00:02:56.470> where<00:02:57.310> most<00:02:57.610> things

00:02:57.809 --> 00:02:57.819 
coming summer season where most things

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:00.780 
coming summer season where most things
aren't<00:02:58.000> going<00:02:58.150> to<00:02:58.240> grow<00:02:58.390> in<00:02:58.540> this<00:02:59.790> subtropics

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
aren't going to grow in this subtropics

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.220 
aren't going to grow in this subtropics
just<00:03:01.030> keep<00:03:02.020> wave<00:03:02.890> that<00:03:03.790> Miami<00:03:04.090> gets<00:03:04.360> every

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
just keep wave that Miami gets every
