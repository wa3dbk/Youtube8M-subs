00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
to get a MOAB in infected so the green

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.930 
to get a MOAB in infected so the green
section<00:00:13.500> allocates<00:00:14.190> where<00:00:14.490> I'm<00:00:14.580> going<00:00:14.790> to<00:00:14.849> be

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
section allocates where I'm going to be

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.720 
section allocates where I'm going to be
located<00:00:15.570> between<00:00:15.809> the<00:00:16.020> tunnel<00:00:16.529> and<00:00:16.650> the<00:00:16.740> room

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
located between the tunnel and the room

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.330 
located between the tunnel and the room
on<00:00:17.910> the<00:00:18.029> side<00:00:18.270> and<00:00:18.510> the<00:00:18.630> arrows<00:00:19.020> obviously<00:00:20.010> are

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
on the side and the arrows obviously are

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:21.800 
on the side and the arrows obviously are
indicating<00:00:20.939> whether<00:00:21.090> enemies<00:00:21.539> are<00:00:21.630> going<00:00:21.750> to

indicating whether enemies are going to
come<00:00:21.960> from<00:00:22.170> so<00:00:22.410> you<00:00:22.500> basically<00:00:22.650> you<00:00:23.550> basically

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
come from so you basically you basically

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.460 
come from so you basically you basically
got<00:00:24.180> two<00:00:24.449> sections<00:00:24.990> you're<00:00:25.080> going<00:00:25.199> to<00:00:25.260> need<00:00:25.380> to

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
got two sections you're going to need to

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.980 
got two sections you're going to need to
cover<00:00:25.680> and<00:00:26.039> you<00:00:27.029> might<00:00:27.300> have<00:00:27.390> a<00:00:27.480> small<00:00:27.750> chance

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
cover and you might have a small chance

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.359 
cover and you might have a small chance
of<00:00:28.109> them<00:00:28.320> trying<00:00:28.560> to<00:00:28.650> flank<00:00:28.920> you<00:00:29.099> but<00:00:29.279> that's

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
of them trying to flank you but that's

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.700 
of them trying to flank you but that's
kind<00:00:29.820> of<00:00:30.029> unlikely<00:00:30.480> especially<00:00:31.109> if<00:00:31.500> we<00:00:31.560> got

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
kind of unlikely especially if we got

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.260 
kind of unlikely especially if we got
teammates<00:00:32.130> alive<00:00:32.489> by<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:32.700> beginning<00:00:32.880> of<00:00:33.120> the

mobs<00:01:00.570> in<00:01:00.780> infected<00:01:01.320> for<00:01:02.070> different<00:01:02.520> maps

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
mobs in infected for different maps

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.910 
mobs in infected for different maps
because<00:01:03.300> it's<00:01:03.870> a<00:01:03.960> new<00:01:04.110> experience<00:01:04.140> for<00:01:04.739> me<00:01:04.769> and

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
because it's a new experience for me and

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.890 
because it's a new experience for me and
by<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.100> way<00:01:05.250> over<00:01:05.549> there<00:01:05.580> is<00:01:05.880> a<00:01:05.909> spawn<00:01:06.270> point<00:01:06.659> i

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
by the way over there is a spawn point i

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.770 
by the way over there is a spawn point i
mocked<00:01:07.530> it<00:01:07.740> on<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:08.159> picture<00:01:08.610> previously<00:01:09.210> with

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
mocked it on the picture previously with

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.149 
mocked it on the picture previously with
my<00:01:09.960> highly<00:01:10.470> skilled<00:01:11.030> Microsoft<00:01:12.030> Paint<00:01:12.330> skills

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:13.159 
my highly skilled Microsoft Paint skills

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:15.410 
my highly skilled Microsoft Paint skills
so<00:01:14.159> watch<00:01:14.400> out<00:01:14.549> for<00:01:14.610> that<00:01:14.760> spawn<00:01:15.150> point

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
so watch out for that spawn point

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.210 
so watch out for that spawn point
because<00:01:15.720> it<00:01:15.840> infected<00:01:16.439> right<00:01:16.740> you<00:01:16.920> could<00:01:17.100> be

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
because it infected right you could be

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.969 
because it infected right you could be
right<00:01:17.520> next<00:01:17.700> a<00:01:17.939> spawn<00:01:18.570> point<00:01:18.960> and<00:01:19.170> they<00:01:19.770> would

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
right next a spawn point and they would

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.830 
right next a spawn point and they would
spawn<00:01:20.340> there<00:01:20.640> right<00:01:20.909> next<00:01:21.090> to<00:01:21.330> you<00:01:21.450> honestly

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
spawn there right next to you honestly

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.810 
spawn there right next to you honestly
right<00:01:22.170> behind<00:01:22.500> you<00:01:22.740> inside<00:01:23.130> your<00:01:23.310> pocket<00:01:23.520> they

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
right behind you inside your pocket they

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.609 
right behind you inside your pocket they
will<00:01:24.000> spawn<00:01:24.299> an<00:01:24.420> eye<00:01:24.600> for<00:01:24.659> you<00:01:24.900> so<00:01:25.380> you<00:01:25.439> gotta

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
will spawn an eye for you so you gotta

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.219 
will spawn an eye for you so you gotta
be<00:01:25.740> behalf<00:01:26.040> of<00:01:26.070> that<00:01:26.340> now<00:01:27.030> as<00:01:27.750> you<00:01:27.810> see<00:01:28.110> I'm

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
using a PP 90 m this method would be

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.510 
using a PP 90 m this method would be
even<00:02:48.810> easier<00:02:48.960> with<00:02:49.290> a<00:02:49.350> time<00:02:49.590> 95<00:02:50.070> because<00:02:50.370> that

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
even easier with a time 95 because that

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.850 
even easier with a time 95 because that
gun<00:02:50.730> is<00:02:50.880> so<00:02:51.150> good<00:02:51.420> maybe<00:02:51.960> opion<00:02:52.620> a<00:02:52.650> good

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860

using the same technique tunnel and a

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:00.620 
using the same technique tunnel and a
room<00:02:59.520> now<00:02:59.910> things<00:03:00.210> are<00:03:00.330> going<00:03:00.480> to<00:03:00.540> get

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
room now things are going to get

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.440 
room now things are going to get

slightly more hectic now more people are
infected<00:03:03.840> this<00:03:04.230> means<00:03:04.470> more<00:03:04.710> kills<00:03:05.010> and<00:03:05.280> also

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
infected this means more kills and also

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:08.090 
infected this means more kills and also
way<00:03:05.940> more<00:03:05.970> dangerous<00:03:06.420> territory<00:03:07.380> so<00:03:07.860> you<00:03:07.950> got

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
way more dangerous territory so you got

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.250 
way more dangerous territory so you got
