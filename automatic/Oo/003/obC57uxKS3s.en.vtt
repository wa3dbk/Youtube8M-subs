in<00:00:01.469> this<00:00:02.469> tutorial<00:00:02.739> we're<00:00:03.219> going<00:00:03.340> to<00:00:03.429> have<00:00:03.580> a

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:03.610 
in this tutorial we're going to have a

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:06.780 
in this tutorial we're going to have a
look<00:00:03.820> at<00:00:04.060> compression<00:00:04.870> on<00:00:05.019> bass<00:00:05.259> guitar<00:00:05.790> bass

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:06.790 
look at compression on bass guitar bass

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:08.099 
look at compression on bass guitar bass
guitar<00:00:07.149> is<00:00:07.270> probably<00:00:07.419> a<00:00:07.629> really<00:00:07.779> good<00:00:07.959> example

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:08.109 
guitar is probably a really good example

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:10.859 
guitar is probably a really good example
of<00:00:08.590> why<00:00:08.799> you<00:00:08.830> need<00:00:09.040> compression<00:00:09.969> because<00:00:10.750> it

00:00:10.859 --> 00:00:10.869 
of why you need compression because it

00:00:10.869 --> 00:00:12.779 
of why you need compression because it
needs<00:00:11.080> to<00:00:11.320> be<00:00:11.440> really<00:00:11.799> solid<00:00:12.100> because<00:00:12.549> often

00:00:12.779 --> 00:00:12.789 
needs to be really solid because often

00:00:12.789 --> 00:00:14.519 
needs to be really solid because often
it's<00:00:12.940> the<00:00:13.090> backbone<00:00:13.539> of<00:00:13.570> the<00:00:13.869> track<00:00:14.170> along

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:14.529 
it's the backbone of the track along

00:00:14.529 --> 00:00:16.680 
it's the backbone of the track along
with<00:00:14.709> the<00:00:14.799> drums<00:00:15.129> and<00:00:15.430> it<00:00:16.059> can<00:00:16.180> also<00:00:16.330> have<00:00:16.660> a

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:16.690 
with the drums and it can also have a

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:19.140 
with the drums and it can also have a
tendency<00:00:17.380> to<00:00:17.529> be<00:00:17.679> quite<00:00:18.009> inconsistent<00:00:18.550> with<00:00:19.119> a

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:19.150 
tendency to be quite inconsistent with a

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:21.179 
tendency to be quite inconsistent with a
lot<00:00:19.359> of<00:00:19.480> variation<00:00:20.050> in<00:00:20.140> level<00:00:20.499> and<00:00:20.679> you<00:00:21.070> can

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:21.189 
lot of variation in level and you can

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:22.589 
lot of variation in level and you can
see<00:00:21.369> just<00:00:21.400> by<00:00:21.669> looking<00:00:21.789> at<00:00:22.179> this<00:00:22.330> waveform

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:22.599 
see just by looking at this waveform

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:24.689 
see just by looking at this waveform
here<00:00:23.109> there<00:00:23.259> is<00:00:23.410> quite<00:00:23.679> a<00:00:23.710> lot<00:00:23.919> of<00:00:24.070> variation

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:24.699 
here there is quite a lot of variation

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:26.730 
here there is quite a lot of variation
in<00:00:24.849> the<00:00:24.939> dynamics<00:00:25.509> and<00:00:25.839> while<00:00:26.199> that<00:00:26.320> can<00:00:26.560> be<00:00:26.710> a

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:26.740 
in the dynamics and while that can be a

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:28.679 
in the dynamics and while that can be a
good<00:00:26.980> thing<00:00:27.039> you<00:00:27.579> need<00:00:27.759> to<00:00:27.909> make<00:00:28.060> sure<00:00:28.089> all<00:00:28.509> the

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:28.689 
good thing you need to make sure all the

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:30.720 
good thing you need to make sure all the
notes<00:00:28.900> are<00:00:29.169> heard<00:00:29.529> so<00:00:30.009> that<00:00:30.159> the<00:00:30.310> bass<00:00:30.460> line

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:30.730 
notes are heard so that the bass line

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:32.670 
notes are heard so that the bass line
could<00:00:30.939> stay<00:00:31.150> solid<00:00:31.630> and<00:00:31.810> compression<00:00:32.500> can

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:32.680 
could stay solid and compression can

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:43.740 
could stay solid and compression can
help<00:00:32.920> with<00:00:33.100> that<00:00:33.330> so<00:00:34.330> let's<00:00:34.360> have<00:00:34.660> a<00:00:34.720> listen<00:00:42.750> so

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:43.750 
help with that so let's have a listen so

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:45.510 
help with that so let's have a listen so
you<00:00:43.810> can<00:00:44.020> hear<00:00:44.260> the<00:00:44.410> variation<00:00:44.980> in<00:00:45.100> the<00:00:45.190> levels

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:45.520 
you can hear the variation in the levels

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.580 
you can hear the variation in the levels
there<00:00:45.760> some<00:00:46.150> notes<00:00:46.390> are<00:00:46.630> coming<00:00:46.990> through<00:00:47.170> more

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:47.590 
there some notes are coming through more

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:49.680 
there some notes are coming through more
than<00:00:47.620> others<00:00:48.130> so<00:00:48.850> we'll<00:00:49.000> start<00:00:49.210> off<00:00:49.330> just<00:00:49.540> as

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:49.690 
than others so we'll start off just as

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:52.140 
than others so we'll start off just as
we<00:00:49.840> have<00:00:50.020> throughout<00:00:50.380> the<00:00:50.560> chapter<00:00:50.980> so<00:00:51.160> far<00:00:51.490> to

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:52.150 
we have throughout the chapter so far to

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:53.730 
we have throughout the chapter so far to
start<00:00:52.450> by<00:00:52.600> pulling<00:00:52.810> the<00:00:53.020> threshold<00:00:53.530> down

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:53.740 
start by pulling the threshold down

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:56.010 
start by pulling the threshold down
until<00:00:54.100> it<00:00:54.190> starts<00:00:54.550> to<00:00:54.610> compress<00:00:55.000> and<00:00:55.870> that

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:56.020 
until it starts to compress and that

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:57.180 
until it starts to compress and that
straightaway<00:00:56.500> gives<00:00:56.740> us<00:00:56.890> a<00:00:56.920> bit<00:00:57.160> more

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:57.190 
straightaway gives us a bit more

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.870 
straightaway gives us a bit more
Headroom<00:00:57.760> so<00:00:57.790> we<00:00:58.060> can<00:00:58.240> turn<00:00:58.450> up<00:00:58.600> the<00:00:58.630> gain<00:00:59.880> and

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:00.880 
Headroom so we can turn up the gain and

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.790 
Headroom so we can turn up the gain and
that's<00:01:01.330> already<00:01:01.600> made<00:01:01.840> a<00:01:01.900> difference<00:01:02.110> the

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:02.800 
that's already made a difference the

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.619 
that's already made a difference the
levels<00:01:03.100> are<00:01:03.220> already<00:01:03.370> much<00:01:03.700> more<00:01:03.730> even<00:01:04.390> but<00:01:04.540> we

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:04.629 
levels are already much more even but we

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:06.389 
levels are already much more even but we
can<00:01:04.780> try<00:01:04.960> turning<00:01:05.170> the<00:01:05.439> ratio<00:01:05.799> up<00:01:05.950> a<00:01:06.070> bit<00:01:06.249> more

00:01:06.389 --> 00:01:06.399 
can try turning the ratio up a bit more

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:08.279 
can try turning the ratio up a bit more
I<00:01:06.670> think<00:01:07.149> a<00:01:07.210> lot<00:01:07.359> of<00:01:07.450> the<00:01:07.509> time<00:01:07.719> with<00:01:07.840> bass<00:01:08.020> you

00:01:08.279 --> 00:01:08.289 
I think a lot of the time with bass you

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:09.899 
I think a lot of the time with bass you
probably<00:01:08.590> want<00:01:08.799> some<00:01:09.009> of<00:01:09.100> the<00:01:09.189> natural<00:01:09.369> attack

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:09.909 
probably want some of the natural attack

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:11.370 
probably want some of the natural attack
to<00:01:10.119> come<00:01:10.299> through<00:01:10.630> so<00:01:10.659> you<00:01:10.869> don't<00:01:11.079> want<00:01:11.259> the

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:11.380 
to come through so you don't want the

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.830 
to come through so you don't want the
attack<00:01:11.649> time<00:01:11.920> to<00:01:12.100> be<00:01:12.219> too<00:01:12.460> quick<00:01:12.789> if<00:01:13.479> you<00:01:13.600> do

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:13.840 
attack time to be too quick if you do

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.359 
attack time to be too quick if you do
give<00:01:14.049> it<00:01:14.079> a<00:01:14.229> quick<00:01:14.409> attack<00:01:14.799> time<00:01:15.070> then<00:01:15.340> that

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:15.369 
give it a quick attack time then that

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:16.889 
give it a quick attack time then that
will<00:01:15.579> give<00:01:15.729> you<00:01:15.850> a<00:01:15.909> little<00:01:16.090> bit<00:01:16.270> more<00:01:16.420> Headroom

00:01:16.889 --> 00:01:16.899 
will give you a little bit more Headroom

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:19.109 
will give you a little bit more Headroom
because<00:01:17.200> it'll<00:01:17.409> squash<00:01:17.740> those<00:01:18.039> transients<00:01:18.999> at

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:19.119 
because it'll squash those transients at

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:21.029 
because it'll squash those transients at
the<00:01:19.240> start<00:01:19.539> but<00:01:19.929> it<00:01:19.990> will<00:01:20.170> also<00:01:20.319> make<00:01:20.649> it<00:01:20.710> sound

00:01:21.029 --> 00:01:21.039 
the start but it will also make it sound

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:23.489 
the start but it will also make it sound
more<00:01:21.219> compressed<00:01:21.810> but<00:01:22.810> as<00:01:22.990> is<00:01:23.200> always<00:01:23.380> the

00:01:23.489 --> 00:01:23.499 
more compressed but as is always the

00:01:23.499 --> 00:01:25.440 
more compressed but as is always the
case<00:01:23.619> a<00:01:23.829> lot<00:01:24.159> of<00:01:24.280> this<00:01:24.399> is<00:01:24.579> subjective<00:01:25.179> you<00:01:25.329> may

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:25.450 
case a lot of this is subjective you may

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.450 
case a lot of this is subjective you may
actually<00:01:25.689> like<00:01:26.170> that<00:01:26.409> compressed<00:01:26.890> sound<00:01:27.159> I

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.460 
actually like that compressed sound I

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.370 
actually like that compressed sound I
actually<00:01:27.909> don't<00:01:28.240> mind<00:01:28.390> the<00:01:28.689> bass<00:01:28.869> sounding<00:01:29.319> a

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:29.380 
actually don't mind the bass sounding a

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.440 
actually don't mind the bass sounding a
bit<00:01:29.409> compressed<00:01:29.920> I<00:01:30.369> think<00:01:31.060> it<00:01:31.149> holds<00:01:31.270> it

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:31.450 
bit compressed I think it holds it

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:32.999 
bit compressed I think it holds it
together<00:01:31.569> quite<00:01:31.990> nicely<00:01:32.259> makes<00:01:32.679> it<00:01:32.829> sound

00:01:32.999 --> 00:01:33.009 
together quite nicely makes it sound

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:36.059 
together quite nicely makes it sound
more<00:01:33.130> solid<00:01:33.639> and<00:01:33.759> quite<00:01:33.969> punchy<00:01:34.799> but<00:01:35.799> even

00:01:36.059 --> 00:01:36.069 
more solid and quite punchy but even

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:37.770 
more solid and quite punchy but even
still<00:01:36.310> in<00:01:36.429> this<00:01:36.579> case<00:01:36.819> I<00:01:37.030> think<00:01:37.090> a<00:01:37.389> bit<00:01:37.569> of<00:01:37.600> the

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:37.780 
still in this case I think a bit of the

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.539 
still in this case I think a bit of the
natural<00:01:38.170> attack<00:01:38.499> it<00:01:38.740> still<00:01:39.009> sounds<00:01:39.369> better

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:39.549 
natural attack it still sounds better

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:41.489 
natural attack it still sounds better
but<00:01:40.210> that<00:01:40.329> does<00:01:40.509> make<00:01:40.719> it<00:01:40.869> a<00:01:40.929> bit<00:01:41.079> more<00:01:41.109> likely

00:01:41.489 --> 00:01:41.499 
but that does make it a bit more likely

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:43.559 
but that does make it a bit more likely
to<00:01:41.799> clip<00:01:42.100> so<00:01:42.549> we<00:01:42.639> might<00:01:42.819> want<00:01:43.030> to<00:01:43.090> use<00:01:43.299> a

00:01:43.559 --> 00:01:43.569 
to clip so we might want to use a

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:45.929 
to clip so we might want to use a
limiter<00:01:44.109> to<00:01:44.259> deal<00:01:44.439> with<00:01:44.590> that<00:01:44.799> give<00:01:45.490> it<00:01:45.609> a<00:01:45.670> fast

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:45.939 
limiter to deal with that give it a fast

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:48.090 
limiter to deal with that give it a fast
attack<00:01:46.209> time<00:01:46.689> to<00:01:46.869> catch<00:01:47.079> the<00:01:47.319> peaks<00:01:47.590> and<00:01:47.889> I

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
attack time to catch the peaks and I

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.469 
attack time to catch the peaks and I
also<00:01:48.249> find<00:01:48.520> it's<00:01:48.729> an<00:01:48.819> idea<00:01:49.090> to<00:01:49.179> pull<00:01:49.359> the

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:49.479 
also find it's an idea to pull the

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:51.989 
also find it's an idea to pull the
threshold<00:01:49.959> down<00:01:50.020> slightly<00:01:50.679> under<00:01:51.219> zero<00:01:51.459> just

00:01:51.989 --> 00:01:51.999 
threshold down slightly under zero just

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:53.609 
threshold down slightly under zero just
because<00:01:52.359> if<00:01:52.810> you<00:01:52.990> leave<00:01:53.139> it<00:01:53.259> on<00:01:53.319> zero

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:53.619 
because if you leave it on zero

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:57.380 
because if you leave it on zero
sometimes<00:01:53.979> it<00:01:54.399> still<00:01:54.670> can<00:01:54.909> clip

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.639 

think<00:01:58.390> for<00:01:58.540> this<00:01:58.630> baseline<00:01:59.170> we<00:01:59.320> want<00:01:59.530> the

00:01:59.639 --> 00:01:59.649 
think for this baseline we want the

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:02.429 
think for this baseline we want the
release<00:01:59.950> to<00:02:00.219> be<00:02:00.250> a<00:02:00.549> bit<00:02:00.789> longer<00:02:01.060> because<00:02:02.020> we<00:02:02.229> do

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:02.439 
release to be a bit longer because we do

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:04.319 
release to be a bit longer because we do
have<00:02:02.590> some<00:02:02.829> longer<00:02:03.039> sustaining<00:02:03.759> notes<00:02:03.969> and

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:04.329 
have some longer sustaining notes and

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:06.719 
have some longer sustaining notes and
that<00:02:05.020> just<00:02:05.229> helps<00:02:05.500> us<00:02:05.619> to<00:02:05.770> even<00:02:06.130> out<00:02:06.280> the<00:02:06.310> level

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:06.729 
that just helps us to even out the level

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:09.210 
that just helps us to even out the level
for<00:02:06.970> a<00:02:07.000> longer<00:02:07.329> amount<00:02:07.420> of<00:02:07.689> time<00:02:07.769> if<00:02:08.769> we<00:02:09.009> bring

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
for a longer amount of time if we bring

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.100 
for a longer amount of time if we bring
the<00:02:09.340> release<00:02:09.640> down<00:02:09.940> that<00:02:10.810> can<00:02:10.959> actually

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
the release down that can actually

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.050 
the release down that can actually
create<00:02:11.410> quite<00:02:11.769> a<00:02:11.830> nice<00:02:12.069> effect<00:02:12.280> it<00:02:12.670> brings<00:02:12.880> out

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
create quite a nice effect it brings out

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.089 
create quite a nice effect it brings out
some<00:02:13.269> of<00:02:13.360> the<00:02:13.420> personality<00:02:14.140> of<00:02:14.170> the<00:02:14.380> room<00:02:14.650> that

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:15.099 
some of the personality of the room that

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:16.890 
some of the personality of the room that
the<00:02:15.220> bass<00:02:15.370> was<00:02:15.580> recorded<00:02:16.120> in<00:02:16.269> because<00:02:16.780> as

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
the bass was recorded in because as

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.050 
the bass was recorded in because as
we've<00:02:17.110> seen<00:02:17.260> in<00:02:17.440> other<00:02:17.530> tutorials<00:02:18.280> a<00:02:18.519> faster

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
we've seen in other tutorials a faster

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:20.759 
we've seen in other tutorials a faster
release<00:02:19.209> time<00:02:19.599> is<00:02:19.630> basically<00:02:20.260> bringing<00:02:20.530> up

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:20.769 
release time is basically bringing up

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:22.530 
release time is basically bringing up
the<00:02:20.920> quieter<00:02:21.340> part<00:02:21.489> of<00:02:21.640> the<00:02:21.730> recording<00:02:22.209> so

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
the quieter part of the recording so

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:23.699 
the quieter part of the recording so
we're<00:02:22.660> getting<00:02:22.870> a<00:02:22.959> bit<00:02:23.080> of<00:02:23.110> the<00:02:23.319> natural

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 
we're getting a bit of the natural

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:25.710 
we're getting a bit of the natural
reverb<00:02:23.950> from<00:02:24.580> the<00:02:24.700> room<00:02:24.910> that<00:02:25.150> the<00:02:25.239> bass<00:02:25.420> amp

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
reverb from the room that the bass amp

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.930 
reverb from the room that the bass amp
was<00:02:25.900> recorded<00:02:26.410> in<00:02:26.560> but<00:02:27.190> as<00:02:27.310> we've<00:02:27.489> also<00:02:27.640> seen

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
was recorded in but as we've also seen

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.000 
was recorded in but as we've also seen
in<00:02:28.120> other<00:02:28.269> tutorials<00:02:28.900> the<00:02:29.530> longer<00:02:29.830> notes

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
in other tutorials the longer notes

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:31.470 
in other tutorials the longer notes
don't<00:02:30.280> tend<00:02:30.519> to<00:02:30.580> sound<00:02:30.819> so<00:02:31.030> good<00:02:31.269> with<00:02:31.450> a

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
don't tend to sound so good with a

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.330 
don't tend to sound so good with a
shorter<00:02:31.870> release<00:02:32.140> time<00:02:32.440> so<00:02:32.890> I'll<00:02:32.980> turn<00:02:33.220> it

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
shorter release time so I'll turn it

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.960 
shorter release time so I'll turn it
back<00:02:33.370> up<00:02:33.489> a<00:02:33.760> bit

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
back up a bit

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.270 
back up a bit
so<00:02:34.930> I<00:02:34.959> think<00:02:35.200> this<00:02:35.319> is<00:02:35.470> pretty<00:02:35.620> good<00:02:35.860> it<00:02:35.980> evens

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
so I think this is pretty good it evens

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:37.949 
so I think this is pretty good it evens
out<00:02:36.400> the<00:02:36.549> level<00:02:36.849> without<00:02:36.940> making<00:02:37.690> it<00:02:37.780> sound

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
out the level without making it sound

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:40.050 
out the level without making it sound
too<00:02:38.230> over<00:02:38.530> compressed<00:02:39.010> but<00:02:39.340> as<00:02:39.459> always<00:02:39.790> check

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
too over compressed but as always check

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.300 
too over compressed but as always check
it<00:02:40.510> in<00:02:40.599> the<00:02:40.720> mix<00:02:40.930> and<00:02:41.200> make<00:02:41.500> sure<00:02:41.739> that<00:02:41.920> it<00:02:42.040> fits

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
it in the mix and make sure that it fits

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.100 
it in the mix and make sure that it fits
with<00:02:42.519> whatever<00:02:42.730> you're<00:02:43.000> mixing<00:02:43.330> it<00:02:43.420> with<00:02:43.599> in

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
with whatever you're mixing it with in

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:45.750 
with whatever you're mixing it with in
the<00:02:44.200> case<00:02:44.380> of<00:02:44.590> bass<00:02:44.769> that's<00:02:45.040> been<00:02:45.250> played<00:02:45.519> with

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
the case of bass that's been played with

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.789 
the case of bass that's been played with
a<00:02:45.790> pick<00:02:46.150> then<00:02:46.780> the<00:02:46.900> attack<00:02:47.200> will<00:02:47.440> be<00:02:47.470> a<00:02:47.560> lot

00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:47.799 
a pick then the attack will be a lot

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:49.979 
a pick then the attack will be a lot
sharper<00:02:48.099> and<00:02:48.670> you<00:02:49.090> can<00:02:49.239> even<00:02:49.390> see<00:02:49.630> just<00:02:49.870> by

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
sharper and you can even see just by

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:51.449 
sharper and you can even see just by
looking<00:02:50.319> at<00:02:50.380> the<00:02:50.500> waveform<00:02:50.680> that<00:02:51.069> there's<00:02:51.370> a

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
looking at the waveform that there's a

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:53.250 
looking at the waveform that there's a
lot<00:02:51.579> of<00:02:51.610> sharp<00:02:52.239> peaks<00:02:52.569> at<00:02:52.750> the<00:02:52.840> beginning<00:02:53.170> of

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
lot of sharp peaks at the beginning of

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:54.960 
lot of sharp peaks at the beginning of
each<00:02:53.349> note<00:02:53.709> so<00:02:54.220> the<00:02:54.340> sound<00:02:54.579> of<00:02:54.700> the<00:02:54.790> pick

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
each note so the sound of the pick

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:56.940 
each note so the sound of the pick
actually<00:02:55.239> adds<00:02:55.690> a<00:02:55.900> lot<00:02:56.049> to<00:02:56.110> the<00:02:56.260> attack<00:02:56.680> of<00:02:56.709> the

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
actually adds a lot to the attack of the

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:58.979 
actually adds a lot to the attack of the
note<00:02:57.220> but<00:02:57.849> aside<00:02:58.090> from<00:02:58.150> that<00:02:58.360> the<00:02:58.510> levels

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989 
note but aside from that the levels

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:01.199 
note but aside from that the levels
aren't<00:02:59.140> too<00:02:59.470> bad<00:02:59.769> but<00:03:00.489> there<00:03:00.610> is<00:03:00.760> quite<00:03:00.970> a<00:03:01.000> lot

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
aren't too bad but there is quite a lot

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:03.059 
aren't too bad but there is quite a lot
of<00:03:01.239> variation<00:03:01.630> in<00:03:02.049> levels<00:03:02.470> so<00:03:02.709> it<00:03:02.920> could

00:03:03.059 --> 00:03:03.069 
of variation in levels so it could

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:04.740 
of variation in levels so it could
definitely<00:03:03.250> do<00:03:03.760> with<00:03:03.910> some<00:03:04.090> compression<00:03:04.630> to

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
definitely do with some compression to

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.330 
definitely do with some compression to
make<00:03:04.900> sure<00:03:05.109> all<00:03:05.290> the<00:03:05.410> notes<00:03:05.620> are<00:03:05.829> heard

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
make sure all the notes are heard

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.099 
make sure all the notes are heard
so<00:03:06.700> these<00:03:07.030> settings<00:03:07.450> will<00:03:07.569> probably<00:03:07.840> be<00:03:07.959> much

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:08.109 
so these settings will probably be much

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:10.410 
so these settings will probably be much
the<00:03:08.140> same<00:03:08.319> as<00:03:08.650> the<00:03:08.799> last<00:03:08.920> baseline<00:03:09.519> just<00:03:10.239> pull

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
the same as the last baseline just pull

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:11.880 
the same as the last baseline just pull
down<00:03:10.600> the<00:03:10.750> threshold<00:03:11.200> till<00:03:11.410> it<00:03:11.530> starts

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
down the threshold till it starts

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.520 
down the threshold till it starts
compressing<00:03:12.519> then<00:03:12.700> increase<00:03:13.180> the<00:03:13.209> gain<00:03:13.600> and

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
compressing then increase the gain and

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.349 
compressing then increase the gain and
you<00:03:14.560> can<00:03:14.799> see<00:03:14.980> this<00:03:15.190> meter<00:03:15.430> here<00:03:15.760> indicating

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:16.359 
you can see this meter here indicating

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:18.780 
you can see this meter here indicating
that<00:03:16.389> we're<00:03:16.630> getting<00:03:16.900> up<00:03:17.109> to<00:03:17.560> around<00:03:17.859> 6<00:03:18.310> DB<00:03:18.760> of

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
that we're getting up to around 6 DB of

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.599 
that we're getting up to around 6 DB of
reduction<00:03:19.530> and<00:03:20.530> as<00:03:20.709> the<00:03:20.889> levels<00:03:21.160> weren't<00:03:21.340> all

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:21.609 
reduction and as the levels weren't all

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:23.099 
reduction and as the levels weren't all
over<00:03:21.970> the<00:03:22.090> place<00:03:22.269> that's<00:03:22.510> done<00:03:22.690> a<00:03:22.720> pretty<00:03:22.989> good

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:23.109 
over the place that's done a pretty good

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:25.020 
over the place that's done a pretty good
job<00:03:23.260> of<00:03:23.470> evening<00:03:23.950> it<00:03:24.069> out<00:03:24.220> but<00:03:24.579> we<00:03:24.670> are<00:03:24.819> still

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
job of evening it out but we are still

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.000 
job of evening it out but we are still
getting<00:03:25.180> some<00:03:25.450> overs<00:03:25.810> here<00:03:26.079> so<00:03:26.440> as<00:03:26.560> I<00:03:26.680> said<00:03:26.859> the

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
getting some overs here so as I said the

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:28.590 
getting some overs here so as I said the
sound<00:03:27.280> of<00:03:27.400> the<00:03:27.459> peak<00:03:27.700> has<00:03:27.910> added<00:03:28.209> a<00:03:28.269> lot<00:03:28.420> to<00:03:28.450> the

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:28.600 
sound of the peak has added a lot to the

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.050 
sound of the peak has added a lot to the
attack<00:03:29.019> of<00:03:29.200> each<00:03:29.319> note<00:03:29.650> so<00:03:30.040> we<00:03:30.519> can<00:03:30.700> control

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
attack of each note so we can control

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.509 
attack of each note so we can control
that<00:03:31.120> by<00:03:31.480> using<00:03:31.720> the<00:03:31.930> attack<00:03:32.230> control<00:03:32.620> if<00:03:33.190> you

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:33.519 
that by using the attack control if you

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:35.280 
that by using the attack control if you
want<00:03:33.700> them<00:03:33.850> to<00:03:33.970> come<00:03:34.180> through<00:03:34.209> then<00:03:34.750> just

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
want them to come through then just

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.470 
want them to come through then just
leave<00:03:35.500> the<00:03:35.680> attack<00:03:35.980> a<00:03:36.010> bit<00:03:36.340> higher<00:03:36.579> then<00:03:37.389> we

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
leave the attack a bit higher then we

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:38.849 
leave the attack a bit higher then we
could<00:03:37.660> use<00:03:37.810> a<00:03:37.840> limiter<00:03:38.319> to<00:03:38.350> deal<00:03:38.620> with<00:03:38.769> the

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:38.859 
could use a limiter to deal with the

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:40.860 
could use a limiter to deal with the
peaks<00:03:39.100> like<00:03:39.310> we<00:03:39.489> did<00:03:39.639> before<00:03:39.790> or<00:03:40.420> you<00:03:40.660> could

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
peaks like we did before or you could

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:42.660 
peaks like we did before or you could
give<00:03:41.079> it<00:03:41.170> a<00:03:41.230> faster<00:03:41.709> attack<00:03:41.799> time<00:03:42.280> and<00:03:42.549> then

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670 
give it a faster attack time and then

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:44.550 
give it a faster attack time and then
try<00:03:42.940> and<00:03:42.970> tame<00:03:43.359> some<00:03:43.630> of<00:03:43.780> those<00:03:43.900> Peaks<00:03:44.200> a<00:03:44.380> bit

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
try and tame some of those Peaks a bit

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.259 
try and tame some of those Peaks a bit
and<00:03:44.799> that'll<00:03:45.280> help<00:03:45.400> with<00:03:45.489> the<00:03:45.639> clipping<00:03:46.090> I

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:46.269 
and that'll help with the clipping I

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:48.059 
and that'll help with the clipping I
don't<00:03:47.019> mean<00:03:47.139> we<00:03:47.319> don't<00:03:47.470> need<00:03:47.709> to<00:03:47.859> use<00:03:48.040> a

00:03:48.059 --> 00:03:48.069 
don't mean we don't need to use a

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:50.220 
don't mean we don't need to use a
limiter<00:03:48.609> and<00:03:49.329> it'll<00:03:49.540> also<00:03:49.660> give<00:03:49.959> us<00:03:50.049> a<00:03:50.109> bit

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 
limiter and it'll also give us a bit

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.039 
limiter and it'll also give us a bit
more<00:03:50.260> Headroom<00:03:50.880> and<00:03:51.880> you<00:03:52.420> can<00:03:52.569> hear<00:03:52.720> it<00:03:52.810> hasn't

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:53.049 
more Headroom and you can hear it hasn't

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:55.440 
more Headroom and you can hear it hasn't
actually<00:03:53.170> taken<00:03:53.709> it<00:03:53.799> away<00:03:53.980> too<00:03:54.040> much<00:03:54.459> the

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450 
actually taken it away too much the

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:57.270 
actually taken it away too much the
brightness<00:03:55.930> of<00:03:56.079> the<00:03:56.200> pick<00:03:56.380> sound<00:03:56.680> still<00:03:56.980> comes

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 
brightness of the pick sound still comes

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.759 
brightness of the pick sound still comes
through<00:03:57.599> but<00:03:58.599> you<00:03:58.690> really<00:03:58.989> need<00:03:59.139> to<00:03:59.319> try<00:03:59.560> it<00:03:59.590> in

00:03:59.759 --> 00:03:59.769 
through but you really need to try it in

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:01.559 
through but you really need to try it in
the<00:03:59.889> mix<00:04:00.099> to<00:04:00.340> see<00:04:00.549> how<00:04:00.730> well<00:04:00.940> it<00:04:00.970> still<00:04:01.299> cuts

00:04:01.559 --> 00:04:01.569 
the mix to see how well it still cuts

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:03.900 
the mix to see how well it still cuts
through<00:04:02.130> depending<00:04:03.130> on<00:04:03.250> what<00:04:03.400> you're<00:04:03.549> mixing

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:03.910 
through depending on what you're mixing

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:05.610 
through depending on what you're mixing
it<00:04:04.030> with<00:04:04.180> you<00:04:04.810> might<00:04:04.989> find<00:04:05.259> when<00:04:05.380> you<00:04:05.500> bring

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
it with you might find when you bring

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.480 
it with you might find when you bring
the<00:04:05.769> other<00:04:05.799> instruments<00:04:06.489> back<00:04:06.669> in

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:07.490 
the other instruments back in

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:09.640 
the other instruments back in
doesn't<00:04:07.820> cut<00:04:08.000> through<00:04:08.330> so<00:04:08.540> well<00:04:08.720> anymore<00:04:08.870> and

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:09.650 
doesn't cut through so well anymore and

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:11.740 
doesn't cut through so well anymore and
maybe<00:04:09.800> gets<00:04:10.100> lost<00:04:10.340> in<00:04:10.580> the<00:04:10.670> mix<00:04:10.910> because<00:04:11.420> those

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750 
maybe gets lost in the mix because those

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:13.510 
maybe gets lost in the mix because those
pick<00:04:11.990> sounds<00:04:12.350> can't<00:04:12.560> help<00:04:12.770> it<00:04:12.890> to<00:04:12.980> cut<00:04:13.160> through

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:13.520 
pick sounds can't help it to cut through

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:15.340 
pick sounds can't help it to cut through
so<00:04:13.940> if<00:04:14.030> you<00:04:14.150> do<00:04:14.270> find<00:04:14.540> that<00:04:14.630> happens<00:04:15.110> you<00:04:15.230> could

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:15.350 
so if you do find that happens you could

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:16.990 
so if you do find that happens you could
just<00:04:15.560> try<00:04:15.740> a<00:04:15.770> higher<00:04:16.040> attack<00:04:16.400> time<00:04:16.670> and<00:04:16.880> then

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:17.000 
just try a higher attack time and then

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.580 
just try a higher attack time and then
use<00:04:17.209> a<00:04:17.239> limiter<00:04:17.750> to<00:04:17.780> deal<00:04:18.080> with<00:04:18.230> the<00:04:18.320> peaks

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
use a limiter to deal with the peaks

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:21.190 
use a limiter to deal with the peaks
with<00:04:19.459> slap<00:04:19.790> bass<00:04:20.060> you<00:04:20.420> might<00:04:20.600> find<00:04:20.870> that<00:04:21.080> a

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:21.200 
with slap bass you might find that a

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.890 
with slap bass you might find that a
compressor<00:04:21.920> is<00:04:22.070> a<00:04:22.100> lot<00:04:22.490> more<00:04:22.670> necessary<00:04:23.330> you

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:23.900 
compressor is a lot more necessary you

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:25.270 
compressor is a lot more necessary you
can<00:04:23.930> see<00:04:24.260> just<00:04:24.440> by<00:04:24.620> looking<00:04:24.650> at<00:04:25.040> the<00:04:25.130> waveform

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280 
can see just by looking at the waveform

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.040 
can see just by looking at the waveform
here<00:04:25.670> that<00:04:25.970> there<00:04:26.150> is<00:04:26.180> a<00:04:26.300> lot<00:04:26.600> of<00:04:26.720> difference

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.050 
here that there is a lot of difference

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:28.750 
here that there is a lot of difference
between<00:04:27.110> the<00:04:27.500> highest<00:04:27.710> and<00:04:28.070> lowest<00:04:28.100> points

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:28.760 
between the highest and lowest points

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:30.670 
between the highest and lowest points
with<00:04:29.180> these<00:04:29.360> really<00:04:29.690> sharp<00:04:30.020> Peaks<00:04:30.380> in<00:04:30.590> the

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680 
with these really sharp Peaks in the

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.470 
with these really sharp Peaks in the
attack<00:04:31.010> of<00:04:31.040> the<00:04:31.220> notes<00:04:31.520> and<00:04:31.880> you<00:04:32.270> probably

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:32.480 
attack of the notes and you probably

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.570 
attack of the notes and you probably
find<00:04:32.780> that<00:04:32.870> with<00:04:33.080> any<00:04:33.230> slap<00:04:33.590> bass<00:04:33.830> but<00:04:34.220> in<00:04:34.430> this

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:34.580 
find that with any slap bass but in this

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:36.220 
find that with any slap bass but in this
case<00:04:34.850> it's<00:04:35.210> possible<00:04:35.450> that<00:04:35.870> it's<00:04:36.050> more

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:36.230 
case it's possible that it's more

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:38.020 
case it's possible that it's more
extreme<00:04:36.650> because<00:04:36.680> it<00:04:37.100> was<00:04:37.250> recorded<00:04:37.850> with<00:04:37.970> the

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:38.030 
extreme because it was recorded with the

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:40.060 
extreme because it was recorded with the
DI<00:04:38.210> bass<00:04:38.630> because<00:04:39.380> there's<00:04:39.530> no<00:04:39.650> ample

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:40.070 
DI bass because there's no ample

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:41.530 
DI bass because there's no ample
speakers<00:04:40.490> to<00:04:40.640> take<00:04:40.880> away<00:04:41.120> some<00:04:41.360> of<00:04:41.390> those

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:41.540 
speakers to take away some of those

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:43.090 
speakers to take away some of those
higher<00:04:41.840> frequencies<00:04:42.530> and<00:04:42.680> a<00:04:42.740> lot<00:04:42.890> of<00:04:42.920> these

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:43.100 
higher frequencies and a lot of these

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:44.410 
higher frequencies and a lot of these
Peaks<00:04:43.400> will<00:04:43.610> be<00:04:43.790> in<00:04:43.970> those<00:04:44.120> higher

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:44.420 
Peaks will be in those higher

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:46.600 
Peaks will be in those higher
frequencies<00:04:45.140> but<00:04:45.740> whatever<00:04:46.100> the<00:04:46.280> reason

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:46.610 
frequencies but whatever the reason

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:48.340 
frequencies but whatever the reason
these<00:04:46.760> Peaks<00:04:47.090> are<00:04:47.270> quite<00:04:47.480> extreme<00:04:47.900> so<00:04:48.110> we<00:04:48.230> do

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:48.350 
these Peaks are quite extreme so we do

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:49.900 
these Peaks are quite extreme so we do
need<00:04:48.560> to<00:04:48.590> tame<00:04:48.950> them<00:04:49.190> if<00:04:49.310> we<00:04:49.430> want<00:04:49.700> to<00:04:49.760> get<00:04:49.880> a

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:49.910 
need to tame them if we want to get a

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:55.750 
need to tame them if we want to get a
bit<00:04:50.090> more<00:04:50.210> gain<00:04:50.450> out<00:04:50.750> of<00:04:50.870> this<00:04:54.520> so<00:04:55.520> you<00:04:55.550> can

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:55.760 
bit more gain out of this so you can

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:57.280 
bit more gain out of this so you can
hear<00:04:55.940> a<00:04:55.970> lot<00:04:56.150> of<00:04:56.210> the<00:04:56.360> notes<00:04:56.570> themselves<00:04:56.810> are

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:57.290 
hear a lot of the notes themselves are

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:59.170 
hear a lot of the notes themselves are
getting<00:04:57.590> lost<00:04:57.800> or<00:04:58.040> most<00:04:58.250> of<00:04:58.400> what<00:04:58.580> we<00:04:58.730> can<00:04:58.850> hear

00:04:59.170 --> 00:04:59.180 
getting lost or most of what we can hear

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:01.210 
getting lost or most of what we can hear
is<00:04:59.300> those<00:04:59.540> percussive<00:05:00.230> sort<00:05:00.500> of<00:05:00.590> sounds<00:05:01.070> from

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:01.220 
is those percussive sort of sounds from

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:06.520 
is those percussive sort of sounds from
the<00:05:01.370> attack<00:05:04.870> so<00:05:05.870> we'll<00:05:05.990> start<00:05:06.200> the<00:05:06.320> same<00:05:06.500> way

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:06.530 
the attack so we'll start the same way

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:09.490 
the attack so we'll start the same way
pull<00:05:06.950> down<00:05:07.160> the<00:05:07.310> threshold<00:05:08.350> increase<00:05:09.350> the

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:09.500 
pull down the threshold increase the

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:11.800 
pull down the threshold increase the
gain<00:05:10.150> and<00:05:11.150> you<00:05:11.270> can<00:05:11.390> see<00:05:11.570> we're<00:05:11.720> getting

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:11.810 
gain and you can see we're getting

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:13.660 
gain and you can see we're getting
clipping<00:05:12.290> already<00:05:12.620> because<00:05:13.010> of<00:05:13.040> those<00:05:13.310> Peaks

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:13.670 
clipping already because of those Peaks

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:15.940 
clipping already because of those Peaks
so<00:05:14.480> I<00:05:14.510> think<00:05:14.600> here<00:05:14.900> we'll<00:05:15.050> use<00:05:15.230> the<00:05:15.410> limiter<00:05:15.800> to

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:15.950 
so I think here we'll use the limiter to

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:17.500 
so I think here we'll use the limiter to
deal<00:05:16.100> with<00:05:16.250> that<00:05:16.460> so<00:05:16.940> that<00:05:17.060> we<00:05:17.150> don't<00:05:17.330> need<00:05:17.450> to

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:17.510 
deal with that so that we don't need to

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:19.330 
deal with that so that we don't need to
mess<00:05:17.870> too<00:05:18.140> much<00:05:18.170> with<00:05:18.350> the<00:05:18.590> natural<00:05:19.010> attack

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:19.340 
mess too much with the natural attack

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:21.850 
mess too much with the natural attack
and<00:05:19.850> as<00:05:20.030> before<00:05:20.270> just<00:05:20.870> a<00:05:20.960> fast<00:05:21.200> attack<00:05:21.410> and

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:21.860 
and as before just a fast attack and

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:25.840 
and as before just a fast attack and
slightly<00:05:22.580> under<00:05:23.000> 0<00:05:23.330> for<00:05:23.570> the<00:05:23.630> threshold<00:05:24.850> and

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:25.850 
slightly under 0 for the threshold and

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:27.700 
slightly under 0 for the threshold and
we<00:05:26.000> can<00:05:26.120> see<00:05:26.270> this<00:05:26.420> meter<00:05:26.810> here<00:05:27.200> indicating

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:27.710 
we can see this meter here indicating

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:29.560 
we can see this meter here indicating
when<00:05:27.860> it's<00:05:28.010> limiting<00:05:28.430> so<00:05:29.060> we<00:05:29.150> can<00:05:29.300> see<00:05:29.420> it's

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:29.570 
when it's limiting so we can see it's

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:31.210 
when it's limiting so we can see it's
actually<00:05:29.720> coming<00:05:30.230> on<00:05:30.320> quite<00:05:30.500> a<00:05:30.620> bit<00:05:30.740> every

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:31.220 
actually coming on quite a bit every

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:36.180 
actually coming on quite a bit every
time<00:05:31.520> one<00:05:31.700> of<00:05:31.730> those<00:05:31.880> Peaks<00:05:32.240> hits<00:05:32.510> basically

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:36.190 

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:38.650 

so<00:05:37.190> it's<00:05:37.370> already<00:05:37.670> helped<00:05:37.940> a<00:05:38.030> lot<00:05:38.180> but<00:05:38.390> I<00:05:38.480> might

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:38.660 
so it's already helped a lot but I might

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:40.750 
so it's already helped a lot but I might
try<00:05:38.840> compressing<00:05:39.440> it<00:05:39.530> a<00:05:39.590> bit<00:05:39.740> more<00:05:39.950> just

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:40.760 
try compressing it a bit more just

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:42.520 
try compressing it a bit more just
increase<00:05:41.180> the<00:05:41.330> ratio<00:05:41.510> pull<00:05:42.200> down<00:05:42.410> the

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:42.530 
increase the ratio pull down the

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:45.070 
increase the ratio pull down the
threshold<00:05:43.010> a<00:05:43.100> bit<00:05:43.280> of<00:05:44.240> course<00:05:44.510> that<00:05:44.690> gives<00:05:44.930> us

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:45.080 
threshold a bit of course that gives us

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:47.320 
threshold a bit of course that gives us
some<00:05:45.260> more<00:05:45.380> Headroom<00:05:45.770> to<00:05:45.880> increase<00:05:46.880> the<00:05:47.090> gain

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:47.330 
some more Headroom to increase the gain

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:49.660 
some more Headroom to increase the gain
so<00:05:48.260> there's<00:05:48.440> definitely<00:05:48.590> doing<00:05:49.070> the<00:05:49.190> job<00:05:49.460> you

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:49.670 
so there's definitely doing the job you

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:51.250 
so there's definitely doing the job you
can<00:05:49.880> hear<00:05:50.060> a<00:05:50.090> lot<00:05:50.300> more<00:05:50.360> of<00:05:50.660> what's<00:05:50.840> going<00:05:51.050> on

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:51.260 
can hear a lot more of what's going on

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.590 
can hear a lot more of what's going on
not<00:05:51.890> a<00:05:51.950> lot<00:05:52.190> of<00:05:52.220> it's<00:05:52.430> getting<00:05:52.580> lost<00:05:52.880> fact

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:53.600 
not a lot of it's getting lost fact

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:54.910 
not a lot of it's getting lost fact
we're<00:05:53.720> starting<00:05:54.020> to<00:05:54.110> hear<00:05:54.200> a<00:05:54.260> lot<00:05:54.410> more<00:05:54.470> string

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:54.920 
we're starting to hear a lot more string

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:59.950 
we're starting to hear a lot more string
noises<00:05:55.400> now<00:05:57.790> so<00:05:58.790> let's<00:05:58.970> try<00:05:59.210> it<00:05:59.270> with<00:05:59.420> a<00:05:59.450> faster

00:05:59.950 --> 00:05:59.960 
noises now so let's try it with a faster

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:01.750 
noises now so let's try it with a faster
attack<00:06:00.020> time<00:06:00.500> so<00:06:00.740> that<00:06:00.860> we<00:06:00.950> catch<00:06:01.160> those<00:06:01.460> Peaks

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:01.760 
attack time so that we catch those Peaks

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:04.420 
attack time so that we catch those Peaks
right<00:06:02.030> at<00:06:02.210> the<00:06:02.270> start<00:06:02.950> can<00:06:03.950> you<00:06:03.980> straight<00:06:04.310> away

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:04.430 
right at the start can you straight away

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:06.040 
right at the start can you straight away
that<00:06:04.520> that<00:06:04.850> sounds<00:06:05.180> a<00:06:05.240> lot<00:06:05.330> more<00:06:05.390> compressed

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:06.050 
that that sounds a lot more compressed

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:07.720 
that that sounds a lot more compressed
but<00:06:06.290> it<00:06:06.410> also<00:06:06.530> sounds<00:06:07.010> a<00:06:07.040> bit<00:06:07.160> smoother

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:07.730 
but it also sounds a bit smoother

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:09.820 
but it also sounds a bit smoother
because<00:06:07.940> we're<00:06:08.450> compressing<00:06:09.080> it<00:06:09.380> right<00:06:09.560> from

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:09.830 
because we're compressing it right from

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:10.930 
because we're compressing it right from
the<00:06:09.920> start<00:06:10.160> so<00:06:10.310> we're<00:06:10.520> having<00:06:10.640> a<00:06:10.790> bit<00:06:10.910> more

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:10.940 
the start so we're having a bit more

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:14.050 
the start so we're having a bit more
control<00:06:11.420> over<00:06:11.540> it<00:06:12.490> and<00:06:13.490> I<00:06:13.550> don't<00:06:13.580> think<00:06:13.850> it

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:14.060 
control over it and I don't think it

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:15.909 
control over it and I don't think it
sounds<00:06:14.270> too<00:06:14.600> bad<00:06:14.810> having<00:06:15.200> a<00:06:15.260> very<00:06:15.500> compressed

00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:15.919 
sounds too bad having a very compressed

00:06:15.919 --> 00:06:17.740 
sounds too bad having a very compressed
sound<00:06:16.220> here<00:06:16.520> but<00:06:16.820> generally<00:06:17.210> speaking<00:06:17.419> I

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:17.750 
sound here but generally speaking I

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:19.360 
sound here but generally speaking I
think<00:06:17.840> slap<00:06:18.260> bass<00:06:18.500> is<00:06:18.740> probably<00:06:19.010> a<00:06:19.070> bit<00:06:19.190> better

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:19.370 
think slap bass is probably a bit better

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:20.430 
think slap bass is probably a bit better
if<00:06:19.550> you<00:06:19.669> let<00:06:19.880> the<00:06:20.000> natural

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:20.440 
if you let the natural

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:23.250 
if you let the natural
attack<00:06:20.740> through<00:06:21.070> a<00:06:21.100> bit<00:06:21.600> and<00:06:22.600> in<00:06:22.720> fact<00:06:22.930> I<00:06:23.050> think

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:23.260 
attack through a bit and in fact I think

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:24.570 
attack through a bit and in fact I think
with<00:06:23.410> these<00:06:23.530> settings<00:06:23.800> here<00:06:24.100> we're<00:06:24.250> not<00:06:24.340> doing

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:24.580 
with these settings here we're not doing

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:26.400 
with these settings here we're not doing
too<00:06:24.730> badly<00:06:24.970> at<00:06:25.210> the<00:06:25.270> moment<00:06:25.660> this<00:06:25.810> is<00:06:25.870> sounding

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:26.410 
too badly at the moment this is sounding

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:27.930 
too badly at the moment this is sounding
pretty<00:06:26.680> good<00:06:26.800> we're<00:06:27.160> hearing<00:06:27.460> all<00:06:27.610> the<00:06:27.700> notes

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:27.940 
pretty good we're hearing all the notes

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:30.780 
pretty good we're hearing all the notes
everything's<00:06:28.540> coming<00:06:28.900> through<00:06:29.670> but<00:06:30.670> it's

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:30.790 
everything's coming through but it's

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:33.840 
everything's coming through but it's
also<00:06:30.940> not<00:06:31.270> sounding<00:06:31.660> too<00:06:31.900> compressed<00:06:32.730> but<00:06:33.730> we

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:33.850 
also not sounding too compressed but we

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:35.730 
also not sounding too compressed but we
could<00:06:34.030> try<00:06:34.270> and<00:06:34.390> fine-tune<00:06:34.900> the<00:06:35.050> release<00:06:35.380> time

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:35.740 
could try and fine-tune the release time

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:38.100 
could try and fine-tune the release time
a<00:06:35.800> bit<00:06:36.160> so<00:06:36.940> that<00:06:37.060> it<00:06:37.150> works<00:06:37.360> a<00:06:37.510> bit<00:06:37.540> better<00:06:37.840> with

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:38.110 
a bit so that it works a bit better with

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:40.860 
a bit so that it works a bit better with
the<00:06:38.140> timing<00:06:38.860> off<00:06:39.010> the<00:06:39.220> baseline<00:06:39.640> and<00:06:40.300> of

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:40.870 
the timing off the baseline and of

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:42.300 
the timing off the baseline and of
course<00:06:41.080> that<00:06:41.260> brings<00:06:41.440> out<00:06:41.680> some<00:06:41.920> of<00:06:42.040> the<00:06:42.100> later

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:42.310 
course that brings out some of the later

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:44.520 
course that brings out some of the later
part<00:06:42.610> of<00:06:42.700> the<00:06:42.820> sound<00:06:43.090> in<00:06:43.840> fact<00:06:44.110> that<00:06:44.260> spot

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:44.530 
part of the sound in fact that spot

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:46.560 
part of the sound in fact that spot
there's<00:06:44.770> probably<00:06:45.070> not<00:06:45.220> too<00:06:45.430> bad<00:06:45.640> it's<00:06:46.300> quite

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:46.570 
there's probably not too bad it's quite

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:48.450 
there's probably not too bad it's quite
a<00:06:46.600> fast<00:06:46.900> release<00:06:47.290> time<00:06:47.590> though<00:06:47.830> and<00:06:48.040> it<00:06:48.250> might

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:48.460 
a fast release time though and it might

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:49.890 
a fast release time though and it might
not<00:06:48.610> work<00:06:48.640> so<00:06:48.820> well<00:06:49.030> with<00:06:49.270> the<00:06:49.330> longer<00:06:49.690> notes

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:49.900 
not work so well with the longer notes

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:51.840 
not work so well with the longer notes
but<00:06:50.440> it<00:06:50.530> works<00:06:50.710> quite<00:06:50.830> well<00:06:51.220> with<00:06:51.370> the<00:06:51.400> shorter

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:51.850 
but it works quite well with the shorter

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:54.360 
but it works quite well with the shorter
poppier<00:06:52.300> slap<00:06:52.780> bass<00:06:53.020> playing<00:06:53.350> it<00:06:53.920> brings<00:06:54.220> it

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:54.370 
poppier slap bass playing it brings it

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:55.740 
poppier slap bass playing it brings it
right<00:06:54.520> out<00:06:54.700> front<00:06:54.970> makes<00:06:55.240> it<00:06:55.390> sound<00:06:55.600> quite

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:55.750 
right out front makes it sound quite

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:58.560 
right out front makes it sound quite
punchy<00:06:56.140> and<00:06:56.560> in-your-face<00:06:56.950> and<00:06:57.730> remember

00:06:58.560 --> 00:06:58.570 
punchy and in-your-face and remember

00:06:58.570 --> 00:06:59.730 
punchy and in-your-face and remember
with<00:06:58.690> the<00:06:58.750> compressor<00:06:59.200> that<00:06:59.290> each<00:06:59.440> of<00:06:59.470> the

00:06:59.730 --> 00:06:59.740 
with the compressor that each of the

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:01.410 
with the compressor that each of the
settings<00:06:59.980> affect<00:07:00.280> all<00:07:00.700> the<00:07:00.820> other<00:07:00.970> settings

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:01.420 
settings affect all the other settings

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:03.810 
settings affect all the other settings
as<00:07:01.630> well<00:07:01.660> so<00:07:02.230> now<00:07:02.890> that<00:07:02.950> we've<00:07:03.160> got<00:07:03.310> a<00:07:03.340> faster

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:03.820 
as well so now that we've got a faster

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:05.610 
as well so now that we've got a faster
release<00:07:03.970> time<00:07:04.420> you<00:07:04.990> might<00:07:05.200> want<00:07:05.230> to<00:07:05.470> try

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:05.620 
release time you might want to try

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:07.650 
release time you might want to try
faster<00:07:05.950> attack<00:07:06.250> time<00:07:06.760> as<00:07:06.940> well<00:07:07.120> and<00:07:07.330> see<00:07:07.510> how

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:07.660 
faster attack time as well and see how

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:15.270 
faster attack time as well and see how
that<00:07:07.720> affects<00:07:07.870> it<00:07:13.530> but<00:07:14.530> of<00:07:14.650> course<00:07:14.860> what

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:15.280 
that affects it but of course what

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:16.950 
that affects it but of course what
really<00:07:15.490> matters<00:07:15.910> is<00:07:16.060> how<00:07:16.240> it<00:07:16.360> sounds<00:07:16.570> in<00:07:16.840> the

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:16.960 
really matters is how it sounds in the

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:18.840 
really matters is how it sounds in the
mix<00:07:17.200> we<00:07:17.440> might<00:07:17.650> get<00:07:17.830> it<00:07:17.950> sounding<00:07:18.280> great<00:07:18.520> here

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:18.850 
mix we might get it sounding great here

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:20.670 
mix we might get it sounding great here
on<00:07:18.970> its<00:07:19.150> own<00:07:19.300> but<00:07:19.660> then<00:07:20.020> when<00:07:20.200> you<00:07:20.290> put<00:07:20.470> it<00:07:20.560> in

00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:20.680 
on its own but then when you put it in

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:22.680 
on its own but then when you put it in
with<00:07:20.830> a<00:07:20.890> mix<00:07:21.160> it<00:07:21.520> doesn't<00:07:21.880> sound<00:07:22.090> so<00:07:22.240> good<00:07:22.480> and

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:22.690 
with a mix it doesn't sound so good and

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:24.870 
with a mix it doesn't sound so good and
vice-versa<00:07:23.650> you<00:07:24.040> get<00:07:24.220> it<00:07:24.310> sounding<00:07:24.640> good<00:07:24.730> in

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:24.880 
vice-versa you get it sounding good in

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:26.460 
vice-versa you get it sounding good in
the<00:07:24.970> mix<00:07:25.150> and<00:07:25.360> then<00:07:25.450> when<00:07:25.600> you<00:07:25.690> solo<00:07:26.020> it<00:07:26.260> it

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:26.470 
the mix and then when you solo it it

00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:28.260 
the mix and then when you solo it it
doesn't<00:07:26.740> sound<00:07:26.919> so<00:07:27.190> good<00:07:27.370> on<00:07:27.490> its<00:07:27.669> own<00:07:27.820> so

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:28.270 
doesn't sound so good on its own so

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:31.200 
doesn't sound so good on its own so
always<00:07:29.140> keep<00:07:29.410> that<00:07:29.530> focus<00:07:29.800> on<00:07:30.160> how<00:07:30.669> it<00:07:30.820> sounds

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:31.210 
always keep that focus on how it sounds

00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:33.090 
always keep that focus on how it sounds
with<00:07:31.360> everything<00:07:31.750> else<00:07:31.870> okay<00:07:32.650> well<00:07:32.800> that's<00:07:32.950> it

00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:33.100 
with everything else okay well that's it

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:36.780 
with everything else okay well that's it
thanks<00:07:33.520> for<00:07:33.580> watching<00:07:33.669> see<00:07:34.120> you<00:07:34.450> next<00:07:34.480> time
