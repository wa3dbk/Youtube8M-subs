00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
bring it in I'm going to go to close now

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.900 
bring it in I'm going to go to close now
when<00:00:39.809> you<00:00:39.930> start<00:00:40.020> surface<00:00:40.829> grinding<00:00:41.280> never

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
when you start surface grinding never

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.470 
when you start surface grinding never
bring<00:00:42.600> it<00:00:42.750> in<00:00:42.899> on<00:00:43.110> this<00:00:43.410> side<00:00:44.149> unless<00:00:45.149> you<00:00:45.329> want

bring it in on this side unless you want
to<00:00:45.539> launch<00:00:45.690> your<00:00:45.899> blade<00:00:46.079> across<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.620> shop

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
to launch your blade across the shop

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.069 
to launch your blade across the shop
like<00:00:47.129> has<00:00:47.640> happened<00:00:48.329> with<00:00:48.450> many<00:00:48.629> surface

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
like has happened with many surface

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.229 
like has happened with many surface
grinders<00:00:49.500> so<00:00:50.010> I'm<00:00:50.340> close<00:00:50.730> but<00:00:50.969> I'm<00:00:51.090> not

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
grinders so I'm close but I'm not

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.819 
grinders so I'm close but I'm not
touching<00:00:51.780> I'm<00:00:52.350> going<00:00:52.710> kind<00:00:52.920> of<00:00:52.980> fast<00:00:53.039> here<00:00:53.579> but

00:00:56.819 --> 00:00:56.829 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:02.700 

so

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:02.710 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:08.040 

I'm<00:01:02.829> just<00:01:03.070> fairly<00:01:03.309> fussing

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:08.050 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:34.820 

[Music]

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:34.830 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:37.270 

now<00:01:35.340> once<00:01:35.820> I<00:01:36.000> got

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
now once I got

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.450 
now once I got
the<00:01:37.610> depth<00:01:37.910> I<00:01:38.150> want

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.460 
the depth I want

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.490 
the depth I want
I<00:01:39.580> can<00:01:40.090> track<00:01:40.330> my<00:01:40.360> bells<00:01:40.840> up

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:55.010 

track<00:01:43.680> my<00:01:43.860> belt<00:01:44.130> down

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.649 

now<00:01:55.500> if<00:01:55.620> that<00:01:55.770> does<00:01:56.070> is<00:01:56.640> that<00:01:56.700> helps<00:01:57.180> take<00:01:57.390> out

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
now if that does is that helps take out

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.649 
now if that does is that helps take out
any<00:01:58.159> discrepancies<00:01:59.190> we've<00:01:59.970> always<00:02:00.360> let<00:02:00.540> the

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
any discrepancies we've always let the

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:06.140 
any discrepancies we've always let the
machine<00:02:00.960> wind<00:02:01.320> down<00:02:02.840> and<00:02:04.550> that<00:02:05.550> takes<00:02:05.790> out<00:02:05.970> any

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:06.150 
machine wind down and that takes out any

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.150 
machine wind down and that takes out any
discrepancies<00:02:06.930> and<00:02:07.200> abrasive<00:02:07.470> height<00:02:07.890> as<00:02:08.100> a

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
discrepancies and abrasive height as a

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.940 
discrepancies and abrasive height as a
belt<00:02:08.550> gets<00:02:08.819> war<00:02:09.090> and<00:02:09.810> so<00:02:10.110> my<00:02:10.440> first<00:02:10.679> site

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
belt gets war and so my first site

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.220 
belt gets war and so my first site
slides<00:02:11.400> done<00:02:11.730> just<00:02:12.450> check<00:02:12.720> make<00:02:12.930> sure<00:02:13.080> I<00:02:13.140> don't

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
slides done just check make sure I don't

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.830 
slides done just check make sure I don't
have<00:02:13.380> any<00:02:13.470> debris<00:02:13.890> on<00:02:14.100> here<00:02:17.209> to<00:02:18.209> get<00:02:18.360> down<00:02:18.540> now

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
have any debris on here to get down now

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.470 
have any debris on here to get down now
it<00:02:18.980> sticks<00:02:19.980> a<00:02:20.100> lot<00:02:20.280> firmer<00:02:20.760> since<00:02:21.270> I<00:02:21.360> have

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
it sticks a lot firmer since I have

00:02:21.480 --> 00:03:00.470 
it sticks a lot firmer since I have
machined<00:02:21.870> surface<00:02:22.350> or<00:02:22.530> a<00:02:22.560> ground<00:02:22.860> surface

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.170 
yeah just check parallelism on this now

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:50.199 
yeah just check parallelism on this now
I'm<00:03:48.290> using<00:03:48.500> this<00:03:48.680> eighty<00:03:48.920> grit<00:03:49.190> belt<00:03:49.400> hey<00:03:50.180> I
