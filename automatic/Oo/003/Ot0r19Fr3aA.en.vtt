00:00:03.879 --> 00:00:08.360
 girls all big hello today i am 

00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:11.450
 I start my video experiment video on 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:14.360
 about comparing 3 base for shadows we 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:23.270
 We will compare the database of the beat like this it 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:24.940
 looks like this base from essense ile 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:31.850
 meeting 

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:36.040
 Now here is how the framework of meetings and a database 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:40.040
 from vivienne sabo fixation as far as 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:44.750
 something like that and that's what it looks like 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:46.220
 the base will answer sabu we have very bright 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:48.980
 the sun is shining I do not know how it will be with 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:51.260
 lighting well I think everything will be in 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:54.320
 okay, so experiment we will have 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:56.480
 be next morning I will 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:59.239
 shoot a very short video like me 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:02.110
 found some dangerous waving I'll be glad 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:06.079
 talk about texture i will talk about her 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:09.380
 consistency as applied why do we 

00:01:06.079 --> 00:01:11.869
 applied and so on and at the end of the day we 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:14.600
 will see what happened to my and 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:16.779
 shadows and the first base that we are today 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:21.350
 we will test this base from beat 

00:01:16.779 --> 00:01:23.779
 is called as for from now so we 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:27.409
 We will put the base of course very 

00:01:23.779 --> 00:01:29.959
 uncomfortable that she's such a heel 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:32.209
 just such an applicator really 

00:01:29.959 --> 00:01:35.299
 it is very convenient to extrude a dot 

00:01:32.209 --> 00:01:37.459
 quite a bit of a she 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:42.459
 squeezed out and here is such a droplet 

00:01:37.459 --> 00:01:42.459
 just click on 2 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:52.490
 its texture is pretty silky 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:02:06.030
 very easy to apply enough 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:08.580
 absorbed quickly so now we need 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:13.230
 wait 10 minutes for the base 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:15.209
 dry is probably one of the benefits of this 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.510
 bases that it does not give at all in any 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:21.959
 the shade is absolutely her absolutely not 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:25.769
 felt forever as you can see 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:29.610
 absolutely no 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:32.880
 shade no further you put a shadow i 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.959
 I will apply my new shadows from us 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.290
 take color tattoo 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:41.010
 as I said in the previous video by 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:43.680
 my that they do not roll us and very 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:46.500
 unpleasant so they look at the end of the day 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:49.650
 so I still hope on one of 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:54.329
 bases that they are not the ones will not keep at least 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:56.040
 one of them and put before 

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:56.959
 apply the shadows we need directly 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.120
 some 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:11.989
 pillow something to do at least 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:11.989
 powder applied to the base and put the shadow 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:33.290
 all of these should n't be a bit perfect 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:35.420
 dry out just one minute further 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:37.640
 we impose a darkening color with me 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:41.410
 it will be a brown tint from the palette 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:45.370
 from the manhattan 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:45.370
 he is so cold brown 

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:06.820
 and a little bit of noise 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:15.650
 our makeup is ready base started its 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:17.930
 the action is usually my base rolls down 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:20.720
 in the folds see what happens today 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:26.150
 the end of the day let's see my time 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:30.410
 time is half past ten only March 7 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:32.990
 so far it seems to be good and they did not give such 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:34.900
 good shade and shade on their 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:38.300
 base in on this base in principle too 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:40.910
 okay, so let's wait for the results 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:44.080
 or until the evening of half past five let's 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:48.800
 let's see what happened to my shadows and 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:52.820
 so nothing seems to have brought together 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:54.790
 rolled color remained basically the same 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:58.270
 most 

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:58.270
 well, not bad 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:07.200
 here in my fold it seems that 

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:11.540
 rolled up really no if closer 

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:11.540
 take a closer look nothing 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:18.650
 great as long as i like everything 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:22.290
 look at how she will behave 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:27.620
 Well, probably in the late afternoon, maybe 

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:27.620
 hours 8 let's see how it goes 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:44.000
 unfortunately I had shadows 

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:44.000
 if here is the build-up is climbing himself and 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:48.270
 Unfortunately
