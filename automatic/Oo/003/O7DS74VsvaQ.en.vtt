plate the firewall is armor plate and it

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:06.430 
plate the firewall is armor plate and it
had<00:03:03.950> a<00:03:04.090> shroud<00:03:05.090> around<00:03:05.510> the<00:03:05.630> radiator<00:03:05.930> this

armor plate with a junction shutters in
it<00:03:08.510> interestingly<00:03:09.260> the<00:03:10.010> hood<00:03:10.250> itself<00:03:10.730> was

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
it interestingly the hood itself was

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.200 
it interestingly the hood itself was
just<00:03:11.420> standard<00:03:11.750> steel<00:03:12.340> it<00:03:13.340> wasn't<00:03:13.700> until<00:03:13.940> they

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:14.210 
just standard steel it wasn't until they

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:16.600 
just standard steel it wasn't until they
went<00:03:15.080> to<00:03:15.290> the<00:03:15.410> later<00:03:15.650> versions<00:03:16.190> of<00:03:16.340> it<00:03:16.490> that

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:16.610 
went to the later versions of it that

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:23.550 
went to the later versions of it that
they<00:03:16.730> made<00:03:16.910> the<00:03:17.120> hood<00:03:17.330> actually<00:03:17.750> out<00:03:17.870> of<00:03:17.900> armor

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.440 

well<00:03:24.560> I<00:03:24.590> was<00:03:24.980> just<00:03:25.190> noticing<00:03:25.340> that<00:03:25.880> the<00:03:26.210> hood

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.450 
well I was just noticing that the hood

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:28.930 
well I was just noticing that the hood
size<00:03:26.690> didn't<00:03:27.020> look<00:03:27.140> terribly<00:03:27.620> thick<00:03:27.920> now<00:03:28.250> then

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:28.940 
size didn't look terribly thick now then

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:32.320 
size didn't look terribly thick now then
I<00:03:29.060> guess<00:03:29.300> and<00:03:30.050> I<00:03:30.320> guess<00:03:31.310> that's<00:03:31.520> analogous<00:03:32.210> to

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:32.330 
I guess and I guess that's analogous to

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:34.270 
I guess and I guess that's analogous to
what<00:03:32.480> they<00:03:32.630> found<00:03:32.900> in<00:03:33.200> the<00:03:33.320> last<00:03:33.560> few<00:03:33.920> years

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 
what they found in the last few years

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
what they found in the last few years
with<00:03:34.610> the<00:03:35.140> Humvee<00:03:36.140> that<00:03:36.340> they<00:03:37.340> just<00:03:37.550> wasn't

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:38.300 
with the Humvee that they just wasn't

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:40.360 
with the Humvee that they just wasn't
designed<00:03:38.630> as<00:03:39.020> an<00:03:39.170> art<00:03:39.350> as<00:03:39.560> an<00:03:39.770> armored<00:03:40.160> vehicle

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.370 
designed as an art as an armored vehicle

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:42.310 
designed as an art as an armored vehicle
and<00:03:40.940> that's<00:03:41.150> what<00:03:41.390> they<00:03:41.600> needed<00:03:41.990> when<00:03:42.140> they

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:42.320 
and that's what they needed when they

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:43.990 
and that's what they needed when they
got<00:03:42.530> in<00:03:42.650> the<00:03:42.710> car<00:03:42.920> do<00:03:43.190> you<00:03:43.250> mind<00:03:43.460> if<00:03:43.520> I<00:03:43.640> hop<00:03:43.820> up

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 
got in the car do you mind if I hop up

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.410 
got in the car do you mind if I hop up
take<00:03:44.420> a<00:03:44.450> look<00:03:44.570> at<00:03:44.630> the<00:03:44.690> power<00:03:44.900> plant<00:03:46.210> as<00:03:47.210> they

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:47.420 
take a look at the power plant as they

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:51.580 
take a look at the power plant as they
always<00:03:47.810> say<00:03:48.020> we<00:03:48.440> gear<00:03:49.430> up<00:03:49.870> to<00:03:50.870> fight<00:03:51.140> the<00:03:51.440> next

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:51.590 
always say we gear up to fight the next

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:54.640 
always say we gear up to fight the next
more<00:03:51.920> like<00:03:52.130> it<00:03:52.250> was<00:03:52.280> the<00:03:52.490> last<00:03:52.640> one<00:03:52.870> and<00:03:53.870> that's

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:54.650 
more like it was the last one and that's

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:56.320 
more like it was the last one and that's
the<00:03:54.770> same<00:03:54.950> way<00:03:55.100> with<00:03:55.130> his<00:03:55.280> Humvee<00:03:55.580> deals<00:03:56.060> they

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:56.330 
the same way with his Humvee deals they

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:58.900 
the same way with his Humvee deals they
were<00:03:56.390> built<00:03:57.170> for<00:03:57.290> Battlefield<00:03:58.220> kind<00:03:58.520> of<00:03:58.670> use

00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:58.910 
were built for Battlefield kind of use

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:02.320 
were built for Battlefield kind of use
they<00:03:59.180> weren't<00:03:59.480> for<00:03:59.960> urban<00:04:00.610> warfare<00:04:01.610> and

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:02.330 
they weren't for urban warfare and

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:05.020 
they weren't for urban warfare and

hidden mines an unexploded devices and
stuff<00:04:05.150> well<00:04:05.540> they<00:04:05.660> never<00:04:05.780> they<00:04:06.020> were<00:04:06.320> never

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.530 
stuff well they never they were never

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:08.530 
stuff well they never they were never
they<00:04:07.040> designed<00:04:07.610> as<00:04:07.940> an<00:04:08.060> armored<00:04:08.360> personnel

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:08.540 
they designed as an armored personnel
