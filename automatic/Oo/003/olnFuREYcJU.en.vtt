00:00:03.039 --> 00:00:03.049 
okay this is how you make a lego turret

00:00:03.049 --> 00:00:14.180 
okay this is how you make a lego turret
first<00:00:04.049> I<00:00:04.529> gotta<00:00:05.490> take<00:00:05.670> it<00:00:05.850> apart<00:00:06.240> and<00:00:13.190> there

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
first I gotta take it apart and there

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.380 
first I gotta take it apart and there
are<00:00:14.370> some<00:00:15.740> add-ons<00:00:16.740> that<00:00:17.369> you<00:00:17.670> don't<00:00:18.060> need<00:00:18.270> to

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
are some add-ons that you don't need to

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.450 
are some add-ons that you don't need to
put<00:00:18.539> on<00:00:18.690> to<00:00:18.900> make<00:00:19.050> it<00:00:19.170> look<00:00:19.260> like<00:00:19.439> a<00:00:19.500> turret<00:00:20.720> but

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:22.460 
put on to make it look like a turret but

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.580 
put on to make it look like a turret but
it<00:00:23.460> just<00:00:23.640> makes<00:00:23.880> it<00:00:23.970> look<00:00:24.029> cool<00:00:24.420> everyone<00:00:25.380> has

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
it just makes it look cool everyone has

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:31.669 
it just makes it look cool everyone has
these<00:00:25.830> pieces<00:00:28.609> okay<00:00:29.609> first<00:00:30.300> you<00:00:30.869> start<00:00:31.560> off

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
these pieces okay first you start off

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:40.330 
these pieces okay first you start off
with<00:00:31.980> the<00:00:32.009> spin<00:00:32.730> piece<00:00:36.200> place<00:00:37.200> it<00:00:37.469> right<00:00:38.340> there

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:40.340 
with the spin piece place it right there

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:47.560 
with the spin piece place it right there
and<00:00:41.420> then<00:00:44.239> put<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.390> chair<00:00:45.719> on<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.340> opposite

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:47.570 
and then put the chair on the opposite

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.750 
and then put the chair on the opposite
side<00:00:48.570> of<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.809> spinny<00:00:49.260> piece<00:00:49.530> this<00:00:50.460> baby

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
side of the spinny piece this baby

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.189 
side of the spinny piece this baby
should<00:00:51.239> be<00:00:52.760> 11<00:00:53.760> space<00:00:54.120> away<00:00:54.390> from<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:54.899> front

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
should be 11 space away from the front

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:02.270 
should be 11 space away from the front
and<00:00:55.460> then<00:00:56.460> this<00:00:56.940> piece<00:00:57.329> goes<00:00:58.550> on<00:00:59.550> like<00:00:59.789> that<00:01:01.280> so

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
and then this piece goes on like that so

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:08.690 
and then this piece goes on like that so
it<00:01:02.460> bends<00:01:02.670> backwards<00:01:06.290> okay<00:01:07.290> and<00:01:07.500> then<00:01:07.710> to<00:01:08.549> make

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
it bends backwards okay and then to make

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:15.499 
it bends backwards okay and then to make
a<00:01:09.080> barrel<00:01:10.520> you<00:01:11.520> take<00:01:11.729> this<00:01:11.939> and<00:01:12.380> take<00:01:13.380> this<00:01:14.509> and

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
a barrel you take this and take this and

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:20.870 
a barrel you take this and take this and
do<00:01:16.470> that<00:01:16.500> and<00:01:16.830> then<00:01:18.590> extra<00:01:19.590> to<00:01:19.830> place<00:01:20.520> that

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
do that and then extra to place that

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.140 
do that and then extra to place that
little<00:01:21.210> tip<00:01:21.450> on<00:01:21.659> there<00:01:22.130> do<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.310> same<00:01:23.640> with<00:01:23.939> the

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
little tip on there do the same with the

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:31.999 
little tip on there do the same with the
other<00:01:24.180> one<00:01:27.680> and<00:01:28.680> then<00:01:29.490> put<00:01:30.329> it<00:01:30.450> in<00:01:30.630> this<00:01:31.530> and

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
other one and then put it in this and

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:37.880 
other one and then put it in this and
it's<00:01:32.820> got<00:01:33.000> a<00:01:33.030> hole<00:01:33.299> like<00:01:33.630> that<00:01:33.689> in<00:01:34.140> it<00:01:36.740> and<00:01:37.740> do

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
it's got a hole like that in it and do

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.690 
it's got a hole like that in it and do

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
turret and place the barrel on the far

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:58.910 
turret and place the barrel on the far
far<00:01:50.520> side<00:01:52.700> away<00:01:53.700> from<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.570> person<00:01:56.750> and<00:01:57.920> then

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
far side away from the person and then

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.560 
far side away from the person and then
as<00:01:59.460> an<00:01:59.790> extra<00:02:00.770> you<00:02:01.770> could<00:02:01.979> put<00:02:02.189> these<00:02:03.030> things

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
as an extra you could put these things

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.859 
as an extra you could put these things
they're<00:02:04.200> like<00:02:04.380> the<00:02:04.619> spikes<00:02:05.009> of<00:02:05.250> a<00:02:05.369> dragon<00:02:05.880> you

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
they're like the spikes of a dragon you

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:11.420 
they're like the spikes of a dragon you
can<00:02:07.079> get<00:02:07.259> them<00:02:07.380> in<00:02:07.500> different<00:02:07.890> sets<00:02:08.429> like<00:02:10.430> the

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
can get them in different sets like the

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.420 
can get them in different sets like the
Knights

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
Knights

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:19.979 
Knights
then<00:02:17.519> you<00:02:18.519> can<00:02:18.700> put<00:02:18.879> them<00:02:19.000> on<00:02:19.150> however<00:02:19.719> you

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:19.989 
then you can put them on however you

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:21.750 
then you can put them on however you
like<00:02:20.200> I<00:02:20.530> just<00:02:20.920> like<00:02:21.099> putting<00:02:21.340> them<00:02:21.489> on<00:02:21.579> like

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
like I just like putting them on like

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:28.170 
like I just like putting them on like
that<00:02:22.469> and<00:02:23.469> then<00:02:24.129> sit<00:02:24.489> a<00:02:24.519> man<00:02:24.849> in<00:02:25.810> the<00:02:26.109> seat<00:02:27.180> or

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
that and then sit a man in the seat or

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:34.830 
that and then sit a man in the seat or
you<00:02:28.599> could<00:02:28.780> move<00:02:28.959> the<00:02:29.170> seat<00:02:29.439> up<00:02:29.590> one<00:02:33.719> but<00:02:34.719> it

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
you could move the seat up one but it

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.190 
you could move the seat up one but it
makes<00:02:35.019> it<00:02:35.230> harder<00:02:35.650> for<00:02:35.680> the<00:02:36.840> thing<00:02:37.840> they<00:02:38.049> go

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
makes it harder for the thing they go

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.849 
makes it harder for the thing they go
down<00:02:38.379> so<00:02:39.540> you<00:02:40.540> can<00:02:40.719> pretty<00:02:40.930> much<00:02:41.049> put<00:02:41.709> it

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:41.859 
down so you can pretty much put it

00:02:41.859 --> 00:02:45.960 
down so you can pretty much put it
wherever<00:02:42.040> you<00:02:42.400> want<00:02:42.599> but<00:02:44.189> well<00:02:45.189> you<00:02:45.340> can<00:02:45.519> put

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
wherever you want but well you can put

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:52.800 
wherever you want but well you can put
it<00:02:46.090> there<00:02:46.829> and<00:02:47.829> then<00:02:48.750> you<00:02:49.750> put<00:02:49.989> it<00:02:50.340> on<00:02:51.340> a<00:02:51.510> hip<00:02:52.510> or

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
it there and then you put it on a hip or

00:02:52.810 --> 00:03:00.509 
it there and then you put it on a hip or
a<00:02:53.560> base<00:02:53.980> or<00:02:54.849> anything<00:02:55.810> and<00:02:56.790> then<00:02:58.950> you<00:02:59.950> have<00:03:00.159> a

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:00.519 
a base or anything and then you have a

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:03.419 
a base or anything and then you have a
turret
