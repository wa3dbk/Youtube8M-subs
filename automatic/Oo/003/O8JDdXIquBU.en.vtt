00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:15.549
 no no no 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:19.600
 it's like being here I have the others 

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:23.200
 videos and how to make a mine 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:24.730
 efficient I'm in the appointment of this of the 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.110
 heart series with other hours said in the 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:27.720
 description so they can see what the 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:31.300
 appointment because many do not believe me that 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.309
 I found the 32 diamonds were fine and 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.230
 they leave the description and then this 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:38.080
 that already sends a greeting that asked me this 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:41.110
 miguel linda ignacio who sends you a 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:45.640
 greeting and well, thank you, thank you 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:47.710
 and he gave me the idea of â€‹â€‹making a library 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.920
 and then this 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:52.870
 you can greet this I already said and then 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:57.100
 what we are going to do is cut down 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:58.600
 down to where a block is left before 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.210
 of the mother stone we already know that it is the 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:04.920
 mother stone that is this the last 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:04.920
 stone with which da can not be chopped 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.970
 but that's how you're creative and you can 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.979
 explain but look what we are going to do 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:14.140
 is to look down and something important 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:16.210
 to not spend so much wood and in 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.970
 stairs must put some and not 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:21.970
 it has been nothing ok and as you see there we were 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:24.130
 finding byron this coal that 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:25.660
 I found too much mustache I'm going to 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.450
 explain what water is for 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:31.420
 here and look, look, look, look, it's a 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:34.659
 before Pedro as he is designing 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:37.600
 then there we cover it and look 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:41.300
 in itself what water serves is when 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:43.610
 we make relevance 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:46.760
 next we can put torches so that 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:49.310
 see that they are dropped here and if we 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:52.310
 we do a little way and we let ourselves fall 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:54.350
 we fall into the water and we already die and 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.480
 we save a lot of time in being 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:59.440
 going down with the stairs this trick 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.440
 he is very father 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:06.610
 but he is very father 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:08.619
 the trick and well this as I say no 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.209
 I'm going to put torches on the side and 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:14.980
 next thing we're going to do is make the 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:17.620
 fingers leave two and two and this over here what 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.100
 let's not leave it two because to the side 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.460
 was the 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:24.410
 the last thing that remains and happens here 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:28.330
 we go or anything in 200 and the important thing is 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.330
 this one leave it 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:36.350
 true this 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:38.960
 sorry let's look inward 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:40.610
 inside and look, I found gold and go 

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:42.910
 imposing torches for that is very 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.910
 important 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:48.280
 let use many torches so that you do not 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:52.830
 bots appear to us when leaving 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:54.900
 this for a moment to leave us work 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.120
 our mines now and we can sleep in 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.940
 sites 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:01.840
 I found diamond how are you seeing no 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:04.000
 believe that I am a fraud but 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.640
 I swear that I do not know I put it 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.200
 is anything like the swear 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.660
 but as they are fine we do not find 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.910
 Diamond then siren is then undermining 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.920
 that there are many materials the truth if 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:17.950
 we go more to the bottom 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:20.319
 and then all that because this is a video 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.900
 short nothing more to help them in doing 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:26.170
 a mine and more or less you have to be 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:30.950
 presentable but this as they want as 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:32.690
 for example this can be done is fabric 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:34.930
 in layer 15 that is a little bit more 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:34.930
 above 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:43.150
 and that's what this minecraft blog told me 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:44.810
 and then this can be done well 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:47.110
 or 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:49.430
 or as you want it is a suggestion 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:52.910
 that can if they go several sessions it would be 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:55.819
 everything in the next one is the existing one and 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:59.660
 then we go to the other a greeting to 

00:03:55.819 --> 00:04:04.630
 all to the radios let it finish and you 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:04.630
 I take it off now, yeah bye bye bye bye
