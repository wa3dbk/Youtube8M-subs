00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
so you go to the G it's a very common

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.920 
so you go to the G it's a very common
little<00:01:24.950> sort<00:01:25.159> of<00:01:25.220> embellishment<00:01:25.940> on<00:01:26.060> on<00:01:26.509> folk

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:26.930

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:35.869 
least not in the in the key I played and

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:37.240 
least not in the in the key I played and
you<00:01:35.899> can<00:01:36.110> certainly<00:01:36.259> transpose<00:01:36.890> it<00:01:37.070> to<00:01:37.100> any

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250 
you can certainly transpose it to any

you can certainly transpose it to any
key<00:01:37.430> you<00:01:37.460> want<00:01:37.700> to<00:01:38.229> so<00:01:42.070> what<00:01:43.070> is<00:01:43.160> the<00:01:43.280> strum

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:43.550 
key you want to so what is the strum

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:46.150 
key you want to so what is the strum
pattern<00:01:43.910> well<00:01:44.630> basically<00:01:44.990> it's<00:01:45.860> a<00:01:45.979> very

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:46.160 
pattern well basically it's a very

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:47.859 
pattern well basically it's a very
common<00:01:46.399> strum<00:01:46.759> pattern<00:01:47.060> if<00:01:47.179> you've<00:01:47.300> seen<00:01:47.570> my

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:47.869 
common strum pattern if you've seen my

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:49.150 
common strum pattern if you've seen my
other<00:01:47.899> videos<00:01:48.350> in<00:01:48.530> this<00:01:48.649> series<00:01:48.710> you'll

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:49.160 
other videos in this series you'll

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:50.980 
other videos in this series you'll
notice<00:01:49.460> that<00:01:49.610> a<00:01:49.670> recurring<00:01:50.360> pattern<00:01:50.720> is<00:01:50.840> I

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
notice that a recurring pattern is I

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:52.990 
notice that a recurring pattern is I
play<00:01:51.200> I<00:01:51.470> play<00:01:51.920> most<00:01:52.190> of<00:01:52.310> the<00:01:52.369> upbeat<00:01:52.729> songs

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
play I play most of the upbeat songs

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.270 
play I play most of the upbeat songs
anyway<00:01:53.479> with<00:01:53.960> the<00:01:54.080> exact<00:01:54.380> same<00:01:54.590> strum<00:01:54.920> pattern

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
anyway with the exact same strum pattern

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.419 
anyway with the exact same strum pattern
and<00:01:56.229> you<00:01:57.229> can<00:01:57.259> likely<00:01:57.590> do<00:01:57.800> the<00:01:57.920> same<00:01:58.130> you

00:01:58.419 --> 00:01:58.429 
and you can likely do the same you

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:59.590 
and you can likely do the same you
certainly<00:01:58.759> could<00:01:58.970> do<00:01:59.060> different<00:01:59.420> strum

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
certainly could do different strum

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:00.910 
certainly could do different strum
patterns<00:01:59.899> if<00:02:00.020> you<00:02:00.110> wanted<00:02:00.350> to<00:02:00.500> but<00:02:00.679> this<00:02:00.800> is<00:02:00.890> a

you<00:02:13.610> know<00:02:13.700> absolute<00:02:14.090> beginners<00:02:14.450> so<00:02:14.780> a<00:02:15.049> bass

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
you know absolute beginners so a bass

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:17.650 
you know absolute beginners so a bass
note<00:02:15.620> on<00:02:15.769> a<00:02:15.829> chord<00:02:16.130> is<00:02:16.340> the<00:02:16.790> lowest<00:02:17.420> note

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
note on a chord is the lowest note

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.310 
note on a chord is the lowest note
that's<00:02:17.900> sort<00:02:18.140> of<00:02:18.230> related<00:02:18.590> to<00:02:18.739> that<00:02:18.980> chord<00:02:19.340> so

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:20.320 
that's sort of related to that chord so

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.630 
that's sort of related to that chord so
to<00:02:21.320> avoid<00:02:21.530> the<00:02:21.650> technical<00:02:22.040> terms<00:02:22.250> here<00:02:22.489> which

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
I don't even know anyway every chord has

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:26.800 
I don't even know anyway every chord has
one<00:02:25.130> and<00:02:25.370> it's<00:02:25.670> usually<00:02:25.820> going<00:02:26.060> to<00:02:26.120> be<00:02:26.239> towards

possibly the D string but generally

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.020 
possibly the D string but generally
speaking<00:02:32.900> they're<00:02:33.290> mostly<00:02:33.620> at<00:02:33.739> the<00:02:33.890> base<00:02:34.670> year

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
C it's on the a string the second string

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:45.710 
C it's on the a string the second string
from<00:02:44.390> the<00:02:44.450> time

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
from the time

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.990 
from the time
obviously<00:02:46.560> you're<00:02:46.650> playing<00:02:46.920> a<00:02:47.160> C<00:02:47.400> there<00:02:47.640> C

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
obviously you're playing a C there C

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.820 
obviously you're playing a C there C
major<00:02:48.210> so<00:02:48.570> your<00:02:48.720> finger<00:02:49.020> is<00:02:49.140> already<00:02:49.290> on<00:02:49.590> third

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
major so your finger is already on third

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.270 
major so your finger is already on third
fret

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.870 

now<00:02:52.910> to<00:02:52.970> go<00:02:53.180> to<00:02:53.210> the<00:02:53.360> F<00:02:53.570> I<00:02:54.310> actually<00:02:55.310> go<00:02:55.580> to<00:02:55.610> the

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
now to go to the F I actually go to the

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.430 
now to go to the F I actually go to the
D<00:02:56.090> string<00:02:56.300> that's<00:02:56.570> the<00:02:56.690> third<00:02:56.990> string<00:02:57.260> from

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
D string that's the third string from

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.590 
D string that's the third string from
the<00:02:57.560> top

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:08.220 

so<00:03:01.600> for<00:03:01.900> the<00:03:01.960> C<00:03:02.760> for<00:03:03.760> the<00:03:03.850> F<00:03:05.850> and<00:03:06.850> then<00:03:07.600> the<00:03:07.630> G<00:03:07.750> is

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
so for the C for the F and then the G is

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:13.560 
so for the C for the F and then the G is
on<00:03:09.100> the<00:03:09.310> E<00:03:09.550> string<00:03:09.940> the<00:03:10.480> low<00:03:10.630> E<00:03:10.660> string<00:03:12.570> it's

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:13.570 
on the E string the low E string it's

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:16.890 
on the E string the low E string it's
the<00:03:13.690> same<00:03:13.870> bass<00:03:14.080> note<00:03:14.910> for<00:03:15.910> the<00:03:16.000> g7<00:03:16.180> makes<00:03:16.780> no

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
the same bass note for the g7 makes no

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:17.880 
the same bass note for the g7 makes no
difference

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
difference

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:19.500 
difference
so<00:03:18.250> those<00:03:18.460> are<00:03:18.580> the<00:03:18.700> three<00:03:18.970> chords<00:03:19.390> well

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
so those are the three chords well

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:21.840 
so those are the three chords well
technically<00:03:19.870> four<00:03:20.140> chords<00:03:20.470> that<00:03:21.430> you<00:03:21.550> use<00:03:21.670> in

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:21.850 
technically four chords that you use in

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:24.900 
technically four chords that you use in
this<00:03:21.940> song<00:03:22.180> very<00:03:22.390> simple<00:03:23.340> so<00:03:24.340> the<00:03:24.490> strum

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.910 
this song very simple so the strum

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:27.060 
this song very simple so the strum
pattern<00:03:25.210> that<00:03:25.300> I<00:03:25.420> use<00:03:25.750> involves<00:03:26.680> hitting<00:03:26.950> that

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:27.070 
pattern that I use involves hitting that

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:29.550 
pattern that I use involves hitting that
bass<00:03:27.280> note<00:03:27.550> first<00:03:27.940> in<00:03:28.240> a<00:03:28.660> separate<00:03:29.050> pluck<00:03:29.320> a

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560 
bass note first in a separate pluck a

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.680 
bass note first in a separate pluck a
deliberate<00:03:30.010> pluck<00:03:30.250> down

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690

down up down up

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:53.180 
down up down up
so<00:03:51.810> you'll<00:03:51.900> notice<00:03:52.110> I<00:03:52.200> plant<00:03:52.500> my<00:03:52.650> finger<00:03:53.010> there

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
so you'll notice I plant my finger there

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.220 
so you'll notice I plant my finger there
sort<00:03:53.460> of<00:03:53.550> these<00:03:54.300> fingers<00:03:54.660> are<00:03:54.720> on<00:03:54.870> on<00:03:55.140> the

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
sort of these fingers are on on the

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:55.700 
sort of these fingers are on on the
pickguard

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:55.710 
pickguard

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:58.190 
pickguard
so<00:03:56.100> it's<00:03:56.250> a<00:03:56.340> deliberate<00:03:56.670> down<00:03:56.940> to<00:03:57.720> pick<00:03:57.930> stays

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
so it's a deliberate down to pick stays

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.380 
so it's a deliberate down to pick stays
there<00:03:58.410> I<00:03:58.620> don't<00:03:58.740> pull<00:03:59.070> the<00:03:59.160> pick<00:03:59.340> away<00:03:59.580> or<00:04:00.000> put

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
there I don't pull the pick away or put

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:02.600 
there I don't pull the pick away or put
it<00:04:00.510> anywhere<00:04:00.660> else<00:04:00.900> it<00:04:01.080> stays<00:04:01.290> between<00:04:01.610> the

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:02.610 
it anywhere else it stays between the

very simple song very popular you can
also<00:07:11.480> use<00:07:11.810> it<00:07:11.930> to<00:07:11.960> accompany<00:07:12.290> someone<00:07:12.680> who's

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:12.890 
also use it to accompany someone who's

00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:14.320 
also use it to accompany someone who's
playing<00:07:13.100> bagpipe<00:07:13.550> but<00:07:13.730> you'd<00:07:13.850> have<00:07:13.880> to<00:07:14.000> figure

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:14.330 
playing bagpipe but you'd have to figure

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:16.570 
playing bagpipe but you'd have to figure
out<00:07:14.480> I<00:07:14.660> think<00:07:15.020> you<00:07:15.110> use<00:07:15.260> a<00:07:15.290> k'<00:07:15.560> boat<00:07:15.800> to<00:07:16.250> make<00:07:16.430> it

00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:16.580 
out I think you use a k' boat to make it

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:19.630 
out I think you use a k' boat to make it
to<00:07:16.760> be<00:07:16.970> flex<00:07:17.300> I<00:07:17.540> think<00:07:17.720> that's<00:07:17.900> what<00:07:18.640> most

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:19.640 
to be flex I think that's what most

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:21.760 
to be flex I think that's what most
highland<00:07:20.120> bagpipes<00:07:20.510> play<00:07:20.720> in<00:07:20.870> I<00:07:21.080> think<00:07:21.560> I've

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:21.770 
highland bagpipes play in I think I've

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:24.220 
highland bagpipes play in I think I've
done<00:07:21.950> it<00:07:22.070> before<00:07:22.190> but<00:07:22.580> I<00:07:23.000> can't<00:07:23.780> recall<00:07:23.900> that

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:24.230 
done it before but I can't recall that

00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:25.330 
done it before but I can't recall that
so<00:07:24.470> you'd<00:07:24.590> have<00:07:24.620> to<00:07:24.770> figure<00:07:25.010> it<00:07:25.100> out<00:07:25.160> in

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:25.340 
so you'd have to figure it out in

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:27.190 
so you'd have to figure it out in
bagpipes<00:07:25.820> the<00:07:26.030> tuning<00:07:26.360> is<00:07:26.450> slightly<00:07:26.780> sharp<00:07:27.050> I

00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:27.200 
bagpipes the tuning is slightly sharp I

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:29.620 
bagpipes the tuning is slightly sharp I
think<00:07:27.470> or<00:07:27.890> slightly<00:07:28.220> flat<00:07:28.550> and<00:07:29.180> anyway<00:07:29.450> it's<00:07:29.600> a

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:29.630 
think or slightly flat and anyway it's a

00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:31.000 
think or slightly flat and anyway it's a
bit<00:07:29.750> of<00:07:29.840> a<00:07:29.870> challenge<00:07:30.260> to<00:07:30.380> get<00:07:30.500> a<00:07:30.560> guitar<00:07:30.710> to

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:31.010 
bit of a challenge to get a guitar to

00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:32.950 
bit of a challenge to get a guitar to
tune<00:07:31.160> properly<00:07:31.640> with<00:07:31.760> bagpipes<00:07:32.180> I'll<00:07:32.720> put<00:07:32.870> it

00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:32.960 
tune properly with bagpipes I'll put it

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:34.630 
tune properly with bagpipes I'll put it
that<00:07:33.080> way<00:07:33.260> but<00:07:33.800> at<00:07:33.950> any<00:07:34.100> rate<00:07:34.280> it<00:07:34.370> can't<00:07:34.550> be

00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:34.640 
that way but at any rate it can't be

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:38.320 
that way but at any rate it can't be
done<00:07:34.790> I'm<00:07:34.940> sure<00:07:36.580> so<00:07:37.580> I<00:07:37.610> hope<00:07:37.760> you<00:07:37.880> liked<00:07:38.030> it
