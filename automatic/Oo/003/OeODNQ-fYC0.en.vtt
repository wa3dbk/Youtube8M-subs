00:00:04.499 --> 00:00:08.019
 welcome to small photo 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:10.780
 I'm going to talk to you today about the 

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:12.400
 sony nex cameras you know that little one 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:14.019
 compact cameras with super high 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.999
 quality and interchangeable lenses 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:17.950
 let's start with the brand new one 

00:00:15.999 --> 00:00:20.620
 in steps of this series 

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:24.700
 the nex-3n mind to see what's there 

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:26.740
 all in the package he is running 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:28.600
 again printed around that color 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:30.310
 manual in book form that reads nicely 

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.600
 nice 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:33.880
 You can also taste for your holiday 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:37.660
 aircraft of reading 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:43.710
 neck strap is included with charging plug 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:43.710
 united kingdom and lithium battery 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:50.770
 a gradient block from the outlet 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:53.290
 to charge to the camera via usb 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:55.180
 so this is your astral adapter 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:56.980
 USB cable so also under connect to the 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:00.970
 computer and obviously so than here 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:02.380
 may also load of a European plug, and they 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:04.360
 never look further into the box and 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:06.929
 kick the camera itself 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.929
 neat wait 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:13.890
 in this case with the 1650 lens are want 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.470
 luxury lens with a power view will it 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.490
 yellow is very compact so it already looks 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.840
 in the package 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.910
 well we go to the camera itself 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:24.090
 so it is clear 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:26.220
 a system camera from sony de nex-3n 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.290
 newest model it is nice and compact 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.780
 with system cameras you can use those lenses 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.520
 well hope have camera manufacturer 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.530
 chose to have a small the sensor 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.360
 to mount in their camera so that 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.710
 the yellow can be made small 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.260
 well so that of course that doesn't go for it 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.180
 quality im just said being square 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:44.730
 we will maintain the same quality as 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.920
 our slt cameras must therefore have one 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:49.470
 very large image sensor 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.780
 in a very compact jacket well we have 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.040
 there is a 1650 lens that is a lens 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.270
 with a power kiss 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.460
 that was simply saying we like him 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.110
 zoom in by pressing a button 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.620
 slide a button up visit 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.210
 that in 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:03.720
 to look down that back again 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.580
 to wide angle nice range 1650 your lens 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.250
 characterized by very few 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.060
 bias a very good build quality 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.490
 but so on on the device itself 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.200
 we look very pleasant and built-in 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:15.450
 flash 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.070
 week benefits you always have because 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.080
 lies with you if you need you 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:21.930
 not necessarily the same as a flitsertje 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.790
 put on top we see the 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.680
 rear a large display and that 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.660
 display we can tilt out so that we 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.980
 so the camera at a separate angle too 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.750
 still be able to use 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.250
 series sleepy our photographing blow 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.110
 just move the screen up and 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.459
 then you can just see what happens 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.130
 see what you are doing with the 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:39.630
 camera very easy a proposal 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.550
 of course there is not on my route 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:43.260
 that of the display is super clear 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:46.019
 the sun a lot and I still can 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:48.120
 just see what 's on the photo there 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:50.190
 so found work inside behind it 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.440
 the lens directly connects the image sensor in this 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.900
 case it is about the well-known 16 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.430
 megapixels heavenly from sony with the 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.750
 enjoy exmoor which takes care of whole 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.730
 good performance all 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.230
 lighting conditions might be one 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.330
 of the best sensors that they 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.920
 in this total the camera industry 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.530
 on the side we see and close all 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:11.140
 connections and sd slot 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.610
 a usb connection an hdmi connection 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.989
 already very easy to use the camera 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.129
 to be able to close on television or 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:17.440
 computer 

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:19.269
 on the back we find a rotary wheel 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.250
 can operate the camera and quickly 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:23.530
 settings can scroll and 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.299
 traffic on top of few buttons is nice 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.549
 so we have a play button or photos 

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:29.319
 look back and rixoort button for the 

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:30.879
 movie function but that's it he is 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:32.200
 nice and tight we will use the camera 

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:33.700
 they are not easy to use 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.250
 put off by many buttons 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.569
 However, if you want to mess up, then that is something 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.970
 of course you can now choose me 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:40.690
 for aperture priority 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.500
 shutter priority for manual 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:43.780
 exposure 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:47.109
 they very beautiful complete camera a whole 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:48.940
 yes compact innocent looking jacket 

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:50.079
 very nice pictures but you can see it 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.489
 perhaps not on the outside 

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:53.500
 one-two-three off because are 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:58.170
 system cameras is so nice and small 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:58.170
 also this nex-3n doll
