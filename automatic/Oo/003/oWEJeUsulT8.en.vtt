00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 the wilo that means two apps 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.819
 display simultaneously on the display 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.040
 It's not only possible with samsung 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.410
 galaxy note no is synonymous with the 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.450
 samsung galaxy s 5 and how exactly 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:16.130
 works as it turns it on 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.130
 we show you after a short break 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:30.759
 his topic today is multivendor yes 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:32.169
 multi window a function of mine 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:34.570
 know after the first time with the 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:36.940
 Samsung Galaxy Note was introduced and 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:39.100
 a really interesting and 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.320
 useful feature namely allows 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.540
 two apps at the same time on the display 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.879
 unfortunately it is with the samsung 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:49.570
 galaxy s 5 by default first 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:51.790
 deactivated but gives it two ways to 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.530
 activate once over the so-called 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:55.170
 quick buttons as I like to call them 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:59.619
 now we have here first 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.610
 by default the one that lets that show 

00:00:59.619 --> 00:01:02.559
 to move here again 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:04.239
 there is already the button multi 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:06.189
 window if he should not be there 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:08.680
 then you can open this again 

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:11.619
 and then you find all sorts of things 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:15.909
 Variations and I just switch 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:17.290
 times multi window 1 turned on the 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:19.479
 second really for the still fast 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:20.320
 Show is over settings completely 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:21.880
 normal 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.530
 and then do not be surprised if that 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.330
 at me a little bit different looks the 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.010
 you can go here again in the 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.300
 Settings change whether the 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:30.280
 settings grid view 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:32.800
 list view or whatever 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.600
 should therefore be under device and then see 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.620
 you already have the button multi window here 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.230
 and of course that is already 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:39.790
 since we activated them about the war 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:41.470
 button activated as soon as the gene 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:43.360
 activated comes here so a small 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:45.780
 Lasche on the side you can 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.890
 simply hold down and adjust 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.990
 then you can forgive those 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.300
 also on the other side yes 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.100
 depending on whether you are left-handed on the right 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.210
 or probably like this want to have lax 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.030
 so I have those times now me one 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.350
 bit down there and if I am 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.600
 click on it now 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:05.110
 Do you see already open at the side 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:06.790
 some apps and with the help of that 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.140
 is there also it press and because 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:10.690
 the corresponding upper or lower 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:13.269
 window pull open then also the 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.500
 appropriate app I like to have 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:17.170
 So now I want two 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:20.739
 I also selected these accordingly 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.700
 open and so we press now 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:24.730
 So here we can in both 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.560
 windows can work simultaneously 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.430
 the window size also with this 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.769
 small 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:34.180
 here in the middle I still show 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:36.250
 forgave a bit mobile phone camera 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.500
 So yes, the one enlarge or that 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.700
 other smaller so I pull you something 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.219
 a bit upwards so now I have 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:45.489
 youtube blue bigger now they called it 

00:02:42.219 --> 00:02:49.450
 below i have google maps bigger and 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:51.430
 This nipple we now so 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.200
 maybe a little childhood dream 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.209
 but who knows, there are others 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.400
 functions in which i just go on 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:03:02.430
 So I can give you that impression 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:05.590
 one swap the two windows yes 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.099
 So google maps below and youtube now 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.200
 above 

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:09.939
 the second variant is the one in the middle 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.919
 icon means things are off 

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:13.959
 can cut and in the window 

00:03:11.919 --> 00:03:15.819
 borrow below or below 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:18.609
 can and the window up there 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:20.139
 can transport and that means ixs 

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:22.659
 we already close windows and 

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:24.879
 Although the window because it last 

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:28.239
 was activated now I activate times 

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:32.229
 google maps and shut up and then stay 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:33.370
 so youtube open yes so one too 

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:36.579
 very interesting thing 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:38.919
 which might be interesting as well 

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:41.379
 this little one this little nipple 

00:03:38.919 --> 00:03:44.049
 get rid of here by simply the 

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:47.290
 back button keeps pressed then gets 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:49.030
 Just give this this function 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:50.799
 off that does not mean that 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:52.659
 multi windows is equipped but 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:55.379
 only that this little nipple lay is yes 

00:03:52.659 --> 00:03:58.930
 So this lax you see multivendor 

00:03:55.379 --> 00:04:00.370
 still activated so that it 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:02.560
 still on but only this 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:04.180
 small that little lax if the 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.590
 Distract me in the same way 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.959
 get is also back when I're 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:09.759
 simply hold down the tab is 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:11.859
 back there that was it in the reason 

00:04:09.759 --> 00:04:13.629
 taken already with the multi 

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:14.680
 windows function how does it work 

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:16.209
 how do I turn it on 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.009
 and how do I use it if it is you 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:20.409
 Like Saturday still has fallen over 

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:22.060
 divide and shoulder look in 

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:24.220
 our playlist so we still have 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:24.970
 some other tips and tricks for that 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:26.860
 samsung 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:32.860
 ex isp until then the house again 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:34.870
 remorseful android if you like the video of the 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:37.000
 Fine has gone is not our kidney 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:38.950
 and maybe twitter google + and twitter 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.760
 share facebook with others as well 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:41.760
 that have lamps 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:46.430
 are already long 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:51.120
 because the healthy 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:55.940
 to the annoyance of the healthy
