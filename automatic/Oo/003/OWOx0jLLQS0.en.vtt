 chemical peels are 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:21.140
 non-invasive cosmetic procedures

 rejuvenate the appearance of the skin with 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:29.390
 time factors such as damage caused by 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:31.699
 sun heredity and diet movements 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:34.220
 repetitive movements of muscles contribute to 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:36.580
 the formation of lines and wrinkles on the face 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:39.050
 in addition the development of 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:41.720
 irregularities of pigmentation or 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:44.090
 acne scars can cause the

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.270
 young 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:50.239
 often performed on the neck face 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:52.550
 and hands the different types of peelings 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:55.280
 chemicals can reduce the appearance of 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:57.469
 facial wrinkles scars and pigmentation 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.540
 as well as treat injuries 

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:01.940
 pre-cancerous skin 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.710
 the superficial peels are the shape 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.750
 more gentle treatment of peeling 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.910
 chemical peels 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.369
 are performed using 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:13.130
 alpha hydroxy acids and in some cases 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:15.470
 alpha hydroxy acids 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.810
 hydroxy acids are acids that occur 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:20.810
 naturally and which include 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.940
 glycolic acid and lactic acid 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.940
 fruits while beta 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:28.220
 hydroxy acids include salicylic acid 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:30.770
 you may be familiar with acid 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.420
 glycolic acid and with salicylic acid a 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.369
 not infrequently important. 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:37.009
 ingredients of facial creams and 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:39.050
 astringent although the concentration of 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:41.599
 may vary depending on the 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:43.149
 treatment extension the acids used 

00:01:41.599 --> 00:01:46.099
 to perform the superficial peels 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:48.890
 not as annoying as others 

00:01:46.099 --> 00:01:51.500
 chemical peels in reality low 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.800
 concentrations of alpha hydroxy acids are 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.450
 often mixed in facial creams 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:58.459
 solutions that can be used as part of 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.649
 of daily facial care routine 

00:01:58.459 --> 00:02:03.349
 to maintain a youthful appearance with 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:05.360
 short period of inactivity the peelings 

00:02:03.349 --> 00:02:08.060
 are an effective method for 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:11.060
 treat fine lines abnormalities of 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:13.790
 acne and skin scars pigmentation 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.560
 constantly dry 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.739
 the screen is composed of two layers 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:21.560
 known as the epidermis and dermis 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:23.989
 epidermis the outer layer of skin acts 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.900
 as the primary defense against skin 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:28.460
 environment and, consequently, these 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.850
 layers are damaged 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:34.010
 the dermis the deeper layer of the skin is 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:36.530
 composed mainly of woven fabric 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:39.680
 connective tissue 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:42.530
 the dermis collagen fiber and 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:46.130
 elastin forms a network that provides 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:48.560
 structure support and elasticity of the skin 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:51.050
 over time this fiber network will also 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.720
 decomposes what, in addition to other factors 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:57.140
 contributes to the formation of wrinkles and 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:59.600
 other changes in appearance during a 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:02.480
 superficial peeling a chemical solution 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:05.090
 applied to the face to cause an solution 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:07.750
 mild trauma or injury to the epidermis that is 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:10.610
 composed of five distinct layers 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.130
 similar to skin exfoliation to injury 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:14.780
 causes the outer layers 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:17.510
 be stripped as part of the 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:19.760
 healing process the increase of the 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:22.610
 cell growth products layers 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.680
 new and healthier 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:27.050
 provide the phase with a more 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:29.180
 rejuvenated lush 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:31.310
 it is important to realize that peelings 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:34.180
 are not intended for use in 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:36.110
 treatment of deep wrinkles or skin 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:38.570
 significantly flaccid 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:41.210
 in these circumstances a facelift 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:42.980
 or injections of skin filling 

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:46.310
 can produce more 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:48.920
 often referred to as 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:50.960
 peeling of the lunch hour in general the 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.330
 superficial peels can last between 

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:55.730
 15 and 30 minutes 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:57.890
 few weeks before your procedure 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:00.440
 your doctor may recommend the use of a 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:01.400
 facial product containing trance acid 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.530
 hypnotic 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.960
 This is because it is believed that acid 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:08.420
 retinoic acid prepare the outer layers 

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:10.880
 from the skin to the treatment has as 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:14.090
 allows chemical peeling solution 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:16.280
 is evenly absorbed by the skin 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:19.190
 it may also be necessary to wash the 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:21.410
 face with special soap 24 hours 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:23.810
 prior to your procedure before 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:25.460
 beginning of your procedure to the areas of 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:27.170
 treatment will be cleaned 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:29.540
 typically using a product 

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:31.580
 Alcohol-based facial cleaning 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:33.410
 although you may feel light 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:35.150
 burning or heating sensation 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:37.100
 during treatment 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:38.930
 most likely you will not take off 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:41.249
 no significant pain 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:43.669
 therefore for a superficial peeling 

00:04:41.249 --> 00:04:46.559
 an anesthetic is usually not needed 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:48.569
 using a sponge or a brush. 

00:04:46.559 --> 00:04:51.089
 apply the chemical solution in 

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:54.119
 individual areas over the entire face 

00:04:51.089 --> 00:04:55.949
 the solution will penetrate your skin 

00:04:54.119 --> 00:04:59.459
 about 15 minutes 

00:04:55.949 --> 00:05:01.289
 then it will be removed or neutralized 

00:04:59.459 --> 00:05:04.139
 with another substance 

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:06.749
 in general superficial peels treat 

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:08.789
 the epidermis is why the effects 

00:05:06.749 --> 00:05:11.189
 treatment are lower than 

00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:13.139
 other types of chemical peels 

00:05:11.189 --> 00:05:15.599
 the chemical solution used during a 

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:18.449
 surface peeling damages the layers 

00:05:15.599 --> 00:05:21.829
 the outer layers of the epidermis, what 

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:24.659
 that peel the healing process 

00:05:21.829 --> 00:05:27.059
 triggers the cellular growth that 

00:05:24.659 --> 00:05:29.299
 generates new layers of skin 

00:05:27.059 --> 00:05:32.429
 in addition the healing process 

00:05:29.299 --> 00:05:34.079
 also stimulates the production of collagen and 

00:05:32.429 --> 00:05:36.959
 elastin in the dermis 

00:05:34.079 --> 00:05:40.229
 as the damaged skin peels off 

00:05:36.959 --> 00:05:43.529
 the new skin revealed both to the face a 

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:46.229
 revitalized softer appearance 

00:05:43.529 --> 00:05:48.269
 immediately after the procedure you 

00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:50.759
 you may feel some redness and 

00:05:48.269 --> 00:05:52.169
 which are similar to 

00:05:50.759 --> 00:05:55.439
 sunburn 

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:57.869
 as the healing occurs is 

00:05:55.439 --> 00:06:01.289
 you can see some faces or 

00:05:57.869 --> 00:06:02.879
 peeling of the skin most likely 

00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:05.909
 these symptoms have decreased in 

00:06:02.879 --> 00:06:08.549
 approximately seven days 

00:06:05.909 --> 00:06:10.799
 although bandages are not required 

00:06:08.549 --> 00:06:14.099
 as in any wound it is important 

00:06:10.799 --> 00:06:15.839
 keep the area wet and protected 

00:06:14.099 --> 00:06:18.599
 therefore your doctor may recommend 

00:06:15.839 --> 00:06:20.610
 that a protective ointment be applied 

00:06:18.599 --> 00:06:22.619
 on your face several days after the 

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:25.319
 treatment 

00:06:22.619 --> 00:06:29.429
 the new skin begins to appear in about 

00:06:25.319 --> 00:06:32.069
 one to two weeks as 

00:06:29.429 --> 00:06:34.079
 heals your skin will become more sensitive 

00:06:32.069 --> 00:06:36.719
 exposure to the sun 

00:06:34.079 --> 00:06:38.939
 therefore during healing it is 

00:06:36.719 --> 00:06:43.319
 extremely important to protect the skin 

00:06:38.939 --> 00:06:45.479
 against uv-a and uv-b rays in general. 

00:06:43.319 --> 00:06:47.729
 results of a superficial peeling are 

00:06:45.479 --> 00:06:50.279
 compared to more 

00:06:47.729 --> 00:06:53.969
 aggressive treatment as a peeling 

00:06:50.279 --> 00:06:54.600
 medium or deep, but this too 

00:06:53.969 --> 00:06:56.400
 means 

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:59.610
 that the risks associated with 

00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:02.040
 procedure are usually lower 

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:04.980
 your doctor may recommend repeated 

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:07.350
 treatments at regular intervals 

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:10.110
 for example some people receive 

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:12.960
 weekly or monthly treatment until 

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:15.390
 that the desired result is achieved 

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:18.330
 it is important to realize that the appearance of 

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:21.390
 your skin will continue to change and grow old 

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:24.150
 after the superficial peeling treatment 

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:26.130
 however the superficial peels are 

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:29.720
 a fast and effective method for 

00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:29.720
 rejuvenate your skin
