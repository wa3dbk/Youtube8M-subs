00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.670
 Moving to NBA justified almost everything 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:08.429
 expectations of fame especially our player 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.889
 impressed by the scale of the halls and the organization 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:13.469
 team work 

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:15.120
 you come to training us 15 people 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.180
 players come to the gym and 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:21.330
 about 15-20 people come 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:25.470
 staff who do what 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:27.330
 I do not know anything until there goes a joke 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.670
 such that take me will be grandchildren 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.439
 tie it really tons up 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.630
 such as such people have 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.850
 work with all this has to 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.270
 seventh sweat and grasp everything on the fly 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.840
 or rather say between flights 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:42.300
 tight schedule 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.760
 game training at least basically 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.980
 individual work separate words 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.620
 parsed the rule of three seconds in defense 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.770
 should have touched players who 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.930
 run through the zone could n't even not 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.180
 of whom I pitch from another player if 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:01.559
 the red zone is my three seconds 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:03.629
 this will update Well it did not know a lot 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.500
 nuances especially when we have 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:09.000
 seasonal ozone protection protect 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.670
 center must stand in the middle 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.840
 a three-second zone while it can 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.020
 advice for three seconds 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.600
 naturally need to find approaches like 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.930
 how can you walk yourself this time 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:25.799
 when you can exit the zone so as not to not 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:28.140
 lose your way suzy game time for 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:30.900
 our centering was initially big 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:35.009
 problem well spent before the season q a 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:36.299
 then 30 matches on the bank came out when our 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.729
 player injured 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:41.520
 had to break through penalties and in such 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.310
 In case of a foreign team coach was entitled to 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.930
 choose who will think penal 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.729
 natural assistant trainers for 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.670
 Said that there is such a boy sitting 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.850
 which has never left the system 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:56.220
 he chose me 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:56.220
 so it suddenly appeared on the floor 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.580
 jitter quickly passes when you enter 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:03.490
 the game is generally the same 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:04.150
 NBA games are a feast for the viewer there 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:08.020
 statutes 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:09.310
 entertainment show that is before 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.140
 even before the game started 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:17.950
 really a lot of advertising very 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:20.890
 many all sorts of posters is one thing but in 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:23.670
 play time is 20 minutes before the game 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:26.050
 some kind of presentation is already someone there 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.450
 minutely painted who is there something 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:30.760
 doing affairs and shows from the very first match 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.930
 it was not easy to play 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:36.130
 small segments but thanks for that 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:39.370
 really hard to hold 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:42.220
 productive because you too on 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:44.650
 a very small amount of time is necessary though 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:48.090
 show something is somewhere forcing 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:51.940
 events somewhere hurry somewhere something 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:54.280
 climb to where it is not necessary as well, the principle of 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.590
 it is also necessary otherwise 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.340
 show or go back to 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.430
 bench 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:02.470
 but ignite a couple of times weakly yet managed to 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:05.079
 first this is double double in a duel with 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:07.090
 by indiana and of course I will give in through brooke 

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:09.549
 Lopez in the match against Brooklyn 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:13.540
 I did not even know that the hem of the blade groups 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:16.570
 Here but the situation is so dictated to me 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:21.459
 what was supposed to do i get got 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:23.980
 the ball is already at the continuation of the score and I 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:24.459
 could not score except how besides 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.489
 climb up 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:30.700
 first in the zone to push and then 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:33.370
 make a throw so did it and 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:36.070
 like many word fans wants 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:38.829
 score so often he clearly knows what 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:40.239
 for this you need next season from 

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:45.990
 they expect me like any other 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:49.440
 centering stability of the game in defense 

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:51.840
 powerful completions so here you are 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.670
 the selection that is the weirdest 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.490
 I will run the session love and I do not 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:59.430
 wants to have such a player as a team 

00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:01.290
 a little staying at home weakly went to 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:03.510
 us to engage in individual 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:05.850
 the program will then be prepared for 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:08.610
 evrobasketu in the national team statement on 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:11.340
 glory and by the beginning of the season will need 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:13.320
 come up fully armed week sport wishes 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.560
 Vyacheslav Kravtsovu more game 

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.560
 of time
