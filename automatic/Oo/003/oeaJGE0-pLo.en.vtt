00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:20.140
 Seas and mountains I will cross, 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:27.220
 I will find you again in your land. 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:31.490
 Winds, storms I will ride. 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:46.480
 I die between lightning to have you. 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:01:04.470
 Wonderful creature, you face the world. 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:16.460
 Wonderful madness, feel together. 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:26.210
 It's his look, two suns burning the dawn. 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:27.210
 I love life, wonderful. 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.210
 You shine in my eyes, you shine on me. 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:29.210
 I want to be the moon to caress you. 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:30.210
 I hang from your dreams, I veil over you. 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.210
 Do not wake up, do not wake up ... Now. 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:32.210
 Wonderful creature, you face the world. 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.130
 Wonderful madness, feel together. 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:37.130
 It's his look, and I can not find the words. 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:38.130
 I love life, wonderful. 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.130
 Wonderful creature, you face the world. 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:40.130
 Wonderful madness, feel together. 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:41.130
 It's his look, two suns burning the dawn. 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.130
 I love life, wonderful ... 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.131
 Wonderful...
