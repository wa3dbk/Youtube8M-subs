basically<00:00:40.860> um<00:00:41.129> I'm<00:00:42.000> starting<00:00:42.660> this<00:00:42.780> drawing

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
basically um I'm starting this drawing

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.680 
basically um I'm starting this drawing
right<00:00:43.350> now<00:00:43.530> and<00:00:43.860> I'm<00:00:44.070> drawing<00:00:44.520> really<00:00:45.000> really

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
right now and I'm drawing really really

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.389 
right now and I'm drawing really really
slow<00:00:46.020> like<00:00:46.260> I<00:00:46.410> said<00:00:46.620> this<00:00:46.770> thing<00:00:46.950> is<00:00:47.010> sped<00:00:47.370> up

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
slow like I said this thing is sped up

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.040 
slow like I said this thing is sped up
so<00:00:47.670> it<00:00:47.760> looks<00:00:47.910> like<00:00:48.000> i'm<00:00:48.210> drawing<00:00:48.480> fast<00:00:48.809> but

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
so it looks like i'm drawing fast but

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.529 
so it looks like i'm drawing fast but
when<00:00:49.590> you're<00:00:49.770> drawing<00:00:50.460> a<00:00:50.640> glass<00:00:50.879> like<00:00:51.180> this<00:00:51.210> i

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
when you're drawing a glass like this i

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.060 
when you're drawing a glass like this i
think<00:00:51.600> that<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.199> thing<00:00:52.649> that<00:00:52.829> a<00:00:52.890> lot<00:00:53.039> of

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
think that the the thing that a lot of

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.830 
think that the the thing that a lot of
people<00:00:53.190> get<00:00:53.520> caught<00:00:53.760> up<00:00:53.820> with<00:00:54.000> is<00:00:54.329> details

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
people get caught up with is details

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.720 
first so what I'm doing is I'm just kind
of<00:00:58.050> trying<00:00:58.320> to<00:00:58.440> get<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:58.649> basic<00:00:59.100> shape<00:00:59.129> of<00:00:59.609> it

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
of trying to get the basic shape of it

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.119 
of trying to get the basic shape of it
in<00:00:59.879> before<00:01:00.780> I<00:01:01.050> get<00:01:01.320> into<00:01:01.500> any<00:01:01.739> of<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:01.949> details

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
in before I get into any of the details

and and basically you got to have some
pretty<00:01:04.229> good<00:01:04.320> eye-hand<00:01:04.650> coordination<00:01:05.070> to<00:01:05.519> do

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
pretty good eye-hand coordination to do

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.760 
pretty good eye-hand coordination to do
this<00:01:05.939> what<00:01:06.689> you<00:01:06.840> want<00:01:07.110> to<00:01:07.260> do<00:01:07.439> when<00:01:07.619> you're

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
this what you want to do when you're

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.440 
this what you want to do when you're
starting<00:01:08.159> to<00:01:08.400> draw<00:01:08.610> a<00:01:08.640> very<00:01:09.030> complicated

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
starting to draw a very complicated

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.260 
starting to draw a very complicated
glass<00:01:10.020> like<00:01:10.320> this<00:01:10.350> is<00:01:10.740> you<00:01:11.250> want<00:01:11.460> to<00:01:11.549> block<00:01:11.939> out

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
glass like this is you want to block out

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.450 
glass like this is you want to block out
the<00:01:12.299> big<00:01:12.810> shapes<00:01:13.290> that<00:01:13.500> you<00:01:13.650> see<00:01:14.010> and<00:01:14.100> you<00:01:14.250> want

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
the big shapes that you see and you want

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.969 
the big shapes that you see and you want
to<00:01:14.549> try<00:01:14.760> to<00:01:14.820> simplify<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.659> shapes<00:01:16.049> so<00:01:16.740> the

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
to try to simplify the shapes so the

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.300 
to try to simplify the shapes so the
first<00:01:17.220> shape<00:01:17.549> is<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:17.909> actual<00:01:18.210> glass<00:01:18.450> itself

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
first shape is the actual glass itself

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.880 
first shape is the actual glass itself
and<00:01:20.310> then<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:21.060> second<00:01:21.570> shape<00:01:21.810> is<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.409> bottom

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
and then the second shape is the bottom

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.130 
and then the second shape is the bottom
a<00:01:23.070> thickness<00:01:23.759> of<00:01:24.150> the<00:01:24.299> glass<00:01:24.330> it's<00:01:24.810> about

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
a thickness of the glass it's about

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.410 
a thickness of the glass it's about
three<00:01:25.470> quarters<00:01:25.680> of<00:01:25.860> an<00:01:26.130> inch<00:01:26.250> thick<00:01:26.670> and<00:01:26.850> then

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
three quarters of an inch thick and then

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.469 
three quarters of an inch thick and then
inside<00:01:28.020> that<00:01:28.320> glass<00:01:28.590> is<00:01:29.040> coffee<00:01:29.610> so<00:01:30.240> what<00:01:30.450> I

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
inside that glass is coffee so what I

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.960 
inside that glass is coffee so what I
try<00:01:30.840> to<00:01:30.869> do<00:01:31.229> is<00:01:31.470> is<00:01:31.710> number<00:01:32.250> one<00:01:32.460> get<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:32.759> shape

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
try to do is is number one get the shape

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.880 
try to do is is number one get the shape
of<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.150> glass<00:01:33.390> number<00:01:33.780> to<00:01:33.960> get<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.320> bottom<00:01:34.740> of

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
of the glass number to get the bottom of

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.679 
of the glass number to get the bottom of
the<00:01:34.979> glass<00:01:35.159> in<00:01:35.430> that<00:01:35.670> three-quarters<00:01:36.240> of<00:01:36.420> an

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
the glass in that three-quarters of an

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.950 
the glass in that three-quarters of an
inch<00:01:36.780> high<00:01:37.049> piece<00:01:38.040> of<00:01:38.340> thick<00:01:39.150> glass<00:01:39.479> and<00:01:39.810> then

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
inch high piece of thick glass and then

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.140 
inch high piece of thick glass and then
I<00:01:40.079> get<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.350> coffee<00:01:40.650> and<00:01:40.979> then<00:01:41.130> I<00:01:41.189> look<00:01:41.729> at<00:01:41.970> at

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
I get the coffee and then I look at at

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.810 
I get the coffee and then I look at at
the<00:01:42.420> shapes<00:01:42.780> up<00:01:43.049> above<00:01:43.560> in<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:43.829> translucent

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
the shapes up above in the translucent

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.120 
the shapes up above in the translucent
section<00:01:45.360> and<00:01:45.479> those<00:01:46.170> shapes<00:01:46.590> I<00:01:46.799> try<00:01:47.070> to

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
section and those shapes I try to

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.850 
section and those shapes I try to
simplify<00:01:47.610> them<00:01:48.090> on<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.930> shape<00:01:49.229> on<00:01:49.439> the<00:01:49.590> right

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
simplify them on the shape on the right

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.310 
simplify them on the shape on the right
is<00:01:50.159> a<00:01:50.220> dark<00:01:50.729> shape<00:01:51.030> shape<00:01:51.420> in<00:01:51.630> the<00:01:51.720> middle<00:01:52.079> is<00:01:52.290> a

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
is a dark shape shape in the middle is a

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.440 
is a dark shape shape in the middle is a
dark<00:01:52.680> shape<00:01:52.950> and<00:01:53.159> then<00:01:53.610> we<00:01:53.759> have<00:01:53.880> a<00:01:53.909> highlight

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
dark shape and then we have a highlight

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.330 
dark shape and then we have a highlight
section<00:01:55.079> and<00:01:55.320> then<00:01:55.560> another<00:01:55.860> highlight

you're going to draw a still life I

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.000 
you're going to draw a still life I

from<00:02:46.110> and<00:02:46.459> basically<00:02:47.459> what<00:02:47.700> I<00:02:47.760> told<00:02:47.880> them<00:02:48.239> to

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
from and basically what I told them to

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.220 
from and basically what I told them to
do<00:02:48.630> is<00:02:48.930> to<00:02:49.010> look<00:02:50.010> at<00:02:50.280> the<00:02:50.430> glass<00:02:50.700> this<00:02:51.209> way<00:02:51.510> look

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
do is to look at the glass this way look

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.670 
do is to look at the glass this way look
at<00:02:52.470> it<00:02:52.680> as<00:02:52.830> shape<00:02:53.730> number<00:02:54.090> one<00:02:54.330> shape<00:02:55.319> number

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
at it as shape number one shape number

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.490 
at it as shape number one shape number
to<00:02:55.890> shape<00:02:56.580> number<00:02:56.850> three<00:02:57.120> like<00:02:57.330> four<00:02:58.200> five<00:02:58.470> and

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
to shape number three like four five and

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.880 
to shape number three like four five and
six<00:02:58.890> and<00:02:59.489> each<00:02:59.970> one<00:03:00.450> of<00:03:00.480> those<00:03:00.750> shapes<00:03:01.140> should

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
six and each one of those shapes should

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.580 
six and each one of those shapes should
have<00:03:02.190> a<00:03:02.220> major<00:03:02.880> value<00:03:03.630> to<00:03:03.810> it<00:03:03.959> now<00:03:04.110> there<00:03:04.440> could

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
have a major value to it now there could

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.470 
have a major value to it now there could
be<00:03:04.650> a<00:03:04.799> lot<00:03:05.010> more<00:03:05.069> shapes<00:03:05.580> than<00:03:05.819> this<00:03:05.970> or<00:03:06.180> there

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
be a lot more shapes than this or there

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.870 
be a lot more shapes than this or there
can<00:03:06.660> be<00:03:06.720> a<00:03:06.840> lot<00:03:07.080> less<00:03:07.380> shapes<00:03:07.739> than<00:03:08.010> this<00:03:08.190> but

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
can be a lot less shapes than this but

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.729 
can be a lot less shapes than this but
this<00:03:09.060> is<00:03:09.120> that<00:03:09.480> the<00:03:09.630> first<00:03:09.930> part<00:03:10.440> of<00:03:10.620> this

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
this is that the first part of this

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:13.550 
this is that the first part of this
tutorial<00:03:11.010> is<00:03:11.630> looking<00:03:12.630> for<00:03:12.930> these<00:03:13.019> basic

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
tutorial is looking for these basic

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.280 
tutorial is looking for these basic
shapes<00:03:13.860> and<00:03:14.190> then<00:03:14.700> once<00:03:15.060> you<00:03:15.299> draw<00:03:15.599> the<00:03:15.660> basic

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
shapes and then once you draw the basic

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.080 
shapes and then once you draw the basic
shapes<00:03:16.590> and<00:03:16.830> I<00:03:16.980> don't<00:03:17.160> know<00:03:17.250> it<00:03:17.519> depends<00:03:17.940> on

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
shapes and I don't know it depends on

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:19.280 
shapes and I don't know it depends on
how<00:03:18.209> long<00:03:18.359> you<00:03:18.510> want<00:03:18.540> to<00:03:18.750> spend<00:03:19.019> on<00:03:19.170> the

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
how long you want to spend on the

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:20.569 
how long you want to spend on the
drawing<00:03:19.500> if<00:03:19.709> you<00:03:19.799> want<00:03:19.980> to<00:03:20.070> spend<00:03:20.280> like<00:03:20.459> an

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:20.579 
drawing if you want to spend like an

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:21.770 
drawing if you want to spend like an
hour<00:03:20.730> maybe<00:03:21.060> you<00:03:21.180> want<00:03:21.329> to<00:03:21.390> spend<00:03:21.570> three<00:03:21.750> hours

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
hour maybe you want to spend three hours

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.199 
hour maybe you want to spend three hours
maybe<00:03:22.170> you<00:03:22.260> want<00:03:22.410> to<00:03:22.470> spend<00:03:22.709> six<00:03:23.010> hours<00:03:23.209> once

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
maybe you want to spend six hours once

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:26.330 
maybe you want to spend six hours once
you<00:03:24.420> draw<00:03:24.870> those<00:03:25.140> shapes<00:03:25.500> then<00:03:25.920> what<00:03:26.190> you've

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
you draw those shapes then what you've

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:30.470 
you draw those shapes then what you've
got<00:03:26.549> to<00:03:26.670> do<00:03:26.820> is<00:03:27.060> start<00:03:27.959> to<00:03:28.730> match<00:03:29.730> the<00:03:30.090> values

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
got to do is start to match the values

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.080 
got to do is start to match the values
of<00:03:30.540> those<00:03:30.959> basic<00:03:31.470> shapes<00:03:31.769> don't<00:03:32.220> get<00:03:32.549> into<00:03:32.970> the

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
of those basic shapes don't get into the

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.010 
lot of reflection the other thing that

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:36.770 
lot of reflection the other thing that
you<00:04:35.160> want<00:04:35.520> to<00:04:35.580> take<00:04:35.790> into<00:04:36.030> consideration<00:04:36.660> when

you want to take into consideration when

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:38.390 
you want to take into consideration when
you're<00:04:36.960> drawing<00:04:37.140> glasses<00:04:37.770> you<00:04:37.890> really<00:04:38.190> want

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400 
you're drawing glasses you really want

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.970 
you're drawing glasses you really want
to<00:04:38.490> put<00:04:38.730> some<00:04:38.970> severe<00:04:39.810> value<00:04:40.350> contrast

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:40.980 
to put some severe value contrast

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:43.670 
to put some severe value contrast
somewhere<00:04:41.610> in<00:04:41.940> the<00:04:42.150> glass<00:04:42.480> like<00:04:43.170> you<00:04:43.320> want<00:04:43.560> to

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680 
somewhere in the glass like you want to

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.010 
somewhere in the glass like you want to
put<00:04:43.890> a<00:04:44.070> white<00:04:44.460> highlight<00:04:45.150> next<00:04:45.660> to<00:04:45.810> your

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:46.020 
put a white highlight next to your

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:48.970 
put a white highlight next to your
darkest<00:04:46.650> dark<00:04:46.980> and<00:04:47.250> I<00:04:47.850> think<00:04:48.180> that<00:04:48.390> really

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:48.980 
darkest dark and I think that really

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:51.710 
darkest dark and I think that really
adds<00:04:49.980> to<00:04:50.550> the<00:04:50.760> shininess<00:04:51.270> and<00:04:51.630> the

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.720 
adds to the shininess and the

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.470 
adds to the shininess and the
reflectiveness<00:04:52.410> of<00:04:52.860> the<00:04:53.490> glass<00:04:53.760> itself<00:04:54.030> I

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:54.480 
reflectiveness of the glass itself I

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:57.350 
reflectiveness of the glass itself I
mean<00:04:54.810> we<00:04:54.990> we<00:04:55.290> juxtapose<00:04:55.650> the<00:04:55.980> glass<00:04:56.490> against

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360 
mean we we juxtapose the glass against

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:02.720 
mean we we juxtapose the glass against
that<00:04:57.540> dull<00:04:58.250> excuse<00:04:59.250> me<00:05:00.230> pine<00:05:01.230> table<00:05:01.710> and<00:05:02.190> the

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:02.730 
that dull excuse me pine table and the

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:05.210 
that dull excuse me pine table and the
pine<00:05:02.970> table<00:05:03.270> is<00:05:03.540> really<00:05:04.080> not<00:05:04.260> that<00:05:04.500> shiny<00:05:04.919> and

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:05.220 
pine table is really not that shiny and

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:07.940 
pine table is really not that shiny and
the<00:05:05.760> glasses<00:05:06.060> is<00:05:06.480> really<00:05:06.960> shiny<00:05:07.290> so<00:05:07.590> we're

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:07.950 
the glasses is really shiny so we're

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:10.640 
the glasses is really shiny so we're
trying<00:05:08.250> to<00:05:08.400> show<00:05:08.669> how<00:05:09.060> you<00:05:09.120> do<00:05:09.540> that<00:05:09.780> and<00:05:09.990> I
