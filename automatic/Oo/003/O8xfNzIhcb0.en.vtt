which is NBA Live let's try that one two
three<00:01:18.420> and<00:01:19.369> we<00:01:20.369> go<00:01:23.960> pretty<00:01:24.960> close<00:01:25.200> isn't<00:01:25.470> it

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:29.119 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:33.320 

there<00:01:30.119> we<00:01:30.210> go<00:01:30.390> um<00:01:31.759> no<00:01:32.759> difference<00:01:33.210> really

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:33.330 
there we go um no difference really

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.020 
there we go um no difference really
between<00:01:33.570> one<00:01:34.050> and<00:01:34.080> the<00:01:34.229> other<00:01:34.350> and<00:01:34.680> let's<00:01:35.670> try

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
between one and the other and let's try

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.740 
between one and the other and let's try
something<00:01:36.300> else<00:01:37.070> try<00:01:38.070> FIFA<00:01:38.670> that's<00:01:38.850> a<00:01:39.060> again<00:01:39.720> a

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
iphone I've noticed this before the

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.090 
iphone I've noticed this before the
iphone<00:01:49.860> seems<00:01:50.130> to<00:01:50.310> be<00:01:50.430> just<00:01:50.700> a<00:01:50.970> tiny<00:01:51.510> little

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
iphone seems to be just a tiny little

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:58.160 
iphone seems to be just a tiny little
tiny<00:01:53.100> bit<00:01:53.730> faster<00:01:54.420> not<00:01:55.230> anything<00:01:55.470> that<00:01:57.170> you

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
tiny bit faster not anything that you

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.540 
tiny bit faster not anything that you
would<00:01:58.530> mind<00:01:58.770> but<00:01:59.190> just<00:01:59.670> slightly<00:02:00.090> faster<00:02:01.550> but

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:02.550 
would mind but just slightly faster but

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:04.940 
would mind but just slightly faster but
I've<00:02:02.729> played<00:02:02.760> in<00:02:03.390> both<00:02:03.720> of<00:02:03.930> them<00:02:04.080> and<00:02:04.290> the

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
I've played in both of them and the

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.430 
I've played in both of them and the
actual<00:02:05.190> gameplay<00:02:05.490> is<00:02:06.060> is<00:02:06.420> absolutely<00:02:07.020> fluent

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440 
actual gameplay is is absolutely fluent

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.830 
actual gameplay is is absolutely fluent
there's<00:02:07.620> no<00:02:07.770> problems<00:02:08.130> whatsoever<00:02:08.660> let's<00:02:09.660> try

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
there's no problems whatsoever let's try

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.009 
there's no problems whatsoever let's try
even<00:02:10.080> it<00:02:10.229> a<00:02:10.260> heavier<00:02:10.860> one<00:02:11.570> explain<00:02:12.570> which<00:02:12.810> is

00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:13.019 
even it a heavier one explain which is

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:14.660 
even it a heavier one explain which is
one<00:02:13.380> of<00:02:13.410> the<00:02:13.500> first<00:02:13.769> that<00:02:14.100> really<00:02:14.489> was<00:02:14.640> the

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
one of the first that really was the

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.979 
one of the first that really was the
first<00:02:15.060> a<00:02:15.330> real<00:02:16.400> flight<00:02:17.400> simulation<00:02:18.000> game<00:02:18.180> for

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
first a real flight simulation game for

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:25.729 
first a real flight simulation game for
the<00:02:19.080> iphone<00:02:19.340> let's<00:02:20.340> open<00:02:20.640> it<00:02:20.730> up<00:02:24.320> let's<00:02:25.320> upside

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
the iphone let's open it up let's upside

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:27.320 
the iphone let's open it up let's upside
down<00:02:25.950> but<00:02:26.130> it<00:02:26.220> doesn't<00:02:26.430> really<00:02:26.519> matter<00:02:26.730> in

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
down but it doesn't really matter in

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:28.970 
down but it doesn't really matter in
person<00:02:27.780> reasons<00:02:28.140> so<00:02:28.440> there<00:02:28.590> we<00:02:28.680> go<00:02:28.709> the<00:02:28.950> eye

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
person reasons so there we go the eye

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.880 
person reasons so there we go the eye
again<00:02:29.489> the<00:02:29.640> iphone<00:02:30.000> is<00:02:30.030> slightly<00:02:30.540> quicker<00:02:30.930> and

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.440 

now<00:02:34.890> let's<00:02:35.160> try<00:02:35.370> something<00:02:35.610> different<00:02:35.970> we've

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
now let's try something different we've

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.660 
now let's try something different we've
just<00:02:36.750> tried<00:02:37.110> to<00:02:37.260> test<00:02:37.500> really<00:02:37.739> the<00:02:37.980> processor

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
just tried to test really the processor

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.729 
just tried to test really the processor
here<00:02:38.880> now<00:02:39.390> they<00:02:39.540> both<00:02:39.720> connected<00:02:40.230> to<00:02:40.350> the<00:02:40.470> same

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
here now they both connected to the same

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:42.949 
here now they both connected to the same
Wi-Fi<00:02:40.980> network<00:02:41.299> so<00:02:42.299> there<00:02:42.510> should<00:02:42.690> be<00:02:42.720> no

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
Wi-Fi network so there should be no

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:45.650 
Wi-Fi network so there should be no
difference<00:02:43.350> there<00:02:43.709> and<00:02:43.950> even<00:02:44.670> though<00:02:44.790> we're

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
difference there and even though we're

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.270 
difference there and even though we're
really<00:02:45.840> all<00:02:45.930> of<00:02:46.049> them<00:02:46.260> have<00:02:46.530> or<00:02:46.769> both<00:02:46.980> of<00:02:47.010> them

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
really all of them have or both of them

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.070 
really all of them have or both of them
have<00:02:48.140> 80<00:02:49.140> 22<00:02:49.739> 11<00:02:50.010> n<00:02:50.220> so<00:02:50.430> again<00:02:50.780> they<00:02:51.780> are<00:02:51.900> on<00:02:51.959> the

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
have 80 22 11 n so again they are on the

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.210 
have 80 22 11 n so again they are on the
same

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
same

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.520 
same
on<00:02:53.580> same<00:02:53.910> hardware<00:02:54.390> really<00:02:54.540> that's<00:02:54.840> just<00:02:54.930> see

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
on same hardware really that's just see

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.950 
on same hardware really that's just see
if<00:02:55.590> that<00:02:55.800> reflects<00:02:56.250> I<00:02:56.640> will<00:02:57.450> just<00:02:57.630> try<00:02:57.840> and

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:57.960 
if that reflects I will just try and

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:02.000 
if that reflects I will just try and
load<00:02:58.200> a<00:02:58.610> couple<00:02:59.610> of<00:03:00.350> couple<00:03:01.350> of<00:03:01.530> links<00:03:01.800> here

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
load a couple of couple of links here

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.940 
load a couple of couple of links here
see<00:03:02.670> perhaps<00:03:02.880> this<00:03:03.270> one<00:03:03.450> over<00:03:03.600> here<00:03:03.660> one<00:03:04.560> two

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
see perhaps this one over here one two

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:16.490 
see perhaps this one over here one two
three<00:03:06.860> you<00:03:07.860> fit<00:03:08.190> both<00:03:10.850> so<00:03:14.840> the<00:03:15.840> loading<00:03:16.290> as<00:03:16.410> you

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
three you fit both so the loading as you

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:25.300 
three you fit both so the loading as you
can<00:03:16.680> see

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.750 
maybe a bit of flash there the long page
isn't<00:03:34.110> it<00:03:36.920> then<00:03:37.920> if<00:03:38.069> they're<00:03:38.250> actually<00:03:38.610> going

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
isn't it then if they're actually going

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.089 
isn't it then if they're actually going
to<00:03:38.879> finish<00:03:39.090> it<00:03:39.209> out<00:03:39.739> let's<00:03:40.739> try<00:03:40.829> something

00:03:41.089 --> 00:03:41.099 
to finish it out let's try something

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:45.830 
to finish it out let's try something
different<00:03:43.640> let's<00:03:44.640> try<00:03:44.849> our<00:03:45.299> own<00:03:45.629> web-page

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
different let's try our own web-page

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.440 
different let's try our own web-page
maybe<00:03:46.470> talking<00:03:46.890> apple<00:03:47.280> look<00:03:47.430> Cody<00:03:47.670> UK<00:03:48.060> see

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
maybe talking apple look Cody UK see

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:52.160 
maybe talking apple look Cody UK see
what<00:03:48.629> that<00:03:49.400> but<00:03:50.400> how<00:03:50.640> that<00:03:50.849> shows<00:03:51.120> up<00:03:51.299> talking

Apple<00:03:57.079> the<00:03:58.079> iphone<00:03:58.440> was<00:03:58.590> actually<00:03:59.010> quite<00:03:59.190> a

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
Apple the iphone was actually quite a

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:02.059 
Apple the iphone was actually quite a
bit<00:03:59.549> faster<00:04:00.230> maybe<00:04:01.230> has<00:04:01.500> to<00:04:01.650> do<00:04:01.799> with<00:04:01.950> the<00:04:02.040> fact

00:04:02.059 --> 00:04:02.069 
bit faster maybe has to do with the fact

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:05.479 
bit faster maybe has to do with the fact
that<00:04:02.400> or<00:04:03.060> how<00:04:03.389> these<00:04:03.659> seem<00:04:04.650> to<00:04:04.920> cache<00:04:05.459> the

that or how these seem to cache the

that or how these seem to cache the

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
pages but that was quite quite a bit

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:12.789 
pages but that was quite quite a bit
faster<00:04:09.150> and<00:04:10.489> let's<00:04:11.489> see<00:04:11.909> if<00:04:11.940> i'll<00:04:12.180> get<00:04:12.359> another

00:04:12.789 --> 00:04:12.799 
faster and let's see if i'll get another

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:17.590 
faster and let's see if i'll get another
another<00:04:13.879> link<00:04:14.879> that<00:04:15.239> I've<00:04:15.420> got<00:04:15.690> on<00:04:15.989> both

Insider<00:04:20.930> probably<00:04:21.930> the<00:04:22.049> iphone<00:04:22.350> might<00:04:22.530> lo<00:04:22.740> the

whatever that's about let's try this

there<00:04:53.940> we<00:04:54.030> go<00:04:54.240> pretty<00:04:54.990> much<00:04:55.080> at<00:04:55.229> the<00:04:55.289> same<00:04:55.560> time

00:04:59.800 --> 00:04:59.810 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:02.830 

and<00:05:00.810> the<00:05:01.080> iphone<00:05:01.199> seems<00:05:01.770> to<00:05:02.010> have<00:05:02.190> the<00:05:02.400> edge

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:02.840 
and the iphone seems to have the edge

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:07.279 
and the iphone seems to have the edge
just<00:05:03.840> about<00:05:04.910> they<00:05:05.910> both<00:05:06.120> finished<00:05:06.750> at<00:05:07.199> the

00:05:07.279 --> 00:05:07.289 
just about they both finished at the

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:09.439 
just about they both finished at the
same<00:05:07.500> time<00:05:07.680> I<00:05:07.830> mean<00:05:08.159> yes<00:05:08.580> the<00:05:08.789> iphone<00:05:08.820> might<00:05:09.270> be

00:05:09.439 --> 00:05:09.449 
same time I mean yes the iphone might be

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:12.350 
same time I mean yes the iphone might be
slightly<00:05:09.870> quicker<00:05:10.260> but<00:05:10.530> nothing<00:05:11.360> that's

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:12.360 
slightly quicker but nothing that's

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.390 
slightly quicker but nothing that's
substantial<00:05:13.289> and<00:05:13.710> I<00:05:13.800> think<00:05:14.010> really<00:05:14.159> that's

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:14.400 
substantial and I think really that's

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.990 
substantial and I think really that's
what<00:05:14.669> that's<00:05:15.000> what<00:05:15.090> I<00:05:15.240> take<00:05:15.539> out<00:05:15.750> of<00:05:15.870> this<00:05:17.000> out

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000 
what that's what I take out of this out

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.339 
what that's what I take out of this out
of<00:05:18.240> this<00:05:20.150> comparison<00:05:21.150> and<00:05:21.630> let<00:05:22.050> me<00:05:22.139> see<00:05:22.320> if

00:05:22.339 --> 00:05:22.349 
of this comparison and let me see if

00:05:22.349 --> 00:05:23.870 
of this comparison and let me see if
I've<00:05:22.530> got<00:05:22.560> some<00:05:22.979> okay<00:05:23.370> that<00:05:23.520> might<00:05:23.729> be

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:23.880 
I've got some okay that might be

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:26.659 
I've got some okay that might be
interesting<00:05:24.270> a<00:05:24.330> speed<00:05:24.630> test<00:05:25.099> unless<00:05:26.099> I<00:05:26.400> think

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:26.669 
interesting a speed test unless I think

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:28.580 
interesting a speed test unless I think
I've<00:05:26.789> got<00:05:26.940> the<00:05:26.970> same<00:05:27.210> speed<00:05:27.510> test<00:05:27.750> here<00:05:27.990> let's

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:28.590 
I've got the same speed test here let's

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:32.180 
I've got the same speed test here let's
try<00:05:28.919> it<00:05:28.979> out<00:05:30.050> so<00:05:31.050> I<00:05:31.409> don't<00:05:31.470> think<00:05:31.740> this<00:05:31.889> works

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:32.190 
try it out so I don't think this works

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:34.010 
try it out so I don't think this works
and<00:05:32.430> let's<00:05:32.610> go<00:05:32.789> to<00:05:32.849> let<00:05:33.030> me<00:05:33.120> try<00:05:33.330> and<00:05:33.360> just<00:05:33.570> put

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:34.020 
and let's go to let me try and just put

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:37.610 
and let's go to let me try and just put
it<00:05:34.139> here<00:05:34.169> in<00:05:34.909> portrait<00:05:35.909> mode<00:05:36.169> just<00:05:37.169> begin<00:05:37.590> to

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:37.620 
it here in portrait mode just begin to

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:42.909 
it here in portrait mode just begin to
test

00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:42.919 

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:45.200 

you<00:05:43.919> might<00:05:44.129> that<00:05:44.309> might<00:05:44.490> not<00:05:44.639> be<00:05:44.699> a<00:05:44.849> fair

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:45.210 
you might that might not be a fair

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:47.989 
you might that might not be a fair
comparison<00:05:45.659> because<00:05:46.080> you<00:05:46.349> get<00:05:46.620> AB<00:05:47.550> someone

00:05:47.989 --> 00:05:47.999 
comparison because you get AB someone

00:05:47.999 --> 00:05:50.540 
comparison because you get AB someone
just<00:05:48.240> sickening<00:05:48.719> all<00:05:48.979> the<00:05:49.979> other<00:05:50.159> one<00:05:50.339> bull

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:50.550 
just sickening all the other one bull

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:55.429 
just sickening all the other one bull
would<00:05:50.999> be<00:05:51.120> left<00:05:51.360> behind<00:05:54.110> so<00:05:55.110> you're<00:05:55.259> probably

00:05:55.429 --> 00:05:55.439 
would be left behind so you're probably

00:05:55.439 --> 00:05:59.420 
would be left behind so you're probably
not<00:05:55.710> the<00:05:55.830> best<00:05:55.860> of<00:05:56.129> comparisons<00:05:56.849> and<00:05:58.339> tell<00:05:59.339> you

00:05:59.420 --> 00:05:59.430 
not the best of comparisons and tell you

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:01.429 
not the best of comparisons and tell you
what<00:05:59.550> let<00:05:59.729> me<00:05:59.759> test<00:06:00.059> one<00:06:00.389> is<00:06:00.509> the<00:06:00.629> time<00:06:00.870> let's

00:06:01.429 --> 00:06:01.439 
what let me test one is the time let's

00:06:01.439 --> 00:06:08.629 
what let me test one is the time let's
try<00:06:01.650> the<00:06:01.710> ipad<00:06:02.129> now<00:06:05.059> as<00:06:06.650> you<00:06:07.650> can<00:06:07.770> see<00:06:07.830> my<00:06:08.129> Wi-Fi

00:06:08.629 --> 00:06:08.639 
try the ipad now as you can see my Wi-Fi

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:11.659 
try the ipad now as you can see my Wi-Fi
is<00:06:08.699> up<00:06:08.999> the<00:06:09.210> vests<00:06:09.870> my<00:06:10.439> network<00:06:10.830> my<00:06:11.219> internet

that's five and five thousand kilobits
per<00:06:17.370> second<00:06:18.469> down<00:06:19.469> and<00:06:20.240> about<00:06:21.620> 780<00:06:22.620> up<00:06:23.249> let's

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:23.610 
per second down and about 780 up let's

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:33.829 
per second down and about 780 up let's
try<00:06:23.819> the<00:06:23.939> iphone<00:06:24.360> now<00:06:32.419> it's<00:06:33.419> quite<00:06:33.629> a<00:06:33.659> bit

00:06:33.829 --> 00:06:33.839 
try the iphone now it's quite a bit

00:06:33.839 --> 00:06:37.700 
try the iphone now it's quite a bit
slower<00:06:34.669> then<00:06:35.669> again<00:06:35.969> that<00:06:36.180> that's<00:06:37.110> not<00:06:37.409> just

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:37.710 
slower then again that that's not just

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:40.249 
slower then again that that's not just
up<00:06:37.889> to<00:06:37.919> the<00:06:38.129> firm<00:06:38.490> that's<00:06:39.300> how<00:06:39.539> the<00:06:39.599> actual

00:06:40.249 --> 00:06:40.259 
up to the firm that's how the actual

00:06:40.259 --> 00:06:44.089 
up to the firm that's how the actual
route<00:06:41.270> is<00:06:42.270> actually<00:06:43.229> doing<00:06:43.379> which<00:06:43.800> by<00:06:43.949> the<00:06:44.009> way

00:06:44.089 --> 00:06:44.099 
route is actually doing which by the way

00:06:44.099 --> 00:06:47.269 
route is actually doing which by the way
is<00:06:44.189> an<00:06:44.370> airport<00:06:44.639> express<00:06:44.939> anyway<00:06:45.979> but<00:06:46.979> as<00:06:47.129> we

00:06:47.269 --> 00:06:47.279 
is an airport express anyway but as we

00:06:47.279 --> 00:06:48.889 
is an airport express anyway but as we
can<00:06:47.370> see<00:06:47.430> in<00:06:47.669> the<00:06:47.729> web<00:06:47.849> pages<00:06:48.029> actually<00:06:48.419> loads

00:06:48.889 --> 00:06:48.899 
can see in the web pages actually loads

00:06:48.899 --> 00:06:50.929 
can see in the web pages actually loads
pretty<00:06:49.199> much<00:06:49.349> the<00:06:49.529> same<00:06:49.770> at<00:06:50.129> the<00:06:50.310> same<00:06:50.520> speed

00:06:50.929 --> 00:06:50.939 
pretty much the same at the same speed

00:06:50.939 --> 00:06:54.860 
pretty much the same at the same speed
and<00:06:51.319> we<00:06:52.319> have<00:06:52.409> to<00:06:52.620> mention<00:06:52.800> that<00:06:53.389> if<00:06:54.389> you<00:06:54.569> if

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:54.870 
and we have to mention that if you if

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:56.719 
and we have to mention that if you if
you<00:06:54.990> were<00:06:55.139> to<00:06:55.259> compare<00:06:55.409> this<00:06:55.740> to<00:06:55.919> an<00:06:56.009> iphone<00:06:56.310> 3g

00:06:56.719 --> 00:06:56.729 
you were to compare this to an iphone 3g

00:06:56.729 --> 00:06:57.920 
you were to compare this to an iphone 3g
which<00:06:56.909> we're<00:06:57.089> actually<00:06:57.180> going<00:06:57.509> to<00:06:57.599> compare<00:06:57.870> it

00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:57.930 
which we're actually going to compare it

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:00.019 
which we're actually going to compare it
and<00:06:58.199> put<00:06:58.740> a<00:06:58.770> video<00:06:58.979> down<00:06:59.249> on<00:06:59.370> youtube<00:06:59.729> soon

00:07:00.019 --> 00:07:00.029 
and put a video down on youtube soon

00:07:00.029 --> 00:07:02.389 
and put a video down on youtube soon
you'll<00:07:00.599> see<00:07:00.899> that<00:07:01.050> it's<00:07:01.199> not<00:07:01.349> just<00:07:01.409> network

00:07:02.389 --> 00:07:02.399 
you'll see that it's not just network

00:07:02.399 --> 00:07:03.949 
you'll see that it's not just network
that<00:07:02.580> you're<00:07:02.759> getting<00:07:03.029> but<00:07:03.149> it's<00:07:03.330> how<00:07:03.629> fast

00:07:03.949 --> 00:07:03.959 
that you're getting but it's how fast

00:07:03.959 --> 00:07:06.019 
that you're getting but it's how fast
the<00:07:04.649> phone<00:07:04.860> is<00:07:05.009> able<00:07:05.249> to<00:07:05.370> process<00:07:05.669> the

00:07:06.019 --> 00:07:06.029 
the phone is able to process the

00:07:06.029 --> 00:07:07.670 
the phone is able to process the
information<00:07:06.209> that's<00:07:06.569> coming<00:07:06.839> through<00:07:06.959> so

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:07.680 
information that's coming through so

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:08.929 
information that's coming through so
really<00:07:07.919> that's<00:07:08.009> the<00:07:08.159> comparison<00:07:08.639> for<00:07:08.819> now<00:07:08.909> I

00:07:08.929 --> 00:07:08.939 
really that's the comparison for now I

00:07:08.939 --> 00:07:10.399 
really that's the comparison for now I
hope<00:07:09.060> you<00:07:09.300> enjoy<00:07:09.599> that<00:07:09.839> it<00:07:09.930> gives<00:07:10.080> you<00:07:10.199> an<00:07:10.319> idea
