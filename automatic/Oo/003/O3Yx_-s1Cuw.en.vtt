00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.490 
give you know let Louie Nico go past
that<00:01:59.939> was<00:02:00.060> not<00:02:00.270> his<00:02:00.420> right<00:02:00.719> you<00:02:01.079> know<00:02:01.200> Nico

that was not his right you know Nico

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.050 
that was not his right you know Nico
could<00:02:01.740> have<00:02:01.829> overtook<00:02:02.250> him<00:02:02.460> if<00:02:02.640> he<00:02:02.729> wanted<00:02:02.939> to

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
could have overtook him if he wanted to

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.910 
could have overtook him if he wanted to
get<00:02:03.180> past<00:02:03.479> and<00:02:03.899> they're<00:02:04.439> fighting<00:02:04.770> for<00:02:04.860> the

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
get past and they're fighting for the

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.350 
get past and they're fighting for the
championship<00:02:05.130> especially<00:02:06.090> in<00:02:06.180> situations

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
championship especially in situations

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.809 
championship especially in situations
like<00:02:06.810> this<00:02:07.079> where<00:02:07.250> Hamilton<00:02:08.250> had<00:02:08.369> to<00:02:08.520> retire

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
like this where Hamilton had to retire

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.029 
like this where Hamilton had to retire
you<00:02:09.119> know<00:02:09.239> if<00:02:09.390> he<00:02:09.509> had<00:02:09.599> given<00:02:09.780> that<00:02:10.560> position

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
you know if he had given that position

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.890 
you know if he had given that position
away<00:02:11.250> he<00:02:11.520> would<00:02:11.670> have<00:02:11.760> lost<00:02:11.879> points<00:02:12.209> and<00:02:12.569> a<00:02:12.720> lot

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
away he would have lost points and a lot

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.760 
away he would have lost points and a lot
of<00:02:12.930> them

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
of them

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.290 
of them
I<00:02:13.830> think<00:02:14.220> that<00:02:14.460> you<00:02:14.550> know<00:02:14.700> he<00:02:14.940> did<00:02:15.150> the<00:02:15.270> right

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
I think that you know he did the right

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.540 
I think that you know he did the right
thing<00:02:15.720> and<00:02:15.870> hungry<00:02:16.260> Nico<00:02:17.070> was<00:02:17.190> obviously<00:02:17.490> very

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
thing and hungry Nico was obviously very

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.760 
thing and hungry Nico was obviously very
upset<00:02:17.820> about<00:02:18.420> all<00:02:18.630> of<00:02:18.780> that<00:02:18.930> and<00:02:19.260> I<00:02:19.350> think<00:02:19.380> that

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
upset about all of that and I think that

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.980 
upset about all of that and I think that
has<00:02:19.800> somehow<00:02:20.340> carried<00:02:20.910> on<00:02:21.090> to<00:02:21.270> this<00:02:21.450> race<00:02:21.720> and

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
has somehow carried on to this race and

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.880 
has somehow carried on to this race and
if<00:02:22.110> this<00:02:22.410> is<00:02:22.590> true<00:02:22.980> which<00:02:23.910> it<00:02:24.090> could<00:02:24.210> be<00:02:24.380> then<00:02:25.380> I

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
if this is true which it could be then I

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.350 
if this is true which it could be then I
think<00:02:26.220> it's<00:02:26.340> a<00:02:26.460> shame<00:02:26.490> and<00:02:26.880> I<00:02:26.940> think<00:02:27.180> that's

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
think it's a shame and I think that's

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.630 
think it's a shame and I think that's
you<00:02:27.960> know<00:02:27.990> that<00:02:28.260> then<00:02:28.500> points<00:02:28.980> fingers<00:02:29.400> back

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
you know that then points fingers back

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.000 
you know that then points fingers back
to<00:02:29.820> Monaco<00:02:30.240> and<00:02:30.480> I<00:02:30.570> think<00:02:30.780> that<00:02:30.990> in<00:02:31.200> terms<00:02:31.230> of<00:02:31.680> a

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
to Monaco and I think that in terms of a

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.880 
to Monaco and I think that in terms of a
drivers<00:02:32.610> reputation<00:02:33.210> it's<00:02:33.540> it's<00:02:34.380> not<00:02:34.590> good

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
drivers reputation it's it's not good

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.830 
drivers reputation it's it's not good
especially<00:02:35.130> for<00:02:35.550> the<00:02:35.790> team<00:02:36.030> now<00:02:36.360> try<00:02:36.660> to<00:02:36.690> a

of that tire that he hit that caused the

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:06.980 
of that tire that he hit that caused the
puncture<00:03:06.060> you<00:03:06.180> know<00:03:06.300> there<00:03:06.480> was<00:03:06.570> a<00:03:06.600> there's

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:06.990 
puncture you know there was a there's

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:08.540

another<00:03:07.200> little<00:03:07.410> front<00:03:07.860> wing<00:03:08.070> incident

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550 
another little front wing incident

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:11.270 
another little front wing incident
between<00:03:08.760> Vettel<00:03:09.720> and<00:03:09.750> Alonso<00:03:10.290> but<00:03:10.590> Vettel<00:03:11.100> did

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
between Vettel and Alonso but Vettel did

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.760 
between Vettel and Alonso but Vettel did
not<00:03:11.430> get<00:03:11.610> a<00:03:11.640> puncture<00:03:11.910> and<00:03:12.390> it<00:03:13.260> was<00:03:13.380> Hamilton

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:13.770 
not get a puncture and it was Hamilton

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:16.400 
not get a puncture and it was Hamilton
that<00:03:13.920> did<00:03:14.130> and<00:03:14.340> I<00:03:14.460> think<00:03:14.730> that<00:03:15.060> if<00:03:16.020> it<00:03:16.260> was<00:03:16.380> on

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
that did and I think that if it was on

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.740 
that did and I think that if it was on
purpose<00:03:16.680> that<00:03:17.160> is<00:03:17.190> really<00:03:18.000> that's<00:03:18.330> very

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
purpose that is really that's very

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.580 
purpose that is really that's very
naughty<00:03:18.959> that's<00:03:19.530> that<00:03:20.070> just<00:03:20.370> isn't<00:03:20.580> right<00:03:21.590> but

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
naughty that's that just isn't right but

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.890 
naughty that's that just isn't right but
