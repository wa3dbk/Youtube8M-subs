that

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:19.420 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:24.550 

okay<00:01:20.890> once<00:01:21.890> that's<00:01:22.190> done<00:01:23.110> we're<00:01:24.110> going<00:01:24.290> to<00:01:24.410> use

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
okay once that's done we're going to use

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.820 
okay once that's done we're going to use
a<00:01:24.590> small<00:01:24.950> sharp<00:01:25.250> knife<00:01:25.310> to<00:01:25.460> score

through<00:01:27.830> the<00:01:28.040> thicker<00:01:28.370> part<00:01:28.760> of<00:01:28.910> the

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
through the thicker part of the

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.570 
through the thicker part of the
butternut<00:01:29.330> squash<00:01:29.650> now<00:01:30.650> the<00:01:30.920> reason<00:01:31.280> we<00:01:31.460> do

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:31.580 
butternut squash now the reason we do

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:34.060 
butternut squash now the reason we do
this<00:01:31.790> is<00:01:32.000> because<00:01:32.300> this<00:01:33.110> part<00:01:33.380> is<00:01:33.590> obviously

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 
this is because this part is obviously

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.670 
this is because this part is obviously
way<00:01:34.280> thinner<00:01:34.550> than<00:01:35.210> this<00:01:35.390> bit<00:01:35.630> so<00:01:35.840> in<00:01:36.560> order

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:36.680 
way thinner than this bit so in order

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.430 
way thinner than this bit so in order
that<00:01:36.980> they're<00:01:37.100> going<00:01:37.250> to<00:01:37.310> be<00:01:37.400> cooked<00:01:37.670> and<00:01:38.440> for

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:39.440 
that they're going to be cooked and for

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.110 
that they're going to be cooked and for
the<00:01:39.500> same<00:01:39.710> length<00:01:39.920> of<00:01:40.070> time<00:01:40.130> and<00:01:40.850> they'll<00:01:41.000> be

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:41.120 
the same length of time and they'll be

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.690 
the same length of time and they'll be
solved<00:01:41.450> all<00:01:41.630> at<00:01:41.780> the<00:01:41.870> same<00:01:42.050> time<00:01:42.290> if<00:01:43.250> you<00:01:43.430> cut

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
solved all at the same time if you cut

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.210 
solved all at the same time if you cut
through<00:01:43.850> it'll<00:01:44.210> just<00:01:44.470> take<00:01:45.470> less<00:01:45.740> time<00:01:45.770> in<00:01:46.190> the

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:46.220 
through it'll just take less time in the

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.700 
through it'll just take less time in the
oven<00:01:46.310> as<00:01:46.670> well<00:01:46.960> therefore<00:01:47.960> saving<00:01:48.410> you<00:01:48.590> on

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
oven as well therefore saving you on

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:53.610 
oven as well therefore saving you on
electricity<00:01:50.530> okay<00:01:51.640> once<00:01:52.640> you've<00:01:52.820> done<00:01:52.940> this

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:53.620 
electricity okay once you've done this

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:58.360 
electricity okay once you've done this
all<00:01:54.620> you<00:01:54.800> do<00:01:54.920> is<00:01:55.160> place<00:01:55.610> them<00:01:56.620> on<00:01:57.620> a<00:01:57.950> roasting

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:58.370 
all you do is place them on a roasting

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:06.270 
all you do is place them on a roasting
tray<00:02:00.580> like<00:02:01.580> this<00:02:04.420> pop<00:02:05.420> them<00:02:05.600> in<00:02:05.720> the<00:02:05.810> oven

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 
tray like this pop them in the oven

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.600 
tray like this pop them in the oven
approximately<00:02:07.720> 150<00:02:08.720> to<00:02:08.810> 175<00:02:09.470> degrees<00:02:09.830> just<00:02:10.490> as

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
approximately 150 to 175 degrees just as

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.980 
approximately 150 to 175 degrees just as
mark<00:02:10.820> 6<00:02:11.090> or<00:02:11.270> 7<00:02:11.630> for<00:02:13.120> approximately<00:02:14.120> 45<00:02:14.810> minutes

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:14.990 
mark 6 or 7 for approximately 45 minutes

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:16.750 
mark 6 or 7 for approximately 45 minutes
now<00:02:15.470> very<00:02:15.739> much<00:02:15.860> depends<00:02:16.220> on<00:02:16.250> the<00:02:16.370> size<00:02:16.610> of

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
now very much depends on the size of

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.460 
now very much depends on the size of
your<00:02:16.820> butternut<00:02:17.239> squash<00:02:17.480> sometimes<00:02:18.290> they'll

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
your butternut squash sometimes they'll

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.500 
your butternut squash sometimes they'll
take<00:02:18.620> 55<00:02:19.100> minutes<00:02:19.430> sometimes<00:02:19.610> I'll<00:02:19.910> take<00:02:20.090> 45

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
take 55 minutes sometimes I'll take 45

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.170 
take 55 minutes sometimes I'll take 45
40<00:02:20.959> minutes<00:02:21.230> just<00:02:21.760> when<00:02:22.760> you<00:02:22.850> think<00:02:23.060> they're

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
40 minutes just when you think they're

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.000 
40 minutes just when you think they're
ready<00:02:23.300> squeeze<00:02:24.230> them<00:02:24.410> a<00:02:24.470> little<00:02:24.680> bit<00:02:24.770> in<00:02:24.890> at

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010

the side and if they're quite soft so to

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.990 
the side and if they're quite soft so to
the<00:02:27.050> middle<00:02:27.260> then<00:02:27.560> they're<00:02:27.709> ready<00:02:27.860> okay<00:02:31.000> now

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
the middle then they're ready okay now

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.460
