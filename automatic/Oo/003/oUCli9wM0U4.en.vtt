pretty early usually usually have to

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.249 
pretty early usually usually have to
wait<00:00:23.340> about<00:00:23.460> three<00:00:24.270> to<00:00:24.390> six<00:00:24.420> months<00:00:24.689> to<00:00:25.020> find

00:00:25.249 --> 00:00:25.259 
wait about three to six months to find

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:29.179 
wait about three to six months to find
it<00:00:25.910> but<00:00:26.910> I<00:00:26.970> found<00:00:27.180> this<00:00:27.270> pretty<00:00:27.599> early<00:00:27.989> so<00:00:28.950> this

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
it but I found this pretty early so this

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.300 
it but I found this pretty early so this
is<00:00:29.400> Rockstar<00:00:30.390> punched<00:00:30.989> blue<00:00:31.980> raspberry

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:32.310 
is Rockstar punched blue raspberry

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:35.120 
is Rockstar punched blue raspberry
flavor<00:00:32.970> so<00:00:33.390> first<00:00:34.170> of<00:00:34.260> all<00:00:34.320> I<00:00:34.530> can't<00:00:34.860> really<00:00:35.100> I

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
flavor so first of all I can't really I

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.380 
flavor so first of all I can't really I
have<00:00:35.399> my<00:00:35.579> brightness<00:00:35.820> down<00:00:36.060> to<00:00:36.210> save

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
have my brightness down to save

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.210 
have my brightness down to save
batteries<00:00:36.780> but<00:00:37.020> so<00:00:37.560> I<00:00:37.620> can't<00:00:37.800> really<00:00:37.890> tell<00:00:38.070> how

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:38.220 
batteries but so I can't really tell how

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:39.590 
batteries but so I can't really tell how
well<00:00:38.309> you<00:00:38.430> can<00:00:38.550> see<00:00:38.610> this<00:00:38.880> but<00:00:39.059> the<00:00:39.210> can<00:00:39.420> is

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
well you can see this but the can is

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.340 
well you can see this but the can is
really<00:00:39.960> really<00:00:40.110> awesome<00:00:41.480> it's<00:00:42.480> a<00:00:42.750> blue<00:00:42.960> star<00:00:43.290> I

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
really really awesome it's a blue star I

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.810 
really really awesome it's a blue star I
think<00:00:43.800> this<00:00:43.860> is<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:44.010> only<00:00:44.160> rock<00:00:44.400> star<00:00:44.700> with<00:00:44.790> a

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
think this is the only rock star with a

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.510 
think this is the only rock star with a
blue<00:00:45.030> star<00:00:45.300> if<00:00:45.480> I<00:00:45.600> remember<00:00:45.930> correctly<00:00:46.520> and

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
blue star if I remember correctly and

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:53.030 
blue star if I remember correctly and
it's<00:00:47.760> got<00:00:47.970> a<00:00:48.740> blue<00:00:49.740> tab<00:00:49.980> as<00:00:50.190> well<00:00:50.420> and<00:00:51.740> the<00:00:52.740> back

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:53.040 
it's got a blue tab as well and the back

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.160 
it's got a blue tab as well and the back
is<00:00:53.310> the<00:00:53.550> same<00:00:53.760> sort<00:00:54.090> of<00:00:54.120> design<00:00:54.450> as<00:00:54.630> the<00:00:54.660> super

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
is the same sort of design as the super

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.520 
is the same sort of design as the super
sours<00:00:55.530> but<00:00:56.370> it's<00:00:56.610> blue<00:00:57.450> and<00:00:57.480> pink<00:00:57.870> so<00:00:58.170> it<00:00:58.290> looks

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
sours but it's blue and pink so it looks

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.850 
sours but it's blue and pink so it looks
really<00:00:59.510> this<00:01:00.510> how<00:01:00.690> this<00:01:00.870> design<00:01:01.260> almost<00:01:01.500> would

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:01.860 
really this how this design almost would

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.719 
really this how this design almost would
suit<00:01:02.100> a<00:01:02.190> cotton<00:01:02.550> candy<00:01:02.730> flavor<00:01:04.460> but<00:01:05.460> yeah<00:01:05.579> the

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
suit a cotton candy flavor but yeah the

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.300 
suit a cotton candy flavor but yeah the
can<00:01:05.909> is<00:01:06.060> really<00:01:06.479> really<00:01:06.630> nice<00:01:06.840> on<00:01:07.140> let's<00:01:08.100> crack

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
can is really really nice on let's crack

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.810 
can is really really nice on let's crack
it<00:01:08.340> open<00:01:08.520> I<00:01:10.400> think<00:01:11.400> this<00:01:11.490> should<00:01:11.610> be<00:01:11.729> pretty

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
it open I think this should be pretty

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:19.340 
it open I think this should be pretty
good<00:01:16.880> usually<00:01:17.880> anything<00:01:18.240> blue<00:01:18.659> raspberry<00:01:18.899> is

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
good usually anything blue raspberry is

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:27.180 
good usually anything blue raspberry is
good<00:01:19.920> I<00:01:20.159> guess

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:27.190 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:36.300 

ooh<00:01:33.060> I<00:01:34.410> don't<00:01:35.410> know<00:01:35.530> what<00:01:35.680> that<00:01:35.710> is<00:01:35.830> but<00:01:36.160> that's

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.260 
not really all that blue raspberry ish
my<00:01:42.850> first<00:01:43.120> reaction<00:01:44.370> when<00:01:45.370> I<00:01:45.430> smelled<00:01:45.850> it<00:01:46.030> was

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.270 
my first reaction when I smelled it was

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:51.600 
my first reaction when I smelled it was
um<00:01:47.260> the<00:01:47.920> grape<00:01:48.190> recovery<00:01:49.020> but<00:01:50.020> in<00:01:51.010> the<00:01:51.340> taste

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
um the grape recovery but in the taste

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:57.630 
um the grape recovery but in the taste
it's<00:01:51.940> a<00:01:52.090> little<00:01:52.420> bit<00:01:52.540> like<00:01:52.690> that<00:01:52.930> but<00:01:56.640> there's

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 
it's a little bit like that but there's

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.300 
it's a little bit like that but there's
almost<00:01:57.760> like<00:01:57.910> a<00:01:58.000> bit<00:01:58.240> of<00:01:58.270> a<00:01:59.070> bubble<00:02:00.070> berry

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 
almost like a bit of a bubble berry

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.360 
almost like a bit of a bubble berry
which<00:02:00.580> is<00:02:00.730> the<00:02:00.880> Super's<00:02:01.540> hours<00:02:01.810> um<00:02:02.310> sort<00:02:03.310> of

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:03.370 
which is the Super's hours um sort of

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:06.660 
which is the Super's hours um sort of
flavor<00:02:03.640> to<00:02:03.820> it<00:02:04.030> too<00:02:04.390> it's<00:02:04.660> really<00:02:05.520> totally<00:02:06.520> not

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:06.670 
flavor to it too it's really totally not

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:08.550 
flavor to it too it's really totally not
a<00:02:06.700> blue<00:02:06.970> raspberry<00:02:07.180> in<00:02:07.750> my<00:02:07.870> opinion<00:02:08.170> and<00:02:08.440> then

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
a blue raspberry in my opinion and then

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.060 
a blue raspberry in my opinion and then
it's<00:02:08.770> also<00:02:09.010> totally<00:02:09.399> not<00:02:09.760> a<00:02:09.790> punch<00:02:10.179> um<00:02:11.170> I<00:02:11.410> think

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.070 
it's also totally not a punch um I think

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:13.620 
it's also totally not a punch um I think
generally<00:02:12.400> speaking<00:02:12.580> this<00:02:13.000> is<00:02:13.150> branded

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
generally speaking this is branded

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.710 
generally speaking this is branded
really<00:02:14.080> really<00:02:14.710> wrong<00:02:14.950> I<00:02:15.340> don't<00:02:16.240> think<00:02:16.480> it's<00:02:16.660> a

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
really really wrong I don't think it's a

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.140 
really really wrong I don't think it's a
blue<00:02:16.870> raspberry<00:02:17.080> or<00:02:17.530> punch<00:02:17.830> so<00:02:18.220> it's<00:02:18.940> kind<00:02:19.120> of

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
blue raspberry or punch so it's kind of

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.480 
blue raspberry or punch so it's kind of
a<00:02:19.270> double<00:02:19.570> fail<00:02:19.780> in<00:02:20.020> my<00:02:20.230> opinion<00:02:20.500> not<00:02:20.980> not<00:02:21.340> in

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:21.490 
a double fail in my opinion not not in

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:28.320 
a double fail in my opinion not not in
flavor<00:02:21.760> just<00:02:22.000> in<00:02:22.210> the<00:02:22.330> marketing<00:02:27.330> definitely

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
flavor just in the marketing definitely

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:33.920 
flavor just in the marketing definitely
got<00:02:28.420> a<00:02:28.830> great<00:02:29.830> sort<00:02:30.280> of<00:02:30.400> taste<00:02:31.290> um<00:02:32.700> bit<00:02:33.700> of<00:02:33.790> a

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
got a great sort of taste um bit of a

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.199 
got a great sort of taste um bit of a
the<00:02:34.930> aftertaste<00:02:35.470> is<00:02:35.920> more<00:02:36.220> weathera<00:02:36.760> the

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
the aftertaste is more weathera the

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:38.580 
the aftertaste is more weathera the
raspberry<00:02:37.750> comes<00:02:37.989> out<00:02:38.170> it's<00:02:38.320> like<00:02:38.440> the
