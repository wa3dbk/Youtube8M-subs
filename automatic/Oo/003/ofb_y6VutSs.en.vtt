00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
relatively low volume and we're going to

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.029 
relatively low volume and we're going to
see<00:00:53.969> what<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.270> pedal<00:00:54.539> can<00:00:54.690> do<00:00:54.840> so<00:00:55.230> this<00:00:55.829> is<00:00:55.920> my

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
see what the pedal can do so this is my

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:04.990 
see what the pedal can do so this is my
clean

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.000 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.130 

everything<00:01:06.000> on<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.180> pedal<00:01:06.450> is<00:01:06.630> a<00:01:06.660> 12<00:01:07.050> o'clock

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
everything on the pedal is a 12 o'clock

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.290 
everything on the pedal is a 12 o'clock
and<00:01:07.530> I'm<00:01:07.920> on<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.160> square<00:01:08.490> wave<00:01:08.670> which<00:01:09.030> means

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:09.300 
and I'm on the square wave which means

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:35.060 
and I'm on the square wave which means
the<00:01:09.450> button<00:01:09.750> there<00:01:09.930> is

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:42.210 

a

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:42.220 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.540 

okay<00:01:43.470> awesome<00:01:44.470> I<00:01:44.590> love<00:01:44.800> tremolo<00:01:45.220> I<00:01:45.250> think<00:01:45.460> it

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:45.550 
okay awesome I love tremolo I think it

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:47.280 
okay awesome I love tremolo I think it
sounds<00:01:45.790> fantastic<00:01:45.970> let's<00:01:46.480> just<00:01:46.630> switch<00:01:47.080> over

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:47.290 
sounds fantastic let's just switch over

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:51.640 
sounds fantastic let's just switch over
now<00:01:47.470> to<00:01:47.590> the<00:01:47.770> triangle<00:01:48.340> wave

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:51.650 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:56.069 

you

00:01:56.069 --> 00:01:56.079 

00:01:56.079 --> 00:02:06.030 

and<00:01:57.159> back<00:01:58.159> to<00:01:58.310> the<00:01:58.399> square<00:01:58.640> wave

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:06.040 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.710 

so<00:02:07.040> both<00:02:07.370> modes<00:02:07.700> sound<00:02:08.060> great<00:02:08.360> we're<00:02:08.540> going<00:02:08.660> to

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
so both modes sound great we're going to

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.030 
so both modes sound great we're going to
go<00:02:08.810> ahead<00:02:08.930> and<00:02:09.200> tweak<00:02:09.440> some<00:02:09.649> of<00:02:09.680> the<00:02:09.800> knobs

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:10.040 
go ahead and tweak some of the knobs

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:12.580 
go ahead and tweak some of the knobs
here<00:02:10.280> so<00:02:10.790> the<00:02:10.910> rate<00:02:11.150> control<00:02:11.660> on<00:02:11.930> the<00:02:12.140> left<00:02:12.170> is

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
here so the rate control on the left is

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.260 
here so the rate control on the left is
basically<00:02:12.830> the<00:02:13.310> speed<00:02:13.580> so<00:02:13.820> let's<00:02:14.030> go<00:02:14.150> ahead

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.270 
basically the speed so let's go ahead

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:32.140 
basically the speed so let's go ahead
and<00:02:14.570> turn<00:02:14.720> that<00:02:14.870> down

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.820 

you<00:02:33.150> can<00:02:33.269> see<00:02:33.420> the<00:02:33.569> light<00:02:33.810> blinking<00:02:34.319> really

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
you can see the light blinking really

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:54.259 
you can see the light blinking really
quickly<00:02:35.129> now<00:02:35.159> so<00:02:35.640> the<00:02:35.760> speed<00:02:36.030> is<00:02:36.269> a<00:02:36.299> lot<00:02:36.569> faster

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:55.979 

so<00:02:55.269> you<00:02:55.329> might<00:02:55.480> be<00:02:55.510> thinking<00:02:55.870> to<00:02:55.900> yourself

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989 
so you might be thinking to yourself

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:57.839 
so you might be thinking to yourself
well<00:02:56.560> it's<00:02:56.799> going<00:02:57.040> faster<00:02:57.459> but<00:02:57.579> you<00:02:57.640> can't

00:02:57.839 --> 00:02:57.849 
well it's going faster but you can't

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:00.000 
well it's going faster but you can't
really<00:02:58.060> feel<00:02:58.299> it<00:02:58.359> now<00:02:58.599> so<00:02:59.230> let's<00:02:59.409> go<00:02:59.560> ahead<00:02:59.769> and

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
really feel it now so let's go ahead and

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.490 
really feel it now so let's go ahead and
turn<00:03:00.219> the<00:03:00.400> depth<00:03:00.670> up<00:03:00.879> and<00:03:01.090> this<00:03:01.719> will<00:03:01.959> make<00:03:02.319> it

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
turn the depth up and this will make it

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:14.100 
turn the depth up and this will make it
way<00:03:02.680> more<00:03:02.709> prominent

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:16.210 

let's<00:03:15.110> go<00:03:15.200> ahead<00:03:15.290> and<00:03:15.500> turn<00:03:15.620> the<00:03:15.740> write<00:03:15.950> down

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
let's go ahead and turn the write down

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.430 
let's go ahead and turn the write down
and<00:03:16.550> I'm<00:03:17.240> going<00:03:17.330> to<00:03:17.390> go<00:03:17.480> ahead<00:03:17.600> and<00:03:18.050> switch

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
and I'm going to go ahead and switch

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:41.950 
and I'm going to go ahead and switch
over<00:03:18.920> to<00:03:19.160> the<00:03:19.910> triangle<00:03:20.360> wave<00:03:20.510> now

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:41.960 

00:03:41.960 --> 00:04:00.250 

and<00:03:43.310> back<00:03:44.310> to<00:03:44.490> the<00:03:44.610> square<00:03:44.880> wave

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:00.260 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.390 

so<00:04:01.260> one<00:04:01.380> of<00:04:01.410> the<00:04:01.530> great<00:04:01.680> things<00:04:01.920> about<00:04:02.010> this

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
so one of the great things about this

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.250 
so one of the great things about this
pedal<00:04:02.760> is<00:04:02.940> the<00:04:02.970> volume<00:04:03.510> control<00:04:03.960> you<00:04:03.990> can

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
pedal is the volume control you can

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.770 
pedal is the volume control you can
actually<00:04:04.470> make<00:04:05.010> it<00:04:05.190> louder<00:04:05.520> or<00:04:05.790> softer<00:04:05.850> than

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
actually make it louder or softer than

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.050 
actually make it louder or softer than
your<00:04:06.960> actual<00:04:07.170> neutral<00:04:07.830> tone<00:04:08.070> so<00:04:08.490> 12<00:04:08.790> o'clock

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
your actual neutral tone so 12 o'clock

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.150 
your actual neutral tone so 12 o'clock
right<00:04:09.390> about<00:04:09.660> where<00:04:09.900> your<00:04:10.380> guitar<00:04:10.680> would<00:04:10.890> sit

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
right about where your guitar would sit

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.430 
right about where your guitar would sit
without<00:04:11.430> any<00:04:11.730> effect<00:04:12.030> on<00:04:12.210> the<00:04:12.750> volume<00:04:13.080> the

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
without any effect on the volume the

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.020 
without any effect on the volume the
further<00:04:13.710> right<00:04:14.010> you<00:04:14.160> turn<00:04:14.310> it<00:04:14.460> to<00:04:14.490> ladder<00:04:14.790> and

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
further right you turn it to ladder and

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:16.910 
further right you turn it to ladder and
sort<00:04:15.660> of<00:04:15.690> more<00:04:15.840> dirty<00:04:16.080> it<00:04:16.260> gets<00:04:16.470> it's<00:04:16.680> pretty

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:16.920 
sort of more dirty it gets it's pretty

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:18.710 
sort of more dirty it gets it's pretty
cool<00:04:17.130> and<00:04:17.340> all<00:04:17.760> the<00:04:17.880> way<00:04:18.000> to<00:04:18.030> the<00:04:18.299> left<00:04:18.450> is

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
cool and all the way to the left is

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.380 
cool and all the way to the left is
obviously<00:04:19.500> a<00:04:19.590> lot<00:04:19.890> less<00:04:19.920> volume<00:04:20.519> so<00:04:20.820> let's<00:04:21.239> go

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:21.390 
obviously a lot less volume so let's go

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:22.580 
obviously a lot less volume so let's go
ahead<00:04:21.510> and<00:04:21.660> I'll<00:04:21.870> show<00:04:22.049> you<00:04:22.110> the<00:04:22.230> difference

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
ahead and I'll show you the difference

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:27.400 
ahead and I'll show you the difference
here

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:27.410 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:29.710 

and<00:04:27.790> let's<00:04:28.790> start<00:04:29.000> with<00:04:29.150> it<00:04:29.300> all<00:04:29.450> the<00:04:29.570> way<00:04:29.690> to

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:29.720 
and let's start with it all the way to

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:34.390 
and let's start with it all the way to
the<00:04:29.930> left<00:04:30.050> so<00:04:32.650> there's<00:04:33.650> no<00:04:33.800> volume<00:04:33.980> there<00:04:34.160> at

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 
the left so there's no volume there at

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:43.970 
the left so there's no volume there at
all<00:04:35.260> 9<00:04:36.260> o'clock

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:43.980 

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:50.020 

twelve<00:04:44.980> o'clock

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.030 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:59.330 

and<00:04:51.030> let's<00:04:51.360> go<00:04:51.510> to<00:04:51.660> 2<00:04:52.110> o'clock

00:04:59.330 --> 00:04:59.340 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:02.220 

so<00:05:00.340> tremolo<00:05:00.880> sounds<00:05:01.300> fantastic<00:05:01.870> with<00:05:02.020> a<00:05:02.050> bit

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:02.230 
so tremolo sounds fantastic with a bit

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:04.500 
so tremolo sounds fantastic with a bit
of<00:05:02.410> analog<00:05:02.830> delay<00:05:03.130> so<00:05:03.790> I've<00:05:04.030> got<00:05:04.150> a<00:05:04.180> little<00:05:04.420> bit

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:04.510 
of analog delay so I've got a little bit

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:14.129 
of analog delay so I've got a little bit
of<00:05:04.600> delay<00:05:04.840> on<00:05:04.870> now<00:05:06.300> let's<00:05:07.300> try<00:05:07.510> this

00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:14.139 

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:19.149 

you

00:05:19.149 --> 00:05:19.159 

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:21.709 

another<00:05:20.159> effect<00:05:20.609> that<00:05:20.729> works<00:05:21.029> great<00:05:21.419> with

00:05:21.709 --> 00:05:21.719 
another effect that works great with

00:05:21.719 --> 00:05:24.649 
another effect that works great with
tremolo<00:05:22.259> is<00:05:22.499> overdrive<00:05:23.339> so<00:05:23.969> this<00:05:24.179> is<00:05:24.299> my<00:05:24.419> clean

00:05:24.649 --> 00:05:24.659 
tremolo is overdrive so this is my clean

00:05:24.659 --> 00:05:26.620 
tremolo is overdrive so this is my clean
tone

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:26.630 
tone

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:29.610 
tone
you

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:29.620 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:33.330 

and<00:05:31.110> this<00:05:32.110> is<00:05:32.229> with<00:05:32.380> a<00:05:32.410> moment<00:05:32.830> overdrive

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:33.340 
and this is with a moment overdrive

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:42.830 
and this is with a moment overdrive
pedal
