00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:01.620
 deep angle immediately rising candid the 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.750
 led into the tables of the baptist anah 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.939

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.830
 word his friend reminded his senses with a 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.680
 little bad vinegar that is at 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:23.880

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:38.700
 big unspoken pangloss kicks 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.280
 she was gutted by soldiers 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.530
 Bulgarian after being raped as much 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.970
 that we can be broke their heads 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.700
 to the baron who wanted the 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.299
 defend the baroness was cut off 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.119
 in pieces 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:54.720
 my poor desk was precisely 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:56.540
 like his sister and as for the castle he 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.240
 did not stay stone on stone 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:02.570
 r not a barn not a sheep not a 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:04.490
 duck not a tree but we have been 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.140
 to avenge well because the offal made 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.869
 as much in a neighboring barony that 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.380
 belonged a Bulgarian lord to this 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:12.650
 speech 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:14.840
 candid still fades my income to 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:18.350
 having said all he had to say 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:20.030
 he inquired about the cause and the effect and 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:23.720
 of the sufficient reason that had put 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:26.900
 pangloss in such a sorry state and the ace 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.370
 says the other is love love the 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.430
 comforter of the human race 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:34.780
 the conservative of the universe the soul of 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:37.760
 all sentient beings the tender love 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:40.160
 and said candid I knew him this 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.640
 love this sovereign of the curse and soul of 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.100
 our soul 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.080
 it never got me a kiss and 20 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.250
 kicks in the ass 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:49.450
 How did this beautiful cause she could 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:52.040
 produce in you such an abominable effect 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:54.440
 pangloss replied in these terms 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.900
 oh my dear candid you have known 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.450
 package this pretty next of our 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:02.060
 august baroness I tasted in her arms 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.769
 the delights of paradise that have produced 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:06.530
 those hellish torments you see me 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:08.750
 devour she was infected she in 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.670
 may be dead paca was holding this 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.870
 present of a very learned cordeliers who 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.730
 had gone back to the source 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.890
 because he had an old countess 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:17.810
 that he had received from a captain 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:20.060
 cavalry that did not owe a mark 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.769
 it is they who gave the 20 pages it 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.989
 had received from a Jesuit who is in 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:25.940
 novice had killed her in a straight line of a 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:29.150
 companions of christophe colomb for 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:33.019
 I will not give to anyone because I 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:34.850
 Anglos to die cried candid here 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:36.110
 a strange genealogy is not it 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:39.080
 devil who was the strain 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:41.720
 no point at all to this great man 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.670
 it was an indispensable thing in the 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.590
 best of all worlds an ingredient 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:46.810
 necessary 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.610
 because if collomb had not caught in 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:50.410
 an island of america this disease that 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:52.690
 poison the source of the generation 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:54.910
 which often even prevents generation 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:56.860
 which is obviously the opposite of the big goal 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:59.620
 of nature we would not have the 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:00.910
 chocolate or cochineal but it takes 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.560
 still observe that until today 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:04.269
 in our continent 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.739
 this disease is peculiar to us 

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:09.099
 like the controversy 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:12.459
 the Turks them the Indians the Persians 

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:13.360
 the Chinese the Siamese the Japanese do not 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:15.700
 do not know it yet 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:17.440
 but there is reason enough to 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.700
 that they know it in turn 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:20.859
 a few centuries 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:23.560
 meanwhile she did a wonderful 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:25.930
 progress among us and especially in these 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:28.090
 great armies composed of onet this type 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:30.520
 in hyÃ¨res well raised who decides the 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:32.830
 fate of states we can assure that 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:34.900
 when thirty thousand men fight in 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:37.479
 row battle against even troops 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:40.720
 in number there are about twenty thousand 

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:43.660
 shattered on each side that's who is 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.500
 admirable candid but you have to 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:47.740
 to heal 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:49.450
 how well on Thursday pang the bone I did not 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:51.370
 not penniless but we put in and in any 

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:53.229
 the extent of this globe one can neither 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:55.600
 bleed or take an enema 

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:58.930
 are paid or without someone 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:01.360
 who pays for us this last speech 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:03.190
 determined candid he went to throw himself 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:05.470
 foot of his charitable Anabaptists 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:07.419
 Jacques and made him a painting so 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:09.160
 touching of the state where his friend was 

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:11.470
 reduced that the man did not hesitate to 

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:14.169
 collect the doctor sob he 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:17.080
 healed at his expense panglose in 

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:17.530
 the cure only lost one eye and one 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:21.000
 hear 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:23.710
 he wrote well and knew perfectly 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.560
 the arithmetic the baptist anah jacques 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:28.030
 Amphis are book content after 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:29.590
 two months being forced to go to 

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:31.599
 lisbon for the affairs of his 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:34.690
 commerce he led in his ship these 

00:05:31.599 --> 00:05:36.610
 two philosophers pangloss explained to him 

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:39.910
 how everything is is can not be better 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:42.310
 jacques was not of this opinion it takes 

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:44.650
 well he said that souls is a little 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:47.440
 corrupt nature because they are not 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:49.330
 and wolf and they became righteous god 

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:50.740
 gave them no 24-gun 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:51.970
 bayonets and they made themselves 

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:52.479
 bayonets and cannons for himself 

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:54.159
 destroy 

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:56.150
 I could put into account 

00:05:54.159 --> 00:05:57.620
 bankruptcies and the justice that is 

00:05:56.150 --> 00:06:00.260
 by property of road shortages for 

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:02.960
 frustrate the creditors all this 

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:04.400
 was indispensable replied the 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:07.100
 doctor barnier and woes 

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:09.430
 individuals do general good 

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:12.460
 so that the more there are two woes 

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:16.310
 particular is more everything is good 

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:18.650
 as it resonated the air gets darker 

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:21.170
 the winds blow air from the four corners 

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:23.120
 of the world and the ship was beset with 

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:26.650
 the most horrible storm 

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:26.650
 at the sight of the port of lisbon
