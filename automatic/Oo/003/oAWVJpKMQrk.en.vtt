00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
we need a plant is going to grow fast a

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.160 
we need a plant is going to grow fast a
plant<00:00:26.279> that<00:00:26.420> just<00:00:27.420> will<00:00:27.570> produce<00:00:27.779> a<00:00:27.960> lot<00:00:28.140> of

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
plant that just will produce a lot of

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.490 
plant that just will produce a lot of
carbon<00:00:28.980> for<00:00:29.189> us<00:00:29.310> that<00:00:29.580> we<00:00:29.670> can<00:00:29.849> shred<00:00:30.119> up

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:30.500 
carbon for us that we can shred up

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.350 
carbon for us that we can shred up
compost<00:00:31.500> it<00:00:31.800> and<00:00:32.009> then<00:00:32.489> feed<00:00:32.730> it<00:00:32.759> to<00:00:33.000> our<00:00:33.030> worms

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
compost it and then feed it to our worms

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.360 
compost it and then feed it to our worms
so<00:00:33.750> that<00:00:33.899> they<00:00:34.050> can<00:00:34.260> eat<00:00:34.410> it<00:00:34.590> turn<00:00:34.980> into<00:00:35.160> worm

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
so that they can eat it turn into worm

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.040 
so that they can eat it turn into worm
castings<00:00:36.000> which<00:00:36.059> is<00:00:36.300> one<00:00:36.450> of<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:36.660> best

castings which is one of the best

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.530 
castings which is one of the best
organic<00:00:37.500> fertilizers<00:00:38.250> you<00:00:38.550> can<00:00:38.700> have<00:00:38.879> so

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
organic fertilizers you can have so

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.930 
organic fertilizers you can have so
after<00:00:39.930> we<00:00:40.050> grow<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.800> bamboo<00:00:41.190> we'll<00:00:41.640> take<00:00:41.820> it

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
after we grow the bamboo we'll take it

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.700 
after we grow the bamboo we'll take it
over<00:00:42.000> here<00:00:42.620> to<00:00:43.620> our<00:00:43.649> worm<00:00:43.950> bins<00:00:44.160> and<00:00:45.440> worms<00:00:46.440> can

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
over here to our worm bins and worms can

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.750 
over here to our worm bins and worms can
eat<00:00:46.829> half<00:00:47.039> their<00:00:47.250> body<00:00:47.460> weight<00:00:47.579> in<00:00:48.440> food<00:00:49.440> a<00:00:49.620> day

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:49.760 
eat half their body weight in food a day

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.250 
eat half their body weight in food a day
some<00:00:50.760> all<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.120> way<00:00:51.210> up<00:00:51.300> to<00:00:51.329> their<00:00:51.840> whole<00:00:52.050> body

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
some all the way up to their whole body

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.189 
some all the way up to their whole body
weight<00:00:52.500> so<00:00:53.430> say<00:00:53.699> we<00:00:53.850> have<00:00:54.030> 100<00:00:54.870> pounds<00:00:55.140> of

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
weight so say we have 100 pounds of

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.099 
weight so say we have 100 pounds of
worms<00:00:55.440> we<00:00:55.739> can<00:00:55.969> process<00:00:56.969> 50<00:00:57.539> pounds<00:00:57.989> of

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
worms we can process 50 pounds of

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.150 
worms we can process 50 pounds of
organic<00:00:58.859> waste<00:00:59.160> a<00:00:59.520> day<00:00:59.730> so<00:01:00.420> after<00:01:00.809> it<00:01:00.949> it<00:01:01.949> goes

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
organic waste a day so after it it goes

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.650 
organic waste a day so after it it goes
through<00:01:02.399> our<00:01:02.489> worm<00:01:02.670> bins<00:01:02.940> and<00:01:03.210> it's<00:01:03.300> eaten

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
through our worm bins and it's eaten

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.050 
through our worm bins and it's eaten
here<00:01:04.519> we're<00:01:05.519> going<00:01:05.640> to<00:01:05.700> take<00:01:05.970> it<00:01:06.150> over<00:01:06.950> to

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
here we're going to take it over to

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.850 
here we're going to take it over to
these<00:01:09.060> growing<00:01:09.390> areas<00:01:09.900> we're<00:01:10.500> going<00:01:10.590> to<00:01:10.680> grow

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
these growing areas we're going to grow

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.649 
these growing areas we're going to grow
a<00:01:10.890> plant<00:01:11.100> called<00:01:11.310> Moringa<00:01:11.880> here<00:01:12.150> it's<00:01:12.299> a<00:01:12.390> fast

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
a plant called Moringa here it's a fast

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.850 
a plant called Moringa here it's a fast
growing<00:01:12.900> tree<00:01:13.409> that's<00:01:14.100> from<00:01:14.750> India<00:01:15.750> and<00:01:15.930> it

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
growing tree that's from India and it

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.800 
growing tree that's from India and it
has<00:01:17.040> great<00:01:17.490> great<00:01:17.909> great<00:01:18.119> nutritional

has great great great nutritional
properties<00:01:19.409> and<00:01:19.979> that's<00:01:20.700> going<00:01:20.850> to<00:01:20.939> be<00:01:21.090> a<00:01:21.119> huge

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
properties and that's going to be a huge

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.719 
properties and that's going to be a huge
part<00:01:21.840> of<00:01:22.250> increasing<00:01:23.930> the<00:01:24.930> just<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.729> the

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
part of increasing the just the the

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.280 
part of increasing the just the the
depth<00:01:27.000> of<00:01:27.150> our<00:01:27.299> yield<00:01:27.600> we<00:01:27.780> don't<00:01:27.930> want<00:01:28.080> to<00:01:28.170> grow

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
depth of our yield we don't want to grow

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.890 
depth of our yield we don't want to grow
plants<00:01:28.710> that<00:01:28.860> are<00:01:28.890> that<00:01:29.670> are<00:01:29.729> ok<00:01:30.360> for<00:01:30.390> you<00:01:30.720> want

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
plants that are that are ok for you want

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.420 
plants that are that are ok for you want
to<00:01:30.990> grow<00:01:31.290> plants<00:01:31.650> that<00:01:31.740> are<00:01:31.799> great<00:01:32.040> for<00:01:32.070> people

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
to grow plants that are great for people

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.420 
to grow plants that are great for people
and<00:01:32.850> so<00:01:33.630> we're<00:01:34.170> going<00:01:34.259> to<00:01:34.350> give<00:01:34.710> a<00:01:34.740> large<00:01:35.100> part

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
and so we're going to give a large part

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.390 
and so we're going to give a large part
of<00:01:35.520> our<00:01:35.670> property<00:01:36.180> to<00:01:36.360> that<00:01:36.540> specific<00:01:36.750> tree

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:37.400 
of our property to that specific tree

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.859 
of our property to that specific tree
then<00:01:38.400> we'll<00:01:38.549> take<00:01:38.759> also<00:01:39.000> take<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.390> dirt<00:01:39.570> over

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
beehives another huge innovation we're

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.940 
beehives another huge innovation we're
going<00:02:39.040> to<00:02:39.100> use<00:02:39.280> something<00:02:39.580> called<00:02:39.790> aquaponics

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
going to use something called aquaponics

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.380 
going to use something called aquaponics
aquaponics<00:02:41.950> you've<00:02:42.940> ever<00:02:43.060> heard<00:02:43.239> of

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
aquaponics you've ever heard of

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.750 
aquaponics you've ever heard of
hydroponics<00:02:44.140> it's<00:02:44.290> growing<00:02:44.769> plants<00:02:45.610> in

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
hydroponics it's growing plants in

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.220 
hydroponics it's growing plants in
gravel<00:02:46.690> with<00:02:47.530> a<00:02:48.150> water<00:02:49.150> or<00:02:49.510> fertilized<00:02:49.989> water

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
gravel with a water or fertilized water

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.759 
gravel with a water or fertilized water
solution<00:02:50.860> running<00:02:51.160> over<00:02:51.459> the<00:02:52.440> roots<00:02:53.440> so

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:53.769 
solution running over the roots so

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:55.320 
solution running over the roots so
there's<00:02:53.950> no<00:02:54.100> soil<00:02:54.370> involved<00:02:54.940> it's<00:02:55.090> just

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330 
there's no soil involved it's just

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.960 
there's no soil involved it's just
gravel<00:02:56.200> and<00:02:56.380> so<00:02:56.860> what<00:02:56.980> we'll<00:02:57.100> do<00:02:57.250> is<00:02:57.280> the<00:02:57.700> top

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
gravel and so what we'll do is the top

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:59.729 
gravel and so what we'll do is the top
it<00:02:58.120> will<00:02:58.209> grow<00:02:58.390> in<00:02:58.570> these<00:02:58.660> bottom<00:02:59.050> troughs<00:02:59.500> of

00:02:59.729 --> 00:02:59.739 
it will grow in these bottom troughs of

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:01.860 
it will grow in these bottom troughs of
water<00:02:59.980> they'll<00:03:00.700> dirty<00:03:01.000> the<00:03:01.239> water<00:03:01.269> and<00:03:01.690> it

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
water they'll dirty the water and it

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.590 
water they'll dirty the water and it
will<00:03:01.989> be<00:03:02.080> pumped<00:03:02.320> up<00:03:02.560> to<00:03:02.739> this<00:03:02.860> top<00:03:03.160> row<00:03:03.600> then

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:04.600 
will be pumped up to this top row then

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.890 
will be pumped up to this top row then
that<00:03:05.500> dirty<00:03:05.769> water<00:03:05.890> will<00:03:06.340> filter<00:03:06.610> through

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
that dirty water will filter through

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.170 
that dirty water will filter through
these<00:03:07.900> plant<00:03:08.319> rose<00:03:08.590> drop<00:03:09.190> down<00:03:09.430> to<00:03:09.640> the<00:03:09.730> second

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
these plant rose drop down to the second

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.380 
these plant rose drop down to the second
one<00:03:10.360> and<00:03:10.600> then<00:03:11.610> drop<00:03:12.610> down<00:03:12.640> into<00:03:13.090> the<00:03:13.269> water

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
one and then drop down into the water

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:15.930 
one and then drop down into the water
again<00:03:13.630> and<00:03:14.440> what<00:03:14.590> we'll<00:03:14.709> have<00:03:14.739> is<00:03:14.950> our<00:03:15.370> plants

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
again and what we'll have is our plants

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.060 
again and what we'll have is our plants
would<00:03:16.030> be<00:03:16.150> fertilized<00:03:16.570> by<00:03:16.690> the<00:03:16.780> fish<00:03:17.110> and<00:03:17.410> then

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:18.070 
would be fertilized by the fish and then

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:21.330 
would be fertilized by the fish and then
the<00:03:18.549> plants<00:03:19.000> will<00:03:19.360> clean<00:03:19.930> the<00:03:20.530> water<00:03:20.709> for<00:03:21.190> the

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
the plants will clean the water for the

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.220 
the plants will clean the water for the
fish<00:03:21.519> again<00:03:21.910> so<00:03:22.510> the<00:03:22.630> official<00:03:22.750> have<00:03:22.989> clean

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
fish again so the official have clean

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:24.539 
fish again so the official have clean
water<00:03:23.410> the<00:03:23.739> plants<00:03:24.070> will<00:03:24.160> have<00:03:24.310> fertilizer

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:24.549 
water the plants will have fertilizer

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:27.270 
water the plants will have fertilizer
we'll<00:03:25.480> get<00:03:25.660> a<00:03:25.690> crop<00:03:25.989> out<00:03:26.260> of<00:03:26.440> both<00:03:26.680> sides<00:03:26.709> we

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
we'll get a crop out of both sides we

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.550 
we'll get a crop out of both sides we
get<00:03:27.370> a<00:03:27.430> fish<00:03:27.670> crop<00:03:27.940> in<00:03:28.180> a<00:03:28.239> plant<00:03:28.480> crop<00:03:28.750> and<00:03:28.959> so

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560 
get a fish crop in a plant crop and so

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.170 
get a fish crop in a plant crop and so
this<00:03:29.680> is<00:03:29.799> aquaponics<00:03:30.190> something<00:03:31.030> we're<00:03:31.120> going
