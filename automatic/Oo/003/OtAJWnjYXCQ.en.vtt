00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.230 
of the previous months has literally
been<00:02:58.800> at<00:02:58.950> home<00:02:59.070> on<00:02:59.250> since<00:02:59.550> I've<00:02:59.700> chose<00:03:00.000> these

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:00.240 
been at home on since I've chose these

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.280 
been at home on since I've chose these
so<00:03:00.570> I<00:03:00.840> don't<00:03:01.650> know<00:03:02.090> why<00:03:03.090> I<00:03:03.120> got<00:03:03.360> to<00:03:03.630> did<00:03:04.020> I<00:03:04.110> like

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
so I don't know why I got to did I like

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.650 
so I don't know why I got to did I like
water<00:03:04.530> it's<00:03:04.709> you<00:03:04.830> or<00:03:04.980> or<00:03:05.220> they<00:03:06.030> send<00:03:06.270> me<00:03:06.360> one<00:03:06.510> by

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
water it's you or or they send me one by

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.810 
water it's you or or they send me one by
mistake<00:03:07.080> I<00:03:07.230> don't<00:03:07.380> know<00:03:07.440> but<00:03:08.280> this<00:03:08.459> is<00:03:08.520> what<00:03:08.730> it

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820 
mistake I don't know but this is what it

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:10.610 
mistake I don't know but this is what it
looks<00:03:08.940> like<00:03:09.120> it<00:03:09.360> actually<00:03:09.390> reminds<00:03:10.020> me<00:03:10.140> of<00:03:10.290> the

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
looks like it actually reminds me of the

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.740 
looks like it actually reminds me of the
Stila<00:03:11.490> lip<00:03:11.520> glosses<00:03:12.740> but<00:03:13.740> I<00:03:13.920> like<00:03:14.160> the<00:03:14.280> color

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
Stila lip glosses but I like the color

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.710 
Stila lip glosses but I like the color
so<00:03:15.750> I<00:03:16.610> don't<00:03:17.610> know<00:03:17.670> if<00:03:17.730> I<00:03:17.880> want<00:03:18.060> to<00:03:18.120> use<00:03:18.390> it<00:03:18.420> now

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
so I don't know if I want to use it now

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.440 
so I don't know if I want to use it now
so<00:03:19.200> i<00:03:19.500> probably<00:03:19.830> will<00:03:20.190> wait<00:03:20.370> to<00:03:20.910> do<00:03:21.060> that<00:03:21.090> later

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
so i probably will wait to do that later

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.060 
so i probably will wait to do that later
this<00:03:22.050> will<00:03:22.200> actually<00:03:22.320> come<00:03:22.620> in<00:03:22.739> handy<00:03:22.950> because
