 shows the second part of the video 

00:00:08.789 --> 00:00:10.529
 the one who is one of them 

00:00:10.529 --> 00:00:13.659
 I have decided to rule on the appeal 

00:00:13.659 --> 00:00:18.760
 I even commented with a little of those days that he said yes and he is a 

00:00:18.759 --> 00:00:21.720
 of people who like the feel of a book 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.019
 hands and not 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:28.909
 the device has won the support of its capacity because for this 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:31.779
 to make the impression 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:34.380
 that was such that I have not even shown 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.690
 she is jelly 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.670
 she leaves ipt 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.590
 little more serious 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.460
 it's the same size certifying the same to relatives 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.050
 This is what I got 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.240
 65 dollars hence that's it 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:54.430
 is in the form of a bank from a small book of a 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:56.510
 was very good 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.790
 wanted to be much thicker concel can see the ipi shares of kirin gets more or 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:04.140
 at least four times 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.730
 the thickness 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:06.870
 whaites 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:11.300
 if you like the feel of having a book that hands think maybe you 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.320
 think it interesting that you can hold the price of fame 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:17.330
 but I do not find it very pleasant 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.970
 I really prefer 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.040
 stay with them here 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.229
 I'm working so hard for those who will move on. 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:28.990
 the pope accept this 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.229
 here if it is held above that canonical form in the Olympic 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:37.300
 click here 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.170
 to shiver 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.050
 over there 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.500
 noble and the least I like to use reading 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.320
 the thing could demonstrate 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.420
 be careful with your whole life 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.750
 had to have in the reflection in the case of light the environment 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.120
 but I can get a very high vision with it 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:59.690
 he does not stay 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:01.070
 little black 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.040
 so cool 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.040
 poor kirwa ibooks 

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:11.019
 the organ does not understand hitler 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:14.369
 the only book that comes with it this one 

00:02:14.369 --> 00:02:17.369
 from the institute 

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:24.329
 You can read this way if you want. 

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:28.129
 in this other form as if it were a book 

00:02:28.779 --> 00:02:30.709
 you pass 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:33.709
 return 

00:02:35.369 --> 00:02:38.369
 can be created here 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:43.629
 the source changes too if you do not like it 

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:45.849
 the formatting 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:48.849
 the victim at home if the next smoker 

00:02:49.679 --> 00:02:52.679
 alone he 

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:56.809
 the ace 

00:02:58.179 --> 00:03:00.649
 come back here to my mark 

00:03:00.649 --> 00:03:06.079
 here I have to walk the other books if you can take action the advice is 

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:07.160
 can get a 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.160
 loan how to stay over here 

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:15.299
 down here you can run 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:18.659
 quickly that the beginning of the book 

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:21.659
 by the end 

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:28.859
 I do not go here I started to bother me the goal was canceled 

00:03:33.589 --> 00:03:36.589
 who had today's cost show that in the last negotiation 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:42.759
 in the market the first shift 

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:46.159
 in the photo holding that he got 

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:49.629
 do that will-not-go 

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:52.439
 as if I were going to turn the page and not 

00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:54.929
 end up turning is living everything 

00:03:54.929 --> 00:03:56.339
 of the world this 

00:03:56.339 --> 00:04:00.729
 here was so demotion if you buy why this is just one 

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:03.139
 modern 

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:06.709
 who's here is a free and volatile full bucket for now 

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:09.220
 he separates 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.619
 in two columns 

00:04:11.619 --> 00:04:14.420
 those who do not need to identify themselves 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:16.400
 stop it 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.969
 on the left and we stand 

00:04:18.969 --> 00:04:20.200
 I imagined having 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.200
 here are the free ones if you observe 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:26.940
 the spac has picks everyone has a cap 

00:04:27.539 --> 00:04:32.249
 and the free ones which is very rare which is a cap me tell me that they are works that 

00:04:32.249 --> 00:04:35.180
 no longer has copyright 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:38.639
 already expired that copyright is 50 years 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:42.300
 and would enable them to copyright then not 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:46.389
 they did not put anything that shows her that she's down and some 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:50.680
 I'm going to do the free bailout now your proposal like this 

00:04:54.259 --> 00:04:57.259
 put my password 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:05.550
 he stands here as if it were a podium that is this 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:08.550
 on the iphone 

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:14.779
 is going on and had quantity equivalent to only one year 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:18.550
 but he did not call 

00:05:19.089 --> 00:05:22.089
 sensible around here 

00:05:22.719 --> 00:05:25.719
 The art of war 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:30.200
 This gentleman I think I was not able to do this feat here 

00:05:30.199 --> 00:05:31.580
 of revelry 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:36.030
 because it was a boy using a little thing so said here it is free in the 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:37.830
 fast conceptualization 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:40.830
 can do that thing with the team 

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:44.889
 if I want the video page not to 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:50.110
 and I can say that this other form also 

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:56.400
 to comscore the same way it is showing nothing 

00:06:03.639 --> 00:06:06.969
 Let's search for words. 

00:06:06.969 --> 00:06:10.849
 one thing she's clear is that what's not the best you can do 

00:06:10.849 --> 00:06:13.499
 notes here you do not 

00:06:13.499 --> 00:06:16.499
 you can not do 

00:06:19.659 --> 00:06:22.889
 I tried to make every word completely quiet 

00:06:24.059 --> 00:06:26.520
 that the meeting 

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:29.719
 remembering that it acts in the minimum brightness talgo pass kiko marques 

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:36.680
 so I got the scare computer I played bass slang does not get recorded 

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:38.509
 there you leave it 

00:06:38.509 --> 00:06:39.780
 here is 

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:43.089
 stay calm 

00:06:43.089 --> 00:06:48.029
 they go from coi what I think he gave to take the pair lay in the majority of 

00:06:48.029 --> 00:06:49.150
 guys 

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:52.499
 entered with another request personally 

00:06:52.499 --> 00:06:55.909
 that you wanted to see and hear from the end 

00:06:55.909 --> 00:06:58.040
 and then gradually I will release it 

00:06:58.040 --> 00:06:58.720
 these videos
