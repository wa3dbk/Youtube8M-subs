00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 in this video we are going to study the 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:07.560
 definition of the nth root of a 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.929
 number the notations and how to determine 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.240
 the root of a number using the 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:16.230
 definition 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:18.599
 we have that 2 to 3 equals 8 on 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:23.369
 result of base power 2 and 

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:25.590
 exponent 3 is 8 we say that 2 is the 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.810
 cubic root of 8 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:31.019
 kubica to refer to the 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.720
 exponent the radiation is the process 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:36.870
 inverse of the empowerment in which 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:40.500
 wants to determine the base or all the 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.150
 bases when you know the exponent and the 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.340
 power 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:46.980
 in the next expression we want 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:50.550
 determine the basis for the result 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:53.700
 of the power is equal to 25 we do it 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:57.060
 by trial 5 is a number that meets 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:59.970
 this relationship we say that 5 is a root 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:03.630
 square of 25 square to do 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:07.620
 reference to which the exponent is 205 not 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:10.380
 is the only root minus 5 is another basis 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:13.620
 such that the result of the power is 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:16.540
 25 we have then that minus 5 is another 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:18.850
 square root of 25 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.920
 think a real plant number that at 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:24.460
 square it up your result be 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:26.620
 equal to minus 16 we see that there is no 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:29.230
 real number that satisfies this relationship 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:31.360
 as the result of raising any 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:34.240
 Real number squared is always 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.040
 positive never negative that is the side 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.160
 straight 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.370
 we say that minus 16 has no roots 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.620
 real 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:44.470
 let's establish the general definition 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:47.090
 of the nth root of a number 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:49.010
 studying the definition when a 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.950
 number can have more than one root 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:54.140
 when it has no root and denotations 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:57.229
 for these numbers 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:00.560
 if we notice by n the exponent is a 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:04.100
 whole greater than 1 we say is a 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.810
 nth root of a sive elevated to n 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.820
 that 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:11.239
 There are varied procedures for 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:13.640
 determine the roots of a number here 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:16.280
 we will do it therefore we will determine 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.920
 a fifth root of 32 with fifth 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:21.920
 we want to refer to that the exponent 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:25.069
 of the power is 5 we ask 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:29.390
 then for the value b of the base such 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:31.550
 that sees at 5 is equal to 32 if so 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:34.519
 have you can see that 12 is a number that 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:37.880
 comply with this proposition 2 is a 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:40.160
 fifth root of 32 to show that a 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.500
 number is an nth root of another 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:46.569
 We can verify that it meets the 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.569
 definition as we just did 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.700
 let's study the definition of reich 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:56.450
 on top of a number dividing in 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:59.629
 different cases of agreement towards is 0 is 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:02.689
 positive or the first case is negative 

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:06.379
 consider is equal to 0 

00:03:02.689 --> 00:03:10.400
 we have 0 is the only root of 0 because 

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:14.480
 is the only number that raised to n is 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:18.260
 equal to 0 there is no other the nth root of 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:21.170
 zero is annotated with the radical symbol and 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:23.500
 its value we just proved it is 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:23.500
 zero 

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:30.760
 for the case to positive we have two 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:33.700
 situations in Nepal and odd in the 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:36.999
 case of n pair there are two roots one 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:39.730
 positive and another negative the root 

00:03:36.999 --> 00:03:43.299
 positive of a is denoted by the symbol 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:45.609
 that is read nth root of to this root 

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:49.540
 it is also known as the root 

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:53.709
 main the negative root we denote 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:57.669
 for less nth root of a let's see what 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:04:00.510
 happens with the fourth roots of 81 there 

00:03:57.669 --> 00:04:03.569
 two roots one positive and one negative 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:06.760
 that we denote them as seen on the screen 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:10.900
 but what are the numerical values ​​of 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:13.449
 these roots think of numbers such that 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:17.650
 by raising the fourth to your result 

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:21.250
 is 81 fast you get 3 in a network 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:25.450
 and fourth of 81 then 3 to 4 equals 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:29.320
 81 plus 3 is the positive root 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:32.470
 the other fourth root of 81 the negative is 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:35.040
 minus 3 effectively meets the 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:35.040
 definition 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:43.090
 if n is odd there is only one root called 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:46.240
 the nth root of a and denoted as 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:50.610
 appears on the screen this root is always 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:55.629
 positive 32 has only one fifth root 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:58.120
 we already proved that 2 is a root 2 is the 

00:04:55.629 --> 00:05:02.050
 unique value such that by elevating it to the 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:05.969
 fifth is equal to 32 so these two 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:05.969
 propositions are equivalent 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:12.500
 the negative case is also going to 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:16.849
 analyze for situation n par and in 

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:19.669
 odd it has is peace then they do not exist 

00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:22.970
 real roots for example if there is is 

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:24.819
 equal to minus 25 we see that when raising 

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:27.590
 the definition of square root 

00:05:24.819 --> 00:05:30.560
 we should look for a number such that 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:33.949
 raise it to 2 as less results 

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:37.419
 25 is to say a number such that at 

00:05:33.949 --> 00:05:40.159
 raise it to a couple power of negative 

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:43.190
 we know that there is no real number 

00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:46.789
 that meets this condition is often said 

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:47.900
 that the square root of minus 25 is not 

00:05:46.789 --> 00:05:50.300
 real 

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:51.820
 later we will say that it is a number 

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:54.340
 imaginary 

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:57.220
 do not get confused with the negative root of 

00:05:54.340 --> 00:06:00.130
 25 is root is real 

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:02.800
 its value is minus 5 observe well the 

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:06.460
 number that you take root and the parity of 

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:09.220
 n of the fourth root-root index 

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:13.840
 minus 16 is not real 

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:16.840
 neither the root is less than 64 

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:19.780
 for the odd case you have only one 

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:22.139
 root in this case the numerical value of 

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:26.650
 the root is always a negative number 

00:06:22.139 --> 00:06:29.320
 which is the cubic root of minus 125 as 

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:31.660
 we reduce this root, notice that we have 

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:35.860
 than to think a number that by raising it to 

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:38.020
 cube results in minus 125 the 

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:40.630
 sign of this result already says that the 

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:43.600
 base has to be a negative number the 

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:46.270
 base is the root so the root is 

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:50.110
 negative so you're seeing that in the case 

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:54.010
 general if a is negative and n odd 

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:58.060
 root of a is negative but let's go back which one 

00:06:54.010 --> 00:07:01.000
 is the cubic root of minus 125 groping 

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:04.240
 we see that minus 5 is a number that 

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:09.930
 it satisfies this identity therefore less 

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:09.930
 5 is the cube root of minus 125
