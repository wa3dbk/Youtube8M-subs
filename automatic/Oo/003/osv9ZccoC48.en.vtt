okay<00:00:07.440> this<00:00:07.710> is<00:00:07.950> the<00:00:08.250> burner<00:00:09.030> motor<00:00:09.480> it's

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
okay this is the burner motor it's

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.440 
okay this is the burner motor it's
combination<00:00:10.889> blower<00:00:11.460> and<00:00:12.770> pump<00:00:13.770> drive<00:00:14.120> and<00:00:15.120> I

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
combination blower and pump drive and I

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.540 
combination blower and pump drive and I
want<00:00:15.600> to<00:00:15.690> give<00:00:15.840> you<00:00:15.960> a<00:00:16.020> few<00:00:16.260> things<00:00:16.529> I<00:00:16.710> kind<00:00:17.400> of

want to give you a few things I kind of
talked<00:00:17.760> about<00:00:17.970> these<00:00:18.090> before<00:00:18.480> but<00:00:18.510> I'm<00:00:18.750> going

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
talked about these before but I'm going

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.780 
talked about these before but I'm going
to<00:00:18.930> tear<00:00:19.080> this<00:00:19.230> one<00:00:19.410> apart<00:00:19.710> first<00:00:20.520> thing<00:00:20.700> I

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:20.790 
to tear this one apart first thing I

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:22.630 
to tear this one apart first thing I
wanted<00:00:21.060> to<00:00:21.180> do<00:00:21.300> is<00:00:21.420> go<00:00:21.599> over<00:00:21.630> a<00:00:21.840> couple<00:00:22.110> of

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:22.640 
wanted to do is go over a couple of

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.290 
wanted to do is go over a couple of
things<00:00:23.640> right<00:00:23.970> here<00:00:26.060> okay

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
things right here okay

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.339 
things right here okay
the<00:00:27.540> rotation<00:00:28.380> on<00:00:28.529> this<00:00:28.739> thing<00:00:29.040> is<00:00:29.189> clockwise

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:30.349 
the rotation on this thing is clockwise

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:34.270 
the rotation on this thing is clockwise
and<00:00:31.349> that's<00:00:31.529> ope

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.280 
and that's ope

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.610 

always<00:00:35.280> looked<00:00:36.149> at<00:00:36.300> that<00:00:36.450> as<00:00:36.600> open-end<00:00:37.320> but

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
always looked at that as open-end but

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.160 
always looked at that as open-end but
that's<00:00:38.519> what<00:00:38.760> it<00:00:38.879> is<00:00:38.910> it's<00:00:39.300> if<00:00:39.539> I'm<00:00:39.750> looking<00:00:39.930> at

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
that's what it is it's if I'm looking at

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.529 
that's what it is it's if I'm looking at
the<00:00:40.320> back<00:00:40.590> of<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.859> motor<00:00:41.129> the<00:00:42.090> part<00:00:42.420> of<00:00:42.480> the

00:00:42.529 --> 00:00:42.539 
the back of the motor the part of the

00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:45.099 
the back of the motor the part of the
motor<00:00:42.719> you<00:00:42.870> can<00:00:43.050> see<00:00:43.350> it<00:00:44.219> would<00:00:44.399> be<00:00:44.519> clockwise

00:00:45.099 --> 00:00:45.109 
motor you can see it would be clockwise

00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:49.790 
motor you can see it would be clockwise
okay<00:00:46.579> that<00:00:47.579> one's<00:00:47.820> a<00:00:47.940> 1/8<00:00:48.539> horse<00:00:49.109> power<00:00:49.440> some

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
okay that one's a 1/8 horse power some

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.540 
okay that one's a 1/8 horse power some
of<00:00:49.829> them<00:00:50.039> are<00:00:50.100> 1:6<00:00:50.730> some<00:00:51.030> over<00:00:51.269> 1/7<00:00:52.100> all<00:00:53.100> of

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
of them are 1:6 some over 1/7 all of

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.250 
of them are 1:6 some over 1/7 all of
these<00:00:53.760> smaller<00:00:54.149> burners<00:00:54.690> like<00:00:54.929> this<00:00:55.109> are

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
these smaller burners like this are

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.009 
these smaller burners like this are
going<00:00:55.350> to<00:00:55.410> be<00:00:55.500> small<00:00:55.949> motors<00:00:56.690> ok<00:00:57.690> gives<00:00:57.929> you

00:00:58.009 --> 00:00:58.019 
going to be small motors ok gives you

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:00.619 
going to be small motors ok gives you
full<00:00:58.199> load<00:00:58.410> amps<00:00:58.620> and<00:00:59.489> on<00:00:59.999> and<00:01:00.239> on

you're replacing the motor you do no

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:12.470 
you're replacing the motor you do no
need<00:01:07.380> to<00:01:07.500> know<00:01:07.650> what<00:01:08.190> the<00:01:09.170> rotation<00:01:10.170> is<00:01:10.350> or<00:01:11.480> if

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:12.480 
need to know what the rotation is or if

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.650 
need to know what the rotation is or if
the<00:01:12.720> rotation<00:01:13.470> up<00:01:13.740> is<00:01:14.280> reversible<00:01:15.030> some<00:01:15.300> more

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:15.660 
the rotation up is reversible some more

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:17.810 
the rotation up is reversible some more
and<00:01:16.170> also<00:01:16.380> you<00:01:16.650> want<00:01:16.980> to<00:01:17.130> know<00:01:17.280> whether<00:01:17.550> it's

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
and also you want to know whether it's

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.600 
and also you want to know whether it's
seventeen<00:01:18.360> twenty<00:01:18.690> five<00:01:19.080> or<00:01:19.470> thirty<00:01:19.610> four

fifty rpm looking at the back of the
motor<00:01:24.740> we<00:01:25.740> have<00:01:25.770> a<00:01:26.010> manual<00:01:26.520> reset<00:01:27.030> look<00:01:27.300> for

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:27.480 
motor we have a manual reset look for

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:31.610 
motor we have a manual reset look for
this<00:01:27.600> manual<00:01:28.080> reset<00:01:30.140> because<00:01:31.140> that's<00:01:31.440> going

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:31.620 
this manual reset because that's going

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:33.770 
this manual reset because that's going
to<00:01:31.680> tell<00:01:31.890> you<00:01:32.100> either<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.730> pump<00:01:33.030> is<00:01:33.240> locked<00:01:33.510> up

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
to tell you either the pump is locked up

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.260 
to tell you either the pump is locked up
or<00:01:34.050> the<00:01:34.530> start<00:01:34.920> switch<00:01:35.190> on<00:01:35.520> this<00:01:35.640> motor<00:01:36.000> has

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
or the start switch on this motor has

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.040 
or the start switch on this motor has
failed<00:01:36.660> I<00:01:37.880> oftentimes<00:01:38.880> you'll<00:01:39.360> reset<00:01:39.840> that

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:40.050 
failed I oftentimes you'll reset that

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:42.770 
failed I oftentimes you'll reset that
and<00:01:40.110> it'll<00:01:40.320> just<00:01:40.620> hum<00:01:40.950> if<00:01:41.670> you<00:01:42.060> were<00:01:42.210> to<00:01:42.420> take<00:01:42.750> a

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
and it'll just hum if you were to take a

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.780 
and it'll just hum if you were to take a
small<00:01:43.230> hammer<00:01:43.650> and<00:01:43.920> hit<00:01:44.010> the<00:01:44.190> side<00:01:44.460> of<00:01:44.490> this

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
small hammer and hit the side of this

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.880 
small hammer and hit the side of this
thing<00:01:45.060> a<00:01:45.240> lot<00:01:45.570> of<00:01:45.690> times<00:01:45.900> it'll<00:01:46.080> start<00:01:46.470> that's

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
thing a lot of times it'll start that's

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.120 
thing a lot of times it'll start that's
telling<00:01:47.490> you<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:47.820> start<00:01:48.180> switch<00:01:48.710> is<00:01:49.710> failing

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
telling you the start switch is failing

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.670 
telling you the start switch is failing
it's<00:01:50.790> going<00:01:50.970> to<00:01:51.030> stick<00:01:51.270> again<00:01:51.570> so<00:01:51.840> that's<00:01:52.380> not

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
it's going to stick again so that's not

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.880 
it's going to stick again so that's not
a<00:01:52.710> solution<00:01:53.580> but<00:01:53.790> another<00:01:54.720> thing<00:01:55.110> I<00:01:55.410> wanted<00:01:55.800> to

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
a solution but another thing I wanted to

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.520 
a solution but another thing I wanted to
show<00:01:56.190> you<00:01:56.250> is<00:01:56.760> there's<00:01:57.630> one<00:01:57.930> of<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.110> oilers

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
show you is there's one of the oilers

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.980 
show you is there's one of the oilers
right<00:01:58.830> there<00:01:59.340> at<00:02:00.000> the<00:02:00.150> end<00:02:00.300> of<00:02:00.480> motor<00:02:00.720> and

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
right there at the end of motor and

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.990 
right there at the end of motor and
there's<00:02:03.990> the<00:02:04.230> other<00:02:04.350> boiler<00:02:04.890> if<00:02:05.430> this<00:02:05.730> thing's

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
there's the other boiler if this thing's

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.410 
there's the other boiler if this thing's
stopped<00:02:06.360> because<00:02:06.900> the<00:02:07.050> bearings<00:02:07.530> have<00:02:08.420> gotten

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
stopped because the bearings have gotten

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.900 
stopped because the bearings have gotten
stiff<00:02:09.780> you<00:02:10.379> can<00:02:10.560> oil<00:02:10.590> it<00:02:11.039> but<00:02:11.459> there's<00:02:11.640> a<00:02:11.730> good

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
stiff you can oil it but there's a good

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.350 
stiff you can oil it but there's a good
chance<00:02:12.209> the<00:02:12.720> motors<00:02:13.050> failed<00:02:13.319> usually<00:02:13.980> damn

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
chance the motors failed usually damn

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.340 
chance the motors failed usually damn
the<00:02:14.690> bearings<00:02:16.510> okay<00:02:17.510> I<00:02:17.540> wanted<00:02:17.930> to<00:02:18.020> take<00:02:18.200> this

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.350 
the bearings okay I wanted to take this

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.090 
the bearings okay I wanted to take this
thing<00:02:18.530> apart<00:02:18.650> we'll<00:02:19.130> take<00:02:19.370> a<00:02:19.400> look<00:02:19.580> inside

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
thing apart we'll take a look inside

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.440 
thing apart we'll take a look inside
okay<00:02:22.100> there's<00:02:22.370> what<00:02:22.580> the<00:02:22.700> motor<00:02:22.910> looks<00:02:23.150> like

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
okay there's what the motor looks like

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:30.330 
okay there's what the motor looks like
with<00:02:23.750> the<00:02:24.700> with<00:02:25.700> the<00:02:25.940> blower<00:02:26.780> wheel<00:02:27.140> off<00:02:27.410> and

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.560 

we're<00:02:31.340> going<00:02:31.460> to<00:02:31.550> pull<00:02:31.790> it<00:02:31.820> pull<00:02:32.150> it<00:02:32.450> apart

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:32.570 
we're going to pull it pull it apart

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:36.720 
we're going to pull it pull it apart
we're<00:02:33.140> going<00:02:33.290> to<00:02:33.350> look<00:02:33.560> and<00:02:33.770> see<00:02:34.250> what<00:02:35.210> the

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
we're going to look and see what the

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:41.740 
we're going to look and see what the
start<00:02:37.730> switch<00:02:37.880> looks<00:02:38.270> like<00:02:40.390> okay<00:02:41.390> we've<00:02:41.570> got

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
start switch looks like okay we've got

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:42.730 
start switch looks like okay we've got
this<00:02:41.930> thing<00:02:42.110> apart

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:42.740 
this thing apart

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:45.160 
this thing apart
here's<00:02:43.100> your<00:02:43.280> rotor<00:02:43.520> here<00:02:44.030> where's<00:02:45.020> your

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
here's your rotor here where's your

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.890 
here's your rotor here where's your
stators<00:02:45.590> there<00:02:45.950> this<00:02:46.610> is<00:02:46.850> a<00:02:46.880> start<00:02:47.300> switch<00:02:47.690> now

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
stators there this is a start switch now

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.300 
stators there this is a start switch now
I'm<00:02:47.990> going<00:02:48.140> to<00:02:48.200> show<00:02:48.410> you<00:02:48.440> how<00:02:48.770> this<00:02:49.010> thing's

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
I'm going to show you how this thing's

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:54.340 
I'm going to show you how this thing's
actuated<00:02:51.910> okay<00:02:52.910> we<00:02:53.090> call<00:02:53.330> this<00:02:53.540> a<00:02:53.600> centrifugal

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 
actuated okay we call this a centrifugal

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:57.729 
actuated okay we call this a centrifugal
switch<00:02:54.910> because<00:02:55.930> there's<00:02:56.930> weights<00:02:57.350> right

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:57.739 
switch because there's weights right

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:01.180 
switch because there's weights right
here<00:02:58.160> on<00:02:58.340> either<00:02:58.489> side<00:02:58.910> of<00:02:59.209> the<00:02:59.720> shaft<00:03:00.190> that

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
here on either side of the shaft that

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:05.290 
here on either side of the shaft that
will<00:03:02.060> work<00:03:02.300> against<00:03:02.840> these<00:03:03.020> Springs<00:03:03.500> and<00:03:04.300> when

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:05.300 
will work against these Springs and when

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:10.449 
will work against these Springs and when
the<00:03:05.420> speed<00:03:05.750> gets<00:03:05.959> up<00:03:06.200> to<00:03:06.350> 75%<00:03:07.010> of<00:03:08.410> the<00:03:09.459> running

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:10.459 
the speed gets up to 75% of the running

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:13.660 
the speed gets up to 75% of the running
speed<00:03:10.790> of<00:03:11.239> this<00:03:11.390> motor<00:03:11.690> this<00:03:11.930> one's<00:03:12.170> a<00:03:12.640> 1725<00:03:13.640> I

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670 
speed of this motor this one's a 1725 I

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:18.820 
speed of this motor this one's a 1725 I
think<00:03:14.709> but<00:03:15.709> it<00:03:15.800> gets<00:03:15.980> up<00:03:16.190> to<00:03:16.220> 75%<00:03:16.850> of<00:03:17.270> speed<00:03:17.830> it

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:18.830 
think but it gets up to 75% of speed it

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:22.060 
think but it gets up to 75% of speed it
will<00:03:19.190> move<00:03:19.489> these<00:03:19.850> weights<00:03:20.299> out<00:03:20.570> and<00:03:21.140> move

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:22.070 
will move these weights out and move

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:24.699 
will move these weights out and move
this<00:03:22.370> thing<00:03:22.640> down<00:03:23.000> now<00:03:23.450> I'm<00:03:24.170> going<00:03:24.380> to<00:03:24.440> just

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:24.709 
this thing down now I'm going to just

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:32.570 
this thing down now I'm going to just
use<00:03:24.799> a<00:03:24.980> screwdriver<00:03:25.190> to<00:03:25.850> demonstrate<00:03:26.600> that

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.580 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:36.040 

now<00:03:33.180> in<00:03:33.330> these<00:03:33.450> weights<00:03:33.780> go<00:03:34.050> out<00:03:34.230> and<00:03:35.130> you<00:03:35.280> see

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:36.050 
now in these weights go out and you see

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:43.070 
now in these weights go out and you see
this<00:03:37.050> ring<00:03:37.590> goes<00:03:37.830> down<00:03:39.170> and<00:03:40.460> it<00:03:41.460> kind<00:03:41.700> of<00:03:42.080> all

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:43.080 
this ring goes down and it kind of all

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.170 
this ring goes down and it kind of all
the<00:03:43.380> sudden<00:03:43.740> pops<00:03:44.040> like<00:03:44.400> that<00:03:44.640> that's<00:03:44.970> how<00:03:45.120> the

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
the sudden pops like that that's how the

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.460 
the sudden pops like that that's how the
switches<00:03:45.570> have<00:03:45.600> to<00:03:45.810> work<00:03:46.020> anyway<00:03:46.440> but<00:03:48.440> kind<00:03:49.440> of

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
switches have to work anyway but kind of

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:54.050 
switches have to work anyway but kind of
just<00:03:49.530> pops<00:03:50.070> out<00:03:50.340> like<00:03:50.580> that<00:03:50.990> okay<00:03:52.910> let's<00:03:53.910> take

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
just pops out like that okay let's take

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.800 
just pops out like that okay let's take
a<00:03:54.120> look<00:03:54.420> at<00:03:54.630> the<00:03:54.990> switch<00:03:55.320> itself<00:03:56.480> okay<00:03:57.480> here's

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
a look at the switch itself okay here's

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.380 
a look at the switch itself okay here's
the<00:03:58.020> end<00:03:58.230> bell<00:03:58.530> with<00:03:58.920> a<00:03:58.950> switch<00:03:59.370> in<00:03:59.640> it<00:03:59.760> kind<00:04:00.270> of

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
the end bell with a switch in it kind of

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:02.000 
the end bell with a switch in it kind of
shows<00:04:00.630> you<00:04:00.780> what<00:04:00.960> it<00:04:01.050> looks<00:04:01.290> like<00:04:01.560> I'll<00:04:01.800> get<00:04:01.950> a

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
shows you what it looks like I'll get a

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:06.950 
shows you what it looks like I'll get a
little<00:04:02.160> closer<00:04:02.520> on<00:04:02.760> it<00:04:03.060> here<00:04:05.690> okay<00:04:06.690> I've<00:04:06.780> taken

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:06.960 
little closer on it here okay I've taken

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:08.750 
little closer on it here okay I've taken
this<00:04:07.200> part<00:04:07.590> maybe<00:04:07.830> you<00:04:08.010> can<00:04:08.160> see<00:04:08.460> it<00:04:08.610> a<00:04:08.640> little

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
this part maybe you can see it a little

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.560 
this part maybe you can see it a little
better<00:04:09.030> the<00:04:09.360> action<00:04:09.870> of<00:04:10.020> it<00:04:10.140> anyway<00:04:11.390> it<00:04:12.390> would

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:12.570 
better the action of it anyway it would

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:14.330 
better the action of it anyway it would
normally<00:04:12.750> be<00:04:13.050> down<00:04:13.410> here<00:04:13.440> like<00:04:13.890> this<00:04:14.100> with

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
normally be down here like this with

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.310 
normally be down here like this with
these<00:04:14.490> clothes<00:04:14.820> and<00:04:15.060> start<00:04:15.510> winding<00:04:15.810> would<00:04:16.170> be

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
these clothes and start winding would be

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.460 
these clothes and start winding would be
engaged<00:04:16.769> and<00:04:17.580> then<00:04:17.970> it<00:04:18.090> pops<00:04:18.359> up<00:04:18.660> and<00:04:19.260> you<00:04:19.410> can

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
engaged and then it pops up and you can

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:22.009 
engaged and then it pops up and you can
see<00:04:19.769> the<00:04:19.890> condition<00:04:20.430> of<00:04:20.609> the<00:04:20.870> switches<00:04:21.870> in

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:22.019 
see the condition of the switches in

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:23.690 
see the condition of the switches in
there<00:04:22.260> I'll<00:04:22.410> probably<00:04:22.590> pop<00:04:23.040> those<00:04:23.280> out<00:04:23.520> and

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:23.700 
there I'll probably pop those out and

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:27.650 
there I'll probably pop those out and
you<00:04:23.820> can<00:04:24.000> take<00:04:24.150> a<00:04:24.180> look<00:04:24.420> at<00:04:24.690> them<00:04:26.270> now<00:04:27.270> you<00:04:27.330> can

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660 
you can take a look at them now you can

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.740 
you can take a look at them now you can
see<00:04:27.960> the<00:04:28.260> switch<00:04:28.860> in<00:04:29.130> there<00:04:29.370> the<00:04:30.240> contact

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:30.750 
see the switch in there the contact

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:33.230 
see the switch in there the contact
switch<00:04:31.020> doesn't<00:04:31.320> look<00:04:31.410> real<00:04:31.650> good<00:04:32.040> they<00:04:33.000> never

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240 
switch doesn't look real good they never

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.750 
switch doesn't look real good they never
do<00:04:33.450> look<00:04:33.630> really<00:04:33.930> good<00:04:34.080> but<00:04:34.380> this<00:04:35.340> one<00:04:35.550> was

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:35.760 
do look really good but this one was

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.140 
do look really good but this one was
actually<00:04:36.000> working<00:04:37.490> ok<00:04:38.490> that's<00:04:38.760> maybe<00:04:38.970> a

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150 
actually working ok that's maybe a

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.240 
actually working ok that's maybe a
little<00:04:39.210> better<00:04:39.570> view<00:04:39.960> of<00:04:40.230> the<00:04:40.620> other<00:04:40.830> set<00:04:41.220> of

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.250 
little better view of the other set of

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:43.970 
little better view of the other set of
contacts<00:04:42.150> there's<00:04:42.630> nothing<00:04:42.990> really<00:04:43.140> wrong

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:43.980 
contacts there's nothing really wrong

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:46.520 
contacts there's nothing really wrong
with<00:04:44.250> these<00:04:44.550> they<00:04:45.060> do<00:04:45.120> look<00:04:45.419> pitted<00:04:45.840> but<00:04:46.050> they

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.530 
with these they do look pitted but they

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:51.610 
with these they do look pitted but they
all<00:04:46.710> do<00:04:47.010> so<00:04:48.110> that<00:04:49.110> is<00:04:49.500> the<00:04:49.860> centrifugal<00:04:50.790> switch

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:51.620 
all do so that is the centrifugal switch

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:00.720

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:12.090 
failing now use this switch so that's

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:14.930 
failing now use this switch so that's
what<00:05:12.300> the<00:05:12.419> inside<00:05:12.570> that<00:05:12.990> thing<00:05:13.200> looks<00:05:13.470> like<00:05:13.940> if

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:14.940 
what the inside that thing looks like if

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:18.080 
what the inside that thing looks like if
you<00:05:15.360> were<00:05:15.419> just<00:05:15.720> curious
