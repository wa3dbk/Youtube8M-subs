still in the game now I'm going to show
this<00:00:08.340> for<00:00:08.550> two<00:00:08.790> reasons<00:00:08.820> the<00:00:09.300> first<00:00:09.389> reason<00:00:09.690> is

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
this for two reasons the first reason is

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.140 
this for two reasons the first reason is
that<00:00:10.110> we<00:00:10.320> show<00:00:10.500> tips<00:00:10.769> here<00:00:10.980> and<00:00:11.160> the<00:00:11.730> second

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
that we show tips here and the second

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:13.820 
that we show tips here and the second
reason<00:00:12.179> and<00:00:12.630> most<00:00:12.750> important<00:00:13.320> is<00:00:13.500> that<00:00:13.530> with

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
reason and most important is that with

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.919 
reason and most important is that with
EA<00:00:14.070> making<00:00:14.549> such<00:00:14.790> big<00:00:15.059> changes<00:00:15.509> in<00:00:15.630> the<00:00:15.719> game

this year making it more sim friendly

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.269 
this year making it more sim friendly
isn't<00:00:19.109> it<00:00:19.170> about<00:00:19.289> time<00:00:19.410> that<00:00:19.770> they<00:00:19.920> took<00:00:20.070> out

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
isn't it about time that they took out

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.279 
isn't it about time that they took out
one<00:00:20.430> of<00:00:20.460> the<00:00:20.609> easiest<00:00:21.119> nano<00:00:21.510> type<00:00:21.810> blitzes<00:00:22.170> in

shaking you're going to want to bump and

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.819 
shaking you're going to want to bump and
run<00:00:38.940> but<00:00:39.210> when<00:00:39.450> bumping<00:00:39.960> this<00:00:40.410> will<00:00:40.680> bring

run but when bumping this will bring

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.440 
run but when bumping this will bring
your<00:00:40.980> linebackers<00:00:41.219> back<00:00:41.850> a<00:00:41.879> couple<00:00:42.180> steps

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
your linebackers back a couple steps

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.660 
your linebackers back a couple steps
like<00:00:42.750> you<00:00:42.870> see<00:00:43.079> here<00:00:43.110> but<00:00:44.070> no<00:00:44.219> need<00:00:44.399> to<00:00:44.489> worry

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
like you see here but no need to worry

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.430 
like you see here but no need to worry
once<00:00:44.940> you<00:00:45.059> start<00:00:45.329> shaking<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:45.870> linebackers

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
once you start shaking the linebackers

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.840 
once you start shaking the linebackers
they're<00:00:46.590> going<00:00:46.710> to<00:00:46.770> take<00:00:46.890> a<00:00:46.950> couple<00:00:47.250> steps<00:00:47.460> off

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
they're going to take a couple steps off

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.119 
they're going to take a couple steps off
the<00:00:48.059> line<00:00:48.270> anyway<00:00:48.840> so<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:49.950> biggest

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
the line anyway so the biggest

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.400 
the line anyway so the biggest
difference<00:00:50.640> in<00:00:50.850> this<00:00:51.149> from<00:00:51.449> Madden<00:00:51.780> 12<00:00:52.020> is<00:00:52.260> the

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
difference in this from Madden 12 is the

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.069 
difference in this from Madden 12 is the
rate<00:00:52.590> in<00:00:52.739> which<00:00:52.770> you<00:00:53.039> shift<00:00:53.309> your<00:00:53.399> linebackers

00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:54.079 
rate in which you shift your linebackers

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:56.119 
rate in which you shift your linebackers
previously<00:00:55.079> you<00:00:55.170> can<00:00:55.320> go<00:00:55.440> back<00:00:55.680> and<00:00:55.710> forth

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
previously you can go back and forth

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.580 
previously you can go back and forth
like<00:00:56.219> you<00:00:56.430> see<00:00:56.670> here<00:00:56.699> at<00:00:57.149> a<00:00:57.180> solid<00:00:57.480> pace<00:00:57.660> but

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
like you see here at a solid pace but

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.560 
like you see here at a solid pace but
that<00:00:58.770> doesn't<00:00:59.190> work<00:00:59.340> this<00:00:59.489> year<00:00:59.550> in<00:00:59.940> madden<00:01:00.539> 13

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
that doesn't work this year in madden 13

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.569 
that doesn't work this year in madden 13
you<00:01:01.079> must<00:01:01.260> be<00:01:01.410> more<00:01:01.710> patient<00:01:02.039> with<00:01:02.309> your

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
you must be more patient with your

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.210 
you must be more patient with your
shaking<00:01:02.820> you<00:01:03.539> start<00:01:03.930> out<00:01:04.019> by<00:01:04.199> pressing<00:01:04.589> RB<00:01:05.040> and

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
then left on the analog stick whichever

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.719 
then left on the analog stick whichever
direction<00:01:07.380> you<00:01:07.409> choose<00:01:07.500> then<00:01:08.430> wait<00:01:08.700> until

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
direction you choose then wait until

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.000

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
your linebackers are almost stopped but

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.179 
your linebackers are almost stopped but
still<00:01:11.310> moving<00:01:11.760> press<00:01:12.570> RB<00:01:13.049> again<00:01:13.409> and<00:01:13.680> then<00:01:14.040> the

now I'm going to show it again with one
slight<00:01:33.750> change<00:01:34.320> given<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.310> rate<00:01:35.520> in<00:01:35.729> which

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
slight change given the rate in which

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.690 
slight change given the rate in which
your<00:01:36.060> linebacker<00:01:36.509> can<00:01:36.869> shoot<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.200> a<00:01:37.350> gap<00:01:37.710> even
