00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
want to do the same but to start out

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.560 
want to do the same but to start out
what<00:01:06.900> you<00:01:06.990> want<00:01:07.140> to<00:01:07.200> do<00:01:07.380> is<00:01:07.740> take<00:01:08.100> these<00:01:08.540> make<00:01:09.540> a

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
what you want to do is take these make a

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:16.840 
what you want to do is take these make a
loop<00:01:09.840> like<00:01:10.110> this<00:01:13.880> put<00:01:14.880> both<00:01:15.060> of<00:01:15.090> these<00:01:15.300> in<00:01:15.540> here

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 
loop like this put both of these in here

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:21.010 
loop like this put both of these in here
just<00:01:17.850> like<00:01:18.030> so

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.020 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.140 

one<00:01:21.620> of<00:01:21.710> the<00:01:21.800> key<00:01:21.950> things<00:01:22.250> to<00:01:22.400> doing<00:01:22.760> this<00:01:22.880> guys

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:23.150 
one of the key things to doing this guys

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.020 
one of the key things to doing this guys
is<00:01:23.500> make<00:01:24.500> sure<00:01:24.710> that<00:01:24.860> you're<00:01:25.070> you're<00:01:25.610> pulling

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
is make sure that you're you're pulling

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.800 
is make sure that you're you're pulling
everything<00:01:26.240> tight<00:01:27.040> so<00:01:28.420> that's<00:01:29.420> going<00:01:29.600> to<00:01:29.690> be

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
everything tight so that's going to be

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.730 
everything tight so that's going to be
the<00:01:29.960> start<00:01:31.600> you<00:01:32.600> can<00:01:32.750> also<00:01:32.870> pull<00:01:33.320> this<00:01:33.440> tight

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
the start you can also pull this tight

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.230 
the start you can also pull this tight
to<00:01:34.040> where<00:01:34.160> your<00:01:34.880> tag<00:01:35.180> end<00:01:35.479> is<00:01:35.750> a<00:01:35.780> lot<00:01:36.050> shorter

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240 
to where your tag end is a lot shorter

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:43.230 
to where your tag end is a lot shorter
all<00:01:38.240> you<00:01:38.840> would<00:01:38.960> do<00:01:39.080> with<00:01:39.229> this<00:01:40.150> would<00:01:41.150> be<00:01:41.300> to

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240 
all you would do with this would be to

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:52.660 
all you would do with this would be to
clip<00:01:44.240> it<00:01:48.670> get<00:01:49.670> it<00:01:49.820> fairly<00:01:50.000> close<00:01:51.070> to<00:01:52.070> the<00:01:52.100> bar

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
clip it get it fairly close to the bar

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.389 
clip it get it fairly close to the bar
itself<00:01:53.300> and<00:01:54.290> then<00:01:54.470> you<00:01:54.649> take<00:01:55.009> your<00:01:55.040> lighter

00:01:55.389 --> 00:01:55.399 
itself and then you take your lighter

00:01:55.399 --> 00:02:00.460 
itself and then you take your lighter
and<00:01:56.890> sends<00:01:57.890> the<00:01:57.979> edge<00:01:58.160> at<00:01:58.820> the<00:01:59.090> edge<00:01:59.290> and<00:02:00.290> once

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:00.470 
and sends the edge at the edge and once

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.550 
and sends the edge at the edge and once
you<00:02:00.560> do<00:02:00.770> that<00:02:00.800> once<00:02:01.790> it<00:02:01.970> gets<00:02:02.090> really<00:02:02.360> hot<00:02:02.600> you

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
you do that once it gets really hot you

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:09.490 
you do that once it gets really hot you
just<00:02:03.770> rub<00:02:04.280> it<00:02:05.290> rub<00:02:06.290> it<00:02:06.440> into<00:02:06.560> the<00:02:06.830> other<00:02:08.500> parts

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
just rub it rub it into the other parts

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.640 
just rub it rub it into the other parts
of<00:02:09.590> the<00:02:09.679> cord<00:02:09.950> that<00:02:10.220> way<00:02:10.399> it<00:02:11.080> you<00:02:12.080> know<00:02:12.170> adheres

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
of the cord that way it you know adheres

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.770 
of the cord that way it you know adheres
to<00:02:12.890> it<00:02:13.040> and<00:02:13.220> it<00:02:13.820> doesn't<00:02:14.180> move<00:02:14.300> then<00:02:14.600> it's

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
to it and it doesn't move then it's

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.250 
to it and it doesn't move then it's
completely<00:02:15.170> secure<00:02:15.470> at<00:02:15.830> that<00:02:16.010> point<00:02:17.200> now<00:02:18.200> the

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
completely secure at that point now the

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.400 
completely secure at that point now the
wrap<00:02:18.500> itself<00:02:18.920> is<00:02:19.160> really<00:02:19.400> simple<00:02:20.410> especially

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
wrap itself is really simple especially

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.490 
wrap itself is really simple especially
once<00:02:21.830> you<00:02:21.920> get<00:02:22.070> the<00:02:22.160> hang<00:02:22.370> of<00:02:22.520> it<00:02:22.640> you<00:02:23.500> pretty

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
once you get the hang of it you pretty

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.100 
once you get the hang of it you pretty
much<00:02:24.620> want<00:02:24.800> to<00:02:24.890> go<00:02:25.040> over<00:02:25.640> under<00:02:25.850> is<00:02:26.239> what

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
much want to go over under is what

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.140 
much want to go over under is what
you're<00:02:27.260> doing<00:02:27.590> the<00:02:27.709> whole<00:02:27.920> time<00:02:28.160> so<00:02:28.850> what<00:02:29.000> I<00:02:29.030> do

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
you're doing the whole time so what I do

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.479 
you're doing the whole time so what I do
is<00:02:29.450> I<00:02:29.570> create<00:02:29.630> this<00:02:30.019> loop<00:02:30.290> I<00:02:30.560> grab<00:02:30.920> this<00:02:31.100> in<00:02:31.340> the

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:31.489 
is I create this loop I grab this in the

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:36.160 
is I create this loop I grab this in the
left<00:02:31.940> hand<00:02:32.209> I<00:02:32.390> put<00:02:33.290> my<00:02:33.440> wrist<00:02:33.739> and<00:02:33.980> the<00:02:34.970> loop<00:02:35.209> go

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
left hand I put my wrist and the loop go

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:44.410 
left hand I put my wrist and the loop go
over<00:02:37.299> and<00:02:38.739> pull<00:02:39.739> it<00:02:39.769> tight<00:02:41.650> like<00:02:42.650> so<00:02:43.390> make<00:02:44.390> sure

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
over and pull it tight like so make sure

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.320 
over and pull it tight like so make sure
you're<00:02:44.780> really<00:02:45.110> stretching<00:02:45.650> the<00:02:45.950> cord<00:02:46.250> is<00:02:47.180> you

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330 
you're really stretching the cord is you

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:51.130 
you're really stretching the cord is you
want<00:02:47.510> to<00:02:47.570> get<00:02:47.720> a<00:02:47.750> really<00:02:48.170> fine<00:02:48.410> look<00:02:49.209> now<00:02:50.209> now

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
what I would do I would go under come up

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.320 
what I would do I would go under come up
underneath<00:02:55.910> here<00:02:56.269> in<00:02:56.420> the<00:02:56.540> loop<00:02:56.720> and<00:02:56.959> grab<00:02:57.410> it

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:58.330 
underneath here in the loop and grab it

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:06.910 
underneath here in the loop and grab it
pull<00:02:59.330> it<00:02:59.510> really<00:02:59.750> tight<00:03:04.269> like<00:03:05.269> so<00:03:05.560> next<00:03:06.560> time
