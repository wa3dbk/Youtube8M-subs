00:04:33.939 --> 00:04:33.949 
take a look at the core and let me

00:04:33.949 --> 00:04:35.460 
take a look at the core and let me
explain<00:04:34.220> that<00:04:34.280> and<00:04:34.610> also<00:04:34.910> take<00:04:35.060> a<00:04:35.120> look<00:04:35.270> at<00:04:35.330> the

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:46.409 
video cards and you can find it online
so<00:04:44.660> let's<00:04:45.350> do<00:04:45.440> that<00:04:45.560> right<00:04:45.740> now

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:46.419 
so let's do that right now

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:49.710 
so let's do that right now
all<00:04:47.419> right<00:04:47.570> here<00:04:47.840> we<00:04:47.960> can<00:04:48.080> see<00:04:48.139> that<00:04:48.440> the

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:49.720 
all right here we can see that the

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:53.409 
all right here we can see that the
bottom<00:04:50.720> of<00:04:50.840> the<00:04:51.560> cyclone<00:04:52.310> to<00:04:52.550> cooling<00:04:52.880> system

00:04:53.409 --> 00:04:53.419 
bottom of the cyclone to cooling system

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:56.529 
bottom of the cyclone to cooling system
is<00:04:53.600> a<00:04:53.990> nickel<00:04:54.350> plated<00:04:54.770> copper<00:04:55.340> base<00:04:55.699> see<00:04:56.360> there

00:04:56.529 --> 00:04:56.539 
is a nickel plated copper base see there

00:04:56.539 --> 00:04:58.390 
is a nickel plated copper base see there
and<00:04:56.690> it's<00:04:56.840> quite<00:04:57.260> big<00:04:57.530> but<00:04:57.560> of<00:04:57.830> course<00:04:58.039> it<00:04:58.220> only

00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:58.400 
and it's quite big but of course it only

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.580 
and it's quite big but of course it only
makes<00:04:58.639> contact<00:04:59.090> with<00:04:59.389> the<00:04:59.900> coal<00:05:00.229> right<00:05:00.410> in<00:05:00.500> the

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:00.590 
makes contact with the coal right in the

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:02.890 
makes contact with the coal right in the
middle<00:05:00.770> of<00:05:00.889> the<00:05:01.250> core<00:05:01.490> it<00:05:02.090> doesn't<00:05:02.539> have<00:05:02.720> an

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:02.900 
middle of the core it doesn't have an

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:05.140 
middle of the core it doesn't have an
integrated<00:05:03.560> heatsink<00:05:04.039> system<00:05:04.340> it<00:05:04.760> just<00:05:05.000> has

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:05.150 
integrated heatsink system it just has

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:07.120 
integrated heatsink system it just has
an<00:05:05.539> exposed<00:05:05.990> to<00:05:06.229> chorus<00:05:06.620> off<00:05:06.770> right<00:05:06.919> there<00:05:07.100> and

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:07.130 
an exposed to chorus off right there and

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:10.060 
an exposed to chorus off right there and
just<00:05:08.060> so<00:05:08.419> that<00:05:08.660> you<00:05:08.870> can<00:05:08.990> see<00:05:09.169> that<00:05:09.320> it<00:05:09.500> is<00:05:09.560> if

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:10.070 
just so that you can see that it is if

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:12.070 
just so that you can see that it is if
you're<00:05:10.280> close<00:05:10.639> see<00:05:10.880> there's<00:05:11.090> actually<00:05:11.479> a<00:05:11.510> GK

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:12.080 
you're close see there's actually a GK

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:16.210 
you're close see there's actually a GK
106<00:05:12.830> that's<00:05:13.010> mentioned<00:05:13.750> compared<00:05:14.750> to<00:05:14.900> the<00:05:15.220> GK

106 that's mentioned compared to the GK

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:19.750 
106 that's mentioned compared to the GK

hynix<00:05:46.430> memory<00:05:47.120> chips<00:05:47.330> and<00:05:47.949> yeah<00:05:49.010> they<00:05:49.550> have

00:05:49.629 --> 00:05:49.639 
hynix memory chips and yeah they have

the military cost components that msi

00:06:01.789 --> 00:06:04.240 
the military cost components that msi
use<00:06:02.000> you<00:06:02.270> have<00:06:02.389> your<00:06:02.740> carry<00:06:03.740> three<00:06:04.010> plus<00:06:04.190> one

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:04.250 
use you have your carry three plus one

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:06.490 
use you have your carry three plus one
phase<00:06:04.669> here<00:06:04.880> i<00:06:04.910> can<00:06:05.210> see<00:06:05.389> so<00:06:05.810> it's<00:06:05.930> it<00:06:06.169> should

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:06.500 
phase here i can see so it's it should

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:08.170 
phase here i can see so it's it should
be<00:06:06.560> able<00:06:06.889> to<00:06:07.039> overclock<00:06:07.550> a<00:06:07.639> lot<00:06:07.940> better

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:08.180 
be able to overclock a lot better

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:11.560 
be able to overclock a lot better
