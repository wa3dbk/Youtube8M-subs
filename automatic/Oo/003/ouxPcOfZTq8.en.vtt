interesting working with this team and

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:16.960 
interesting working with this team and
working<00:00:14.390> on<00:00:14.660> on<00:00:14.960> this<00:00:15.170> whole<00:00:15.350> project<00:00:15.970> which

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:16.970 
working on on this whole project which

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:19.839 
working on on this whole project which
actually<00:00:17.150> I<00:00:17.330> just<00:00:17.359> started<00:00:18.009> doing<00:00:19.009> bsp<00:00:19.640> and

00:00:19.839 --> 00:00:19.849 
actually I just started doing bsp and

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:23.290 
actually I just started doing bsp and
stuff<00:00:19.999> is<00:00:20.210> that<00:00:20.919> before<00:00:21.919> we<00:00:22.130> even<00:00:22.220> like<00:00:22.849> get

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:23.300 
stuff is that before we even like get

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.359 
stuff is that before we even like get
into<00:00:23.449> max<00:00:23.839> we<00:00:24.230> already<00:00:24.529> know<00:00:24.679> what<00:00:24.919> enemies

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:25.369 
into max we already know what enemies

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:27.130 
into max we already know what enemies
were<00:00:25.550> talking<00:00:25.939> about<00:00:26.029> and<00:00:26.659> what<00:00:26.810> kind<00:00:27.050> of

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:27.140 
were talking about and what kind of

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:28.749 
were talking about and what kind of
geometry<00:00:27.769> and<00:00:27.829> what<00:00:27.949> kind<00:00:28.099> of<00:00:28.159> elements<00:00:28.609> we're

00:00:28.749 --> 00:00:28.759 
geometry and what kind of elements we're

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:31.569 
geometry and what kind of elements we're
going<00:00:28.880> to<00:00:28.939> be<00:00:29.169> you<00:00:30.169> know<00:00:30.289> employing<00:00:30.769> so<00:00:31.429> that

00:00:31.569 --> 00:00:31.579 
going to be you know employing so that

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:33.040 
going to be you know employing so that
the<00:00:31.669> player<00:00:31.909> can<00:00:31.970> interact<00:00:32.480> these<00:00:32.780> enemies

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:33.050 
the player can interact these enemies

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.099 
the player can interact these enemies
and<00:00:33.730> it's<00:00:34.730> so<00:00:34.879> it's<00:00:35.000> very<00:00:35.090> interesting<00:00:35.539> every

00:00:36.099 --> 00:00:36.109 
and it's so it's very interesting every

00:00:36.109 --> 00:00:37.630 
and it's so it's very interesting every
single<00:00:36.289> thing<00:00:36.469> you<00:00:36.739> put<00:00:36.980> into<00:00:37.190> place<00:00:37.399> here

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:37.640 
single thing you put into place here

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.959 
single thing you put into place here
you're<00:00:37.910> trying<00:00:38.239> to<00:00:38.329> figure<00:00:38.570> out<00:00:38.629> how<00:00:39.969> like

00:00:40.959 --> 00:00:40.969 
you're trying to figure out how like

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:44.410 
you're trying to figure out how like
what<00:00:41.149> impact<00:00:41.539> is<00:00:41.719> going<00:00:41.840> to<00:00:42.019> have<00:00:42.289> on<00:00:43.180> the<00:00:44.180> the

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:44.420 
what impact is going to have on the the

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:46.770 
what impact is going to have on the the
gameplay<00:00:44.899> for<00:00:45.109> that<00:00:45.230> particular<00:00:45.469> space

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:46.780 
gameplay for that particular space

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.180 
gameplay for that particular space
during<00:00:47.780> pre-production<00:00:48.079> of<00:00:48.620> our<00:00:48.739> maps<00:00:48.980> we

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:49.190 
during pre-production of our maps we

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.270 
during pre-production of our maps we
always<00:00:49.489> try<00:00:50.239> to<00:00:50.530> define<00:00:51.530> our<00:00:51.769> game<00:00:52.039> play

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280 
always try to define our game play

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.490 
always try to define our game play
before<00:00:52.579> we<00:00:52.910> actually<00:00:53.120> move<00:00:53.629> on<00:00:53.809> to<00:00:54.079> aesthetics

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:54.500 
before we actually move on to aesthetics

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.450 
before we actually move on to aesthetics
that<00:00:54.820> way<00:00:55.820> we<00:00:56.269> can<00:00:56.420> have<00:00:56.600> our<00:00:56.989> game<00:00:57.949> play<00:00:58.129> set

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:58.460 
that way we can have our game play set

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.520 
that way we can have our game play set
in<00:00:58.550> stone<00:00:58.820> and<00:00:59.120> then<00:00:59.719> we<00:00:59.870> can<00:00:59.899> spend<00:01:00.260> the<00:01:00.410> rest

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 
in stone and then we can spend the rest

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.259 
in stone and then we can spend the rest
of<00:01:00.710> our<00:01:00.800> efforts<00:01:01.219> trying<00:01:01.399> to<00:01:01.609> make<00:01:01.820> the<00:01:02.089> map

00:01:02.259 --> 00:01:02.269 
of our efforts trying to make the map

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:04.479 
of our efforts trying to make the map
look<00:01:02.539> better<00:01:02.809> and<00:01:03.019> optimizing<00:01:03.800> our<00:01:03.980> frames

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:04.489 
look better and optimizing our frames

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:07.480 
look better and optimizing our frames
per<00:01:04.759> second<00:01:05.170> so<00:01:06.170> if<00:01:06.500> there<00:01:06.740> was<00:01:06.860> ever<00:01:07.070> any

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.490 
per second so if there was ever any

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.399 
per second so if there was ever any
change<00:01:07.970> we<00:01:08.180> had<00:01:08.299> to<00:01:08.390> do<00:01:08.479> the<00:01:08.630> gameplay<00:01:09.020> we<00:01:09.259> can

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:09.409 
change we had to do the gameplay we can

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:11.319 
change we had to do the gameplay we can
focus<00:01:09.890> on<00:01:10.130> that<00:01:10.250> in<00:01:10.430> pre-production<00:01:10.729> rather

00:01:11.319 --> 00:01:11.329 
focus on that in pre-production rather

00:01:11.329 --> 00:01:13.359 
focus on that in pre-production rather
than<00:01:11.540> offset<00:01:12.350> all<00:01:12.500> of<00:01:12.650> our<00:01:12.770> art<00:01:12.979> we<00:01:13.159> already

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:13.369 
than offset all of our art we already

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:22.780 
than offset all of our art we already
made<00:01:13.549> for<00:01:13.759> it

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:22.790 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.429 

in<00:01:23.790> memorial<00:01:24.420> we've<00:01:24.600> tried<00:01:24.869> to<00:01:24.899> keep<00:01:25.200> our

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
in memorial we've tried to keep our

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.380 
in memorial we've tried to keep our
encounters<00:01:25.860> very<00:01:26.040> logical<00:01:26.579> and<00:01:26.790> we've<00:01:27.000> tried

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
encounters very logical and we've tried

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.719 
encounters very logical and we've tried
to<00:01:27.810> like<00:01:28.100> instead<00:01:29.100> of<00:01:29.159> just<00:01:29.280> adding<00:01:29.460> like

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
to like instead of just adding like

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.550 
to like instead of just adding like
random<00:01:30.060> enemies<00:01:30.390> we<00:01:30.540> like<00:01:30.720> place<00:01:31.140> them<00:01:31.320> and

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
random enemies we like place them and

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.980 
random enemies we like place them and
they<00:01:31.680> actually<00:01:31.890> induce<00:01:32.479> another<00:01:33.479> thing<00:01:33.899> we

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
they actually induce another thing we

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.550 
they actually induce another thing we
try<00:01:34.170> to<00:01:34.229> do<00:01:34.409> in<00:01:34.560> this<00:01:35.000> map<00:01:36.000> is<00:01:36.299> we<00:01:36.659> try<00:01:36.840> to<00:01:36.899> make

feel alive as it does actually something
important<00:01:45.750> happening<00:01:46.140> rather<00:01:46.380> than<00:01:46.619> just

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
important happening rather than just

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.859 
important happening rather than just
placing<00:01:47.789> the<00:01:47.820> enemies<00:01:48.210> here<00:01:48.570> and<00:01:48.720> there

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
little bridge scenario at first we just

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.529 
little bridge scenario at first we just
took<00:02:04.560> a<00:02:04.740> normal<00:02:05.130> Warhawk<00:02:05.580> but<00:02:06.270> they<00:02:06.360> soon

00:02:06.529 --> 00:02:06.539 
took a normal Warhawk but they soon

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:08.389 
took a normal Warhawk but they soon
found<00:02:06.720> that<00:02:06.869> to<00:02:07.110> be<00:02:07.140> a<00:02:07.259> very<00:02:07.560> frustrating<00:02:08.280> and

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
found that to be a very frustrating and

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:15.350 
found that to be a very frustrating and
difficult<00:02:08.729> encounter<00:02:13.790> so<00:02:14.790> what<00:02:15.000> we<00:02:15.150> did<00:02:15.299> was

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
difficult encounter so what we did was

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.320 
difficult encounter so what we did was
we<00:02:15.930> busiest<00:02:16.350> replaced<00:02:17.069> the<00:02:17.519> war<00:02:17.730> hog<00:02:17.910> and<00:02:18.180> the
