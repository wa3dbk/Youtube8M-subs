00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:07.109
 and yes that's it they arrive nexus 5 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.130
 and in the cottages or getting ready to 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:09.330
 happen because it's true he's 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.820
 out of stock 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.929
 regularly test this new 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.980
 google phone went right away 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.980
 on the 01net techno channel 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.140
 and as always it flows 

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:40.520
 a lot of ink a nexus since you 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.520
 know it's the google phone 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:46.800
 very nice game your prayer to google 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:49.769
 yeah yeah good peculiarity it's 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.199
 from google goo one out and 

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:53.850
 also inside that's with the 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.570
 first bone that makes you fat because 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.129
 is called kit kat 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.839
 and as much to tell you that you have to go 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.910
 soft arm on the kit kat it's not very 

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:02.850
 very good so so the new 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.800
 google smartphone you said it with a 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.050
 signed manufacture lg becomes a 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:09.090
 habit now at google it does 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:10.770
 appeal to the Koreans to realize its 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.500
 smartphones so it looks like a lot 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.330
 to phone that we already tested yes so 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.880
 yes and no it's true it's built on 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.710
 the base of the LG2 but in reality does 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.970
 not look all that watched the g2 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.170
 they had a button on the back there ya 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.369
 no buttons at the back of the townships 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.570
 who screwdriver and demonstrates the now 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.130
 to show that inside that 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.930
 looks like but it's the same structure 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:32.190
 it's true a base is the same 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:34.679
 chassis design I was going to say very sober 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:36.030
 very pure in the image of our software erp 

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:38.430
 so they say and here we are not very 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.930
 convinced it's a disaster looks very 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.150
 sober good after it's a matter of 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.049
 taste foster and it's true me 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.060
 personally I preferred single 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.159
 hole up and not that's sexier 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.259
 a question is not monobloc 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.479
 so we can distinguish this little border 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.979
 all around that hints that he 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.119
 is pieces time she could 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.659
 almost open it but we can not 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.470
 open 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:02:00.240
 So it's like that with so to 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.490
 the back a skin style skin 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:06.030
 fishing that's pretty nice 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.560
 that's a screen of 4 95 inches 5 inches 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.670
 was too complicated so we stop at 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.799
 4.95 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.660
 he is taller of course and finer 

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:14.519
 that the nexus 4 1 while its screen 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.019
 is bigger and so it exists in two 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:17.579
 black and white colors didier al sadd and 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:19.140
 Jerome is to have both one like 

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:20.280
 that and we coordinate with our clothes 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.450
 dirty says if you take the white in 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.680
 do you have both because that's 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.630
 a little weird it is white the back 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.860
 but the blacks on the front is what 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:29.570
 they called to this painting listens to me 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.570
 I probably do not know your 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.400
 and well the first strong point and that's 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.440
 for that a little bit that binds him to this 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.870
 kind of crowd movement around the 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.459
 nexus is its price because once 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.380
 again and phone to one euro it's not 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:44.330
 dear there frankly they do very very 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.370
 strong jc will act nothing but it's true 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:48.470
 we are really in a very low price 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.810
 for spectra that are quite high 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:53.690
 that's 349 euros for the 16 gigabyte version 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.040
 we go to 3.99 for the 32 gigas ne 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:58.400
 do not look elsewhere at report level 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:00.650
 quality price this new nexus 5 and makes 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.970
 really part of the top of the rouiba basket 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.319
 yahia it starts to fight anyway 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.610
 on this price segment 1 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:06.650
 that is, it motorola is 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:08.209
 terrible altogether but there will not be 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.650
 dear uncle he is less so in fact there is 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:11.180
 technical specifications that are 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:13.970
 still a little less high of 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.319
 range that this nexus 1,4 and obviously there 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:16.610
 we do not compare with phones 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:19.760
 Chinese who they break the prices 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:22.519
 really another strong point android 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.799
 android and pure android so even if that 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:28.069
 is discussing one because well there is 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:30.769
 those who are going to say the geek like this 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:32.360
 other side there is that there is nothing at 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:33.410
 above and it's especially the mouth here 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.519
 and then especially the updates that 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:35.780
 arrive in preview on this 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:38.120
 phone the latest versions 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.720
 from android arrives on arrive on the 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.000
 nexus 5 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.410
 and then other consumers will be able to 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.690
 prefer, on the contrary, versions 1 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:46.880
 but he can enrich with 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:49.670
 overcoats lg samsung etc 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:51.319
 htc alt then the full hd screen 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:53.540
 very bright if that's a strong point 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:55.130
 10 strong points and then the top 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:56.390
 speakers are also better placed 1 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:58.190
 but yes because it will be a little better 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:01.310
 on the nexus 4 he was at the back 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:03.200
 when you put the thing down flat 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.220
 to completely silence the sound and while 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.060
 that there they had the intelligence of the 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.920
 put on the slice 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:08.269
 but which poses another problem is 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:09.500
 that sometimes when we trap it like that 

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:11.000
 in a mouthful loudspeakers and heard 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:12.500
 the speakers tent outdoors 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.980
 cinemas are to be seen we will not get out 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.980
 without meal 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:20.090
 so first weak point and that's 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:20.570
 still a little annoying for a 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:22.669
 smartphone 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:24.259
 you're right to do that like that 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:26.960
 an autonomy that is really not 

00:04:24.259 --> 00:04:28.220
 terrible not on this nexus 5 and it's a 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.449
 surprise a jérôme it's completely 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:32.660
 a surprise the American sites 

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:34.310
 immediately pointed to 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:35.930
 or ngoua that word sallow he had even 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:36.949
 doubts we thought it was good 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:38.479
 not possible it was the first 

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:41.690
 versions who who had a problem 

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:43.759
 visibly no we also found the 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:44.449
 0 lab to joke find out it's not 

00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:46.220
 terrible terrible 

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:48.139
 for example in web browsing we are in 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:49.520
 below the 9 o'clock mark and 

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:51.229
 still a little the union minimum 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:53.000
 today for one for a smartphone 

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:54.710
 will see the exact figures on 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.270
 01net.com it's true it's not 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:58.490
 terrible so good maybe a bet 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:59.630
 kat kit will be able to adjust some 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:00.949
 problems we know that sometimes the bets 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:03.020
 up to date it will necessarily optimized for 

00:05:00.949 --> 00:05:04.550
 autonomies but the main concern 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:06.620
 is that this phone ends up with 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:08.990
 a battery that is not very powerful 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:11.810
 did the 2 2003 san millan eur pair 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:14.449
 when we compare for example or lg of 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:16.910
 vote on what we evoked his clone 

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:18.470
 here we are at 3000 millan eur pair and 

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:20.210
 so that's why of course in one 

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:21.590
 autonomy that is less yes it's a 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:24.470
 little damage not wanted to compete 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:25.099
 to jets two years probably the device 

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:27.590
 photo 6 1 

00:05:25.099 --> 00:05:30.500
 yeah the camera not very responsive 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:31.970
 it brings us back a little bit closer 

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:34.190
 a few months or years we are in 

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:35.900
 rear cases lille image quality 

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:37.130
 on the other hand does not dishonor 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:39.500
 to look at it is to compare with 

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:41.180
 the iphone 5 is good it's not bad 

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:42.470
 still okay but what is 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:43.820
 shame it's true it's this lack 

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:44.449
 of reactivity is a little angry when 

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:47.720
 we take pictures 

00:05:44.449 --> 00:05:49.159
 another point we will say unpleasant it's 

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:51.020
 virtual buttons in fact they are 

00:05:49.159 --> 00:05:52.220
 in the screen and the problem is that they 

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:53.570
 are in the screen and where do you have 

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:56.539
 found with a screen that is 

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:58.340
 so-called 4.95 inches and you have 

00:05:56.539 --> 00:06:00.860
 the bottom of the screen that ate 

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:01.940
 so by the android buttons this is 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:04.880
 usual nerd we liked it to 

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:06.020
 outside but yes we have a surface 

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:08.570
 of display which is bigger but there 

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:10.070
 no, that's another good specificity 

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:11.449
 I think at lexus is love it 

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:12.860
 is that there is no SD port for when 

00:06:11.449 --> 00:06:15.139
 you buy a 16 gigabyte phone or 

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:16.580
 32 gigabytes bebye paris 16 gigabytes or 32 gigas 

00:06:15.139 --> 00:06:19.039
 increase the memory it was the case 

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:20.750
 by the way lg g20 the group blames 

00:06:19.039 --> 00:06:22.759
 we were doing on this phone as we 

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:23.310
 could not add card 

00:06:22.759 --> 00:06:24.900
 sd 

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:26.880
 we can also deplore the fact that 

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:28.950
 the battery is not removable 

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:30.060
 we did not change it my opinion that 

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:31.320
 it's really a problem because 

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:33.080
 that all smartphones are like that 

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:36.080
 finally you have to do it 

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:39.320
 and more there is a look a little more fun 

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:42.570
 but on the other hand the big black dot 

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:44.250
 is that there is not but it was 

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:45.030
 already very little it was doubts and 

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:47.100
 it was already the case last year 

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:48.540
 for lexus 4 1 you always have to 

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:51.210
 fight or awakened at 3 am 

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:52.620
 go to the site attention paris they 

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:54.660
 have life that has 1 click on it 

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:56.280
 to see her here then is that 

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:56.700
 this programmed shortage on the part of 

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:57.840
 google 

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:59.580
 is it because precisely they 

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:02.010
 do not want to hurt too much 

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:03.810
 competitors style samsung lg sony 

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:05.760
 ericsson htc etc 

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:08.700
 we still have the pressure that google 

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:10.620
 gets out his nexus a little sneak a hiccup 

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:12.450
 we sell them a little under the mantle that 

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:13.740
 not on but it's true there was some 

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:16.140
 this impression recalled that on 

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:17.550
 google + so here it is as there are 

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:19.320
 not much and as in my opinion too 

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:20.730
 this iphone are slightly subsidized 

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:22.230
 by google because they are cheap 

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:24.300
 precisely there are not many so he 

00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:25.950
 have to fight to buy one 

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:29.190
 for the nexus 5 

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:31.410
 find on 01net.com the text the test 

00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:32.640
 precise he will offer the text also will have 

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:34.410
 texts relating text in fact 

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:35.340
 I had to tell me to test text here 

00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:37.800
 that you try text to text 

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:39.090
 that's exactly what you did 

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:40.620
 understood like you can compare it 

00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:42.630
 also to other smartphones of the moment 

00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:44.010
 thanks to comparators of 0 1 point 

00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:44.970
 as that is very handy going 

00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:45.780
