00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:53.949 

and<00:02:51.799> you<00:02:52.069> always<00:02:52.219> want<00:02:52.489> someone<00:02:53.420> to<00:02:53.540> hold<00:02:53.719> the

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959 
and you always want someone to hold the

00:02:53.959 --> 00:03:07.580

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:45.190 
I think that's a good amount and what
you<00:03:35.450> did<00:03:35.570> that<00:03:35.780> and<00:03:43.510> that's<00:03:44.510> how<00:03:44.690> you<00:03:44.750> rely<00:03:45.140> on

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 
you did that and that's how you rely on

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.340
