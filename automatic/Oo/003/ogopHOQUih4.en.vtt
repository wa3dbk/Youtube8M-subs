00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.830
 today the time has finally come for the decline of 4 to become official 

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:08.500
 available in the netherlands and to celebrate, it still has the honor of being the 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.500
 most expensive ajar in Amsterdam 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.630
 they have to lower on the occasion of the introduction of the iphone 4 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.430
 This is even so seeing that there is really that system operational 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:43.910
 stay 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.100
 that we may introduce more to the Netherlands 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.180
 just over two years ago 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.750
 as I myself designed for the introduction of the first out of 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:52.660
 The Netherlands 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.540
 and of course there was the first customer who was the first 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:59.320
 all iphone it is to get hold of and that is enterprise 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.500
 special 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.290
 four suspects 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:05.450
 that's hard to say 

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:06.520
 on Twitter 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.420
 the flight 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.780
 it is again the best sixteen that were secretly sold on a 3g s last 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.470
 year to put the two years 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:16.620
 it was overwhelming actually 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:21.230
 the soap and the media interest this morning there was a spectacle 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:24.750
 actually if you hadn't always gotten out of four from timo boll you would have 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.010
 then more and he certainly sold again 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.480
 how nice that you keep it for 3g doing that market 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.759
 maybe that list who knows x with a view to canceling 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.630
 think two years ago 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.570
 of course I have a pass or a city pass myself 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:03.960
 we have seen it in the past two years 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.480
 The number of mobile internet users still out of it increased 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:08.659
 those moments 

00:02:08.659 --> 00:02:11.800
 We are very happy that we have four new varieties as the only one in the Netherlands 

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:13.279
 may introduce 

00:02:13.279 --> 00:02:16.279

00:02:17.139 --> 00:02:19.419
 parties are for the iphone 

00:02:19.419 --> 00:02:22.909
 but well it ensures that you spotlight people there continuously 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:27.029
 both positive and negative in the news 

00:02:27.029 --> 00:02:30.029
 That is a very intensive attention to everything you do 

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:33.529
 nevertheless it also thinks that it is an annual contract 

00:02:33.529 --> 00:02:36.529
 sometimes points run forwards, so to speak 

00:02:37.139 --> 00:02:38.429

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:02.399
 but again we have in the past 

00:03:02.399 --> 00:03:04.229
 with a capacity of our network 

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:07.229

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:20.279
 before that, of course, we have to see that we are not yet 

00:03:20.279 --> 00:03:23.999

00:03:23.999 --> 00:03:27.299
