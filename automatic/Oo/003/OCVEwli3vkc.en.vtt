first<00:01:20.259> thing<00:01:20.470> across<00:01:20.740> my<00:01:20.890> mind<00:01:21.040> was<00:01:21.250> to<00:01:21.399> do

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 
first thing across my mind was to do

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.370 
first thing across my mind was to do
something<00:01:21.940> for<00:01:22.060> my<00:01:22.180> parents<00:01:22.570> now<00:01:22.990> I<00:01:23.049> can<00:01:23.290> be

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:23.380 
something for my parents now I can be

able<00:01:23.470> to<00:01:23.710> buy<00:01:23.860> everything<00:01:24.430> that<00:01:24.580> I<00:01:24.759> wanted

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 
able to buy everything that I wanted

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.590 
able to buy everything that I wanted
like<00:01:25.299> my<00:01:25.930> family<00:01:26.290> house<00:01:26.500> buy<00:01:27.040> my<00:01:27.880> parents<00:01:28.390> a

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:30.820 
car cuz I guess together they become a

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:32.400

decent<00:01:31.090> fighter<00:01:31.420> become<00:01:31.899> the<00:01:32.020> best<00:01:32.200> fighter

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:32.410
