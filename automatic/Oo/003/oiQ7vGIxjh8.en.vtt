need to set these up on your counter to
dry<00:04:24.260> I<00:04:24.650> find<00:04:25.280> that<00:04:25.430> it<00:04:25.550> takes<00:04:25.730> about<00:04:25.850> 36<00:04:26.540> to<00:04:26.660> 48

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110 
dry I find that it takes about 36 to 48

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:29.020 
dry I find that it takes about 36 to 48
hours<00:04:27.530> for<00:04:27.740> them<00:04:27.860> to<00:04:27.980> dry<00:04:28.220> completely

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.030 
hours for them to dry completely

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:32.050 
hours for them to dry completely
especially<00:04:29.840> this<00:04:30.280> it<00:04:31.280> takes<00:04:31.430> forever<00:04:31.670> to<00:04:31.970> get

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:32.060 
especially this it takes forever to get

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:33.910 
especially this it takes forever to get
all<00:04:32.270> the<00:04:32.420> water<00:04:32.630> out<00:04:32.840> and<00:04:33.200> you<00:04:33.350> do<00:04:33.470> not<00:04:33.620> want<00:04:33.860> to
