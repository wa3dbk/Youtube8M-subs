00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:39.360 
this is my least favorite part of making
pudding<00:01:37.370> you<00:01:37.760> just<00:01:38.000> have<00:01:38.210> to<00:01:38.360> be<00:01:38.480> patient<00:01:38.690> and

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:39.370 
pudding you just have to be patient and

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:42.490 
pudding you just have to be patient and
keep<00:01:40.370> stirring<00:01:40.880> until<00:01:41.270> it<00:01:41.570> comes<00:01:41.990> to<00:01:42.230> a<00:01:42.260> boil

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500 
keep stirring until it comes to a boil

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.880 
keep stirring until it comes to a boil
and<00:01:42.800> thickens<00:01:43.750> if<00:01:44.750> you<00:01:44.990> turn<00:01:45.620> the<00:01:45.710> heat<00:01:45.830> to

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
and thickens if you turn the heat to

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:46.540 
and thickens if you turn the heat to
high

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:46.550 
high

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:50.320 
high
you<00:01:46.730> will<00:01:46.910> scald<00:01:47.210> the<00:01:47.300> milk<00:01:47.330> and<00:01:48.100> if<00:01:49.100> you<00:01:49.400> turn

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:50.330 
you will scald the milk and if you turn

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.800 
you will scald the milk and if you turn
it<00:01:50.479> to<00:01:50.600> low<00:01:50.810> obviously<00:01:51.440> it<00:01:51.590> will<00:01:51.770> never<00:01:52.130> boil

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
it to low obviously it will never boil

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:59.620 
it to low obviously it will never boil
so<00:01:53.810> it's<00:01:54.170> just<00:01:54.380> a<00:01:54.470> game<00:01:54.620> of<00:01:55.000> waiting<00:01:56.000> waiting

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
you can see it's been about five minutes

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.859 
you can see it's been about five minutes
and<00:02:03.119> it<00:02:03.479> is<00:02:03.509> now<00:02:03.810> thickened<00:02:04.500> and<00:02:04.799> bubbly<00:02:05.040> and

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
once it starts bubbling and thickens you

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.800 
once it starts bubbling and thickens you
stir<00:02:09.720> it<00:02:09.750> for<00:02:10.050> two<00:02:10.649> minutes<00:02:10.950> more<00:02:11.690> you<00:02:12.690> may
