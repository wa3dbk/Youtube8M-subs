00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
scarf or buff in there it's going to

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.210 
scarf or buff in there it's going to
reduce<00:03:33.689> the<00:03:33.959> windchill<00:03:34.290> dramatically<00:03:35.040> for

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
reduce the windchill dramatically for

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:36.409 
reduce the windchill dramatically for
you<00:03:35.340> especially<00:03:35.459> if<00:03:35.729> you<00:03:35.790> are<00:03:35.879> you<00:03:36.120> know<00:03:36.239> in

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
going to get too much of a you know

00:03:56.659 --> 00:03:56.669 
that's a really nice feature it again

00:03:56.669 --> 00:03:58.490 
that's a really nice feature it again
that<00:03:56.819> works<00:03:57.060> really<00:03:57.449> well<00:03:57.840> with<00:03:58.139> the<00:03:58.319> hood

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
that works really well with the hood

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.939 
that works really well with the hood
which<00:03:58.889> I'll<00:03:59.069> demonstrate<00:03:59.430> you<00:03:59.909> win<00:04:00.180> obviously

00:04:00.939 --> 00:04:00.949 
which I'll demonstrate you win obviously

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:03.259 
which I'll demonstrate you win obviously
so<00:04:01.949> the<00:04:02.129> zip<00:04:02.280> itself<00:04:02.609> as<00:04:02.729> you<00:04:02.759> can<00:04:02.849> see<00:04:03.090> has<00:04:03.239> a

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:03.269 
so the zip itself as you can see has a

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:05.030 
so the zip itself as you can see has a
storm<00:04:03.659> flap<00:04:03.870> so<00:04:04.139> it<00:04:04.229> keeps<00:04:04.349> everything<00:04:04.680> nice

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
storm flap so it keeps everything nice

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.699 
storm flap so it keeps everything nice
and<00:04:05.340> dry<00:04:06.000> but<00:04:06.750> then<00:04:06.870> also<00:04:07.169> what<00:04:07.469> it<00:04:07.560> doesn't

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
and dry but then also what it doesn't

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:10.069 
and dry but then also what it doesn't
mean<00:04:07.949> it<00:04:08.159> means<00:04:08.400> wind<00:04:08.669> chill<00:04:08.939> as<00:04:09.120> well<00:04:09.299> to<00:04:09.569> most

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:10.079 
mean it means wind chill as well to most

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:12.210 
mean it means wind chill as well to most
importantly<00:04:10.560> to<00:04:10.709> keep<00:04:10.739> your<00:04:11.069> court

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:12.220 
importantly to keep your court

importantly to keep your court
and<00:04:12.550> if<00:04:12.700> you<00:04:12.820> think<00:04:13.060> before<00:04:13.480> just<00:04:13.660> undo<00:04:13.960> that

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:13.990 
and if you think before just undo that

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:16.740 
and if you think before just undo that
and<00:04:14.380> I'll<00:04:14.530> show<00:04:14.560> you<00:04:14.740> the<00:04:15.160> inside<00:04:15.430> edge<00:04:16.239> okati

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:16.750 
and I'll show you the inside edge okati

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:18.930 
and I'll show you the inside edge okati
it's<00:04:16.989> a<00:04:17.170> very<00:04:17.410> standard<00:04:17.769> setup<00:04:18.310> on<00:04:18.519> the<00:04:18.640> inside

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940 
it's a very standard setup on the inside

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:21.449 
it's a very standard setup on the inside
it's<00:04:19.120> just<00:04:19.209> a<00:04:19.450> mesh<00:04:19.750> lining<00:04:20.290> and<00:04:20.530> the<00:04:21.310> mesh

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:21.459 
it's just a mesh lining and the mesh

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:22.620 
it's just a mesh lining and the mesh
lining<00:04:21.700> there's<00:04:22.000> just<00:04:22.210> to<00:04:22.300> add<00:04:22.390> a<00:04:22.420> bit<00:04:22.600> of

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:22.630 
lining there's just to add a bit of

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:24.240 
lining there's just to add a bit of
comfort<00:04:22.900> so<00:04:23.260> there's<00:04:23.440> no<00:04:23.560> direct<00:04:23.770> contact

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250 
comfort so there's no direct contact

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:26.400 
comfort so there's no direct contact
with<00:04:24.550> the<00:04:24.760> actual<00:04:25.060> waterproofing<00:04:25.750> itself<00:04:26.170> and

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:26.410 
with the actual waterproofing itself and

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:28.530 
with the actual waterproofing itself and
also<00:04:27.040> what<00:04:27.400> this<00:04:27.520> means<00:04:27.760> it<00:04:27.940> enables<00:04:28.360> the

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:28.540 
also what this means it enables the

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:30.270 
also what this means it enables the
breathability<00:04:28.930> of<00:04:29.050> the<00:04:29.470> jacket<00:04:29.830> because<00:04:30.040> it's

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:30.280 
breathability of the jacket because it's

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.220 
breathability of the jacket because it's
not<00:04:30.430> directly<00:04:30.820> on<00:04:31.000> to<00:04:31.150> your<00:04:31.210> skin<00:04:31.690> it's<00:04:32.170> going

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:32.230 
not directly on to your skin it's going

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:34.260 
not directly on to your skin it's going

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:21.610 
you've got the pulleys on the side here

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:23.070 
you've got the pulleys on the side here
on<00:05:21.760> your<00:05:22.090> inside<00:05:22.510> part

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:23.080 
on your inside part

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:26.040 
on your inside part
let<00:05:23.260> me<00:05:23.380> grab<00:05:23.710> them<00:05:24.150> then<00:05:25.150> the<00:05:25.330> internal<00:05:25.660> part

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:26.050 
let me grab them then the internal part

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:28.290 
let me grab them then the internal part
yep<00:05:26.500> just<00:05:26.710> over<00:05:26.980> there<00:05:27.130> and<00:05:27.340> pull<00:05:27.880> those<00:05:28.060> in

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:28.300 
yep just over there and pull those in

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.150 
yep just over there and pull those in
and<00:05:28.510> then<00:05:28.780> that<00:05:28.900> basically<00:05:29.380> takes<00:05:29.650> shape<00:05:29.980> of

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:30.160 
and then that basically takes shape of

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.280 
and then that basically takes shape of
the<00:05:30.430> hood<00:05:30.580> itself<00:05:30.880> now<00:05:31.150> as<00:05:31.330> you<00:05:31.750> will<00:05:31.900> notice

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:32.290 
the hood itself now as you will notice

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:33.600 
the hood itself now as you will notice
the<00:05:32.470> hood<00:05:32.680> is<00:05:32.860> piqued

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:33.610 
the hood is piqued

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:35.460 
the hood is piqued
so<00:05:34.000> what<00:05:34.180> that<00:05:34.300> means<00:05:34.510> is<00:05:34.690> even<00:05:34.870> if<00:05:35.350> it's

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:35.470 
so what that means is even if it's

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:37.409 
so what that means is even if it's
absolutely<00:05:36.160> chucking<00:05:36.640> down<00:05:36.790> the<00:05:36.910> frame<00:05:37.150> the

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:37.419 
absolutely chucking down the frame the

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:39.810 
absolutely chucking down the frame the
coating<00:05:37.780> won't<00:05:38.169> basically<00:05:38.740> go<00:05:38.950> into<00:05:39.400> your

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:39.820 
coating won't basically go into your

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:41.670 
coating won't basically go into your
face<00:05:40.030> it's<00:05:40.480> always<00:05:40.840> going<00:05:40.990> to<00:05:41.050> give<00:05:41.140> you<00:05:41.530> a

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:41.680 
face it's always going to give you a

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:43.650 
face it's always going to give you a
peripheral<00:05:42.640> vision<00:05:42.940> so<00:05:43.060> you<00:05:43.090> see<00:05:43.390> where<00:05:43.570> you

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:43.660 
peripheral vision so you see where you

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:45.510 
peripheral vision so you see where you
are<00:05:43.690> where<00:05:44.440> you<00:05:44.530> need<00:05:44.560> to<00:05:44.890> go<00:05:45.040> and<00:05:45.310> where

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:45.520 
are where you need to go and where

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.040 
are where you need to go and where
you've<00:05:45.669> got<00:05:45.940> to<00:05:46.090> go<00:05:46.120> further<00:05:46.510> on<00:05:46.690> down<00:05:46.810> the

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:47.050 
you've got to go further on down the

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:48.990 
you've got to go further on down the
line<00:05:47.320> giving<00:05:47.950> you<00:05:48.070> that<00:05:48.250> view<00:05:48.460> and<00:05:48.669> as<00:05:48.760> I<00:05:48.850> say
