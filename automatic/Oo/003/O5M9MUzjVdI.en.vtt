you're<00:01:44.320> not<00:01:44.530> gonna<00:01:44.619> have<00:01:44.770> a<00:01:44.829> chance<00:01:45.070> of<00:01:45.189> it

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280 
you're not gonna have a chance of it

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:46.740 
you're not gonna have a chance of it
falling<00:01:45.310> out<00:01:45.700> right<00:01:45.909> now<00:01:46.030> it's<00:01:46.150> very<00:01:46.210> secure

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750 
falling out right now it's very secure

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:48.840 
falling out right now it's very secure
but<00:01:47.530> over<00:01:47.770> time<00:01:47.979> after<00:01:48.159> using<00:01:48.520> that<00:01:48.670> it's

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
but over time after using that it's

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.660 
but over time after using that it's
going<00:01:48.939> to<00:01:49.000> get<00:01:49.119> less<00:01:49.810> and<00:01:49.840> less<00:01:49.990> secure<00:01:50.670> so

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
going to get less and less secure so

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.210

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.910 
have for them or the fifth I think a

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:26.700 
have for them or the fifth I think a
great<00:03:25.480> stuff<00:03:25.720> now<00:03:25.750> Hedgehog<00:03:26.200> other<00:03:26.380> works<00:03:26.560> is

on the pricey side it's not for

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:30.449 
on the pricey side it's not for
everybody<00:03:29.200> but<00:03:29.440> I<00:03:29.620> think<00:03:29.680> once<00:03:30.100> you<00:03:30.190> get<00:03:30.340> one

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
everybody but I think once you get one

everybody but I think once you get one
of<00:03:30.550> these<00:03:30.640> in<00:03:30.790> your<00:03:30.850> hand<00:03:31.120> you<00:03:31.630> can't<00:03:31.900> you
