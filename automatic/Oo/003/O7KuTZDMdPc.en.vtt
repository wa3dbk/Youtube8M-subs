00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:34.560 
search and destroy we have seated about
in<00:03:30.610> the<00:03:30.700> middle<00:03:30.850> so<00:03:31.620> that's<00:03:32.620> pretty<00:03:32.830> good<00:03:33.570> yeah

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:34.570 
in the middle so that's pretty good yeah

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:37.710 
in the middle so that's pretty good yeah
if<00:03:35.140> we<00:03:35.440> do<00:03:36.190> well<00:03:36.370> against<00:03:36.700> elite<00:03:36.910> be<00:03:37.060> 0<00:03:37.090> g<00:03:37.420> which
