00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
under and it wasn't what I thought it

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.590 
under and it wasn't what I thought it
would<00:01:13.860> be<00:01:14.070> because<00:01:14.610> Millie<00:01:15.119> honest<00:01:15.420> was

obviously<00:01:16.229> holding<00:01:16.619> back<00:01:16.860> I<00:01:16.979> mean<00:01:17.130> even<00:01:17.460> when

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
obviously holding back I mean even when

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.390 
obviously holding back I mean even when
to<00:01:18.450> get<00:01:18.570> thunder<00:01:18.930> got<00:01:19.110> a<00:01:19.229> legit<00:01:19.650> hit<00:01:20.130> off<00:01:20.369> of

to get thunder got a legit hit off of

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.520 
to get thunder got a legit hit off of
him<00:01:20.700> and<00:01:20.729> drew<00:01:21.119> blood<00:01:21.360> and<00:01:21.630> everything<00:01:22.020> he

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
him and drew blood and everything he

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.469 
him and drew blood and everything he
laid<00:01:22.710> on<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:22.950> ground<00:01:23.189> and<00:01:23.490> acted<00:01:23.850> like<00:01:24.030> you

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
laid on the ground and acted like you

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.300 
laid on the ground and acted like you
know<00:01:24.540> he<00:01:24.689> was<00:01:24.840> hurt<00:01:25.020> and<00:01:25.200> just<00:01:25.439> hopped<00:01:25.860> up<00:01:26.070> and

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.280 
know he was hurt and just hopped up and
