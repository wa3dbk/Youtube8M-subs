00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:57.920 
with people that have the season ticket
I'm<00:00:56.610> not<00:00:57.120> sure<00:00:57.329> what<00:00:57.480> it<00:00:57.570> is<00:00:57.629> for<00:00:57.840> people

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
I'm not sure what it is for people

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.180 
I'm not sure what it is for people
without<00:00:58.109> the<00:00:58.379> season<00:00:58.649> ticket<00:00:58.770> but<00:00:59.070> it's

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
without the season ticket but it's

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.500 
without the season ticket but it's
probably<00:00:59.430> somewhere<00:00:59.670> around<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.940> six<00:01:00.180> seven

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
probably somewhere around the six seven

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.930 
probably somewhere around the six seven
dollar<00:01:00.660> range<00:01:01.190> as<00:01:02.190> you<00:01:02.489> see<00:01:02.609> there<00:01:02.760> it<00:01:02.820> does

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
dollar range as you see there it does

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.490 
dollar range as you see there it does
say<00:01:03.090> two<00:01:03.329> legendary<00:01:03.629> players<00:01:03.870> six<00:01:04.199> gold<00:01:04.379> or

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
say two legendary players six gold or

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.140 
say two legendary players six gold or
better<00:01:04.650> and<00:01:04.890> one<00:01:05.100> legendary<00:01:05.489> collectible<00:01:06.030> in

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
better and one legendary collectible in

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.780 
better and one legendary collectible in
every<00:01:06.450> pack<00:01:06.750> so<00:01:07.530> I'm<00:01:08.159> assuming<00:01:08.460> that<00:01:08.640> you

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
every pack so I'm assuming that you

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.100 
every pack so I'm assuming that you
could<00:01:08.850> probably<00:01:09.000> get<00:01:09.210> rookie<00:01:09.600> legends<00:01:09.960> so

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
could probably get rookie legends so

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.960 
could probably get rookie legends so
it's<00:01:10.229> not<00:01:10.350> going<00:01:10.530> to<00:01:10.590> be<00:01:10.680> that<00:01:10.860> great<00:01:11.100> you're

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
it's not going to be that great you're

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.490 
it's not going to be that great you're
most<00:01:12.180> likely<00:01:12.390> gonna<00:01:12.570> get<00:01:12.750> to<00:01:12.900> Ricky<00:01:13.140> legends

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
most likely gonna get to Ricky legends

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.800 
most likely gonna get to Ricky legends
every<00:01:13.710> pack<00:01:13.950> but<00:01:14.760> there<00:01:15.270> is<00:01:15.360> a<00:01:15.390> chance<00:01:15.689> that

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
every pack but there is a chance that

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.020 
every pack but there is a chance that
you<00:01:15.869> can<00:01:15.960> get<00:01:16.140> a<00:01:16.320> normal<00:01:16.770> legendary<00:01:17.369> player<00:01:17.670> so

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
you can get a normal legendary player so

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.609 
you can get a normal legendary player so
here<00:01:18.540> goes<00:01:18.659> a<00:01:18.750> solo<00:01:19.049> challenge

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.839

on<00:02:06.570> what<00:02:06.869> coins<00:02:07.170> what<00:02:08.009> coin<00:02:08.190> cards<00:02:08.550> are<00:02:08.640> in<00:02:08.759> the

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
on what coins what coin cards are in the

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.850 
on what coins what coin cards are in the
packs<00:02:09.060> but<00:02:09.720> I'm<00:02:09.869> assuming<00:02:10.289> that<00:02:10.319> it<00:02:10.530> goes<00:02:10.679> in

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
packs but I'm assuming that it goes in

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.350 
packs but I'm assuming that it goes in
increments<00:02:11.069> of<00:02:11.459> whatever<00:02:11.730> they<00:02:11.970> want<00:02:12.150> to<00:02:12.209> do

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
increments of whatever they want to do

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.410 
increments of whatever they want to do
they<00:02:13.140> could

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
they could

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.750 
they could
even<00:02:13.569> do<00:02:13.690> it<00:02:13.840> in<00:02:14.020> increments<00:02:14.319> of<00:02:14.709> like<00:02:14.920> 500<00:02:15.520> 600

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
even do it in increments of like 500 600

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.520 
even do it in increments of like 500 600
700<00:02:16.360> 800<00:02:16.510> but<00:02:16.780> I<00:02:16.840> don't<00:02:16.990> think<00:02:17.110> they<00:02:17.260> would<00:02:17.410> do

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
700 800 but I don't think they would do

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.850 
700 800 but I don't think they would do
that<00:02:17.849> it's<00:02:18.849> probably<00:02:19.090> ascending<00:02:19.959> pretty<00:02:20.620> far

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
that it's probably ascending pretty far

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.990 
that it's probably ascending pretty far
up<00:02:21.330> for<00:02:22.330> each<00:02:22.480> tier<00:02:23.200> of<00:02:23.410> card<00:02:23.739> you<00:02:23.800> get<00:02:24.040> and

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
up for each tier of card you get and

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.900 
up for each tier of card you get and
then<00:02:25.900> most<00:02:26.140> likely<00:02:26.370> unfortunately<00:02:27.370> the<00:02:27.730> most

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
then most likely unfortunately the most

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:29.520 
then most likely unfortunately the most
common<00:02:28.300> is<00:02:28.420> probably<00:02:28.660> gonna<00:02:28.780> be<00:02:28.959> the<00:02:29.050> 500

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
common is probably gonna be the 500

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.110 
common is probably gonna be the 500
coins<00:02:29.680> or<00:02:30.250> maybe<00:02:30.430> they<00:02:30.580> only<00:02:30.610> make<00:02:30.940> it<00:02:30.970> a

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
coins or maybe they only make it a

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.699 
coins or maybe they only make it a
thousand<00:02:31.540> to<00:02:31.630> give<00:02:31.750> you<00:02:31.870> something<00:02:32.290> for<00:02:32.440> doing

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
thousand to give you something for doing

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:35.100 
thousand to give you something for doing
it<00:02:32.830> it's<00:02:33.520> only<00:02:33.640> three<00:02:33.880> minutes<00:02:34.030> and<00:02:34.420> I'm
