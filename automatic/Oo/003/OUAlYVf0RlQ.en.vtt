by<00:01:04.940> the<00:01:05.360> seller<00:01:05.810> without<00:01:06.170> missing<00:01:06.500> one

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.680 
by the seller without missing one

percent<00:01:07.040> can<00:01:07.250> sometimes<00:01:07.700> be<00:01:07.940> a<00:01:07.970> pain<00:01:08.270> in<00:01:08.479> the

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 
percent can sometimes be a pain in the

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:14.670 
percent can sometimes be a pain in the
fucking<00:01:08.930> ass<00:01:09.200> yeah<00:01:10.160> that's<00:01:10.610> why<00:01:10.729> I<00:01:11.060> said<00:01:11.240> yes

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:14.680 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.950 

so<00:01:15.680> what<00:01:15.860> can<00:01:15.979> cause<00:01:16.220> this<00:01:16.580> but<00:01:16.850> not<00:01:17.060> of<00:01:17.240> a<00:01:17.330> 1%

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
so what can cause this but not of a 1%

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.780 
so what can cause this but not of a 1%
well<00:01:18.380> maybe<00:01:18.560> your<00:01:18.770> package<00:01:19.160> took<00:01:19.400> forever<00:01:19.670> to

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:19.790 
well maybe your package took forever to

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:21.790 
well maybe your package took forever to
arrive<00:01:20.180> or<00:01:20.510> maybe<00:01:20.720> the<00:01:20.869> packaging<00:01:21.320> news<00:01:21.530> was

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:21.800 
arrive or maybe the packaging news was

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.680 
arrive or maybe the packaging news was
just<00:01:22.040> asking<00:01:22.460> it<00:01:22.550> to<00:01:22.580> be<00:01:22.640> broken<00:01:22.970> resulting<00:01:23.630> in

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:23.690 
just asking it to be broken resulting in

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:24.370 
just asking it to be broken resulting in
damaged<00:01:24.050> goods

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
damaged goods

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.139 
damaged goods
well<00:01:24.770> maybe<00:01:24.950> the<00:01:25.160> seller<00:01:25.399> just<00:01:25.490> stole<00:01:25.970> your

00:01:26.139 --> 00:01:26.149 
well maybe the seller just stole your

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:27.999 
well maybe the seller just stole your
money<00:01:26.330> and<00:01:26.630> never<00:01:26.869> sent<00:01:27.170> the<00:01:27.290> item<00:01:27.619> out<00:01:27.770> and

00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:28.009 
money and never sent the item out and

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:29.230 
money and never sent the item out and
all<00:01:28.130> three<00:01:28.340> have<00:01:28.490> happened<00:01:28.820> to<00:01:28.910> me<00:01:29.000> in<00:01:29.149> the

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
all three have happened to me in the

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.180 
all three have happened to me in the
past<00:01:29.479> and<00:01:29.869> I'm<00:01:30.020> guessing<00:01:30.350> they<00:01:30.470> have<00:01:30.680> to<00:01:31.100> you

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:31.190 
past and I'm guessing they have to you

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.540 
past and I'm guessing they have to you
too

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:31.550

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:41.869 
although the game was released in 2005

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:44.290 
although the game was released in 2005
my<00:01:42.410> fault<00:01:42.740> back<00:01:43.009> was<00:01:43.340> amazing<00:01:43.940> most<00:01:44.090> of<00:01:44.240> the

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:44.300 
my fault back was amazing most of the

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:45.969 
my fault back was amazing most of the
time<00:01:44.479> the<00:01:44.630> game<00:01:44.810> itself<00:01:45.140> for<00:01:45.320> over<00:01:45.500> ten<00:01:45.740> pounds

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:45.979 
time the game itself for over ten pounds

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:47.830 
time the game itself for over ten pounds
and<00:01:46.399> other<00:01:46.820> websites<00:01:47.090> for<00:01:47.509> selling<00:01:47.750> it

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
and other websites for selling it

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.050 
and other websites for selling it
brand-new<00:01:48.200> and<00:01:48.440> sealed<00:01:48.710> for<00:01:48.950> more<00:01:49.430> than<00:01:49.640> 20

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
brand-new and sealed for more than 20

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.719 
brand-new and sealed for more than 20
pounds<00:01:50.479> so<00:01:50.960> really<00:01:51.320> who<00:01:51.800> wouldn't<00:01:52.220> go<00:01:52.369> for<00:01:52.610> it

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:52.729 
pounds so really who wouldn't go for it

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:54.460 
pounds so really who wouldn't go for it
so<00:01:52.909> the<00:01:53.000> game<00:01:53.150> turns<00:01:53.479> up<00:01:53.659> a<00:01:53.810> few<00:01:53.990> days<00:01:54.170> later

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:54.470 
so the game turns up a few days later

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:55.899 
so the game turns up a few days later
and<00:01:54.680> I<00:01:54.770> thought<00:01:55.010> that<00:01:55.250> was<00:01:55.369> pretty<00:01:55.640> quick

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:55.909 
and I thought that was pretty quick
