00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
the weather conditions out there were

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:30.200 
the weather conditions out there were
very<00:00:29.580> good<00:00:29.789> today

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
very good today

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.510 
very good today
very<00:00:30.539> good<00:00:30.720> for<00:00:30.869> sailing<00:00:31.199> sunny<00:00:31.859> and<00:00:32.219> windy

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
very good for sailing sunny and windy

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.810 
very good for sailing sunny and windy
and<00:00:32.790> we<00:00:33.719> had<00:00:33.870> big<00:00:34.230> waves<00:00:34.559> from<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:34.920> south<00:00:35.219> so

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
and we had big waves from the south so

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:57.750 
and we had big waves from the south so
it<00:00:35.850> was<00:00:36.090> perfect

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:57.760 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.610 

the<00:00:58.760> weather<00:00:59.150> was<00:00:59.360> perfect<00:00:59.690> for<00:01:00.110> me<00:01:00.290> we<00:01:00.500> have

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620 
the weather was perfect for me we have

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.980 
the weather was perfect for me we have
been<00:01:00.800> laughing<00:01:01.160> six<00:01:01.730> meters<00:01:02.090> per<00:01:02.390> second<00:01:02.810> in

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:02.990 
been laughing six meters per second in

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:05.500 
been laughing six meters per second in
the<00:01:03.339> beginning<00:01:04.339> and<00:01:04.519> Williams<00:01:04.879> I<00:01:05.089> think<00:01:05.330> nine

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:05.510 
the beginning and Williams I think nine

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.680 
the beginning and Williams I think nine
meters<00:01:05.960> per<00:01:06.140> seconds<00:01:06.470> so<00:01:07.130> it<00:01:07.820> was<00:01:07.940> really<00:01:08.360> nice

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:08.690 
meters per seconds so it was really nice

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:12.910 
meters per seconds so it was really nice
and<00:01:08.960> the<00:01:09.440> way<00:01:09.470> it<00:01:09.650> was<00:01:09.950> a<00:01:09.980> pretty<00:01:11.410> kind<00:01:12.410> of<00:01:12.560> fun

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:12.920 
and the way it was a pretty kind of fun

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.180 
and the way it was a pretty kind of fun
because<00:01:13.430> the<00:01:14.090> tight<00:01:14.450> get<00:01:15.020> in<00:01:15.140> and<00:01:15.380> ever<00:01:15.979> get

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:16.190 
because the tight get in and ever get

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:18.490 
because the tight get in and ever get
Flatman<00:01:16.640> broken<00:01:17.600> in<00:01:17.720> the<00:01:17.840> chop<00:01:18.080> so<00:01:18.260> it<00:01:18.380> was

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
Flatman broken in the chop so it was

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.580 
Flatman broken in the chop so it was
pretty<00:01:18.619> hard<00:01:18.740> to<00:01:18.950> pass<00:01:19.250> the<00:01:19.280> waves<00:01:19.820> I'm<00:01:20.630> heavy

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
pretty hard to pass the waves I'm heavy

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:23.800 
pretty hard to pass the waves I'm heavy
so<00:01:21.830> I'm<00:01:22.010> I'm<00:01:22.340> log<00:01:22.580> about<00:01:22.729> this<00:01:23.090> waves<00:01:23.330> for<00:01:23.690> me

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
so I'm I'm log about this waves for me

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:25.900 
so I'm I'm log about this waves for me
today<00:01:24.140> when<00:01:24.890> I<00:01:24.920> think<00:01:25.190> they<00:01:25.280> wish<00:01:25.460> you<00:01:25.580> small

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:25.910 
today when I think they wish you small

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:28.710 
today when I think they wish you small
not<00:01:26.119> so<00:01:26.240> heavy<00:01:26.450> you<00:01:27.200> can<00:01:27.560> get<00:01:27.710> pretty<00:01:27.950> hard<00:01:28.220> to

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:28.720 
not so heavy you can get pretty hard to

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:58.999 
not so heavy you can get pretty hard to
passed<00:01:29.720> away

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.859 

it's<00:02:00.009> it's<00:02:00.700> a<00:02:00.820> very<00:02:01.030> technical<00:02:01.240> barrier<00:02:01.750> to

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:01.869 
it's it's a very technical barrier to

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:04.410 
it's it's a very technical barrier to
seal<00:02:02.049> it's<00:02:02.799> it's<00:02:03.460> a<00:02:03.549> lot<00:02:03.700> of<00:02:03.729> technique<00:02:04.090> both

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420 
seal it's it's a lot of technique both

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.460 
seal it's it's a lot of technique both
both<00:02:05.289> in<00:02:05.469> the<00:02:05.560> upwind<00:02:05.890> and<00:02:06.159> in<00:02:06.460> the<00:02:06.789> downwind

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
both in the upwind and in the downwind

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.520 
both in the upwind and in the downwind
so<00:02:08.470> I<00:02:08.769> think<00:02:09.340> it's<00:02:10.239> it's<00:02:10.539> a<00:02:10.720> light<00:02:10.929> boat<00:02:11.230> so<00:02:11.500> you

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
so I think it's it's a light boat so you

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.670 
so I think it's it's a light boat so you
can<00:02:11.769> you<00:02:12.580> can<00:02:12.610> maneuver<00:02:13.090> it<00:02:13.360> very<00:02:13.959> easily

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
can you can maneuver it very easily

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.670 
can you can maneuver it very easily
so<00:02:14.890> I<00:02:15.220> think<00:02:15.340> it's<00:02:15.640> a<00:02:15.700> great<00:02:15.910> boat<00:02:16.260> you<00:02:17.260> have<00:02:17.290> to

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
so I think it's a great boat you have to

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.670 
so I think it's a great boat you have to
hike<00:02:18.340> and<00:02:18.640> steer<00:02:19.150> the<00:02:19.330> boat<00:02:19.510> correctly<00:02:20.319> in<00:02:20.530> the

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
hike and steer the boat correctly in the

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.970 
hike and steer the boat correctly in the
waves<00:02:20.890> so<00:02:21.790> you<00:02:21.849> you<00:02:22.390> don't<00:02:22.660> you<00:02:23.290> don't<00:02:23.410> stomp

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
waves so you you don't you don't stomp

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.449 
waves so you you don't you don't stomp
on<00:02:24.220> the<00:02:24.519> waves<00:02:24.730> and<00:02:25.030> loose<00:02:25.239> a<00:02:25.420> lot<00:02:25.569> of<00:02:25.660> speed<00:02:26.459> so

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
on the waves and loose a lot of speed so

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:58.640 
on the waves and loose a lot of speed so
it's<00:02:28.150> very<00:02:28.330> difficult<00:02:28.599> I<00:02:28.900> think

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.760 

in<00:02:59.650> the<00:02:59.800> first<00:03:00.070> one<00:03:00.280> it<00:03:00.580> was<00:03:00.930> not<00:03:01.930> easy<00:03:02.230> but<00:03:02.560> our

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:02.770 
in the first one it was not easy but our

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:06.590 
in the first one it was not easy but our
way<00:03:03.670> long<00:03:03.910> ahead<00:03:04.240> and<00:03:04.530> in<00:03:05.530> the<00:03:05.680> second<00:03:06.040> one<00:03:06.190> I

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
way long ahead and in the second one I

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:11.220 
way long ahead and in the second one I
eat<00:03:07.600> it<00:03:07.720> with<00:03:07.950> Norway<00:03:08.950> four<00:03:09.490> to<00:03:09.820> eight<00:03:10.000> and<00:03:10.360> he

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
eat it with Norway four to eight and he

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.500 
eat it with Norway four to eight and he
is<00:03:11.350> also<00:03:11.560> a<00:03:11.710> very<00:03:11.770> good<00:03:12.130> sailor<00:03:12.340> which<00:03:13.090> I'm

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
is also a very good sailor which I'm

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.410 
is also a very good sailor which I'm
used<00:03:13.810> to<00:03:13.900> compete<00:03:14.460> against<00:03:15.460> so<00:03:15.670> that<00:03:15.880> was

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
used to compete against so that was

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.470 
used to compete against so that was
great<00:03:16.830> my<00:03:17.830> boat<00:03:18.280> speed<00:03:18.550> and<00:03:18.760> the<00:03:18.820> upwind<00:03:19.180> is

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
great my boat speed and the upwind is

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.500 
great my boat speed and the upwind is
very<00:03:19.690> very<00:03:19.900> good<00:03:20.080> when<00:03:20.500> when<00:03:20.920> we<00:03:21.070> have<00:03:21.100> wind<00:03:21.510> so

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
very very good when when we have wind so

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:25.860 
very very good when when we have wind so
both<00:03:23.500> my<00:03:23.800> my<00:03:24.250> upwind<00:03:24.700> at<00:03:24.880> my<00:03:25.000> downwind<00:03:25.450> I<00:03:25.630> want

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
both my my upwind at my downwind I want

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:28.170 
both my my upwind at my downwind I want
a<00:03:25.960> lot<00:03:26.140> of<00:03:26.230> metres<00:03:26.560> so<00:03:26.800> I<00:03:27.010> think<00:03:27.340> that's<00:03:27.970> why

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
a lot of metres so I think that's why

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:34.800 
a lot of metres so I think that's why
our<00:03:31.200> first<00:03:32.200> race<00:03:32.500> was<00:03:32.800> was<00:03:33.580> bad<00:03:33.820> to<00:03:34.030> start<00:03:34.209> I

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
our first race was was bad to start I

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.980 
our first race was was bad to start I
think<00:03:35.020> in<00:03:35.230> the<00:03:35.380> pet<00:03:36.160> in<00:03:36.720> starting<00:03:37.720> to<00:03:37.840> win

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:37.990 
think in the pet in starting to win

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:40.560 
think in the pet in starting to win
woods<00:03:38.200> and<00:03:38.440> it<00:03:38.530> was<00:03:38.620> not<00:03:38.770> the<00:03:38.890> right<00:03:39.040> and<00:03:39.880> I

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:40.570 
woods and it was not the right and I

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:42.750 
woods and it was not the right and I
need<00:03:40.780> to<00:03:40.900> fight<00:03:41.110> hard<00:03:41.350> to<00:03:41.680> get<00:03:41.890> to<00:03:42.070> the<00:03:42.190> top<00:03:42.430> and

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:42.760 
need to fight hard to get to the top and

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.900 
need to fight hard to get to the top and
in<00:03:43.090> like<00:03:43.390> six<00:03:43.750> second<00:03:44.590> race<00:03:44.740> I<00:03:44.980> was<00:03:45.160> started<00:03:45.880> on

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910 
in like six second race I was started on

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:48.930 
in like six second race I was started on
middle<00:03:46.240> and<00:03:46.450> a<00:03:46.570> good<00:03:46.750> speed<00:03:47.110> and<00:03:47.730> aimed<00:03:48.730> like

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940 
middle and a good speed and aimed like

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.240 
middle and a good speed and aimed like
