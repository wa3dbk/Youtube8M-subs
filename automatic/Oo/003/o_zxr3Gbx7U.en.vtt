00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.780
 royal ties how to make a skewer yes I know it may sound 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:13.299
 easy but of the Swiss team anyway 

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:16.970
 but an assistance to women rochette I leave my product flat on my 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:19.859
 board I prefer to use a skewer to use 2 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.550
 You will soon understand why 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.310
 so I just stitch her 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:27.319
 first at the level 

00:00:27.319 --> 00:00:30.959
 from the part closest to the head then on the home is always 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:33.640
 flat on my board 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.500
 in order to have a uniform cooking contain the 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.880
 but today I'm not going to paul is always exotic question 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.090
 pioneering on teppanyaki a powerful aseptic 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.290
 it can be a plancha la the pay not but is rather a board 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:47.390
 stainless 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.440
 so my kebab effect in those years that the pears eventually 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.540
 a hint of chilli I could have used the null of crustaceans come them 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.100
 married in this desert spice crustacean 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.540
 the salons 584 and fresh coriander also 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:03.620
 excellent lighting 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.310
 always the power of the mill 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.310
 you can notice the kebabs his well 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.840
 afpa this saddle 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.840
 sparingly salt is a flavor enhancer 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.350
 just right 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.250
 so there atÃ©pa does not write 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.390
 to all titles 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.120
 grape seed islands what I do not want to denature good 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.890
 products 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:28.850
 and I come to grab her 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.850
 fanatical pies it works pretty well with a handle obviously 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:35.700
 here 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.650
 I'm going back to Rochette 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.950
 the agreement provides for a uniform cooking on this ep netflix 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.370
 a recipe like that shrimp so I made prices tend to leave or 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:49.040
 until then trickle of water can count about 2 minutes on each side 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.770
 it must be written while remaining 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.070
 the pickups and I will go to heart must not be too expensive too cooked 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.030
 otherwise it will become too hard obviously 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.790
 to keep a soft shrimp 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.190
 and today I decided to make a little salad 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.000
 a small salad of rockets 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.680
 we will put a little bit 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.680
 large chives 

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:13.299
 a little chive chopped at the last moment 

00:02:13.999 --> 00:02:15.939
 I chose chives 

00:02:15.939 --> 00:02:18.519
 we made a little wheat right now in the garden its prey as i have everything 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:21.969
 at the time of top freshness of chervil of flat parsley 

00:02:21.969 --> 00:02:25.729
 basil obviously to basilic clouds that can be infused daisy 

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:26.369
 city 

00:02:26.369 --> 00:02:29.369
 with tunes that we made the state so far the same 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:33.079
 so once they are cooked 

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:35.219
 I was not going to roll 

00:02:35.219 --> 00:02:38.469
 I want to have fun one side 

00:02:38.469 --> 00:02:41.159
 a blue poppy woman 

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:42.219
 like these 

00:02:42.219 --> 00:02:43.799
 and the other side 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:46.969
 bern 16 

00:02:46.969 --> 00:02:50.179
 different different crunchy flavors 

00:02:50.179 --> 00:02:53.179
 I play on the side 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:56.019
 I just stung the skewer 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:59.379
 in my room at m 

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:02.959
 the signature of the very important chef you are proud to have made a dish I 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:05.959
 did not sign your dish 

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:10.299
 that's how to make a prawn kebab of wild shrimp 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:13.859
 very easily and very expensive especially to respect our products 

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:18.040
 just grabbed with lille can not grape a simple salad that's enough
