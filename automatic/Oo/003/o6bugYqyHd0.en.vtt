00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
extinction map and first of all how you

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.519 
extinction map and first of all how you
get<00:00:17.369> these<00:00:17.490> grenades<00:00:17.940> is<00:00:18.180> like<00:00:18.660> anything<00:00:19.350> else

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
get these grenades is like anything else

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:20.929 
get these grenades is like anything else
in<00:00:19.890> the<00:00:20.039> extinction<00:00:20.460> pretty<00:00:20.640> much<00:00:20.760> you<00:00:20.910> just

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
in the extinction pretty much you just

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.910 
in the extinction pretty much you just
have<00:00:21.390> to<00:00:21.539> find<00:00:21.720> the<00:00:21.960> blueprint<00:00:22.380> and<00:00:22.500> then<00:00:22.560> you

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
have to find the blueprint and then you

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.800 
have to find the blueprint and then you
have<00:00:23.070> to<00:00:23.189> find<00:00:23.369> three<00:00:23.730> buildable<00:00:24.150> box<00:00:24.390> parts

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
have to find three buildable box parts

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.830 
have to find three buildable box parts
and<00:00:25.490> in<00:00:26.490> this<00:00:26.609> map<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:27.060> beautiful<00:00:27.449> box<00:00:27.630> force

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
and in this map the beautiful box force

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.480 
and in this map the beautiful box force
are<00:00:28.050> pretty<00:00:28.439> is<00:00:28.560> defined<00:00:28.920> as<00:00:29.099> they<00:00:29.279> are

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
are pretty is defined as they are

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.510 
are pretty is defined as they are
grouped<00:00:29.849> together<00:00:30.060> in<00:00:30.539> this<00:00:30.720> like<00:00:31.529> three

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
grouped together in this like three

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.350 
grouped together in this like three
pairs<00:00:33.120> and<00:00:33.420> I<00:00:33.750> mean<00:00:34.440> pairs<00:00:34.680> of<00:00:34.800> trees<00:00:35.040> and

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:35.360 
pairs and I mean pairs of trees and

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.590 
pairs and I mean pairs of trees and
there<00:00:36.360> are<00:00:36.600> like<00:00:37.010> three<00:00:38.010> on<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.910> another<00:00:39.329> side

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
there are like three on the another side

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.209 
there are like three on the another side
of<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:39.870> spawn<00:00:40.079> and<00:00:40.379> Rhiannon<00:00:40.950> on<00:00:41.100> the

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
of the spawn and Rhiannon on the

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.280 
of the spawn and Rhiannon on the
underside<00:00:41.790> of<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:42.000> spawn<00:00:42.239> so<00:00:42.450> the<00:00:43.110> spa

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
underside of the spawn so the spa

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.590 
underside of the spawn so the spa
location<00:00:43.680> always<00:00:44.010> acts<00:00:44.219> six<00:00:44.610> when<00:00:45.329> you<00:00:45.360> go

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
location always acts six when you go

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.680 
location always acts six when you go
side<00:00:45.930> of<00:00:46.110> this<00:00:46.260> bone<00:00:46.820> little<00:00:47.820> areas<00:00:48.300> usually

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
side of this bone little areas usually

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.139 
side of this bone little areas usually
tend<00:00:49.110> to<00:00:49.200> have<00:00:49.620> like<00:00:49.980> three<00:00:50.280> in<00:00:50.340> them<00:00:50.700> and<00:00:50.850> the

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
tend to have like three in them and the

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.330 
tend to have like three in them and the
next<00:00:51.360> we'll<00:00:51.750> go<00:00:51.870> area<00:00:52.230> next<00:00:52.440> to<00:00:52.559> it<00:00:52.649> also<00:00:52.920> has

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
next we'll go area next to it also has

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.240 
next we'll go area next to it also has
mystery<00:00:53.969> in<00:00:54.090> it<00:00:54.180> so<00:00:54.420> for<00:00:54.930> example<00:00:55.140> when<00:00:56.039> you<00:00:56.129> go

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
mystery in it so for example when you go

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.220 
mystery in it so for example when you go
through<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.610> middle<00:00:56.820> door<00:00:57.020> the<00:00:58.020> first

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
through the middle door the first

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.189 
through the middle door the first
outdoor<00:00:58.469> area<00:00:59.100> I<00:00:59.309> think<00:00:59.820> has<00:01:00.090> maybe<00:01:00.570> six<00:01:00.930> boxes

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
outdoor area I think has maybe six boxes

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.470 
outdoor area I think has maybe six boxes
I'm<00:01:01.890> not<00:01:02.070> exactly<00:01:02.789> sure<00:01:02.940> on<00:01:03.090> this<00:01:03.300> because

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
I'm not exactly sure on this because

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.830 
I'm not exactly sure on this because
there<00:01:03.750> is<00:01:03.960> so<00:01:04.110> big<00:01:04.290> it<00:01:04.320> might<00:01:04.470> comes<00:01:04.890> to<00:01:05.659> but<00:01:06.659> I

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
there is so big it might comes to but I

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.530 
there is so big it might comes to but I
think<00:01:07.080> there<00:01:07.260> are<00:01:07.290> at<00:01:07.619> least<00:01:07.650> three<00:01:08.130> and<00:01:08.970> in

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
think there are at least three and in

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.630 
think there are at least three and in
the<00:01:09.630> next<00:01:09.750> area<00:01:10.170> in<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.650> garage<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:11.310> front

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
the next area in the garage the front

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.310 
the next area in the garage the front
part<00:01:12.060> of<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.240> grass<00:01:12.540> there<00:01:12.780> are<00:01:12.900> always<00:01:13.049> three

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
part of the grass there are always three

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.380 
part of the grass there are always three
ending<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.950> back<00:01:14.100> down<00:01:14.340> back<00:01:14.909> part<00:01:15.210> of<00:01:15.330> the

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
ending the back down back part of the

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.270 
ending the back down back part of the
carrots<00:01:15.720> there<00:01:15.960> are<00:01:16.080> always<00:01:16.259> three<00:01:16.590> so<00:01:17.100> this

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
carrots there are always three so this

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.649 
carrots there are always three so this
means<00:01:17.430> you<00:01:17.610> can<00:01:17.640> get<00:01:17.909> will<00:01:18.119> doubles<00:01:18.390> pretty

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
means you can get will doubles pretty

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.810 
means you can get will doubles pretty
easily<00:01:18.869> and<00:01:19.229> without<00:01:19.500> thinking<00:01:20.009> because<00:01:20.250> as

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
easily and without thinking because as

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.370 
easily and without thinking because as
you<00:01:21.000> know<00:01:21.030> will<00:01:21.390> doubles<00:01:21.630> always<00:01:21.930> take<00:01:22.110> three

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
you know will doubles always take three

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.190 
you know will doubles always take three
parts<00:01:22.680> to<00:01:22.740> make<00:01:22.860> so<00:01:23.659> this<00:01:24.659> makes<00:01:24.869> it<00:01:24.990> a<00:01:25.110> lot

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
parts to make so this makes it a lot

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.910 
parts to make so this makes it a lot
easier<00:01:25.380> this<00:01:26.369> is<00:01:27.180> true<00:01:27.780> to<00:01:28.140> some<00:01:28.259> extent<00:01:28.650> in

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
easier this is true to some extent in

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.770 
easier this is true to some extent in
the<00:01:29.189> other<00:01:29.310> maps<00:01:29.640> but<00:01:29.790> I<00:01:29.880> find<00:01:30.150> it<00:01:30.299> to<00:01:30.360> be<00:01:30.509> a

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
the other maps but I find it to be a

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.319 
the other maps but I find it to be a
little<00:01:31.049> more<00:01:31.590> young<00:01:32.280> consistent<00:01:33.000> in<00:01:33.150> the

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
little more young consistent in the

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:34.969 
little more young consistent in the
older<00:01:33.540> maps<00:01:33.750> maybe<00:01:34.290> it's<00:01:34.439> just<00:01:34.530> because<00:01:34.770> I'm

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
older maps maybe it's just because I'm

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.920 
older maps maybe it's just because I'm
being<00:01:35.159> missing<00:01:35.579> some<00:01:36.090> locations<00:01:36.570> of<00:01:36.750> the

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
being missing some locations of the

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.280 
being missing some locations of the
global<00:01:37.770> Hot<00:01:37.950> Springs<00:01:38.460> but<00:01:38.640> I<00:01:39.030> don't<00:01:39.240> know<00:01:39.329> now

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
global Hot Springs but I don't know now

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.270 
global Hot Springs but I don't know now
the<00:01:41.250> blueprint<00:01:41.700> for<00:01:42.060> this<00:01:42.240> is<00:01:42.540> found<00:01:42.930> in<00:01:43.590> the

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
the blueprint for this is found in the

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.219 
the blueprint for this is found in the
starting<00:01:44.909> area<00:01:45.180> actually<00:01:45.390> so<00:01:45.689> you<00:01:45.720> can<00:01:46.049> get

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
starting area actually so you can get

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.560 
starting area actually so you can get
this<00:01:46.380> without<00:01:46.680> opening<00:01:47.070> any<00:01:47.159> doors<00:01:47.280> and<00:01:47.700> you

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
this without opening any doors and you

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.710 
this without opening any doors and you
just<00:01:48.810> go<00:01:49.079> around<00:01:49.200> in<00:01:49.649> starting<00:01:50.100> area<00:01:50.369> and<00:01:50.720> pick

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
just go around in starting area and pick

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.240 
just go around in starting area and pick
up<00:01:51.840> three<00:01:52.110> of<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.320> buildable<00:01:52.530> parts<00:01:52.890> and<00:01:53.040> then

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
up three of the buildable parts and then
