all<00:02:22.210> themselves<00:02:23.130> but<00:02:24.130> um<00:02:24.430> I<00:02:26.220> had<00:02:27.220> a<00:02:27.250> look

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
all themselves but um I had a look

online and I don't think you can do it
through<00:02:34.810> the<00:02:34.900> -<00:02:35.080> like<00:02:35.380> the<00:02:35.620> Volkswagen<00:02:36.160> Audi

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640
