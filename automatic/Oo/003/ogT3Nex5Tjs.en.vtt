linear it is to say you can have a
collection<00:02:34.909> and<00:02:35.360> make<00:02:36.099> connections<00:02:37.209> this<00:02:38.209> way

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
collection and make connections this way

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.920 
collection and make connections this way
in<00:02:38.780> that<00:02:38.989> way<00:02:39.310> and<00:02:40.310> in<00:02:40.489> fact<00:02:40.730> a<00:02:41.030> good<00:02:41.480> book

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
in that way and in fact a good book

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.789 
in that way and in fact a good book
collection<00:02:42.530> as<00:02:43.010> you<00:02:43.489> develop<00:02:44.000> it<00:02:44.290> starts<00:02:45.290> with

00:02:45.789 --> 00:02:45.799 
collection as you develop it starts with

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:50.710 
collection as you develop it starts with
a<00:02:46.750> foundation<00:02:47.750> and<00:02:48.939> you<00:02:49.939> can<00:02:50.120> make<00:02:50.359> different

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
a foundation and you can make different

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.649 
a foundation and you can make different
connections<00:02:51.109> in<00:02:51.829> whatever<00:02:52.280> way<00:02:52.640> you<00:02:52.670> want<00:02:52.819> for

00:02:53.649 --> 00:02:53.659 
connections in whatever way you want for

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:56.319 
connections in whatever way you want for
instance<00:02:54.280> here's<00:02:55.280> Ernest<00:02:55.819> Hemingway's

this particular book could fit in and
that's<00:03:28.129> the<00:03:28.489> idea<00:03:28.879> with<00:03:29.209> book<00:03:29.419> collecting<00:03:29.900> is

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
that's the idea with book collecting is

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:34.119 
that's the idea with book collecting is
that<00:03:30.919> it's<00:03:31.099> a<00:03:31.220> creative<00:03:31.750> endeavor<00:03:32.750> and<00:03:33.709> you

00:03:34.119 --> 00:03:34.129 
that it's a creative endeavor and you

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:38.050 
that it's a creative endeavor and you
can<00:03:34.340> make<00:03:34.549> your<00:03:34.760> own<00:03:35.139> connections<00:03:37.060> generally

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
can make your own connections generally

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:41.159 
can make your own connections generally
speaking<00:03:38.419> a<00:03:38.900> collection<00:03:39.709> will<00:03:39.859> start<00:03:40.250> with

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:41.169 
speaking a collection will start with

00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:43.300 
speaking a collection will start with
foundation<00:03:42.169> things<00:03:42.379> if<00:03:42.709> you<00:03:42.859> were<00:03:43.010> going<00:03:43.220> to

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310 
foundation things if you were going to

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:46.899 
foundation things if you were going to
collect<00:03:43.579> in<00:03:43.970> the<00:03:44.090> field<00:03:44.120> of<00:03:45.909> space

00:03:46.899 --> 00:03:46.909 
collect in the field of space

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:49.599 
collect in the field of space
exploration<00:03:47.480> for<00:03:48.409> instance<00:03:48.829> you<00:03:48.980> might<00:03:49.190> start

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:49.609 
exploration for instance you might start

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:54.759 
exploration for instance you might start
with<00:03:49.810> Carl<00:03:50.810> Sagan<00:03:51.310> but<00:03:52.310> you<00:03:52.549> might<00:03:52.790> add<00:03:53.769> the

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:54.769 
with Carl Sagan but you might add the

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:57.099 
with Carl Sagan but you might add the
biographies<00:03:55.489> and<00:03:55.519> autobiographies<00:03:55.900> of<00:03:56.900> some

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
of the astronauts or cosmonauts and it'd

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.289 
of the astronauts or cosmonauts and it'd
be<00:03:59.989> especially<00:04:00.769> good<00:04:00.949> if<00:04:01.280> some<00:04:01.790> of<00:04:01.909> these<00:04:02.000> were

00:04:02.289 --> 00:04:02.299 
be especially good if some of these were

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:04.930 
be especially good if some of these were
signed<00:04:02.659> and<00:04:02.959> for<00:04:03.799> a<00:04:03.829> high<00:04:04.069> point<00:04:04.370> you<00:04:04.760> might

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:04.940 
signed and for a high point you might

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:07.839 
signed and for a high point you might
even<00:04:05.120> have<00:04:05.449> a<00:04:05.510> letter<00:04:06.019> from<00:04:06.319> Verner<00:04:06.829> von<00:04:07.250> Braun

00:04:07.839 --> 00:04:07.849 
even have a letter from Verner von Braun

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:12.580 
even have a letter from Verner von Braun
that<00:04:08.269> talks<00:04:09.169> about<00:04:10.780> rocketry<00:04:11.780> and<00:04:12.139> that<00:04:12.290> sort

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:12.590 
that talks about rocketry and that sort

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:14.979 
that talks about rocketry and that sort
of<00:04:12.650> thing<00:04:13.060> it<00:04:14.060> is<00:04:14.269> to<00:04:14.299> say<00:04:14.659> we<00:04:14.810> have<00:04:14.840> a

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:14.989 
of thing it is to say we have a

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:18.270 
of thing it is to say we have a
foundation<00:04:15.769> and<00:04:15.949> then<00:04:16.010> we<00:04:16.729> have<00:04:16.880> high<00:04:17.180> points

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 
foundation and then we have high points

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:21.569 
foundation and then we have high points
as<00:04:19.280> the<00:04:20.120> collection<00:04:20.510> develops

00:04:21.569 --> 00:04:21.579 
as the collection develops

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:25.529 
as the collection develops
a<00:04:22.169> well-developed<00:04:23.169> collection<00:04:24.300> takes<00:04:25.300> on<00:04:25.509> a

00:04:25.529 --> 00:04:25.539 
a well-developed collection takes on a

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:28.770 
a well-developed collection takes on a
sort<00:04:25.870> of<00:04:25.960> spherical<00:04:26.560> shape<00:04:27.370> to<00:04:27.759> it<00:04:27.909> so<00:04:28.569> that

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:28.780 
sort of spherical shape to it so that

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:32.909 
sort of spherical shape to it so that
you<00:04:28.900> can<00:04:29.110> take<00:04:29.949> out<00:04:30.250> and<00:04:30.669> study<00:04:31.270> an<00:04:32.259> individual

00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:32.919 
you can take out and study an individual

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:35.969 
you can take out and study an individual
part<00:04:33.219> of<00:04:33.310> the<00:04:33.430> collection<00:04:33.789> you<00:04:34.270> can<00:04:34.870> also<00:04:35.080> do

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:35.979 
part of the collection you can also do

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:38.580 
part of the collection you can also do
the<00:04:36.129> same<00:04:36.159> thing<00:04:36.669> with<00:04:37.060> let's<00:04:37.419> say<00:04:37.629> Civil<00:04:38.319> War

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:38.590 
the same thing with let's say Civil War

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:42.330 
the same thing with let's say Civil War
books<00:04:38.919> or<00:04:39.280> in<00:04:40.199> which<00:04:41.199> you<00:04:41.439> of<00:04:41.650> course<00:04:41.680> would<00:04:42.159> at

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:42.340 
books or in which you of course would at

books or in which you of course would at
the<00:04:42.490> bottom<00:04:42.849> have<00:04:43.379> Bruce<00:04:44.379> Kayden<00:04:44.919> those<00:04:45.430> sorts

00:04:45.839 --> 00:04:45.849 
the bottom have Bruce Kayden those sorts

00:04:45.849 --> 00:04:48.869 
the bottom have Bruce Kayden those sorts
of<00:04:45.939> things<00:04:46.180> you<00:04:46.930> might<00:04:47.169> have<00:04:47.490> studies<00:04:48.490> of

00:04:59.490 --> 00:04:59.500 
high points but you could take out from
