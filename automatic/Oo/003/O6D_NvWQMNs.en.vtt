00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 the diploma course solution focused 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.629
 coaching and advising moves you to it 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.420
 both with individuals and with 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.010
 teams work and their potential 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.380
 to bring the surface 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.540
 in seven modules you learn in one 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.940
 period of one year the necessary 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.859
 tools to know from 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.600
 conceptual foundations and 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.840
 theoretical knowledge of the potential 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.789
 focused approach in module 1 through 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.680
 for activation and use partly 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.410
 unconscious competence reservoirs in 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:36.000
 Module 6 sets this course above all 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:37.649
 was the applicable practice for me 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.840
 It's especially helpful that I'm from 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.610
 very consistent from the beginning on 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.090
 Brothers was asked to do the tools 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:49.020
 and methods in practice 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.760
 I then tried everything ford to the 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.789
 to bring man or woman and 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.309
 found that works and 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.170
 I succeeded in that I am very very 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.050
 very glad that you have this course 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.390
 I attended the courses in the solution 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.400
 Management Center was totally helpful 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.710
 for me because i have a lot of new tools 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:11.010
 could get to know you as she gave me 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.680
 especially helpful was actually the 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.150
 permanent practical relevance 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.950
 that is really great 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.530
 tools are the ones in practice 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:22.909
 can apply 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.909
 which are really helpful 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.190
 coach in our diploma course and 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:34.300
 we mediate the advice 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:37.030
 Participants practice practice and 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:39.610
 again practice but that before one 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:42.160
 sound academic background 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.490
 that is from the first day there is 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.960
 many many exercise options 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.630
 use the bring 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.550
 Participants make their own examples from their own 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.640
 occupational fields from her professional experience 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:58.330
 with and based on this concrete 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:00.490
 examples practiced practiced and still 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:02.830
 once practiced and then in between 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:05.290
 time and again the experience reflects 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:07.600
 and from our patients then 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:08.830
 necessary input accordingly then 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.929
 also recorded 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.980
 for that it is necessary in small 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:15.430
 to work groups 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:17.380
 that happens in the modules but also in 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.600
 small groups between each 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.010
 modules again and again exercises 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:24.340
 to offer 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:27.040
 here is especially important to us that 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:29.709
 solution lab where we have our own little one 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.930
 have built up a laboratory where ours 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:34.120
 Participants for two to three 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:37.000
 concrete advice cases work 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:39.130
 and all the processes can do it 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.370
 can record and 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:44.049
 afterwards together with a trainer 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.790
 with a lecturer or sometimes 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:48.190
 in between only together in the 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.970
 discuss group also reflect on 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.220
 can 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:53.680
 This makes it possible within one 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:56.019
 year is indeed a high level 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.390
 Achieve effectiveness so that the 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:03:01.450
 participants lead other conversations 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:03.549
 Talks lead to the real potential 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:06.190
 be able to get started with your clients 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:08.560
 and solutions with bigger ones 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.220
 probability then also allow 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.560
 can 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.660
 incidentally is an effect that the 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:16.420
 Participants also for themselves in their own 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:18.160
 her own opposition to her 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.620
 own problems in the workplace 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:23.079
 can use these techniques 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:26.290
 and according to experience, again and again 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:30.040
 also a bit more lightness and 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:31.959
 is standing for 15 years now 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.580
 this course and what is in the 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:36.400
 runners over the years more and more 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:38.319
 has proven the international 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.930
 out of direction we have 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:44.549
 meanwhile an international one 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:47.260
 trainers met this internationality 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:50.530
 allows a change of perspective 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:54.010
 again and again in the context of the course and 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:55.920
 thus a more flexible view and 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:59.170
 also a more intercultural 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:02.260
 view at work as a coach or 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:07.209
 consultant always say yes it is 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:09.250
 one of finally the first or out 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:12.370
 training as you call it 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:14.519
 is where the content is not in the shop 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:16.810
 disappear as it were according to the motto 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:18.459
 I've heard something and 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:20.049
 home is then out again and look 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:22.330
 me that now and if I then 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:24.220
 Well then I can do it but it was 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:27.330
 an absolute learning by doing so me 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:30.160
 I liked to try and liked it 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:31.630
 yes even not mentioned because of the 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.889
 strict training or something like that 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:34.889
 just fun
