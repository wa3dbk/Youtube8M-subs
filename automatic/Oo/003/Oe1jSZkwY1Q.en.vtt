00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.879
 left to right the belgians a first 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:09.800
 time in front of the gate and that only hits the 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:13.769
 post after 49 seconds, the chambers of the 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:15.660
 make post here again the error 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.600
 of important that was a hair-raising one 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.170
 error and then the possibility to 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.760
 given lightly 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:27.510
 that must be the grasshoppers with the gate 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:34.350
 long long way for the long 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:36.690
 grasshopper club strongly argued for that 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.489
 with a very strong offensive performance 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.399
 so far as he sees that sounded like happiness 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.540
 and long with the shot from dot de facto 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.129
 it was an owner if we were completely 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.100
 Want to be honest, yes, the clever pass 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.770
 made strong by david but long 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:54.210
 the gate ultimately that was one 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:56.399
 owner and it nevertheless returned 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.199
 the possibility to compensate and 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.329
 the compensation is used 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.020
 and here I think it was a 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.870
 own goal 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.850
 here again the action here too 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.939
 it's done well again playing 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.920
 the defenders are not together with the 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.479
 ball comes to the middle and then is not 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.659
 property hit meets so he offered 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:18.170
 in fact the preliminary work she came from 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.170
 Jorgensen 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:24.280
 Again, they leave the belgians a lot 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:27.300
 faster than the competition and then 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:33.250
 falls the 2 0 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:36.090
 now two to one here again 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:38.860
 Grichting lets the ball off 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:42.550
 salatic can be overrun 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:45.450
 no, that's how you can fight this luck 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:45.450
 not pass 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.040
 nabu and his 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.680
 you had to be early 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:19.400
 red nose right always was there 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:19.400
 if that's what britta there are a few 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:26.060
 from blanche , the ticket for 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:28.040
 the next four games with the gc-tor 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.430
 sure of this action with this parade 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.470
 Well 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.100
 the party is over the grassers 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.400
 to lose 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:35.900
 only two to one against whom I honestly 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.260
 be there a few high caliber with 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.260
 there
