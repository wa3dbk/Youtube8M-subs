00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:45.800 
bit different than the Dreamcast version
since<00:01:44.909> it<00:01:45.060> doesn't<00:01:45.210> have<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:45.479> special

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
since it doesn't have the special

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.380 
since it doesn't have the special
controller<00:01:46.220> but<00:01:47.220> if<00:01:47.850> this<00:01:48.000> one<00:01:48.210> actually

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
controller but if this one actually

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.240 
controller but if this one actually
turns<00:01:48.720> out<00:01:48.810> to<00:01:48.869> be<00:01:48.960> good<00:01:49.170> I'm<00:01:49.860> actually<00:01:50.040> gonna

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
turns out to be good I'm actually gonna

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.980 
turns out to be good I'm actually gonna
find<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.520> Dreamcast<00:01:50.909> version<00:01:51.000> and<00:01:51.420> get<00:01:51.840> that

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
find the Dreamcast version and get that

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.109 
find the Dreamcast version and get that
because<00:01:52.290> I<00:01:52.890> really<00:01:53.700> don't<00:01:53.820> want<00:01:53.939> to<00:01:54.000> buy<00:01:54.060> the

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
because I really don't want to buy the

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.850 
because I really don't want to buy the
Dreamcast<00:01:54.540> version<00:01:54.630> if<00:01:55.140> it's<00:01:55.320> not<00:01:55.470> that<00:01:55.649> good

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
Dreamcast version if it's not that good

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.350 
Dreamcast version if it's not that good
because<00:01:56.040> it's<00:01:56.310> fairly<00:01:56.520> expensive<00:01:56.820> and<00:01:57.090> fairly

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
because it's fairly expensive and fairly

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.999 
because it's fairly expensive and fairly
hard<00:01:57.509> to<00:01:57.630> find<00:01:57.869> so<00:01:58.229> I'm<00:01:58.320> actually<00:01:58.439> try<00:01:58.829> it<00:01:58.890> out

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
hard to find so I'm actually try it out

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.280 
hard to find so I'm actually try it out
first<00:01:59.219> on<00:01:59.430> the<00:01:59.549> wii<00:01:59.700> and<00:01:59.939> if<00:02:00.360> it's<00:02:00.509> good<00:02:00.750> i'll

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
first on the wii and if it's good i'll

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.649 
first on the wii and if it's good i'll
get<00:02:01.409> the<00:02:01.469> dreamcast<00:02:01.829> version<00:02:02.420> alright<00:02:03.420> moving

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
get the dreamcast version alright moving

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.569 
get the dreamcast version alright moving
on<00:02:03.750> to<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:03.960> ps3<00:02:04.259> and<00:02:04.680> interestingly<00:02:04.890> enough<00:02:05.340> i

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
on to the ps3 and interestingly enough i

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.570 
on to the ps3 and interestingly enough i
only<00:02:05.729> got<00:02:05.820> one<00:02:06.090> american<00:02:07.310> ps3<00:02:08.310> gaming<00:02:08.459> the

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
only got one american ps3 gaming the

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.249 
only got one american ps3 gaming the
rest<00:02:08.759> are<00:02:08.849> all<00:02:08.910> imports<00:02:09.390> from<00:02:09.479> gamestop<00:02:09.959> so

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
rest are all imports from gamestop so

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.830 
rest are all imports from gamestop so
that's<00:02:10.500> really<00:02:10.770> cool

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
that's really cool

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.600 
that's really cool
so<00:02:12.840> the<00:02:12.990> first<00:02:13.170> one<00:02:13.380> is<00:02:13.620> back<00:02:14.310> to<00:02:14.490> the<00:02:14.520> future

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
so the first one is back to the future

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.640 
so the first one is back to the future
the<00:02:15.030> game<00:02:15.240> from<00:02:15.450> Telltale<00:02:15.840> Games<00:02:15.900> of<00:02:16.410> course

the game from Telltale Games of course

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.110 
the game from Telltale Games of course
since<00:02:16.920> it<00:02:17.040> is<00:02:17.130> the<00:02:17.160> back<00:02:17.430> to<00:02:17.550> the<00:02:17.670> future<00:02:17.940> has

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
since it is the back to the future has

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.110 
since it is the back to the future has
the<00:02:18.270> classic<00:02:18.770> delorean<00:02:19.770> dmc-12<00:02:20.340> on<00:02:20.819> the<00:02:20.940> cover

think this is the spanish or italian
version<00:02:37.260> of<00:02:37.530> the<00:02:37.620> game<00:02:37.769> I<00:02:38.090> can't<00:02:39.090> read<00:02:39.330> either

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
looks a lot nicer than our red but this

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.750 
looks a lot nicer than our red but this
one's<00:03:35.850> just<00:03:35.940> the<00:03:36.209> greatest<00:03:36.480> hits<00:03:36.690> of<00:03:36.870> the

demon souls but you don't run across a

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.080 
demon souls but you don't run across a
lot<00:03:40.739> of<00:03:40.769> Chinese<00:03:41.250> games<00:03:41.489> over<00:03:41.760> in<00:03:41.820> the<00:03:41.880> states

pretty cool so finally moving on to the

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.479 
pretty cool so finally moving on to the

360 my bread and butter so let me start
off<00:03:53.700> with<00:03:53.850> a<00:03:53.910> crappiest<00:03:54.269> game<00:03:54.480> I<00:03:54.510> got<00:03:54.750> and<00:03:55.079> I

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
off with a crappiest game I got and I

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.080 
off with a crappiest game I got and I
definitely<00:03:55.440> kind<00:03:56.400> of<00:03:56.459> regret<00:03:56.760> getting<00:03:56.910> this

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
definitely kind of regret getting this

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.420 
definitely kind of regret getting this
game<00:03:57.299> I<00:03:57.739> thought<00:03:58.739> this<00:03:58.890> game<00:03:59.040> was<00:03:59.130> actually

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
game I thought this game was actually

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.150 
game I thought this game was actually
pretty<00:03:59.670> decent<00:03:59.880> it<00:04:00.180> is<00:04:00.269> a<00:04:00.299> telltale<00:04:01.230> Game<00:04:01.560> I

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
pretty decent it is a telltale Game I

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.470 
pretty decent it is a telltale Game I
thought<00:04:02.730> it<00:04:02.819> would<00:04:02.940> be<00:04:03.030> pretty<00:04:03.120> decent

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
thought it would be pretty decent

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:07.670 
thought it would be pretty decent
because<00:04:03.630> i<00:04:03.690> thought<00:04:04.579> the<00:04:06.019> the<00:04:07.019> back<00:04:07.500> to<00:04:07.590> the

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
because i thought the the back to the

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.800 
because i thought the the back to the
future<00:04:07.889> game<00:04:08.010> was<00:04:08.130> actually<00:04:08.400> fairly<00:04:08.519> good<00:04:08.819> so

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
future game was actually fairly good so

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.170 
future game was actually fairly good so
i<00:04:09.840> picked<00:04:10.380> up<00:04:10.560> Jurassic<00:04:11.100> Park<00:04:11.310> the<00:04:11.639> game<00:04:11.850> and

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
i picked up Jurassic Park the game and

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.030 
i picked up Jurassic Park the game and
I'm<00:04:12.389> a<00:04:12.450> big<00:04:12.600> fan<00:04:12.780> of<00:04:12.810> Jurassic<00:04:13.260> Park<00:04:13.470> and<00:04:13.769> I

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
I'm a big fan of Jurassic Park and I

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.470 
I'm a big fan of Jurassic Park and I
thought<00:04:14.160> this<00:04:14.280> game<00:04:14.400> was<00:04:14.519> going<00:04:14.609> to<00:04:14.730> be<00:04:14.790> at

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 
thought this game was going to be at

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:16.879 
thought this game was going to be at
least<00:04:15.540> decent<00:04:16.200> but<00:04:16.470> this<00:04:16.560> game<00:04:16.680> is<00:04:16.739> actually

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:16.889 
least decent but this game is actually

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:20.599 
least decent but this game is actually
pretty<00:04:17.190> bad<00:04:17.690> it's<00:04:18.690> unlike<00:04:19.440> the<00:04:19.709> back<00:04:20.400> to<00:04:20.519> the

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
pretty bad it's unlike the back to the

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:21.500 
pretty bad it's unlike the back to the
future<00:04:20.820> game<00:04:20.940> which<00:04:21.060> is<00:04:21.180> like<00:04:21.299> an<00:04:21.390> adventure

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
future game which is like an adventure

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:24.380 
future game which is like an adventure
game<00:04:21.750> this<00:04:22.019> one's<00:04:22.229> more<00:04:22.409> like<00:04:22.650> heavy<00:04:23.310> rain<00:04:23.580> has

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:24.390 
game this one's more like heavy rain has

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:25.420 
game this one's more like heavy rain has
a<00:04:24.419> lot<00:04:24.659> of<00:04:24.690> a

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:25.430 
a lot of a

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:27.100 
a lot of a
what<00:04:25.520> time<00:04:25.699> events<00:04:26.060> and<00:04:26.090> it's<00:04:26.930> very

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110 
what time events and it's very

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:29.350 
what time events and it's very
unforgiving<00:04:27.530> if<00:04:28.310> you<00:04:28.430> make<00:04:28.550> one<00:04:28.580> slight

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.360 
unforgiving if you make one slight

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.300 
unforgiving if you make one slight
mistake<00:04:29.630> if<00:04:29.930> you<00:04:30.020> like<00:04:30.740> a<00:04:30.770> fraction<00:04:31.190> of<00:04:31.250> a

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:31.310 
mistake if you like a fraction of a

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:35.050 
mistake if you like a fraction of a
second<00:04:31.639> off<00:04:31.759> you<00:04:32.630> die<00:04:32.840> and<00:04:33.729> you<00:04:34.729> have<00:04:34.820> to<00:04:34.910> start

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.060 
second off you die and you have to start

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:36.670 
second off you die and you have to start
off<00:04:35.210> in<00:04:35.330> the<00:04:35.419> beginning<00:04:35.509> and<00:04:35.900> it's<00:04:36.259> like<00:04:36.410> a<00:04:36.440> big

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:36.680 
off in the beginning and it's like a big

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.490 
off in the beginning and it's like a big
 and<00:04:37.759> interestingly<00:04:38.110> the<00:04:39.110> disc<00:04:39.380> version

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:39.500 
 and interestingly the disc version

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:42.189 
 and interestingly the disc version
is<00:04:39.889> actually<00:04:40.340> really<00:04:40.639> laggy<00:04:41.449> but<00:04:41.840> if<00:04:42.110> you

00:04:42.189 --> 00:04:42.199 
is actually really laggy but if you

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:44.680 
is actually really laggy but if you
download<00:04:42.650> the<00:04:43.009> the<00:04:43.250> xbox<00:04:44.060> live<00:04:44.300> download

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:44.690 
download the the xbox live download

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:47.050 
download the the xbox live download
version<00:04:45.530> it<00:04:46.100> actually<00:04:46.400> runs<00:04:46.580> really<00:04:46.729> smooth

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:47.060 
version it actually runs really smooth

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:48.249 
version it actually runs really smooth
which<00:04:47.240> I<00:04:47.330> think<00:04:47.539> find<00:04:47.720> kind<00:04:48.080> of<00:04:48.169> bizarre

00:04:48.249 --> 00:04:48.259 
which I think find kind of bizarre

00:04:48.259 --> 00:04:49.990 
which I think find kind of bizarre
because<00:04:48.560> I<00:04:48.710> would<00:04:48.860> think<00:04:49.039> the<00:04:49.280> treat<00:04:49.639> the<00:04:49.789> disc

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:50.000 
because I would think the treat the disc

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.340 
because I would think the treat the disc
version<00:04:50.090> would<00:04:50.449> run<00:04:50.660> a<00:04:50.690> lot<00:04:50.870> smoother<00:04:51.229> than

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:51.350 
version would run a lot smoother than

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:55.390 
version would run a lot smoother than
the<00:04:52.280> dlc<00:04:52.729> version<00:04:53.120> but<00:04:53.240> um<00:04:53.500> this<00:04:54.500> games<00:04:54.770> I'd

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:55.400 
the dlc version but um this games I'd

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.790 
the dlc version but um this games I'd
say<00:04:56.180> get<00:04:56.690> it<00:04:56.810> at<00:04:56.930> your<00:04:57.050> own<00:04:57.080> risk<00:04:57.199> unless

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:57.800 
say get it at your own risk unless

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.279 
say get it at your own risk unless
you're<00:04:57.949> a<00:04:58.009> huge<00:04:58.580> Jurassic<00:04:58.970> Park<00:04:59.180> fan<00:04:59.449> I<00:04:59.810> kind

you're a huge Jurassic Park fan I kind

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:03.580 
you're a huge Jurassic Park fan I kind
of<00:05:00.380> avoid<00:05:00.650> it<00:05:01.509> at<00:05:02.509> least<00:05:02.690> if<00:05:02.900> I<00:05:03.289> were<00:05:03.440> to<00:05:03.530> say

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:03.590 
of avoid it at least if I were to say

00:06:03.189 --> 00:06:03.199 
the dlc characters that come out up

00:06:03.199 --> 00:06:05.710 
the dlc characters that come out up
until<00:06:03.470> now<00:06:03.530> and<00:06:04.210> this<00:06:05.210> one<00:06:05.360> actually<00:06:05.419> has<00:06:05.599> a

until now and this one actually has a
reversible<00:06:06.199> cover<00:06:06.620> and<00:06:07.009> I<00:06:07.070> thought<00:06:07.250> the

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:07.460 
reversible cover and I thought the

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:10.060 
reversible cover and I thought the
reverse<00:06:07.759> side<00:06:08.240> looked<00:06:08.570> a<00:06:08.630> lot<00:06:08.750> better<00:06:08.930> so<00:06:09.650> as

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:10.070 
reverse side looked a lot better so as

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:12.870 
reverse side looked a lot better so as
you<00:06:10.310> see<00:06:10.460> there's<00:06:10.610> no<00:06:10.759> rating<00:06:11.270> on<00:06:11.389> it<00:06:11.509> but<00:06:11.690> um<00:06:11.870> I

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:12.880 
you see there's no rating on it but um I

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:14.800 
you see there's no rating on it but um I
thought<00:06:13.880> I<00:06:13.909> might<00:06:14.060> give<00:06:14.330> this<00:06:14.419> game<00:06:14.570> another

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:14.810 
thought I might give this game another

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:19.420 
thought I might give this game another
try<00:06:15.110> but<00:06:16.039> um<00:06:16.659> yeah<00:06:17.659> its<00:06:17.810> supposedly<00:06:18.050> a<00:06:18.430> decent

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:19.430 
try but um yeah its supposedly a decent

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:24.430 
try but um yeah its supposedly a decent
game<00:06:19.759> so<00:06:20.979> i'll<00:06:21.979> try<00:06:22.159> that<00:06:22.190> next<00:06:23.150> is<00:06:23.479> the<00:06:23.930> the

speed the run limited edition and again

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:55.680 
speed the run limited edition and again
is<00:06:53.830> it<00:06:54.100> really<00:06:54.340> necessary<00:06:54.370> to<00:06:54.910> make<00:06:55.060> it<00:06:55.090> in<00:06:55.330> two

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:55.690 
is it really necessary to make it in two

different<00:06:55.720> languages<00:06:56.470> even<00:06:57.160> on<00:06:57.370> the<00:06:57.490> spine<00:06:57.789> I

00:06:58.760 --> 00:06:58.770 
different languages even on the spine I

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:02.010 
different languages even on the spine I
really<00:06:59.770> it<00:07:00.130> really<00:07:00.460> grinds<00:07:01.240> me<00:07:01.479> in<00:07:01.539> a<00:07:01.600> way<00:07:01.720> it

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:02.020 
really it really grinds me in a way it

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:02.969 
really it really grinds me in a way it
you<00:07:02.259> know<00:07:02.350> even<00:07:02.560> though<00:07:02.620> it's<00:07:02.740> something

00:07:02.969 --> 00:07:02.979 
you know even though it's something

00:07:02.979 --> 00:07:05.969 
you know even though it's something
small<00:07:03.100> it<00:07:03.340> just<00:07:03.490> really<00:07:03.699> bugs<00:07:03.880> me<00:07:04.050> but<00:07:05.050> slowly

00:07:05.969 --> 00:07:05.979 
small it just really bugs me but slowly

00:07:05.979 --> 00:07:07.320 
small it just really bugs me but slowly
this<00:07:06.100> games<00:07:06.310> pretty<00:07:06.400> good<00:07:06.699> actually<00:07:06.910> uses<00:07:07.300> the

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:07.330 
this games pretty good actually uses the

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:09.870 
this games pretty good actually uses the
engine<00:07:07.720> from<00:07:07.840> battlefield<00:07:08.740> 3<00:07:09.070> was<00:07:09.729> it

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:09.880 
engine from battlefield 3 was it

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:11.879 
engine from battlefield 3 was it
frostbite<00:07:10.300> 2<00:07:10.509> I<00:07:10.720> don't<00:07:11.410> know<00:07:11.470> what<00:07:11.620> they<00:07:11.680> would

00:07:11.879 --> 00:07:11.889 
frostbite 2 I don't know what they would
