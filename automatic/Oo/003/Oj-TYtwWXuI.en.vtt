00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:07.250
 Servus people welcome to the fitness tv 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:09.170
 my name is raffael and how are you 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:10.639
 back to the export in kassel ins 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:13.519
 Gym and today I show you 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:17.090
 Yes, the power sport, exercise par excellence, the 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:18.739
 the kingdom discipline is the bench press and will 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:20.840
 actually in each breast workout with 

00:00:18.739 --> 00:00:22.220
 just kind of the bank press everything 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.869
 you need a barbell 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:27.380
 and such a nice training bench here 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:29.090
 and the bench press is a good one 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.470
 exercise for the bus muscle training the 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:32.680
 But poor people will also be involved a bit 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:36.020
 me accordingly the tourism stand 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:37.850
 and so on we grab a barbell 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.560
 the more that is merely addressed 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.870
 and we're watching over the exercise here 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:43.580
 until twelve repetitions and not 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.500
 Packed in three sentences and between the two 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:47.329
 we make 30 to 60 seconds 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.650
 break and a little bit more 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:50.329
 build constructions 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:51.890
 therefore, the exercise is very good 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:55.270
 but enough for the chest muscle training 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.270
 stored here we go with the exercise 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:02.170
 we're packing pretty wide wanting that 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:08.200
 Exercise your chest and get the barbell out 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:10.190
 and start with the movement sequence 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.590
 It is important in bank press that we 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:16.940
 go down deep with the barbell and 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:20.930
 the dumbbell on the chest almost 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:23.479
 So do not put off but in 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:26.180
 the direction of the breastbone moves 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:28.720
 barbell we do nice and slow 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.860
 and controlled 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.150
 the weight we will be back so that it 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.590
 our performance level is therefore the same 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:34.940
 but really these eight to twelve 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:39.610
 repeat create twelve 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:39.610
 repetitions maximum 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:52.189
 so easy because it is so beautiful and 

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:54.380
 re-hook the barbell and 

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:55.840
 I can do some super benching 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.770
 recommend me a lot of fun and 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.929
 It is important in bank press that you 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.399
 Do not overestimate yourself here because there is 

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:02.750
 many people take too much 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:04.729
 weight make a few repetitions 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.229
 and her body is not necessarily 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:07.970
 good and the training effect is too 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:10.340
 not necessarily if quite big of 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.360
 therefore thinks of you that chooses the ins 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.560
 weight so he really only 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.450
 these eight to twelve repetitions 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.510
 grabs and you really have a great 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.040
 training effect the most effective airbus 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:23.030
 musculature from after that does me the 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:24.500
 please and do not overestimate yourself then 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.150
 therefore if you still have questions 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.890
 like to write the bank press as 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.140
