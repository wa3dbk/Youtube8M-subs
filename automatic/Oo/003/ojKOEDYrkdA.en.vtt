00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
the biggest struggles that app

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.399 
the biggest struggles that app
developers<00:02:23.579> have<00:02:23.790> is<00:02:24.030> getting<00:02:24.510> exposure<00:02:25.019> to

00:02:25.399 --> 00:02:25.409

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
their apps I think with the website like

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:28.910 
their apps I think with the website like
this<00:02:27.689> where<00:02:27.870> we<00:02:27.989> have<00:02:28.140> a<00:02:28.170> ton<00:02:28.470> of<00:02:28.530> people

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
this where we have a ton of people

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.589 
this where we have a ton of people
willing<00:02:29.579> and<00:02:29.879> ready<00:02:29.909> to<00:02:30.239> check<00:02:30.480> out

willing and ready to check out

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:32.960 
willing and ready to check out
applications<00:02:31.260> I<00:02:31.439> think<00:02:32.040> we<00:02:32.159> can<00:02:32.340> bring<00:02:32.549> a<00:02:32.670> lot

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
applications I think we can bring a lot

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.880 
applications I think we can bring a lot
of<00:02:33.030> exposure<00:02:33.629> to<00:02:33.870> developers<00:02:34.560> that<00:02:34.590> would

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
of exposure to developers that would

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.099 
of exposure to developers that would
otherwise<00:02:35.040> have<00:02:35.340> have<00:02:36.209> their<00:02:36.480> app<00:02:36.599> buried<00:02:36.989> in

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:37.109 
otherwise have have their app buried in

00:02:37.109 --> 00:02:39.949 
otherwise have have their app buried in
the<00:02:37.200> app<00:02:37.349> store<00:02:37.519> so<00:02:38.519> in<00:02:38.849> my<00:02:39.030> opinion<00:02:39.180> is<00:02:39.689> kind

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
the app store so in my opinion is kind

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:41.990
