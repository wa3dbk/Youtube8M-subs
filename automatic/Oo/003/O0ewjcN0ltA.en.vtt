00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.620
 hello welcome to a tutorial of 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.609
 me and that I have for you something 

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:07.830
 I have prepared something more special 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.360
 sarah for a while now and that is 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.400
 it will be about those eyes 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.559
 you see that's pretty bling 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.000
 bling is very much glittering to us though 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.100
 I have this look so often 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.410
 seen 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:21.359
 on pictures with other videos too 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.890
 already and I thought I have to 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.680
 try for aldingen doctor away too 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.340
 I am also a bit heard 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.390
 Sick 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.289
 again and I hope the lok is 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.840
 you like it 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.739
 I have that a bit now 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.440
 personalized as I do 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.989
 would like it or as easiest 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.850
 is to bring these stones on the eye 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.040
 and if you want to know where I am 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.200
 state you have left in the 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.600
 infobox and it should be a lot of fun 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.250
 tutorial I start with a basic make 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.800
 up to and that is the first time 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.969
 Catholic applied the make up is 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.010
 really easy and should 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.789
 actually just your eyes a little bit more 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.129
 give depth 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.050
 First , I comment on my eyes 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.600
 with the naked color of the naked 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.280
 palette with it all the time 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.560
 redness in the car a little less 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.720
 and so just the color 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.240
 shining out from under the stones 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.760
 just something more even than 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.610
 next, it simply blinds you 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.470
 driving a bit or 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.880
 the dark eyeshadow color and there 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.229
 can you really recommend if 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.880
 You notice that it's about even with 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.770
 just blind as long as possible 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.470
 there is always some color on the brush 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.450
 and thus it becomes more even 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.740
 then another eyeliner is pulled and 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.110
 Here you see already a few 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.299
 Stones pure in this coverlet 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.710
 But I did not do the whole thing 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.720
 I will do it again after that 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.340
 explain dry here you see that is 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.590
 Some are already in a good mood and 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.689
 then learn with just gradually 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.649
 then I was all stuck in it when 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:51.149
 this whole procedure is done then 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:52.439
 missing then only the white kohl 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.210
 make your eyes a little bit bigger 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:57.299
 acts and then again eyelash curler 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.130
 and mascara and then your eye 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.560
 actually finished you can of course 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.850
 also use artificial eyelashes 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.049
 but I thought it was easy 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.049
 a little too much for my eyes 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:11.010
 unfortunately not many in the video 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:13.380
 stones full camera could occur because 

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:15.960
 it's just quite a 14 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.520
 I still wanted to work for you 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:19.590
 how I did that and yes I have 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.780
 I already saw that the stones 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.730
 taken here in such a small cap 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.930
 I 've got there for such a small one 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.080
 big crisis blanket taken 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.190
 I just poured it in 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.780
 you have to stop now and then 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.870
 Just shake it a bit 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:37.410
 the side that shines up, so to speak 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:39.660
 shows then I wet soko tapir 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.920
 made then draufgelegt and mostly 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.570
 of course, then keep them 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.780
 not quite firmly off than we ask in 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:47.520
 comes down is rock but if we 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.560
 the precise then directly on the eye does 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.180
 it should work the question is 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.650
 Now how do you make the glue on it me 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.440
 I did it that way in the beginning 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.820
 tried stylish with glue to 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.610
 make it a bit difficult but I have 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:01.350
 just a bit of glue in front of the duo 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.450
 just glue it on a piece of cardboard 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:04.680
 I am mainly made of piece of cardboard 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.210
 then gone in with a toothpick 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.550
 as it already on the legs 

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:09.900
 aid tutorials and then I am 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:11.790
 me with the toothpick is natural 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.190
 very careful gone exactly soaking 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.750
 as I have always so punctually small 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.980
 cute thing you can of course synonymous 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.150
 my hairpins make that the 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.120
 Of course, they are less risky 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:22.620
 maybe more lace in europe gets 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.120
 So just a body 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.680
 a little bit war and then so small 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.270
 make points and then with the q tip 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.370
 just sit on the stony and 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:31.200
 then you will understand all that 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.810
 otherwise I hope that you 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:37.770
 tutorial and I have to go now 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:39.000
 unfortunately slow going and then up to 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:41.130
 my next video and if we are 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.470
 continue to make more unusual make-ups 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:47.959
 have just say and say 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:47.959
 as you follow then bye
