Street<00:00:21.240> Fighter<00:00:22.070> action<00:00:23.070> figure<00:00:23.430> guile<00:00:24.210> and

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
Street Fighter action figure guile and

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.170 
Street Fighter action figure guile and
reversed<00:00:25.140> clothing<00:00:25.860> so<00:00:26.460> as<00:00:26.550> you<00:00:26.640> can<00:00:26.759> see<00:00:26.820> this

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
reversed clothing so as you can see this

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.080 
reversed clothing so as you can see this
is<00:00:27.300> the<00:00:27.450> guile<00:00:27.660> that<00:00:27.990> you<00:00:28.140> never<00:00:28.320> really<00:00:28.619> see

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:29.090 
is the guile that you never really see

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:31.519 
is the guile that you never really see
he<00:00:30.090> actually<00:00:30.210> has<00:00:30.540> reversed<00:00:30.930> clothing<00:00:31.410> you

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
he actually has reversed clothing you

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.100 
he actually has reversed clothing you
know<00:00:31.649> usually<00:00:32.009> guile<00:00:32.220> has<00:00:32.460> the<00:00:32.669> green<00:00:33.110> with

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
know usually guile has the green with

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.139 
know usually guile has the green with
the<00:00:34.260> brown<00:00:34.530> and<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.250> black<00:00:35.460> this<00:00:35.940> one's

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
the brown and the black this one's

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.370 
the brown and the black this one's
actually<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:36.540> reverse<00:00:36.660> clothing<00:00:37.200> so<00:00:37.320> he

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
actually the reverse clothing so he

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.560 
actually the reverse clothing so he
actually<00:00:37.530> has<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:38.100> white<00:00:38.790> hair<00:00:39.180> he<00:00:39.360> has<00:00:39.540> a

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
actually has the white hair he has a

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.479 
actually has the white hair he has a
black<00:00:39.870> tank<00:00:40.170> top<00:00:40.290> and<00:00:40.980> then<00:00:41.130> he's<00:00:41.250> got<00:00:41.370> the

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
black tank top and then he's got the

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.200

black white and gray camel on now the

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.819 
black white and gray camel on now the
only<00:00:45.360> reason<00:00:45.630> I<00:00:45.840> picked<00:00:45.960> up<00:00:46.110> this<00:00:46.290> figures<00:00:46.649> I

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
only reason I picked up this figures I

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.890 
only reason I picked up this figures I
kind<00:00:47.040> of<00:00:47.100> wanted<00:00:47.370> a<00:00:47.520> street<00:00:48.300> fighter<00:00:48.510> figure

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:48.900 
kind of wanted a street fighter figure

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.260 
kind of wanted a street fighter figure
to<00:00:49.170> compare<00:00:50.010> to<00:00:50.130> other<00:00:50.160> action<00:00:50.700> figures<00:00:51.060> and

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
to compare to other action figures and

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.390 
to compare to other action figures and
just<00:00:51.420> to<00:00:51.570> generally<00:00:52.560> know<00:00:52.770> a<00:00:52.800> lot<00:00:53.130> more<00:00:53.340> about

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:53.400 
just to generally know a lot more about

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:54.920 
just to generally know a lot more about
action<00:00:53.970> figures<00:00:54.060> so<00:00:54.390> I<00:00:54.450> picked<00:00:54.660> up<00:00:54.750> this

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
action figures so I picked up this

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.040 
action figures so I picked up this
figure<00:00:56.360> pretty<00:00:57.360> much<00:00:57.540> because<00:00:57.720> I<00:00:57.810> couldn't

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
figure pretty much because I couldn't

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.230 
figure pretty much because I couldn't
pick<00:00:58.200> up<00:00:58.290> the<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:59.250> other<00:00:59.370> guile<00:00:59.670> I<00:00:59.910> would<00:01:00.120> have

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:00.240 
pick up the the other guile I would have

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:01.790 
pick up the the other guile I would have
much<00:01:00.390> rather<00:01:00.420> it<00:01:00.750> had<00:01:00.900> that<00:01:01.079> one<00:01:01.290> but<00:01:01.470> this<00:01:01.620> one

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
much rather it had that one but this one

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.729 
much rather it had that one but this one
is<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.220> same<00:01:02.460> figure<00:01:02.700> just<00:01:03.060> different<00:01:03.739> colors

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
is the same figure just different colors

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.640 
is the same figure just different colors
pretty<00:01:05.220> much<00:01:05.369> a<00:01:05.400> variant<00:01:06.290> now<00:01:07.290> he's<00:01:07.439> called

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
pretty much a variant now he's called

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.429 
pretty much a variant now he's called
the<00:01:07.770> reversed<00:01:08.159> reverse<00:01:09.119> clothes<00:01:09.540> but<00:01:10.170> I<00:01:10.229> also

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
the reversed reverse clothes but I also

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.230 
the reversed reverse clothes but I also
noticed<00:01:10.950> online<00:01:11.340> they<00:01:11.520> he's<00:01:11.640> actually<00:01:11.790> also

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
noticed online they he's actually also

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.830 
noticed online they he's actually also
called<00:01:12.509> the<00:01:12.720> survival<00:01:13.680> mode<00:01:13.890> dial<00:01:14.490> or<00:01:14.850> you

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
called the survival mode dial or you

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.389 
called the survival mode dial or you
know<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.170> other<00:01:16.290> figures<00:01:16.649> in<00:01:16.799> this<00:01:16.890> line<00:01:17.159> like

00:01:17.389 --> 00:01:17.399 
know the other figures in this line like

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:19.069 
know the other figures in this line like
the<00:01:17.579> ryu<00:01:17.820> and<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.180> Ken<00:01:18.390> they<00:01:18.630> actually<00:01:18.930> have

00:01:19.069 --> 00:01:19.079 
the ryu and the Ken they actually have

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:21.530 
the ryu and the Ken they actually have
different<00:01:19.110> names<00:01:19.940> so<00:01:20.940> let's<00:01:21.090> take<00:01:21.240> a<00:01:21.270> look<00:01:21.420> at

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
different names so let's take a look at

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.000 
different names so let's take a look at
this<00:01:21.630> figure<00:01:21.810> now<00:01:22.110> nikka<00:01:22.500> did<00:01:22.710> a<00:01:22.740> really

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:23.010 
this figure now nikka did a really

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.810 
this figure now nikka did a really
really<00:01:23.130> good<00:01:23.520> job

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
really good job

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.780 
really good job
with<00:01:24.630> with<00:01:24.870> these<00:01:25.050> figures<00:01:25.380> nikka<00:01:25.620> does<00:01:26.130> have

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
with with these figures nikka does have

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.969 
with with these figures nikka does have
a<00:01:26.820> reputation<00:01:27.360> for<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:28.050> figures<00:01:28.380> breaking

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
a reputation for the figures breaking

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.370 
a reputation for the figures breaking
though<00:01:29.159> just<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:29.940> plastic<00:01:30.540> they<00:01:30.690> use<00:01:30.900> is<00:01:31.110> just

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
though just the plastic they use is just

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.550 
though just the plastic they use is just
really<00:01:31.770> statue<00:01:32.640> ish<00:01:33.080> that<00:01:34.080> makes<00:01:34.260> any<00:01:34.530> sense

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
really statue ish that makes any sense

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.770 
really statue ish that makes any sense
so<00:01:35.010> it<00:01:35.130> breaks<00:01:35.490> pretty<00:01:35.880> easily<00:01:36.120> so<00:01:36.540> I'm<00:01:36.659> not

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
so it breaks pretty easily so I'm not

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.270 
so it breaks pretty easily so I'm not
gonna<00:01:36.930> be<00:01:37.110> messing<00:01:37.440> around<00:01:37.500> with<00:01:37.860> this<00:01:37.979> figure

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
gonna be messing around with this figure

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.830 
gonna be messing around with this figure
too<00:01:38.460> much<00:01:38.610> and<00:01:38.790> I'm<00:01:38.880> definitely<00:01:39.479> not<00:01:39.630> going<00:01:39.750> to

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
too much and I'm definitely not going to

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.380 
too much and I'm definitely not going to
be<00:01:39.960> playing<00:01:40.260> with<00:01:40.470> them<00:01:40.650> because<00:01:41.390> figures

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
be playing with them because figures

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.109 
be playing with them because figures
like<00:01:42.540> this<00:01:42.780> usually<00:01:43.080> tend<00:01:43.500> to<00:01:43.590> break<00:01:44.030> but<00:01:45.030> as

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
like this usually tend to break but as

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.640 
like this usually tend to break but as
you<00:01:45.240> can<00:01:45.360> see<00:01:45.540> I<00:01:45.570> have<00:01:45.810> two<00:01:46.020> different<00:01:46.350> hands

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:46.650 
you can see I have two different hands

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:48.109 
you can see I have two different hands
on<00:01:46.770> them<00:01:46.920> just<00:01:47.490> so<00:01:47.549> I<00:01:47.580> could<00:01:47.729> give<00:01:47.850> you<00:01:47.880> a<00:01:48.000> good

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
on them just so I could give you a good

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.000 
on them just so I could give you a good
representation<00:01:48.630> of<00:01:49.260> the<00:01:49.680> two<00:01:49.830> different

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:50.010 
representation of the two different

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:51.620 
representation of the two different
hands<00:01:50.310> he<00:01:50.430> comes<00:01:50.700> with<00:01:50.940> so<00:01:51.150> obviously<00:01:51.540> it

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
hands he comes with so obviously it

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.480 
hands he comes with so obviously it
comes<00:01:51.780> with<00:01:52.020> another<00:01:52.290> hand<00:01:52.619> that's<00:01:52.890> open<00:01:53.310> like

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
comes with another hand that's open like

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.820 
comes with another hand that's open like
the<00:01:53.640> right<00:01:53.850> hand<00:01:54.150> and<00:01:55.049> that<00:01:55.200> can<00:01:55.440> be<00:01:55.590> easily

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:55.830 
the right hand and that can be easily

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.730 
the right hand and that can be easily
taken<00:01:56.220> off<00:01:56.580> and<00:01:57.360> putting<00:01:58.080> onto<00:01:58.380> there<00:01:58.530> right

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
taken off and putting onto there right

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.500 
taken off and putting onto there right

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:08.549 
displayed with the two closed fists so

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:09.740 
displayed with the two closed fists so
he<00:02:08.759> is<00:02:08.849> loaded<00:02:09.269> to<00:02:09.390> the<00:02:09.420> brim<00:02:09.720> with

and then the Y

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.830 
and then the Y
on<00:02:28.470> the<00:02:28.650> outside<00:02:29.120> followed<00:02:30.120> by<00:02:30.270> a<00:02:30.300> circle

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
on the outside followed by a circle

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.040 
on the outside followed by a circle
inside<00:02:31.320> with<00:02:31.620> the<00:02:32.310> gray<00:02:32.550> very<00:02:33.390> very<00:02:33.720> cool<00:02:33.990> and

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
it's completely flat love that on this

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.240 
it's completely flat love that on this
figure<00:02:38.870> so<00:02:39.870> the<00:02:40.380> only<00:02:40.680> thing<00:02:40.920> I<00:02:41.040> have<00:02:41.220> a

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
figure so the only thing I have a

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.000 
figure so the only thing I have a
problem<00:02:41.580> with<00:02:41.850> really<00:02:42.450> is<00:02:42.600> the<00:02:43.020> eyes<00:02:43.200> he<00:02:43.740> does

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
problem with really is the eyes he does

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.820 
problem with really is the eyes he does
look<00:02:44.220> like<00:02:44.340> he<00:02:44.520> has<00:02:44.610> a<00:02:44.670> lazy<00:02:44.940> eye<00:02:45.530> which<00:02:46.530> means

look like he has a lazy eye which means

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:48.230 
look like he has a lazy eye which means
I<00:02:46.950> could<00:02:47.100> probably<00:02:47.310> beat<00:02:47.580> his<00:02:47.730> ass<00:02:47.940> because

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240 
I could probably beat his ass because

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.570 
I could probably beat his ass because
you<00:02:48.420> wouldn't<00:02:48.690> know<00:02:48.780> where<00:02:48.990> it<00:02:49.110> was<00:02:49.580> pretty

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
you wouldn't know where it was pretty

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:51.110 
you wouldn't know where it was pretty
funny

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
funny

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.260 
funny

his neck and it does follow him all the
way<00:02:56.490> throughout<00:02:56.850> this<00:02:57.060> figure<00:02:58.520> very<00:02:59.520> cool<00:02:59.940> I

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
way throughout this figure very cool I

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.530 
way throughout this figure very cool I
would<00:03:01.590> imagine<00:03:01.800> they<00:03:02.070> say<00:03:02.280> guile<00:03:02.640> on<00:03:03.030> it<00:03:03.360> or

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
would imagine they say guile on it or

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.830 
would imagine they say guile on it or
something<00:03:04.040> so<00:03:05.040> his<00:03:05.130> head<00:03:05.310> does<00:03:05.550> go<00:03:05.840> forward

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
something so his head does go forward

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.030 
something so his head does go forward
and<00:03:07.080> back<00:03:07.440> and<00:03:07.770> turns<00:03:08.190> left<00:03:08.670> and<00:03:09.440> right<00:03:10.440> the

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
and back and turns left and right the

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.410 
and back and turns left and right the
one<00:03:11.190> thing<00:03:11.400> about<00:03:11.490> this<00:03:11.730> figures<00:03:12.090> it's<00:03:12.270> going

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
one thing about this figures it's going

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.860 
one thing about this figures it's going
to<00:03:12.480> be<00:03:12.600> pretty<00:03:12.810> sticky<00:03:14.360> earned<00:03:15.360> it's<00:03:15.630> gonna<00:03:15.720> be

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
to be pretty sticky earned it's gonna be

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.110 
to be pretty sticky earned it's gonna be
pretty<00:03:16.110> tight<00:03:16.380> jointed<00:03:16.890> so<00:03:17.700> yeah

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
shading on this tank top is really

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.390 
shading on this tank top is really
really<00:03:22.050> nice<00:03:22.230> they<00:03:22.440> did<00:03:22.620> do<00:03:22.770> a<00:03:22.800> really<00:03:23.250> nice

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
really nice they did do a really nice

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.970 
really nice they did do a really nice
job<00:03:23.670> with<00:03:23.730> the<00:03:23.940> colors<00:03:24.590> so<00:03:25.590> the<00:03:25.710> chest

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
job with the colors so the chest

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:27.740 
job with the colors so the chest
articulation<00:03:26.670> just<00:03:26.970> go<00:03:27.120> front<00:03:27.450> and<00:03:27.630> back

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
articulation just go front and back

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.490 
articulation just go front and back
really<00:03:28.530> far<00:03:28.770> front<00:03:29.130> pretty<00:03:29.940> far<00:03:30.150> back<00:03:30.500> does

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
really far front pretty far back does

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.180 
really far front pretty far back does
have<00:03:31.740> waist<00:03:32.070> articulation<00:03:32.250> below<00:03:33.180> the<00:03:33.360> belt

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:38.520 
so that's pretty cool does have the ball

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.310 
so that's pretty cool does have the ball
joints<00:03:39.060> at<00:03:39.270> the<00:03:39.540> upper<00:03:39.780> arm<00:03:39.960> with<00:03:40.200> the

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.320

American flag tattooed on there as you

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.600 
American flag tattooed on there as you
can<00:03:42.120> see<00:03:42.270> it's<00:03:42.420> kind<00:03:42.570> of<00:03:42.600> scraping<00:03:43.080> off<00:03:43.610> it's

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 
can see it's kind of scraping off it's

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:46.580 
can see it's kind of scraping off it's
not<00:03:45.210> scraping<00:03:45.660> off<00:03:45.780> on<00:03:45.930> the<00:03:46.020> other<00:03:46.110> side<00:03:46.410> I

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
not scraping off on the other side I

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.590 
not scraping off on the other side I
have<00:03:46.800> picked<00:03:47.490> up<00:03:47.580> this<00:03:47.760> figure<00:03:48.030> once<00:03:48.330> by<00:03:48.570> the

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
have picked up this figure once by the

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:49.940 
have picked up this figure once by the

this figure especially this figure since

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.120 
this figure especially this figure since
these<00:04:24.510> is<00:04:24.660> a<00:04:24.720> tank<00:04:24.990> talking<00:04:25.440> definitely<00:04:26.010> have

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
these is a tank talking definitely have

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:27.920 
these is a tank talking definitely have
to<00:04:26.250> see<00:04:26.400> the<00:04:26.520> muscle<00:04:26.820> definition<00:04:26.970> within<00:04:27.630> him

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:27.930 
to see the muscle definition within him

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:30.860 
to see the muscle definition within him
because<00:04:28.920> the<00:04:29.070> ryu<00:04:29.310> when<00:04:29.580> the<00:04:29.700> can<00:04:29.910> probably

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:30.870 
because the ryu when the can probably

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:31.820 
because the ryu when the can probably
don't<00:04:31.020> have<00:04:31.140> as<00:04:31.260> much<00:04:31.440> because<00:04:31.650> they're

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
don't have as much because they're

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.940 
don't have as much because they're
wearing<00:04:31.980> clothes<00:04:33.080> so<00:04:34.080> you<00:04:34.110> can<00:04:34.380> see<00:04:34.650> the<00:04:34.770> up

the waist it actually has the same

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:56.000 
the waist it actually has the same
articulation<00:04:54.360> as<00:04:54.540> the<00:04:54.690> DC<00:04:55.080> Universe<00:04:55.500> classic

figures<00:04:56.370> if<00:04:57.060> you<00:04:57.180> can<00:04:57.330> imagine<00:04:57.570> so<00:04:58.050> it<00:04:58.110> does<00:04:58.260> go

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:58.470 
figures if you can imagine so it does go

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:03.650 
figures if you can imagine so it does go
front<00:04:59.090> back<00:05:00.320> out<00:05:01.320> and<00:05:01.800> in<00:05:02.310> just<00:05:02.910> like<00:05:03.120> the<00:05:03.270> DC

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:03.660 
front back out and in just like the DC

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:06.380 
front back out and in just like the DC
Universe<00:05:04.170> Classics<00:05:04.410> articulation<00:05:05.340> which<00:05:06.240> I

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:06.390 
Universe Classics articulation which I

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:10.130 
Universe Classics articulation which I
do<00:05:06.450> very<00:05:06.570> much<00:05:06.930> enjoy<00:05:08.420> then<00:05:09.420> they<00:05:09.870> actually

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:10.140 
do very much enjoy then they actually

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:13.120 
do very much enjoy then they actually
threw<00:05:10.290> an<00:05:10.440> extra<00:05:10.770> joint<00:05:10.980> up<00:05:11.190> here<00:05:11.460> so<00:05:12.300> that's

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:13.130 
threw an extra joint up here so that's

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:15.740 
threw an extra joint up here so that's
looks<00:05:14.130> like<00:05:14.280> an<00:05:14.430> upward<00:05:14.820> thigh<00:05:15.090> swivel<00:05:15.630> right

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:15.750 
looks like an upward thigh swivel right

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:17.510 
looks like an upward thigh swivel right
there<00:05:15.990> and<00:05:16.200> then<00:05:16.410> you<00:05:16.470> can<00:05:16.620> see<00:05:16.770> the<00:05:16.890> detail<00:05:17.310> on

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520 
there and then you can see the detail on

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.420 
there and then you can see the detail on
these<00:05:17.670> camo<00:05:18.000> pants<00:05:18.360> is<00:05:18.630> very<00:05:18.990> nice<00:05:19.290> they<00:05:20.220> did

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:20.430 
these camo pants is very nice they did

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:22.610 
these camo pants is very nice they did
take<00:05:20.640> a<00:05:20.670> lot<00:05:20.910> of<00:05:20.970> time<00:05:21.270> to<00:05:21.600> really<00:05:22.230> throw<00:05:22.470> in

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:22.620 
take a lot of time to really throw in

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:24.500 
take a lot of time to really throw in
the<00:05:22.680> detail<00:05:23.070> in<00:05:23.190> there<00:05:23.340> very<00:05:23.910> nice<00:05:24.150> good<00:05:24.480> job

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:24.510 
the detail in there very nice good job

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:27.470 
the detail in there very nice good job
on<00:05:24.930> necklace<00:05:25.140> part<00:05:26.060> so<00:05:27.060> it<00:05:27.150> does<00:05:27.270> right<00:05:27.420> there

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:27.480 
on necklace part so it does right there

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:30.380 
on necklace part so it does right there
and<00:05:27.840> then<00:05:28.260> I<00:05:28.560> think<00:05:29.280> probably<00:05:29.520> my<00:05:29.820> favorite

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:30.390 
and then I think probably my favorite

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:32.240 
and then I think probably my favorite
part<00:05:30.600> about<00:05:30.690> the<00:05:30.930> whole<00:05:31.080> figures<00:05:31.470> that<00:05:31.710> when

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:32.250 
part about the whole figures that when

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:34.250 
part about the whole figures that when
you<00:05:32.340> actually<00:05:32.460> line<00:05:33.000> up<00:05:33.030> the<00:05:33.390> articulation<00:05:34.140> on

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:34.260 
you actually line up the articulation on

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:35.930 
you actually line up the articulation on
the<00:05:34.380> leg<00:05:34.590> you<00:05:34.800> can't<00:05:35.100> really<00:05:35.340> tell<00:05:35.640> where<00:05:35.820> it

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:35.940 
the leg you can't really tell where it

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:39.320 
the leg you can't really tell where it
is<00:05:36.860> without<00:05:37.860> really<00:05:38.280> taking<00:05:38.580> a<00:05:38.640> close<00:05:38.850> look<00:05:38.970> so

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:39.330 
is without really taking a close look so

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:41.480 
is without really taking a close look so
you<00:05:39.390> looks<00:05:40.200> like<00:05:40.380> a<00:05:40.410> straight<00:05:40.770> pant<00:05:41.040> leg<00:05:41.250> looks

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:41.490 
you looks like a straight pant leg looks

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:45.470 
you looks like a straight pant leg looks
like<00:05:41.580> it's<00:05:41.820> a<00:05:42.120> statue<00:05:43.110> but<00:05:43.320> actually<00:05:44.480> there's

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:45.480 
like it's a statue but actually there's

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:48.950 
like it's a statue but actually there's
pieces<00:05:45.780> are<00:05:46.050> of<00:05:46.470> articulation<00:05:47.220> in<00:05:47.340> there<00:05:47.960> so

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:48.960 
pieces are of articulation in there so

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:50.659 
pieces are of articulation in there so
it<00:05:49.050> looks<00:05:49.110> like<00:05:49.290> two<00:05:49.950> points<00:05:50.280> at<00:05:50.400> the<00:05:50.490> knees

00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:50.669 
it looks like two points at the knees

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:54.470 
it looks like two points at the knees
and<00:05:50.940> it<00:05:51.120> does<00:05:51.900> take<00:05:52.140> a<00:05:52.169> a<00:05:52.940> very<00:05:53.940> long<00:05:54.180> distance

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:54.480 
and it does take a a very long distance

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:56.360 
and it does take a a very long distance
for<00:05:54.960> that<00:05:54.990> articulation<00:05:55.770> that<00:05:55.860> takes<00:05:56.100> up<00:05:56.220> most

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:56.370 
for that articulation that takes up most

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:58.969 
for that articulation that takes up most
of<00:05:56.550> the<00:05:56.640> legs<00:05:56.910> so<00:05:57.090> the<00:05:57.390> the<00:05:57.870> knee<00:05:58.050> part<00:05:58.260> is<00:05:58.410> in

00:05:58.969 --> 00:05:58.979 
of the legs so the the knee part is in

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:02.540 
of the legs so the the knee part is in
the<00:05:59.669> middle<00:05:59.970> right<00:06:00.180> there<00:06:01.190> so<00:06:02.190> there's<00:06:02.340> one

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:02.550 
the middle right there so there's one

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:03.950 
the middle right there so there's one
joint<00:06:02.820> at<00:06:02.970> the<00:06:03.000> bottom<00:06:03.450> and<00:06:03.600> then<00:06:03.690> another

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:03.960 
joint at the bottom and then another

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:07.790 
joint at the bottom and then another
joint<00:06:04.320> at<00:06:04.440> the<00:06:04.470> top<00:06:04.740> very<00:06:05.400> very<00:06:05.700> cool<00:06:06.560> then<00:06:07.560> we

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:07.800 
joint at the top very very cool then we

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:09.920 
joint at the top very very cool then we
have<00:06:08.040> the<00:06:08.340> foot<00:06:08.669> articulation<00:06:09.300> and<00:06:09.479> the<00:06:09.540> boot

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:09.930 
have the foot articulation and the boot

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:12.520 
have the foot articulation and the boot
is<00:06:10.110> very<00:06:10.530> detailed<00:06:11.010> I<00:06:11.280> really<00:06:11.669> enjoy<00:06:11.940> the<00:06:12.090> boot

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:12.530 
is very detailed I really enjoy the boot

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:17.000 
is very detailed I really enjoy the boot
looks<00:06:13.530> really<00:06:14.340> nice<00:06:15.200> just<00:06:16.200> all-around<00:06:16.440> got

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:17.010 
looks really nice just all-around got

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:21.070 
looks really nice just all-around got
the<00:06:17.130> tread<00:06:17.370> on<00:06:17.400> the<00:06:17.640> bottom<00:06:18.650> very<00:06:19.650> nice<00:06:19.919> figure

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:21.080 
the tread on the bottom very nice figure

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:23.450 
the tread on the bottom very nice figure
does<00:06:22.080> seem<00:06:22.320> like<00:06:22.500> it<00:06:22.620> would<00:06:22.740> break<00:06:23.010> if<00:06:23.190> I<00:06:23.310> was

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:23.460 
does seem like it would break if I was

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:26.480 
does seem like it would break if I was
to<00:06:23.790> mess<00:06:23.970> around<00:06:24.120> with<00:06:24.419> it<00:06:24.570> a<00:06:24.630> lot<00:06:24.840> though<00:06:25.490> so

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:26.490 
to mess around with it a lot though so

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:29.200 
to mess around with it a lot though so
the<00:06:26.580> articulation<00:06:27.240> is<00:06:27.390> below<00:06:27.660> the<00:06:27.810> little

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:29.210 
the articulation is below the little

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:32.090 
the articulation is below the little
cuffs<00:06:30.210> on<00:06:30.419> the<00:06:30.510> boot<00:06:30.720> or<00:06:31.410> above<00:06:31.620> the<00:06:31.740> cuffs<00:06:31.950> on

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:32.100 
cuffs on the boot or above the cuffs on

cuffs on the boot or above the cuffs on
the<00:06:32.190> boot<00:06:32.310> sorry<00:06:33.050> 360<00:06:34.050> degrees<00:06:34.760> articulation

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:35.760 
the boot sorry 360 degrees articulation

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:38.110 
the boot sorry 360 degrees articulation
does<00:06:35.940> have<00:06:36.120> a<00:06:36.150> pivot<00:06:36.690> on<00:06:36.960> the<00:06:37.110> foot<00:06:37.290> as<00:06:37.440> well

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:38.120 
does have a pivot on the foot as well

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:43.400 
does have a pivot on the foot as well
right<00:06:39.120> there<00:06:39.360> it<00:06:39.570> does<00:06:39.810> go<00:06:40.050> front<00:06:40.740> and<00:06:42.050> back

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:43.410 
right there it does go front and back

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:45.620 
right there it does go front and back
not<00:06:43.710> too<00:06:44.190> much<00:06:44.430> one<00:06:44.760> of<00:06:44.850> those<00:06:45.000> go<00:06:45.210> pretty<00:06:45.450> far

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:45.630 
not too much one of those go pretty far

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:46.960 
not too much one of those go pretty far
back

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:46.970

and pretty far forward and there's the

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:53.800 
and pretty far forward and there's the
actual<00:06:51.190> articulation<00:06:52.190> on<00:06:52.400> the<00:06:52.670> foot<00:06:52.940> she<00:06:53.660> says

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:53.810 
actual articulation on the foot she says

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:55.960 
actual articulation on the foot she says
go<00:06:53.990> up<00:06:54.230> and<00:06:54.410> down<00:06:54.560> and<00:06:54.920> as<00:06:55.130> well<00:06:55.400> as<00:06:55.490> that<00:06:55.520> pivot

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:55.970 
go up and down and as well as that pivot

00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:58.180 
go up and down and as well as that pivot
like<00:06:56.120> I<00:06:56.240> said<00:06:56.450> there's<00:06:57.380> tread<00:06:57.830> on<00:06:58.010> the<00:06:58.160> bottom

00:06:58.180 --> 00:06:58.190 
like I said there's tread on the bottom

of the foot as well one thing I noticed
about<00:07:00.950> this<00:07:01.190> figure<00:07:01.550> that<00:07:01.730> you<00:07:01.820> won't<00:07:02.030> see<00:07:02.240> on
