00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.960
 evil useless star will work 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.850
 inside the tailoring 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.230
 if you like the clothes we wear 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:24.830
 local roof book on our site 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:27.990
 www.telimar.it thanks and values 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:30.689
 immaterial that we will need to do 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:35.340
 our chapel is a form of basko of the 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:37.800
 scissors to cut into the fabric 1 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:42.239
 stretch fabric that we will need for 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:44.820
 the band is a fabric instead of wool that 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:48.719
 may be sicily or not that 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:51.239
 giuseppe was among all the vasco and not 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:54.449
 run away model that we will go into now 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:57.300
 takes a rectangle 52 centimeters per 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.820
 ten that is the part the model 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.260
 we'll need to end this 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.359
 point once and a half drawn the 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:07.080
 your tango you will have to make some notches 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:09.750
 one in the center and two at a 4 of yours 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.700
 then start from the center 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.760
 taking up another piece of paper e 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.920
 make a circle that has as it called 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.900
 for 50 centimeters 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.090
 at this point you do also in this case 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.890
 notches at a quarter and a quarter e 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.500
 a quarter of the circle 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.619
 we take the fabrics we start from the fabric 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:32.009
 stretch for the single band 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:34.200
 of the stop we lean the model in 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:37.049
 so that the elastic part of the 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:41.340
 fabric is for the long then for the 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:43.829
 part of the 52 cm we support the model 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:47.189
 on the right of the fabric it is certain already that 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:49.380
 we put the pins once it has 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:53.130
 tapped the model take the scissors 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:55.780
 for the Italian fabric 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:59.470
 but the model kit with the four 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:02.110
 stages of this we take the other party 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:04.300
 of the model made the position circle 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:07.180
 I always love on the right side of the fabric e 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:10.210
 such that I do not know is just one 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:11.080
 piece of fabric so don't get caught in 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:13.330
 double 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:16.270
 we explain our pattern to 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:25.060
 fabric and then with fabric scissors 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:27.040
 we cut also in this case of 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:30.250
 take off model we do in the four 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.380
 notches on the four segments that we are not 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:35.380
 the purple part of the fabric that is the 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:37.720
 band we put it straight against the 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:45.780
 straight and we sew the universe into the side 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:45.780
 short we fold our band in half 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:53.450
 in always aiming with pins 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:55.819
 so that it does not move at this 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:59.690
 point once you have tapped the 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:02.180
 band we take the other piece of 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:05.090
 fabric and we put it on touch 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:08.830
 attacks of that octane it must 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.830
 match up with the notch of the purple 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:15.920
 all around china once positioned all 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:18.830
 the banks in the remaining part of 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:22.190
 fabric we make folds in a manner 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:25.880
 such that the octane part becomes large 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:27.739
 as much as the purple part and behold 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:30.709
 we have all the folds on the 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:34.070
 our hat at this point for 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:36.380
 sew the two parts of brackets together e 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:39.140
 so they have all the folds there 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:41.180
 we teach to use a point 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:42.950
 particular we will call it use a 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:45.019
 stretch stitch of yours 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:46.730
 car because if we were a point 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:48.170
 straight it would break at the first time 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:51.200
 that you put your hat on that 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:53.930
 instead made resources quoted what 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.400
 you have to use is a particular zig zag 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:58.220
 which is our car 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:01.370
 marked by point 09 which has it 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:04.930
 slightly speckled zig zag doesn't have one 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:04.930
 straight seam die punished 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:14.870
 the seam we remove the pins and behold 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:14.870
 our hat finished
