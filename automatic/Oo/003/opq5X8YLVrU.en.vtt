00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
fastest in the world but they're really

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.100 
fastest in the world but they're really
really<00:00:53.520> good<00:00:53.760> fun<00:00:54.300> when<00:00:54.539> you<00:00:54.629> get<00:00:54.809> them<00:00:54.930> up<00:00:55.079> to

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
really good fun when you get them up to

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.020 
really good fun when you get them up to
speed<00:00:55.379> and<00:00:55.800> especially<00:00:56.399> they<00:00:56.699> have<00:00:56.789> a<00:00:56.850> good

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
speed and especially they have a good

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.549 
speed and especially they have a good
race<00:00:57.239> like<00:00:57.510> I<00:00:57.629> was<00:00:57.750> having<00:00:57.840> here<00:00:58.199> with<00:00:58.350> will

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
race like I was having here with will

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.709 
race like I was having here with will
will<00:00:59.160> gets<00:00:59.399> the<00:00:59.550> good<00:00:59.730> start<00:01:00.030> obviously<00:01:00.480> I'm

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
will gets the good start obviously I'm

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.869 
will gets the good start obviously I'm
quite<00:01:01.020> a<00:01:01.050> lot<00:01:01.289> taller<00:01:01.530> than<00:01:01.800> will<00:01:02.039> so<00:01:02.520> I<00:01:02.550> don't

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
quite a lot taller than will so I don't

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.369 
quite a lot taller than will so I don't
get<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.180> good<00:01:03.300> stuff<00:01:03.359> a<00:01:03.570> little<00:01:03.809> bit<00:01:04.019> heavier

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
get the good stuff a little bit heavier

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:05.899 
get the good stuff a little bit heavier
as<00:01:04.589> well<00:01:04.799> so<00:01:05.010> that<00:01:05.129> doesn't<00:01:05.400> really<00:01:05.430> help<00:01:05.729> me

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
as well so that doesn't really help me

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.850 
as well so that doesn't really help me
out<00:01:05.939> especially<00:01:06.840> in<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:06.990> start<00:01:07.290> but<00:01:07.530> he's

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
out especially in the start but he's

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.710 
out especially in the start but he's
want<00:01:08.130> to<00:01:08.220> go<00:01:08.340> kart<00:01:08.670> championship<00:01:08.729> so<00:01:09.570> it's

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
want to go kart championship so it's

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.899 
want to go kart championship so it's
something<00:01:10.049> to<00:01:10.229> live<00:01:10.380> up<00:01:10.409> to<00:01:10.770> I<00:01:10.979> know<00:01:11.369> these<00:01:11.729> are

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
something to live up to I know these are

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.580 
something to live up to I know these are
a<00:01:12.000> great<00:01:12.030> racer<00:01:12.510> so<00:01:12.840> it's<00:01:12.990> going<00:01:13.110> to<00:01:13.200> be<00:01:13.290> a<00:01:13.320> good

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
a great racer so it's going to be a good

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.710 
a great racer so it's going to be a good
race<00:01:13.770> here<00:01:14.070> so<00:01:14.640> we<00:01:14.760> can<00:01:14.880> see<00:01:15.090> here<00:01:15.330> going

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
race here so we can see here going

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.719 
race here so we can see here going
through<00:01:15.780> side<00:01:16.320> by<00:01:16.619> side<00:01:17.009> you<00:01:17.280> might<00:01:17.430> have<00:01:17.549> just

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
through side by side you might have just

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:18.890 
through side by side you might have just
seen<00:01:17.909> on<00:01:18.030> your<00:01:18.150> left-hand<00:01:18.420> side<00:01:18.720> of<00:01:18.750> your

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
seen on your left-hand side of your

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.050 
seen on your left-hand side of your
screen<00:01:18.990> we<00:01:19.830> were<00:01:19.950> quite<00:01:20.280> close<00:01:20.520> to<00:01:20.759> each<00:01:20.820> other

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
screen we were quite close to each other

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.870 
screen we were quite close to each other
there<00:01:21.390> I<00:01:21.570> think<00:01:22.170> not<00:01:22.799> any<00:01:23.100> contact<00:01:23.640> was<00:01:23.850> made

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
there I think not any contact was made

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.270 
there I think not any contact was made
which<00:01:24.299> was<00:01:24.479> good<00:01:24.689> to<00:01:24.840> see<00:01:25.080> now<00:01:25.530> we'll<00:01:25.770> dives<00:01:26.040> it

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
which was good to see now we'll dives it

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.640 
which was good to see now we'll dives it
up<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.580> inside<00:01:27.299> here<00:01:27.659> going<00:01:27.960> into<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.350> fast

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
up the inside here going into the fast

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.530 
up the inside here going into the fast
right-hander<00:01:29.310> which<00:01:29.430> in<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:29.670> dry<00:01:29.880> is<00:01:30.119> flat

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
right-hander which in the dry is flat

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.149 
right-hander which in the dry is flat
but<00:01:30.570> you<00:01:30.900> can<00:01:31.049> see<00:01:31.200> there<00:01:31.470> is<00:01:31.619> caught

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
but you can see there is caught

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.550 
but you can see there is caught
squirming<00:01:33.000> through<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.600> fast<00:01:33.840> right-hander

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
squirming through the fast right-hander

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.499 
squirming through the fast right-hander
which<00:01:34.710> leaves<00:01:34.920> him<00:01:35.100> with<00:01:35.310> bad<00:01:35.610> speed<00:01:36.030> going<00:01:36.329> up

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
which leaves him with bad speed going up

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:37.999 
which leaves him with bad speed going up
here<00:01:36.720> so<00:01:36.900> I'm<00:01:36.990> going<00:01:37.200> for<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:37.409> defensive<00:01:37.979> line

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
here so I'm going for the defensive line

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.370 
here so I'm going for the defensive line

ever going go-karting I know that these
aren't<00:02:06.299> super<00:02:06.630> fast<00:02:06.869> karts<00:02:07.290> but<00:02:07.680> that's<00:02:08.009> not

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
the point it's all about having fun at

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.570

go kart but I'm not too sure I'm still

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.630 
go kart but I'm not too sure I'm still
thinking<00:02:15.900> about<00:02:16.170> there<00:02:16.560> and<00:02:16.770> it<00:02:17.220> cuz<00:02:17.370> think<00:02:17.580> I

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
thinking about there and it cuz think I

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:18.890 
thinking about there and it cuz think I
think<00:02:17.790> you<00:02:17.850> can<00:02:17.970> see<00:02:18.120> here<00:02:18.330> we<00:02:18.569> were<00:02:18.630> starving

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
think you can see here we were starving

think you can see here we were starving
it<00:02:19.110> up<00:02:19.200> the<00:02:19.319> inside<00:02:19.590> I<00:02:19.620> wasn't<00:02:20.190> defending

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
it up the inside I wasn't defending

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:22.370 
it up the inside I wasn't defending
which<00:02:20.790> was<00:02:21.000> a<00:02:21.150> bit<00:02:21.510> stupid<00:02:21.810> of<00:02:22.080> me<00:02:22.110> and<00:02:22.319> now

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
which was a bit stupid of me and now

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:23.900 
which was a bit stupid of me and now
we're<00:02:22.500> running<00:02:22.620> side<00:02:22.920> by<00:02:22.950> side<00:02:23.310> I<00:02:23.340> think<00:02:23.670> will

thought he was coming down the inside
bit<00:02:27.540> was<00:02:27.630> actually<00:02:27.840> trying<00:02:27.930> on<00:02:28.080> the<00:02:28.230> outside

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
bit was actually trying on the outside

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.710 
bit was actually trying on the outside
there<00:02:29.010> he's<00:02:29.520> using<00:02:29.880> his<00:02:29.970> tactics<00:02:30.420> the<00:02:30.540> drum

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
there he's using his tactics the drum

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.000 
there he's using his tactics the drum
get<00:02:30.870> past<00:02:31.080> me<00:02:31.230> here<00:02:31.410> and<00:02:31.500> I'm<00:02:31.560> going<00:02:31.709> to<00:02:31.800> slow

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
through here and I make a mistake here

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:35.479 
through here and I make a mistake here
which<00:02:34.290> would<00:02:34.380> make<00:02:34.530> myself<00:02:34.770> run<00:02:35.130> over<00:02:35.400> the

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
which would make myself run over the

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:37.040 
which would make myself run over the
curbing<00:02:35.880> on<00:02:35.970> the<00:02:36.030> outside<00:02:36.330> which<00:02:36.569> let's<00:02:36.780> wheel

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
curbing on the outside which let's wheel

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.410 
curbing on the outside which let's wheel
through<00:02:37.500> and<00:02:37.709> up<00:02:38.160> into<00:02:38.400> the<00:02:38.610> lead<00:02:38.819> let's<00:02:39.360> just

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
through and up into the lead let's just

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.420 
through and up into the lead let's just
a<00:02:39.569> part<00:02:39.780> of<00:02:39.810> the<00:02:39.900> tractor<00:02:40.230> I'm<00:02:40.350> really<00:02:40.830> fast<00:02:41.130> up

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
a part of the tractor I'm really fast up

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.150 
a part of the tractor I'm really fast up
through<00:02:41.819> the<00:02:42.090> the<00:02:42.300> bottom<00:02:42.480> hand<00:02:42.870> kink<00:02:43.290> and<00:02:43.500> you

through the the bottom hand kink and you
need<00:02:44.310> to<00:02:44.430> get<00:02:44.580> a<00:02:44.610> good<00:02:44.790> momentum<00:02:45.030> and<00:02:45.300> that's

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
need to get a good momentum and that's

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.630 
need to get a good momentum and that's
exactly<00:02:45.660> what<00:02:46.200> I<00:02:46.230> did<00:02:46.290> here<00:02:46.769> I<00:02:46.920> kept<00:02:47.370> it<00:02:47.519> on<00:02:47.610> the

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:50.870 
insider make sure I didn't go flat out
because<00:02:49.860> if<00:02:49.950> you<00:02:50.010> go<00:02:50.040> flat<00:02:50.370> out<00:02:50.400> you<00:02:50.730> can

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
because if you go flat out you can

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.150 
because if you go flat out you can
easily<00:02:51.120> drift<00:02:51.930> wide<00:02:52.230> and<00:02:52.500> slide<00:02:52.650> into<00:02:53.070> the

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
easily drift wide and slide into the

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.410 
easily drift wide and slide into the
other<00:02:53.280> car<00:02:53.370> and<00:02:53.790> I<00:02:53.820> didn't<00:02:54.060> want<00:02:54.180> to<00:02:54.239> do<00:02:54.360> that

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
other car and I didn't want to do that

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.840 
other car and I didn't want to do that
whatsoever<00:02:54.930> and<00:02:55.410> i<00:02:55.769> will<00:02:56.010> switch<00:02:56.370> back<00:02:56.640> and

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
whatsoever and i will switch back and

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:58.550 
whatsoever and i will switch back and
drive<00:02:56.970> around<00:02:57.180> the<00:02:57.420> inside<00:02:57.690> I<00:02:57.989> honestly

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
drive around the inside I honestly

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.559 
drive around the inside I honestly
thought<00:02:58.739> we<00:02:58.890> had<00:02:59.010> really<00:02:59.459> bad<00:02:59.640> speed<00:03:00.120> up<00:03:00.300> there

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:00.569 
thought we had really bad speed up there

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:02.630 
thought we had really bad speed up there
and<00:03:00.750> my<00:03:01.290> good<00:03:01.590> point<00:03:01.860> around<00:03:02.010> this<00:03:02.190> track<00:03:02.459> at

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
and my good point around this track at

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.150 
and my good point around this track at
least<00:03:02.880> is<00:03:03.060> not<00:03:03.560> defending<00:03:04.560> it's<00:03:04.709> definitely

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
least is not defending it's definitely

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.890 
least is not defending it's definitely
attacking<00:03:05.670> is<00:03:05.790> where<00:03:05.940> I<00:03:05.970> can<00:03:06.209> go<00:03:06.390> at<00:03:06.569> it<00:03:06.600> I

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
attacking is where I can go at it I

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.479 
attacking is where I can go at it I
think<00:03:07.200> that's<00:03:07.350> what<00:03:07.440> made<00:03:07.620> for<00:03:07.800> a<00:03:07.860> good<00:03:08.040> battle

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
think that's what made for a good battle

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:10.100 
think that's what made for a good battle
because<00:03:08.730> will<00:03:08.970> is<00:03:09.000> very<00:03:09.450> good<00:03:09.720> at<00:03:09.810> defending

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
because will is very good at defending

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.740 
because will is very good at defending
and<00:03:10.410> I'm<00:03:10.500> you<00:03:11.220> know<00:03:11.250> a<00:03:11.370> lot<00:03:11.700> great<00:03:12.090> but<00:03:12.360> I'm

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
and I'm you know a lot great but I'm

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.449 
and I'm you know a lot great but I'm
better<00:03:12.989> at<00:03:13.230> attacking<00:03:13.560> i<00:03:13.830> am<00:03:13.920> at<00:03:14.040> defending

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
better at attacking i am at defending

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:16.009 
better at attacking i am at defending
and<00:03:14.610> going<00:03:14.850> round<00:03:15.060> the<00:03:15.120> outside<00:03:15.209> here<00:03:15.720> in<00:03:15.750> wet

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 
and going round the outside here in wet

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:18.500 
and going round the outside here in wet
conditions<00:03:16.170> wasn't<00:03:17.040> the<00:03:17.459> best<00:03:17.700> of<00:03:17.910> ideas<00:03:18.060> but

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
conditions wasn't the best of ideas but

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.300 
conditions wasn't the best of ideas but
i<00:03:18.570> made<00:03:18.810> it<00:03:18.840> stick<00:03:19.260> there<00:03:19.500> was<00:03:19.590> more<00:03:19.769> grip<00:03:20.100> out

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
i made it stick there was more grip out

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.190 
i made it stick there was more grip out
there<00:03:20.549> and<00:03:20.940> especially<00:03:21.239> will<00:03:21.660> on<00:03:21.780> the<00:03:21.900> inside

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
there and especially will on the inside

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.350 
there and especially will on the inside
had<00:03:22.410> no<00:03:22.650> grip<00:03:22.950> because<00:03:23.130> the<00:03:23.730> wet<00:03:23.940> part<00:03:24.150> the

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
had no grip because the wet part the

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:25.789 
had no grip because the wet part the
track<00:03:24.600> there<00:03:24.989> and<00:03:25.170> obviously<00:03:25.260> when<00:03:25.680> you're

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:25.799 
track there and obviously when you're

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:27.650 
track there and obviously when you're
going<00:03:25.950> slow<00:03:26.310> it's<00:03:26.790> hard<00:03:27.000> to<00:03:27.150> put<00:03:27.299> the<00:03:27.420> power

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
going slow it's hard to put the power

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:28.819 
going slow it's hard to put the power
down<00:03:27.690> so<00:03:27.989> i<00:03:28.019> just<00:03:28.200> put<00:03:28.410> it<00:03:28.500> round<00:03:28.620> the<00:03:28.739> outside

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:28.829 
down so i just put it round the outside

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:31.039 
down so i just put it round the outside
and<00:03:29.310> got<00:03:29.489> the<00:03:29.610> position<00:03:30.000> you<00:03:30.360> can<00:03:30.480> see<00:03:30.690> a<00:03:30.720> nice

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
and got the position you can see a nice

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:33.530 
and got the position you can see a nice
bit<00:03:31.709> of<00:03:31.739> water<00:03:32.100> completely<00:03:32.850> destroying<00:03:33.390> our

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
bit of water completely destroying our

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:34.880 
bit of water completely destroying our
view<00:03:33.780> but<00:03:33.930> it's<00:03:34.049> off<00:03:34.110> the<00:03:34.140> screen<00:03:34.530> now<00:03:34.709> and

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
view but it's off the screen now and

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:36.199 
view but it's off the screen now and
they're<00:03:35.250> going<00:03:35.459> to<00:03:35.549> the<00:03:35.730> hair<00:03:35.880> put<00:03:36.030> at<00:03:36.120> the<00:03:36.150> top

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
they're going to the hair put at the top

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:38.420 
they're going to the hair put at the top
you<00:03:36.750> can<00:03:36.900> easily<00:03:37.500> lose<00:03:37.680> it<00:03:37.920> there<00:03:38.040> if<00:03:38.160> you<00:03:38.250> try

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
you can easily lose it there if you try

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:39.560 
you can easily lose it there if you try
and<00:03:38.489> go<00:03:38.640> in<00:03:38.760> the<00:03:38.850> inside<00:03:39.180> line<00:03:39.390> which<00:03:39.540> is

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:39.570 
and go in the inside line which is

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:41.630 
and go in the inside line which is
exactly<00:03:39.810> what<00:03:40.260> I<00:03:40.320> did<00:03:40.709> and<00:03:40.980> I<00:03:41.250> completely

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
exactly what I did and I completely

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.550 
exactly what I did and I completely
messed<00:03:42.060> that<00:03:42.329> up<00:03:42.390> and<00:03:42.840> now<00:03:43.200> I'm<00:03:43.290> going<00:03:43.410> to<00:03:43.470> be

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
messed that up and now I'm going to be

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.430 
messed that up and now I'm going to be
trying<00:03:43.739> to<00:03:44.370> try<00:03:44.609> and<00:03:44.730> overhaul<00:03:45.359> the<00:03:45.959> lapped

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
trying to try and overhaul the lapped

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.289 
trying to try and overhaul the lapped
cars<00:03:46.560> that<00:03:46.950> will<00:03:47.040> be<00:03:47.310> encountering<00:03:47.910> in<00:03:48.120> a

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:48.299 
cars that will be encountering in a

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:51.050 
cars that will be encountering in a
couple<00:03:48.720> of<00:03:48.930> laps<00:03:49.590> time<00:03:50.040> it's<00:03:50.519> gonna<00:03:50.670> be<00:03:50.850> hard

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
couple of laps time it's gonna be hard

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:52.940 
couple of laps time it's gonna be hard
to<00:03:51.209> do<00:03:51.329> that<00:03:51.359> because<00:03:51.660> Ben<00:03:52.140> I<00:03:52.440> think<00:03:52.650> it<00:03:52.890> will

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
to do that because Ben I think it will

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:54.500 
to do that because Ben I think it will
be<00:03:53.100> the<00:03:53.220> first<00:03:53.400> person<00:03:53.579> we<00:03:53.850> come<00:03:54.030> across<00:03:54.150> he's

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
be the first person we come across he's

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:56.270 
be the first person we come across he's
fast<00:03:54.810> in<00:03:55.079> a<00:03:55.140> straight<00:03:55.170> line<00:03:55.500> and<00:03:56.010> the<00:03:56.130> main

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
fast in a straight line and the main

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.280 
fast in a straight line and the main
reason<00:03:56.609> for<00:03:56.640> that<00:03:56.850> is<00:03:57.090> that<00:03:57.120> bin<00:03:57.660> weighs<00:03:57.930> a<00:03:57.959> lot

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
reason for that is that bin weighs a lot

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.199 
reason for that is that bin weighs a lot
less<00:03:58.350> than<00:03:58.799> the<00:03:58.890> rest<00:03:59.070> of<00:03:59.250> us<00:03:59.340> so<00:03:59.880> he's<00:04:00.000> a<00:04:00.030> lot

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
less than the rest of us so he's a lot

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:01.849 
less than the rest of us so he's a lot
faster<00:04:00.390> in<00:04:00.720> a<00:04:00.780> straight<00:04:01.079> line<00:04:01.109> but<00:04:01.500> he<00:04:01.650> has

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:01.859 
faster in a straight line but he has

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:04.039 
faster in a straight line but he has
made<00:04:02.070> a<00:04:02.100> couple<00:04:02.370> of<00:04:02.579> mistakes<00:04:02.700> here<00:04:03.060> and<00:04:03.359> I

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:04.049 
made a couple of mistakes here and I

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:06.050 
made a couple of mistakes here and I
think<00:04:04.350> we<00:04:04.560> have<00:04:04.769> got<00:04:05.040> a<00:04:05.070> little<00:04:05.370> bit<00:04:05.670> of<00:04:05.700> a<00:04:05.850> gap

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
think we have got a little bit of a gap

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.330 
think we have got a little bit of a gap
here<00:04:06.090> to<00:04:06.510> will<00:04:06.750> and<00:04:06.930> this<00:04:07.560> is<00:04:07.709> the<00:04:07.829> third<00:04:08.070> race

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
here to will and this is the third race

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:09.949 
here to will and this is the third race
of<00:04:08.549> the<00:04:08.609> day<00:04:08.790> I<00:04:08.820> think<00:04:09.269> if<00:04:09.420> you<00:04:09.540> go<00:04:09.690> on<00:04:09.750> my

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
of the day I think if you go on my

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:11.990 
of the day I think if you go on my
channel<00:04:10.410> that<00:04:10.620> afterlife<00:04:11.100> you'll<00:04:11.700> be<00:04:11.820> able<00:04:11.910> to

here this sort of the boring part of the

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:20.659 
here this sort of the boring part of the
race<00:04:19.200> where<00:04:19.410> nothing<00:04:19.739> really<00:04:19.769> was<00:04:20.250> happening

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669 
race where nothing really was happening

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:22.460 
race where nothing really was happening
the<00:04:21.030> start<00:04:21.299> the<00:04:21.450> race<00:04:21.539> was<00:04:21.780> really<00:04:22.049> fun

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
the start the race was really fun

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:23.930 
the start the race was really fun
because<00:04:22.500> we<00:04:22.860> were<00:04:23.039> side<00:04:23.220> by<00:04:23.250> so<00:04:23.610> I<00:04:23.640> through<00:04:23.880> a

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
because we were side by so I through a

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.909 
because we were side by so I through a
lot<00:04:24.120> the<00:04:24.270> corners<00:04:24.630> but<00:04:24.810> it's<00:04:25.260> really<00:04:25.650> hard<00:04:25.830> to

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919 
lot the corners but it's really hard to

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:27.170 
lot the corners but it's really hard to
keep<00:04:26.070> your<00:04:26.220> concentration<00:04:26.430> when<00:04:27.030> you

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
keep your concentration when you

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.420 
keep your concentration when you
out<00:04:27.240> in<00:04:27.419> front<00:04:27.449> and<00:04:28.070> especially<00:04:29.070> in<00:04:29.280> wet

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
out in front and especially in wet

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:30.590 
out in front and especially in wet
conditions<00:04:29.610> you've<00:04:30.060> got<00:04:30.240> to<00:04:30.330> keep<00:04:30.449> your

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:30.600 
conditions you've got to keep your

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.510 
conditions you've got to keep your
concentration<00:04:30.810> but<00:04:31.530> if<00:04:32.039> you<00:04:32.220> know<00:04:32.370> you've

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520 
concentration but if you know you've

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:33.980 
concentration but if you know you've
brought<00:04:32.729> a<00:04:32.759> little<00:04:32.940> bit<00:04:33.120> of<00:04:33.180> a<00:04:33.300> gap<00:04:33.479> you<00:04:33.750> trot

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:33.990 
brought a little bit of a gap you trot

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:35.420 
brought a little bit of a gap you trot
you<00:04:34.080> shut<00:04:34.289> up<00:04:34.320> start<00:04:34.620> relaxing<00:04:34.919> and<00:04:35.250> that's

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 
you shut up start relaxing and that's

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.520 
you shut up start relaxing and that's
the<00:04:35.520> worst<00:04:35.789> possible<00:04:36.570> state<00:04:36.840> you<00:04:36.990> could<00:04:37.139> be<00:04:37.350> in

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:37.530 
the worst possible state you could be in

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:40.100 
the worst possible state you could be in
because<00:04:37.830> when<00:04:38.400> you<00:04:38.520> lose<00:04:38.699> concentration<00:04:39.110> you

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.110 
because when you lose concentration you

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:42.290 
because when you lose concentration you
really<00:04:40.500> can<00:04:40.770> easily<00:04:41.460> make<00:04:41.669> mistakes<00:04:42.120> and<00:04:42.270> I

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300 
really can easily make mistakes and I

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:43.909 
really can easily make mistakes and I
think<00:04:42.509> here<00:04:42.690> we<00:04:42.870> were<00:04:42.990> is<00:04:43.169> trying<00:04:43.590> to<00:04:43.650> attack

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:43.919 
think here we were is trying to attack

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:46.100 
think here we were is trying to attack
that's<00:04:44.190> why<00:04:44.370> I'm<00:04:44.460> super<00:04:44.970> defending<00:04:45.539> on<00:04:45.720> the

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.110 
that's why I'm super defending on the

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:47.600 
that's why I'm super defending on the
inside<00:04:46.410> I<00:04:46.440> sort<00:04:46.830> of<00:04:46.860> drift<00:04:47.130> out<00:04:47.250> a<00:04:47.280> little<00:04:47.430> bit

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:47.610 
inside I sort of drift out a little bit

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:49.730 
inside I sort of drift out a little bit
I'm<00:04:47.729> not<00:04:47.850> hugging<00:04:48.120> the<00:04:48.419> apics<00:04:48.870> but<00:04:49.289> I<00:04:49.320> do<00:04:49.500> touch

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:49.740 
I'm not hugging the apics but I do touch

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:51.529 
I'm not hugging the apics but I do touch

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:52.969 
de pics deal which is good you can see
I'm<00:04:51.660> checking<00:04:51.960> around<00:04:52.169> as<00:04:52.440> much<00:04:52.590> as<00:04:52.770> possible

00:04:52.969 --> 00:04:52.979 
I'm checking around as much as possible

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:55.279 
I'm checking around as much as possible
to<00:04:53.370> make<00:04:53.520> sure<00:04:53.789> the<00:04:54.240> will<00:04:54.479> isn't<00:04:54.720> trying<00:04:55.110> to<00:04:55.169> go

00:04:55.279 --> 00:04:55.289 
to make sure the will isn't trying to go

00:04:55.289 --> 00:04:56.930 
to make sure the will isn't trying to go
down<00:04:55.320> my<00:04:55.620> entire<00:04:55.650> because<00:04:56.250> that<00:04:56.669> was<00:04:56.789> one

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:56.940 
down my entire because that was one

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:58.310 
down my entire because that was one
thing<00:04:57.120> I<00:04:57.240> was<00:04:57.270> petrified<00:04:57.810> about<00:04:57.870> is<00:04:58.199> just

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.320 
thing I was petrified about is just

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:59.600 
thing I was petrified about is just
turning<00:04:58.680> into<00:04:59.039> the<00:04:59.160> corner<00:04:59.430> and<00:04:59.460> then

00:04:59.600 --> 00:04:59.610 
turning into the corner and then

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:01.460 
turning into the corner and then
realizing<00:04:59.940> him<00:05:00.120> he's<00:05:00.509> there<00:05:00.810> because<00:05:01.259> that's

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:01.470 
realizing him he's there because that's

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:03.170 
realizing him he's there because that's
what<00:05:01.650> I'm<00:05:01.770> like<00:05:01.949> I<00:05:01.979> really<00:05:02.610> don't<00:05:02.820> want<00:05:03.000> to<00:05:03.060> be

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:03.180

can see there i'm checking behind

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:23.839 
can see there i'm checking behind

space there and letting us go through

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:33.110 
space there and letting us go through

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:54.050 
the first race and that was really hard

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:56.629 
the first race and that was really hard
because<00:05:55.050> in<00:05:55.289> this<00:05:55.409> race<00:05:55.620> it<00:05:56.039> wasn't<00:05:56.490> raining

00:05:56.629 --> 00:05:56.639 
because in this race it wasn't raining

00:05:56.639 --> 00:05:58.520 
because in this race it wasn't raining
really<00:05:57.060> that<00:05:57.449> much<00:05:57.690> there<00:05:57.960> was<00:05:58.050> a<00:05:58.139> little<00:05:58.409> bit

00:05:58.520 --> 00:05:58.530 
really that much there was a little bit

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:00.110 
really that much there was a little bit
of<00:05:58.650> rain<00:05:58.800> from<00:05:58.979> time<00:05:59.220> to<00:05:59.370> time<00:05:59.400> but<00:05:59.580> the<00:05:59.880> first

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:00.120 
of rain from time to time but the first

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:01.909 
of rain from time to time but the first
race<00:06:00.389> it<00:06:00.509> was<00:06:00.630> actually<00:06:00.990> raining<00:06:01.259> throughout

00:06:01.909 --> 00:06:01.919 
race it was actually raining throughout

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:03.170 
race it was actually raining throughout
the<00:06:02.099> whole<00:06:02.280> race<00:06:02.520> and<00:06:02.759> that<00:06:02.789> was<00:06:03.030> the

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:03.180 
the whole race and that was the

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:05.360 
the whole race and that was the
trickiest<00:06:03.539> race<00:06:03.780> by<00:06:03.960> for<00:06:04.199> a<00:06:04.440> second<00:06:05.009> race<00:06:05.130> was

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:05.370 
trickiest race by for a second race was

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:07.790 
trickiest race by for a second race was
probably<00:06:05.729> the<00:06:05.849> easiest<00:06:06.240> by<00:06:06.539> far<00:06:06.810> which<00:06:07.320> one<00:06:07.560> I

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:07.800 
probably the easiest by far which one I

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:11.749 
probably the easiest by far which one I
lost<00:06:08.159> and<00:06:09.110> yeah<00:06:10.110> so<00:06:10.349> bit<00:06:11.070> unfortunate<00:06:11.610> but<00:06:11.669> we

00:06:11.749 --> 00:06:11.759 
lost and yeah so bit unfortunate but we

00:06:11.759 --> 00:06:13.040 
lost and yeah so bit unfortunate but we
