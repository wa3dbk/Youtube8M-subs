00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.560 
little thing we'll see how it goes it
looks<00:01:41.100> like<00:01:41.189> Nikon's<00:01:41.640> doing<00:01:41.909> it<00:01:42.000> right<00:01:42.180> if<00:01:42.420> I

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
looks like Nikon's doing it right if I

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.179 
looks like Nikon's doing it right if I
read<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:42.930> specs<00:01:43.229> correctly<00:01:43.680> it<00:01:43.799> looks<00:01:43.979> like

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
read the specs correctly it looks like

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.149 
read the specs correctly it looks like
you<00:01:45.000> can<00:01:45.180> take<00:01:45.360> it<00:01:45.630> a<00:01:45.689> little<00:01:46.259> mix<00:01:46.500> HDR<00:01:47.009> with

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
you can take it a little mix HDR with

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.719 
you can take it a little mix HDR with
two<00:01:47.399> images<00:01:48.180> with<00:01:48.810> a<00:01:48.840> three-stop<00:01:49.729> variation

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
two images with a three-stop variation

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.789 
two images with a three-stop variation
so<00:01:50.939> if<00:01:51.060> you<00:01:51.149> take<00:01:51.360> for<00:01:51.960> instance<00:01:52.049> a<00:01:52.470> half<00:01:52.649> a

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
so if you take for instance a half a

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.950 
so if you take for instance a half a
stop<00:01:53.070> over<00:01:53.310> exposed<00:01:53.939> to<00:01:54.149> get<00:01:54.299> your<00:01:54.479> highlights

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
stop over exposed to get your highlights

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.590 
stop over exposed to get your highlights
proper<00:01:55.409> and<00:01:55.560> then<00:01:56.070> it'll<00:01:56.310> shoot<00:01:56.640> then<00:01:57.180> three

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
proper and then it'll shoot then three

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.359 
proper and then it'll shoot then three
stops<00:01:57.930> below<00:01:58.320> that<00:01:58.500> to<00:01:58.740> blend<00:01:58.979> them<00:01:59.130> for<00:01:59.280> an

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
stops below that to blend them for an

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.600 
stops below that to blend them for an
HDR<00:01:59.700> pretty<00:02:00.450> cool<00:02:01.070> some<00:02:02.070> of<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.219> other<00:02:02.369> things

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
HDR pretty cool some of the other things

night<00:02:03.030> vision<00:02:03.509> I<00:02:03.659> don't<00:02:04.079> know<00:02:04.200> if<00:02:04.350> this<00:02:04.530> is

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
night vision I don't know if this is

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.459 
night vision I don't know if this is
going<00:02:04.799> to<00:02:04.890> be<00:02:04.979> just<00:02:05.219> the<00:02:05.399> same<00:02:05.430> as<00:02:06.170> taking<00:02:07.170> your

going to be just the same as taking your

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.529 
going to be just the same as taking your
d7000<00:02:08.369> and<00:02:08.520> shooting<00:02:08.789> it<00:02:08.910> in<00:02:09.000> black<00:02:09.149> and<00:02:09.390> white

d7000 and shooting it in black and white
I<00:02:09.810> don't<00:02:10.649> know<00:02:10.709> but<00:02:11.430> it<00:02:11.760> looks<00:02:11.879> interesting

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
I don't know but it looks interesting

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.949 
I don't know but it looks interesting
nikon's<00:02:13.680> obviously<00:02:14.370> put<00:02:14.670> it<00:02:14.760> in<00:02:14.999> whether<00:02:15.719> it's

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
nikon's obviously put it in whether it's

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:17.629 
nikon's obviously put it in whether it's
actually<00:02:16.379> a<00:02:16.409> true<00:02:16.769> feature<00:02:17.099> that's<00:02:17.340> going<00:02:17.579> to

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:17.639 
actually a true feature that's going to

00:02:17.639 --> 00:02:20.660 
actually a true feature that's going to
excel<00:02:18.209> past<00:02:18.569> for<00:02:19.079> instance<00:02:19.349> taken<00:02:19.799> the<00:02:19.889> d7000

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
excel past for instance taken the d7000

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:21.610 
excel past for instance taken the d7000
and<00:02:20.790> shooting<00:02:20.999> it<00:02:21.060> in<00:02:21.120> black<00:02:21.239> and<00:02:21.450> white

and shooting it in black and white

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.599 
and shooting it in black and white
remains<00:02:22.620> to<00:02:22.829> be<00:02:22.859> seen<00:02:23.099> it'll<00:02:23.340> be<00:02:23.400> interesting

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:23.609 
remains to be seen it'll be interesting

00:02:23.609 --> 00:02:26.239 
remains to be seen it'll be interesting
to<00:02:23.819> see<00:02:23.909> if<00:02:24.180> that<00:02:24.329> is<00:02:24.569> indeed<00:02:24.780> the<00:02:24.989> case<00:02:25.249> a

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:26.249 
to see if that is indeed the case a

00:02:26.249 --> 00:02:28.489 
to see if that is indeed the case a
couple<00:02:27.239> other<00:02:27.450> things<00:02:27.540> are<00:02:28.019> some<00:02:28.200> more<00:02:28.349> in

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:28.499 
couple other things are some more in

00:02:28.499 --> 00:02:32.690 
couple other things are some more in
camera<00:02:28.680> filters<00:02:29.340> and<00:02:29.780> the<00:02:30.799> camera<00:02:31.799> just<00:02:32.340> looks

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
camera filters and the camera just looks

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.599 
camera filters and the camera just looks
really<00:02:33.209> cool<00:02:33.689> overall<00:02:34.379> size<00:02:34.799> and<00:02:35.159> weight<00:02:35.370> wise

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:35.609 
really cool overall size and weight wise

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:39.530 
really cool overall size and weight wise
and<00:02:36.170> it<00:02:37.170> has<00:02:37.290> this<00:02:37.500> miniature<00:02:38.069> effect<00:02:38.579> in<00:02:39.329> it

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
and it has this miniature effect in it

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.270 
and it has this miniature effect in it
that's<00:02:39.780> kind<00:02:39.989> of<00:02:40.079> neat<00:02:40.349> the<00:02:40.530> panasonics<00:02:41.159> have

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
that's kind of neat the panasonics have

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.649 
that's kind of neat the panasonics have
had<00:02:41.400> that<00:02:41.549> for<00:02:41.790> a<00:02:41.819> bit<00:02:42.000> so<00:02:42.030> it<00:02:42.239> allows<00:02:42.389> you<00:02:42.540> to

00:02:42.649 --> 00:02:42.659 
had that for a bit so it allows you to

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:43.789 
had that for a bit so it allows you to
shoot<00:02:42.840> something<00:02:43.109> make<00:02:43.560> it<00:02:43.680> look

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:43.799 
shoot something make it look

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:45.619 
shoot something make it look
miniaturized<00:02:44.249> kind<00:02:45.090> of<00:02:45.150> cool<00:02:45.299> if<00:02:45.419> you<00:02:45.510> do

00:02:45.619 --> 00:02:45.629 
miniaturized kind of cool if you do

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:47.449 
miniaturized kind of cool if you do
stuff<00:02:45.870> like<00:02:45.959> Lego<00:02:46.500> reenactments<00:02:47.340> or

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
stuff like Lego reenactments or

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.280 
stuff like Lego reenactments or
something<00:02:47.700> like<00:02:47.819> that<00:02:47.879> so<00:02:48.359> anyways<00:02:48.750> some

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
something like that so anyways some

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.559 
something like that so anyways some
really<00:02:49.680> neat<00:02:49.859> features<00:02:50.340> there<00:02:50.609> it's<00:02:51.090> got<00:02:51.389> the

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:51.569 
really neat features there it's got the

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:54.679 
really neat features there it's got the
really<00:02:51.900> good<00:02:52.250> LCD<00:02:53.250> so<00:02:53.699> I<00:02:53.730> believe<00:02:54.329> that's<00:02:54.510> an

00:02:54.679 --> 00:02:54.689 
really good LCD so I believe that's an

00:02:54.689 --> 00:02:56.539 
really good LCD so I believe that's an
upgrade<00:02:55.019> from<00:02:55.169> the<00:02:55.349> d5000<00:02:56.129> because<00:02:56.280> we<00:02:56.400> have

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:56.549 
upgrade from the d5000 because we have

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:59.659 
upgrade from the d5000 because we have
the<00:02:56.669> 921<00:02:57.510> thousand<00:02:58.049> pixel<00:02:58.650> LCD<00:02:59.219> now<00:02:59.400> as<00:02:59.639> a

00:02:59.659 --> 00:02:59.669 
the 921 thousand pixel LCD now as a

00:02:59.669 --> 00:03:02.420 
the 921 thousand pixel LCD now as a
vari-angle<00:03:00.090> LCD<00:03:00.180> so<00:03:00.959> two<00:03:01.560> thumbs<00:03:01.829> up<00:03:01.949> to<00:03:02.099> nikon

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
vari-angle LCD so two thumbs up to nikon

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:03.949 
vari-angle LCD so two thumbs up to nikon
for<00:03:02.639> doing<00:03:02.849> that<00:03:02.969> because<00:03:03.180> i<00:03:03.329> hated<00:03:03.719> the<00:03:03.840> low

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
for doing that because i hated the low

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:05.720 
for doing that because i hated the low
resolution<00:03:04.560> monitor<00:03:04.980> i'm<00:03:05.069> so<00:03:05.250> used<00:03:05.459> to<00:03:05.609> the

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
resolution monitor i'm so used to the

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.149 
resolution monitor i'm so used to the
good<00:03:06.120> resolution<00:03:06.629> monitors<00:03:06.949> and<00:03:07.949> the<00:03:08.040> other

00:03:08.149 --> 00:03:08.159 
good resolution monitors and the other

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:09.709 
good resolution monitors and the other
thing<00:03:08.219> I'm<00:03:08.489> really<00:03:08.669> interested<00:03:08.969> to<00:03:09.209> see<00:03:09.480> with

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:09.719 
thing I'm really interested to see with

00:03:09.719 --> 00:03:12.530 
thing I'm really interested to see with
the<00:03:09.930> D<00:03:10.079> 5100<00:03:10.620> is<00:03:11.040> if<00:03:11.609> they've<00:03:11.819> been<00:03:11.969> proved<00:03:12.299> on

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
the D 5100 is if they've been proved on

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.039 
the D 5100 is if they've been proved on
the<00:03:13.290> live<00:03:13.620> auto<00:03:14.010> focus<00:03:14.669> for<00:03:15.060> video<00:03:15.480> I<00:03:15.719> think

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:16.049 
the live auto focus for video I think

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:18.789 
the live auto focus for video I think
Nikon<00:03:16.349> calls<00:03:16.590> that<00:03:16.769> AF<00:03:17.129> f<00:03:17.340> if<00:03:18.030> memory<00:03:18.479> serves

00:03:18.789 --> 00:03:18.799 
Nikon calls that AF f if memory serves

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:22.429 
Nikon calls that AF f if memory serves
so<00:03:19.799> basically<00:03:20.250> live<00:03:21.060> auto<00:03:21.569> focus<00:03:22.139> during

00:03:22.429 --> 00:03:22.439 
so basically live auto focus during

00:03:22.439 --> 00:03:24.679 
so basically live auto focus during
video<00:03:22.769> has<00:03:23.220> Nikon<00:03:23.609> perfected<00:03:24.239> this<00:03:24.359> because

00:03:24.679 --> 00:03:24.689 
video has Nikon perfected this because

00:03:24.689 --> 00:03:27.050 
video has Nikon perfected this because
it<00:03:24.810> stinks<00:03:25.139> on<00:03:25.379> the<00:03:25.470> d<00:03:25.620> 3100<00:03:26.069> and<00:03:26.459> it<00:03:26.579> stinks<00:03:26.879> on

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
it stinks on the d 3100 and it stinks on

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.289 
it stinks on the d 3100 and it stinks on
the<00:03:27.150> 7000<00:03:27.900> barely<00:03:28.530> usable<00:03:28.919> for<00:03:29.609> me<00:03:29.759> it's<00:03:30.030> not

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 
the 7000 barely usable for me it's not

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:32.990 
the 7000 barely usable for me it's not
even<00:03:30.449> usable<00:03:31.139> so<00:03:31.620> anyways<00:03:31.979> I'm<00:03:32.159> curious<00:03:32.790> to

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000
