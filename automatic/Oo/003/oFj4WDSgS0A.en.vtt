00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.560 
is I'm actually soaking all of these and
it<00:00:36.989> depends<00:00:37.559> on<00:00:37.680> how<00:00:38.040> dry<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:39.000> dried<00:00:39.239> fruit

it depends on how dry the dried fruit
actually<00:00:39.989> is<00:00:40.140> -<00:00:40.320> how<00:00:40.530> long<00:00:40.860> you<00:00:41.129> actually<00:00:41.579> soak

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
actually is - how long you actually soak

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.549 
actually is - how long you actually soak
it<00:00:42.030> for<00:00:42.059> so<00:00:42.690> what<00:00:42.870> I'm<00:00:42.960> doing<00:00:42.989> is<00:00:43.230> I'm<00:00:43.320> just
