PlayStation or nothing but the ones that
are<00:01:59.180> just<00:01:59.210> white<00:01:59.860> most<00:02:00.860> likely<00:02:01.250> aren't<00:02:01.430> gonna

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
are just white most likely aren't gonna

are just white most likely aren't gonna
work<00:02:01.880> that<00:02:02.180> good<00:02:02.450> and<00:02:02.840> that<00:02:03.799> means<00:02:04.040> that<00:02:04.369> the

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 
work that good and that means that the

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:08.080 
work that good and that means that the
graph<00:02:05.360> is<00:02:05.509> probably<00:02:05.900> suck<00:02:06.189> doesn't<00:02:07.189> load<00:02:07.430> half

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
graph is probably suck doesn't load half

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.780 
graph is probably suck doesn't load half
the<00:02:08.239> time<00:02:08.500> so<00:02:09.500> if<00:02:09.799> it's<00:02:10.009> yellow<00:02:10.250> that<00:02:10.640> means

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:10.790 
the time so if it's yellow that means

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:12.280 
the time so if it's yellow that means
just<00:02:10.880> it's<00:02:11.299> pretty<00:02:11.510> good<00:02:11.780> but<00:02:11.959> if<00:02:12.080> it's

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
just it's pretty good but if it's

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:19.750 
just it's pretty good but if it's
anything<00:02:13.660> or<00:02:14.660> just<00:02:14.690> playing<00:02:15.260> white<00:02:17.079> so<00:02:18.760> they
