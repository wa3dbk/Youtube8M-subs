want<00:03:09.530> our<00:03:09.890> SH<00:03:10.090> sit<00:03:11.090> like<00:03:11.330> that<00:03:12.850> the<00:03:13.850> next<00:03:14.150> thing

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:14.300 
want our SH sit like that the next thing

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.449 
want our SH sit like that the next thing
that's<00:03:14.450> important<00:03:15.019> to<00:03:15.170> do<00:03:15.320> which<00:03:15.830> everyone

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
that's important to do which everyone

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:19.050 
that's important to do which everyone
forgets<00:03:16.850> and<00:03:17.060> I've<00:03:17.150> done<00:03:17.360> myself<00:03:17.540> is<00:03:18.050> that

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
forgets and I've done myself is that

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.430 
forgets and I've done myself is that
remembered<00:03:20.060> to<00:03:20.209> feed<00:03:20.450> the<00:03:20.690> seatbelt<00:03:21.140> through

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
remembered to feed the seatbelt through

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:27.930 
remembered to feed the seatbelt through
before<00:03:21.769> you<00:03:22.010> put<00:03:22.340> it<00:03:22.459> onto<00:03:22.850> the<00:03:22.970> character

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.250 

like<00:03:28.940> so

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.369 

so<00:03:31.800> now<00:03:31.950> you<00:03:32.010> have<00:03:32.280> the<00:03:32.459> seatbelt<00:03:33.080> fed<00:03:34.080> through

00:03:34.369 --> 00:03:34.379 
so now you have the seatbelt fed through

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:36.530 
so now you have the seatbelt fed through
the<00:03:34.560> triangle<00:03:34.980> and<00:03:35.250> the<00:03:35.700> triangle<00:03:35.940> be<00:03:36.299> ready

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
the triangle and the triangle be ready

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.500 
the triangle and the triangle be ready
to<00:03:36.750> pop<00:03:36.959> on<00:03:37.140> to<00:03:37.290> the<00:03:37.379> car<00:03:38.030> you'll<00:03:39.030> notice<00:03:39.360> on

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
to pop on to the car you'll notice on

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.000 
to pop on to the car you'll notice on
the<00:03:39.599> bottom<00:03:39.720> of<00:03:39.989> the<00:03:40.049> triangle<00:03:40.500> that<00:03:40.530> you<00:03:40.709> have

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
the bottom of the triangle that you have

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.670 
the bottom of the triangle that you have
two<00:03:41.310> little<00:03:41.549> pop<00:03:41.879> tension<00:03:42.390> clips<00:03:42.629> and<00:03:42.930> then

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
two little pop tension clips and then

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.280 
two little pop tension clips and then
you've<00:03:43.860> got<00:03:44.069> a<00:03:44.099> large<00:03:44.370> hole<00:03:44.580> in<00:03:44.610> the<00:03:44.760> base

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.290 
you've got a large hole in the base

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:49.250 
you've got a large hole in the base
you're<00:03:46.290> gonna<00:03:46.470> take<00:03:46.769> that<00:03:47.690> and<00:03:48.690> you'll<00:03:48.930> feed

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
you're gonna take that and you'll feed

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.770 
you're gonna take that and you'll feed
the<00:03:49.470> one<00:03:49.620> side<00:03:49.950> through<00:03:50.370> and<00:03:50.610> you<00:03:50.910> can<00:03:51.060> turn<00:03:51.599> it

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
the one side through and you can turn it

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.869 
the one side through and you can turn it
a<00:03:51.930> lot<00:03:52.140> of<00:03:52.260> guys<00:03:52.410> will<00:03:52.620> turn<00:03:52.860> it<00:03:53.010> sideways<00:03:53.310> and

00:03:53.869 --> 00:03:53.879 
a lot of guys will turn it sideways and

00:03:53.879 --> 00:04:00.890 
a lot of guys will turn it sideways and
then<00:03:54.629> twist<00:03:54.989> it<00:03:55.170> in<00:03:57.980> and<00:03:59.420> what<00:04:00.420> that<00:04:00.629> does<00:04:00.870> you

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
then twist it in and what that does you

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.020 
then twist it in and what that does you
see<00:04:01.260> how<00:04:01.409> one<00:04:01.650> side<00:04:01.920> popped<00:04:02.250> in<00:04:02.489> but<00:04:02.700> not<00:04:02.879> the

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
see how one side popped in but not the

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.270 
see how one side popped in but not the
other<00:04:03.239> that<00:04:03.930> will<00:04:04.170> help<00:04:04.319> to<00:04:04.560> make<00:04:04.739> it<00:04:04.769> go<00:04:05.099> in

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
other that will help to make it go in

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:11.420 
other that will help to make it go in
securely<00:04:06.180> on<00:04:06.569> both<00:04:06.780> sides<00:04:08.810> like<00:04:09.810> so<00:04:10.220> now<00:04:11.220> as<00:04:11.400> we

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
securely on both sides like so now as we

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.220 
securely on both sides like so now as we
tighten<00:04:11.819> it<00:04:12.030> down<00:04:12.060> it'll<00:04:12.510> draw<00:04:12.840> it<00:04:12.900> even

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
tighten it down it'll draw it even

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.800 
tighten it down it'll draw it even
tighter<00:04:14.030> so<00:04:15.030> now<00:04:15.180> you're<00:04:15.299> going<00:04:15.420> to<00:04:15.510> take<00:04:15.599> your

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
tighter so now you're going to take your

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:19.729 
tighter so now you're going to take your
screwdriver<00:04:16.370> and<00:04:17.810> you're<00:04:18.810> gonna<00:04:18.930> insert<00:04:19.440> this

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
screwdriver and you're gonna insert this

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:22.909 
screwdriver and you're gonna insert this
small<00:04:20.459> chrome<00:04:21.239> screw<00:04:21.630> into<00:04:22.019> that<00:04:22.350> top<00:04:22.650> hole

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919 
small chrome screw into that top hole

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:29.840 
small chrome screw into that top hole
there<00:04:27.139> now<00:04:28.139> you<00:04:28.620> run<00:04:28.830> this<00:04:29.039> screw<00:04:29.370> in<00:04:29.580> and

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:29.850 
there now you run this screw in and

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:31.580 
there now you run this screw in and
you're<00:04:30.449> going<00:04:30.570> to<00:04:30.660> tighten<00:04:30.930> it<00:04:31.169> down<00:04:31.199> all<00:04:31.560> the

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
you're going to tighten it down all the

you're going to tighten it down all the
way<00:04:31.740> and<00:04:32.520> what<00:04:32.669> it'll<00:04:32.820> do<00:04:33.150> is<00:04:33.389> it's<00:04:33.840> gonna<00:04:34.020> draw

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:34.380 
way and what it'll do is it's gonna draw

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:37.820 
way and what it'll do is it's gonna draw
that<00:04:34.410> triangle<00:04:35.070> down<00:04:35.460> flush<00:04:36.380> they<00:04:37.380> do<00:04:37.440> make<00:04:37.800> a

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 
that triangle down flush they do make a

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:40.040 
that triangle down flush they do make a
reproduction<00:04:38.520> triangle<00:04:39.210> currently<00:04:39.720> on<00:04:39.900> the

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
reproduction triangle currently on the

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:42.529 
reproduction triangle currently on the
market<00:04:40.470> that<00:04:40.620> comes<00:04:40.860> molded<00:04:41.430> in<00:04:41.580> color<00:04:41.880> but<00:04:42.419> it

market that comes molded in color but it

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:43.969 
market that comes molded in color but it
doesn't<00:04:42.930> use<00:04:43.080> that<00:04:43.110> set<00:04:43.590> screw

00:04:43.969 --> 00:04:43.979 
doesn't use that set screw

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:46.820 
doesn't use that set screw
we've<00:04:44.910> always<00:04:45.150> learned<00:04:45.570> that<00:04:45.810> GM<00:04:46.200> use<00:04:46.410> a<00:04:46.440> set

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:46.830 
we've always learned that GM use a set

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:48.770 
we've always learned that GM use a set
screw<00:04:47.099> some<00:04:47.430> guys<00:04:47.669> say<00:04:47.940> and<00:04:48.150> not<00:04:48.570> all

screw some guys say and not all

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:51.469 
screw some guys say and not all
instances<00:04:49.260> they<00:04:49.710> did<00:04:49.950> I've<00:04:50.820> always<00:04:51.210> seen<00:04:51.450> it

00:04:51.469 --> 00:04:51.479 
instances they did I've always seen it

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:53.210 
instances they did I've always seen it
with<00:04:51.750> the<00:04:51.780> set<00:04:52.110> screw<00:04:52.470> here<00:04:52.770> that<00:04:53.010> little

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:53.220 
with the set screw here that little

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:55.580 
with the set screw here that little
accent<00:04:53.789> screw<00:04:54.180> and<00:04:54.419> on<00:04:54.539> earlier<00:04:54.960> models<00:04:55.410> this

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:55.590 
accent screw and on earlier models this

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:58.219 
accent screw and on earlier models this
was<00:04:55.830> a<00:04:55.860> plastic<00:04:56.490> clip<00:04:56.789> and<00:04:57.090> that's<00:04:57.750> why<00:04:57.990> we

00:04:58.219 --> 00:04:58.229 
was a plastic clip and that's why we
