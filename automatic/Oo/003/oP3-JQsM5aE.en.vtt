00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.420
 I'll show you today a foreword and 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.849
 You can knit a full patent 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.880
 pattern with envelopes so with the 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:14.519
 envelope technique I have, of course 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.440
 already a video we turned on 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.199
 volk patent must be deeper 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:22.980
 I can knit stitched stitches 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:25.769
 just make an even number 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.170
 measures the first series is one 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:32.579
 Preparation series in the knitting dir 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:35.730
 A border stitch makes an envelope 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:39.329
 that means he puts the thread over in front 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:43.430
 the needle over it and loads live there 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:47.930
 the next stitch just left off 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:52.610
 the next stitch right now 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:56.239
 I pulled an envelope 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:01:02.940
 Take off the rides to lift off the crowd 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:07.320
 then a right knit then envelope 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:11.479
 to knit the mass out and knit it right 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.479
 the whole series 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:26.940
 and the edge mesh strict right in the 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:32.500
 next row 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:36.190
 it is the pattern wealth of the 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:39.310
 pattern row looks like we have one 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:43.930
 mesh pretty strict then here is one 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:47.500
 single left mesh the left mesh 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:51.400
 that made an envelope lift again 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:54.790
 Next off and then he lies his 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:57.340
 mesh with an envelope over it and that 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:02:03.910
 is a double stitch and knitted 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:09.300
 on the right you can see the left one 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:13.959
 envelope from the next strict right 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:16.840
 that means turning off the envelope and 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:19.230
 knit right and that is actually 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:22.750
 the whole magic 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:29.519
 I'll show it to you again 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:34.269
 end of the round is still a quick one 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:37.780
 and also in the next round 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:39.150
 and each further round stretched one 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:42.760
 pretty mesh 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:45.480
 there is a single left that look 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:48.790
 you in which this was lying across there 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:51.519
 you lift off the left with one 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:56.019
 envelope before and this double stitch 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:58.900
 Strict right off so again envelope 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:03:02.440
 lift the left left and the right 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:06.130
 stretch right and that it really is 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:09.400
 there had to be a whole people's patent 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:12.280
 absolutely no difference to the patent 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:14.709
 pattern with lower stitched stitches 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:17.880
 i knit a few up and one now 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:20.300
 show you what it looks like 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:23.160
 the people patents of course on both 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:25.290
 are the same and here I have one 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.180
 strictly test where I had got the patent 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.970
 with the lower stitched stitches 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:32.040
 knitted it looks the same only 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.240
 I have beautiful sex here 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.700
 the only difference there is 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:37.890
 Of course also edge stitches for patent 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:41.340
 but he does not see that on the edge 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:43.860
 so from the video you can find here 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:47.880
 and of course there are innumerable 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:52.050
 more patent had and the link 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:54.240
 I also hope you in the infobox 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:58.640
 the instructions helped you and me 

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:58.640
 wish you a perfect day
