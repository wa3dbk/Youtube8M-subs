00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
present in every spider-man figure I

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.030 
present in every spider-man figure I
think<00:02:55.540> except<00:02:56.540> the<00:02:56.630> black<00:02:56.840> one<00:02:57.080> I<00:02:57.769> don't<00:02:57.830> know

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
think except the black one I don't know

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.250 
think except the black one I don't know
but<00:02:58.280> in<00:02:58.400> almost<00:02:58.730> all<00:02:58.970> the<00:02:59.510> spider-man<00:02:59.840> figures

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
but in almost all the spider-man figures

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.370 
but in almost all the spider-man figures
he<00:03:00.440> always<00:03:00.769> has<00:03:01.220> that<00:03:01.489> webbing<00:03:02.000> that<00:03:02.209> web<00:03:02.480> that

he always has that webbing that web that
web<00:03:03.910> web<00:03:04.910> blast<00:03:05.239> or<00:03:05.510> whatever<00:03:05.780> I'm<00:03:06.319> not<00:03:06.500> really

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
web web blast or whatever I'm not really

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.020 
web web blast or whatever I'm not really
too<00:03:06.860> interested<00:03:07.190> in<00:03:07.280> that<00:03:07.400> it's<00:03:07.640> okay<00:03:07.970> but

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
too interested in that it's okay but

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.330 
too interested in that it's okay but
it's<00:03:08.989> kind<00:03:09.230> of<00:03:09.290> hoping<00:03:09.650> for<00:03:09.709> something<00:03:09.890> better

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
it's kind of hoping for something better

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:11.890 
it's kind of hoping for something better
maybe<00:03:10.790> they<00:03:10.970> would<00:03:11.090> have<00:03:11.120> changed<00:03:11.450> it<00:03:11.720> since

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
maybe they would have changed it since

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:16.030 
maybe they would have changed it since
it<00:03:12.110> is<00:03:12.230> series<00:03:12.709> 3<00:03:12.739> but<00:03:13.250> well<00:03:14.410> first<00:03:15.410> the<00:03:15.830> mold

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
it is series 3 but well first the mold

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.400 
it is series 3 but well first the mold
is<00:03:16.280> still<00:03:16.459> profitable<00:03:16.940> for<00:03:17.840> that<00:03:17.959> accessory

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410 
is still profitable for that accessory

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:22.449 
is still profitable for that accessory
so<00:03:19.340> very<00:03:19.880> cool<00:03:20.530> some<00:03:21.530> details<00:03:22.010> about<00:03:22.160> the

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:22.459 
so very cool some details about the

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:26.199 
so very cool some details about the
figure<00:03:22.820> the<00:03:23.540> figure<00:03:23.690> uses<00:03:24.230> the<00:03:25.040> sculpt<00:03:25.760> the

like the mold the only problem I have

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:16.110 
like the mold the only problem I have
with<00:04:14.480> its<00:04:14.660> mold<00:04:14.900> is<00:04:15.049> that<00:04:15.200> the<00:04:15.380> thigh

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:17.540 
somewhere here I think and not exactly
on<00:05:15.060> his<00:05:15.210> butt<00:05:15.450> well<00:05:15.690> maybe<00:05:16.350> he<00:05:16.950> meets<00:05:17.100> party<00:05:17.430> on
