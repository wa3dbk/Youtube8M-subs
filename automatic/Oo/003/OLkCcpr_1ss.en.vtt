or arena because now after patch 5.3
everybody<00:00:21.750> has<00:00:22.020> a<00:00:22.050> base<00:00:22.529> resilience<00:00:23.310> of<00:00:24.260> what

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
everybody has a base resilience of what

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.960 
everybody has a base resilience of what
is<00:00:25.380> it<00:00:25.529> sixty-five<00:00:26.279> percent<00:00:26.750> so<00:00:27.750> as<00:00:28.410> usual<00:00:28.970> the

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
is it sixty-five percent so as usual the

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.330 
is it sixty-five percent so as usual the
PvP<00:00:30.480> is<00:00:30.510> will<00:00:30.869> complain<00:00:31.289> and<00:00:31.560> that<00:00:31.980> they<00:00:32.099> work

PvP is will complain and that they work

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.910 
PvP is will complain and that they work
hard<00:00:32.640> for<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:32.940> gear<00:00:33.149> and<00:00:33.180> stuff<00:00:33.690> and<00:00:34.020> and<00:00:34.530> now

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
hard for the gear and stuff and and now

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.030 
hard for the gear and stuff and and now
some<00:00:35.250> Peavy<00:00:35.610> years<00:00:35.850> join<00:00:36.300> and<00:00:36.660> they<00:00:37.440> get<00:00:37.680> the

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
some Peavy years join and they get the

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.190 
some Peavy years join and they get the
exact<00:00:38.430> same<00:00:38.700> amount<00:00:38.940> of<00:00:39.360> resilience<00:00:39.870> well

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
exact same amount of resilience well

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.790 
exact same amount of resilience well
that's<00:00:40.440> true<00:00:40.770> and<00:00:41.640> but<00:00:42.300> it's<00:00:42.780> not<00:00:43.050> necessarily

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
that's true and but it's not necessarily

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.279 
that's true and but it's not necessarily
a<00:00:43.950> bad<00:00:44.219> thing<00:00:44.420> first<00:00:45.420> of<00:00:45.600> all<00:00:45.690> you<00:00:45.750> get<00:00:46.079> more

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
a bad thing first of all you get more

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.720 
a bad thing first of all you get more
opponents<00:00:46.890> to<00:00:47.039> kill<00:00:48.469> after<00:00:49.469> most<00:00:49.860> bve<00:00:50.309> players

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
opponents to kill after most bve players

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.330 
opponents to kill after most bve players
just<00:00:51.149> click<00:00:51.420> their<00:00:51.629> spells<00:00:51.930> or<00:00:52.140> turn<00:00:52.949> with<00:00:53.219> the

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
just click their spells or turn with the

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.920 
just click their spells or turn with the
keyboard<00:00:53.550> so<00:00:54.059> it<00:00:54.809> shouldn't<00:00:55.230> be<00:00:55.260> a<00:00:55.379> problem

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:56.930 
keyboard so it shouldn't be a problem

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.540 
keyboard so it shouldn't be a problem
and<00:00:57.930> if<00:00:58.050> they're<00:00:58.230> good<00:00:58.440> well<00:00:58.739> it's<00:00:59.039> just<00:00:59.190> more

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
and if they're good well it's just more

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.930 
and if they're good well it's just more
competition<00:01:00.210> so<00:01:00.449> it's<00:01:00.600> nice<00:01:00.809> but<00:01:01.640> back<00:01:02.640> to<00:01:02.670> the

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
competition so it's nice but back to the

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.890 
competition so it's nice but back to the
gear<00:01:03.409> people<00:01:04.409> with<00:01:04.530> PVE<00:01:04.949> gear<00:01:05.479> don't<00:01:06.479> have<00:01:06.720> the

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
gear people with PVE gear don't have the

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.010 
gear people with PVE gear don't have the
benefits<00:01:07.350> people<00:01:08.040> would<00:01:08.280> be<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.610> e<00:01:08.640> or<00:01:09.479> PvP

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
benefits people would be the e or PvP

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.710 
benefits people would be the e or PvP
gear<00:01:10.350> have<00:01:10.650> and<00:01:11.070> if<00:01:12.000> you're<00:01:12.210> at<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.390> patch

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
gear have and if you're at the patch

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.560 
gear have and if you're at the patch
notes<00:01:13.310> you<00:01:14.310> can<00:01:14.460> see<00:01:14.640> that<00:01:14.670> all<00:01:15.270> the

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
notes you can see that all the

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.140 
notes you can see that all the
resilience<00:01:16.080> only<00:01:16.500> pvp<00:01:17.100> gear<00:01:17.520> has<00:01:17.790> been

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
resilience only pvp gear has been

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.740 
resilience only pvp gear has been
replaced<00:01:18.540> by<00:01:18.720> PDP<00:01:19.530> power<00:01:19.950> so<00:01:20.880> only<00:01:21.210> people

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
replaced by PDP power so only people

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.820 
replaced by PDP power so only people
with<00:01:21.810> pvp<00:01:22.259> power<00:01:22.650> or<00:01:23.280> a<00:01:23.340> PP<00:01:24.030> Jeremy<00:01:24.540> happy<00:01:25.380> p

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
with pvp power or a PP Jeremy happy p

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.670 
with pvp power or a PP Jeremy happy p
power<00:01:26.189> and<00:01:26.880> that<00:01:27.659> makes<00:01:27.930> a<00:01:28.200> big<00:01:28.650> difference

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
power and that makes a big difference

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:34.310 
power and that makes a big difference
between<00:01:29.689> PVE<00:01:30.689> gear<00:01:30.840> people<00:01:31.619> and<00:01:31.829> pvp<00:01:32.430> gear<00:01:33.320> so

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
between PVE gear people and pvp gear so

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.710 
between PVE gear people and pvp gear so
let's<00:01:34.650> have<00:01:34.799> a<00:01:34.890> look<00:01:35.070> at<00:01:35.159> my<00:01:36.060> gear<00:01:37.040> let's<00:01:38.040> see

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:38.720 
let's have a look at my gear let's see

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.690 
let's have a look at my gear let's see
you<00:01:39.720> can<00:01:39.930> see<00:01:40.140> it's<00:01:40.350> all<00:01:40.500> tyrannical<00:01:41.070> I<00:01:41.310> jumped

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
you can see it's all tyrannical I jumped

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:49.499 
you can see it's all tyrannical I jumped
it<00:01:42.170> and<00:01:43.220> all<00:01:44.220> pieces<00:01:44.549> have<00:01:45.030> PPP<00:01:45.840> power

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:49.509 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:52.569 

well<00:01:50.509> it's<00:01:50.719> a<00:01:50.929> quite<00:01:51.200> self-explanatory<00:01:51.649> you

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:52.579 
well it's a quite self-explanatory you

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:54.249 
well it's a quite self-explanatory you
just<00:01:53.149> check<00:01:53.390> your<00:01:53.539> gear<00:01:53.719> if<00:01:53.990> it<00:01:54.140> has

00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:54.259 
just check your gear if it has

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:56.679 
just check your gear if it has
resilience<00:01:54.829> after<00:01:55.280> patch<00:01:55.490> it<00:01:55.789> will<00:01:56.030> be<00:01:56.179> P<00:01:56.390> P

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:56.689 
resilience after patch it will be P P

00:01:56.689 --> 00:01:59.800 
resilience after patch it will be P P
power<00:01:57.039> what<00:01:58.039> this<00:01:58.219> allows<00:01:58.520> is<00:01:58.909> that<00:01:59.090> in<00:01:59.240> PvP

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
power what this allows is that in PvP

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.340 
power what this allows is that in PvP
instances<00:02:00.560> Sao<00:02:00.920> Paulo<00:02:01.280> grounds<00:02:01.789> and<00:02:01.939> arena<00:02:02.420> to

instances Sao Paulo grounds and arena to
get<00:02:03.649> more<00:02:06.880> damage<00:02:07.959> this<00:02:08.959> is<00:02:09.140> thirty<00:02:09.830> five

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:10.129 
get more damage this is thirty five

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:11.890 
get more damage this is thirty five
point<00:02:10.489> eight<00:02:10.700> percent<00:02:11.150> more<00:02:11.420> damage<00:02:11.810> so

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
point eight percent more damage so

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.930 
point eight percent more damage so
pretty<00:02:12.170> with<00:02:12.319> thirty<00:02:12.799> six<00:02:13.129> percent<00:02:13.190> more

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
pretty with thirty six percent more

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.650 
pretty with thirty six percent more
damage<00:02:14.569> even<00:02:14.959> without<00:02:15.080> jamming<00:02:15.650> in<00:02:15.860> people

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
damage even without jamming in people

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.690 
damage even without jamming in people
opposed<00:02:17.660> to<00:02:17.870> people<00:02:18.049> with<00:02:18.379> PVE<00:02:18.860> gear<00:02:19.040> that

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
opposed to people with PVE gear that

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:25.780 
opposed to people with PVE gear that
will<00:02:19.879> go<00:02:20.060> into<00:02:20.299> instances<00:02:23.560> so<00:02:24.560> that's<00:02:25.459> a<00:02:25.760> huge

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
will go into instances so that's a huge

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:31.809 
will go into instances so that's a huge
difference<00:02:26.420> so<00:02:29.440> yeah<00:02:30.440> I'm<00:02:31.040> pretty<00:02:31.310> sure<00:02:31.579> there

difference so yeah I'm pretty sure there

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:34.180 
difference so yeah I'm pretty sure there

of<00:02:56.420> any<00:02:56.599> at<00:02:56.900> the<00:02:56.930> moment<00:02:57.579> in<00:02:58.579> patch<00:02:59.030> 5.2<00:02:59.870> there

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
of any at the moment in patch 5.2 there

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.500 
of any at the moment in patch 5.2 there
were<00:03:00.319> some<00:03:00.790> trinkets<00:03:01.790> for<00:03:01.970> rogues<00:03:02.269> and

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
were some trinkets for rogues and

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.009 
were some trinkets for rogues and
hunters<00:03:02.900> with<00:03:03.310> crap<00:03:04.310> levels<00:03:04.730> of<00:03:04.849> agility<00:03:05.120> then

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:06.019 
hunters with crap levels of agility then

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:08.789 
hunters with crap levels of agility then
lifted<00:03:06.500> two<00:03:07.250> or<00:03:07.430> three<00:03:07.609> chunks<00:03:07.849> I<00:03:08.269> think

00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:08.799 
lifted two or three chunks I think

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:11.379 
lifted two or three chunks I think
interesting<00:03:09.799> that<00:03:10.190> they<00:03:10.489> have<00:03:10.639> to<00:03:10.790> do<00:03:10.940> it<00:03:11.090> is

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:11.389 
interesting that they have to do it is

00:03:11.389 --> 00:03:13.120 
interesting that they have to do it is
that<00:03:11.750> they<00:03:11.870> have<00:03:12.019> by<00:03:12.230> some<00:03:12.440> experience<00:03:12.950> with

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.130 
that they have by some experience with

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:18.759 
that they have by some experience with
it<00:03:13.310> I<00:03:13.579> think<00:03:13.880> blizzard<00:03:15.910> but<00:03:16.910> as<00:03:17.750> for<00:03:17.810> PVE<00:03:18.590> gear

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:18.769 
it I think blizzard but as for PVE gear

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:22.870 
it I think blizzard but as for PVE gear
in<00:03:19.840> battleground<00:03:20.840> or<00:03:20.989> arena<00:03:21.609> they<00:03:22.609> probably

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:22.880 
in battleground or arena they probably

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.809 
in battleground or arena they probably
don't<00:03:23.090> get<00:03:23.329> killed

00:03:24.809 --> 00:03:24.819 
don't get killed

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:30.149 
don't get killed
as<00:03:25.269> far<00:03:25.629> as<00:03:25.659> they<00:03:26.379> used<00:03:26.650> to<00:03:26.799> be<00:03:27.659> but<00:03:28.980> they<00:03:29.980> will

00:03:30.149 --> 00:03:30.159 
as far as they used to be but they will

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:32.910 
as far as they used to be but they will
do<00:03:30.340> less<00:03:30.760> damage<00:03:30.790> than<00:03:31.239> you<00:03:31.659> with<00:03:31.959> your<00:03:32.260> pvp

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
do less damage than you with your pvp

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.209 
do less damage than you with your pvp
pvp<00:03:33.849> gear<00:03:34.180> you<00:03:34.359> work<00:03:34.599> out<00:03:34.840> so<00:03:35.409> I<00:03:35.680> don't<00:03:35.980> see<00:03:36.189> it

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:36.219 
pvp gear you work out so I don't see it

00:03:36.219 --> 00:03:38.640 
pvp gear you work out so I don't see it
as<00:03:36.400> a<00:03:36.430> concern<00:03:36.969> just<00:03:37.269> see<00:03:37.450> it<00:03:37.540> is<00:03:37.689> more<00:03:38.260> people

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
as a concern just see it is more people

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.729 
as a concern just see it is more people
to<00:03:38.799> kill<00:03:38.980> and<00:03:39.670> or<00:03:40.629> there's<00:03:41.079> more<00:03:41.379> competition

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739 
to kill and or there's more competition

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:46.140 
to kill and or there's more competition
if<00:03:42.219> they're<00:03:42.430> really<00:03:42.609> skilled<00:03:43.060> but<00:03:44.730> most<00:03:45.730> pv

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
if they're really skilled but most pv

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.129 
if they're really skilled but most pv
peers<00:03:46.540> out<00:03:46.750> there<00:03:47.189> are<00:03:48.189> not<00:03:48.780> well<00:03:49.780> they<00:03:50.109> just

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:50.139 
peers out there are not well they just

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:52.979 
peers out there are not well they just
click<00:03:50.650> on<00:03:50.769> as<00:03:50.980> well<00:03:51.219> so<00:03:51.549> it<00:03:51.849> should<00:03:52.359> be<00:03:52.389> down

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:52.989 
click on as well so it should be down

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:54.750 
click on as well so it should be down
hard<00:03:53.230> to<00:03:53.349> kill<00:03:53.560> them<00:03:53.769> and<00:03:53.889> you<00:03:54.340> get<00:03:54.519> more

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
hard to kill them and you get more

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.599 
hard to kill them and you get more
damage<00:03:55.180> so<00:03:55.540> as<00:03:55.840> I<00:03:56.230> think<00:03:56.620> it's<00:03:56.829> a<00:03:57.010> quite<00:03:57.280> fair

00:03:57.599 --> 00:03:57.609 
damage so as I think it's a quite fair

00:03:57.609 --> 00:04:00.890 
damage so as I think it's a quite fair
and<00:03:57.879> a<00:03:58.120> blizzard<00:03:58.510> did<00:03:58.629> a<00:03:58.659> good<00:03:58.870> job<00:03:58.930> on<00:03:59.319> it<00:03:59.500> and

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
and a blizzard did a good job on it and

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:05.069 
and a blizzard did a good job on it and
if<00:04:01.900> there<00:04:02.200> is<00:04:02.230> any<00:04:02.530> PVE<00:04:02.949> gear<00:04:03.840> that's<00:04:04.840> all

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:05.079 
if there is any PVE gear that's all

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:07.619 
if there is any PVE gear that's all
about<00:04:05.230> they<00:04:05.739> can<00:04:05.889> even<00:04:06.010> know<00:04:06.310> it<00:04:06.519> or<00:04:06.760> they<00:04:07.329> can

00:04:07.619 --> 00:04:07.629 
about they can even know it or they can

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:10.649 
about they can even know it or they can
boost<00:04:07.840> the<00:04:08.199> pvp<00:04:08.919> gear<00:04:09.219> with<00:04:09.609> more<00:04:09.939> pvp<00:04:10.329> power

00:04:10.649 --> 00:04:10.659 
boost the pvp gear with more pvp power

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:14.610 
boost the pvp gear with more pvp power
on<00:04:11.199> it<00:04:11.379> so<00:04:11.739> in<00:04:12.400> the<00:04:12.549> end<00:04:12.579> it<00:04:12.879> will<00:04:13.090> be<00:04:13.620> more

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:14.620
