00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
the Bert's Bert's wheels it's the same

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.290 
the Bert's Bert's wheels it's the same
exact<00:00:21.420> formula<00:00:21.990> except<00:00:22.830> this<00:00:23.010> comes<00:00:23.310> in<00:00:23.519> a<00:00:23.640> 81

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
exact formula except this comes in a 81

exact formula except this comes in a 81
a<00:00:24.949> 70<00:00:25.949> millimeter<00:00:26.240> and<00:00:27.240> it's<00:00:27.390> a<00:00:27.510> completely

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
a 70 millimeter and it's a completely

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.710 
a 70 millimeter and it's a completely
side<00:00:28.289> set<00:00:28.619> like<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:29.189> efforts<00:00:29.490> which<00:00:30.210> is<00:00:30.390> I

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
side set like the efforts which is I

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.340 
side set like the efforts which is I
believe<00:00:30.750> a<00:00:31.170> da<00:00:32.149> 60<00:00:33.149> millimeter<00:00:33.570> and<00:00:33.930> Center

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
believe a da 60 millimeter and Center

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.670 
believe a da 60 millimeter and Center
set<00:00:34.590> and<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:36.000> only<00:00:36.149> thing<00:00:36.450> is<00:00:36.630> with<00:00:37.500> the

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
set and the only thing is with the

so some problems you may have with these
wheels<00:01:32.460> are<00:01:32.760> um<00:01:32.940> you're<00:01:33.390> not<00:01:33.510> committing

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:34.080 
wheels are um you're not committing

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.530 
wheels are um you're not committing
enough<00:01:34.740> and<00:01:35.040> you're<00:01:35.490> not<00:01:35.610> fully<00:01:35.850> rotating

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
enough and you're not fully rotating

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:37.910 
enough and you're not fully rotating
your<00:01:36.630> shoulders<00:01:36.690> when<00:01:37.229> you're<00:01:37.350> doing<00:01:37.619> slides

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
your shoulders when you're doing slides

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.859 
your shoulders when you're doing slides
and<00:01:39.470> also<00:01:40.470> a<00:01:40.500> speed<00:01:40.890> wobbles<00:01:41.420> due<00:01:42.420> to<00:01:42.600> a<00:01:42.630> lot

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
and also a speed wobbles due to a lot

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.040 
and also a speed wobbles due to a lot
because<00:01:43.590> I<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:43.920> contact<00:01:44.460> patch<00:01:44.640> is<00:01:45.030> wider<00:01:45.540> and

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:46.050 
because I the contact patch is wider and

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:48.530 
because I the contact patch is wider and
the<00:01:46.229> side<00:01:46.470> set<00:01:46.860> really<00:01:47.700> makes<00:01:48.150> your<00:01:48.270> truck's

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
the side set really makes your truck's

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.240 
the side set really makes your truck's
wobble<00:01:49.220> and<00:01:50.220> also<00:01:51.350> it<00:01:52.350> affects<00:01:52.650> the<00:01:52.800> concave

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
wobble and also it affects the concave

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.430 
wobble and also it affects the concave
of<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.580> board<00:01:53.820> too<00:01:54.090> if<00:01:54.690> you're<00:01:54.960> if<00:01:55.380> you're

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:55.440 
of the board too if you're if you're

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.430 
of the board too if you're if you're
very<00:01:55.740> prone<00:01:55.979> to<00:01:56.009> slipping<00:01:56.340> off<00:01:57.170> these<00:01:58.170> are<00:01:58.320> not
