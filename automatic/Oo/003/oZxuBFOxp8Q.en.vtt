 he knows she makes headlines, after all 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.950
 unfortunately 70 advised and athletic 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.540
 situation but due to two 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.700
 sensational obligations 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.849
 one stands between the posts and 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:18.539
 stop rick dipietro the other markets that 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:21.900
 song for baku front institute wise and 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.710
 They can see every gain and view 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.930
 use 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:28.170
 I lay here with goals here 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.480
 stand table 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.200
 stark counter examples know this 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.210
 landshut 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:37.860
 after three wins in a row 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:41.340
 in the meantime conquered this world and how 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:44.360
 long protests not very much 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:49.559
 that is also in this confusing 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:50.250
 situation in 1 11 not sure what 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.800
 rests 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.559
 she stands firm for the first 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.900
 place lights off white blue oneself 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.130
 targeted joke and di pietro 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:02.580
 with the good preparation 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:05.060
 against thomas brandl or call her running 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:09.000
 say it better in the initial phase 

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:11.100
 deliver and herbal topscorer was a 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.210
 Landhut is worse now 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.180
 not in the box either 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:18.090
 Timo Pielmeier very confident and also 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.100
 Towards the end of the lords 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.260
 location 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:24.960
 the problems of scs relative 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:27.720
 obviously Abstreiter does that 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:31.580
 clearly they do not bring any forward 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.580
 hits to stand and behind 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:38.870
 Team of caliber of the national league 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:42.770
 Probably exploits problems goes on there 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:45.380
 Beck 2 looks back as a hidden pietro 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:49.550
 but unhappy has none at all 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:51.650
 chance of two own lights and 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:56.150
 Roland Kaspitz obscured her face 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:58.880
 the 2 0 before the break a shocker it 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:01.340
 the relatively fast wooden block of the 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.680
 The blue line is discontinued 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:07.520
 but of lord and then is platini 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:10.610
 third of the class parade against crawley 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:15.200
 second best scorer of the 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:16.490
 landshuter but as already said the gate 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.300
 of the guests 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:22.910
 the publishers, it can be harmless and then 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:27.500
 Do you still have the pietro is you 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:30.410
 based on the safe 3 basis 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:34.690
 it covers and then a glimmer of hope 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:38.090
 Many counter to our national was so much 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.780
 on par with the metro and still receives 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:43.480
 the zero 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:43.480
 that the small but subtle difference 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.490
 and then discuss recent 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.250
 choice leaves 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:54.060
 so bad and still buys that 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:57.030
 13 o'clock peter Abstreiter after the 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.200
 break after the second break 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.190
 preliminary decision 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:05.550
 ice cold and for the positional error of 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:08.040
 those from and only the pietro with 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:11.250
 the head makes the life of the vita 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:14.340
 it remains at 13 0 reckin great opportunity 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:16.260
 the connection must be because otherwise sees 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:20.130
 you can make it for me 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:23.640
 but my putts in and there it is 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:25.950
 Hope of hope because there conspicuous 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:29.340
 Today with a lot of work in front of the box of 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:33.540
 bayer the facebook one to three 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:37.290
 and one more hour to go she says 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:40.410
 we are all in the balance but more than 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.700
 We shed one from the source 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:44.520
 they are located 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:45.609
 a strong bayer on the supports 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:48.469
 loud conclusion 

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:50.719
 Abstreiter rightly says she has that 

00:03:48.469 --> 00:03:53.239
 look if they like the one 

00:03:50.719 --> 00:03:56.749
 good team for the white-blue the 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:04:00.560
 final decision by markus 

00:03:56.749 --> 00:04:03.889
 At the end of the world there are no points again 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:06.019
 for the seats very land must have a 

00:04:03.889 --> 00:04:08.269
 quite sovereign imagination with a 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:11.739
 earned 4 to 1 principle 

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:11.739
 here 's still to agree 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:22.690
 that before these eyes 100 us all 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:24.190
 specifically on the example of absolute 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:27.669
 await your arrival 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:30.250
 therefore he was the last defeated it was 

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:32.979
 great scenery would have great atmosphere 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:34.630
 Do you really care was the spectator us 

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:37.479
 have great support in the beginning 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:41.820
 played well but ultimately 

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:45.580
 is so we fight we give everything but 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:47.560
 It is enough if we just 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:53.289
 forward too little impact 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:58.169
 we have to say that we shoot 

00:04:53.289 --> 00:05:00.100
 not totally dangerous positions so 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:03.490
 always not for those for 

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:06.250
 Finally , we have to do that 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:07.570
 we will improve you decide 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:10.330
 simply more pressure on the opponent 

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:14.520
 bring the ultimate and it lies 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:16.419
 we always sometime is the game 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:18.130
 surely then finally after 

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:20.500
 home played if it tried 

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:22.949
 because they were just too strong and then 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:22.949
 to stick
