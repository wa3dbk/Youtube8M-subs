kind of a rough four grain leather now
I'm<00:00:30.869> not<00:00:30.990> concerned<00:00:31.439> about<00:00:31.590> it<00:00:31.710> scratching

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
I'm not concerned about it scratching

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.330 
I'm not concerned about it scratching
the<00:00:32.520> iPad<00:00:32.940> Mini<00:00:33.360> when<00:00:33.719> it's<00:00:33.870> in<00:00:34.020> this<00:00:34.200> case<00:00:34.469> but

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
the iPad Mini when it's in this case but

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.889 
the iPad Mini when it's in this case but
I<00:00:35.370> do<00:00:35.489> call<00:00:35.790> that<00:00:35.969> out<00:00:36.090> cuz<00:00:36.270> most<00:00:36.510> of<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:36.690> time

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
I do call that out cuz most of the time

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.750 
I do call that out cuz most of the time
it's<00:00:37.079> very<00:00:37.140> soft<00:00:37.800> on<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.070> inside<00:00:38.160> of<00:00:38.670> these

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
it's very soft on the inside of these

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.280 
it's very soft on the inside of these
cases<00:00:39.239> and<00:00:39.390> this<00:00:39.480> one's<00:00:39.690> a<00:00:39.809> little<00:00:40.020> bit<00:00:40.110> more

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
cases and this one's a little bit more

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.170 
cases and this one's a little bit more
rough<00:00:40.590> now<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.219> other<00:00:41.430> thing<00:00:41.670> because<00:00:41.910> it<00:00:42.059> is

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
rough now the other thing because it is

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.700 
rough now the other thing because it is
leather<00:00:42.420> it<00:00:42.600> is<00:00:42.660> going<00:00:42.840> to<00:00:42.899> take<00:00:43.110> some<00:00:43.350> time<00:00:43.559> to

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
leather it is going to take some time to

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:44.959 
leather it is going to take some time to
break<00:00:43.920> in<00:00:44.160> so<00:00:44.370> you're<00:00:44.610> going<00:00:44.730> to<00:00:44.760> have<00:00:44.940> a

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
break in so you're going to have a

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.549 
break in so you're going to have a
little<00:00:45.210> bit<00:00:45.270> of<00:00:45.329> stiffness<00:00:45.870> with<00:00:46.079> this<00:00:46.260> case

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
little bit of stiffness with this case

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.979 
little bit of stiffness with this case
out<00:00:46.800> of<00:00:47.039> the<00:00:47.100> box<00:00:47.340> or<00:00:48.120> I<00:00:48.149> should<00:00:48.510> say<00:00:48.719> out<00:00:48.960> of

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
out of the box or I should say out of

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.750 
out of the box or I should say out of
the<00:00:49.140> bag<00:00:49.379> because<00:00:49.680> this<00:00:49.860> is<00:00:50.010> what<00:00:50.160> it<00:00:50.280> ships<00:00:50.520> on

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
the bag because this is what it ships on

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.990 
the bag because this is what it ships on
but<00:00:51.719> I<00:00:51.870> also<00:00:52.320> suspect<00:00:52.710> as<00:00:53.190> it<00:00:53.340> breaks<00:00:53.520> in<00:00:53.820> it's

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
but I also suspect as it breaks in it's

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.729 
but I also suspect as it breaks in it's
going<00:00:54.120> to<00:00:54.210> wear<00:00:54.420> down<00:00:54.660> and<00:00:54.899> look<00:00:55.079> pretty<00:00:55.440> nice

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
going to wear down and look pretty nice

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.250 
going to wear down and look pretty nice
now<00:00:56.460> let's<00:00:56.969> go<00:00:57.090> ahead<00:00:57.270> and<00:00:57.420> slide<00:00:57.629> this<00:00:57.809> in<00:00:58.050> you

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
now let's go ahead and slide this in you

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.420 
now let's go ahead and slide this in you
don't<00:00:58.379> do<00:00:58.559> it<00:00:58.680> from<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:58.949> side<00:00:59.100> you<00:00:59.160> actually

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
don't do it from the side you actually

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.430 
don't do it from the side you actually
do<00:00:59.789> it<00:00:59.879> from<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.180> top<00:01:00.390> here<00:01:00.780> there's<00:01:01.260> no

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
do it from the top here there's no

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.250 
do it from the top here there's no
velcro<00:01:01.859> strap<00:01:02.250> or<00:01:02.520> anything<00:01:02.730> like<00:01:03.120> that<00:01:03.199> but<00:01:04.199> I

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
velcro strap or anything like that but I

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.020 
velcro strap or anything like that but I
haven't<00:01:04.500> found<00:01:04.769> that<00:01:04.890> to<00:01:05.010> really<00:01:05.339> be<00:01:05.460> too<00:01:05.820> much

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
haven't found that to really be too much

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.510 
haven't found that to really be too much
of<00:01:06.299> an<00:01:06.390> issue<00:01:06.619> let<00:01:07.619> me<00:01:07.710> go<00:01:07.799> ahead<00:01:07.890> and<00:01:08.010> just

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
of an issue let me go ahead and just

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.000 
of an issue let me go ahead and just
drop<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.270> iPad<00:01:09.659> Mini<00:01:09.900> straight<00:01:10.530> into<00:01:10.860> this

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
drop the iPad Mini straight into this

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.550 
drop the iPad Mini straight into this
case<00:01:11.340> and<00:01:12.299> you<00:01:12.600> can<00:01:12.780> see<00:01:13.020> what<00:01:13.320> that<00:01:13.350> looks

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
case and you can see what that looks

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.890 
case and you can see what that looks
like<00:01:13.920> as<00:01:14.250> I<00:01:14.400> do<00:01:14.460> this<00:01:14.790> push<00:01:15.479> it<00:01:15.600> all<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:15.780> way

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
like as I do this push it all the way

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.080 
like as I do this push it all the way
down<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:16.470> then<00:01:16.979> we're<00:01:17.100> gonna<00:01:17.189> tuck<00:01:17.520> this<00:01:17.880> back

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
down and then we're gonna tuck this back

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.359 
down and then we're gonna tuck this back
and<00:01:18.570> in<00:01:18.720> now<00:01:19.140> with<00:01:19.409> this<00:01:19.530> being<00:01:19.740> a<00:01:20.009> leather

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
and in now with this being a leather

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.700 
and in now with this being a leather
case<00:01:20.820> and<00:01:21.479> you<00:01:21.570> would<00:01:21.689> normally<00:01:22.080> expect<00:01:22.110> it<00:01:22.590> to

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
case and you would normally expect it to

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.280 
case and you would normally expect it to
smell<00:01:23.009> leathery<00:01:23.820> if<00:01:24.210> that<00:01:24.450> makes<00:01:24.689> sense

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
smell leathery if that makes sense

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.080 
smell leathery if that makes sense
I'm<00:01:25.890> gonna<00:01:26.100> tell<00:01:26.310> you<00:01:26.400> right<00:01:26.430> now<00:01:26.729> and

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
I'm gonna tell you right now and

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.390 
I'm gonna tell you right now and
hopefully<00:01:27.780> this<00:01:28.200> isn't<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.740> situation<00:01:28.920> with

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
hopefully this isn't the situation with

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.700 
hopefully this isn't the situation with
all<00:01:29.579> of<00:01:29.729> these<00:01:29.880> this<00:01:30.390> one<00:01:30.570> has<00:01:30.720> a<00:01:30.750> weird<00:01:31.320> smell

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
all of these this one has a weird smell

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.800 
all of these this one has a weird smell
to<00:01:31.950> it<00:01:31.979> I<00:01:32.159> wouldn't<00:01:32.430> so<00:01:32.579> much<00:01:32.640> say<00:01:32.970> a<00:01:33.000> chemical

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
to it I wouldn't so much say a chemical
