the unreal engine so it looks amazing

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.360 
the unreal engine so it looks amazing
too<00:01:41.720> it's<00:01:42.200> kind<00:01:42.500> of<00:01:42.530> it's<00:01:42.830> kind<00:01:42.950> of<00:01:43.070> an<00:01:43.159> older

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:43.370 
too it's kind of it's kind of an older

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:45.850

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
was tons better than blue dragon and it

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.020 
was tons better than blue dragon and it
actually<00:01:58.159> uses<00:01:58.580> somebody<00:01:59.570> from<00:02:00.850> Square<00:02:01.850> Enix

00:03:40.119 --> 00:03:40.129 
out of it so it's and in my opinion this

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:42.849 
out of it so it's and in my opinion this
game<00:03:40.569> like<00:03:41.569> when<00:03:41.750> I<00:03:41.780> first<00:03:42.019> saw<00:03:42.260> it<00:03:42.290> I<00:03:42.560> actually

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:42.859 
game like when I first saw it I actually

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:44.770 
game like when I first saw it I actually
really<00:03:43.250> liked<00:03:43.459> it<00:03:43.669> but<00:03:44.000> there's<00:03:44.299> a<00:03:44.359> few<00:03:44.629> things

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
really liked it but there's a few things

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:47.890 
really liked it but there's a few things
that<00:03:44.989> made<00:03:45.169> me<00:03:45.290> mad<00:03:45.500> about<00:03:45.709> it<00:03:45.919> one<00:03:46.549> is<00:03:46.970> it<00:03:47.750> uses

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900 
that made me mad about it one is it uses

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:51.219 
that made me mad about it one is it uses
the<00:03:48.019> Unreal<00:03:48.349> Engine<00:03:48.500> so<00:03:49.120> this<00:03:50.120> game<00:03:50.449> sometimes

00:03:51.219 --> 00:03:51.229 
the Unreal Engine so this game sometimes

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:54.300 
the Unreal Engine so this game sometimes
it<00:03:51.349> does<00:03:51.500> have<00:03:51.680> its<00:03:51.829> laggy<00:03:52.040> points<00:03:52.579> and

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
it does have its laggy points and

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.890 
it does have its laggy points and
sometimes<00:03:55.310> textures<00:03:55.849> are<00:03:56.000> really<00:03:56.239> ski<00:03:56.510> Wampus

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:56.900 
sometimes textures are really ski Wampus

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:58.089 
sometimes textures are really ski Wampus
and<00:03:57.079> stuff<00:03:57.199> like<00:03:57.319> that<00:03:57.379> that's<00:03:57.709> just<00:03:57.889> getting

00:03:58.089 --> 00:03:58.099 
and stuff like that that's just getting

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:00.039 
and stuff like that that's just getting
the<00:03:58.400> way<00:03:58.519> it<00:03:58.579> looks<00:03:58.790> right<00:03:59.060> now<00:03:59.659> I<00:03:59.720> want<00:03:59.989> to

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:00.049
