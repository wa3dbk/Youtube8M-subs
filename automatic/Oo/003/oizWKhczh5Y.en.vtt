Nicole and you can see how it's
highlighting<00:01:19.500> just<00:01:20.070> a<00:01:20.250> little<00:01:20.430> bit<00:01:20.549> of<00:01:20.670> light

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
highlighting just a little bit of light

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.090 
highlighting just a little bit of light
here<00:01:21.210> creating<00:01:22.170> just<00:01:22.439> a<00:01:22.590> little<00:01:22.830> bit<00:01:22.950> more

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
some color in there maybe we're just a

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.649 
some color in there maybe we're just a
little<00:01:32.430> bit<00:01:32.700> tired<00:01:32.909> of<00:01:33.030> that<00:01:33.180> white<00:01:33.420> light
