Hello Friends:) I´m in Spain right now because i visit my girlfriend

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:05.920
While buying something to eat in the supermarket i found some special surprise Eggs!

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:18.400
I haven´t heard about VIOLETTA before!I think that is a Teenie Soap from america!?

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:23.520
So decided to make an uboxing Video for you!

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:30.400
The TV show called Violetta and it´s from Disney

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:37.120
Ok let´s have a look.This is the Frontside....here the other

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.120
This is the top!Let´s start to unbox!

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:49.440
2 golden Eggs and 1 red Egg.....i will start with the golden one

00:00:52.480 --> 00:01:02.080
Just take a look what is inside!

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:20.640
looks like a mini game...P92...i don´t know what that means

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.760
And now you can try to hit the goal

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.760
it´s difficult!!!

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:10.880
Game nr. 2 is about to get close as you can to the small blue ring

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:24.320
In this case probably the green ring is the nearest/winner!

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:31.360
Game 3 is about snapping....but i don´t really know the sense of that game

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:46.720
Ok...the second golden Egg....let´s see if there are some differences between those golden and  red Eggs

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:03.840
Here we got this mystery Nummber again!?

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.840
Thissurprise  is gonna be a circus elephant.

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:35.360
This 2 pieces are left!?

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.360
What are they for?????

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.360
The elephant is balancing...that works :)

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:55.040
And now we take a look about our last Chocolate Egg

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:06.880
oooohhh a kind of blue and violet colour

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:12.960
I hear no noise....and it´s a bit heavy....could be a rubber!

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:14.960
Yes IT IS!!!!!!

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:23.200
A Rubber of Violetta

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.200
