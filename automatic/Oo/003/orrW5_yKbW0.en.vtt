00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:36.270
 the one who had promised them we are already going 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.270
 the second the right to choose 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:43.539

 from there compatible searched all 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.869
 documents 

00:01:59.849 --> 00:02:08.670
 once in here they go to look for the 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:08.670
 issue of installing this 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:18.760
 even to be able to apply it with a double 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:20.500
 Christ in prison and well I'm going to 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.660
 start to show what would be the ones that 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.240
 more let's start with this one that 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:28.810
 crazy sister flame I'll show you the 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:31.470
 prior to the credits the subject and its 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.470
 preview 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:53.099
 in the folders libraries like 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:54.810
 they serve them so beautiful and the truth 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:56.880
 that I loved it and I hope that you 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.920
 we're going let's continue with 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.629
 next following is called japan 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.310
 suites 2 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:04.890
 it's like the continuation of the first one 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.930
 He must have shared and well this 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:10.580
 it really is very beautiful is this are 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:15.830
 totally done by me that the hairs 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:18.620
 everyone's icons are made with 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:22.670
 these dolls so so well made by the 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:24.920
 site I painted them I painted them they were I thought not 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.990
 they are called colom in unquera but the 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:29.570
 truth is that I started to avoid them what 

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:32.210
 same as the folders I made them 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:34.370
 and a part of the library look like this 

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:35.750
 it's just really very nice I gave it 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:39.520
 the work of painting them 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:39.520
 I think it would be inside 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:48.890
 and that's how the papers are made 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:50.900
 by myself that is the same as the 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:53.390
 little hand so I hope that agrede 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:55.400
 many babies that looks really very 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:56.570
 nice the next one is called disney 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:00.020
 Take care also I had asked 

00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:02.360
 very much and good these are also a 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:05.480
 existential interest for me were also 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:06.980
 in English and good the folders with the 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:09.500
 same nothing but the color changes 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:11.290
 but they look like that in the part of the 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.450
 discs 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:17.410
 weekly very nice and walking in 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:19.630
 the job of painting them here also in 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:21.579
 the disks so the disks are seen and so 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:24.290
 you see the common folders so 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:27.410
 I hope you like them very much 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:30.050
 you see with descendants it's called pink and 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:32.120
 is your preview is also one of 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:35.000
 the first ones I did what I loved 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:37.760
 very much if you do not almost need 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.650
 are the folders and some things with the 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:40.970
 favorites and the discs are in others 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:44.060
 colors but the truth that looks very 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:46.100
 well I'm from the libraries 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:47.690
 these are the discs and that's how the 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:50.030
 folders like it's not the truth that to me 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:54.150
 I loved it very much and it combines very well 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:58.040
 with these topics well in rositas 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:05:00.470
 the next one is called web ping 

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:03.140
 and this one is currently also very 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:06.350
 nice of these little houses that also 

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:09.470
 has a tag the folders are also 

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:13.280
 made by me consist of folders 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:15.590
 the library folders like this 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:18.620
 they sell records with this house and so 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:24.320
 they see the common folders that are very 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:27.310
 pretty and it's also the next one 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:27.310
 next point 

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:35.210
 the little hands are entered by me 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:36.770
 usually no work these issues of 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:39.020
 doing it is the same thing because I did not want 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:41.900
 they run what icons are but 

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:45.320
 well really very beautiful and I jesÃ© that 

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:47.360
 they are of the principles of it here 

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:49.880
 the libraries are seen like that 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:51.800
 really beautiful, that's how the 

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:54.320
 discs 

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:56.210
 and so you see what the folders would look like 

00:05:54.320 --> 00:06:00.720
 as not only do they look very nice 

00:05:56.210 --> 00:06:03.099
 they are in 3com and the same as the icons 

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:05.120
 let's go to the next the next one is called 

00:06:03.099 --> 00:06:18.160
 try pint 

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:18.160
 and more than what part of this would be 

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:23.670
 so it looks logical if you see the unit and 

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:25.860
 so common folders are also 

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:28.470
 is caritas with these folders and that 

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:32.110
 I hope you let me very much so 

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:34.180
 the next one is called simple colors and pp 

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:36.460
 and he loved it because the truth is that 

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:38.920
 It looks very nice with what would be more 

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:40.680
 blacks also looks great for you 

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:45.580
 see what has served in the parts of a 

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:47.980
 role is to create micro belt is also well 

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:50.110
 go in the libraries so you can see the 

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:52.140
 discs with these maids and so they look 

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:54.910
 the folders are moralistic the 

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:57.370
 basically very beautiful and I hope that you 

00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:59.530
 please until it's change let's go to 

00:06:57.370 --> 00:07:03.480
 next that is called the next one 

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:07.650
 Call ip car is the design only now 

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:10.210
 It is purple between purple and should show 

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:18.060
 so I'm going to leave with the 

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:23.560
 partner and that are now 

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:27.400
 context the common ones and that I'm 

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:30.910
 using now sincerely and has 

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:32.800
 I also annoy the folders and well 

00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:35.310
 since he had already shared them with him 

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:37.200
 call in this m 25 

00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:39.300
 that had already been shared in another 

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:40.770
 country but they share this time 

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:43.770
 also because it really looks very 

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:45.540
 that's how libraries look like that 

00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:47.280
 they see the shots and they see the folders 

00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:50.160
 with only me this is one of the 

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:51.900
 topics that I liked the most that no longer 

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:54.330
 would be all hope you like them 

00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:56.550
 misfortunes for 6,000 subscribers and if 

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:58.380
 have some problem you should also leave 

00:07:56.550 --> 00:08:00.420
 in the description of the video a video 

00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:05.820
 where I show them an agent I saw them 

00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:08.850
 almost all that there are no shared web 

00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:14.910
 and there I leave the solution so that 

00:08:08.850 --> 00:08:19.310
 you can if you have a solution that 

00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:19.310
 have an excellent day
