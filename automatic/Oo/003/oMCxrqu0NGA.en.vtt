that<00:02:05.369> picture<00:02:06.079> it's<00:02:07.079> probably<00:02:07.439> just<00:02:07.560> the

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
that picture it's probably just the

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.380 
that picture it's probably just the
angle<00:02:08.009> more<00:02:08.190> than<00:02:08.399> anything<00:02:08.580> but<00:02:08.879> it<00:02:09.000> is<00:02:09.090> quite

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
angle more than anything but it is quite

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:10.650

just<00:02:44.320> mounted<00:02:44.680> in<00:02:44.890> a<00:02:45.040> truck<00:02:45.310> I<00:02:46.270> have<00:02:46.660> had<00:02:46.870> this

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.020 
just mounted in a truck I have had this

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:48.510 
just mounted in a truck I have had this
running<00:02:47.230> in<00:02:47.440> a<00:02:47.530> truck<00:02:47.740> for<00:02:47.890> about<00:02:48.100> a<00:02:48.130> week<00:02:48.400> and

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:48.520 
running in a truck for about a week and

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.250 
running in a truck for about a week and
a<00:02:48.610> half<00:02:48.640> and<00:02:49.030> then<00:02:49.120> I<00:02:49.210> used<00:02:49.450> it<00:02:49.660> in<00:02:49.750> my<00:02:49.780> own<00:02:49.990> car

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
a half and then I used it in my own car

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.800 
a half and then I used it in my own car
for<00:02:50.500> a<00:02:50.530> bit<00:02:50.710> as<00:02:50.890> you<00:02:51.070> can<00:02:51.220> see<00:02:51.430> in<00:02:52.060> a<00:02:52.270> truck<00:02:52.570> it

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
for a bit as you can see in a truck it

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:54.660 
for a bit as you can see in a truck it
is<00:02:52.960> not<00:02:53.140> overly<00:02:53.500> imposing<00:02:54.100> I'd<00:02:54.220> say<00:02:54.400> it's<00:02:54.580> a

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
is not overly imposing I'd say it's a

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:56.490 
is not overly imposing I'd say it's a
very<00:02:54.880> good<00:02:55.120> size<00:02:55.420> if<00:02:55.690> you're<00:02:55.870> in<00:02:55.960> a<00:02:56.050> larger

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
very good size if you're in a larger

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.430 
very good size if you're in a larger

sensor will do that the only thing with

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:57.990 
sensor will do that the only thing with
this<00:03:54.760> is<00:03:55.000> though<00:03:55.360> it<00:03:56.050> needs<00:03:56.680> constant<00:03:57.370> power

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
this is though it needs constant power

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.360 
this is though it needs constant power
for<00:03:58.660> this<00:03:58.780> to<00:03:58.959> work<00:03:59.110> so<00:03:59.170> you<00:03:59.410> need<00:03:59.770> the<00:04:00.010> camera

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
for this to work so you need the camera

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.610 
for this to work so you need the camera
to<00:04:00.550> have<00:04:00.730> power<00:04:01.000> at<00:04:01.330> all<00:04:01.420> times<00:04:01.750> not<00:04:02.080> just<00:04:02.140> via

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
to have power at all times not just via

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.979 
to have power at all times not just via
the<00:04:02.800> cigarette<00:04:03.250> lighter<00:04:03.330> but<00:04:04.330> a<00:04:04.570> useful

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:04.989 
the cigarette lighter but a useful

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:06.690 
the cigarette lighter but a useful
feature<00:04:05.170> nonetheless<00:04:05.620> for<00:04:06.100> people<00:04:06.430> who<00:04:06.580> are

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:10.450 
after it now in a moment I will change

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:12.449 
after it now in a moment I will change
over<00:04:10.780> to<00:04:10.810> some<00:04:11.110> nighttime<00:04:11.440> footage<00:04:12.130> so<00:04:12.400> you

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:12.459 
over to some nighttime footage so you

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:15.150 
over to some nighttime footage so you
get<00:04:12.730> an<00:04:12.850> idea<00:04:13.330> of<00:04:13.390> what<00:04:13.600> this<00:04:13.750> camera<00:04:14.230> is<00:04:14.680> like

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:15.160 
get an idea of what this camera is like

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.479 
get an idea of what this camera is like
during<00:04:15.850> the<00:04:15.880> darker<00:04:16.780> hours<00:04:16.959> and<00:04:17.950> I<00:04:18.040> must<00:04:18.250> say

during the darker hours and I must say

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:21.270 
during the darker hours and I must say
it<00:04:18.760> does<00:04:18.789> quite<00:04:19.270> a<00:04:19.299> nice<00:04:19.570> job<00:04:19.870> also

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.280 
it does quite a nice job also

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:23.940 
it does quite a nice job also
stop<00:04:22.090> talking<00:04:22.540> for<00:04:22.780> a<00:04:22.840> few<00:04:23.230> moments<00:04:23.650> just<00:04:23.710> to

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:45.250 
coming through fairly clearly right now

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:48.180

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:01.300 
blaring on in the background it did tend

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.230 
blaring on in the background it did tend
to<00:05:01.570> sort<00:05:01.810> of<00:05:01.950> distort<00:05:02.950> the<00:05:03.160> audio<00:05:03.610> a<00:05:03.700> bit<00:05:04.030> with

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:04.240 
to sort of distort the audio a bit with

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.900 
to sort of distort the audio a bit with
the<00:05:04.419> stereo<00:05:05.350> turned<00:05:05.680> up<00:05:05.890> so<00:05:06.100> just<00:05:06.430> a<00:05:06.520> point<00:05:06.760> to

if<00:06:28.930> that's<00:06:29.260> a<00:06:29.409> complaint<00:06:29.830> is<00:06:30.039> the<00:06:30.220> size<00:06:30.490> of

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:30.760 
if that's a complaint is the size of
