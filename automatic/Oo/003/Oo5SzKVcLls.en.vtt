00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
take a small section of hair and begin

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.650 
take a small section of hair and begin
looping<00:00:22.380> it<00:00:22.580> secure<00:00:23.580> each<00:00:23.789> loop<00:00:24.180> with<00:00:24.449> bobby

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
looping it secure each loop with bobby

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:37.640 
looping it secure each loop with bobby
pins

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:37.650 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:40.530 

stop<00:00:38.650> when<00:00:38.860> you<00:00:38.980> reach<00:00:39.010> halfway<00:00:39.520> over<00:00:40.060> take<00:00:40.510> a

stop when you reach halfway over take a

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.630 
stop when you reach halfway over take a
small<00:00:40.870> section<00:00:41.080> put<00:00:41.470> the<00:00:41.590> opposite<00:00:42.160> side<00:00:42.370> and

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:42.640 
small section put the opposite side and

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:55.860 
small section put the opposite side and
repeat<00:00:42.940> the<00:00:43.270> same<00:00:43.300> process

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:55.870 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:58.450 

next<00:00:56.870> you<00:00:56.989> basically<00:00:57.440> continue<00:00:58.010> to<00:00:58.190> form

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:58.460 
next you basically continue to form

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 
loops below the top section try to

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:02.950 
loops below the top section try to
secure<00:01:01.460> the<00:01:01.579> bottom<00:01:01.760> strands<00:01:02.329> up<00:01:02.449> loops<00:01:02.690> as

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:02.960 
secure the bottom strands up loops as

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.770 
secure the bottom strands up loops as
close<00:01:03.530> to<00:01:03.769> the<00:01:03.890> top<00:01:04.100> ones<00:01:04.339> as<00:01:04.580> possible<00:01:05.390> to

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780 
close to the top ones as possible to

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:40.550 
close to the top ones as possible to
avoid<00:01:06.080> any<00:01:06.229> gap

slip<00:01:43.659> loops<00:01:43.869> you<00:01:44.530> can<00:01:44.560> play<00:01:44.860> around<00:01:45.009> with<00:01:45.220> the

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:45.369 
slip loops you can play around with the

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:47.130 
slip loops you can play around with the
side<00:01:45.580> of<00:01:45.610> the<00:01:45.820> loops<00:01:46.030> to<00:01:46.270> compliment<00:01:46.780> a<00:01:46.869> link
