to be talking about tripods today there
are<00:00:20.970> several<00:00:21.180> different<00:00:21.570> manufacturers<00:00:22.170> of

are several different manufacturers of

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.490 
are several different manufacturers of
tripods<00:00:23.720> basically<00:00:24.720> what<00:00:24.900> they<00:00:25.050> do<00:00:25.109> is<00:00:25.350> they

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
tripods basically what they do is they

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.920 
tripods basically what they do is they
give<00:00:25.650> you<00:00:25.740> a<00:00:25.769> firm<00:00:26.420> support<00:00:27.420> for<00:00:27.599> your<00:00:27.689> camera

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.690 
give you a firm support for your camera
so<00:00:28.199> that<00:00:28.289> you<00:00:28.410> can<00:00:28.590> do<00:00:29.240> tack<00:00:30.240> sharp<00:00:30.599> images

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:31.700 
so that you can do tack sharp images

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.700 
so that you can do tack sharp images
also<00:00:32.700> if<00:00:33.000> you<00:00:33.120> need<00:00:33.270> to<00:00:33.420> do<00:00:33.680> long<00:00:34.680> exposures

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
also if you need to do long exposures

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.940 
also if you need to do long exposures
you<00:00:35.370> can<00:00:35.670> do<00:00:35.820> that<00:00:36.200> because<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.469> camera<00:00:37.739> gives

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
you can do that because the camera gives

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.560 
you can do that because the camera gives
you<00:00:38.070> support<00:00:38.399> and<00:00:38.489> it<00:00:38.610> won't<00:00:38.820> move<00:00:39.030> as<00:00:39.300> long<00:00:39.480> as

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
you support and it won't move as long as

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:40.729 
you support and it won't move as long as
you<00:00:39.629> don't<00:00:39.780> bump<00:00:39.989> into<00:00:40.140> it<00:00:40.379> or<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.559> wind

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
you don't bump into it or the wind

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.530 
you don't bump into it or the wind
doesn't<00:00:40.920> blow<00:00:41.010> it<00:00:41.129> hard

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
doesn't blow it hard

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.119 
doesn't blow it hard
basically<00:00:43.079> what<00:00:43.320> to<00:00:43.440> do<00:00:43.620> is<00:00:43.770> there's<00:00:44.070> a

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
basically what to do is there's a

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.139 
basically what to do is there's a
platform<00:00:44.399> on<00:00:44.760> top<00:00:44.940> of<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.090> tripod<00:00:45.539> and<00:00:47.149> camera

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
platform on top of the tripod and camera

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.090 
platform on top of the tripod and camera
just<00:00:48.690> attaches<00:00:49.200> to<00:00:49.350> this<00:00:49.500> usually<00:00:49.920> with<00:00:50.070> a

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
just attaches to this usually with a

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.750 
just attaches to this usually with a
thumb<00:00:50.430> screw<00:00:50.700> on<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:51.300> very<00:00:51.480> bottom<00:00:51.660> of<00:00:51.930> it

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760 
thumb screw on the very bottom of it

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.240 
thumb screw on the very bottom of it
then<00:00:53.760> you<00:00:53.850> have<00:00:54.000> different<00:00:54.329> controls<00:00:55.250> so

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
then you have different controls so

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.510 
then you have different controls so
tilting<00:00:57.289> control<00:00:58.340> and<00:00:59.340> then<00:00:59.489> the

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
tilting control and then the

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.770 
tilting control and then the
side-to-side<00:00:59.910> tilt<00:01:00.390> control<00:01:02.359> the<00:01:03.359> legs<00:01:03.570> are

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
side-to-side tilt control the legs are

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.630 
side-to-side tilt control the legs are
extended<00:01:03.989> well<00:01:04.320> each<00:01:04.890> different<00:01:05.339> types<00:01:05.519> of

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
extended well each different types of

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.899 
extended well each different types of
tripod<00:01:06.030> has<00:01:06.240> has<00:01:06.750> different<00:01:07.380> locking<00:01:08.280> devices

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
tripod has has different locking devices

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.149 
tripod has has different locking devices
on<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.119> legs<00:01:09.299> this<00:01:09.570> is<00:01:09.630> this<00:01:10.439> is<00:01:10.590> a<00:01:10.740> collar

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
on the legs this is this is a collar

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:16.190 
on the legs this is this is a collar
lock<00:01:11.430> a<00:01:14.090> good<00:01:15.090> tripod<00:01:15.270> should<00:01:15.720> also<00:01:15.869> have<00:01:16.170> a

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
lock a good tripod should also have a

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.990 
lock a good tripod should also have a
center<00:01:16.590> column<00:01:16.950> so<00:01:17.130> that<00:01:17.280> after<00:01:17.549> you<00:01:17.580> set<00:01:17.820> your

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
center column so that after you set your

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.499 
center column so that after you set your
camera<00:01:18.330> up<00:01:18.479> if<00:01:19.439> if<00:01:20.189> you<00:01:20.820> just<00:01:21.060> need<00:01:21.210> to<00:01:21.330> raise

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
it by foot or lower by foot you can do

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.140 
it by foot or lower by foot you can do
that<00:01:23.700> using<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.689> center<00:01:24.960> column<00:01:26.119> you<00:01:27.119> can

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
that using the center column you can

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.120 
that using the center column you can
just<00:01:27.360> lock<00:01:27.509> it<00:01:27.570> down<00:01:27.840> once<00:01:28.740> you<00:01:28.829> put<00:01:29.009> your
