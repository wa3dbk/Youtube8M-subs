00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:30.150 
excellent sound so imma just give you a
little<00:02:25.060> example<00:02:25.120> of<00:02:25.600> how<00:02:26.430> the<00:02:27.430> sound<00:02:29.160> sounds

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
little example of how the sound sounds

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:45.000 
little example of how the sound sounds
so<00:02:30.550> let's<00:02:30.880> hit<00:02:31.360> play

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:51.410 

take<00:02:46.010> me<00:02:46.159> home

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.890 

so<00:02:52.530> as<00:02:53.530> you<00:02:53.799> can<00:02:53.950> hear<00:02:54.010> there<00:02:54.760> are<00:02:54.900> six

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
so as you can hear there are six

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.099 
so as you can hear there are six
speakers<00:02:56.379> and<00:02:57.030> subwoofers<00:02:58.030> located<00:02:58.780> keep<00:02:58.959> out

00:02:59.099 --> 00:02:59.109 
speakers and subwoofers located keep out

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:01.920 
speakers and subwoofers located keep out
the<00:02:59.439> armed<00:02:59.680> computer<00:03:00.540> with<00:03:01.540> most<00:03:01.749> of<00:03:01.840> the

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
the armed computer with most of the

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.020 
the armed computer with most of the
sensor<00:03:02.319> in<00:03:02.499> this<00:03:02.709> speaker<00:03:03.129> but<00:03:03.340> the<00:03:03.549> supergirl

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
sensor in this speaker but the supergirl

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.240 
sensor in this speaker but the supergirl
here<00:03:04.569> so<00:03:05.049> it<00:03:05.109> gives<00:03:05.170> you<00:03:05.379> a<00:03:05.439> really<00:03:05.739> good<00:03:05.859> sound

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
here so it gives you a really good sound

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.280 
here so it gives you a really good sound
that<00:03:06.400> comes<00:03:06.579> toward<00:03:06.969> your<00:03:07.150> face<00:03:07.389> instead<00:03:08.170> of

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
that comes toward your face instead of

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.699 
that comes toward your face instead of
just<00:03:08.469> going<00:03:08.680> up<00:03:08.980> and<00:03:09.340> just<00:03:10.319> having<00:03:11.319> the<00:03:11.379> audio

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
just going up and just having the audio

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:13.050 
just going up and just having the audio
dissipate<00:03:12.280> so<00:03:12.400> you<00:03:12.459> have<00:03:12.639> a<00:03:12.670> really<00:03:13.000> strong

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
dissipate so you have a really strong

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.500 
dissipate so you have a really strong
sound<00:03:13.930> throughout<00:03:14.700> rich<00:03:15.700> balanced<00:03:16.239> down

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
sound throughout rich balanced down

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:20.000 
sound throughout rich balanced down
which<00:03:16.810> I<00:03:16.930> really<00:03:17.200> love

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010

so<00:04:08.680> I'm<00:04:08.919> going<00:04:09.159> to<00:04:09.340> demonstrate<00:04:10.120> how<00:04:10.569> it<00:04:10.599> will

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:10.780 
so I'm going to demonstrate how it will

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:10.949 
so I'm going to demonstrate how it will
work

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:10.959 
work

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:13.740 
work
pairing<00:04:11.859> is<00:04:12.009> pretty<00:04:12.280> much<00:04:12.430> it<00:04:12.699> simple<00:04:13.239> so<00:04:13.540> I

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:13.750 
pairing is pretty much it simple so I

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:17.069 
pairing is pretty much it simple so I
have<00:04:14.290> it<00:04:15.040> plugged<00:04:15.400> into<00:04:15.759> the<00:04:16.509> speaker<00:04:16.840> from

00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:17.079 
have it plugged into the speaker from

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:21.270 
have it plugged into the speaker from
here<00:04:18.120> the<00:04:19.120> transmitter<00:04:19.750> the<00:04:20.079> receiver<00:04:20.280> will

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.280 
here the transmitter the receiver will

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:23.189 
here the transmitter the receiver will
pick<00:04:21.549> up<00:04:21.729> the<00:04:22.000> transmitter<00:04:22.479> signal<00:04:22.930> which<00:04:23.050> is

00:04:23.189 --> 00:04:23.199 
pick up the transmitter signal which is

00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:25.589 
pick up the transmitter signal which is
already<00:04:23.409> built<00:04:23.680> into<00:04:23.860> the<00:04:24.009> laptop<00:04:24.520> and<00:04:24.599> you

00:04:25.589 --> 00:04:25.599 
already built into the laptop and you

00:04:25.599 --> 00:04:28.230 
already built into the laptop and you
just<00:04:25.840> you<00:04:26.229> just<00:04:26.259> play<00:04:26.710> like<00:04:27.310> pairing<00:04:27.970> is<00:04:28.210> a

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:28.240 
just you just play like pairing is a

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.810 
just you just play like pairing is a
pairing<00:04:29.080> it's<00:04:29.229> about<00:04:29.470> it<00:04:30.070> takes<00:04:30.280> about<00:04:30.400> maybe

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:30.820 
pairing it's about it takes about maybe

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:33.899 
pairing it's about it takes about maybe
more<00:04:31.570> the<00:04:31.659> two<00:04:31.810> seconds<00:04:32.320> and<00:04:32.500> the<00:04:33.310> good<00:04:33.610> thing

00:04:33.899 --> 00:04:33.909 
more the two seconds and the good thing

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:38.279 
more the two seconds and the good thing
about<00:04:34.590> the<00:04:35.590> wireless<00:04:36.039> the<00:04:36.870> wireless<00:04:37.870> solution

00:04:38.279 --> 00:04:38.289 
about the wireless the wireless solution

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:40.439 
about the wireless the wireless solution
is<00:04:38.440> that<00:04:38.680> it<00:04:38.860> has<00:04:39.039> a<00:04:39.219> range<00:04:39.610> of<00:04:39.820> up<00:04:40.000> to<00:04:40.060> a

00:04:40.439 --> 00:04:40.449 
is that it has a range of up to a

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:43.020 
is that it has a range of up to a
hundred<00:04:40.810> feet<00:04:41.110> which<00:04:41.650> is<00:04:41.680> comparable<00:04:42.250> to

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:43.030 
hundred feet which is comparable to

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:47.249 
hundred feet which is comparable to
airplay<00:04:43.539> and<00:04:43.930> is<00:04:44.650> a<00:04:45.219> lot<00:04:46.060> more<00:04:46.330> than<00:04:46.659> the<00:04:46.780> 33

00:04:47.249 --> 00:04:47.259 
airplay and is a lot more than the 33

00:04:47.259 --> 00:04:49.020 
airplay and is a lot more than the 33
feet<00:04:47.500> that<00:04:47.800> you<00:04:47.830> usually<00:04:48.039> get<00:04:48.370> with<00:04:48.550> Bluetooth

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.030 
feet that you usually get with Bluetooth

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:51.749 
feet that you usually get with Bluetooth
so<00:04:50.099> here<00:04:51.099> we<00:04:51.250> go

00:04:51.749 --> 00:04:51.759 
so here we go

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:56.469 
so here we go
so

00:04:56.469 --> 00:04:56.479 

00:04:56.479 --> 00:05:06.219 

working<00:04:57.479> so<00:04:57.660> long<00:04:57.870> she<00:04:58.500> deserted<00:05:00.199> sorry

00:05:06.219 --> 00:05:06.229 

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:14.239 

so<00:05:07.229> as<00:05:07.349> you<00:05:07.529> can<00:05:07.649> see<00:05:08.209> easy<00:05:09.209> streaming<00:05:13.249> no

00:05:14.239 --> 00:05:14.249 
so as you can see easy streaming no

00:05:14.249 --> 00:05:18.799 
so as you can see easy streaming no
latency<00:05:15.679> picks<00:05:16.679> up<00:05:16.889> right<00:05:17.069> away<00:05:17.449> so<00:05:18.449> again

00:05:18.799 --> 00:05:18.809 
latency picks up right away so again

00:05:18.809 --> 00:05:26.539
