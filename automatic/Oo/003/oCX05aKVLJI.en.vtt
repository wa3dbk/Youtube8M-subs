00:00:03.799 --> 00:00:08.610
 if animals are taken in a vehicle 

00:00:06.539 --> 00:00:10.050
 the driver is obliged to you 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.270
 sufficiently secure 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.140
 Manufacturers offer different 

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:17.070
 techniques 

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:18.960
 for the luggage compartment and the passenger compartment of the adac 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.750
 has now tested such offers 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.930
 initially with a 22 kilogram heavy 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.550
 dogs then first were a dog 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.470
 dishes with easy connection to the 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.180
 short circuit and one with double 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.820
 Connection on the test bench 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:35.070
 In the crash test , the technology proved with 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.710
 double connection as acceptable and 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.720
 conditionally recommendable with simple 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.930
 connection, however, the burden on the 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:44.309
 Impact simply does not stand so see 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.570
 actually a complete failure here 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:50.640
 a system of gait hooks with the 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.410
 dog was actually attached in the 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.140
 vehicle is completely broken 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.670
 that is here has no restraint of 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.649
 animal took place and it could with 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:02.039
 his entire measure and his whole 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:04.229
 energy here in the seat we hit 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.390
 see an enormously deep deformation here 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.400
 Of course the driver is here right now 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.020
 area of ​​the lumbar spine strong 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.659
 that's what it means 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.150
 here are injuries in the back area 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.810
 certainly has more with her 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.930
 place 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.180
 the next test series 1 4 kilograms 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.250
 Heavy cat lady in the transport box 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.520
 first in the footwell behind the 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.920
 front seat this position proved 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.250
 as safe and reliable as the box 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.240
 here has almost no freedom of movement 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.040
 In addition , the lateral remains 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.110
 positioning hardly any risk of injury 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.550
 for the animal 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.080
 extremely critical, however, the 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:42.330
 supposed assurance with the 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.460
 Car belt goes the door and kurt 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.500
 bracket burst during impact 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.120
 consistency wherever possible 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.070
 four-legged in the trunk 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:52.950
 we see here a tense grid 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.630
 that I support from the floor to the ceiling 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.160
 in a normal accident we have 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.070
 of course a certain protection here 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.690
 only if we have a high load here 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.160
 have in the event of an accident just in the 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.630
 the upper part of the can do that then it can 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.510
 Of course, that's what happens 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:09.570
 very easily triggers and thereby the dog in 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:11.459
 the ears may fall if it is 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:13.500
 size of the dog should be allowed though 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:16.140
 Again, a transport box used 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.660
 the positioning becomes important 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.100
 transverse to the direction of travel she charged the 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.850
 animal following an accident at 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.540
 slightest 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:26.220
 despite the high energy boost looks here 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.910
 a huge deformation of the 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:32.190
 Rear seat back the information itself 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.510
 generated on a very high load 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.250
 This degree of stress can be reached 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.800
 but it 's a simple trick 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.750
 also minimize something by here the 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.880
 three point has been closed thus also 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.820
 still for a restraint of their own 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.930
 benches act and thus have 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:48.540
 actually a very simple one 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.760
 load securing that costs nothing 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.950
 live costs but can transport animals 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.260
 who renounces any security 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.120
 the adac also has this situation 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.730
 tested the quadruped on the 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.709
 hat rest on impact with 50 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.230
 hourly kilometers through the vehicle 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:04.910
 space a deadly danger for humans and 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.890
 animal 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:10.950
 on the other hand, the highest possible care 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:13.230
 appreciates adheres to the adac-test gloss 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:15.450
 one sees clearly that the 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:18.450
 housing the animal in a box 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:20.040
 luggage compartment the safest place is at 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.830
 larger dogs are still recommended 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.330
 Attachment of a dividing grid but for one 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:25.980
 normal dog is a normal size 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:28.200
 So the box really the safest place 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:30.769
 and the box should be right in the vehicle 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.769
 be installed
