00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
console opens and the first thing I'm

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:45.979 
console opens and the first thing I'm
going<00:00:39.059> to<00:00:39.149> do<00:00:39.390> is<00:00:39.829> type<00:00:40.829> import<00:00:41.520> module<00:00:44.989> space

server<00:00:46.950> manager<00:00:49.550> essentially<00:00:50.550> what<00:00:50.730> this<00:00:50.879> is

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
server manager essentially what this is

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.979 
server manager essentially what this is
doing<00:00:51.300> is<00:00:51.860> loading<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:53.579> server<00:00:53.910> manager<00:00:54.480> from

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
doing is loading the server manager from

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.580 
doing is loading the server manager from
a<00:00:55.050> PowerShell<00:00:56.329> console<00:00:57.329> so<00:00:57.629> I<00:00:57.660> can<00:00:57.989> execute<00:00:58.320> a

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
a PowerShell console so I can execute a

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.310 
a PowerShell console so I can execute a
series<00:00:58.980> of<00:00:59.010> commands<00:00:59.690> inside<00:01:00.690> of<00:01:00.840> PowerShell

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
series of commands inside of PowerShell

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.860 
series of commands inside of PowerShell
this<00:01:01.530> is<00:01:01.680> much<00:01:01.859> more<00:01:02.100> efficient<00:01:02.609> from<00:01:03.510> here

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
this is much more efficient from here

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.670 
this is much more efficient from here
I'm<00:01:04.019> going<00:01:04.080> to<00:01:04.920> run<00:01:05.189> a<00:01:06.140> script<00:01:07.140> I've<00:01:07.500> already
