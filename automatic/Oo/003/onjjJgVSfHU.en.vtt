00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.790
We are from Russia.

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.640
Look at this, it is so funny.

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:26.400
Today, we're gonna hike Acha mountain.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.180
I'm already tired.

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:30.510
Go down already?

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.080
Why don't we just drink some macgoelli and go home?

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:39.030
It's quite high here.

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.420
I like this feeling.

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.340
It's challenging...

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:46.130
Cold...

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:47.940
It's cold

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:54.640
The weather is nice.

00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:00.020
Go! go!

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.550
Hey, are we at the top?

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:05.940
We're arrived!

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.860
We're arrived!

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.640
It took one hour, a little more than one hour.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:25.560
Time to eat!

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.360
What did you bring?

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.270
Cup noodles,

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.660
Kimchi,

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:37.640
Macgoelli,

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:38.770
Did you also bring coffee?

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.070
So cool

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:44.250
Tangerine,...

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.060
Ah, Kimbop!

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:50.030
You brought Kimbop too?

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:51.720
So awesome

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.750
Cold~

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.860
We need to drink some alcohol before it's getting colder.

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.920
Cheers! Let's celebrate our trip!

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.320
Yeah! Hiking needs Macgoelli!

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:01.320
So sweet!

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:10.840
Wah~!

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:18.550
Nothing can replace Macgoelli at the top of mountains.

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.150
I really didn't expect Sunjin would prepare so well like this.

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.660
Don't judge people by appearance~

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.540
Everything's prepared by Sungjin.

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.440
Hey, this is really good.

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:36.560
I don't know why it tastes much better here.

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:44.830
I'm Matt Lee, I'm not Minbo.

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:51.520
We Koreans eat Kimchi everywhere... 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:52.750
Delicious~

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:57.120
Coffee time~

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.630
You look really Russian.

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:08.830
Russian : Sibalomusuki

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:10.800
You're so mean~

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:20.430
Everyone, you gotta clean up whenever you eat something on the mountain.

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.720
There's a cat.

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.140
Come here~

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:31.560
It's really lazy.

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.060
Wow, here're lots of mountain birds.

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.480
Cool.

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:44.360
The best part I like is that this mountain's 5 minute distance from where people live.

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:45.180
You're lying.

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.360
I'm telling the truth.

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:54.630
The mountain is so beautiful, and the Han river is covered with beautiful white snow.

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:59.640
We didn't have to drive a car to come  to this place , I like that so much.

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.020
Why don't we go down?

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:02.920
Let's go and eat some food!

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:04.940
Okay, now we're going down, but to where?

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:07.640
That will be revealed in ep.2.

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:10.360
Uh? Where are we?

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.020
Gamjatang restaurant?

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:13.800
We're eating Gamjatang?

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.830
Let's get in!

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:17.830
Move! Move!
