00:00:54.029 --> 00:00:54.039 
the computer you can see that we have a

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:57.509 
the computer you can see that we have a
various<00:00:54.609> of<00:00:54.909> minimalism<00:00:55.690> and<00:00:55.989> going<00:00:56.799> to<00:00:57.010> the

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.460 
to go ahead and always revert back to

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.550 
to go ahead and always revert back to
the<00:02:03.759> windows<00:02:04.060> 7<00:02:04.329> interface<00:02:04.719> make<00:02:05.079> sure<00:02:05.319> you

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
the windows 7 interface make sure you

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.460 
the windows 7 interface make sure you
install<00:02:06.340> one<00:02:06.640> don't<00:02:07.149> like<00:02:07.390> it<00:02:07.630> uninstall<00:02:08.440> it

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
install one don't like it uninstall it

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:10.650 
install one don't like it uninstall it
then<00:02:08.950> install<00:02:09.400> the<00:02:09.430> other<00:02:09.940> one<00:02:10.150> so<00:02:10.360> if<00:02:10.540> you

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
then install the other one so if you

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.180 
then install the other one so if you
like<00:02:10.780> gingerbread<00:02:11.200> install<00:02:11.890> it<00:02:12.040> don't<00:02:12.520> happen

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
like gingerbread install it don't happen

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.400 
like gingerbread install it don't happen
like<00:02:13.460> it<00:02:13.640> anymore<00:02:14.000> uninstall<00:02:14.720> it<00:02:14.750> the<00:02:15.110> reason

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
like it anymore uninstall it the reason

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.770 
like it anymore uninstall it the reason
why<00:02:15.530> I<00:02:15.560> say<00:02:15.890> that<00:02:15.920> is<00:02:16.100> because<00:02:16.420> gingerbread<00:02:17.420> it

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
why I say that is because gingerbread it

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.290 
why I say that is because gingerbread it
backs<00:02:18.080> up<00:02:18.320> the<00:02:18.350> windows<00:02:18.680> 7<00:02:18.950> interface<00:02:19.790> the

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
backs up the windows 7 interface the

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.260 
backs up the windows 7 interface the
original<00:02:20.750> and<00:02:20.870> it<00:02:21.500> goes<00:02:21.680> ahead<00:02:21.860> and<00:02:22.280> saves<00:02:23.120> it

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.270 
original and it goes ahead and saves it

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:25.440 
original and it goes ahead and saves it
so<00:02:23.540> if<00:02:23.930> you<00:02:24.140> were<00:02:24.350> to<00:02:24.380> go<00:02:24.920> ahead<00:02:24.980> and<00:02:25.220> install

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
so if you were to go ahead and install

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.580 
so if you were to go ahead and install
honeycomb<00:02:26.450> it's<00:02:26.930> going<00:02:27.170> to<00:02:27.230> back<00:02:27.320> up<00:02:27.470> those

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
honeycomb it's going to back up those

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.320 
honeycomb it's going to back up those
files<00:02:27.890> and<00:02:28.160> when<00:02:28.400> the<00:02:28.490> Seven<00:02:28.730> original<00:02:28.820> is

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
files and when the Seven original is

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:30.520

going<00:02:29.510> to<00:02:29.570> go<00:02:29.690> ahead<00:02:29.750> and<00:02:29.900> be<00:02:29.960> deleted<00:02:30.350> so

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
going to go ahead and be deleted so
