00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
how to do them so that's the finishing

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.880 
how to do them so that's the finishing
result<00:00:20.189> of<00:00:20.310> I<00:00:20.820> know<00:00:21.270> I<00:00:21.420> might<00:00:21.630> go<00:00:22.320> and<00:00:22.619> do<00:00:22.740> a<00:00:22.800> bit

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890

I'm you just take I'll do this one

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.730 
I'm you just take I'll do this one
take<00:01:43.680> it<00:01:44.960> dip<00:01:45.960> a<00:01:46.110> bit<00:01:46.259> of<00:01:46.350> filler<00:01:46.530> in<00:01:46.649> the

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
take it dip a bit of filler in the

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.030 
take it dip a bit of filler in the
middle<00:01:46.979> and<00:01:47.850> then<00:01:48.149> you<00:01:48.509> just<00:01:48.720> dab<00:01:48.990> it<00:01:49.020> so<00:01:49.920> it

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
middle and then you just dab it so it

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.340 
middle and then you just dab it so it
looks<00:01:50.189> like<00:01:50.310> that<00:01:50.460> but<00:01:50.670> you<00:01:51.479> don't<00:01:51.600> want<00:01:51.810> to<00:01:51.899> as

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
looks like that but you don't want to as

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.600 
looks like that but you don't want to as
I<00:01:52.560> said<00:01:52.710> you<00:01:52.829> don't<00:01:52.920> want<00:01:53.040> it<00:01:53.189> to<00:01:53.250> be<00:01:53.340> really

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
I said you don't want it to be really

00:01:53.610 --> 00:02:00.319 
I said you don't want it to be really
big<00:01:53.990> so<00:01:55.159> keep<00:01:56.159> on<00:01:56.280> dabbing<00:01:56.700> it<00:01:59.000> looks<00:02:00.000> kind<00:02:00.299> of

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
big so keep on dabbing it looks kind of

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.990 
big so keep on dabbing it looks kind of
like<00:02:00.450> that<00:02:00.680> it<00:02:01.680> doesn't<00:02:02.189> have<00:02:02.369> to<00:02:02.460> be<00:02:02.549> perfect

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
like that it doesn't have to be perfect

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.450 
like that it doesn't have to be perfect
in<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:03.630> white<00:02:03.810> or<00:02:04.079> anything<00:02:04.259> it<00:02:04.950> can<00:02:05.130> be<00:02:05.250> just

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
in the white or anything it can be just

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.520 
in the white or anything it can be just
rough<00:02:05.759> like<00:02:05.969> that<00:02:06.149> what<00:02:06.780> I'm<00:02:06.869> going<00:02:07.170> to<00:02:07.200> do<00:02:07.350> is

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
rough like that what I'm going to do is

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.880 
rough like that what I'm going to do is
I'm<00:02:07.680> gonna<00:02:07.829> splatter<00:02:08.539> white<00:02:09.539> paint<00:02:09.840> on<00:02:09.989> it<00:02:10.170> so

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
I'm gonna splatter white paint on it so

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:11.740 
I'm gonna splatter white paint on it so
I<00:02:11.190> think

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
I think

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.310 
I think

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
and the white I have a few bits of pink

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.530 
and the white I have a few bits of pink
in<00:02:17.960> there<00:02:18.110> as<00:02:18.200> well<00:02:18.350> but<00:02:18.640> and<00:02:19.640> you<00:02:20.090> start<00:02:20.390> off

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
in there as well but and you start off

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.310 
in there as well but and you start off
with<00:02:20.810> the<00:02:20.990> white<00:02:21.140> anyways<00:02:21.580> so<00:02:22.580> I'm<00:02:22.820> I<00:02:23.240> have<00:02:23.990> a

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:29.860 
with the white anyways so I'm I have a
nail<00:02:24.650> brush<00:02:24.920> to<00:02:25.340> do<00:02:25.460> this<00:02:28.090> so<00:02:29.090> it's<00:02:29.480> literally
