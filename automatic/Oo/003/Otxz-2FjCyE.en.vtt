we've been also really nice to treat to

something<00:02:42.360> wrong<00:02:42.569> with<00:02:42.690> the<00:02:42.840> face<00:02:43.260> other<00:02:44.130> than

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
something wrong with the face other than

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.940 
something wrong with the face other than
the<00:02:44.640> fact<00:02:44.819> that<00:02:45.000> it's<00:02:45.150> the<00:02:45.360> screen<00:02:45.690> face<00:02:45.989> I've

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
the fact that it's the screen face I've

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.370 
the fact that it's the screen face I've
got<00:02:47.010> a<00:02:47.160> little<00:02:47.400> bit<00:02:47.700> of<00:02:47.880> paint<00:02:48.420> I<00:02:48.780> don't<00:02:49.319> know

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
got a little bit of paint I don't know

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.110 
got a little bit of paint I don't know
if<00:02:49.500> it's<00:02:49.620> intentional<00:02:50.010> but<00:02:50.730> I've<00:02:50.940> got<00:02:51.090> a

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
if it's intentional but I've got a

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.250 
if it's intentional but I've got a
little<00:02:51.300> bit<00:02:51.390> of<00:02:51.450> paint<00:02:51.660> that<00:02:51.840> looks<00:02:51.989> like<00:02:52.080> it's

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
little bit of paint that looks like it's

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.690 
little bit of paint that looks like it's
smudged<00:02:52.890> right<00:02:53.819> around<00:02:53.970> the<00:02:54.120> eye<00:02:54.150> socket<00:02:55.110> area

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
smudged right around the eye socket area

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.190 
smudged right around the eye socket area
it's<00:02:56.700> a<00:02:56.790> bit<00:02:56.880> of<00:02:56.970> a<00:02:57.030> shame<00:02:57.270> but<00:02:57.510> I<00:02:57.840> mean<00:02:57.989> you<00:02:58.080> can

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
it's a bit of a shame but I mean you can

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.130 
it's a bit of a shame but I mean you can
also<00:02:58.319> chalk<00:02:58.650> that<00:02:58.680> up<00:02:58.890> to<00:02:59.040> if<00:02:59.430> this<00:02:59.580> was<00:02:59.850> a

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
also chalk that up to if this was a

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.830 
also chalk that up to if this was a
retro<00:03:01.140> figure<00:03:01.709> of<00:03:02.010> ghost<00:03:02.250> face<00:03:02.489> code<00:03:03.450> kind<00:03:03.780> of

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
retro figure of ghost face code kind of

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.390 
retro figure of ghost face code kind of
makes<00:03:03.989> sense<00:03:04.170> that<00:03:04.470> he's<00:03:04.590> got<00:03:04.769> a<00:03:04.950> little<00:03:05.250> bit

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
makes sense that he's got a little bit

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.740 
makes sense that he's got a little bit
of<00:03:05.489> that<00:03:05.580> going<00:03:05.760> on<00:03:05.940> so<00:03:06.120> I<00:03:06.150> can<00:03:06.330> kind<00:03:06.510> of<00:03:06.540> write

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
of that going on so I can kind of write

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.540 
of that going on so I can kind of write
that<00:03:06.930> off<00:03:07.080> but<00:03:07.350> just<00:03:07.560> something<00:03:08.040> I<00:03:08.190> wanted<00:03:08.459> to

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550 
that off but just something I wanted to

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:13.309 
that off but just something I wanted to
note<00:03:09.060> in<00:03:09.300> this<00:03:09.780> video<00:03:10.970> for<00:03:11.970> his<00:03:12.120> body<00:03:12.390> his<00:03:13.290> body

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:13.319 
note in this video for his body his body

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:16.210 
note in this video for his body his body
is<00:03:13.620> basically<00:03:13.920> just<00:03:14.040> a<00:03:14.310> robed<00:03:14.670> figure

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
is basically just a robed figure

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:17.930 
is basically just a robed figure
theoretically<00:03:17.220> what<00:03:17.430> they<00:03:17.549> could<00:03:17.700> have<00:03:17.790> also

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
theoretically what they could have also

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.590 
theoretically what they could have also
done<00:03:18.330> in<00:03:18.630> the<00:03:19.500> vein<00:03:19.709> of<00:03:19.739> us<00:03:20.519> like<00:03:20.940> the<00:03:21.060> old<00:03:21.180> Star

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
done in the vein of us like the old Star

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.270 
done in the vein of us like the old Star
Wars<00:03:21.780> figures<00:03:22.080> is<00:03:22.230> that<00:03:22.890> they<00:03:23.010> could<00:03:23.069> have

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
Wars figures is that they could have

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.490 
Wars figures is that they could have
given<00:03:23.430> him<00:03:23.610> like<00:03:23.819> that<00:03:24.000> plastic<00:03:24.959> you<00:03:25.470> know

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
given him like that plastic you know

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.800 
given him like that plastic you know
outfit<00:03:26.360> kind<00:03:27.360> of<00:03:27.480> would<00:03:27.600> have<00:03:27.630> been

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
outfit kind of would have been

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.479 
outfit kind of would have been
ridiculous<00:03:28.230> but<00:03:28.890> it<00:03:28.980> would<00:03:29.069> have<00:03:29.130> been<00:03:29.190> in<00:03:29.400> the

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
ridiculous but it would have been in the

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:30.920 
ridiculous but it would have been in the
same<00:03:29.670> vein<00:03:30.000> as<00:03:30.030> what<00:03:30.360> we<00:03:30.480> would<00:03:30.600> have<00:03:30.750> gotten

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
same vein as what we would have gotten

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.470 
same vein as what we would have gotten
with<00:03:31.170> other<00:03:31.640> figures<00:03:32.640> certainly<00:03:33.120> back<00:03:33.269> in<00:03:33.420> the

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
with other figures certainly back in the

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.949 
with other figures certainly back in the
day<00:03:33.630> if<00:03:33.810> you<00:03:33.989> remember<00:03:34.350> Darth<00:03:35.220> Vader<00:03:35.489> and<00:03:35.959> what

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
day if you remember Darth Vader and what

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:38.720 
day if you remember Darth Vader and what
we<00:03:37.049> won<00:03:37.260> Kenobi<00:03:37.680> they<00:03:37.829> all<00:03:37.950> had<00:03:38.250> this<00:03:38.400> kind<00:03:38.670> of

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
we won Kenobi they all had this kind of

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:39.949 
we won Kenobi they all had this kind of
I<00:03:38.820> think<00:03:38.910> it<00:03:39.060> was<00:03:39.090> either<00:03:39.269> plastic<00:03:39.540> or<00:03:39.840> was

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
I think it was either plastic or was

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:42.080 
I think it was either plastic or was
cloth<00:03:40.200> and<00:03:40.410> it<00:03:40.500> was<00:03:40.590> a<00:03:40.620> plastic<00:03:40.920> material<00:03:41.340> they

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
cloth and it was a plastic material they

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:43.520 
cloth and it was a plastic material they
could<00:03:42.390> have<00:03:42.480> kind<00:03:42.750> of<00:03:42.840> pulled<00:03:43.049> it<00:03:43.200> off<00:03:43.290> on

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
could have kind of pulled it off on

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:45.349 
could have kind of pulled it off on
ghost<00:03:43.829> face<00:03:44.070> although<00:03:44.579> if<00:03:44.700> people<00:03:44.970> didn't<00:03:45.180> get

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:45.359 
ghost face although if people didn't get

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:46.940 
ghost face although if people didn't get
the<00:03:45.480> reference<00:03:45.690> they<00:03:46.350> would<00:03:46.500> initially

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
the reference they would initially

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:48.670 
the reference they would initially
probably<00:03:47.310> think<00:03:47.489> oh<00:03:47.670> that's<00:03:47.940> really<00:03:48.209> cheap

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680 
probably think oh that's really cheap

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.900 
probably think oh that's really cheap
that's<00:03:49.680> kind<00:03:49.890> of<00:03:49.920> the<00:03:50.040> way<00:03:50.160> the<00:03:50.310> figures<00:03:50.730> were

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
that's kind of the way the figures were

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.509 
that's kind of the way the figures were
back<00:03:51.209> in<00:03:51.390> the<00:03:51.450> day<00:03:51.480> instead<00:03:52.070> they've<00:03:53.070> swapped

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 
back in the day instead they've swapped

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:56.420 
back in the day instead they've swapped
out<00:03:53.790> a<00:03:54.019> material<00:03:55.019> fabric<00:03:55.500> for<00:03:55.950> essentially

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
out a material fabric for essentially

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:00.289 
out a material fabric for essentially
just<00:03:56.670> a<00:03:57.440> sculpted<00:03:58.440> robe<00:03:58.890> the<00:03:59.760> sculpted<00:04:00.150> robe

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:00.299 
just a sculpted robe the sculpted robe

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:02.060 
just a sculpted robe the sculpted robe
does<00:04:00.480> a<00:04:00.510> pretty<00:04:00.810> good<00:04:00.900> job<00:04:01.079> right<00:04:01.709> around<00:04:01.859> of

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:02.070 
does a pretty good job right around of

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:04.849 
does a pretty good job right around of
course<00:04:02.340> the<00:04:02.519> sleeve<00:04:02.850> area<00:04:03.060> and<00:04:03.650> swapped<00:04:04.650> out

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:12.060 
it's one of those figures that does

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:15.200 
it's one of those figures that does
