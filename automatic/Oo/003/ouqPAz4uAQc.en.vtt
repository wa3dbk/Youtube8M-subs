all<00:00:01.770> right<00:00:02.100> 8.3<00:00:03.000> the<00:00:03.300> number<00:00:03.810> E<00:00:04.549> the<00:00:05.549> number<00:00:06.000> E

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.150 
all right 8.3 the number E the number E

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:12.410 
all right 8.3 the number E the number E
so<00:00:06.839> here<00:00:07.200> we<00:00:07.290> go<00:00:09.380> natural<00:00:10.380> base<00:00:10.620> E<00:00:11.360> or<00:00:12.360> the

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
so here we go natural base E or the

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.250 
so here we go natural base E or the
Euler<00:00:13.200> number<00:00:13.230> okay<00:00:14.269> it's<00:00:15.269> a<00:00:15.450> number<00:00:15.809> and<00:00:16.080> it's

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
Euler number okay it's a number and it's

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.439 
Euler number okay it's a number and it's
kind<00:00:16.440> of<00:00:16.470> like<00:00:16.560> pie<00:00:16.800> you<00:00:17.430> know<00:00:17.580> pi<00:00:17.850> PI<00:00:18.180> keeps

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
kind of like pie you know pi PI keeps

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.640 
kind of like pie you know pi PI keeps
going<00:00:18.720> on<00:00:18.900> forever<00:00:20.359> 3.14159265<00:00:21.439> three<00:00:22.439> five

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
going on forever 3.14159265 three five

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.460 
going on forever 3.14159265 three five
eight<00:00:22.920> nine<00:00:23.160> seven<00:00:23.189> nine<00:00:23.580> three<00:00:23.730> I<00:00:24.350> can<00:00:25.350> keep

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
eight nine seven nine three I can keep

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.500 
eight nine seven nine three I can keep
going<00:00:25.529> but<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.039> point<00:00:26.250> is<00:00:26.460> it<00:00:26.820> just<00:00:27.390> never

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
going but the point is it just never

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.839 
going but the point is it just never
ends<00:00:27.840> well<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:28.590> Euler<00:00:28.890> number<00:00:28.920> is<00:00:29.369> the<00:00:29.640> same

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
ends well the Euler number is the same

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.630 
ends well the Euler number is the same
way<00:00:30.119> and<00:00:31.019> that's<00:00:31.199> why<00:00:31.349> they<00:00:31.980> put<00:00:32.250> this<00:00:32.399> little

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
way and that's why they put this little

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.150 
way and that's why they put this little
either<00:00:33.180> which<00:00:33.390> stands<00:00:33.660> for<00:00:33.809> they<00:00:34.649> just<00:00:34.829> denote

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
either which stands for they just denote

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.090 
either which stands for they just denote
it<00:00:35.340> as<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:35.760> e<00:00:35.790> and<00:00:36.390> basically<00:00:37.350> roughly

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
it as the e and basically roughly

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.220 
it as the e and basically roughly
speaking<00:00:38.309> roughly<00:00:39.180> speaking<00:00:39.210> e<00:00:39.780> stands<00:00:40.079> for

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
speaking roughly speaking e stands for

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.590 
speaking roughly speaking e stands for
about<00:00:40.590> two<00:00:40.829> point<00:00:41.040> seven<00:00:41.280> one<00:00:41.460> eight<00:00:41.850> roughly

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
about two point seven one eight roughly

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.180 
about two point seven one eight roughly
is<00:00:42.920> about<00:00:43.920> what<00:00:44.250> e<00:00:44.399> stands<00:00:44.910> for<00:00:45.739> so<00:00:46.739> why<00:00:47.129> would

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
is about what e stands for so why would

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.520 
is about what e stands for so why would
be<00:00:47.610> something<00:00:48.300> like<00:00:48.450> this<00:00:48.750> created<00:00:49.350> as<00:00:49.500> the

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
be something like this created as the

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.590 
be something like this created as the
point<00:00:49.950> well<00:00:50.160> basically<00:00:50.910> here's<00:00:51.120> what<00:00:51.270> happens

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
point well basically here's what happens

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.209 
point well basically here's what happens
if<00:00:51.719> you<00:00:51.840> remember<00:00:52.110> back<00:00:52.230> in<00:00:52.289> 8.1<00:00:52.920> when<00:00:53.039> we<00:00:53.129> were

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
if you remember back in 8.1 when we were

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.000 
if you remember back in 8.1 when we were
talking<00:00:53.550> about<00:00:54.230> compound<00:00:55.230> interest<00:00:55.620> we<00:00:55.890> had

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
talking about compound interest we had

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.880 
talking about compound interest we had
this<00:00:56.129> formula<00:00:56.730> and<00:00:56.940> this<00:00:57.840> was<00:00:58.050> n<00:00:58.289> standing<00:00:58.739> for

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
this formula and this was n standing for

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.619 
this formula and this was n standing for
the<00:00:58.980> number<00:00:59.250> of<00:00:59.340> times<00:00:59.609> the<00:00:59.820> problem<00:01:00.300> is<00:01:00.449> it

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
the number of times the problem is it

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.840 
the number of times the problem is it
kept<00:01:00.899> changing<00:01:01.289> right<00:01:01.920> if<00:01:02.430> we<00:01:02.670> did<00:01:02.820> it

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
kept changing right if we did it

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.700 
kept changing right if we did it
quarterly<00:01:03.239> I<00:01:03.420> put<00:01:03.690> a<00:01:03.719> 4<00:01:03.989> in<00:01:04.110> there<00:01:04.320> and<00:01:04.530> there

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
quarterly I put a 4 in there and there

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.010 
quarterly I put a 4 in there and there
if<00:01:04.860> we<00:01:04.890> did<00:01:05.250> it<00:01:05.280> monthly<00:01:05.939> I<00:01:05.970> put<00:01:06.180> a<00:01:06.210> 12<00:01:06.510> in<00:01:06.750> there

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
if we did it monthly I put a 12 in there

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.289 
if we did it monthly I put a 12 in there
and<00:01:07.229> they're<00:01:07.409> right<00:01:07.680> so<00:01:07.950> we<00:01:08.610> did<00:01:08.880> this<00:01:09.060> already

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
and they're right so we did this already

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.109 
and they're right so we did this already
before<00:01:10.070> but<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.159> point<00:01:11.340> is<00:01:11.520> it<00:01:11.640> kept<00:01:11.820> changing

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
before but the point is it kept changing

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.990 
before but the point is it kept changing
and<00:01:12.479> you<00:01:13.439> would<00:01:13.590> still<00:01:13.950> continue<00:01:14.250> if<00:01:14.760> it<00:01:14.880> was

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
and you would still continue if it was

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.450 
and you would still continue if it was
continuously<00:01:15.659> speaking<00:01:16.290> notice<00:01:17.280> that<00:01:17.310> the

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
continuously speaking notice that the

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.240 
continuously speaking notice that the
higher<00:01:17.700> we<00:01:17.909> got<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.960> more<00:01:19.320> money<00:01:19.530> we<00:01:19.710> made<00:01:19.979> but

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
higher we got the more money we made but

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.980 
higher we got the more money we made but
it<00:01:20.340> started<00:01:20.610> to<00:01:20.670> get<00:01:20.820> very<00:01:20.880> little<00:01:21.360> over<00:01:21.750> time

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
it started to get very little over time

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.620 
it started to get very little over time
like<00:01:22.290> we<00:01:22.409> could<00:01:22.560> do<00:01:22.790> 365<00:01:23.790> days<00:01:24.060> I<00:01:24.330> could<00:01:24.479> do

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
like we could do 365 days I could do

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.620 
like we could do 365 days I could do
every<00:01:25.409> minute<00:01:25.740> every<00:01:25.890> hour<00:01:26.340> every<00:01:26.759> second<00:01:27.479> if

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
every minute every hour every second if

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.109 
every minute every hour every second if
I<00:01:27.720> wanted<00:01:28.020> to<00:01:28.080> but<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:29.130> closer<00:01:29.700> gets

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
I wanted to but the the closer gets

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.969 
I wanted to but the the closer gets
instead<00:01:30.450> of<00:01:30.540> saying<00:01:30.750> what<00:01:31.439> if<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.710> interest

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
instead of saying what if the interest

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.640 
instead of saying what if the interest
was<00:01:32.189> calculated<00:01:32.850> every<00:01:33.240> second<00:01:33.810> of<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:34.619> day

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
was calculated every second of the day

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.850 
was calculated every second of the day
it<00:01:35.460> kind<00:01:36.210> of<00:01:36.360> just<00:01:36.750> gets<00:01:36.960> a<00:01:37.140> waste<00:01:37.380> for<00:01:37.590> you<00:01:37.770> to

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
it kind of just gets a waste for you to

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.830 
it kind of just gets a waste for you to
plug<00:01:38.040> in<00:01:38.220> those<00:01:38.369> numbers<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:39.030> point<00:01:39.270> is<00:01:39.420> as<00:01:39.570> it

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
plug in those numbers the point is as it

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.160 
plug in those numbers the point is as it
grows<00:01:40.110> it<00:01:40.860> gets<00:01:41.130> to<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:41.670> same<00:01:41.970> rough<00:01:42.630> estimate

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
grows it gets to the same rough estimate

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.899 
grows it gets to the same rough estimate
of<00:01:43.259> a<00:01:43.350> number<00:01:43.649> which<00:01:43.890> is<00:01:44.130> e<00:01:44.310> which<00:01:44.640> is<00:01:44.670> what

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
of a number which is e which is what

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.090 
of a number which is e which is what
we're<00:01:45.060> talking<00:01:45.479> about<00:01:45.570> here<00:01:45.720> so<00:01:46.710> that's

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
we're talking about here so that's

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.010 
we're talking about here so that's
basically<00:01:47.369> what<00:01:47.700> he<00:01:47.909> is<00:01:48.090> so<00:01:48.299> instead<00:01:48.509> of<00:01:48.600> doing

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
basically what he is so instead of doing

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.670 
basically what he is so instead of doing
that<00:01:49.759> we<00:01:50.759> put<00:01:50.970> e<00:01:51.149> in<00:01:51.270> its<00:01:51.420> spot<00:01:51.689> just<00:01:52.590> some

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
that we put e in its spot just some

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.819 
that we put e in its spot just some
little<00:01:52.799> things<00:01:53.100> to<00:01:53.250> keep<00:01:53.399> on<00:01:54.409> value<00:01:55.409> with<00:01:55.530> e<00:01:55.710> is

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
little things to keep on value with e is

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.550 
little things to keep on value with e is
you<00:01:55.979> can<00:01:56.159> treat<00:01:56.399> E<00:01:56.630> as<00:01:57.630> if<00:01:57.869> it<00:01:58.020> is<00:01:58.049> a<00:01:58.170> variable

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
you can treat E as if it is a variable

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.590 
you can treat E as if it is a variable
so<00:01:59.100> all<00:01:59.280> you're<00:01:59.430> basically<00:01:59.759> going<00:01:59.939> to<00:02:00.030> do<00:02:00.240> here

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
so all you're basically going to do here

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.660 
so all you're basically going to do here
is<00:02:00.719> yours<00:02:01.290> going<00:02:01.560> to<00:02:01.799> add<00:02:02.009> the<00:02:02.399> exponents

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
is yours going to add the exponents

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.030 
is yours going to add the exponents
because<00:02:02.969> they're<00:02:03.450> side<00:02:03.659> by<00:02:03.689> side<00:02:04.170> all<00:02:04.530> you

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
because they're side by side all you

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.649 
because they're side by side all you
simply<00:02:05.460> need<00:02:05.579> to<00:02:05.700> do<00:02:05.850> is<00:02:06.000> add<00:02:06.180> the<00:02:06.210> exponents

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
simply need to do is add the exponents

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.620 
simply need to do is add the exponents
so<00:02:07.380> three<00:02:07.799> and<00:02:08.069> four

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
so three and four

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.470 
so three and four
is<00:02:08.720> seven<00:02:09.380> so<00:02:09.680> you<00:02:09.770> just<00:02:09.980> write<00:02:10.550> and<00:02:10.790> add<00:02:11.300> them

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
is seven so you just write and add them

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.380 
is seven so you just write and add them
together<00:02:11.660> to<00:02:11.990> get<00:02:12.080> e<00:02:12.260> to<00:02:12.290> the<00:02:12.380> seventh<00:02:13.210> this<00:02:14.210> is

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
together to get e to the seventh this is

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.150 
together to get e to the seventh this is
the<00:02:14.540> same<00:02:14.750> with<00:02:14.960> division<00:02:15.440> you<00:02:15.920> would<00:02:16.040> take

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
the same with division you would take

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.710 
the same with division you would take
the<00:02:16.310> 10<00:02:16.460> in<00:02:16.550> the<00:02:16.640> five<00:02:16.850> and<00:02:17.030> divide<00:02:17.330> them<00:02:17.360> to

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
the 10 in the five and divide them to

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.530 
the 10 in the five and divide them to
get<00:02:17.840> to<00:02:18.170> but<00:02:19.070> then<00:02:19.310> just<00:02:19.790> like<00:02:20.030> with<00:02:20.330> the

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
get to but then just like with the

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.150 
get to but then just like with the
exponent<00:02:21.050> rules<00:02:21.230> we<00:02:21.410> talked<00:02:21.680> about<00:02:21.830> in

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
exponent rules we talked about in

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.150 
exponent rules we talked about in
chapter<00:02:22.610> 6<00:02:22.910> and<00:02:23.060> in<00:02:23.390> chapter<00:02:23.570> 7<00:02:24.140> all<00:02:24.380> I<00:02:24.440> need<00:02:25.130> to

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
chapter 6 and in chapter 7 all I need to

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:30.160 
chapter 6 and in chapter 7 all I need to
do<00:02:25.400> is<00:02:25.550> subtract<00:02:25.970> those<00:02:26.210> so<00:02:26.840> 3<00:02:27.410> minus<00:02:27.920> 2<00:02:28.160> is<00:02:29.170> 1

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
do is subtract those so 3 minus 2 is 1

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.220 
do is subtract those so 3 minus 2 is 1
so<00:02:30.890> we<00:02:31.220> end<00:02:31.400> up<00:02:31.550> with<00:02:31.580> 10<00:02:31.970> /<00:02:32.240> 5<00:02:32.600> which<00:02:32.810> is<00:02:32.840> two

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
so we end up with 10 / 5 which is two

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.800 
so we end up with 10 / 5 which is two
and<00:02:33.500> those<00:02:34.190> when<00:02:34.520> we<00:02:34.550> look<00:02:34.760> at<00:02:34.850> those<00:02:35.090> that<00:02:35.600> is

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
and those when we look at those that is

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.440 
and those when we look at those that is
three<00:02:36.290> minus<00:02:36.560> two<00:02:36.980> is<00:02:37.160> one<00:02:37.610> so<00:02:37.910> it's<00:02:38.060> just<00:02:38.180> e<00:02:38.390> to

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
three minus two is one so it's just e to

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.240 
three minus two is one so it's just e to
the<00:02:38.690> first<00:02:38.960> power<00:02:39.230> so<00:02:39.620> we<00:02:39.650> actually<00:02:39.860> end<00:02:40.160> up

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
the first power so we actually end up

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.480 
the first power so we actually end up
with<00:02:40.930> combining<00:02:41.930> those<00:02:42.080> together<00:02:42.320> to<00:02:43.010> e<00:02:43.040> as

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:43.490 
with combining those together to e as

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:46.150 
with combining those together to e as
your<00:02:44.030> answer<00:02:44.740> with<00:02:45.740> something<00:02:45.860> like<00:02:46.130> this

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
your answer with something like this

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.030 
your answer with something like this
this<00:02:47.150> to<00:02:47.510> still<00:02:47.930> gets<00:02:48.230> distributed<00:02:48.560> through

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
this to still gets distributed through

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.970 
this to still gets distributed through
to<00:02:49.250> both<00:02:49.460> so<00:02:49.670> it's<00:02:49.850> 3<00:02:50.300> squared<00:02:50.870> and<00:02:51.200> it's<00:02:51.710> 2

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
to both so it's 3 squared and it's 2

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.880 
to both so it's 3 squared and it's 2
times<00:02:52.340> negative<00:02:52.870> 4x<00:02:53.870> so<00:02:54.170> it's<00:02:54.350> 2<00:02:54.620> times

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
times negative 4x so it's 2 times

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.880 
times negative 4x so it's 2 times
negative<00:02:55.790> 2<00:02:56.600> times<00:02:56.780> negative<00:02:56.900> 4x<00:02:57.470> which<00:02:57.680> is

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
negative 2 times negative 4x which is

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:00.430 
negative 2 times negative 4x which is
negative<00:02:58.190> 8x<00:02:58.580> so<00:02:59.420> this<00:02:59.570> is<00:02:59.690> actually<00:02:59.870> 3

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
negative 8x so this is actually 3

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.820 
negative 8x so this is actually 3
squared<00:03:00.860> +<00:03:01.130> e<00:03:01.370> to<00:03:01.820> the<00:03:01.850> negative<00:03:02.210> 8x<00:03:02.680> so<00:03:03.680> that

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:03.830 
squared + e to the negative 8x so that

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:05.650 
squared + e to the negative 8x so that
becomes<00:03:04.160> 9<00:03:04.520> but<00:03:04.850> since<00:03:05.030> we<00:03:05.150> can't<00:03:05.450> have

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
becomes 9 but since we can't have

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.840 
becomes 9 but since we can't have
negative<00:03:05.840> exponents<00:03:06.230> and<00:03:06.980> I'll<00:03:07.610> just<00:03:07.730> move

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:07.850 
negative exponents and I'll just move

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:09.100 
negative exponents and I'll just move
out<00:03:08.030> here<00:03:08.090> remember<00:03:08.750> you<00:03:08.840> can't<00:03:09.020> have

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110 
out here remember you can't have

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:11.710 
out here remember you can't have
negative<00:03:09.230> exponents<00:03:09.590> so<00:03:10.250> that<00:03:11.090> negative<00:03:11.540> 8x

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
negative exponents so that negative 8x

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.680 
negative exponents so that negative 8x
goes<00:03:12.140> on<00:03:12.290> the<00:03:12.380> bottom<00:03:12.560> so<00:03:12.950> it's<00:03:13.100> eat<00:03:13.340> than<00:03:13.760> 8<00:03:14.330> X

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690 
goes on the bottom so it's eat than 8 X

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:17.440 
goes on the bottom so it's eat than 8 X
on<00:03:14.870> the<00:03:14.960> bottom<00:03:15.320> and<00:03:15.410> the<00:03:15.620> nine<00:03:15.860> stays<00:03:16.340> on<00:03:16.730> top

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
on the bottom and the nine stays on top

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:19.780 
on the bottom and the nine stays on top
so<00:03:18.050> just<00:03:18.260> something<00:03:18.590> there<00:03:18.920> for<00:03:18.980> you<00:03:19.370> to<00:03:19.580> keep

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
so just something there for you to keep

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.760 
so just something there for you to keep
in<00:03:19.940> mind

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:23.770 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:26.700 

alright<00:03:24.670> so<00:03:24.910> using<00:03:25.330> a<00:03:25.390> calculator<00:03:25.710> stuff

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:26.710 
alright so using a calculator stuff

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:28.890 
alright so using a calculator stuff
figure<00:03:27.160> out<00:03:27.250> what<00:03:27.370> e<00:03:27.580> squared<00:03:28.030> is<00:03:28.300> so<00:03:28.510> where<00:03:28.720> is

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
figure out what e squared is so where is

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.680 
figure out what e squared is so where is
eon<00:03:29.350> your<00:03:29.470> calculator<00:03:30.070> so<00:03:30.940> what<00:03:31.270> we<00:03:31.390> need<00:03:31.570> to

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
eon your calculator so what we need to

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:35.000 
eon your calculator so what we need to
do<00:03:31.870> here<00:03:32.170> is<00:03:32.550> let's<00:03:33.550> find<00:03:33.880> out<00:03:34.240> where<00:03:34.450> he<00:03:34.720> is

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
do here is let's find out where he is

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.710 
do here is let's find out where he is
pcln<00:03:36.010> on<00:03:36.220> your<00:03:36.340> graphing<00:03:36.550> calculator<00:03:36.730> see

in<00:03:50.050> that<00:03:50.170> parenthesis<00:03:50.740> you<00:03:50.890> type<00:03:51.100> a<00:03:51.220> to<00:03:51.460> end

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:51.910 
in that parenthesis you type a to end

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:54.270 
in that parenthesis you type a to end
parenthesis<00:03:52.720> in<00:03:52.900> there<00:03:53.110> and<00:03:53.350> when<00:03:53.860> you<00:03:53.950> get<00:03:54.160> it

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
parenthesis in there and when you get it

00:03:54.280 --> 00:04:00.150 
parenthesis in there and when you get it
you<00:03:54.310> get<00:03:54.580> roughly<00:03:55.740> 7.38<00:03:57.270> 9056<00:03:58.890> you<00:03:59.890> can<00:04:00.040> also

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.160 
you get roughly 7.38 9056 you can also

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.780 
you get roughly 7.38 9056 you can also
type<00:04:00.490> in<00:04:00.670> negative<00:04:01.360> at<00:04:02.170> negatives<00:04:03.160> as<00:04:03.310> well<00:04:03.490> so

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:03.790 
type in negative at negatives as well so

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:06.330 
type in negative at negatives as well so
press<00:04:04.060> 2nd<00:04:04.570> l<00:04:04.750> and<00:04:04.990> again<00:04:05.290> and<00:04:05.560> you<00:04:06.040> just<00:04:06.190> type

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:06.340 
press 2nd l and again and you just type

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.820 
press 2nd l and again and you just type
in<00:04:06.490> negative<00:04:06.850> 0<00:04:06.880> point<00:04:07.120> 0<00:04:07.180> 6<00:04:07.810> and<00:04:08.080> parentheses

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:08.830 
in negative 0 point 0 6 and parentheses

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:11.930 
in negative 0 point 0 6 and parentheses
and<00:04:09.100> you<00:04:09.880> would<00:04:10.000> get<00:04:10.180> roughly<00:04:10.780> 0<00:04:10.900> point<00:04:11.200> 94

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
and you would get roughly 0 point 94

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:15.810 
and you would get roughly 0 point 94
1765<00:04:13.530> so<00:04:14.530> really<00:04:15.130> that's<00:04:15.250> all<00:04:15.430> that<00:04:15.580> it<00:04:15.640> was

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:15.820 
1765 so really that's all that it was

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:18.990 
1765 so really that's all that it was
nothing<00:04:16.510> big<00:04:16.720> nothing<00:04:16.750> spectacular<00:04:17.260> but<00:04:18.000> now

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.000 
nothing big nothing spectacular but now

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.210 
nothing big nothing spectacular but now
let's<00:04:19.630> make<00:04:19.900> sure<00:04:19.930> we<00:04:20.170> can<00:04:20.350> graph<00:04:20.650> these<00:04:21.040> on

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:21.220 
let's make sure we can graph these on

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:24.480 
let's make sure we can graph these on
our<00:04:21.340> calculator<00:04:21.580> so<00:04:22.030> go<00:04:22.150> to<00:04:22.210> y<00:04:22.420> equals<00:04:22.450> and<00:04:23.490> if

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:24.490 
our calculator so go to y equals and if

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:25.530 
our calculator so go to y equals and if
you<00:04:24.580> have<00:04:24.700> something<00:04:24.850> there<00:04:25.030> just<00:04:25.270> clear<00:04:25.510> up

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:25.540 
you have something there just clear up

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:29.310 
you have something there just clear up
so<00:04:26.260> it's<00:04:26.440> 2<00:04:26.800> times<00:04:27.370> go<00:04:28.090> to<00:04:28.150> second<00:04:28.720> Ln<00:04:29.140> that

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:29.320 
so it's 2 times go to second Ln that

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.500 
so it's 2 times go to second Ln that
will<00:04:29.440> give<00:04:29.590> you<00:04:29.680> the<00:04:29.770> e<00:04:29.820> the<00:04:30.820> caret<00:04:31.150> sign<00:04:31.330> is

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:31.510 
will give you the e the caret sign is

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:33.060 
will give you the e the caret sign is
already<00:04:31.780> there<00:04:31.990> so<00:04:32.170> we<00:04:32.290> just<00:04:32.470> have<00:04:32.590> to<00:04:32.680> plug<00:04:32.860> in

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.070 
already there so we just have to plug in

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:36.480 
already there so we just have to plug in
point<00:04:33.370> 75<00:04:34.120> type<00:04:34.990> the<00:04:35.170> X<00:04:35.350> afterwards<00:04:36.040> which<00:04:36.310> is

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:36.490 
point 75 type the X afterwards which is

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:38.430 
point 75 type the X afterwards which is
where<00:04:36.700> the<00:04:36.910> alpha<00:04:37.300> sine<00:04:37.510> is<00:04:37.630> right<00:04:37.840> beside<00:04:37.990> the

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:38.440 
where the alpha sine is right beside the

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.590 
where the alpha sine is right beside the
Alpha<00:04:38.890> and<00:04:39.250> then<00:04:39.550> end<00:04:39.730> parenthesis<00:04:40.270> and<00:04:40.420> go<00:04:40.540> to

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:40.600 
Alpha and then end parenthesis and go to

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:43.440 
Alpha and then end parenthesis and go to
graph<00:04:40.870> so<00:04:41.770> when<00:04:41.890> you<00:04:41.980> go<00:04:42.070> to<00:04:42.130> graph<00:04:42.430> it<00:04:42.790> kind<00:04:43.360> of

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:43.450 
graph so when you go to graph it kind of

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:45.900 
graph so when you go to graph it kind of
goes<00:04:43.600> up<00:04:43.870> like<00:04:44.050> we<00:04:44.230> solve<00:04:44.500> the<00:04:44.910> exponential

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:45.910 
goes up like we solve the exponential

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:47.670 
goes up like we solve the exponential
ones<00:04:46.090> go<00:04:46.330> up<00:04:46.480> before<00:04:46.900> right<00:04:47.140> it<00:04:47.290> kind<00:04:47.470> of<00:04:47.500> goes

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680 
ones go up before right it kind of goes

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.130 
ones go up before right it kind of goes
up<00:04:47.950> in<00:04:48.160> the<00:04:48.280> same<00:04:48.460> fashion<00:04:48.850> so<00:04:49.600> let's<00:04:49.870> look<00:04:49.990> at

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:50.140 
up in the same fashion so let's look at

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:51.960 
up in the same fashion so let's look at
our<00:04:50.170> list<00:04:50.470> go<00:04:50.650> to<00:04:50.710> 2nd<00:04:51.160> graph<00:04:51.400> and<00:04:51.700> see<00:04:51.730> what

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:51.970 
our list go to 2nd graph and see what

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:53.730 
our list go to 2nd graph and see what
our<00:04:52.000> table<00:04:52.420> looks<00:04:52.630> like<00:04:52.870> we're<00:04:53.560> going<00:04:53.680> to

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:53.740 
our table looks like we're going to

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:55.290 
our table looks like we're going to
start<00:04:53.920> at<00:04:54.010> negative<00:04:54.130> 2<00:04:54.400> and<00:04:54.580> when<00:04:54.940> we<00:04:55.060> plug<00:04:55.270> in

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:55.300 
start at negative 2 and when we plug in

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:59.460 
start at negative 2 and when we plug in
a<00:04:55.480> negative<00:04:55.660> 2<00:04:56.050> we<00:04:56.260> get<00:04:56.440> roughly<00:04:56.830> a<00:04:57.690> point<00:04:58.690> 45

00:04:59.460 --> 00:04:59.470 
a negative 2 we get roughly a point 45

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:01.770 
a negative 2 we get roughly a point 45
when<00:05:00.220> plug<00:05:00.400> in<00:05:00.520> a<00:05:00.550> negative<00:05:00.670> 1<00:05:01.090> we<00:05:01.270> get<00:05:01.390> roughly

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:01.780 
when plug in a negative 1 we get roughly

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:04.530 
when plug in a negative 1 we get roughly
point<00:05:02.380> 9<00:05:02.560> for<00:05:02.890> when<00:05:03.220> we<00:05:03.370> plug<00:05:03.520> in<00:05:03.580> 20<00:05:04.000> we<00:05:04.150> get<00:05:04.300> to

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:04.540 
point 9 for when we plug in 20 we get to

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:08.220 
point 9 for when we plug in 20 we get to
when<00:05:05.260> we<00:05:05.380> plug<00:05:05.590> in<00:05:05.680> a<00:05:05.740> 1<00:05:06.000> we<00:05:07.000> end<00:05:07.300> up<00:05:07.510> with<00:05:07.540> four

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:08.230 
when we plug in a 1 we end up with four

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:10.200 
when we plug in a 1 we end up with four
point<00:05:08.560> two<00:05:08.770> three<00:05:09.160> and<00:05:09.430> when<00:05:09.700> we<00:05:09.820> plug<00:05:10.030> in<00:05:10.150> a

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:10.210 
point two three and when we plug in a

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:13.380 
point two three and when we plug in a
two<00:05:10.419> we<00:05:10.660> end<00:05:10.780> up<00:05:10.900> with<00:05:11.460> 8.96<00:05:12.460> so<00:05:12.820> I<00:05:12.850> go<00:05:13.090> to<00:05:13.120> graph

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:13.390 
two we end up with 8.96 so I go to graph

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:15.870 
two we end up with 8.96 so I go to graph
this<00:05:13.720> this<00:05:13.930> is<00:05:14.110> saying<00:05:14.290> i<00:05:14.440> go<00:05:14.590> over<00:05:14.640> negative<00:05:15.640> 2

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:41.280 
six which is are rightfully there and I
connect<00:05:39.760> it<00:05:39.880> with<00:05:39.970> the<00:05:40.030> line<00:05:40.300> now<00:05:40.960> keep<00:05:41.140> in

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:41.290 
connect it with the line now keep in

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:42.960 
connect it with the line now keep in
mind<00:05:41.350> white<00:05:41.830> we<00:05:42.040> talked<00:05:42.280> about<00:05:42.430> before<00:05:42.670> in<00:05:42.880> the

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:42.970 
mind white we talked about before in the

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:45.270 
mind white we talked about before in the
other<00:05:43.090> sections<00:05:43.570> where<00:05:44.260> is<00:05:44.410> the<00:05:44.560> asymptote<00:05:45.130> in

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:45.280 
other sections where is the asymptote in

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:47.930 
other sections where is the asymptote in
this<00:05:45.400> problem<00:05:45.670> well<00:05:46.300> the<00:05:46.480> asymptote<00:05:47.050> is<00:05:47.260> a

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:47.940 
this problem well the asymptote is a

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:50.700 
this problem well the asymptote is a
horizontal<00:05:48.940> asymptote<00:05:49.360> at<00:05:49.930> y<00:05:49.960> equals<00:05:50.470> zero

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:50.710 
horizontal asymptote at y equals zero

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:52.470 
horizontal asymptote at y equals zero
because<00:05:50.920> it<00:05:51.160> gets<00:05:51.280> really<00:05:51.580> really<00:05:51.850> close<00:05:52.210> to

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:52.480 
because it gets really really close to

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:54.030 
because it gets really really close to
zero<00:05:52.780> but<00:05:52.960> it<00:05:53.080> never<00:05:53.260> touches<00:05:53.590> them<00:05:53.860> once

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:54.040 
zero but it never touches them once

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:57.090 
zero but it never touches them once
again<00:05:54.630> there's<00:05:55.630> no<00:05:55.810> number<00:05:56.170> hanging<00:05:56.740> out<00:05:56.860> here

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:57.100 
again there's no number hanging out here

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:58.380 
again there's no number hanging out here
all<00:05:57.130> by<00:05:57.280> itself<00:05:57.790> that's<00:05:58.120> where<00:05:58.300> the

00:05:58.380 --> 00:05:58.390 
all by itself that's where the

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:00.450 
all by itself that's where the
horizontal<00:05:58.930> asymptote<00:05:59.410> is<00:05:59.440> so<00:06:00.160> it's<00:06:00.280> just

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:00.460 
horizontal asymptote is so it's just

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:02.370 
horizontal asymptote is so it's just
something<00:06:00.790> for<00:06:01.090> you<00:06:01.390> to<00:06:01.540> keep<00:06:01.690> in<00:06:01.870> mind<00:06:02.140> when

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:02.380 
something for you to keep in mind when

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:04.890 
something for you to keep in mind when
you're<00:06:02.620> doing<00:06:02.950> this<00:06:03.240> so<00:06:04.240> there's<00:06:04.390> no<00:06:04.540> number

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:04.900 
you're doing this so there's no number

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:06.780 
you're doing this so there's no number
which<00:06:05.110> means<00:06:05.350> it's<00:06:05.500> zero<00:06:05.800> so<00:06:06.070> it's<00:06:06.190> y<00:06:06.370> equals

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:06.790 
which means it's zero so it's y equals

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:10.200 
which means it's zero so it's y equals
zero<00:06:07.030> is<00:06:07.180> the<00:06:07.330> horizontal<00:06:07.600> asymptote<00:06:09.120> when<00:06:10.120> we

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:10.210 
zero is the horizontal asymptote when we

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:12.540 
zero is the horizontal asymptote when we
come<00:06:10.360> back<00:06:10.600> here<00:06:10.930> we're<00:06:11.080> going<00:06:11.320> to<00:06:11.530> graph<00:06:12.250> this

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:12.550 
come back here we're going to graph this

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:15.750 
come back here we're going to graph this
problem<00:06:13.090> and<00:06:13.240> finish<00:06:13.930> up<00:06:14.140> with<00:06:14.440> the<00:06:14.760> compound

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:15.760 
problem and finish up with the compound

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:18.750 
problem and finish up with the compound
interest<00:06:16.230> because<00:06:17.230> there's<00:06:17.410> a<00:06:17.470> new<00:06:17.830> interest

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:18.760 
interest because there's a new interest

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:21.300 
interest because there's a new interest
formula<00:06:19.120> that<00:06:19.270> we<00:06:19.390> can<00:06:19.600> use<00:06:19.830> so<00:06:20.830> we<00:06:20.950> come<00:06:21.130> back

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:21.310 
formula that we can use so we come back

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:23.940 
formula that we can use so we come back
we'll<00:06:21.520> talk<00:06:21.730> about<00:06:21.940> that<00:06:22.090> and<00:06:22.510> finish<00:06:22.930> up<00:06:23.080> 8.3

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:23.950 
we'll talk about that and finish up 8.3

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:27.210 
we'll talk about that and finish up 8.3
