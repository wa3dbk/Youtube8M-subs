00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:19.070
 Dear readers 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:21.500
 hello hello to all welcome to 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:24.470
 Spain we are in the region of 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:27.110
 Pamplona for a test we expected 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:29.510
 since a long time since the world 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:31.550
 of the car to be precise since the 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:34.610
 presentation of a car that was 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.960
 highly anticipated since the presentation of 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:37.030
 aef the longest size in which 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.140
 I am currently 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:41.989
 it's been two days since we've been 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.800
 driving for one of the cars I 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:44.300
 I will not really prove it 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.260
 of objectivity since I'm not hiding from you 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.140
 that I really fell in love with 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:51.120
 the car is also exhilarating 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:53.850
 admire case drive 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.649
 we started testing yesterday we had the 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.219
 chance to try all ranges of 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:01.410
 motorizations we started wisely 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:03.379
 with the entry of powertrain 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:08.100
 I will say it's not at all pejorative 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:10.590
 with both v6 v6 and six aces 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.720
 develop respectively 340 me 380 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.120
 horses 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.770
 especially a lot yesterday with the v6 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.539
 s 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.890
 which is necessarily to be coupled like all 

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:20.060
 the models from the range to a 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.969
 quickshift transmission had 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:26.350
 reports and 6 16 which benefits in addition 

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:26.350
 from the suspension to fly 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:31.210
 and I am currently 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.159
 in the points model to no longer 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:36.320
 take since this morning which is so the 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:38.750
 currency 8s 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.150
 the power goes squarely to 4,195 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.920
 horses 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.240
 so for now to make a 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.990
 little suspense on the v8 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:49.330
 i was talking more about the bcsc 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.490
 clearly with 380 horses surely the 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:54.090
 best mix that is offered by jaguar 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.679
 on light night 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.049
 largely sufficient performance 

00:01:55.679 --> 00:02:00.860
 are already denying it makes a noise that 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:03.159
 is just magic that we invest 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.140
 there is an exhaust that is active 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:06.610
 pressed a small button 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.270
 and there clearly for a v6 that you 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:08.509
 laughing 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.830
 cleaving 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.050
 the car is relatively simple to 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.220
 take in charge 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.740
 that's the kind of vehicle in which 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.570
 marc a few kilometers you feel 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:19.670
 really at home 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:21.990
 and despite the size of the car that makes 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.340
 still four meters 40 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.380
 which is one meter ninety-three 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.060
 almost wide we feel very quickly 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.380
 comfortable 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:32.080
 the biggest surprise especially it's 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:35.190
 that the car weighs about a ton 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.190
 at 50 kg depending on the engine 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.970
 and Jaguar had managed to arrive 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.140
 at such a 6 thanks to the job 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.440
 aluminum almost all the adventurous 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.640
 in aluminum they are a small road 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.890
 currently 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.190
 do it yet it's better 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.780
 despite the weight of the car despite stencil 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:54.270
 the car is doing fine 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:57.010
 well she and he is on the ground there is a 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:58.510
 forward train that hunt mind-blowing 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.230
 even if to know more the mode 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.159
 L was 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.110
 not hide that in the little ones are born 

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:05.690
 she 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:07.730
 it's magic 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:09.740
 now the v8 is in which I am 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:14.360
 currently finds as I said 495 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:17.180
 e vo 0 to 100 in 4 seconds 3,300 km h in 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.110
 limited tip please I think 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.120
 the car goes well beyond 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:23.040
 the 300 km time 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.480
 and like that a lot 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.650
 to say this ease of driving because 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.170
 that there the free kick take care a little 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.810
 more of the car including a little bit of 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.760
 stroke 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:33.760
 there is no tendency to overflow either 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:38.190
 rare yesterday but what makes it 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.190
 perhaps less homogeneous is necessary 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:40.940
 but against 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:43.190
 thing that is still magical about this 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:45.019
 car is the sound I'm going 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:48.980
 by the way, do not wait m earth 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:52.269
 let it enjoy but before that there is 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:52.269
 a magic phobia button 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.299
 which is the exhaust you'll see 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:58.769
 that we sound these amazing really 

00:03:57.299 --> 00:03:59.909
 by the way how does jaguar not get there 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:02.950
 will pass the standards 

00:03:59.909 --> 00:04:04.349
 Paris must pass in my name 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:07.780
 because just noise 

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:09.930
 clothes it starts to turn a little 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:09.930
 little 

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:18.190
 so sarah number 202 see you soon 

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:04.800
