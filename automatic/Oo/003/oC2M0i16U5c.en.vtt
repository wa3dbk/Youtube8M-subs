00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.460
 let's see how to use one 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:08.400
 shirt you take the design that you 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.679
 contact this card 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.679
 so this shirt really is 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:16.410
 very large if not so big 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.300
 just fold it slightly this way 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.490
 you are smaller there is no need and now 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.949
 we close inside we close 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:27.779
 inside we are going to close 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:29.760
 this last but we have a moment 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.929
 bent ours perfectly 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.239
 T-shirt 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:37.410
 let's see how to make a fold 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:39.840
 shirt a big sheet of cardboard 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.820
 that will be a drawer of the Ikea we have 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.129
 obtained our programs 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.039
 what interests us is to start 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:53.129
 creating two squares of the same 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:55.379
 size 72 to 25 then create a 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.180
 small piece is good at central 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:02.190
 that will make this movement in the 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:04.830
 size 36 for 25 and then create a 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.810
 Largest piece here central must 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:11.520
 be bigger and that's it then 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:14.100
 long 72 and be at least 35 if not 40 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:17.460
 inches even that the base piece 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.680
 first we go to support the 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.860
 our piece is that of 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:26.310
 size in 36 for 25 we go to 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:29.070
 so lean over central 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.650
 we put a piece of scotch we put a 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:36.710
 speech piece of tape at risk then 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:41.220
 we go here to the right and we care 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:43.290
 approximately 7 gm of more or less from 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.030
 point because it must from 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.560
 from the small piece then sector that owes us 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.030
 be the possibility then of movement 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.610
 to fold inside 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.490
 so we care about a few millimeters 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:59.990
 away once you find the right one 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:02:03.540
 away we go March 8th to block here 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:05.280
 we pull down is blocked 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:09.899
 in the same way also from this other 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:14.340
 part done this we find the movement 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:21.540
 it works and we go with our tape 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:23.490
 to stop ourselves from this we are like this 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.380
 we have the possibility to move 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:27.530
 quietly the same thing we go to 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:29.640
 do on the other side we come 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.640
 slightly distant almost some 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.780
 mm I call up 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.480
 we also verify the distance from 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:41.060
 We have that other Pope 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.060
 we specify the tape we promise here 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:50.280
 in this way we do 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:57.630
 movement to the point of game gm must 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:03:01.110
 ampiano emitted our perfect city 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:05.720
 at this point we write works a 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:05.720
 long ribbon that blocks everything 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:15.470
 and we have realized from our turn 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:19.159
 magnet everything moves to perfection 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:21.400
 let's see how bendings go 

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:24.530
 to see yet another shirt 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:27.709
 let's take the side that interests us 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:33.680
 view and we put him in contact 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:34.579
 let's see now if the shirt is a lot 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.060
 great 

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:40.970
 comes out we fold ask for a 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:42.140
 piece of sleeve is smaller 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:45.500
 there will be no need 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:49.370
 and now we close inside 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:52.030
 to hell and we're going to close laws 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:57.220
 that we have our shirt 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:57.220
 perfectly folded in this way
