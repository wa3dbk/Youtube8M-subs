00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
straight here you'll jump up by square

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.640 
straight here you'll jump up by square
and<00:01:54.300> if<00:01:54.570> you<00:01:54.720> look<00:01:54.930> down<00:01:55.140> you'll<00:01:55.440> see<00:01:55.500> all

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:55.650 
and if you look down you'll see all

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:58.220 
and if you look down you'll see all
these<00:01:55.920> little<00:01:56.190> buildings<00:01:56.730> go<00:01:57.510> straight<00:01:57.900> and

00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:58.230 
these little buildings go straight and

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:01.850 
these little buildings go straight and
then<00:01:58.460> jump<00:01:59.460> right<00:01:59.640> off<00:01:59.700> of<00:01:59.910> it<00:02:00.620> you'll<00:02:01.620> lose

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
then jump right off of it you'll lose

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.240 
then jump right off of it you'll lose
somehow<00:02:02.310> uh<00:02:02.340> I<00:02:02.850> guess<00:02:03.360> it's<00:02:03.570> all<00:02:03.720> right<00:02:04.250> again

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
somehow uh I guess it's all right again

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
should try and spring from building to

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.410 
should try and spring from building to
building<00:02:28.800> just<00:02:29.490> to<00:02:29.610> make<00:02:29.820> sure<00:02:29.850> that<00:02:30.270> you'll

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
over the buildings do some crazy jumps

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.040 
over the buildings do some crazy jumps
or<00:02:37.440> sniper<00:02:37.950> or<00:02:38.850> even<00:02:39.180> if<00:02:39.270> you<00:02:39.420> continue<00:02:39.900> going

or sniper or even if you continue going
to<00:02:40.170> the<00:02:40.320> anterior<00:02:40.770> try<00:02:41.520> not<00:02:41.670> to<00:02:41.820> go<00:02:41.940> too<00:02:42.209> fast

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
to the anterior try not to go too fast

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.400 
to the anterior try not to go too fast
you'll<00:02:43.530> see<00:02:43.800> a<00:02:43.830> green<00:02:44.190> rail<00:02:44.550> if<00:02:45.239> you<00:02:45.780> could<00:02:46.080> go

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
you'll see a green rail if you could go

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.080 
you'll see a green rail if you could go
all<00:02:46.620> the<00:02:46.830> way<00:02:46.860> to<00:02:46.980> the<00:02:47.280> left<00:02:47.310> side<00:02:47.880> of<00:02:47.910> the

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
all the way to the left side of the

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.260 
all the way to the left side of the
building<00:02:48.600> right<00:02:48.630> here<00:02:48.900> this<00:02:49.410> pipe<00:02:50.160> is<00:02:50.459> when

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 
building right here this pipe is when

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:53.810 
building right here this pipe is when
you<00:02:51.390> get<00:02:51.510> there<00:02:51.870> try<00:02:52.709> and<00:02:52.860> sprint<00:02:53.250> and<00:02:53.520> jump

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 
you get there try and sprint and jump

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:57.470 
you get there try and sprint and jump
it's<00:02:54.780> your<00:02:55.050> luck<00:02:55.320> if<00:02:55.560> you<00:02:56.070> get<00:02:56.280> to<00:02:56.520> it<00:02:56.670> now<00:02:57.330> if

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
it's your luck if you get to it now if

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.390 
it's your luck if you get to it now if
you<00:02:57.600> go<00:02:57.720> left<00:02:57.989> it's<00:02:58.260> a<00:02:58.350> dead<00:02:58.560> end<00:02:58.590> if<00:02:59.040> you<00:02:59.250> go

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
you go left it's a dead end if you go

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.160 
you go left it's a dead end if you go
right<00:02:59.640> it's<00:02:59.880> kind<00:03:00.150> of<00:03:00.209> the<00:03:00.330> better<00:03:00.540> area

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
right it's kind of the better area

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:02.870 
right it's kind of the better area
because<00:03:01.770> you<00:03:01.890> continue<00:03:02.400> there's<00:03:02.610> another

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
because you continue there's another

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.180 
because you continue there's another
rail<00:03:03.240> but<00:03:03.569> it's<00:03:03.750> quite<00:03:03.959> hard<00:03:04.170> to<00:03:04.260> get<00:03:04.500> up<00:03:04.650> to<00:03:04.950> it

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
rail but it's quite hard to get up to it

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.920 
rail but it's quite hard to get up to it
and<00:03:05.690> then<00:03:06.690> you<00:03:07.590> get<00:03:07.739> into<00:03:08.040> the<00:03:08.160> city<00:03:08.190> now<00:03:08.930> we

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
and then you get into the city now we

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.830 
and then you get into the city now we
could<00:03:10.110> and<00:03:10.880> then<00:03:11.880> we'll<00:03:12.090> show<00:03:12.330> you<00:03:12.360> on<00:03:12.630> the<00:03:12.810> map

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
could and then we'll show you on the map

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.650 
could and then we'll show you on the map
or<00:03:13.349> this<00:03:13.560> part<00:03:13.950> is<00:03:14.160> located<00:03:14.849> it's<00:03:15.360> in<00:03:15.569> the

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
or this part is located it's in the

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.050 
or this part is located it's in the
first<00:03:15.959> CD<00:03:16.290> so<00:03:16.650> it<00:03:16.920> doesn't<00:03:17.280> really<00:03:17.340> matter<00:03:17.670> if

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
first CD so it doesn't really matter if

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.320 
first CD so it doesn't really matter if
you<00:03:18.270> just<00:03:18.510> started<00:03:19.550> ok<00:03:20.550> this<00:03:20.730> is<00:03:20.910> the<00:03:20.940> city
