00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
yet so just scrolling through I don't

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.690 
yet so just scrolling through I don't
think<00:02:26.570> no<00:02:27.500> so<00:02:28.040> if<00:02:28.130> you're<00:02:28.220> just<00:02:28.280> going<00:02:28.580> in

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
think no so if you're just going in

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.160 
think no so if you're just going in
there<00:02:28.820> looking<00:02:29.180> for<00:02:29.390> it<00:02:29.540> or<00:02:29.690> you've<00:02:29.840> looked<00:02:29.990> in
