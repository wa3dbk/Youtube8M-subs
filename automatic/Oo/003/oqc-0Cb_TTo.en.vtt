00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
frost less evolution I was like making

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.139 
frost less evolution I was like making
this<00:00:37.140> work<00:00:37.380> so<00:00:38.190> if<00:00:38.250> we<00:00:38.340> look<00:00:38.489> at<00:00:38.640> frost<00:00:38.969> less

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
this work so if we look at frost less

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.350 
this work so if we look at frost less
the<00:00:39.270> stats<00:00:39.540> to<00:00:39.690> make<00:00:40.200> it<00:00:40.350> work<00:00:40.500> there's<00:00:41.370> not<00:00:41.969> a

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
the stats to make it work there's not a

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.930 
the stats to make it work there's not a
lot<00:00:43.170> to<00:00:43.200> work<00:00:43.590> with<00:00:43.800> we<00:00:43.950> don't<00:00:44.129> have<00:00:44.250> an<00:00:44.399> insane

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
lot to work with we don't have an insane

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.299 
lot to work with we don't have an insane
amount<00:00:45.210> of<00:00:45.270> special<00:00:45.600> attack<00:00:45.840> and<00:00:46.110> we<00:00:46.649> have<00:00:47.280> a

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
amount of special attack and we have a

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.670 
amount of special attack and we have a
really<00:00:47.640> respectable<00:00:48.149> speed<00:00:48.510> but<00:00:48.840> right<00:00:49.469> now

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
really respectable speed but right now

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.500 
really respectable speed but right now
with<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.100> way<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.340> game<00:00:50.489> is<00:00:50.730> after<00:00:51.239> like

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
with the way the game is after like

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:52.970 
with the way the game is after like
fifth<00:00:51.719> and<00:00:51.870> sixth<00:00:52.110> generation<00:00:52.140> there's

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
fifth and sixth generation there's

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.880 
fifth and sixth generation there's
almost<00:00:53.550> a<00:00:53.820> lot<00:00:53.910> better<00:00:54.149> options<00:00:54.770> Pokemon<00:00:55.770> that

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
almost a lot better options Pokemon that

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.470 
almost a lot better options Pokemon that
are<00:00:56.010> faster<00:00:56.430> that<00:00:56.610> hit<00:00:56.760> harder<00:00:57.059> with<00:00:57.210> higher

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
are faster that hit harder with higher

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.590 
are faster that hit harder with higher
attack<00:00:57.840> or<00:00:58.109> special<00:00:58.469> attack<00:00:59.239> it's<00:01:00.239> really

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
attack or special attack it's really

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.599 
attack or special attack it's really
tough<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:01.020> main<00:01:01.680> thing<00:01:01.890> that<00:01:01.920> frost<00:01:02.280> loss<00:01:02.430> has

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
tough the main thing that frost loss has

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.560 
tough the main thing that frost loss has
going<00:01:02.850> for<00:01:02.969> it<00:01:03.329> or<00:01:03.619> you<00:01:04.619> know<00:01:04.739> her<00:01:05.010> is<00:01:05.280> that<00:01:05.850> ice

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
going for it or you know her is that ice

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.460 
going for it or you know her is that ice
beam<00:01:07.310> not<00:01:08.310> maybe<00:01:08.520> Pokemon<00:01:09.060> are<00:01:09.330> going<00:01:10.229> to<00:01:10.380> be

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
beam not maybe Pokemon are going to be

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.260 
beam not maybe Pokemon are going to be
able<00:01:10.560> to<00:01:10.710> have<00:01:10.799> that<00:01:10.950> ghost<00:01:11.250> typing<00:01:11.700> with<00:01:12.119> an

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
able to have that ghost typing with an

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.359 
able to have that ghost typing with an
ice<00:01:12.390> type<00:01:12.689> attack<00:01:12.990> and<00:01:13.260> that<00:01:13.530> level<00:01:13.770> of<00:01:14.040> speed

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
ice type attack and that level of speed

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.370 
ice type attack and that level of speed
so<00:01:15.000> you<00:01:15.090> do<00:01:15.450> have<00:01:15.630> a<00:01:15.659> good<00:01:15.900> advantage<00:01:16.110> here

at a frost lass
that's<00:02:31.470> pretty<00:02:31.739> much<00:02:31.829> the<00:02:31.980> combo<00:02:32.310> you<00:02:32.879> bring

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 
that's pretty much the combo you bring

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:34.789 
that's pretty much the combo you bring
it<00:02:33.360> in<00:02:33.480> on<00:02:33.629> one<00:02:33.810> of<00:02:33.840> the<00:02:33.930> dragon<00:02:34.349> types<00:02:34.530> they're

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
so or I'm focused ashed or they just

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.350 
so or I'm focused ashed or they just
might<00:02:40.319> think<00:02:40.530> they're<00:02:40.620> faster<00:02:41.040> and<00:02:41.310> you<00:02:42.060> score

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
might think they're faster and you score

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.600 
might think they're faster and you score
an<00:02:42.450> easy<00:02:42.540> ko<00:02:42.900> or<00:02:43.349> they<00:02:43.739> switch<00:02:44.040> you<00:02:44.220> get<00:02:44.370> free

an easy ko or they switch you get free
damage<00:02:44.940> and<00:02:45.090> then<00:02:45.239> you<00:02:45.329> try<00:02:45.510> to<00:02:45.569> use<00:02:45.750> a<00:02:45.780> super

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769 
ball to try to pick up there's the

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:51.619 
ball to try to pick up there's the
Pokemon<00:02:50.129> that<00:02:50.220> they<00:02:50.370> just<00:02:50.819> switched<00:02:51.060> out<00:02:51.269> and

00:02:51.619 --> 00:02:51.629 
Pokemon that they just switched out and

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:54.140 
Pokemon that they just switched out and
then<00:02:52.470> after<00:02:52.920> that<00:02:53.010> you<00:02:53.190> get<00:02:53.310> a<00:02:53.370> destiny<00:02:53.730> bog<00:02:53.879> so

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
then after that you get a destiny bog so

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:55.940 
then after that you get a destiny bog so
I<00:02:54.480> try<00:02:54.810> to<00:02:54.870> play<00:02:55.049> frost<00:02:55.319> lofts<00:02:55.500> at<00:02:55.620> least<00:02:55.829> a

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
I try to play frost lofts at least a

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.440 
I try to play frost lofts at least a
one-for-one<00:02:56.310> with<00:02:56.579> that<00:02:56.700> destiny<00:02:57.030> bond<00:02:57.180> and

one-for-one with that destiny bond and

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.270 
one-for-one with that destiny bond and
then<00:02:58.079> after<00:02:58.409> that<00:02:58.560> if<00:02:58.650> you<00:02:58.680> can<00:02:58.950> make<00:02:59.099> it<00:02:59.220> a

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
then after that if you can make it a

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.880 
then after that if you can make it a
two-for-one<00:02:59.640> it's<00:03:00.319> that's<00:03:01.319> strong<00:03:01.709> right

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
two-for-one it's that's strong right

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.380 
two-for-one it's that's strong right
there<00:03:02.069> that<00:03:02.250> means<00:03:02.430> you<00:03:02.549> already<00:03:02.790> have<00:03:03.150> a
