evening there are some dead bees but

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.180 
evening there are some dead bees but
that<00:00:33.960> was<00:00:34.140> probably<00:00:34.380> caused<00:00:34.860> by<00:00:34.860> the

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
that was probably caused by the

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.560 
that was probably caused by the
transport<00:00:35.850> coming<00:00:36.239> all<00:00:36.359> the<00:00:36.449> way<00:00:36.480> from

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
transport coming all the way from

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.840 
transport coming all the way from
California<00:00:37.190> they<00:00:38.190> are<00:00:38.370> probably<00:00:38.579> died<00:00:38.820> of

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
California they are probably died of

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.150 
California they are probably died of
stress<00:00:39.390> and<00:00:39.660> when<00:00:40.379> we<00:00:40.500> put<00:00:40.680> them<00:00:40.800> in<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:40.980> hive

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
stress and when we put them in the hive

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.520 
stress and when we put them in the hive
the<00:00:41.190> bees<00:00:41.609> will<00:00:42.420> clean<00:00:42.690> out<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:43.140> dead<00:00:43.320> bees

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
the bees will clean out the dead bees

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.410 
the bees will clean out the dead bees
