00:00:01.249 --> 00:00:03.500
 that one did not work at all my dad Manfort though 

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:07.589
 Strictly my dad was very strict Google or it would have been fun many that was funny 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:10.190
 is a weird combination that's why I'm probably next today 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:13.449
 crisis 

00:00:13.449 --> 00:00:14.960
 but the Hainleite routes 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:18.990
 and outbound the authoritarian of the existing statutes what do you mean 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:19.750
 spend 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:22.150
 on a tip about accident risk me 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:24.070
 the fourth of the 70 may 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.070
 I have not publicly promised swiftly spoken to the widow 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.260
 and then he had tried to learn through father the pictures were studied 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.730
 But man for german language keeps me on the line to make whole 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.590
 that 70 years living in Germany did not think the chance that she 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.590
 the password 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.690
 and even if he can not handle that he will probably never try to table like that 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.530
 he had to mimic the hit rate was my dad but 60 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:50.600
 percent 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.600
 the city of Stuttgart in the Growth Act 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.550
 The city is always good 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.240
 that was a very bitter situation, yes, there are sometimes insulting of the accounts 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:03.240
 struck me say the stage claim of the 8th 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.220
 Before I always had to 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.450
 worldwide, Porsche is coming 11 com 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.730
 not just on stage we want 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:16.730
 also as the University of Bochum foreground 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:27.540
 only five times sold the biplane so to speak to Sendlinger 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:28.250
 Tor stormed 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.300
 Angelo to me and then always so funny things language spoken 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:36.030
 brought as a compote from the op-table own good you see in the future with 3 4 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.730
 it gets further from the Popper but what their language 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:44.960
 with her will be even if the stern of the author would be the recordings 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.950
 the art did not offend the exact course could come why swapped 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.700
 still good thing 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.869
 he always had to do as a kid because my dad upset it a bit 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:01:59.869
 would have exceeded 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:03.500
 and also the use but also very happy to say next to I like you 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.500
 broken did not like the ski areas 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:09.599
 it was so favorite phrase Miep Gies 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.930
 today's a serious robbery in any situation one unpacked this is the 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.199
 League is 

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:17.290
 I have no idea where this comes from, I would always be there in Winterthur 

00:02:17.289 --> 00:02:20.709
 also managed what the plan with him enough or better 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:23.709
 he is indeed making their tomatoes for lighting 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:28.209
 Father then gets the he previously coded so coded 6 percent hit rate he and 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:30.510
 he always said Edis on every occasion 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.739
 Of course most Wersauer was yes 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:36.750
 These are the same pieces of praise 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:41.959
 because the movies 

00:02:54.649 --> 00:02:57.649
 Grisham bike I'm going cycling 

00:02:58.629 --> 00:02:59.959
 supposedly supposed to be the choice
