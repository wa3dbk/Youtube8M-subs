00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.620
 20 

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:13.250
 The next step is doing the application of Baku Chu 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:16.340
 This is easy to do 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:19.770
 Also I am wondering I might try another soon to go to the next trick 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:21.460
 I would like to teach you techniques 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.840
 mother 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:27.110
 It is called back layout 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:29.360
 Well-known so-called Tatsu of Baku 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:32.830
 I am not straight 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.830
 So as not to stick your hands in the meat bone tea 

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:39.310
 This is something like this 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:42.510
 Unlike a little backflip 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:44.360
 How to fly also Baku Chu and together 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.980
 But 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:50.460
 I am very prime minister 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.660
 Where I saw the ground all the way along 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.490
 place 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:57.520
 Start this time your feet do not go up 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:59.200
 Firmly coming down straight 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:02.160
 It becomes tricks say 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:07.310
 This is very abdominal muscle 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:08.650
 One person who got used to the product because it is a skill that uses muscle great 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.159
 further 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:12.050
 this 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:17.480
 Cycle 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:19.200
 If you roll your feet and land one leg at a time , you wo n't say this is a flush kick 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:22.140
 Hmm 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:26.260
 The point of the flash kick 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:32.090
 In the same way back footsteps as before 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:36.320
 Consciousness that leaves the field foot when coming down the foot 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:39.759
 Before the body falls at the time of the last landing 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.759
 Come one foot 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:45.750
 It is a family story and the tenth episode 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.549
 It entered the barefoot have 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.960
 My feet came from behind 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:53.159
 At the same time to this hear you want to do 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:55.640
 I'll wake up my half 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.860
 Will be really 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:01.800
 this is 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:04.950
 The ground is more than in the so-called park so far 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.890
 Because the face becomes a technique close to the ground 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:11.280
 Oh dear 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:14.580
 It is a very dangerous technique, so the basics of opening well 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:25.370
 Please try while holding down 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:29.950

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:38.400
