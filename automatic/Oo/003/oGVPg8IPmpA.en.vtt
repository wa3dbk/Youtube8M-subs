take
oh<00:00:31.340> okay<00:00:32.390> so<00:00:33.390> I<00:00:33.450> go<00:00:33.600> ahead<00:00:33.660> and<00:00:33.750> pause<00:00:33.989> this

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:36.890 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:38.869 

well<00:00:37.890> that's<00:00:38.070> some

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
well that's some

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.799 
well that's some
apparently<00:00:39.840> I<00:00:40.230> can't<00:00:40.670> update<00:00:41.670> because<00:00:42.000> I<00:00:42.300> got

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
apparently I can't update because I got

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.830 
apparently I can't update because I got
disconnected<00:00:43.200> somehow<00:00:43.649> maybe<00:00:44.040> this<00:00:44.840> asshole

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
disconnected somehow maybe this asshole

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.470 
disconnected somehow maybe this asshole
keep<00:00:46.110> that<00:00:46.910> go<00:00:47.910> ahead<00:00:47.969> and<00:00:48.090> get<00:00:48.270> some<00:00:48.390> more

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
keep that go ahead and get some more

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:49.900 
keep that go ahead and get some more
internets

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:49.910 
internets

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.900 
internets
okay<00:00:50.910> so<00:00:51.809> I<00:00:51.840> got<00:00:52.079> some<00:00:52.320> Internet's<00:00:52.789> it<00:00:53.789> was

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
okay so I got some Internet's it was

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.150 
okay so I got some Internet's it was
able<00:00:54.300> to<00:00:54.329> verify<00:00:56.480> no<00:00:57.480> it's<00:00:57.719> gonna<00:00:57.899> put<00:00:58.859> me<00:00:59.010> on<00:00:59.129> a

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
able to verify no it's gonna put me on a

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.590 
able to verify no it's gonna put me on a
status<00:00:59.640> screen<00:01:00.300> thingy<00:01:02.030> from<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.180> experience

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
status screen thingy from the experience

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.899 
status screen thingy from the experience
that's<00:01:03.719> probably<00:01:03.809> gonna<00:01:04.110> take<00:01:04.350> forever<00:01:06.619> and

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:07.909 
that's probably gonna take forever and

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:10.280 
that's probably gonna take forever and
while<00:01:08.909> you're<00:01:09.090> waiting<00:01:09.630> for<00:01:09.720> it<00:01:09.869> to<00:01:09.900> install

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
while you're waiting for it to install

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.080 
while you're waiting for it to install
you<00:01:10.500> have<00:01:10.650> to<00:01:10.799> be<00:01:11.040> careful<00:01:11.430> that<00:01:11.610> you're<00:01:12.060> not

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
you have to be careful that you're not

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.200 
you have to be careful that you're not
invaded<00:01:12.570> by<00:01:12.780> an<00:01:12.960> army<00:01:13.260> of<00:01:13.290> zombies<00:01:14.150> they<00:01:15.150> do

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
invaded by an army of zombies they do

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.999 
invaded by an army of zombies they do
have<00:01:15.479> a<00:01:15.540> tendency<00:01:16.020> to<00:01:16.049> crawl<00:01:16.560> up<00:01:16.740> onto<00:01:16.950> your

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
have a tendency to crawl up onto your

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.850 
have a tendency to crawl up onto your
iPhone<00:01:17.430> you<00:01:18.150> should<00:01:18.299> broke<00:01:18.450> some<00:01:18.630> away<00:01:18.860> any

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
iPhone you should broke some away any

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.890 
iPhone you should broke some away any
chance<00:01:19.920> you<00:01:20.250> get<00:01:20.450> so<00:01:21.450> they<00:01:21.570> don't<00:01:21.720> interfere

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
chance you get so they don't interfere

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.190 
chance you get so they don't interfere
with<00:01:22.110> installation<00:01:22.680> process

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 
with installation process

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.090 
with installation process
yeah<00:01:25.200> it's<00:01:25.409> taken<00:01:25.799> quite<00:01:26.009> a<00:01:26.130> long<00:01:26.430> time<00:01:26.700> I

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100 
yeah it's taken quite a long time I

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.030 
yeah it's taken quite a long time I
might<00:01:29.100> as<00:01:29.189> well<00:01:29.310> use<00:01:29.759> this<00:01:29.939> opportunity<00:01:30.689> to

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:31.040 
might as well use this opportunity to

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.200 
might as well use this opportunity to
mention<00:01:32.040> that<00:01:32.400> some<00:01:32.579> people<00:01:32.820> they<00:01:32.909> like<00:01:32.939> to

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
mention that some people they like to

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.569 
mention that some people they like to
complain<00:01:33.659> that<00:01:33.689> these<00:01:34.110> rubber<00:01:34.770> cases<00:01:35.280> are<00:01:35.430> too

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
complain that these rubber cases are too

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.230 
complain that these rubber cases are too
thick<00:01:37.070> actually<00:01:38.070> in<00:01:38.220> some<00:01:38.430> circumstances

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
thick actually in some circumstances

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.510 
thick actually in some circumstances
that's<00:01:39.390> actually<00:01:39.780> caused<00:01:40.159> let<00:01:41.159> me<00:01:41.280> go<00:01:41.400> ahead

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
that's actually caused let me go ahead

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.850 
that's actually caused let me go ahead
and<00:01:41.759> started<00:01:42.450> to<00:01:42.540> do<00:01:42.600> this<00:01:42.720> with<00:01:42.869> one<00:01:43.020> hand<00:01:45.860> so

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
and started to do this with one hand so

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.920 
and started to do this with one hand so
you<00:01:46.920> just<00:01:47.399> kind<00:01:47.670> of<00:01:47.729> pull<00:01:48.060> it<00:01:48.180> out<00:01:48.329> you

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
you just kind of pull it out you

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.870 
you just kind of pull it out you
actually<00:01:49.049> find<00:01:49.470> it<00:01:49.729> sometimes<00:01:50.729> there's

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
actually find it sometimes there's

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.620 
actually find it sometimes there's
actually<00:01:51.060> another<00:01:51.420> iPhone<00:01:52.070> underneath<00:01:53.070> it<00:01:53.630> so

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
actually another iPhone underneath it so

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:55.580 
actually another iPhone underneath it so
that's<00:01:54.780> why<00:01:54.899> it's<00:01:55.049> so<00:01:55.140> thick<00:01:55.409> sometimes

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
that's why it's so thick sometimes

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.459 
that's why it's so thick sometimes
there's<00:01:56.100> just<00:01:56.240> layers<00:01:57.240> of<00:01:57.420> iPhones<00:01:57.899> stacked

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
there's just layers of iPhones stacked

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.560 
there's just layers of iPhones stacked
into<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:58.770> same<00:01:58.979> case<00:01:59.219> so<00:02:00.149> that's<00:02:00.240> why<00:02:00.390> it's

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
into the same case so that's why it's

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.690 
into the same case so that's why it's
thick<00:02:01.369> so<00:02:02.369> that's<00:02:02.520> not<00:02:02.640> always<00:02:02.759> a<00:02:02.850> downside

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.760 

but<00:02:06.000> again<00:02:06.180> you<00:02:06.270> should<00:02:06.300> be<00:02:06.510> careful<00:02:06.990> that<00:02:07.680> you

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
but again you should be careful that you

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.510 
but again you should be careful that you
don't<00:02:07.800> put<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:08.820> second<00:02:09.390> iPhone<00:02:10.289> back<00:02:11.160> into<00:02:11.490> a

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
don't put the second iPhone back into a

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.680 
don't put the second iPhone back into a
case<00:02:11.810> first<00:02:13.430> because<00:02:14.430> that<00:02:15.090> can<00:02:15.360> cause<00:02:15.540> it<00:02:15.660> to

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
case first because that can cause it to

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.910 
case first because that can cause it to
multiply<00:02:16.230> you<00:02:16.920> know<00:02:17.040> this<00:02:17.540> end<00:02:18.540> up<00:02:18.660> with

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
multiply you know this end up with

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.320 
multiply you know this end up with
iPhones<00:02:19.920> after<00:02:20.160> iPhones<00:02:20.460> until<00:02:20.820> they<00:02:20.940> get<00:02:21.120> so

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
iPhones after iPhones until they get so

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.480 
iPhones after iPhones until they get so
packed<00:02:21.600> tightly<00:02:21.959> that<00:02:22.290> they<00:02:22.560> begin<00:02:22.950> cracking

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
packed tightly that they begin cracking

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:32.230 
packed tightly that they begin cracking
you<00:02:24.390> don't<00:02:24.570> know<00:02:24.830> so<00:02:26.990> you<00:02:27.990> should<00:02:29.930> be<00:02:30.930> careful

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:32.240 
you don't know so you should be careful

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.370 
you don't know so you should be careful
you<00:02:33.240> don't<00:02:33.270> want<00:02:33.420> to<00:02:33.690> end<00:02:33.959> up<00:02:34.050> with<00:02:34.140> too<00:02:34.290> many

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
you don't want to end up with too many

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:40.940 
you don't want to end up with too many
iPhones<00:02:36.290> all<00:02:37.290> right<00:02:39.200> there's<00:02:40.200> now<00:02:40.380> update

iPhones all right there's now update
completed<00:02:42.709> enable<00:02:43.709> location<00:02:44.340> I<00:02:46.459> had<00:02:47.459> to<00:02:47.580> put
