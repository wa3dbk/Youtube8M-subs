a gold standard I mean I would think

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.890 
a gold standard I mean I would think
that<00:04:19.830> they<00:04:20.100> shouldn't<00:04:20.340> be<00:04:20.489> holding<00:04:20.669> it<00:04:20.970> the

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
that they shouldn't be holding it the

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:22.770 
that they shouldn't be holding it the
reason<00:04:22.229> i<00:04:22.320> asked

reason i asked

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.220 
reason i asked
is<00:04:23.100> the<00:04:24.100> truth<00:04:24.370> is<00:04:24.670> is<00:04:24.970> gold<00:04:25.240> his<00:04:25.510> money<00:04:25.870> and

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:26.230 
is the truth is is gold his money and

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:28.410 
is the truth is is gold his money and
people<00:04:26.470> don't<00:04:26.860> throw<00:04:27.310> it<00:04:27.430> away<00:04:27.490> and<00:04:27.700> people<00:04:28.270> do

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:28.420 
people don't throw it away and people do

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:32.010 
people don't throw it away and people do
cling<00:04:28.900> to<00:04:29.200> it<00:04:29.440> and<00:04:29.710> but<00:04:30.520> I<00:04:30.550> would<00:04:31.000> be<00:04:31.270> really

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.020 
cling to it and but I would be really

00:05:33.719 --> 00:05:33.729 
the year 2000 if they held on they

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:35.730 
the year 2000 if they held on they
probably<00:05:33.970> haven't<00:05:34.180> even<00:05:34.630> broken<00:05:34.960> even<00:05:35.530> it

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:35.740 
probably haven't even broken even it

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:38.100
