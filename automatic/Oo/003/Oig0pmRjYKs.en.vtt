00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
I think they're here to stay but I think

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:42.530 
I think they're here to stay but I think
there's<00:03:41.280> going<00:03:41.370> to<00:03:41.459> be<00:03:41.489> a<00:03:41.549> lot<00:03:41.940> of<00:03:41.970> questions

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:48.970 
before they build again
and<00:03:47.540> what<00:03:47.960> I'm<00:03:48.080> hoping<00:03:48.290> what<00:03:48.590> comes<00:03:48.800> out<00:03:48.950> of
