actually got a very large area of effect
which<00:00:24.210> would<00:00:24.390> make<00:00:24.510> it<00:00:24.720> a<00:00:24.840> really<00:00:25.350> good<00:00:25.500> skill

these rune effects are going to see for

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.069 
these rune effects are going to see for
this<00:00:44.309> one<00:00:44.550> are<00:00:44.789> not<00:00:45.059> that<00:00:45.390> different<00:00:45.450> from<00:00:45.870> the

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
this one are not that different from the

this one are not that different from the
original<00:00:46.110> as<00:00:46.590> you<00:00:47.039> can<00:00:47.129> see<00:00:47.280> there's<00:00:47.460> a<00:00:47.550> little

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
original as you can see there's a little

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.279 
original as you can see there's a little
bit<00:00:47.820> of<00:00:47.879> color<00:00:48.149> change<00:00:48.539> and<00:00:48.840> stuff<00:00:49.050> like<00:00:49.230> that

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:51.980 
on this basically right here would be

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.889 
on this basically right here would be
good<00:00:52.980> for<00:00:53.399> higher<00:00:54.030> difficulties<00:00:54.750> where

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899

difficulties if you're trying to do some

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.000 
difficulties if you're trying to do some

would<00:01:14.159> be<00:01:14.280> a<00:01:14.310> really<00:01:14.580> good<00:01:14.790> clear<00:01:15.119> out<00:01:15.270> as<00:01:15.479> you

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
would be a really good clear out as you

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.200 
would be a really good clear out as you
can<00:01:16.350> tell<00:01:16.590> though<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:17.100> cooldown<00:01:17.580> on<00:01:17.610> this<00:01:18.000> is

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
can tell though the cooldown on this is

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.300 
can tell though the cooldown on this is
rather<00:01:18.570> significant<00:01:19.409> you<00:01:19.500> can't<00:01:19.740> just<00:01:19.950> spam

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
rather significant you can't just spam

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.609 
rather significant you can't just spam
this<00:01:20.580> over<00:01:20.909> and<00:01:21.000> over<00:01:21.090> and<00:01:21.299> over<00:01:21.390> this<00:01:22.380> right

this over and over and over this right
here<00:01:23.009> is<00:01:23.040> basically<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:24.090> obsidian<00:01:24.540> room

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
here is basically the obsidian room

here is basically the obsidian room
stone<00:01:25.020> and<00:01:25.229> it<00:01:25.350> will<00:01:25.500> randomly<00:01:26.430> give<00:01:26.759> the

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
stone and it will randomly give the

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.700 
stone and it will randomly give the
enemies<00:01:27.570> that<00:01:27.689> are<00:01:27.750> inside<00:01:28.170> the<00:01:28.500> wave<00:01:28.680> of

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.850 
cool it's a cool effect as you can see
it's<00:01:35.340> like<00:01:35.460> a<00:01:35.490> purplish<00:01:36.000> pink<00:01:36.030> wave<00:01:36.509> but<00:01:37.500> as

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
it's like a purplish pink wave but as

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.260 
it's like a purplish pink wave but as
far<00:01:38.070> as<00:01:38.130> them<00:01:38.369> teleporting<00:01:38.909> I<00:01:38.970> don't<00:01:39.119> know<00:01:39.180> if

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
far as them teleporting I don't know if

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.670 
far as them teleporting I don't know if
they<00:01:39.360> can<00:01:39.420> teleport<00:01:39.840> closer<00:01:40.170> or<00:01:40.470> if<00:01:40.560> they

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
they can teleport closer or if they

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.260 
they can teleport closer or if they
teleport<00:01:41.159> farther<00:01:41.400> away<00:01:41.549> it's<00:01:41.820> hard<00:01:42.090> to

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
teleport farther away it's hard to

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.450 
teleport farther away it's hard to
determine<00:01:42.540> with<00:01:43.470> this<00:01:43.680> little<00:01:43.920> little

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
determine with this little little

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.359 
determine with this little little
preview<00:01:44.790> I<00:01:45.000> have<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:46.020> indigo<00:01:46.409> runestone<00:01:47.009> it

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
preview I have the indigo runestone it

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.060 
preview I have the indigo runestone it
gives<00:01:48.000> a<00:01:48.360> hundred<00:01:49.140> percent<00:01:49.229> chance<00:01:49.590> to<00:01:49.860> cause

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
gives a hundred percent chance to cause

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.300 
gives a hundred percent chance to cause
a<00:01:50.430> smaller<00:01:51.360> wave<00:01:51.630> of<00:01:51.840> force<00:01:52.110> on<00:01:52.320> enemies<00:01:52.829> so

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
a smaller wave of force on enemies so

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.219 
a smaller wave of force on enemies so
it's<00:01:53.490> almost<00:01:53.610> like<00:01:53.820> it<00:01:54.000> can<00:01:54.149> chain<00:01:54.450> like

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
it's almost like it can chain like

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.050 
it's almost like it can chain like
you'll<00:01:55.380> drop<00:01:55.680> it<00:01:55.890> and<00:01:56.009> then<00:01:56.130> it'll<00:01:56.280> do<00:01:56.520> smaller

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
you'll drop it and then it'll do smaller

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.580 
you'll drop it and then it'll do smaller
wave<00:01:57.329> of<00:01:57.509> forces<00:01:57.840> on<00:01:57.960> every<00:01:58.200> enemy<00:01:58.350> it<00:01:58.560> hits

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
wave of forces on every enemy it hits

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.819 
wave of forces on every enemy it hits
for<00:01:59.540> 102<00:02:00.540> percent<00:02:00.960> weapon<00:02:01.229> damage<00:02:01.350> which<00:02:01.710> is

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
for 102 percent weapon damage which is

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.780 
for 102 percent weapon damage which is
still<00:02:02.040> not<00:02:02.310> that<00:02:02.520> bad<00:02:02.700> the<00:02:03.360> last<00:02:03.630> one<00:02:03.899> is<00:02:04.229> the

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:04.790 
still not that bad the last one is the

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.520 
still not that bad the last one is the
golden<00:02:05.790> runestone<00:02:06.240> it<00:02:06.450> reduces<00:02:06.930> your<00:02:07.049> casting

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
golden runestone it reduces your casting

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.089 
golden runestone it reduces your casting
cost<00:02:07.740> to<00:02:08.009> 11<00:02:08.459> and<00:02:08.610> the<00:02:09.119> cooldown<00:02:09.629> 28<00:02:10.170> seconds

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
cost to 11 and the cooldown 28 seconds

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.790 
cost to 11 and the cooldown 28 seconds
so<00:02:11.640> eight<00:02:12.239> seconds<00:02:12.690> is<00:02:12.750> a<00:02:12.780> pretty<00:02:13.080> hefty

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
so eight seconds is a pretty hefty

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.600 
so eight seconds is a pretty hefty
down<00:02:14.100> on<00:02:14.400> on<00:02:15.270> your<00:02:15.900> your<00:02:16.350> cooldown<00:02:16.830> timer<00:02:17.130> so<00:02:17.430> I

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
down on on your your cooldown timer so I

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.610 
down on on your your cooldown timer so I
mean<00:02:17.790> you<00:02:17.970> know<00:02:18.120> it<00:02:18.900> would<00:02:19.050> be<00:02:19.140> very<00:02:19.350> helpful

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
mean you know it would be very helpful

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.050 
mean you know it would be very helpful
especially<00:02:19.980> if<00:02:20.370> you're<00:02:20.490> looking<00:02:20.730> to<00:02:20.850> spam
