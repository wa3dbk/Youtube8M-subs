00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:09.139
 good day means numerical requests 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:13.490
 small overview of sharpeners 

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:16.139
 homemade say at home questions about 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:22.560
 different nuances will now be a little bit 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:25.890
 answer means hinges made by 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:30.560
 the principle of the gyro how to say that is 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:33.480
 inside the frame that is drawn 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.989
 horizontal plane inside this 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.100
 framework 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:40.079
 fixed sleeve by she i'm here it is 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.940
 metal, as it were , slip coefficient 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.510
 less why brass 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:52.739
 and used sleeve moves 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:56.039
 vertically plane url and means most 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:01:02.480
 the movable part of it is quite extensive that 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:07.909
 allows you to sharpen any planes 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:12.140
 some suitable knives will say so 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:16.680
 then why two racks were used 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:18.840
 two racks if one could 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.729
 use side mount this 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.470
 hinge 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:27.119
 used two racks because 2 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:29.180
 more reliable than one you have all the main 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:32.939
 task 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:36.869
 which let's say so puzzled it was 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:45.439
 creating more robust designs with 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:45.439
 least say with least 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:55.840
 probable appearance 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:58.119
 lyushkov that is, the more reliable the better 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:02.600
 that's what i wanted to do 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:07.420
 it means further st where it is seen very large 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:11.200
 can be maneuvered in any direction and 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:15.550
 the angle does not change that is relatively 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:21.489
 cutting edges that we will sharpen and 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:27.769
 guide 4 screws of which two 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:30.260
 the upper ones are just controls and from all this 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:34.489
 design again to remove Russian 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:35.989
 and the construction goes lower so lower lower 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:40.760
 let go set a corner 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:43.060
 tightened the bottom screws rather huskies for 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.380
 control or top 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:49.459
 dragging them down is not necessary just 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:54.440
 pulled up a little and enough means 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:58.420
 this plane, I took it as a basis 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:03.290
 have as the basis of exhibited on it 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:06.049
 degrees this bar is on this axis 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:08.180
 coincides completely with the axis 

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:11.299
 central very film in general all 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:15.350
 goes along the same axis relative to this one 

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:19.069
 strips can and take both for zero zero 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:22.100
 mark and e-bookmark 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:24.709
 protractor this angle which will be 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:27.350
 converge on the cutting edge this will be 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:31.870
 sharpening angle is now set at 15 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:35.799
 degrees then and respectively 15 15 30 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:40.220
 for a kitchen knife can be a lot but 

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:43.579
 whichever i am cut 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:44.359
 and chose this floor sometimes even happens 

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:46.400
 more 

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:51.680
 and it should be less depending on the cutter again 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:57.500
 a question to understand so further two pens why 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:04:00.270
 2 let's say so one pen will divert 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:05.110
 swivel mechanism 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:07.330
 Here in this form the second pen for 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:14.739
 convenience so that on the principle of flat 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:18.600
 auction could be for 1 swivel 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:22.630
 the mechanism is assembled pretty simple 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:27.310
 corners are not wolves but a profile is square to this 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:31.080
 aluminum tubes and profiles fastening and 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:31.080
 fixation occurs in two planes 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:36.610
 Here is this plane keeps vertical 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:40.530
 this plane gives horizontal 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:40.530
 guide and on it 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:48.180
 based all mount further 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:54.270
 mechanism 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:59.080
 this one is pretty complicated too 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:05:03.340
 a small lever that pushes 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:06.789
 central headquarters pushing and pulse pushing 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:09.880
 Further spring pretty powerful she 

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:12.669
 very much attracts the bar 

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:14.590
 turning well, respectively, and gives 

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:19.479
 more confidence or that angle is not 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:20.669
 go astray it is worth bearing in far 

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:23.500
 parts 

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:26.590
 PTFE spacer she does not give 

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:31.990
 let's say so strong rotation that is 

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:36.639
 fixing on some friction parts 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:42.690
 still present in the coup 

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:42.690
 the angle is kept completely behind. 

00:05:43.289 --> 00:05:52.650
 diamond pieces ranging from 200 160 and 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:06:04.830
 hereinafter all the steps 

00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:07.960
 moves 3 2 3 2 microns give 

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:10.380
 pretty good mirror but 

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:17.640
 Now I will not sharpen a little now 

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:20.020
 we will review some parts therefore 

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:23.409
 that the video was not very long 

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:26.500
 will show one more thing spring i'm not 

00:06:23.409 --> 00:06:29.789
 I use it because, again, reliability 

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:33.070
 in the spring I do not see much let it be 

00:06:29.789 --> 00:06:38.430
 lamb so do no further 

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:38.430
 welding here is not all trite and simple 

00:06:38.729 --> 00:06:47.440
 The corner is cut out of aluminum keeps very 

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:49.270
 even not bad in the future I will 

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:52.479
 use a scarlet mount too 

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:55.240
 i just liked just cheap and 

00:06:52.479 --> 00:07:00.760
 angrily in pattaya screws 

00:06:55.240 --> 00:07:03.969
 quadruple hex with control in 

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:06.190
 he has a hole three and a half and four 

00:07:03.969 --> 00:07:13.419
 I cut the thread very well all 

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:14.669
 holding on and nothing fly away no 

00:07:13.419 --> 00:07:18.729
 falls out 

00:07:14.669 --> 00:07:21.219
 fixation can be fixed different 

00:07:18.729 --> 00:07:24.760
 i'm well i use diamond bars they 

00:07:21.219 --> 00:07:27.510
 all fours are the same thickness and angle 

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:27.510
 does not change 

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:38.729
 And so this whole thing 

00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:41.840
 happens in the future I plan 

00:07:38.729 --> 00:07:46.280
 put a small rack for fixing 

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:49.770
 metal guide 

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:55.729
 polished as far as the word make 

00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:55.729
 and park form produces sharpening 

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.569
 Thanks for attention
