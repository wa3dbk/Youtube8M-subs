00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:22.890
 yes hello dear friends and friends 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.710
 here to a new flood following at the 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.110
 mystery of the world i hope you have the 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.080
 Yesterday everyone had a nice advent word 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:35.100
 is the second december with his 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.899
 shoes and learn for birthday yes it 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.429
 should become a topic in this episode 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.979
 go something for decades in the border 

00:00:38.429 --> 00:00:43.409
 science very heated up to you 

00:00:40.979 --> 00:00:46.379
 Today, the question is being discussed 

00:00:43.409 --> 00:00:50.659
 dinosaurs lived classics the 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:53.870
 terex and people together 

00:00:50.659 --> 00:00:56.489
 I have at times on some time ago 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:58.769
 posted something on facebook and indeed one 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.019
 Playmobil Spielset there could then 

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:04.110
 some hunters as a playmobil 

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:05.880
 hunt male dinosaurs and have got there 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.030
 i am being asked our children now 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.610
 already said that the dinosaur and the 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.570
 to collect modern people on the 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.840
 earth exists 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:19.080
 because as we all know before 65 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.440
 Millions of years should be an asteroid 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.120
 or comet near today 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.800
 yucatan peninsula of mexico in the gulf of 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:28.890
 Mexico are taken 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:31.410
 that solved a whole series of 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:35.100
 chain reactions and then died 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:38.940
 then these dinosaurs gradually 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.590
 but relatively quickly there was 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:44.310
 Although already mammals one always says yes 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:47.640
 quite like such a kind of rat big naga 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.470
 and mammals from these early mammals 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.750
 In the end, we will develop 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.600
 people many many millions 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:57.870
 years later, in plain language this means 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:00.450
 humans and the dinosaurs have become 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:03.390
 the border science never meets science 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:07.620
 but say for example no that is 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:10.470
 it was not so well known in erich von 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:13.340
 he shows that he is leaving his book 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.280
 For example, ask the question what 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:19.860
 does it mean that 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:22.630
 it was on the ball in mexico 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.340
 petrified footprints give the 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:27.220
 apparently from modern humans 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:30.280
 and in the same geological strata 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:32.380
 where you can also find tracks 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:35.590
 Dinosaurs are then shows 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:39.730
 Of course, the question was raised by the Danish 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:41.380
 these two different species 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.530
 the earth is common and contradictory 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:46.300
 so of course completely the 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:49.060
 evolution theory and the general 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:51.310
 school science in quotation marks 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.769
 it was paid then you came 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.300
 of course, the colleague Achim hans 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:59.280
 Joachim Zimmer with his book that 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:01.620
 same the first edition davis mistake 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:04.269
 prove antediluvian finds 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:07.630
 dinosaurs and humans lived 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:09.790
 Together this is going on in this book 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:11.860
 yes, a lot on this 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:14.640
 petrified footprints the seemingly 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:18.209
 The feet of people look in too 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:21.100
 speak bigger if it has been huge 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:23.440
 there would be a link to one here 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.430
 video where i am here with the topic 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.549
 giant dealing 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:29.530
 But the room is very intense 

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:32.079
 a book in a book and brought 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:34.030
 the whole discussion then in front of many 

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:37.329
 years back here in germany new 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:42.690
 That's what the creationists are about 

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:45.400
 a religious community quasi 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:46.600
 fundamentalist christians who believe 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:50.709
 the earth st 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:53.769
 10,000 years old are in part anyway 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:55.900
 convinced that the god is the man 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:58.510
 and of course the dinosaurs as well 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:01.390
 at the same time created for that is that 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:03.280
 of course no question that it is 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:07.150
 people and dinosaurs at the same time 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:08.920
 even but it will always return to 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:10.660
 made the stinginess science finds 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:14.079
 or it will be on it 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:16.539
 pointed out that it is just such finds 

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:18.750
 should give and such human 

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:21.789
 remnants or just these 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:24.190
 Footprints in geological layers 

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:26.950
 were found and will be the 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:27.650
 actually reserved for the dinosaurs 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:31.639
 are 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:34.520
 That means 63 million years before it 

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:38.500
 ever the first people first 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:40.940
 There are already such humanoid 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:43.190
 he must be on this earth from now on 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:45.759
 and therefore it is natural for them 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:48.160
 established anthropology and 

00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:50.500
 evolutionary science completely absurd 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:52.280
 That's why my question, of course, to you 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:54.530
 have you ever with these pounds 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:57.250
 it is busy now this 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:05:01.639
 footprints of ballack civil was in 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:04.039
 three big texas or whatever it is in the 

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:05.510
 book forbidden archeology other world 

00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:08.150
 it is remembered below in the archive 

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:10.190
 connect as well as that there to 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:12.740
 example for example gives in this 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:15.740
 book this for example in coal rafts 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:18.340
 So underground mining work that there 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:20.180
 modern say let's say 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:23.979
 be found 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:26.320
 within the coal also on it 

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:30.259
 should or could indicate 

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:32.539
 that's just humans and dinosaurs 

00:05:30.259 --> 00:05:34.760
 Together, one also thinks of the 

00:05:32.539 --> 00:05:37.460
 stones for the guardia also inside 

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:39.380
 the scene of pre astronautics and the 

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:43.669
 Affiliation as a fake 

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:44.599
 where we are dinosaurs and are prescribed 

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:47.720
 people together 

00:05:44.599 --> 00:05:48.669
 in some in kabul look at this 

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:51.889
 stone 

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:55.639
 you certainly know this variety of 

00:05:51.889 --> 00:05:58.250
 circumstantial point or maybe 

00:05:55.639 --> 00:06:01.400
 prove it depending on how you take it 

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:03.620
 in the very science since 40 50 

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:06.380
 Years are always discussed 

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:08.300
 again trigger small hype and then 

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:11.930
 but again a sinking disappear 

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:14.800
 So what do you think have the dinosaur 

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:17.150
 over 65 million years ago by the 

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:19.310
 Impact of a comet or asteroid 

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:21.919
 or as the pre-astronautical author 

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:24.880
 dieter bremer believes in the crash 

00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:28.880
 a space station of the engine alliance 

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:30.860
 and we also died there say one 

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:35.690
 first humanity an early humanity 

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:37.370
 that is, it was humanoid and sour 

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:39.919
 yes at the same time or is the placement 

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:41.020
 completely wrong that is called the dinosaurs 

00:06:39.919 --> 00:06:42.720
 does not come from me boys 

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:45.160
 from years ago but only before some 

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:45.940
 Ten thousand years ago 

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:48.639
 people gave 

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:50.530
 this is an extremely exciting topic 

00:06:48.639 --> 00:06:51.669
 Dennis does not just treat the border 

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:54.639
 science but again as 

00:06:51.669 --> 00:06:57.370
 religious being the bible 

00:06:54.639 --> 00:06:59.560
 fundamentalists to the creationist and 

00:06:57.370 --> 00:07:01.539
 That's why I'm on this flight 

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:03.550
 very curious what you are under here 

00:07:01.539 --> 00:07:06.190
 I'll post you here too 

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:07.960
 couple left to the two books and 

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:11.430
 so I say goodbye to the 

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:11.430
 next episode 1
