like that and you're going to snip off

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.300 
like that and you're going to snip off
branches<00:01:59.790> like<00:02:00.180> this<00:02:00.479> now<00:02:01.200> consider<00:02:01.829> if<00:02:02.009> I<00:02:02.159> had

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
branches like this now consider if I had

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.980 
branches like this now consider if I had
taken<00:02:02.490> any<00:02:02.880> of<00:02:02.969> these<00:02:03.060> branches<00:02:03.329> I<00:02:03.659> don't<00:02:03.840> see

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
taken any of these branches I don't see

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.810 
taken any of these branches I don't see
many<00:02:04.140> people<00:02:04.439> doing<00:02:04.590> and<00:02:04.829> tried<00:02:05.340> using<00:02:05.549> the

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
many people doing and tried using the

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.719 
many people doing and tried using the
phone<00:02:06.060> flock<00:02:06.450> stuff<00:02:06.810> well<00:02:07.530> it<00:02:07.829> wouldn't<00:02:08.220> be<00:02:08.310> it

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
phone flock stuff well it wouldn't be it

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.490 
phone flock stuff well it wouldn't be it
would<00:02:08.819> be<00:02:08.879> way<00:02:09.149> too<00:02:09.209> thick<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:10.080> tree<00:02:10.349> would

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
would be way too thick the tree would

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.260 
would be way too thick the tree would
look<00:02:10.530> so<00:02:10.920> ridiculously<00:02:11.610> fake<00:02:11.910> because<00:02:12.060> there

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
look so ridiculously fake because there

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.790 
look so ridiculously fake because there
would<00:02:12.360> just<00:02:12.390> be<00:02:12.599> bushels<00:02:13.260> of<00:02:13.410> stuff

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
would just be bushels of stuff

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.890 
would just be bushels of stuff
on<00:02:13.890> there<00:02:14.130> wouldn't<00:02:14.640> look<00:02:14.700> like<00:02:14.880> a<00:02:14.910> tree<00:02:15.240> but

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
on there wouldn't look like a tree but

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.080 
on there wouldn't look like a tree but
what<00:02:16.050> I<00:02:16.080> did<00:02:16.320> is<00:02:16.500> after<00:02:16.830> carving<00:02:17.280> a<00:02:17.430> hole<00:02:17.730> into

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
what I did is after carving a hole into

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.780 
what I did is after carving a hole into
the<00:02:18.720> bottom<00:02:19.170> of<00:02:19.200> the<00:02:19.410> base<00:02:19.740> here<00:02:20.070> large<00:02:20.460> enough

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
the bottom of the base here large enough

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.860 
the bottom of the base here large enough
to<00:02:21.420> stick<00:02:21.720> the<00:02:22.170> actual<00:02:22.650> branch<00:02:23.010> in<00:02:23.360> I<00:02:24.360> had<00:02:24.750> it

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
to stick the actual branch in I had it

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.960 
to stick the actual branch in I had it
based<00:02:25.110> up<00:02:25.380> and<00:02:25.590> so<00:02:25.740> it'll<00:02:25.890> end<00:02:26.040> up<00:02:26.160> putting

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
based up and so it'll end up putting

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.730 
based up and so it'll end up putting
them<00:02:27.180> together<00:02:27.360> like<00:02:27.780> this<00:02:28.020> and<00:02:28.290> I'll<00:02:28.560> show

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
them together like this and I'll show

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.110 
them together like this and I'll show
you<00:02:28.770> the<00:02:28.950> other<00:02:29.100> one<00:02:29.250> that<00:02:29.400> I<00:02:29.430> just<00:02:29.700> did<00:02:29.910> it's

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120
