00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:19.850 
a pretty hefty knife but if you're

a pretty hefty knife but if you're
you're<00:05:20.210> on<00:05:20.330> the<00:05:20.540> brush<00:05:20.750> and<00:05:20.780> you<00:05:21.020> need<00:05:21.200> a

you're on the brush and you need a
heavy-duty<00:05:21.560> knife<00:05:21.950> this<00:05:22.610> would<00:05:22.850> be<00:05:22.940> the<00:05:23.060> one

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:23.180 
heavy-duty knife this would be the one

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:27.760 
heavy-duty knife this would be the one
to<00:05:23.240> fall<00:05:23.480> back<00:05:23.780> on<00:05:25.990> well<00:05:26.990> the<00:05:27.140> comparisons

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:27.770
