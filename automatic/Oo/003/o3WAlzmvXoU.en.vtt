00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:09.430
 3rd a role 

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:09.430
 finally rescued 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:15.400
 how they at vaudry iolite 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.449
 I'll time what 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:33.809
 ok, you're going to tame me, I'm putting you the beef 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:34.829
 to the whores to pass on me ah no 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:39.230
 in fact I can play while I 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.230
 channel you know 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:44.930
 okay 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:44.930
 powerful 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:50.780
 it's still more practical if there 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.380
 had a grip but there you can not even 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.160
 not if we can do it 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:01:00.170
 especially a lot actually the 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:01.370
 big I could not pout if you 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.050
 see that he is channeling the fulgurant point 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.220
 must move your ass the healthy guys he 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:05.690
 is right on your mouth the thing 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.080
 do not know how you do for the 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:09.140
 take 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:12.470
 the study that was based for the cases that 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:15.640
 the tail Thursday on the cases that the 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.640
 date you can avoid it 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.990
 bagdad 2 seconds we will avoid it watts 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.670
 agent such-and-such a second 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.780
 to say to move because in 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:28.670
 General not you expect me to they 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:31.190
 do so he has little but never face 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.440
 him and then it's over what 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:35.080
 the game can channel while I 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:38.470
 step of a print ah bah no actually 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.470
 go ahead my role 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.230
 then center 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:50.760
 gold so soon the world 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:57.230
 attention to the crisis to do it 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.010
 do you still expect him to 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:00.840
 actually do 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:03.110
 I love this style got scared against 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.250
 deep 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:10.179
 I can not do anything for now 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:10.179
 three mandates I channel you 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:20.350
 are you kidding me 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:22.390
 there's not the epicenter ok good that rule and 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:26.740
 thing it deserves because we get 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:29.710
 wipe there in fact but good the most 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:31.150
 glaucous and cooking this breakdown a 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:32.350
 times on two the powerful does not do 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:38.410
 damage once on two games can the 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:40.360
 block sometimes stupor I can not the 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:42.900
 it's wanted by now I give 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.900
 us evolve 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:50.170
 who then watched with heliads from 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.170
 blow and we should be able to make a 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.040
 effort on the liver game bull once you 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:58.450
 in fact I have to take the 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:03:00.670
 beef that I'm keeping it to the cgt she 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.410
 this cove have by cons aj 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:07.990
 the epicent so these parts to both 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:10.350
 Guards by all as I get excited ya there 

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:10.350
 I can not move 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:18.790
 if we do not need to move for them 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:19.810
 stuff anyway it is his cushy 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:23.070
 companion to nothing I can do to 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.070
 my opinion on this phase 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:31.860
 I tell myself that it is on that one 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:31.860
 that we should mix in chips and 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.450
 allows qwise discovery 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:46.130
 so the first one will let him go 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:46.130
 so you have come out tarn 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:52.409
 wait for his part the cases that 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:54.450
 do not you move what I'm going to do you 

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:55.579
 take the flames is there for you 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:58.049
 spread before it leaves 

00:03:55.579 --> 00:04:01.110
 the crazy I did not take them but 

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:03.769
 through this loan you could go 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:03.769
 on the other side actually 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:09.520
 antoine thomas 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:09.520

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.800
 when three explosions 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:25.820
 but a little more typed approach in May of 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:27.139
 hiccups armed bands pt 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.949

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:29.949
 lg shooting is good 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:38.330
 super cool down 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.580

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:46.900

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:46.900

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:11.690

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:11.690

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:30.890
 transition quickly 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:37.979
 afterwards forget about moving 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:40.880
 there will always be jokes and breizh 

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:40.880
