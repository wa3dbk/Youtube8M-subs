 or the low everything will be shared this 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.609
 always with android this kind of 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.010
 pending the issue of control of 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.410
 music with the headphones button 

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:13.019

 sorry and with him you could do as 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.929
 less raise the volume because the 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.390
 latest android versions from 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.520
 4.0 if I'm not wrong with the ice cream 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.110
 sandwich and the living 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.810
 if we left to press button of the 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:26.460
 hearing aids we opened the google now 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:28.200
 so that's why we're going to the 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:32.310
 keep the button pressed tight clicks and 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:33.870
 keep in a forum post hobby 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:37.130
 puntocom talked about this application 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.130
 droid headset 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:43.070
 we will arrive 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.079
 we go down and here in the option that 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.540
 says 'google cn' out picks that is 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:50.090
 google fix needs root so 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:52.370
 Alternate rooteado have of him we press 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.820
 we would mark it ask us for permission 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.710
 root superuser 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:58.090
 and he will leave a warning that there will be 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.410
 restart for it to work and I what 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:00.540
 I have done so I do not have it 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:02.430
 do 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.780
 to see the application is in English as 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:08.150
 you see 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.150
 there are many options we have 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.430
 dgc with me with li 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:14.430
 utility 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.600
 a lot of options that has not either 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.380
 been of all we can protection of the 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.119
 auditory 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.100
 then there is a volume option reset 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:28.219
 that we configure configure the volume 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:30.530
 reset and it's starting to go down to 30% and 

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:33.200
 start this we can configure the 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:35.509
 score that we have sound then the 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:39.030
 delay is to say the milliseconds of 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:40.890
 double click click and keep 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.920
 but what really interests us are 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:48.240
 button actions we give a button actions 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:51.180
 and we have single click I have and if it is 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:54.090
 with play or pause to show the music or 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.040
 stop it and if they call us it would answer 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.100
 and hang up call with double click we have 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.000
 next song or hang or mute 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.310
 the microphone 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.600
 that is to say if they call us we would cancel the 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.310
 called that is to say we would place what 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.510
 we would take and if we are in a 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.300
 conversation is that we would do the 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:13.020
 mic with three clicks would be the 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.020
 previous song 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:21.090
 call to repeat it would be re call 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.400
 with four clicks I have put thanks 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.709
 to an application with click and keep 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.989
 we have volume for down 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:30.659
 I recommend putting with just one click and 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:32.909
 keep it volume volume down 

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:34.500
 that is to say volume less because there are many 

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:37.019
 times that in this application it has not 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.120
 passed almost but in the other in the james 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:40.950
 control ats grallaba android stays 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.780
 tight and if we have volume towards 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.640
 up we are going up the volume and 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.069
 we can lower the smoke a 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.590
 roll with double click and keep I have the 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:51.120
 Volume up and triple click 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.160
 in keeping I have the fast forward but 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.440
 I really do not use it 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.060
 if we had a headset is 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.280
 part of a single button had several 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.530
 buttons ie the play button or 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.510
 take call and the one from backwards and 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.799
 forward 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.470
 that is to say song make the situation 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:09.000
 forward we could configure it for 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.280
 each button a lot of options like 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.920
 You see here just like I said for the 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:16.060
 normal button in my case did I have a 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:19.230
 button 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.230
 with actions 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.750
 and answer a call what you 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:27.349
 I was saying before I put it next it's 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:30.470
 say that with one click take the call 

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:33.230
 with one click it hangs with double click 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:36.080
 we do not reject the call and all these 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:38.239
 Call options is the biggest either 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:40.470
 I touched it never just me what 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:42.420
 would configure would be what you already have 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.530
 if we are going to check if there are conflicts 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.630
 there are conflicts with no other 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:48.720
 application and service 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:50.340
 and now it would work we will start 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:53.930
 use it for you to see it I will make a 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.930
 click to start the music 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:03.950
 by double clicking for the mega 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:09.130
 I'm going to triple- click so that 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:09.130
 move the same forward 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:13.190
 I'm going to turn up volume 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:18.450
 I'm going to lower the volume 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:25.380
 as you see all this I simply do 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:27.720
 with the hearing aid 5 the button that leads to 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:30.180
 the helmets all this is done 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.410
 application has payment keys you want 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:33.390
 know if it enters to check that 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:35.100
 it works on your device and then 

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:36.990
 If it works and you like it, you can 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:38.820
 decide whether to buy the paid version and 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:40.740
 good we are to this video and so leave 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:41.910
 I like it, I told the channel to leave the 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.000
 comments what you want a up 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:44.000
 then
