00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:02.590
 yes 

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:08.930
 well we also know that there are people who 

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:11.180
 it's very conservative very traditional that 

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:13.460
 you can recommend us good for that 

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:16.189
 kind of people we have the option of 

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:17.990
 use ice and ice is a gel that 

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:21.320
 acts as a long-lasting enamel 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:23.869
 besides not without very elegant design you 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:27.369
 will last from 3 to 4 weeks is 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:27.369
 we are going to see him 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.570
 yes 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.230
 as a first step we are going to sanitize the 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:37.910
 work area 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.910
 and we push cuticles 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:44.140
 we remove the excess 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.910
 let's use the look on natural nail 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:49.990
 so let's file with a lime 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:55.170
 one hundred and 180 strikeouts 

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:55.170
 we remove the natural shine of the nail 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.550
 we remove dust 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:04.619
 to completely remove the dust 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:08.140
 we use and clean share and clean 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:11.619
 we apply neil prep to dehydrate 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:13.780
 open the pores of the natural nail when 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:17.409
 we use yeah looks on nail 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:19.960
 natural we can use or not the first the 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:21.700
 a primer layer is additional if 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.460
 we want this application 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:27.390
 last us much longer we apply a 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.390
 1st layer 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:33.110
 the first one helped us to give better 

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:36.380
 way if we apply first over 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:38.180
 the natural nail to use looks in the 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.909
 application of the ice that adheres 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:43.219
 better way so we're going we're going to 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:46.130
 take a little more time to 

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:48.799
 remove it we apply a light layer of 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:52.310
 Luxury thin layers when we handle 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:55.069
 ice we are working very layers 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:59.240
 thin we do not touch cuticle area nor 

00:01:55.069 --> 00:02:02.149
 side a uniform layer and very 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:04.939
 thin and we introduce to the lamp 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:07.399
 for a minute this is if the lamp 

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:12.170
 it is 36 watts if it is of lesser quantity 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:14.660
 let's leave more time once 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:18.170
 we have cured under a lamp we are going to 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:21.980
 use ice cream this is a lux gel 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:27.730
 to make the classic french layer very 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:27.730
 thin starting cuticle together 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:32.569
 the whole surface we do not touch lateral 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.390
 nor cuticle 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:39.290
 and this is to give it a very natural tone 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:42.080
 to our nail we try to cover well 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:45.260
 lateral 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:48.600
 approaching as much as possible to cuticle 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:51.960
 without touching skin and we introduce to the 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:55.320
 lamp for 1 minute we will apply 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:59.450
 a second layer very thin layers 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:59.450
 this is to intensify the color 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:12.239
 let's say laterals together and again 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:15.239
 we introduce the lamp 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:15.239
 s 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:21.390
 once we have cured we are going to 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:24.930
 use the white look let's draw 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:24.930
 one frame 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:32.340
 this is to give a different effect 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:36.500
 make a very classic front using 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:40.410
 very natural tones we cover tip 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:42.560
 side with the help of a brush and a 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:45.480
 little acetone let's delineate 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:47.700
 perfectly smile 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:51.650
 remember that the ice that only 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.650
 dry when it is inside the lamp 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:04:01.190
 here we have time to delineate the e 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.190
 we introduce the lamp 

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:07.310
 to give intensity to the white color in 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:10.490
 tip we are going to apply a second layer 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:13.940
 that's why I repeat that the layers 

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:16.940
 They must be very thin 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:16.940
 today 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:23.790
 again we clean smile 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:28.479
 and we introduce the lamp 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:34.040
 to continue we are going to use luxury now 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:37.810
 that we are working today the look on 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.810
 natural nail a light layer 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:44.520
 we do not touch cuticle or laterals and 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:47.810
 We seal perfectly in tip and 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:47.810
 we introduce to lamp 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:53.560
 to remove the stickiness of the luxury 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:56.230
 let's use the green set we clean 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:59.830
 surface to add decoration 

00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:01.060
 let's use acrylic crystals 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:04.120
 ultra cool 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:07.090
 we take an ultra acrylic pearl 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:09.490
 white and placed it on the surface with 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:12.810
 help from our tweezers we place a 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:16.110
 I press glass 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:18.980
 to embed the acrylic with 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:21.980
 white graph style we continue 

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:21.980
 decorating 

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:28.080
 to finish we apply hydrator of 

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:28.080
 cuticle 

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:33.930
 performing a light massage so that the 

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:36.090
 skin absorb and hydrate in a better way 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:38.210
 and that's how the look looks on nail 

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:38.210
 natural
