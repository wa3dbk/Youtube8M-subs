 spider on the big screen 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.960
 under a confidential agreement

 some twitter users 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.250
 wondering why in the sony agreement 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:58.559
 stipulates race and sexy 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.540

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.520
 admits and thoughts that this super hero 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:04.530
 maybe not white teenagers but somebody 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.540
 some more fans took it 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.640
 Characteristic requirements with 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.020
 humor we turned to comment 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.270
 Bill Fletcher at a traffic activist 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:17.310
 against racism quest opel frontera 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:19.140
 arnica may be publishers believe that 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.360
 they have some ownership of 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.000
 this character or they may have 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.430
 personal prejudice seems to me the reason 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.229
 lies somewhat deeper for many years 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.869
 almost all super hero were white 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.619
 men and many consider their 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.420
 prejudice 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.280
 or some strange representation 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.500
 traditionalism that characters should 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.869
 always remain what they were 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.710
 whether the combs themselves are important 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.420
 scattered

 and sexual orientation when it comes 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.590
 concerns fictional characters by 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.660
 Bella Fletcher and the Young Reader 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:53.220
 need such heroes on whom they could 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:55.319
 would look like fantastic 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.690
 diversity is essential 

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:59.190
 characters cool and imagination playing 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:00.179
 large role in the formation of personality 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:02.399
 baby 

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:04.770
 but if he looks different from everyone 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:07.380
 favorite characters it is bad for 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.060
 his self esteem is therefore necessary to fight for 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.099
 ethnic and sociocultural 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:14.150
 diversity in some sense is 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:14.150
 struggle for democracy
