00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:40.679 
fat but it's just not showing on the
scales<00:01:39.280> because<00:01:39.579> I<00:01:39.610> have<00:01:39.880> some<00:01:40.210> fluid

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:40.689 
scales because I have some fluid

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:42.600 
scales because I have some fluid

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:22.570 
quite a bit since then um I think in the

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:24.300 
quite a bit since then um I think in the
mirror<00:02:22.810> it<00:02:22.900> has<00:02:23.109> hopefully<00:02:23.799> I<00:02:23.829> don't<00:02:23.950> recall

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
mirror it has hopefully I don't recall

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.759 
mirror it has hopefully I don't recall
myself<00:02:24.790> and<00:02:24.970> then<00:02:25.060> I'm<00:02:25.150> like<00:02:25.269> I<00:02:25.540> don't<00:02:26.500> think<00:02:26.680> I

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:26.769 
myself and then I'm like I don't think I

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:28.110 
myself and then I'm like I don't think I
look<00:02:26.920> like<00:02:26.950> that<00:02:27.310> does<00:02:27.820> that<00:02:27.970> happen

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
look like that does that happen

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.949
