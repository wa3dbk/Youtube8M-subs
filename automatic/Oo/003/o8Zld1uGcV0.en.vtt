00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:15.780
 to a new one so after the last video 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:18.510
 about the competitions of me got you 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.820
 many news about this topic and 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.939
 also interest which I am very happy 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.340
 and some wrote or asked me 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.029
 me what I made for competitions 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.840
 to have 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.759
 First of all , I have 2013 that was mine 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.140
 first competition the swiss 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.230
 championship contested 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:40.350
 in balance and have the first 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:46.700
 made space and then I have 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:53.610
 still the best poster award then gets 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:55.110
 11 november was on by the victorious 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.350
 I was the swiss championship 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.850
 qualified for a beer world 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.719
 championship in boston 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:06.869
 never was then on 11 november and there 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:09.600
 I found out locally that I have the 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:13.439
 opportunity to start as a junior 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.460
 because there it is up to 24 I have mine 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.220
 but said no 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.759
 if then you do both so I have 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:25.170
 logged me in both categories 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:28.290
 what damn hard shit was at the end 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.350
 I was so annoyed with that 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.450
 I could not do any more 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:35.700
 but it was worth it for me 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.520
 have the first place in the juniors 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:41.040
 and the first place among the men in the 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:44.970
 bantamweight this is the deepest 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:47.909
 Weight class done there and yes 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:52.079
 thus double world champion around 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:54.750
 swiss most 2013 and like some 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:58.560
 Maybe I am aware of you 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:01.500
 On the contest now for this season 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:04.290
 to get a title as well as possible 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:08.489
 defend here you can still see the 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:09.970
 trophy from last year now on the one hand 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:14.350
 tip 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:16.780
 does not make the same mistake as me 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.580
 I am a very critical person if it is 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.170
 it's about myself and that's what I think 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.990
 Well 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:25.720
 but if you're going to compete like that 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:27.030
 it could be that they are something 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.830
 become paranoid 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:32.470
 I started at that time too 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:34.110
 research who could join who 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:37.360
 could be my opponent 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:41.710
 and I was very strong on that 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:45.209
 others focus what i mean now 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:47.320
 see as a mistake and you yes 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:50.980
 want to convey that you do not have the 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:55.300
 same mistake makes you focus 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:58.690
 just prepare for your competition because 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:02.830
 you have no influence on others like that 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:06.760
 that ultimately you or yours have 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:08.620
 opponents the shape they will have and 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.900
 you can not influence that 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:14.110
 does not waste the energy for 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:18.340
 other people just focus on you 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:21.280
 your training on your diet on the 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:26.019
 mail preparation whatever you are 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:28.030
 you have to do your thing not left 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:29.019
 and not always right only 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.450
 straight 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:34.239
 because in the end you have to do yours 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:36.010
 give the best and that is what counts too 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:39.670
 if you then place on the stage 3 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:43.350
 but you can say yourself 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:46.620
 I did my best 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:49.200
 that's one of the best things there is 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:52.290
 if you are happy with yourself 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:54.660
 you have reached the goal so the 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:04:00.390
 competition preparation and on the custom 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:04:05.490
 the day on the stage is a pretty one 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:08.730
 Brilliant experience and you should do that 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:12.330
 yes because otherwise something positive to exclude the 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:16.800
 I have really noticed thanks 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:20.210
 last year what is crucial that 

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:24.450
 are not you? 

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:28.560
 So fight for a win fight for 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:31.950
 a personal victory and give everything 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:37.080
 so that the end of the day iks on the 

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:37.950
 stage the best form in our lives 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:40.380
 it would have been 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:42.920
 I hope I could help you something 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:45.920
 I wish you a nice evening 

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:45.920
 With
