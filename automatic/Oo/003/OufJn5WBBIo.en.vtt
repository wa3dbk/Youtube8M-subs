00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 hello friends of the movie welcome to 

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:07.529
 dvd review and a list of one 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.900
 great cast and 150 million 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.370
 dollar budget which a continuation of a 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.599
 of which I honestly only 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.250
 was impressed mediocre but 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.059
 maybe the continuation of the 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.070
 much more 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.340
 and that 's all about anger today 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.340
 titanium 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:35.370
 wrath of the titans original wrath of the 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.900
 titans is from 2012 and 99 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.239
 minutes tells the story of 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:41.340
 perseus continued ten years later 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.930
 he fought as known from the first part 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.850
 the titans defeated the octopus 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.470
 in between a woman has died 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.180
 single father actually wants 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.220
 just live as a normal fisherman 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.409
 cause I would be the problem that 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.670
 father zeus calls him for help because of the 

00:00:52.409 --> 00:00:55.199
 Gods are getting weaker 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.940
 because people are no longer with him 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.829
 pray and be among these gods 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.170
 one or the other with one 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.660
 sinister and evil scheming plan yes 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.100
 and the word perseus on the plan of 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.869
 but not really wants it 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.670
 in the end it will probably be 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.590
 How else can you get this 99? 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.330
 minutes film together and then he goes 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.830
 get on an odyssey together with a 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.470
 second demi-god after a protracted 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.450
 history the full material battle 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.369
 is here in the casting again as 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.679
 main actor as zeus liam this 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.500
 as well as ralph fiennes as hades and 

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:27.420
 a well laid out ready the 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.679
 otherwise you had to kf3 four 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.720
 actor from the first part 

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:32.369
 replace even whole rolls 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.920
 delete because the schedule is not so 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.409
 really wanted the title is on 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.060
 end of a fantasy movie of something from 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.770
 sometimes it is charged with effects 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.049
 I look bad then look 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.700
 fantastic, but that one 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.110
 about it or not by effects not 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.030
 can hide the fact that the 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.799
 act you are incredibly skinny and 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.750
 the characters unfortunately much too flat 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.340
 drawn is very a pity and 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.869
 one ready to play with his 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.520
 short occurs in my opinion 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.420
 but most of them did not 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.189
 because of that we are bad 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.290
 Actors at the start are no one has 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:03.540
 given him too little to play and that 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.430
 is a great pity and so was with 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.020
 this movie at the box office both in 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.539
 the usa as well as internationally very much 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.850
 punished partially lost up to 50 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.290
 percent of profit and that 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.460
 I can understand for me 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.020
 this movie a whole 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:17.400
 behind the first part and above all 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.850
 I will not look at him for a second time 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.410
 have to 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.210
 Nevertheless, one is not afraid of it 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.680
 have long shied away from the script for 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:24.810
 to commission the third part 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.640
 So we can look forward to it more 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.560
 again, dear anger, the titan has me 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.980
 the film a little disappointed and with 99 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:34.710
 minutes felt like 120,130 because 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.090
 just effects will be slammed 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:38.610
 and there is no real villain 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.830
 and that is a great pity there are many 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:43.200
 bad guys and the real right one 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:45.630
 villain the god or the evil kronos 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.030
 is more or less just an animated one 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.440
 figure which in turn ensures that 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.420
 a really good movie numbers as well 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.860
 really bad character needs and the 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.750
 is not a pity it is a pity 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.830
 as I said the movie looks once and I 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.390
 honestly not 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:01.140
 absolutely must see because I am 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:02.670
 fantasy fan for fantasy movie fan and there 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.950
 so much more would have been possible right now 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.960
 dollar 150 million that is okay 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:10.500
 for me as a fantasy film gets this 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:12.870
 film five out of ten possible points 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.280
 just acceptable is total power 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.410
 the four out of ten possible points 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.030
 handcrafted are already many great 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:20.310
 effects and many great landscapes 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:23.730
 set there but it does not help anything 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:25.140
 if the book is wrong and so 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.850
 I'm totally interested in what you're about 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:28.140
 this film thinks otherwise is all else 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:29.700
 trailer over there is now in the 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:31.860
 extending already a sale 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:35.250
 meanwhile over not sure and 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:37.110
 That's it from me for this morning at 15 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:39.780
 of course, there is a new review 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:43.850
 and by that time I hope you are tomorrow 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.850
 of course again at 3
