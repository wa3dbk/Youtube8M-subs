 and we're going to throw all the spices a 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.740
 little bit nothing, there we go a little bit 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.510
 another little 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.500
 but effect 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:40.890

 chop of asia and we are going to mix them 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.129
 then in the mix we have 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.370
 What we are going to do is catch and 

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:11.189
 put the tofu inside perfect giving it 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:14.690
 door by side and side and we're going to 

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:16.700
 leave to marinate for about 20 minutes 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:18.650
 once 20 minutes have passed since 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:21.380
 We put the tofu or marinate what we are going to 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:24.410
 to do is to remove it from the marinade of 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:26.570
 this way we are going to drain everything very 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:28.040
 well as you can see, I put it in the navy 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:29.720
 of the end on a plate because I do not 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.100
 they all took in the bowl but let's go 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.260
 also giving you're going around 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:35.000
 once in a while and they would take in the marina not 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:38.000
 we run off well look how are you going 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:41.900
 cutting everything and we will go through the 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:45.360
 flour there goes 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:49.560
 that is well marinated and so one for 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:52.020
 one once we have flour 2 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:54.209
 and we're going to take a sachet of oil 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:57.420
 do not spend too much because against more 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:59.819
 of six is ​​going to get fat like that a pinch of 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:03.209
 nothing, let's wait for it to warm up 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:05.880
 there goes and when it is hot what 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:07.819
 let's do is take the tofu and flour 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:09.959
 dow and we will fry it back and forth 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:11.790
 once we see that it is already hot 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:16.049
 the oil of everything we are going to do 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:20.690
 is caesar the tofu fillets one by one 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:20.690
 and we're going to let it fry on both sides 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:26.040
 we have done is put it on a paper of 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.950
 cook to absorb the oil and so 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:30.690
 have much less fat now what 

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:32.730
 we are going to do is that on a plate by such 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:35.280
 like this one we're going to take the sauce 

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:39.480
 basil and we're going to just throw one 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:42.720
