interest but that community is part and
parcel<00:01:51.630> of<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.110> product<00:01:52.530> and<00:01:53.040> I<00:01:53.369> don't<00:01:53.430> think

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
parcel of the product and I don't think

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.389 
parcel of the product and I don't think
that<00:01:54.600> I've<00:01:54.750> seen<00:01:55.079> so<00:01:55.649> that<00:01:55.890> sort<00:01:56.130> of<00:01:56.159> lack<00:01:56.369> of

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
that I've seen so that sort of lack of

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.810 
that I've seen so that sort of lack of
creepiness<00:01:56.969> since<00:01:57.960> the<00:01:58.200> age<00:01:58.290> of<00:01:58.500> about<00:01:58.829> 16<00:01:59.430> so

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
creepiness since the age of about 16 so

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.069 
creepiness since the age of about 16 so
when<00:02:00.000> you<00:02:00.090> grow<00:02:00.270> up<00:02:00.420> a<00:02:00.600> bit<00:02:00.780> there's<00:02:00.930> always

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
when you grow up a bit there's always

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.800 
when you grow up a bit there's always
some<00:02:01.320> sort<00:02:01.350> of<00:02:01.619> like<00:02:01.799> predatory<00:02:02.810> element

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
some sort of like predatory element

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.569 
some sort of like predatory element
although<00:02:04.140> saying<00:02:04.560> that<00:02:04.799> that<00:02:05.100> could<00:02:05.340> just<00:02:05.520> be

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
although saying that that could just be

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.160 
although saying that that could just be
because<00:02:05.880> most<00:02:06.180> of<00:02:06.360> the<00:02:06.420> people<00:02:06.540> there<00:02:06.869> are

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
because most of the people there are

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.020 
because most of the people there are
under<00:02:07.920> 16<00:02:08.369> so<00:02:09.270> if<00:02:09.420> anyone<00:02:09.780> was

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
under 16 so if anyone was

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.110 
under 16 so if anyone was
predator<00:02:10.450> it<00:02:11.380> was<00:02:11.530> probably<00:02:11.830> me<00:02:12.310> I'm<00:02:12.940> not

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
predator it was probably me I'm not

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.300 
predator it was probably me I'm not
predatory<00:02:13.660> that's<00:02:14.080> fine<00:02:14.350> I'm<00:02:14.709> just<00:02:14.890> saying<00:02:15.069> if

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
predatory that's fine I'm just saying if

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.000 
predatory that's fine I'm just saying if
I'd<00:02:15.459> wanted<00:02:15.850> to<00:02:16.450> abduct<00:02:16.810> somebody<00:02:17.230> probably

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
I'd wanted to abduct somebody probably

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.420
