one in in in other words I'm going to

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.429 
one in in in other words I'm going to
line<00:01:01.320> them<00:01:01.469> up<00:01:01.559> with<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:01.859> holes<00:01:03.229> first<00:01:04.229> of<00:01:04.409> all

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.590 
line them up with the holes first of all
I'm<00:01:04.589> going<00:01:04.710> to<00:01:04.769> try<00:01:05.070> to<00:01:05.100> put<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.119> ribbons<00:01:06.450> back

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
on but you get the general idea there's

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.750 
on but you get the general idea there's
three<00:01:10.320> total<00:01:10.650> ribbons<00:01:10.950> one<00:01:11.130> going<00:01:11.460> to<00:01:11.610> the

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
three total ribbons one going to the

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.149 
three total ribbons one going to the
laser<00:01:12.090> and<00:01:12.390> one<00:01:12.570> just<00:01:12.780> going<00:01:13.080> to<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.710> tool<00:01:13.979> on

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
laser and one just going to the tool on

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.980 
laser and one just going to the tool on
the<00:01:14.369> side<00:01:15.350> once<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.680> motor<00:01:16.920> to<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.990> spinner

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
the side once the motor to the spinner

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.770 
the side once the motor to the spinner
and<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.740> other<00:01:19.890> ones<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.970> motor<00:01:21.240> I<00:01:21.540> may<00:01:21.659> not

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
and the other ones the motor I may not

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.340 
and the other ones the motor I may not
the<00:01:21.930> motor<00:01:22.110> but<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.470> reader<00:01:22.650> to<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:23.130> ps2<00:01:23.729> and

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
the motor but the reader to the ps2 and

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.690 
the motor but the reader to the ps2 and
as<00:01:25.350> I'm<00:01:25.470> going<00:01:25.619> to<00:01:25.680> try<00:01:25.770> to<00:01:25.799> put<00:01:26.009> the<00:01:26.159> screws<00:01:26.490> in

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
as I'm going to try to put the screws in

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.390 
as I'm going to try to put the screws in
which<00:01:26.909> I<00:01:27.240> pretty<00:01:27.840> much<00:01:27.930> camp<00:01:28.290> because<00:01:28.890> it

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
which I pretty much camp because it

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.020 
which I pretty much camp because it
takes<00:01:29.670> a<00:01:29.820> little<00:01:29.970> bit<00:01:30.150> of<00:01:31.579> lining<00:01:32.579> them<00:01:32.729> up<00:01:32.820> and

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
takes a little bit of lining them up and

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.200 
takes a little bit of lining them up and
everything<00:01:33.619> but<00:01:34.619> that's<00:01:35.009> what<00:01:35.520> practically

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
everything but that's what practically

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.990 
everything but that's what practically
you<00:01:36.390> do<00:01:36.570> you<00:01:37.110> turn<00:01:37.320> on<00:01:37.619> do<00:01:38.280> not<00:01:38.460> power<00:01:38.759> it<00:01:38.939> up

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
you do you turn on do not power it up

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.240 
you do you turn on do not power it up
when<00:01:39.240> you<00:01:39.390> when<00:01:40.320> you're<00:01:40.530> doing<00:01:40.829> this<00:01:40.950> please

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
when you when you're doing this please

when you when you're doing this please
because<00:01:41.670> you<00:01:41.820> will<00:01:42.380> ground<00:01:43.380> it<00:01:43.590> out<00:01:43.770> and<00:01:44.040> mess

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
because you will ground it out and mess

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.520 
because you will ground it out and mess
up<00:01:44.310> the<00:01:44.640> power<00:01:44.909> and<00:01:45.329> all<00:01:45.479> that<00:01:45.689> you'll<00:01:46.110> pretty
