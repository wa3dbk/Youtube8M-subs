00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
the video yeah

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.229 
the video yeah
I<00:02:13.290> mean<00:02:13.580> like<00:02:14.580> they<00:02:14.730> were<00:02:14.819> wait<00:02:14.940> to<00:02:15.030> take<00:02:15.150> the

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
I mean like they were wait to take the

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:17.390 
I mean like they were wait to take the
video<00:02:15.450> down<00:02:15.510> or<00:02:15.930> a<00:02:15.959> way<00:02:16.140> to<00:02:16.200> like<00:02:16.470> remove<00:02:17.069> the

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
video down or a way to like remove the

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.100 
video down or a way to like remove the
gifts<00:02:17.790> from<00:02:17.970> the<00:02:18.150> internet<00:02:18.540> because<00:02:18.750> that's

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
gifts from the internet because that's

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.680 
gifts from the internet because that's
that's<00:02:19.650> two<00:02:19.920> different<00:02:20.069> things<00:02:20.370> I<00:02:20.730> guess<00:02:20.909> is

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
that's two different things I guess is

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.899 
that's two different things I guess is
there<00:02:21.900> a<00:02:21.930> way<00:02:22.019> to<00:02:22.049> do<00:02:22.230> both<00:02:22.440> well<00:02:23.430> I<00:02:23.459> mean<00:02:23.640> like

00:02:23.899 --> 00:02:23.909 
there a way to do both well I mean like

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:26.059 
there a way to do both well I mean like
if<00:02:24.150> you<00:02:24.299> guys<00:02:24.480> are<00:02:24.780> super<00:02:25.200> bummed<00:02:25.500> about<00:02:25.739> it

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
if you guys are super bummed about it

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:28.100 
if you guys are super bummed about it
then<00:02:26.430> I'm<00:02:26.790> sure<00:02:26.819> you<00:02:27.120> could<00:02:27.330> just<00:02:27.360> ask<00:02:27.659> radio

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
then I'm sure you could just ask radio

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:29.600 
then I'm sure you could just ask radio
on<00:02:28.290> and<00:02:28.470> they<00:02:28.650> probably<00:02:28.920> just<00:02:29.190> take<00:02:29.340> it<00:02:29.459> down

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
on and they probably just take it down

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.550 
on and they probably just take it down
as<00:02:29.910> for<00:02:30.569> removing<00:02:30.959> the<00:02:31.049> gift<00:02:31.260> from<00:02:31.410> the

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560
