00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:16.890
 sure hello to all guys and well 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.020
 found on android mod 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.990
 today I present the Roma revolution 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:25.110
 version 4 a samsung based based on 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.570
 android 4.1.2 that tries to bring more 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:30.000
 possible elements of the galaxy s 4 on the 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.399
 s2 this already starting from 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.309
 settings as you see are in fact 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:38.040
 divided into four sections as in s4 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.930
 in the first we have the connections in the 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.820
 second device there will be a 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.340
 direct connection to set it 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.650
 background the classic settings for the 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.630
 display and as you can see also the 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:51.270
 multiple window or a multi window 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:53.370
 which we will see later we could regulate 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.980
 directly the multimedia volume 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.860
 we will have sound settings 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.110
 for calls it is a blocking mode 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:03.360
 which will disable notifications in a 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:05.189
 given time frame 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.899
 then we will have the home screen there 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.380
 will allow you to choose between the mode 

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:11.310
 basic and easy mode 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:14.310
 settings for the lock screen 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.229
 classic samsung for quick google that 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.479
 soon we will see and above all 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.270
 for the lockscreen feature of the 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.040
 galaxy s 4 and the galaxy note 3 you have 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.909
 already seen at the beginning of 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.920
 review 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.930
 if you want this lock screen 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.600
 works correctly in that 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:33.000
 samsung classic as protection you need 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.010
 enter none with regard to 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.040
 instead that of the galaxy s 4 you'll have to 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:39.900
 enable it the live act will be present 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.360
 or the light effect you have seen 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.549
 at the beginning and it will be possible to insert 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.049
 links to prevent it coming 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.540
 automatically activated the lockscreen 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:51.240
 stock you will have to enter as already mentioned 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.790
 none and finally you can set the 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.900
 status bar transparent the characters and 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.850
 background 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:58.890
 another option present and modification 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.710
 of the density that will allow you to 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.960
 change the dpi and there are obviously 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.119
 also the classic settings like 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.459
 insertion method and movement 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.709
 energy saving calibration of the 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:13.170
 gyroscope and tongue accessories 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:14.400
 accessibility the third section is 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.439
 dedicated to accounts 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.569
 so we could add save and 

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:19.340
 restore 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:21.859
 of those we have and the last 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.840
 will contain the services for the position and the 

00:02:21.859 --> 00:02:27.019
 security application management 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:29.269
 the battery and the memory from you now 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:31.760
 developer options and info on 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:34.099
 device then all settings 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.349
 classic and another feature of the 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:38.659
 galaxy s 4 which has been inserted into 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:41.269
 this rom and the notification menu 

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:43.400
 as you can see starting from the status 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:45.169
 bar and making a swipe towards the 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.989
 low will open the drop-down menu 

00:02:45.169 --> 00:02:49.760
 classic then with the five instruments 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:52.879
 which in this case cannot be 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:55.219
 modified and brightness is present a 

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:57.439
 link to the settings and a 

00:02:55.219 --> 00:02:59.480
 second link to the tungle menu 

00:02:57.439 --> 00:03:02.090
 also this second drop-down menu 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:04.250
 can be quickly activated with 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:07.069
 a swipe down from the 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:09.169
 watch regarding the tubes not 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:10.040
 there is the possibility to customize them in 

00:03:09.169 --> 00:03:12.109
 complete way 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:14.540
 in fact going to the section 

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:16.609
 device under the heading quick to management 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.769
 girls we can only choose the 

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:21.469
 links shown in the second line 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:22.370
 then unchecking restart device e 

00:03:21.469 --> 00:03:25.129
 spend device 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:27.349
 see that they will be removed however i 

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:29.419
 links will not be rearranged but 

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:31.970
 simply this line will have 3 at 

00:03:29.419 --> 00:03:33.739
 place of five same thing if any 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.000
 we select more than five then 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:36.139
 we also add bluetooth e 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.359
 Data connection 

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:39.919
 and as you see they will always be added 

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:41.989
 on the same line 

00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:44.030
 on the other hand in the classic drop-down menu 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:46.519
 we will have these five connections and not 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:48.859
 we could neither modify them black arrange them 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:50.569
 therefore a slight malfunction for 

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:53.299
 regarding the connections 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:55.340
 ok the default applications are 

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:57.439
 the classic ones as you can see in 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:59.449
 this screen then archive 

00:03:57.439 --> 00:04:00.620
 camera gallery calculator 

00:03:59.449 --> 00:04:03.319
 etc 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:05.629
 the only addition and superuser one thing 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:07.340
 as for the calendar if it is 

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:09.650
 use and interest synchronization 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:11.520
 with the google account you will have to download 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:14.100
 from the Roma trade 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:16.860
 a package called calendar sync 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:18.900
 this one is a simple zip file that 

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:20.820
 will go flashed from recovery and precisely 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.890
 will activate the synchronization of 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:24.930
 default is disabled 

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:26.610
 obviously the link together with that of 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:29.250
 rom thread I'll leave it in 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:31.580
 description well then we go to see 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:33.810
 the camera and the multi window 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:36.060
 camera that of the galaxy s2 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:38.760
 so with the classic settings that 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:39.360
 we know the effects and the methods well 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:43.289
 click 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:46.309
 let's try to take a picture 

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:46.309
 make one with the flash 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:50.550
 a couple common even without 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.689
 and then we go to visualize the 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.289
 result 

00:04:57.689 --> 00:05:01.180
 as you can see above all 

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:03.580
 in the photo with the flash the quality is 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:05.169
 good and the details are sharp 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:07.089
 as you may have noticed and focus 

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:08.949
 click are fast and then the 

00:05:07.089 --> 00:05:10.659
 camera is great 

00:05:08.949 --> 00:05:12.580
 let's go to enable the window 

00:05:10.659 --> 00:05:15.699
 multiple which also in this case is 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:17.830
 that of the galaxy s 4 multi window that is 

00:05:15.699 --> 00:05:20.259
 fully functional is compatible 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:21.610
 with all our applications e 

00:05:20.259 --> 00:05:24.759
 then together with the settings 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:27.430
 we try to open the archive they work 

00:05:24.759 --> 00:05:29.229
 both perfectly flawless 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:31.059
 and of course we can resize it 

00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:33.459
 space dedicated to one rather than 

00:05:31.059 --> 00:05:35.669
 to the other exchange them of place or 

00:05:33.459 --> 00:05:37.539
 view a full screen 

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:39.430
 perfect then we move on to 

00:05:37.539 --> 00:05:42.099
 considerations on energy management 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:44.080
 and on stability with regards to the 

00:05:42.099 --> 00:05:45.999
 before I found myself extremely well 

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:48.159
 with the increased battery from 2000 

00:05:45.999 --> 00:05:50.469
 milian person arrived around 6 pm 

00:05:48.159 --> 00:05:52.300
 19 hours with four and a half hours of 

00:05:50.469 --> 00:05:55.209
 screen and was a result that not 

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:58.029
 had been reaching for about two hours in 3 days 

00:05:55.209 --> 00:05:59.770
 and a rather intense use for what 

00:05:58.029 --> 00:06:01.839
 it's about stability I don't have 

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:04.209
 noticed big problems as I didn't 

00:06:01.839 --> 00:06:06.909
 never found device crushed or 

00:06:04.209 --> 00:06:08.919
 forced restarts but unfortunately the notes 

00:06:06.909 --> 00:06:10.990
 they come when they talk about 

00:06:08.919 --> 00:06:13.209
 fluidity about a week ago I have 

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:15.580
 posted on the facebook page the test 

00:06:13.209 --> 00:06:17.649
 benchmarks of this Roma and the result 

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:21.279
 confirms the reactivity definitely not 

00:06:17.649 --> 00:06:23.259
 exhilarating the score was only 2,750 

00:06:21.279 --> 00:06:26.289
 when on average the samsung based yes 

00:06:23.259 --> 00:06:29.709
 they hold between 3,000 and 4,000 the best 

00:06:26.289 --> 00:06:31.599
 they also manage to reach 4200 4300 

00:06:29.709 --> 00:06:33.789
 the applications definitely put us 

00:06:31.599 --> 00:06:36.459
 too few really open up 

00:06:33.789 --> 00:06:38.800
 you have to wait 20 30 seconds before 

00:06:36.459 --> 00:06:40.749
 see them up and running and in 

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:43.089
 moment in which we begin to have two three 

00:06:40.749 --> 00:06:45.879
 or more applications running in the background 

00:06:43.089 --> 00:06:48.309
 the phone becomes almost unusable 

00:06:45.879 --> 00:06:50.409
 for this I velas council there are 

00:06:48.309 --> 00:06:52.389
 definitely better samsung roms 

00:06:50.409 --> 00:06:53.259
 however if you want to try the two 

00:06:52.389 --> 00:06:55.240
 advice 

00:06:53.259 --> 00:06:57.610
 the first is to download and flash the 

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:59.259
 fashions more performance the six that I leave you 

00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:01.689
 in description it will increase 

00:06:59.259 --> 00:07:03.070
 significantly stability and fluidity 

00:07:01.689 --> 00:07:04.540
 the second is 

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:07.510
 upload the application from the play store 

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:09.790
 there more masters to change the government 

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:11.980
 I tried them all is my advice is 

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:13.870
 to use the pegasus as it is the 

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:16.330
 perfect compromise between savings 

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:18.640
 energy and performance obviously not 

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:21.250
 expect miracles fluidity will remain 

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:24.250
 however at medium-low levels though 

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:25.660
 will improve compared to the beginning with 

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:28.120
 these measures Rome should 

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:28.780
 become usable at least for use 

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:31.120
 daily 

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:33.280
 perfect there is nothing else to say though 

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:36.460
 not that one has come out these days 

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:38.080
 new version the bild a 2014 that 

00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:38.680
 should improve performance 

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:40.960
 General 

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:42.670
 I haven't tested it yet so if the 

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:43.840
 you will try let me know what it is 

00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:45.550
 think 

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:47.130
 I recommend if you liked video 

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:49.630
 remember to put a nice like 

00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:51.220
 share it and make the channel known 

00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:52.600
 for anything do not hesitate to 

00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:55.030
 contact me in the comments below 

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:57.070
 or on facebook or twitter 

00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:59.230
 I leave the useful links as always in 

00:07:57.070 --> 00:08:01.450
 description and therefore I greet you and you
