bury you
so<00:00:14.549> from<00:00:14.849> this<00:00:14.969> bury<00:00:15.179> you're<00:00:15.330> gonna<00:00:15.420> hump<00:00:15.690> down

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
so from this bury you're gonna hump down

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.689 
so from this bury you're gonna hump down
onto<00:00:16.109> the<00:00:16.199> smaller<00:00:16.500> ledge<00:00:16.800> down<00:00:17.100> below<00:00:17.369> me<00:00:17.520> and

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
onto the smaller ledge down below me and

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.400 
onto the smaller ledge down below me and
once<00:00:18.210> you're<00:00:18.359> here<00:00:18.539> you're<00:00:18.690> basically<00:00:19.199> out<00:00:19.289> of

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
once you're here you're basically out of

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.170 
once you're here you're basically out of
the<00:00:19.560> map<00:00:19.680> you're<00:00:19.920> behind<00:00:20.580> all<00:00:20.880> of<00:00:20.910> the

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
the map you're behind all of the

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.970 
the map you're behind all of the
barriers<00:00:21.539> like<00:00:22.050> all<00:00:22.230> the<00:00:22.350> sky<00:00:22.529> barriers<00:00:22.859> and

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
barriers like all the sky barriers and

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.890 
barriers like all the sky barriers and
stuff<00:00:23.220> so<00:00:23.550> technically<00:00:24.090> from<00:00:24.240> here<00:00:24.449> you<00:00:24.660> can

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
stuff so technically from here you can

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.599 
stuff so technically from here you can
get<00:00:25.080> out<00:00:25.199> of<00:00:25.289> the<00:00:25.350> map<00:00:25.500> although<00:00:26.039> it<00:00:26.340> is<00:00:26.430> very

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
get out of the map although it is very

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:27.859 
get out of the map although it is very
difficult<00:00:26.820> in<00:00:27.119> the<00:00:27.180> only<00:00:27.300> place<00:00:27.480> that<00:00:27.689> I<00:00:27.720> know

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
difficult in the only place that I know

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.689 
difficult in the only place that I know
how<00:00:28.019> to<00:00:28.050> do<00:00:28.260> gifted<00:00:28.560> be<00:00:28.650> prone<00:00:28.920> I'm<00:00:29.279> sure<00:00:29.550> with

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
how to do gifted be prone I'm sure with

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.849 
how to do gifted be prone I'm sure with
care<00:00:29.910> packages<00:00:30.390> and<00:00:30.630> a<00:00:31.199> lot<00:00:31.470> of<00:00:31.500> luck<00:00:31.710> you

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
could probably get out of the map

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.819 
could probably get out of the map
completely<00:00:33.270> from<00:00:33.719> this<00:00:33.870> but<00:00:34.440> anyway<00:00:34.620> guys
