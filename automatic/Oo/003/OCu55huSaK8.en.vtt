00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:12.740 
ph what is the ph and pH of a solution

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:20.480 
ph what is the ph and pH of a solution
which<00:00:13.740> is<00:00:17.359> 1.4<00:00:18.359> times<00:00:19.260> 10<00:00:19.650> to<00:00:19.680> the<00:00:19.800> negative<00:00:20.010> 3

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
which is 1.4 times 10 to the negative 3

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:27.230 
which is 1.4 times 10 to the negative 3
molar<00:00:21.769> hydroxide<00:00:24.170> okay<00:00:25.250> well<00:00:26.250> they<00:00:26.939> want<00:00:27.060> the

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
molar hydroxide okay well they want the

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.349 
molar hydroxide okay well they want the
pH<00:00:27.510> and<00:00:27.660> they<00:00:27.750> want<00:00:27.930> the<00:00:28.019> Poh<00:00:28.730> well<00:00:29.730> i<00:00:29.970> know<00:00:30.150> the

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
pH and they want the Poh well i know the

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.569 
pH and they want the Poh well i know the
ph<00:00:30.689> is<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.349> negative<00:00:31.859> log<00:00:32.219> of<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.489> hydrogen

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
ph is the negative log of the hydrogen

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.630 
ph is the negative log of the hydrogen
ion<00:00:33.120> concentration<00:00:33.800> Poh<00:00:34.800> is<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.430> negative

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
ion concentration Poh is the negative

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.450 
ion concentration Poh is the negative
log<00:00:35.969> of<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.149> hydroxide<00:00:36.719> ion<00:00:36.750> concentration

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:37.460 
log of the hydroxide ion concentration

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.470 
log of the hydroxide ion concentration
well<00:00:38.460> they<00:00:38.550> give<00:00:38.730> me<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:38.940> hydroxide<00:00:39.450> ion

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
well they give me the hydroxide ion

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.060 
well they give me the hydroxide ion
concentration<00:00:39.690> so<00:00:40.469> why<00:00:40.559> don't<00:00:40.710> I<00:00:40.739> just<00:00:40.770> deal

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
concentration so why don't I just deal

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.049 
concentration so why don't I just deal
with<00:00:41.219> that<00:00:41.340> one<00:00:41.520> first<00:00:41.809> so<00:00:42.809> poh<00:00:43.559> is<00:00:43.920> equal<00:00:44.550> to

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
with that one first so poh is equal to

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.520 
with that one first so poh is equal to
negative<00:00:45.360> log<00:00:46.320> of<00:00:46.820> the<00:00:48.050> o.h<00:00:49.050> minus

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
negative log of the o.h minus

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.459 
negative log of the o.h minus
concentration<00:00:49.739> which<00:00:50.579> is<00:00:50.730> negative<00:00:51.030> log<00:00:51.780> of<00:00:51.809> 1

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
concentration which is negative log of 1

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.060 
concentration which is negative log of 1
point<00:00:52.800> 4<00:00:53.280> times<00:00:54.239> 10<00:00:54.539> to<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.690> negative<00:00:54.809> 3<00:00:55.230> so<00:00:56.039> I

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
point 4 times 10 to the negative 3 so I

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.830 
point 4 times 10 to the negative 3 so I
just<00:00:56.309> stick<00:00:56.820> in<00:00:57.059> you<00:00:57.390> know<00:00:57.480> this<00:00:57.629> in<00:00:57.750> the

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
just stick in you know this in the

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.840 
just stick in you know this in the
calculator<00:00:57.989> I<00:00:58.559> take<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.039> logarithm<00:00:59.250> of<00:00:59.609> it<00:00:59.730> I

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
calculator I take the logarithm of it I

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.740 
calculator I take the logarithm of it I
change<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.359> sign<00:01:00.690> and<00:01:01.020> i<00:01:01.469> end<00:01:01.680> up<00:01:01.890> with<00:01:04.670> 2.85

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750 
change the sign and i end up with 2.85

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.080 
change the sign and i end up with 2.85
so<00:01:06.750> notice<00:01:07.080> 2.85<00:01:07.860> is<00:01:08.189> a<00:01:08.220> much<00:01:08.430> more<00:01:08.460> attractive

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
so notice 2.85 is a much more attractive

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.760 
so notice 2.85 is a much more attractive
number<00:01:09.360> than<00:01:09.540> 1.4<00:01:10.080> times<00:01:10.320> 10<00:01:10.530> to<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.650> negative

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
number than 1.4 times 10 to the negative

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.190 
number than 1.4 times 10 to the negative
3<00:01:11.159> at<00:01:11.430> least<00:01:11.549> that's<00:01:11.729> many<00:01:12.450> people<00:01:12.720> think<00:01:12.930> I

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
3 at least that's many people think I

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.960 
3 at least that's many people think I
personally<00:01:13.710> don't<00:01:14.070> think<00:01:14.189> so<00:01:14.520> but<00:01:14.820> that's

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
personally don't think so but that's

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.060 
personally don't think so but that's
fine<00:01:15.240> you<00:01:15.750> know<00:01:15.840> I'm<00:01:15.900> a<00:01:15.960> chemist<00:01:16.140> we<00:01:16.740> deal<00:01:16.950> with

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
fine you know I'm a chemist we deal with

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.300 
fine you know I'm a chemist we deal with
ph's<00:01:17.400> will<00:01:18.030> deal<00:01:18.210> with<00:01:18.390> ph's<00:01:18.720> but<00:01:19.710> don't<00:01:20.100> think

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
ph's will deal with ph's but don't think

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.219 
ph's will deal with ph's but don't think
it's<00:01:20.430> something<00:01:20.610> different<00:01:20.850> it's<00:01:21.240> not<00:01:21.450> if<00:01:21.689> you

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
it's something different it's not if you

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.050 
it's something different it's not if you
want<00:01:22.470> to<00:01:22.650> you<00:01:23.070> are<00:01:23.220> more<00:01:23.460> than<00:01:23.610> welcome<00:01:23.670> to

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
want to you are more than welcome to

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.789 
want to you are more than welcome to
deal<00:01:24.210> with<00:01:24.330> strictly<00:01:24.750> in<00:01:24.840> concentrations<00:01:25.590> and

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
deal with strictly in concentrations and

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.740 
deal with strictly in concentrations and
if<00:01:26.220> you<00:01:26.310> ever<00:01:26.340> have<00:01:26.610> to<00:01:26.700> find<00:01:26.939> a<00:01:27.030> pH<00:01:27.299> just<00:01:27.630> that

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
if you ever have to find a pH just that

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.240 
if you ever have to find a pH just that
the<00:01:27.840> last<00:01:27.869> minute<00:01:28.350> take<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.680> negative<00:01:28.829> log<00:01:29.189> of

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
the last minute take the negative log of

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.249 
the last minute take the negative log of
it<00:01:29.460> no<00:01:30.210> harm<00:01:30.450> no<00:01:30.509> foul<00:01:31.729> now<00:01:32.729> we<00:01:33.600> want<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:33.869> ph

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
it no harm no foul now we want the ph

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.330 
it no harm no foul now we want the ph
with<00:01:34.740> a<00:01:34.860> ph<00:01:35.369> will<00:01:35.729> we<00:01:35.880> know<00:01:36.090> that<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.600> h

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
with a ph will we know that the h

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.130 
with a ph will we know that the h
concentration<00:01:38.340> times<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.420> 0<00:01:39.509> h<00:01:39.840> minus

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.010 
concentration times the 0 h minus
concentration<00:01:40.560> is<00:01:41.280> equal<00:01:41.369> to<00:01:41.700> 1.0<00:01:42.329> times<00:01:42.750> 10

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020

to<00:01:43.049> the<00:01:43.140> negative<00:01:43.290> 14<00:01:44.390> so<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:45.540> h+

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
to the negative 14 so the h+

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.130 
to the negative 14 so the h+
concentration<00:01:46.460> equals<00:01:47.460> 1<00:01:47.700> point<00:01:48.090> 0<00:01:48.270> 0<00:01:48.659> times
