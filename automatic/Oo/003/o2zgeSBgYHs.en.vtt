00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:14.160
 two words about the bottle we will use 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.230
 in these experiments in this case one 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.510
 bottle for free you can't 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:22.050
 buy in many supermarkets and in 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:24.779
 any pharmacy is fine too 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.630
 milk bottle in glass unfortunately 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:30.000
 but now they are not found 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.320
 bottles easily in supermarkets 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.450
 art back 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.710
 this is the bottle we're going to go to 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.510
 refer to 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.000
 the challenge is to succeed in inserting 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:43.469
 inside this bottle an egg 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:46.110
 hard without breaking the hard egg 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.809
 the moment is solemn how to succeed in 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.550
 put this man inside this one 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.649
 glass bottle 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.540
 the bottle we see is one of those 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.910
 milk bottles 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:59.140
 born or because of the glass chamomile that is 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:01.750
 located in any supermarket 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.970
 any pharmacy and this is ours 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:07.180
 hard-boiled egg how to put it 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:10.860
 inside without breaking the egg I know between 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.860
 little solution 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.549
 this is the solution to our challenge 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:26.020
 impossible we need a little 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:28.450
 wet cotton wool with alcohol of 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:33.579
 see bile flame is put like that 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:39.640
 inside the bottle we light up 

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:43.090
 on each front we light the cotton wool and 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:46.569
 let's just put our man right there 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:48.490
 thus manages to enter inside the 

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:50.280
 bottle without boys 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:53.289
 what is the explanation of this trick 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:57.149
 burning the bow creates a vacuum 

00:01:53.289 --> 00:02:00.039
 this vacuum sucks 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.569
 inside egg without breaking it 

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:03.880
 now we can see the place from 

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:06.899
 any new angle 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:10.899
 absolutely intact and entered thanks 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:13.239
 to the vacuum created by the cotton that is 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:14.860
 inflamed questori mind came to 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:16.599
 first try 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:23.100
 so I have a little too much and eggs 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:23.100
 soda this is for you take it
