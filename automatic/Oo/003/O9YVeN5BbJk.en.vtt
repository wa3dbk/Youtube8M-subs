00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:05.600
 good as a complement to the video 

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:08.300
 above let's make an example of 

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:11.090
 animated texture on a billboard the 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:13.460
 Animated textures are a technique used 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:16.550
 in games to create explosions 

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:18.980
 fire and other effects a 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:21.800
 texture divided into its images and 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.980
 object is each of the 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.749
 sub images over time 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:29.810
 blender game engine supports this 

00:00:26.749 --> 00:00:31.909
 mechanism we start from our file 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:35.750
 base point blend that together with the 

00:00:31.909 --> 00:00:38.530
 fire png texture and the result I put 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:42.250
 linked in the comments 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:44.500
 as we can see the texture consists of 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:47.199
 8 flames located on a grid 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:51.699
 imaginary in the image four wide 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:53.350
 by two high the format is png with the 

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:56.360
 transparent background 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:59.030
 I return to blender 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:02.090
 with the selected cube we place the 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:06.620
 3d cursor in its center capitals more 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:10.300
 that cursor to selected and then we erase 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:12.800
 the cube x and confirm 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:15.440
 we followed the procedure to create a 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:17.820
 video board to guide a plane in 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:22.810
 negative direction 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:25.030
 uppercase Mayan month to plane for 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:27.369
 create the plane 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.440
 this time I will guide you in 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:33.450
 edit mode 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.450
 I enter key edit mode 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:42.180
 how everything is selected I do 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:45.010
 and minus 90 intro to be oriented to 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.290
 this negative x 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:49.540
 how do I need it to be twice as high 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:51.880
 that wide according to the proportions of 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:53.710
 every his texture image I'm going to 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.990
 scale it vertically around the 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:58.720
 origin I put the center of 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:03.060
 transformations the cursor 3d key 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:07.810
 point I place the cursor on the origin 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:15.680
 capitals plus that course to center and 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:17.390
 I write sct2 intro I go out edition mode 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:21.000
 I leave the center again 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:23.910
 transformation through point 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:30.800
 I save the file in my directory 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:30.800
 work as text anim dot blend 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:38.150
 I go to the material tab and I add a 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.150
 material 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:44.360
 select up game engine 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:47.150
 blender game I go to the tab 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:50.060
 textures and I add a texture by pressing 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:54.700
 the new button 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.700
 I call it fire 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:02.650
 type image or film 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:06.530
 under the image panel and I open the file 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:09.890
 fire point png 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:12.260
 now I strike the icon next to the name of 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:15.130
 file so that it is included within 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:18.370
 our blender file 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:22.140
 I go to the Data tab 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:25.590
 created a map v 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:30.330
 I go back to the texture tab and the 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:32.370
 panel mapping I choose coordinates v and that 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:36.560
 Map 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:41.150
 went down to the influence section and active 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:41.150
 alpha plus color 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.850
 I return to the material and change what is necessary 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:47.990
 to make it a billboard with 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:51.650
 transparency 

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:57.870
 in hayling zeitler 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:04:00.690
 in game settings 6 orientation billboard 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:04.019
 and in alpha blend I put up for now 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:08.100
 clip as before under the panel 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:11.700
 transparency active transparency 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:14.870
 and with type z transparency I put your 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.870
 alpha to 0 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:22.810
 I go to the desktop v editing 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:25.470
 in window 3 of active representation 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:25.470
 textured 

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:34.360
 I enter edit mode and in the window 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:34.360
 of image I choose fire png 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:40.230
 in this image window I select 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:44.370
 all key 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:49.270
 and to straighten the texture click r - 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:52.210
 90 intro now comes the important 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:54.310
 in the properties side panel only 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:57.220
 if we have selected the blend engine 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:05:00.630
 the game appears in the game section 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:04.990
 properties in the game 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:08.540
 we activate animated animated is to say that 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:12.290
 it's animated texture 

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:15.620
 in such that we put them how many sub 

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:18.969
 images wide in x and high in y 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:24.779
 It has our texture 

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:24.779
 in our case I put 4 and 2 

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:31.320
 in speed speed you put the number of 

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:33.110
 your images or frames per second of 

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:35.540
 the animation 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:38.140
 I'm going to put 20 to go pretty 

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:38.140
 Quick 

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:45.310
 Finally, in start and in, the 

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:49.900
 number of your image to start and 

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:54.080
 why end up I put 0 and 7 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:57.449
 respectively the first and the last 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:06:00.569
 I go out in edit mode 

00:05:57.449 --> 00:06:05.629
 except the file 

00:06:00.569 --> 00:06:05.629
 and in window 3 of pulse p 

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:15.920
 escape if it does not work 

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:20.300
 I reload the file file 

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:22.600
 open and return to choose text sanÃ­n punto 

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:26.200
 blend 

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:26.830
 this must be a blender error I come back 

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:31.170
 Approve 

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:31.170
 by clicking on window 3 of p 

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:38.020
 now it works 

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:42.080
 escape I return to the desktop by default 

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:48.430
 and change in the material in the game 

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:48.430
 settings of alpha click to alpha blend 

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:57.320
 active camera view 0 keyboard 

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:57.320
 numeric and pulse again p 

00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:03.260
 the result is better because we can 

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:07.390
 see through the flames 

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:07.390
 escape and save the file 

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:12.590
 that has been all thanks
