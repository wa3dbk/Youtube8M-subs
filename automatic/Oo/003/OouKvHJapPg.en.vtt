00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
stalkers as well we'll see how this is

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.020 
stalkers as well we'll see how this is
really<00:00:14.040> going<00:00:14.130> to<00:00:14.219> work<00:00:14.309> as<00:00:14.490> we<00:00:14.610> already<00:00:14.790> have

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
really going to work as we already have

really going to work as we already have
cannons<00:00:15.839> on<00:00:16.020> this<00:00:16.260> high<00:00:16.440> ground<00:00:16.470> very<00:00:16.980> nicely

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
cannons on this high ground very nicely

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.920 
cannons on this high ground very nicely
done<00:00:17.490> tenants<00:00:18.180> on<00:00:18.270> that<00:00:18.420> high<00:00:18.570> ground<00:00:18.810> and

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
done tenants on that high ground and

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.570 
done tenants on that high ground and
very<00:00:19.320> nice<00:00:19.500> another<00:00:19.830> force<00:00:20.130> field<00:00:20.369> coming

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
very nice another force field coming

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.670 
very nice another force field coming
into<00:00:20.820> position<00:00:21.300> stalkers<00:00:22.199> and<00:00:22.230> roaches

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
into position stalkers and roaches

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.080 
into position stalkers and roaches
trying<00:00:22.920> to<00:00:22.980> take<00:00:23.189> down<00:00:23.220> that<00:00:23.400> one<00:00:23.789> gateway

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
trying to take down that one gateway

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.700 
trying to take down that one gateway
gateway<00:00:24.420> getting<00:00:24.779> pho<00:00:24.930> get<00:00:25.080> down<00:00:25.199> very<00:00:25.470> very

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
gateway getting pho get down very very

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.550 
gateway getting pho get down very very
easily<00:00:25.920> down<00:00:26.699> it<00:00:26.910> goes<00:00:27.119> and<00:00:27.449> now<00:00:27.960> those

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
easily down it goes and now those

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.800 
easily down it goes and now those
roaches<00:00:29.519> really<00:00:30.119> have<00:00:30.240> to<00:00:30.330> be<00:00:30.420> careful<00:00:30.449> about

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
roaches really have to be careful about

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.569 
roaches really have to be careful about
those<00:00:31.109> two<00:00:31.349> photon<00:00:31.740> cannons<00:00:32.099> sitting<00:00:32.399> off

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
those two photon cannons sitting off

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.240 
those two photon cannons sitting off
over<00:00:32.969> here<00:00:33.180> on<00:00:33.390> that<00:00:33.600> high<00:00:33.780> ground<00:00:34.250> more

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
over here on that high ground more

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.700 
over here on that high ground more
cannons<00:00:36.000> being<00:00:36.210> worked<00:00:36.510> in<00:00:36.630> as<00:00:36.750> well<00:00:36.960> so<00:00:37.230> those

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
cannons being worked in as well so those

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.380 
cannons being worked in as well so those
roaches<00:00:38.040> really<00:00:38.579> have<00:00:38.760> nowhere<00:00:39.059> to<00:00:39.239> really

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
roaches really have nowhere to really

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:40.790 
roaches really have nowhere to really
push<00:00:39.719> on<00:00:39.930> through<00:00:40.200> perhaps<00:00:40.440> are<00:00:40.530> going<00:00:40.649> to<00:00:40.710> try

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
push on through perhaps are going to try

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.069 
push on through perhaps are going to try
to<00:00:40.860> run<00:00:40.950> up<00:00:41.370> that<00:00:41.399> ramp<00:00:41.910> and<00:00:42.149> then<00:00:42.660> take<00:00:42.870> down

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
to run up that ramp and then take down

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.979 
to run up that ramp and then take down
these<00:00:43.230> cannons<00:00:43.590> over<00:00:43.770> here<00:00:43.980> so<00:00:44.750> I'm<00:00:45.750> going<00:00:45.930> to

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
these cannons over here so I'm going to

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.299 
these cannons over here so I'm going to
go<00:00:46.110> ahead<00:00:46.260> and<00:00:46.350> continue<00:00:46.590> to<00:00:46.829> fight<00:00:47.070> but<00:00:47.219> if

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
go ahead and continue to fight but if

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.180 
go ahead and continue to fight but if
they<00:00:47.399> do<00:00:47.700> ahead<00:00:47.850> do<00:00:48.270> in<00:00:48.420> fact<00:00:48.600> go<00:00:48.899> up<00:00:49.320> that<00:00:49.920> ramp

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
they do ahead do in fact go up that ramp

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.950 
they do ahead do in fact go up that ramp
that<00:00:50.399> may<00:00:50.579> be<00:00:50.640> a<00:00:50.730> little<00:00:50.940> bit<00:00:51.149> of<00:00:51.239> bad<00:00:51.480> news<00:00:51.510> as

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
that may be a little bit of bad news as

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.900 
that may be a little bit of bad news as
those<00:00:52.469> centuries<00:00:52.829> will<00:00:53.010> it<00:00:53.190> will<00:00:53.550> really<00:00:53.730> be

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
those centuries will it will really be

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.760 
those centuries will it will really be
able<00:00:54.030> to<00:00:54.180> just<00:00:54.300> push<00:00:54.570> down<00:00:54.600> and<00:00:55.050> continue<00:00:55.469> to

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
able to just push down and continue to

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:56.840 
able to just push down and continue to
take<00:00:55.949> down<00:00:56.070> more<00:00:56.309> of<00:00:56.370> these<00:00:56.460> you<00:00:56.550> deserve

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
take down more of these you deserve

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.250 
take down more of these you deserve

taken<00:00:58.500> down<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:59.010> losses<00:00:59.399> should<00:00:59.550> really<00:01:00.059> be

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
taken down the losses should really be

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.029 
taken down the losses should really be

going for the kill I'm making sure now
that<00:01:07.950> those<00:01:08.159> units<00:01:08.430> are<00:01:08.520> just<00:01:08.700> stuck<00:01:08.909> on<00:01:09.090> that
