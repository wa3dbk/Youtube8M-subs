 It is yes, and the first machine and evaluation that we made last time 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:43.340
 It is the one of the 1st machine , but it is 8 Battery is completely dead It has died 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.340
 More and more will remove the it from here it does not it is the undue importance Parts 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:47.320
 web N 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:57.020
 Remove the screw at the corner 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.830
 right 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:04.660
 I first temperature ok expected to be the line to 

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:04.660
 This can be used if interchanging the I Tanaka 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:13.350
 I tried to break it down to the parts 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:16.530
 I do not use this time with this switch 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:20.490
 As it is low pressure system, other sound parts are again 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:25.500
 I want to put it in the rear box so that it can be used at another high speed 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:28.880
 It's a tool box, but as I said earlier, this battery itself is a little 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.880
 Because I died because I can not use it anymore 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.880
 Hmm 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.500
 Hmm 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.250
 me 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.250
 ni 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.480
 ni 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:19.340
 Well, no such good thing 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:25.470
 Illegal dumping of waste is illegal 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:30.860
 You may be fined up to 10 million yen in prison for up to 5 years 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:32.910
 Dispose of trash according to the rules of your local government 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:37.930
 ac 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:39.210
 Gatten to the public school 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:42.210
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:42.210
 bj 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:49.579
 Yes, and it's had used until even now I'd battery is use this time in which this 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:54.980
 is 

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:59.659
 Please take a look at the size and it's quite different. 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:03.060
 This time, I used a battery that is not sealed for budget reasons , but this is also 

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:09.360
 It was safe to tilt in the sense of sealing 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:14.130
 Please look because this You're a normal open type of battery is also but I'm 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:17.910
 I hope you will understand in the future there is water in it 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:19.510
 It is Mochotto in I'm there is a 2 to Fu such ne prima facie 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:22.930
 Do you understand 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:27.790
 Since it has vacant rain for breath it is in this kind of Fu 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:32.349
 If it falls by any chance this year , the water in the room will come out from here and the battery will be useless. 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:36.370
 I say this with the fact that love that there is a risk that a little or it is or 

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:39.530
 So as not to move it this way in the case 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:39.940
 I want to fix it using a bracket 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:43.540
 I will 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:50.470
 Nde hard to see if it is a little in looks Yes Well Kedomo has been put out to the outside 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:51.070
 I think I want to stop from it four locations all directions a l-shaped metal fitting in the sound image that say this from it 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:57.370
 is not it 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:59.960
 I would like to skid directly with metal fittings, so I want to slip a bit on the mud with fine scratches 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:00.260
 I say, will you of in 

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:05.689
 Hmm 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:08.810
 Stick a rubber plate in between with adhesive and protect it 

00:04:05.689 --> 00:04:11.870
 I want to put a slip on it 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:18.530
 In 8 is I aluminum tape in order to 1 Period eyes 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:19.310
 I installed the 8 bracket ridges and I think that I want to put this in the case as it is 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:20.250
 I will 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:22.840
 Do you say 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:29.380
 I will attach it, but 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:34.570
 Such it is a bit dark Nde example It is actually illuminates the write this container 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:40.479
 I there is now contains a ne a muscle in order to strong on the inside 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:42.300
 If you hit it , you can't make a hole well, so it 's a bit like a cross between them 

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:46.080
 Were we 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:50.590
 Well then in this condition we will open a hole 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:54.580
 I felt like this I opened a hole in 4 places 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:59.090
 I will put a screw in the back from this hole 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:05:11.479
 Let's put on the deck where the liquid here spills 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:19.080
 It means that it is like this, 4 loves are no longer 

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:20.500
 To this the I Ie medical Kedomo all round you bought and Patti outside the path is now stronger 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:21.830
 is 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:24.830
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:24.830
 deh 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:29.990
 Yes And this kind of turn is such a sound clip 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:35.180
 What 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:39.449
 I'm taking that power, but with this, I might get out of it while on the move and after 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:43.460
 It is a bit because I can't branch with this . 

00:05:39.449 --> 00:05:47.660
 Give the part that says this kind of terminal 

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:52.370
 Haiter is And then I put a familiar Nee 

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:53.720
 I say this to the machine described later though of this Kedomo I wear this kind of opportunity sound 

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:55.980
 The output is mostly 

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:58.639
 Overwhelming 350 

00:05:55.980 --> 00:06:04.370
 In that 

00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:08.900
 Yes I 'm putting this on this terminal, but please try 8 and say 480 watts 

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:14.270
 A little big thing is selected 

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:18.410
 By then the fact that Kedomo I cables This Is It 15 amps 

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:21.560
 It becomes something that can be used up to 1500 Watts 

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:26.190
 At 8 this is heat resistant 

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:31.580
 I wanted to reuse the cable that I used for the hot plate 

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:36.080
 It becomes like this if you cut the outlet slightly and descend the cable ridge 

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:41.090
 Yes I did not like this I made the terminal 

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:43.070
 Switch on for loss &amp; energy saving 

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:48.010
 It looks like this 

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:48.010
 Let's test the first switch pom pom 

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:51.830
 The second switch-on 

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:56.620
 It is ok 

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:00.710
