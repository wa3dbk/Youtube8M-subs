00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:11.510
 pity 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:14.629
 a great game I think the players 

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:18.380
 they made a great effort and we were 

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:22.300
 escaped by a deconcentration 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:24.760
 with this in this class of matches 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:28.100
 you have to be constantly 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:30.560
 concentrated and well we fail where not 

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:32.329
 we had to fail now we have a 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:36.140
 party more at home where we have to 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:39.980
 to win the same result today 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:42.050
 we had to win and well convinced of 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:46.039
 what we can give as a team very very 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:49.760
 grateful for the support and a pity 

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:51.589
 that we could not give him a good 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.019
 good result you leave with a bad taste 

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:56.120
 of mouth because you see that you have been able 

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:58.129
 get at least one point in a 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.620
 field as difficult as the one in Paris 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:02.269
 saint germain but good you have to think 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:05.710
 that we are alive in the competition that 

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:08.270
 we depend on ourselves we have 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.190
 even having tied we would have to 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.410
 the obligation to gain control anderle 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.030
 with which you have to think that there is a 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:15.890
 match ahead we play in 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:19.360
 our house and that we are going to give everything 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.360
 to move on to the next phase 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:25.320
 let's fight to the end and good 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.000
 we have the last game of 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.800
 champions against selling you at home 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.320

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.910
 us and good we are going to give everything and 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.910

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.330
 moment and we only have words 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.130
 of gratitude to them 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.750

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.600
 unconditional support that they always give us 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:51.930
 and it's a shame not to be able to have them 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.720
 provided a good victory which we 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:57.330
