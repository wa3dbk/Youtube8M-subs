00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:27.510 
interesting as both tablets pretty much
have<00:03:25.570> the<00:03:25.690> same<00:03:25.720> pixel<00:03:26.320> density<00:03:26.800> but<00:03:27.220> still

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:27.520 
have the same pixel density but still

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:29.070 
have the same pixel density but still
apparently<00:03:27.940> the<00:03:28.090> company<00:03:28.450> is<00:03:28.570> working<00:03:28.840> on

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:29.080 
apparently the company is working on

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.230 
apparently the company is working on
bringing<00:03:29.440> us<00:03:29.770> a<00:03:29.800> more<00:03:30.130> productive<00:03:30.460> ipad<00:03:31.000> air

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:31.240 
bringing us a more productive ipad air

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:33.600 
bringing us a more productive ipad air
and<00:03:31.270> the<00:03:31.480> iPad<00:03:31.510> Mini<00:03:32.020> will<00:03:32.230> not<00:03:32.530> be<00:03:32.860> which<00:03:33.490> is

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:33.610 
and the iPad Mini will not be which is

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:34.860 
and the iPad Mini will not be which is
really<00:03:33.790> interesting<00:03:33.970> it's<00:03:34.330> really<00:03:34.540> hard<00:03:34.720> to

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
really interesting it's really hard to

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.240 
really interesting it's really hard to
know<00:03:35.020> exactly<00:03:35.170> what<00:03:35.620> Apple<00:03:35.890> plans<00:03:36.100> but

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
know exactly what Apple plans but

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:37.980 
know exactly what Apple plans but
apparently<00:03:36.610> it<00:03:36.700> includes<00:03:37.090> a<00:03:37.390> very<00:03:37.690> cool

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:37.990 
apparently it includes a very cool

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:39.840 
apparently it includes a very cool
option<00:03:38.530> to<00:03:38.650> allow<00:03:38.770> they<00:03:39.070> share<00:03:39.310> data<00:03:39.580> between

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:39.850 
option to allow they share data between

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:42.510 
option to allow they share data between
applications<00:03:40.390> as<00:03:40.990> well<00:03:41.020> but<00:03:41.920> that<00:03:42.250> leads<00:03:42.430> you

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:42.520 
applications as well but that leads you

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:44.790 
applications as well but that leads you
to<00:03:42.640> the<00:03:42.760> question<00:03:43.030> of<00:03:43.090> the<00:03:43.210> day<00:03:43.260> how<00:03:44.260> important

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:44.800 
to the question of the day how important

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.460 
to the question of the day how important
is<00:03:44.890> split-screen<00:03:45.610> multitasking<00:03:46.030> for<00:03:46.720> you<00:03:47.020> in

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
is split-screen multitasking for you in

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.310 
is split-screen multitasking for you in
my<00:03:47.830> particular<00:03:48.220> case<00:03:48.280> it<00:03:48.880> is<00:03:49.000> basic<00:03:49.600> I<00:03:49.810> mean<00:03:50.050> I

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:50.320 
my particular case it is basic I mean I

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.500 
my particular case it is basic I mean I
find<00:03:50.830> myself<00:03:51.010> not<00:03:51.400> using<00:03:51.790> tablets<00:03:52.180> lately

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510 
find myself not using tablets lately

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:54.210 
find myself not using tablets lately
because<00:03:52.840> I<00:03:52.930> just<00:03:53.170> can't<00:03:53.410> be<00:03:53.560> productive<00:03:54.040> with

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
because I just can't be productive with

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:56.130 
because I just can't be productive with
them<00:03:54.460> so<00:03:54.910> it's<00:03:54.940> an<00:03:55.270> extra<00:03:55.540> thing<00:03:55.720> to<00:03:55.840> carry

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:56.140 
them so it's an extra thing to carry

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:57.810 
them so it's an extra thing to carry
around<00:03:56.230> along<00:03:56.800> from<00:03:57.040> your<00:03:57.190> laptop<00:03:57.460> and

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:57.820 
around along from your laptop and

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:59.880 
around along from your laptop and
definitely<00:03:58.630> windows<00:03:58.960> 8<00:03:59.140> doesn't<00:03:59.410> really<00:03:59.530> pull

00:03:59.880 --> 00:03:59.890 
definitely windows 8 doesn't really pull

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:01.590 
definitely windows 8 doesn't really pull
it<00:04:00.010> off<00:04:00.160> and<00:04:00.280> a<00:04:00.340> lot<00:04:00.520> of<00:04:00.640> things<00:04:00.760> but<00:04:00.940> leave<00:04:01.480> us

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:01.600 
it off and a lot of things but leave us

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.030 
it off and a lot of things but leave us
