00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.270 
back to hutches today to get a little
issue<00:00:35.700> solved<00:00:36.300> but<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:37.230> seats<00:00:37.530> thicker<00:00:37.890> here

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
issue solved but the seats thicker here

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.940 
issue solved but the seats thicker here
at<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.489> bottom<00:00:38.790> of<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:38.969> pole<00:00:39.329> and<00:00:39.719> it<00:00:40.710> tapers

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
at the bottom of the pole and it tapers

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.979 
at the bottom of the pole and it tapers
and<00:00:41.460> as<00:00:41.640> it<00:00:41.820> tapers<00:00:42.180> it<00:00:42.329> gets<00:00:42.480> smaller<00:00:42.780> up

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
and as it tapers it gets smaller up

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.690 
and as it tapers it gets smaller up
toward<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.350> top<00:00:43.559> so<00:00:43.920> if<00:00:44.010> you<00:00:44.100> have<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.460> seat

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
toward the top so if you have the seat

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.600 
toward the top so if you have the seat
too<00:00:44.969> far<00:00:45.000> low<00:00:45.510> this<00:00:46.500> clamp<00:00:46.890> can't<00:00:47.190> get<00:00:47.370> tight

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
too far low this clamp can't get tight

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.520 
too far low this clamp can't get tight
enough<00:00:47.879> to<00:00:48.090> hold<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.420> seat<00:00:48.629> in<00:00:48.750> place<00:00:48.930> and

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
enough to hold the seat in place and

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.350 
enough to hold the seat in place and
that's<00:00:49.710> a<00:00:49.829> major<00:00:49.980> bummer<00:00:50.160> so<00:00:50.789> we<00:00:50.940> just<00:00:51.120> raised

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
that's a major bummer so we just raised

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:57.500 
that's a major bummer so we just raised
the<00:00:51.600> seat<00:00:51.809> up<00:00:51.960> a<00:00:52.050> bit<00:00:54.469> and<00:00:55.469> now<00:00:56.039> it's<00:00:56.489> as<00:00:57.239> it

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510
