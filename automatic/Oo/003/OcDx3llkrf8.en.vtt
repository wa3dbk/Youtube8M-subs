00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
going to get bruises but there's a point

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.450 
going to get bruises but there's a point
where<00:01:34.409> you're<00:01:34.530> going<00:01:34.680> to<00:01:34.740> protect<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.280> other

I<00:01:42.780> said<00:01:42.840> sometimes<00:01:42.990> you<00:01:43.770> got<00:01:43.890> to<00:01:44.009> turn<00:01:44.250> it<00:01:44.280> up

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
I said sometimes you got to turn it up

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:45.440 
I said sometimes you got to turn it up
sometimes<00:01:44.850> you<00:01:44.909> got<00:01:45.030> to<00:01:45.090> turn<00:01:45.210> up<00:01:45.329> the

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
sometimes you got to turn up the

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.660 
sometimes you got to turn up the
physicality<00:01:45.840> and<00:01:46.110> I<00:01:46.200> know<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:46.500> WWE<00:01:47.100> has<00:01:47.250> been

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
physicality and I know the WWE has been

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.490 
physicality and I know the WWE has been
wanting<00:01:48.030> to<00:01:48.149> book<00:01:48.390> Alberto<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:49.049> real<00:01:49.170> to<00:01:49.350> be<00:01:49.470> a

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
wanting to book Alberto the real to be a

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.170 
wanting to book Alberto the real to be a
little<00:01:49.710> bit<00:01:49.890> more<00:01:50.040> physical<00:01:50.490> in<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:50.610> ring<00:01:50.820> but

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
little bit more physical in the ring but

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.639 
little bit more physical in the ring but
I<00:01:51.240> think<00:01:51.450> Alberto<00:01:51.750> Del<00:01:51.960> Rio<00:01:52.049> gets<00:01:52.350> to<00:01:52.530> be<00:01:52.619> a

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
I think Alberto Del Rio gets to be a

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.130 
I think Alberto Del Rio gets to be a
little<00:01:52.799> bit<00:01:52.950> too<00:01:53.280> physical<00:01:54.119> for<00:01:54.270> his<00:01:54.689> own<00:01:54.840> good

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
little bit too physical for his own good

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.929 
little bit too physical for his own good
now<00:01:55.710> remember<00:01:55.920> Del<00:01:56.310> Rio<00:01:56.430> has<00:01:56.610> to<00:01:56.759> remember

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
now remember Del Rio has to remember

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.450 
now remember Del Rio has to remember
he's<00:01:57.149> not<00:01:57.299> in<00:01:57.420> MMA<00:01:57.840> is<00:01:57.899> not<00:01:58.020> in<00:01:58.259> UFC<00:01:58.560> it's<00:01:59.340> a

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
he's not in MMA is not in UFC it's a

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:00.950 
he's not in MMA is not in UFC it's a
whole<00:01:59.670> different<00:01:59.880> ballgame<00:02:00.270> if<00:02:00.630> you<00:02:00.689> wants<00:02:00.899> to

to<00:02:03.000> UFC<00:02:03.630> and<00:02:03.810> MMA<00:02:03.930> because<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:04.680> WWE<00:02:04.979> is<00:02:05.310> not
