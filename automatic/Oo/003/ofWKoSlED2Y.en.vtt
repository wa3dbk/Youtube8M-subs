00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:12.990
 hello hello today I leave a video where 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:15.900
 I show you how to make roses in third 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.950
 fondant style dimension I hope them 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.880
 like 

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:24.390
 we're going to need acrylic monomers from 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.390
 colors 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.460
 a punch to decorate 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:34.400
 and the third dimension brush 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:34.400
 ah 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:40.589
 let's start by taking a pearl from a 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:40.589
 medium size 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:48.070
 We are going to put it on the nail and we will wait 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:48.070
 so that it takes consistency 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:55.070
 when I have taken consistency with the 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:57.140
 completely flat brush let's start 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.989
 to flatten the 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:02.989
 then with the largest part of the 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:05.000
 punch let's make a hole to the 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:08.570
 half of our pearl 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.120
 and with the brush we will work to 45 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:13.660
 degrees giving texture all around 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:13.660
 our flower 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:20.740
 ah 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.450
 and so we will do with the other colors 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:34.370
 It is always advisable to go doing each 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.890
 layer of this flower of all colors 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:39.940
 to wait for it to dry and 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.940
 continue working 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:47.110
 then we will take a pearl a little more 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.540
 little 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.870
 and we're going to put it right in the 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.870
 medium 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:03.680
 we wait for it to take consistency and with 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:06.350
 the brush will be flattened 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.720
 then with the other side of the punch the 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:11.270
 which is smaller we are going to make a 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:15.250
 hole in the middle and we're going to turn it 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:15.250
 to open more this pearl 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:24.570
 and we will do the same with the other flowers 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:42.760
 to finish the flower let's take a 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.680
 smaller pearl and this pearl will 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:47.590
 let's remove the excess moisture in 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:50.319
 our wipe to work it more in 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:52.920
 dry let's put it in the center of 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:52.920
 our flower 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:01.420
 and with the brush 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:05.080
 let's mark the center putting it in 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:08.310
 point and turning a little we will do what 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.310
 same with the other flowers 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:28.380
 for the leaves use the same technique 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.380
 that the basic third dimension video 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:31.580
 ah 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:43.010
 and that's how our design looks 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:46.269
 finished 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.269
 I hope you liked it
