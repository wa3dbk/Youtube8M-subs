either<00:01:06.070> a<00:01:06.220> maxed<00:01:06.670> fire<00:01:06.880> rate<00:01:07.149> or<00:01:07.360> the<00:01:07.450> lowest

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:07.659 
either a maxed fire rate or the lowest

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.090 
fire rate possible a tainted shell model

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.660 
fire rate possible a tainted shell model
so<00:01:10.899> basically<00:01:11.229> the<00:01:11.409> highest<00:01:11.770> force<00:01:12.040> dps<00:01:12.490> of

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:12.670 
so basically the highest force dps of

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:14.399 
so basically the highest force dps of
all<00:01:12.850> primary<00:01:13.149> weapons<00:01:13.570> would<00:01:13.719> in<00:01:13.869> fact<00:01:14.020> become

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:14.409 
all primary weapons would in fact become

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:15.780 
all primary weapons would in fact become

the half levitated child made me really
glad<00:02:34.450> that<00:02:34.570> I<00:02:34.690> didn't<00:02:35.050> fully<00:02:35.230> level<00:02:35.590> it

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
glad that I didn't fully level it

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.110 
glad that I didn't fully level it
because<00:02:36.070> I<00:02:36.160> could<00:02:36.280> only<00:02:36.310> imagine<00:02:36.520> what<00:02:37.060> the

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
because I could only imagine what the

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.240 
because I could only imagine what the
mine<00:02:37.270> is<00:02:37.420> 66%<00:02:38.140> would've<00:02:38.620> been<00:02:38.710> like<00:02:38.800> no<00:02:39.040> fully

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
leveling so in a nutshell this build was

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.600 
leveling so in a nutshell this build was
definitely<00:02:41.410> worse<00:02:41.590> than<00:02:41.620> the<00:02:42.040> soma<00:02:42.370> one<00:02:42.520> I

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
definitely worse than the soma one I

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.790 
definitely worse than the soma one I
didn't<00:02:42.940> last<00:02:43.150> episode<00:02:43.600> oh<00:02:43.720> is<00:02:43.900> it<00:02:44.200> was<00:02:44.380> really

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.070 
didn't last episode oh is it was really
not<00:02:44.920> fun<00:02:45.130> to<00:02:45.250> use<00:02:45.400> I<00:02:45.550> hated<00:02:46.180> every<00:02:46.660> second<00:02:47.020> of

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
not fun to use I hated every second of

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:48.330 
not fun to use I hated every second of
trying<00:02:47.260> to<00:02:47.350> use<00:02:47.500> it<00:02:47.680> and<00:02:47.860> I<00:02:48.010> guess<00:02:48.130> I<00:02:48.250> have

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
trying to use it and I guess I have
