the more guy and today I'm going to talk

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:05.680 
the more guy and today I'm going to talk
to<00:00:03.710> you<00:00:03.800> a<00:00:03.860> little<00:00:04.009> bit<00:00:04.129> about<00:00:04.490> valves<00:00:05.360> on<00:00:05.630> a

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:05.690 
to you a little bit about valves on a

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:08.320 
to you a little bit about valves on a
v-twin<00:00:06.620> a<00:00:06.890> lot<00:00:07.490> of<00:00:07.580> times<00:00:07.730> people<00:00:08.029> will<00:00:08.089> say<00:00:08.299> I

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:08.330 
v-twin a lot of times people will say I

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:10.089 
v-twin a lot of times people will say I
was<00:00:08.480> driving<00:00:08.840> along<00:00:08.990> and<00:00:09.410> my<00:00:09.590> motor<00:00:09.860> just

00:00:10.089 --> 00:00:10.099 
was driving along and my motor just

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:12.669 
was driving along and my motor just
stopped<00:00:10.460> there<00:00:10.700> la<00:00:10.940> popa<00:00:11.210> noise<00:00:11.480> and<00:00:12.380> I<00:00:12.440> turned

00:00:12.669 --> 00:00:12.679 
stopped there la popa noise and I turned

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:14.110 
stopped there la popa noise and I turned
it<00:00:12.769> over<00:00:12.830> and<00:00:12.980> I<00:00:13.070> couldn't<00:00:13.340> get<00:00:13.460> to<00:00:13.519> start<00:00:13.910> on<00:00:14.090> a

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:14.120 
it over and I couldn't get to start on a

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:15.940 
it over and I couldn't get to start on a
v-twin<00:00:14.630> now<00:00:14.780> what<00:00:14.900> I<00:00:14.929> mean<00:00:15.080> by<00:00:15.139> a<00:00:15.259> v-twin<00:00:15.650> is<00:00:15.830> it

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:15.950 
v-twin now what I mean by a v-twin is it

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:18.880 
v-twin now what I mean by a v-twin is it
has<00:00:16.099> two<00:00:16.749> cylinders<00:00:17.749> one<00:00:17.989> on<00:00:18.169> both<00:00:18.319> sides<00:00:18.650> it

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:18.890 
has two cylinders one on both sides it

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:23.319 
has two cylinders one on both sides it
makes<00:00:19.069> a<00:00:19.220> V<00:00:19.659> well<00:00:20.659> what<00:00:21.589> happens<00:00:21.949> is<00:00:22.130> one<00:00:22.999> side

00:00:23.319 --> 00:00:23.329 
makes a V well what happens is one side

00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:26.919 
makes a V well what happens is one side
of<00:00:23.720> your<00:00:24.229> your<00:00:24.919> engine<00:00:25.269> has<00:00:26.269> valves<00:00:26.630> and<00:00:26.899> the

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:26.929 
of your your engine has valves and the

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:29.919 
of your your engine has valves and the
other<00:00:27.079> side<00:00:27.319> has<00:00:27.559> valves<00:00:27.979> one<00:00:28.130> set<00:00:28.659> and<00:00:29.659> these

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:29.929 
other side has valves one set and these

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:32.350 
other side has valves one set and these
are<00:00:30.109> your<00:00:30.199> valve<00:00:30.409> covers<00:00:30.889> by<00:00:31.880> the<00:00:31.939> way<00:00:32.119> right

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:32.360 
are your valve covers by the way right

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.180 
are your valve covers by the way right
there<00:00:32.540> on<00:00:32.630> the<00:00:32.750> top<00:00:32.960> is<00:00:33.230> to<00:00:33.379> make<00:00:33.559> model<00:00:33.949> type

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:34.190 
there on the top is to make model type

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:35.709 
there on the top is to make model type
and<00:00:34.489> that's<00:00:34.579> the<00:00:34.760> information<00:00:35.000> you<00:00:35.390> need<00:00:35.570> if

00:00:35.709 --> 00:00:35.719 
and that's the information you need if

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:38.080 
and that's the information you need if
you<00:00:35.840> ever<00:00:35.960> go<00:00:36.109> to<00:00:36.140> a<00:00:36.260> lawnmower<00:00:36.500> shop<00:00:36.859> and<00:00:37.489> what

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:38.090 
you ever go to a lawnmower shop and what

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:41.169 
you ever go to a lawnmower shop and what
can<00:00:38.239> happen<00:00:38.329> is<00:00:38.660> one<00:00:38.989> of<00:00:39.260> the<00:00:39.710> push<00:00:40.010> rods<00:00:40.339> that

00:00:41.169 --> 00:00:41.179 
can happen is one of the push rods that

00:00:41.179 --> 00:00:43.209 
can happen is one of the push rods that
run<00:00:41.690> the<00:00:42.199> tappets<00:00:42.649> and<00:00:42.829> we'll<00:00:42.949> show<00:00:43.070> what

00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:43.219 
run the tappets and we'll show what

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:44.560 
run the tappets and we'll show what
those<00:00:43.370> look<00:00:43.489> like<00:00:43.550> in<00:00:43.820> a<00:00:43.879> second<00:00:44.210> can<00:00:44.329> come

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:44.570 
those look like in a second can come

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.020 
those look like in a second can come
loose<00:00:44.809> on<00:00:45.050> one<00:00:45.649> side<00:00:45.949> or<00:00:46.129> the<00:00:46.249> other<00:00:46.280> side<00:00:46.609> now

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.030 
loose on one side or the other side now

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.959 
loose on one side or the other side now
if<00:00:47.719> one<00:00:47.929> side<00:00:48.140> comes<00:00:48.620> loose<00:00:48.859> the<00:00:49.429> engine<00:00:49.760> may

00:00:49.959 --> 00:00:49.969 
if one side comes loose the engine may

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:54.130 
if one side comes loose the engine may
run<00:00:50.390> and<00:00:51.159> if<00:00:52.159> you're<00:00:52.370> not<00:00:52.489> really<00:00:52.730> sure<00:00:53.140> they

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:54.140 
run and if you're not really sure they

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:55.149 
run and if you're not really sure they
don't<00:00:54.289> know<00:00:54.379> what<00:00:54.499> you're<00:00:54.620> doing<00:00:54.920> you<00:00:55.039> may

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:55.159 
don't know what you're doing you may

00:00:55.159 --> 00:00:56.680 
don't know what you're doing you may
just<00:00:55.370> keep<00:00:55.489> running<00:00:55.699> it<00:00:55.909> on<00:00:56.030> one<00:00:56.269> cylinder

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:56.690 
just keep running it on one cylinder

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:58.660 
just keep running it on one cylinder
what's<00:00:57.499> happening<00:00:58.039> is<00:00:58.159> you're<00:00:58.280> only<00:00:58.370> getting

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670 
what's happening is you're only getting

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:00.189 
what's happening is you're only getting
about<00:00:58.699> half<00:00:58.999> the<00:00:59.179> horsepower<00:00:59.390> that<00:01:00.050> the

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:00.199 
about half the horsepower that the

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:02.229 
about half the horsepower that the
engine<00:01:00.530> supposed<00:01:00.949> to<00:01:01.129> because<00:01:01.429> only<00:01:01.550> one<00:01:01.879> side

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239 
engine supposed to because only one side

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:04.869 
engine supposed to because only one side
is<00:01:02.269> actually<00:01:02.870> producing<00:01:03.800> any<00:01:03.980> power<00:01:04.250> then

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:04.879 
is actually producing any power then

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:06.819 
is actually producing any power then
will<00:01:05.180> happen<00:01:05.570> as<00:01:05.689> the<00:01:05.720> other<00:01:06.049> side<00:01:06.350> will<00:01:06.530> pop

00:01:06.819 --> 00:01:06.829 
will happen as the other side will pop

00:01:06.829 --> 00:01:09.370 
will happen as the other side will pop
off<00:01:07.040> as<00:01:07.340> well<00:01:07.549> and<00:01:07.850> the<00:01:08.840> engine<00:01:09.110> will<00:01:09.229> die

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380 
off as well and the engine will die

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:10.660 
off as well and the engine will die
because<00:01:09.590> well<00:01:09.920> now<00:01:10.070> you<00:01:10.130> don't<00:01:10.310> have<00:01:10.460> either

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 
because well now you don't have either

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:12.789 
because well now you don't have either
side<00:01:11.000> running<00:01:11.270> I<00:01:11.390> want<00:01:11.930> to<00:01:12.020> try<00:01:12.170> to<00:01:12.229> start<00:01:12.470> this

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:12.799 
side running I want to try to start this

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:14.499 
side running I want to try to start this
engine<00:01:13.100> cuz<00:01:13.460> I<00:01:13.520> know<00:01:13.759> what<00:01:13.880> the<00:01:13.970> problem<00:01:14.149> is

00:01:14.499 --> 00:01:14.509 
engine cuz I know what the problem is

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:17.109 
engine cuz I know what the problem is
and<00:01:14.780> let<00:01:15.290> you<00:01:15.409> hear<00:01:15.649> what<00:01:15.770> the<00:01:15.890> sound<00:01:16.159> is<00:01:16.520> so

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:17.119 
and let you hear what the sound is so

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:18.280 
and let you hear what the sound is so
that<00:01:17.270> if<00:01:17.390> your<00:01:17.540> engine<00:01:17.780> sounds<00:01:17.899> like<00:01:18.110> that

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:18.290 
that if your engine sounds like that

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:19.929 
that if your engine sounds like that
there's<00:01:18.469> a<00:01:18.530> good<00:01:18.710> chance<00:01:18.950> what's<00:01:19.520> happened<00:01:19.880> as

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:19.939 
there's a good chance what's happened as

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:27.580 
there's a good chance what's happened as
a<00:01:19.969> push<00:01:20.240> rods<00:01:20.479> come<00:01:20.689> off

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.170 

now<00:01:28.590> if<00:01:28.650> you<00:01:28.740> hear<00:01:28.890> that<00:01:29.160> what<00:01:29.640> you're<00:01:29.820> hearing

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
now if you hear that what you're hearing

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.290 
now if you hear that what you're hearing
is<00:01:30.420> actually<00:01:31.410> the<00:01:31.620> air<00:01:32.370> that's<00:01:33.150> being

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:33.300 
is actually the air that's being

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.230 
is actually the air that's being
compressed<00:01:34.020> in<00:01:34.230> the<00:01:34.320> gases<00:01:34.830> in<00:01:35.730> the<00:01:35.880> cylinder

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
compressed in the gases in the cylinder

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.240 
compressed in the gases in the cylinder
but<00:01:36.690> because<00:01:37.020> one<00:01:37.290> of<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:37.470> two<00:01:37.620> push<00:01:37.830> rods<00:01:38.070> is

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
but because one of the two push rods is

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.480 
but because one of the two push rods is
off<00:01:38.400> probably<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:38.850> exhaust<00:01:39.180> push<00:01:39.480> rod<00:01:39.690> well

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
off probably the exhaust push rod well

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.360 
off probably the exhaust push rod well
the<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:42.030> air<00:01:42.180> can't<00:01:42.480> go<00:01:42.690> anywhere<00:01:43.050> and<00:01:43.370> the

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:44.370 
the the air can't go anywhere and the

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:45.920 
the the air can't go anywhere and the
the<00:01:44.730> valves<00:01:45.030> not<00:01:45.150> opening<00:01:45.480> and<00:01:45.660> so<00:01:45.780> it's

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
the valves not opening and so it's

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.470 
the valves not opening and so it's
forced<00:01:46.380> backwards<00:01:47.070> back<00:01:48.060> through<00:01:48.330> the

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:48.480 
forced backwards back through the

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:49.880 
forced backwards back through the
carburetor<00:01:48.780> if<00:01:49.200> you<00:01:49.350> notice<00:01:49.650> there's<00:01:49.830> a

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
carburetor if you notice there's a

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.010 
carburetor if you notice there's a
little<00:01:49.980> bit<00:01:50.130> of<00:01:50.310> a<00:01:50.430> pop<00:01:51.300> at<00:01:51.870> the<00:01:52.260> noise<00:01:52.500> as<00:01:53.430> you

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
little bit of a pop at the noise as you

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.360 
little bit of a pop at the noise as you
saw<00:01:55.020> a<00:01:55.050> bit<00:01:55.350> that<00:01:55.620> the<00:01:55.710> gas<00:01:55.890> is<00:01:55.920> coming

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:56.370 
saw a bit that the gas is coming

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:57.770 
saw a bit that the gas is coming
backwards<00:01:56.580> through<00:01:56.910> the<00:01:56.940> carburetor<00:01:57.360> that's

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
backwards through the carburetor that's

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.600 
backwards through the carburetor that's
a<00:01:57.990> telltale<00:01:58.410> sign<00:01:58.470> that<00:01:58.980> you<00:01:59.100> probably<00:01:59.340> have<00:01:59.580> a

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
a telltale sign that you probably have a

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.880 
a telltale sign that you probably have a
valve<00:01:59.880> that's<00:02:00.090> not<00:02:00.180> working<00:02:00.390> what<00:02:01.320> I<00:02:01.350> did<00:02:01.620> here

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
valve that's not working what I did here

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.380 
valve that's not working what I did here
was<00:02:01.920> I<00:02:02.070> took<00:02:02.370> off<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:02.550> valve<00:02:02.880> cover<00:02:03.120> just<00:02:03.270> a

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
was I took off the valve cover just a

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.290 
was I took off the valve cover just a
second<00:02:03.720> ago<00:02:04.280> this<00:02:05.280> valve<00:02:05.520> cover<00:02:05.730> sat<00:02:06.030> just

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:06.300 
second ago this valve cover sat just

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:07.430 
second ago this valve cover sat just
like<00:02:06.420> this<00:02:06.630> just<00:02:06.870> like<00:02:06.960> on<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.200> other<00:02:07.260> side

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440 
like this just like on the other side

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:13.070 
like this just like on the other side
and<00:02:08.360> I<00:02:09.360> looked<00:02:09.750> at<00:02:09.929> it<00:02:10.220> this<00:02:11.220> valve<00:02:12.090> is<00:02:12.360> very

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
and I looked at it this valve is very

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.620 
and I looked at it this valve is very
very<00:02:13.350> tight<00:02:14.180> but<00:02:15.180> all<00:02:15.270> of<00:02:15.330> a<00:02:15.360> sudden<00:02:15.570> this

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
very tight but all of a sudden this

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:16.970 
very tight but all of a sudden this
one's<00:02:15.840> very<00:02:15.900> loose<00:02:16.200> and<00:02:16.410> I<00:02:16.470> looked<00:02:16.650> in<00:02:16.800> there

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
one's very loose and I looked in there

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.670 
one's very loose and I looked in there
and<00:02:17.160> sure<00:02:18.000> enough<00:02:18.170> this<00:02:19.170> is<00:02:19.380> what<00:02:19.530> we're

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
and sure enough this is what we're

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:20.570 
and sure enough this is what we're
calling<00:02:19.800> a<00:02:20.010> push<00:02:20.190> rod

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
calling a push rod

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.530 
calling a push rod
these<00:02:21.000> are<00:02:21.150> tappets<00:02:21.770> this<00:02:22.770> is<00:02:22.980> a<00:02:23.010> push<00:02:23.280> rod<00:02:23.540> now

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
these are tappets this is a push rod now

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.180 
these are tappets this is a push rod now
unless<00:02:24.960> you're<00:02:25.110> a<00:02:25.140> mechanic<00:02:25.620> yourself<00:02:26.010> and

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
unless you're a mechanic yourself and

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.300 
unless you're a mechanic yourself and
you<00:02:26.820> have<00:02:27.030> feeler<00:02:27.420> gauges<00:02:27.660> so<00:02:28.650> that<00:02:28.830> you<00:02:28.980> can

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
you have feeler gauges so that you can

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.490 
you have feeler gauges so that you can
adjust<00:02:30.030> the<00:02:30.510> proper<00:02:30.870> spacing<00:02:31.820> between<00:02:32.820> the

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
likely if you run into this scenario

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.790 
likely if you run into this scenario
take<00:02:42.660> it<00:02:42.780> into<00:02:42.930> your<00:02:42.989> lawnmower<00:02:43.320> shop<00:02:43.500> it's

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
take it into your lawnmower shop it's

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.340 
take it into your lawnmower shop it's
it's<00:02:44.160> not<00:02:44.310> a<00:02:44.370> terribly<00:02:44.970> expensive<00:02:45.350> repair

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
it's not a terribly expensive repair

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:47.750 
it's not a terribly expensive repair
it's<00:02:46.680> going<00:02:46.890> to<00:02:46.980> take<00:02:47.100> them<00:02:47.280> a<00:02:47.310> little<00:02:47.459> bit<00:02:47.670> of

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
it's going to take them a little bit of

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.940 
it's going to take them a little bit of
time<00:02:47.940> they<00:02:48.540> can<00:02:48.690> get<00:02:48.750> you<00:02:48.900> back<00:02:49.080> on<00:02:49.290> the<00:02:49.590> the

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
time they can get you back on the the

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.260 
time they can get you back on the the
road<00:02:50.130> and<00:02:50.459> get<00:02:50.790> your<00:02:50.970> more<00:02:51.150> working<00:02:51.540> again<00:02:52.070> if

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:53.270 
road and get your more working again if

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:56.030 
road and get your more working again if
you<00:02:54.270> were<00:02:54.390> driving<00:02:54.570> along<00:02:54.810> and<00:02:55.290> it<00:02:55.830> just

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
you were driving along and it just

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.880 
you were driving along and it just
suddenly<00:02:56.280> stopped<00:02:56.820> most<00:02:57.810> likely<00:02:58.350> when<00:02:58.800> you

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
suddenly stopped most likely when you

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.060 
suddenly stopped most likely when you
take<00:02:59.100> the<00:03:00.200> top<00:03:01.200> off<00:03:01.380> on<00:03:01.590> the<00:03:01.709> other<00:03:01.830> side

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
take the top off on the other side

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:03.500 
take the top off on the other side
you're<00:03:02.250> going<00:03:02.280> to<00:03:02.400> find<00:03:02.489> it's<00:03:02.790> the<00:03:02.820> same<00:03:03.150> thing

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989
