so that it admits now I want to make a

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.790 
so that it admits now I want to make a
loop<00:00:45.270> that<00:00:46.260> is<00:00:46.789> 10<00:00:47.789> seconds<00:00:48.270> long<00:00:48.539> so<00:00:49.500> if<00:00:49.649> it's

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
loop that is 10 seconds long so if it's

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.250 
loop that is 10 seconds long so if it's
10<00:00:50.010> seconds<00:00:50.399> long<00:00:50.640> I<00:00:50.789> like<00:00:50.969> to<00:00:51.180> make<00:00:52.110> my

composition double the length of the
loop<00:00:57.350> I'm<00:00:58.350> going<00:00:58.379> to<00:00:58.559> stretch<00:00:58.890> this<00:00:59.129> out<00:01:00.469> I'm

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
loop I'm going to stretch this out I'm

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.520 
loop I'm going to stretch this out I'm
going<00:01:01.649> to<00:01:01.680> go<00:01:01.829> into<00:01:02.219> particular<00:01:03.320> I'm<00:01:04.320> going<00:01:04.470> to

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
going to go into particular I'm going to

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.969 
going to go into particular I'm going to
make<00:01:04.650> a<00:01:04.680> hold<00:01:05.070> frame<00:01:06.229> for<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.320> particles<00:01:07.799> per

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
make a hold frame for the particles per

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:14.060 
make a hold frame for the particles per
second<00:01:09.170> and<00:01:10.170> whatever<00:01:11.780> speed<00:01:12.780> I<00:01:12.810> like<00:01:13.560> so<00:01:13.979> I'm

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
second and whatever speed I like so I'm

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.100 
second and whatever speed I like so I'm
just<00:01:14.250> going<00:01:14.369> to<00:01:14.430> leave<00:01:14.580> it<00:01:14.670> at<00:01:14.760> 100<00:01:15.180> and<00:01:15.330> then

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
just going to leave it at 100 and then

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.969 
just going to leave it at 100 and then
at<00:01:16.229> 10<00:01:16.500> seconds<00:01:17.390> I'm<00:01:18.530> going<00:01:19.530> to<00:01:19.650> make<00:01:19.770> another

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
at 10 seconds I'm going to make another

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.510 
at 10 seconds I'm going to make another
hold<00:01:20.250> frame<00:01:20.580> at<00:01:20.939> zero<00:01:21.920> particles<00:01:22.920> per<00:01:23.100> second

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
hold frame at zero particles per second

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.219 
hold frame at zero particles per second
so<00:01:23.790> it<00:01:23.939> you<00:01:24.150> know<00:01:24.210> it<00:01:24.330> starts<00:01:24.689> out<00:01:24.900> and<00:01:25.140> then

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
so it you know it starts out and then

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.960 
so it you know it starts out and then
once<00:01:25.500> it<00:01:25.619> it's<00:01:25.799> 10<00:01:25.979> seconds<00:01:26.369> it<00:01:26.520> just<00:01:26.700> stops

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
once it it's 10 seconds it just stops

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:34.130 
once it it's 10 seconds it just stops
admitting<00:01:27.530> any<00:01:28.530> particles<00:01:29.450> okay<00:01:30.450> perfect<00:01:33.140> go

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
admitting any particles okay perfect go

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.210 
admitting any particles okay perfect go
into<00:01:34.290> this<00:01:34.350> project

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
into this project

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.969 
into this project
I'm<00:01:35.960> let's<00:01:36.960> say<00:01:37.170> this<00:01:37.350> is<00:01:37.409> my<00:01:37.970> emitter<00:01:39.590> and<00:01:40.590> I

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
I'm let's say this is my emitter and I

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.980 
I'm let's say this is my emitter and I
want<00:01:41.159> to<00:01:41.220> nest<00:01:41.430> this<00:01:41.790> in<00:01:42.180> another<00:01:42.570> composition

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
want to nest this in another composition

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.010 
want to nest this in another composition
so<00:01:43.530> I'm<00:01:43.590> just<00:01:43.740> going<00:01:43.920> to<00:01:43.950> drag<00:01:44.579> it<00:01:44.729> in<00:01:44.880> this<00:01:45.840> is

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
so I'm just going to drag it in this is

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.210 
so I'm just going to drag it in this is
going<00:01:46.200> to<00:01:46.290> be<00:01:46.439> my<00:01:46.649> emitter<00:01:47.630> loop<00:01:48.630> and<00:01:49.350> I'm

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
going to be my emitter loop and I'm

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.300 
going to be my emitter loop and I'm
going<00:01:50.250> to<00:01:50.399> open<00:01:50.579> up<00:01:50.700> that<00:01:50.850> composition<00:01:52.310> now

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
going to open up that composition now

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.370 
going to open up that composition now
this<00:01:53.520> composition<00:01:53.850> is<00:01:54.119> 20<00:01:54.509> seconds<00:01:54.930> long<00:01:55.079> and

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
this composition is 20 seconds long and

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.020 
this composition is 20 seconds long and
my<00:01:55.470> motion<00:01:55.799> is<00:01:55.829> going<00:01:56.009> to<00:01:56.070> be<00:01:56.130> 10<00:01:56.369> seconds<00:01:56.850> long

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
my motion is going to be 10 seconds long

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.240 
my motion is going to be 10 seconds long
so<00:01:57.200> composition<00:01:58.200> settings<00:01:58.969> 10<00:01:59.969> seconds<00:02:00.780> and<00:02:01.250> I

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
so composition settings 10 seconds and I

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.090 
so composition settings 10 seconds and I
go<00:02:02.399> right<00:02:02.759> to<00:02:02.820> my<00:02:03.380> last<00:02:04.380> frame<00:02:04.799> of<00:02:04.829> my

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
go right to my last frame of my

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.449 
go right to my last frame of my
composition<00:02:05.790> and<00:02:06.000> go<00:02:06.600> page<00:02:06.990> down<00:02:07.500> so<00:02:08.039> go<00:02:08.220> one

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
composition and go page down so go one

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.559 
composition and go page down so go one
more<00:02:08.670> frame<00:02:09.349> so<00:02:10.349> I'm<00:02:10.590> past<00:02:11.370> the<00:02:11.700> the<00:02:12.330> end<00:02:12.450> of

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
more frame so I'm past the the end of

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.670 
more frame so I'm past the the end of
the<00:02:12.629> composition

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
the composition

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.750 
the composition
edit<00:02:14.599> split<00:02:15.599> layer<00:02:15.959> and<00:02:16.260> then<00:02:17.069> go<00:02:17.280> to<00:02:17.340> the

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
edit split layer and then go to the

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.940 
edit split layer and then go to the
start<00:02:18.150> of<00:02:18.269> my<00:02:18.360> composition<00:02:19.049> and<00:02:21.620> slide<00:02:22.650> I

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
start of my composition and slide I

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.170 
start of my composition and slide I
really<00:02:23.610> just<00:02:23.730> slid<00:02:24.569> this<00:02:25.640> this<00:02:26.640> layer<00:02:26.909> all<00:02:27.150> the

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
really just slid this this layer all the

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.970 
really just slid this this layer all the
way<00:02:27.299> to<00:02:27.420> the<00:02:27.599> beginning<00:02:27.690> so<00:02:28.379> now<00:02:28.739> what's

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
way to the beginning so now what's

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.619 
way to the beginning so now what's
happening<00:02:29.370> is<00:02:31.280> my<00:02:32.280> bottom<00:02:32.670> layer<00:02:32.849> the<00:02:32.909> start

00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:33.629 
happening is my bottom layer the start

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:39.199 
happening is my bottom layer the start
is<00:02:33.930> is<00:02:34.920> starting<00:02:36.650> it<00:02:37.650> keeps<00:02:37.920> going<00:02:38.190> and<00:02:38.489> then<00:02:39.180> I

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
is is starting it keeps going and then I

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:44.420 
is is starting it keeps going and then I
split<00:02:39.599> that<00:02:40.280> so<00:02:41.280> that<00:02:41.549> it<00:02:43.159> well<00:02:44.159> that's

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
split that so that it well that's

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.400 
split that so that it well that's
basically<00:02:44.610> my<00:02:45.000> seamless<00:02:45.450> loop<00:02:45.660> right<00:02:45.930> there

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.559 

I'll<00:02:49.410> turn<00:02:49.650> this<00:02:49.859> bottom<00:02:50.220> layer<00:02:50.370> off<00:02:50.609> so

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:51.569 
I'll turn this bottom layer off so

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:53.449 
I'll turn this bottom layer off so
basically<00:02:51.750> right<00:02:52.170> at<00:02:52.349> ten<00:02:52.650> seconds

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
basically right at ten seconds

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:57.580 
basically right at ten seconds
it<00:02:53.910> stops<00:02:54.450> admitting<00:02:55.140> any<00:02:55.730> particles<00:02:56.730> as<00:02:57.030> the

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
it stops admitting any particles as the

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:02.349 
it stops admitting any particles as the
bottom<00:02:58.590> layer<00:02:58.790> begins<00:02:59.790> to<00:03:00.120> admit<00:03:00.359> particles

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:02.359 
bottom layer begins to admit particles

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:07.550 
bottom layer begins to admit particles
okay<00:03:03.560> and<00:03:05.359> then<00:03:06.359> what<00:03:06.870> I<00:03:06.900> like<00:03:06.959> to<00:03:07.200> do<00:03:07.349> with

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
okay and then what I like to do with

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.530 
okay and then what I like to do with
that<00:03:07.709> emitter<00:03:08.010> loop<00:03:08.280> I<00:03:08.519> like<00:03:08.730> to<00:03:08.970> nest<00:03:09.269> that

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
that emitter loop I like to nest that

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.539 
that emitter loop I like to nest that
one<00:03:09.750> in<00:03:09.989> another<00:03:10.549> composition<00:03:12.200> and<00:03:13.200> let's<00:03:14.129> you

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:14.549 
one in another composition and let's you

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:17.839 
one in another composition and let's you
know<00:03:14.609> call<00:03:14.940> this<00:03:15.090> final<00:03:16.700> open<00:03:17.700> that

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:17.849 
know call this final open that

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:20.890 
know call this final open that
composition<00:03:18.299> and<00:03:18.870> now<00:03:19.049> I<00:03:19.079> have<00:03:19.349> one<00:03:19.380> layer

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
composition and now I have one layer

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.430 
composition and now I have one layer
that<00:03:21.900> I<00:03:21.930> can<00:03:22.349> add<00:03:22.739> effects<00:03:23.130> to<00:03:24.049> do<00:03:25.049> whatever<00:03:25.230> I

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
that I can add effects to do whatever I

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:31.220 
that I can add effects to do whatever I
want<00:03:25.799> with<00:03:25.980> and<00:03:28.519> not<00:03:29.519> feel<00:03:29.760> restricted<00:03:30.239> by

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
want with and not feel restricted by

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.360 
want with and not feel restricted by
having<00:03:31.620> to<00:03:31.739> manage<00:03:32.660> you<00:03:33.660> know<00:03:33.780> two<00:03:34.440> layers<00:03:34.739> all

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
having to manage you know two layers all

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.979 
having to manage you know two layers all
the<00:03:36.239> time<00:03:36.889> so<00:03:37.889> let<00:03:38.819> me<00:03:38.940> go<00:03:39.060> back<00:03:39.269> into<00:03:39.480> my<00:03:39.569> admit

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
the time so let me go back into my admit

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:42.140 
the time so let me go back into my admit
ur<00:03:40.019> composition<00:03:41.010> and<00:03:41.280> the<00:03:41.459> beauty<00:03:41.819> of<00:03:41.849> this

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
ur composition and the beauty of this

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:46.400 
ur composition and the beauty of this
technique<00:03:43.579> is<00:03:44.579> that<00:03:44.639> it<00:03:45.000> all<00:03:45.480> works<00:03:45.750> on<00:03:46.019> one

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
technique is that it all works on one

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:51.680 
technique is that it all works on one
layer<00:03:46.709> with<00:03:47.720> one<00:03:48.720> particular<00:03:49.230> effect<00:03:50.690> you

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
layer with one particular effect you

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.259 
layer with one particular effect you
know<00:03:51.810> attached<00:03:52.379> to<00:03:52.739> it<00:03:52.889> I've<00:03:53.549> seen<00:03:53.879> this<00:03:54.030> done

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269 
know attached to it I've seen this done

00:03:54.269 --> 00:04:00.020 
know attached to it I've seen this done
before<00:03:54.329> where<00:03:56.359> users<00:03:57.359> will<00:03:58.699> you<00:03:59.699> know<00:03:59.790> put

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
before where users will you know put

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.439 
before where users will you know put
particular<00:04:00.540> on<00:04:00.690> a<00:04:00.720> layer<00:04:01.079> and<00:04:01.410> then<00:04:01.650> split<00:04:02.449> you

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:03.449 
particular on a layer and then split you

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:06.170 
particular on a layer and then split you
know<00:04:03.569> they'll<00:04:03.810> split<00:04:04.079> that<00:04:04.260> layer<00:04:04.849> right<00:04:05.849> and

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
know they'll split that layer right and

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.449 
know they'll split that layer right and
then<00:04:06.989> kind<00:04:07.199> of<00:04:07.260> move<00:04:07.470> that<00:04:07.739> layer<00:04:07.980> over<00:04:08.430> here

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 
then kind of move that layer over here

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:12.710 
then kind of move that layer over here
and<00:04:09.449> it<00:04:10.379> it<00:04:10.620> does<00:04:10.919> the<00:04:11.129> same<00:04:11.430> it<00:04:12.150> does<00:04:12.359> the<00:04:12.480> same

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
and it it does the same it does the same

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.869 
and it it does the same it does the same
thing<00:04:12.900> that<00:04:12.930> I<00:04:13.079> did<00:04:13.280> the<00:04:14.280> problem<00:04:14.579> with<00:04:14.699> this

00:04:14.869 --> 00:04:14.879 
thing that I did the problem with this

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:17.509 
thing that I did the problem with this
is<00:04:15.150> that<00:04:15.180> let's<00:04:15.930> say<00:04:16.139> oh<00:04:16.169> you<00:04:17.070> know<00:04:17.160> I<00:04:17.190> want<00:04:17.489> my

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 
is that let's say oh you know I want my

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:20.210 
is that let's say oh you know I want my
particles<00:04:18.180> to<00:04:18.449> be<00:04:18.479> a<00:04:18.959> different<00:04:19.680> color<00:04:19.859> I<00:04:19.979> want

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 
particles to be a different color I want

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:23.719 
particles to be a different color I want
them<00:04:20.370> to<00:04:20.489> be<00:04:20.729> red<00:04:21.919> well<00:04:22.919> you<00:04:23.460> have<00:04:23.580> to<00:04:23.700> change

00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:23.729 
them to be red well you have to change

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:25.490 
them to be red well you have to change
it<00:04:24.060> on<00:04:24.180> that<00:04:24.360> layer<00:04:24.599> and<00:04:24.870> then<00:04:25.080> you<00:04:25.260> have<00:04:25.380> to

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
it on that layer and then you have to

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.170 
it on that layer and then you have to
change<00:04:25.740> it<00:04:25.919> on

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
change it on

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.570 
change it on
your<00:04:27.840> your<00:04:28.259> other<00:04:28.440> layer<00:04:28.740> that<00:04:29.430> has

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
your your other layer that has

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.499 
your your other layer that has
particular<00:04:29.820> on<00:04:30.270> it<00:04:31.610> and<00:04:32.610> this<00:04:32.729> might<00:04:33.090> seem

00:04:33.499 --> 00:04:33.509 
particular on it and this might seem

00:04:33.509 --> 00:04:37.040 
particular on it and this might seem
like<00:04:33.570> oh<00:04:34.020> not<00:04:34.289> a<00:04:34.320> big<00:04:34.590> deal<00:04:35.389> but<00:04:36.389> with<00:04:36.600> the

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.050 
like oh not a big deal but with the

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:41.420 
like oh not a big deal but with the
compositions<00:04:37.680> we<00:04:37.949> make<00:04:39.350> you<00:04:40.350> know<00:04:40.470> we<00:04:41.039> can

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:41.430 
compositions we make you know we can

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:44.240 
compositions we make you know we can
easily<00:04:42.120> change<00:04:42.509> I<00:04:42.990> don't<00:04:43.979> know

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.250 
easily change I don't know

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:49.820 
easily change I don't know
25<00:04:47.120> maybe<00:04:48.120> maybe<00:04:48.720> more<00:04:49.050> settings<00:04:49.590> in

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:49.830 
25 maybe maybe more settings in

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:52.189 
25 maybe maybe more settings in
particular<00:04:50.430> and<00:04:50.669> where<00:04:51.419> we<00:04:51.690> want<00:04:51.900> to<00:04:51.930> tweak

00:04:52.189 --> 00:04:52.199 
particular and where we want to tweak

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:54.320 
particular and where we want to tweak
those<00:04:52.440> on<00:04:52.770> the<00:04:52.889> fly<00:04:53.130> to<00:04:53.190> to<00:04:53.789> create<00:04:54.090> the<00:04:54.180> look

those on the fly to to create the look

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:55.700 
those on the fly to to create the look
we<00:04:54.479> want<00:04:54.660> and<00:04:54.900> you<00:04:54.960> don't<00:04:55.410> want<00:04:55.560> to<00:04:55.620> be

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:55.710 
we want and you don't want to be

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:59.749 
we want and you don't want to be
managing<00:04:56.300> you<00:04:57.300> know<00:04:57.330> two<00:04:57.780> separate<00:04:58.759> layers

00:04:59.749 --> 00:04:59.759 
managing you know two separate layers

00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:03.800 
managing you know two separate layers

on<00:05:16.440> this<00:05:17.160> layer<00:05:17.490> and<00:05:17.910> then<00:05:18.840> I<00:05:19.289> go<00:05:20.160> back<00:05:20.190> to<00:05:20.460> I

00:05:22.089 --> 00:05:22.099 
on this layer and then I go back to I

00:05:22.099 --> 00:05:25.939 
on this layer and then I go back to I
think<00:05:23.099> this<00:05:23.250> was<00:05:23.430> my<00:05:23.550> final<00:05:23.820> one<00:05:24.210> and<00:05:24.919> have<00:05:25.919> a

00:05:25.939 --> 00:05:25.949 
think this was my final one and have a

00:05:25.949 --> 00:05:27.499 
think this was my final one and have a
seamless<00:05:26.340> loop<00:05:26.729> here<00:05:26.970> that<00:05:27.000> here's<00:05:27.389> the

00:05:27.499 --> 00:05:27.509 
seamless loop here that here's the

00:05:27.509 --> 00:05:28.670 
seamless loop here that here's the
beginning<00:05:27.630> of<00:05:27.900> the<00:05:27.960> frame<00:05:28.110> here's<00:05:28.410> the<00:05:28.530> end<00:05:28.620> of

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:28.680 
beginning of the frame here's the end of

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.129 
beginning of the frame here's the end of
the<00:05:28.740> frame<00:05:28.919> in<00:05:29.070> this<00:05:29.160> will<00:05:29.370> this<00:05:30.180> will<00:05:30.240> loop

00:05:31.129 --> 00:05:31.139 
the frame in this will this will loop

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:35.540 
the frame in this will this will loop
seamlessly<00:05:33.020> right<00:05:34.020> now<00:05:34.979> one<00:05:35.220> thing<00:05:35.370> to<00:05:35.430> note

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:35.550 
seamlessly right now one thing to note

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:40.460 
seamlessly right now one thing to note
with<00:05:36.270> this<00:05:36.449> technique<00:05:37.050> is<00:05:37.520> that<00:05:38.520> you<00:05:39.470> can't

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:40.470 
with this technique is that you can't

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:45.589 
with this technique is that you can't
have<00:05:41.030> the<00:05:42.030> life<00:05:42.389> of<00:05:42.720> your<00:05:42.990> particles<00:05:44.599> longer

00:05:45.589 --> 00:05:45.599 
have the life of your particles longer

00:05:45.599 --> 00:05:51.920 
have the life of your particles longer
than<00:05:48.020> really<00:05:49.020> twice<00:05:50.360> than<00:05:51.360> the<00:05:51.510> length<00:05:51.720> of

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:51.930 
than really twice than the length of

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:55.580 
than really twice than the length of
your<00:05:52.050> of<00:05:52.349> your<00:05:52.409> motion<00:05:52.949> right<00:05:53.400> so<00:05:54.030> here's<00:05:54.900> you

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:55.590 
your of your motion right so here's you

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:59.029 
your of your motion right so here's you
know<00:05:55.620> my<00:05:55.889> marker<00:05:56.310> at<00:05:56.490> 20<00:05:56.849> seconds<00:05:57.330> I<00:05:58.039> can't

00:05:59.029 --> 00:05:59.039 
know my marker at 20 seconds I can't

00:05:59.039 --> 00:06:04.510 
know my marker at 20 seconds I can't
make<00:05:59.340> the<00:05:59.610> life<00:06:00.229> longer<00:06:01.229> than<00:06:01.380> 10<00:06:01.830> seconds<00:06:02.400> or

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:04.520 
make the life longer than 10 seconds or

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:07.339 
make the life longer than 10 seconds or
by<00:06:05.520> the<00:06:05.580> by<00:06:05.909> the<00:06:05.970> time<00:06:06.240> our<00:06:06.270> my<00:06:06.780> composition

00:06:07.339 --> 00:06:07.349 
by the by the time our my composition

00:06:07.349 --> 00:06:09.620 
by the by the time our my composition
reached<00:06:07.530> 20<00:06:07.830> seconds<00:06:08.360> there's<00:06:09.360> still

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:09.630 
reached 20 seconds there's still

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:10.790 
reached 20 seconds there's still
particles<00:06:10.050> left<00:06:10.199> and<00:06:10.349> you<00:06:10.409> don't<00:06:10.560> want<00:06:10.740> that

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:10.800 
particles left and you don't want that

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.860 
particles left and you don't want that
because<00:06:11.159> it<00:06:11.340> won't<00:06:11.820> loop<00:06:12.150> seamlessly<00:06:12.720> if<00:06:12.780> you

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:12.870 
because it won't loop seamlessly if you

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:18.649 
because it won't loop seamlessly if you
have<00:06:13.080> that<00:06:13.259> so<00:06:13.759> make<00:06:14.759> sure<00:06:15.090> that<00:06:15.449> that<00:06:15.720> is<00:06:17.659> you

00:06:18.649 --> 00:06:18.659 
have that so make sure that that is you

00:06:18.659 --> 00:06:24.379 
have that so make sure that that is you
know<00:06:19.610> equal<00:06:20.610> to<00:06:20.669> or<00:06:21.120> less<00:06:21.539> than<00:06:22.970> the<00:06:23.970> length<00:06:24.180> of

00:06:24.379 --> 00:06:24.389 
know equal to or less than the length of

00:06:24.389 --> 00:06:26.749 
know equal to or less than the length of
your<00:06:24.570> of<00:06:24.870> your<00:06:25.169> motion<00:06:25.349> loop<00:06:25.680> and<00:06:25.919> the<00:06:26.639> other

00:06:26.749 --> 00:06:26.759 
your of your motion loop and the other

00:06:26.759 --> 00:06:31.219 
your of your motion loop and the other
thing<00:06:27.090> to<00:06:27.449> watch<00:06:27.870> out<00:06:28.530> for<00:06:28.860> is<00:06:30.020> there's<00:06:31.020> your

00:06:31.219 --> 00:06:31.229 
thing to watch out for is there's your

00:06:31.229 --> 00:06:32.930 
thing to watch out for is there's your
life<00:06:31.470> but<00:06:31.770> then<00:06:31.889> there's<00:06:32.039> also<00:06:32.190> your<00:06:32.430> random

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:32.940 
life but then there's also your random

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:35.390 
life but then there's also your random
life<00:06:33.150> okay<00:06:33.840> so<00:06:33.900> you're<00:06:34.530> saying<00:06:34.770> oh<00:06:35.039> you<00:06:35.099> know

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:35.400 
life okay so you're saying oh you know

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:39.649 
life okay so you're saying oh you know
my<00:06:35.610> my<00:06:36.300> life<00:06:36.510> is<00:06:36.990> at<00:06:37.770> ten<00:06:38.010> seconds<00:06:38.639> but<00:06:39.450> if<00:06:39.570> you

00:06:39.649 --> 00:06:39.659 
my my life is at ten seconds but if you

00:06:39.659 --> 00:06:40.610 
my my life is at ten seconds but if you
have<00:06:39.779> a<00:06:40.020> lamp

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:40.620 
have a lamp

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:43.460 
have a lamp
life<00:06:40.979> random<00:06:41.460> up<00:06:41.639> some<00:06:42.630> of<00:06:42.750> your<00:06:42.810> particles

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:43.470 
life random up some of your particles

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:47.120 
life random up some of your particles
will<00:06:44.190> be<00:06:44.220> over<00:06:45.110> that<00:06:46.110> ten<00:06:46.380> seconds<00:06:46.800> so<00:06:47.070> you

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:47.130 
will be over that ten seconds so you

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:48.950 
will be over that ten seconds so you
know<00:06:47.550> you<00:06:48.000> got<00:06:48.150> to<00:06:48.270> keep<00:06:48.360> that<00:06:48.540> in<00:06:48.660> mind<00:06:48.810> so

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:48.960 
know you got to keep that in mind so

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:51.200 
know you got to keep that in mind so
what<00:06:49.110> I<00:06:49.139> do<00:06:49.290> I<00:06:49.590> just<00:06:50.130> go<00:06:50.280> the<00:06:50.400> last<00:06:50.580> frame<00:06:50.940> and

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:51.210 
what I do I just go the last frame and

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:54.080 
what I do I just go the last frame and
let's<00:06:52.199> say<00:06:52.350> I<00:06:52.380> have<00:06:52.590> life<00:06:53.010> random<00:06:53.460> up<00:06:53.580> you<00:06:54.000> know

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:54.090 
let's say I have life random up you know

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:57.200 
let's say I have life random up you know
to<00:06:54.180> a<00:06:54.330> hundred<00:06:54.600> percent<00:06:54.690> I<00:06:55.169> just<00:06:55.880> move<00:06:56.880> this

00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:57.210 
to a hundred percent I just move this

00:06:57.210 --> 00:07:00.110 
to a hundred percent I just move this
slider<00:06:57.570> down<00:06:57.810> my<00:06:57.990> life<00:06:58.250> slider<00:06:59.250> down<00:06:59.550> until

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:00.120 
slider down my life slider down until

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:02.840 
slider down my life slider down until
really<00:07:00.810> all<00:07:01.020> of<00:07:01.139> my<00:07:01.260> art<00:07:01.770> all<00:07:02.100> of<00:07:02.280> my<00:07:02.370> particles

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:02.850 
really all of my art all of my particles

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:07.850 
really all of my art all of my particles
are<00:07:03.030> gone<00:07:03.870> and<00:07:04.490> that<00:07:05.490> seems<00:07:05.760> to<00:07:05.970> work<00:07:06.680> most<00:07:07.680> of

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:07.860 
are gone and that seems to work most of

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:12.260 
are gone and that seems to work most of
the<00:07:08.010> time<00:07:10.100> yeah<00:07:11.100> that<00:07:11.310> that's<00:07:11.610> basically<00:07:12.060> my

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:12.270 
the time yeah that that's basically my

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:14.060 
the time yeah that that's basically my
tutorial<00:07:12.870> I<00:07:13.020> just<00:07:13.199> want<00:07:13.410> to<00:07:13.530> do<00:07:13.620> but<00:07:13.860> you<00:07:13.979> know

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:14.070 
tutorial I just want to do but you know

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:16.370 
tutorial I just want to do but you know
something<00:07:14.400> very<00:07:14.610> simple<00:07:14.880> to<00:07:15.120> show<00:07:15.360> how<00:07:16.320> we

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:16.380 
something very simple to show how we

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:21.350 
something very simple to show how we
like<00:07:16.830> to<00:07:16.860> loop<00:07:18.949> particular<00:07:20.030> hopefully<00:07:21.030> find

00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:21.360 
like to loop particular hopefully find

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:24.710 
like to loop particular hopefully find
this<00:07:21.479> helpful<00:07:21.840> and<00:07:22.229> hopefully<00:07:23.300> you're<00:07:24.300> able

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:24.720 
this helpful and hopefully you're able

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:30.740 
this helpful and hopefully you're able
to<00:07:24.750> make<00:07:25.050> better<00:07:26.039> motion<00:07:26.430> loops<00:07:26.820> that<00:07:29.750> you

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:30.750 
to make better motion loops that you

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:33.170 
to make better motion loops that you
know<00:07:30.870> just<00:07:31.199> loop<00:07:31.380> a<00:07:31.500> lot<00:07:31.650> better<00:07:31.860> and<00:07:32.130> are<00:07:32.910> easy

00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:33.180 
know just loop a lot better and are easy

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:33.860 
know just loop a lot better and are easy
to<00:07:33.360> work<00:07:33.479> with

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:33.870 
to work with

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:36.080 
to work with
