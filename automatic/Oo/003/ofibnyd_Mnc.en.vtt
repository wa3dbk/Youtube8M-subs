00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:11.120
 yes hello together with groupwide in it 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.370
 unboxing video here on the channel that 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:15.350
 whole as always together with games 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:18.230
 Iceland and yes we have here is the 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:21.920
 Poster display of the new main tent magic 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:24.050
 2014 as always 36 booster the here 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.880
 I'll get along with you and 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.410
 if I have some ideas for that 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.640
 Of course, as always, I'll tell you 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:30.550
 participate 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.880
 yes, how the whole thing in this edition 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:35.090
 raise 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:37.340
 at the last display on boxes it has 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:40.539
 So, as it sounds 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:44.480
 very well proven 1 606 brewster unboxing 

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:46.129
 a6 many videos are not 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.680
 too short are not too long 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:51.050
 and yes I hope you still are 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.550
 same opinion as I will this time 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.590
 I can do so too nice 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.090
 split up to 36 and I have mine 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:59.899
 just the first six teams there 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:02.719
 get caught out and also directly with the 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:05.660
 start first booster on the spot 

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:07.850
 here no time lose the farthest 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:10.130
 I will always get out of both cards 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.390
 I think the people take it 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.860
 the longer they will play 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.110
 Most cards know where to put home 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.939
 yes characterized by them many 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.470
 reprints have it cards that it 

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:22.640
 ever have been just once again 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:24.259
 printed and head of reasons beautiful 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.780
 map creature of the opponent take up 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:28.729
 At the end of the day, it's also fun for me 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.200
 I make five tones of creature then three 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:30.890
 black man in pully train continues 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.659
 can use 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.220
 so i will not be too much at all 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:38.360
 Of course cards received as always on 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:42.079
 the rays and yes here it starts with the 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:44.149
 elite aka nest for 4 x 11 human 

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:46.009
 wizard when he enters the field 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:47.299
 you can get an instant card from the 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:49.219
 hand into exile 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:52.460
 and if you pay nothing and are intact 

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:56.390
 You can send them exiled 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:58.340
 in front but copy and take a look 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.380
 you make a state of the subway 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:03.289
 malakhovs is converted markus to 611 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:05.689
 cards rather because she does not take 

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:07.280
 A lightning bolt sent him in 

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:09.289
 Exile costs a red banner and then 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.740
 can you then unite him then 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:14.810
 play again and again 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:16.190
 the cards let retirees the camera 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.379
 recommends autofocus 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.180
 i wanted the cards a bit 

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:22.969
 sort because I yes 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:25.730
 concerning our club with us 

00:02:22.969 --> 00:02:28.760
 always thought so on the stream with it 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:32.269
 later sort the whole thing easier 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:34.370
 So we come to booster number two the 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:36.409
 Both lower cards are allowed to return to 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.000
 page tries again in one 

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:40.189
 reasonable speed, too 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.019
 go through the cards if then there 

00:02:40.189 --> 00:02:43.849
 someone still want to press stop must 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:47.180
 the power to take a closer look if 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:49.430
 As always you can have any questions 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.599
 you get the video writing s.besten 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.090
 of course the question in our forum 

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:54.530
 on my base de answered that yet 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.900
 a lot more people and all have too 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:59.689
 So you do not always have to know 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:01.489
 just ask me on board five times one 

00:02:59.689 --> 00:03:03.709
 enchantment whenever you next to the 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:08.419
 an opponent loses just as much 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:10.370
 yes yes you have to be there I'm too good 

00:03:08.419 --> 00:03:12.950
 to start the display is not allowed immediately 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:16.060
 all luck color powder is mine 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:19.129
 experience in any case of the fold 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:21.590
 but if we still have some booster here 

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:23.000
 in front of us and I think there will still be 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.620
 of course I had some in 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.430
 the blogs then again on the 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.470
 talking about everything 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.579
 The Tories Labor I find super cool 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.379
 So I would have somehow anyway 

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:31.760
 what with respawn there's then determined 

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:33.739
 also in building without budget I would 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.629
 say claustrophobia from today ruble 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:39.560
 not so good in the limited 

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:41.510
 arrested firesheep gives double hitting 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:45.229
 paul auster dingsbums here it says the 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:47.150
 wood stove aipac then the pseudo that 

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:49.639
 wasteland and there we have one more 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:53.479
 Renner as well as in bronze silver for 

00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:56.359
 a total of four times he is 22 and aloys 

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:56.629
 have a double beat that's a good one 

00:03:56.359 --> 00:03:58.239
 thing 

00:03:56.629 --> 00:04:00.290
 of like really good to me 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:01.909
 Double beat is a really right 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:04.549
 really good ability on the 

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:06.680
 may have fortified tower I think that's great 

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:08.569
 I play with it now 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.220
 or has against it game there you can 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:12.889
 take a lot of damage 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:14.540
 or then just handing out ever 

00:04:12.889 --> 00:04:16.430
 after on which side the double 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:18.650
 So it's really a hit 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:21.440
 strong ability and is always so we 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:23.449
 are great represented here so a tip 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:25.520
 before I did some video if 

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:27.650
 yes , everything builds up to green 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.000
 putting is always a very good trick 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:31.520
 because then you can get a cheap painter 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.470
 baseball just take remsfeld plays 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.430
 So spells where you are 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:36.620
 can pick out it's 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:38.780
 easier to build the multicolored text 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:40.220
 Here I go for a short time on the corrupt 1 for 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:42.200
 Six men shoot that so much 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:43.340
 hurt as he says very well for the mono 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:45.740
 black covers I might be 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:47.390
 one more time to build what and another 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:51.740
 bremer suri then we have one more 

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:55.490
 sensation the hg prevention apology 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:58.490
 in the folk and the mdr is for 63 3 and 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:01.610
 all singers as well as screen +23 +3 as he 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:03.230
 Actually , a 66 itself is up 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:05.060
 at first glance, maybe very well 

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:06.770
 but that is too expensive 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:08.870
 you always want to be like this 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:11.800
 play a bit faster there you have to 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:15.920
 Be careful how to build properly 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:18.050
 So just because he gives a lot to it is called 

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:18.850
 not that he has a good card 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:21.440
 it always has to be a bit like that 

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:23.480
 Be careful label of the beast 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:26.500
 that 's how it goes on Steve also 

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:29.150
 nice card on with my gate again 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:32.390
 Depeschen gives there enchanted credo - 3 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:34.040
 - 0 is really okay france 

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:35.480
 press I think super card two 

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:38.870
 creatures pat them disappointing round 

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:40.820
 long not really good card white 

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:43.190
 case world will also help a bit 

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:44.870
 then the budget budget tutor 

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:46.850
 You can get black computer yourself 

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:51.910
 somehow k 1006 take a hand 

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:54.760
 brembeck roche com gate and there would be 

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:56.960
 vacation for four men an aura 

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:59.360
 enchants a mountain and the mountains 

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:05.720
 is then a 77 red translucent creature with 

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:07.820
 hurry it is okay so it is not now 

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:09.650
 but it is not negative either 

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:11.780
 best card but you get it 

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:13.280
 for companies a 77 vanilla creature if 

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:15.260
 you do not need much rest anyway 

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:15.800
 on the rule then mountain to it 

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.780
 burn 

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:19.790
 is ok you can only do that 

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:21.500
 play mono red deck because triple 

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:23.960
 red in the cost is already a 

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:26.060
 In any case, you have to spend a bit of money 

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:29.210
 take care with such a map plus super 

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:31.550

 Men's teams show the hand you can 

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:38.630
 not driving probably not map 

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:41.780
