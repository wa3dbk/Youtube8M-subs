00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
stopped getting attention from me so

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:15.630 
stopped getting attention from me so
he's<00:03:14.560> moved<00:03:14.709> on<00:03:14.860> to<00:03:15.040> do<00:03:15.160> something<00:03:15.489> else

he's moved on to do something else

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.729 
he's moved on to do something else
because<00:03:16.480> she's<00:03:16.780> very<00:03:16.959> persistent<00:03:17.440> she's<00:03:17.590> one

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:17.739 
because she's very persistent she's one

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:19.379 
because she's very persistent she's one
of<00:03:17.829> those<00:03:17.950> dogs<00:03:18.280> that<00:03:18.459> focuses<00:03:18.910> on<00:03:19.000> but<00:03:19.209> like

of those dogs that focuses on but like

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:20.699 
of those dogs that focuses on but like
she<00:03:19.540> can't<00:03:19.690> look<00:03:19.810> at<00:03:19.900> her<00:03:20.019> ball<00:03:20.200> all<00:03:20.410> day<00:03:20.440> long

she can't look at her ball all day long

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:22.319 
she can't look at her ball all day long
