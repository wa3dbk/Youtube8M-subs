00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.810 
everything is snapped on correctly
because<00:01:14.970> you<00:01:15.299> don't<00:01:15.479> want<00:01:15.979> it's<00:01:16.979> like<00:01:17.520> can<00:01:17.790> be

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
because you don't want it's like can be

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.480 
because you don't want it's like can be
half<00:01:18.240> done<00:01:18.509> or<00:01:18.659> whatever<00:01:18.930> because<00:01:19.650> if<00:01:20.130> you<00:01:20.369> do

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
half done or whatever because if you do

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:21.920 
half done or whatever because if you do
drop<00:01:20.700> it<00:01:20.850> when<00:01:20.970> it's<00:01:21.119> not<00:01:21.330> really<00:01:21.570> put<00:01:21.840> on

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
drop it when it's not really put on

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.179 
drop it when it's not really put on
correctly<00:01:22.080> it<00:01:22.560> won't<00:01:22.710> provide<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.040> maximum

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
correctly it won't provide the maximum

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.910 
correctly it won't provide the maximum
protection<00:01:23.549> and<00:01:24.020> it<00:01:25.020> won't<00:01:25.259> look<00:01:25.380> as<00:01:25.560> good<00:01:25.710> so

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
protection and it won't look as good so

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.740 
protection and it won't look as good so
that's<00:01:26.580> two<00:01:26.850> reasons<00:01:27.180> you<00:01:27.240> but<00:01:27.420> you<00:01:27.540> want<00:01:27.689> to

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
that's two reasons you but you want to

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.120 
that's two reasons you but you want to
look<00:01:27.930> good<00:01:28.020> you<00:01:28.080> want<00:01:28.259> to<00:01:28.409> provide<00:01:28.619> protection

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
look good you want to provide protection

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.640 
look good you want to provide protection
so<00:01:29.280> definitely<00:01:29.670> do<00:01:29.790> it<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:30.090> correct<00:01:30.420> way<00:01:30.650> a

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
so definitely do it the correct way a

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.230 
so definitely do it the correct way a
couple<00:01:32.130> other<00:01:32.220> things<00:01:32.310> is<00:01:32.759> that<00:01:32.790> it's<00:01:33.180> got

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
couple other things is that it's got

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.370 
couple other things is that it's got
openings<00:01:33.570> for<00:01:33.720> all<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:33.869> different<00:01:34.110> ports<00:01:34.259> and

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
openings for all the different ports and

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.270 
openings for all the different ports and
functions<00:01:34.680> so<00:01:34.740> you<00:01:34.829> can<00:01:34.950> still<00:01:35.070> get<00:01:35.189> to

the<00:01:41.159> bottom<00:01:41.310> relax<00:01:42.030> this<00:01:42.180> is<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.390> front

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
the bottom relax this is the front

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.179 
the bottom relax this is the front
screen<00:01:42.750> and<00:01:42.930> it<00:01:43.020> even<00:01:43.170> has<00:01:43.290> a<00:01:43.470> ridge<00:01:43.770> that<00:01:43.799> goes

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
screen and it even has a ridge that goes

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:45.560 
screen and it even has a ridge that goes
right<00:01:44.369> around<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.640> front<00:01:44.729> screen<00:01:44.970> to<00:01:45.420> help

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
right around the front screen to help

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.690 
right around the front screen to help
separate<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.020> phone<00:01:46.890> screen<00:01:47.220> from<00:01:47.399> a<00:01:47.520> flat

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
separate the phone screen from a flat

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.310 
separate the phone screen from a flat
surface<00:01:47.909> so<00:01:48.299> if<00:01:48.570> you<00:01:48.630> drop<00:01:48.840> it<00:01:48.869> then<00:01:49.170> there's

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
surface so if you drop it then there's

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.450 
surface so if you drop it then there's
just<00:01:49.470> a<00:01:49.530> little<00:01:49.710> space<00:01:49.950> between<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.340> two

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
just a little space between the two

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.460 
just a little space between the two
hopefully<00:01:51.240> saving<00:01:51.540> your<00:01:51.930> phone's<00:01:52.170> screen
