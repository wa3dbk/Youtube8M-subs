00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:15.430
 I am all full of dark circles and going 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:17.590
 also very much but now I asked 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:18.910
 very father because if it does not happen to you 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:20.680
 has the plays very marked and you 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:22.060
 you put your concealer on your face and look 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.400
 sometimes worse or change color to 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:26.919
 green is stupid because then that 's 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.660
 well it's very simple I invite you to this 

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:30.310
 video purely subscribe to my channel and 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.710
 if you are seeing me on your iphone or your 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:35.020
 ipad and other new things that have come out 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:38.290
 that I still do not have and that I want to have 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:39.640
 already to click on the link below you 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:43.140
 is going to put so that you do not battle nadita 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.140
 ok well let's start 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.670
 list 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:55.370
 with that the way this one participates here 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:57.890
 opposite even if you do not have time to 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:01.100
 fix all the hair already with this the 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:04.570
 one and it comes to your hair and you see 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.570
 like that because the truth 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:21.100
 if girls and boys can realize 

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:21.100
 that I have an eye with a mask which 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:27.040
 let's fix our eyes true and in the 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:29.950
 care and I have a super tip 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:32.160
 good and this tip I owe it to Luis 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:35.020
 sardÃ³n de corÃ³rner because she 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.340
 recommended that he buy this was with me 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.420
 and it made me great and I want that 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:41.020
 everyone knows ok 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:44.050
 this is a is an eraser paste so 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:46.330
 he calls in English and what he's going to do is 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:47.950
 The benefit and x ac mark in Mexico is 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.200
 hard to get it but it's fine 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.900
 simple because the color is what 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:55.630
 I care that you see 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:58.810
 and that they know so this is a color 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.460
 orange and there's also salmoncito already 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.070
 had explained before that this kind of 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:05.530
 colors what it does is that they lower us two 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:07.090
 or three shades of our ojera because it's 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.860
 very dark and if you have the ojera 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:12.450
 super dark like me and you put up 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:15.420
 your makeup for dark circles 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:17.879
 the only thing he's going to do is that sitel 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.920
 to for the color for the best good of 

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:23.580
 you better know how to do well, it will touch you but 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:26.340
 worse because he's going to grab the color this 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.500
 fact is more to know very clearly and in 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.420
 other parts to see the ojera as with 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.410
 something up and is the set two 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.960
 so what we have to do is 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:40.650
 it's the dark color of your little boy we're going 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:43.790
 to stop what we are going to see 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.790
 to put here like this 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:49.160
 with your ring finger so you do not 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:52.000
 mistreat that part of your skin 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.000
 missing 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.910
 you have used an orange that you see in 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:05.019
 the super the brand that you see and that 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:06.580
 say this is a salmon color one color 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:09.070
 orange 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:10.990
 you're going to put it like that and obviously not 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:13.960
 a tube is covered that the truth is 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:16.620
 see a lot of air today as if you mischievous 

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:16.620
 they sting or nothing 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:25.620
 and now we are going to put our our 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:28.080
 makeup for their faces and leads to 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:30.570
 work now yes you will be able to do your 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:32.640
 function and the color that is really 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:34.530
 will see the color that that in the very 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.300
 white of your skin will not go out 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:40.590
 because it does not help you very much grab one 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:43.380
 a shade more clear or salvio orange the 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:47.210
 medium will be a salmon cited and the one that is 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:50.210
 for whites with rosita ok 

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:50.210
 clarito 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:55.260
 I do not know how we're going to put here now 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:58.650

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:00.420
