 inquire examine explore explore 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:20.109
 investigate 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:21.009
 which in turn is to clarify or follow 

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:23.349
 a track 

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:25.750
 rather, asking questions is a 

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:29.079
 pretty common exercise that we practice 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:31.149
 everyone from small but there are questions 

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:33.370
 of questions there are those who are dedicated 

00:00:31.149 --> 00:00:39.550
 professionally to that matter of 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:41.500
 invent solve them I present to you 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.899
 alexander díaz gómez a man 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.399
 silent in his everyday life but full 

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:47.199
 of words me in his profession 

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:49.899
 coordinator of the reading and writing area 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:51.579
 of the grancolombian polytechnic and teacher 

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:54.129
 of subjects like cinema culture and 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:56.739
 semiotic counterculture and argumentation 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:58.780
 and as if that were not enough, the man runs a 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:00.940
 oral narrative space and the program 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.519
 of polyglot radio in addition to the nursery 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.710
 of research in comparative mythology 

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:08.289
 good teacher how does he get out 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.630
 so much time someone told me that 

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:11.950
 I should be living five days at 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:14.860
 weather 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:18.070
 surely it is due to 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:21.700
 my eagerness to try to do everything at 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:24.460
 same time and I'm dedicated to that to 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.200
 get the most out of all the 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:29.500
 activities that I do 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:31.390
 and doing them all with passion is clear what 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.939
 that alexander evokes in his students 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.829
 passion in what he does and in the stories 

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:37.780
 that narrates but if it's about telling 

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:40.539
 stories tell us where the 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:43.420
 his teacher since I was very small I had the 

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:46.270
 I had restlessness and fantasies about the 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.860
 fantastic literature but I 've 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:51.509
 Refugee a lot in the books I think 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:54.880
 the problem was that I was a stutterer 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:58.030
 stutterer a stuttering storyteller 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:01.000
 Well look, I think it was a very 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:03.159
 long and it was a personal process I myself 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.720
 I graduated having some problems of 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:08.079
 communication with people who were very 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:11.280
 introverted and I saw people who 

00:02:08.079 --> 00:02:16.880
 they spoke very fluently with some 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:19.700
 of envy or bad envy and in 1994 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.470
 I saw a storyteller at my university 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.810
 where I graduated from the university of 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.820
 andes and there everything changed I started going to 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.580
 all the oral storytelling workshops that 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:30.740
 they were giving there at the university and 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:33.830
 so now he is a driver of the 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:36.080
 orality and these students or not I 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:38.600
 I develop the orality of my 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:41.930
 students from a dialogue 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:43.400
 constant and a love for what so 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.160
 what are we doing for the 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.690
 research especially passionate 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.750
 for research 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:53.150
 that I am no longer passionate about what 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:55.520
 I would like to discover to solve questions 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.520
 and that I do from the orality in 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:01.450
 the classroom 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:04.480
 I become a suggestive of topics and 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:07.110
 we all learn and that's why the sessions 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.650
 they are so interesting sessions 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.650
 already 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:22.550
 because they are sessions where where the paper 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:25.370
 of the teacher is that of the facilitator and 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:27.080
 teacher's role is not that of dictator 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.330
 but your manager process 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:31.100
 investigatives there in the space of 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:33.320
 oral narration of the cop the man 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:36.080
 we also found it whole 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:38.990
 something else what we do in that 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:44.190
 oral narrative space is to involve 

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:46.560
 to the people it is again to return to 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:50.100
 cut all the students that the 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:53.280
 Narration is a form of manifestation 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:55.830
 of your being as an identity in this space 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.120
 of discounts from the mountain space 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:59.630
 International Polytechnic 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.630
 grancolombian 

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:08.549
 and last but not least Professor diaz or 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:10.379
 its polyglot program on the station of the 

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:12.090
 poli has a space for variety 

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:13.920
 of themes thanks to the magic of the 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:16.049
 word with the use of a language 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:18.299
 Informally cool guam usa and an excellent 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:20.579
 conversation but a lot of wagon 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:22.979
 alexander and his mercé he does when 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:24.870
 is quiet when I am silent 

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:27.930
 when he did not use the word leo leo 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:31.500
 a lot I'm reading more or less a book 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:33.870
 every two weeks and my passion besides 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:35.880
 the oral narration because they are the comics 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:39.380
 I read a lot 'green lantern' that my 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:42.750
 favorite character and batman a little 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:46.440
 all the fingers and comics and some 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:49.060
 independent print comics that 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:51.760
 I write I write poetry 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:53.800
 and I'm about to get you my 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:56.410
 third book of poetry that talks about 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:58.630
 relationships on the internet good and already 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:00.970
 to say goodbye to alexander we said what 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:03.669
 that he throw us an anecdote like all good 

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:05.169
 storyteller that is when I was more 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:06.870
 dedicated to oral narration that to the 

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:09.090
 academy 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:12.570
 in the charity of cundinamarca we 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:15.360
 took to tell stories to the crazy people of 

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:18.300
 I sibued the mentally ill and 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:21.230
 the mentally ill then to me 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:24.210
 touched the group of women because 

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:25.980
 we created imaginary with the words and 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:28.080
 then I got excited about having in 

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:30.690
 flower story I told a story is the 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:32.730
 sun of the wind of the stars were 

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:34.650
 very happy and then I decided to tell 

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:36.540
 a medieval story and a story that had 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:39.150
 a dragon then when he admits that 

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:40.800
 came a dragon the logic jumped and 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:42.780
 they ran away and that's where my 

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:44.340
 presentation and one of them approached and 

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:46.560
 my lord told me 

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:49.850

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:49.850
