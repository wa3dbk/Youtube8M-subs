key<00:00:08.760> things<00:00:08.790> that<00:00:09.269> we<00:00:09.570> had<00:00:09.719> to<00:00:09.980> make

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
key things that we had to make

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.009 
key things that we had to make
breakthroughs<00:00:11.219> in<00:00:11.550> to<00:00:11.910> make<00:00:12.059> this<00:00:12.210> happen<00:00:12.480> the

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
breakthroughs in to make this happen the

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.560 
breakthroughs in to make this happen the
first<00:00:13.349> one<00:00:13.590> is<00:00:13.889> the<00:00:14.190> sensor<00:00:14.610> 41-megapixel

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
first one is the sensor 41-megapixel

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.519 
first one is the sensor 41-megapixel
sensor<00:00:16.080> and<00:00:17.600> genuinely<00:00:18.600> there<00:00:18.900> are<00:00:19.050> 41

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
megapixel as on that sensor we've had

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.380 
megapixel as on that sensor we've had
people<00:00:22.800> questioning<00:00:23.640> whether<00:00:23.850> or<00:00:24.060> not<00:00:24.180> we're

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
people questioning whether or not we're

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.019 
people questioning whether or not we're
upscaling<00:00:25.289> or<00:00:25.740> anything<00:00:26.279> like<00:00:26.310> that<00:00:26.460> maybe

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
upscaling or anything like that maybe

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.150 
upscaling or anything like that maybe
it's<00:00:27.210> a<00:00:27.390> 20<00:00:27.930> megapixel<00:00:28.019> sensor<00:00:28.890> which<00:00:29.010> were

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
it's a 20 megapixel sensor which were

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.250 
it's a 20 megapixel sensor which were
upscaling<00:00:29.550> is<00:00:30.119> genuinely<00:00:30.599> 41-megapixel

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
upscaling is genuinely 41-megapixel

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.670 
upscaling is genuinely 41-megapixel
sensor<00:00:32.570> as<00:00:33.570> you<00:00:33.690> can<00:00:33.780> probably<00:00:33.930> guess<00:00:34.079> you

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
sensor as you can probably guess you

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.440 
sensor as you can probably guess you
can't<00:00:34.890> just<00:00:35.130> go<00:00:35.850> and<00:00:35.880> get<00:00:36.090> one<00:00:36.210> of<00:00:36.360> those

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
can't just go and get one of those

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.180 
can't just go and get one of those
things<00:00:36.660> off<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:36.989> shelf<00:00:37.260> they<00:00:37.860> just<00:00:38.040> don't

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
things off the shelf they just don't

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.430 
things off the shelf they just don't
exist<00:00:38.399> so<00:00:39.329> we<00:00:39.450> had<00:00:39.600> to<00:00:39.690> co-develop<00:00:40.079> that

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
exist so we had to co-develop that

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.639 
exist so we had to co-develop that
sensor<00:00:41.809> so<00:00:42.809> that<00:00:42.840> was<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.140> first<00:00:43.379> thing<00:00:43.500> that

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
sensor so that was the first thing that

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.369 
sensor so that was the first thing that
we<00:00:43.829> had<00:00:43.980> to<00:00:44.100> do<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:44.520> second<00:00:44.879> thing<00:00:45.090> was<00:00:45.450> with<00:00:46.350> a

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
we had to do the second thing was with a

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.110 
we had to do the second thing was with a
sensor<00:00:47.070> that's<00:00:47.160> able<00:00:47.399> to<00:00:47.640> resolve<00:00:47.910> that

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
sensor that's able to resolve that

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.200 
sensor that's able to resolve that
amount<00:00:48.420> of<00:00:48.510> detail<00:00:48.840> we<00:00:49.500> had<00:00:49.680> to<00:00:49.890> introduce<00:00:50.700> new

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
amount of detail we had to introduce new

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.750 
amount of detail we had to introduce new

getting<00:01:29.100> any<00:01:29.610> other<00:01:29.790> devices<00:01:30.119> that<00:01:30.540> i'm<00:01:31.229> aware

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
getting any other devices that i'm aware

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.450 
getting any other devices that i'm aware

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
of at least that will call 1080 video so

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.340 
of at least that will call 1080 video so
those<00:01:36.030> are<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.329> breakthroughs<00:01:36.930> that<00:01:36.960> we<00:01:37.170> had

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
those are the breakthroughs that we had

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.590 
those are the breakthroughs that we had
to<00:01:37.470> make<00:01:37.619> now<00:01:37.890> of<00:01:38.430> course<00:01:39.090> everybody's

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
to make now of course everybody's

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.780 
to make now of course everybody's
talking<00:01:39.720> about<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:40.020> 41<00:01:40.439> megapixels<00:01:41.100> but

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
talking about the 41 megapixels but

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.730 
talking about the 41 megapixels but
really<00:01:42.180> for<00:01:42.360> us<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:42.689> story<00:01:42.990> is<00:01:43.170> not<00:01:43.350> about<00:01:43.409> the

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
really for us the story is not about the

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.830 
really for us the story is not about the
number<00:01:44.070> of<00:01:44.159> megapixels<00:01:44.479> well<00:01:45.479> how<00:01:45.630> we're

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
number of megapixels well how we're

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.830 
number of megapixels well how we're
actually<00:01:45.960> using<00:01:46.170> those<00:01:46.680> pixels<00:01:47.189> that's<00:01:48.119> the

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
actually using those pixels that's the

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.350 
actually using those pixels that's the
really<00:01:49.110> big<00:01:49.229> deal<00:01:49.470> so<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:50.880> two<00:01:51.090> key<00:01:51.329> things

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
really big deal so the two key things

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.719 
really big deal so the two key things
that<00:01:51.780> we're<00:01:51.899> doing<00:01:52.020> here<00:01:52.350> first<00:01:53.100> is<00:01:53.340> over

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
that we're doing here first is over

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.390 
that we're doing here first is over
sampling<00:01:54.090> and<00:01:54.420> this<00:01:54.810> allows<00:01:55.049> you<00:01:55.259> to<00:01:55.380> capture

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:56.400 
sampling and this allows you to capture

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.300 
sampling and this allows you to capture
create<00:01:57.120> 5<00:01:57.480> megapixel<00:01:58.110> images<00:01:58.440> which<00:01:59.130> are

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
create 5 megapixel images which are

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.250

the sensor has available to it so we

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:21.730 
the sensor has available to it so we

end<00:03:44.780> up<00:03:44.930> being<00:03:45.110> 5.6<00:03:45.980> we're<00:03:46.760> still<00:03:46.970> 2.4<00:03:47.690> which

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:47.870 
end up being 5.6 we're still 2.4 which

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:49.900 
end up being 5.6 we're still 2.4 which
means<00:03:48.080> we<00:03:48.260> have<00:03:48.410> five<00:03:48.650> point<00:03:48.980> four<00:03:49.190> times<00:03:49.550> the

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:49.910 
means we have five point four times the

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:51.610 
means we have five point four times the

throughout<00:03:52.520> the<00:03:52.670> zoom<00:03:52.880> then<00:03:53.330> you<00:03:53.420> would<00:03:53.570> get

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690 
throughout the zoom then you would get

with conventional optical zooms it's
completely<00:03:56.510> silent<00:03:57.020> as<00:03:57.170> well<00:03:57.350> so<00:03:57.530> it<00:03:57.590> means

00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:57.709 
completely silent as well so it means

make the upgrade to this device a lot of
logic<00:04:08.600> in<00:04:08.750> that<00:04:08.780> I<00:04:09.650> think<00:04:10.340> there's<00:04:10.459> also<00:04:10.610> going

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:10.820 
logic in that I think there's also going

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:13.840 
logic in that I think there's also going
to<00:04:10.880> be<00:04:10.940> a<00:04:11.000> lot<00:04:11.180> of<00:04:11.209> people<00:04:11.630> who<00:04:12.489> the<00:04:13.489> kind<00:04:13.730> of
