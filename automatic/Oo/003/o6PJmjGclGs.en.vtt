pulling<00:00:09.120> out<00:00:09.240> of<00:00:09.300> the<00:00:09.389> peg<00:00:09.630> so<00:00:10.620> there<00:00:10.769> we<00:00:10.889> can

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
pulling out of the peg so there we can

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.299 
pulling out of the peg so there we can
see<00:00:11.219> the<00:00:11.250> engine<00:00:12.860> this<00:00:13.860> is<00:00:14.009> a<00:00:14.070> bit<00:00:14.190> we're

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
see the engine this is a bit we're

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:15.980 
see the engine this is a bit we're
looking<00:00:14.580> at<00:00:14.700> the<00:00:14.820> head<00:00:15.000> bow<00:00:15.179> and<00:00:15.450> the<00:00:15.570> piston

whatever<00:00:32.460> you<00:00:32.610> call<00:00:32.850> in<00:00:33.030> it<00:00:33.120> but<00:00:33.600> this<00:00:33.690> is<00:00:33.840> the

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
whatever you call in it but this is the

whatever you call in it but this is the
little<00:00:34.170> fella<00:00:34.380> so<00:00:34.649> we're<00:00:34.739> gonna<00:00:34.860> cover<00:00:35.100> this

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
little fella so we're gonna cover this

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.130 
little fella so we're gonna cover this
bit<00:00:35.550> here<00:00:35.700> and<00:00:36.030> a<00:00:36.149> simply<00:00:36.450> pull<00:00:36.630> this<00:00:36.780> off<00:00:36.989> the

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
bit here and a simply pull this off the

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.090 
bit here and a simply pull this off the
spark<00:00:37.380> plug<00:00:37.649> to<00:00:39.379> reveal<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:40.559> spark<00:00:40.860> plug

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
spark plug to reveal the spark plug

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.790 
spark plug to reveal the spark plug
there<00:00:41.370> and<00:00:41.969> undo<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.540> spark<00:00:42.809> plug<00:00:43.079> and<00:00:43.290> have<00:00:43.770> a

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
there and undo the spark plug and have a

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.160 
there and undo the spark plug and have a
look<00:00:44.070> at<00:00:44.219> it<00:00:44.399> you<00:00:44.700> can<00:00:44.760> tell<00:00:45.030> a<00:00:45.059> lot<00:00:45.390> about<00:00:45.450> how

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
look at it you can tell a lot about how

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.049 
look at it you can tell a lot about how
it<00:00:46.289> engines<00:00:46.620> running<00:00:46.890> by<00:00:47.340> the<00:00:47.399> condition<00:00:47.940> of

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
it engines running by the condition of

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:48.770 
it engines running by the condition of
the<00:00:48.149> spark<00:00:48.480> plug

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
the spark plug

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:55.220 
the spark plug
so<00:00:49.590> simply<00:00:50.370> undo<00:00:52.699> with<00:00:53.699> a<00:00:53.730> plug<00:00:54.000> spanner<00:00:54.390> there

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
so simply undo with a plug spanner there

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.750 
so simply undo with a plug spanner there
are<00:00:55.379> tools<00:00:55.680> for<00:00:55.829> this<00:00:56.129> job<00:00:56.399> that<00:00:56.520> you<00:00:56.610> can

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
are tools for this job that you can

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.270 
are tools for this job that you can
carry<00:00:57.090> small<00:00:57.570> plug<00:00:57.809> spanner<00:00:58.170> tools<00:00:58.469> nice<00:00:59.010> and

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
carry small plug spanner tools nice and

00:00:59.280 --> 00:00:59.650 
carry small plug spanner tools nice and
easy

00:00:59.650 --> 00:00:59.660 
easy

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:02.299 
easy
remember<00:01:00.660> if<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:01.559> end<00:01:01.680> has<00:01:01.800> been<00:01:01.920> running

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
remember if the end has been running

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.460 
remember if the end has been running
this<00:01:02.550> is<00:01:02.730> hot<00:01:02.969> this<00:01:03.239> spark<00:01:03.660> plug<00:01:03.870> is<00:01:03.899> hot<00:01:04.229> and

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
this is hot this spark plug is hot and

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.350 
this is hot this spark plug is hot and
it<00:01:04.559> will<00:01:04.799> burn<00:01:05.070> you<00:01:05.339> so<00:01:05.519> before<00:01:06.119> messing

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
it will burn you so before messing

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:38.870 
it will burn you so before messing
around<00:01:06.570> with<00:01:06.810> a<00:01:06.900> spark<00:01:07.170> plug<00:01:08.659> down<00:01:09.659> a<00:01:09.689> bit<00:01:37.880> and

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
around with a spark plug down a bit and

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.370 
around with a spark plug down a bit and
looking<00:01:39.180> at<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.329> condition<00:01:39.810> of<00:01:39.930> this<00:01:40.049> spark

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
looking at the condition of this spark

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.730 
looking at the condition of this spark
plug<00:01:40.470> as<00:01:40.890> you<00:01:41.400> can<00:01:41.579> see<00:01:42.229> it's<00:01:43.229> got<00:01:43.320> good<00:01:43.470> oil

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
plug as you can see it's got good oil

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.420 
plug as you can see it's got good oil
