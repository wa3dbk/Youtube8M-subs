00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
friends come online off is that pops up

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.810 
friends come online off is that pops up
along<00:02:21.860> anyways<00:02:22.860> going<00:02:23.220> right<00:02:23.370> across<00:02:23.460> the<00:02:23.670> map

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820

again<00:02:23.970> this<00:02:24.300> time<00:02:24.510> on<00:02:24.810> my<00:02:24.990> mount<00:02:25.260> up<00:02:25.830> the<00:02:26.100> ramp

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
again this time on my mount up the ramp

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.190 
again this time on my mount up the ramp
because<00:02:26.910> the<00:02:27.030> ramp<00:02:27.209> is<00:02:27.360> faster<00:02:27.840> than<00:02:28.110> the

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
because the ramp is faster than the

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.870 
because the ramp is faster than the
tunnel<00:02:28.530> because<00:02:29.430> you<00:02:29.550> don't<00:02:29.700> have<00:02:29.760> to

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
tunnel because you don't have to

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.720 
tunnel because you don't have to
actually<00:02:30.090> walk<00:02:30.450> at<00:02:30.720> all<00:02:30.840> on<00:02:31.200> the<00:02:31.350> ramp<00:02:31.730> if

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
actually walk at all on the ramp if

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.580 
actually walk at all on the ramp if
you're<00:02:33.000> lucky<00:02:33.120> you'll<00:02:33.690> like<00:02:33.930> just<00:02:34.290> enough

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
you're lucky you'll like just enough

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:35.780 
you're lucky you'll like just enough
that<00:02:34.620> you<00:02:34.860> don't<00:02:34.890> dismount<00:02:35.430> when<00:02:35.610> you<00:02:35.700> go
