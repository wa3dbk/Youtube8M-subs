00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:12.269
 little cars are one of those objects 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:14.599

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.859
 little cars you did not get for autistic 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:19.769

 When they reach maturity the toys already 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.499
 they are not what they were and they become
