00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.050 
obviously they've got to be good with
accuracy<00:02:37.960> that's<00:02:38.770> right<00:02:38.950> when<00:02:39.850> you<00:02:39.940> actually

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
accuracy that's right when you actually

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:41.850 
accuracy that's right when you actually
reconfigure<00:02:40.750> the<00:02:40.900> right<00:02:41.050> you<00:02:41.590> can<00:02:41.710> actually

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
reconfigure the right you can actually

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.310 
reconfigure the right you can actually
take<00:02:42.220> the<00:02:42.340> conversions<00:02:42.910> there<00:02:43.060> put<00:02:44.050> them<00:02:44.140> back

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
take the conversions there put them back

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.080 
take the conversions there put them back
in<00:02:44.560> and<00:02:44.890> you<00:02:45.010> can<00:02:45.040> maintain<00:02:45.370> the<00:02:45.790> repeat<00:02:46.060> of

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
in and you can maintain the repeat of

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:47.550 
in and you can maintain the repeat of
work<00:02:46.330> but<00:02:46.540> he<00:02:46.660> comes<00:02:46.870> back<00:02:46.990> with<00:02:47.260> the<00:02:47.350> last

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
work but he comes back with the last

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:57.300 
work but he comes back with the last
minute<00:02:47.860> event<00:02:51.120> calendar<00:02:55.950> the<00:02:56.950> way<00:02:57.070> they

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
minute event calendar the way they

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.220 
minute event calendar the way they
pioneered<00:02:57.610> their<00:02:57.940> system<00:02:58.330> and<00:02:58.570> the<00:02:58.780> fact<00:02:59.170> that

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
pioneered their system and the fact that

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.130 
pioneered their system and the fact that
it's<00:02:59.410> so<00:02:59.590> easy<00:03:00.360> roughly<00:03:01.360> takes<00:03:01.600> under<00:03:02.110> a

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
it's so easy roughly takes under a

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:07.140 
it's so easy roughly takes under a
minute<00:03:02.350> to<00:03:02.770> do<00:03:02.890> yeah<00:03:05.370> just<00:03:06.370> put<00:03:06.730> the<00:03:06.820> barrel

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
minute to do yeah just put the barrel

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.510 
minute to do yeah just put the barrel
back<00:03:07.180> into<00:03:07.690> the<00:03:07.780> ball<00:03:07.959> back<00:03:08.170> in<00:03:08.380> and<00:03:09.130> even<00:03:09.280> the

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:09.520 
back into the ball back in and even the

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.900 
back into the ball back in and even the
secon<00:03:09.910> corporate<00:03:10.420> just<00:03:10.660> really

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
secon corporate just really

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.730 
secon corporate just really
yeah<00:03:13.910> very<00:03:14.480> straight<00:03:14.870> to<00:03:14.990> put<00:03:15.200> it<00:03:15.320> very<00:03:15.530> easy

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:15.740 
yeah very straight to put it very easy

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:21.070 
yeah very straight to put it very easy
to<00:03:15.950> do<00:03:16.130> yep<00:03:16.750> and<00:03:17.750> with<00:03:18.020> my<00:03:18.230> fire<00:03:18.560> quickly<00:03:20.080> yeah

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:21.080 
to do yep and with my fire quickly yeah

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:22.630 
to do yep and with my fire quickly yeah
that<00:03:21.290> was<00:03:21.410> going<00:03:21.590> to<00:03:21.650> be<00:03:21.740> my<00:03:21.890> next<00:03:21.950> question<00:03:22.190> is

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:22.640 
that was going to be my next question is

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:25.060 
that was going to be my next question is
there<00:03:22.790> any<00:03:22.880> sort<00:03:23.090> of<00:03:23.180> safety<00:03:23.560> issues<00:03:24.560> there's

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:25.070 
there any sort of safety issues there's

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:28.480 
there any sort of safety issues there's
no<00:03:25.310> safeguards<00:03:25.940> so<00:03:26.830> they<00:03:27.830> can<00:03:28.010> I<00:03:28.100> to<00:03:28.160> go<00:03:28.310> back

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:28.490 
no safeguards so they can I to go back

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:32.210 
no safeguards so they can I to go back
together<00:03:28.640> one<00:03:28.970> way

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.700 

that's<00:03:32.850> likely<00:03:33.120> put<00:03:33.390> it<00:03:33.660> excellent<00:03:34.290> what<00:03:34.530> sort

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:34.710 
that's likely put it excellent what sort

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:36.680 
that's likely put it excellent what sort
of<00:03:34.770> price<00:03:34.980> is<00:03:35.490> the<00:03:35.730> retail<00:03:36.090> price<00:03:36.360> on<00:03:36.600> the

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
of price is the retail price on the

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.830 
of price is the retail price on the
different<00:03:36.990> models<00:03:37.260> okay<00:03:38.250> so<00:03:38.310> obviously<00:03:38.840> the

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
different models okay so obviously the

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.040 
different models okay so obviously the
Bison<00:03:40.170> held<00:03:40.380> the<00:03:40.530> light<00:03:40.710> rail<00:03:40.980> why<00:03:41.280> it's<00:03:41.670> not

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:42.050 
Bison held the light rail why it's not

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:51.290 
Bison held the light rail why it's not
about<00:03:43.050> fuck<00:03:43.320> off<00:03:43.650> now<00:03:43.680> let<00:03:44.490> me<00:03:44.610> move<00:03:50.180> which<00:03:51.180> I

about fuck off now let me move which I

about fuck off now let me move which I
suppose<00:03:51.540> you're<00:03:51.810> looking<00:03:52.080> at<00:03:52.230> a<00:03:52.620> fairly<00:03:53.070> good

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
suppose you're looking at a fairly good

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.870 
suppose you're looking at a fairly good
voice<00:03:54.710> it's<00:03:55.710> really<00:03:56.070> like<00:03:56.250> you<00:03:56.430> know<00:03:56.700> you<00:03:56.760> like

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
voice it's really like you know you like

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.130 
voice it's really like you know you like
for<00:03:57.180> example<00:03:57.240> if<00:03:57.600> you<00:03:57.690> look<00:03:57.780> at<00:03:57.900> accuracy

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 
for example if you look at accuracy

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:59.990 
for example if you look at accuracy
international<00:03:58.470> and<00:03:59.190> out<00:03:59.340> here<00:03:59.520> in<00:03:59.580> Australia

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
international and out here in Australia

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.850 
international and out here in Australia
I<00:04:00.060> think<00:04:00.300> from<00:04:00.720> memory<00:04:00.810> about<00:04:01.170> ten<00:04:01.410> thousand

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:01.860 
I think from memory about ten thousand

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:05.140 
I think from memory about ten thousand
dollars<00:04:02.130> there<00:04:02.310> with<00:04:02.550> the<00:04:02.640> entry-level<00:04:02.970> side

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150 
dollars there with the entry-level side

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:08.600 
dollars there with the entry-level side
we<00:04:06.150> really<00:04:06.990> got<00:04:07.410> the<00:04:07.950> knee<00:04:08.070> high<00:04:08.220> skill<00:04:08.490> I'm

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:08.610 
we really got the knee high skill I'm

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:14.530 
we really got the knee high skill I'm
over<00:04:08.820> the<00:04:08.910> time<00:04:09.180> eight<00:04:09.360> seven<00:04:10.140> five<00:04:10.260> sites

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:14.540 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:17.370 

it's<00:04:15.020> competitive<00:04:15.560> the<00:04:15.650> question<00:04:16.010> according

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.380 
it's competitive the question according

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:20.170 
it's competitive the question according
significantly<00:04:18.700> predicted<00:04:19.700> and<00:04:19.910> what<00:04:20.060> are

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:20.180 
significantly predicted and what are

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:23.409 
significantly predicted and what are
they<00:04:20.299> I<00:04:20.720> can<00:04:21.079> see<00:04:21.260> orders<00:04:21.620> have<00:04:21.739> been<00:04:21.859> a<00:04:22.419> lorry

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:23.419 
they I can see orders have been a lorry

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:48.190 
they I can see orders have been a lorry
and<00:04:45.220> patrolman<00:04:46.220> it's<00:04:46.610> a<00:04:46.700> very<00:04:46.910> rugged<00:04:47.200> basic

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:48.200 
and patrolman it's a very rugged basic

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.800 
and patrolman it's a very rugged basic
design<00:04:48.560> and<00:04:48.889> that's<00:04:49.820> the<00:04:50.060> advantage<00:04:50.300> is

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:50.810 
design and that's the advantage is

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:53.920 
design and that's the advantage is
complex<00:04:51.560> it's<00:04:52.340> very<00:04:52.639> easy<00:04:53.240> to<00:04:53.419> service<00:04:53.900> to
