from<00:01:10.189> on<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.430> bottom<00:01:11.820> we<00:01:12.240> have<00:01:12.420> eight

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
from on the bottom we have eight

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.230 
from on the bottom we have eight
gigabytes<00:01:13.229> of<00:01:13.530> NAND<00:01:13.770> flash<00:01:13.950> for<00:01:14.670> storage<00:01:15.030> and

then<00:01:15.750> some<00:01:16.020> more<00:01:16.049> ddr3<00:01:16.830> chips<00:01:17.100> and<00:01:17.909> we<00:01:18.420> have<00:01:18.570> a

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
then some more ddr3 chips and we have a

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.350 
then some more ddr3 chips and we have a
bluetooth<00:01:19.170> for<00:01:19.439> Wi-Fi<00:01:20.100> module<00:01:20.640> on<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:21.090> bottom

bluetooth for Wi-Fi module on the bottom
as<00:01:22.350> well<00:01:22.790> I'll<00:01:23.790> boot<00:01:24.390> this<00:01:24.600> board<00:01:24.900> and<00:01:25.140> sheet

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
as well I'll boot this board and sheet

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.800 
as well I'll boot this board and sheet
with<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:25.890> operating<00:01:26.250> system<00:01:26.340> and<00:01:26.939> how<00:01:27.630> well

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
with the operating system and how well

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:35.420 
with the operating system and how well
it<00:01:27.930> performs<00:01:28.439> so<00:01:29.390> let's<00:01:30.390> get<00:01:30.509> started<00:01:34.369> ok<00:01:35.369> so

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
it performs so let's get started ok so

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:36.980 
it performs so let's get started ok so
boots<00:01:35.820> really<00:01:35.970> quick<00:01:36.270> I'm<00:01:36.420> just<00:01:36.450> gonna<00:01:36.750> run

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
boots really quick I'm just gonna run

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.539 
boots really quick I'm just gonna run
through<00:01:37.020> some<00:01:37.290> demos<00:01:37.710> just<00:01:37.979> to<00:01:38.130> show<00:01:38.340> you<00:01:38.400> how

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
through some demos just to show you how

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.569 
through some demos just to show you how
fast<00:01:39.329> it<00:01:39.689> feels<00:01:40.040> it's<00:01:41.040> got<00:01:41.159> a<00:01:41.189> little<00:01:41.400> bit<00:01:41.490> of

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
fast it feels it's got a little bit of

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.429 
fast it feels it's got a little bit of
tearing<00:01:41.939> not<00:01:42.240> too<00:01:42.450> bad

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:45.439 

00:01:45.439 --> 00:02:04.920 

here's<00:01:46.439> one<00:01:46.649> called<00:01:46.890> cubes<00:01:47.490> or<00:01:47.850> SGX<00:01:48.720> cubes

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:04.930 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:06.810 

so<00:02:05.440> the<00:02:05.530> graphics<00:02:05.950> performance<00:02:06.130> is<00:02:06.580> pretty

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:06.820 
so the graphics performance is pretty

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:56.080 
so the graphics performance is pretty
cool

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.100 

so<00:02:56.599> yeah<00:02:56.750> that's<00:02:57.020> pretty<00:02:57.050> gnarly<00:02:57.380> and<00:02:57.920> then<00:02:58.099> um

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
so yeah that's pretty gnarly and then um

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:06.520 
so yeah that's pretty gnarly and then um
see<00:03:00.110> if<00:03:00.170> you<00:03:00.290> let<00:03:00.470> me<00:03:04.209> let's<00:03:05.209> do<00:03:05.360> magic<00:03:06.110> lantern

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
see if you let me let's do magic lantern

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:11.710 
see if you let me let's do magic lantern
just<00:03:06.830> to<00:03:06.920> see<00:03:07.099> what<00:03:07.220> it<00:03:07.310> looks<00:03:07.459> like<00:03:10.630> it's<00:03:11.630> kind

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
just to see what it looks like it's kind

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:20.380 
just to see what it looks like it's kind
of<00:03:11.810> weird<00:03:13.269> but<00:03:14.269> hey<00:03:14.800> graphics<00:03:15.800> awesome<00:03:19.390> and

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:20.390 
of weird but hey graphics awesome and

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:47.040 
of weird but hey graphics awesome and
then<00:03:21.190> shader<00:03:22.190> views

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:47.050 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:04:27.170 

that's<00:03:47.620> pretty<00:03:47.800> working

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:31.310 

all<00:04:27.720> right<00:04:28.520> well<00:04:29.520> bow<00:04:29.759> that's<00:04:30.030> the<00:04:30.270> demos

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.320 
all right well bow that's the demos

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:35.689 
all right well bow that's the demos
that's<00:04:31.800> all<00:04:31.949> it<00:04:32.040> has<00:04:32.190> for<00:04:32.430> demos<00:04:32.729> and<00:04:32.970> then<00:04:34.699> the

00:04:35.689 --> 00:04:35.699 
that's all it has for demos and then the

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:37.670 
that's all it has for demos and then the
the<00:04:36.300> refresh<00:04:36.630> rate<00:04:36.780> the<00:04:37.229> screen<00:04:37.530> resolution

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
the refresh rate the screen resolution

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.260 
the refresh rate the screen resolution
looks<00:04:38.250> really<00:04:38.520> good

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270 
looks really good

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:41.480 
looks really good
it<00:04:39.539> comes<00:04:39.720> with<00:04:39.930> iceweasel<00:04:40.380> it<00:04:41.070> doesn't<00:04:41.370> come

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 
it comes with iceweasel it doesn't come

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:47.960 
it comes with iceweasel it doesn't come
with<00:04:41.610> chromium<00:04:42.110> except<00:04:43.110> ze<00:04:43.320> for<00:04:46.190> ya<00:04:47.190> so<00:04:47.370> the

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:47.970 
with chromium except ze for ya so the

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:50.779 
with chromium except ze for ya so the
Wi-Fi<00:04:48.330> is<00:04:48.389> nice<00:04:48.690> touch<00:04:48.990> got<00:04:49.289> a<00:04:49.320> 211<00:04:49.770> in<00:04:50.250> Wi-Fi

00:04:50.779 --> 00:04:50.789 
Wi-Fi is nice touch got a 211 in Wi-Fi

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:54.020 
Wi-Fi is nice touch got a 211 in Wi-Fi
anyway<00:04:51.720> that's<00:04:52.289> that's<00:04:52.770> all<00:04:52.979> I<00:04:53.009> have<00:04:53.280> if<00:04:53.789> you

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.030 
anyway that's that's all I have if you
