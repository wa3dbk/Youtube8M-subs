is<00:04:54.430> a<00:04:54.460> little<00:04:54.820> bit<00:04:54.940> glitchy<00:04:55.270> on<00:04:55.900> your<00:04:56.710> one

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:57.460 
is a little bit glitchy on your one

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.880 
is a little bit glitchy on your one
desktop<00:04:58.000> I'm<00:04:58.210> not<00:04:58.390> sure<00:04:58.600> if<00:04:58.720> that's<00:04:58.900> same<00:04:59.500> for

00:04:59.880 --> 00:04:59.890 
desktop I'm not sure if that's same for

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:02.220 
desktop I'm not sure if that's same for
if<00:04:59.980> you<00:05:00.070> have<00:05:00.220> multiple<00:05:00.790> monitors<00:05:01.080> because<00:05:02.080> I

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:02.230 
if you have multiple monitors because I

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:04.680 
if you have multiple monitors because I
don't<00:05:02.440> have<00:05:02.620> that<00:05:02.860> so<00:05:03.220> you'll<00:05:04.210> probably<00:05:04.450> just

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:04.690 
don't have that so you'll probably just

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:06.780 
don't have that so you'll probably just
have<00:05:04.840> to<00:05:04.960> find<00:05:05.230> that<00:05:05.350> out<00:05:05.410> yourself<00:05:05.590> now<00:05:06.460> what

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:06.790

oh that's why I didn't hit run Humbert
I'm<00:06:33.640> retarded<00:06:35.580> and<00:06:36.580> it's<00:06:36.880> not<00:06:37.300> responding<00:06:37.750> at

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:37.960 
I'm retarded and it's not responding at

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:39.120 
I'm retarded and it's not responding at
the<00:06:38.080> moment<00:06:38.410> that's<00:06:38.530> probably<00:06:38.830> because<00:06:39.010> I'm

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:39.130 
the moment that's probably because I'm

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:44.100 
the moment that's probably because I'm
recording<00:06:41.100> we'll<00:06:42.100> just<00:06:42.420> keep<00:06:43.420> it<00:06:43.630> at<00:06:43.780> windows

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:44.110 
recording we'll just keep it at windows

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:49.110 
recording we'll just keep it at windows
7<00:06:44.380> basic<00:06:45.870> mmm<00:06:46.870> all<00:06:47.200> right<00:06:47.350> there<00:06:47.560> it<00:06:47.650> goes<00:06:48.120> so

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:49.120 
7 basic mmm all right there it goes so

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:51.390 
7 basic mmm all right there it goes so
let's<00:06:49.300> see<00:06:49.450> if<00:06:49.540> it'll<00:06:49.690> respond<00:06:50.290> now<00:06:50.560> it's<00:06:51.190> an

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:51.400 
let's see if it'll respond now it's an

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:53.250 
let's see if it'll respond now it's an
older<00:06:51.700> program<00:06:51.940> I<00:06:52.180> think<00:06:52.390> is<00:06:52.660> why<00:06:52.900> it's<00:06:53.110> doing

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:53.260 
older program I think is why it's doing

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:56.220 
older program I think is why it's doing
this<00:06:53.470> but<00:06:54.240> other<00:06:55.240> than<00:06:55.510> that<00:06:55.780> it's<00:06:56.050> pretty

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:56.230 
this but other than that it's pretty

00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:59.340 
this but other than that it's pretty
neat<00:06:56.800> like<00:06:57.040> say<00:06:57.220> your<00:06:57.540> you've<00:06:58.540> got<00:06:58.570> like<00:06:59.050> sort

00:06:59.340 --> 00:06:59.350 
neat like say your you've got like sort

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:01.560 
neat like say your you've got like sort
of<00:06:59.410> a<00:06:59.500> microphone<00:07:00.040> and<00:07:00.370> it's<00:07:00.880> wireless<00:07:01.150> you've

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:01.570 
of a microphone and it's wireless you've

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:03.120 
of a microphone and it's wireless you've
got<00:07:01.780> it<00:07:01.900> plugged<00:07:02.080> into<00:07:02.320> your<00:07:02.440> computer<00:07:03.100> and

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:12.280 
will go scrolling up by itself and then

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:14.520 
will go scrolling up by itself and then
it'll<00:07:12.430> go<00:07:12.700> to<00:07:12.760> the<00:07:13.000> right<00:07:13.120> or<00:07:13.660> left<00:07:14.260> and<00:07:14.380> you
