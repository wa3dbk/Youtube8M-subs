 this tennis player trembled in white has just won the victory against a 

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:16.939
 French opponent in three sets at the end of a highly contested match on 3

 europe in an overwhelming heat 

00:00:19.839 --> 00:00:22.140
 the Shiites this had to be pulled 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.660
 yes the heat was really hard today we did not at all 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.750
 the habit without landmarks you have to be very strong mentally and be very 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:30.499
 concentrated 

00:00:30.499 --> 00:00:34.280
 otherwise we can lose the match 25 aces the leaflet taponier 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.120
 and what countries 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.289
 on the end of the match and it's really hard to stay focused 

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:41.760
 especially physically begins to let go in the evening 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.320
 very offensive folk the moment I cracked on a game which allowed to 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:46.400
 to win 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.460
 15th edition marked by exceptional weather conditions 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.600
 the organizers had to adapt 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.250
 from the first two days we made a break 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.650
 in the afternoon the most expensive authors how to get started 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:04.560
 that from 4 pm games but we finished very late the 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.550
 evening on the other hand but already it was fresh 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:11.390
 in addition we have distributed widely water to all players 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.370
 and every other night minutes of weather conditions that have 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:18.060
 direct impact on the game 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.470
 his influence 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.550
 but that's not what makes you come full full match 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:26.630
 but this time now access his level a physical tone that makes you breathe 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.630
 piece to accentuate the clay is very fast 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:31.420
 four shots 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.270
 dies for 130 participants from 20 countries 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.390
 pampered from 6 o'clock in the morning 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.220
 by the agents of the sports department 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.130
 especially for the facts of which the morning or the evening at the moment 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.270
 copiously 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.640
 and after each match 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.950
 we go on to troll the net man much more on him 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.080
 the little trailer for 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.710
 red thread for the roudourou 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.789
 another more unexpected consequence of the heat wave 

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:58.549
 plastic ropes are heating up so there are two times more class than 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:01:59.450
 ordinarily 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:00.450
 a tournament 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.619
 where climatic conditions should be more pleasant for 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:05.149
 semifinals and finals 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:06.399
