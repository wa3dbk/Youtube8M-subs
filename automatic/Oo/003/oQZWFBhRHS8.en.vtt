00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.500
 [Music] 

00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:16.970
 hello today I show you how to elaborate 

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:19.130
 confectioners for your parties the first thing that 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:22.579
 we will make will cut a rectangle of 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:25.749
 fabric 55 centimeters long by 20 

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:25.749
 centimeters wide 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:32.660
 once we are ready we double it for the 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:34.790
 half immediately we will take one of the 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:37.010
 two pieces that we have in the part 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:40.110
 top and we're going to fold it towards 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:42.820
 in about two centimeters 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.160
 [Music] 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:48.510
 to avoid that the fold of 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.510
 we have with a pin 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:57.490
 immediately with the help of our needle and 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:01:00.370
 thread or yarn let's start sewing 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:03.460
 with a simple stitch starting from 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.879
 down up and we should be left 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:19.540
 the following way 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:19.540
 [Music] 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:26.010
 we repeat this procedure in the other 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:27.850
 end of the fabric 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:30.340
 [Music] 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:32.590
 already having both sides ready 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.830
 we are going to join the extremes 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:48.540
 laterals as I show you 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:51.270
 [Music] 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.940
 it is very important to leave these 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:57.770
 spaces and we repeat the same 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:02:06.400
 procedure on the opposite side 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:06.400
 [Music] 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:16.240
 now to be able to close the bag we are going 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:18.709
 to take 44 centimeters from the ribbon 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:21.560
 we take a large insurance and what 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:25.250
 we introduce into the bar this is for 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:48.170
 introduce it easier to the sachet 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:51.990
 [Music] 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:54.990
 and ready the bag is already finished 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:57.720
 now to decorate you can use 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:59.610
 decal paste the fomi works for 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.900
 make them firmer 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:04.569
 [Music] 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.939
 or you can also use figures 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:09.090
 made with foami or other material from 

00:03:06.939 --> 00:03:11.040
 your preference 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.500
 [Music] 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.960
