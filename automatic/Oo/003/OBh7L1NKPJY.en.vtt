in<00:00:15.150> this<00:00:16.049> particular<00:00:16.260> project<00:00:16.710> we're

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
in this particular project we're

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.769 
in this particular project we're
laminating<00:00:17.609> to<00:00:17.789> thick<00:00:18.119> pieces<00:00:18.480> of<00:00:18.600> stone

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.170 
laminating to thick pieces of stone
together<00:00:18.990> for<00:00:19.440> the<00:00:19.529> upper<00:00:19.800> bar<00:00:20.070> in<00:00:20.730> order<00:00:21.000> to

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
together for the upper bar in order to

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.120 
together for the upper bar in order to
get<00:00:21.300> a<00:00:21.330> nice<00:00:21.630> tight<00:00:22.020> lamination<00:00:22.740> we<00:00:22.859> have<00:00:22.980> to

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
get a nice tight lamination we have to

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.400 
get a nice tight lamination we have to
smooth<00:00:23.460> the<00:00:23.640> back<00:00:23.820> surface<00:00:24.179> here<00:00:25.080> we're<00:00:25.259> using

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
smooth the back surface here we're using

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.319

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:50.020 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:52.330 

we're<00:00:51.020> now<00:00:51.170> ready<00:00:51.379> for<00:00:51.470> our<00:00:51.650> lamination<00:00:52.190> we

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:52.340 
we're now ready for our lamination we

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.850 
we're now ready for our lamination we
lay<00:00:52.489> both<00:00:52.730> of<00:00:52.879> our<00:00:53.000> pieces<00:00:53.329> down<00:00:53.510> flat<00:00:53.930> upside

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:54.860 
lay both of our pieces down flat upside

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.000 
lay both of our pieces down flat upside
down

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.010 
down

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.790 
down
we're<00:00:57.579> going<00:00:57.730> to<00:00:57.790> use<00:00:57.940> epoxy<00:00:58.800> wanna

00:00:59.790 --> 00:00:59.800 
we're going to use epoxy wanna

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.090 
we're going to use epoxy wanna
thoroughly<00:01:00.370> measure<00:01:01.090> our<00:01:01.360> epoxy<00:01:01.980> making<00:01:02.980> sure

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.100 
thoroughly measure our epoxy making sure

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:15.660 
thoroughly measure our epoxy making sure
we're<00:01:03.250> using<00:01:03.280> the<00:01:03.550> right<00:01:03.730> proportions

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.100 

now<00:01:16.670> this<00:01:16.850> step<00:01:17.030> is<00:01:17.180> very<00:01:17.240> important<00:01:17.930> you<00:01:17.990> need

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.110 
now this step is very important you need

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:19.450 
now this step is very important you need
to<00:01:18.140> make<00:01:18.380> sure<00:01:18.409> you<00:01:18.770> mix<00:01:19.190> the<00:01:19.370> epoxy

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 
to make sure you mix the epoxy

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.940 
to make sure you mix the epoxy
thoroughly<00:01:20.330> you<00:01:21.110> don't<00:01:21.320> do<00:01:21.500> this<00:01:21.650> you'll<00:01:21.860> get

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
thoroughly you don't do this you'll get

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:23.920 
thoroughly you don't do this you'll get
a<00:01:22.010> lot<00:01:22.159> of<00:01:22.340> hot<00:01:22.520> spots<00:01:22.940> or<00:01:23.210> spots<00:01:23.540> that<00:01:23.750> won't

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:23.930 
a lot of hot spots or spots that won't

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.890 
a lot of hot spots or spots that won't
set<00:01:24.290> up<00:01:24.409> in<00:01:24.590> the<00:01:24.710> epoxy<00:01:25.250> so<00:01:25.880> mix<00:01:26.150> it<00:01:26.300> for<00:01:26.540> a<00:01:26.570> good

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:26.900 
set up in the epoxy so mix it for a good

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:44.410 
set up in the epoxy so mix it for a good
minute<00:01:27.380> possibly<00:01:28.040> two<00:01:28.220> minutes<00:01:28.580> or<00:01:28.729> more

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.149 

next<00:01:45.200> we're<00:01:45.320> going<00:01:45.440> to<00:01:45.500> spread<00:01:45.740> our<00:01:45.890> epoxy

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:46.159 
next we're going to spread our epoxy

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:49.090 
next we're going to spread our epoxy
across<00:01:46.670> the<00:01:46.850> piece<00:01:47.260> making<00:01:48.260> sure<00:01:48.500> we<00:01:48.740> spread

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
across the piece making sure we spread

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.490 
across the piece making sure we spread
it<00:01:49.220> evenly<00:01:49.460> or<00:01:50.300> as<00:01:50.510> evenly<00:01:50.810> as<00:01:50.930> we<00:01:51.050> possibly

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
it evenly or as evenly as we possibly

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:52.060 
it evenly or as evenly as we possibly
can

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
can

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.700 
can
once<00:01:52.729> it's<00:01:52.940> spread<00:01:53.270> out<00:01:53.300> take<00:01:54.110> your<00:01:54.140> second

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
once it's spread out take your second

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:57.460 
once it's spread out take your second
lamination<00:01:55.310> piece<00:01:55.720> gently<00:01:56.720> flip<00:01:56.990> it<00:01:57.110> over<00:01:57.229> the

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:57.470 
lamination piece gently flip it over the

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:59.590 
lamination piece gently flip it over the
top<00:01:57.680> and<00:01:57.890> then<00:01:58.550> what<00:01:58.640> I<00:01:58.670> like<00:01:58.880> to<00:01:59.030> do<00:01:59.180> is<00:01:59.330> move

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
top and then what I like to do is move

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.060 
top and then what I like to do is move
it<00:01:59.750> back<00:01:59.990> and<00:02:00.229> forth<00:02:00.500> and<00:02:00.710> this<00:02:00.830> make<00:02:01.040> sure

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
it back and forth and this make sure

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.190 
it back and forth and this make sure
that<00:02:01.460> the<00:02:01.670> epoxy<00:02:02.240> is<00:02:02.330> spread<00:02:02.600> evenly<00:02:02.750> across

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
that the epoxy is spread evenly across

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.010 
that the epoxy is spread evenly across
both<00:02:03.590> surfaces<00:02:04.450> next<00:02:05.450> we're<00:02:05.570> going<00:02:05.660> to<00:02:05.720> clamp

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
both surfaces next we're going to clamp

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.230 
both surfaces next we're going to clamp
it<00:02:06.140> nice<00:02:06.350> and<00:02:06.380> tight<00:02:06.740> and<00:02:06.979> again<00:02:07.909> we<00:02:08.030> want<00:02:08.209> to

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:08.240 
it nice and tight and again we want to

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.940 
it nice and tight and again we want to
make<00:02:08.390> sure<00:02:08.420> this<00:02:08.810> is<00:02:08.929> even<00:02:09.050> so<00:02:09.530> we're<00:02:09.679> going<00:02:09.830> to

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
make sure this is even so we're going to

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:11.560 
make sure this is even so we're going to
take<00:02:10.100> our<00:02:10.280> clamps<00:02:10.670> and<00:02:10.820> space<00:02:11.060> them<00:02:11.270> about<00:02:11.450> a

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:11.570 
take our clamps and space them about a

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:14.380 
take our clamps and space them about a
foot<00:02:11.900> or<00:02:12.020> even<00:02:12.200> closer<00:02:13.160> this<00:02:13.850> will<00:02:14.030> give<00:02:14.180> us<00:02:14.239> a

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
foot or even closer this will give us a

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.900 
foot or even closer this will give us a
nice<00:02:14.660> tight<00:02:15.080> lamination<00:02:15.770> and<00:02:15.950> then<00:02:16.640> we'll<00:02:16.790> let

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
nice tight lamination and then we'll let

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:26.530 
nice tight lamination and then we'll let
this<00:02:17.090> sit<00:02:17.390> overnight<00:02:17.720> to<00:02:18.170> dry<00:02:25.000> okay<00:02:26.000> we<00:02:26.390> have

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
this sit overnight to dry okay we have

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.060 
this sit overnight to dry okay we have
an<00:02:26.690> upper<00:02:26.989> bar<00:02:27.170> top<00:02:27.470> that's<00:02:27.680> going<00:02:27.860> to<00:02:27.950> get<00:02:28.040> a

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.070 
an upper bar top that's going to get a

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:29.920 
an upper bar top that's going to get a
very<00:02:28.310> interesting<00:02:28.670> deck<00:02:29.060> and<00:02:29.360> edge<00:02:29.600> is<00:02:29.780> called

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
very interesting deck and edge is called

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:31.990 
very interesting deck and edge is called
a<00:02:30.110> chisel<00:02:30.560> bed<00:02:30.739> what<00:02:31.040> a<00:02:31.070> chiseled<00:02:31.519> edge<00:02:31.610> is<00:02:31.850> is

a chisel bed what a chiseled edge is is

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.360 
a chisel bed what a chiseled edge is is
a<00:02:32.030> very<00:02:32.269> rough<00:02:32.630> rustic<00:02:33.410> looking<00:02:33.860> type<00:02:34.100> of<00:02:34.250> an

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
a very rough rustic looking type of an

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.790 
a very rough rustic looking type of an
edge<00:02:34.519> so<00:02:35.269> what<00:02:35.450> we're<00:02:35.570> going<00:02:35.720> to<00:02:35.810> do<00:02:35.989> is<00:02:36.320> we

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
edge so what we're going to do is we

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.890 
edge so what we're going to do is we
place<00:02:37.310> this<00:02:37.580> piece<00:02:37.820> of<00:02:38.000> angle<00:02:38.209> iron<00:02:38.510> here

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
place this piece of angle iron here

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.420 
place this piece of angle iron here
which<00:02:39.019> is<00:02:39.170> going<00:02:39.380> to<00:02:39.500> serve<00:02:39.680> as<00:02:39.830> a<00:02:39.860> guide<00:02:40.130> for

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
which is going to serve as a guide for

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.759 
which is going to serve as a guide for
us<00:02:40.610> we've<00:02:40.910> clamped<00:02:41.239> it<00:02:41.480> down<00:02:41.690> now<00:02:42.290> we<00:02:42.350> have<00:02:42.590> two

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:42.769 
us we've clamped it down now we have two

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:44.500 
us we've clamped it down now we have two
pieces<00:02:43.010> that<00:02:43.400> come<00:02:43.610> together<00:02:43.760> at<00:02:44.150> the<00:02:44.269> scene

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
pieces that come together at the scene

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.540 
pieces that come together at the scene
and<00:02:44.870> that's<00:02:45.260> why<00:02:45.410> we<00:02:45.560> use<00:02:45.769> these<00:02:45.920> suction<00:02:46.220> cups

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
and that's why we use these suction cups

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:47.800 
and that's why we use these suction cups
here<00:02:46.730> in<00:02:46.850> order<00:02:47.000> to<00:02:47.090> hold<00:02:47.239> that<00:02:47.360> student

sharp blades here and you'll see in a

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:57.580 
sharp blades here and you'll see in a
minute<00:02:56.180> how<00:02:56.360> this<00:02:56.630> works<00:02:56.870> will<00:02:57.110> actually<00:02:57.440> go

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
minute how this works will actually go

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:59.770 
minute how this works will actually go
in<00:02:57.799> and<00:02:58.070> chisel<00:02:58.760> off<00:02:58.880> that<00:02:59.120> edge<00:02:59.269> now<00:02:59.480> it<00:02:59.600> was<00:02:59.720> a

really nice rustic edge so so let's see
how<00:03:02.329> it's<00:03:02.480> not<00:03:04.299> when<00:03:05.299> using<00:03:05.510> the<00:03:05.750> chiseling

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
how it's not when using the chiseling

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:08.530 
how it's not when using the chiseling
tool<00:03:06.380> make<00:03:06.680> sure<00:03:06.709> you<00:03:07.010> have<00:03:07.220> two<00:03:07.459> people<00:03:07.700> one

way we do that is with an eyelet brick

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:42.060 
way we do that is with an eyelet brick
wire<00:03:39.790> brush<00:03:40.240> this<00:03:40.810> happened<00:03:41.080> to<00:03:41.140> be<00:03:41.230> a<00:03:41.260> 36<00:03:41.620> grit

let's get started

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:48.120 
let's get started
when<00:03:46.270> using<00:03:46.480> the<00:03:46.690> brush<00:03:46.930> just<00:03:47.230> mild<00:03:47.710> light

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:48.130 
when using the brush just mild light

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:50.370

pressure<00:03:48.460> keep<00:03:49.450> your<00:03:49.570> fingers<00:03:49.900> away<00:03:49.960> from<00:03:50.170> the

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:50.380 
pressure keep your fingers away from the

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:51.870 
pressure keep your fingers away from the
brush<00:03:50.590> because<00:03:50.890> it'll<00:03:51.100> cut<00:03:51.250> your<00:03:51.400> fingers<00:03:51.730> off

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:53.380 
and just continue to work the machine

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:55.170 
and just continue to work the machine
back<00:03:53.890> and<00:03:54.100> forth<00:03:54.310> until<00:03:54.550> you've<00:03:54.760> smooth<00:03:55.030> the
