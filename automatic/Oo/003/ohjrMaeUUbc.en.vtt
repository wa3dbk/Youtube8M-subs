00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 
LCD display as you can see here this is

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.060 
LCD display as you can see here this is
a<00:04:03.790> pretty<00:04:04.299> decently<00:04:04.780> wide-angle<00:04:05.320> lens<00:04:05.530> since

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:06.070 
a pretty decently wide-angle lens since

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:07.710 
a pretty decently wide-angle lens since
how<00:04:06.280> that<00:04:06.489> wall<00:04:06.700> is<00:04:06.850> only<00:04:07.000> about<00:04:07.180> a<00:04:07.299> foot<00:04:07.600> away

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:07.720 
how that wall is only about a foot away

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:08.910 
how that wall is only about a foot away
from<00:04:07.989> me<00:04:08.110> and<00:04:08.200> I<00:04:08.230> definitely<00:04:08.380> looks<00:04:08.680> like<00:04:08.769> it's

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:08.920 
from me and I definitely looks like it's

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.340 
from me and I definitely looks like it's
considerably<00:04:09.519> farther<00:04:09.850> away<00:04:10.120> than<00:04:10.390> that<00:04:10.630> so

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:11.350 
considerably farther away than that so

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:13.050 
considerably farther away than that so
let's<00:04:11.470> go<00:04:11.560> ahead<00:04:11.590> and<00:04:11.709> put<00:04:11.920> the<00:04:12.040> lens<00:04:12.310> cap<00:04:12.489> back

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:13.060 
let's go ahead and put the lens cap back

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.170 
let's go ahead and put the lens cap back
on<00:04:13.090> this<00:04:13.480> beast<00:04:13.900> and<00:04:14.260> end<00:04:14.680> this<00:04:15.040> unboxing<00:04:15.730> so

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
on this beast and end this unboxing so

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:17.280 
on this beast and end this unboxing so
that<00:04:16.269> pretty<00:04:16.359> much<00:04:16.479> does<00:04:16.720> it<00:04:16.780> goes<00:04:16.989> for<00:04:17.200> the

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:17.290
