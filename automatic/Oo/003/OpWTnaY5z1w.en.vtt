00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
know that because of my age would it be

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.100 
know that because of my age would it be
worth<00:00:38.739> going<00:00:39.070> through<00:00:39.280> whatever<00:00:39.730> it<00:00:40.030> you<00:00:40.930> know

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:41.110 
worth going through whatever it you know

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:43.260 
worth going through whatever it you know
whatever<00:00:41.590> process<00:00:42.100> I<00:00:42.220> had<00:00:42.430> to<00:00:42.520> go<00:00:42.700> through<00:00:43.030> and

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:43.270 
whatever process I had to go through and

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:46.590 
whatever process I had to go through and
would<00:00:44.050> it<00:00:44.170> take<00:00:44.379> longer<00:00:44.710> for<00:00:44.860> me<00:00:45.250> being<00:00:46.180> that<00:00:46.570> I

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:46.600 
would it take longer for me being that I

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.430 
would it take longer for me being that I
am<00:00:46.840> over<00:00:47.170> age<00:00:47.350> 40<00:00:47.739> I<00:00:48.190> am<00:00:49.180> 45<00:00:49.720> years<00:00:49.780> old<00:00:50.199> and

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:50.440 
am over age 40 I am 45 years old and

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.950 
am over age 40 I am 45 years old and
when<00:00:50.739> I<00:00:50.770> started<00:00:51.220> my<00:00:51.400> hair<00:00:51.670> journey<00:00:51.940> I<00:00:52.269> looked

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:52.960 
when I started my hair journey I looked

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.630 
when I started my hair journey I looked
at<00:00:53.080> the<00:00:53.199> videos<00:00:53.559> but<00:00:53.830> I<00:00:54.010> noticed<00:00:54.400> that<00:00:54.519> a<00:00:54.550> lot

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:54.640 
at the videos but I noticed that a lot

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.930 
at the videos but I noticed that a lot
of<00:00:54.820> girls<00:00:55.059> were<00:00:55.420> younger<00:00:55.780> and<00:00:56.339> the<00:00:57.339> hair<00:00:57.610> their

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:57.940 
of girls were younger and the hair their

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.689 
of girls were younger and the hair their
hair<00:00:57.970> looked<00:00:58.690> much<00:00:58.930> healthier<00:00:59.500> I<00:00:59.739> noticed

00:01:00.689 --> 00:01:00.699 
hair looked much healthier I noticed

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:05.040 
hair looked much healthier I noticed
that<00:01:00.879> my<00:01:01.089> hair<00:01:01.120> isn't<00:01:01.540> as<00:01:01.809> strong<00:01:02.110> as<00:01:02.170> it<00:01:04.050> was

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:05.050 
that my hair isn't as strong as it was

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:07.350 
that my hair isn't as strong as it was
when<00:01:05.080> I<00:01:05.379> was<00:01:05.590> in<00:01:05.800> my<00:01:05.979> twenties<00:01:06.400> and<00:01:06.520> in<00:01:06.760> my<00:01:06.880> 30s

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:07.360 
when I was in my twenties and in my 30s

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.160 
when I was in my twenties and in my 30s
so<00:01:07.540> being<00:01:08.409> 45<00:01:08.890> I<00:01:09.610> kind<00:01:10.570> of<00:01:10.630> had<00:01:10.810> a<00:01:10.840> little<00:01:11.049> bit

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:11.170 
so being 45 I kind of had a little bit

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.320 
so being 45 I kind of had a little bit
of<00:01:11.350> discouragement<00:01:11.830> thinking<00:01:12.549> that<00:01:12.729> maybe<00:01:12.970> it

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:13.330 
of discouragement thinking that maybe it

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.930 
of discouragement thinking that maybe it
wouldn't<00:01:13.690> grow<00:01:14.020> I<00:01:14.380> mean<00:01:14.830> or<00:01:15.010> wouldn't<00:01:15.460> grow<00:01:15.760> as

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:15.940 
wouldn't grow I mean or wouldn't grow as

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.930 
wouldn't grow I mean or wouldn't grow as
fast<00:01:15.970> like<00:01:16.510> they<00:01:16.659> were<00:01:16.720> saying<00:01:17.159> but<00:01:18.159> the<00:01:18.729> good

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:18.940 
fast like they were saying but the good

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:22.050 
fast like they were saying but the good
thing<00:01:18.970> about<00:01:19.210> it<00:01:19.570> is<00:01:19.690> I<00:01:19.720> documented<00:01:20.560> my<00:01:21.060> you

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.060
