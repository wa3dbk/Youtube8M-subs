the day later

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.359 
the day later
it's<00:01:17.910> the<00:01:18.509> Kydex<00:01:18.899> construction<00:01:19.680> on<00:01:19.890> this<00:01:20.160> is

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
it's the Kydex construction on this is

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.960 
it's the Kydex construction on this is
pretty<00:01:21.470> pretty<00:01:22.470> impressive<00:01:22.920> they<00:01:23.640> actually

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
pretty pretty impressive they actually

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.170 
pretty pretty impressive they actually
use<00:01:24.240> a<00:01:24.510> about<00:01:24.930> a<00:01:25.110> I<00:01:25.440> think<00:01:25.590> it's<00:01:25.680> an<00:01:25.770> 800<00:01:26.760> 7<00:01:27.060> inch

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
use a about a I think it's an 800 7 inch

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.460 
use a about a I think it's an 800 7 inch
thick<00:01:27.450> Kydex<00:01:28.610> typical<00:01:29.610> kayaks<00:01:30.360> and<00:01:30.690> most<00:01:31.380> of

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
thick Kydex typical kayaks and most of

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.109 
thick Kydex typical kayaks and most of
the<00:01:31.530> other<00:01:31.710> holsters<00:01:32.100> are<00:01:32.250> you<00:01:32.310> think<00:01:32.880> six

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
the other holsters are you think six

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.850 
the other holsters are you think six
hundredths<00:01:33.510> of<00:01:33.570> an<00:01:33.690> inch<00:01:33.780> so<00:01:34.229> you<00:01:34.619> know<00:01:34.680> even

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
hundredths of an inch so you know even

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.310 
hundredths of an inch so you know even
though<00:01:35.070> it<00:01:35.250> is<00:01:35.460> actually<00:01:36.450> a<00:01:36.720> little<00:01:37.200> bit

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
though it is actually a little bit

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.260 
though it is actually a little bit
thicker<00:01:37.680> than<00:01:38.040> some<00:01:38.670> of<00:01:38.760> the<00:01:38.850> other<00:01:39.000> brands

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
thicker than some of the other brands

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.230 
thicker than some of the other brands
it's<00:01:39.900> still<00:01:40.350> able<00:01:40.590> to<00:01:40.799> be<00:01:41.340> form-fitted<00:01:42.090> or<00:01:42.180> you

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
it's still able to be form-fitted or you

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.030 
it's still able to be form-fitted or you
can<00:01:42.420> reshape<00:01:42.600> it<00:01:42.990> if<00:01:43.080> you<00:01:43.170> if<00:01:43.320> need<00:01:43.590> be<00:01:43.619> you

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
can reshape it if you if need be you

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.010 
can reshape it if you if need be you
know<00:01:44.970> if<00:01:45.030> you<00:01:45.090> want<00:01:45.240> to<00:01:45.299> heat<00:01:45.479> this<00:01:45.630> thing<00:01:45.869> up

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
know if you want to heat this thing up

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.990 
know if you want to heat this thing up
and<00:01:46.140> you<00:01:46.200> can<00:01:46.590> actually<00:01:46.740> still<00:01:47.460> reshape<00:01:47.850> but

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
and you can actually still reshape but

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.460 
and you can actually still reshape but
it's<00:01:48.119> not<00:01:48.270> going<00:01:48.450> Meganium<00:01:48.900> possibly<00:01:49.380> even

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
it's not going Meganium possibly even

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.250 
it's not going Meganium possibly even
have<00:01:49.619> to<00:01:49.710> go<00:01:49.799> buy<00:01:49.920> a<00:01:49.950> new<00:01:50.040> one<00:01:50.810> so<00:01:51.810> this<00:01:51.960> here<00:01:52.170> it

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:52.260 
have to go buy a new one so this here it

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:53.899 
have to go buy a new one so this here it
was<00:01:52.380> actually<00:01:52.680> one<00:01:52.799> of<00:01:52.830> their<00:01:53.159> outside<00:01:53.790> the
