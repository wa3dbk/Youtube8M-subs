00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:30.640 
that the stock Springs the remove you

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.280 
that the stock Springs the remove you
can<00:03:30.760> install<00:03:31.000> your<00:03:31.180> new<00:03:31.209> Springs<00:03:31.660> along<00:03:31.810> with

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
can install your new Springs along with

the bump stops and the new dust boot in

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.290 
the bump stops and the new dust boot in
the<00:03:34.780> rear<00:03:35.260> and<00:03:35.650> then<00:03:36.489> you<00:03:36.700> should<00:03:36.940> be<00:03:37.060> able<00:03:37.150> to

hats<00:03:40.750> I'm<00:03:41.650> gonna<00:03:41.799> make<00:03:41.980> sure<00:03:42.190> the<00:03:42.670> spring<00:03:43.000> is

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
hats I'm gonna make sure the spring is

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:46.160 
hats I'm gonna make sure the spring is
seated<00:03:43.690> correctly

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.540 

and<00:03:47.170> then<00:03:47.260> we<00:03:47.470> can<00:03:47.650> get<00:03:47.770> these<00:03:47.860> reinstalled<00:03:48.430> on

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:48.550 
and then we can get these reinstalled on

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:53.970 
and then we can get these reinstalled on
the<00:03:48.640> car<00:03:51.660> for<00:03:52.660> the<00:03:52.750> rears<00:03:52.960> you<00:03:53.230> want<00:03:53.410> to<00:03:53.500> make

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:53.980 
the car for the rears you want to make

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.630 
the car for the rears you want to make
sure<00:03:54.280> that<00:03:54.760> the<00:03:55.090> orientation<00:03:55.270> is<00:03:55.930> correct

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
sure that the orientation is correct

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.680 
sure that the orientation is correct
since<00:03:57.640> once<00:03:57.940> you<00:03:58.030> tighten<00:03:58.240> it<00:03:58.360> down<00:03:58.540> you're

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:58.690 
since once you tighten it down you're

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:00.390 
since once you tighten it down you're
not<00:03:58.780> gonna<00:03:58.930> be<00:03:59.020> able<00:03:59.080> to<00:03:59.200> move<00:03:59.290> the<00:03:59.440> top<00:03:59.650> so

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
not gonna be able to move the top so

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:05.190 
not gonna be able to move the top so
just<00:04:02.310> make<00:04:03.310> sure<00:04:03.340> it<00:04:03.640> lines<00:04:03.760> up<00:04:04.000> correctly<00:04:04.200> so

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.200 
just make sure it lines up correctly so

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.600 
just make sure it lines up correctly so
that<00:04:05.230> I<00:04:05.380> could<00:04:05.530> get<00:04:05.620> so<00:04:06.100> that<00:04:06.220> it<00:04:06.340> can<00:04:06.459> go<00:04:06.580> back

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:06.610 
that I could get so that it can go back

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:09.480 
that I could get so that it can go back
into<00:04:06.970> its<00:04:07.240> place<00:04:08.070> once<00:04:09.070> you<00:04:09.160> get<00:04:09.340> your<00:04:09.459> new

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:09.490 
into its place once you get your new

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:11.400 
into its place once you get your new
Springs<00:04:09.880> installed<00:04:10.360> on<00:04:10.480> your<00:04:10.600> shocks<00:04:10.840> you<00:04:11.260> can

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:11.410 
Springs installed on your shocks you can

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:13.230 
Springs installed on your shocks you can
reinstall<00:04:11.740> everything<00:04:12.160> on<00:04:12.310> the<00:04:12.459> car<00:04:12.640> and<00:04:12.820> go
