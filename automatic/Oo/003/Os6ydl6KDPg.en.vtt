hey<00:02:46.260> guys<00:02:46.440> like<00:02:46.650> I<00:02:46.740> said<00:02:46.950> I<00:02:46.980> use<00:02:47.250> the<00:02:47.460> water

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
hey guys like I said I use the water

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.790 
hey guys like I said I use the water
crystals<00:02:48.330> so<00:02:48.600> we<00:02:49.110> want<00:02:49.260> to<00:02:49.320> know<00:02:49.380> how<00:02:49.470> to<00:02:49.560> make

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
crystals so we want to know how to make

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.640 
crystals so we want to know how to make
those<00:02:50.040> or<00:02:50.690> where<00:02:51.690> to<00:02:51.780> give<00:02:51.930> them<00:02:52.080> check<00:02:52.380> out<00:02:52.470> my

those or where to give them check out my
how<00:02:53.190> to<00:02:53.250> make<00:02:53.490> water<00:02:53.700> crystals<00:02:54.150> video<00:02:54.390> and<00:02:54.930> I

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
how to make water crystals video and I

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.050 
how to make water crystals video and I
explained<00:02:55.500> where<00:02:55.620> I<00:02:55.650> got<00:02:55.860> them<00:02:55.980> from<00:02:56.130> and<00:02:56.430> how

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.090 
explained where I got them from and how
exactly<00:02:57.510> to<00:02:57.720> measure<00:02:57.930> water<00:02:58.260> to<00:02:58.710> the<00:02:58.800> crystals

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
exactly to measure water to the crystals

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.430 
exactly to measure water to the crystals
perfectly<00:02:59.520> so<00:02:59.760> you<00:03:00.180> get<00:03:00.360> the<00:03:00.510> most<00:03:00.660> uh<00:03:00.870> most
