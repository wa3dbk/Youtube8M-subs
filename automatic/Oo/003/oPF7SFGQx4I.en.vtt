00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.860
 they have restlessness of your nose you do not like 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.629
 your nose is true you do not like it when 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.180
 you even when you laugh it cracks 

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:20.100
 his nose is a little on the side we can 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.390
 compare it also with the photographs and 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.720
 we can see it with a small 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.279
 approach and I will do a part 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.109
 profile so they can see it 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.000
 can come a little bit so they can see their 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.580
 profile a little but strong a little 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.670

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:37.470

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.530
 we are going to lift in order that we 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:42.690

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.060
 profile and can take out the others 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.510
 we turn around please for his pelito not us 

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:49.350
 lets in truth we are seeing right now 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:52.650
 perfectly fine comparing with 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.300
 photographs also see you and 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:55.650
 let's see the big difference we're going 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.840
 to have now for disagreement that 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.840
 yeah yeah we start let's start 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:08.050
 and we have values ​​we do not go in the part 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.150
 superior and we're going to show you 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:12.430
 the end today is a little bit in the modest 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:17.250
 It feels a strange body but it is not 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:17.250
 much close your eyes please 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:31.340
 let's go to the deposit in three planes 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:34.030
 so that it lasts for us and this is 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.030
 permanent 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:41.920
 here we have already lorena we finished you 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:46.420
 I like how your nose was if I change 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:47.050
 I'm very convinced but the 5 already 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.850
 River 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:51.190
 see you now let's put the 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.260
 profile can check how it changed 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:56.140
 We can totally to view their profile 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:59.200
 it looks good there we are already checking together 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:01.000
 with the photographs we are seeing it and 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.920
 they already have all the same in the part of 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.250
 sinking as its tip changed us 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:08.410

 that in a month we will do the review 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.630
 sometimes it absorbs a little bit and if it is 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.980
 necessary we put a small touch-up and 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.690
 What's left is going to last us all 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:30.150
 life is the advantage of agreement that 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:30.150
