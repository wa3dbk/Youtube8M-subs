00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.979 
the medium EDC category now there are
people<00:02:22.739> that<00:02:23.040> prefer<00:02:23.430> medium<00:02:23.819> or<00:02:24.209> large<00:02:24.360> EDC

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
people that prefer medium or large EDC

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:28.070 
people that prefer medium or large EDC
blades<00:02:25.349> and<00:02:25.730> I<00:02:26.730> tend<00:02:27.120> to<00:02:27.180> prefer<00:02:27.420> the<00:02:27.750> smaller

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
blades and I tend to prefer the smaller

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.640 
blades and I tend to prefer the smaller
ones<00:02:28.410> because<00:02:28.620> they<00:02:29.010> tend<00:02:29.280> to<00:02:30.530> disappear<00:02:31.530> in

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
ones because they tend to disappear in

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.199 
ones because they tend to disappear in
your<00:02:31.769> pocket<00:02:32.190> and<00:02:32.310> you<00:02:32.640> don't<00:02:32.849> even<00:02:33.000> notice
