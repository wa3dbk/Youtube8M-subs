00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060
 hello everyone knows gatien I hope 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:04.319
 that you are well we end up 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:04.859
 today for a new video 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:07.529
 commentary 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.910
 so I will quickly put the gameplay 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.320
 quickly set the scene since I 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.630
 do not discuss it during this one 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.429
 we are a mmo on stand off at the ballista 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.350
 silent I chose you this gameplay 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.150
 because the station is not happening 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.680
 always easy to do good 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.090
 parties with a roof his apartment where 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.220
 you put a silencer on a sniper 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.230
 to be a little suicidal we are not going 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.609
 to fool myself so I think it's a 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.380
 very interesting gameplay so I hope 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.150
 that you will like knowing that there are three 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.679
 so small clips of pitcher in the 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.800
 first you just saw at 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.600
 the moment so I think I would have 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.250
 maybe not long enough of this gameplay 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.270
 to tell you a little bit of everything 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.469
 I have to tell you during this video at 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.020
 worse I would add 1 but I can not 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.969
 know what it is when I 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.950
 order this one so first of all I 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.600
 want to tell you that I thank the 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.680
 complicated people and who are in the process of 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.090
 watch this video is to listen to this 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.320
 that I am telling you you will understand 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.199
 Why 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.460
 in the following of this little gameplay so 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.879
 the main purpose of this video 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.070
 commentary 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.890
 I think you noticed there are some 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.030
 has many who have left messages 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.920
 on youtube and twitter to tell me that 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.260
 it was completely inactive 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.670
 listen we're going to go we're not going to see each other 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.750
 not turn around the bush I have more the 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.860
 motivation to make videos 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.299
 commented as it might have been 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.280
 case when I created my channel 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.750
 so to know that my channel la2 years 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.600
 she had two in september 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.270
 so for two years finally for a year 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.130
 and a half I really like 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.659
 steadily post regularly 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.250
 videos there was hardly a 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:26.600
 per week for a year it was that 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.329
 it was one a week and I was very 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.520
 glad to do so 

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:32.780
 so here I have it said that in 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.280
 terms of tahri commands i have when 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.569
 even a lot is given a lot 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.670
 today I think that at average 

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:38.539
 to innovate more means of having 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:39.920
 interesting things to say in the 

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:43.640
 commented gameplay so I have more the 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:46.939
 hellish motivation which brings me to you 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:50.119
 to say that I definitely stop 

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:53.030
 commented gameplay I continue all this 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:55.119
 which is that they empty but I quit 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.950
 definitely commented gameplay 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:02:00.649
 so a new one by bringing another 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.759
 the first one so the fact that I quit 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:02.989
 the commented gameplay brings me everything 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:04.189
 just to give you the second 

00:02:02.989 --> 00:02:08.509
 new wholesale I 'm going to recreate a 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:10.399
 Chain and post as fidh gameplay 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:13.819
 so that montages that 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:15.739
 episodes that left over to be going 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:16.790
 maybe once every 6 months what 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:18.500
 if I'm motivated on a video 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.610
 commented on snipe scope like the one 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.379
 but i mean that's really going to be 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:24.050
 very rare so I wanted to make you 

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:25.580
 this video to explain that 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.660
 I wanted to thank the people who have 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.750
 clicked simply because 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:32.960
 in title I'm not going to m goodbye end my 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.560
 chain the end lease with a point a 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:36.620
 sad music 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.240
 no i do not want to have subscribers 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.380
 of assets on the new channel since 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.580
 good you will have noticed I have three 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.650
 thousand subscribers on this one I have about 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:45.950
 150 people who are really active 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.210
 so I do not want to find myself 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.440
 inactive people on the new embarrassment I 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:50.240
 can do to see without starting to see 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.000
 without this tiff bin that to have three thousand 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:54.830
 sober and 1% that he is active among these 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.120
 3000 that's why I did not put title 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:57.530
 evocative I do not encourage people to 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.880
 click on this video it does not matter 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.310
 if my subscribers are not aware 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.180
 that I'm redoing a chain just 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.080
 because if they are not aware 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.310
 that means they did not look 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.150
 this video is ci have not watched 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.460
 this video simply means 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:09.320
 that they are not necessarily active therefore 

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:11.510
 that is why I will thank 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.980
 complicate on this video since I 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:14.840
 know that it's people who love 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.850
 hear about who like to watch my 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.530
 videos and it makes me super happy because 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:19.550
 that it's really for to give you 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.660
 pleasure that I put myself in 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:22.430
 make commented videos and that's 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:25.670
 also for my own pleasure that I 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:27.530
 have done during these two years so 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:28.550

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:16.900

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:18.340
 so my editing it's called operate 

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:20.530

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:21.550
 not discover of 1 sat and long as 

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:23.080
 disco project bordeaux but he 

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:24.670
 will be called operate I've already had you 

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:26.830
 more than one trailer I would like to thank 

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:29.050
 the people who have it secular and it's very 

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:30.670
 important to me who have the title but 

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:32.350
 video for two years by the way 

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:34.480
 only the trailer the montage so 

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:35.980
 operated and will be released on October 25 on my 

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:37.150
 new channel i would put you links 

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:37.990
 of the chain in the description of 

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:39.760

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:41.710
 please go subscribe that 

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:43.900
 if you are active because 

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:45.190
 I can not afford to finally I 

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:47.620
 do not know I can obviously afford 

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:48.850
 but it's a bit frustrating when you 

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:51.640
 have a number of subscribers that 

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:54.010
 you make 5 10% of view it's a small 

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:55.000
 little frustrating so no one will you 

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:57.340
 force to subscribe to my new 

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.260
 string so does it only if you 

00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:01.030
 enjoy my content 

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:03.400
 and if you just want 

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:08.110
 continue between kim and the adventure he 

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:09.340
 only aims at my side so I 

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:10.870
 think I told you everything my 

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:14.740
 editing which coming out soon I count 

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:18.150

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:20.680
 about the turn I'll stop there 

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:21.580
 I do not want to say that I am moved but that 

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:23.080
 makes me a little something to know 

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:24.910
 that this last video commented that 

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:26.470
