00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.820
 Well you have 60 of legionnaires 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:52.830
 captain danjou's company with 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.170
 three officers who will resist 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:56.820
 for a whole day in a 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.220
 hacienda in a kind of big 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.130
 cities the facade a thousand mexican's 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:04.050

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:06.720
 of this day of fighting it will remain 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:08.220
 five survivors who will charge because 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.740
 that they no longer have ammunition that 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.210
 will all be hurt and captured by the 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.420
 Mexicans who will pay them the honors 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.550
 and so it's for the foreign legion 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:19.200
 foreign legion really cameron a 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:22.320
 major event that is celebrated all 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.880
 years including the release of the 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.700
 Captain danjou's hand that was 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.840
 found some time after the 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.880
 fighting since captain danjou 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.160
 had been amputated with one hand and had a 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.590
 articulated wooden hand and it is this 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.840
 wooden hand of captain danjou who is 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.810
 a true relic for the legion 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.830
 foreign is presented every year during 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.840
 cameroon party 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:44.340
 this is April 30th which has become the party 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.010
 traditional foreign legion 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:50.130
 a fight that remained as the symbol 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:51.600
 fidelity to the word given and 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:56.130
 and especially a mission 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:58.110
 fulfilled at all costs honor and loyalty 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:02.390
 this is the goal of the legion 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:06.330
 foreign which is located in aubagne 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:08.100
 so here are the pioneers with the apron 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:11.880
 to pioneer the ax 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:14.850
 it is also the memory of the Romans 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:17.459
 here we see this apron which is there 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.860
 an apron of traditional parades 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:22.440
 which made it possible to protect 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.569
 wood chips splinters of wood when 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:27.480
 it was necessary for the ax to fell trees 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:30.019
 to build pontoons to make 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.880
 pass the cavalry to pass 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:35.220
 the supply trolleys so 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.980
 the leg is this symbolic of the legion 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.730
 foreign beard wearing and around 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.010
 size 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.959
 not for the pioneers but for the 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.989
 legionnaires we will perceive behind 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:49.400
 so a blue belt that is worn 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:49.400
 under the belt 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.069
 as they say a little vulgarly husband 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:56.530
 they have mouth in his light 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:57.940
 it's a bit trivial family his 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.750
 familiar these military they have of 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.890
 the jaws and his standards between is true to 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:05.000
 present all the trades of the 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:06.740
 building 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.810
 yes it is very striking when you 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:11.270
 go into external operations in a 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:13.220
 area is legionaries you 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:16.250
 find the construction of a camp 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:18.710
 Roman squared is extremely 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.570
 organized is really this unit 

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:22.400
 prestigious whose general 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:24.950
 saint-chamas who is the father of the 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.910
 legion can be extremely proud we have 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.530
 crossed just now on the fields 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:29.270
 elysÃ©es here before leaving his 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:31.250
 cards and you will be able to see that 

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:33.650
 unlike other units do not 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.510
 not separate the legionaries it takes 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:36.860
 still remember that it's thirty 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:38.710
 six thousand foreigners who gave their 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:42.030
 life for France 

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:42.030
 from 1830 hernia
