00:00:00.819 --> 00:00:04.270
 the most massive public transport 

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:07.160
 Russia 

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:09.620
 according to statistics daily he 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.960
 transports up and down 3 times more 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:14.720
 passengers than all other types 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:18.730
 transport combined at the base 

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:20.180
 passenger lift 12 knots 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.280
 equipment supplied 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:27.650
 box manufacturer and 

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:32.410
 transport packages and mounts this 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:32.410
 the machine would directly lift the mine 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:39.160
 but to understand what it consists of 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.990
 lift mechanism to study it better on 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:44.320
 elevator display stand 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:47.190
 construction plant for cab assembly 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:50.890
 22 metal parts required 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:53.650
 sheet thickness one and a half millimeter he 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:56.739
 covered with powder enamel unlike 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:59.560
 ordinary liquid paint it better protects 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:02.080
 against corrosion and vandals one of the most 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:05.620
 important cabin elements automatic 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:08.320
 a door that's how it is in motion 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:10.810
 sash when a button is pressed 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:14.650
 electric signal goes to the switch 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:18.420
 from him to a special drive from the drive 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:21.280
 50 watt electric motor 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.710
 working motor through the shaft and their drives 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:27.220
 transmits rotation to the so-called 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:31.119
 crank he whose hinge is connected to 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:33.490
 connecting rod about that with the carriage the rod moves 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:37.060
 left carriage with door leaf 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:39.660
 she 's leading and driven right 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:43.370
 leaf opens or closes 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:45.590
 thanks to the cable at the synchronizer 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:50.120
 in turn the cabin doors lead into 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:52.940
 movement of the drive shaft door is auto 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:54.430
 reverse device that does not give the door 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:57.320
 pinch us pass 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:59.510
 auto reverse starts after a few 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:03.260
 seconds after lift sash 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:05.960
 stumble upon a slow passenger in 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:08.380
 some elevators the door is sliding even 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.790
 not having time to touch a person or cargo 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.300
 In this case, the light is triggered. 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:14.600
 barrier 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:17.690
 it is installed along the doors if on the way 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:20.540
 the beam encounters an obstacle mechanism 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.890
 gets a signal to open the door it 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.890
 additional option 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:27.400
 because of her lift buyer pays extra 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.780
 about 80 dollars 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.940
 upper and lower cab parts 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.730
 guide pads installed 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:37.010
 slip they stabilize the position 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:39.740
 the cabin in the mine and perform the function 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:42.050
 shock absorber i.e. absorbs shocks 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:46.760
 when driving on guides and at the same time 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:49.260
 lubricates their guides this 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.709
 sort of rails on which the cabin moves 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.480
 they are mounted on its outside and 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:57.989
 directly in the elevator shaft on them as 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.250
 moves and counterbalance it twice 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:03.420
 heavier than a cabin 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:05.670
 thanks to a special concrete block on 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:08.250
 one of the cab guides installed 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:10.819
 speed limiter it works 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:14.549
 if the elevator overcomes the 1st floor faster 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:16.640
 0.18 seconds is the maximum allowed 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:16.640
 speed 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:22.060
 catchers are the main organs 

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:25.090
 security 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:27.280
 they are attached to the bottom of the cabin and enters 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.870
 action if the speed far exceeds 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.920
 rate 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:35.140
 such a case the ropes break 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:37.659
 cockpit and counterweight sets in motion 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:39.579
 such a frame with a winch and and 

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:42.069
 installs in the engine room 

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:45.879
 which is located at the top 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:49.720
 floor apartment building parts of this 

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:53.950
 mechanism gear brake motor and 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:54.909
 canada driving pulley 600 kilograms 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:58.120
 cabin weight 

00:03:54.909 --> 00:04:00.849
 4 metal ropes required 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:03.970
 Cables provide 16 times margin 

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:06.569
 strength that is one rope can 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:10.079
 support the weight of 4 cabs 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:10.769
 and this whole structure is mounted on 

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:14.159
 stretchers 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:15.959
 it is not accidentally painted yellow this 

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:17.130
 color traditionally warns about 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:20.269
 increased danger 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:22.190
 moving parts of the mechanism 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:25.190
 the subframe is mounted rubber 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:27.470
 shock absorbers they reduce noise and vibration 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:29.860
 which arise from the movement of elevators 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:29.860
 buildings 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:36.040
 he details for the subframe frame and winch 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:38.730
 manufactures on the universal press and 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:38.730
 from steel sheet 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:45.139
 brain elevator control station and it's the same 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:48.060
 installs in the engine room 

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:49.800
 It is in these chips that the signal is given 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:52.590
 about calling the elevator 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:54.780
 they send a command to give tension in 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:59.819
 baby's electric motor and cabin 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:05:02.430
 gets under way here comes 

00:04:59.819 --> 00:05:03.240
 information on possible errors and failures in 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:05.940
 elevator operation 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:08.340
 so that the lifters in case of breakage 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:11.610
 lift do not need to look for a debt 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:13.800
 cause of failure in general elevator we 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:16.470
 accidentally considered a vehicle 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:18.870
 on manufacturing technology it is also 

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:20.039
 folded like a car and by the way not 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:23.009
 inferior to them in price 

00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:26.240
 elevator costs between fifteen and thirty 

00:05:23.009 --> 00:05:26.240
 thousand long
