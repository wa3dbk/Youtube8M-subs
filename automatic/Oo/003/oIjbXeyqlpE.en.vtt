00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.640
 cappa 

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:12.730
 this have been three concerts one in 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:14.650
 ValparaÃ­so and another one in Santiago de Chile 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:17.620
 the first two were opening for 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:19.270
 magicians and the third one that was already like the 

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:22.060
 test of fire that was we want others 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:25.540
 alone and the truth that the truth that the 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:28.450
 very very good response the room was filled 

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:30.610
 and making plans now to return 

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:32.469
 to come back very soon as well of 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:35.800
 true that we have had a reception 

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:38.290
 pretty good we have not come with much 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.539
 energy that our passage through Chile the 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:42.249
 true that it has been very well a very 

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:45.219
 good experience we have seen that the 

00:00:42.249 --> 00:00:48.309
 public has reacted very well with 

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:51.010
 we were not our concerts in 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:53.170
 yes and we are opening for but i am afraid 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.690
 but people did not know if you know the 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:58.629
 songs he sang and the truth is that 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:00.980
 I was waiting as many channels 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:03.710
 share 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:05.720
 It's great not the first one we share 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.820
 stage with them are very good friends 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:11.270
 they mostly behave with us 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:13.550
 great were they invited us in this 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.950
 case this tour by chile the truth that 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:18.530
 very well always very attentive of us 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:22.310
 what we lack there was the truth 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.990
 that's why because we as 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.570
 always in this hour we are preparing 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.430
 what the new album will be still not 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:32.509
 we have exact date of departure I know that 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:34.280
 bring more recorded May June but date 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:37.550
 of output I imagine it will be for her 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:39.350
 more end of the year but with much desire 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.660
 of entering to record what is the new 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:44.770
 disc and that people know that is 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:47.330
 waiting for it with much desire 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:51.080
 I really like the symbolism and the 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:54.440
 symbology that he has and he had it clear 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:56.510
 I wanted him to have color 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:59.560
 I submit to the time to do it I had to 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:59.560
 take for granted has 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:07.720
 I had a very good time, I remember that before 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:10.600
 do less for the first time 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:13.600
 pure life carriage in this case from the 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:16.960
 SEGOVIA especially to meet 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:18.970
 Juan and the feeling was very good with the 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:20.610
 I treat great and above all it was already the 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:26.030
 key point for 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:26.030
 for doubts where it comes from
