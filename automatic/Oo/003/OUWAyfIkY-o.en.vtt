00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
for zombies this one is a little bit

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:08.960 
for zombies this one is a little bit
more<00:00:07.770> interesting<00:00:07.980> the<00:00:08.340> previous<00:00:08.760> two<00:00:08.940> I

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
more interesting the previous two I

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:10.970 
more interesting the previous two I
didn't<00:00:09.360> even<00:00:09.450> cover<00:00:09.750> in<00:00:10.050> videos<00:00:10.440> because<00:00:10.800> they

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
didn't even cover in videos because they

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.950 
didn't even cover in videos because they
were<00:00:11.099> pretty<00:00:11.340> basic<00:00:11.639> and<00:00:12.059> I<00:00:12.450> didn't<00:00:12.780> really

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
were pretty basic and I didn't really

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.930 
were pretty basic and I didn't really
tell<00:00:13.170> us<00:00:13.200> much<00:00:13.320> at<00:00:13.650> all<00:00:13.769> however<00:00:14.490> this<00:00:14.670> one<00:00:14.910> I

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
tell us much at all however this one I

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.580 
tell us much at all however this one I
can<00:00:15.150> go<00:00:15.240> a<00:00:15.269> little<00:00:15.480> bit<00:00:15.660> more<00:00:15.780> in<00:00:15.929> depth<00:00:16.170> in<00:00:16.379> and

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
can go a little bit more in depth in and

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.650 
can go a little bit more in depth in and
I<00:00:16.859> think<00:00:17.250> I<00:00:17.430> may<00:00:17.640> have<00:00:17.670> figured<00:00:18.090> it<00:00:18.240> out<00:00:18.390> so

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
I think I may have figured it out so

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.269 
I think I may have figured it out so
i'll<00:00:18.750> show<00:00:18.930> you<00:00:18.990> guys<00:00:19.080> a<00:00:19.140> clip<00:00:19.529> now<00:00:19.680> and<00:00:19.980> I'll

i'll show you guys a clip now and I'll
get<00:00:20.460> onto<00:00:20.580> my<00:00:20.789> theory<00:00:21.210> very<00:00:21.480> soon

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.560 

so<00:00:42.370> straight<00:00:42.640> after<00:00:42.940> watching<00:00:43.120> this<00:00:43.390> I

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:43.570 
so straight after watching this I

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:45.060 
so straight after watching this I
thought<00:00:43.780> to<00:00:43.989> myself<00:00:44.140> when<00:00:44.620> do<00:00:44.739> we<00:00:44.829> hear

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:45.070 
thought to myself when do we hear

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.310 
thought to myself when do we hear
jingles<00:00:45.489> in<00:00:45.670> songs<00:00:46.030> in<00:00:46.360> zombies<00:00:46.809> now<00:00:47.230> the

jingles in songs in zombies now the

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.200 
jingles in songs in zombies now the
obvious<00:00:47.559> answer<00:00:47.950> is<00:00:48.309> when<00:00:48.670> you<00:00:48.790> stand<00:00:49.120> near

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:49.210 
obvious answer is when you stand near

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:51.299 
obvious answer is when you stand near
the<00:00:49.420> perk<00:00:49.629> machines<00:00:50.050> so<00:00:50.680> this<00:00:50.980> could<00:00:51.250> very

00:00:51.299 --> 00:00:51.309 
the perk machines so this could very

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:53.939 
the perk machines so this could very
well<00:00:51.699> be<00:00:51.989> one<00:00:52.989> of<00:00:53.079> the<00:00:53.140> jingles<00:00:53.530> for<00:00:53.680> a<00:00:53.739> new

00:00:53.939 --> 00:00:53.949

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:16.090 
be taken a number of ways but the most

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.090 
be taken a number of ways but the most
obvious<00:01:16.570> is<00:01:16.869> that<00:01:16.930> the<00:01:17.259> zombies<00:01:17.619> are<00:01:17.770> going<00:01:18.009> to

obvious is that the zombies are going to

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:19.889 
obvious is that the zombies are going to
be<00:01:18.190> faster<00:01:18.789> and<00:01:18.940> that<00:01:19.360> you're<00:01:19.509> gonna<00:01:19.660> have<00:01:19.780> to

00:01:19.889 --> 00:01:19.899 
be faster and that you're gonna have to

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:21.990

ridiculously<00:01:26.050> fast<00:01:26.350> we<00:01:26.560> haven't<00:01:26.830> seen<00:01:26.950> them

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:27.070

run that fast in call of duty before so
it<00:01:29.680> leads<00:01:29.890> me<00:01:30.130> to<00:01:30.280> think<00:01:30.490> this<00:01:31.000> is<00:01:31.179> going<00:01:31.360> to<00:01:31.450> be

00:01:31.529 --> 00:01:31.539 
it leads me to think this is going to be

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:33.660 
it leads me to think this is going to be
the<00:01:31.660> new<00:01:31.810> perk<00:01:32.080> now<00:01:32.890> the<00:01:33.009> dictionary

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:54.180 
have stamina which makes us run for
longer<00:01:52.750> durations<00:01:53.380> but<00:01:53.800> we<00:01:53.890> don't<00:01:54.130> really

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:54.190 
longer durations but we don't really

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:57.719 
longer durations but we don't really
have<00:01:54.520> a<00:01:54.550> perk<00:01:54.880> on<00:01:55.179> making<00:01:55.840> us<00:01:56.319> run<00:01:56.739> faster<00:01:57.340> so<00:01:57.550> I

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729 
have a perk on making us run faster so I

00:01:57.729 --> 00:01:59.729 
have a perk on making us run faster so I
think<00:01:58.239> this<00:01:58.360> might<00:01:58.599> be<00:01:58.840> the<00:01:59.080> actual<00:01:59.259> perk

00:01:59.729 --> 00:01:59.739 
think this might be the actual perk

00:01:59.739 --> 00:02:01.949 
think this might be the actual perk
called<00:02:00.399> waltz<00:02:00.910> or<00:02:01.060> some<00:02:01.330> other<00:02:01.509> name<00:02:01.780> that

00:02:01.949 --> 00:02:01.959 
called waltz or some other name that

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:04.320 
called waltz or some other name that
they<00:02:02.050> might<00:02:02.229> change<00:02:02.590> when<00:02:03.039> it's<00:02:03.190> released<00:02:03.580> but

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.330 
they might change when it's released but

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.150 
they might change when it's released but
there's<00:02:04.539> definitely<00:02:05.050> a<00:02:05.140> lot<00:02:05.380> of<00:02:05.560> evidence<00:02:05.950> in

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:06.160 
there's definitely a lot of evidence in

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.100 
there's definitely a lot of evidence in
favor<00:02:06.399> of<00:02:06.550> this<00:02:06.729> so<00:02:07.060> I<00:02:07.270> hope<00:02:07.420> you<00:02:07.630> guys<00:02:07.690> enjoyed
