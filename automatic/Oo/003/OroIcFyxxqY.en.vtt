 raphael that was a pleasure that I gave 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.490
 out of tune as you want to see it 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.579

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.500
 the taste the artist is me and come and that 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:07.319
 theme reflects my current state in which 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.940
 I am and nothing grew with the music of 

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:10.500
 Rafael and I took refuge in his music in my 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:14.269
 can a more difficult moment so 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.269

 this edition they bring the only one that had 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:24.120
 between quotes to revalidate was made in the 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:27.300
 previous you said that here was not finished 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.800
 nothing that was an opportunity but already with 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.420
 the snatch 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.310
 you felt in the internal that now or 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.380
 never could I do 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.310
 it's now or never now it's hurting me 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.640
 the leg 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:41.970
 and strong 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.530
 yes yes yes I said 'now or never' because 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.120
 what happens with the motto of our 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.760
 work that we are the poor relatives 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.100
 of the festival the humorists always 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.080
 they were making bets how are you going 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.970
 to go is not that the routine is repeated or 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.470
 I 'm here because I do not have 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.150
 to be called all those things and the 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.530
 family sees him then when he takes the 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.290
 decision to come to a festival is so 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:04.709
 important as it is vineyard of the sea 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:07.739
 you have children you have a lady you have parents 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:10.380
 who is brother if he failed here I the 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:14.100
 our who follows me back to go out to 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:15.510
 the street is not a joke that's why 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.820
 this work of humor must be taken 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.620
 seriously it is not a joke not to walk 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:21.989
 chacoteando all the time negotiating 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.209
 all the time he gave me the impression of 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:25.769
 that in the auctions of jokes good 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:27.570
 they were not jokes but you auction them like 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:29.610
 that were not yes but in the auctions of 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:31.860
 the routines like it came down a little bit 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:34.560
 the voice like that like it was a bit 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:36.450
 shy I was for the scribbles when 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:40.019
 a shot taken to scribbles I try 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:42.000
 to shrink it because I do not like it much 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:44.130
 employ was able to temper the 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.750
 coprolalia because I think we can 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:47.519
 laugh about simple things I do not criticize 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.350
 nobody I respect all who do 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:51.390
 different types of humor and also that 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:53.430
 I have a father who is raised with 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:55.739
 firulete then tell me not to throw 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.900
 doodle that is ugly I have a mother 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:04:00.450
 for a value thing I grew up like that 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.590
 then my mother did not want that if each 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:03.450
 Once a squiggle be treated him 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:05.519
 come down today there were also diplomatic 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:07.079
 invited then 16 to work 

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:09.060
 without work for the manager I work for 

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:10.470
 Aunt Coty for the mayor work 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.850
 active the gallery I work the call the 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:14.160
 construction work to finish so that 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:16.590
 turnip then very difficult because they are 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:19.160
 different criteria I do not know about what 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:21.110
 you talk to people 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:23.360
 so here is a lot of sense 

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:24.980
 careful and I think that's why until the 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.110
 today has kept me in these 40 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:30.080
 years with many jobs but with a lot 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:32.510
 I work in important companies of this 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:34.160
 country yes yes we do not take risks since 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:37.130
 martÃ­n because it was alvaro sala already 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:39.530
 toured well should be glad the hype 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:42.350
 I think that I earned that niche and 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:45.749
 it cost me to win it but I grabbed it and it's 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:48.249
 the niche that people 

00:04:45.749 --> 00:04:49.800
 if you like the humor that we are running 

00:04:48.249 --> 00:04:53.319
 risk to take someone who can 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:55.770
 harm let's say the event but 

00:04:53.319 --> 00:04:55.770
 extension and 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:03.400
 What happens at school? You need to go to the bathroom 

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:06.699
 not Spanish 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:10.529
 no more harm to the question now if a 

00:05:06.699 --> 00:05:12.899
 who dedicates this award to my brother 

00:05:10.529 --> 00:05:14.579
 to my brother that finally I wanted to 

00:05:12.899 --> 00:05:16.769
 that I was here that it was that 

00:05:14.579 --> 00:05:18.569
 he died and that I ended up angry with him 

00:05:16.769 --> 00:05:19.859
 and history knows everything already 

00:05:18.569 --> 00:05:22.259
 I counted many times I did not want to be 

00:05:19.859 --> 00:05:23.579
 pathetic so to my brother that in 

00:05:22.259 --> 00:05:26.099
 some place is the one that illuminated me this 

00:05:23.579 --> 00:05:27.569
 night to my family my children and me when 

00:05:26.099 --> 00:05:29.039
 he told me what is your team in a team 

00:05:27.569 --> 00:05:30.569
 it's not a team not only did 

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:33.149
 a nice nice policies not run 

00:05:30.569 --> 00:05:35.849
 some key rings and my children we put the 

00:05:33.149 --> 00:05:39.689
 bowling and come nador are my children 

00:05:35.849 --> 00:05:42.089
 they are not a team and my wife is already 40 

00:05:39.689 --> 00:05:43.439
 years of marriage so you have to 

00:05:42.089 --> 00:05:45.779
 take off your hat with her because 

00:05:43.439 --> 00:05:48.289
 hold on to me the trips and everything is not 

00:05:45.779 --> 00:05:48.289
 it is not easy
