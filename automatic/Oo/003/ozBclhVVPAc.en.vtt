a<00:06:42.229> see<00:06:42.290> at<00:06:42.530> this<00:06:42.710> game<00:06:42.979> and<00:06:43.220> I<00:06:43.310> would<00:06:43.640> have

00:06:43.719 --> 00:06:43.729 
a see at this game and I would have

00:06:43.729 --> 00:06:46.180 
a see at this game and I would have
known<00:06:44.000> if<00:06:44.570> my<00:06:45.110> opponent<00:06:45.590> didn't<00:06:45.830> leave<00:06:46.010> the

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:46.190 
known if my opponent didn't leave the

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:48.820 
known if my opponent didn't leave the
game<00:06:46.400> and<00:06:47.090> I<00:06:47.360> thought<00:06:47.630> the<00:06:47.810> game<00:06:47.960> froze<00:06:48.320> legit

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:48.830 
game and I thought the game froze legit

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:50.140 
game and I thought the game froze legit
I<00:06:48.890> thought<00:06:49.040> the<00:06:49.100> game<00:06:49.250> just<00:06:49.400> froze<00:06:49.760> because<00:06:50.060> it

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:50.150 
I thought the game just froze because it

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:52.180 
I thought the game just froze because it
was<00:06:50.270> lagging<00:06:50.510> kind<00:06:50.870> of<00:06:50.960> sorta<00:06:51.260> throughout<00:06:51.620> and

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:52.190 
was lagging kind of sorta throughout and

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:53.950 
was lagging kind of sorta throughout and
I<00:06:52.250> sensed<00:06:52.729> that<00:06:52.790> it<00:06:52.880> might<00:06:53.180> freeze<00:06:53.570> or<00:06:53.810> might

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:53.960 
I sensed that it might freeze or might

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:55.900 
I sensed that it might freeze or might
like<00:06:54.200> lag<00:06:54.470> out<00:06:54.680> towards<00:06:55.460> the<00:06:55.610> beginning<00:06:55.729> of

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:55.910 
like lag out towards the beginning of

00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:57.760 
like lag out towards the beginning of
the<00:06:56.030> game<00:06:56.240> but<00:06:56.510> it<00:06:56.690> played<00:06:56.960> flawlessly<00:06:57.350> up

00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:57.770 
the game but it played flawlessly up

00:06:57.770 --> 00:06:59.530 
the game but it played flawlessly up
until<00:06:58.010> that<00:06:58.130> point<00:06:58.190> and<00:06:58.669> the<00:06:59.120> reason<00:06:59.210> why<00:06:59.510> I

00:06:59.530 --> 00:06:59.540 
until that point and the reason why I

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:01.870 
until that point and the reason why I
think<00:06:59.660> he<00:07:00.020> quit<00:07:00.290> the<00:07:00.440> game<00:07:00.650> was<00:07:00.979> because<00:07:01.130> he

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:01.880 
think he quit the game was because he

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:04.060 
think he quit the game was because he
did<00:07:02.030> not<00:07:02.120> send<00:07:02.450> me<00:07:02.570> a<00:07:02.600> gg<00:07:03.320> message<00:07:03.770> he<00:07:03.919> and<00:07:04.040> I
