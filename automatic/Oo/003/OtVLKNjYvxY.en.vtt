been<00:01:10.700> difficult<00:01:11.210> to<00:01:11.450> get<00:01:12.020> the<00:01:12.140> current<00:01:12.409> of

00:01:12.639 --> 00:01:12.649 
been difficult to get the current of

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:15.160 
been difficult to get the current of
courage<00:01:13.039> but<00:01:13.249> the<00:01:13.490> energy<00:01:13.850> or<00:01:14.390> the<00:01:14.569> brainpower

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
courage but the energy or the brainpower

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.459 
courage but the energy or the brainpower
to<00:01:15.530> want<00:01:15.890> to<00:01:16.009> go<00:01:16.159> live

00:01:18.459 --> 00:01:18.469 

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:21.760 

so<00:01:19.310> aspartame<00:01:19.909> I've<00:01:20.630> always<00:01:20.990> connected

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
so aspartame I've always connected

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.609 
so aspartame I've always connected
aspartame<00:01:22.490> with<00:01:22.929> something<00:01:23.929> not<00:01:24.079> good<00:01:24.380> I

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:24.619 
aspartame with something not good I

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:26.410 
aspartame with something not good I
would<00:01:24.890> get<00:01:25.039> headaches<00:01:25.369> whenever<00:01:25.700> I<00:01:25.789> chew<00:01:26.149> gum

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
would get headaches whenever I chew gum

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.050 
would get headaches whenever I chew gum
with<00:01:27.170> aspartame<00:01:27.740> it<00:01:27.890> took<00:01:28.009> me<00:01:28.159> a<00:01:28.429> long<00:01:28.789> time<00:01:28.850> to

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 
with aspartame it took me a long time to

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.330 
with aspartame it took me a long time to
figure<00:01:29.359> it<00:01:29.479> out<00:01:29.770> first<00:01:30.770> thing<00:01:30.920> that<00:01:31.009> comes<00:01:31.189> to

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 
figure it out first thing that comes to

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.190
