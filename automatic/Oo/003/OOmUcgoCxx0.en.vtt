00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
Genesis controller what the issue would

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:15.049 
Genesis controller what the issue would
be<00:00:09.590> is<00:00:10.590> that<00:00:10.650> like<00:00:11.450> you<00:00:12.450> have<00:00:13.610> some<00:00:14.610> messed<00:00:14.910> up

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
be is that like you have some messed up

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:16.820 
be is that like you have some messed up
buns<00:00:15.360> or<00:00:15.630> they're<00:00:15.839> sticky<00:00:16.289> or<00:00:16.440> something<00:00:16.740> like

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
buns or they're sticky or something like

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.359 
buns or they're sticky or something like
that<00:00:17.039> or<00:00:17.640> just<00:00:18.270> they<00:00:18.359> won't<00:00:18.510> work<00:00:18.750> when<00:00:19.369> you

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
that or just they won't work when you

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:29.960 
that or just they won't work when you
put<00:00:20.490> pressure<00:00:21.090> on<00:00:21.330> it<00:00:21.510> so<00:00:23.900> first<00:00:24.900> you<00:00:25.859> do<00:00:28.939> get<00:00:29.939> a

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
put pressure on it so first you do get a

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.939 
put pressure on it so first you do get a
regular<00:00:30.510> Philips<00:00:30.900> head<00:00:31.050> screwdriver<00:00:31.320> and

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
regular Philips head screwdriver and

00:00:31.949 --> 00:01:17.889 
regular Philips head screwdriver and
just<00:00:38.210> just<00:00:39.210> get<00:00:39.360> it<00:00:39.510> open

00:01:17.889 --> 00:01:17.899 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:22.219 

okay<00:01:18.899> so<00:01:20.030> now<00:01:21.030> you<00:01:21.090> got<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.390> shelf<00:01:21.750> and<00:01:21.929> now<00:01:22.049> no

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
okay so now you got the shelf and now no

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.899 
okay so now you got the shelf and now no
if<00:01:22.320> you<00:01:22.409> see<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.649> cell<00:01:22.920> but<00:01:23.299> is<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.600> board<00:01:24.960> for

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:25.909 
if you see the cell but is the board for

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:35.240 
if you see the cell but is the board for
the<00:01:26.909> controller<00:01:30.950> then<00:01:31.950> here's<00:01:33.860> the<00:01:34.860> circuit

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
the controller then here's the circuit

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.120 
the controller then here's the circuit
lower<00:01:35.399> floor<00:01:36.170> in<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.289> circuits<00:01:37.619> on<00:01:37.770> over<00:01:37.950> to

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
lower floor in the circuits on over to

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.380 
lower floor in the circuits on over to
the<00:01:38.219> board<00:01:39.439> and<00:01:41.060> usually<00:01:42.060> there<00:01:42.239> would<00:01:42.329> be

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
the board and usually there would be

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:49.929 
the board and usually there would be
like<00:01:42.739> corrosion<00:01:43.909> on<00:01:44.909> each<00:01:45.869> of<00:01:46.049> these<00:01:46.610> so<00:01:48.170> or

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:49.939 
like corrosion on each of these so or

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:54.770 
like corrosion on each of these so or
might<00:01:50.939> be<00:01:51.090> corrosion<00:01:51.360> women's<00:01:53.509> one<00:01:54.509> of<00:01:54.630> these

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
might be corrosion women's one of these

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.300 
might be corrosion women's one of these
these<00:01:55.079> are<00:01:55.259> little<00:01:56.179> contacts<00:01:57.179> for<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:58.310> board

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
these are little contacts for the board

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.109 
these are little contacts for the board
to<00:01:59.429> touch

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
to touch

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.580 
to touch
whenever<00:02:00.810> you're<00:02:00.959> pressing<00:02:01.140> the<00:02:01.319> button

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
whenever you're pressing the button

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.740 
whenever you're pressing the button
though<00:02:01.709> you<00:02:01.770> might<00:02:02.099> want<00:02:02.670> to<00:02:02.729> clean<00:02:03.090> those<00:02:03.329> and

swab or cheats it
I<00:02:16.769> just<00:02:17.190> called<00:02:17.430> over<00:02:17.639> here

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:36.090 

and<00:02:30.160> what<00:02:30.250> you're<00:02:30.400> going<00:02:30.550> to<00:02:30.610> do<00:02:32.760> get<00:02:33.760> this<00:02:35.100> and

and what you're going to do get this and

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:42.660 
and what you're going to do get this and
then<00:02:36.220> there's<00:02:36.490> like<00:02:36.640> kind<00:02:36.940> of<00:02:41.280> rub<00:02:42.280> it<00:02:42.430> free<00:02:42.640> of

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
then there's like kind of rub it free of

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:53.790 
then there's like kind of rub it free of
the<00:02:42.910> dirt<00:02:51.120> so<00:02:52.230> then<00:02:53.230> it<00:02:53.380> should<00:02:53.500> be<00:02:53.560> clean

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:53.800 
the dirt so then it should be clean

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.930 
the dirt so then it should be clean
right<00:02:54.040> there<00:02:56.250> you<00:02:57.250> might<00:02:57.400> want<00:02:57.550> to<00:02:57.580> do<00:02:57.730> with

right there you might want to do with
the<00:02:58.060> rest<00:02:58.239> of<00:02:58.360> the<00:02:58.450> null<00:02:58.630> especially<00:02:59.380> if

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
the rest of the null especially if

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:05.040 
the rest of the null especially if
they're<00:02:59.680> dirty<00:03:01.920> and<00:03:02.920> then<00:03:03.040> for<00:03:03.220> this<00:03:03.900> you<00:03:04.900> just

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.050 
they're dirty and then for this you just

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:12.690 
they're dirty and then for this you just
go<00:03:05.260> ahead<00:03:05.410> and<00:03:07.260> rub<00:03:08.260> on<00:03:08.380> each<00:03:08.590> one<00:03:08.860> of<00:03:08.980> them<00:03:11.700> and

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
go ahead and rub on each one of them and

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:22.680 
go ahead and rub on each one of them and
make<00:03:12.910> sure<00:03:12.940> that<00:03:13.120> gunk<00:03:13.630> comes<00:03:13.959> out<00:03:14.140> of<00:03:14.260> it

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:36.580 

and<00:03:23.690> same<00:03:23.990> for<00:03:24.020> the<00:03:24.230> control<00:03:24.560> pad<00:03:31.750> so<00:03:35.590> write

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
and same for the control pad so write

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:42.460 
and same for the control pad so write
them<00:03:36.770> in<00:03:36.950> their<00:03:38.410> feet<00:03:39.410> clean<00:03:41.020> and<00:03:42.020> then<00:03:42.170> if<00:03:42.380> you

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:42.470 
them in their feet clean and then if you

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:45.400 
them in their feet clean and then if you
want<00:03:42.650> to<00:03:42.710> reassemble<00:03:43.370> it<00:03:43.490> to<00:03:43.640> just<00:03:44.260> snap<00:03:45.260> it

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:45.410 
want to reassemble it to just snap it

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:47.830 
want to reassemble it to just snap it
back<00:03:45.440> in<00:03:45.590> its<00:03:45.860> own<00:03:46.580> little<00:03:46.910> area<00:03:47.330> low<00:03:47.570> they

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 
back in its own little area low they

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:49.300 
back in its own little area low they
each<00:03:47.990> have<00:03:48.170> a<00:03:48.200> hole<00:03:48.530> where<00:03:48.890> you<00:03:48.980> can<00:03:49.130> just

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310 
each have a hole where you can just

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:51.460 
each have a hole where you can just
stick<00:03:50.150> it<00:03:50.270> back<00:03:50.360> in<00:03:50.420> there<00:03:50.750> it's<00:03:51.140> not<00:03:51.290> that

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:51.470 
stick it back in there it's not that

00:03:51.470 --> 00:04:08.610 
stick it back in there it's not that
difficult<00:04:01.780> then<00:04:02.780> just<00:04:02.959> snap<00:04:03.080> it<00:04:03.260> back<00:04:03.410> on

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:46.670 

screw<00:04:09.620> that

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.380 

then<00:04:47.680> you<00:04:48.010> should<00:04:48.160> be<00:04:48.220> good<00:04:48.340> to<00:04:48.400> go<00:04:48.550> from<00:04:48.970> there

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:49.390 
then you should be good to go from there

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:52.770 
then you should be good to go from there
so<00:04:50.790> what<00:04:51.790> I'm<00:04:51.850> going<00:04:51.940> to<00:04:52.000> do<00:04:52.150> is<00:04:52.270> test<00:04:52.510> it<00:04:52.660> out

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:52.780 
so what I'm going to do is test it out

00:04:52.780 --> 00:05:25.830 
so what I'm going to do is test it out
make<00:04:53.080> sure<00:04:53.110> it<00:04:53.350> actually<00:04:53.500> does<00:04:53.950> work<00:05:24.840> all

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:25.840 
make sure it actually does work all

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:27.720 
make sure it actually does work all
right<00:05:25.960> so<00:05:26.170> got<00:05:26.860> the<00:05:26.950> controller<00:05:27.280> in<00:05:27.490> hand

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:27.730 
right so got the controller in hand

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:34.770 
right so got the controller in hand
let's<00:05:28.030> see<00:05:28.180> start<00:05:28.630> work<00:05:29.850> yep<00:05:32.490> see<00:05:33.490> if<00:05:33.780> up-down

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:34.780 
let's see start work yep see if up-down

00:05:34.780 --> 00:06:01.010 
let's see start work yep see if up-down
