thing<00:01:25.200> about<00:01:25.380> this<00:01:25.560> case<00:01:25.799> is<00:01:25.830> it's<00:01:26.250> somewhat

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
thing about this case is it's somewhat

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.700 
thing about this case is it's somewhat
difficult<00:01:26.850> to<00:01:27.150> install<00:01:27.509> because<00:01:28.320> none<00:01:28.530> of<00:01:28.560> the

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
difficult to install because none of the

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.679 
difficult to install because none of the
buttons<00:01:29.009> are<00:01:29.130> held<00:01:29.340> in<00:01:29.460> place<00:01:29.520> so<00:01:30.479> as<00:01:30.570> you're

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
trying to put this on you have to be

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.590 
trying to put this on you have to be
very<00:01:32.130> careful<00:01:32.520> that<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.790> buttons<00:01:33.060> don't<00:01:33.270> fall

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
very careful that the buttons don't fall

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.690 
very careful that the buttons don't fall

speaker mic and headset jack this is
very<00:01:56.579> recessed<00:01:57.119> so<00:01:57.360> you<00:01:57.450> can<00:01:57.600> see<00:01:57.780> right<00:01:57.960> there

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
very recessed so you can see right there

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.620 
very recessed so you can see right there
at<00:01:58.259> that<00:01:58.320> angle<00:01:58.829> so<00:01:58.880> it<00:01:59.880> probably<00:02:00.090> won't<00:02:00.360> dock

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
at that angle so it probably won't dock

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.530 
at that angle so it probably won't dock
with<00:02:00.869> many<00:02:01.049> items<00:02:01.259> and<00:02:01.680> a<00:02:01.799> couple<00:02:02.540> headphones

with many items and a couple headphones

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.149

might<00:02:03.960> not<00:02:04.110> fit<00:02:04.409> it's<00:02:04.649> just<00:02:04.829> going<00:02:04.950> to<00:02:05.040> be

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
might not fit it's just going to be

trial<00:02:05.729> and<00:02:05.909> error<00:02:06.060> to<00:02:06.240> get<00:02:06.360> one<00:02:06.540> because<00:02:06.780> it's

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
trial and error to get one because it's

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.839 
trial and error to get one because it's
so<00:02:07.140> deep<00:02:07.380> in<00:02:07.619> there<00:02:07.829> you<00:02:08.340> also<00:02:08.489> have<00:02:08.729> this

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849
