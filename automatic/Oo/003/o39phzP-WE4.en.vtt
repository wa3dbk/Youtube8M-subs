the<00:02:28.300> hammer<00:02:29.100> closes<00:02:30.100> the<00:02:30.250> jaws<00:02:30.550> this

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
the hammer closes the jaws this

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.860 
the hammer closes the jaws this
particular<00:02:31.890> manifold<00:02:32.970> closes<00:02:33.970> the<00:02:34.120> jaws<00:02:34.390> and

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
particular manifold closes the jaws and

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.410 
particular manifold closes the jaws and
then<00:02:35.080> allows<00:02:35.440> the<00:02:35.650> fiber<00:02:35.890> at<00:02:36.130> work<00:02:36.370> but<00:02:37.270> it

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
then allows the fiber at work but it

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.460 
then allows the fiber at work but it
does<00:02:37.630> it<00:02:37.780> in<00:02:37.900> a<00:02:37.990> very<00:02:38.020> safe<00:02:38.710> way<00:02:40.170> okay<00:02:41.170> coming

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
does it in a very safe way okay coming

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.910 
does it in a very safe way okay coming
around<00:02:41.770> here<00:02:42.720> the<00:02:43.720> clamp<00:02:44.080> I<00:02:44.350> just<00:02:44.650> want<00:02:44.830> to

in China not that making it in China is
bad<00:02:51.940> it's<00:02:52.720> just<00:02:52.990> that<00:02:53.110> we<00:02:53.380> want<00:02:53.680> to<00:02:53.770> have

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
bad it's just that we want to have

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.700 
bad it's just that we want to have
quality<00:02:54.520> control<00:02:54.910> on<00:02:55.240> our<00:02:55.270> castings<00:02:55.990> let's<00:02:56.530> go

okay here we're giving some advice on
the<00:03:01.750> castings<00:03:02.350> is<00:03:02.500> to<00:03:02.710> clean<00:03:03.310> before<00:03:03.640> you

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
the castings is to clean before you

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.470 
the castings is to clean before you
install<00:03:04.150> what<00:03:04.840> size<00:03:05.110> ball<00:03:05.470> you<00:03:05.770> should<00:03:05.980> be

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
install what size ball you should be

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.900 
install what size ball you should be
what<00:03:06.959> size<00:03:07.170> washer<00:03:07.800> used<00:03:08.010> you

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
what size washer used you

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.830 
what size washer used you
on<00:03:09.450> the<00:03:09.600> back<00:03:09.810> of<00:03:10.020> the<00:03:10.110> fence

going to explain you some of the
features<00:03:44.880> and<00:03:44.910> benefits<00:03:45.150> that<00:03:45.600> we've

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
features and benefits that we've

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.199 
features and benefits that we've
incorporated<00:03:46.709> into<00:03:47.310> this<00:03:47.489> machine<00:03:47.850> so<00:03:48.060> go

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
incorporated into this machine so go

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:49.699 
incorporated into this machine so go
ahead<00:03:48.269> now<00:03:48.480> one<00:03:48.840> of<00:03:48.870> the<00:03:49.019> first<00:03:49.200> things<00:03:49.500> we<00:03:49.680> did

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
ahead now one of the first things we did

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:52.059 
ahead now one of the first things we did
get<00:03:50.130> a<00:03:50.160> product<00:03:50.610> to<00:03:50.670> market<00:03:50.850> pretty<00:03:51.299> fast

00:03:52.059 --> 00:03:52.069 
get a product to market pretty fast

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:54.440 
get a product to market pretty fast
which<00:03:53.069> was<00:03:53.310> actually<00:03:53.549> a<00:03:53.760> working<00:03:54.030> prototype

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
which was actually a working prototype

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.090 
which was actually a working prototype
we<00:03:54.900> learned<00:03:55.140> a<00:03:55.230> few<00:03:55.380> things<00:03:55.440> on<00:03:55.769> there<00:03:55.890> are

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:56.100 
we learned a few things on there are

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.490 
we learned a few things on there are
working<00:03:56.489> prototype<00:03:57.030> one<00:03:57.599> was<00:03:57.810> known<00:03:58.170> to<00:03:58.200> have

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
working prototype one was known to have

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.630 
working prototype one was known to have
a<00:03:58.799> better<00:03:59.160> bearing<00:03:59.760> system<00:04:00.980> it<00:04:01.980> will<00:04:02.190> brown

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 
a better bearing system it will brown

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:05.600 
a better bearing system it will brown
down<00:04:03.000> with<00:04:03.630> excavators<00:04:04.170> who's<00:04:04.950> proud<00:04:05.220> force

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
down with excavators who's proud force

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:07.430 
down with excavators who's proud force
in<00:04:05.790> addition<00:04:06.239> to<00:04:06.330> vibrational<00:04:06.989> force<00:04:07.140> to<00:04:07.319> get

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
in addition to vibrational force to get

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.220 
in addition to vibrational force to get
pilot<00:04:07.890> foot-pounds

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
pilot foot-pounds

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.710 
pilot foot-pounds
duffle<00:04:10.950> very<00:04:11.220> swivel<00:04:11.910> that<00:04:12.060> allows<00:04:12.360> an

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
duffle very swivel that allows an

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:17.360 
duffle very swivel that allows an
excavator<00:04:13.650> operator<00:04:13.860> that<00:04:14.519> push<00:04:15.000> down

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.280 

so<00:04:17.670> that<00:04:17.790> was<00:04:17.910> one<00:04:18.090> improvement

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:19.290 
so that was one improvement

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:23.180 
so that was one improvement
now<00:04:19.740> that<00:04:19.950> we<00:04:20.010> needed<00:04:20.220> stupor<00:04:20.820> of<00:04:22.190> suppressor

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
now that we needed stupor of suppressor

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.640 
now that we needed stupor of suppressor
here<00:04:23.400> we<00:04:23.790> were<00:04:23.850> able<00:04:24.150> to<00:04:24.180> add<00:04:24.390> an<00:04:25.050> additional

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
here we were able to add an additional

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:30.010 
here we were able to add an additional
set<00:04:25.890> of<00:04:25.980> elastomers<00:04:26.580> on

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:30.020 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.590 

we<00:04:30.380> just<00:04:30.650> have<00:04:30.860> from<00:04:31.250> his<00:04:31.520> some<00:04:31.940> challenges

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:32.600 
we just have from his some challenges
