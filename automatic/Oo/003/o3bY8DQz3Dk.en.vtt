so great work last week everybody i
think<00:00:24.270> it<00:00:24.390> was<00:00:24.449> really<00:00:24.689> successful<00:00:24.840> but<00:00:25.259> we<00:00:25.380> do

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
think it was really successful but we do

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.019 
think it was really successful but we do
have<00:00:25.859> quite<00:00:26.279> a<00:00:26.340> bit<00:00:26.460> of<00:00:26.520> notes<00:00:26.699> to<00:00:26.880> work

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
have quite a bit of notes to work

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.519 
have quite a bit of notes to work
through<00:00:27.210> so<00:00:27.390> let's<00:00:27.960> start<00:00:28.140> out<00:00:28.199> with<00:00:28.259> the<00:00:28.320> big

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
through so let's start out with the big

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.400 
through so let's start out with the big
boys<00:00:28.710> I<00:00:29.070> think<00:00:29.099> Eli<00:00:29.640> you<00:00:29.910> take<00:00:30.119> Everest<00:00:31.110> we

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
boys I think Eli you take Everest we

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.260 
boys I think Eli you take Everest we
tested<00:00:31.770> three<00:00:32.040> different<00:00:32.369> things<00:00:32.640> and<00:00:32.970> what

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
tested three different things and what

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.259 
tested three different things and what
we're<00:00:33.390> going<00:00:33.629> for<00:00:33.780> is<00:00:34.350> two<00:00:34.949> versions<00:00:35.460> of<00:00:35.640> the

00:00:36.259 --> 00:00:36.269 
we're going for is two versions of the

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:39.110 
we're going for is two versions of the
convex<00:00:37.019> shape<00:00:37.440> I<00:00:37.739> think<00:00:38.040> that's<00:00:38.220> not<00:00:38.699> sums<00:00:38.970> up

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
convex shape I think that's not sums up

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.850 
convex shape I think that's not sums up
that<00:00:39.150> awesome<00:00:39.720> solicitous<00:00:40.170> waiters<00:00:40.470> I<00:00:40.620> think

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
that awesome solicitous waiters I think

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.610 
that awesome solicitous waiters I think
the<00:00:41.129> motion<00:00:41.489> was<00:00:41.940> awesome<00:00:42.870> but<00:00:43.320> we<00:00:43.379> still<00:00:43.440> need

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
the motion was awesome but we still need

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:44.930 
the motion was awesome but we still need
to<00:00:43.739> get<00:00:43.890> this<00:00:44.070> right<00:00:44.280> just<00:00:44.640> a<00:00:44.699> few<00:00:44.850> different

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
to get this right just a few different

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.060 
to get this right just a few different
versions<00:00:45.150> one<00:00:45.870> where<00:00:46.079> one<00:00:46.379> is<00:00:46.409> actually<00:00:47.040> a

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
versions one where one is actually a

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.740 
versions one where one is actually a
little<00:00:47.489> further<00:00:47.640> out<00:00:47.879> and<00:00:48.089> a<00:00:48.120> little<00:00:48.239> lower<00:00:48.510> so

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
little further out and a little lower so

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.540 
little further out and a little lower so
that<00:00:48.870> you<00:00:49.199> get<00:00:49.530> two<00:00:49.739> types<00:00:50.010> of<00:00:50.129> reach<00:00:50.339> well

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
that you get two types of reach well

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.520 
that you get two types of reach well
covered<00:00:51.000> crybaby<00:00:51.449> now<00:00:51.629> so<00:00:51.839> this<00:00:51.989> was<00:00:52.199> one<00:00:52.379> that

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
covered crybaby now so this was one that

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.100 
covered crybaby now so this was one that
we<00:00:52.710> tested<00:00:53.309> with<00:00:53.430> mixed<00:00:53.729> results<00:00:53.909> at<00:00:54.479> alpha

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
we tested with mixed results at alpha

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.719 
we tested with mixed results at alpha
testing<00:00:55.470> and<00:00:55.650> we<00:00:55.710> tested<00:00:56.040> a<00:00:56.100> few<00:00:56.159> different

00:00:56.719 --> 00:00:56.729 
testing and we tested a few different

00:00:56.729 --> 00:00:59.450 
testing and we tested a few different
things<00:00:56.760> we<00:00:57.269> know<00:00:57.510> we<00:00:57.540> need<00:00:57.900> some<00:00:58.589> better<00:00:58.799> tests

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
things we know we need some better tests

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.759 
things we know we need some better tests
between<00:00:59.729> now<00:01:00.150> and<00:01:00.360> data<00:01:00.540> so<00:01:00.809> we<00:01:00.960> we<00:01:01.439> have<00:01:01.530> some

00:01:01.759 --> 00:01:01.769 
between now and data so we we have some

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:03.380 
between now and data so we we have some
promising<00:01:02.309> leads<00:01:02.339> but<00:01:02.820> we<00:01:02.909> definitely<00:01:03.089> have<00:01:03.360> a

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
promising leads but we definitely have a

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.760 
promising leads but we definitely have a
ways<00:01:03.629> to<00:01:03.659> go<00:01:05.780> so<00:01:06.780> we're<00:01:06.900> out<00:01:07.020> here<00:01:07.170> in<00:01:07.229> temecula

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
ways to go so we're out here in temecula

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.350 
ways to go so we're out here in temecula
we're<00:01:07.979> getting<00:01:08.220> ready<00:01:08.369> for<00:01:08.610> an<00:01:08.700> or<00:01:08.820> beta<00:01:09.030> test

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
we're getting ready for an or beta test

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.539 
we're getting ready for an or beta test
event<00:01:09.689> which<00:01:09.930> is<00:01:10.140> where<00:01:10.740> we<00:01:10.830> test<00:01:11.009> with<00:01:11.250> actual

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
event which is where we test with actual

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.789 
event which is where we test with actual

the<00:01:29.470> ASCO<00:01:29.890> to<00:01:29.950> start<00:01:30.310> the<00:01:30.430> party<00:01:30.640> was<00:01:31.060> just<00:01:31.360> a

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:31.570 
the ASCO to start the party was just a

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:35.610 
the ASCO to start the party was just a
little<00:01:31.900> on<00:01:32.080> or<00:01:32.230> two<00:01:33.720> so<00:01:34.720> basically<00:01:35.260> there's<00:01:35.560> a

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:35.620 
little on or two so basically there's a

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:38.550 
little on or two so basically there's a
delay<00:01:35.920> with<00:01:35.950> our<00:01:36.220> truckin<00:01:36.610> today

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
delay with our truckin today

delay with our truckin today
it's<00:01:39.130> throwing<00:01:39.610> our<00:01:39.790> schedule<00:01:40.240> off<00:01:42.210> crybabies

it's throwing our schedule off crybabies

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.359 
it's throwing our schedule off crybabies
been<00:01:43.360> a<00:01:43.390> real<00:01:43.600> challenge<00:01:43.630> to<00:01:44.229> chemically<00:01:44.890> yet

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:45.369 
been a real challenge to chemically yet

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:46.789 
been a real challenge to chemically yet
right<00:01:45.670> to<00:01:46.030> get<00:01:46.180> the<00:01:46.299> right<00:01:46.450> effect

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
right to get the right effect

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.710 
right to get the right effect
consistently<00:01:47.799> but<00:01:48.189> also<00:01:48.340> safely<00:01:48.850> actually<00:01:49.630> an

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:49.720 
consistently but also safely actually an

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.270 
consistently but also safely actually an
alpha<00:01:49.990> testing<00:01:50.259> we<00:01:50.380> never<00:01:50.560> did<00:01:50.799> come<00:01:50.979> up<00:01:51.130> with

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.280 
alpha testing we never did come up with

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.910 
alpha testing we never did come up with
something<00:01:51.640> we<00:01:52.630> did<00:01:52.810> some<00:01:52.990> additional<00:01:53.470> testing

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 
something we did some additional testing

00:01:53.920 --> 00:02:03.270 
something we did some additional testing
between<00:01:54.909> alpha<00:01:55.119> and<00:01:55.299> beta<00:01:55.630> 0<00:02:01.409> so<00:02:02.409> the<00:02:02.829> crybaby

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
between alpha and beta 0 so the crybaby

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.429 
between alpha and beta 0 so the crybaby
obstacle<00:02:03.909> is<00:02:04.240> supposed<00:02:04.630> to<00:02:04.750> simulate<00:02:04.960> getting

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:05.439 
obstacle is supposed to simulate getting

obstacle is supposed to simulate getting
tear<00:02:05.649> gassed<00:02:05.950> most<00:02:06.460> people<00:02:06.759> don't<00:02:07.090> really

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479 
tear gassed most people don't really

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:09.479 
tear gassed most people don't really
know<00:02:07.630> what<00:02:07.810> this<00:02:07.929> actually<00:02:08.110> feels<00:02:08.530> like<00:02:08.890> we're

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:09.489 
know what this actually feels like we're

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:11.250 
know what this actually feels like we're
trying<00:02:09.610> to<00:02:09.759> create<00:02:09.880> that<00:02:10.209> in<00:02:10.479> a<00:02:10.569> relatively

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
trying to create that in a relatively

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.800 
trying to create that in a relatively
controlled<00:02:11.970> relatively<00:02:12.970> safe<00:02:13.180> environment

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
controlled relatively safe environment

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.570 
controlled relatively safe environment
we<00:02:14.019> had<00:02:14.170> a<00:02:14.200> lot<00:02:14.290> of<00:02:14.440> challenges<00:02:14.709> coming<00:02:15.400> up

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
we had a lot of challenges coming up

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.820 
we had a lot of challenges coming up
with<00:02:15.700> us<00:02:15.850> because<00:02:16.200> everybody<00:02:17.200> senses<00:02:17.709> are

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
with us because everybody senses are

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:43.600 
guy's got this structure partially built

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.030 
guy's got this structure partially built
yesterday<00:02:43.840> how<00:02:44.320> the<00:02:44.380> first<00:02:44.590> point<00:02:44.829> is<00:02:44.890> going

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
yesterday how the first point is going

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.860 
yesterday how the first point is going
to<00:02:45.100> be<00:02:45.190> doing<00:02:45.310> our<00:02:45.549> way<00:02:46.000> out<00:02:46.180> we<00:02:46.209> want<00:02:46.600> to<00:02:46.690> put

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
to be doing our way out we want to put

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:48.390 
to be doing our way out we want to put
the<00:02:46.989> orig<00:02:47.260> here<00:02:47.500> first<00:02:47.859> before<00:02:48.040> you<00:02:48.370> start

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
the orig here first before you start

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.370 
the orig here first before you start
putting<00:02:48.760> a<00:02:48.940> scaffold<00:02:49.450> up<00:02:49.540> if<00:02:49.720> you<00:02:50.019> want

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380 
putting a scaffold up if you want

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.740 
putting a scaffold up if you want
I<00:02:50.890> think<00:02:51.220> we<00:02:51.340> should<00:02:51.370> put<00:02:51.760> it<00:02:51.850> here<00:02:52.000> first<00:02:52.270> all

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
I think we should put it here first all

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.510 
I think we should put it here first all
right<00:02:52.990> Burke<00:02:53.350> just<00:02:53.800> about<00:02:53.980> to<00:02:54.130> the<00:02:54.220> point<00:02:54.400> we

right Burke just about to the point we
can<00:02:54.550> start<00:02:54.850> doing<00:02:55.090> a<00:02:55.150> layout<00:02:55.330> every<00:02:56.290> decision

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
can start doing a layout every decision

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.860 
can start doing a layout every decision
we<00:02:56.680> make<00:02:56.770> isn't<00:02:57.250> going<00:02:57.460> to<00:02:57.580> be<00:02:57.700> a<00:02:57.730> hit<00:02:57.970> but<00:02:58.660> in

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
wrong but we've definitely had a slew of

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.000 
wrong but we've definitely had a slew of
