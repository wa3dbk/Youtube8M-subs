same way than a lot of other slot
machines<00:00:33.239> kind<00:00:33.870> of<00:00:33.930> have<00:00:34.020> a<00:00:34.079> theme<00:00:34.320> that<00:00:34.500> go

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
machines kind of have a theme that go

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.500 
machines kind of have a theme that go
with<00:00:34.770> them<00:00:34.980> usually<00:00:35.340> they're<00:00:35.700> something<00:00:36.270> not

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
with them usually they're something not

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.270 
with them usually they're something not
as<00:00:36.660> historical<00:00:37.230> but<00:00:37.649> I<00:00:37.710> kind<00:00:37.860> of<00:00:37.890> dig<00:00:38.070> it<00:00:38.160> I'm

as historical but I kind of dig it I'm
quite<00:00:38.640> little<00:00:38.790> innard<00:00:39.090> so<00:00:39.300> I<00:00:39.329> enjoy<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:39.690> fact

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
quite little innard so I enjoy the fact

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.340 
quite little innard so I enjoy the fact

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:45.709 
just kind of jump in and show you how
this<00:00:44.579> works<00:00:44.789> I've<00:00:45.030> been<00:00:45.149> playing<00:00:45.360> it<00:00:45.510> quite<00:00:45.660> a

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
this works I've been playing it quite a

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:46.100 
this works I've been playing it quite a
bit

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
bit

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.100 
bit
so<00:00:46.950> you've<00:00:47.370> got<00:00:47.520> lines<00:00:47.940> 25<00:00:48.570> different<00:00:48.930> lines

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
so you've got lines 25 different lines

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.290 
so you've got lines 25 different lines
we've<00:00:49.379> got<00:00:49.469> different<00:00:49.620> max<00:00:49.980> bets<00:00:50.309> for<00:00:51.149> each

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
we've got different max bets for each

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.340 
we've got different max bets for each
different<00:00:52.309> for<00:00:53.309> each<00:00:53.370> machine<00:00:54.199> somebody<00:00:55.199> said

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
different for each machine somebody said

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.459 
different for each machine somebody said
to<00:00:55.379> just<00:00:56.010> a<00:00:56.070> basic<00:00:56.340> 25k<00:00:56.969> any<00:00:57.750> simply<00:00:58.140> spin<00:00:58.379> it

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
to just a basic 25k any simply spin it

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.110 
to just a basic 25k any simply spin it
like<00:00:58.590> this<00:00:58.770> so<00:00:59.129> in<00:00:59.250> this<00:00:59.370> in<00:00:59.640> this<00:00:59.789> way<00:00:59.969> it's

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
like this so in this in this way it's

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.090 
like this so in this in this way it's
the<00:01:00.180> same<00:01:00.210> as<00:01:00.539> any<00:01:00.660> other<00:01:00.780> real<00:01:01.170> any<00:01:01.920> other

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
the same as any other real any other

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.009 
the same as any other real any other
Bowl<00:01:02.670> real<00:01:02.940> I<00:01:02.969> suppose<00:01:03.329> any<00:01:03.510> real<00:01:03.719> slot

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
Bowl real I suppose any real slot

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.350 
Bowl real I suppose any real slot
machine<00:01:04.379> it's<00:01:05.339> also<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.790> same<00:01:05.970> as<00:01:06.180> many

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
machine it's also the same as many

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.929 
machine it's also the same as many
others<00:01:06.600> slot<00:01:07.130> applications<00:01:08.130> in<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.549> you<00:01:08.850> know

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
others slot applications in the you know

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.899 
others slot applications in the you know
that<00:01:09.119> you<00:01:09.210> would<00:01:09.360> expect<00:01:10.080> it<00:01:11.040> babes<00:01:11.369> basically

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
that you would expect it babes basically

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.460 
that you would expect it babes basically
the<00:01:12.000> same<00:01:12.210> if<00:01:12.600> you've<00:01:12.780> never<00:01:12.930> seen<00:01:13.170> a<00:01:13.229> slot

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
the same if you've never seen a slot

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:14.600 
the same if you've never seen a slot
machine<00:01:13.500> before<00:01:13.830> don't<00:01:14.189> know<00:01:14.250> how<00:01:14.369> it<00:01:14.460> works

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
machine before don't know how it works

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.609 
machine before don't know how it works
I'd<00:01:14.909> suggest<00:01:15.270> googling<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.659> basics<00:01:16.020> cuz

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
I'd suggest googling the basics cuz

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:17.749 
I'd suggest googling the basics cuz
there<00:01:16.799> are<00:01:16.860> places<00:01:17.040> out<00:01:17.310> there<00:01:17.490> that<00:01:17.640> could

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
there are places out there that could

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.640 
there are places out there that could
much<00:01:18.030> better<00:01:18.299> explain<00:01:18.750> how<00:01:19.380> they<00:01:19.530> actually

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
much better explain how they actually

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.480 
much better explain how they actually
work<00:01:19.920> that<00:01:20.220> I<00:01:20.280> could<00:01:21.710> but<00:01:22.710> if<00:01:23.130> you're<00:01:23.340> familiar

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
work that I could but if you're familiar

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:24.800 
work that I could but if you're familiar
these<00:01:23.850> things<00:01:24.090> and<00:01:24.270> this<00:01:24.360> is<00:01:24.509> pretty<00:01:24.689> much

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
these things and this is pretty much

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.630 
these things and this is pretty much
exactly<00:01:25.020> what<00:01:25.170> you'd<00:01:25.380> expect<00:01:25.439> it<00:01:26.100> is<00:01:26.310> a<00:01:26.400> slot

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
exactly what you'd expect it is a slot

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:27.980 
exactly what you'd expect it is a slot
machine<00:01:26.670> I've<00:01:27.060> got<00:01:27.180> 25<00:01:27.509> different<00:01:27.840> lines

I<00:01:30.270> could<00:01:30.540> tap<00:01:30.750> this<00:01:31.850> maxes<00:01:32.850> out<00:01:33.060> I<00:01:33.770> think<00:01:35.210> well

billions<00:01:43.079> to<00:01:43.259> spare<00:01:43.530> so<00:01:43.680> we're<00:01:43.770> not<00:01:43.860> going<00:01:44.009> to

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
billions to spare so we're not going to

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.569 
billions to spare so we're not going to
do<00:01:44.189> that<00:01:44.340> some<00:01:44.640> go<00:01:44.790> back<00:01:44.970> down<00:01:45.270> and<00:01:46.460> settle<00:01:47.460> in

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
do that some go back down and settle in

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.789 
do that some go back down and settle in
somewhere<00:01:48.000> around<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.240> 25k<00:01:48.899> mark<00:01:49.200> again<00:01:49.590> and

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
somewhere around the 25k mark again and

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.100 
somewhere around the 25k mark again and
then<00:01:50.579> just<00:01:50.880> hit<00:01:51.090> it<00:01:51.119> to<00:01:51.780> show<00:01:51.930> you<00:01:51.990> another

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
then just hit it to show you another

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.990 
then just hit it to show you another
spin<00:01:52.439> let's<00:01:52.950> see<00:01:53.130> if<00:01:53.280> I<00:01:53.399> win<00:01:53.610> anything<00:01:53.909> this

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
spin let's see if I win anything this

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.240 
spin let's see if I win anything this
time<00:01:54.110> actually<00:01:55.110> did<00:01:55.320> so<00:01:55.500> there<00:01:55.649> we<00:01:55.710> go<00:01:55.829> so<00:01:56.130> it

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
time actually did so there we go so it

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.160

nine more spins than I get I think it's

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.340

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
going to keep doing this if you couldn't

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.960 
going to keep doing this if you couldn't
tell<00:02:33.350> there's<00:02:34.070> an<00:02:34.190> auto<00:02:34.400> function<00:02:34.670> where<00:02:34.910> you

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
tell there's an auto function where you

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:36.460 
tell there's an auto function where you
simply<00:02:35.210> hold<00:02:35.330> this<00:02:35.540> down<00:02:35.780> and<00:02:35.990> then<00:02:36.110> it<00:02:36.350> will

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
simply hold this down and then it will

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.950 
simply hold this down and then it will
go<00:02:36.680> through<00:02:36.920> and<00:02:37.420> automatically<00:02:38.420> spin<00:02:38.630> for

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:38.960 
go through and automatically spin for

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.390 
go through and automatically spin for
you<00:02:39.020> this<00:02:39.140> is<00:02:39.290> how<00:02:39.410> most<00:02:39.590> people<00:02:39.710> prefer<00:02:40.130> to

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
you this is how most people prefer to

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.950 
you this is how most people prefer to
play<00:02:40.550> these<00:02:40.670> games<00:02:40.940> I<00:02:41.150> certainly<00:02:41.420> do<00:02:41.690> just

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:41.960 
play these games I certainly do just

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:43.540 
play these games I certainly do just
because<00:02:42.260> it<00:02:42.560> gets<00:02:42.740> tiresome<00:02:43.250> if<00:02:43.400> you're

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550 
because it gets tiresome if you're

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:45.310 
because it gets tiresome if you're
spinning<00:02:43.730> and<00:02:44.180> if<00:02:44.420> you're<00:02:44.660> quite<00:02:45.050> good<00:02:45.080> of

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:45.320 
spinning and if you're quite good of

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.110 
spinning and if you're quite good of
these<00:02:45.410> things<00:02:45.590> are<00:02:45.710> used<00:02:45.920> to<00:02:46.070> them<00:02:46.250> I<00:02:46.460> guess

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
these things are used to them I guess

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.820 
these things are used to them I guess
it's<00:02:47.300> hard<00:02:47.450> to<00:02:47.570> be<00:02:47.690> skilled<00:02:48.260> at<00:02:48.380> it<00:02:48.530> I<00:02:48.650> guess

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830 
it's hard to be skilled at it I guess

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:50.440 
it's hard to be skilled at it I guess
but<00:02:49.040> if<00:02:49.190> you're<00:02:49.400> if<00:02:49.550> you're<00:02:49.580> very<00:02:50.090> much<00:02:50.210> used

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
but if you're if you're very much used

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:51.730 
but if you're if you're very much used
to<00:02:50.660> slot<00:02:50.870> machines<00:02:51.170> and<00:02:51.320> just<00:02:51.350> want<00:02:51.560> to<00:02:51.590> play

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:51.740 
to slot machines and just want to play

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:53.290 
to slot machines and just want to play
them<00:02:51.860> you<00:02:52.400> get<00:02:52.550> in<00:02:52.610> the<00:02:52.670> habit<00:02:52.820> of<00:02:53.060> just

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:53.300 
them you get in the habit of just

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:54.670 
them you get in the habit of just
constantly<00:02:53.750> pulling<00:02:54.230> the<00:02:54.350> lever

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
constantly pulling the lever

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.100 
constantly pulling the lever
it's<00:02:55.100> kind<00:02:55.340> of<00:02:55.400> an<00:02:55.550> odds<00:02:55.730> thing<00:02:56.120> so<00:02:56.780> it's<00:02:56.960> nice

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110 
it's kind of an odds thing so it's nice

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:58.330 
it's kind of an odds thing so it's nice
that<00:02:57.290> that's<00:02:57.470> there<00:02:57.710> and<00:02:57.890> that's<00:02:58.070> typically

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
that that's there and that's typically

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.690 
that that's there and that's typically
how<00:02:58.460> I<00:02:58.490> play<00:02:58.700> this<00:02:59.980> as<00:03:00.980> you<00:03:01.160> see<00:03:01.310> I'm<00:03:01.400> winning
