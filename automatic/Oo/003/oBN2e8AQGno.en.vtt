i'm<00:02:04.619> encouraging<00:02:05.619> rising<00:02:06.130> because<00:02:06.310> i<00:02:06.549> think

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
i'm encouraging rising because i think

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:11.870 
i'm encouraging rising because i think
it<00:02:07.649> it<00:02:08.649> produces<00:02:09.250> the<00:02:09.369> fluidity<00:02:09.819> and

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
it it produces the fluidity and

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.970 
it it produces the fluidity and
hopefully<00:02:13.319> that<00:02:14.319> ball<00:02:14.530> you<00:02:14.650> will<00:02:14.830> get<00:02:14.920> a

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
hopefully that ball you will get a

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.530 
hopefully that ball you will get a
better<00:02:15.190> rhythm<00:02:15.459> and<00:02:15.640> a<00:02:15.730> bench<00:02:15.910> tried<00:02:16.239> if<00:02:16.420> you

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
better rhythm and a bench tried if you
