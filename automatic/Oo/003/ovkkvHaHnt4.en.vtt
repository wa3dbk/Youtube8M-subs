talk about how to test ESD flooring the
first<00:00:17.460> thing<00:00:17.609> we're<00:00:17.730> going<00:00:17.820> to<00:00:17.880> talk<00:00:18.060> about<00:00:18.119> is

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
first thing we're going to talk about is

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.920 
first thing we're going to talk about is
how<00:00:18.930> not<00:00:19.199> to<00:00:19.470> test<00:00:19.710> ESD<00:00:20.279> flooring<00:00:20.930> typically

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
how not to test ESD flooring typically

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.359 
how not to test ESD flooring typically
if<00:00:22.050> we<00:00:22.170> get<00:00:22.320> a<00:00:22.350> phone<00:00:22.619> call<00:00:22.650> from<00:00:23.039> one<00:00:23.130> of<00:00:23.250> our

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
if we get a phone call from one of our

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.179 
if we get a phone call from one of our
clients<00:00:23.910> and<00:00:24.380> they<00:00:25.380> tell<00:00:25.619> us<00:00:25.650> that<00:00:26.010> they've

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
clients and they tell us that they've

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.009 
clients and they tell us that they've
tested<00:00:26.580> the<00:00:26.699> floor<00:00:26.970> and<00:00:27.210> they<00:00:27.570> can't<00:00:27.840> get<00:00:27.960> a

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
tested the floor and they can't get a

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.320 
tested the floor and they can't get a
reading<00:00:28.439> the<00:00:29.220> first<00:00:29.429> thing<00:00:29.640> we<00:00:29.760> ask<00:00:29.789> them<00:00:30.179> is

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
reading the first thing we ask them is

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.150 
reading the first thing we ask them is
are<00:00:30.510> you<00:00:30.599> using<00:00:30.779> a<00:00:30.990> standard<00:00:31.439> volt<00:00:31.679> ohm<00:00:31.890> meter

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
are you using a standard volt ohm meter

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.060 
are you using a standard volt ohm meter
and<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.910> answer<00:00:33.180> is<00:00:33.329> always<00:00:33.510> yes<00:00:33.660> and<00:00:34.140> I<00:00:34.860> have

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
and the answer is always yes and I have

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.280 
and the answer is always yes and I have
one<00:00:35.219> in<00:00:35.340> my<00:00:35.460> hand<00:00:35.790> and<00:00:36.000> you'll<00:00:36.420> notice<00:00:36.780> that

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
one in my hand and you'll notice that

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.139 
one in my hand and you'll notice that
there's<00:00:37.559> a<00:00:37.620> red<00:00:37.829> lead<00:00:38.070> and<00:00:38.340> a<00:00:38.370> black<00:00:38.610> lead<00:00:38.910> and

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
there's a red lead and a black lead and

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.209 
there's a red lead and a black lead and
each<00:00:39.719> of<00:00:39.899> these<00:00:40.020> leads<00:00:40.350> has<00:00:40.559> a<00:00:40.590> little<00:00:40.890> pin<00:00:41.040> on

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
each of these leads has a little pin on

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.220 
each of these leads has a little pin on
the<00:00:41.309> end<00:00:41.340> of<00:00:41.610> it<00:00:41.700> and<00:00:42.020> unfortunately<00:00:43.020> these

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
the end of it and unfortunately these

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.650 
the end of it and unfortunately these
little<00:00:43.500> pins<00:00:43.770> do<00:00:44.460> not<00:00:44.640> make<00:00:44.910> enough<00:00:45.180> contact

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
little pins do not make enough contact

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.290 
little pins do not make enough contact
area<00:00:46.110> with<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:46.739> conductive<00:00:47.370> floor<00:00:47.640> to<00:00:48.120> get<00:00:48.239> a

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
area with the conductive floor to get a

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.430 
area with the conductive floor to get a
reading<00:00:48.649> the<00:00:49.649> probes<00:00:49.950> we<00:00:50.190> use<00:00:51.050> are<00:00:52.050> three

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
reading the probes we use are three

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.439 
reading the probes we use are three
inches<00:00:52.590> in<00:00:52.890> diameter<00:00:53.070> and<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.789> reason<00:00:54.149> we<00:00:54.270> do

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
inches in diameter and the reason we do

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.880 
inches in diameter and the reason we do
that<00:00:54.480> is<00:00:55.309> because<00:00:56.309> we're<00:00:56.670> contacting<00:00:57.210> a

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:57.890 
that is because we're contacting a

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.860 
that is because we're contacting a
surface<00:00:58.890> that<00:00:59.460> has<00:00:59.609> a<00:00:59.640> bunch<00:00:59.910> of<00:01:00.090> veins<00:01:00.359> in<00:01:00.719> it

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
surface that has a bunch of veins in it

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.380 
surface that has a bunch of veins in it
and<00:01:00.989> those<00:01:01.379> veins<00:01:01.710> are<00:01:02.039> conductive<00:01:02.579> and<00:01:02.730> in

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
and those veins are conductive and in

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.910 
and those veins are conductive and in
order<00:01:03.629> to<00:01:03.660> make<00:01:03.930> good<00:01:03.960> contact<00:01:04.619> with<00:01:04.680> them

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
order to make good contact with them

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.480 
order to make good contact with them
need<00:01:05.580> a<00:01:05.610> large<00:01:05.909> surface<00:01:06.450> so<00:01:07.140> when<00:01:07.950> you<00:01:08.040> test<00:01:08.310> an

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
need a large surface so when you test an

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.580 
need a large surface so when you test an
ESD<00:01:08.970> floor<00:01:09.299> you<00:01:09.540> have<00:01:09.659> to<00:01:09.810> use<00:01:10.049> what's<00:01:10.500> called

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
ESD floor you have to use what's called

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.370 
ESD floor you have to use what's called
an<00:01:10.950> NFPA<00:01:11.310> probe<00:01:12.000> so<00:01:12.750> I've<00:01:12.840> got<00:01:12.990> two<00:01:13.140> of<00:01:13.260> them

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
an NFPA probe so I've got two of them

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.230 
an NFPA probe so I've got two of them
here<00:01:13.439> what<00:01:13.890> I'm<00:01:13.950> going<00:01:14.130> to<00:01:14.189> do<00:01:14.369> is<00:01:14.880> quickly

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
here what I'm going to do is quickly

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.240 
here what I'm going to do is quickly
show<00:01:15.570> you<00:01:15.600> how<00:01:15.960> I'm<00:01:16.229> going<00:01:16.380> to<00:01:16.439> test<00:01:16.680> this<00:01:16.890> tile

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
show you how I'm going to test this tile

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.850 
show you how I'm going to test this tile
and<00:01:17.520> find<00:01:17.759> out<00:01:17.970> if<00:01:18.420> in<00:01:18.810> fact<00:01:19.020> it's<00:01:19.320> conductive

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
and find out if in fact it's conductive

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.830 
and find out if in fact it's conductive
so<00:01:20.610> we're<00:01:20.759> going<00:01:20.880> to<00:01:20.970> do<00:01:21.150> is<00:01:21.270> take<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.600> tile

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
so we're going to do is take the tile

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.539 
so we're going to do is take the tile
we're<00:01:22.229> going<00:01:22.259> to<00:01:22.439> place<00:01:22.500> it<00:01:22.710> on<00:01:22.920> this<00:01:23.100> copper

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
we're going to place it on this copper

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.090 
we're going to place it on this copper
strip<00:01:23.880> which<00:01:24.869> is<00:01:24.960> right<00:01:25.170> here<00:01:25.200> which<00:01:25.860> is<00:01:25.979> what

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
strip which is right here which is what

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.810 
strip which is right here which is what
we<00:01:26.189> use<00:01:26.340> to<00:01:26.520> ground<00:01:26.790> ESD<00:01:27.720> flooring<00:01:28.640> and<00:01:29.640> put

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
we use to ground ESD flooring and put

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.850 
we use to ground ESD flooring and put
one<00:01:29.939> of<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.119> probes<00:01:30.360> on<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.689> tile<00:01:30.960> I'm<00:01:31.680> going

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
one of the probes on the tile I'm going

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.319 
one of the probes on the tile I'm going
to<00:01:31.920> set<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.220> other<00:01:32.340> probe<00:01:32.700> on<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:32.939> piece<00:01:33.299> of

it's<00:01:54.960> a<00:01:55.170> static<00:01:55.770> dissipative<00:01:56.250> floor<00:01:56.640> that's

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
it's a static dissipative floor that's

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.999 
it's a static dissipative floor that's
an<00:01:57.299> acceptable<00:01:57.630> reading<00:01:58.140> and<00:01:58.619> so<00:01:58.770> we're<00:01:58.890> right

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
an acceptable reading and so we're right

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.940 
an acceptable reading and so we're right
in<00:01:59.130> the<00:01:59.189> middle<00:01:59.369> of<00:01:59.549> what<00:02:00.149> we<00:02:00.270> would<00:02:00.390> call<00:02:00.600> a

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950

safe specification the second test we

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.709 
safe specification the second test we
perform<00:02:04.860> is<00:02:05.070> what<00:02:05.219> we<00:02:05.340> call<00:02:05.549> a<00:02:05.820> point-to-point

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.889 
perform is what we call a point-to-point
resistance<00:02:07.530> test<00:02:07.860> and<00:02:08.160> in<00:02:08.970> that<00:02:09.090> test<00:02:09.390> we<00:02:09.660> take

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
resistance test and in that test we take

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.260 
resistance test and in that test we take
the<00:02:10.410> two<00:02:10.590> probes<00:02:10.860> we<00:02:11.580> set<00:02:11.819> them<00:02:12.000> on<00:02:12.150> the

the two probes we set them on the

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.080 
the two probes we set them on the

Laure we don't attach them to ground we
actually<00:02:15.580> just<00:02:15.760> test<00:02:16.000> from<00:02:16.209> one<00:02:16.360> point<00:02:16.569> on<00:02:16.720> the

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:21.819 
one of the reasons we do that is we want

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:24.000 
one of the reasons we do that is we want
to<00:02:21.940> find<00:02:22.300> out<00:02:22.510> if<00:02:22.750> the<00:02:23.290> floor<00:02:23.560> is<00:02:23.590> more

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
to find out if the floor is more

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.040 
to find out if the floor is more

here<00:02:51.190> isn't<00:02:51.340> just<00:02:51.730> to<00:02:51.849> find<00:02:52.090> out<00:02:52.209> if<00:02:52.269> the<00:02:52.480> floor
