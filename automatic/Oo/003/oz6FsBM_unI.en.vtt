00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
would go you skate to the blue line and

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.160 
would go you skate to the blue line and
like<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.300> defense<00:00:48.660> would<00:00:48.750> be<00:00:48.840> going<00:00:48.989> to<00:00:49.079> get

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
like the defense would be going to get

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.540 
like the defense would be going to get
it<00:00:49.260> and<00:00:49.410> you'd<00:00:49.559> literally<00:00:49.860> you<00:00:50.100> want<00:00:50.340> to<00:00:50.430> just

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
it and you'd literally you want to just

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.060 
it and you'd literally you want to just
poke<00:00:50.789> it<00:00:51.000> past<00:00:51.149> them<00:00:51.449> and<00:00:51.710> yeah<00:00:52.710> you<00:00:52.770> would

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
poke it past them and yeah you would

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.250 
poke it past them and yeah you would
instead<00:00:53.969> of<00:00:54.000> do<00:00:54.180> like<00:00:54.390> a<00:00:54.420> puck<00:00:54.690> chop<00:00:54.960> and<00:00:55.170> your

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
instead of do like a puck chop and your

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.569 
instead of do like a puck chop and your
guy<00:00:55.379> would<00:00:55.530> just<00:00:55.680> swing<00:00:55.920> and<00:00:56.100> miss<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.399> puck

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
guy would just swing and miss the puck

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:57.830 
guy would just swing and miss the puck
and<00:00:56.789> then<00:00:56.910> your<00:00:57.059> guy<00:00:57.180> would<00:00:57.329> be<00:00:57.420> skating<00:00:57.750> by

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
and then your guy would be skating by

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.240 
and then your guy would be skating by
the<00:00:57.899> defenseman<00:00:58.500> and<00:00:58.649> you<00:00:58.710> come<00:00:58.949> back<00:00:59.070> and

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
the defenseman and you come back and

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.110 
the defenseman and you come back and
take<00:00:59.460> a<00:00:59.520> shot<00:00:59.760> so<00:01:00.570> that's<00:01:00.809> a<00:01:00.960> lot<00:01:01.590> better<00:01:02.160> if

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
take a shot so that's a lot better if

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.210 
take a shot so that's a lot better if
used<00:01:03.420> when<00:01:04.049> close<00:01:04.320> to<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.650> offensive<00:01:04.949> goal

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
used when close to the offensive goal

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.190 
used when close to the offensive goal
the<00:01:05.339> player<00:01:05.580> will<00:01:05.790> try<00:01:06.030> and<00:01:06.090> put<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:07.020> puck<00:01:07.170> in

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
the player will try and put the puck in

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.179 
the player will try and put the puck in
the<00:01:07.320> net<00:01:07.409> so<00:01:08.119> maybe<00:01:09.119> rebounds<00:01:10.040> next<00:01:11.040> thing

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
the net so maybe rebounds next thing

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
skill will be the determining factor in

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.760 
skill will be the determining factor in
winning<00:01:24.600> a<00:01:24.659> faceoff<00:01:24.990> and<00:01:25.259> controlling<00:01:25.680> the

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
winning a faceoff and controlling the

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.679 
winning a faceoff and controlling the
momentum<00:01:26.189> hopefully<00:01:26.520> okay<00:01:27.299> well<00:01:27.450> that's<00:01:27.540> a

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
momentum hopefully okay well that's a

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.230 
momentum hopefully okay well that's a
lot<00:01:27.780> better<00:01:27.930> I<00:01:28.670> was<00:01:29.670> kind<00:01:29.850> of<00:01:29.880> hoping<00:01:30.000> that

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
lot better I was kind of hoping that

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.179 
lot better I was kind of hoping that
they'd<00:01:30.420> add<00:01:30.930> in<00:01:31.170> like<00:01:31.380> being<00:01:31.799> able<00:01:31.920> to<00:01:32.040> get

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
they'd add in like being able to get

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:33.380 
they'd add in like being able to get
tossed<00:01:32.369> out<00:01:32.549> of<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:32.700> faceoff<00:01:33.060> but<00:01:33.210> you<00:01:33.299> know

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
tossed out of the faceoff but you know

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.179 
tossed out of the faceoff but you know
what<00:01:33.509> if<00:01:33.600> they're<00:01:33.720> going<00:01:33.840> to<00:01:33.900> make<00:01:34.049> it<00:01:34.200> so<00:01:34.380> you

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
what if they're going to make it so you

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.410 
what if they're going to make it so you
have<00:01:35.310> a<00:01:35.340> better<00:01:35.549> chance<00:01:35.640> of<00:01:35.939> winning<00:01:36.210> if<00:01:36.329> you

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
have a better chance of winning if you

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.640 
have a better chance of winning if you
actually<00:01:36.540> stay<00:01:36.869> there<00:01:37.049> then<00:01:37.229> you<00:01:37.320> know<00:01:37.409> that's

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
actually stay there then you know that's

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.109 
actually stay there then you know that's
good<00:01:37.829> because<00:01:38.100> that's<00:01:38.280> that's<00:01:38.670> how<00:01:38.790> I<00:01:38.820> like<00:01:39.060> to

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
good because that's that's how I like to

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.600 
good because that's that's how I like to
take<00:01:39.299> faceoffs<00:01:39.710> the<00:01:40.710> next<00:01:40.920> one<00:01:41.040> poke<00:01:41.310> checks

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
take faceoffs the next one poke checks

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.389 
take faceoffs the next one poke checks
and<00:01:41.909> defensive<00:01:42.479> deflections<00:01:43.130> so<00:01:44.130> poke

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
and defensive deflections so poke

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:45.980 
and defensive deflections so poke
checked<00:01:44.640> effectiveness<00:01:45.210> was<00:01:45.750> still<00:01:45.960> very

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
checked effectiveness was still very

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.719 
checked effectiveness was still very
based<00:01:46.380> on<00:01:46.560> a<00:01:46.590> player's<00:01:47.009> stick<00:01:47.369> checking

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
based on a player's stick checking

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.639 
based on a player's stick checking
attributes<00:01:48.210> but<00:01:48.750> we've<00:01:48.930> ensured<00:01:49.140> that<00:01:49.470> poke

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
attributes but we've ensured that poke

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.109 
attributes but we've ensured that poke
checks<00:01:49.890> are<00:01:50.009> less<00:01:50.130> effective<00:01:50.610> if<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:50.880> players

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
checks are less effective if the players

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.450 
checks are less effective if the players
body<00:01:51.360> is<00:01:51.479> not<00:01:51.659> properly<00:01:51.960> aligned<00:01:52.280> so<00:01:53.280> that's

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
body is not properly aligned so that's

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.100 
body is not properly aligned so that's
going<00:01:53.549> to<00:01:53.670> be<00:01:53.729> good<00:01:53.759> because<00:01:54.030> like<00:01:54.780> literally

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
going to be good because like literally

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.660 
going to be good because like literally
you<00:01:55.229> could<00:01:55.470> get<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:55.740> poké<00:01:55.890> puffs<00:01:56.100> from<00:01:56.250> you<00:01:56.460> a

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
you could get the poké puffs from you a

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.340 
you could get the poké puffs from you a
guy<00:01:57.060> would<00:01:57.119> like<00:01:57.270> swing<00:01:57.750> his<00:01:57.930> stick<00:01:58.170> behind

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
guy would like swing his stick behind

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.080 
guy would like swing his stick behind
his<00:01:58.649> back<00:01:58.829> and<00:01:58.890> somehow<00:01:59.340> poke<00:01:59.670> it<00:01:59.820> from<00:01:59.969> you

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
his back and somehow poke it from you

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.330 
his back and somehow poke it from you
like<00:02:00.299> you<00:02:01.140> going<00:02:01.439> the<00:02:01.530> other<00:02:01.560> way<00:02:01.740> it<00:02:02.009> was<00:02:02.130> just

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
like you going the other way it was just

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.370 
like you going the other way it was just
it<00:02:02.490> was<00:02:02.520> a<00:02:02.610> mess<00:02:02.880> just<00:02:03.840> like<00:02:03.930> real<00:02:04.170> hockey

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
it was a mess just like real hockey

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.719 
it was a mess just like real hockey
players<00:02:04.680> will<00:02:04.860> be<00:02:04.979> stronger<00:02:05.280> when<00:02:05.520> they<00:02:05.610> were

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
players will be stronger when they were

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.490 
players will be stronger when they were
balanced<00:02:06.270> on<00:02:06.360> their<00:02:06.479> skates<00:02:06.750> and<00:02:06.930> poking<00:02:07.229> in

the area directly in front of them

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:13.120

okay in NHL 14 speed is now much more of

makes double contact alright makes sense

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.090 
makes double contact alright makes sense
yeah<00:02:43.880> so<00:02:44.240> I'm<00:02:44.990> so<00:02:45.230> happy<00:02:45.440> they<00:02:45.620> did<00:02:45.770> that<00:02:45.890> i

actually had like attempted to try doing

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.750 
actually had like attempted to try doing
stick<00:02:53.510> checks<00:02:53.780> with<00:02:53.990> like<00:02:54.470> like<00:02:55.130> sticks<00:02:55.550> that

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
stick checks with like like sticks that

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.150 
stick checks with like like sticks that
were<00:02:55.850> active<00:02:56.240> to<00:02:56.420> so<00:02:56.810> like<00:02:57.080> but<00:02:57.620> they<00:02:57.710> said<00:02:57.890> the

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
were active to so like but they said the

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.220 
were active to so like but they said the
gameplay<00:02:58.610> was<00:02:58.820> just<00:02:59.030> totally<00:02:59.750> screwed<00:02:59.810> up<00:03:00.110> so

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
gameplay was just totally screwed up so

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.050 
gameplay was just totally screwed up so
like<00:03:00.350> sticks<00:03:01.130> go<00:03:01.310> through<00:03:01.520> sticks<00:03:01.820> for<00:03:02.030> a

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
like sticks go through sticks for a

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.450 
like sticks go through sticks for a
reason<00:03:02.390> and<00:03:02.540> i<00:03:02.660> understand<00:03:03.170> that<00:03:03.260> i<00:03:03.530> could<00:03:04.310> see

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:04.460 
reason and i understand that i could see

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:06.430 
reason and i understand that i could see
it<00:03:04.550> being<00:03:04.580> a<00:03:04.850> big<00:03:05.000> issue<00:03:05.210> that<00:03:05.540> sticks<00:03:06.140> hitting

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
it being a big issue that sticks hitting

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.470 
it being a big issue that sticks hitting
sticks<00:03:06.710> all<00:03:06.860> the<00:03:07.010> time<00:03:07.160> because<00:03:07.370> yeah<00:03:08.300> they

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
sticks all the time because yeah they

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.000 
sticks all the time because yeah they
said<00:03:08.660> they<00:03:08.750> tried<00:03:08.960> it<00:03:09.140> and<00:03:09.230> they<00:03:09.320> just<00:03:09.350> really

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
said they tried it and they just really

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:11.290 
said they tried it and they just really
slow<00:03:10.190> the<00:03:10.340> game<00:03:10.490> down<00:03:10.550> they<00:03:10.850> made<00:03:10.970> it<00:03:11.090> like

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:11.300 
slow the game down they made it like

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:13.630 
slow the game down they made it like
really<00:03:11.840> bad<00:03:11.990> so<00:03:12.770> yeah<00:03:13.010> you<00:03:13.070> know<00:03:13.280> what<00:03:13.430> they

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640 
really bad so yeah you know what they

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.510 
really bad so yeah you know what they
tested<00:03:14.060> it<00:03:14.150> understandable<00:03:14.870> whatever<00:03:15.520> the

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:16.520 
tested it understandable whatever the

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:19.600 
tested it understandable whatever the
last<00:03:16.700> thing<00:03:16.910> passing<00:03:17.690> and<00:03:17.840> puck<00:03:17.990> pickups<00:03:18.610> so

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:19.610 
last thing passing and puck pickups so

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:22.060 
last thing passing and puck pickups so
this<00:03:19.850> fixes<00:03:20.420> ensure<00:03:20.870> it's<00:03:21.500> easier<00:03:21.770> to<00:03:21.890> pass

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:22.070 
this fixes ensure it's easier to pass

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:23.830 
this fixes ensure it's easier to pass
the<00:03:22.310> stationary<00:03:22.760> players<00:03:23.030> okay<00:03:23.510> that's<00:03:23.690> going

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
the stationary players okay that's going

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.230 
the stationary players okay that's going
to<00:03:23.930> get<00:03:23.990> less<00:03:24.620> offsides<00:03:25.130> on<00:03:25.430> passes<00:03:25.940> near<00:03:26.150> the

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:26.240 
to get less offsides on passes near the

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:28.240 
to get less offsides on passes near the
blue<00:03:26.360> line<00:03:26.570> now<00:03:27.020> the<00:03:27.080> receiver<00:03:27.710> will<00:03:27.800> turn<00:03:28.100> to

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
blue line now the receiver will turn to

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:29.890 
blue line now the receiver will turn to
face<00:03:28.370> the<00:03:28.430> past<00:03:28.730> rather<00:03:29.060> than<00:03:29.240> pull<00:03:29.480> back<00:03:29.690> to

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
face the past rather than pull back to

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:31.630 
face the past rather than pull back to
their<00:03:30.020> generic<00:03:30.350> stance<00:03:30.710> and<00:03:30.920> inadvertently

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:31.640 
their generic stance and inadvertently

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.880 
their generic stance and inadvertently
go<00:03:32.180> off<00:03:32.300> side<00:03:32.540> so<00:03:33.170> that's<00:03:33.320> good<00:03:33.500> so<00:03:33.650> players

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:33.890 
go off side so that's good so players

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:35.200 
go off side so that's good so players
are<00:03:34.040> actually<00:03:34.280> going<00:03:34.370> to<00:03:34.460> turn<00:03:34.670> towards<00:03:35.090> the

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:35.210 
are actually going to turn towards the

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:38.080 
are actually going to turn towards the
past<00:03:35.420> that's<00:03:35.660> awesome<00:03:36.250> on<00:03:37.250> fake<00:03:37.550> slap<00:03:37.820> shots

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
past that's awesome on fake slap shots

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:39.780 
past that's awesome on fake slap shots
the<00:03:38.270> puck<00:03:38.450> is<00:03:38.690> now<00:03:38.900> much<00:03:39.170> more<00:03:39.350> seamless

the puck is now much more seamless

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.190 
the puck is now much more seamless
previously<00:03:40.790> the<00:03:40.940> player<00:03:41.150> would<00:03:41.390> often<00:03:41.870> fumble

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
previously the player would often fumble

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.010 
previously the player would often fumble
the<00:03:42.260> puck<00:03:42.440> when<00:03:42.710> required<00:03:43.070> reacquiring<00:03:43.730> it

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:44.020 
the puck when required reacquiring it

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:47.260
