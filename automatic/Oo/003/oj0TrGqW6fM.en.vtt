so slicing saltwater sandals can get a
little<00:00:06.210> bit<00:00:06.330> confusing<00:00:06.750> because<00:00:07.109> they're

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
little bit confusing because they're

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.350 
little bit confusing because they're
sized<00:00:07.680> by<00:00:07.890> youth<00:00:08.130> sizing<00:00:08.670> and<00:00:08.970> not<00:00:09.120> women

sized by youth sizing and not women

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.749 
sized by youth sizing and not women
sizing<00:00:09.990> which<00:00:10.620> basically<00:00:10.980> means<00:00:11.400> that<00:00:11.580> the

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
sizing which basically means that the

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.669 
sizing which basically means that the
size<00:00:12.330> of<00:00:12.450> the<00:00:12.540> sole<00:00:12.719> is<00:00:12.929> going<00:00:13.139> to<00:00:13.200> be<00:00:13.320> two

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
size of the sole is going to be two

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.369 
size of the sole is going to be two
sizes<00:00:14.160> smaller<00:00:14.639> than<00:00:14.940> the<00:00:15.420> size<00:00:15.570> you<00:00:15.929> actually

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
sizes smaller than the size you actually

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.349 
sizes smaller than the size you actually
need<00:00:16.590> the<00:00:17.100> Box<00:00:17.310> does<00:00:17.550> specify<00:00:17.850> this

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
need the Box does specify this

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:19.970 
need the Box does specify this
difference<00:00:18.720> in<00:00:18.900> sizing<00:00:19.350> so<00:00:19.560> you'll<00:00:19.740> notice

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
difference in sizing so you'll notice

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:20.900 
difference in sizing so you'll notice
that<00:00:20.100> on<00:00:20.369> the<00:00:20.520> box

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
that on the box

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.000 
that on the box
the<00:00:21.359> youth<00:00:21.570> size<00:00:21.810> comes<00:00:22.109> first<00:00:22.439> and<00:00:22.769> then<00:00:22.890> the

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
the youth size comes first and then the

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.070 
the youth size comes first and then the
women's<00:00:23.340> size<00:00:23.550> comes<00:00:23.939> second<00:00:24.570> if<00:00:24.660> you<00:00:24.930> are<00:00:25.050> a

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
women's size comes second if you are a

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.349 
women's size comes second if you are a
half-size<00:00:25.410> we<00:00:26.279> do<00:00:26.460> recommend<00:00:26.730> going<00:00:27.029> a<00:00:27.180> size

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
half-size we do recommend going a size

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.089 
half-size we do recommend going a size
up<00:00:27.570> because<00:00:27.779> if<00:00:27.900> you<00:00:27.990> go<00:00:28.080> a<00:00:28.109> size<00:00:28.349> down<00:00:28.680> it's

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
up because if you go a size down it's

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.740 
up because if you go a size down it's
going<00:00:29.250> to<00:00:29.310> be<00:00:29.460> way<00:00:29.789> too<00:00:29.849> small<00:00:30.179> for<00:00:30.240> you<00:00:30.510> I'll

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
you first put them on so a really easy

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.150 
you first put them on so a really easy
way<00:00:57.780> to<00:00:57.809> get<00:00:58.199> them<00:00:58.350> to<00:00:58.440> stretch<00:00:58.710> out<00:00:58.859> quickly

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
way to get them to stretch out quickly

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.459 
way to get them to stretch out quickly
is<00:00:59.489> to<00:01:00.030> soak<00:01:00.239> them<00:01:00.359> in<00:01:00.480> water<00:01:00.719> for<00:01:00.840> about<00:01:01.079> five

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
is to soak them in water for about five

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.380 
is to soak them in water for about five
minutes<00:01:01.710> and<00:01:02.039> then<00:01:02.219> walk<00:01:02.730> in<00:01:02.879> them<00:01:03.000> until<00:01:03.300> they

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
minutes and then walk in them until they

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.299 
minutes and then walk in them until they
dry<00:01:03.629> and<00:01:03.899> this<00:01:04.439> will<00:01:04.589> help<00:01:04.769> to<00:01:04.890> stretch<00:01:05.129> out

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
dry and this will help to stretch out

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:06.770 
dry and this will help to stretch out
the<00:01:05.339> sandal<00:01:05.729> so<00:01:05.880> that<00:01:06.030> they're<00:01:06.180> not<00:01:06.360> too<00:01:06.570> tight

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
the sandal so that they're not too tight

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.780 
the sandal so that they're not too tight
but<00:01:07.320> also<00:01:07.650> get<00:01:07.860> them<00:01:08.010> to<00:01:08.100> mold<00:01:08.310> to<00:01:08.430> your<00:01:08.460> feet

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
but also get them to mold to your feet

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:09.950 
but also get them to mold to your feet
so<00:01:08.970> that<00:01:09.000> they're<00:01:09.270> comfortable<00:01:09.450> when<00:01:09.869> you

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
so that they're comfortable when you

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.539 
so that they're comfortable when you
walk<00:01:10.110> in<00:01:10.260> them<00:01:10.380> this<00:01:10.650> works<00:01:10.860> really<00:01:11.040> well<00:01:11.310> with

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
walk in them this works really well with

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.190 
walk in them this works really well with
the<00:01:11.670> toddler<00:01:11.880> saltwater<00:01:12.420> sandals<00:01:12.869> as<00:01:12.990> well

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
the toddler saltwater sandals as well

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.010 
the toddler saltwater sandals as well
because<00:01:13.950> toddlers<00:01:14.310> do<00:01:14.700> have<00:01:14.970> wider<00:01:15.479> feet<00:01:15.780> or

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
because toddlers do have wider feet or

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.100 
because toddlers do have wider feet or
chubby<00:01:16.380> feet<00:01:16.619> and<00:01:17.479> sometimes<00:01:18.479> it's<00:01:18.840> kind<00:01:19.049> of

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
chubby feet and sometimes it's kind of

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.630 
chubby feet and sometimes it's kind of
hard<00:01:19.320> to<00:01:19.409> get<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:19.770> saltwater<00:01:20.009> sandals<00:01:20.490> on

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
hard to get the saltwater sandals on

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.640 
hard to get the saltwater sandals on
them<00:01:20.939> at<00:01:21.119> first<00:01:21.330> so<00:01:21.930> this<00:01:22.110> method<00:01:22.350> really

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
them at first so this method really

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.350 
them at first so this method really
helps<00:01:23.040> to<00:01:23.130> stretch<00:01:23.400> them<00:01:23.640> out<00:01:23.759> quickly<00:01:24.060> so

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
helps to stretch them out quickly so

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.359 
helps to stretch them out quickly so
that<00:01:24.509> your<00:01:24.659> toddler<00:01:24.990> can<00:01:25.259> wear<00:01:25.530> them<00:01:25.740> that

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
that your toddler can wear them that

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:37.730 
that your toddler can wear them that
same<00:01:26.640> day<00:01:35.299> and<00:01:36.299> that's<00:01:36.509> pretty<00:01:36.900> much<00:01:37.110> it<00:01:37.380> if

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
same day and that's pretty much it if

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.140
