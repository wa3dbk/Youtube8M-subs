00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:27.960
 Reflected in your eyes, The street was quiet, 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:34.840
 I've been waiting for this meeting, And she was saying goodbye. 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:42.000
 A flock of leaves fell at his feet, And the rain was filled with laughter, 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:48.660
 At the fall after you closed, White curtain of wet snow. 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.480
 I remember the snow close-up eyes Wind bent his head around me 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.379
 Eve didn't have to die Sealy 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:02.979
 Put your hands down. 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:09.200
 And when the wind stopped, With all that was possible 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:16.620
 The snow melted on my cheeks, Falling at his feet. 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:28.700
 And I am alone on an empty road, And if you still celebrate somewhere in the neighborhood, 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.320
 Touch me look 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.930
 And I will do everything needed, 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:45.070
 If you are still somewhere in the area with me. 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:52.800
 It all seemed so simple, who made a mistake, 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:02:01.020
 This sky I remember another, Remembering your smile, 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:07.120
 The leaves fall on my shoulders, approaching cold evening, 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:14.020
 Word from our new meeting, The yards scatter wind. 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:27.700
 And I am empty of a nadoroge If you still celebrate somewhere in the neighborhood, 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:34.900
 Touch me watch And I will do everything needed, 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:40.600
 If you are still somewhere in the area with me. 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:13.020
 Touch me watch And I will do everything needed, 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:18.860
 If you are still somewhere in the area with me. 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:25.500
 If you are still somewhere in the area with me. 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:32.040
 If you are still somewhere in the area.
