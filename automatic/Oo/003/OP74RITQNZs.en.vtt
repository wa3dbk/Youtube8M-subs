00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:12.080
 hello today begins but of 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:15.389
 Basil then basilica 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:19.470
 pure people opal is a basic black 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:22.439
 or then basil basil 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.070
 big glass that like that I mattress the 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.820
 Mark 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:30.929
 Here then this one I'm going 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:34.380
 a mixture of both so as to have some 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:38.280
 different condiments then for that 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:40.230
 it's very simple I chose two 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.510
 against pots of this size because 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.420
 that it seems to me more simple player puts 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.500
 many and it will make little ones 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.379
 diplomas I could transplant 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.079
 directly in the ground so inside 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.570
 begun to compost a contribution 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.460
 present of potting soil as you find 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.960
 in the trade 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:03.059
 so I already wanted to do I'm going 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:07.290
 Here we begin to move properly 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:09.060
 the fund sees there we add a small 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.360
 little because they really have to 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:16.950
 have a film just a thin layer 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:21.060
 between the seed the potting soil its value 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.810
 added a lot above that so 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.930
 we make a dirty 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:30.479
 then we will start with the black 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:31.650
 basic black we take a little bit of 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.590
 grain then you pay attention I 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:37.829
 am tiny grain and there is no 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:44.270
 need to put a lot and everything 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:44.270
 we have just delicately deposited 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:55.640
 we repeat the identical operation for 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.960
 other then if you have seeds left 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:01.420
 you can use them 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:04.550
 the year after it's not it's not sexy 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.450
 this is simply with the hand you 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:07.100
 try to put some 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.340
 that it is very homogeneous furrowed by 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.900
 all then reminds you that it takes 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:15.470
 talk about too much otherwise you'll go 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.300
 find with plenty of basil and the 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:21.410
 Basilica 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:23.600
 it grows almost all summer and 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:26.710
 blow if you have two three feet well 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.710
 stuffed that's enough 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:37.310
 here is once this operation 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:38.600
 the leaf is simply you come back 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:43.220
 give a little layer of potting soil 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:56.330
 on top of you tamp and so on 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:59.600
 the others we cup and that's it over 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:02.330
 you have more than one rosÃ© to put your 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:04.100
 pots in a warm and cozy greenhouse 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:06.830
 you will see in 15 days 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:09.800
 your basilica will be quietly 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:12.110
 then I will put them back in the ground but 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:14.300
 if you are if I had a balcony or 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:15.950
 anything you can very well 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:17.480
 leave them alone in this case 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:20.709
 expected taxes maybe a little bit more 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:24.580
 large so that racing can 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:26.540
 benefited well and you can have 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:29.360
 whether in your garden or on 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.170
 your balcony or in your kitchen some 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.170
 basic 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:35.890
 all summer long see you soon for 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.890
