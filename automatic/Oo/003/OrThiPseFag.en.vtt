move<00:01:36.960> forward<00:01:37.140> with<00:01:37.380> it<00:01:37.500> and<00:01:37.619> I<00:01:37.829> think<00:01:37.890> that<00:01:38.040> a

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
move forward with it and I think that a

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.710 
move forward with it and I think that a
quick<00:01:38.430> only<00:01:38.549> I'm<00:01:38.790> not<00:01:39.000> saying<00:01:39.390> that<00:01:39.479> it<00:01:39.600> maybe

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
quick only I'm not saying that it maybe

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.179 
quick only I'm not saying that it maybe
wasn't<00:01:40.079> a<00:01:40.259> little<00:01:40.470> quick<00:01:40.619> what<00:01:40.829> he<00:01:40.920> did<00:01:41.070> but

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
wasn't a little quick what he did but

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:42.980 
wasn't a little quick what he did but
maybe<00:01:41.310> he's<00:01:41.520> doing<00:01:41.640> it<00:01:41.850> in<00:01:41.909> honor<00:01:42.180> of<00:01:42.329> Randy's

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
maybe he's doing it in honor of Randy's

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.120 
maybe he's doing it in honor of Randy's
cuz<00:01:43.110> Ramos<00:01:43.409> was<00:01:43.530> a<00:01:43.590> big<00:01:43.710> believer<00:01:43.920> in<00:01:44.070> the

find<00:04:47.860> the<00:04:47.950> perfect<00:04:48.100> line<00:04:48.400> and<00:04:48.640> I<00:04:48.670> think<00:04:48.700> that

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.030 
find the perfect line and I think that

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:50.340 
find the perfect line and I think that
if<00:04:49.180> they<00:04:49.300> got<00:04:49.450> something<00:04:49.690> like<00:04:49.870> that's<00:04:50.230> why<00:04:50.320> I

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:50.350 
if they got something like that's why I

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:51.360 
if they got something like that's why I
think<00:04:50.560> Raimi<00:04:50.740> would<00:04:50.920> be<00:04:51.010> a<00:04:51.040> great<00:04:51.220> choice

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:51.370 
think Raimi would be a great choice

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:52.860 
think Raimi would be a great choice
because<00:04:51.430> he<00:04:51.730> can<00:04:51.970> he<00:04:52.240> could<00:04:52.390> walk<00:04:52.510> that<00:04:52.720> line

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:52.870 
because he can he could walk that line

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:54.780 
because he can he could walk that line
pretty<00:04:53.050> well<00:04:53.230> tune<00:04:53.740> the<00:04:53.860> Bucks<00:04:54.040> ready<00:04:54.550> to<00:04:54.640> go

pretty well tune the Bucks ready to go

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:57.120 
pretty well tune the Bucks ready to go
