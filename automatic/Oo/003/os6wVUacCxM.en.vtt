00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
dishes for cleaning and maybe it's not

usable<00:00:54.809> anymore<00:00:55.110> buy<00:00:55.559> some<00:00:55.770> new<00:00:55.890> ones<00:00:56.039> I<00:00:56.370> think

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
not sure but I bet you could I think the

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.160 
not sure but I bet you could I think the
gloves<00:01:05.939> that<00:01:06.090> I<00:01:06.150> have<00:01:06.270> came<00:01:06.450> for<00:01:06.630> Walmart<00:01:06.810> so

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
gloves that I have came for Walmart so

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.370 
gloves that I have came for Walmart so
anyway<00:01:07.950> what<00:01:08.250> we're<00:01:08.369> gonna<00:01:08.460> do<00:01:08.729> is<00:01:09.380> we're

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
anyway what we're gonna do is we're

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.170 
anyway what we're gonna do is we're
gonna<00:01:10.439> cut<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:11.250> fingers<00:01:11.549> off<00:01:11.700> for<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:11.909> gloves

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
gonna cut the fingers off for the gloves

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.910 
gonna cut the fingers off for the gloves
and<00:01:12.659> make<00:01:12.960> them<00:01:13.110> into<00:01:13.290> little<00:01:13.320> individual

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
and make them into little individual

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.609 
and make them into little individual
finger<00:01:14.220> puppets<00:01:14.610> so<00:01:15.080> because<00:01:16.080> they<00:01:16.229> are<00:01:16.259> a

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
finger puppets so because they are a

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.320 
finger puppets so because they are a
latex<00:01:16.979> they're<00:01:17.369> not<00:01:17.520> going<00:01:17.700> to<00:01:17.729> Ravel<00:01:18.060> so<00:01:18.240> we

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
latex they're not going to Ravel so we

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.539 
latex they're not going to Ravel so we
don't<00:01:18.479> have<00:01:18.570> to<00:01:18.720> worry<00:01:18.900> about<00:01:19.189> finishing<00:01:20.189> off

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
don't have to worry about finishing off

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:21.830 
don't have to worry about finishing off
the<00:01:20.729> edges<00:01:21.000> so<00:01:21.150> let's<00:01:21.360> start<00:01:21.600> with<00:01:21.689> this

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
the edges so let's start with this

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.210 
the edges so let's start with this
little<00:01:21.900> pinky<00:01:22.439> one<00:01:22.619> we're<00:01:22.920> just<00:01:23.040> going<00:01:23.189> to

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
little pinky one we're just going to

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.200 
little pinky one we're just going to
snip<00:01:23.520> it<00:01:23.549> off<00:01:23.729> just<00:01:24.060> like<00:01:24.210> that<00:01:24.770> like<00:01:25.770> that<00:01:26.210> how

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
snip it off just like that like that how

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.789 
snip it off just like that like that how
easy<00:01:27.240> would<00:01:27.630> that<00:01:27.780> be<00:01:27.930> for<00:01:28.080> a<00:01:28.140> child<00:01:28.409> to<00:01:28.470> put<00:01:28.650> on

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
easy would that be for a child to put on

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.560 
easy would that be for a child to put on
there<00:01:28.979> no<00:01:29.670> finger<00:01:30.090> and<00:01:30.270> so<00:01:32.240> we<00:01:33.240> could<00:01:33.420> make

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
there no finger and so we could make

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.749 
there no finger and so we could make
these<00:01:33.780> you<00:01:34.590> have<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.860> child<00:01:35.130> make<00:01:35.340> these<00:01:35.520> they

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
these you have the child make these they

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.609 
these you have the child make these they
could<00:01:35.820> draw<00:01:36.030> a<00:01:36.060> little<00:01:36.210> face<00:01:36.329> on<00:01:36.720> it<00:01:36.900> got<00:01:37.380> some

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.320 

maybe<00:01:58.110> we're<00:01:58.290> gonna<00:01:58.380> give<00:01:58.620> it

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:02.330 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.730 

so<00:02:03.330> I<00:02:03.360> don't<00:02:03.600> know<00:02:03.660> if<00:02:03.750> you<00:02:03.840> can<00:02:04.020> see<00:02:04.290> that<00:02:04.440> very

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
so I don't know if you can see that very

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.100 
so I don't know if you can see that very
well<00:02:04.830> or<00:02:05.130> not<00:02:05.280> but<00:02:05.730> there<00:02:06.600> would<00:02:06.720> be<00:02:06.750> one<00:02:06.870> right

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
well or not but there would be one right

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:13.580 
well or not but there would be one right
there<00:02:07.350> but<00:02:07.590> probably<00:02:08.220> also<00:02:08.640> drop<00:02:10.160> hey<00:02:12.590> I've

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
there but probably also drop hey I've

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.170 
there but probably also drop hey I've
got<00:02:13.740> these<00:02:13.860> little<00:02:13.920> ultrafine<00:02:14.610> sharpies<00:02:15.060> if

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
got these little ultrafine sharpies if

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.690 
got these little ultrafine sharpies if
you<00:02:15.270> had<00:02:15.420> their<00:02:15.630> the<00:02:16.290> the<00:02:17.160> fine<00:02:17.370> ones<00:02:17.580> that

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
you had their the the fine ones that

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.820 
you had their the the fine ones that
probably<00:02:17.850> work<00:02:18.150> a<00:02:18.270> lot<00:02:18.420> easier<00:02:18.870> I<00:02:19.050> think<00:02:19.740> you

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
probably work a lot easier I think you

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.440 
probably work a lot easier I think you
kind<00:02:20.040> of<00:02:20.100> get<00:02:20.280> the<00:02:20.430> idea<00:02:20.460> you<00:02:21.180> can<00:02:21.330> draw

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
kind of get the idea you can draw

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.920 
kind of get the idea you can draw
different<00:02:21.510> faces<00:02:22.140> on<00:02:22.320> it<00:02:22.350> so<00:02:23.540> each<00:02:24.540> one<00:02:24.780> could

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
different faces on it so each one could

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.720 
different faces on it so each one could
be<00:02:25.050> the<00:02:25.170> same<00:02:25.380> way<00:02:25.500> just<00:02:25.770> slip<00:02:26.040> them<00:02:26.160> right<00:02:26.460> off

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
be the same way just slip them right off

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.940 
be the same way just slip them right off
and<00:02:28.070> stick<00:02:29.070> them<00:02:29.190> on<00:02:29.430> your<00:02:29.460> finger<00:02:30.620> as<00:02:31.620> a<00:02:31.680> way

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
and stick them on your finger as a way

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.310 
and stick them on your finger as a way
to<00:02:32.060> have<00:02:33.060> a<00:02:33.090> nice<00:02:33.270> basis<00:02:33.720> for<00:02:33.870> drawing<00:02:33.990> those

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
to have a nice basis for drawing those

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.680 
to have a nice basis for drawing those
um<00:02:34.590> faces<00:02:35.490> on<00:02:35.670> there<00:02:35.910> and<00:02:36.120> then<00:02:36.240> of<00:02:36.660> course

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
um faces on there and then of course

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.000 
um faces on there and then of course
once<00:02:37.050> you're<00:02:37.140> ready<00:02:37.260> to<00:02:37.350> use<00:02:37.470> them<00:02:37.650> what<00:02:37.890> about

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
once you're ready to use them what about

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.830 
once you're ready to use them what about
