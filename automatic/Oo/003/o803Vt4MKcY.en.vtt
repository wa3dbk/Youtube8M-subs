00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.179
 good afternoon everyone I'm drik and 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.810
 I come here to present a new trick 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:05.810
 help life 

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:11.760
 this group is opening with rebound in 

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:11.760
 the handle 81 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:26.480
 well I've seen how it is by the way 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:27.859
 I'm using 42 seems trick 2 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:32.839
 process this trick 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:34.250
 It's a different and novelty because 

00:00:32.839 --> 00:00:37.670
 it's the first trick I'm going to do with 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:41.239
 a rebound in a handle instead of a 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:43.570
 pot on the sheet how can you do it by 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:46.590
 custom until now 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:49.000
 and second is a trick that I was 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.250
 experiencing and not having a closure 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.080
 own unfortunately or at least even 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:56.520
 it has not occurred to me if someone has 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.520
 an idea how to do it 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:02.769
 Well, that gave me a clue because I still 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:04.509
 I have not got it right yet it's still a 

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:07.060
 trick even if you have those two 

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:08.740
 characteristics I would continue to put in 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.740
 the beginner category because it is 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:14.110
 pretty simple for this trick 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:16.570
 I will also explain myself in profile 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:20.020
 because it's going to be easier 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:22.440
 okay for initial session for a little bit 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.440
 more light 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.900
 initial position is the horizontal and 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.240
 let's have this is on the handle no 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.460
 it's safe in a standard butterfly not 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.340
 modified is the one with the latch 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.460
 I remember 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:47.090
 first movement are two movements in 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:50.909
 truth is going to consist of one lifting the 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:53.689
 sure side towards here it's worth 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:56.840
 so better but the time we do this 

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:59.270
 put your index finger here 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:03.320
 the only risk of this figure is in 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:05.710
 this movement that if you do not raise this 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:08.679
 with enough force 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:10.810
 and it will not be up because you can go back 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:13.060
 to fall and I remember that this as you see 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.850
 is the side is not safe and if by 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:19.360
 misfortune the egg bounced against this 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:21.970
 then you are going to cut that yes of a 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.890
 fall here here they do not make a very cut 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:27.190
 deep but the risk is still 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:30.400
 there are accesses I'll recap it again 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:32.739
 if anything brass horizontal position a 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.989
 sure up we lift the side 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:36.770
 the insurance close up and we put 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:40.250
 the tip finger 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:43.640
 once it is here we take the clamp 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:47.150
 index finger of the safe handle 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.470
 in this way it is worth basically we have 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.170
 given a half turn to the knife and 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:54.680
 we changed the grip of this this 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:56.230
 handle to another very simple voucher and the 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:00.850
 second movement comes here 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.850
 basically we are going to rotate the wrist 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:08.450
 thus 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:11.270
 and once here we are going to position the 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:16.460
 thumb index in the typical way of 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:19.410
 clamp on the handle to be able to do so 

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:22.470
 I'll explain it again and in more detail 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:26.850
 brass horizontal position or the insurance 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:28.680
 up we hold it like this we let 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:31.860
 let go of the thief sure we put the finger 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:35.850
 index we raise it like this 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:39.230
 we thumbed over 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:43.000
 let's go the unsafe side 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:46.720
 we have the clip right now so you 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.720
 we turn the wrist 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:51.140
 and now that we do that is practical 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:55.310
 do the other things at the same time but with 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:57.800
 practice we make the index finger be 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:59.720
 put below you have to do 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:02.840
 other things rotate the wrist so that 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:06.380
 turn downwards and then turn your fingers 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:09.270
 to make this closing this opening 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:11.810
 forgiveness is worth 

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:15.319
 complication in this movement 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:17.200
 you have to do it with rhythm and I explain 

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:20.640
 why 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:23.440
 once we got here by turning the wrist 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:26.470
 this handle is the one in your hand 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:28.660
 importance in this figure is going to have 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:30.610
 a certain speed and moving what is 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:33.160
 what happens if we do not follow if not 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:36.970
 we accompany with the doll 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:38.560
 to the rhythm of the mango stella movement 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:41.650
 the movement this handle is going to 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:43.330
 interrupt which is going to do that for 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:46.020
 do the second part of movement that 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:48.090
 is to lift will have to force 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:49.979
 the ideal is obviously with practice and 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:53.190
 know what razor we are doing 

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:55.560
 is to know at what speed the handle is not 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:57.330
 it's safe to basically accompany 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:58.860
 as it should 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.720
 it's how everything has been done 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:02.849
 chained but for example wrong I'm going to 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:04.919
 try to do it wrong 

00:05:02.849 --> 00:05:05.969
 good to start something else also the 

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:08.909
 that you can stay as I am 

00:05:05.969 --> 00:05:10.529
 doing I will not take time off the fingers 

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:12.929
 under the second handle interrupt is 

00:05:10.529 --> 00:05:15.360
 this here but for example I'm still in 

00:05:12.929 --> 00:05:18.569
 this attempt we do so mango 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:20.369
 too much around here I have to get out of the 

00:05:18.569 --> 00:05:23.939
 nothing again a movement to do 

00:05:20.369 --> 00:05:27.240
 well when in truth if I did it with a 

00:05:23.939 --> 00:05:29.819
 apace and freeze the wrist 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:32.580
 you can get the handle down 

00:05:29.819 --> 00:05:35.099
 sure and pick it up again 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:36.760
 then practice reliable the pace at 

00:05:35.099 --> 00:05:39.370
 movement 

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:42.520
 and that's it and do not fear as you are seeing 

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:45.730
 what I'm going to do now from the face of 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:47.800
 exaggerate a lot the doll movement this 

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:50.040
 It helps a lot to catch the rhythm 

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:53.750
 figure 

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:56.630
 and make it not be forced 

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:59.210
 it's a very simple thing but that as 

00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:01.010
 all figures because it requires practice 

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:02.990
 you see for example here I do not read I did not do it 

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:05.090
 very well be it half standing here the handle 

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:07.610
 and I've had to build it so 

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:10.190
 with things that good if you want to do the 

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:12.560
 figure of the best possible so that's why 

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:16.040
 what to try to avoid inside what fits 

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:17.420
 ok I hope you liked it and 

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:20.500
 I will keep making videos of this thanks 

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:20.500
 by looking and even the reaction
