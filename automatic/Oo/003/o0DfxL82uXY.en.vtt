00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.540 
future soldier lowdown being set in 2025
there's<00:00:37.260> plenty<00:00:37.559> of<00:00:37.590> weapons<00:00:37.800> in-game<00:00:38.309> that

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
there's plenty of weapons in-game that

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.220 
there's plenty of weapons in-game that
would<00:00:38.640> be<00:00:38.760> a<00:00:38.790> perfect<00:00:39.300> fit<00:00:39.540> for<00:00:39.600> this<00:00:39.809> loadout

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
would be a perfect fit for this loadout

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.760 
would be a perfect fit for this loadout
my<00:00:40.950> first<00:00:41.250> choice<00:00:41.640> was<00:00:41.910> that<00:00:41.940> m8a1<00:00:42.600> rifle<00:00:43.320> with

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
my first choice was that m8a1 rifle with

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.590 
my first choice was that m8a1 rifle with
its<00:00:43.920> pretty<00:00:44.160> futuristic<00:00:44.550> variants<00:00:45.239> but<00:00:45.480> then

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
its pretty futuristic variants but then

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.139 
its pretty futuristic variants but then
I<00:00:45.629> thought<00:00:45.840> well<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.350> m8a1<00:00:46.739> is<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.250> xm8<00:00:47.760> by

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
I thought well the m8a1 is the xm8 by

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.660 
I thought well the m8a1 is the xm8 by
H&amp;K<00:00:48.870> and<00:00:49.440> it's<00:00:49.559> actually<00:00:49.860> available<00:00:49.950> in<00:00:50.520> real

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
H&amp;K and it's actually available in real

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.540 
H&amp;K and it's actually available in real
life<00:00:50.940> and<00:00:51.300> it's<00:00:51.420> been<00:00:51.570> made<00:00:51.840> since<00:00:52.230> 2003<00:00:53.160> so

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
life and it's been made since 2003 so

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.790 
life and it's been made since 2003 so
while<00:00:54.360> it<00:00:54.449> looks<00:00:54.629> like<00:00:54.780> an<00:00:54.930> alien<00:00:55.050> weapon<00:00:55.680> in

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
while it looks like an alien weapon in

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.200 
while it looks like an alien weapon in
appearance<00:00:56.250> it<00:00:56.430> doesn't<00:00:56.640> really<00:00:56.760> fit<00:00:57.030> this

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
appearance it doesn't really fit this

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.450 
appearance it doesn't really fit this
lowdown<00:00:57.949> otherwise<00:00:58.949> we've<00:00:59.160> got<00:00:59.280> some

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
lowdown otherwise we've got some

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.240 
lowdown otherwise we've got some
conceptual<00:01:00.030> weapons<00:01:00.539> like<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:00.840> pdw-57<00:01:01.649> and

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
conceptual weapons like the pdw-57 and

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.820 
conceptual weapons like the pdw-57 and
that<00:01:02.340> new<00:01:02.520> peacekeeper<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.870> PDW<00:01:04.470> is<00:01:04.589> pretty

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
that new peacekeeper the PDW is pretty

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.980 
that new peacekeeper the PDW is pretty
much<00:01:04.979> based<00:01:05.250> on<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.549> p90<00:01:06.270> and<00:01:06.780> that

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
much based on the p90 and that

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.510 
much based on the p90 and that
peacekeeper<00:01:07.530> looks<00:01:07.830> pretty<00:01:08.070> similar<00:01:08.280> to<00:01:08.490> a

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
peacekeeper looks pretty similar to a

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.890 
peacekeeper looks pretty similar to a
lot<00:01:08.670> of<00:01:08.729> modern-day<00:01:09.299> weapons

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
lot of modern-day weapons

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.170 
lot of modern-day weapons
so<00:01:10.680> after<00:01:10.860> plenty<00:01:11.159> of<00:01:11.250> consideration<00:01:12.030> and

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
so after plenty of consideration and

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.210 
so after plenty of consideration and
aiming<00:01:12.479> and<00:01:12.689> airing<00:01:12.990> I<00:01:13.229> decided<00:01:13.770> to<00:01:14.040> go<00:01:14.189> with

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
aiming and airing I decided to go with

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.910 
aiming and airing I decided to go with
the<00:01:14.580> SMR<00:01:15.180> assault<00:01:15.600> rifle<00:01:15.990> which<00:01:16.320> is<00:01:16.439> based<00:01:16.710> on

the SMR assault rifle which is based on

then<00:01:43.170> I<00:01:43.259> thought<00:01:43.439> a<00:01:43.590> selector<00:01:44.009> switch<00:01:44.250> is

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
then I thought a selector switch is

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.490 
then I thought a selector switch is
nothing<00:01:44.729> really<00:01:44.880> futuristic<00:01:45.720> and<00:01:46.229> we<00:01:46.350> could

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
nothing really futuristic and we could

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.109 
nothing really futuristic and we could
argue<00:01:46.619> that<00:01:46.860> any<00:01:47.040> future<00:01:47.340> soldier<00:01:47.850> is<00:01:47.939> gonna

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
argue that any future soldier is gonna

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.850 
argue that any future soldier is gonna
be<00:01:48.240> a<00:01:48.270> highly<00:01:48.659> trained<00:01:48.960> marksman<00:01:49.320> who<00:01:49.680> can

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
be a highly trained marksman who can

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.609 
be a highly trained marksman who can
deal<00:01:50.070> with<00:01:50.100> that<00:01:50.399> semi<00:01:50.670> automatic<00:01:51.210> fire<00:01:51.450> mode

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:51.619 
deal with that semi automatic fire mode

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:53.780 
deal with that semi automatic fire mode
so<00:01:52.619> it's<00:01:52.710> as<00:01:52.770> if<00:01:52.920> some<00:01:53.100> points<00:01:53.430> have<00:01:53.579> just<00:01:53.700> gone

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
so it's as if some points have just gone

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.069 
so it's as if some points have just gone
with<00:01:53.850> one<00:01:54.149> attachment<00:01:54.689> and<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:54.899> most

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
with one attachment and the most

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.840 
with one attachment and the most
futuristic<00:01:55.439> attachment<00:01:56.130> as<00:01:56.250> a<00:01:56.280> bunch<00:01:56.520> has<00:01:56.729> got

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
futuristic attachment as a bunch has got

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.300 
futuristic attachment as a bunch has got
to<00:01:56.939> be<00:01:57.060> that<00:01:57.210> millimeter<00:01:57.659> scanner<00:01:58.079> the<00:01:58.920> target

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
to be that millimeter scanner the target

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.770 
to be that millimeter scanner the target
finder<00:01:59.490> was<00:01:59.700> another<00:01:59.939> option<00:02:00.299> but<00:02:00.450> I<00:02:00.509> think

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
finder was another option but I think

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.959 
finder was another option but I think
the<00:02:00.960> ability<00:02:01.200> to<00:02:01.469> see<00:02:01.950> through<00:02:02.189> walls<00:02:02.219> is<00:02:02.820> some

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
the ability to see through walls is some

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.249 
the ability to see through walls is some
kind<00:02:03.180> of<00:02:03.240> technology<00:02:03.780> we<00:02:03.899> haven't<00:02:04.140> yet

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259

easily I think we'll all agree that the

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.050 
easily I think we'll all agree that the
most<00:02:17.380> futuristic<00:02:17.920> second<00:02:18.580> your<00:02:18.670> weapon<00:02:18.940> is

had<00:02:31.540> one<00:02:31.750> point<00:02:31.959> spare<00:02:32.380> so<00:02:32.590> I've<00:02:32.650> used<00:02:32.890> that<00:02:33.040> on

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
had one point spare so I've used that on

that capacity of the cap both sails a
little<00:02:37.030> bit<00:02:37.180> to<00:02:37.300> make<00:02:37.420> it<00:02:37.450> more<00:02:37.690> usable<00:02:38.250> let's

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
section I've spent one more point on the

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:45.090 
section I've spent one more point on the
