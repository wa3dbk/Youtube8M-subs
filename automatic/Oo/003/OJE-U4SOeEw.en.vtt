00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:10.450 
Jim for tech motor

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:14.470 
Jim for tech motor
I've<00:00:11.450> already<00:00:11.719> started<00:00:12.379> but<00:00:13.219> since<00:00:13.580> I<00:00:13.910> had<00:00:14.299> to

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:14.480 
I've already started but since I had to

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:15.850 
I've already started but since I had to
look<00:00:14.599> up<00:00:14.719> a<00:00:14.839> YouTube<00:00:15.169> video<00:00:15.320> and<00:00:15.530> couldn't

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:15.860 
look up a YouTube video and couldn't

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:18.870 
look up a YouTube video and couldn't
find<00:00:16.100> what<00:00:16.250> I<00:00:16.280> thought<00:00:16.460> I'd<00:00:16.610> make<00:00:16.790> one<00:00:16.820> anyway

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:18.880 
find what I thought I'd make one anyway

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:26.830 
find what I thought I'd make one anyway
basically<00:00:20.950> um<00:00:22.390> under<00:00:23.390> the<00:00:23.510> hood<00:00:23.830> you're<00:00:25.840> now

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:26.840 
basically um under the hood you're now

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:34.140 
basically um under the hood you're now
going<00:00:27.110> this<00:00:27.320> side<00:00:29.050> there's<00:00:30.250> spark<00:00:31.250> plug<00:00:31.460> wires

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:34.150 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:37.390 

are<00:00:35.150> going<00:00:35.270> to<00:00:35.330> be<00:00:35.420> located<00:00:35.780> right<00:00:36.400> here

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:37.400 
are going to be located right here

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.610 
are going to be located right here
there's<00:00:38.210> going<00:00:38.360> to<00:00:38.450> be<00:00:38.570> if<00:00:39.079> you<00:00:39.200> got<00:00:39.350> the

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:39.620 
there's going to be if you got the

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.490 
there's going to be if you got the
5-3000<00:00:40.400> be<00:00:40.460> eight<00:00:40.610> of<00:00:40.640> them<00:00:41.079> I'm<00:00:42.079> not<00:00:42.260> sure<00:00:42.410> how

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:42.500 
5-3000 be eight of them I'm not sure how

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.780 
5-3000 be eight of them I'm not sure how
to<00:00:42.620> do<00:00:42.740> the<00:00:42.920> 4-h<00:00:43.400> of<00:00:43.579> the<00:00:43.670> four<00:00:43.880> threes<00:00:44.210> but

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:45.790 
to do the 4-h of the four threes but

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:48.930 
to do the 4-h of the four threes but
this<00:00:46.790> is<00:00:46.940> basically<00:00:47.270> where<00:00:47.450> they're<00:00:47.570> at<00:00:47.720> and

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:48.940 
this is basically where they're at and

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:53.710 
this is basically where they're at and
to<00:00:49.940> get<00:00:50.060> these<00:00:50.210> off<00:00:50.450> I<00:00:51.730> pull<00:00:52.730> them<00:00:52.880> off<00:00:53.060> the<00:00:53.090> the

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:53.720 
to get these off I pull them off the the

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.790 
to get these off I pull them off the the
coil<00:00:53.960> packs<00:00:54.260> here<00:00:54.610> so<00:00:55.610> I<00:00:55.670> get<00:00:55.850> a<00:00:55.880> little<00:00:56.030> better

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:56.800 
coil packs here so I get a little better

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.400 
coil packs here so I get a little better
grip<00:00:57.800> on<00:00:58.570> this<00:00:59.570> part<00:00:59.809> down<00:00:59.899> here<00:00:59.960> and<00:01:00.320> this

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:00.410 
grip on this part down here and this

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:02.889 
grip on this part down here and this
just<00:01:00.620> pulls<00:01:00.829> right<00:01:00.920> off<00:01:01.130> I<00:01:01.540> have<00:01:02.540> a<00:01:02.600> hundred

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:02.899 
just pulls right off I have a hundred

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:04.689 
just pulls right off I have a hundred
and<00:01:02.989> thirteen<00:01:03.950> thousand<00:01:04.339> miles<00:01:04.489> on<00:01:04.609> this

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:04.699 
and thirteen thousand miles on this

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:07.059 
and thirteen thousand miles on this
truck<00:01:05.030> and<00:01:05.299> I<00:01:05.359> just<00:01:05.600> bought<00:01:05.869> in<00:01:05.990> a<00:01:06.139> few<00:01:06.859> months

00:01:07.059 --> 00:01:07.069 
truck and I just bought in a few months

00:01:07.069 --> 00:01:09.219 
truck and I just bought in a few months
ago<00:01:07.189> so<00:01:07.490> I'm<00:01:07.549> not<00:01:07.670> sure<00:01:07.729> if<00:01:08.149> they<00:01:08.929> ever<00:01:09.020> did<00:01:09.170> a

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:09.229 
ago so I'm not sure if they ever did a

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:11.770 
ago so I'm not sure if they ever did a
spark<00:01:09.740> plug<00:01:09.770> change<00:01:10.369> on<00:01:10.520> it<00:01:10.639> or<00:01:10.729> not<00:01:10.850> but<00:01:11.179> these

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
spark plug change on it or not but these

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.510 
spark plug change on it or not but these
are<00:01:11.960> pretty<00:01:12.139> pretty<00:01:12.619> hard<00:01:12.829> to<00:01:12.950> get<00:01:13.069> off

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
are pretty pretty hard to get off

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.809 
are pretty pretty hard to get off
and<00:01:13.609> I<00:01:14.539> actually<00:01:14.689> messed<00:01:15.020> one<00:01:15.289> of<00:01:15.409> them<00:01:15.530> up<00:01:15.819> so

00:01:16.809 --> 00:01:16.819 
and I actually messed one of them up so

00:01:16.819 --> 00:01:19.510 
and I actually messed one of them up so
I<00:01:16.850> ended<00:01:17.060> up<00:01:17.119> having<00:01:17.299> to<00:01:17.450> get<00:01:17.659> new<00:01:18.280> spark<00:01:19.280> plug

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
I ended up having to get new spark plug

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.149 
I ended up having to get new spark plug
wires<00:01:20.020> this<00:01:21.020> is<00:01:21.200> basically<00:01:21.679> what<00:01:21.889> it<00:01:21.920> looks

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:22.159 
wires this is basically what it looks

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:26.889 
wires this is basically what it looks
like<00:01:22.630> and<00:01:23.889> it's<00:01:24.889> got<00:01:25.069> a<00:01:25.509> little<00:01:26.509> piece<00:01:26.719> of

00:01:26.889 --> 00:01:26.899 
like and it's got a little piece of

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:29.019 
like and it's got a little piece of
metal<00:01:27.139> around<00:01:27.200> it<00:01:27.469> that's<00:01:27.639> basically<00:01:28.639> acts<00:01:28.819> as

00:01:29.019 --> 00:01:29.029 
metal around it that's basically acts as

00:01:29.029 --> 00:01:35.349 
metal around it that's basically acts as
a<00:01:29.060> ground<00:01:30.729> and<00:01:31.959> so<00:01:32.959> that's<00:01:33.380> off<00:01:34.179> and<00:01:35.179> then

00:01:35.349 --> 00:01:35.359 
a ground and so that's off and then

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:39.719 
a ground and so that's off and then
you're<00:01:35.630> going<00:01:35.719> to<00:01:35.779> need<00:01:36.049> a<00:01:37.060> ratchet<00:01:38.060> a<00:01:38.240> 5/8

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:39.729 
you're going to need a ratchet a 5/8

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:43.899 
you're going to need a ratchet a 5/8
spark<00:01:40.729> plug<00:01:40.909> socket<00:01:40.939> in<00:01:41.539> an<00:01:41.659> extension<00:01:42.289> I<00:01:42.909> just

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:43.909 
spark plug socket in an extension I just

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:45.910 
spark plug socket in an extension I just
have<00:01:44.090> I'm<00:01:44.389> going<00:01:44.479> to<00:01:44.539> know<00:01:44.659> how<00:01:45.560> long<00:01:45.679> this<00:01:45.859> is

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
have I'm going to know how long this is

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.730 
have I'm going to know how long this is
like<00:01:46.189> inch<00:01:47.060> or<00:01:47.359> two<00:01:47.539> or<00:01:47.810> maybe<00:01:48.200> three<00:01:48.349> but<00:01:48.789> I

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:50.740 
like inch or two or maybe three but I

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:56.050 
like inch or two or maybe three but I
had<00:01:51.740> to<00:01:51.889> had<00:01:52.459> to<00:01:52.719> I<00:01:54.639> had<00:01:55.639> to<00:01:55.759> use<00:01:55.909> some

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
had to had to I had to use some

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.409 
had to had to I had to use some
different<00:01:56.090> adapters<00:01:56.719> but<00:01:56.840> anyway<00:01:57.109> so<00:01:58.270> pull<00:01:59.270> it

00:01:59.409 --> 00:01:59.419 
different adapters but anyway so pull it

00:01:59.419 --> 00:02:04.800 
different adapters but anyway so pull it
out<00:01:59.569> it's<00:02:00.229> pretty<00:02:01.630> self-explanatory<00:02:02.630> right

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
out it's pretty self-explanatory right

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:12.699 
out it's pretty self-explanatory right
there<00:02:07.090> and<00:02:09.640> now<00:02:10.640> I'm<00:02:10.879> going<00:02:11.150> to<00:02:11.329> put<00:02:11.629> in<00:02:11.810> the

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
there and now I'm going to put in the

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:13.990 
there and now I'm going to put in the
spark<00:02:13.040> plugs<00:02:13.250> I<00:02:13.370> got<00:02:13.610> the<00:02:13.760> one

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
spark plugs I got the one

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.700 
spark plugs I got the one
I got<00:02:14.330> were<00:02:15.130> III<00:02:16.130> diamond<00:02:16.580> fire<00:02:16.790> spark<00:02:17.210> plugs

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:17.710 
I got were III diamond fire spark plugs

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:20.530 
I got were III diamond fire spark plugs
I<00:02:18.710> heard<00:02:19.160> they<00:02:19.280> were<00:02:19.340> a<00:02:19.430> pretty<00:02:19.670> decent

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
I heard they were a pretty decent

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.890 
I heard they were a pretty decent
sparkplug<00:02:21.050> but<00:02:21.320> they've<00:02:21.470> got<00:02:21.680> kind<00:02:21.860> of<00:02:22.010> a<00:02:22.900> it's

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
sparkplug but they've got kind of a it's

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:24.970 
sparkplug but they've got kind of a it's
kind<00:02:24.080> of<00:02:24.110> hard<00:02:24.260> to<00:02:24.320> see<00:02:24.470> in<00:02:24.500> the<00:02:24.590> video<00:02:24.680> but

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
kind of hard to see in the video but

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:26.380 
kind of hard to see in the video but
they<00:02:25.100> kind<00:02:25.280> of<00:02:25.340> got<00:02:25.400> an<00:02:25.580> interesting<00:02:25.820> tip<00:02:26.240> on

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
they kind of got an interesting tip on

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.200 
they kind of got an interesting tip on
them<00:02:26.540> but<00:02:26.630> anyway<00:02:26.720> they're<00:02:27.020> called<00:02:27.200> III

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:28.210 
them but anyway they're called III

plugs<00:02:33.940> so<00:02:35.170> I'm<00:02:36.170> going<00:02:36.350> to<00:02:36.410> get<00:02:36.620> my<00:02:37.610> torque

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
plugs so I'm going to get my torque

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.570 
plugs so I'm going to get my torque
wrench<00:02:38.030> and<00:02:38.630> I<00:02:39.590> was<00:02:39.740> reading<00:02:39.980> online<00:02:40.130> I'm<00:02:40.430> not

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
wrench and I was reading online I'm not

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.090 
wrench and I was reading online I'm not
sure<00:02:40.790> what<00:02:41.030> these<00:02:41.150> are<00:02:41.330> supposed<00:02:41.420> to<00:02:41.660> be<00:02:41.830> but<00:02:42.830> I

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.100 
sure what these are supposed to be but I

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:49.720 
sure what these are supposed to be but I
have<00:02:43.400> it<00:02:43.550> about<00:02:46.360> about<00:02:47.440> 450<00:02:48.700> inch-pounds<00:02:49.700> of

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
have it about about 450 inch-pounds of

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:56.100 
have it about about 450 inch-pounds of
torque<00:02:50.060> and<00:02:51.520> we<00:02:52.520> put<00:02:53.360> extension<00:02:54.290> on<00:02:54.440> my<00:02:54.770> socket

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
torque and we put extension on my socket

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.290 
torque and we put extension on my socket
get<00:02:57.110> this<00:02:57.260> ready<00:02:57.500> to<00:02:57.650> go<00:02:57.860> all<00:02:58.850> right<00:02:58.910> so<00:02:59.030> here

00:02:59.290 --> 00:02:59.300 
get this ready to go all right so here

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:07.710 
get this ready to go all right so here
we<00:02:59.330> are<00:02:59.450> putting<00:03:00.080> in<00:03:00.410> the<00:03:01.400> last<00:03:01.640> one<00:03:01.970> from<00:03:02.180> me

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.060 

basically<00:03:08.720> you're<00:03:08.959> just<00:03:08.989> going<00:03:09.230> to<00:03:09.290> tighten

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:10.070 
basically you're just going to tighten

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:16.000 
basically you're just going to tighten
that<00:03:10.340> up<00:03:11.500> look<00:03:13.930> head<00:03:14.930> up<00:03:15.080> my<00:03:15.260> finger<00:03:15.739> and<00:03:15.860> then

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
that up look head up my finger and then

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:22.360 
that up look head up my finger and then
I'll<00:03:16.100> use<00:03:16.310> a<00:03:16.340> torque<00:03:16.700> wrench<00:03:21.160> anyway<00:03:22.160> that's

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
I'll use a torque wrench anyway that's

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:24.160 
I'll use a torque wrench anyway that's
that's<00:03:22.610> actually<00:03:23.000> about<00:03:23.150> the<00:03:23.630> rest<00:03:23.840> of<00:03:24.080> the

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
that's actually about the rest of the

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
that's actually about the rest of the
video<00:03:25.600> so<00:03:26.600> yeah<00:03:27.290> I<00:03:27.320> guess<00:03:27.620> I'm<00:03:27.739> going<00:03:27.860> to<00:03:27.950> start

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.190 
video so yeah I guess I'm going to start

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:30.459 
video so yeah I guess I'm going to start
over
