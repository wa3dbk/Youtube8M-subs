all fits really nice and good so I might

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:05.129 
all fits really nice and good so I might
find<00:06:03.729> a<00:06:03.819> place<00:06:04.000> for<00:06:04.210> the<00:06:04.479> battery<00:06:04.810> different

00:06:05.129 --> 00:06:05.139 
find a place for the battery different

00:06:05.139 --> 00:06:07.830 
find a place for the battery different
place<00:06:05.289> or<00:06:05.590> get<00:06:05.830> fire<00:06:06.009> smaller<00:06:06.400> battery<00:06:06.840> I'm

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:07.840 
place or get fire smaller battery I'm

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:11.279

00:06:29.409 --> 00:06:29.419 
transducer down here at the bottom

00:06:29.419 --> 00:06:31.689 
transducer down here at the bottom
I<00:06:29.620> wanted<00:06:30.620> to<00:06:30.680> ask<00:06:30.889> y'all<00:06:31.099> if<00:06:31.129> this<00:06:31.520> is<00:06:31.669> a

I wanted to ask y'all if this is a

00:06:31.699 --> 00:06:33.249 
I wanted to ask y'all if this is a
transducer<00:06:32.360> that<00:06:32.449> can<00:06:32.689> be<00:06:32.750> mounted<00:06:33.080> inside

00:06:33.249 --> 00:06:33.259 
transducer that can be mounted inside

00:06:33.259 --> 00:06:35.350 
transducer that can be mounted inside
the<00:06:33.590> holes<00:06:33.770> about<00:06:34.009> I've<00:06:34.759> seen<00:06:35.030> a<00:06:35.060> lot<00:06:35.240> of

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:35.360 
the holes about I've seen a lot of

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:36.969 
the holes about I've seen a lot of
people<00:06:35.569> do<00:06:35.689> that<00:06:35.840> and<00:06:36.020> I<00:06:36.050> love<00:06:36.379> the<00:06:36.530> idea<00:06:36.800> but<00:06:36.919> I

00:06:36.969 --> 00:06:36.979 
people do that and I love the idea but I

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:38.750 
don't know if this one can be done like

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:41.350 
don't know if this one can be done like
that<00:06:38.960> just<00:06:39.740> because<00:06:39.830> the<00:06:40.159> design<00:06:40.520> that<00:06:40.759> is<00:06:41.000> but

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:41.360 
that just because the design that is but

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:43.899 
that just because the design that is but
uh<00:06:41.469> it'd<00:06:42.469> be<00:06:42.560> great<00:06:42.680> to<00:06:42.770> let<00:06:43.009> me<00:06:43.129> know<00:06:43.310> because

00:06:43.899 --> 00:06:43.909

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:48.680 
out of the way but that can just pull

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:51.010 
out of the way but that can just pull
out<00:06:48.710> and<00:06:49.310> then<00:06:49.460> stick<00:06:50.240> to<00:06:50.360> the<00:06:50.449> side<00:06:50.659> if<00:06:50.780> it's<00:06:50.900> a

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:51.020 
out and then stick to the side if it's a

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:54.999 
out and then stick to the side if it's a
shallow<00:06:51.289> water<00:06:51.590> or<00:06:51.710> whatnot<00:06:52.330> uh<00:06:53.409> yeah<00:06:54.409> I<00:06:54.680> mean
