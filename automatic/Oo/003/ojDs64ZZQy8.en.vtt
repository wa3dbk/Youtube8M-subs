twin victorious steam engine I've called
the<00:00:09.019> series<00:00:09.410> rebuilding<00:00:10.280> but<00:00:10.730> looking<00:00:11.089> at<00:00:11.209> it

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:11.240 
the series rebuilding but looking at it

I<00:00:11.509> don't<00:00:11.719> think<00:00:11.780> this<00:00:11.990> engines<00:00:12.379> ever<00:00:12.530> been

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:12.769 
I don't think this engines ever been

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:15.609 
I don't think this engines ever been
finished<00:00:13.160> is<00:00:13.369> certainly<00:00:13.730> never<00:00:13.969> run<00:00:14.269> as<00:00:14.619> an

00:00:15.609 --> 00:00:15.619 
finished is certainly never run as an

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:17.290 
finished is certainly never run as an
overview<00:00:15.950> the<00:00:16.160> engineering<00:00:16.910> standards

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:17.300 
overview the engineering standards

overview the engineering standards
pretty<00:00:17.599> good<00:00:17.869> the<00:00:18.349> parts<00:00:18.679> are<00:00:18.800> very<00:00:18.830> well<00:00:19.220> made

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:19.250 
pretty good the parts are very well made

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:21.759 
pretty good the parts are very well made
and<00:00:19.730> quite<00:00:19.939> well<00:00:20.119> finished<00:00:20.539> all<00:00:21.289> the<00:00:21.590> two

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:21.769 
and quite well finished all the two

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:23.710 
and quite well finished all the two
marks<00:00:22.099> have<00:00:22.250> been<00:00:22.279> removed<00:00:22.759> and<00:00:23.300> it<00:00:23.390> has<00:00:23.539> the

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:23.720 
marks have been removed and it has the

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.349 
marks have been removed and it has the
makings<00:00:24.109> of<00:00:24.199> a<00:00:24.320> very<00:00:24.470> good<00:00:24.740> engine<00:00:25.130> but<00:00:26.060> having

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:26.359 
makings of a very good engine but having

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:28.120 
makings of a very good engine but having
said<00:00:26.539> that<00:00:26.599> I've<00:00:27.109> not<00:00:27.410> been<00:00:27.529> inside<00:00:27.919> the

said that I've not been inside the

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:30.189 
said that I've not been inside the
engine<00:00:28.460> yet<00:00:28.609> I'm<00:00:28.910> hoping<00:00:29.419> that<00:00:29.599> the<00:00:29.689> internal

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:30.199 
engine yet I'm hoping that the internal

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:31.810 
engine yet I'm hoping that the internal
parts<00:00:30.470> of<00:00:30.560> the<00:00:30.619> engine<00:00:30.710> look<00:00:31.220> as<00:00:31.369> well<00:00:31.519> as<00:00:31.669> the

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:31.820 
parts of the engine look as well as the

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.450 
parts of the engine look as well as the
external<00:00:32.360> parts<00:00:32.860> the<00:00:33.860> first<00:00:33.890> thing<00:00:34.340> that's

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:34.460 
external parts the first thing that's

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.310 
external parts the first thing that's
apparent<00:00:34.910> with<00:00:35.059> this<00:00:35.270> engine<00:00:35.480> is<00:00:35.960> that<00:00:36.020> the

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:36.320 
apparent with this engine is that the

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.529 
apparent with this engine is that the
main<00:00:36.500> bearings<00:00:36.980> and<00:00:37.219> not<00:00:37.489> split<00:00:37.879> units<00:00:38.329> and

00:00:38.529 --> 00:00:38.539 
main bearings and not split units and

00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:40.360 
main bearings and not split units and
the<00:00:39.199> little<00:00:39.440> bit<00:00:39.530> of<00:00:39.649> play<00:00:39.860> on<00:00:40.010> them<00:00:40.190> as<00:00:40.280> you

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:40.370 
the little bit of play on them as you

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.819 
the little bit of play on them as you
can<00:00:40.430> see<00:00:40.760> here<00:00:41.030> so<00:00:41.989> have<00:00:42.199> the<00:00:42.350> choice<00:00:42.620> of

00:00:42.819 --> 00:00:42.829 
can see here so have the choice of

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:44.290 
can see here so have the choice of
whether<00:00:43.010> to<00:00:43.280> make<00:00:43.430> these<00:00:43.699> into<00:00:44.030> split

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:44.300 
whether to make these into split

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.880 
whether to make these into split
bearings<00:00:44.719> or<00:00:44.899> just<00:00:45.440> push<00:00:45.649> them

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
bearings or just push them

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.950 
bearings or just push them
the<00:00:47.489> main<00:00:47.670> steam<00:00:47.969> Inlet<00:00:48.329> is<00:00:48.510> a<00:00:48.539> bit<00:00:48.749> of<00:00:48.870> a

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
the main steam Inlet is a bit of a

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.869 
the main steam Inlet is a bit of a
bizarre<00:00:49.170> construction<00:00:50.010> made<00:00:50.190> far<00:00:50.489> too<00:00:50.670> long

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
bizarre construction made far too long

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.610 
bizarre construction made far too long
and<00:00:51.149> it's<00:00:51.390> not<00:00:51.449> threaded<00:00:51.839> far<00:00:52.170> enough<00:00:52.379> down

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
and it's not threaded far enough down

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.219 
and it's not threaded far enough down
into<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.100> tee<00:00:53.280> piece<00:00:53.519> this<00:00:54.449> is<00:00:54.629> an<00:00:54.749> easy<00:00:54.899> fix

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:55.229 
into the tee piece this is an easy fix

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:58.069 
into the tee piece this is an easy fix
I'll<00:00:55.469> get<00:00:55.620> to<00:00:55.769> that<00:00:55.800> in<00:00:56.039> due<00:00:56.159> course<00:00:57.079> either

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
I'll get to that in due course either

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.869 
I'll get to that in due course either
way<00:00:58.440> I'll<00:00:58.500> be<00:00:58.559> setting<00:00:58.920> up<00:00:59.129> each<00:00:59.339> side<00:00:59.640> of<00:00:59.789> the

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
way I'll be setting up each side of the

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.759 
way I'll be setting up each side of the
engine<00:01:00.030> individually<00:01:00.870> before<00:01:01.260> a<00:01:01.289> pipe<00:01:01.589> them

the flywheel grooves are a little bit

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:07.760 
the flywheel grooves are a little bit
chattery<00:01:06.509> but<00:01:06.930> this<00:01:07.080> is<00:01:07.229> quite<00:01:07.470> a<00:01:07.500> difficult

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
chattery but this is quite a difficult

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.039 
chattery but this is quite a difficult

already<00:01:38.569> I<00:01:38.659> think<00:01:38.719> I'm<00:01:39.079> committed<00:01:39.530> to<00:01:39.560> pulling

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
already I think I'm committed to pulling

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:41.740 
already I think I'm committed to pulling
this<00:01:40.069> engine<00:01:40.429> right<00:01:40.609> down<00:01:40.849> to<00:01:41.030> its<00:01:41.149> component

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 
this engine right down to its component

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.499 
this engine right down to its component
parts<00:01:41.899> and<00:01:42.200> starting<00:01:42.950> again<00:01:43.209> just<00:01:44.209> look<00:01:44.390> at

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:44.509 
parts and starting again just look at

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:47.540 
parts and starting again just look at
the<00:01:44.599> cross<00:01:44.810> head<00:01:45.049> this<00:01:45.950> is<00:01:46.130> a<00:01:46.159> joke

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:47.550 
the cross head this is a joke

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:49.670 
the cross head this is a joke
there<00:01:48.270> are<00:01:48.360> clearly<00:01:48.660> packing<00:01:49.320> washes

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
there are clearly packing washes

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.580 
there are clearly packing washes
underneath<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.310> cross<00:01:50.520> head<00:01:50.700> top<00:01:50.970> Guide<00:01:51.210> bar

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.169 

leads<00:01:53.710> me<00:01:53.770> to<00:01:53.920> believe<00:01:54.159> that<00:01:54.609> maybe<00:01:54.909> the

00:01:55.169 --> 00:01:55.179 
leads me to believe that maybe the

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:56.940 
leads me to believe that maybe the
cylinder<00:01:55.659> is<00:01:55.810> not<00:01:55.840> in<00:01:56.170> line<00:01:56.380> with<00:01:56.409> the<00:01:56.740> cross

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
cylinder is not in line with the cross

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.289 
cylinder is not in line with the cross
head

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.149 

and<00:02:01.299> the<00:02:01.719> noise<00:02:01.899> will<00:02:02.110> be<00:02:02.140> unbelievable<00:02:02.979> if

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:03.159 
and the noise will be unbelievable if

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:04.740 
and the noise will be unbelievable if
the<00:02:03.399> engine<00:02:03.670> was<00:02:03.820> actually<00:02:03.969> running<00:02:04.420> with<00:02:04.659> the

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750 
the engine was actually running with the

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.020 
the engine was actually running with the
cross<00:02:04.960> head<00:02:05.170> this<00:02:05.380> slack<00:02:05.649> not<00:02:06.490> to<00:02:06.640> mention<00:02:06.789> the

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
cross head this slack not to mention the

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:08.580 
cross head this slack not to mention the
fact<00:02:07.270> it's<00:02:07.479> a<00:02:07.600> twin<00:02:07.840> so<00:02:08.110> there<00:02:08.289> are<00:02:08.410> two

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
fact it's a twin so there are two

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.670 
fact it's a twin so there are two
crosses<00:02:09.009> that<00:02:09.190> would<00:02:09.280> be<00:02:09.429> clacking<00:02:09.849> in<00:02:10.000> use

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:10.680 
crosses that would be clacking in use

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:13.140 
crosses that would be clacking in use
I've<00:02:11.680> turned<00:02:11.950> the<00:02:12.099> engine<00:02:12.400> around<00:02:12.519> and<00:02:13.060> you

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
I've turned the engine around and you

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:14.729 
I've turned the engine around and you
can<00:02:13.330> see<00:02:13.540> here<00:02:13.780> that<00:02:13.810> the<00:02:14.080> crank<00:02:14.319> web<00:02:14.530> is<00:02:14.650> not

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:14.739 
can see here that the crank web is not

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:17.730 
can see here that the crank web is not
the<00:02:14.890> right<00:02:15.069> way<00:02:15.220> around<00:02:15.340> at<00:02:15.640> all

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:17.740 
the right way around at all

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:19.380 
the right way around at all
someone's<00:02:18.430> taking<00:02:18.730> the<00:02:18.820> trouble<00:02:19.030> with<00:02:19.240> this

engine to taper the guide bars and it

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.670 
engine to taper the guide bars and it
looks<00:02:21.730> quite<00:02:21.970> nice<00:02:22.210> the<00:02:23.110> made<00:02:23.290> a<00:02:23.320> bit<00:02:23.500> of<00:02:23.620> a

looks quite nice the made a bit of a

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.000 
looks quite nice the made a bit of a
mistake<00:02:23.860> by<00:02:24.250> drilling<00:02:24.550> the<00:02:24.820> lower<00:02:25.030> Guide<00:02:25.360> bar

this<00:02:27.010> is<00:02:27.070> all<00:02:27.310> simple<00:02:27.610> stuff<00:02:27.940> though<00:02:28.150> and<00:02:28.360> very

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:28.570 
this is all simple stuff though and very

this is all simple stuff though and very
easy<00:02:28.810> to<00:02:29.050> rectify<00:02:29.940> the<00:02:30.940> play<00:02:31.150> on<00:02:31.270> the<00:02:31.390> cross

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
the other side look okay and you can

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.350 
the other side look okay and you can
clearly<00:02:35.410> see<00:02:35.530> washers<00:02:36.250> underneath<00:02:36.760> both<00:02:37.030> ends

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
clearly see washers underneath both ends

of<00:02:37.450> the<00:02:37.600> slide<00:02:37.810> bar<00:02:38.080> this<00:02:38.650> is<00:02:38.710> no<00:02:38.980> good<00:02:39.130> at<00:02:39.190> all

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:39.460 
of the slide bar this is no good at all

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:41.130 
of the slide bar this is no good at all
and<00:02:39.730> as<00:02:39.970> I<00:02:40.120> said<00:02:40.300> earlier<00:02:40.690> I'm<00:02:40.900> quite

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
and as I said earlier I'm quite

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.530 
and as I said earlier I'm quite
concerned<00:02:41.650> about<00:02:41.890> this<00:02:42.100> at<00:02:42.850> this<00:02:43.030> stage<00:02:43.330> as<00:02:43.510> a

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
concerned about this at this stage as a

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.030 
concerned about this at this stage as a
roof<00:02:43.810> guesser<00:02:44.080> would<00:02:44.320> think<00:02:44.560> that<00:02:44.620> the<00:02:44.770> slide

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
roof guesser would think that the slide

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.740 
roof guesser would think that the slide
bars<00:02:45.310> are<00:02:45.460> not<00:02:45.490> in<00:02:45.760> the<00:02:45.850> right<00:02:46.000> place<00:02:46.210> to<00:02:46.480> start

with<00:02:46.930> other<00:02:47.650> things<00:02:47.950> on<00:02:48.160> this<00:02:48.310> engine<00:02:48.490> are

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
with other things on this engine are

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.670 
with other things on this engine are
pretty<00:02:48.910> good<00:02:49.150> the<00:02:49.840> brackets<00:02:50.260> that<00:02:50.410> hold<00:02:50.500> the

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
pretty good the brackets that hold the

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.770 
pretty good the brackets that hold the
cylinders<00:02:51.160> are<00:02:51.280> very<00:02:51.460> well<00:02:51.700> made<00:02:51.730> and<00:02:52.180> the

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
cylinders are very well made and the

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.420 
cylinders are very well made and the
cylinders<00:02:53.230> seem<00:02:53.410> to<00:02:53.530> be<00:02:53.620> quite<00:02:53.830> well<00:02:53.860> machined

externally<00:02:55.290> can't<00:02:56.290> comment<00:02:56.650> until<00:02:56.830> I<00:02:56.950> get

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
externally can't comment until I get

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:58.710 
externally can't comment until I get
inside<00:02:57.490> them<00:02:57.760> to<00:02:57.880> see<00:02:58.030> what<00:02:58.180> the<00:02:58.300> bars<00:02:58.540> are

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
inside them to see what the bars are

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.960 
inside them to see what the bars are
like<00:02:58.900> it<00:02:59.830> looks<00:03:00.040> to<00:03:00.190> me<00:03:00.310> like<00:03:00.340> the<00:03:00.610> Builder<00:03:00.940> of

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
like it looks to me like the Builder of

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.150 
like it looks to me like the Builder of
this<00:03:01.060> engine<00:03:01.540> actually<00:03:01.720> had<00:03:02.050> some<00:03:02.290> skill<00:03:02.620> but

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 
this engine actually had some skill but

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.760 
this engine actually had some skill but
lost<00:03:03.400> his<00:03:03.580> way<00:03:03.790> during<00:03:04.210> the<00:03:04.390> build<00:03:04.720> I<00:03:04.930> see<00:03:05.620> this

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:05.770 
lost his way during the build I see this

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:07.800 
lost his way during the build I see this
quite<00:03:06.010> a<00:03:06.070> lot<00:03:06.400> people<00:03:06.970> seem<00:03:07.150> to<00:03:07.180> get<00:03:07.420> fed<00:03:07.660> up

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
quite a lot people seem to get fed up

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.110 
quite a lot people seem to get fed up
for<00:03:07.990> building<00:03:08.320> engines<00:03:08.710> and<00:03:08.920> rushed<00:03:09.700> the<00:03:09.850> last

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
for building engines and rushed the last

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.690

if<00:03:17.560> the<00:03:18.070> parts<00:03:18.370> aren't<00:03:18.610> made<00:03:18.820> well<00:03:19.090> enough

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420 
if the parts aren't made well enough

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.270 
if the parts aren't made well enough
then<00:03:20.200> the<00:03:20.350> builders<00:03:20.680> going<00:03:20.890> to<00:03:21.010> have<00:03:21.130> to

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
then the builders going to have to

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.600 
then the builders going to have to
budget<00:03:21.700> when<00:03:22.120> he<00:03:22.210> puts<00:03:22.390> the<00:03:22.540> engine<00:03:22.840> together

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:24.610 
budget when he puts the engine together

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:28.460 
budget when he puts the engine together
have<00:03:24.760> a<00:03:24.790> look<00:03:25.000> at<00:03:25.120> this<00:03:25.240> you<00:03:25.450> see<00:03:25.660> what<00:03:25.690> I<00:03:25.840> mean

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.350 

I<00:03:28.530> somehow<00:03:29.160> get<00:03:29.460> the<00:03:29.640> impression<00:03:29.940> on<00:03:30.180> this

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
I somehow get the impression on this

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.240 
I somehow get the impression on this
engine<00:03:30.570> that<00:03:31.200> more<00:03:31.440> than<00:03:31.620> one<00:03:31.800> builder<00:03:32.130> was

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
engine that more than one builder was

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.000 
engine that more than one builder was
probably<00:03:32.550> involved<00:03:33.080> because<00:03:34.080> the<00:03:34.350> meticulous

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
probably involved because the meticulous

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.370 
probably involved because the meticulous
painstaking<00:03:36.000> finish<00:03:36.390> on<00:03:36.600> the<00:03:36.750> cylinders<00:03:37.200> is

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
painstaking finish on the cylinders is

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.620 
painstaking finish on the cylinders is
not<00:03:37.920> duplicated<00:03:38.550> on<00:03:38.640> the<00:03:38.790> main<00:03:38.970> bearings<00:03:39.270> and

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
not duplicated on the main bearings and

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:42.410 
not duplicated on the main bearings and
they're<00:03:40.290> not<00:03:40.380> even<00:03:40.530> split<00:03:41.240> split<00:03:42.240> main

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
they're not even split split main

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.120 
they're not even split split main
bearings<00:03:42.870> make<00:03:43.080> it<00:03:43.200> possible<00:03:43.410> to<00:03:43.740> adjust<00:03:43.830> the

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
bearings make it possible to adjust the

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.340 
bearings make it possible to adjust the
main<00:03:44.400> bearings<00:03:44.700> to<00:03:45.300> take<00:03:45.510> up<00:03:45.630> anywhere<00:03:46.050> and

in<00:03:56.530> one<00:03:56.650> video<00:03:56.829> but<00:03:57.819> I<00:03:57.939> need<00:03:58.090> to<00:03:58.209> have<00:03:58.329> a<00:03:58.359> closer

00:03:58.709 --> 00:03:58.719 
in one video but I need to have a closer

00:03:58.719 --> 00:04:00.899 
in one video but I need to have a closer
look<00:03:58.900> so<00:03:59.890> I'll<00:03:59.980> remove<00:04:00.189> one<00:04:00.459> side<00:04:00.700> of<00:04:00.819> the

00:04:00.899 --> 00:04:00.909 
look so I'll remove one side of the

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:02.640 
look so I'll remove one side of the
engine<00:04:01.030> and<00:04:01.359> now<00:04:01.840> the<00:04:01.900> flywheels<00:04:02.439> come<00:04:02.590> off

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 
engine and now the flywheels come off

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:05.300 
engine and now the flywheels come off
the<00:04:02.769> crankshaft

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.400 

I<00:04:05.370> can<00:04:05.640> already<00:04:05.880> see<00:04:06.150> some<00:04:06.330> ultraviolence<00:04:07.170> on

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410

the<00:04:07.739> eccentric<00:04:08.480> this<00:04:09.480> will<00:04:09.690> need<00:04:09.870> looking<00:04:10.260> at

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
the eccentric this will need looking at

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:12.620 
the eccentric this will need looking at
I<00:04:10.650> would<00:04:11.550> think<00:04:11.760> there's<00:04:12.000> something<00:04:12.360> a<00:04:12.480> bit

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:12.630 
I would think there's something a bit

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:15.320 
I would think there's something a bit
wrong<00:04:12.900> there<00:04:13.170> are<00:04:13.380> maybe<00:04:14.370> the<00:04:14.580> builder<00:04:14.970> just

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:15.330 
wrong there are maybe the builder just

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:18.500 
wrong there are maybe the builder just
lost<00:04:15.510> his<00:04:15.660> temper<00:04:15.870> I<00:04:16.200> don't<00:04:16.440> know

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
lost his temper I don't know

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:20.480 
lost his temper I don't know
my<00:04:19.050> first<00:04:19.350> findings<00:04:19.890> show<00:04:20.100> that<00:04:20.130> the

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:20.490 
my first findings show that the

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:22.580 
my first findings show that the
eccentric<00:04:21.090> is<00:04:21.270> quite<00:04:21.540> firmly<00:04:21.870> stuck<00:04:22.290> on<00:04:22.440> this

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
eccentric is quite firmly stuck on this

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:25.310 
eccentric is quite firmly stuck on this
shaft<00:04:22.920> it<00:04:23.730> must<00:04:23.970> be<00:04:24.120> a<00:04:24.150> tight<00:04:24.390> fit<00:04:24.420> so<00:04:24.930> I'll

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
shaft it must be a tight fit so I'll

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:28.719 
shaft it must be a tight fit so I'll
have<00:04:25.440> to<00:04:25.560> look<00:04:25.650> at<00:04:25.830> that

00:04:28.719 --> 00:04:28.729 

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:30.670 

to<00:04:29.419> finish<00:04:29.599> this<00:04:29.779> video<00:04:30.110> I'll<00:04:30.229> have<00:04:30.289> a

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680 
to finish this video I'll have a

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.800 
to finish this video I'll have a
look<00:04:30.740> at<00:04:30.860> the<00:04:30.949> baseboard

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:33.810 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:35.420 

really<00:04:34.050> I<00:04:34.080> think<00:04:34.200> maybe<00:04:34.590> a<00:04:34.680> new<00:04:34.860> one<00:04:35.070> may<00:04:35.250> be<00:04:35.310> in

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 
really I think maybe a new one may be in

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.879 
really I think maybe a new one may be in
order<00:04:35.870> there<00:04:36.870> are<00:04:36.900> some<00:04:37.139> names<00:04:37.410> and<00:04:37.680> dates

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:37.889

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:39.650

here<00:04:39.900> I<00:04:40.080> don't<00:04:40.500> know<00:04:40.590> who<00:04:40.710> these<00:04:40.919> people<00:04:40.980> are

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:41.480 
here I don't know who these people are

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:43.460 
here I don't know who these people are
but<00:04:42.480> they<00:04:42.630> look<00:04:42.660> like<00:04:42.930> they're<00:04:43.050> from<00:04:43.169> the<00:04:43.290> same
