00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:51.280 
this is actually a swing guard so the

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:52.860 
this is actually a swing guard so the
guard<00:00:51.489> is<00:00:51.730> located<00:00:52.270> right<00:00:52.300> here<00:00:52.719> it's

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:52.870 
guard is located right here it's

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.500

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:55.510 
attached with the pin into the blade so

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.920 
attached with the pin into the blade so
when<00:00:55.629> it's<00:00:55.750> deployed<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:57.100> guard<00:00:58.059> comes<00:00:58.270> out<00:00:58.600> I

00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:58.930 
when it's deployed the guard comes out I

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.110 
when it's deployed the guard comes out I
will<00:00:59.530> kind<00:00:59.920> of<00:01:00.039> show<00:01:00.129> you<00:01:00.280> how<00:01:00.460> that<00:01:00.609> works<00:01:00.789> a

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:01.120

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
probably should look that up before

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:14.900 
probably should look that up before
making<00:02:13.620> the<00:02:13.709> video<00:02:13.980> but<00:02:14.340> I<00:02:14.370> didn't<00:02:14.700> think<00:02:14.760> I

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
making the video but I didn't think I

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.150 
making the video but I didn't think I
was<00:02:14.970> going<00:02:15.120> to<00:02:15.209> mention<00:02:15.330> it<00:02:15.599> so<00:02:16.590> this<00:02:16.920> is<00:02:17.010> my<00:02:17.130> a

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
was going to mention it so this is my a

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.089 
was going to mention it so this is my a
Casey<00:02:17.930> it<00:02:18.930> looks<00:02:19.260> really<00:02:19.560> nice

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:20.099 
Casey it looks really nice

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:23.690 
Casey it looks really nice
the<00:02:21.030> deployment<00:02:21.630> on<00:02:21.780> it<00:02:21.989> it<00:02:22.560> leaves<00:02:23.459> a<00:02:23.580> little

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
the deployment on it it leaves a little

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.850 
the deployment on it it leaves a little
to<00:02:23.849> be<00:02:24.120> latched<00:02:24.420> doesn't<00:02:25.319> quite<00:02:25.440> come<00:02:25.650> out<00:02:25.709> as

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
to be latched doesn't quite come out as

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.550 
to be latched doesn't quite come out as
strong<00:02:26.130> as<00:02:26.280> I<00:02:26.370> was<00:02:26.489> expecting<00:02:27.080> in<00:02:28.080> fact<00:02:28.380> when<00:02:28.530> I

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
strong as I was expecting in fact when I

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.070 
strong as I was expecting in fact when I
first<00:02:28.650> got<00:02:29.040> it<00:02:29.250> the<00:02:30.239> first<00:02:30.270> number<00:02:31.050> of

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
first got it the first number of

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
deploy because the swing guard when it

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.809

was coming out flat was actually

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:43.520 
was coming out flat was actually
providing<00:02:42.300> just<00:02:42.540> enough<00:02:42.780> resistance<00:02:43.140> you

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
providing just enough resistance you

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:44.900 
providing just enough resistance you

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
know what this moving it does kind of

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.240 
know what this moving it does kind of
scrape<00:02:45.209> a<00:02:45.330> little<00:02:45.480> it<00:02:46.260> provided<00:02:46.830> just<00:02:46.950> enough

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
scrape a little it provided just enough

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:49.100 
resistance that a wouldn't fully deploy

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.800 
resistance that a wouldn't fully deploy
but<00:02:50.100> now<00:02:50.370> it's<00:02:50.670> working<00:02:50.819> good<00:02:51.060> oiled<00:02:51.569> it<00:02:51.660> up

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
but now it's working good oiled it up

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.979 
but now it's working good oiled it up
I've<00:02:52.080> been<00:02:52.319> breaking<00:02:53.069> it<00:02:53.310> in<00:02:53.459> the<00:02:54.450> blade<00:02:54.690> play

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
I've been breaking it in the blade play

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:58.090 
I've been breaking it in the blade play
I<00:02:55.410> was<00:02:55.830> a<00:02:55.920> little<00:02:56.160> disappointed<00:02:56.250> with<00:02:56.790> -<00:02:57.060> I

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
I was a little disappointed with - I

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.830 
I was a little disappointed with - I
don't<00:02:59.100> know<00:02:59.160> if<00:02:59.280> you<00:02:59.340> can<00:02:59.489> hear<00:02:59.670> that<00:02:59.850> blade

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
don't know if you can hear that blade

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.370 
don't know if you can hear that blade
moves<00:03:01.140> around<00:03:01.290> quite<00:03:01.739> a<00:03:01.769> bit<00:03:01.920> this<00:03:02.549> pin<00:03:02.940> here

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
moves around quite a bit this pin here

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.840 
moves around quite a bit this pin here
and<00:03:04.380> of<00:03:04.470> course<00:03:04.680> this<00:03:04.799> is<00:03:04.980> all<00:03:05.160> old-school

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
and of course this is all old-school

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:08.420 
and of course this is all old-school
style<00:03:06.150> so<00:03:06.569> it's<00:03:06.750> all<00:03:06.930> pin<00:03:07.230> construction<00:03:07.860> this

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
style so it's all pin construction this

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.940 
style so it's all pin construction this
pin<00:03:08.670> here<00:03:08.940> isn't<00:03:09.180> quite<00:03:09.390> as<00:03:09.569> tight<00:03:09.870> as<00:03:10.230> it

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
pin here isn't quite as tight as it

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.620 
pin here isn't quite as tight as it
probably<00:03:11.130> should<00:03:11.280> be<00:03:11.580> but<00:03:12.830> it's<00:03:13.830> still<00:03:14.100> cool

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:14.630 
probably should be but it's still cool

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:17.780 
probably should be but it's still cool
so<00:03:15.630> it's<00:03:15.750> locked<00:03:16.019> back<00:03:16.230> designed<00:03:17.070> here<00:03:17.430> so<00:03:17.670> you

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
so it's locked back designed here so you

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.740 
so it's locked back designed here so you
just<00:03:17.940> press<00:03:18.209> this<00:03:18.510> to<00:03:19.040> release<00:03:20.040> the<00:03:20.220> blade<00:03:20.750> it

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
just press this to release the blade it

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.560 
just press this to release the blade it
does<00:03:21.900> have<00:03:22.079> a<00:03:22.109> little<00:03:22.410> forward<00:03:22.980> and<00:03:23.130> back<00:03:23.570> play

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
does have a little forward and back play

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:27.410 
does have a little forward and back play
as<00:03:24.720> well<00:03:24.870> not<00:03:25.170> a<00:03:25.200> ton<00:03:25.609> came<00:03:26.609> fairly<00:03:27.120> sharp

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
as well not a ton came fairly sharp

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.650 
as well not a ton came fairly sharp
actually<00:03:28.049> sharper<00:03:28.890> than<00:03:29.010> I<00:03:29.160> imagined<00:03:29.670> but

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
actually sharper than I imagined but

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.170 
actually sharper than I imagined but
definitely<00:03:31.590> just<00:03:31.799> gorgeous<00:03:32.220> and<00:03:32.730> look<00:03:33.030> at

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
definitely just gorgeous and look at

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.180 
definitely just gorgeous and look at
that<00:03:33.329> mirror<00:03:33.690> blade<00:03:34.049> and<00:03:34.500> those<00:03:34.650> pearl<00:03:34.950> X

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
that mirror blade and those pearl X

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:38.180 
that mirror blade and those pearl X
scales<00:03:35.840> really<00:03:36.840> cool<00:03:37.079> I'm<00:03:37.290> getting<00:03:37.590> way<00:03:37.769> into

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
scales really cool I'm getting way into

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:41.780 
scales really cool I'm getting way into
switchblades<00:03:39.090> now<00:03:39.500> so<00:03:40.500> hopefully<00:03:41.010> I<00:03:41.310> don't

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
switchblades now so hopefully I don't

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:43.520 
switchblades now so hopefully I don't
turn<00:03:42.000> you<00:03:42.150> guys<00:03:42.299> off<00:03:42.540> on<00:03:42.690> my<00:03:42.780> channel<00:03:43.200> by<00:03:43.320> doing
