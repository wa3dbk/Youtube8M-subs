performance<00:00:10.679> okay<00:00:11.580> so<00:00:11.639> that<00:00:11.820> says<00:00:12.030> straight

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
performance okay so that says straight

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:12.890 
performance okay so that says straight
into<00:00:12.630> it

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
into it

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.810 
into it
first<00:00:13.349> of<00:00:13.500> all<00:00:13.590> you're<00:00:13.889> gonna<00:00:13.980> ice<00:00:14.250> it<00:00:14.280> every

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
first of all you're gonna ice it every

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.910 
first of all you're gonna ice it every
time<00:00:15.000> I<00:00:15.059> make<00:00:15.299> a<00:00:15.330> video<00:00:15.660> like<00:00:15.809> this<00:00:15.920> update

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920

your drivers it's the simplest thing to
do<00:00:19.170> and<00:00:19.410> it's<00:00:19.800> just<00:00:20.010> the<00:00:20.130> most<00:00:20.310> necessary

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
do and it's just the most necessary

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.939 
do and it's just the most necessary
because<00:00:21.000> drivers<00:00:21.900> run<00:00:22.760> the<00:00:23.760> mud<00:00:24.000> all<00:00:24.650> GPU<00:00:25.650> and

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949

this an AMD GPU is not mine but to
screenshot<00:02:52.160> of<00:02:52.310> it<00:02:52.480> you<00:02:53.480> just<00:02:53.630> want<00:02:53.840> to<00:02:53.930> change

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
screenshot of it you just want to change

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.440 
screenshot of it you just want to change
the<00:02:54.470> clock<00:02:54.709> speeds<00:02:55.100> and<00:02:55.700> the<00:02:55.880> memory<00:02:56.209> clock

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
the clock speeds and the memory clock

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.300 
the clock speeds and the memory clock
speeds<00:02:56.840> and<00:02:57.440> that<00:02:57.620> is<00:02:57.770> what<00:02:57.950> will<00:02:58.069> give<00:02:58.100> you<00:02:58.280> a

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
speeds and that is what will give you a

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.540 
speeds and that is what will give you a
big<00:02:58.550> boost<00:02:59.200> so<00:03:00.200> as<00:03:00.530> you<00:03:00.650> can<00:03:00.739> see<00:03:00.800> there

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:01.550 
big boost so as you can see there

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:04.839 
big boost so as you can see there
between<00:03:02.180> the<00:03:02.680> memory<00:03:03.680> clock<00:03:04.100> and<00:03:04.400> the<00:03:04.489> GPU

between the memory clock and the GPU
proc<00:03:05.239> settings<00:03:05.630> and<00:03:05.900> that<00:03:05.959> will<00:03:06.080> give<00:03:06.200> you<00:03:06.260> the

00:03:06.339 --> 00:03:06.349 
proc settings and that will give you the

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:09.009 
proc settings and that will give you the
big<00:03:06.500> boost<00:03:06.739> which<00:03:07.040> you<00:03:07.220> want<00:03:07.370> goes<00:03:07.569> ok<00:03:08.569> go<00:03:08.750> so

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:09.019 
big boost which you want goes ok go so

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:11.110 
big boost which you want goes ok go so
next<00:03:09.440> thing<00:03:09.530> you<00:03:09.680> want<00:03:09.800> to<00:03:09.830> do<00:03:10.160> is<00:03:10.519> go<00:03:10.850> on<00:03:11.090> to

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
next thing you want to do is go on to

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.300 
next thing you want to do is go on to
the<00:03:11.360> actual<00:03:11.630> game<00:03:11.780> so<00:03:12.350> if<00:03:12.500> you're<00:03:12.650> if<00:03:13.010> you<00:03:13.190> are

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
the actual game so if you're if you are

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.580 
the actual game so if you're if you are
gaming<00:03:13.549> and<00:03:13.760> experiencing<00:03:14.540> problems<00:03:14.690> what

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
gaming and experiencing problems what

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:17.350 
gaming and experiencing problems what
you<00:03:15.709> really<00:03:16.010> want<00:03:16.190> to<00:03:16.250> go<00:03:16.370> and<00:03:16.519> do<00:03:16.640> is<00:03:16.880> turn

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 
you really want to go and do is turn

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:23.320 
you really want to go and do is turn
down<00:03:18.430> the<00:03:19.430> shader<00:03:19.760> and<00:03:21.519> the<00:03:22.519> shadow<00:03:22.940> and

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:23.330 
down the shader and the shadow and

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:25.990 
down the shader and the shadow and
texture<00:03:23.930> settings<00:03:24.680> because<00:03:24.920> these<00:03:25.489> eat<00:03:25.819> up

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
texture settings because these eat up

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.660 
texture settings because these eat up
video<00:03:26.330> RAM<00:03:26.630> like<00:03:27.230> anything<00:03:27.769> they're<00:03:27.980> so<00:03:28.400> bad

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670 
video RAM like anything they're so bad

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:32.350 
video RAM like anything they're so bad
because<00:03:29.450> they<00:03:29.600> just<00:03:29.810> so<00:03:30.709> your<00:03:31.340> GPU<00:03:31.700> weren't<00:03:32.120> so

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:32.360 
because they just so your GPU weren't so

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.120 
because they just so your GPU weren't so
much<00:03:32.480> slower<00:03:32.780> and<00:03:32.870> that<00:03:33.080> is<00:03:33.200> what<00:03:33.380> gaming

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130 
much slower and that is what gaming

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:35.830 
much slower and that is what gaming
consists<00:03:34.489> of<00:03:34.640> really<00:03:35.000> the<00:03:35.030> better<00:03:35.299> the<00:03:35.510> GPU

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
consists of really the better the GPU

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.479 
consists of really the better the GPU
the<00:03:35.959> faster<00:03:36.290> the<00:03:36.380> game<00:03:36.530> runs<00:03:36.769> so<00:03:37.010> if<00:03:37.069> you<00:03:37.250> turn

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:37.489 
the faster the game runs so if you turn

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:39.250 
the faster the game runs so if you turn
these<00:03:37.610> down<00:03:37.880> it<00:03:38.390> means<00:03:38.660> you<00:03:38.810> lose<00:03:38.959> a<00:03:39.019> bit<00:03:39.200> of

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260 
these down it means you lose a bit of

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:43.060 
these down it means you lose a bit of
quality<00:03:39.650> of<00:03:39.709> you<00:03:39.890> the<00:03:41.380> game<00:03:42.380> the<00:03:42.829> gaming

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:43.070 
quality of you the game the gaming

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:45.789 
quality of you the game the gaming
performance<00:03:43.310> increases<00:03:44.299> so<00:03:44.540> much<00:03:44.780> and<00:03:45.049> at<00:03:45.709> the

00:03:45.789 --> 00:03:45.799 
performance increases so much and at the

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:48.670 
performance increases so much and at the
end<00:03:45.950> of<00:03:46.070> the<00:03:46.130> day<00:03:46.280> it's<00:03:47.269> not<00:03:47.390> that<00:03:47.780> bad<00:03:47.930> another

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680 
end of the day it's not that bad another

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:51.250 
end of the day it's not that bad another
way<00:03:48.890> of<00:03:49.010> doing<00:03:49.160> this<00:03:49.459> is<00:03:49.519> to<00:03:49.790> just<00:03:50.269> reduce<00:03:50.660> the

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.260 
way of doing this is to just reduce the

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:52.660 
way of doing this is to just reduce the
resolution<00:03:51.410> of<00:03:51.890> the<00:03:51.980> game<00:03:52.190> a<00:03:52.370> lower

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670 
resolution of the game a lower

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:55.270 
resolution of the game a lower
resolution<00:03:52.910> game<00:03:53.480> quickest<00:03:54.049> way<00:03:54.200> to<00:03:54.280> improve

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.280 
resolution game quickest way to improve

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.280 
resolution game quickest way to improve
game<00:03:55.519> performance<00:03:56.150> but<00:03:56.540> do<00:03:56.690> this<00:03:56.810> chain

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
game performance but do this chain

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:59.710 
game performance but do this chain
tourney's<00:03:57.799> setting<00:03:58.340> down<00:03:58.519> first<00:03:58.820> because

00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 
tourney's setting down first because

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.830 
tourney's setting down first because
they<00:04:00.440> don't<00:04:01.100> sacrifice<00:04:01.340> as<00:04:01.730> much<00:04:02.030> quality<00:04:02.450> of

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 
they don't sacrifice as much quality of

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.050 
they don't sacrifice as much quality of
the<00:04:02.930> game<00:04:03.160> okay<00:04:04.160> guys<00:04:04.400> so<00:04:04.640> next<00:04:04.820> thing<00:04:04.910> you

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:05.060 
the game okay guys so next thing you

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:06.430 
the game okay guys so next thing you
want<00:04:05.209> to<00:04:05.269> go<00:04:05.390> and<00:04:05.510> do<00:04:05.600> is<00:04:05.810> go<00:04:06.049> down<00:04:06.109> to<00:04:06.230> this

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440

estate<00:04:26.400> so<00:04:26.850> that's<00:04:27.290> how<00:04:28.290> little<00:04:28.890> you<00:04:29.580> can<00:04:29.760> have

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:30.140 
estate so that's how little you can have

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:34.310 
estate so that's how little you can have
when<00:04:31.140> how<00:04:31.770> little<00:04:32.010> how<00:04:32.700> the<00:04:33.630> smallest<00:04:33.990> amount

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:34.320 
when how little how the smallest amount

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:38.780 
when how little how the smallest amount
of<00:04:35.310> CPU<00:04:35.820> the<00:04:36.630> computer<00:04:37.560> can<00:04:37.710> use<00:04:37.950> when<00:04:38.640> it's

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:38.790 
of CPU the computer can use when it's

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:41.060 
of CPU the computer can use when it's
plugged<00:04:38.940> in<00:04:39.150> so<00:04:39.510> obviously<00:04:39.750> 100<00:04:40.410> percent<00:04:40.710> so

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:41.070 
plugged in so obviously 100 percent so

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:43.370 
plugged in so obviously 100 percent so
it's<00:04:41.520> always<00:04:41.730> so<00:04:42.330> it<00:04:42.420> has<00:04:42.600> to<00:04:42.780> be<00:04:42.900> using<00:04:43.230> all

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:43.380 
it's always so it has to be using all

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:46.820 
it's always so it has to be using all
the<00:04:43.500> CP<00:04:43.830> all<00:04:44.520> of<00:04:44.670> the<00:04:44.760> CPU<00:04:45.270> and<00:04:45.690> off<00:04:46.620> its

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:46.830 
the CP all of the CPU and off its

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:51.140 
the CP all of the CPU and off its
multiple<00:04:47.790> core<00:04:48.000> than<00:04:48.210> all<00:04:48.390> the<00:04:48.540> CPUs<00:04:49.050> and<00:04:50.150> then

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.150 
multiple core than all the CPUs and then

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:53.150 
multiple core than all the CPUs and then
you<00:04:51.270> want<00:04:51.420> to<00:04:51.450> go<00:04:51.600> system<00:04:52.440> calling<00:04:52.650> policy

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:53.160 
you want to go system calling policy

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:57.620 
you want to go system calling policy
this<00:04:53.760> will<00:04:54.030> P<00:04:54.330> be<00:04:54.360> or<00:04:54.800> CPU<00:04:55.800> call<00:04:56.100> and<00:04:57.000> computer

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:57.630 
this will P be or CPU call and computer

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:00.560 
this will P be or CPU call and computer
call<00:04:57.840> so<00:04:58.080> that's<00:04:58.260> more<00:04:59.070> am<00:04:59.580> because<00:04:59.880> computers

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:00.570 
call so that's more am because computers

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:03.530 
call so that's more am because computers
obviously<00:05:00.870> run<00:05:01.110> best<00:05:01.920> about<00:05:02.340> 30<00:05:02.670> 40<00:05:03.210> 50

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:03.540 
obviously run best about 30 40 50

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:05.420 
obviously run best about 30 40 50
degrees<00:05:03.930> so<00:05:04.440> you<00:05:04.500> want<00:05:04.620> to<00:05:04.710> keep<00:05:04.830> the<00:05:05.010> core<00:05:05.220> so

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:05.430 
degrees so you want to keep the core so

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:08.210 
degrees so you want to keep the core so
doesn't<00:05:05.700> overheat<00:05:05.880> as<00:05:06.210> well<00:05:07.040> check<00:05:08.040> my<00:05:08.190> other

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:08.220

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:16.140 
on how to keep it super cool and then

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:19.850 
on how to keep it super cool and then

maximum processes state on battery 100%
obviously<00:05:20.340> you<00:05:20.550> want<00:05:20.670> a<00:05:20.820> hundred<00:05:21.000> percent<00:05:21.450> so

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:22.230 
obviously you want a hundred percent so

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:24.500 
obviously you want a hundred percent so
that<00:05:22.260> Emma<00:05:22.650> doesn't<00:05:22.950> throttle<00:05:23.550> your<00:05:23.760> CPU<00:05:24.270> and

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:24.510 
that Emma doesn't throttle your CPU and

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:26.840 
that Emma doesn't throttle your CPU and

it's<00:05:53.649> how<00:05:53.770> you<00:05:53.830> change<00:05:54.249> it<00:05:54.520> and<00:05:55.270> you've<00:05:55.509> got

00:05:55.619 --> 00:05:55.629 
it's how you change it and you've got

00:05:55.629 --> 00:05:58.949 
it's how you change it and you've got
all<00:05:55.839> these<00:05:55.990> open<00:05:57.119> here<00:05:58.119> and<00:05:58.449> you've<00:05:58.659> got<00:05:58.689> all

00:06:08.349 --> 00:06:09.989 
believe on just be careful though
because<00:06:08.409> sometimes<00:06:08.889> they<00:06:09.339> can<00:06:09.369> mess<00:06:09.759> up<00:06:09.789> your

00:06:09.989 --> 00:06:09.999 
because sometimes they can mess up your

00:06:09.999 --> 00:06:12.600 
because sometimes they can mess up your
computer<00:06:10.479> just<00:06:10.779> go<00:06:11.589> ahead<00:06:11.860> slowly<00:06:12.279> if<00:06:12.550> you

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:12.610 
computer just go ahead slowly if you

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:15.089 
computer just go ahead slowly if you
only<00:06:13.240> close<00:06:13.629> the<00:06:13.719> ones<00:06:13.899> which<00:06:14.050> you<00:06:14.080> know<00:06:14.469> are

00:06:15.089 --> 00:06:15.099 
only close the ones which you know are

00:06:15.099 --> 00:06:18.179 
only close the ones which you know are
definitely<00:06:15.610> not<00:06:16.889> important<00:06:17.889> for<00:06:18.039> your

00:06:18.179 --> 00:06:18.189 
definitely not important for your

00:06:18.189 --> 00:06:19.739 
definitely not important for your
computer<00:06:18.669> usually<00:06:19.300> its<00:06:19.569> background

00:06:19.739 --> 00:06:19.749 
computer usually its background

00:06:19.749 --> 00:06:23.639 
computer usually its background
processes<00:06:20.639> processes<00:06:21.639> aren't<00:06:22.050> useful<00:06:23.050> it's

00:06:23.639 --> 00:06:23.649 
processes processes aren't useful it's

00:06:23.649 --> 00:06:25.769 
processes processes aren't useful it's
just<00:06:23.919> the<00:06:24.099> so<00:06:24.969> don't<00:06:25.149> close<00:06:25.330> any<00:06:25.539> of<00:06:25.659> the

00:06:25.769 --> 00:06:25.779 
just the so don't close any of the

00:06:25.779 --> 00:06:27.629 
just the so don't close any of the
window<00:06:26.080> processes<00:06:26.619> because<00:06:27.249> I<00:06:27.339> would<00:06:27.459> just

00:06:27.629 --> 00:06:27.639 
window processes because I would just

00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:29.219 
window processes because I would just
basically<00:06:27.789> muck<00:06:28.330> up<00:06:28.449> your<00:06:28.569> computer<00:06:28.990> until

00:06:29.219 --> 00:06:29.229 
basically muck up your computer until

00:06:29.229 --> 00:06:31.409 
basically muck up your computer until
you<00:06:29.289> restart<00:06:29.699> then<00:06:30.699> you<00:06:30.879> can<00:06:31.029> look<00:06:31.179> at<00:06:31.300> all

00:06:31.409 --> 00:06:31.419 
you restart then you can look at all

00:06:31.419 --> 00:06:34.079 
you restart then you can look at all
your<00:06:31.569> stuff<00:06:31.899> in<00:06:32.199> performance<00:06:32.800> and<00:06:33.099> see

00:06:34.079 --> 00:06:34.089 
your stuff in performance and see

00:06:34.089 --> 00:06:34.739 
your stuff in performance and see
whether<00:06:34.240> you're<00:06:34.360> getting<00:06:34.449> better

00:06:34.739 --> 00:06:34.749 
whether you're getting better

00:06:34.749 --> 00:06:37.980 
whether you're getting better
performance<00:06:35.319> and<00:06:35.469> whether<00:06:35.589> it's<00:06:35.800> and<00:06:36.990> whether

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:37.990 
performance and whether it's and whether

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:39.749 
performance and whether it's and whether
it's<00:06:38.199> becoming<00:06:38.499> better<00:06:38.740> how<00:06:39.369> much<00:06:39.550> memory

00:06:39.749 --> 00:06:39.759 
it's becoming better how much memory

00:06:39.759 --> 00:06:41.579 
it's becoming better how much memory
using<00:06:40.269> etc<00:06:40.839> and<00:06:41.019> then<00:06:41.139> you<00:06:41.169> want<00:06:41.379> to<00:06:41.409> go<00:06:41.529> to

00:06:41.579 --> 00:06:41.589 
using etc and then you want to go to

00:06:41.589 --> 00:06:43.709 
using etc and then you want to go to
startup<00:06:42.219> and<00:06:42.459> this<00:06:42.849> is<00:06:42.999> important<00:06:43.509> and<00:06:43.659> this

00:06:43.709 --> 00:06:43.719 
startup and this is important and this

00:06:43.719 --> 00:06:46.259 
startup and this is important and this
all<00:06:44.559> you<00:06:44.949> just<00:06:45.129> want<00:06:45.279> to<00:06:45.339> delete<00:06:45.610> as<00:06:45.909> much

00:06:46.259 --> 00:06:46.269 
all you just want to delete as much

00:06:46.269 --> 00:06:48.269 
all you just want to delete as much
stuff<00:06:46.629> and<00:06:46.779> disable<00:06:47.349> as<00:06:47.439> much<00:06:47.769> stuff<00:06:48.009> as<00:06:48.129> you

00:06:48.269 --> 00:06:48.279 
stuff and disable as much stuff as you

00:06:48.279 --> 00:06:50.519 
stuff and disable as much stuff as you
can<00:06:48.309> on<00:06:48.729> here<00:06:48.969> they're<00:06:49.569> going<00:06:49.869> right<00:06:50.259> click

00:06:50.519 --> 00:06:50.529 
can on here they're going right click

00:06:50.529 --> 00:06:54.359 
can on here they're going right click
and<00:06:51.430> going<00:06:51.819> disabled<00:06:52.539> and<00:06:52.809> that<00:06:53.129> will<00:06:54.129> just

00:06:54.359 --> 00:06:54.369 
and going disabled and that will just

00:06:54.369 --> 00:06:56.909 
and going disabled and that will just
speed<00:06:55.180> up<00:06:55.300> your<00:06:55.419> computer<00:06:55.479> from<00:06:56.139> startup<00:06:56.649> and

00:06:56.909 --> 00:06:56.919 
speed up your computer from startup and

00:06:56.919 --> 00:06:59.969 
speed up your computer from startup and
startup<00:06:57.579> and<00:06:57.729> I<00:06:57.819> had<00:06:58.059> a<00:06:58.089> at<00:06:58.990> a<00:06:59.050> minute<00:06:59.469> startup

00:06:59.969 --> 00:06:59.979 
startup and I had a at a minute startup

00:06:59.979 --> 00:07:02.100 
startup and I had a at a minute startup
time<00:07:00.269> disabled<00:07:01.269> all<00:07:01.389> of<00:07:01.539> these<00:07:01.689> because<00:07:01.959> all

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:02.110 
time disabled all of these because all

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:03.449 
time disabled all of these because all
pretty<00:07:02.619> much<00:07:02.740> all<00:07:02.919> of<00:07:03.039> these<00:07:03.129> were<00:07:03.309> and

00:07:03.449 --> 00:07:03.459 
pretty much all of these were and

00:07:03.459 --> 00:07:07.319 
pretty much all of these were and
they've<00:07:03.610> enabled<00:07:04.289> and<00:07:05.289> I<00:07:05.919> got<00:07:06.759> down<00:07:06.909> got<00:07:07.300> it

00:07:07.319 --> 00:07:07.329 
they've enabled and I got down got it

00:07:07.329 --> 00:07:09.179 
they've enabled and I got down got it
down<00:07:07.539> to<00:07:07.689> 15<00:07:08.050> seconds<00:07:08.439> startup<00:07:08.709> time<00:07:08.919> from

00:07:09.179 --> 00:07:09.189 
down to 15 seconds startup time from

00:07:09.189 --> 00:07:13.889 
down to 15 seconds startup time from
cold<00:07:09.459> Pam<00:07:09.939> so<00:07:11.249> it<00:07:12.249> and<00:07:12.819> also<00:07:13.149> if<00:07:13.240> they<00:07:13.419> go<00:07:13.599> if

00:07:13.889 --> 00:07:13.899 
cold Pam so it and also if they go if

00:07:13.899 --> 00:07:15.900 
cold Pam so it and also if they go if
it's<00:07:14.079> low

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:15.910 
it's low

00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:18.210 
it's low
it<00:07:16.000> says<00:07:16.210> startup<00:07:16.930> impact<00:07:17.290> is<00:07:17.410> low-medium

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:18.220 
it says startup impact is low-medium

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:20.520 
it says startup impact is low-medium
then<00:07:19.000> you<00:07:19.150> want<00:07:19.300> to<00:07:19.360> you<00:07:19.840> want<00:07:19.990> to<00:07:20.110> turn<00:07:20.410> them

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:20.530 
then you want to you want to turn them

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:22.440 
then you want to you want to turn them
off<00:07:20.620> and<00:07:20.920> if<00:07:21.520> it's<00:07:21.670> none<00:07:21.910> than<00:07:22.120> you<00:07:22.240> may<00:07:22.390> as

off and if it's none than you may as

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:23.730 
off and if it's none than you may as
well<00:07:22.570> turn<00:07:22.780> them<00:07:22.960> off<00:07:23.050> as<00:07:23.260> well<00:07:23.410> and<00:07:23.590> Leslie

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:35.470 
computer on the needle on

00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:38.700 
computer on the needle on
even<00:07:36.190> enabled<00:07:37.020> once<00:07:38.020> again<00:07:38.260> don't<00:07:38.500> turn

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:38.710
