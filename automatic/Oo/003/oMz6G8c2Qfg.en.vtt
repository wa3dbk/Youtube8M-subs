 can be transported by car 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:30.210
 but still fully prepared with them for you safety is up to date 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.480
 Findings on the subject he grows lives maintenance fuse equalized 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:35.440
 also 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.170
 he wanted that right 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.000
 Tips and tricks for changing tires and for upgrading 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.990
 the times when you as a bike decompose awkwardly and in the 

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:48.039
 Trying to pack your luggage is a thing of the past 

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:52.410
 meanwhile, the taz innumerable possibilities for attachment from the outside 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.130
 which system is right for which vehicle and where the respective one 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:57.270
 Advantages lie 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.270
 we did research for you with a specialist 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:02.320
 here at Areal 12 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.190
 Demands HecktrÃ¤ger for believing children romp convinced April 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.920
 whichever is fixed on +4 up to four bikes that is safer too 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.220
 when braking or up 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.409
 should something happen in a row the bikes have to stay 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.219
 on the vehicle but rammed again made some entry but a 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:25.560
 Dahms is the fair clearly all of Volkswagen has been tested it 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:27.430
 the first one is 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:30.940
 Lincolns and so much time for a tire change 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:35.190
 Where but with the winter tires phone book, these complex no 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:36.370
 be stored 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:39.380
 which is always special I do not care 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.310
 we stand on the shelf 5 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.160
 to be watched is hereby 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.930
 Percent that the Windreich 34 so give up the race 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:50.220
 Wherever you pay attention it should not be enough of phase before 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.910
 Talk about vehicles and get the seal the talks are called 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:57.710
 but the possibility with stickers provided here is Barca better with 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.160
 Make chalk or something 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.550
 yes what should the air pressure over heights of the shipowners 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:05.550
 and the Prader should be stored cool and dry 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:12.429
 he is in the mouth now 

00:02:13.119 --> 00:02:16.019
 more than 2 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:18.379
 because he is not premature sex now 

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:20.569
 unsecured cargo 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:25.090
 The dream of a vacation quickly becomes a nightmare. Ehingen 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.520
 Forts Dan in Erding must always be placed in such a way that they do not touch any 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:30.679
 Case can be thrown forward 

00:02:30.679 --> 00:02:34.749
 because those are the worst accidents frontal collisions at speeds 

00:02:34.749 --> 00:02:38.419
 From 50 kilometers per hour, each unsecured item becomes one 

00:02:38.419 --> 00:02:42.489
 Bullet many motorists underestimate the power in the secured 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:46.579
 Pieces of luggage in the event of an emergency stop or impact due to an accident 

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:47.969
 can develop 

00:02:47.969 --> 00:02:52.930
 even smaller objects are used for quick fire here you can see parts 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.930
 the more flown that is called 

00:02:57.449 --> 00:03:01.119
 Customers go relatively high mass now I also want the driver 

00:03:01.119 --> 00:03:04.549
 or applause can also hit their interests on the head too 

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:05.529
 still the right place 

00:03:05.529 --> 00:03:07.279
 cause the most serious injuries 

00:03:07.279 --> 00:03:11.159
 Men over there after he can still Marco before that complete 

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:13.039
 the whole vehicle started 

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:16.869
 and Lammert at the end around here on the lap so that's the name 

00:03:16.869 --> 00:03:19.909
 Result if you look at all inmates naturally will be very 

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:23.379
 Missing by properly loaded can already be a first security 

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:23.920
 create 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.500
 Heavy suitcases should be loaded first, then follow the lighter ones 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:28.829
 luggage 

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:31.809
 quite clearly the charge should not be suffered if possible 

00:03:31.809 --> 00:03:34.239
 Friederike therefore lay go 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:38.089
 But if more b-lay must be on vacation 

00:03:38.089 --> 00:03:41.129
 then we had a stable cargo space Kampeter 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:44.130
 or nothing in any case 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:45.309
 be installed 

00:03:45.309 --> 00:03:48.309
 Help make an extra blanket 

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:50.319
 March disappeared 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:53.979
 ensures adequate safety even in extreme situations 

00:03:56.309 --> 00:03:59.930
 For many motorists sees the spring but also the same again 

00:03:59.929 --> 00:04:03.809
 Opportunity the beloved wide tires inclusive start to the vehicle 

00:04:03.809 --> 00:04:04.589
 benefit 

00:04:04.589 --> 00:04:08.449
 but there are also lurking questions there are many are not so aware 

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:12.859
 for many mostly young road users 

00:04:12.859 --> 00:04:17.109
 We're ready to help around 500 yards to prove that you're just too 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:20.209
 use and wish of the mobile pedestal 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:21.419
 but right here 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:23.930
 the dangers 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:25.039
 main problem 

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:26.749
 is that the whole situation 

00:04:26.749 --> 00:04:28.819
 say suspension a gearbox 

00:04:28.819 --> 00:04:30.990
 So it can be broken 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:34.990
 then the wheel bearings are mainly heavily loaded by the 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:37.400
 Lowering role for the latter arise 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.760
 there could be own especially in the north that the warning 

00:04:40.759 --> 00:04:43.009
 damaged will strike 

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:45.860
 then the whole round before the end can break 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:49.800
 He is doing it before the conversion only after a specialist workshop overtake 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.150
 then there are no bad surprises later 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:57.320
 when it comes to equipment or transport, the safety is still there 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:58.430
 first place 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:02.620
 have seen there are many ways to reduce these children 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:04.909
 or not even let arise 

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:09.330
 the next time, by the way, the premiere is announced for us, we'll do it for you 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:13.189
 new also not AR three card July before I am already looking forward to victory until 

00:05:13.189 --> 00:05:14.949
 then ServusTV and always good trip
