and they wanted to see the top 10 sounds
on<00:00:10.620> runescape<00:00:11.219> that<00:00:11.670> everybody<00:00:12.059> would

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
on runescape that everybody would

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.539 
on runescape that everybody would
immediately<00:00:12.690> recognize<00:00:13.110> I<00:00:13.860> thought<00:00:14.400> this

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
immediately recognize I thought this

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.099 
immediately recognize I thought this
video<00:00:14.790> could<00:00:14.940> be<00:00:15.030> really<00:00:15.269> fun<00:00:15.299> and<00:00:15.719> because

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
video could be really fun and because

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:17.599 
video could be really fun and because
there<00:00:16.379> are<00:00:16.529> so<00:00:16.740> many<00:00:16.830> sounds<00:00:17.279> in<00:00:17.369> runescape

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
there are so many sounds in runescape

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.099 
there are so many sounds in runescape
I've<00:00:17.970> decided<00:00:18.300> to<00:00:18.449> turn<00:00:19.140> it<00:00:19.289> into<00:00:19.470> a<00:00:19.650> top<00:00:20.070> 25

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:21.109 
I've decided to turn it into a top 25

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:23.900 
I've decided to turn it into a top 25
basically<00:00:22.109> after<00:00:22.380> I<00:00:22.680> read<00:00:23.070> the<00:00:23.250> number<00:00:23.550> of<00:00:23.730> the

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
basically after I read the number of the

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:34.059 
videos I make anyway so this was just my
little<00:06:32.389> attempt<00:06:32.750> to<00:06:32.900> try<00:06:33.199> and<00:06:33.319> get<00:06:33.469> you<00:06:33.650> to<00:06:33.680> get

back<00:06:34.520> into<00:06:34.759> the<00:06:35.180> game<00:06:35.330> I'm<00:06:35.569> just<00:06:35.599> kidding<00:06:35.960> in

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:36.680

all<00:06:36.860> seriousness<00:06:37.099> though<00:06:37.550> I<00:06:37.729> figured<00:06:38.270> since

00:06:38.409 --> 00:06:38.419 
all seriousness though I figured since

00:06:38.419 --> 00:06:40.450 
all seriousness though I figured since
some<00:06:38.659> of<00:06:38.690> you<00:06:38.870> don't<00:06:39.110> play<00:06:39.409> anymore<00:06:39.680> I<00:06:40.069> thought

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:40.460

you<00:06:42.409> to<00:06:42.529> be<00:06:42.620> able<00:06:42.710> to<00:06:42.830> hear<00:06:43.039> the<00:06:43.159> game<00:06:43.340> sounds
