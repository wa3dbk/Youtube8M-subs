honored to do a guest post for Robert
grants<00:00:09.480> learn<00:00:10.260> my<00:00:10.530> shot<00:00:11.040> site<00:00:11.400> I<00:00:11.670> need<00:00:12.540> to

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
grants learn my shot site I need to

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.180 
grants learn my shot site I need to
learn<00:00:12.780> a<00:00:13.080> little<00:00:13.230> bit<00:00:13.440> more<00:00:13.590> about<00:00:13.799> lighting

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
learn a little bit more about lighting

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.390 
learn a little bit more about lighting
so<00:00:14.639> I<00:00:14.670> decided<00:00:15.059> to<00:00:15.150> replicate<00:00:15.929> one<00:00:16.410> of<00:00:16.440> Roberts

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
so I decided to replicate one of Roberts

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.000 
so I decided to replicate one of Roberts
tutorials<00:00:18.060> and<00:00:18.359> in<00:00:18.779> the<00:00:18.900> process<00:00:19.470> show<00:00:19.800> the

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
tutorials and in the process show the

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.890 
tutorials and in the process show the
difference<00:00:20.310> between<00:00:20.520> the<00:00:21.119> normal<00:00:21.480> clamp

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
difference between the normal clamp

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.170 
difference between the normal clamp
light<00:00:22.260> and<00:00:22.500> the<00:00:22.949> halogen<00:00:23.400> work<00:00:23.580> lights<00:00:23.850> that

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
light and the halogen work lights that

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.330 
light and the halogen work lights that
I'm<00:00:24.330> using<00:00:24.779> to<00:00:25.140> light<00:00:25.289> this<00:00:25.470> video<00:00:25.769> the

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
I'm using to light this video the

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.189 
I'm using to light this video the
tutorial<00:00:26.760> I'm<00:00:26.849> trying<00:00:27.119> to<00:00:27.210> replicate<00:00:27.390> is<00:00:27.960> on

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
tutorial I'm trying to replicate is on

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.160 
tutorial I'm trying to replicate is on
shiny<00:00:28.650> reflective<00:00:29.220> objects<00:00:29.849> where<00:00:30.240> Robert

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
shiny reflective objects where Robert

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.139 
shiny reflective objects where Robert
shoots<00:00:31.470> some<00:00:31.800> flatware<00:00:32.160> so<00:00:32.550> let's<00:00:32.759> go<00:00:32.880> into<00:00:33.030> my

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
shoots some flatware so let's go into my

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.900 
shoots some flatware so let's go into my
studio<00:00:33.360> and<00:00:33.750> see<00:00:34.230> how<00:00:34.380> I<00:00:34.440> do<00:00:34.559> here<00:00:35.250> my<00:00:35.399> flatware

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
studio and see how I do here my flatware

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.940 
studio and see how I do here my flatware
is<00:00:36.059> not<00:00:36.300> exactly<00:00:36.780> like<00:00:37.020> Roberts<00:00:37.500> but<00:00:37.829> it's

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
is not exactly like Roberts but it's

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.220 
is not exactly like Roberts but it's
pretty<00:00:38.219> reflective<00:00:38.579> so<00:00:39.180> it<00:00:39.270> should<00:00:39.510> work<00:00:39.719> we

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
pretty reflective so it should work we

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.530 
pretty reflective so it should work we
already<00:00:40.469> know<00:00:40.649> from<00:00:40.890> Roberts<00:00:41.340> example<00:00:41.910> that

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
already know from Roberts example that

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.119 
already know from Roberts example that
we're<00:00:42.690> gonna<00:00:42.870> need<00:00:43.079> some<00:00:43.320> diffusion<00:00:43.680> so<00:00:44.070> I

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
we're gonna need some diffusion so I

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.639 
we're gonna need some diffusion so I
puts<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:44.550> exact<00:00:44.969> same<00:00:45.480> paper<00:00:45.960> that<00:00:46.289> Robert

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
puts the exact same paper that Robert

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.040 
puts the exact same paper that Robert
uses<00:00:46.860> and<00:00:47.190> I<00:00:47.700> will<00:00:47.910> stretch<00:00:48.210> it<00:00:48.390> out<00:00:48.480> over<00:00:48.660> the

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
uses and I will stretch it out over the

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.590 
uses and I will stretch it out over the
flat<00:00:49.320> where<00:00:49.590> all<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.579> way<00:00:50.700> from<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.120> camera

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
flat where all the way from the camera

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.720 
flat where all the way from the camera
to<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:51.899> back<00:00:52.170> of<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.469> desk<00:00:52.680> so<00:00:53.219> looking<00:00:53.489> at<00:00:53.610> my

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
to the back of the desk so looking at my

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.090 
to the back of the desk so looking at my
camera<00:00:54.059> settings<00:00:54.300> I'm<00:00:55.170> in<00:00:55.320> aperture<00:00:55.680> priority

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
camera settings I'm in aperture priority

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.670 
camera settings I'm in aperture priority
mode<00:00:56.430> like<00:00:56.760> Robert's<00:00:57.180> tutorial<00:00:57.629> so<00:00:58.230> we<00:00:58.379> set

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
mode like Robert's tutorial so we set

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.740 
mode like Robert's tutorial so we set
the<00:00:58.829> aperture<00:00:59.010> value<00:00:59.430> and<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.359> camera

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
the aperture value and the camera

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.720 
the aperture value and the camera
controls<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.350> shutter<00:01:01.530> speed<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:02.160> lens<00:01:02.520> I'm

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
controls the shutter speed the lens I'm

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.870 
controls the shutter speed the lens I'm
using<00:01:02.940> is<00:01:03.300> not<00:01:03.329> as<00:01:03.809> wide<00:01:04.080> as<00:01:04.350> Roberts<00:01:04.830> but<00:01:05.610> it

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
using is not as wide as Roberts but it

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.170 
using is not as wide as Roberts but it
should<00:01:06.150> get<00:01:06.270> as<00:01:06.390> close<00:01:06.659> its<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.650> 18<00:01:08.280> to<00:01:08.490> 135

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
should get as close its the 18 to 135

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.190 
should get as close its the 18 to 135

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
long and here is my first shot with the

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.179 
long and here is my first shot with the
clamp<00:01:29.759> light<00:01:30.030> with<00:01:30.509> 150<00:01:31.259> watts<00:01:31.470> it<00:01:31.920> looks

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
clamp light with 150 watts it looks

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.190 
clamp light with 150 watts it looks
pretty<00:01:32.490> good<00:01:32.759> but<00:01:33.060> let's<00:01:33.600> see<00:01:33.750> how<00:01:33.869> it<00:01:33.990> looks

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
pretty good but let's see how it looks

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.950 
pretty good but let's see how it looks
when<00:01:34.740> I<00:01:34.799> use<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.520> halogen<00:01:35.729> worklight<00:01:36.479> the

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
when I use the halogen worklight the

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.819 
when I use the halogen worklight the
halogen<00:01:37.439> is<00:01:37.650> 250<00:01:38.640> watts<00:01:38.850> so<00:01:39.750> I'm<00:01:39.840> guessing<00:01:40.320> the

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
halogen is 250 watts so I'm guessing the

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.440 
halogen is 250 watts so I'm guessing the
shutter<00:01:41.070> speed<00:01:41.430> is<00:01:41.670> going<00:01:41.909> to<00:01:42.000> be<00:01:42.090> a<00:01:42.210> bit

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
shutter speed is going to be a bit

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.870 
shutter speed is going to be a bit
quicker<00:01:42.750> well<00:01:43.229> to<00:01:43.680> be<00:01:43.829> honest<00:01:44.189> I'm<00:01:44.670> not

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
quicker well to be honest I'm not

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.490 
quicker well to be honest I'm not
noticing<00:01:45.479> a<00:01:45.570> big<00:01:45.720> difference<00:01:45.780> at<00:01:46.290> all<00:01:46.439> between

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
noticing a big difference at all between

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.340 
noticing a big difference at all between
the<00:01:46.890> halogen<00:01:47.460> and<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.670> clamp<00:01:47.909> leg<00:01:48.180> so<00:01:49.140> give<00:01:49.320> it

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
the halogen and the clamp leg so give it

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.590 
the halogen and the clamp leg so give it
a<00:01:49.470> try<00:01:49.500> like<00:01:49.890> I<00:01:50.040> did<00:01:50.280> and<00:01:50.490> share<00:01:51.000> your<00:01:51.119> results

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
a try like I did and share your results

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.210 
a try like I did and share your results
I<00:01:51.750> want<00:01:52.020> to<00:01:52.079> thank<00:01:52.200> Robert<00:01:52.470> for<00:01:52.619> letting<00:01:53.009> me<00:01:53.100> do
