00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:07.950
 Hi there, but the presentation of the iphone 6 is not enough 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:11.009
 who are lucky enough to see him live 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:13.440
 but not us ladies and gentlemen this 

00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:15.809
 real iphone 6 to bolt and to 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.210
 screw iphone 6 turned out just such 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.340
 what was the image of layouts and 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.590
 the joys of the drawings with the details is a hundred 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.600
 percent so as intended 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.250
 on / off button 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.990
 moved to the side and there she was 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.060
 the very place due to the fact that the displays 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.579
 increased in size from 4 to 4 and 7 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.859
 inches grew and the phone itself compared 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.620
 with iphone 5s iphone 6 seems normal 

00:00:34.859 --> 00:00:39.960
 for 2014 gadget with quite 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.089
 adequate size compared to 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.579
 the last model iphone 6 decreased in 

00:00:42.089 --> 00:00:47.100
 thickness but as a result increased in 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.469
 width and height by the way in my hands 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.940
 space gray iphone 6 back cover color 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.489
 same as iphone 5s 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.629
 this is clearly visible unfortunately back apple 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.120
 did not become luminous 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.890
 but apple remembered iphone 2g and 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.440
 made in iphone 6 metallic 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.600
 cut apple and what's interesting is itself 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.370
 the apple is made of so-called alloy 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.100
 metals liquid metal 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:09.650
 this is the very metal of the future its difficult 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.830
 scratch it well 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.290
 self repairing 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.390
 and perfectly resistant to rose and like 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.120
 expected body made of alloys 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.160
 aluminum and top and bottom covered 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:22.770
 gray plastic inserts 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:25.050
 there is an antenna for receiving the signal 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.060
 iphone 6 has practical unibody 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:29.700
 the case is like on a macbook it is absolutely 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.980
 solid and even this is plastic top she 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.230
 does not divide the body into parts so that you do not 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:36.210
 thought it was a mock or fake we 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:38.340
 disassembled iphone 6 it is absolutely 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.360
 original product and motherboard 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.880
 things like that 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.480
 this incredible display has it all 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.190
 plumes 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:46.830
 we also have a white display which 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:48.570
 quite nice but detailed 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.040
 Considering you can see that iphone 6 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.440
 running on apple chip 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:55.050
 a8 on system board also detected 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:57.330
 nfc module uranium front of the case 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:00.180
 as if the screen is streamlined rounded by 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:02.670
 The edges are incredibly beautiful by the way this 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.560
 not sapphire unfortunately technologically 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.170
 such a sapphire crystal make very 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.729
 hard and very expensive is another glass 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.709
 knows how to 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.379
 Can be sandwiched tempered sapphires 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:14.970
 glass but sure it is even nicer 

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:17.519
 sensations and more transparent 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.230
 tachadi button is not convex and in size 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:21.209
 It is comparable to iphone 5s but 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.580
 diminished ring itself in button a 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:25.680
 sensor area has increased and in fact 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.420
 tachadi should work better if 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.010
 you can look at the top of the panel 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.540
 notice that the face time camera is now 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.390
 is not above the speaker 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.459
 and the side as it was iphone 4 4s 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.079
 in general outwardly iphone 6 is a big ipod 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:39.659
 touch fifth generation volume buttons 

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:42.090
 on the side face the same lower part 

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:44.250
 speaker and microphone again ideas under 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.670
 look new under lightning nowhere 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.370
 gone 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.170
 it is he who is unchanged sim tray 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.450
 the right was used nanosim 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.609
 the principle of its operation is the same flash 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.590
 left double she is called labor he 

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:57.900
 many worried because of this that she 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.510
 round again can exhale inside 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.920
 there giving a light bulb for contrast but here 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.739
 the camera itself now bulges out of the case 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.720
 how on ipod touch please and it is unlikely 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:07.560
 but the module may be improved and in such 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.599
 slim body 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:12.329
 he did not fit so had to go 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:14.549
 on the sacrifices you want to know how he lies in 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:15.810
 hand he lies cool comfortable he 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:20.150
 really cool 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:20.150
 before iphone 6 will blast the market
