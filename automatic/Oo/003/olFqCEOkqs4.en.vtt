00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
what I noticed is that this machine

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.280 
what I noticed is that this machine
itself<00:02:31.590> is<00:02:31.920> entirely<00:02:32.790> wrong<00:02:33.210> I<00:02:33.540> won't<00:02:34.170> say

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
itself is entirely wrong I won't say

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.750 
itself is entirely wrong I won't say
entirely<00:02:34.830> but<00:02:35.010> it's<00:02:35.070> not<00:02:36.650> what<00:02:37.650> is<00:02:37.890> in<00:02:38.340> the

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
entirely but it's not what is in the
