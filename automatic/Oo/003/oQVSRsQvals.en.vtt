00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:12.870
 how they arrive as they come 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.750
 these last days for the restart of the 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.480
 tournament after the incentive that 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.090
 it meant the victory against river by 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.900
 the argentine cup 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:27.070
 a minimum of a long week we have left 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:30.230
 several days because party is the only 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:32.180
 training a lot 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:34.460
 trying to prepare the party the 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.560
 better way to try to bring a 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:40.080
 trick 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:45.310
 river was a good sign that the recess 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:49.420
 did not affect the game of central they continue 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:51.240
 lit on that continue in good 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:55.830
 harmony among you 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:57.630
 yes yes we come the recess we made a 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:01:00.060
 great preseason 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:03.000
 and well worked a lot completed is 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:05.250
 task is always the same good luck 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.090
 we can make a good match to spend 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:11.700
 of phase not with river had few 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:15.050
 shots to the arch beyond the two 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.520
 goals in the tournament in recent dates 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:19.159
 they averaged one goal per 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.740
 meeting 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:25.149
 that they are talking about among you is 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.149
 an issue that concerns us 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:30.690
 now we go in a lot and we know 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:30.690
 that we have to 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:36.520
 and that's not for situations of the 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:39.880
 party but good we are calm 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:42.160
 we have a good game idea and tries 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:45.550
 to do the best possible for the 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:48.040
 party and personally 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:49.780
 speaks with the coaching staff with your 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.820
 mates or yourself makes a 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.760
 self-criticism from not kicking made to what 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:56.420
 better not to make a play besides look 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:02:00.350
 a pass 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.580
 no no no no i try to do it the best 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.439
 possible 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.750
 we do not speak we speak many things not 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:09.830
 only from that we have many things for 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:11.340
 improve and good to try to achieve it has not 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.540
 been 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.000
 before the break between you 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.859
 a long tournament of type of expectations 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.890
 have for this second batch of 

00:02:17.859 --> 00:02:24.330
 matches of the tournament final in the 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:27.060
 need to remain protagonists 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:30.270
 the same as when we started the 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:32.900
 year to be the protagonist of trying to go to 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:37.650
 all the courts make our game and 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:38.910
 make a good a protagonist in what 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.980
 What is left of these six months, which is very 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:43.800
 important for us 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:46.159
 you see teams like river or mouth that 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.159
 they bring 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:52.750
 after having 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.960
 of the tournament with central fighting there 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:59.540
 above you think they're going to start being 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:02.720
 disadvantaged in that fight 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.720
 why 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:08.420
 a good semester and I think we have a 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:12.110
 great staff to face our 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:14.910
 objectives and good as well as we started 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:16.650
 with a good semester and we believe in the 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.700
 campus that we have and the truth is very 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.440
 happy for that 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.010
 in the first semester next to river 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.140
 were 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:26.000
 one of the teams that scored the most points 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:29.739
 as a visitor what do you think 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.739
 that is due that merit they have 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:39.240
 I do not know what to meditate but there not 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:42.780
 and go as a visitor and plant a star 

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:46.380
 of the game out there is good too and 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:48.480
 good happy to achieve that point of 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:50.370
 visitor who did very important and for 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.230
 last as you think they are going to 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.180
 face the rivals here what 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.700
 is of tournament taking into account that 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:58.140
 they already know everything good they have achieved 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.450
 you in the first stage of the 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:05.750
 championship 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:07.760
 and if they do not know them, they are more or 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:09.640
 less the quality that we have but good 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.560
 We trust 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:15.180
 in us our our game and 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.180
 deal was seized is
