00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
these panels up like that

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.600 
these panels up like that
see<00:02:07.200> there's<00:02:07.380> a<00:02:07.470> tab<00:02:07.920> there<00:02:08.190> that<00:02:08.340> goes<00:02:08.490> into

nicely I bet you do so you fold these
around<00:02:16.140> worked<00:02:16.590> it<00:02:16.740> up<00:02:16.920> so<00:02:17.670> the<00:02:17.790> button<00:02:18.030> is

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
around worked it up so the button is

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.780 
around worked it up so the button is
showing<00:02:19.610> so<00:02:20.610> pull<00:02:21.120> it<00:02:21.240> around<00:02:21.360> flip<00:02:22.290> it<00:02:22.440> around

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
have them in tank mode I actually really

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:12.650 
have them in tank mode I actually really
like<00:03:10.920> the<00:03:11.040> tank<00:03:11.280> mode<00:03:11.459> even<00:03:12.420> though<00:03:12.540> it's

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
like the tank mode even though it's

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.840 
like the tank mode even though it's
completely<00:03:13.260> unrealistic<00:03:13.769> like<00:03:14.340> it<00:03:14.459> should<00:03:14.670> be

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
completely unrealistic like it should be

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.600 
completely unrealistic like it should be
because<00:03:14.940> it's<00:03:15.180> one<00:03:15.600> apart<00:03:15.930> too<00:03:16.280> just<00:03:17.280> like<00:03:17.400> the

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
because it's one apart too just like the

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:19.610 
because it's one apart too just like the
tank<00:03:17.850> sorry<00:03:18.510> the<00:03:18.660> jet<00:03:18.840> mode<00:03:19.080> it<00:03:19.230> is<00:03:19.350> very

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
tank sorry the jet mode it is very

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.100 
tank sorry the jet mode it is very
unrealistic<00:03:20.130> but<00:03:20.550> still<00:03:20.880> very<00:03:21.090> very<00:03:21.870> cool

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
unrealistic but still very very cool

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.550 
unrealistic but still very very cool
it's<00:03:22.470> definitely<00:03:22.830> my<00:03:22.920> favorite<00:03:23.250> mode<00:03:24.560> again

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
it's definitely my favorite mode again

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.380 
it's definitely my favorite mode again
it<00:03:25.860> has<00:03:25.950> the<00:03:26.100> wheels<00:03:26.310> on<00:03:26.489> the<00:03:26.519> bottom<00:03:26.700> so<00:03:27.360> you

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
it has the wheels on the bottom so you

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:30.830 
it has the wheels on the bottom so you
can<00:03:28.070> roll<00:03:29.070> it<00:03:29.190> around<00:03:29.280> really<00:03:30.239> just<00:03:30.600> slides

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
can roll it around really just slides

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.240 
can roll it around really just slides
because<00:03:31.049> as<00:03:31.320> usual<00:03:31.470> the<00:03:31.739> wheels<00:03:31.920> aren't<00:03:32.100> that

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
because as usual the wheels aren't that

00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:59.690 
you want to do being pulled up hands
will<00:04:58.500> probably<00:04:58.530> already<00:04:58.920> be<00:04:59.070> folded<00:04:59.460> up<00:04:59.580> and

00:04:59.690 --> 00:04:59.700 
will probably already be folded up and

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:03.770 
will probably already be folded up and
pull<00:05:00.060> the<00:05:00.360> legs<00:05:00.570> down<00:05:00.860> um<00:05:02.210> what<00:05:03.210> you<00:05:03.300> do<00:05:03.510> is<00:05:03.570> you

pull the legs down um what you do is you
untag<00:05:04.230> see<00:05:05.540> tank<00:05:06.540> turret<00:05:07.070> here<00:05:08.180> flip<00:05:09.180> this<00:05:09.390> and

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:09.690 
untag see tank turret here flip this and

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:12.940 
untag see tank turret here flip this and
half<00:05:10.200> actually<00:05:10.970> fold<00:05:11.970> the<00:05:12.120> head<00:05:12.270> back<00:05:12.450> up

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:12.950 
half actually fold the head back up

half actually fold the head back up
what's<00:05:13.950> this<00:05:14.100> in<00:05:14.280> half<00:05:14.400> and<00:05:14.610> I'll<00:05:14.670> splits<00:05:15.060> the

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:15.180 
what's this in half and I'll splits the

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:18.560 
what's this in half and I'll splits the
arms<00:05:15.360> in<00:05:15.450> half<00:05:15.800> forms<00:05:16.800> around<00:05:16.940> so<00:05:17.940> they'll<00:05:18.450> be

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:18.570 
arms in half forms around so they'll be

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:20.690 
arms in half forms around so they'll be
like<00:05:18.750> that<00:05:18.930> hold<00:05:19.680> down<00:05:19.800> the<00:05:19.950> arms<00:05:20.220> float<00:05:20.460> these

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:20.700 
like that hold down the arms float these

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:24.590 
like that hold down the arms float these
around<00:05:21.590> put<00:05:22.590> on<00:05:22.740> the<00:05:22.830> arm<00:05:23.040> flip<00:05:23.550> it<00:05:23.580> around<00:05:23.730> old

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:24.600 
around put on the arm flip it around old

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:32.510 
around put on the arm flip it around old
wings<00:05:24.870> down<00:05:27.020> rotate<00:05:28.020> the<00:05:28.260> head<00:05:28.470> around<00:05:31.520> just

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:32.520 
wings down rotate the head around just

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:36.020 
wings down rotate the head around just
the<00:05:32.670> arms<00:05:32.940> and<00:05:33.030> everything<00:05:34.580> then<00:05:35.580> what<00:05:35.790> you<00:05:35.880> do

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:36.030 
the arms and everything then what you do

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:39.710 
the arms and everything then what you do
so<00:05:36.600> you<00:05:36.660> fold<00:05:36.930> up<00:05:37.080> this<00:05:37.940> there's<00:05:38.940> a<00:05:39.030> tab<00:05:39.450> there

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:39.720 
so you fold up this there's a tab there

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:42.830 
so you fold up this there's a tab there
that<00:05:39.900> goes<00:05:39.960> into<00:05:40.110> that<00:05:40.200> hole<00:05:40.470> again<00:05:41.840> get

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:42.840 
that goes into that hole again get

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:45.470 
that goes into that hole again get
problems<00:05:43.760> push<00:05:44.760> it<00:05:44.910> all<00:05:45.030> the<00:05:45.060> way<00:05:45.150> then<00:05:45.390> you

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:45.480 
problems push it all the way then you

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:47.720 
problems push it all the way then you
can<00:05:45.600> fold<00:05:45.750> the<00:05:45.900> wings<00:05:46.020> back<00:05:46.440> up<00:05:46.650> hold<00:05:47.520> these<00:05:47.670> up

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:47.730 
can fold the wings back up hold these up

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:51.920 
can fold the wings back up hold these up
and<00:05:48.120> then<00:05:48.690> you<00:05:48.810> have<00:05:49.760> split<00:05:50.760> swing<00:05:51.060> in<00:05:51.420> his

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:51.930 
and then you have split swing in his

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:56.570 
and then you have split swing in his
little<00:05:52.710> bot<00:05:52.890> mode<00:05:54.770> it's<00:05:55.770> got<00:05:55.920> to<00:05:56.040> get<00:05:56.160> them<00:05:56.250> all

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:56.580 
little bot mode it's got to get them all

up like in the show but just not it's
not<00:06:42.440> really<00:06:42.680> a<00:06:42.710> big<00:06:42.740> loss<00:06:43.070> for<00:06:43.990> articulation

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:44.990

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:51.230 
to Terra to 360 degrees they can go out

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:54.760 
to Terra to 360 degrees they can go out
send<00:06:52.040> it<00:06:52.160> two<00:06:53.060> points<00:06:53.390> at<00:06:53.480> the<00:06:53.510> elbow<00:06:53.960> for<00:06:54.680> it

send it two points at the elbow for it

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:56.530 
send it two points at the elbow for it
to<00:06:54.830> 360<00:06:55.280> degrees<00:06:55.700> the<00:06:56.030> upper<00:06:56.240> part<00:06:56.390> of<00:06:56.420> the<00:06:56.480> arm

to 360 degrees the upper part of the arm

00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:59.110 
to 360 degrees the upper part of the arm
first<00:06:57.170> can<00:06:57.380> go<00:06:57.500> in<00:06:57.740> and<00:06:58.010> is<00:06:58.640> like<00:06:58.670> to<00:06:58.880> keep<00:06:59.000> it

00:06:59.110 --> 00:06:59.120 
first can go in and is like to keep it

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:01.270 
first can go in and is like to keep it
forward<00:06:59.390> and<00:06:59.690> back<00:06:59.930> bend<00:07:00.590> at<00:07:00.740> the<00:07:00.770> knee<00:07:00.980> and
