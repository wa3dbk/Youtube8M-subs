00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:36.320 
going to take a wooden spoon and I'm

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:37.570 
going to take a wooden spoon and I'm
going<00:02:36.440> to<00:02:36.500> start<00:02:36.680> whacking<00:02:36.890> it<00:02:37.190> now<00:02:37.310> this<00:02:37.460> is

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
going to start whacking it now this is

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:38.430 
going to start whacking it now this is
the<00:02:37.700> fun<00:02:37.880> part
