00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
this time around it was yeah um I think

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.779 
this time around it was yeah um I think
all<00:00:28.170> the<00:00:28.260> characters<00:00:28.650> and<00:00:28.680> this<00:00:28.949> so<00:00:29.099> we<00:00:29.609> see<00:00:29.760> a

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
all the characters and this so we see a

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.339 
all the characters and this so we see a
different<00:00:30.090> side<00:00:30.240> to<00:00:30.300> them<00:00:30.510> come<00:00:30.720> out<00:00:30.869> because

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
different side to them come out because

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:32.870 
different side to them come out because
of<00:00:31.590> the<00:00:31.679> new<00:00:31.800> environment<00:00:32.399> they're<00:00:32.550> in<00:00:32.579> and

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
of the new environment they're in and

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.420 
of the new environment they're in and
not<00:00:33.750> having<00:00:33.930> Hogwarts<00:00:34.469> I<00:00:34.590> think<00:00:34.829> plays<00:00:35.250> it

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
not having Hogwarts I think plays it

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.030 
not having Hogwarts I think plays it
plays<00:00:35.760> a<00:00:35.790> big<00:00:36.000> part<00:00:36.030> in<00:00:36.270> that<00:00:36.329> and<00:00:36.950> kind<00:00:37.950> of

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
plays a big part in that and kind of

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.790
