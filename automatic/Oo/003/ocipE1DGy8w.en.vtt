00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:15.269
 Hello, I'm Alberto, today I come 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:19.490
 talk about the model and crowe 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:22.759
 a pretty innovative and breakthrough model 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:26.369
 aggressive and that seems at first 

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:30.119
 integral or do not want to sell it as 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.620
 they however in my opinion is more 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.700
 all right 

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:37.380
 classic or open because because if you were 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:42.210
 remove the glasses 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:45.430
 and the part of the mask 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.290
 it's practically like a helmet 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:49.060
 open 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:52.810
 It's built in resins 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:55.740
 thermoplastic injected has two 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:55.740
 sizes of carlota 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:04.370
 the certificate this 22 05 has happened 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:06.820
 the security the viewfinder is old and 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:06.820
 anti scratch 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:15.869
 and it's pretty simple 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:18.690
 use glasses apart from the viewfinder for 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.890
 person who wear glasses 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:23.630
 it's good in my opinion 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.250
 it's something that 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.409
 that is quite innovative what I 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:30.649
 like 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:33.109
 It seems safe although in some forums 

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:34.939
 has questioned that the part of the 

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:38.700
 mask can fall to high 

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:41.789
 speeds although I do not think so 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.649
 and good as the brand does not want it 

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:48.630
 selling is something that differentiates us 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:50.100
 it's not something totally different and that 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:54.420
 It seems 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:56.180
 something positive that's all friends if 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.490
