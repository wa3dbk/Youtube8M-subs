00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
I'm nervous but also it is an honor in

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.020 
I'm nervous but also it is an honor in
that<00:00:42.180> you<00:00:42.360> know<00:00:43.280> carries<00:00:44.280> kind<00:00:44.640> of<00:00:44.700> handing

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
that you know carries kind of handing

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.270 
that you know carries kind of handing
over<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.300> mantle<00:00:45.690> and<00:00:45.989> I'm<00:00:46.710> sure<00:00:46.980> a<00:00:47.010> lot<00:00:47.250> of

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
over the mantle and I'm sure a lot of

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.529 
over the mantle and I'm sure a lot of
people<00:00:47.460> would<00:00:47.670> have<00:00:47.789> wanted<00:00:47.969> that<00:00:48.180> gig<00:00:48.420> and

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
people would have wanted that gig and

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.000 
people would have wanted that gig and
it's<00:00:48.660> sort<00:00:48.809> of<00:00:48.870> gig<00:00:49.020> you<00:00:49.110> can't<00:00:49.469> turn<00:00:49.829> it<00:00:49.980> down

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
it's sort of gig you can't turn it down

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.549 
it's sort of gig you can't turn it down
it's<00:00:50.760> very<00:00:51.030> hard<00:00:51.360> following<00:00:52.020> Terry<00:00:52.260> to<00:00:52.469> be

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
it's very hard following Terry to be

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.709 
it's very hard following Terry to be
nicer<00:00:53.039> if<00:00:53.760> someone<00:00:54.059> else<00:00:54.149> had<00:00:54.360> done<00:00:54.390> it<00:00:54.629> and

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
nicer if someone else had done it and

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.240 
nicer if someone else had done it and
failed<00:00:55.670> and<00:00:56.670> then<00:00:56.910> I<00:00:56.940> could<00:00:57.239> have<00:00:57.329> done<00:00:57.510> it<00:00:58.250> but

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
failed and then I could have done it but

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.290 
failed and then I could have done it but
I'm<00:00:59.399> afraid<00:00:59.579> someone<00:00:59.730> else<00:00:59.940> is<00:01:00.030> gonna<00:01:00.149> get

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
I'm afraid someone else is gonna get

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.729 
I'm afraid someone else is gonna get
that<00:01:00.480> privilege<00:01:00.690> they<00:01:01.140> can<00:01:01.320> take<00:01:01.500> it<00:01:01.620> over

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
that privilege they can take it over

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.889 
that privilege they can take it over
after<00:01:02.129> I've<00:01:02.250> failed<00:01:02.520> and<00:01:03.270> are<00:01:03.359> you<00:01:03.480> remotely

after I've failed and are you remotely

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.299 
after I've failed and are you remotely
bothered<00:01:04.320> by<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.500> fact<00:01:04.559> that<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:04.949> show<00:01:05.129> is<00:01:05.280> a

seem to get quite worked up by the

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.420 
seem to get quite worked up by the
voting<00:01:43.439> and<00:01:43.710> I<00:01:43.829> suppose<00:01:44.189> it<00:01:44.399> is<00:01:44.659> frustrating

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430 
voting and I suppose it is frustrating

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.039 
voting and I suppose it is frustrating
because<00:01:47.430> he's<00:01:47.790> seen<00:01:48.030> it<00:01:48.180> all<00:01:48.299> over<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.840> years

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
because he's seen it all over the years

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.109 
because he's seen it all over the years
you<00:01:49.290> know<00:01:49.320> we're<00:01:49.979> sat<00:01:50.159> on<00:01:50.250> our<00:01:50.310> bomb<00:01:50.729> chairs

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
you know we're sat on our bomb chairs

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.300 
you know we're sat on our bomb chairs
it's<00:01:51.659> harder<00:01:52.140> to<00:01:52.229> care<00:01:52.409> maybe<00:01:52.799> when<00:01:53.009> I<00:01:53.040> get<00:01:53.220> to

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
it's harder to care maybe when I get to

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.950 
it's harder to care maybe when I get to
Moscow<00:01:53.700> I'll<00:01:53.939> care<00:01:54.180> deeply<00:01:54.450> I'm<00:01:54.570> sure<00:01:54.750> we'll

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
Moscow I'll care deeply I'm sure we'll

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.749 
Moscow I'll care deeply I'm sure we'll
caddy<00:01:55.170> because<00:01:55.530> my<00:01:55.950> cell<00:01:56.159> you<00:01:56.189> know<00:01:56.369> Andrews

writing<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.119> song<00:01:57.299> this<00:01:57.509> year<00:01:57.719> and<00:01:57.899> we're

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
writing the song this year and we're

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.580 
writing the song this year and we're
finding<00:01:58.229> the<00:01:58.439> person<00:01:58.740> to<00:01:58.829> send<00:01:59.100> so<00:01:59.759> I<00:02:00.590> will

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
finding the person to send so I will

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.319 
finding the person to send so I will
have<00:02:01.710> a<00:02:01.770> bit<00:02:01.920> of<00:02:01.950> a<00:02:02.100> vested<00:02:02.490> interest<00:02:02.579> in<00:02:03.090> the

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
have a bit of a vested interest in the

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.679 
have a bit of a vested interest in the
in<00:02:03.960> the<00:02:04.290> UK<00:02:04.950> entry<00:02:05.430> and<00:02:05.640> I<00:02:05.850> think<00:02:06.149> we<00:02:06.270> might<00:02:06.479> do

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
in the UK entry and I think we might do

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.449 
in the UK entry and I think we might do
better<00:02:06.869> because<00:02:07.409> it's<00:02:07.619> good<00:02:07.890> to<00:02:08.039> have<00:02:08.129> a<00:02:08.190> big

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
better because it's good to have a big

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.430 
better because it's good to have a big
name<00:02:08.640> like<00:02:08.879> Andrew<00:02:09.270> attached<00:02:09.629> you<00:02:10.349> know

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
name like Andrew attached you know

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.839 
name like Andrew attached you know
because<00:02:10.619> that<00:02:10.950> was<00:02:11.039> one<00:02:11.160> of<00:02:11.190> things<00:02:11.370> Terry<00:02:11.610> was

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
because that was one of things Terry was

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:12.820 
because that was one of things Terry was
saying<00:02:11.879> that<00:02:12.270> if<00:02:12.420> we

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
saying that if we

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.130 
saying that if we
and<00:02:12.920> take<00:02:13.220> that<00:02:13.250> or<00:02:14.000> Elton<00:02:14.450> John<00:02:14.690> or<00:02:14.720> Roger

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
and take that or Elton John or Roger

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.560 
and take that or Elton John or Roger
somebody<00:02:15.680> we<00:02:16.130> would<00:02:16.340> do<00:02:16.640> better<00:02:16.820> so<00:02:17.420> I<00:02:17.450> think

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:17.570 
somebody we would do better so I think

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:20.260 
somebody we would do better so I think
having<00:02:17.840> a<00:02:18.020> you<00:02:18.590> know<00:02:18.620> really<00:02:19.430> well-known

and<00:03:05.780> read<00:03:06.200> a<00:03:06.230> bit<00:03:06.470> and<00:03:07.340> they<00:03:07.760> have<00:03:08.060> the<00:03:08.240> tough

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
job so in a way it kind of takes the

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.530 
job so in a way it kind of takes the
pressure<00:03:12.350> off<00:03:12.560> so<00:03:13.070> it's<00:03:13.280> easy<00:03:13.459> to<00:03:13.580> relax<00:03:14.000> do

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
pressure off so it's easy to relax do

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:15.730 
pressure off so it's easy to relax do
you<00:03:14.630> think<00:03:14.750> having<00:03:14.900> done<00:03:15.080> years<00:03:15.200> of<00:03:15.440> stand-up

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:15.740 
you think having done years of stand-up

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:17.259 
you think having done years of stand-up
helps<00:03:16.130> because<00:03:16.280> if<00:03:16.459> you're<00:03:16.610> autocue<00:03:17.060> goes

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:17.269 
helps because if you're autocue goes

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:18.910 
helps because if you're autocue goes
