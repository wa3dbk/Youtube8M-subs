00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 and maybe where the seprona in a week 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:08.380
 has put more than 50 complaints 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:10.210
 non-compliance with fishing regulations 

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:12.370
 here we are seeing part of the material 

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:14.580
 seized this weekend yes good 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:17.830
 here we have the reeds intervened 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:20.560
 all are for different infractions in 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:21.939
 fishing license fishing with album us 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.680
 We have also been banned 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:25.210
 intervened networks and good 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.540
 approximately what we have of year 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:31.000
 are about 50 and the operating rod which 

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:32.410
 did this weekend were 32 as 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.970
 agents come in one of these 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:36.220
 operative good right now we have 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:38.980
 located to two fishermen and has 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:41.350
 proceeded to document the have the 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:43.420
 license but they are breaking the law 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.040
 of fishing because they have more than two rods 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.920
 each in this case are nine streets 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.600
 one has five remaining four also 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:55.570
 have received several infractions one of 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:57.220
 camped and we have several circles in 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.840
 this case they had still retained 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.850
 in the reeds and they have been forced to 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:03.520
 release them and if they had them tied up in 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.170
 some stones for later apparently 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.909
 they wanted to take a picture and the rest is 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.340
 totally forbidden they have to 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:11.380
 capture it and in this case that's the photo 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.210
 and return it immediately to the water but 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.590
 you can not have anything tied 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.840
 we also see how this kind of 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.979
 camping generates a lot of waste in 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.320
 area 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:22.150
 on all the banks of the reservoir we have 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.430
 a problem with huge garbage 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:26.590
 infractions similar to those we have 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:29.530
 seen here are the ones that were reported 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:31.619
 this weekend 50 exactly apart 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:34.479
 also good last weekend 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:37.509
 we found several people who were 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:39.550
 setting fire that was the free 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:42.220
 even one that had a saw 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:44.020
 mechanical and cut the vegetation of the 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:46.360
 banks of the reservoir to set it on fire 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.700
 this type of operations are common 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.200
 in the reservoir of mequinenza if here it 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.060
 they perform services practically 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.800
 daily by colleagues from 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.530
 seprona and also citizen security 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:58.179
 here they are detected 80 percent of 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.369
 infractions that are committed throughout the 

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:02.050
 Province of Zaragoza The Reservoir of 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:03.850
 mequinenza is in the first place where more 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:05.979
 infractions are detected in second 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.899
 place would have the ribarroja and for 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:09.729
 last and the channel of the ebro river but 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:11.140
 let's hope that with these actions that 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.030
 people are being made 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.980
 conscientious more than when coming to 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:18.090
 carry out the fishing exercise what 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.920
 have to do then under the law 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.550
 and good, well, it 's nothing 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.550
 Nobody dies
