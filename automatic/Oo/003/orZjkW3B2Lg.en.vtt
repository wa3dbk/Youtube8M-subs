00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:13.299
 worth 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.850
 first in 2013 will be in another 

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:20.190
 murder 

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:21.660
 the case puma 230 from the sides 

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:27.180
 does not even pull that out from the outside 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:29.640
 bad so say about changing times 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.560
 look yes you can see here already 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.410
 a little less attention to details 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.809
 been 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:38.129
 but looking looks pretty good 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.890
 you can not see that are clean 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.600
 cleaned 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:47.879
 but you can say it all to the big one 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:50.250
 fits so not working well so then 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.750
 yes, the beacon does not work 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.610
 there will probably be some again 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.129
 mistakes in the loco are now that I am 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:01:00.030
 have tested thinking works 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:02.220
 Of course, even without problems it works 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.070
 but something in the trecker but 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:08.700
 the mature but that should nobody 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:13.049
 disturb well from the sound also produces hazard 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:17.610
 Well finished off is that me 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:19.740
 a bit too loud I would say but otherwise 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.869
 fits that every state sound the 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.430
 acceleration is a bit bad so 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.370
 rather quick and slow speed 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:30.110
 then he gives full throttle 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:34.220
 60 km h in the shortest time this is mine 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:36.220
 opinion too much but accelerate 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:40.040
 could you work a little bit more? 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:42.290
 try attach something it is extreme 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.020
 we are not difficult to drive at the beginning 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:51.530
 persist then very quickly 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:53.600
 that's not common for a trekker then 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.520
 let's see if you can do that too 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.620
 can drive nicely when charged 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.480
 I am a big hanger 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:02.030
 Taken to test what that looks like 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:05.570
 like on a red ladder nice to it 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:09.230
 the color as I said the acceleration 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:13.010
 is too good but otherwise it is pretty 

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:14.420
 well done that I turn there yes 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.950
 We have already seen the next error 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:23.210
 the light is not adjusted 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:24.740
 appears up here on the roof 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:27.620
 over that is not good 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:29.470
 we have no followers behind it 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.270
 be careful that this is the original one 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:34.670
 as the light does not work there 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:35.870
 the noise from that somewhere 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.170
 has been placed differently or something 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:44.470
 no idea where we drive once 50 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:48.640
 he does not even owe it 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:50.160
 The street along the view is also 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.720
 not nice 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:55.240
 you look way too high you almost see 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.980
 nothing forward for a while 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:59.220
 may not be a nice one 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.220
 outlook 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.860
 Yes 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.860
 he gives full throttle 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:18.650
 tilts as it provides for the hills without 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:20.630
 problems in itself is bad then 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:24.400
 here the lettering on a tire 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:27.170
 could have been adjusted a bit better 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.070
 but I do not want to detail anything here 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:29.990
 on titles 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:33.020
 but as I said that is with light 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:35.300
 bad I guess that here 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:38.300
 texture is missing or should that be white that 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:41.120
 Nobody knows a little conclusion too 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:43.070
 the motto as very good and design ago 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:45.280
 that is unfortunately not fit the 

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:47.960
 around people does not work 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.580
 and yes as I said the 

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:51.530
 acceleration does not fit that either 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:54.110
 you would also have to revise what else 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:57.680
 for the first mods had injured 13 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:59.810
 a good mod is yes as it will be the same 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.610
 another window come if he lock 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:04.850
 free or if it is worse lures errors 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:06.740
 jackets are not like the video 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:08.870
 forget to comment and subscribe 

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:10.550
 and if you want more like that 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:12.500
 Look at my youtube channel 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:14.960
 I will now be running which videos 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.519
 bring notions offered not in the form 

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:18.980
 to find 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:21.760
 Have fun watching and playing 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:21.760
 See you
