00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 something else youtube is welcome 

00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:05.100
 back to my channel to these others almost 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:09.420
 the last parts of this tutorial 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:11.460
 basic of cotter 250 f in this 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.469
 occasion we are going to update the 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.089
 flight controller before going what 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.539
 they programmed the first thing we have to do 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.890
 is to update your software and the first 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.869
 once we connect the controller to 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.080
 flight that I have here connected to the 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.550
 usb cable and we take it to the computer the 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.830
 computer does not recognize it 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.210
 immediately so when 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.109
 we connect as we can see in the 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.109
 down screen 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:39.970
 will appear by installing software from 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:39.970
 controller 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.510
 and he will not recognize it initially 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.320
 so first we connect it and 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:51.170
 We wait for the software to be installed 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:53.600
 since if not the application of this 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:56.710
 flight controller that fulfills that 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.710
 he will detect it 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.190
 we expected 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.430
 the discount that the software has 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.560
 installed there yes we can proceed to 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.460
 open the open pilot application to see 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.460
 who already recognized him 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.070
 normally it's going to be a critical warning not 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.100
 you can install the software of the 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:44.100
 device 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:53.170
 this is very common and it is the first time 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:55.870
 we connect our driver 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:59.260
 computer 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:02.020
 I get a notice that the front way does not 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:05.140
 is compatible and that I say there 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:07.480
 problems between them of doyle ok and what 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.790
 what we should do here is update the 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:12.310
 software then we go where the 

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:14.920
 tab define good work that I have 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:19.030
 here selected and what I'm going to do 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:21.100
 is to click 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.470
 then top left says 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:27.130
 adopt and that is what he is going to do is tell me 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:33.540
 to connect and disconnect 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:36.150
 the usb football controller x update 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:39.469
 then he tells me waiting for him to 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:43.560
 disconnect usb i disconnect a usb 

00:02:39.469 --> 00:02:45.880
 ready then tell me please connect the 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.480
 usb again 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.480
 and ready 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.310
 the firmware is being uploaded 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:57.040
 we wait for that to end 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:04.810
 says that I have to do manual 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:04.810
 today ok 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.250
 in this case what I have to do is 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.880
 if I'm not wrong 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.880
 a fresh 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:22.380
 let's try again to the bus 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.380
 30 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.030
 disconnected 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:32.140
 it's a connect again 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:45.200
 in this case there was no problem in 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:49.069
 this case has been completely updated 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:51.349
 I give the software ok and it shows me the 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:53.810
 latest version that I have already installed 

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:56.090
 having this configured we can already 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:58.760
 move on to what is the configuration of 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:01.069
 controller that we will see in the 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:03.290
 next video is basically done by 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:05.510
 the welcome option that we do to 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:07.280
 through the wissam that was all for this 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:09.170
 video do not forget to subscribe to the channel and 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.970
 Watch the following video in 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:13.459
 where we will configure everything that has 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:15.470
 what to do with the flight controller to 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:19.639
 in this way configure what is the 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:22.370
 radio control configure the engines and 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:25.660
 set up and be and look and perform 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:25.660
 everything is fine thanks
