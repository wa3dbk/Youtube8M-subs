this one I usually take it down to the
lowest<00:02:20.400> one<00:02:20.670> but<00:02:20.850> on<00:02:20.940> these<00:02:21.090> I<00:02:21.450> bring<00:02:21.840> it<00:02:21.930> up<00:02:21.990> to

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
lowest one but on these I bring it up to

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.680 
lowest one but on these I bring it up to
about<00:02:22.200> here<00:02:22.560> so<00:02:22.790> as<00:02:23.790> you<00:02:23.910> can<00:02:24.060> see<00:02:24.240> that's<00:02:24.420> how

about here so as you can see that's how

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.340 
about here so as you can see that's how
my<00:02:25.400> my<00:02:26.400> wire<00:02:26.610> fits<00:02:26.940> into<00:02:27.120> my<00:02:27.240> pliers<00:02:27.480> and<00:02:27.660> I

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
my my wire fits into my pliers and I

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.890 
my my wire fits into my pliers and I
just<00:02:28.590> push<00:02:28.770> it<00:02:28.920> around<00:02:29.010> like<00:02:29.850> so<00:02:30.180> until<00:02:30.750> it's

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
just push it around like so until it's

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.060 
just push it around like so until it's
touching<00:02:31.170> basically<00:02:32.000> let's<00:02:33.000> do<00:02:33.180> the<00:02:33.270> next<00:02:33.480> one

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.070

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:38.460 
looks like so put it in there

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.010 
looks like so put it in there
bring<00:02:38.910> it<00:02:39.030> around<00:02:39.060> till<00:02:39.390> it's<00:02:39.540> basically

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 
bring it around till it's basically

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:41.960

you find out or you can see when they're
good<00:04:17.730> and<00:04:17.760> then<00:04:18.120> and<00:04:18.419> they<00:04:19.080> lay<00:04:19.260> pretty<00:04:19.650> flat

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:20.630 
good and then and they lay pretty flat

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:23.090 
good and then and they lay pretty flat
now<00:04:21.630> what<00:04:21.810> I<00:04:21.840> do<00:04:21.960> they<00:04:22.380> take<00:04:22.590> my<00:04:22.710> little<00:04:22.860> wire

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:27.610 
usually I use a different thing but my

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:30.719 
usually I use a different thing but my
round<00:05:28.419> nose<00:05:28.479> are<00:05:28.750> here<00:05:28.930> together<00:05:29.080> or<00:05:29.729> here

00:05:30.719 --> 00:05:30.729 
round nose are here together or here

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:31.860 
round nose are here together or here
with<00:05:30.880> me<00:05:31.000> so<00:05:31.180> I'm<00:05:31.240> gonna<00:05:31.330> put<00:05:31.539> these<00:05:31.690> together

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:31.870 
with me so I'm gonna put these together

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:34.110 
with me so I'm gonna put these together
and<00:05:32.139> do<00:05:32.260> them<00:05:32.349> at<00:05:32.410> the<00:05:32.440> same<00:05:32.500> time<00:05:32.940> you<00:05:33.940> should

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:34.120 
and do them at the same time you should

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:34.740 
and do them at the same time you should
do<00:05:34.180> them<00:05:34.300> separately

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:34.750 
do them separately

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:37.830 
do them separately
probably<00:05:35.229> because<00:05:35.410> as<00:05:35.860> you<00:05:36.099> know<00:05:36.510> this<00:05:37.510> is<00:05:37.570> the

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:37.840 
probably because as you know this is the

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:39.779 
probably because as you know this is the
bigger<00:05:38.020> side<00:05:38.260> this<00:05:38.500> is<00:05:38.710> a<00:05:38.740> smaller<00:05:39.039> side<00:05:39.370> so<00:05:39.639> as

00:05:39.779 --> 00:05:39.789 
bigger side this is a smaller side so as

00:05:39.789 --> 00:05:41.279 
bigger side this is a smaller side so as
I'm<00:05:39.910> doing<00:05:40.060> side<00:05:40.360> by<00:05:40.479> side<00:05:40.660> one's<00:05:40.930> gonna<00:05:41.080> be

00:05:41.279 --> 00:05:41.289 
I'm doing side by side one's gonna be

00:05:41.289 --> 00:05:43.560 
I'm doing side by side one's gonna be
smaller<00:05:41.860> larger<00:05:42.340> than<00:05:42.490> the<00:05:42.610> other<00:05:42.729> but<00:05:42.970> I'm

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:43.570 
smaller larger than the other but I'm

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:45.150 
smaller larger than the other but I'm
just<00:05:43.720> doing<00:05:43.900> this<00:05:44.110> real<00:05:44.289> quick<00:05:44.440> so<00:05:44.710> I<00:05:44.740> can<00:05:44.860> show

hold them up next to each other and they

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:17.580 
hold them up next to each other and they
should<00:06:14.229> be<00:06:14.440> pretty<00:06:15.010> much<00:06:15.220> identical<00:06:16.410> and<00:06:17.410> if

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:19.530

00:06:24.099 --> 00:06:25.529

can see them a little easier

00:06:26.979 --> 00:06:28.830 
can see them a little easier
here's<00:06:27.789> if<00:06:27.970> we<00:06:28.090> hold<00:06:28.240> them<00:06:28.360> together<00:06:28.510> and

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:28.840 
here's if we hold them together and

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:33.629
