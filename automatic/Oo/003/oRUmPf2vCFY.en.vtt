00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:06.560
 this morning several days but we have a 

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:08.719
 luxury visit we have the guru 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:11.389
 international camilo cruz lecturer 

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:14.360
 very connoted that has two million 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:17.720
 copies of the book the cow sold in 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:19.490
 different languages the cow a manual that 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.740
 It is used in many universities in 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:26.150
 order a header manual to achieve the 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:28.779
 success and because the gown because then 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:30.949
 still the cow in this metaphor 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:32.840
 represents all the excuses and 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:34.250
 pretexts that let us succeed and in the 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.380
 history briefly the story of a 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.600
 family that was very poor poor poor 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:40.850
 but re poor but curiously despite 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.010
 of their poverty they owned a cow and 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.570
 because that cow gave them the milk and 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.070
 gave more than milk and it was that 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.990
 it seemed that at least not 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.880
 They were in abject poverty or whether 

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:52.190
 they were poor but they were not the poorest 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:54.320
 because they had their cow and one day someone 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.880
 he kills the cow and the first thing that you 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.590
 you think is that if you were fighting they were poor 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.510
 because without cows they will go to misery 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:01.520
 Total layer is passes everything 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:04.100
 contrary to not having your cow 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.570
 they start looking for other things to do 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.300
 to get ahead 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:11.030
 and they find not only more opportunities to 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:13.700
 around her but talents that they 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.200
 they even knew what they had and the moral 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.700
 the story is obviously that the cow 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.010
 that they thought was their position more 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.840
 valuable was really a chain that 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:23.020
 kept them tied to a life of the 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.520
 lifetime 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.650
 there are some phrases of his that we use 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.030
 a lot for entrepreneurship courses 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:31.759
 who have studied science 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.470
 business for example this here is 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:35.509
 speaks of the true enemy of success not 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:38.270
 it is failure as many think but 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:40.479
 conformism and mediocrity if it was 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.830
 that people limit themselves to us 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:45.229
 constantly and praiseworthy mind or 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:47.930
 many of us are never 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:50.030
 doing what we want we are not in 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.770
 the work we want many times not 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.720
 we are in the relationships we want 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.600
 there are many things that we ourselves 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.789
 We believe that we can not do not because 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.860
 we have evidence that we can not 

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:02.899
 do it but because we have gotten into 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.149
 the head that if there is possibility that 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:07.250
 let's fail it's better not to try it because 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:09.530
 then we're going to label failed 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.660
 they are going to make fun of us they are going to come 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.370
 and they will say again 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.380
 I told you I warned you not to 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:17.440
 you put in that then we have you 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:19.840
 so much to failure that we settle for 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.210
 mediocrity we settle for that 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.220
 worth the redundancy conformism of 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:25.870
 say good well the truth is I'm not so 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.390
 bad in me I do not even know why I complain 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:30.330
 because there are others who are worse and like 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.800
 that we feed on that conformism 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.660
 to sustain us but the truth is that 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.190
 nobody wants to live there sometimes for a 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.920
 decision making suddenly the 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:41.890
 people think more about the 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.950
 odds of failure that instead of 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.610
 the chances of success 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.140
 undoubtedly and that is one of the 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.720
 Look biggest mistakes that is a 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.730
 error that we curiously learn many 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.770
 times of the people closest to 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:56.350
 we are our own 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:59.380
 parents who often tell us 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:01.030
 things like you know that my son I do not know is not 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:03.160
 get into such big things because it's going to 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.530
 failing better starts with something 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:08.500
 small look for a small thing not 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.820
 try to cover the whole world and look 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.920
 we do not do it because no 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:14.170
 we want us not to want our 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.280
 our children succeed we do it 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.470
 because we believe that 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:21.100
 we are protecting those of us 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:23.530
 protecting those who find great 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:26.390
 challenges and do not know mothers usually say 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:29.460
 it's that I'm saving it 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:31.770
 imagine yourself as the most terrible thing of all 

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:33.120
 is that when trying to save you 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:35.340
 it's worth what we 're leaving the 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:38.220
 adherence to an impressive cow a 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:40.530
 excuse a pretext a justification that 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:42.180
 many times this young man will charge for 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.430
 his whole life what do we have to 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.530
 do not know to leave our area 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.540
 of comfort and face new 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:51.660
 challenges I think that the first thing we have 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:53.610
 what to understand is that and that is perhaps the 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:56.010
 most important step to succeed in 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:57.690
 any area is that we have 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:59.880
 than accept 100% of the 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:02.220
 responsibility for our success that 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:05.250
 Our success does not depend on our 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:07.440
 parents and in our teachers neither 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:10.050
 our partner neither from the government nor from the 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:12.870
 dressed neither our age nor neither of 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:14.880
 our chamele depends on us 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:18.239
 accept responsibility for our 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:20.010
 success that we understand that they are 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:22.560
 our dreams are at stake 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:24.540
 are our goals and then who else is going to 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.890
 be the work but we do 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:27.690
 we always think that the world is in 

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:29.990
 against us it is not true I am 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:31.950
 rebel because the world 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:33.930
 it is not the truth 

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:35.520
 brother undoubtedly and part of what 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:37.500
 I like to do in seminars and 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.940
 in conferences it is precisely 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.770
 helping people to find 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:43.680
 what are your dreams what are those 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:47.100
 goals that will help you overcome 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:48.900
 and a2 and get rid of all the cows of 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:52.410
 all the pretexts of all the excuses 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:54.570
 you housewife head of the family boss 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:57.060

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:09.810
 worth going to listen to Camillus 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:12.000
 connoted conference speaker had 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:13.290
 presented in this way because it is a 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.390
 person who has sold 2 million 

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:17.130
 copies of this book in different 

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:19.800
 languages in several countries even in 

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:22.380

 because among all we all want what 

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:34.620
 parents want the same success for 

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:36.900
 the children and often do not know 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:37.680
 exactly how to help them and how 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:39.479
