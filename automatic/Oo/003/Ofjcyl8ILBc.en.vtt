00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:33.620 
specs when you put the new flywheel on
that<00:01:31.799> is<00:01:31.950> a<00:01:32.130> crucial<00:01:32.579> component<00:01:32.939> if<00:01:33.450> they're

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
that is a crucial component if they're

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.899 
that is a crucial component if they're
not<00:01:33.780> torque<00:01:34.140> correctly<00:01:34.770> you<00:01:35.340> can<00:01:35.640> end<00:01:35.820> up

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
not torque correctly you can end up

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.940 
not torque correctly you can end up
brewing<00:01:36.329> in<00:01:36.509> everything<00:01:37.110> that<00:01:37.140> you<00:01:37.380> have<00:01:37.590> just

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
brewing in everything that you have just

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.870 
brewing in everything that you have just
done<00:01:38.310> today<00:01:40.130> the<00:01:41.130> next<00:01:41.340> video<00:01:41.549> that<00:01:41.729> we're

going to do is we're going to show you

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.499 
going to do is we're going to show you
how<00:01:43.200> to<00:01:43.229> replace<00:01:45.110> the<00:01:46.110> third<00:01:46.740> gear<00:01:47.509> shift

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
how to replace the third gear shift

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.300 
how to replace the third gear shift
selector<00:01:48.960> that's<00:01:49.200> actually<00:01:49.619> in<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:49.799> top<00:01:49.950> part

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
selector that's actually in the top part

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.760 
selector that's actually in the top part
of<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.610> transmission<00:01:51.560> because<00:01:52.560> there's

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
of the transmission because there's

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.410 
of the transmission because there's
there's<00:01:53.040> a<00:01:53.130> specific<00:01:53.700> way<00:01:53.820> that<00:01:53.850> you<00:01:54.090> have<00:01:54.270> to

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
there's a specific way that you have to

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.190 
there's a specific way that you have to
do<00:01:54.600> this<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:55.140> pins<00:01:55.439> only<00:01:55.860> come<00:01:56.100> out<00:01:56.219> one<00:01:56.579> way

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
do this the pins only come out one way

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.660 
do this the pins only come out one way
so<00:01:58.200> we'll<00:01:58.409> do<00:01:58.500> that<00:01:58.560> on<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:58.829> next<00:01:58.860> video<00:01:59.369> but

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
so we'll do that on the next video but

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.899 
so we'll do that on the next video but
just<00:02:00.329> so<00:02:00.509> um<00:02:00.750> just<00:02:01.350> so<00:02:01.469> you<00:02:01.619> know<00:02:01.920> I<00:02:02.219> mean<00:02:02.729> this

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
just so um just so you know I mean this
