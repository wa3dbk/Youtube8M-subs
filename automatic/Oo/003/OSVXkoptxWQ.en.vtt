it and how i use it so different people

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.200 
it and how i use it so different people
have<00:00:34.350> different<00:00:34.410> needs<00:00:35.280> for<00:00:35.550> different<00:00:36.060> kinds

have different needs for different kinds
of<00:00:36.420> amps<00:00:36.810> and<00:00:37.020> different<00:00:37.800> situations<00:00:38.460> if<00:00:39.330> i

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
of amps and different situations if i

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.510 
of amps and different situations if i
take<00:00:39.780> one<00:00:40.080> amp<00:00:40.320> somewhere<00:00:40.770> i<00:00:40.800> want<00:00:41.130> something

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
take one amp somewhere i want something

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.490 
take one amp somewhere i want something
that<00:00:42.030> gives<00:00:42.180> me<00:00:42.390> a<00:00:42.420> lot<00:00:42.660> of<00:00:42.720> different<00:00:43.140> colors

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
that gives me a lot of different colors

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.760 
that gives me a lot of different colors
as<00:00:44.370> opposed<00:00:44.730> to<00:00:44.900> one<00:00:45.900> sound<00:00:46.320> and<00:00:46.530> some

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
as opposed to one sound and some

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.560 
as opposed to one sound and some
particularly<00:00:47.250> older<00:00:47.520> amps<00:00:47.970> have<00:00:48.120> one<00:00:48.360> great

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
particularly older amps have one great

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.600 
particularly older amps have one great
sound<00:00:48.990> but<00:00:49.290> i<00:00:49.320> really<00:00:49.620> like<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:49.950> flexibility

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
sound but i really like the flexibility

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.940 
sound but i really like the flexibility
both<00:00:50.790> live<00:00:51.090> in<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.450> studio<00:00:51.690> and<00:00:52.080> this<00:00:52.710> amp

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:52.950 
both live in the studio and this amp

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:55.880 
both live in the studio and this amp
particularly<00:00:53.760> this<00:00:53.880> 50<00:00:54.600> watt<00:00:55.350> amp<00:00:55.560> of<00:00:55.710> theirs

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
particularly this 50 watt amp of theirs

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.820 
particularly this 50 watt amp of theirs
has<00:00:56.670> just<00:00:56.970> a<00:00:57.120> lot<00:00:57.480> of<00:00:57.510> different<00:00:57.690> places<00:00:58.560> you

00:00:58.820 --> 00:00:58.830 
has just a lot of different places you

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:01.040 
has just a lot of different places you
can<00:00:58.980> take<00:00:59.190> it<00:00:59.340> tonally<00:00:59.790> so<00:01:00.540> the<00:01:00.600> first<00:01:00.810> thing<00:01:00.900> I

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
can take it tonally so the first thing I

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.590 
can take it tonally so the first thing I
look<00:01:01.200> for<00:01:01.260> in<00:01:01.530> an<00:01:01.620> amp<00:01:01.800> is<00:01:02.790> the<00:01:03.000> clean<00:01:03.240> sound

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
look for in an amp is the clean sound

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.050 
look for in an amp is the clean sound
because<00:01:04.170> ultimately<00:01:04.439> I<00:01:04.920> have<00:01:05.280> petals<00:01:05.549> I<00:01:05.880> can

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
because ultimately I have petals I can

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.850 
because ultimately I have petals I can
get<00:01:06.210> other<00:01:06.330> sounds<00:01:06.810> but<00:01:06.960> that<00:01:07.110> clean<00:01:07.350> sound<00:01:07.680> is

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
get other sounds but that clean sound is

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.770 
get other sounds but that clean sound is
really<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.789> key<00:01:08.820> to<00:01:09.210> whether<00:01:09.390> I'm<00:01:09.539> going<00:01:09.719> to

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
really the key to whether I'm going to

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.020 
really the key to whether I'm going to
work<00:01:09.990> with<00:01:10.170> an<00:01:10.289> amp<00:01:10.469> or<00:01:10.619> not<00:01:10.770> and<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.820> first

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
work with an amp or not and the first

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.609 
work with an amp or not and the first
thing<00:01:12.149> I<00:01:12.329> look<00:01:12.450> for<00:01:12.509> in<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.869> clean<00:01:13.079> sound<00:01:13.439> is

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
thing I look for in the clean sound is

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.649 
thing I look for in the clean sound is
whether<00:01:13.829> the<00:01:14.009> high<00:01:14.250> end<00:01:14.640> high<00:01:15.119> notes<00:01:15.450> the

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
whether the high end high notes the

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.459 
whether the high end high notes the
treble<00:01:16.079> is<00:01:16.409> harsh<00:01:16.859> a<00:01:17.159> lot<00:01:17.640> of<00:01:17.670> amps<00:01:18.030> it<00:01:18.149> is<00:01:18.469> what

00:01:19.459 --> 00:01:19.469 
treble is harsh a lot of amps it is what

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:21.169 
treble is harsh a lot of amps it is what
I<00:01:19.499> found<00:01:19.770> in<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.039> Albion<00:01:20.549> is<00:01:20.670> that<00:01:20.789> the<00:01:20.880> clean

00:01:21.169 --> 00:01:21.179 
I found in the Albion is that the clean

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:23.179 
I found in the Albion is that the clean
sound<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.869> high<00:01:22.049> end<00:01:22.259> is<00:01:22.439> very<00:01:22.499> clear

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
sound the high end is very clear

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:28.520 
sound the high end is very clear
crystalyn<00:01:24.149> but<00:01:24.719> doesn't<00:01:25.229> hurt<00:01:25.380> your<00:01:25.499> ears

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:35.590 

you

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.120 

you

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.640 

you

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:41.650 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:44.050 

so<00:01:42.650> that's<00:01:42.829> the<00:01:42.920> first<00:01:43.100> thing<00:01:43.250> I<00:01:43.460> listen<00:01:43.790> to<00:01:43.939> on

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
so that's the first thing I listen to on

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.490 
so that's the first thing I listen to on
this<00:01:44.180> amp<00:01:44.450> is<00:01:44.600> that<00:01:44.750> I<00:01:44.780> can<00:01:44.990> get<00:01:45.200> high<00:01:45.799> notes<00:01:47.500> or

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
this amp is that I can get high notes or

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:54.130 
this amp is that I can get high notes or
even<00:01:48.770> a<00:01:48.860> rhythm<00:01:49.159> part<00:01:51.520> and<00:01:52.520> it's<00:01:53.210> not<00:01:53.390> piercing

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
even a rhythm part and it's not piercing

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.260 
even a rhythm part and it's not piercing
to<00:01:54.320> me<00:01:54.470> and<00:01:54.710> yet<00:01:55.159> I<00:01:55.189> can<00:01:55.430> hear<00:01:55.640> it's<00:01:55.759> very<00:01:55.880> clear

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
to me and yet I can hear it's very clear

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.210 
to me and yet I can hear it's very clear
i<00:01:56.299> can<00:01:56.509> hear<00:01:56.630> all<00:01:56.720> the<00:01:56.840> tone<00:01:57.049> so<00:01:57.799> that's<00:01:58.009> one

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:58.220 
i can hear all the tone so that's one

00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:59.710 
i can hear all the tone so that's one
thing<00:01:58.399> that<00:01:58.460> i<00:01:58.580> like<00:01:58.759> loud<00:01:59.060> i'll<00:01:59.210> show<00:01:59.420> you<00:01:59.479> in

thing that i like loud i'll show you in

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.600 
thing that i like loud i'll show you in
a<00:01:59.810> minute<00:02:00.049> all<00:02:00.350> the<00:02:00.470> different<00:02:00.830> variations<00:02:01.460> we

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
a minute all the different variations we

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:03.219 
a minute all the different variations we
can<00:02:01.759> get<00:02:01.909> this<00:02:02.060> is<00:02:02.210> pretty<00:02:02.420> much<00:02:02.509> the<00:02:02.750> straight

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
can get this is pretty much the straight

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:06.969 
can get this is pretty much the straight
tone<00:02:03.560> of<00:02:03.830> the<00:02:04.399> amp<00:02:05.049> some<00:02:06.049> amps<00:02:06.380> the<00:02:06.560> second

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979 
tone of the amp some amps the second

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:09.999 
tone of the amp some amps the second
channel<00:02:07.399> is<00:02:07.549> usable<00:02:08.509> some<00:02:08.720> it's<00:02:08.899> not<00:02:09.080> i'm<00:02:09.590> not

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
channel is usable some it's not i'm not

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:11.890 
channel is usable some it's not i'm not
a<00:02:10.039> heavy<00:02:10.310> metal<00:02:10.550> type<00:02:10.880> of<00:02:11.030> player<00:02:11.239> so<00:02:11.569> I<00:02:11.599> don't

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
a heavy metal type of player so I don't

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.710 
a heavy metal type of player so I don't
need<00:02:12.050> full<00:02:12.459> Marcia<00:02:13.459> Lee<00:02:13.670> saturation<00:02:14.480> although

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
need full Marcia Lee saturation although

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:15.940 
need full Marcia Lee saturation although
it's<00:02:14.840> nice<00:02:14.989> to<00:02:15.140> go<00:02:15.230> to<00:02:15.290> have<00:02:15.500> it<00:02:15.650> if<00:02:15.739> you're<00:02:15.860> in

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
it's nice to go to have it if you're in

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.400 
it's nice to go to have it if you're in
the<00:02:16.010> studio<00:02:16.239> so<00:02:17.239> I<00:02:17.569> checked<00:02:17.930> the<00:02:18.019> second

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
the studio so I checked the second

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.030 
the studio so I checked the second
channel<00:02:18.769> and<00:02:18.920> see<00:02:19.069> if<00:02:19.190> I<00:02:19.280> can<00:02:19.430> get<00:02:19.519> a<00:02:19.580> nice<00:02:19.790> warm

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
channel and see if I can get a nice warm

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:40.290 
channel and see if I can get a nice warm
overdrive<00:02:22.040> sound

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.360 

so<00:02:41.300> that's<00:02:41.480> a<00:02:41.570> real<00:02:41.780> punchy<00:02:42.230> sound<00:02:42.500> it's<00:02:43.160> got<00:02:43.340> a

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
so that's a real punchy sound it's got a

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.000 
so that's a real punchy sound it's got a
lot<00:02:43.580> of<00:02:43.630> bottom<00:02:44.630> but<00:02:44.660> again<00:02:45.140> just<00:02:45.410> like<00:02:45.860> you

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
lot of bottom but again just like you

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.160 
lot of bottom but again just like you
don't<00:02:46.130> want<00:02:46.250> the<00:02:46.340> top<00:02:46.550> to<00:02:46.610> be<00:02:46.970> too<00:02:47.180> harsh<00:02:47.510> if

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
don't want the top to be too harsh if

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:50.410 
don't want the top to be too harsh if
that<00:02:48.440> bottom<00:02:48.860> is<00:02:49.010> too<00:02:49.190> muddy<00:02:49.490> it<00:02:50.000> also<00:02:50.180> doesn't

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
that bottom is too muddy it also doesn't

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.070 
that bottom is too muddy it also doesn't
work<00:02:50.750> so<00:02:50.990> I<00:02:51.020> like<00:02:51.290> that<00:02:51.530> I<00:02:51.590> can<00:02:51.680> dial<00:02:52.130> in<00:02:52.430> a<00:02:52.460> nice

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.080 
work so I like that I can dial in a nice

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.020 
work so I like that I can dial in a nice
distortion<00:02:54.080> sound<00:02:54.320> that<00:02:55.130> does<00:02:55.310> not<00:02:55.460> overwhelm

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
distortion sound that does not overwhelm

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:02.380 
distortion sound that does not overwhelm
the<00:02:56.690> bottom<00:02:57.050> of<00:02:57.200> the<00:02:57.320> band<00:02:57.560> or<00:02:57.800> the<00:02:57.830> track<00:03:01.390> now

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
the bottom of the band or the track now

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:04.090 
the bottom of the band or the track now
this<00:03:02.540> am<00:03:02.780> particularly<00:03:03.230> has<00:03:03.440> a<00:03:03.470> third<00:03:03.830> feature

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 
this am particularly has a third feature

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.010 
this am particularly has a third feature
which<00:03:04.490> I've<00:03:04.670> never<00:03:04.700> seen<00:03:04.970> on<00:03:05.330> an<00:03:05.450> amp<00:03:05.600> and<00:03:05.870> I

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:06.020 
which I've never seen on an amp and I

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:08.350 
which I've never seen on an amp and I
end<00:03:06.650> up<00:03:06.830> using<00:03:07.040> it<00:03:07.220> quite<00:03:07.460> a<00:03:07.520> bit<00:03:07.610> so<00:03:08.150> it<00:03:08.240> has

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.360 
end up using it quite a bit so it has

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.330 
end up using it quite a bit so it has
our<00:03:08.540> a<00:03:08.570> channel<00:03:09.140> on<00:03:09.170> our<00:03:09.350> be<00:03:09.500> channel<00:03:09.980> the<00:03:10.310> a

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
our a channel on our be channel the a

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.400 
our a channel on our be channel the a
channel<00:03:10.940> which<00:03:11.060> is<00:03:11.090> clean<00:03:11.480> and<00:03:11.720> the<00:03:11.780> B<00:03:11.960> channel

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410 
channel which is clean and the B channel

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:14.470 
channel which is clean and the B channel
which<00:03:12.530> is<00:03:12.680> an<00:03:12.770> overdrive<00:03:13.250> and<00:03:13.550> that<00:03:14.060> overdrive

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
which is an overdrive and that overdrive

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.810 
which is an overdrive and that overdrive
channel<00:03:14.900> goes<00:03:15.110> from<00:03:15.320> full-on<00:03:15.820> metal

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:16.820 
channel goes from full-on metal

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:19.240 
channel goes from full-on metal
distortion<00:03:17.030> to<00:03:17.690> just<00:03:18.230> slightly<00:03:18.620> over<00:03:18.740> driven

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
distortion to just slightly over driven

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:20.320 
distortion to just slightly over driven
so<00:03:19.400> I'm<00:03:19.490> going<00:03:19.610> to<00:03:19.640> put<00:03:19.790> it<00:03:19.910> somewhere<00:03:20.150> in

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:20.330 
so I'm going to put it somewhere in

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:22.449 
so I'm going to put it somewhere in
between<00:03:20.420> for<00:03:20.930> me<00:03:20.959> but<00:03:21.770> often<00:03:22.130> I<00:03:22.220> want

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:22.459 
between for me but often I want

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:23.710 
between for me but often I want
something<00:03:22.700> that's<00:03:22.880> somewhere<00:03:23.180> between<00:03:23.360> the

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 
something that's somewhere between the

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:25.270 
something that's somewhere between the
two<00:03:23.870> I<00:03:23.900> want<00:03:24.260> to<00:03:24.350> clean<00:03:24.560> sound<00:03:24.920> and<00:03:25.130> then<00:03:25.190> I

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
two I want to clean sound and then I

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:26.440 
two I want to clean sound and then I
want<00:03:25.400> to<00:03:25.520> just<00:03:25.610> be<00:03:25.730> able<00:03:25.820> to<00:03:25.910> kick<00:03:26.090> it<00:03:26.209> up<00:03:26.300> a

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.450 
want to just be able to kick it up a

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:28.390 
want to just be able to kick it up a
little<00:03:26.600> bit<00:03:26.840> and<00:03:27.410> this<00:03:27.530> amp<00:03:27.860> offers<00:03:28.220> something

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
little bit and this amp offers something

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.430 
little bit and this amp offers something
called<00:03:28.640> mixed<00:03:28.940> channel<00:03:29.480> and<00:03:29.630> that's<00:03:30.290> a

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
called mixed channel and that's a

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:31.840 
called mixed channel and that's a
channel<00:03:30.830> that's<00:03:30.860> basically<00:03:31.400> the<00:03:31.520> clean

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:31.850 
channel that's basically the clean

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:33.610 
channel that's basically the clean
channel<00:03:31.880> and<00:03:32.330> you<00:03:32.390> dial<00:03:32.750> in<00:03:33.020> as<00:03:33.170> much<00:03:33.350> of<00:03:33.530> the

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620 
channel and you dial in as much of the

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:35.350 
channel and you dial in as much of the
overdrive<00:03:34.100> as<00:03:34.370> you<00:03:34.490> want<00:03:34.700> it's<00:03:35.060> a<00:03:35.209> great

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:35.360 
overdrive as you want it's a great

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.720 
overdrive as you want it's a great
feature<00:03:35.780> I<00:03:36.140> was<00:03:36.770> playing<00:03:37.100> on<00:03:37.190> a<00:03:37.220> recession<00:03:37.640> the

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
feature I was playing on a recession the

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:40.990 
feature I was playing on a recession the
other<00:03:37.910> day<00:03:38.090> and<00:03:38.300> I<00:03:38.360> used<00:03:38.600> it<00:03:38.780> the<00:03:39.230> part<00:03:40.000> went

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 
other day and I used it the part went

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.110 
other day and I used it the part went
from<00:03:41.180> serve<00:03:41.450> the<00:03:41.570> same<00:03:41.810> part<00:03:42.230> in<00:03:42.470> the<00:03:43.160> verse<00:03:43.400> to

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
from serve the same part in the verse to

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.060 
from serve the same part in the verse to
the<00:03:44.150> choruses<00:03:44.870> so<00:03:45.170> what<00:03:45.290> I<00:03:45.320> wanted<00:03:45.680> to<00:03:45.739> do<00:03:45.950> is

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:46.070 
the choruses so what I wanted to do is

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:47.229 
the choruses so what I wanted to do is
just<00:03:46.100> kick<00:03:46.430> it<00:03:46.459> up<00:03:46.670> a<00:03:46.790> little<00:03:46.940> bit<00:03:47.150> and

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:47.239 
just kick it up a little bit and

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:48.550 
just kick it up a little bit and
saturate<00:03:47.810> it<00:03:47.959> I<00:03:48.019> through<00:03:48.230> something<00:03:48.530> like

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
saturate it I through something like

00:03:48.560 --> 00:04:11.220 
saturate it I through something like
this

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.230 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:14.710 

so<00:04:12.230> that's<00:04:12.409> really<00:04:12.739> nice<00:04:13.159> to<00:04:13.670> be<00:04:13.700> able<00:04:13.819> to<00:04:14.090> for

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:14.720 
so that's really nice to be able to for

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.420 
so that's really nice to be able to for
a<00:04:14.750> chorus<00:04:15.230> or<00:04:15.500> just<00:04:15.709> to<00:04:15.799> get<00:04:15.920> a<00:04:15.950> little<00:04:16.040> change

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.430 
a chorus or just to get a little change

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:17.740 
a chorus or just to get a little change
of<00:04:16.609> sound<00:04:16.850> without<00:04:17.000> going<00:04:17.359> full-on

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 
of sound without going full-on

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:19.629 
of sound without going full-on
distortion<00:04:18.470> so<00:04:18.979> that's<00:04:19.130> another<00:04:19.370> feature

00:04:19.629 --> 00:04:19.639 
distortion so that's another feature

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:22.960 
distortion so that's another feature
again<00:04:20.540> that's<00:04:20.930> on<00:04:21.049> the<00:04:21.169> 1500<00:04:21.949> watt<00:04:22.100> that<00:04:22.400> that

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:22.970 
again that's on the 1500 watt that that

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:24.610 
again that's on the 1500 watt that that
I<00:04:23.000> really<00:04:23.389> dig<00:04:23.600> and<00:04:23.750> I<00:04:23.780> haven't<00:04:24.110> seen<00:04:24.260> it's<00:04:24.470> on

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:24.620 
I really dig and I haven't seen it's on

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:28.060 
I really dig and I haven't seen it's on
none<00:04:24.800> of<00:04:24.889> my<00:04:24.979> other<00:04:25.010> amps<00:04:25.550> now<00:04:26.560> so<00:04:27.560> I<00:04:27.590> have<00:04:27.919> this

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.070 
none of my other amps now so I have this

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:31.870 
none of my other amps now so I have this
set<00:04:28.460> pretty<00:04:29.210> much<00:04:29.770> straight<00:04:30.770> up<00:04:30.979> but<00:04:31.699> there's

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:31.880 
set pretty much straight up but there's

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:34.810 
set pretty much straight up but there's
a<00:04:31.940> lot<00:04:32.120> of<00:04:32.150> little<00:04:33.310> tweaking<00:04:34.310> you<00:04:34.400> can<00:04:34.550> do<00:04:34.669> on

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:34.820 
a lot of little tweaking you can do on

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:36.730 
a lot of little tweaking you can do on

to show you some of that that's offered
on<00:04:45.740> these<00:04:45.889> amps<00:04:46.479> so<00:04:47.479> let<00:04:47.630> me<00:04:47.690> show<00:04:47.840> you<00:04:47.870> some<00:04:48.139> of

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:48.169 
on these amps so let me show you some of

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:50.590 
on these amps so let me show you some of
the<00:04:48.320> things<00:04:48.470> the<00:04:48.650> amp<00:04:48.830> does<00:04:49.180> as<00:04:50.180> I<00:04:50.389> said<00:04:50.570> before

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:50.600 
the things the amp does as I said before

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.200 
the things the amp does as I said before
there<00:04:51.110> are<00:04:51.139> a<00:04:51.199> lot<00:04:51.380> of<00:04:51.410> little<00:04:52.210> colorations

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:53.210 
there are a lot of little colorations

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:55.360 
there are a lot of little colorations
and<00:04:53.570> variations<00:04:54.199> that<00:04:54.350> you<00:04:54.530> can<00:04:54.830> use<00:04:55.010> on<00:04:55.220> this

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:55.370 
and variations that you can use on this

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:58.230 
and variations that you can use on this
amp<00:04:55.720> so<00:04:56.720> we'll<00:04:56.900> go<00:04:57.020> from<00:04:57.199> left<00:04:57.440> to<00:04:57.560> right

00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:58.240 
amp so we'll go from left to right

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.430 
amp so we'll go from left to right
obviously<00:04:59.240> we<00:04:59.300> have<00:04:59.389> our<00:04:59.510> power<00:04:59.690> switch<00:05:00.139> and

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:00.440 
obviously we have our power switch and

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.980 
obviously we have our power switch and
our<00:05:00.590> stand<00:05:00.919> by<00:05:01.210> then<00:05:02.210> we<00:05:02.330> have<00:05:02.419> a<00:05:02.449> nice<00:05:02.690> feature

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:02.990 
our stand by then we have a nice feature

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:04.300 
our stand by then we have a nice feature
here<00:05:03.350> which<00:05:03.500> is<00:05:03.620> one<00:05:03.710> hundred<00:05:03.800> percent<00:05:03.979> in

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:04.310 
here which is one hundred percent in

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:06.040 
here which is one hundred percent in
thirty<00:05:04.550> three<00:05:04.820> percent<00:05:04.850> of<00:05:05.330> the<00:05:05.419> output<00:05:05.930> of

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:06.050 
thirty three percent of the output of

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:07.960 
thirty three percent of the output of
the<00:05:06.380> amp<00:05:06.560> so<00:05:06.860> if<00:05:06.949> you're<00:05:07.100> in<00:05:07.190> a<00:05:07.250> situation<00:05:07.460> a

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:07.970 
the amp so if you're in a situation a

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:11.350 
the amp so if you're in a situation a
small<00:05:08.330> club<00:05:08.720> or<00:05:09.380> an<00:05:09.650> amp<00:05:09.860> or<00:05:10.520> a<00:05:10.550> microphone

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:11.360 
small club or an amp or a microphone

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:13.060 
small club or an amp or a microphone
that<00:05:11.600> might<00:05:11.780> be<00:05:11.900> over<00:05:12.169> driving<00:05:12.440> in<00:05:12.680> a<00:05:12.740> studio

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:13.070 
that might be over driving in a studio

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:15.159 
that might be over driving in a studio
you<00:05:13.669> can<00:05:13.789> kick<00:05:13.970> this<00:05:14.090> down<00:05:14.360> to<00:05:14.690> thirty<00:05:14.930> three

00:05:15.159 --> 00:05:15.169 
you can kick this down to thirty three

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:16.690 
you can kick this down to thirty three
percent<00:05:15.200> of<00:05:15.710> the<00:05:15.830> output<00:05:16.190> which<00:05:16.340> is<00:05:16.460> a<00:05:16.490> really

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:16.700 
percent of the output which is a really

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:18.339 
percent of the output which is a really
nice<00:05:16.910> feature<00:05:16.970> to<00:05:17.300> have<00:05:17.389> again<00:05:17.900> it's<00:05:18.229> like

00:05:18.339 --> 00:05:18.349 
nice feature to have again it's like

00:05:18.349 --> 00:05:19.990 
nice feature to have again it's like
having<00:05:18.620> a<00:05:18.650> small<00:05:18.950> lamp<00:05:19.190> and<00:05:19.340> a<00:05:19.400> big<00:05:19.580> ramp<00:05:19.849> and

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:20.000 
having a small lamp and a big ramp and

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.680 
having a small lamp and a big ramp and
one<00:05:20.210> then<00:05:21.200> there's<00:05:21.380> a<00:05:21.440> phase<00:05:21.770> switch<00:05:22.190> and

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:22.690 
one then there's a phase switch and

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:25.570 
one then there's a phase switch and
there's<00:05:23.690> really<00:05:23.930> two<00:05:24.229> ways<00:05:24.470> that<00:05:25.099> this<00:05:25.400> could

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:25.580 
there's really two ways that this could

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:26.920 
there's really two ways that this could
come<00:05:25.760> in<00:05:25.789> real<00:05:26.060> handy<00:05:26.090> one<00:05:26.570> is<00:05:26.690> if<00:05:26.810> you're

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:26.930 
come in real handy one is if you're

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:29.350 
come in real handy one is if you're
using<00:05:27.050> two<00:05:27.320> cabinets<00:05:27.889> and<00:05:28.130> you<00:05:28.849> can<00:05:29.000> play<00:05:29.210> with

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:29.360 
using two cabinets and you can play with

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.029 
using two cabinets and you can play with
that<00:05:29.539> and<00:05:29.750> see<00:05:29.900> which<00:05:30.139> one<00:05:30.410> sounds<00:05:30.440> best

00:05:31.029 --> 00:05:31.039 
that and see which one sounds best

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:33.040 
that and see which one sounds best
because<00:05:31.280> they<00:05:31.400> can<00:05:31.760> cancel<00:05:32.720> each<00:05:32.780> other<00:05:32.900> out

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:33.050 
because they can cancel each other out

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:35.290 
because they can cancel each other out
or<00:05:33.410> have<00:05:33.530> some<00:05:33.710> phase<00:05:33.919> issues<00:05:34.340> and<00:05:34.820> even<00:05:35.120> just

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:35.300 
or have some phase issues and even just

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:37.870 
or have some phase issues and even just
room<00:05:35.510> to<00:05:35.720> room
