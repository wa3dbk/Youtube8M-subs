00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.220
 hello in this video I'm going to talk about 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:07.220
 most controversial character in Mauritius 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:23.330
 nicodemo was the correct character created 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.700
 by Maurizio de Sousa on January 4, 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:29.240
 1966 in china afternoon newspaper 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.240
 Paulo 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.970
 strips that he was a naughty boy with 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.949
 sarcastic humor seemed sorry for the 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:46.440
 the term in person 

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:49.050
 so it had this name of Nicodemus 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:54.210
 demon including her hair in shape 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:55.710
 already made this very clear in the 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.870
 true as you can see from the 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.000
 he tried to help people with 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.829
 as in that it gives you a scream that the 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.800
 face that is sleeping the vision of the abyss 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.420
 but the poor guy fall so there is 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.640
 that doubt of the reader if he had 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.740
 even obtaining or if he really 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.210
 wanted to deal with others 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.890
 it was a very common thing in the strips 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.619
 stories made by maurice make the 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.810
 reader using the imagination interpreting 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.940
 As you wish and with nicodemes, it was not 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.860
 different but he had fired and 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.750
 selfish ego that will benefit 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.670
 with the suffering of others 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.929
 he was also innocent not 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.690
 making it clear that he was being 

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:32.850
 You really or pretending to be just to 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:35.640
 get on well and rarely did he get sick 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.619
 only the others his strips were always 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.539
 which made it very interesting to 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.670
 make grace with actions and allows 

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:42.599
 readers understand the joke only through 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.849
 of desire 

00:01:42.599 --> 00:01:46.590
 the ones also had a serrated effect 

00:01:44.849 --> 00:01:48.929
 half shaken as if he did not have the art 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.179
 was differentiated in the 

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:53.190
 of the gang as he was mean 

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:55.140
 tiradentes and different, huh? 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:57.000
 because of these antics all 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.890
 nicodemos was the first case that the 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.750
 Mauritius has been censored 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.030
 although in the 1960s he has more 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.920
 freedom in their creations as they do not 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.660
 I was politically correct. 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.970
 there were still people I did not like 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:10.440
 implied with the boy's lectures 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.270
 the newspaper afternoon and asked for 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.310
 Mauritius to correct situations of correct 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.989
 character on the nose and not 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.849
 accepted and started to take the children to 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:19.950
 the afternoon newspaper 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:21.989
 only that it still continued to receive 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.550
 criticism and receiving letters so that he 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:25.680
 change the character 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.680
 faced with so many complaints not to 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.170
 take out and 6 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.209
 we can change it completely maurice 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.579
 simply stopped producing dressing 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:35.500
 the character as the maurice himself 

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:36.939
 said Nicodemus was a character to the 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.030
 ahead of your time 

00:02:36.939 --> 00:02:42.189
 because today we have many drawings 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:44.500
 far worse than what we can do 

00:02:42.189 --> 00:02:46.709
 he still appeared in the 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.639
 cica both on tv and comic books 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:49.900
 with the monica 

00:02:48.639 --> 00:02:54.099
 most of the time just like 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:57.209
 Mayor of the city arrived by 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:57.209
 last to the bank 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:08.200
 ask for roasted cashew nuts 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.200
 the cabinet to 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:46.000
 everything is very much the advertisements about 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:47.770
 vehicle at that time were comics 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.690
 like a car's history and 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:51.430
 when in comics for example 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:53.320
 I think it only fills up even though it does not 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.600
 There was a lot of character from that time 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:57.790
 after these advertisements and feel the new 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:00.400
 disappeared without reference even in 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:02.110
 nowhere and remained so until 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.420
 in 2003 a book was released by 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:06.580
 editor globe called the best strips 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.720
 of nicodemus that is not easy to find 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:09.459
 nowadays 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:11.019
 after that book he was again 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:13.989
 remembered and appear and participations 

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:16.060
 special and two occasions but as a way 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:18.130
 of homage and gives meaning to 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:20.739
 the first was in history or repent 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:23.470
 a parody TV show The Apprentice in 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:25.180
 record where it appears the final frame 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:27.910
 along with other forgotten characters 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:30.100
 of the 60s to give grace in history 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:32.230
 after that I will have small apparitions 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:33.820
 more in special conditions like 

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:36.100
 little face of comics 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:38.830
 along with various items were stuck 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:40.540
 on the island of the book mauricio de sousa 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:42.280
 comic strip only for 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:44.560
 participate with the festival group 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:47.020
 of Mauricio also appeared in this 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:49.930
 50 in a retelling by denilson to the 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:52.810
 year in 2010 a pocket of 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:54.400
 nymphaeus comic strips called 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:56.919
 in franca was the same style of the 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:59.470
 this podium was composed of 240 

00:04:56.919 --> 00:05:01.750
 comic strips as well as in the 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:02.560
 from 2009 he comes back with stories 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:04.450
 unpublished 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:06.250
 from there and several of them went on to 

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:08.140
 story of one of the pages and seedlings 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:10.090
 also as she was born in the 60's 

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:11.860
 but your personality is a bit 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:14.529
 changed because of the politically 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:16.839
 correct and even used confidentiality 

00:05:14.529 --> 00:05:18.279
 help others only way your pie 

00:05:16.839 --> 00:05:19.329
 in a softer way than 

00:05:18.279 --> 00:05:22.209
 in the old days 

00:05:19.329 --> 00:05:24.069
 sometimes he had a profession in addition to 

00:05:22.209 --> 00:05:25.359
 in front of the old daughters he 

00:05:24.069 --> 00:05:26.949
 started to feel bad in his attempts 

00:05:25.359 --> 00:05:29.049
 to help others 

00:05:26.949 --> 00:05:31.149
 as a form of punishment teach that help 

00:05:29.049 --> 00:05:33.609
 so crooked is wrong he can not 

00:05:31.149 --> 00:05:36.009
 in this period and even appeared in the 

00:05:33.609 --> 00:05:37.839
 cover and in the opening story of Monica 

00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:40.539
 50 in 2011 

00:05:37.839 --> 00:05:43.119
 in classic 34 movie tapes wine 

00:05:40.539 --> 00:05:45.399
 Cob of 2012 he played with the class 

00:05:43.119 --> 00:05:47.379
 of Monica as a villain called 

00:05:45.399 --> 00:05:50.379
 ass and on this occasion speaking one more 

00:05:47.379 --> 00:05:53.049
 was a forgotten character where 

00:05:50.379 --> 00:05:54.819
 he says that staying so long in the book 

00:05:53.049 --> 00:05:57.899
 in the comics I founded the League of Shadows 

00:05:54.819 --> 00:05:59.769
 and gradients turning your leader of praise 

00:05:57.899 --> 00:06:01.899
 continued with new stories with 

00:05:59.769 --> 00:06:03.639
 Nicodemus by 2012 

00:06:01.899 --> 00:06:05.889
 one of his last stories of this new 

00:06:03.639 --> 00:06:07.779
 it was monica phase 72 

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:10.419
 most recently of participation and 

00:06:07.779 --> 00:06:13.239
 chives 500 and monica 87 had a 

00:06:10.419 --> 00:06:14.619
 solo story of 3 comics today has 

00:06:13.239 --> 00:06:16.449
 less stories with him because today 

00:06:14.619 --> 00:06:18.069
 are increasingly a footprint 

00:06:16.449 --> 00:06:20.289
 politically correct 

00:06:18.069 --> 00:06:21.879
 so even with milder attitudes not 

00:06:20.289 --> 00:06:24.159
 it can be said that it continues in the 

00:06:21.879 --> 00:06:26.259
 comic in any way nicodemus is 

00:06:24.159 --> 00:06:27.999
 a classic of the archives of Mauritius and 

00:06:26.259 --> 00:06:31.889
 probably more adults should 

00:06:27.999 --> 00:06:34.119
 remember him and miss him or not right? 

00:06:31.889 --> 00:06:36.069
 I hope you enjoyed the video if 

00:06:34.119 --> 00:06:39.959
