00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.670
 yes hello welcome to the game analysis 

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:07.670
 number 1 sentence 1 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.480
 table tennis events 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:27.439
 the counter we have an opponent here 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:29.450
 I also know who can relax 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:31.430
 but I believe him before me 

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:33.530
 a few years ago against him 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:35.750
 I just know only knew that he played 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:39.800
 with the note actually over the whole 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:49.070
 table blog yes look what was yours 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:50.750
 Seeing as well gets through as you do 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:53.300
 I know I'm very down-oriented 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:56.420
 girocard prefers to play the game 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.230
 Bombing everywhere is not always 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.090
 meaningful 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:04.789
 We will also do that during the game 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:07.580
 note 2 0-leadership is already blowing 

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:08.869
 again such a pleasant and blog me 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:12.380
 have to say I had the whole game 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:15.110
 a lot of problems with this trajectory 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:18.220
 because the band already plays clearly 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:20.539
 unlike with a normal covering 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.490
 so it was a very interesting one 

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:25.520
 In retrospect , I also play the part 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:29.210
 has brought a game but to do so 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:32.210
 later times more then this is my 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:36.890
 Ever read the whole thing with us 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:38.960
 I wanted to serve 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.770
 made well if my backhand 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.950
 get 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:46.400
 that does not mean fast serves 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:48.979
 over cut or teach but over 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:52.100
 know pages pad under it 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:54.130
 goes or even and and longer 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.899
 I can open with spin 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:02:00.049
 I have to honestly say that I am 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:04.460
 I did not feel good about it now 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:06.740
 but requires you have to say when 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:09.500
 I played the backhand clearly 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:12.410
 too firm and with too little rotation so 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.690
 many belgien out the back you can see that 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.489
 even to the whole course of the game 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.110
 it also scares me personally 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:20.930
 I'm not annoyed because I just do not 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.240
 have checked and the safe ball 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.520
 played 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.200
 I realize what you are all about 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:28.450
 switch to the first ball actually 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.690
 completely off because it just is not 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:34.950
 I'm used to that the EU can come back 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.950
 Here I had to pull first two times 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:42.930
 six both now always balancing new 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.450
 upstroke position 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:48.520
 that was a good move with eric 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.080
 can be opened a bit dosed and with 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:52.360
 the forehand also followed 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:55.770
 that does not shut off the again 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:58.630
 other positions also empties 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:06.160
 tightened with rotation and important on 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:09.010
 the table 8 6-leadership now I will be off 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:11.320
 and then overhasty too hasty 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:14.320
 I just have to learn to do that 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:15.030
 control and can pick and 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.230
 again 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:19.570
 I did not move well for that 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:24.510
 second ball and then always wants to 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:27.280
 a lot with my serve now 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:29.410
 there again, I would like you can 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.510
 just always go through the min that needs 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:33.940
 I absolutely have to get used to that 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:36.250
 play the first time on the table 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:38.200
 that too is a very clear thing 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:41.050
 I can recommend playing the first time 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:43.870
 on it with much rotation he with one 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:45.520
 higher flight curve thereby also have 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:51.030
 her with the net no problems so the 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:51.030
 just he 8 9-residue now 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:04:02.629
 Serve me briefly that was 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:02.629
 again too hasty and recognized 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:12.750
 18 against me out of la too little 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:15.060
 tension and could have been more so 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:17.870
 Schaumann sentence two and three are in the 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.870
 next media
