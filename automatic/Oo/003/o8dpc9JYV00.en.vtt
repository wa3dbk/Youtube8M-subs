00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.920
 2014 will again be 14% old in year 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.779
 well or not they want the modern 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.310
 good for those few to keep up with 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.960
 dominate sales 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.550
 but the limits have been re- adjusted 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.720
 cars were not a lot of waste 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.260
 good for 14 percent longer 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.000
 addition 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.710
 take the toyota prius become known 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.480
 frisbee addition he falls from it 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.280
 looks outside now it has that 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.980
 importer still has the new lexus ct in the 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.390
 Auris Hybrid and I also in 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.309
 that area is also hard to go then 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.110
 are also many dropouts than I can 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.000
 ford focus volvo v40 have it very 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.620
 well done those frugal diesels but those 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.780
 all no longer fall in 14% 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.370
 what do you have after about a yellow 308 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.079
 is coming but they will go like this later 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.010
 year building so be patient and 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.230
 until then there has been in the c segment 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.190
 only the SMEs foursome the c-yacht 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.379
 the skoda 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.079
 the ground at mose kendo and this is new 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.940
 the audi a3 emotions tdi ultra is 85 grams 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.390
 also 14% addition how does that work in one 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.390
 brother twist 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.060
 for this reason you have promotion once 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:22.630
 video seen king light source from the 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.560
 volvo v40 with this a3 ultra is new 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.180
 but that does not apply to technology 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.140
 because just knew golf bluemotion in old 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.689
 jacket 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.159
 namely for in the 110 hp life system 

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:31.509
 it's the blue motion goes and 10 one 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:33.100
 half a second to 100 there is the blue 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:34.630
 motion has a six-speed sandbox with 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.970
 custom gears mesh the blue 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:39.069
 motion people come 530 grams 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:40.780
 domain gears are therefore longer 

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:42.280
 for frugality 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.630
 and with that you have the only needle pack 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.890
 of powertrain that first gear 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.750
 is so long that when you reach one 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.039
 intersection arrives in its two 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.080
 and a car arrives so you less 

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:50.500
 farival just not quiet i want to get up again 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.119
 corridor 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.149
 yes then in those two you really have too little 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:55.569
 power and you need to anticipate 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:56.890
 to drive 

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:58.659
 the motor itself has more than enough 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:01.649
 force themselves serve half a second from it 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:01.649
 diesel that is fast 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:36.300
 pots were just the similarities 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.860
 what are the different anyway is 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.120
 the wave much more comfortable to well that 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.830
 that's the standard way 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.290
 new golf is comfortable in the markets 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:45.480
 and audi a3 moreover, this following is the 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.700
 Golf 6 was comfortable from the clear 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.200
 or the comfort also classified 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.520
 also to make room for a sportiva 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.410
 That 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.300
 but at this current versions they are 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.490
 both 15 mm lowered 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:58.800
 both the according to the audi and i said at 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:00.240
 the waves earlier in the v40 test that wave 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.740
 for something better, I think correctly 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.270
 namely so soft 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:04.560
 then argue with something the soft too 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:06.660
 comfortable that lowered chassis 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.920
 just a little tighter and me 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.890
 think that he still rides fine years 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.209
 always the words comfortable is pure 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:13.620
 but that audi that is one of itself 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:15.450
 much harder because of the lowered chassis 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.770
 is you then a tipi harder and then 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.020
 do you imagine something of refinement 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:20.459
 it is tighter than follows a brand like 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:21.540
 your hard turns even go and you will 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:25.620
 you can be little temple 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:27.300
 understeer but yes on a bad road 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.080
 world that just that little bit harder and that 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.850
 golf frank just better 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:33.010
 that comes with the cheap versions 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:34.900
 SME platform of range say the 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:36.250
 few motorized versions that have 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.870
 no multi-link rear axle but 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.340
 torcy as a slightly cheaper version 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.680
 with which you make sacrifices in the area 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:43.720
 both handling and comfort 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.820
 that applies to rippled 122hp in the audi 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:48.100
 has that with the libian cities in one 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:49.690
 two tsi and therefore it is behind 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:51.820
 still a little less comfortable in it 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:53.470
 that old ing found a threshold 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:54.820
 yes I find that behind just dark and 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:56.830
 that actually does not suit what an audi 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:04:00.030
 and check the chassis in the 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:00.030
 golf actually better balanced 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:06.310
 does that we enjoy what I call the 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:07.840
 bonkige audi it varies by road 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.340
 sets you nice and smooth as what do you have 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.770
 had no problems at all but bit here 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:13.360
 bonkig what things and the brand just 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:14.380
 I got that wave through the wild 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.250
 just a little more the brands for all 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:16.420
 rear passengers 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:18.310
 thresholds are first half 

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:19.750
 maybe we look at the interior 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:21.280
 yes it in that all those really higher quality 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:23.080
 his very simple choice the best 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:24.010
 materials in the most expensive car quite 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.230
 clean 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:27.670
 nothing here in emmy well on that 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:29.710
 new tunnels find this nice material 

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:30.640
 very nice buttons here terrace just already 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:32.380
 better and 

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:33.640
 car is quieter, they work less 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:35.020
 made of insulation you can 

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:36.640
 to hear 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:38.020
 ergonomics do not differ much from each other 

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:39.790
 according to a touchscreen and I find and 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:42.010
 who just likes it or not in your menu 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:43.600
 both of a way here and on the board 

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:44.890
 u management for you there is not love that 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.150
 just all just a little nicer than is possible 

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:47.680
 not covered easier job 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:51.750
 clearer it is just a moment 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.750
 slightly more invested in logic 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.680
 nice 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.770
 me 

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:19.210
 conclusion then is that there is actually 

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:20.050
 what to choose there are really about it 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:21.430
 to peel 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:22.510
 comfortable sporty very short by the 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:23.740
 I bend that he slightly more 

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:25.060
 finds balance but that has to do with 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:27.040
 that cheap version of that afterwards 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:28.720
 I'm going to look at the interior the audi is 

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:30.370
 just beautiful the materials are beautiful the 

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:31.120
 car silent there is the sound of the audio 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:32.740
 more beautiful 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:34.690
 the seats are nice and yes for that 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:39.220
 so you pay more but need more or more 

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:40.780
 something wants something in the trunk and five 

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:41.920
 doors rl 

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:43.540
 so much more space and a lot 

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:45.280
 more accessible in the back I wanted to say 

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:46.720
 an email from r3 and sportback i would 

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:49.000
 Always take the railroad yourself anyway 

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:50.710
 an audia3 bag only opens the sport 

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.450
 with version of the ultra that is not good 

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:54.730
 for 14 percent but 20 cents do not bite 

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:55.840
 just above 50 grams and then the 

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:58.060
 balance concerns me a bit to the 

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:59.500
 golf looking forward to prizes that is not 

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:01.450
 unimportant 

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:02.980
 the edition of the ultra with a few 

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:04.990
 small options you come the 32 thousand three 

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:06.360
 one hundred and is a golf highline 

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:10.750
 and that comes with that option on it 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:12.190
 30200 to painters 2000 euros approximately 

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:13.600
 call options do not differ much from each other 

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:14.980
 the audi has one to this again 

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:16.210
 parking sensors 

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:18.810
 then i'd have you over one more 

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:18.810
 high-quality car
