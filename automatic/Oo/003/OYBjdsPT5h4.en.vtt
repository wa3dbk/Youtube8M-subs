00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.580 
long-term development and maybe that's
one<00:01:51.149> might<00:01:51.299> look<00:01:51.479> at<00:01:51.630> my<00:01:51.750> younger<00:01:52.110> guys<00:01:52.290> and

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
one might look at my younger guys and

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.740 
one might look at my younger guys and
start<00:01:53.159> trying<00:01:53.340> to<00:01:53.430> build<00:01:53.640> them<00:01:53.759> up<00:01:53.909> and<00:01:54.119> then

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
start trying to build them up and then

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.330 
start trying to build them up and then
you<00:01:54.780> also<00:01:55.079> have<00:01:55.229> confidence<00:01:55.979> and<00:01:56.159> confidence

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
you also have confidence and confidence

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.920 
you also have confidence and confidence
is<00:01:56.729> where<00:01:57.149> you<00:01:57.240> would<00:01:57.329> think<00:01:57.450> about<00:01:57.600> more

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
is where you would think about more

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.230 
is where you would think about more
short-term<00:01:58.409> performance<00:01:58.710> you<00:01:59.520> know<00:01:59.610> make

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
short-term performance you know make

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.350 
short-term performance you know make
sure

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.360 
sure

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.120 
sure
if<00:02:01.510> I'm<00:02:01.720> going<00:02:01.900> to<00:02:02.020> go<00:02:02.110> play<00:02:02.260> a<00:02:02.350> game<00:02:02.620> that<00:02:02.890> you

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
if I'm going to go play a game that you

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.220 
if I'm going to go play a game that you
know<00:02:03.220> I've<00:02:03.370> all<00:02:03.670> my<00:02:03.820> players<00:02:04.060> playing<00:02:04.600> really

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:05.230 
know I've all my players playing really

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:06.600 
know I've all my players playing really
well<00:02:05.350> at<00:02:05.560> the<00:02:05.680> highest<00:02:05.860> level<00:02:06.160> they<00:02:06.250> can<00:02:06.460> you

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
well at the highest level they can you

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:07.500 
well at the highest level they can you
want<00:02:06.730> to<00:02:06.790> make<00:02:06.880> sure<00:02:06.910> they're<00:02:07.120> playing<00:02:07.300> at<00:02:07.420> the

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:07.510 
want to make sure they're playing at the

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:09.749 
want to make sure they're playing at the
highest<00:02:07.540> confidence<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:09.220> biggest<00:02:09.429> way<00:02:09.700> to

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
highest confidence the biggest way to

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:12.390 
highest confidence the biggest way to
raise<00:02:10.000> that<00:02:10.210> is<00:02:10.770> obviously<00:02:11.770> performing<00:02:12.280> well

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
raise that is obviously performing well

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.550 
raise that is obviously performing well
in<00:02:12.430> the<00:02:12.730> game<00:02:12.910> and<00:02:13.090> you'll<00:02:13.630> see<00:02:14.170> that<00:02:14.350> you<00:02:14.530> know

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
in the game and you'll see that you know

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.230 
in the game and you'll see that you know
if<00:02:14.800> you<00:02:14.920> throw<00:02:15.190> three<00:02:15.460> interceptions<00:02:15.790> you'll

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:16.240 
if you throw three interceptions you'll

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.110 
if you throw three interceptions you'll
take<00:02:16.420> a<00:02:16.470> confidence<00:02:17.470> drop<00:02:17.620> from<00:02:17.830> that<00:02:18.120> you

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
take a confidence drop from that you

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.550 
take a confidence drop from that you
perform<00:02:19.510> really<00:02:19.660> well<00:02:19.750> you<00:02:19.900> start<00:02:20.350> feeding

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
perform really well you start feeding

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.170 
perform really well you start feeding
the<00:02:20.710> ball<00:02:20.860> to<00:02:21.010> your<00:02:21.130> receivers<00:02:21.550> they'll<00:02:21.940> start

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
the ball to your receivers they'll start

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.720 
the ball to your receivers they'll start
becoming<00:02:22.450> more<00:02:22.660> confident<00:02:23.110> now<00:02:23.520> in<00:02:24.520> between

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
becoming more confident now in between

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.220 
becoming more confident now in between
those<00:02:25.060> games<00:02:25.300> that's<00:02:25.630> when<00:02:25.840> you<00:02:25.960> would<00:02:26.170> use

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
those games that's when you would use

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.470 
those games that's when you would use
this<00:02:26.590> game<00:02:26.800> prep<00:02:27.010> element<00:02:27.370> of<00:02:27.459> saying<00:02:27.790> let<00:02:28.390> me

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
this game prep element of saying let me

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.510 
this game prep element of saying let me
go<00:02:28.600> in<00:02:28.750> here<00:02:29.080> maybe<00:02:29.350> go<00:02:29.680> through<00:02:30.220> the<00:02:30.340> game

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:30.520 
go in here maybe go through the game

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.640 
go in here maybe go through the game
plan<00:02:30.760> let's<00:02:31.450> go<00:02:31.660> through<00:02:31.870> some<00:02:31.900> drills<00:02:32.290> and

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
plan let's go through some drills and

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.260 
plan let's go through some drills and
you<00:02:33.070> can<00:02:33.220> start<00:02:33.400> building<00:02:33.520> up<00:02:33.700> confidence<00:02:34.060> in

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.270 
you can start building up confidence in

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:37.110 
you can start building up confidence in
that<00:02:34.390> way<00:02:34.630> right<00:02:35.170> so<00:02:36.100> what<00:02:36.490> are<00:02:36.520> jeez<00:02:36.820> kind<00:02:37.030> of

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
that way right so what are jeez kind of

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.610 
that way right so what are jeez kind of
doing<00:02:37.330> right<00:02:37.450> now<00:02:37.600> is<00:02:37.750> kind<00:02:38.200> of<00:02:38.290> filtering

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
doing right now is kind of filtering

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:39.960 
doing right now is kind of filtering
through<00:02:38.860> those<00:02:39.010> different<00:02:39.430> game<00:02:39.760> prep

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
through those different game prep

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.110 
through those different game prep
options<00:02:40.390> yeah<00:02:40.870> so<00:02:41.140> basically<00:02:41.800> if<00:02:42.489> you're

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
options yeah so basically if you're

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.449 
options yeah so basically if you're
running<00:02:43.840> with<00:02:43.930> the<00:02:43.959> Broncos<00:02:44.470> like<00:02:44.890> I<00:02:45.040> will<00:02:45.250> be

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
running with the Broncos like I will be

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:47.880 
running with the Broncos like I will be
Peyton<00:02:46.180> Manning<00:02:46.510> is<00:02:46.600> already<00:02:47.080> as<00:02:47.410> good<00:02:47.739> as

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
Peyton Manning is already as good as

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:49.979 
Peyton Manning is already as good as
he's<00:02:48.130> going<00:02:48.280> to<00:02:48.340> get<00:02:48.550> essentially<00:02:49.270> I<00:02:49.450> mean<00:02:49.900> you

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
he's going to get essentially I mean you

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:51.870 
he's going to get essentially I mean you
can<00:02:50.110> obviously<00:02:50.230> still<00:02:50.770> invest<00:02:51.100> in<00:02:51.280> XP<00:02:51.700> but

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
can obviously still invest in XP but

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.520 
can obviously still invest in XP but
it's<00:02:52.060> gonna<00:02:52.239> be<00:02:52.450> a<00:02:52.480> lot<00:02:52.630> more<00:02:52.690> expensive<00:02:53.110> for<00:02:53.500> a

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
it's gonna be a lot more expensive for a

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.949 
it's gonna be a lot more expensive for a
guy<00:02:53.680> his<00:02:53.950> age<00:02:54.010> same<00:02:55.000> thing<00:02:55.209> with<00:02:55.360> your<00:02:55.480> boy<00:02:55.690> Tom

quarterbacks in the league he's really
don't<00:03:21.610> need<00:03:21.700> to<00:03:21.760> do<00:03:21.910> much<00:03:21.940> more<00:03:22.239> development

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
don't need to do much more development
