00:00:01.879 --> 00:00:09.000
 hello today we will review 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:12.059
 means e-book digma e625 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.429
 that's what I want to say when you take 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.410
 boxed and overturning immediately 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.859
 striking picking 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.150
 I mean the reader itself in the hut cable 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.340
 manual in Russian 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.699
 and warranty card unfortunately more 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.980
 nothing in the box did not put here 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.050
 accordingly, this is all the equipment 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.340
 well now let's try to open and 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:37.489
 let's see what we have inside 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:41.370
 when we open see the whole 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:42.410
 warranty card and that means leadership 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.870
 user 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:49.260
 here we go further means wire 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:52.140
 websby here she charged accordingly 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.180
 will be only from the computer unless of course 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.059
 you will need to purchase more 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.520
 additionally some kind of power supply 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:02.129
 specific javad using from ipad but 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.769
 Respectively from whom I raised either above 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:07.820
 I use it some other charger 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:11.070
 the device is actually the book itself 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:13.049
 the book itself what do you want to say about yourself 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.750
 books but overall it's pretty light 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:18.150
 very well in the hand about it 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.710
 Well done here and everything will be done well 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.720
 such throats . 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:26.100
 build quality is generally sufficient 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:28.530
 good that's what we can here what 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.659
 there is a connector, respectively, only 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.759
 top means jack for headphones pada 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.880
 beat means the power button and 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.310
 shutdown 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:40.750
 here it is specifically four gigabytes 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:43.539
 memory for books, in principle, enough 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:45.520
 4 gigabytes best options 

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:48.700
 consider here well let's try 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:51.070
 turn on here we turn green 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:56.280
 the button itself will now appear 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:56.280
 the screensaver needs to wait a little 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:05.500
 here it is by the way there is a flash card 

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:07.539
 extra micro sit here 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:10.090
 it is still supported here 

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:12.580
 will insert an additional card 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:15.190
 memory but built-in 4g white is quite 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:18.250
 that's enough appoint herself appeared 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:21.970
 the screen saver here is all made intuitively 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:25.260
 very simply understandable and basically here 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:27.579
 even a child can figure it out 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:30.190
 button location is enough here 

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:33.489
 convenient that is , on the left and on the right you can 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:35.349
 take for example if you are right handed i dig 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:36.910
 will scroll right but if you 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:39.579
 for example, you want to drink coffee 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:41.500
 you take a cup of coffee in your right hand 

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:44.680
 y olives and also scroll on both sides 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.930
 There is a button or a mill back and forth then 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:51.190
 there is either hand can look through either 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.910
 forward here from the top last book 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:54.730
 which is 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:56.319
 you read here specifically shown here 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:00.569
 how many pages is read how much 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:02.859
 percent if we click on the last 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:04.540
 It will be our last book is 

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:07.120
 standard no booklet that was here 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:09.579
 uploaded initially and here it is 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:12.940
 I have already downloaded all the pages from which I am 

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:15.069
 finished reading here to come back 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.840
 back the main menu you just need to click 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:20.440
 one button home and we basically 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:23.620
 go back right back here 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:25.750
 scroll the page fast enough we 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.700
 sometimes there is under braking ie here 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:31.300
 I'm not going home now 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:33.250
 Now we continue to try here sometimes 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:36.210
 here it happens but it's okay 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:40.060
 I believe that if it is so a little bit 

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:43.330
 slow down need to see what else 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:45.100
 will be formats own not pumping 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:47.950
 so far nothing so good 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:50.590
 I can not as she will read pdf files 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:53.440
 or another particular standard little book 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:57.520
 here I press the home button coming out 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:59.170
 main here still you have pictures 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:01.720
 you can watch accordingly here already 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:04.210
 two pictures are standard there are windows now 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:05.770
 here we choose one of them here but 

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:08.650
 in principle, picture quality is sufficient 

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:13.420
 acceptable very good enough to me 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:15.730
 I don't know about your own 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:19.650
 actually there is still in 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:22.200
 listening to music installation guide 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:25.120
 we go if you go to the conductor here 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.800
 internal memory and accordingly 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.930
 There are types like on the computer we 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:31.050
 we can see here what documents we have 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:33.610
 how many are here specifically 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:37.200
 initially one document is a book and 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:39.060
 two pictures push the home button 

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:44.620
 installations 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:47.350
 here is the date time fonts here is the interval for 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:49.600
 off but from pripyat and can both 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:51.610
 The settings are not complicated . 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.360
 sort out this system update 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:55.030
 disease 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:56.890
 Well, in general, I want to say the display 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:05:00.460
 a good enough money book 

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:03.820
 you should read enough of her 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:05.950
 nice i like a very light background 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:08.290
 I had kept the books in my hands before 

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:11.169
 which was such a grayish very background not 

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:13.270
 It was very nice to read but in general here 

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:15.790
 this book is good enough and again 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:18.160
 I repeat I do not know how how what files 

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:23.020
 whether it will be well read 

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:25.030
 be pdf pdf files will be with brakes it 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:27.610
 while it does not say anything but to 

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:30.460
 at that moment as we pulled her out 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:32.530
 The boxes are very first impression 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:36.430
 positively very light 

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:38.740
 Very well in the hand here, but in general 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:39.480
 In general, I would advise to buy such 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:42.670
 the book 

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:46.060
 very inexpensive budget 

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:48.480
 the best option and the principle is not necessary well 

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:48.480
 thanks to all
