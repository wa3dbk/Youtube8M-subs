00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.970
 it was to mount die today I 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.589
 am back with a new video 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.390
 and this is a small tutorial 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.040
 hairdresser so I hope you go 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.750
 to love I just came to wear 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.099
 one of his hairstyles so in this 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.660
 video I was proposing 6.6 of 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.549
 different hairstyles that all have the 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.260
 same basis i hope you will me that 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.550
 you 're going to be a little inspired or if 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.619
 do not forget to tell me in 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.960
 comments 1 what was your hairdresser 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.250
 favorite for the first hairstyle that 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.109
 is also the hairstyle you boss 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.789
 must start by separating your hair 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.470
 so leave you a good chunk of 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.330
 your hair close to your face 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.369
 and then you start squeezing a 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:39.690
 French press up to the level of 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:41.160
 your street then until after 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.980
 to have celebrated their 20's is simply 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.000
 continue with a normal braid 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.620
 they are hairstyles that I like 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.370
 really a lot I started to 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.989
 make 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.180
 the session passed to the party session 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.440
 because I really liked the fact that 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.280
 my hair was not going all in case my 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.840
 face 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:59.399
 and then lock up anyway having them 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:01.079
 detached so that's it then you come 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.730
 tie her little braids with a 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.650
 small elastic preferences of the 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.630
 color of your hair and come and do 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.270
 exactly the same on the other side 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.130
 of your head and then it does not matter if 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.450
 your separation and in the middle or on the 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.220
 sides you really do like you 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.320
 want me I preferred to have the 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.530
 hair with a separation a little on 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.530
 the side 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.340
 and then that's all for this 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:30.729
 first headdress at the dock behind me 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.729
 favorite 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:39.140
 for the second time you come 

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:40.909
 will take the traits what you just 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.829
 do and bib the tied back of 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:46.039
 your head with a little pile lastic 

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:47.869
 could leave the hairstyle like that where 

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:49.700
 you can come and remove both 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:52.939
 small elastics of each of your 13 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.560
 and then detached the braids this 

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:58.000
 second version is the version that I 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.000
 I prefer but you have convoler 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:17.200
 for the 3rd hairdresser came to place all 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.200
 your hair both sides 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.270
 for the 3rd hairdresser came to place all 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.710
 your hair on the side and then wanted 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.380
 split in half to come make a 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:29.730
 braid fish could very well do 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.740
 a normal buttock but I wanted 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.360
 do a benefit because I like 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.650
 well the contrast the difference between 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.670
 the two braids 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.320
 but if you want this time more 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.780
 fast you can do a class 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.740
 par 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.390
 so if you do not have a way 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:43.920
 a fish crisis it's super simple it 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.870
 must separate your hair in the party 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.220
 then the each part you want 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.000
 take a little bit and you 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.190
 put on the other side 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.420
 so take a wick floats and 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.010
 the other side you were taking but flames 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:59.400
 were on their side and then you 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:03:01.080
 keep doing this all the way through 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.730
 fourth hairdresser just take 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.959
 his traits what you just did and 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:06.980
 then from their wounds one of them selves 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:06.980
 to create a good messiah 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.030
 this is the 4th hairstyle 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.569
 then for the penultimate what 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:41.989
 had to make a quilt at the back of 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:44.190
 your tender so a low duvet 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:46.440
 carry out the task with the elastic of 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:48.420
 preference and the color of your 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.909
 hair that came to take a small 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:54.510
 lock of hair that you wrapped around 

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:56.220
 of this elastic to hide them you 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:56.670
 tie this wick with a little bit 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:59.220
 thorny 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.750
 and then you're done if you want 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.250
 that it is in means but if you 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:04.230
 want it to be cleaner could 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:05.640
 very well come to fat your hair but 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:11.579
 I like it better like that makes me like 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:12.959
 you want and then finally for the 

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:15.569
 last what was needed a shutter your 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:16.859
 hair on themselves and then you 

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:18.690
 do a little but so good 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:22.250
 also if you do not like it target 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:24.360
 but very well where is used in our 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:26.039
 beautiful for hair that you can 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:30.740
 buy in multiple stores for 

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:30.740
 to make a bun much more elegant 

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:35.190
 so that's all for the video 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.690

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:38.490
