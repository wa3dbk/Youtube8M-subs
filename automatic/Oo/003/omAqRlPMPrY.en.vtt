00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.119 

the<00:00:00.750> first<00:00:00.960> pedal<00:00:01.319> I<00:00:01.469> want<00:00:01.680> to<00:00:01.740> look<00:00:01.860> at<00:00:01.979> is<00:00:02.100> the

00:00:02.119 --> 00:00:02.129 
the first pedal I want to look at is the

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.420 
the first pedal I want to look at is the
AC<00:00:02.399> booster<00:00:02.760> and<00:00:03.270> this<00:00:04.080> is<00:00:04.259> kind<00:00:04.500> of<00:00:04.560> like<00:00:04.740> to

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
AC booster and this is kind of like to

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.490 
AC booster and this is kind of like to
me<00:00:05.609> it<00:00:05.759> sort<00:00:06.359> of<00:00:06.420> has<00:00:06.540> a<00:00:06.569> tube<00:00:06.870> screamer<00:00:07.140> kind

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
me it sort of has a tube screamer kind

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.070 
me it sort of has a tube screamer kind
of<00:00:07.620> vibe<00:00:08.069> to<00:00:08.340> it<00:00:08.370> but<00:00:08.639> it<00:00:09.269> has<00:00:09.480> its<00:00:09.510> own<00:00:09.809> sound

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
of vibe to it but it has its own sound

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.980 
of vibe to it but it has its own sound
too<00:00:10.380> it's<00:00:10.559> a<00:00:10.769> it<00:00:11.519> compresses<00:00:12.360> the<00:00:12.750> note<00:00:12.960> a

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
too it's a it compresses the note a

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.570 
too it's a it compresses the note a
little<00:00:13.380> bit<00:00:13.530> so<00:00:13.679> you<00:00:13.740> get<00:00:13.860> like<00:00:14.040> a<00:00:14.070> real<00:00:14.250> smooth

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
little bit so you get like a real smooth

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.490 
little bit so you get like a real smooth
distortion<00:00:15.210> so<00:00:15.870> this<00:00:16.080> is<00:00:16.109> without<00:00:16.320> the

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
distortion so this is without the

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.689 
distortion so this is without the
distortion<00:00:17.310> on<00:00:18.859> that's<00:00:19.859> just<00:00:19.980> the<00:00:20.070> amp<00:00:20.310> itself

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
distortion on that's just the amp itself

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.250 
distortion on that's just the amp itself
with<00:00:20.880> nothing<00:00:21.180> actually<00:00:21.510> with<00:00:21.720> a<00:00:21.750> little<00:00:21.900> a

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
with nothing actually with a little a

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.590 
with nothing actually with a little a
I'll<00:00:22.380> turn<00:00:22.560> that<00:00:22.650> off<00:00:22.800> too<00:00:23.119> and<00:00:24.119> then<00:00:24.269> this<00:00:24.449> is

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
I'll turn that off too and then this is

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.330 
I'll turn that off too and then this is
what<00:00:24.720> the<00:00:24.960> AC<00:00:25.320> booster<00:00:25.650> on

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.709 

Oh

00:00:34.709 --> 00:00:34.719 

00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:37.329 

so<00:00:35.719> it<00:00:35.780> gives<00:00:35.839> you<00:00:35.989> a<00:00:36.019> lot<00:00:36.170> of<00:00:36.199> gain<00:00:36.530> and<00:00:36.559> a<00:00:37.039> lot

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:37.339 
so it gives you a lot of gain and a lot

00:00:37.339 --> 00:00:48.380 
so it gives you a lot of gain and a lot
of<00:00:37.370> sustained<00:00:37.760> as<00:00:37.910> well

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:56.250 

and<00:00:49.390> again<00:00:50.380> here<00:00:50.680> it<00:00:50.739> is<00:00:50.800> on<00:00:51.070> I<00:00:51.309> mean<00:00:51.580> off<00:00:55.260> then

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:56.260 
and again here it is on I mean off then

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:06.250 
and again here it is on I mean off then
on

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:06.260 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:18.540 

off

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:18.550 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:20.980 

so<00:01:19.550> it's<00:01:19.730> a<00:01:19.790> great<00:01:19.910> distortion<00:01:20.600> pedal<00:01:20.930> I

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
so it's a great distortion pedal I

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.260 
so it's a great distortion pedal I
really<00:01:21.230> like<00:01:21.410> it<00:01:21.590> it's<00:01:22.130> replaced<00:01:22.640> my<00:01:23.000> tube

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
really like it it's replaced my tube

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.080 
really like it it's replaced my tube
screamer<00:01:23.540> so<00:01:23.990> that's<00:01:24.230> good<00:01:24.410> i<00:01:24.620> also<00:01:25.580> have<00:01:25.880> an

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
screamer so that's good i also have an

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.540 
screamer so that's good i also have an
RC<00:01:26.450> booster<00:01:26.600> here<00:01:27.050> which<00:01:27.230> is<00:01:27.410> really<00:01:28.250> keeps

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:28.550 
RC booster here which is really keeps

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:30.520 
RC booster here which is really keeps
the<00:01:28.730> tone<00:01:28.970> pure<00:01:29.570> doesn't<00:01:30.080> really<00:01:30.200> affect<00:01:30.500> the

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
the tone pure doesn't really affect the

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.010 
the tone pure doesn't really affect the
tone<00:01:30.770> too<00:01:30.980> much<00:01:31.160> you<00:01:31.340> can<00:01:31.580> obviously<00:01:31.850> use<00:01:32.810> the

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
tone too much you can obviously use the

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.530 
tone too much you can obviously use the
eq<00:01:33.500> which<00:01:33.740> i<00:01:33.890> do<00:01:33.950> i<00:01:34.340> really<00:01:34.940> like<00:01:35.090> this<00:01:35.210> pedal

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:35.540 
eq which i do i really like this pedal

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.870 
eq which i do i really like this pedal
in<00:01:35.600> the<00:01:35.690> studio<00:01:36.080> when<00:01:36.950> i'm<00:01:37.100> just<00:01:37.280> playing<00:01:37.580> a

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
in the studio when i'm just playing a

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.290 
in the studio when i'm just playing a
just<00:01:38.630> basically<00:01:38.990> guitar<00:01:39.610> maybe<00:01:40.610> chord<00:01:40.970> parts

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:41.300 
just basically guitar maybe chord parts

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.180 
just basically guitar maybe chord parts
or<00:01:41.420> whatever<00:01:41.690> and<00:01:41.930> i<00:01:42.410> like<00:01:42.560> adding<00:01:42.950> just<00:01:43.070> a

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:43.190 
or whatever and i like adding just a

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:45.490 
or whatever and i like adding just a
little<00:01:43.460> bit<00:01:43.550> of<00:01:43.640> gain<00:01:43.850> to<00:01:44.150> the<00:01:44.180> sound<00:01:44.570> to<00:01:45.290> kind

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
little bit of gain to the sound to kind

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:46.900 
little bit of gain to the sound to kind
of<00:01:45.560> just<00:01:45.770> beef<00:01:46.070> it<00:01:46.250> up<00:01:46.340> a<00:01:46.460> little<00:01:46.580> bit<00:01:46.790> this

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:46.910 
of just beef it up a little bit this

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:49.060 
of just beef it up a little bit this
pedal<00:01:47.150> is<00:01:47.240> really<00:01:47.390> good<00:01:47.570> for<00:01:47.720> that<00:01:47.870> so<00:01:48.170> here<00:01:48.980> it

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 
pedal is really good for that so here it

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:50.830 
pedal is really good for that so here it
is<00:01:49.100> let<00:01:49.670> me<00:01:49.760> turn<00:01:49.910> a<00:01:49.970> little<00:01:50.210> bit<00:01:50.390> here<00:01:50.690> it<00:01:50.750> is

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
is let me turn a little bit here it is

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:56.470 
is let me turn a little bit here it is
with<00:01:50.960> an<00:01:51.110> off<00:01:52.570> and<00:01:53.570> here<00:01:53.750> it<00:01:53.810> is<00:01:53.840> with<00:01:53.990> it<00:01:54.140> on<00:01:55.480> so

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:56.480 
with an off and here it is with it on so

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.060 
with an off and here it is with it on so
you<00:01:56.570> see<00:01:56.750> it<00:01:56.840> adds<00:01:56.990> a<00:01:57.140> bit<00:01:57.320> of<00:01:57.350> distortion<00:01:57.710> to

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.070 
you see it adds a bit of distortion to

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:59.680 
you see it adds a bit of distortion to
it<00:01:58.130> as<00:01:58.250> well<00:01:58.280> you<00:01:58.760> know<00:01:58.850> I<00:01:58.880> can<00:01:59.120> turn<00:01:59.270> that<00:01:59.480> down

00:01:59.680 --> 00:01:59.690 
it as well you know I can turn that down

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:03.270 
it as well you know I can turn that down
more<00:02:00.250> and<00:02:01.250> get<00:02:01.430> more<00:02:01.460> of<00:02:01.760> a<00:02:01.820> just<00:02:02.060> a<00:02:02.210> tone

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
more and get more of a just a tone

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:10.600 
more and get more of a just a tone
that's<00:02:04.280> what<00:02:04.490> the<00:02:04.610> gain<00:02:04.820> almost<00:02:05.270> off<00:02:09.610> it's

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
that's what the gain almost off it's

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:11.950 
that's what the gain almost off it's
really<00:02:10.760> good<00:02:11.030> for<00:02:11.180> these<00:02:11.300> little<00:02:11.600> amps

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:11.960 
really good for these little amps

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:13.690 
really good for these little amps
because<00:02:12.320> it<00:02:12.470> really<00:02:12.680> gives<00:02:13.010> the<00:02:13.220> amp<00:02:13.370> a<00:02:13.520> lot

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
because it really gives the amp a lot

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.450 
because it really gives the amp a lot
more<00:02:14.230> weight<00:02:15.230> than<00:02:15.590> normally<00:02:16.010> would<00:02:16.130> have<00:02:16.280> you

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:16.460 
more weight than normally would have you

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:18.100 
more weight than normally would have you
know<00:02:16.490> normally<00:02:17.090> this<00:02:17.210> amp<00:02:17.420> wouldn't<00:02:17.750> sound<00:02:17.900> is

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
know normally this amp wouldn't sound is

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.150 
know normally this amp wouldn't sound is
this<00:02:18.770> heavy<00:02:20.320> you<00:02:21.320> know<00:02:21.440> so<00:02:21.650> if<00:02:21.800> i<00:02:21.890> put<00:02:22.070> a<00:02:22.100> little

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
this heavy you know so if i put a little

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.380 
this heavy you know so if i put a little
gain<00:02:22.580> on<00:02:22.850> with<00:02:23.060> the<00:02:23.150> RC<00:02:23.480> booster<00:02:25.270> all<00:02:26.270> right

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
gain on with the RC booster all right

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:37.580 
gain on with the RC booster all right
thinking<00:02:26.750> is<00:02:26.870> the<00:02:27.320> sound<00:02:27.590> of<00:02:27.770> it<00:02:27.830> up

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.289 

it's<00:02:38.590> a<00:02:38.650> really<00:02:38.739> nice<00:02:38.980> distortion<00:02:39.970> sound<00:02:40.150> as

00:02:40.289 --> 00:02:40.299 
it's a really nice distortion sound as

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:42.420 
it's a really nice distortion sound as
well<00:02:40.480> you<00:02:40.750> know<00:02:40.870> and<00:02:41.170> using<00:02:41.950> them<00:02:42.069> together
