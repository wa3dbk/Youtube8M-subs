bending below the ball and almost having

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.650 
bending below the ball and almost having
the<00:00:32.040> idea<00:00:32.189> of<00:00:32.399> creating<00:00:32.820> the<00:00:32.910> spin<00:00:33.149> before<00:00:33.329> you

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:18.600 
now it's very important if you're a
woman<00:05:17.320> out<00:05:17.560> there<00:05:17.590> and<00:05:17.980> you<00:05:18.070> like<00:05:18.310> to<00:05:18.430> play

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:18.610 
woman out there and you like to play

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:20.370 
woman out there and you like to play
tennis<00:05:18.820> but<00:05:19.210> one<00:05:19.360> of<00:05:19.450> the<00:05:19.540> studies<00:05:19.960> is<00:05:20.140> shown

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:20.380 
tennis but one of the studies is shown

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:22.140 
tennis but one of the studies is shown
scientifically<00:05:21.160> that<00:05:21.400> women<00:05:21.850> are<00:05:21.970> actually

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:22.150 
scientifically that women are actually

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:25.200 
scientifically that women are actually
about<00:05:22.570> 15<00:05:23.050> centimeters<00:05:23.320> higher<00:05:24.010> than<00:05:24.700> men<00:05:25.000> in

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:25.210 
about 15 centimeters higher than men in

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:27.060 
about 15 centimeters higher than men in
most<00:05:25.480> sports<00:05:25.780> which<00:05:26.290> means<00:05:26.560> you<00:05:26.680> have<00:05:26.800> a<00:05:26.830> big

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:27.070 
most sports which means you have a big

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:29.040 
most sports which means you have a big
disadvantage<00:05:27.540> because<00:05:28.540> you're<00:05:28.720> having<00:05:28.900> to

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:29.050 
disadvantage because you're having to

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:30.750 
disadvantage because you're having to
hit<00:05:29.230> the<00:05:29.350> ball<00:05:29.530> from<00:05:29.620> a<00:05:29.740> much<00:05:29.950> higher<00:05:30.160> level

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:30.760 
hit the ball from a much higher level

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:32.790 
hit the ball from a much higher level
you're<00:05:30.940> losing<00:05:31.330> power<00:05:31.660> but<00:05:32.440> you're<00:05:32.590> also

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:32.800 
you're losing power but you're also

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:35.190 
you're losing power but you're also
losing<00:05:33.280> topspin<00:05:33.790> which<00:05:34.000> is<00:05:34.150> control<00:05:34.540> so<00:05:34.960> if

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:35.200 
losing topspin which is control so if

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:36.840 
losing topspin which is control so if
you<00:05:35.350> can<00:05:35.560> really<00:05:35.920> work<00:05:36.100> with<00:05:36.280> lowering<00:05:36.730> your

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:36.850 
you can really work with lowering your

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:38.610 
you can really work with lowering your
center<00:05:37.150> of<00:05:37.180> gravity<00:05:37.320> getting<00:05:38.320> a<00:05:38.380> good

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:38.620 
center of gravity getting a good

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:41.010 
center of gravity getting a good
shoulder<00:05:38.920> turn<00:05:39.130> and<00:05:39.550> bending<00:05:40.300> your<00:05:40.330> knees<00:05:40.780> so

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:41.020 
shoulder turn and bending your knees so

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:42.390 
shoulder turn and bending your knees so
that<00:05:41.050> you<00:05:41.230> can<00:05:41.410> drive<00:05:41.650> off<00:05:41.860> the<00:05:41.980> back<00:05:42.160> of<00:05:42.190> the

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:42.400 
that you can drive off the back of the

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:43.650 
that you can drive off the back of the
ball<00:05:42.640> you're<00:05:43.030> going<00:05:43.180> to<00:05:43.270> see<00:05:43.390> vast

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:43.660 
ball you're going to see vast

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:45.630 
ball you're going to see vast
