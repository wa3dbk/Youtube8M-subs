00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.309
 already build cottages all the details on 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:09.859
 Metro stations 

00:00:09.859 --> 00:00:11.539
 hence companies agree 

00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:13.279
 North Caucasian home this process 

00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:16.279
 talking about nationalization everything will go well 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:20.370
 the red color of the leaves all leads the center 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.820
 bearing external wall with the usual mind 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:23.669
 brick house 

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:26.049
 but this deception is actually outside only 

00:00:26.049 --> 00:00:27.919
 plastic imitation brick 

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:30.239
 the basis of the building is a frame that is sheathed with thin 

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:32.129
 mineral fiber panels 

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:34.769
 builders have not regretted and claim that the house 

00:00:34.769 --> 00:00:36.309
 will be reinforced will even save 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:38.610
 on heating 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:39.860
 to a minimum 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.030
 According to the weather forecast in the far corner of the goal 1 0 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:45.060
 new materials 

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:46.380
 practiced construction 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:47.250
 university 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.560
 at the moment they are testing insulation 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.190
 you can create any kind of weather in your cell 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.800
 Now inside the frost but hearing and an hour ago 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.940
 there was snow with rain but as it shows 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.910
 readiness another way man meter can 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:59.590
 replace 10 centimeters of this 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:01.700
 material but will not miss the cold 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.890
 the dwelling is perfect for building so 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:05.930
 called the passive house idea 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:07.280
 sowing house can be formulated 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.450
 just enough this building or structure 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.800
 whose heat loss is so much 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:12.840
 insignificant 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.100
 that separate heating systems do not 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.050
 required 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:18.370
 the first passive house was built for almost 20 years 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:19.500
 back in germany 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.780
 Thought so for a house thermos without 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.600
 heat loss even in cold weather will be 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.640
 enough human heat energy 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.590
 which allocate electrical appliances to 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.560
 people were not cold truth arose 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.680
 the problem is people breathe 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.680
 ventilation fresh air had to 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.100
 preheat but air heating 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.090
 it turned out all the same much more economical 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.970
 now in the same germany 16 thousand 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:41.550
 passive houses and the technology itself 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:43.540
 passive house 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:45.690
 focused on the essential 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:47.460
 reduction of energy costs for in 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.190
 the mean lie without trouble industry and 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:51.310
 Beijing is dismal on separate dates 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:52.870
 impossible to zero 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:54.810
 in our word of course to zero we 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.340
 really the team will be quite 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.910
 substantial sometimes the basement is fine 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:00.870
 also when it comes to building 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:02.590
 country house can be substantially 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:04.050
 save on construction 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:05.190
 materials taking advantage of 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:06.830
 frame technology 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:07.910
 cottage or half the price 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:10.050
 traditional truth whether such 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.380
 technology Russians question because in our 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.860
 country the concept of home and of course capital 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.610
 for life of wood and brick and if
