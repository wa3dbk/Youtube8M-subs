00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:13.510
 hello guys this is broadcasting channel 100 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:16.180
 Types My name is Alexander and good 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:17.980
 to 2 russian for btr and online 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:20.020
 last week I have been a little 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:22.240
 I spent 1 class 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:24.970
 profession and made a few conclusions 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:27.190
 because the cartoon game is suitable for me that 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:29.939
 liked her and what surprised and what 

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:31.779
 caused dislike and mail me a hand 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.790
 the first thing I would like to draw 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:35.680
 attention is different classes 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:37.690
 I will not go into much detail 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.140
 since the u tube is already full of good 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:40.690
 video 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.700
 telling whom to play go 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.010
 just for a few moments probably 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:47.890
 the most important thing that torments many players 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:49.960
 for the first time included the same time you 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:52.270
 opt for greater pvp advantage 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:54.489
 since in t-re non-target system and 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:56.289
 By the way is very good then the dimensions of your 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:58.440
 character will indirectly affect 

00:00:56.289 --> 00:01:01.210
 success of your flp what i mean 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.250
 imagine a small cube which 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:05.740
 is a character he is normal 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:08.410
 called hitbox literally box for 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.970
 shock that is in contact with shock or 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:11.710
 skills in this area 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:14.080
 your character will be counted 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:16.540
 damage and now match the sizes 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:19.090
 little nyashny elen hefty 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:21.369
 barracks naturally get on barracks 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.979
 will be much easier and in pvp 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:26.170
 it will be to put it mildly not much but if 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:27.790
 you are not a tank with a good keyway of course but 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.670
 This does not mean that you can now choose 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:32.860
 and little ilyin or shaggy poppuri 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:35.470
 take the one you like best 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:38.229
 I personally began to download a brutal man 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:40.900
 Amano berserker class before I year 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:43.060
 three or four played in battle and remembering the glorious 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:45.729
 Gladiator moments I first thing 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.770
 I decided to try in the body of the pier and I can 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:49.960
 Immediately say that my wait a little 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.210
 Berserk is not justified 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.579
 slowest class in tyre and slow 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:55.299
 on all and on movement and on speed 

00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:57.280
 attacks 

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:59.710
 honestly after a few hours of play 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:02.079
 already started to tire of such debts for 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.729
 swings yes he has a very powerful butting 

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:04.680
 bet love but forbes 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:06.840
 this is not a knife 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.369
 made my ass smoke though 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.470
 there have been pleasant moments 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:13.620
 for example, when you kill a mage from one 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.480
 hitting if you hit with that blow 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.520
 Yes, and I can better say that on the spot 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:21.030
 standing but from the slowest speed 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:23.520
 Runs in our pvp and so smoking Danichka 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.830
 washed down with a bright flame but there is 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.350
 little correction all this agony before 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.390
 60 leveled there too you can set the heat 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:32.340
 therefore, I recommend da capo for without 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.410
 your generalization is written a quick 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.300
 pump over now let's shortly about 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.370
 the pros and cons that I noticed in 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.320
 Tyre probably the most important minus for 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.630
 me this lack of warring 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.830
 parties that is, all players are boiled in 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.470
 one big pot 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:49.410
 so the main source of fan and pvp is 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.600
 Naturally cup player killer if anyone 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.340
 did not know how to decipher the thesis about 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.830
 eco there is practically no punishment 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.870
 you can cut as many people as you like 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:59.880
 including small level of and you for 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.430
 it is nothing but an opportunity 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:05.280
 disable this most while some time 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:07.470
 I'm not a big fan of such a spider where 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.420
 you are being surreptitiously utah to that 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:12.030
 anywhere on video 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.799
 One wise guy pumped a big lvl and now 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.320
 standing at the entrance and killing everyone 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:18.660
 and even if others come high 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.700
 level and the hell is not with him something he will do 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:22.769
 just take and jump back into 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:25.110
 the city will wait there and be again 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:26.930
 go round maybe saturdays lead 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:29.730
 any additional penalties for 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:31.440
 abuse for now but it is unlikely that 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.600
 about war guilds then in tyre they 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.430
 organized pretty well main in 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.170
 guilds can through a special menu 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:40.650
 declare war on another guild 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:42.299
 after 24 hours all data members 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:44.760
 clans will be in pvp mode 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:46.620
 between each other by the way quite comfortable 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.420
 the solution now does not need to include yet 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:51.540
 to overwhelm the enemy from another guild 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:53.880
 after 24 hours points will be calculated 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.920
 all the killings on each side and announced 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:58.079
 winner and again such pvp on 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.460
 lover since it's just a stupid srach 

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:02.430
 between the leaders 

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:03.870
 connections of relationships and other nonsense in 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.760
 general full kindergarten 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.800
 Personally, I prefer this 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.870
 the key to the example fell in warcraft and I 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:11.550
 old pile of the old republic second 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:13.320
 a moment which we did not really like a 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:14.520
 this is excessive mobility etc. 

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:16.650
 various trivia 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:18.870
 such as special stones 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:20.730
 insertion arm which armor 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:22.890
 just darkness from the heap of various 

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:24.990
 bonuses and surpluses and such a blizzard 

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:26.520
 quite a lot and in all this will have 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:28.650
 good deal 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.470
 another minus who immediately rushes to 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:33.060
 eyes are the lack of a normal plot 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:35.940
 quests all monotonous even the main 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:38.850
 missions the world of the game review is very boring 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:40.950
 desire to read the quest no one 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:42.930
 Of course it doesn't matter to me 

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:45.540
 more interesting yet to play when the world is better 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:47.550
 let's work though what else can you expect in 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:49.710
 this plan from korean and can you pg 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:51.480
 from what I liked, I would single out 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:54.270
 fine but he is trading the system 

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:57.090
 interesting pvp is interesting precisely by 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:59.670
 your gameplay and good graphics and yes 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:01.770
 in general, the world itself looks very beautiful 

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:04.260
 to summarize, i would recommend tera 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:06.420
 first of all to those who dragged their time 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:08.730
 from lineage 2 and the rest linear 

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:11.130
 similar games for whom the plot itself 

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:13.620
 the game is in second place after beauty 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:14.490
 suits and the ability to fit 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:16.800
 other players 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:18.690
 and of course terra will love it 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:21.570
 animeshnym which there really 

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:23.520
 a lot well, perhaps all for today 

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:25.020
 write if you like terra 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:27.880
 subscribe to the channel 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:30.930
 there will be many more videos on various topics 

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:30.930
 until new meetings bye
