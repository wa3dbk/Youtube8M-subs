start the spikes which is you do a
little<00:02:42.050> dome<00:02:43.050> ish<00:02:46.280> thing<00:02:47.280> from<00:02:47.850> starting<00:02:48.540> from

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
little dome ish thing from starting from

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:59.510 
little dome ish thing from starting from
left<00:02:48.870> those<00:02:49.080> face<00:02:57.650> you<00:02:58.650> can<00:02:59.010> pape<00:02:59.220> a<00:02:59.340> little

left those face you can pape a little

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:04.670 
left those face you can pape a little
bit<00:03:01.100> and<00:03:02.100> then<00:03:03.020> we<00:03:04.020> can<00:03:04.140> get<00:03:04.200> a<00:03:04.260> good<00:03:04.440> enough

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
bit and then we can get a good enough

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.780 
bit and then we can get a good enough
length<00:03:04.920> you're<00:03:05.340> gonna<00:03:05.459> go<00:03:05.700> down<00:03:07.489> that's<00:03:08.489> gonna

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
length you're gonna go down that's gonna

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:14.350 
length you're gonna go down that's gonna
be<00:03:08.910> a<00:03:08.940> top<00:03:09.270> spike<00:03:09.690> then<00:03:10.380> you're<00:03:10.470> gonna<00:03:10.560> start<00:03:10.980> a

and then start the second spike well I

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:27.550 
and then start the second spike well I
ran<00:03:22.860> out<00:03:22.980> of<00:03:23.010> paper<00:03:23.220> so<00:03:24.920> I'll<00:03:25.920> start<00:03:26.310> that<00:03:26.489> here

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
ran out of paper so I'll start that here

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
spike and go there okay never start the

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.130 
spike and go there okay never start the
ear<00:03:41.430> you<00:03:42.360> start<00:03:42.570> at<00:03:42.630> the<00:03:42.690> left<00:03:42.840> side<00:03:42.930> of<00:03:43.080> the

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
ear you start at the left side of the

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:49.270 
ear you start at the left side of the
face<00:03:43.260> again<00:03:43.620> you<00:03:44.120> make<00:03:45.120> a<00:03:45.150> little<00:03:45.450> triangle

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.430 

and<00:03:50.280> then<00:03:50.580> you<00:03:50.670> start<00:03:51.120> from<00:03:51.930> the<00:03:52.080> tip<00:03:52.290> of<00:03:52.320> the

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
and then you start from the tip of the

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.490 
and then you start from the tip of the
triangle<00:03:53.000> or<00:03:54.000> the<00:03:54.090> vertex<00:03:54.660> wanting<00:03:55.440> a

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
triangle or the vertex wanting a

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.520 
triangle or the vertex wanting a
technical<00:03:56.040> and<00:03:56.940> go<00:03:57.120> down<00:03:57.330> the<00:03:58.110> side<00:03:58.320> of<00:03:58.410> face

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
technical and go down the side of face

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:01.580 
technical and go down the side of face
again<00:03:58.860> then<00:03:59.190> you<00:03:59.280> start<00:03:59.580> from<00:03:59.940> this<00:04:00.060> angle<00:04:00.590> and

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
again then you start from this angle and

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.440 
again then you start from this angle and
go<00:04:01.770> back<00:04:01.980> up<00:04:02.160> there

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
go back up there

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:05.940 
go back up there
now<00:04:04.450> for<00:04:04.630> the<00:04:04.690> other<00:04:04.750> here<00:04:05.050> you<00:04:05.230> start<00:04:05.590> above

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:05.950 
now for the other here you start above

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:09.720 
now for the other here you start above
his<00:04:06.340> eyebrow<00:04:06.850> over<00:04:07.480> here<00:04:08.460> make<00:04:09.460> another

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:09.730 
his eyebrow over here make another

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:14.970 
his eyebrow over here make another
triangle<00:04:11.040> don't<00:04:12.040> put<00:04:12.220> a<00:04:12.250> bottom<00:04:12.610> on<00:04:12.700> it<00:04:13.980> and

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:14.980 
triangle don't put a bottom on it and

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.789 
triangle don't put a bottom on it and
then<00:04:15.250> make<00:04:16.209> one<00:04:16.450> another<00:04:16.750> little<00:04:17.049> triangle<00:04:17.560> in

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:17.799 
then make one another little triangle in

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:23.870 
then make one another little triangle in
it<00:04:20.070> and<00:04:21.270> then<00:04:22.270> start<00:04:22.630> from<00:04:22.810> this<00:04:22.990> angle<00:04:23.170> and

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 
it and then start from this angle and

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:33.330 
it and then start from this angle and
just<00:04:24.880> draw<00:04:25.060> a<00:04:25.090> line<00:04:25.270> it<00:04:25.770> there<00:04:28.620> now<00:04:32.280> start<00:04:33.280> with

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.340 
just draw a line it there now start with

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:42.420 
just draw a line it there now start with
his<00:04:33.490> eyes<00:04:34.620> do<00:04:35.620> a<00:04:36.630> Jewish<00:04:38.250> shape<00:04:41.160> then<00:04:42.160> do

his eyes do a Jewish shape then do

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:50.040 
his eyes do a Jewish shape then do
another<00:04:42.550> u.s.<00:04:43.330> shape<00:04:48.510> and<00:04:49.510> then<00:04:49.660> you're<00:04:49.960> gonna

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.050 
another u.s. shape and then you're gonna

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:53.750 
another u.s. shape and then you're gonna
do<00:04:50.230> the<00:04:50.580> light<00:04:51.580> reflection<00:04:52.060> of<00:04:52.330> his<00:04:52.420> eyes<00:04:52.570> by

starting on one side and just making a

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:01.490 
starting on one side and just making a
little<00:04:57.490> circle<00:04:58.060> line<00:04:59.400> or<00:05:00.400> curved<00:05:00.820> line<00:05:01.060> to

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:01.500 
little circle line or curved line to

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:04.230 
little circle line or curved line to
each<00:05:02.500> side<00:05:02.800> of<00:05:02.830> the<00:05:02.980> eye<00:05:03.070> you'll<00:05:03.790> make<00:05:03.970> another

little circle on the bottom then make

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:14.450 
little circle on the bottom then make
another<00:05:09.430> curved<00:05:09.970> line<00:05:10.860> under<00:05:11.860> the<00:05:12.220> first

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:14.460 
another curved line under the first

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:20.100 
another curved line under the first

bit and make like an arrow and then draw
a<00:05:36.430> line<00:05:36.880> underneath<00:05:38.490> now<00:05:39.490> you<00:05:39.580> just<00:05:39.730> take<00:05:39.880> your

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:40.030 
a line underneath now you just take your

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:50.670 
a line underneath now you just take your
pencil<00:05:40.950> shade<00:05:41.950> in<00:05:42.190> the<00:05:42.310> dark<00:05:42.520> part<00:05:42.820> of<00:05:42.940> his<00:05:43.030> eye
