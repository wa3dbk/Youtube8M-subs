00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:11.210
 hello what do you tell me 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:16.730
 curiosity that is the namaste party 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:20.020
 well I tell you this originated 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:22.250
 does I believe that my son has now 15 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:24.230
 16 years 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.940
 although we within our 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:29.090
 own transformation of our own 

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:30.789
 life I do not know personally between a 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:34.750
 depression 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:37.270
 I know a woman she goes to india 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:39.520
 I tell you what envy you give me 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:41.739
 question can you come and I tell you only 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.930
 I have to want then that is 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:46.420
 solve is true only one has to 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:49.180
 want something to do something because everyone 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:51.250
 we are free also then then 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.980
 I went with her the Indian and let's say 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:56.220
 what 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:59.460
 one day it impressed me so much at the level of 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:02.520
 another culture so old and so so 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.850
 out of our mental schemes that 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:08.119
 we can have the day to day 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:11.900
 and it helped me a lot in finding a 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:13.280
 key in a philosophy of life where there 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.009
 a word first word that I learned 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.780
 in English that was form of salz forms to 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:19.670
 what to say to oneself for a word 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.170
 that I was really impressed 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.490
 bring or depression also comes to you 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.750
 when maybe you do not identify much 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:24.799
 with what you're seeing around when 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.440
 you see society how it is working 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:29.750
 when you see the partners as they cheat 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.770
 your women I do not tell you but good 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.200
 when you see a little what is being 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.670
 cooking then indicates when it arrives 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.450
 to india was one thing that impressed me 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:40.550
 very much the truth then there 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:43.149
 the greeting the Hindu greeting is a greeting 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:43.149
 Sanskrit 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:47.650
 it is also used as an hour and a goodbye 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.690
 but let's say that originally you have 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:51.850
 more you want to say that the translation 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:54.340
 literal would be the god that is in me 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:56.829
 recognize the god in you 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:59.439
 then one thing that good that has 

00:01:56.829 --> 00:02:00.939
 a depth not as a word the 

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:01.790
 God in me recognizes the god that 

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:03.500
 there is in you 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.120
 then we are traveling by 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.680
 line a year where there are I tried to do 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.750
 yoga and my ass hurt because I never 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.090
 I had sat quietly it was always 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.460
 like that which tells you in another example if 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.110
 they see you very calm in our society 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:16.940
 I say it, there is always no forgiveness 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.500
 why not 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.630
 if you are calm and well if you are 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.610
 sick if you are active they say 'you do 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:25.580
 that you're worth 'not a little bit is a bit 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:27.230
 thing but to host this guy is good 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.860
 new this boy your cost and if you're 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:31.880
 quiet since it 's for good then 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.830
 well I'm traveling a year for the 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.910
 Indian and the truth is that I opened a 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.910
 door to spirituality 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.330
 clear and you see a lot of deep things and you see 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.590
 a reality within the planet that does not 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.150
 it's our reality here but it 's real 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.280
 because he's here too and here are the 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.590
 twelve and there are also six but it is 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.920
 the same reality then we 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:55.170
 We came with good learning or opening 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:58.490
 a new door in our life 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.490
 we will go here the island 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:03.739
 the rest here the shelves there 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.970
 then we are lovers too a 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:06.040
 little bit of healthy food meal 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.299
 vegetarian 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.870
 and a kind of relaxation music 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:09.870
 as well 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:14.860
 of a spirit as a place and then 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:15.910
 we created and founded this party 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.410
 of the week more than the truth that the 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:19.600
 I recommend everyone to come to 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:22.420
 the island namasté that we make it 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:24.610
 homework every Wednesday 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:26.110
 the philosophy of what I'm saying is not 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:27.730
 is for promoting the party but because 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:29.770
 I'm really sorry because it's a 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.780
 night really that everyone is going 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:35.050
 to go happy be grandparents are children 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:37.060
 be parents and it's very nice to see how it 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:40.270
 can enjoy sunset all together 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.620
 then others proposed instead of 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:43.600
 the tasks of creating this party that 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:47.140
 called namasté that I think this year is 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:50.050
 the 15th anniversary where we focused the 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:52.900
 thing towards no alcohol and even food 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:54.490
 vegetarian towards the chai is a kind of 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.200
 energetic tea that is taken a lot in the 

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:58.599
 India 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.530
 all this other world that also exists 

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:04.069
 that is a bit him 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:06.590
 the good healthy thing we found this party 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:09.680
 in the tasks what we do there is 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:10.940
 invite different artists of the world 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.760
 always a little we like quite the 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:16.940
 ethnic theme theme theme with roots 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:18.320
 but more than anything else is a night 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:19.940
 where we make a very nice chivas what 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:22.240
 we decorate in our bohemian way with 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:24.290
 India salts with appointments 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.550
 lay on the floor with the other table 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:27.080
 They present normal restaurant too 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:29.910
 we make a kind of food a little 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:32.670
 exotic and healthy 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:35.220
 we have an area where there are performances 

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:38.690
 live of these instruments that the 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.690
 children are all sitting there we go 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:45.270
 documentaries on television because 

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:47.280
 will deposit the chambers type of Africa or 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:48.690

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:53.150
 can enjoy the family not only 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:56.040
 in the young 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:58.140
 we can not have the whole family together 

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:59.340
 where each one will find their space and 

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:01.140
 what more I when it starts to give the 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.840
 night and I see that mom dances with the 

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:04.690
 son 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:08.020
 I already say this is because it is very 

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:11.050
 nice to see it then well we're 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:12.699
