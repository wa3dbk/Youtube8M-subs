but i'm very pleased with that I was

00:06:12.669 --> 00:06:15.210 
but i'm very pleased with that I was
really<00:06:12.820> nervous<00:06:12.909> so<00:06:13.419> our<00:06:14.199> next<00:06:14.349> check<00:06:14.949> off<00:06:15.070> is

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:15.220 
really nervous so our next check off is

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:17.520 
really nervous so our next check off is
going<00:06:15.400> to<00:06:15.460> be<00:06:15.550> over<00:06:15.849> Drake<00:06:16.360> suctioning<00:06:17.199> and

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:17.530 
going to be over Drake suctioning and

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:20.310 
going to be over Drake suctioning and
just<00:06:17.740> tracheostomy<00:06:18.460> care<00:06:19.110> but<00:06:20.110> that's<00:06:20.229> not
