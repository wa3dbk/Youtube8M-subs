00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:04.259 
let's take a look at how a car moves

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:15.049 
let's take a look at how a car moves
turns<00:00:05.220> and<00:00:05.700> stops<00:00:08.630> ignition<00:00:09.630> on<00:00:13.429> each<00:00:14.429> part<00:00:14.849> as

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
turns and stops ignition on each part as

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.980 
turns and stops ignition on each part as
it<00:00:15.480> is<00:00:15.570> explained<00:00:16.080> in<00:00:17.240> order<00:00:18.240> to<00:00:18.390> get<00:00:18.570> the<00:00:18.720> car

to<00:00:19.020> move<00:00:19.439> you<00:00:20.220> have<00:00:20.400> to<00:00:20.580> first<00:00:20.820> depress<00:00:21.330> the

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
to move you have to first depress the

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.580 
to move you have to first depress the
clutch<00:00:21.779> pedal<00:00:23.539> before<00:00:24.539> putting<00:00:25.170> the<00:00:25.320> shift

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590

clutch pedal before putting the shift
lever<00:00:25.859> into<00:00:26.340> gear<00:00:29.420> you<00:00:30.420> then<00:00:30.660> depress<00:00:31.140> the

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
lever into gear you then depress the

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.830 
lever into gear you then depress the
accelerator<00:00:31.399> to<00:00:32.399> increase<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:33.120> engine<00:00:33.510> speed

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
accelerator to increase the engine speed

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.180 
accelerator to increase the engine speed
as<00:00:34.110> you<00:00:34.559> graduate

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
as you graduate

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.760 
as you graduate
take<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.520> foot<00:00:35.820> off<00:00:35.969> the<00:00:36.239> clutch<00:00:36.530> the<00:00:37.530> wheels

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
take the foot off the clutch the wheels

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.709 
take the foot off the clutch the wheels
now<00:00:38.010> begin<00:00:38.579> to<00:00:38.790> turn

00:00:41.709 --> 00:00:41.719 

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:43.979 

notice<00:00:42.469> how<00:00:42.710> the<00:00:42.769> power<00:00:43.160> from<00:00:43.640> the<00:00:43.850> engine

00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:43.989 
notice how the power from the engine

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:47.910 
notice how the power from the engine
traveled<00:00:44.989> through<00:00:45.320> the<00:00:45.379> clutch<00:00:46.510> transmission

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:47.920 
traveled through the clutch transmission

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.880 
traveled through the clutch transmission
driveshaft<00:00:49.510> differential<00:00:50.510> rear<00:00:51.050> axle<00:00:51.680> is

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:51.890 
driveshaft differential rear axle is

driveshaft differential rear axle is
fondly<00:00:52.519> -<00:00:52.879> the<00:00:53.000> wheels<00:00:57.640> okay<00:00:58.670> let's<00:00:59.269> increase

00:00:59.799 --> 00:00:59.809 
fondly - the wheels okay let's increase

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:03.549 
fondly - the wheels okay let's increase
the<00:01:00.049> speed<00:01:00.320> of<00:01:00.379> it<00:01:01.570> moving<00:01:02.570> the<00:01:02.930> shift<00:01:03.260> lever

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:03.559 
the speed of it moving the shift lever

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:05.830 
the speed of it moving the shift lever
changes<00:01:04.399> the<00:01:04.610> gear<00:01:04.879> ratio<00:01:05.420> in<00:01:05.659> the

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:05.840 
changes the gear ratio in the

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.380 
changes the gear ratio in the
transmission<00:01:06.619> causing<00:01:07.399> the<00:01:07.520> speed<00:01:07.850> to

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.390 
transmission causing the speed to

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:14.660 
transmission causing the speed to
increase

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:20.399 

no<00:01:15.210> excessive<00:01:15.840> speed<00:01:16.140> has<00:01:16.560> increased

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:20.409 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:24.880 

let's<00:01:21.409> take<00:01:21.679> a<00:01:21.710> look<00:01:22.039> at<00:01:22.310> how<00:01:22.549> a<00:01:22.579> car<00:01:22.939> turns<00:01:23.890> by

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
let's take a look at how a car turns by

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:26.709 
let's take a look at how a car turns by
turning<00:01:25.369> the<00:01:25.490> steering<00:01:25.759> wheel<00:01:26.179> to<00:01:26.539> the<00:01:26.569> right

00:01:26.709 --> 00:01:26.719 
turning the steering wheel to the right

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:29.529 
turning the steering wheel to the right
the<00:01:27.409> pinion<00:01:27.859> gear<00:01:27.890> and<00:01:28.490> steering<00:01:29.090> linkage

00:01:29.529 --> 00:01:29.539 
the pinion gear and steering linkage

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:31.719 
the pinion gear and steering linkage
work<00:01:29.960> to<00:01:30.259> move<00:01:30.439> the<00:01:30.500> front<00:01:30.890> wheels<00:01:31.250> to<00:01:31.609> the

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:31.729 
work to move the front wheels to the

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:34.120 
work to move the front wheels to the
right<00:01:31.909> which<00:01:32.719> results<00:01:33.319> in<00:01:33.469> the<00:01:33.590> vehicle

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
right which results in the vehicle

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:40.020 
right which results in the vehicle
itself<00:01:34.520> turning<00:01:35.119> points

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.030 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:47.160 

now<00:01:41.030> let's<00:01:41.719> turn<00:01:41.990> up

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.170 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:52.260 

look<00:01:47.710> closely<00:01:48.130> at<00:01:48.640> the<00:01:48.790> rear<00:01:49.000> wheels<00:01:51.120> can<00:01:52.120> you

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.270 
look closely at the rear wheels can you

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:54.510 
look closely at the rear wheels can you
see<00:01:52.600> that<00:01:52.900> the<00:01:53.050> outer<00:01:53.290> wheel<00:01:53.680> opposite<00:01:54.370> the

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 
see that the outer wheel opposite the

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.730 
see that the outer wheel opposite the
direction<00:01:54.670> of<00:01:55.270> the<00:01:55.420> turn<00:01:55.630> actually<00:01:56.440> spins

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
direction of the turn actually spins

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:01.560 
direction of the turn actually spins
faster<00:01:59.280> that's<00:02:00.280> because<00:02:00.790> the<00:02:01.000> unlit<00:02:01.360> wheel

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.570 
faster that's because the unlit wheel

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:03.780 
faster that's because the unlit wheel
has<00:02:01.900> to<00:02:02.080> travel<00:02:02.560> a<00:02:02.680> greater<00:02:02.979> distance<00:02:03.100> than

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:03.790 
has to travel a greater distance than

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:09.240 
has to travel a greater distance than
the<00:02:04.150> internal<00:02:06.960> this<00:02:07.960> action<00:02:08.530> is<00:02:08.770> controlled

the internal this action is controlled

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:16.870 
the internal this action is controlled
by<00:02:09.399> the<00:02:09.580> differential<00:02:10.360> gears
