custom-designed hybrid calling

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.240 
custom-designed hybrid calling
technology<00:00:27.449> which<00:00:28.050> relies<00:00:28.470> on<00:00:28.500> your<00:00:28.859> Wi-Fi

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
technology which relies on your Wi-Fi

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.460 
technology which relies on your Wi-Fi
connection<00:00:29.699> primarily<00:00:30.269> for<00:00:30.900> calls<00:00:31.140> and

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
connection primarily for calls and

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.520 
connection primarily for calls and
messages<00:00:32.189> and<00:00:32.369> we<00:00:32.790> are<00:00:32.910> not<00:00:33.120> on<00:00:33.300> Wi-Fi<00:00:33.530> it

messages and we are not on Wi-Fi it

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.260 
messages and we are not on Wi-Fi it
automatically<00:00:35.070> switches<00:00:35.579> back<00:00:35.730> over<00:00:36.090> to

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
cellular on sprint's nationwide network

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.150 
cellular on sprint's nationwide network
since<00:00:39.600> most<00:00:39.780> of<00:00:39.989> us<00:00:40.170> are<00:00:40.350> on<00:00:40.440> Wi-Fi<00:00:40.590> most<00:00:41.040> of

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
since most of us are on Wi-Fi most of

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.580 
since most of us are on Wi-Fi most of
the<00:00:41.250> time<00:00:41.520> it<00:00:42.000> makes<00:00:42.059> a<00:00:42.329> lot<00:00:42.450> of<00:00:42.480> sense<00:00:42.629> to<00:00:43.200> be

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
the time it makes a lot of sense to be

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.850 
the time it makes a lot of sense to be
able<00:00:43.860> to<00:00:43.980> use<00:00:44.280> Wi-Fi<00:00:44.969> for<00:00:45.510> talk<00:00:45.750> text<00:00:46.410> and<00:00:46.770> data

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
able to use Wi-Fi for talk text and data

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.979 
able to use Wi-Fi for talk text and data
so<00:00:47.280> that's<00:00:47.520> really<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:48.059> beauty<00:00:48.539> of<00:00:48.840> how

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
so that's really the beauty of how

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.170 
so that's really the beauty of how
republic<00:00:49.559> Wireless<00:00:50.039> works<00:00:50.340> and<00:00:50.610> from<00:00:51.059> my

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
republic Wireless works and from my

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.060 
republic Wireless works and from my
personal<00:00:51.629> experience<00:00:51.780> it<00:00:52.379> actually<00:00:52.800> works

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
personal experience it actually works

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.040 
personal experience it actually works
quite<00:00:53.550> well<00:00:53.610> since<00:00:54.149> I<00:00:54.239> haven't<00:00:54.390> ran<00:00:54.660> into<00:00:54.930> any

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
quite well since I haven't ran into any

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.279 
quite well since I haven't ran into any
problems<00:00:55.530> making<00:00:56.460> or<00:00:56.789> receiving<00:00:57.000> a<00:00:57.539> call<00:00:58.050> or

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
problems making or receiving a call or

00:00:58.289 --> 00:00:59.990 
problems making or receiving a call or
dropping<00:00:58.620> any<00:00:58.739> calls<00:00:59.010> while<00:00:59.280> transitioning

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
dropping any calls while transitioning

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.200 
dropping any calls while transitioning
from<00:01:00.359> Wi-Fi<00:01:00.870> to<00:01:00.930> cellular<00:01:01.649> or<00:01:01.920> vice<00:01:02.250> versa<00:01:02.579> so

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
from Wi-Fi to cellular or vice versa so

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.690 
from Wi-Fi to cellular or vice versa so
really<00:01:03.449> is<00:01:03.750> a<00:01:03.830> seamless<00:01:04.830> transition<00:01:04.860> that

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
really is a seamless transition that

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.450 
really is a seamless transition that
works<00:01:06.350> the<00:01:07.350> call<00:01:07.590> quality<00:01:07.770> is<00:01:08.010> actually

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
works the call quality is actually

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.670 
works the call quality is actually
pretty<00:01:08.670> good<00:01:08.880> on<00:01:09.090> Wi-Fi<00:01:09.540> if<00:01:09.780> you<00:01:09.930> have<00:01:10.140> decent

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
pretty good on Wi-Fi if you have decent

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.770 
pretty good on Wi-Fi if you have decent

call<00:01:12.990> quality<00:01:13.290> over<00:01:13.890> cellular<00:01:14.159> should<00:01:14.640> be

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
call quality over cellular should be

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.210 
call quality over cellular should be
solid<00:01:15.090> but<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:15.810> best<00:01:15.930> part<00:01:16.140> is<00:01:16.350> republic

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.559 
so now let's talk about the actual
device<00:03:34.440> the<00:03:35.099> Moto<00:03:35.310> G<00:03:35.549> itself<00:03:35.970> so<00:03:36.150> let's<00:03:36.299> start

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:36.569 
device the Moto G itself so let's start

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:38.930 
device the Moto G itself so let's start
off<00:03:36.720> with<00:03:37.019> the<00:03:37.410> design<00:03:37.889> so<00:03:38.190> the<00:03:38.310> Moto<00:03:38.489> G<00:03:38.730> is

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
off with the design so the Moto G is

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.479 
off with the design so the Moto G is
very<00:03:39.480> similar<00:03:39.840> to<00:03:39.989> the<00:03:40.169> Moto<00:03:40.470> X<00:03:40.769> in<00:03:41.040> terms<00:03:41.069> of

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
very similar to the Moto X in terms of

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:43.400 
very similar to the Moto X in terms of
design<00:03:41.910> we<00:03:42.299> still<00:03:42.540> have<00:03:42.660> the<00:03:42.840> curve<00:03:43.169> in<00:03:43.290> the

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
design we still have the curve in the

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.949 
design we still have the curve in the
dimple<00:03:43.829> on<00:03:43.950> the<00:03:44.430> back<00:03:44.639> for<00:03:44.940> the<00:03:45.060> motorola<00:03:45.359> logo

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
dimple on the back for the motorola logo

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:48.800 
dimple on the back for the motorola logo

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
143 grams so it's definitely not light

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.180
