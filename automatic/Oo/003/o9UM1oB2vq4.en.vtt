to some EVE Online and look at what I

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:06.200 
to some EVE Online and look at what I
found

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.210 
found

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.200

j16 five oh five six pretty interesting
wormhole<00:00:10.110> that<00:00:11.040> I<00:00:11.099> come<00:00:11.340> across<00:00:11.429> look<00:00:12.059> at

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
wormhole that I come across look at

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.209 
wormhole that I come across look at
everything<00:00:12.540> that's<00:00:12.900> available<00:00:13.019> to<00:00:13.650> do<00:00:13.860> here

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
everything that's available to do here

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.900 
everything that's available to do here
including<00:00:14.910> several<00:00:15.680> sleeper<00:00:16.680> data<00:00:17.340> sites<00:00:17.670> and

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
including several sleeper data sites and

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.700 
including several sleeper data sites and
the<00:00:18.119> sleeper<00:00:18.449> relic<00:00:18.720> site<00:00:18.750> and<00:00:19.140> also<00:00:19.529> a

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
the sleeper relic site and also a

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.500 
the sleeper relic site and also a
greased<00:00:20.130> as<00:00:20.310> a<00:00:20.340> relic<00:00:20.640> site<00:00:20.820> so<00:00:21.000> potentially

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
greased as a relic site so potentially

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.060 
greased as a relic site so potentially
we<00:00:21.539> could<00:00:21.750> get<00:00:21.930> some<00:00:22.109> good<00:00:22.140> money<00:00:22.470> out<00:00:22.740> of<00:00:22.769> this

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
we could get some good money out of this

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.800 
we could get some good money out of this
of<00:00:23.550> course<00:00:23.670> you<00:00:23.910> have<00:00:24.029> to<00:00:24.150> be<00:00:24.269> a<00:00:24.300> little<00:00:24.539> bit

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
of course you have to be a little bit

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:25.490 
of course you have to be a little bit
careful

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
careful

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.019 
careful
so<00:00:25.890> I'm<00:00:26.189> ups<00:00:26.609> let's<00:00:27.119> replace<00:00:28.789> repress<00:00:29.789> our

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
so I'm ups let's replace repress our

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.590 
so I'm ups let's replace repress our
orbit<00:00:30.510> here<00:00:31.700> the<00:00:32.700> ones<00:00:32.880> that<00:00:33.120> are<00:00:33.300> most

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
orbit here the ones that are most

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.360 
orbit here the ones that are most
time-efficient<00:00:34.350> will<00:00:34.530> always<00:00:34.950> be<00:00:35.160> this

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
time-efficient will always be this

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.280 
time-efficient will always be this
pirate<00:00:35.850> really<00:00:36.450> excites<00:00:36.719> of<00:00:36.870> course<00:00:37.050> another

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
pirate really excites of course another

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.830 
pirate really excites of course another
find<00:00:37.800> one<00:00:38.040> there's<00:00:38.489> also<00:00:38.730> only<00:00:38.850> one<00:00:39.239> wormhole

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
find one there's also only one wormhole

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.410 
find one there's also only one wormhole
so<00:00:40.170> only<00:00:40.379> our<00:00:40.710> entrance<00:00:41.340> from<00:00:41.610> heizak<00:00:42.090> is

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
so only our entrance from heizak is

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.510 
so only our entrance from heizak is
there<00:00:42.989> and<00:00:43.290> this<00:00:43.890> is<00:00:43.950> a<00:00:44.070> golden<00:00:44.460> opportunity

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
there and this is a golden opportunity

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.490 
there and this is a golden opportunity
of<00:00:45.090> course<00:00:45.360> to<00:00:45.539> make<00:00:45.660> some<00:00:45.870> money<00:00:46.050> doesn't

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
of course to make some money doesn't

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.360 
of course to make some money doesn't
look<00:00:46.590> like<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:47.309> normal<00:00:47.969> is<00:00:48.120> to<00:00:48.360> actively

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.370 
look like the normal is to actively

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.060 
look like the normal is to actively
farmed<00:00:50.370> and<00:00:50.579> from<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.660> kill<00:00:51.870> boards<00:00:52.289> doesn't

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
farmed and from the kill boards doesn't

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.170 
farmed and from the kill boards doesn't
look<00:00:53.190> like<00:00:53.399> there's<00:00:53.640> that<00:00:53.820> much<00:00:53.969> activity

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
look like there's that much activity

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.389 
look like there's that much activity
here<00:00:54.510> either<00:00:54.870> so<00:00:55.050> yeah<00:00:55.649> let's<00:00:55.980> give<00:00:56.219> this<00:00:56.340> a

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
here either so yeah let's give this a

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.760 
here either so yeah let's give this a
try<00:00:56.610> of<00:00:56.850> course<00:00:57.199> trying<00:00:58.199> to<00:00:58.320> do<00:00:58.440> this<00:00:58.559> as

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
try of course trying to do this as

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.150 
try of course trying to do this as
safely<00:00:59.160> as<00:00:59.370> we<00:00:59.609> can<00:00:59.910> I<00:01:00.469> did<00:01:01.469> have<00:01:01.620> to<00:01:01.800> spend

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
safely as we can I did have to spend

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.560 
safely as we can I did have to spend
quite<00:01:02.370> a<00:01:02.430> bit<00:01:02.489> of<00:01:02.699> time<00:01:02.850> scanning<00:01:03.329> everything

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
quite a bit of time scanning everything

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.890 
quite a bit of time scanning everything
done<00:01:03.989> but<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:04.920> final<00:01:05.250> one<00:01:05.430> was<00:01:05.790> a<00:01:06.060> gusta<00:01:06.630> site

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
done but the final one was a gusta site

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.410 
done but the final one was a gusta site
so<00:01:07.290> but<00:01:08.010> see<00:01:08.220> if<00:01:08.280> we<00:01:08.430> either<00:01:08.610> get<00:01:08.970> some<00:01:09.240> money

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
so but see if we either get some money

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.410 
so but see if we either get some money
or<00:01:09.689> if<00:01:10.110> it<00:01:10.500> is<00:01:10.710> actually<00:01:11.280> a<00:01:11.310> trap<00:01:11.729> we'll<00:01:12.060> find

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
or if it is actually a trap we'll find

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.999 
or if it is actually a trap we'll find
out<00:01:12.570> pretty<00:01:12.600> soon<00:01:13.140> as<00:01:13.560> we<00:01:14.100> do<00:01:14.369> cloak<00:01:15.140> on<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.530> on

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
out pretty soon as we do cloak on the on

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.160 
out pretty soon as we do cloak on the on
the<00:01:17.220> structure<00:01:17.670> here<00:01:18.030> that<00:01:18.240> means<00:01:18.840> we<00:01:19.020> can

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
the structure here that means we can

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.070 
the structure here that means we can
start<00:01:19.409> targeting<00:01:19.920> and<00:01:20.549> when<00:01:21.360> that's<00:01:21.509> done<00:01:21.689> we

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
start targeting and when that's done we

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.429 
start targeting and when that's done we
should<00:01:22.290> be<00:01:22.439> able<00:01:22.560> to<00:01:23.479> start<00:01:24.479> our<00:01:24.689> head<00:01:25.140> here

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
should be able to start our head here

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.039 
should be able to start our head here
close<00:01:26.100> eye<00:01:26.310> on<00:01:26.549> this<00:01:26.729> can<00:01:27.060> of<00:01:27.270> course<00:01:27.570> as<00:01:27.810> well

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
close eye on this can of course as well

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.960 
close eye on this can of course as well
and<00:01:28.619> here<00:01:29.369> we<00:01:29.490> go<00:01:29.960> remain<00:01:30.960> so<00:01:31.290> that's<00:01:31.579> five<00:01:32.579> we

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
and here we go remain so that's five we

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.730 
and here we go remain so that's five we
definitely<00:01:33.450> want<00:01:33.630> to<00:01:33.720> get<00:01:33.960> away<00:01:34.079> from<00:01:34.259> that

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
definitely want to get away from that

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.760 
definitely want to get away from that
now<00:01:35.549> one<00:01:35.700> is<00:01:35.820> very<00:01:36.060> welcome<00:01:36.570> three<00:01:37.079> four<00:01:37.470> three

now one is very welcome three four three
so<00:01:38.130> that<00:01:38.280> means<00:01:38.460> there's<00:01:38.700> oh<00:01:38.970> here<00:01:39.900> is<00:01:40.020> the

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
so that means there's oh here is the

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.480 
so that means there's oh here is the
core<00:01:40.439> okay<00:01:41.189> grab<00:01:42.030> that<00:01:42.500> that's<00:01:43.500> not<00:01:43.829> that<00:01:44.189> much

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
core okay grab that that's not that much

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.830 
core okay grab that that's not that much
but<00:01:44.880> okay<00:01:46.040> next<00:01:47.040> one<00:01:47.340> let's<00:01:48.000> maybe<00:01:48.360> put<00:01:48.479> that<00:01:48.810> a

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
but okay next one let's maybe put that a

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.920 
but okay next one let's maybe put that a
bit<00:01:49.020> more<00:01:49.200> here<00:01:49.619> and<00:01:50.090> again<00:01:51.090> back<00:01:51.390> to<00:01:51.420> the<00:01:51.720> disk

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
bit more here and again back to the disk

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.270 
bit more here and again back to the disk
an<00:01:52.229> of<00:01:52.409> course<00:01:52.740> try<00:01:53.369> to<00:01:53.430> stay<00:01:53.909> safe<00:01:54.240> who<00:01:54.570> knows

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
an of course try to stay safe who knows

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.980 
an of course try to stay safe who knows
you<00:01:56.280> should<00:01:56.490> always<00:01:56.729> assume<00:01:57.090> that<00:01:57.390> there<00:01:57.869> is

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
you should always assume that there is

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.859 
you should always assume that there is
someone<00:01:58.350> watching<00:01:58.829> but<00:01:59.100> of<00:01:59.219> course<00:01:59.460> if<00:02:00.030> you

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
someone watching but of course if you

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.959 
someone watching but of course if you
never<00:02:01.110> take<00:02:01.380> the<00:02:01.560> gamble<00:02:01.799> you<00:02:02.430> will<00:02:02.579> never<00:02:02.759> end

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
never take the gamble you will never end

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:08.029 
never take the gamble you will never end
up<00:02:03.119> doing<00:02:03.360> anything<00:02:03.810> so<00:02:04.170> we<00:02:04.860> go<00:02:06.860> maybe<00:02:07.860> I'll

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
up doing anything so we go maybe I'll

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.640 
up doing anything so we go maybe I'll
try<00:02:08.250> crossing<00:02:08.910> this<00:02:09.690> way<00:02:09.959> for

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
try crossing this way for

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.030 
try crossing this way for
-<00:02:12.459> one<00:02:12.819> yep<00:02:13.750> here<00:02:14.019> is<00:02:14.110> the<00:02:14.230> corpse<00:02:14.650> that's

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
- one yep here is the corpse that's

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.270 
- one yep here is the corpse that's
pretty<00:02:15.400> awesome<00:02:15.629> and<00:02:16.709> that<00:02:17.709> is<00:02:17.920> quite

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
pretty awesome and that is quite

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.399 
pretty awesome and that is quite
disappointing<00:02:19.030> it<00:02:19.180> is<00:02:19.330> a<00:02:19.540> little<00:02:19.750> bit<00:02:19.930> of<00:02:20.080> take

00:02:20.399 --> 00:02:20.409 
disappointing it is a little bit of take

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:24.770 
disappointing it is a little bit of take
to<00:02:21.090> salvage<00:02:22.090> but<00:02:22.420> the<00:02:22.840> value<00:02:23.260> not<00:02:23.769> very<00:02:24.099> high

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
to salvage but the value not very high

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:30.330 
to salvage but the value not very high
okay<00:02:25.780> on<00:02:26.200> to<00:02:26.440> the<00:02:26.470> next<00:02:26.620> one<00:02:26.980> then<00:02:28.049> a<00:02:29.049> ruble<00:02:29.829> so

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
okay on to the next one then a ruble so

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.630 
okay on to the next one then a ruble so
that<00:02:30.610> should<00:02:30.940> be<00:02:30.970> pretty<00:02:31.420> fast<00:02:32.370> still<00:02:33.370> they

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
that should be pretty fast still they

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.089 
that should be pretty fast still they
are<00:02:33.760> worth<00:02:34.030> doing<00:02:34.870> because<00:02:35.200> sometimes<00:02:35.950> you

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:36.099 
are worth doing because sometimes you

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:41.160 
are worth doing because sometimes you
get<00:02:36.250> good<00:02:36.459> stuff<00:02:36.730> out<00:02:36.819> of<00:02:37.000> them<00:02:37.180> and<00:02:38.819> core<00:02:40.170> see

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
get good stuff out of them and core see

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.800 
get good stuff out of them and core see
if<00:02:41.230> we<00:02:41.349> can<00:02:41.530> find<00:02:41.980> it<00:02:42.250> that's<00:02:42.730> not<00:02:43.060> it

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
if we can find it that's not it

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.720 
if we can find it that's not it
nope<00:02:44.319> yep<00:02:45.190> here<00:02:45.489> it<00:02:45.609> is<00:02:45.760> okay<00:02:47.010> grab<00:02:48.010> that<00:02:48.310> a

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
nope yep here it is okay grab that a

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.050 
nope yep here it is okay grab that a
million<00:02:50.879> okay

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
million okay

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.690 
million okay
not<00:02:52.329> great<00:02:52.720> so<00:02:52.989> far<00:02:53.349> I'll<00:02:53.920> do<00:02:54.099> a<00:02:54.129> quick<00:02:54.250> burst

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
not great so far I'll do a quick burst

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.740 
not great so far I'll do a quick burst
of<00:02:54.879> the<00:02:55.269> micro<00:02:55.629> drive<00:02:55.930> for<00:02:56.200> this<00:02:56.290> one<00:02:57.750> let's

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
of the micro drive for this one let's

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.710 
of the micro drive for this one let's
hope<00:02:58.959> I<00:02:59.109> don't<00:02:59.170> overshoot<00:02:59.739> it<00:03:00.420> well<00:03:01.420> I<00:03:01.450> get

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
hope I don't overshoot it well I get

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.780 
hope I don't overshoot it well I get
quite<00:03:01.959> some<00:03:02.109> velocity<00:03:02.650> so<00:03:02.890> let's<00:03:03.310> take<00:03:03.579> our

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
quite some velocity so let's take our

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:08.099 
quite some velocity so let's take our
time<00:03:03.819> we're<00:03:04.780> dropping<00:03:06.299> fast<00:03:07.299> enough<00:03:07.659> I<00:03:07.810> think

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:08.109 
time we're dropping fast enough I think

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:10.559 
time we're dropping fast enough I think
okay<00:03:08.859> here<00:03:09.099> we<00:03:09.220> go<00:03:09.250> still<00:03:09.849> one<00:03:10.180> eye<00:03:10.209> on<00:03:10.329> the

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:10.569 
okay here we go still one eye on the

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:14.280 
okay here we go still one eye on the
disk<00:03:10.780> and<00:03:11.049> of<00:03:11.230> course<00:03:11.560> Oh<00:03:13.290> completely

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
disk and of course Oh completely

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:17.400 
disk and of course Oh completely
coordinates<00:03:15.329> so<00:03:16.329> we'll<00:03:16.480> take<00:03:16.750> that<00:03:16.930> or<00:03:17.200> that's

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 
coordinates so we'll take that or that's

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:21.199 
coordinates so we'll take that or that's
another<00:03:17.709> ruble<00:03:18.190> okay<00:03:18.730> there<00:03:19.030> we<00:03:19.150> go

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:24.059 

core<00:03:22.209> grabbed<00:03:22.660> oh<00:03:23.139> my<00:03:23.530> god<00:03:23.799> such<00:03:24.040> a

00:03:24.059 --> 00:03:24.069 
core grabbed oh my god such a

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:26.400 
core grabbed oh my god such a
disappointing<00:03:24.880> first<00:03:25.209> relic<00:03:25.690> site<00:03:25.720> that<00:03:26.230> I've

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
disappointing first relic site that I've

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.300 
disappointing first relic site that I've
get<00:03:26.889> to<00:03:27.069> do<00:03:27.900> since<00:03:28.900> coming<00:03:29.260> back<00:03:29.290> to<00:03:29.680> Yana<00:03:29.950> here

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
get to do since coming back to Yana here

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:34.020 
get to do since coming back to Yana here
so<00:03:31.209> far<00:03:31.510> at<00:03:31.690> least<00:03:32.639> next<00:03:33.639> one

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
so far at least next one

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:35.580 
so far at least next one
at<00:03:34.090> least<00:03:34.269> this<00:03:34.480> gun<00:03:34.720> is<00:03:34.900> still<00:03:35.019> clear<00:03:35.379> I'm

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
at least this gun is still clear I'm

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.069 
at least this gun is still clear I'm
still<00:03:36.040> doing<00:03:36.370> them<00:03:36.549> and<00:03:36.760> if<00:03:37.329> you<00:03:37.480> drop<00:03:37.720> it<00:03:37.750> it

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:38.079 
still doing them and if you drop it it

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:42.720 
still doing them and if you drop it it
sets<00:03:38.500> it<00:03:39.430> will<00:03:39.849> often<00:03:40.449> just<00:03:40.900> be<00:03:41.319> set<00:03:41.620> close<00:03:42.489> to

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 
sets it will often just be set close to

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:44.580 
sets it will often just be set close to
the<00:03:42.849> first<00:03:43.120> few<00:03:43.419> containers<00:03:43.840> just<00:03:44.319> because

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
the first few containers just because

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.559 
the first few containers just because
they<00:03:44.739> are<00:03:44.889> the<00:03:45.040> closest<00:03:45.459> to<00:03:46.030> the<00:03:46.180> warp<00:03:46.389> in

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:46.569 
they are the closest to the warp in

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:49.949 
they are the closest to the warp in
point<00:03:46.870> so<00:03:47.169> let's<00:03:48.099> see<00:03:48.280> if<00:03:48.459> we<00:03:48.489> can<00:03:48.959> get

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 
point so let's see if we can get

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:51.750 
point so let's see if we can get
anything<00:03:50.230> done<00:03:50.590> here<00:03:50.650> mmm<00:03:51.459> that<00:03:51.730> is

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
anything done here mmm that is

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.360 
anything done here mmm that is
suspicious<00:03:52.569> of<00:03:52.720> course<00:03:53.019> but<00:03:53.889> here<00:03:54.129> is<00:03:54.220> the

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.370 
suspicious of course but here is the

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:57.689 
suspicious of course but here is the
core<00:03:54.639> okay<00:03:55.150> lucky<00:03:56.040> 1.7<00:03:57.040> million<00:03:57.280> that's

00:03:57.689 --> 00:03:57.699 
core okay lucky 1.7 million that's

00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:59.610 
core okay lucky 1.7 million that's
finally<00:03:58.269> somewhat<00:03:58.720> better<00:03:58.989> I<00:03:59.109> really<00:03:59.410> should

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 
finally somewhat better I really should

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:03.420 
finally somewhat better I really should
also<00:03:59.769> think<00:04:00.549> about<00:04:00.699> reloading<00:04:02.129> orbit<00:04:03.129> at<00:04:03.370> a

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
also think about reloading orbit at a

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:05.699 
also think about reloading orbit at a
thousand<00:04:04.209> quick<00:04:04.780> bursts<00:04:05.049> of<00:04:05.230> the<00:04:05.319> microbe

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:05.709 
thousand quick bursts of the microbe

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:08.309 
thousand quick bursts of the microbe
drive<00:04:05.949> reloading<00:04:06.639> my<00:04:06.849> my<00:04:07.660> probes

00:04:08.309 --> 00:04:08.319 
drive reloading my my probes

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:12.000 
drive reloading my my probes
since<00:04:09.099> I<00:04:09.220> am<00:04:09.280> decloaked<00:04:09.760> anyway<00:04:10.180> and<00:04:11.010> one

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
since I am decloaked anyway and one

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:14.640 
since I am decloaked anyway and one
final<00:04:12.340> remains<00:04:13.000> so<00:04:13.690> only<00:04:13.930> one<00:04:14.199> ruins<00:04:14.530> of

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
final remains so only one ruins of

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:16.920 
final remains so only one ruins of
course<00:04:14.919> chance<00:04:15.340> for<00:04:15.639> good<00:04:15.970> loot<00:04:16.180> not<00:04:16.720> that

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 
course chance for good loot not that

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:19.949 
course chance for good loot not that
high<00:04:17.199> here<00:04:17.590> but<00:04:17.739> still<00:04:18.609> always<00:04:18.880> worth<00:04:19.449> it<00:04:19.659> to

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 
high here but still always worth it to

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:21.740 
high here but still always worth it to
check<00:04:20.200> him<00:04:20.349> out

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750 
check him out

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.730 
check him out
despair<00:04:22.750> pirate<00:04:23.289> relic<00:04:23.680> sights

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 
despair pirate relic sights

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:28.890

the time I spent scanning it is not the

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:18.070 
the time I spent scanning it is not the
most<00:05:15.409> efficient<00:05:16.419> but<00:05:17.419> overall<00:05:17.780> this<00:05:18.020> is

6 million from a pirate relic sighs but

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:35.000 
6 million from a pirate relic sighs but
this<00:06:32.520> is<00:06:32.669> also<00:06:33.080> part<00:06:34.080> of<00:06:34.169> the<00:06:34.290> experience<00:06:34.710> the

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:35.010 
this is also part of the experience the

difference<00:06:35.490> with<00:06:35.760> the<00:06:35.940> mining<00:06:36.360> bust<00:06:36.570> is<00:06:36.780> that

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:37.020 
difference with the mining bust is that

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:40.310 
difference with the mining bust is that
while<00:06:37.650> I<00:06:37.680> was<00:06:37.889> doing<00:06:38.250> this<00:06:38.550> I<00:06:39.479> noticed<00:06:40.139> their

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:41.880 
mining operation on this can of course

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:44.240 
mining operation on this can of course
and<00:06:42.120> depending<00:06:42.660> on<00:06:42.840> what<00:06:43.229> you<00:06:43.380> find<00:06:43.410> you<00:06:44.010> can

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:44.250 
and depending on what you find you can

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:48.020 
and depending on what you find you can
