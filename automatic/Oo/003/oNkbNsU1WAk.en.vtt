00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
opening the heart of a mechanical

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.280 
opening the heart of a mechanical
movement<00:02:18.800> which<00:02:19.400> is<00:02:19.610> basically<00:02:20.239> the<00:02:20.480> the

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
movement which is basically the the

balance wheel it escape wheel and you

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.050 
balance wheel it escape wheel and you
see<00:02:24.140> the<00:02:24.380> beats

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
see the beats

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.060 
see the beats
it<00:02:26.060> features<00:02:26.720> as<00:02:27.050> I<00:02:27.170> said<00:02:27.380> a<00:02:27.410> high<00:02:27.800> frequency

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.070 
it features as I said a high frequency

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:30.910 
it features as I said a high frequency
chronograph<00:02:28.850> that<00:02:29.150> beats<00:02:29.390> at<00:02:29.920> 36,000

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
chronograph that beats at 36,000

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.009 
chronograph that beats at 36,000
vibrations<00:02:31.400> per<00:02:31.519> hour<00:02:31.700> so<00:02:31.970> it's<00:02:32.120> 10<00:02:32.420> beats<00:02:32.720> per

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:33.019 
vibrations per hour so it's 10 beats per

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:37.680 
vibrations per hour so it's 10 beats per
second<00:02:33.500> which<00:02:33.800> is<00:02:33.830> a<00:02:34.269> outstanding<00:02:36.010> frequency

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
second which is a outstanding frequency

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.150 
second which is a outstanding frequency
meaning<00:02:38.690> basically<00:02:38.870> the<00:02:39.319> higher<00:02:39.530> frequency

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
meaning basically the higher frequency

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.100 
meaning basically the higher frequency
the<00:02:40.280> more<00:02:40.430> accurate<00:02:40.819> it<00:02:40.850> gets<00:02:41.180> then<00:02:41.959> it

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
the more accurate it gets then it

when our head of production at the time

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:05.920 
when our head of production at the time
called<00:03:01.070> the<00:03:01.190> shampoo<00:03:01.850> he<00:03:02.750> actually<00:03:04.510> was<00:03:05.510> told

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
called the shampoo he actually was told

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.680 
called the shampoo he actually was told
you<00:03:06.290> know<00:03:06.440> it<00:03:06.650> during<00:03:06.920> the<00:03:07.010> quartz<00:03:07.340> crisis<00:03:07.790> he

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 
you know it during the quartz crisis he

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:11.800 
you know it during the quartz crisis he
was<00:03:08.720> told<00:03:09.140> by<00:03:09.290> the<00:03:09.380> senior<00:03:09.739> management<00:03:10.220> to<00:03:10.810> to

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
was told by the senior management to to

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:16.530 
was told by the senior management to to
sell<00:03:12.110> or<00:03:12.440> to<00:03:12.820> just<00:03:13.820> to<00:03:14.480> get<00:03:14.630> rid<00:03:14.840> of<00:03:14.870> all<00:03:15.340> old

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
sell or to just to get rid of all old

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.560 
sell or to just to get rid of all old
plants<00:03:17.540> all<00:03:17.720> machines<00:03:18.489> all<00:03:19.489> tools<00:03:20.000> that<00:03:20.390> were

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:20.570 
plants all machines all tools that were

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:22.930 
plants all machines all tools that were
actually<00:03:21.079> used<00:03:21.290> for<00:03:21.530> producing<00:03:22.280> mechanical

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
actually used for producing mechanical

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:26.680 
actually used for producing mechanical
timepieces<00:03:23.680> because<00:03:24.680> no<00:03:25.040> one<00:03:25.250> believed<00:03:25.609> in<00:03:26.030> in

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
timepieces because no one believed in in

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:29.229 
timepieces because no one believed in in
the<00:03:26.810> future<00:03:27.170> of<00:03:27.290> mechanical<00:03:27.799> watches<00:03:28.209> so<00:03:29.209> I

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:29.239 
the future of mechanical watches so I

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:30.940 
the future of mechanical watches so I
mean<00:03:29.720> quartz<00:03:30.109> watches<00:03:30.320> were<00:03:30.560> less<00:03:30.769> expensive

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 
mean quartz watches were less expensive

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:33.940 
mean quartz watches were less expensive
more<00:03:31.760> accurate<00:03:32.239> so<00:03:32.390> there<00:03:32.570> was<00:03:32.690> no<00:03:32.950> real

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:33.950 
more accurate so there was no real

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:36.430 
more accurate so there was no real
reason<00:03:33.980> why<00:03:34.700> quartz<00:03:35.450> watches<00:03:35.660> should<00:03:36.019> have<00:03:36.410> a

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
reason why quartz watches should have a

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.940 
reason why quartz watches should have a
future

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950 
future

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:39.400 
future
everyone<00:03:37.640> thought<00:03:37.880> basically<00:03:38.780> the<00:03:38.870> same<00:03:39.109> and

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:39.410 
everyone thought basically the same and

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:42.610 
everyone thought basically the same and
this<00:03:40.160> guy<00:03:40.430> actually<00:03:41.060> really<00:03:41.390> kind<00:03:41.690> of<00:03:41.780> yeah<00:03:42.380> it

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
this guy actually really kind of yeah it

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.550 
this guy actually really kind of yeah it
was<00:03:42.769> a<00:03:43.239> vision

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
was a vision

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.120 
was a vision
and<00:03:44.709> he<00:03:45.340> believed<00:03:45.730> in<00:03:46.120> in<00:03:46.750> the<00:03:47.050> future<00:03:47.650> or<00:03:48.010> in

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:48.130 
and he believed in in the future or in

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:49.860 
and he believed in in the future or in
the<00:03:48.220> potential<00:03:48.640> of<00:03:48.880> mechanical<00:03:49.420> timepieces

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
the potential of mechanical timepieces

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:52.800 
the potential of mechanical timepieces
so<00:03:50.080> he<00:03:50.200> has<00:03:50.350> hidden<00:03:50.560> all<00:03:50.950> the<00:03:51.940> tools<00:03:52.450> and

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
so he has hidden all the tools and

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:54.120 
so he has hidden all the tools and
everything<00:03:53.020> that<00:03:53.440> is<00:03:53.560> needed<00:03:53.860> for<00:03:53.890> the

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:54.130 
everything that is needed for the

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:56.220 
everything that is needed for the
construction<00:03:54.250> of<00:03:54.760> the<00:03:54.910> mechanical<00:03:55.480> movement

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230 
construction of the mechanical movement

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:57.870 
construction of the mechanical movement
especially<00:03:56.800> right<00:03:56.950> here<00:03:56.980> for<00:03:57.340> the<00:03:57.430> ddr

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:57.880 
especially right here for the ddr

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:59.820 
especially right here for the ddr
primero<00:03:58.240> so<00:03:58.930> it's<00:03:59.080> basically<00:03:59.440> attributed

00:03:59.820 --> 00:03:59.830 
primero so it's basically attributed

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:02.400 
primero so it's basically attributed
because<00:04:00.430> in<00:04:00.550> this<00:04:00.760> year<00:04:01.030> it<00:04:01.090> had<00:04:01.239> been<00:04:01.410> 1975

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:02.410 
because in this year it had been 1975

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:05.160 
because in this year it had been 1975
and<00:04:02.850> you<00:04:03.850> can<00:04:04.030> consider<00:04:04.390> him<00:04:04.690> really<00:04:05.050> as<00:04:05.140> a

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:05.170 
and you can consider him really as a

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:07.860 
and you can consider him really as a
kind<00:04:05.650> of<00:04:05.680> disabled<00:04:06.430> of<00:04:06.580> this<00:04:07.150> legendary
