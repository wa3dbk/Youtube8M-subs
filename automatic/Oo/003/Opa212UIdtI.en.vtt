00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.490
 hello youtube rus again to remove anyone this famous phrase used in the very 

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:43.480
 popular series of assassin's creed to the surprise of many and well-known already 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:48.060
 by others it was not invented in this game but it has more than 500 years of 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:52.890
 existence in fact several things and themes touched in these games really 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.890
 they existed with a similarity to how the game presents them in an incredible way 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:58.030
 to my opinion 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.320
 the creators only added the what if these historical facts since 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.119
 there are not many gaps in the records that can give these speculations 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.540
 that in reality they might not be so out of reality 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.080
 for example the brotherhood of killers really existed but originally they 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.280
 called the assassins alluding to their consumption of assisi and their leader to 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.450
 mill also existed only that ubisoft changed the name to avoid 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:24.909
 problems of who was who 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:28.909
 since it could well be the country also his real name was jassam pinal saba 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:31.640
 better known as 'the old man' of the mountain 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.840
 it's amazing all the historical similarities since the years 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.970
 strengths and important facts agree although obviously in the 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:44.190
 records do not say that the Templars you murdered in the game were from that 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:46.070
 they were victims of this brotherhood 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.340
 but as I said there are these historical gaps that make people hesitate 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.220
 possibility that it would be like that 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.110
 First I will talk about all these similarities and then I will talk about 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:58.310
 extensive meaning of the phrase 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.710
 ja santina Saturday also known as 'the old man' from the mountains was a 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:07.060
 religious reformer author and forerunner of the new water prediction of the 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.080
 ismaelitas misery is that he intended to replace the old aragua of the 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.140
 Fatimid Ishmaelites of Cairo is known above all for having been the 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.689
 inspiring and boss so-called that's how it is 

00:02:17.689 --> 00:02:21.469
 word that has happened to numerous languages ​​as killer sect of the 

00:02:21.469 --> 00:02:25.799
 murderers since the community that he founded and directed frequently used 

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:28.189
 political homicide as a strategy 

00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:32.200
 most of the data about jasán and his followers come from his 

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:36.249
 enemies since the documentation generated by the sect was destroyed by 

00:02:36.249 --> 00:02:40.069
 the Mongols when they razed the fortress of Alamut headquarters of it 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:44.290
 so also saber Robert was the eleventh grand master of the order of 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.120
 the Templars who fought alongside Ricardo first of England in the 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.399
 third crusade 

00:02:49.399 --> 00:02:53.299
 going on to the second part of the game is unheard of along with the family 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:58.309
 auditorium actually did exist all the data of game biographies 

00:02:58.309 --> 00:03:02.409
 at least those that I have looked for agree with the reality since they do not add data 

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:03.819
 according to the game 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:06.819
 even rodrigo borgia 

00:03:15.899 --> 00:03:20.949
 he became a father did a lot of chaos if he dies in 1503 several years 

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:24.829
 after this title ends so you can not kill it when 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:26.429
 you find 

00:03:26.429 --> 00:03:30.639
 I do not have time to go through all the characters but if they existed and the 

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:34.929
 You can find the data in the biographies of the characters in the same game from 

00:03:34.929 --> 00:03:39.249
 lorenzo de medici and caterina sforza until Machiavelli and the crazy monk and 

00:03:39.249 --> 00:03:40.959
 course leonardo da vinci 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:44.870
 in fact an interesting fact is that he was among the first to make a model 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:46.739
 of firearm 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:50.700
 so far I leave the first part and in the second address the broad meaning 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:54.290
 of the phrase among other things so you already know 

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:56.379
 so
