00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
and that's kind of that that drove me to

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:47.450

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
industry's moved along a lot in terms of

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.910 
industry's moved along a lot in terms of
you<00:01:06.119> know<00:01:06.150> how<00:01:06.420> it<00:01:06.600> deals<00:01:06.869> with<00:01:07.020> its<00:01:07.260> visual

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
you know how it deals with its visual

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.969 
you know how it deals with its visual
fidelity<00:01:08.070> and<00:01:08.520> immersion<00:01:08.729> so<00:01:09.180> like<00:01:09.960> say<00:01:10.439> you

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
fidelity and immersion so like say you

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.280 
fidelity and immersion so like say you
know<00:01:11.070> uncharted<00:01:11.790> two<00:01:12.119> was<00:01:12.420> a<00:01:12.689> game<00:01:13.020> that<00:01:13.200> i

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
know uncharted two was a game that i

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.399 
know uncharted two was a game that i
really<00:01:13.650> like<00:01:14.189> a<00:01:14.729> huge<00:01:15.150> amount<00:01:15.450> partly<00:01:16.259> because

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
really like a huge amount partly because

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.170 
really like a huge amount partly because
you<00:01:16.860> know<00:01:16.920> it's<00:01:17.220> not<00:01:17.340> that<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.700> game<00:01:17.880> itself

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
you know it's not that the game itself

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.730 
you know it's not that the game itself
said<00:01:18.450> okay<00:01:18.720> this<00:01:18.900> is<00:01:19.080> radically<00:01:19.740> different

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
said okay this is radically different

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.140 
said okay this is radically different
game<00:01:20.189> design<00:01:20.520> because<00:01:20.790> it's<00:01:20.909> sort<00:01:21.030> of<00:01:21.090> an

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
game design because it's sort of an

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.210 
game design because it's sort of an
evolution<00:01:21.659> from<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:21.960> tomb<00:01:22.170> raider<00:01:22.350> style<00:01:22.710> and

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
evolution from the tomb raider style and

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.609 
evolution from the tomb raider style and
the<00:01:23.310> cover<00:01:23.520> bates<00:01:23.759> style<00:01:24.450> again<00:01:24.540> but<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.049> the

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
the cover bates style again but the the

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.890 
the cover bates style again but the the
level<00:01:26.009> of<00:01:26.130> detail<00:01:26.189> of<00:01:26.729> fidelity<00:01:27.210> it<00:01:27.299> was<00:01:27.420> told

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
level of detail of fidelity it was told

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.109 
level of detail of fidelity it was told
it<00:01:28.229> was<00:01:28.350> told<00:01:28.619> with<00:01:28.860> and<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.579> nuance<00:01:29.880> in<00:01:30.030> the

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
you know that didn't really exist when I

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.410 
you know that didn't really exist when I
was<00:02:07.770> making<00:02:07.950> games

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
feel like there's some stuff that I

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.390 
feel like there's some stuff that I
could<00:02:23.160> bring<00:02:23.910> to<00:02:24.780> the<00:02:24.870> table<00:02:25.050> but<00:02:25.680> ya<00:02:26.069> know<00:02:26.250> so

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
been a fair amount of progress and it's

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:31.699

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
dealt with it from the perspective of

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.140 
dealt with it from the perspective of
someone<00:02:33.600> that's<00:02:33.810> been<00:02:34.020> the<00:02:34.790> audience<00:02:35.790> the

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
someone that's been the audience the

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.690 
someone that's been the audience the
game<00:02:36.510> player<00:02:36.780> versus<00:02:37.290> the<00:02:37.410> game<00:02:37.560> maker<00:02:37.800> which

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
game player versus the game maker which

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.520 
game player versus the game maker which
was<00:02:38.880> canonized<00:02:39.360> and<00:02:39.599> you<00:02:39.989> know<00:02:40.080> you<00:02:40.319> have<00:02:40.500> to

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
was canonized and you know you have to

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.890 
was canonized and you know you have to
embrace<00:02:40.890> the<00:02:41.310> medium<00:02:41.610> itself<00:02:41.700> which<00:02:42.120> is<00:02:42.300> its

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
embrace the medium itself which is its

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.050 
embrace the medium itself which is its
interactive<00:02:43.470> you<00:02:44.160> know<00:02:44.250> you<00:02:44.310> have<00:02:44.640> to<00:02:44.819> feel

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
interactive you know you have to feel

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.539 
interactive you know you have to feel
you've<00:02:45.600> got<00:02:45.900> to<00:02:45.989> do<00:02:46.110> things<00:02:46.350> that<00:02:46.560> affect<00:02:47.370> the

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:47.549 
you've got to do things that affect the

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:49.420 
you've got to do things that affect the
world<00:02:47.700> and<00:02:48.060> the<00:02:48.180> world<00:02:48.299> reacts<00:02:48.720> to<00:02:48.959> you

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
world and the world reacts to you

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.380 
world and the world reacts to you
because<00:02:50.430> if<00:02:50.580> you<00:02:50.700> don't<00:02:50.910> do<00:02:51.060> that<00:02:51.090> you<00:02:51.360> just

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
because if you don't do that you just

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.449 
because if you don't do that you just
try<00:02:51.690> to<00:02:51.750> approximate<00:02:51.989> just<00:02:52.500> a<00:02:52.620> straight<00:02:53.160> movie

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
try to approximate just a straight movie

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:54.920 
try to approximate just a straight movie
or<00:02:53.549> something<00:02:53.940> then<00:02:54.150> I<00:02:54.330> don't<00:02:54.690> think<00:02:54.840> you're

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
or something then I don't think you're

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.690 
or something then I don't think you're
doing<00:02:55.110> the<00:02:55.170> medium<00:02:55.470> justice<00:02:55.860> and<00:02:56.100> I<00:02:56.250> think

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
doing the medium justice and I think

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.820 
doing the medium justice and I think
with<00:02:56.910> the<00:02:57.150> greater<00:02:57.720> power<00:02:58.019> of<00:02:58.170> machines<00:02:58.560> and

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
with the greater power of machines and

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:00.740 
with the greater power of machines and
what<00:02:59.370> you<00:02:59.459> can<00:02:59.580> do<00:02:59.730> you<00:02:59.760> can<00:02:59.940> go<00:03:00.209> more<00:03:00.450> in<00:03:00.630> that

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
what you can do you can go more in that

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.360 
what you can do you can go more in that
direction<00:03:00.810> that<00:03:01.410> maybe<00:03:01.590> you<00:03:01.860> could<00:03:01.890> have<00:03:02.190> done

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
direction that maybe you could have done

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.490 
direction that maybe you could have done
before<00:03:02.640> so<00:03:03.090> I<00:03:03.299> had<00:03:03.569> to<00:03:03.750> do<00:03:03.959> some<00:03:04.170> things<00:03:04.380> on

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
before so I had to do some things on

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:05.900 
before so I had to do some things on
Wing<00:03:04.709> Commander<00:03:05.040> because<00:03:05.280> I<00:03:05.310> was<00:03:05.489> limited<00:03:05.880> by

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
Wing Commander because I was limited by

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.240 
Wing Commander because I was limited by
the<00:03:06.060> technology<00:03:06.620> so<00:03:07.620> I<00:03:07.650> sort<00:03:07.860> of<00:03:07.950> relied<00:03:08.220> on

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
the technology so I sort of relied on

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.880 
the technology so I sort of relied on
may<00:03:08.910> be<00:03:09.140> using<00:03:10.140> some<00:03:10.290> more<00:03:10.470> filming

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
may be using some more filming

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.009 
may be using some more filming
techniques<00:03:11.100> to<00:03:11.549> sort<00:03:11.790> of<00:03:11.850> get<00:03:12.299> an<00:03:12.450> idea<00:03:12.540> across

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019 
techniques to sort of get an idea across

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:16.130 
techniques to sort of get an idea across
whereas<00:03:13.440> I<00:03:13.620> think<00:03:13.859> in<00:03:14.160> today's<00:03:14.750> setup<00:03:15.750> I<00:03:15.900> don't

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
whereas I think in today's setup I don't

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:17.690 
whereas I think in today's setup I don't
need<00:03:16.290> to<00:03:16.410> maybe<00:03:16.620> do<00:03:16.859> as<00:03:16.980> much<00:03:17.160> and<00:03:17.340> I<00:03:17.400> can<00:03:17.549> maybe

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
need to maybe do as much and I can maybe

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.610 
need to maybe do as much and I can maybe
make<00:03:17.910> it<00:03:17.970> more<00:03:18.329> of<00:03:18.959> an<00:03:19.140> immersive<00:03:19.350> because

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
make it more of an immersive because

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.289 
make it more of an immersive because
really<00:03:19.799> I<00:03:19.920> what<00:03:20.250> I<00:03:20.280> like<00:03:20.489> that<00:03:20.790> idea<00:03:20.940> is<00:03:21.209> he

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:21.299 
really I what I like that idea is he

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:23.240 
really I what I like that idea is he
building<00:03:21.570> a<00:03:21.780> virtual<00:03:22.140> reality<00:03:22.590> that<00:03:23.130> you're

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
building a virtual reality that you're

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.759 
building a virtual reality that you're
getting<00:03:23.400> lost<00:03:23.670> in<00:03:23.940> and<00:03:24.810> that's<00:03:25.019> you<00:03:25.320> know<00:03:25.440> the

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
getting lost in and that's you know the

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:27.770 
getting lost in and that's you know the
holodeck<00:03:26.250> I<00:03:26.459> guess<00:03:26.640> would<00:03:26.850> be<00:03:26.880> you<00:03:27.120> know<00:03:27.239> da<00:03:27.420> at

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
holodeck I guess would be you know da at

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.080 
holodeck I guess would be you know da at
most<00:03:27.989> people's<00:03:28.260> idea<00:03:28.350> of<00:03:28.650> the<00:03:28.799> perfect<00:03:29.090> gaming

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
setup well I would say take every space

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.979 
setup well I would say take every space
