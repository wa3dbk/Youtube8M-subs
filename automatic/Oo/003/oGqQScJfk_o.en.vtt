00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:10.190 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:14.780 

installation<00:00:11.190> on<00:00:11.730> the<00:00:11.940> alternator<00:00:13.219> yeah<00:00:14.219> I

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
installation on the alternator yeah I

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:23.300 
installation on the alternator yeah I
used<00:00:15.299> a<00:00:16.340> 3<00:00:17.630> a<00:00:18.890> 3<00:00:19.890> foot<00:00:20.310> oh<00:00:21.529> actually<00:00:22.529> by<00:00:22.980> doing

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
used a 3 a 3 foot oh actually by doing

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.470 
used a 3 a 3 foot oh actually by doing
two<00:00:23.550> and<00:00:23.640> a<00:00:23.699> half<00:00:23.789> foot<00:00:24.060> extension<00:00:24.859> with<00:00:25.859> a

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:26.480 
two and a half foot extension with a

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.830 
two and a half foot extension with a
universal<00:00:27.480> on<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.769> end<00:00:28.920> of<00:00:29.039> it<00:00:29.189> and<00:00:29.840> actually

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
universal on the end of it and actually

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.990 
universal on the end of it and actually
use<00:00:30.960> a<00:00:30.990> half<00:00:31.289> inch<00:00:31.579> socket<00:00:33.350> to<00:00:34.350> install<00:00:34.680> those

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:35.000 
use a half inch socket to install those

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.330 
use a half inch socket to install those
bolts<00:00:36.380> hold<00:00:37.380> that<00:00:37.559> alternator<00:00:38.129> in<00:00:38.899> and<00:00:39.899> then

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:40.340 
bolts hold that alternator in and then

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:46.000 
bolts hold that alternator in and then
using<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.629> extended<00:00:42.629> 3/8<00:00:43.079> ratchet<00:00:43.350> on<00:00:44.149> the

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.010 
using the extended 3/8 ratchet on the

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:51.080 
using the extended 3/8 ratchet on the
pulley<00:00:47.059> for<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.149> tensioner<00:00:49.079> pulley<00:00:49.260> I<00:00:50.090> put

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
pulley for the tensioner pulley I put

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.810 
pulley for the tensioner pulley I put
the<00:00:51.300> I<00:00:51.960> take<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:53.180> belt<00:00:54.180> off<00:00:54.510> of<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:55.820> power

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
the I take the belt off of the power

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.229 
the I take the belt off of the power
steering<00:00:57.360> pulley<00:00:58.079> and<00:00:58.559> push<00:00:59.520> it<00:00:59.670> down<00:00:59.699> far

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
steering pulley and push it down far

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.460 
steering pulley and push it down far
enough<00:01:00.300> in<00:01:00.780> that<00:01:01.050> once<00:01:01.440> I<00:01:01.590> have<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:02.149> tensioner

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:03.470 
enough in that once I have the tensioner

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:08.750 
enough in that once I have the tensioner
is<00:01:05.840> loose<00:01:06.840> as<00:01:07.020> I<00:01:07.140> can<00:01:07.350> get<00:01:07.500> it<00:01:07.680> then<00:01:08.400> I'm<00:01:08.640> able

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
is loose as I can get it then I'm able

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.440 
is loose as I can get it then I'm able
to<00:01:09.650> bring<00:01:10.650> that<00:01:10.799> pulley<00:01:11.040> back<00:01:11.310> out<00:01:11.580> of<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.850> the

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
to bring that pulley back out of the the

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.910 
to bring that pulley back out of the the
belt<00:01:12.659> back<00:01:12.869> up<00:01:13.080> over<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:15.259> the<00:01:16.259> pulley<00:01:16.530> for<00:01:16.830> the

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
belt back up over the the pulley for the

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.450 
belt back up over the the pulley for the
power<00:01:17.850> steering<00:01:18.150> pump<00:01:18.270> once<00:01:18.659> I've<00:01:18.840> got<00:01:19.020> the

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 
power steering pump once I've got the

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.980 
power steering pump once I've got the
belt<00:01:20.460> around<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.450> pulley<00:01:21.659> for<00:01:21.930> the

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
belt around the the pulley for the

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:31.130 
belt around the the pulley for the
alternator<00:01:22.439> and<00:01:23.570> the<00:01:24.740> AC<00:01:26.299> so<00:01:29.659> don't<00:01:30.659> forget<00:01:30.750> to

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
alternator and the AC so don't forget to

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.560 
alternator and the AC so don't forget to
put<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.150> cutter<00:01:33.150> key<00:01:33.360> back<00:01:33.600> in<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:35.390> in<00:01:36.390> the

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
put the cutter key back in the in the

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.240 
put the cutter key back in the in the
bolt<00:01:36.780> with<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.549> new<00:01:38.549> tie<00:01:38.759> rod<00:01:38.970> end<00:01:39.210> this<00:01:39.360> and

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
sure that's height with the car key back

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:47.870 
sure that's height with the car key back
in<00:01:44.210> put<00:01:45.210> your<00:01:45.240> bolt<00:01:45.540> put<00:01:46.020> your<00:01:46.430> tire<00:01:47.430> back<00:01:47.640> on

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
in put your bolt put your tire back on

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:54.590 
in put your bolt put your tire back on
and<00:01:50.420> do<00:01:51.420> a<00:01:52.640> quick<00:01:53.640> visual<00:01:53.850> make<00:01:54.240> sure<00:01:54.360> you<00:01:54.450> got

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
what happens because the alternators

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.780 
what happens because the alternators
back<00:02:38.250> there<00:02:38.550> in<00:02:39.540> a<00:02:39.690> bad<00:02:39.960> spot<00:02:40.410> down<00:02:40.830> below<00:02:41.220> and
