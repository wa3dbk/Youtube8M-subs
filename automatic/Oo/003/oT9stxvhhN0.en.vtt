00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.300 
shots and shooting people and whereas in
black<00:01:30.479> ops<00:01:30.689> I<00:01:30.869> can<00:01:31.020> just<00:01:31.170> you<00:01:31.320> know<00:01:31.350> play<00:01:31.770> run

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
black ops I can just you know play run

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.800 
black ops I can just you know play run
around<00:01:32.579> shoot<00:01:32.850> people<00:01:33.180> and<00:01:33.270> it's<00:01:33.479> actually

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
around shoot people and it's actually

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.420 
around shoot people and it's actually
easier<00:01:34.229> for<00:01:34.259> me<00:01:34.439> because<00:01:34.560> I'm<00:01:34.890> more<00:01:35.100> used<00:01:35.280> to

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
easier for me because I'm more used to

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.100 
easier for me because I'm more used to
it<00:01:35.520> so<00:01:35.820> when<00:01:36.270> I'm<00:01:36.390> playing<00:01:36.479> free-for-all<00:01:36.990> I

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
it so when I'm playing free-for-all I

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.810 
it so when I'm playing free-for-all I
don't<00:01:37.259> have<00:01:37.380> anyone<00:01:37.619> to<00:01:37.740> talk<00:01:37.920> to<00:01:37.979> I<00:01:38.400> play

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
don't have anyone to talk to I play

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.060 
don't have anyone to talk to I play
alone<00:01:39.090> I'm<00:01:39.990> usually<00:01:40.290> live<00:01:40.619> streaming<00:01:40.920> when

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
alone I'm usually live streaming when

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.920 
alone I'm usually live streaming when
I'm<00:01:41.159> playing<00:01:41.280> but<00:01:41.610> I'm<00:01:42.000> for<00:01:42.509> the<00:01:42.570> most<00:01:42.750> part

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
I'm playing but I'm for the most part

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.210 
I'm playing but I'm for the most part
playing<00:01:43.229> alone<00:01:43.500> I<00:01:43.530> don't<00:01:43.770> have<00:01:43.860> people<00:01:44.040> to

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
playing alone I don't have people to

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.880 
playing alone I don't have people to
talk<00:01:44.250> to<00:01:44.640> so<00:01:44.850> I<00:01:45.030> can<00:01:45.299> focus<00:01:45.810> on<00:01:46.229> trying<00:01:46.680> my

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
talk to so I can focus on trying my

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.310 
talk to so I can focus on trying my
brains<00:01:47.159> out<00:01:47.310> focus<00:01:47.729> on<00:01:47.909> hitting<00:01:48.659> shots<00:01:48.990> and

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
brains out focus on hitting shots and

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.109 
brains out focus on hitting shots and
whatnot<00:01:49.649> so<00:01:49.680> I<00:01:50.250> was<00:01:50.520> actually<00:01:50.670> having<00:01:50.909> a<00:01:51.090> lot

I can concentrate a little better but
yeah<00:02:16.319> so<00:02:16.590> anyways<00:02:17.310> using<00:02:18.120> the<00:02:18.180> l<00:02:18.269> 118<00:02:18.510> a<00:02:18.750> today

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:19.019 
yeah so anyways using the l 118 a today

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:21.020 
yeah so anyways using the l 118 a today
some<00:02:19.470> people<00:02:19.500> ask<00:02:19.920> me<00:02:20.010> why<00:02:20.280> I<00:02:20.310> don't<00:02:20.700> use<00:02:20.879> the

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
some people ask me why I don't use the

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.420 
some people ask me why I don't use the
MSR<00:02:21.480> and<00:02:21.720> the<00:02:22.440> reason<00:02:22.769> for<00:02:22.800> that<00:02:22.980> is<00:02:23.220> just

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
MSR and the reason for that is just

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.400 
MSR and the reason for that is just
because<00:02:23.519> I<00:02:23.670> dislike<00:02:24.120> the<00:02:24.269> MSR<00:02:24.629> I<00:02:24.870> don't<00:02:25.349> think

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
because I dislike the MSR I don't think

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.470 
because I dislike the MSR I don't think
it's<00:02:25.739> that<00:02:25.830> consistent<00:02:26.489> I<00:02:26.580> can't<00:02:26.849> drag<00:02:27.150> scope

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
it's that consistent I can't drag scope

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.320 
it's that consistent I can't drag scope
with<00:02:27.629> it<00:02:27.780> like<00:02:27.930> I<00:02:28.050> do<00:02:28.110> with<00:02:28.379> the<00:02:28.500> l<00:02:28.590> 118<00:02:28.830> a<00:02:29.190> and<00:02:29.459> I

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
with it like I do with the l 118 a and I

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.030 
with it like I do with the l 118 a and I
don't<00:02:30.660> know<00:02:30.720> the<00:02:30.930> MSR<00:02:31.260> is<00:02:31.349> a<00:02:31.410> sexier<00:02:31.769> sniper

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
don't know the MSR is a sexier sniper

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.180 
don't know the MSR is a sexier sniper
rifle<00:02:32.459> makes<00:02:32.910> a<00:02:33.030> better<00:02:33.180> sound<00:02:33.480> but<00:02:34.010> it's<00:02:35.010> not

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
rifle makes a better sound but it's not

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.070 
rifle makes a better sound but it's not
as<00:02:35.340> good<00:02:35.519> in<00:02:36.060> my<00:02:36.239> mind<00:02:36.480> is<00:02:36.630> not<00:02:36.750> as<00:02:36.900> accurate

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
as good in my mind is not as accurate

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.720 
as good in my mind is not as accurate
and<00:02:37.349> I<00:02:37.440> get<00:02:37.620> more<00:02:37.860> hit<00:02:38.069> marketers<00:02:38.489> with<00:02:38.640> the

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
and I get more hit marketers with the

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.750 
and I get more hit marketers with the
MSR<00:02:39.120> so<00:02:39.450> I<00:02:39.720> like<00:02:40.140> using<00:02:40.319> the<00:02:40.470> l<00:02:40.620> 118<00:02:40.830> a<00:02:41.160> so

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
MSR so I like using the l 118 a so

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.449 
MSR so I like using the l 118 a so
that's<00:02:42.599> that<00:02:43.019> but<00:02:43.379> today<00:02:43.920> going<00:02:44.220> to<00:02:44.370> be

believe<00:05:55.800> it<00:05:55.950> is<00:05:55.980> pretty<00:05:56.520> balanced<00:05:56.940> in<00:05:57.060> the

00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:57.240 
believe it is pretty balanced in the

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:59.420 
believe it is pretty balanced in the
fact<00:05:57.480> that<00:05:57.570> you<00:05:58.350> do<00:05:58.500> have<00:05:58.650> to<00:05:58.830> actively<00:05:59.160> seek

00:05:59.420 --> 00:05:59.430 
fact that you do have to actively seek

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:01.580 
fact that you do have to actively seek
out<00:05:59.580> people<00:05:59.790> to<00:06:00.030> shoot<00:06:00.270> seek<00:06:00.840> out<00:06:01.020> enemies<00:06:01.410> to

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:01.590 
out people to shoot seek out enemies to

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:04.400 
out people to shoot seek out enemies to
