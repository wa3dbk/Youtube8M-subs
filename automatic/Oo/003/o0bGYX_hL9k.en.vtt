00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.550
 if she spoke ba 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.160
 hello people users due to one more 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.719
 pop flight in today's polygon pocket 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.660
 We'll do an analysis of the movie. 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.730
 Spectacular Spiderman 2 Threat of 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.990
 elektro then come on 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.300
 good I will warn you here that this 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.189
 criticism has some movie spoilers 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.019
 The film starts exactly from the first 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.420
 stopped Peter Clarke is once again 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.070
 played by actor Andrew Garfield 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.829
 haunted with the ghost of the captain 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.930
 space on his deathbed made Peter 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.790
 promise would stay away with stacey that 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.800
 would protect soon after a flashback 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.440
 telling a little more about his father's past 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.789
 pac in the movie opens us presenting a 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.250
 more colorful spider man more 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.079
 fun than the one featured in the movie 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.629
 visual acuity of the 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.430
 character is a super positive point 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.320
 I think since the first photo came out 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.750
 né this new peter parker uniform 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.570
 fans loved it because it was not even a memory 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.879
 very much the look of the character of hqs 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:06.270
 but I can not say the same of the 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.260
 villains that already in the 3 had already caused a 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.049
 certain strangeness 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.060
 Come on, let's go for elektro parts. 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.830
 typical jumbled nerd who works 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.720
 as an electrical engineer in the bodies 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.640
 but the strange ones that I said feel 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.280
 with the brothers does not come only from the package 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:23.250
 visual that was well inspired by the 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.470
 ultimate electron but the characterization 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.210
 It bothers me a lot and does not 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.090
 because of the fox team that was super 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.530
 competent as always the role I think 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.060
 that the fault of this extremely 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.780
 was because of the text of the 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.939
 note 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.189
 The motivation of the ridiculous character you 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.810
 ends up forgetting why he wants to 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.759
 destroy the city I wanted to kill the 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.350
 spider man and comes to believe that he 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.750
 does I think because he is a villain are 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.710
 things that villains do are born more 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.810
 with nature 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.490
 I actually feel the chest Maxwell 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.009
 is in telling a story wrote there 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.540
 is addressing teenage romances 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.850
 the director was very famous for the film 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.680
 500 days with her and it is in this aspect that 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.469
 the film takes better the relationship between the 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.790
 ppa with stacey is very well crafted 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.770
 the chemistry between the actors between 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.720
 garfield and emma stone works very well 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.600
 if there are sensitivities 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.979
 beauties of our 60s when the focus leaves the 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.570
 spider goes to the couple it seems 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:15.210
 We are seeing another movie and not 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:17.190
 adventures of maranhão which may end 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:19.560
 I already had some people because the beginning 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.540
 frenetic sinbi with action scenes as well 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.880
 elaborate and everything but then the rhythm 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.990
 fell a little and only came back at the end of 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.770
 movie with the final battle with the 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:28.680
 electric 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:30.510
 indeed they are great the midfielder finally has 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.370
 weight things in the man's movies 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.900
 spider sam raimi had not he been a 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.940
 Rubber doll that gets skipping 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.890
 whole movie is not in that movie and 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.510
 really have weight be achieved 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.830
 believe that there is a spider man 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.810
 swinging among the buildings 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.520
 but focusing again in the direction of the film 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.530
 the impression that remains is that michael o 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:48.540
 director works much better facet 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.760
 character's peter parker while 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.600
 blood is better when it comes to doing 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.459
 hi the spider 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.950
 millions more appear a thing of the 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:57.810
 I was afraid that it 's not because I 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:00.600
 was afraid that the excess of 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.860
 631 solemn but the threat of the film 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.709
 really the elektro 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:07.230
 the river makes two very short updates 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:09.060
 a good beginning of the film and until the end 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.830
 which serves more as a hook for the 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.110
 sequence that incidentally I find a waste 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.850
 of a great actor who is the people already Matt and 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:17.519
 we also have the origin of green blood 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:20.100
 This time the defendant is not going to be the 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:21.690
 normal of face but not only 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.430
 is there to be responsible for 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.120
 dramatic final sequence taken from the 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.430
 comic books 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.470
 who reads the doctor and his green jacket 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.550
 used by the insistence knows very well of the 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.950
 What I'm talking about 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:34.830
 summing up the movie is not perfect but 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:36.780
 is far from bad if you compare 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:39.510
 with the trilogy of blood and only loses to 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.530
 The second film, however, 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.390
 first and third 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.850
 the film also come out by the falling rate 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:46.830
 in half but this does not compromise 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:48.870
 Look this team managed to thrill things. 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:50.549
 that made you fall into male sweat have the 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:52.860
 eyes so he managed to make the 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:55.049
 comic link that I as a fan of 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:56.940
 Spider has managed to identify quite 

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:59.190
 then this connection will consent to the 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:01.680
 comic by the final sequence that is 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:03.390
 incredible is amazing by the sequences of 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:06.269
 action that are very well done or people 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:07.739
 complaining there's the speed that 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:09.630
 property of violent honey can 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:12.170
 It's also super fast so the staff 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:13.880
 Talking it is a very fast goal. 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:15.860
 who do not know the sea ​​and do not understand 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:18.290
 about the spider man but for all this 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:20.450
 I think I give eight notes to the film alone. 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:21.919
 It's not 10 because because I said the movie 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:24.020
 is not perfect has a little mistake I 

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:25.790
 I have it there but it's a great movie. 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:27.710
 taking second place is your name 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:29.480
 that impacted me a lot at the time 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:31.160
 This is the best Spider-Man movie . 

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:33.740
 Here you are then if you watched 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:35.480
 vast film I gave all 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:37.040
 I only delivered the films 

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:38.660
 lightweight goalkeepers 

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:40.940
 the most important I did not deliver then 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:42.889
 go there and have fun with the spectacular 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:44.630
 man spider 2 threat of electrons 

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:46.880
 finally this audience the cut will arrive in the 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:48.470
 end and if you liked this type of 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:50.150
