00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:17.580
 good evening london 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.189
 let's talk about diet fats the vote does not 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.470
 always a lot of fear will be given by them 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.810
 name or the fact that they are all marco 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:28.020
 more caloric nutrient in fact a gram 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.509
 fat has on average 90 calories 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:34.489
 the pd have some characteristics 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:37.410
 ethnicities are primarily molecules 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:39.059
 dehydrate their chemical structure e 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.239
 for those far from that of carbohydrates 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.320
 in which they found two hydrogen atoms 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:45.750
 every atom of oxygen 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.770
 here the relationship is much more unbalanced 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.630
 Hydrogen atoms of hydrogen are structures 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:54.870
 their composition is hydrophobic 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:57.870
 given by three hydrocarbon chains that 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.870
 bound to a molecule of glycerol la 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.540
 thus structure a polar head but one 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.159
 tail anchor which makes them soluble 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.720
 in water 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:08.310
 in short , fats are definitely a 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.299
 complex topic but a lot 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:14.509
 their function is interesting 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:17.460
 predominantly the energy one 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:20.280
 we think a 70 kg man has 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.570
 an average of 100,000 calories stored 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.400
 as fat reserves 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.610
 this allows him to be able to live 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.890
 several months without eating but a moment 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.750
 pointed out that the fat we accumulate is 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.450
 however surrounded by a minimum of 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:37.619
 of water its caloric value passes 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:39.450
 from 9 kg calories per gram to seven have 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.270
 but also a plastic function 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:45.330
 we think of cell membranes at 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.950
 glial cells the pd also serve for 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:49.960
 adjust hormone production 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:53.470
 steroids and many other functions 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:56.020
 his body is not all fats 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:58.420
 equal depending on how many double bonds 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:01.690
 of carbon are free they share the 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.979
 skip the tastes and polyunsaturated money too 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:05.710
 but within the same groups 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:08.289
 we find profound differences for 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:10.899
 example saturated fats can be 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:14.140
 the short medium long chain i police a 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:16.180
 turi can be omega 3 and omega 6 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:19.120
 in short, the somewhat complex subject 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:21.700
 to start simplifying we can 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.350
 say that multiple legal scholars are free and 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.650
 the more the fatty acid is biologically 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:29.310
 active because free to bind others 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:32.380
 substances in our body 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:34.090
 to conclude the goal of the diet 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:36.790
 could be to improve the 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.300
 beta oxidation the metabolism of 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.700
 lipids 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.830
 to do so the solution would be 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.200
 simple enough to increase 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:45.250
 fat consumption at the expense of 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.860
 that of carbohydrates 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:50.260
 however at the cellular level there is one 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:53.350
 competition between glucose use 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:55.660
 of fatty acids plus the body south and 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:58.720
 seconds and greener the activity with the 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:02.799
 glucose the amount so correct 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:06.730
 fat protein carbohydrates goes lawn 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:08.829
 based on biochemical envy based 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:11.560
 to work and sport activities neither 

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:13.420
 every person does in the next videos 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.510
 articles we will learn to make their own
