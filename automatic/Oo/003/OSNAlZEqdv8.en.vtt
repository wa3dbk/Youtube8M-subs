if<00:00:57.510> you're<00:00:57.629> playing<00:00:57.870> cash<00:00:58.109> games<00:00:58.410> against<00:00:58.770> the

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
if you're playing cash games against the

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.250 
if you're playing cash games against the
same<00:00:59.129> people<00:00:59.579> all<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.090> time<00:01:00.120> then<00:01:00.750> balance<00:01:01.140> is

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
same people all the time then balance is

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.200 
same people all the time then balance is
super<00:01:01.859> crucial<00:01:02.039> because<00:01:02.699> you<00:01:02.789> have<00:01:02.969> to<00:01:03.120> be

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
super crucial because you have to be

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.789 
super crucial because you have to be
balanced<00:01:03.480> longer<00:01:03.840> in<00:01:04.080> tournaments<00:01:04.650> you're

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
balanced longer in tournaments you're

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.980 
balanced longer in tournaments you're
never<00:01:04.979> gonna<00:01:05.129> face<00:01:05.460> long<00:01:06.180> term<00:01:06.420> situations

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
never gonna face long term situations

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.560 
never gonna face long term situations
enough<00:01:07.290> where<00:01:07.830> balance<00:01:08.729> should<00:01:08.909> trump<00:01:09.210> being

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
enough where balance should trump being

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.450 
enough where balance should trump being
adaptive<00:01:09.990> and<00:01:10.110> exploitive<00:01:10.680> so<00:01:11.220> what<00:01:11.369> you

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
adaptive and exploitive so what you

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.950 
adaptive and exploitive so what you
should<00:01:11.520> be<00:01:11.790> doing<00:01:12.060> is<00:01:12.180> looking<00:01:12.360> to<00:01:12.510> exploit

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
should be doing is looking to exploit

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.870 
should be doing is looking to exploit
what<00:01:13.200> people<00:01:13.409> think<00:01:13.619> of<00:01:13.830> you<00:01:14.010> and<00:01:14.189> so<00:01:14.670> you

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
what people think of you and so you

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.399 
what people think of you and so you
don't<00:01:15.000> have<00:01:15.090> to<00:01:15.330> be<00:01:15.420> balanced<00:01:15.689> so<00:01:15.720> for<00:01:16.020> example

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
don't have to be balanced so for example

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.380 
don't have to be balanced so for example
a<00:01:16.439> simple<00:01:16.619> example<00:01:17.070> if<00:01:17.520> people<00:01:18.000> think<00:01:18.150> when<00:01:18.360> I

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
a simple example if people think when I

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.710 
a simple example if people think when I
bet<00:01:18.600> really<00:01:18.780> really<00:01:19.080> big<00:01:19.259> that<00:01:20.159> I<00:01:20.790> have<00:01:21.540> the

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
bet really really big that I have the

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.990 
bet really really big that I have the
nuts<00:01:21.930> then<00:01:22.920> that<00:01:23.549> would<00:01:23.670> be<00:01:23.759> a<00:01:23.790> good

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
nuts then that would be a good

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.520 
nuts then that would be a good
opportunity<00:01:24.270> to<00:01:24.659> bet<00:01:24.960> really<00:01:25.170> really<00:01:25.350> big

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
opportunity to bet really really big

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.410 
opportunity to bet really really big
when<00:01:25.680> I'm<00:01:25.770> bluffing<00:01:26.189> obviously<00:01:27.060> if<00:01:27.150> I<00:01:27.240> did

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
when I'm bluffing obviously if I did

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.120 
when I'm bluffing obviously if I did
that<00:01:27.659> in<00:01:27.869> a<00:01:27.930> cash<00:01:28.110> game<00:01:28.350> over<00:01:28.619> a<00:01:28.650> long<00:01:28.799> period

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
that in a cash game over a long period

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.039 
that in a cash game over a long period
of<00:01:29.159> time<00:01:29.369> you<00:01:30.090> know<00:01:30.180> people<00:01:30.420> pick<00:01:30.600> up<00:01:30.750> on<00:01:30.900> that

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
of time you know people pick up on that

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.440 
of time you know people pick up on that
right<00:01:31.530> but<00:01:32.130> in<00:01:32.280> a<00:01:32.369> small<00:01:32.700> vacuum<00:01:33.030> of<00:01:33.390> a

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.270 
right but in a small vacuum of a
tournament<00:01:33.990> you'd<00:01:34.350> have<00:01:34.530> to<00:01:34.650> exploit<00:01:35.040> what

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
tournament you'd have to exploit what

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.980 
tournament you'd have to exploit what
people<00:01:35.520> think<00:01:35.610> of<00:01:35.729> you<00:01:35.880> then<00:01:36.240> in<00:01:36.540> that<00:01:36.780> moment

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
people think of you then in that moment

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.660

really<00:01:42.960> so<00:01:43.619> it's<00:01:43.890> important<00:01:44.340> to<00:01:44.659> exploit<00:01:45.659> when

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
really so it's important to exploit when

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
share this advice I bought of this suite

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:54.380 
share this advice I bought of this suite
because<00:01:53.520> I<00:01:53.670> was<00:01:53.759> playing<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:54.119> Limit<00:01:54.360> Hold'em

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
because I was playing the Limit Hold'em

because I was playing the Limit Hold'em
event<00:01:54.869> and<00:01:55.290> I<00:01:55.350> think<00:01:55.380> I<00:01:55.560> see<00:01:55.710> a<00:01:55.740> lot<00:01:55.860> people

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
event and I think I see a lot people

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.980 
event and I think I see a lot people
make<00:01:56.189> a<00:01:56.219> mistake<00:01:56.310> there<00:01:56.850> where<00:01:57.060> they<00:01:57.630> always

make a mistake there where they always

people<00:02:25.100> see<00:02:25.430> you<00:02:25.700> know<00:02:25.790> a<00:02:25.820> flop<00:02:26.150> if<00:02:26.330> you<00:02:26.480> hit

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
the flop great if not don't so the

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.250 
the flop great if not don't so the
theory<00:02:28.880> behind<00:02:29.000> that<00:02:29.210> is<00:02:29.300> well<00:02:29.570> you've

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
theory behind that is well you've

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.560 
theory behind that is well you've
narrowed<00:02:30.530> your<00:02:30.710> range<00:02:30.950> down<00:02:31.130> so<00:02:31.610> what<00:02:31.850> they

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:32.570 
narrowed your range down so what they

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:34.000 
narrowed your range down so what they
don't<00:02:32.720> know<00:02:32.810> exactly<00:02:32.960> what<00:02:33.500> you<00:02:33.650> have<00:02:33.800> they

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
don't know exactly what you have they

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:35.680 
don't know exactly what you have they
know<00:02:34.160> that<00:02:34.340> it<00:02:34.460> might<00:02:34.610> be<00:02:34.790> nine<00:02:35.240> ten<00:02:35.450> suited

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690

all those types of hands but they don't

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.350 
all those types of hands but they don't

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
have you pegged your exact hands so it's

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.449 
have you pegged your exact hands so it's
