 prepares to become the champions league 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:12.769

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:15.740
 Ajax 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:17.720
 Tuesday evening against Barcelona one 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.310
 and the first chance of the match is 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.650
 for barcelona 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:23.150
 Kim Pia early in the game after 6 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.400
 minutes but the rescue of in that big one 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.840
 houses is beautiful 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.880
 this match is played in the 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.949
 under the you fleek 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.270
 a new tournament associated with the 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:34.460
 champions league ajax and barcelona 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:36.649
 sit in the group with ac milan the cell 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:39.050
 thick and ajax is the lead 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:42.320
 comes from sheraldo becker 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:44.540
 and the goal of each apple to atze 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:48.820
 Moreover, an error of goalkeeper dispose 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.820
 to it you see in the repetition 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.820
 here sheraldo becker quincy menen goes 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.190
 to the first pole to allow to the 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:03.530
 ball loose and battery last 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.530
 is thoughtful and pushes the ball into the goal 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.640
 and so a good start for ajax in this 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.229
 new tournament 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.570
 the end played two years ago 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.399
 times I also go against barcelona while you 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:20.430
 here sees the ball from pole as quincy 

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:22.409
 many then ajax won on the basis of 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.750
 Viktor Fischer Johan Cruijff Wim Jonk 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.750
 attentive spectator 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.640
 also Marc Overmars and Edwin van der Sar 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.229
 were present and are seeing another 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.229
 good rescue from in those big houses 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.729
 just like carl es pujols 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.190
 defending the injured center from 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:41.280
 the first of barcelona 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:43.860
 this is just before rest india mr earlier 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.539
 but now he heads the ball in the back 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:49.170
 large houses and it is in a hurry 

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:51.030
 a completely free the central 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.159
 defender 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.069
 and large houses still have the 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.899
 against passes 

00:01:56.069 --> 00:02:00.030
 Ajax was the best team in the first 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:02.100
 half barcelona is that in the second 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.020
 half here it is also pretty fast two 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:08.329
 one for the catalans 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.329
 mounir el haddadi scored the goal 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.720
 the action is beautiful eyes border and van 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.720
 traore 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:22.770
 quickly and subtly beyond 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:25.470
 another traore cross 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:27.000
 we picked up by real badger real badger with 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.310
 the shot the rescue of big houses 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.710
 but there is el haddadi 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.710
 mounir el haddadi tapping the ball inside 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.010
 3 one for barcelona and then the 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.720
 match was really played as 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.709
 so with the shot and the rescue of 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.310
 big houses 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:46.200
 is not quite another goal falls into it 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:50.130
 the 83rd minute 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.750
 the action of reverse and the cross 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:54.000
 that is worked in eventually 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:57.350
 by glasses 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.350
 It is in the field for 8 minutes 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:02.430
 it seems offside but here is good 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:05.280
 to see that it is not offside 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:07.200
 boss of camp iens 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:10.140
 and so I want it in that big house 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.700
 get another chance ajax 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.350
 Branco of the trees is in the plow 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.530
 come in the second half and he can 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:18.600
 taking this free kick from the tree curls 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:22.739
 into the far corner and through the hands of 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:24.959
 contura and the bar goes the ball 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:27.690
 in the end like that and it stays that way 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:29.760
 match at 4 one for barcelona ajax 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:32.640
 loses the first match in the 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.959
 under the you fleek 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.780
 the next game will be played 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:39.440
 be in Amsterdam then ac milan is the 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.440
 opponent 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.670
 think we are doing very well with phases 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.489
 have played against this 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:54.359
 a very strong team and good ones 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:56.939
 have chosen moments 

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:58.829
 yes to get too fat on their elle just that 

00:03:56.939 --> 00:04:00.930
 has taken a lot of power here and 

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:07.409
 what it was in the tactical choices 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:09.269
 also sometimes yes not good enough 

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:12.299
 thoughtful but that is also because they are the 

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:14.790
 make optimum use of spaces and make them large 

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:18.090
 so that was a huge challenge 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:20.160
 because I think we went into the initial phase 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:22.349
 did bother on it but i think 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.910
 that we actually up to a3 against that 

00:04:22.349 --> 00:04:26.940
 actually want to control the 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:28.289
 match and yes he is partly without that 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:30.870
 against a goal at such a moment 

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:33.030
 I also had the same opportunities 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:35.400
 know i can i can't even count them 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:37.740
 men than large number of holes and if you 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.690
 then also see that we have possibilities 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:41.520
 had to come to a chance also one 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:43.620
 large number did and were then in the 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:46.470
 technical skills 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.830
 another one goes wrong well and that is on this 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:49.440
 level 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:51.419
 yes then you can get one and you get one 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:53.250
 number of chances and then you have something with it 

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:55.320
 doing loses it was annoying but how 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:57.449
 look back on this evening 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:58.860
 yes very educational because is natural 

00:04:57.449 --> 00:04:59.789
 a level that you actually in the Netherlands 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:02.220
 does not come across 

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:03.690
 And yes for me personally I have here 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:05.490
 quite a bit 

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:06.630
 yes many good things from channels that I like 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:07.650
 can now take to the next 

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:09.900
 contest 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:11.550
 we can't make it beautiful or 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.870
 if you can play like this under this one 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:14.789
 circumstances 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:17.639
 yes then then it all seems so 

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:21.000
 very very very very really already 

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:24.539
 so this is also what they want to be yes those 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:28.740
 extra to them that city ​​that is going to come for 

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:30.240
 some yes a bit easier too 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:31.710
 to make 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:33.060
 Johan Cruijff seem to be resting I have 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:36.180
 enjoyed it 

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:38.220
 well he's at least something 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:39.930
 still conjures a Agelink hedge to face 

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:42.960
 right now i'm very happy that 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:45.419
 he enjoyed a book so we enjoyed 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:46.860
 two I would have liked to go the 2nd half and 

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:49.520
 enjoyed arms 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:49.520
 was not allowed to be
