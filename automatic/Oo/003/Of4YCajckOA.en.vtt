bigger but it's not it's just embedded
with<00:01:44.460> beats<00:01:44.790> audio<00:01:45.740> so<00:01:46.740> you<00:01:47.549> know<00:01:47.670> that<00:01:48.509> was

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
with beats audio so you know that was

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.810 
with beats audio so you know that was
that<00:01:48.869> was<00:01:49.079> uh<00:01:49.140> that<00:01:49.649> was<00:01:49.829> a<00:01:49.979> little<00:01:50.100> mix<00:01:50.549> up

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
that was uh that was a little mix up

there but there you go there you go 4.7

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.740 
there but there you go there you go 4.7
inches<00:01:56.210> resolutions<00:01:57.619> awesome<00:01:58.619> well<00:01:58.950> you<00:01:59.219> got

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
inches resolutions awesome well you got

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:05.899 
inches resolutions awesome well you got
1282<00:02:01.040> 720p<00:02:02.090> resolution<00:02:04.009> um<00:02:05.009> you<00:02:05.759> have<00:02:05.850> a

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
1282 720p resolution um you have a

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.869 
1282 720p resolution um you have a
quad-core<00:02:06.270> processor<00:02:07.259> which<00:02:08.160> is<00:02:08.340> awesome

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
quad-core processor which is awesome

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:12.050 
quad-core processor which is awesome
basically<00:02:09.750> you<00:02:09.810> have<00:02:09.899> 1.5<00:02:11.060> gigahertz

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
basically you have 1.5 gigahertz

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.530 
basically you have 1.5 gigahertz
dual-core

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
dual-core

processor Snapdragon s4 more than
gigabytes<00:02:17.079> of<00:02:17.200> RAM<00:02:17.409> I<00:02:17.680> guess<00:02:17.829> they're<00:02:17.980> being

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
gigabytes of RAM I guess they're being

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:23.160 
gigabytes of RAM I guess they're being
built<00:02:18.640> all<00:02:18.790> the<00:02:18.909> same<00:02:19.180> um<00:02:21.719> method<00:02:22.719> you<00:02:22.900> know<00:02:23.019> as

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
built all the same um method you know as

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.349 
built all the same um method you know as
I<00:02:23.319> said<00:02:23.349> it's<00:02:24.189> kind<00:02:24.370> of<00:02:24.459> a<00:02:24.579> ceramic<00:02:25.120> kind<00:02:25.299> of

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:25.359 
I said it's kind of a ceramic kind of

00:02:25.359 --> 00:02:27.869 
I said it's kind of a ceramic kind of
