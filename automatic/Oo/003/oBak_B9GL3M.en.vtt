00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:22.759
 hello good morning good evening good 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:25.279
 good morning afternoons I am vampire 

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:28.430
 green and I come with this other video 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:30.019
 tutorial after my return with the 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:34.420
 explanation of what has been the 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:37.650
 hack and how are we going to know 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:40.830
 that we need every here 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:46.070
 it is here allows to develop certain 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:48.900
 skills of some characters 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:51.870
 mainly to those who most 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:55.360
 It serves to develop the hack and it is to those who 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:58.450
 they mark you in what is being provided 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:00.460
 you have to look for them for now we'll see 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:02.140
 that is already is still and until perona 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:05.130
 previously before the update 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:09.250
 I also came to light 

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:10.590
 then what are we going to do that we have to 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:14.789
 do 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:18.210
 we have to have at least two barry 

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:21.569
 millions and about two million is the 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:24.299
 participation is worth 100 thousand we have 

00:01:21.569 --> 00:01:28.799
 right to save what has been 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:32.000
 those of 120 in total would be those of six 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.000
 days if I'm not wrong 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:38.720
 to be able to save 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:42.799
 then we just click here and go 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:45.990
 advancing from map to map we have three 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:50.579
 guys leave here what can we 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:55.040
 I'm going to dismantle you observation and 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:57.390
 conqueror yellow green red 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:00.450
 then first let's get it and 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:03.200
 then we continue and I explain the 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.200
 next part 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.710
 now it does not let me advance 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:19.099
 this is practically luck 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:22.400
 remember that they have not only 20 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:25.909
 opportunities I usually spend 30 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:30.860
 of gold to be sure of what 

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:33.590
 it's been the 5 maps always when 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:36.079
 you put gold you spend it I think I do not know if 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.849
 there is a rule there but it is natural that 

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:40.849
 You can pass it because it has already touched me 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:43.220
 that continues to fail at level 8 in the 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:48.310
 Level 7 and Level 6 when 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:50.900
 I invest gold then we continue 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:54.110
 raising to see if I get something from 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.640
 concrete that is the most necessary thing is here 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:58.989
 in the conqueror I have one 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.989
 opportunity , nothing came out 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:04.459
 then to improve the skills 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:06.620
 that they are being at observation time 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:10.340
 and conqueror we have to select 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:13.069
 either the character we want to improve 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:18.370
 just as we want to move forward have the 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:18.370
 third advance I for example here I have 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.500
 what is my light and what is not 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.960
 It seems 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:29.630
 we are normally going to give 

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:33.290
 click on maximum maximum and we give you then 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:38.310
 click here then 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:41.310
 increases what is coming here from 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.310
 armament 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.400
 I do not know if they put it upside down but if not 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:49.019
 I was going 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:52.079
 you're supposed to leave normally 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:54.810
 increases in the hp that went down here and the 

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:58.260
 of observation increased what comes 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:01.680
 being what is being the docv that 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:05.120
 allows you to dodge physical attacks or 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.120
 You can even dodge rag 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:12.030
 well I 'm giving it to me for now 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:19.560
 what is the moment 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:23.370
 to start preparing a future , a 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:25.220
 strategy that I am applying is that 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:28.280
 for now 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:30.440
 while I do not have some characters 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:32.900
 the call and observation always 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:39.160
 is going to come out a good then I what 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:39.160
 I did it is improve for example to me calla 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:47.249
 better to kuma than possess a level 9 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:49.499
 I also put him here to be them 

00:04:47.249 --> 00:04:52.740
 preparing what works for me is that they 

00:04:49.499 --> 00:04:55.110
 increases a good hp 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:57.810
 here you dial 9000 but remember that 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:05:00.630
 with the gems with the percentages either 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:05.479
 of your pets this increases a lot 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:09.419
 it can be ones that are another 4000 hp 

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:12.000
 then it serves quite to increase the hp and 

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:14.039
 with this you can match what is coming 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.760
 being your believe so you have the hp 

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:20.110
 required 

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:22.950
 well we have here once you have 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:22.950
 finished 

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:31.900
 your character of each character has 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:38.040
 the jets that you must meet 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:44.350
 for example chopper needs 887 in 1717 

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:50.760
 group 7 frank 7 nikolov and 9 are 9 light 

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:53.540
 and 9 6 and 7 and but 17 then 

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:53.540
 each level 

00:05:53.880 --> 00:06:00.680
 for example all have level 1 1 1 1 

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:07.190
 a turn 

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:10.370
 22 22 go and so frequently example and 

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:14.449
 since I also spent it for today should 

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:17.780
 be 88 88 giles and when you do not have 

00:06:14.449 --> 00:06:22.700
 comes out quickly in magazines and das 

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:27.910
 click on advance then you finish it 

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:27.910
 good friends that's all see you
