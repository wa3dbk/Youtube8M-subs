00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
pretty ft and let's put it with the with

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:31.589 
pretty ft and let's put it with the with
the<00:03:20.709> lid<00:03:21.959> 2.25<00:03:23.220> kilograms<00:03:25.169> and<00:03:30.329> four<00:03:31.329> point

nine seven pounds almost five I would

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:34.979 
nine seven pounds almost five I would
say<00:03:34.480> five

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:34.989 
say five

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:40.009 
say five
I<00:03:35.019> think<00:03:35.319> they<00:03:35.470> aim<00:03:35.739> towards<00:03:36.400> five<00:03:36.639> pounds

that's nice
let<00:03:42.700> me<00:03:42.819> move<00:03:42.970> this<00:03:43.180> away<00:03:43.359> so<00:03:46.769> the<00:03:47.769> nice<00:03:48.519> thing

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
let me move this away so the nice thing

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.289 
let me move this away so the nice thing
about<00:03:48.790> it<00:03:49.209> it<00:03:49.359> does<00:03:49.540> have<00:03:49.900> a<00:03:50.200> nice<00:03:50.590> curve<00:03:50.950> here

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:51.299 
about it it does have a nice curve here

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:55.789 
about it it does have a nice curve here
it's<00:03:52.299> not<00:03:52.510> it's<00:03:52.870> not<00:03:53.019> a<00:03:53.079> very<00:03:54.030> pointy<00:03:55.030> angle

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:55.799 
it's not it's not a very pointy angle

00:03:55.799 --> 00:04:01.559 
it's not it's not a very pointy angle
and<00:03:56.799> as<00:03:57.010> tapered<00:03:58.470> edge<00:03:59.470> so<00:04:00.430> it<00:04:00.910> won't<00:04:01.150> spill

00:04:01.559 --> 00:04:01.569 
and as tapered edge so it won't spill

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:05.250 
and as tapered edge so it won't spill
with<00:04:01.810> you<00:04:02.250> when<00:04:03.250> you<00:04:03.340> do<00:04:03.489> some<00:04:03.730> pouring<00:04:04.260> has

follow-up and maybe some cooking session
where<00:04:20.980> where<00:04:21.370> I<00:04:21.400> demonstrate<00:04:22.120> the<00:04:22.300> use<00:04:24.870> other

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:25.870 
where where I demonstrate the use other

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:29.600 
where where I demonstrate the use other
than<00:04:25.990> that<00:04:26.380> I<00:04:26.740> think<00:04:27.310> it's<00:04:27.640> a<00:04:27.850> it's<00:04:28.180> a<00:04:28.480> really

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:29.610 
than that I think it's a it's a really

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:34.050 
than that I think it's a it's a really
nice<00:04:30.610> pot<00:04:31.000> without<00:04:31.840> using<00:04:32.470> it<00:04:32.620> so<00:04:33.060> look

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:34.060 
nice pot without using it so look

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:38.510 
nice pot without using it so look
forward<00:04:34.390> for<00:04:34.510> another<00:04:36.690> another<00:04:37.690> video<00:04:38.140> that

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:38.520 
forward for another another video that

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:43.770 
forward for another another video that
will<00:04:40.860> that<00:04:41.860> I<00:04:41.890> will<00:04:42.160> put<00:04:42.370> this<00:04:42.490> to<00:04:42.760> use<00:04:42.970> now<00:04:43.660> I'm

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:43.780 
will that I will put this to use now I'm

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:45.510 
will that I will put this to use now I'm
trying<00:04:44.080> to<00:04:44.200> figure<00:04:44.350> out<00:04:44.560> where<00:04:44.800> it's<00:04:44.950> made

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:45.520 
trying to figure out where it's made

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.210 
trying to figure out where it's made
I'm<00:04:46.240> kind<00:04:46.960> of<00:04:47.020> surprised<00:04:47.470> that<00:04:47.710> they<00:04:47.860> don't

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:48.220 
I'm kind of surprised that they don't

the pot there's no way nowhere on the

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:03.060 
the pot there's no way nowhere on the
pot<00:04:59.290> that<00:04:59.770> says<00:05:00.100> where<00:05:00.790> this<00:05:01.000> was<00:05:01.270> made<00:05:02.070> was

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:39.310 
comes out from manufacturing it may have

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:43.740 
comes out from manufacturing it may have
some<00:05:39.580> oil<00:05:39.790> on<00:05:40.090> it<00:05:40.330> and<00:05:40.600> other<00:05:42.150> other<00:05:43.150> chemicals

some oil on it and other other chemicals
that<00:05:43.900> they<00:05:44.320> use<00:05:45.160> for<00:05:45.370> storage<00:05:45.940> and<00:05:46.210> for

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:46.450 
that they use for storage and for

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:48.920 
that they use for storage and for
shipping<00:05:46.870> so<00:05:47.230> so<00:05:47.500> so<00:05:47.919> nothing<00:05:48.070> happens<00:05:48.640> to<00:05:48.730> it

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:48.930 
shipping so so so nothing happens to it

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:52.110 
shipping so so so nothing happens to it
plus<00:05:49.930> the<00:05:50.140> manufacturing<00:05:50.860> itself<00:05:51.280> they<00:05:51.910> use<00:05:52.090> a

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:52.120 
plus the manufacturing itself they use a

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:55.970 
plus the manufacturing itself they use a
lot<00:05:52.390> of<00:05:52.419> lubrication<00:05:53.020> when<00:05:53.470> they<00:05:54.030> do<00:05:55.030> the

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:55.980 
lot of lubrication when they do the

00:05:55.980 --> 00:06:00.180 
lot of lubrication when they do the
stretching<00:05:56.980> of<00:05:57.160> the<00:05:57.340> material<00:05:58.800> okay<00:05:59.800> well<00:06:00.040> if

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:00.190
