 a huge place you can give it that 

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:14.119
 becomes the observer 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:15.080
 of the scenario there is a scenario 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:17.810
 planted 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.700
 every week that has been produced and 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.740

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:25.570
 plug-in exercise of those websites 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.570
 training and then a follow-up discussion

 with each other thin and practice and out 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:53.410
 research has actually remained 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.510
 the most of most calamities 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:57.460
 are caused by 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:00.010
 or partly due to poor communication 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:03.360
