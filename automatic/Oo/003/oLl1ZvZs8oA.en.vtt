00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
the whole idea here is actually pretty

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.389 
the whole idea here is actually pretty
simple<00:00:44.640> but<00:00:45.000> when<00:00:45.809> you<00:00:45.930> dig<00:00:46.170> down<00:00:46.559> into<00:00:47.010> the

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
simple but when you dig down into the

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.220 
simple but when you dig down into the
game<00:00:47.550> itself<00:00:47.940> there's<00:00:48.420> a<00:00:48.510> really<00:00:48.840> complex

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
game itself there's a really complex

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.020 
game itself there's a really complex
strategy<00:00:49.739> game<00:00:49.920> here<00:00:50.129> now<00:00:50.520> if<00:00:50.760> you've<00:00:50.910> ever

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
strategy game here now if you've ever

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.869 
strategy game here now if you've ever
played<00:00:51.270> plants<00:00:51.719> vs<00:00:52.230> zombies<00:00:52.649> your<00:00:53.160> kind<00:00:53.610> have

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
played plants vs zombies your kind have

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.090 
played plants vs zombies your kind have
a<00:00:53.910> flavor<00:00:54.239> for<00:00:54.420> how<00:00:54.570> this<00:00:54.840> game<00:00:55.020> works<00:00:55.350> the

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
a flavor for how this game works the

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.790 
a flavor for how this game works the
idea<00:00:56.520> is<00:00:56.610> there's<00:00:57.210> a<00:00:57.300> series<00:00:57.660> of<00:00:57.690> lanes<00:00:58.020> you

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
idea is there's a series of lanes you

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.069 
idea is there's a series of lanes you
will<00:00:58.980> spawn<00:00:59.370> your<00:00:59.670> troops<00:01:00.000> into<00:01:00.510> a<00:01:00.750> particular
