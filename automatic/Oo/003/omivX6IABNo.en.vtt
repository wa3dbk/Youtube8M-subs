now<00:00:13.740> basically<00:00:13.980> this<00:00:14.370> technique<00:00:14.849> is<00:00:15.000> where

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
now basically this technique is where

00:00:17.929 --> 00:00:17.939 
you you have something in focus and then

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:19.340 
you you have something in focus and then
you<00:00:18.060> have<00:00:18.270> something<00:00:18.810> in<00:00:18.960> the<00:00:19.080> background

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
you have something in the background

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.980 
you have something in the background
just<00:00:19.950> completely<00:00:20.340> out<00:00:20.610> of<00:00:20.640> focus<00:00:21.000> this

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
just completely out of focus this

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.760 
just completely out of focus this
technique<00:00:22.500> is<00:00:22.710> known<00:00:22.770> as<00:00:23.099> Boca<00:00:24.770> people

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
that's what it sounds like to me so I

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.040 
that's what it sounds like to me so I
found<00:00:41.070> that<00:00:41.460> there's<00:00:41.760> there's<00:00:42.149> two<00:00:42.450> ways<00:00:42.630> of

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
found that there's there's two ways of

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.160 
found that there's there's two ways of
getting<00:00:43.590> this<00:00:43.920> effect<00:00:44.370> we<00:00:44.940> can<00:00:45.179> either<00:00:45.420> use<00:00:45.570> a

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
getting this effect we can either use a

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.939 
getting this effect we can either use a
very<00:00:46.800> long<00:00:47.190> lens<00:00:47.579> like<00:00:48.480> a<00:00:48.839> 200<00:00:49.559> millimeter

00:00:49.939 --> 00:00:49.949 
very long lens like a 200 millimeter

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:54.590 
very long lens like a 200 millimeter
lens<00:00:50.190> um<00:00:50.839> and<00:00:51.839> we<00:00:52.440> can<00:00:52.789> have<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:54.089> background

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
lens um and we can have the background

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.880 
lens um and we can have the background
way<00:00:55.079> out<00:00:55.350> there<00:00:55.589> or<00:00:56.309> what<00:00:56.550> we<00:00:56.640> can<00:00:56.820> do<00:00:56.969> is<00:00:57.210> use

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:57.890 
way out there or what we can do is use

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.200 
way out there or what we can do is use
something<00:00:58.890> like<00:00:58.920> a<00:00:59.039> fifth<00:00:59.370> 50<00:00:59.789> millimeter

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
something like a fifth 50 millimeter

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.779 
something like a fifth 50 millimeter
lens<00:01:00.449> but<00:01:01.170> just<00:01:01.379> get<00:01:01.559> really<00:01:01.920> close<00:01:02.249> up<00:01:02.519> on<00:01:02.670> the

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
lens but just get really close up on the

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.850 
lens but just get really close up on the
subject<00:01:03.239> and<00:01:03.390> also<00:01:04.320> have<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.680> background

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
subject and also have the background

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.680 
subject and also have the background
just<00:01:05.250> just<00:01:05.700> a<00:01:05.790> few<00:01:06.000> feet<00:01:06.030> away<00:01:06.270> from<00:01:06.450> the

next<00:02:05.460> our<00:02:05.840> subject<00:02:06.840> is<00:02:07.220> this<00:02:08.220> glass<00:02:08.759> jar<00:02:09.360> of

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
next our subject is this glass jar of

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.750 
next our subject is this glass jar of
little<00:02:10.500> nuts<00:02:10.770> but<00:02:10.920> you<00:02:11.070> can't<00:02:11.280> see<00:02:11.430> the<00:02:11.550> nuts

little nuts but you can't see the nuts
because<00:02:11.910> it's<00:02:12.240> that<00:02:12.480> would<00:02:12.570> be<00:02:12.660> stupid<00:02:13.400> so<00:02:14.690> now

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
because it's that would be stupid so now

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.920 
because it's that would be stupid so now
if<00:02:15.810> you<00:02:15.930> see<00:02:16.200> my<00:02:16.590> camera<00:02:17.160> is<00:02:17.720> lined<00:02:18.720> up

lights my iso is at 200 so with all
those<00:03:19.350> settings<00:03:20.360> the<00:03:21.360> key<00:03:21.660> sitting<00:03:22.170> is<00:03:22.350> the

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
those settings the key sitting is the

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.190 
those settings the key sitting is the
aperture<00:03:23.310> have<00:03:23.640> to<00:03:23.790> have<00:03:24.239> the<00:03:24.450> f-number<00:03:24.900> as

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
aperture have to have the f-number as

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.550 
aperture have to have the f-number as
low<00:03:25.530> as<00:03:25.709> it<00:03:25.799> can<00:03:25.860> go<00:03:26.130> to<00:03:26.640> get<00:03:26.790> this<00:03:26.910> effect<00:03:27.560> and

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
low as it can go to get this effect and

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.979 
low as it can go to get this effect and
then<00:03:29.250> you<00:03:29.370> want<00:03:29.549> to<00:03:29.640> focus<00:03:29.910> you<00:03:30.570> want<00:03:30.750> to<00:03:30.810> make

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
then you want to focus you want to make

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:33.160 
then you want to focus you want to make
sure<00:03:31.019> you<00:03:31.350> focus<00:03:31.680> on<00:03:32.010> your<00:03:32.190> drawer<00:03:32.549> over<00:03:32.940> there

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
sure you focus on your drawer over there

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.570 
sure you focus on your drawer over there
you<00:03:34.170> have<00:03:34.290> to<00:03:34.350> get<00:03:34.530> that<00:03:34.650> perfectly<00:03:35.220> in<00:03:35.400> focus

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:35.580 
you have to get that perfectly in focus

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:39.710 
you have to get that perfectly in focus
I<00:03:35.970> would<00:03:36.420> just<00:03:36.540> use<00:03:36.660> manual<00:03:36.959> focus<00:03:38.510> then<00:03:39.510> what

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
I would just use manual focus then what

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.470 
I would just use manual focus then what
you<00:03:39.840> do<00:03:39.989> there's<00:03:40.769> the<00:03:40.980> viewfinder<00:03:41.519> if<00:03:42.209> you<00:03:42.360> can

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
you do there's the viewfinder if you can

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.030 
you do there's the viewfinder if you can
see<00:03:42.690> they<00:03:42.870> fit<00:03:43.200> through<00:03:43.470> there<00:03:43.620> that's<00:03:43.890> what

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
see they fit through there that's what

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.710 
see they fit through there that's what
it<00:03:44.130> looks<00:03:44.280> like<00:03:44.400> when<00:03:45.120> you're<00:03:45.420> looking

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
it looks like when you're looking

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.569 
it looks like when you're looking
through<00:03:45.930> it<00:03:46.019> so<00:03:46.769> if<00:03:46.830> i<00:03:46.920> take<00:03:47.130> the<00:03:47.280> picture

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:47.579 
through it so if i take the picture

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:52.640 
through it so if i take the picture
right<00:03:47.610> now<00:03:48.290> um<00:03:50.420> that<00:03:51.420> is<00:03:51.720> the<00:03:52.049> result<00:03:52.230> when<00:03:52.560> we

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
right now um that is the result when we

00:03:52.650 --> 00:04:00.420 
right now um that is the result when we
get<00:03:52.860> right<00:03:54.440> kitten<00:03:55.440> focus<00:03:55.950> right<00:03:56.640> there

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:05.860 

boom<00:04:01.430> okay<00:04:03.250> now<00:04:04.250> here<00:04:04.700> is<00:04:04.940> the<00:04:04.970> second<00:04:05.720> way<00:04:05.810> to

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870 
boom okay now here is the second way to

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:08.980 
boom okay now here is the second way to
do<00:04:06.050> it<00:04:06.200> the<00:04:06.800> second<00:04:07.160> way<00:04:07.250> to<00:04:07.280> do<00:04:07.460> it<00:04:07.610> is<00:04:07.790> to<00:04:08.420> use

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:08.990 
do it the second way to do it is to use

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:14.800 
do it the second way to do it is to use
a<00:04:10.060> lens<00:04:11.060> that<00:04:11.900> is<00:04:12.160> it's<00:04:13.160> a<00:04:13.490> prime<00:04:14.060> lens<00:04:14.270> so<00:04:14.630> it's

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:14.810 
a lens that is it's a prime lens so it's

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:16.810 
a lens that is it's a prime lens so it's
something<00:04:15.080> like<00:04:15.110> 15<00:04:15.650> millimeters<00:04:16.130> it's<00:04:16.580> not

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:16.820 
something like 15 millimeters it's not

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:20.350 
something like 15 millimeters it's not
as<00:04:17.209> Extreme<00:04:17.959> as<00:04:17.989> 200<00:04:18.769> it's<00:04:19.310> just<00:04:19.489> a<00:04:19.580> regular<00:04:19.820> 50

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:20.360 
as Extreme as 200 it's just a regular 50

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:23.350 
as Extreme as 200 it's just a regular 50
millimeter<00:04:20.750> lens<00:04:20.959> and<00:04:21.350> the<00:04:21.910> aperture<00:04:22.910> is<00:04:23.150> set
