00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:36.489 
watch is guided controlled by radio so

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:39.150 
watch is guided controlled by radio so
it<00:03:36.640> is<00:03:36.790> really<00:03:37.060> completely<00:03:37.840> accurate<00:03:38.470> with<00:03:39.130> a

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160 
it is really completely accurate with a

it is really completely accurate with a
special<00:03:39.580> mechanism<00:03:40.420> inside<00:03:40.690> has<00:03:40.959> been

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.110 
special mechanism inside has been

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:45.650 
special mechanism inside has been
developed<00:03:41.470> for<00:03:41.800> that<00:03:41.830> purpose<00:03:43.980> to<00:03:44.980> show<00:03:45.160> that

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
developed for that purpose to show that

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.729 
developed for that purpose to show that
watchmaking<00:03:46.660> is<00:03:46.900> present<00:03:47.260> even<00:03:47.620> in
