00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:04.840
 bessonova 

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:07.460
 very helpful 

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:09.109
 tickets taken is used 

00:00:09.109 --> 00:00:11.579
 belcastro 

00:00:11.579 --> 00:00:12.390
 the water 

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:14.139
 essential for life 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:17.300
 yet we do not have the awareness of its scarcity 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:21.769
 from the water we leave water we are composed 

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:24.909
 this is why the right of access to the fundamental right for 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:27.759
 the wind of neoliberalism 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:32.359
 after making the work precarious to weaken the welfare road system 

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:35.600
 still the assault on their fundamental rights right of access to 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.420
 sweeteners 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:38.790
 privatize water 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.230
 it does not represent a response to people's needs 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:46.430
 cold constitutes the delivery of an essential good up in the profit deduction 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:49.829
 that is, to the multinationals and joy has been besieged 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.879
 but who caused the anger that had been brewing for a long time was 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.020
 the announcement of a 400% increase in the price of drinking water 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.780
 with the privatization to win the contract for the distribution 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.860
 water and the multinational still said the most active schedules of this network 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.860
 to make young people against other young people 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.760
 then the Cretans made cool 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.119
 105 ok it's covered 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:21.209
 the cocacola you invested 10 million euros to launch its own mineral 

00:01:21.209 --> 00:01:22.600
 among the British 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.510
 water from asani was about to become the gadget and favorite of young fashionistas 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.100
 fixed with the shape 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.270
 when it was discovered who expensive it bottle one euro and 40 per half 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:35.090
 liter 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.260
 contains purified thames water 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.640
 and not even that much since they have been traced 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.210
 high levels of bromate a carcinogen 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.710
 multinationals to these 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.770
 runs around a continent naked to grab the part of everyone for 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.109
 then sell it and make some very high profits instead 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.700
 reserved for a few euro criminal exploitation 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.850
 business terrorism 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.179
 destroy water resources 

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:06.799
 and the aquifer forest basins is a form of terrorism 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:08.489
 Italy 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:13.569
 the world's largest consumer of bottled mineral water well this record 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:17.560
 Italian only feed the profits of the multinationals they are 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:18.859
 marble owners 

00:02:18.859 --> 00:02:22.920
 but it helps to pollute the environment with the plastic bottles the drain buttons 

00:02:22.919 --> 00:02:27.109
 of the tv that you are transporting up and down the peninsula the northern waters come 

00:02:27.109 --> 00:02:30.209
 sold in the south heart of central Italy are brought to the north 

00:02:30.789 --> 00:02:34.439
 no one cares to know for example how many miles he has traveled 

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:37.439
 the water he is seeing to get to his table 

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:43.430
 the quality parameters provided by the law for drinking water are more 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.849
 restrictive than those provided for bottled mineral water 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:50.829
 but how is it possible that the law treats water with two weights and two measures 

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:53.889
 the drinking water supply is bottled 

00:02:53.889 --> 00:02:57.629
 they tell us about campaigns every day and we let ourselves be conditioned 

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:02.169
 from advertising we receive common deformed training we believe for 

00:03:02.169 --> 00:03:04.929
 example that the tap water is not good that does not do good to 

00:03:04.929 --> 00:03:07.259
 health in some cases that is not potable 

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:11.939
 with one euro I buy 100 thousand liters of water now count how many hours from 

00:03:11.939 --> 00:03:14.569
 bobo and euro crown 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:15.769
 please 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:18.919
 let's stop pears in bottled water 

00:03:18.919 --> 00:03:23.599
 we drink the tap water at home we expect the restaurant bar not 

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:24.799
 we want unification 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:26.889
 just for what i do 

00:03:26.889 --> 00:03:29.489
 normal water valagro 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:31.999
 I drink tap water 

00:03:31.999 --> 00:03:34.899
 I care about your why 

00:03:34.899 --> 00:03:37.269
 is the beating heart of the 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:38.299
 because water is life
