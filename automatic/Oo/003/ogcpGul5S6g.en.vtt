right<00:00:00.810> here<00:00:01.020> is<00:00:01.110> a<00:00:01.140> caterpillar<00:00:01.709> 3:45<00:00:02.550> seal

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:03.500 
right here is a caterpillar 3:45 seal

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:07.430 
right here is a caterpillar 3:45 seal
this<00:00:04.520> actually<00:00:05.520> isn't<00:00:05.700> the<00:00:06.029> newest<00:00:06.390> 3:45<00:00:07.140> made

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
this actually isn't the newest 3:45 made

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.740 
this actually isn't the newest 3:45 made
the<00:00:08.069> newest<00:00:08.400> one<00:00:08.670> would<00:00:08.940> be<00:00:09.179> a<00:00:10.280> 345<00:00:11.280> DL<00:00:11.820> which

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
the newest one would be a 345 DL which

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.870 
the newest one would be a 345 DL which
really<00:00:13.349> isn't<00:00:13.590> seen<00:00:13.830> too<00:00:13.980> much

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
really isn't seen too much

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.279 
really isn't seen too much
they<00:00:15.150> always<00:00:15.330> update<00:00:15.630> their<00:00:15.780> equipment<00:00:16.199> a<00:00:16.260> lot

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
they always update their equipment a lot

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:17.450 
they always update their equipment a lot
this<00:00:16.590> company<00:00:16.920> and<00:00:17.039> they<00:00:17.160> don't<00:00:17.220> even<00:00:17.340> have

this company and they don't even have
one<00:00:17.699> yet<00:00:17.880> but<00:00:18.510> the<00:00:18.900> CL<00:00:19.199> replaced<00:00:19.560> the<00:00:19.680> BL<00:00:20.510> to

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
one yet but the CL replaced the BL to

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.179 
one yet but the CL replaced the BL to
get<00:00:21.630> things<00:00:21.869> started<00:00:22.140> here<00:00:24.980> buckets<00:00:25.980> right

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
get things started here buckets right

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.679 
get things started here buckets right
over<00:00:26.369> here<00:00:26.670> a<00:00:27.170> 345<00:00:28.170> CL<00:00:28.769> runs<00:00:29.160> a<00:00:29.689> five-yard

over here a 345 CL runs a five-yard
bucket<00:00:31.109> this<00:00:31.650> bucket<00:00:32.009> is<00:00:32.099> obviously<00:00:32.579> bigger

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
bucket this bucket is obviously bigger

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.479 
bucket this bucket is obviously bigger
this<00:00:34.230> is<00:00:34.290> a<00:00:34.940> 7<00:00:35.940> to<00:00:36.210> move<00:00:36.360> bucket<00:00:36.920> if<00:00:37.920> I<00:00:38.280> had<00:00:38.460> a

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
this is a 7 to move bucket if I had a

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.160 
this is a 7 to move bucket if I had a
pick<00:00:38.790> I<00:00:39.000> would<00:00:39.149> probably<00:00:39.360> say<00:00:39.690> this<00:00:39.870> is<00:00:40.020> maybe

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
pick I would probably say this is maybe

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.729 
pick I would probably say this is maybe
a<00:00:40.290> 6<00:00:40.739> or<00:00:40.860> 7<00:00:40.920> yard<00:00:41.489> bucket<00:00:41.910> on<00:00:42.030> this<00:00:42.440> it's<00:00:43.440> not<00:00:43.590> so

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
a 6 or 7 yard bucket on this it's not so

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:44.810 
a 6 or 7 yard bucket on this it's not so
often<00:00:43.980> that<00:00:44.040> you<00:00:44.100> see<00:00:44.190> a<00:00:44.309> bucket<00:00:44.579> with<00:00:44.670> this

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
often that you see a bucket with this

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.529 
often that you see a bucket with this
many<00:00:45.030> teeth<00:00:45.239> these<00:00:46.110> are<00:00:46.350> just<00:00:47.300> the<00:00:48.300> side

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
many teeth these are just the side

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.410 
many teeth these are just the side
cutters<00:00:48.960> it<00:00:49.140> just<00:00:49.399> gives<00:00:50.399> it<00:00:50.579> a<00:00:50.640> more<00:00:50.910> force<00:00:51.239> to

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
cutters it just gives it a more force to

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.299 
cutters it just gives it a more force to
cut<00:00:51.600> through<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:51.809> dirt<00:00:51.989> thanks<00:00:52.949> to<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.129> back

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
cut through the dirt thanks to the back

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.119 
cut through the dirt thanks to the back
of<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.550> bucket<00:00:53.730> and<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.090> wear<00:00:54.270> guards<00:00:55.129> these

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
of the bucket and the wear guards these

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.389 
of the bucket and the wear guards these
X's<00:00:56.879> you<00:00:56.910> see<00:00:57.180> are<00:00:57.390> welded<00:00:57.930> on<00:00:58.109> to<00:00:59.100> give<00:00:59.250> it

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
X's you see are welded on to give it

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.389 
X's you see are welded on to give it
more<00:00:59.809> it<00:01:00.809> just<00:01:01.020> gives<00:01:01.590> a<00:01:01.710> bucket<00:01:01.980> more<00:01:02.160> where

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
more it just gives a bucket more where

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.050 
more it just gives a bucket more where
it<00:01:02.879> won't<00:01:03.270> wear<00:01:03.420> out<00:01:03.570> as<00:01:03.750> quick<00:01:04.309> and<00:01:05.309> you<00:01:05.880> see<00:01:06.030> a

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
it won't wear out as quick and you see a

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.030 
it won't wear out as quick and you see a
lot<00:01:06.210> of<00:01:06.240> companies<00:01:06.659> weld<00:01:06.930> these<00:01:07.500> numbers<00:01:07.890> on

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
lot of companies weld these numbers on

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.609 
lot of companies weld these numbers on
it's<00:01:08.820> just<00:01:09.150> that<00:01:09.330> when<00:01:10.200> you<00:01:10.229> have<00:01:10.350> so<00:01:10.500> many

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
it's just that when you have so many

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.679 
it's just that when you have so many
machines<00:01:11.010> and<00:01:11.369> so<00:01:11.580> many<00:01:11.729> attachments<00:01:12.420> it's

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
machines and so many attachments it's

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.620 
machines and so many attachments it's
just<00:01:12.930> that<00:01:13.280> tell<00:01:14.280> which<00:01:14.549> attachment<00:01:15.210> is<00:01:15.390> for

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
just that tell which attachment is for

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.950 
just that tell which attachment is for
each<00:01:15.840> machine<00:01:17.060> now<00:01:18.060> here's<00:01:18.330> a<00:01:18.390> quick<00:01:18.570> coupler

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
each machine now here's a quick coupler

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.560 
each machine now here's a quick coupler
great<00:01:19.799> for<00:01:20.040> demolition<00:01:20.820> machines<00:01:21.299> because

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
great for demolition machines because

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.270 
great for demolition machines because
usually<00:01:21.990> on<00:01:22.229> a<00:01:22.259> demo<00:01:22.500> site<00:01:22.770> you're<00:01:23.009> switching

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
usually on a demo site you're switching

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.280 
usually on a demo site you're switching
attachments<00:01:24.060> at<00:01:24.869> least<00:01:25.200> two<00:01:25.560> times<00:01:25.799> a<00:01:25.979> week

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:27.290 
attachments at least two times a week

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:29.630 
attachments at least two times a week
but<00:01:28.290> that's<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.799> quick<00:01:28.979> coupler<00:01:29.159> it's<00:01:29.400> a<00:01:29.430> cat

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
but that's the quick coupler it's a cat

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.069 
but that's the quick coupler it's a cat
quick<00:01:29.880> coupler<00:01:30.240> and<00:01:30.420> then<00:01:30.630> you<00:01:30.840> see<00:01:30.990> your

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
quick coupler and then you see your

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.830 
quick coupler and then you see your
stick<00:01:31.409> all<00:01:31.799> these<00:01:32.060> all<00:01:33.060> these<00:01:33.240> necessary

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
stick all these all these necessary

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.240 
stick all these all these necessary
machines<00:01:34.439> are<00:01:34.560> outfitted<00:01:35.040> with<00:01:35.189> the

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
machines are outfitted with the

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.740 
machines are outfitted with the
auxiliary<00:01:35.759> hydraulic<00:01:36.000> lines

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
auxiliary hydraulic lines

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.649 
auxiliary hydraulic lines
that's<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.799> auxiliary<00:01:38.210> it's<00:01:39.210> just<00:01:39.540> for

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
that's the auxiliary it's just for

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.030 
that's the auxiliary it's just for
another<00:01:39.780> attachment<00:01:40.140> and<00:01:40.560> then<00:01:40.680> there's<00:01:40.920> your

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
another attachment and then there's your

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.710 
another attachment and then there's your
bracket<00:01:41.430> for<00:01:41.700> if<00:01:41.909> you<00:01:42.210> have<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.390> mountain<00:01:42.630> to

bracket for if you have the mountain to

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.950 
bracket for if you have the mountain to
grapple<00:01:43.430> and<00:01:44.430> then<00:01:44.790> there's<00:01:45.030> your<00:01:45.299> boom<00:01:45.540> this

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
grapple and then there's your boom this

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.800 
grapple and then there's your boom this

and also as a front shovel from cats but

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.249 
and also as a front shovel from cats but

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
to find someone that actually uses a 345

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.639 
to find someone that actually uses a 345
front<00:01:55.680> shovel<00:01:56.009> is<00:01:56.420> not<00:01:57.420> that<00:01:57.719> common<00:01:58.020> just

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
front shovel is not that common just

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.370 
front shovel is not that common just
because<00:01:58.979> of<00:01:59.159> the<00:01:59.640> size<00:01:59.969> of<00:02:00.180> it<00:02:00.299> and<00:02:00.380> usually

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
because of the size of it and usually

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.990 
because of the size of it and usually
had<00:02:01.469> a<00:02:01.530> site<00:02:01.740> with<00:02:01.890> a<00:02:01.920> front<00:02:02.159> shovel<00:02:02.490> you<00:02:02.880> have

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
had a site with a front shovel you have

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.230 
had a site with a front shovel you have
to<00:02:03.119> run<00:02:03.270> a<00:02:03.299> machine<00:02:03.420> bigger<00:02:03.780> than<00:02:03.930> 345

is<00:04:10.200> right<00:04:10.379> there

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:11.850 
is right there

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:15.200 
is right there
and<00:04:12.800> this<00:04:13.800> machine<00:04:14.130> is<00:04:14.280> compatible<00:04:14.820> to<00:04:15.000> tier

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:15.210 
and this machine is compatible to tier

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:19.100 
and this machine is compatible to tier
three<00:04:15.570> emissions<00:04:16.070> that<00:04:17.070> are<00:04:17.840> not<00:04:18.840> with<00:04:19.020> the

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:19.110 
three emissions that are not with the

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:20.570 
three emissions that are not with the
tier<00:04:19.290> 4<00:04:19.500> you<00:04:19.650> that<00:04:19.860> released<00:04:20.160> one<00:04:20.340> for<00:04:20.520> the

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:20.580 
tier 4 you that released one for the

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:22.790 
tier 4 you that released one for the
tier<00:04:20.760> 4<00:04:21.000> in<00:04:21.150> my<00:04:21.270> opinion<00:04:21.660> it's<00:04:21.810> ugly<00:04:21.930> but

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 
tier 4 in my opinion it's ugly but

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.630 
tier 4 in my opinion it's ugly but
there's<00:04:23.160> a<00:04:23.250> 345<00:04:23.910> CL<00:04:24.830> it's<00:04:25.830> in<00:04:25.950> the<00:04:26.010> 45<00:04:26.400> ton

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:26.640 
there's a 345 CL it's in the 45 ton

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:30.890 
there's a 345 CL it's in the 45 ton
range<00:04:26.820> and<00:04:27.210> I<00:04:27.270> believe<00:04:27.690> the<00:04:27.840> engine<00:04:28.230> is<00:04:28.410> a<00:04:29.900> c9

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 
range and I believe the engine is a c9

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.760 
range and I believe the engine is a c9
with<00:04:31.280> 345<00:04:32.280> horsepower<00:04:33.380> I'll<00:04:34.380> correct<00:04:34.680> myself

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:34.770 
with 345 horsepower I'll correct myself

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:38.360 
with 345 horsepower I'll correct myself
it<00:04:35.280> might<00:04:35.400> not<00:04:35.550> be<00:04:35.640> a<00:04:35.670> c9<00:04:36.000> but<00:04:36.210> there
