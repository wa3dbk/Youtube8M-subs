approach to photography is always to

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.750 
approach to photography is always to
look<00:04:42.540> at<00:04:42.690> something<00:04:42.960> and<00:04:43.320> study<00:04:44.100> and<00:04:44.370> try<00:04:44.700> and

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:44.760 
look at something and study and try and

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:47.270 
look at something and study and try and
find<00:04:45.000> the<00:04:45.240> truth<00:04:45.480> in<00:04:45.750> that<00:04:45.960> image<00:04:46.230> and<00:04:46.620> work

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.280 
find the truth in that image and work

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.370 
find the truth in that image and work
