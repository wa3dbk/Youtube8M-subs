00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.500
 found to talk about the folds 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.330
 technology created by apple since 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.219
 the iphone 4 which allows you to delete a 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.259
 music with a compatible hi-fi system 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.800
 or not is also on it but its 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:19.020
 video and music photos on an apple 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.100
 tv compatible then of course for that 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.560
 you have to do the updates on 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.210

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.390

 select the desired airplay port 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.910
 for me it will be of course the freebox 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.320
 server which I will explain 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.809
 registration and compatibility 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.660
 later then once the seer 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.950
 and blue have chosen on its meaning one 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.980
 wait a few seconds we can 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:55.260
 also decrease the volume only 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:57.920
 for this material is also choose 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:03.570
 several materials like the computer 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:06.119
 here is the freebox player so the TV and 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.549
 the freebox server at the same time so we 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:12.570
 can lower the volume of an element 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:15.390
 like the computer or the freebox player 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.820
 we can also lower the three in 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.759
 same time 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:23.220
