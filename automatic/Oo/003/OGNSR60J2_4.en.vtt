using because it is store-bought is a

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.599 
using because it is store-bought is a
little<00:03:57.419> softer<00:03:57.870> so<00:03:58.079> the<00:03:58.739> grass<00:03:58.949> tends<00:03:59.250> to<00:03:59.430> kind

00:03:59.599 --> 00:03:59.609 
little softer so the grass tends to kind

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:01.009 
little softer so the grass tends to kind
of<00:03:59.669> flop<00:03:59.879> over<00:04:00.180> but<00:04:00.359> that's<00:04:00.510> okay

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:01.019 
of flop over but that's okay

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:03.199
