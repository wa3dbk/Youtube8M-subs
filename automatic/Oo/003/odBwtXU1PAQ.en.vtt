00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:44.520
 notice this mode is for these these 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.390
 ways 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:50.760
 are for version 1.4 2.6 young and 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.210
 It also serves for 1.4 points that 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.620
 we are now 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:01:01.699
 bringing to list of all modes 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:01.699
 what do you have to have to use know 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.860
 they put 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:08.850
 the ones we like the most if you do not 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:13.190
 wants the thriller mark them 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:15.260
 do not want the shadow to remark 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.450
 but how it comes like that is how 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.990
 they have july retirement 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:23.250
 good 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:25.520
 and here they choose if you are premium or you 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.100
 they keep pirate 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:31.840
 I have pirates by name and before 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:34.420
 can install in your folder 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:37.929
 this point minecraft that they put by 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.960
 learned cent is sorry they come to 

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:41.960
 roaming 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:45.760
 and these two I'm going to look like this 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.760
 you download this launcher 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:50.450
 a point will be made and it is about 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:54.280
 Maya 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.280
 and these two delete it 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.420
 i 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:06.170
 they eliminated these two things these two 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.870
 folders close them 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.810
 as they mark 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:12.770
 first I learned to be then to be 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.750
 Really 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:17.360
 I do not 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.490
 and I was fine all the ways if 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.030
 they want to check that they have all the 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:23.830
 modes can go to your folder 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.830
 or can enter its inclusion within 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:28.390
 because it would give me a lot 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:33.150
 I have recorded with 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:33.150
 with qantas and good games 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:38.130
 and here are all the modes 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.030
 they come 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.030
 with the width 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:47.820
 your 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:50.910
 you can choose when 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:54.100
 when they will not be here any 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:58.320
 appear all but when they enter 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:58.320
 and how many ways to win will appear 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:04.270
 I think that was all 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:06.470
