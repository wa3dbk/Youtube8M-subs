when he got there they had a lack of

when he got there they had a lack of
quality<00:01:06.090> depth<00:01:06.420> he<00:01:06.540> put<00:01:06.720> things<00:01:06.900> together

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
quality depth he put things together

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.649

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
real fast real strong record now he

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.240 
real fast real strong record now he
lands<00:01:09.960> at<00:01:10.110> Penn<00:01:10.290> State<00:01:10.590> and<00:01:10.799> he's<00:01:10.890> got<00:01:11.070> to<00:01:11.189> do

it<00:01:11.369> all<00:01:11.460> over<00:01:11.490> again<00:01:11.760> because<00:01:12.090> I<00:01:12.420> think<00:01:12.840> this

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
it all over again because I think this

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.469 
it all over again because I think this
is<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.350> season<00:01:13.590> where<00:01:14.369> Penn<00:01:14.610> State's<00:01:14.939> lack<00:01:15.270> of

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
is the season where Penn State's lack of

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.539 
is the season where Penn State's lack of
quality<00:01:15.960> depth<00:01:16.320> and<00:01:16.920> they've<00:01:17.070> done<00:01:17.310> pretty

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
quality depth and they've done pretty

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:18.710 
quality depth and they've done pretty
well<00:01:17.640> under<00:01:17.970> Bill<00:01:18.090> O'Brien<00:01:18.390> with<00:01:18.509> with

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
well under Bill O'Brien with with

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.120 
well under Bill O'Brien with with
recruiting<00:01:19.049> but<00:01:19.259> there's<00:01:19.409> a<00:01:19.500> lack<00:01:19.680> of<00:01:19.710> quality

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
recruiting but there's a lack of quality

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.249 
recruiting but there's a lack of quality
depth<00:01:20.400> due<00:01:21.000> to<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.240> sanctions<00:01:21.750> of<00:01:21.869> a<00:01:21.990> couple

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
depth due to the sanctions of a couple

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:23.539 
depth due to the sanctions of a couple
of<00:01:22.350> years<00:01:22.470> ago<00:01:22.560> and<00:01:23.130> I<00:01:23.220> think<00:01:23.340> it<00:01:23.430> really

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
of years ago and I think it really

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.190 
of years ago and I think it really

worried<00:02:39.360> about<00:02:39.480> that<00:02:39.870> central<00:02:40.740> florida<00:02:41.010> is

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
worried about that central florida is

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:42.680 
worried about that central florida is
not<00:02:41.370> worried<00:02:41.700> about<00:02:41.790> for<00:02:42.090> this<00:02:42.180> particular

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
not worried about for this particular

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.300 
not worried about for this particular
game<00:02:42.870> that<00:02:43.440> i<00:02:43.470> think<00:02:43.709> it<00:02:43.800> does<00:02:43.830> have<00:02:44.190> to<00:02:44.280> be

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
game that i think it does have to be

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:45.830 
game that i think it does have to be
factored<00:02:44.820> into<00:02:44.940> the<00:02:45.000> equation<00:02:45.090> and<00:02:45.660> i<00:02:45.690> think

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
factored into the equation and i think

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.199 
factored into the equation and i think
it<00:02:45.930> hurts<00:02:46.200> them<00:02:46.470> potentially<00:02:46.770> much<00:02:47.730> more<00:02:47.760> than

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
it hurts them potentially much more than

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:49.640 
it hurts them potentially much more than
it<00:02:48.300> will<00:02:48.360> hurt<00:02:48.480> central<00:02:48.840> florida<00:02:49.170> very<00:02:49.470> good

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650

the<00:04:04.860> what<00:04:04.980> they're<00:04:05.100> going<00:04:05.190> to<00:04:05.250> do<00:04:05.400> is<00:04:05.519> going<00:04:05.610> to

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
the what they're going to do is going to

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:07.670 
the what they're going to do is going to
be<00:04:05.850> able<00:04:06.030> to<00:04:06.090> bottle<00:04:06.510> up<00:04:06.600> Penn<00:04:06.840> State<00:04:07.079> because

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
be able to bottle up Penn State because

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.110 
be able to bottle up Penn State because
of<00:04:07.829> the<00:04:07.890> Nittany<00:04:08.160> Lions<00:04:08.430> problems<00:04:08.880> on<00:04:09.000> the

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
of the Nittany Lions problems on the

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:10.789 
of the Nittany Lions problems on the
offensive<00:04:09.480> line<00:04:09.600> the<00:04:09.870> rebuilding<00:04:10.260> situation

00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:10.799 
offensive line the rebuilding situation

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:13.100 
offensive line the rebuilding situation
and<00:04:10.950> I<00:04:11.280> don't<00:04:11.640> like<00:04:11.850> penn<00:04:12.090> state<00:04:12.299> secondary<00:04:12.840> so

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:13.110 
and I don't like penn state secondary so

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:14.870 
and I don't like penn state secondary so
i<00:04:13.140> think<00:04:13.260> central<00:04:13.890> florida<00:04:14.220> is<00:04:14.430> going<00:04:14.730> to<00:04:14.790> have

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 
i think central florida is going to have

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.759 
i think central florida is going to have
a<00:04:14.910> little<00:04:15.120> bit<00:04:15.329> better<00:04:15.450> shot<00:04:15.810> at<00:04:16.019> going<00:04:16.470> deep

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769 
a little bit better shot at going deep

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:18.469 
a little bit better shot at going deep
against<00:04:17.100> penn<00:04:17.280> state<00:04:17.519> than<00:04:17.700> they<00:04:17.790> would<00:04:18.090> if

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:18.479 
against penn state than they would if

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:20.029 
against penn state than they would if
they<00:04:18.600> open<00:04:18.930> against<00:04:19.200> some<00:04:19.380> other<00:04:19.470> opponents

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:20.039 
they open against some other opponents

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:21.380 
they open against some other opponents
out<00:04:20.370> of<00:04:20.549> the<00:04:20.640> Big<00:04:20.789> Ten<00:04:21.030> if<00:04:21.150> they<00:04:21.239> would<00:04:21.359> have

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:21.390 
out of the Big Ten if they would have

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:23.210 
out of the Big Ten if they would have
played<00:04:21.630> another<00:04:21.840> big<00:04:22.049> ten<00:04:22.260> opponents<00:04:22.919> so

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.220 
played another big ten opponents so

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.460 
played another big ten opponents so
here's<00:04:23.400> the<00:04:23.520> situation<00:04:23.849> I<00:04:24.300> think<00:04:24.720> Central

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
here's the situation I think Central

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:25.990 
here's the situation I think Central
Florida<00:04:25.740> not

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.000 
Florida not

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.300 
Florida not

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.620 
to 14 points covers that spread which

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:35.840 
Baylor last year that made it five and

it's<00:04:45.530> a<00:04:45.590> pretty<00:04:45.770> solid<00:04:46.040> play<00:04:46.340> Central<00:04:46.790> Florida

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:47.120

and I think a couple other notes that I
had<00:04:53.810> is<00:04:54.020> that<00:04:54.470> if<00:04:54.650> I<00:04:54.710> get<00:04:54.860> a<00:04:54.890> team<00:04:55.130> total<00:04:55.460> on
