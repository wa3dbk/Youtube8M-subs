00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:08.250
 to test orders cedar 14 and obnoxious 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:12.090
 shows a video a bit peculiar 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.639
 because today I managed to create 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.320
 the first laser 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:16.619
 even tie or address at the controls the 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.750
 block 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.330
 so I'll show you right now 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.779
 how does it work 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:29.779
 So here is that I did a little 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:34.290
 laser and that's it starts to cut 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:36.570
 the items and so that's how I 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.559
 managed to do that it's very simple you 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:42.870
 have the order of in the description 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:45.379
 and so now we're going to go 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.379
 explanations 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:54.059
 hop there you can that I can kill him 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.520
 can so so super simple if you know 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:01:00.329
 not if it's actually clippers I 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:02.490
 I'll just show you I'm playing 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.990
 chopped off 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:08.990
 the system of motion 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.990
 here 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:15.580
 so in fact that's it's just 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:20.780
 creepers actually I removed the sound of 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:23.350
 hostile pubs actually it's a scared cry 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.910
 quite simply 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.560
 so in fact I made a pillar 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:29.240
 several pinball with 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.820
 features that he is invincible and 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.200
 invisible so why invincible 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.840
 it's to prevent them from dying at 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:39.080
 through the blocks invisible power 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:41.810
 just his his radius is also right 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.970
 also add that he had a power so 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.810
 the power was when haxhi father is 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.090
 struck by lightning 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.950
 he becomes charged so does a lot 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.720
 more damage 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.610
 So there I did that but we can 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.970
 clae with friends blocking so I 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:57.640
 I will miss the order right away 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:02:00.920
 so the order is extremely long 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.539
 so we're going to do this like this see 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:07.210
 to go really extremely long 

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:07.210
 so we will select the title 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:17.299
 so I want to show we're going to stick to it 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:20.420
 start here then here so in fact we're going 

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:22.400
 only to the clippers in fact we're going to 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.290
 give a power so the power 2 1 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.180
 so it's what the losses charged on 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:29.030
 will give an active effect so the act 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:34.450
 iv of fact we will give them I pull it 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:36.489
 and made invisible is invincible to the cir 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:40.220
 except that the 2g 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:43.880
 I'm not here I am not here 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:47.090
 amplify I loved it so here I put 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:51.410
 just zaidi invincible and invisible 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:53.990
 and then everything in the end I liked 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:56.780
 who resigns himself so loading his 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:59.800
 overlaps on ammann so he keeps himself 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.520
 does he overlap on man 4 several 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:03.290
 clips and petition we can do it 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:05.510
 really far we can put more 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.010
 of 16000 character so also there are 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:09.260
 plenty of things that two possibilities 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:12.380
 then how did I manage to do that 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:16.250
 so here it's a little harder a little 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:17.930
 heavier I mean because in fact 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.390
 you have to calculate the time so it's 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:23.600
 super simple actually at the moment when the 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:27.110
 rain is a system that calculates at 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:28.580
 moment when the creeper arrives I do 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:32.390
 break the block and I do it replaced 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:35.240
 on the part of fire as here doing it 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:37.760
 replace it with fire 

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:39.260
 calculations and the relative if you want 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.440
 to copy the mattresses are anyways 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:48.020
 everywhere I have done relative calculations 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:50.350
 except I think for the I hold that of 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:50.350
 after 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:56.189
 with lacerte 6 ha yes just for the 7 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:59.400
 years that racism is a small block 

00:03:56.189 --> 00:04:01.099
 So here we are, so we have 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:04.319
 all prepared 

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:07.739
 I 'm doing my blog for touring father is 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:09.659
 so in fact when I support sakassou the 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:13.200
 systems with the seven system blocks the 

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:15.030
 seven blocks simply see slash 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.560
 and boch the relative order which is at 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:18.870
 so it's actually hot breaking the block 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:21.239
 is above 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:24.930
 so jamie 0 for the 10 euros for 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:27.270
 the air and 0 again because the dta 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:28.680
 vialou of the grass to his heroes the 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.050
 wet destroy so that it makes a 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:33.389
 little effect of destruction so then 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:36.539
 here I did several things and 

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:37.979
 arriving here I always did for the 

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:40.710
 sows except that in fact directly that 

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:42.360
 the game sows made replace by 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:43.830
 water so why do not I do you 're there 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:46.229
 you wear it is for water because 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:48.060
 that I did that it's a bit of big c 

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:50.039
 from time to time that but such or thirty 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:52.110
 years were not water if I do any 

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:54.539
 small then to collect water otherwise 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:55.680
 all fell back then on this side 

00:04:54.539 --> 00:04:58.159
 it's a bit longer because you have to 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:58.159
 break it 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:03.810
 this side how did I do that that's it 

00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:05.880
 just it's the same thing and then 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:07.139
 just to make it a bit more stylish 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:10.500
 for the end I added aps the 

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:13.530
 random actions for a feat in 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:16.620
 does simple kemi action that noise 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:19.560
 of the explosion of one of a TNT 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:22.830
 so here is ah yes also to make 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:25.289
 for to do fire Sestrimo 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:27.419
 stop those two 10 51 and the a2 to screw the 

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:29.190
 wolf 0 so just sees 

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:36.300
 and then I just placed on the 

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:40.760
 skin so there and also I want to make a 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:43.320
 other video how to detect to system 

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:48.330
 because this is the first time 

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:49.920
 I use a potions detector so 

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:52.040
 in fact I detect 

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:54.680
 the effect of potions so do enough 

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:57.060
 for next time maybe 

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:59.100
 so here I am explaining to you how 

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:01.260
 create a laser on minecraft then 

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:03.360
 just to add a little editing the pee 

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:05.600
 wee the laser for a little more style 

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:08.700
 is progressing since stylus and has 

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:11.310
 so here we are again so I'm going to put 

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:12.900
 are not thoroughly fair to you 

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:14.640
 hear the little rail because actually 

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:16.890
 the little problem of the site on foot that 

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:19.080
 hear the rails so here I am 

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:23.520
 am inspired by simplice bow who had 

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:33.600
 a laser but made this did not exist 

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:36.480
 to turn there I did die so 

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:38.910
 so here I am sign I am yearning for 

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:40.890
 simply because he made a laser 

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:43.050
 except that he did everything with m6 said and there 

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:44.540
 I did everything with a buddy block so 

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:48.150
 here it is already finished 

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:50.900
 I had rachel of the video of simply 

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:54.170
 cerc in description 

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:54.170
 so here we go 

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:07.640
 So that's already over for 

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:10.010
 this video so we say ah 

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:11.990
 next there thank you everyone you 

00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:16.090
 are there going to the next ciao friends 

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:16.090
 and I hope this video will be more
