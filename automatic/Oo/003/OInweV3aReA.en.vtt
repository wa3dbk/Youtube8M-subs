00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:05.430
 then we will demonstrate proposition 3 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.859
 you have not because it comes 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.500
 basically definitions gtoi is 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.630
 a big I take myself to who is included 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.250
 danger we'll say here that the sukuk 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.820
 begotten by love remembers this 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.119
 notation 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:27.060
 that's the smallest this group ii g 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:27.840
 demonstration container it would be necessary 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.609
 here two things 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.579
 already that I say we are dealing with a 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:39.719
 sub group that contains to sharpen more 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:42.989
 small so we know that if I get 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:46.020
 take g which is basically and if I 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:48.239
 take hic hic is a family of this 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.309
 group ii g and well an intersection of 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.600
 all his friends from this group of seven 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.000
 families in this group will give me 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.930
 still one this group so it is normal 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.789
 that does not open during the day by ah bah 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.980
 is going to be a this group ii g who is going 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.080
 contain to since by definition it is 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.689
 interception of all subgroups 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.770
 of jets that contains to my 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.869
 the intersection of all subgroups 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.700
 already that gives fat group and in 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.159
 particular when it contains europe is 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:20.970
 past what we're going to say here we'll say 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:33.600
 that already we would plunge by one and one 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:35.850
 subgroup of g containing at because 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.140
 we have here that this set is 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.299
 intercession this group to 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.509
 the intersection this group staying at soko 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:45.479
 so that's already because it's the fact 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.680
 that it is by definition the taxation of 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.360
 all the all the subgroups that 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.710
 contains pretty much we'll say that's all 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.659
 simply is a sub group that I have 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.430
 not containing it's the first thing 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.100
 however, it should be shown here that 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.200
 it is the smallest of the blow I take h 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.360
 which is a sub group of jets that is going 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.189
 not contain and so it would take in this 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.439
 case that I establish what the sober 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.729
 Depara jean is included in h 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:08.970
 like that I will have shown that it is 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:16.010
 every time the smallest so twenty 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:29.209
 here is h 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:29.209
 so suddenly a crazy 2g group containing 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.799
 there too the definition 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:43.450
 we know that the costs incurred 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:48.159
 by these the intersection dh with h 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:49.930
 subgroup of g maybe not a 

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:51.370
 has no child task by this 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.730
 definition there all I can 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:59.319
 to say is that soul or to engender 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:00.010
 parra is a more ass and what is 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:02.019
 what it means 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:06.129
 and precisely that it is together 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:12.430
 is included in this whole group ii g 

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:14.409
 does not contain wanted a I got 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:17.170
 simply served definitions and then 

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:19.470
 of the property of the intersection of 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:19.470
