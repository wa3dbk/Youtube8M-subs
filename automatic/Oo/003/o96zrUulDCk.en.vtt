yeah<00:02:19.250> happens<00:02:20.770> Condor<00:02:21.770> Keanu<00:02:22.190> but<00:02:22.430> you

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
yeah happens Condor Keanu but you

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:27.370 
yeah happens Condor Keanu but you
gotta<00:02:23.030> have<00:02:23.180> some<00:02:23.390> some<00:02:23.870> kind<00:02:24.020> of<00:02:26.349> function<00:02:27.349> to

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
gotta have some some kind of function to

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.360 
gotta have some some kind of function to
do<00:02:27.590> I<00:02:27.620> guess

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
do I guess

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.250 
do I guess
extreme<00:02:29.910> cold<00:02:30.120> in<00:02:30.270> here<00:02:30.390> so<00:02:30.600> we<00:02:30.750> have<00:02:30.990> three

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
extreme cold in here so we have three

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:32.990 
extreme cold in here so we have three
different<00:02:31.380> heaters<00:02:31.800> all<00:02:32.520> of<00:02:32.730> which<00:02:32.850> are

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
different heaters all of which are

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.410 
different heaters all of which are
necessary<00:02:34.280> during<00:02:35.280> downtime<00:02:35.760> like<00:02:36.000> this<00:02:36.210> like

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
necessary during downtime like this like

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:37.610 
necessary during downtime like this like
right<00:02:36.570> now<00:02:36.750> we're<00:02:36.930> waiting<00:02:37.080> for<00:02:37.260> them<00:02:37.500> to

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
right now we're waiting for them to

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.440 
right now we're waiting for them to
start<00:02:37.680> drill<00:02:37.980> and<00:02:38.160> they<00:02:38.250> just<00:02:38.460> finished

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
start drill and they just finished

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.640 
start drill and they just finished
drilling<00:02:39.930> on<00:02:40.140> air<00:02:40.320> switched<00:02:40.650> over<00:02:40.830> mud<00:02:42.560> so<00:02:43.560> I'm

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
drilling on air switched over mud so I'm

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:44.870 
drilling on air switched over mud so I'm
just<00:02:43.740> waiting<00:02:43.860> around<00:02:44.040> we<00:02:44.550> watched<00:02:44.760> some

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
just waiting around we watched some

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.630 
just waiting around we watched some
movies<00:02:45.060> reads<00:02:45.600> books<00:02:46.020> keep<00:02:46.830> an<00:02:46.980> eye<00:02:47.130> on<00:02:47.310> all

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
movies reads books keep an eye on all

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.250 
movies reads books keep an eye on all
the<00:02:48.360> equipment<00:02:48.450> as<00:02:49.050> I<00:02:49.230> do<00:02:49.380> so

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.040 

these<00:02:52.739> are<00:02:52.920> rock<00:02:53.280> samples<00:02:53.760> basically<00:02:54.540> we<00:02:54.900> lay

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
these are rock samples basically we lay

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.680 
these are rock samples basically we lay
em<00:02:55.170> out<00:02:55.319> from<00:02:55.620> each<00:02:56.060> sample<00:02:57.060> that<00:02:57.330> we<00:02:57.480> take

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
em out from each sample that we take

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:58.820 
em out from each sample that we take
just<00:02:57.870> so<00:02:57.989> we<00:02:58.080> can<00:02:58.170> see<00:02:58.290> the<00:02:58.410> changes<00:02:58.800> in

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
just so we can see the changes in

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.550 
just so we can see the changes in
mythology<00:02:59.250> overall<00:02:59.940> look<00:03:00.209> cuz<00:03:00.450> if<00:03:01.110> you<00:03:01.200> go<00:03:01.319> one

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
mythology overall look cuz if you go one

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:02.059 
mythology overall look cuz if you go one
to<00:03:01.709> the<00:03:01.830> other

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069 
to the other

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:03.860 
to the other
really<00:03:02.940> don't<00:03:03.120> see<00:03:03.239> much<00:03:03.360> of<00:03:03.420> a<00:03:03.540> difference

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
really don't see much of a difference

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.990 
really don't see much of a difference
but<00:03:04.050> right<00:03:04.260> here<00:03:04.290> you<00:03:04.440> can<00:03:04.650> see<00:03:04.680> a<00:03:05.099> gradation

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
but right here you can see a gradation

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.170 
but right here you can see a gradation
from<00:03:06.660> you<00:03:06.989> know<00:03:07.160> sandstone<00:03:08.160> siltstone<00:03:08.550> and

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
from you know sandstone siltstone and

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.080 
from you know sandstone siltstone and
then<00:03:09.330> rocks<00:03:09.569> will<00:03:09.750> get<00:03:09.870> more<00:03:10.080> into<00:03:10.260> shale<00:03:11.090> so

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
then rocks will get more into shale so

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.600 
then rocks will get more into shale so
we<00:03:12.180> package<00:03:12.510> them<00:03:12.599> all<00:03:12.750> up<00:03:12.959> go<00:03:13.410> through<00:03:13.739> which

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
we package them all up go through which

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.880 
we package them all up go through which
could<00:03:14.849> be<00:03:14.940> in<00:03:15.000> two<00:03:15.120> or<00:03:15.150> three<00:03:15.269> boxes<00:03:15.569> so<00:03:16.170> we're

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
could be in two or three boxes so we're

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:18.520 
could be in two or three boxes so we're
pretty<00:03:17.010> much<00:03:17.250> halfway<00:03:17.519> down<00:03:17.760> with<00:03:17.910> the<00:03:17.970> well

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
pretty much halfway down with the well

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.320 
pretty much halfway down with the well
which<00:03:19.530> is<00:03:19.680> nice<00:03:19.860> that<00:03:20.580> it<00:03:20.700> always<00:03:20.819> lose<00:03:21.120> now

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.330 
which is nice that it always lose now

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:24.860 
which is nice that it always lose now
when<00:03:21.480> to<00:03:21.540> draw<00:03:21.720> a<00:03:21.750> month<00:03:22.019> so<00:03:23.630> don't<00:03:24.630> know<00:03:24.720> what

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
when to draw a month so don't know what

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.250 
when to draw a month so don't know what
else<00:03:25.049> to<00:03:25.250> really<00:03:26.250> tell<00:03:26.459> you<00:03:26.580> about<00:03:26.640> that

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
else to really tell you about that

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.680 
else to really tell you about that
pretty<00:03:28.260> much<00:03:28.380> what<00:03:28.590> to<00:03:28.680> do<00:03:28.769> I<00:03:29.510> might<00:03:30.510> do

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
pretty much what to do I might do

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.979 
pretty much what to do I might do
another<00:03:30.720> video<00:03:31.079> tomorrow<00:03:32.329> that<00:03:33.329> will<00:03:33.510> be<00:03:33.569> naps

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
another video tomorrow that will be naps

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:38.120 
another video tomorrow that will be naps
out<00:03:34.730> on<00:03:35.730> the<00:03:35.849> rig<00:03:36.030> but<00:03:36.360> we'll<00:03:36.870> see<00:03:37.049> have<00:03:37.950> a<00:03:37.980> good

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
out on the rig but we'll see have a good

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.190 
out on the rig but we'll see have a good
one
