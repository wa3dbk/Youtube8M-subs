educationally<00:00:56.190> I<00:00:56.250> think<00:00:56.430> that<00:00:56.550> the<00:00:56.670> book

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
educationally I think that the book

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.700 
educationally I think that the book
presents<00:00:57.239> a<00:00:57.300> very<00:00:57.420> basic<00:00:57.750> and<00:00:58.079> superficial

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
presents a very basic and superficial

00:00:58.710 --> 00:00:59.920 
presents a very basic and superficial
understanding<00:00:58.800> of<00:00:59.370> gender<00:00:59.670> stereotypes

00:00:59.920 --> 00:00:59.930 
understanding of gender stereotypes

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.420 
understanding of gender stereotypes
which<00:01:00.930> is<00:01:01.140> suitable<00:01:01.469> perhaps<00:01:01.890> for<00:01:02.129> a<00:01:02.160> younger

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
which is suitable perhaps for a younger

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.479 
which is suitable perhaps for a younger

audience the illustrations by Amy Weber

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.429 
audience the illustrations by Amy Weber
are<00:01:05.729> cartoon<00:01:06.180> style<00:01:06.510> watercolor<00:01:07.140> and<00:01:07.409> the

are cartoon style watercolor and the
cute<00:01:08.130> pictures<00:01:08.580> would<00:01:08.729> certainly<00:01:09.090> appeal<00:01:09.450> to

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
cute pictures would certainly appeal to

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.109 
cute pictures would certainly appeal to
a<00:01:09.689> younger<00:01:09.960> age<00:01:10.200> group<00:01:10.619> I<00:01:10.920> give<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:11.700> book<00:01:11.850> the

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
a younger age group I give the book the

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.690 
a younger age group I give the book the
only<00:01:12.240> boy<00:01:12.600> in<00:01:12.750> ballet<00:01:12.960> class<00:01:13.110> a<00:01:13.650> 2<00:01:13.710> out<00:01:13.979> of<00:01:14.010> 5<00:01:14.310> I

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
only boy in ballet class a 2 out of 5 I

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.580 
only boy in ballet class a 2 out of 5 I
think<00:01:15.180> that<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.600> book<00:01:15.810> presents<00:01:16.049> a<00:01:16.380> very

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
think that the book presents a very

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.320 
think that the book presents a very
young<00:01:16.830> and<00:01:17.009> superficial<00:01:17.610> understanding<00:01:17.700> of

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
young and superficial understanding of

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.539 
young and superficial understanding of
gender<00:01:18.659> stereotypes<00:01:19.290> in<00:01:19.560> some<00:01:20.130> ways<00:01:20.310> I

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
gender stereotypes in some ways I

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:21.640 
gender stereotypes in some ways I
actually<00:01:20.700> think<00:01:20.939> that<00:01:21.119> this<00:01:21.240> book<00:01:21.390> only

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:21.650 
actually think that this book only

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:23.929 
actually think that this book only
reinforces<00:01:22.650> stereotypes<00:01:22.770> about<00:01:23.369> activities

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
reinforces stereotypes about activities

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.910 
reinforces stereotypes about activities
that<00:01:24.210> boys<00:01:24.450> and<00:01:24.720> girls<00:01:24.930> are<00:01:25.080> socialized<00:01:25.530> into

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
that boys and girls are socialized into

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.789 
that boys and girls are socialized into
for<00:01:26.820> example<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.810> book<00:01:27.990> presents<00:01:28.229> Tucker's

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
for example the book presents Tucker's

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.679 
for example the book presents Tucker's
enjoyment<00:01:29.130> for<00:01:29.490> ballet<00:01:29.640> is<00:01:29.880> quite<00:01:30.180> unusual

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
enjoyment for ballet is quite unusual

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.569 
enjoyment for ballet is quite unusual

football team but only boys and these
boys<00:01:34.409> are<00:01:34.650> somewhat<00:01:34.920> rude<00:01:35.100> and<00:01:35.189> obnoxious<00:01:35.310> and

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
boys are somewhat rude and obnoxious and

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.109
