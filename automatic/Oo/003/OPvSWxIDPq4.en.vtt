00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:07.470
 drainage pump 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.320
 apparatus with a large range 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.870
 device functionality 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.450
 handle pumping them clean or 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.390
 polluted water from drainage wells 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.670
 pits and pools the pump will fit 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.920
 for draining basements and cellars 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:26.070
 eliminating the effects of utilities 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.990
 accidents and so on also a drainage pump 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.599
 can be used to provide 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.969
 water circulation in ponds and other 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.160
 reservoirs in order to determine 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:38.190
 choosing a device you need to deal with 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.950
 any water to be clean or dirty 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.710
 run the pump to determine the total volume 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.780
 pumped fluid know the depth with 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.059
 which is expected withdrawals and 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.809
 also the relief of the site from which 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.270
 is coming 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.699
 discharge water pumps for clean and 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.690
 dirty water differ in diameter by 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.980
 suction tube diameter and 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.920
 material of which are made 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.930
 parts pure water device is considered 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.680
 liquid with up to five inclusions 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.400
 millimeters 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.439
 dirty up to 35 millimeters except quality 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.619
 water the most important parameters of choice 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.750
 drainage pump are his 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:16.799
 performance and pressure 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.560
 performance shows what 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:22.380
 the volume of water is able to pump the pump into 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:25.320
 time unit is usually denoted as 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.630
 liters per hour or cubic meters per 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.240
 hour this parameter shows how much 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.909
 quickly the device can save you from 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:36.540
 water for example in the basement so in the submersible 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:39.240
 pump espa 750 d will be able to pump out 13 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:42.899
 cubic meters of water per hour and the pump and 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:46.170
 with the absolute absolute for the same hour 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:48.390
 remove water almost twice as much 18 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.790
 with half a cubic meter head 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.610
 indicator of how high nose 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:56.399
 able to raise water can be measured in 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.829
 bar atmospheres or meters given 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:01.020
 figure in drainage pumps usually 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:03.810
 small since the pumping of water 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.700
 comes from a little depth stands 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.009
 also remember that the ratio 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:11.069
 vertical and horizontal head 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:13.470
 is 1 to 10 that is if you 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:16.410
 sharpen water from the basement depth 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.690
 4m move it to 10 meters and 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.150
 then raise meter again to 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.490
 take her off the site then 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:26.280
 total set that you need 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:28.770
 for pumping must be at least six 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.020
 meters also need to pay attention to 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.890
 the fact that the pumps are height dependent 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.390
 lifting 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.910
 will work with different 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:38.070
 dependency graphics performance 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.710
 you can look at the page 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:42.840
 each product in aurora pumps in 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:45.030
 as a suction mechanism 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.459
 centrifugal pump used 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.920
 This design feature allows 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:52.170
 achieve solid performance and 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.800
 at the same time protect the device from 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:57.570
 abrasive particles in pumped water 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:59.970
 centrifugal wheels and water chambers 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:02.580
 depending on the model made of 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.980
 steel or high quality polymer 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.950
 also a distinctive feature 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.209
 submersible pump is the presence 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:11.700
 float switch 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:14.520
 or electronic first type of instrument 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:17.610
 much easier and cheaper and safer 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:20.310
 because widespread switch 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:22.110
 used to automate the process 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.350
 water transfer float switch 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:26.610
 is a small 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:28.470
 airtight container in which 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:31.019
 the contact block is located 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:33.390
 when the water level drops float 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:35.880
 goes down and turns off work 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:38.459
 electric motor preventing dry running 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:40.709
 and device failure 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:42.840
 the drainage pump should always be 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:45.570
 immersed in liquid because water is not 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.610
 only cools the pump mechanisms but also 

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:50.100
 acts as a lubricant 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:52.320
 one more important moment hoses and 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:54.690
 or pipes for pumps are selected in 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:57.330
 dependence on pressure also on 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:59.760
 diameter of the outlet nozzle 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:02.340
 the hose must not be less than the diameter 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.769
 outlet pipe compliance with this 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:07.560
 conditions will prolong service life 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:10.590
 pump and will have a beneficial effect on it 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:12.690
 performance summarize if 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:14.880
 you need a pump to work with clean 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:17.609
 water in a small area for example for 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:19.530
 watering the garden from the barrel, you can choose 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:23.310
 medium pump 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:25.710
 e.g. aurora and with p750 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:26.550
 if drainage is to be organized 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:28.860
 plot 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:31.229
 significant heights and will have to 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:33.810
 pump out large volumes of dirty water 

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:37.020
 need more serious pump 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:39.030
 for example aurora and sp 1100d 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:42.270
 inox which is able to pump 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:44.370
 liquid with a particle size up to 35 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:46.770
 millimeters whatever drainage pump 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:48.629
 produced by the group of companies aurora you 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:51.840
 not chosen you can always count 

00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:56.270
 on the high quality of the device and its 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:56.270
 long-term reliable service
