00:00:08.009 --> 00:00:13.059
 cities are the largest consumers of energy and also 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:17.189
 causes of climate change in the world but this does not have to be 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:21.490
 with his various projects the city of fraiburgo in the south of germany I have a 

00:00:21.489 --> 00:00:23.890
 green city reputation 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:26.779
 one of these projects is the solar condominium 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:31.050
 the houses have solar collectors are smart that I am not provide energy 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.960
 sufficient for daily needs but also produce energy to spare 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:43.830
 the concept not only arouses the interest of many tourists but is also the theme 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:47.090
 of the German pavilion at the Shanghai World Expo in 2010 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.650
 almost all the people who live here are interesting states that being desolate 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:53.289
 problem 

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:57.390
 therefore they do not have additional resources the five and six children 

00:00:57.389 --> 00:01:02.059
 first, then the three are actually the largest beneficiaries 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:05.059
 of this project there are certain 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:10.219
 the surplus energy can be transferred to the public energy grid 

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:13.490
 for a fixed price stipulated officially 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.490
 have sustainable energy generating profits 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:25.380
 pollution zero consumption of energy 0 this seriously chitÃ£ozinho is the name of the 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.380
 project through which architects intend to develop 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:30.790
 future 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:35.430
 the modern building materials have an importance that special ' 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.620
 years because I try to see I'm not a football coach 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:43.060
 also makes studies on new materials according to him these materials 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.120
 are perhaps more expensive than ordinary materials, but it is still worth 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.740
 feather 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.170
 from the point of view of sustainability said 'you deserve a 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.100
 little more at the beginning to simplify the heating 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.570
 research a parts replacement cleaning and repairs you recover 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.570
 within 30 years all the money invested in the construction 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:08.439
 the ecological and sophisticated architecture in both technology and design 

00:02:08.439 --> 00:02:11.400
 the new concept will transform cities 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.520
 and the sooner
