here<00:05:06.840> is<00:05:07.020> not<00:05:07.440> necessarily<00:05:08.160> but<00:05:08.880> I'll<00:05:09.270> maybe

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:09.510 
here is not necessarily but I'll maybe

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:12.680 
here is not necessarily but I'll maybe
for<00:05:09.720> a<00:05:09.780> little<00:05:09.810> while<00:05:10.050> but<00:05:10.260> not<00:05:10.500> lately<00:05:10.830> um<00:05:11.690> but

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:12.690 
for a little while but not lately um but

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:14.390 
for a little while but not lately um but
yeah<00:05:13.020> that's<00:05:13.140> a<00:05:13.229> pretty<00:05:13.380> big<00:05:13.950> fantabulous

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:14.400 
yeah that's a pretty big fantabulous

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.860
