00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.080
 us World Team 96 5 We 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:19.380
 to make our dinosaur egg 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:22.260
 to be in the premier function 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.420
 from the movie jurassic word 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.460
 The materials that we are going to use is 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.930
 Newspaper 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:32.259
 brushes 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:36.970
 brushes recycled sheets 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:39.190
 Water with resistol and paints 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:41.530
 then it's very easy ok we put the 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:44.040
 newspaper in the glass and let's go 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:46.470
 doing let's take a 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:50.070
 a complete shot of the journalist of the 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:52.800
 newspaper we will go making the cornice 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.880
 again then help me like that 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.960
 you are putting 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:59.559
 Y 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.559
 two 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:06.400
 and already have we had several layers 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:09.490
 of lines we are going to have this part that 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:11.650
 around here and no towers what will happen 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.900
 there's going to be a kind of 5,000 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:15.340
 newspaper then since it's like this we're going 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.170
 let it dry 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.810
 I think about 20 minutes and then 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:22.870
 let's start with the design the 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:25.780
 velociraptor has blue color as red 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:27.729
 then when we let it dry in 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.830
 this moment later we are going to face 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:32.800
 start with the design 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:34.930
 now let's mix the green the blue 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:38.860
 the red and the yellow 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:41.790
 what is going to come out is this color 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.790
 we start 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:54.730
 the only thing we are going to do is wait 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:59.110
 to dry a little bit to put another 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:02:01.890
 colorcito or put another color either 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.890
