00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
did they not allow us to have kill

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.910 
did they not allow us to have kill
streaks<00:01:27.390> or<00:01:27.540> scorestreaks<00:01:28.110> associated<00:01:28.799> with

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.760 
different classes you know I don't
really<00:01:30.600> know<00:01:30.840> why<00:01:30.990> they<00:01:31.170> would<00:01:31.350> do<00:01:31.439> that<00:01:31.590> i'm

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
really know why they would do that i'm

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.410 
really know why they would do that i'm

Infinity<00:01:35.490> Ward<00:01:35.700> game<00:01:35.939> a<00:01:36.119> lot<00:01:36.390> I<00:01:36.659> mean<00:01:36.960> you

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
Infinity Ward game a lot I mean you

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.270 
Infinity Ward game a lot I mean you
can't<00:01:37.200> you<00:01:37.290> can't<00:01:37.470> just<00:01:37.590> completely<00:01:37.950> ignore

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
can't you can't just completely ignore

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.679 
can't you can't just completely ignore
just<00:01:38.549> because<00:01:38.790> your<00:01:38.939> company<00:01:39.299> didn't<00:01:39.509> make<00:01:39.659> it

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
just because your company didn't make it

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.569 
just because your company didn't make it
but<00:01:40.229> I<00:01:40.290> feel<00:01:40.560> like<00:01:40.619> they<00:01:40.920> just<00:01:41.130> like<00:01:41.310> they<00:01:41.490> were

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
but I feel like they just like they were

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.370 
but I feel like they just like they were
like<00:01:41.700> I<00:01:41.880> know<00:01:42.000> I<00:01:42.210> know<00:01:42.420> they<00:01:42.810> had<00:01:42.990> to<00:01:43.110> think<00:01:43.229> of

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
like I know I know they had to think of

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.660 
like I know I know they had to think of
it<00:01:43.439> and<00:01:43.560> I<00:01:43.590> know<00:01:43.649> they<00:01:43.860> had<00:01:43.979> to<00:01:44.100> think<00:01:44.250> well

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
it and I know they had to think well

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.100 
it and I know they had to think well
let's<00:01:44.909> not<00:01:45.000> put<00:01:45.270> it<00:01:45.360> in<00:01:45.420> this<00:01:45.509> call<00:01:45.720> of<00:01:45.750> duty<00:01:46.079> I

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
let's not put it in this call of duty I

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.510 
let's not put it in this call of duty I
don't<00:01:46.380> really<00:01:46.470> see<00:01:46.740> why<00:01:46.770> they<00:01:46.979> would<00:01:47.130> do<00:01:47.340> that

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
don't really see why they would do that

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.160 
don't really see why they would do that
because<00:01:47.939> it's<00:01:48.180> obviously<00:01:48.600> an<00:01:48.750> advantage

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
because it's obviously an advantage

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.139 
because it's obviously an advantage
obviously<00:01:49.380> improves<00:01:50.070> game<00:01:50.430> better<00:01:50.640> just

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
obviously improves game better just

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.700 
obviously improves game better just
because<00:01:51.390> I<00:01:51.420> like<00:01:51.780> to<00:01:51.810> have<00:01:52.049> a<00:01:52.079> specific<00:01:52.350> class

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
because I like to have a specific class

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.950 
because I like to have a specific class
set<00:01:53.070> with<00:01:53.189> with<00:01:53.460> like<00:01:53.700> non-lethal<00:01:54.360> like<00:01:54.659> score

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
set with with like non-lethal like score

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.899 
set with with like non-lethal like score
streaks<00:01:55.259> like<00:01:55.320> UAV<00:01:55.770> counter<00:01:56.100> UAV<00:01:56.250> and<00:01:56.460> vsat

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
streaks like UAV counter UAV and vsat

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.520 
streaks like UAV counter UAV and vsat
like<00:01:57.060> I'm<00:01:57.210> using<00:01:57.390> in<00:01:57.570> this<00:01:57.659> game<00:01:57.899> play<00:01:58.110> and<00:01:58.290> I'd

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
like I'm using in this game play and I'd

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:59.990 
like I'm using in this game play and I'd
like<00:01:58.680> to<00:01:58.740> have<00:01:58.950> them<00:01:59.100> completely<00:01:59.490> set<00:01:59.759> out<00:01:59.850> for

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
like to have them completely set out for

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.490 
like to have them completely set out for
destroying<00:02:00.509> and<00:02:00.719> getting<00:02:00.899> the<00:02:00.990> most<00:02:01.170> kills

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
destroying and getting the most kills

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.920 
destroying and getting the most kills
possible<00:02:02.009> like<00:02:02.100> running<00:02:02.340> vsat<00:02:02.850> canine<00:02:03.450> swarm

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
possible like running vsat canine swarm

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.480 
possible like running vsat canine swarm
that<00:02:04.439> would<00:02:04.590> be<00:02:04.710> really<00:02:04.890> cool<00:02:05.130> i<00:02:05.189> don't<00:02:05.430> know

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
that would be really cool i don't know

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.249 
that would be really cool i don't know
why<00:02:05.640> they<00:02:05.820> wouldn't<00:02:06.000> implement<00:02:06.450> that<00:02:06.630> so<00:02:07.110> do

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
why they wouldn't implement that so do

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:08.839 
why they wouldn't implement that so do
you<00:02:07.320> think<00:02:07.380> if<00:02:07.649> call<00:02:07.920> of<00:02:08.039> duty<00:02:08.250> was<00:02:08.399> a<00:02:08.429> college

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
you think if call of duty was a college

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.729 
you think if call of duty was a college
class<00:02:09.149> that<00:02:09.569> that<00:02:10.050> you'd<00:02:10.200> be<00:02:10.349> prepared<00:02:10.709> for

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
class that that you'd be prepared for

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.290 
class that that you'd be prepared for
college<00:02:11.009> that<00:02:11.250> you<00:02:11.340> could<00:02:11.489> graduate<00:02:11.819> i<00:02:12.060> feel

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
college that you could graduate i feel

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.200 
college that you could graduate i feel
like<00:02:12.420> i<00:02:12.510> could<00:02:12.569> graduate

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210 
like i could graduate

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:14.370 
like i could graduate
an<00:02:13.270> instant<00:02:13.690> I<00:02:13.750> don't<00:02:13.930> know<00:02:13.990> if<00:02:14.080> they<00:02:14.200> didn't

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
an instant I don't know if they didn't

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:15.990 
an instant I don't know if they didn't
like<00:02:14.530> what<00:02:14.710> would<00:02:14.770> the<00:02:14.890> beginner<00:02:15.250> classes<00:02:15.640> be

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
like what would the beginner classes be

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.850 
like what would the beginner classes be
like<00:02:16.180> like<00:02:16.420> what<00:02:16.900> would<00:02:16.990> they<00:02:17.050> do<00:02:17.170> they<00:02:17.440> teach

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
like like what would they do they teach

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.740 
like like what would they do they teach
you<00:02:18.010> how<00:02:18.070> to<00:02:18.130> shoot<00:02:18.220> and<00:02:18.580> aim<00:02:18.790> or<00:02:19.090> what<00:02:19.300> well<00:02:19.720> I

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
you how to shoot and aim or what well I

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.150 
you how to shoot and aim or what well I
think<00:02:19.930> it'd<00:02:20.080> be<00:02:20.140> something<00:02:20.350> like<00:02:20.500> pueng<00:02:20.800> you'd

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
think it'd be something like pueng you'd

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.500 
think it'd be something like pueng you'd
have<00:02:21.280> to<00:02:21.400> start<00:02:21.580> out<00:02:21.670> with<00:02:21.700> pong<00:02:21.970> and<00:02:22.300> then<00:02:22.450> you

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
have to start out with pong and then you

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.390 
have to start out with pong and then you
can<00:02:22.660> move<00:02:22.750> to<00:02:22.810> like<00:02:23.020> centipede<00:02:23.560> or<00:02:23.740> astro<00:02:24.100> so

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
can move to like centipede or astro so

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.220 
can move to like centipede or astro so
you<00:02:24.460> move<00:02:24.700> up<00:02:24.850> games<00:02:25.210> it's<00:02:25.540> not<00:02:25.720> it<00:02:25.930> so<00:02:26.110> it's

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
you move up games it's not it so it's

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.440 
you move up games it's not it so it's
like<00:02:26.380> a<00:02:26.410> video<00:02:26.890> game<00:02:27.070> college<00:02:27.790> not<00:02:28.000> just<00:02:28.270> a

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:57.460 
back on the strategy of starcraft I I

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.760 
back on the strategy of starcraft I I
mean<00:04:57.880> if<00:04:58.270> you<00:04:58.480> live<00:04:58.720> in<00:04:58.750> South<00:04:59.140> Korea<00:04:59.560> or

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:01.000 
something like that mean North Korea

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.730 
something like that mean North Korea
that's<00:05:01.450> a<00:05:01.570> bit<00:05:01.810> sketchy<00:05:02.170> right<00:05:02.470> now<00:05:02.590> they

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:02.740 
that's a bit sketchy right now they

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:04.410 
that's a bit sketchy right now they
don't<00:05:02.920> throw<00:05:03.370> her<00:05:03.520> out<00:05:03.640> of<00:05:03.760> you<00:05:03.910> nukes<00:05:04.150> here

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:04.420 
don't throw her out of you nukes here

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:05.700 
don't throw her out of you nukes here
and<00:05:04.540> there<00:05:04.690> but<00:05:04.720> actually<00:05:05.320> I<00:05:05.350> don't<00:05:05.560> think

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:05.710 
and there but actually I don't think

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:06.960 
and there but actually I don't think
they've<00:05:05.800> actually<00:05:05.950> thrown<00:05:06.310> around<00:05:06.430> any<00:05:06.760> new

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:06.970 
they've actually thrown around any new

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:09.480 
they've actually thrown around any new
but<00:05:07.450> I'm<00:05:07.570> really<00:05:07.900> yeah<00:05:08.380> exactly<00:05:08.500> if<00:05:08.950> they<00:05:09.340> did

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:09.490 
but I'm really yeah exactly if they did

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:10.980 
but I'm really yeah exactly if they did
I'd<00:05:09.640> be<00:05:09.670> a<00:05:09.790> little<00:05:09.970> bit<00:05:10.150> scared<00:05:10.450> but<00:05:10.600> just<00:05:10.810> the

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:10.990 
I'd be a little bit scared but just the

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:13.140 
I'd be a little bit scared but just the
overall<00:05:11.410> strategy<00:05:12.220> of<00:05:12.310> starcraft<00:05:12.850> I<00:05:12.970> feel

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:13.150 
overall strategy of starcraft I feel

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:14.910 
overall strategy of starcraft I feel
like<00:05:13.240> Starcraft<00:05:13.750> is<00:05:13.900> much<00:05:14.080> more<00:05:14.290> a<00:05:14.500> little<00:05:14.830> bit

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:14.920 
like Starcraft is much more a little bit

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:16.590 
like Starcraft is much more a little bit
more<00:05:15.160> complicated<00:05:15.670> than<00:05:16.030> call<00:05:16.240> of<00:05:16.270> duty

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:16.600 
more complicated than call of duty

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.270 
more complicated than call of duty
because<00:05:16.750> call<00:05:17.050> of<00:05:17.200> duty<00:05:17.410> you<00:05:17.770> know<00:05:17.920> you<00:05:17.980> aim

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:18.280 
because call of duty you know you aim

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:20.280 
because call of duty you know you aim
down<00:05:18.310> the<00:05:18.580> sights<00:05:18.700> a<00:05:19.510> lot<00:05:19.750> more<00:05:19.930> than<00:05:20.080> people

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:20.290 
down the sights a lot more than people

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:21.660 
down the sights a lot more than people
really<00:05:20.500> think<00:05:20.530> it<00:05:20.800> as<00:05:20.920> some<00:05:21.100> people's<00:05:21.400> like<00:05:21.520> oh
