00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.430

 installation of plants by their zombies and 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:29.300
 what is your android system in the 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:30.859

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.839
 tutorial if you want to have it in 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:34.729
 the pc and the archives serve them for the 

00:00:32.839 --> 00:00:36.199
 computer and it serves them for your side and 

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:38.149
 if you can not download it from 

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:40.819
 usual method for what is your 

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:42.920
 android ok in the files I had 

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:44.929
 left for example is this from here that 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:48.469
 they had to decompress what weighs 300 

00:00:44.929 --> 00:00:52.339
 64 megabytes and the game's apk file 

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:55.089
 decompressed would weigh around 428 

00:00:52.339 --> 00:00:57.679
 megas this is the folder leave the folder 

00:00:55.089 --> 00:00:59.959

00:00:57.679 --> 00:01:01.729
 shown how to do the installation for 

00:00:59.959 --> 00:01:03.499
 what is the computer I am 

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:06.020
 using the same files so that 

00:01:03.499 --> 00:01:06.800
 see that I am not using any other 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.320
 archive 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.460
 what are the files that I left them and for 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.430
 that they see that the game is going to work 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:16.340
 perfectly good what we have to 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:18.080
 make the compressed file obviously 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.570
 unzip it and you will have one 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.220
 folder if the file apk these two are 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:25.100
