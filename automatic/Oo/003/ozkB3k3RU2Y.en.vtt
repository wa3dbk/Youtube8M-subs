go pick that one up there's a little

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:05.570 
go pick that one up there's a little
little<00:00:59.250> micro<00:00:59.790> line<00:01:00.030> right<00:01:00.300> there<00:01:04.580> it's

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
little micro line right there it's

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.609 
little micro line right there it's
really<00:01:05.729> it's<00:01:06.150> a<00:01:06.270> seems<00:01:06.780> to<00:01:06.990> me<00:01:07.140> like<00:01:07.170> it's<00:01:07.500> a

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
really it's a seems to me like it's a

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.830 
really it's a seems to me like it's a
smaller<00:01:08.040> scale<00:01:08.550> guitar<00:01:09.000> but<00:01:09.270> I<00:01:09.300> don't<00:01:09.570> think
