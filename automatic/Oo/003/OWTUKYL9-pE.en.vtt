00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:00.390 
again it's kind of hard you could call
the<00:01:59.200> beast<00:01:59.410> they're<00:01:59.590> pretty<00:01:59.980> now<00:02:00.130> because

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:00.400 
the beast they're pretty now because

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.220 
the beast they're pretty now because
they<00:02:00.490> put<00:02:00.670> it<00:02:00.820> on<00:02:00.940> pretty<00:02:01.330> much<00:02:01.480> already<00:02:01.780> shoes

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:02.230 
they put it on pretty much already shoes

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:05.730 
they put it on pretty much already shoes
it's<00:02:03.130> like<00:02:03.280> what<00:02:04.270> be<00:02:04.810> able<00:02:04.930> to<00:02:05.050> submit<00:02:05.290> print

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
it's like what be able to submit print

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.170 
it's like what be able to submit print
it's<00:02:05.920> almost<00:02:06.100> like<00:02:06.280> when<00:02:06.430> Nike<00:02:06.580> is<00:02:06.790> doing<00:02:07.030> with

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:07.180 
it's almost like when Nike is doing with

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.170 
it's almost like when Nike is doing with
their<00:02:07.740> Easter<00:02:08.740> egg<00:02:08.890> print<00:02:09.250> now<00:02:09.490> it's<00:02:09.729> just<00:02:10.000> a

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:10.180 
their Easter egg print now it's just a

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:13.530 
their Easter egg print now it's just a
lot<00:02:10.720> of<00:02:10.840> shoes<00:02:11.050> but<00:02:11.940> as<00:02:12.940> you<00:02:13.090> can<00:02:13.210> see<00:02:13.270> this

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
lot of shoes but as you can see this

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.110 
lot of shoes but as you can see this
shoe<00:02:13.810> is<00:02:14.020> it<00:02:14.230> exposes<00:02:14.650> the<00:02:14.980> fly<00:02:15.250> wire<00:02:15.520> unlike

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
shoe is it exposes the fly wire unlike

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.170 
shoe is it exposes the fly wire unlike
the<00:02:16.330> other<00:02:17.050> Kobe<00:02:17.530> that's<00:02:17.740> one<00:02:18.010> thing<00:02:18.820> but

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
the other Kobe that's one thing but

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.630 
the other Kobe that's one thing but
different<00:02:19.450> between<00:02:20.050> the<00:02:20.260> lead<00:02:20.530> in<00:02:20.740> a<00:02:20.860> regular

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
parts of this shoe

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:29.810 
parts of this shoe
is<00:03:25.310> yeah<00:03:26.310> and<00:03:26.840> so<00:03:27.920> it<00:03:28.920> has<00:03:29.070> the<00:03:29.220> Kobe<00:03:29.610> on<00:03:29.640> the

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:29.820 
is yeah and so it has the Kobe on the

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:32.510 
is yeah and so it has the Kobe on the
side<00:03:30.740> you<00:03:31.740> know<00:03:31.860> just<00:03:32.100> like<00:03:32.190> the<00:03:32.370> regular

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:32.520 
side you know just like the regular

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:36.170 
side you know just like the regular
Kobe's<00:03:33.330> eight<00:03:34.200> systems<00:03:34.920> but<00:03:35.820> that's<00:03:36.060> probably

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
Kobe's eight systems but that's probably

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:37.790 
Kobe's eight systems but that's probably
like<00:03:36.420> my<00:03:36.540> favorite<00:03:36.570> part<00:03:37.110> and<00:03:37.290> that's<00:03:37.410> a<00:03:37.530> lot

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:37.800 
like my favorite part and that's a lot

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.290 
like my favorite part and that's a lot
of<00:03:37.830> gonna<00:03:38.040> be<00:03:38.130> like<00:03:38.310> what<00:03:38.520> that's<00:03:38.790> ridiculous

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:39.300 
of gonna be like what that's ridiculous

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.090 
of gonna be like what that's ridiculous
but<00:03:39.450> that<00:03:39.510> that<00:03:39.960> makes<00:03:40.170> the<00:03:40.290> shoes<00:03:40.470> way<00:03:40.830> more

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
but that that makes the shoes way more

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.970 
but that that makes the shoes way more
comfortable<00:03:41.370> for<00:03:42.150> me<00:03:42.300> if<00:03:42.990> I'm<00:03:43.140> by<00:03:43.350> Kobe<00:03:43.860> it's

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
comfortable for me if I'm by Kobe it's

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:45.470 
comfortable for me if I'm by Kobe it's
because<00:03:44.250> of<00:03:44.370> confer<00:03:44.700> enough<00:03:44.940> because<00:03:45.210> of<00:03:45.360> the

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
because of confer enough because of the
