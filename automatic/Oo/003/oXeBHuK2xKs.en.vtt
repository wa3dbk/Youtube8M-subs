00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:03.139
 so let's try learn to beat in 

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:05.140
 conditions of years for early may for 

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:07.280
 example plane 

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:08.759
 would be comfortable 

00:00:08.759 --> 00:00:11.439
 I put a counter down 30 times 

00:00:11.439 --> 00:00:13.409
 and kontron for the price once 

00:00:13.409 --> 00:00:14.819
 4 5 6 7 

00:00:14.819 --> 00:00:16.899
 Seven times it means he would be right 

00:00:16.899 --> 00:00:19.899
 but if the wind were not 

00:00:22.319 --> 00:00:25.329
 m on this map the mass of the wind is east 

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:26.220
 to 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.989
 8 meters per second 

00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:30.529
 since we are flying north 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:33.330
 we will pass to the left 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:35.350
 until we take the approximate data 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.350
 bomb sight 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.040
 and now all attention to god sight 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.760
 so what you need to hit the target 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.170
 wind conditions 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.760
 and we see an empty high year 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.880
 would take down the sight to the left 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.670
 must produce shear bomb sight in 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.950
 that way in which he demolished it until then 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:05.450
 while completely frozen in place 

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:07.500
 here we see what it is left 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.650
 accordingly, we are the case of hijacking 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.150
 left 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.480
 so let's move it by 3 degrees 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.320
 how will he behave 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.610
 so sight still boards left 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.610
 blue by another three degrees 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.530
 so thousand let's see how all the bombs are going 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.280
 bombs and aim for decline 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.650
 froze 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.490
 no bobby himself little contribution 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:38.560
 right 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.530
 but never mind let us have a chip sight 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.270
 move to target 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.270
 if we see what could the sight 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.070
 exactly nowhere we are already excluded 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.070
 moving the nation 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.450
 produce 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.320
 target lock 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.780
 and at this moment we continue 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.460
 control how bombs behave 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.460
 aim 

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:14.639
 Here we have achieved the fact that we have pepper god 

00:02:14.639 --> 00:02:17.639
 smooth 

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:21.299
 all bombs ears 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:24.399
 plan until the bombs fly one more time 

00:02:24.399 --> 00:02:26.379
 something we needed 

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:28.079
 what we did 

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:29.949
 under the influence of the wind on the blower 

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:32.900
 left and bomb sight on the barrel to the left if 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.299
 our that we needed it with 

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:36.269
 manufacturers bomb sight the wrong way 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:38.019
 where we are 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:41.199
 and we did it until god and sight 

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:44.009
 bottom in place 

00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:45.089
 that's all 

00:02:45.089 --> 00:02:48.089
 see the result 

00:02:54.679 --> 00:02:57.679
 so switch 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:01.269
 relatively good
