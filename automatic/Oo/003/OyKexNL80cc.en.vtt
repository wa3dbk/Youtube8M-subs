these<00:01:46.290> are<00:01:46.649> right<00:01:47.100> here<00:01:48.060> are<00:01:48.630> a<00:01:48.689> rubber<00:01:49.140> so

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
these are right here are a rubber so

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.429 
these are right here are a rubber so
that<00:01:49.680> is<00:01:50.310> kind<00:01:51.210> of<00:01:51.329> an<00:01:51.570> interesting<00:01:51.960> sort<00:01:52.350> of

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
that is kind of an interesting sort of

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.530 
that is kind of an interesting sort of
designed<00:01:52.829> to<00:01:53.070> it<00:01:53.220> itself<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:53.850> rest<00:01:54.270> is<00:01:54.420> kind

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
designed to it itself the rest is kind

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.030 
designed to it itself the rest is kind
of<00:01:54.659> plastic<00:01:55.140> and<00:01:55.320> of<00:01:55.439> course<00:01:55.649> you've<00:01:55.799> got<00:01:55.829> the

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
of plastic and of course you've got the

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.399 
of plastic and of course you've got the
wire<00:01:56.219> frame<00:01:56.579> itself<00:01:57.000> so<00:01:57.570> when<00:01:58.020> you<00:01:58.110> put<00:01:58.229> them

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
wire frame itself so when you put them

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.590 
wire frame itself so when you put them
on<00:01:58.530> this<00:01:59.100> is<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.399> overall<00:01:59.729> look<00:02:00.119> of<00:02:00.360> course

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
on this is the overall look of course

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.480 
on this is the overall look of course
I've<00:02:00.719> got<00:02:00.840> a<00:02:00.869> hat<00:02:01.079> on<00:02:01.259> so<00:02:01.500> you<00:02:01.829> know<00:02:01.920> it<00:02:02.159> is<00:02:02.340> what

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
I've got a hat on so you know it is what

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.069 
I've got a hat on so you know it is what
it<00:02:02.759> is<00:02:02.790> it<00:02:03.030> all<00:02:03.119> kind<00:02:03.329> of<00:02:03.360> blends<00:02:03.659> in<00:02:03.899> together

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
it is it all kind of blends in together

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.050 
it is it all kind of blends in together
up<00:02:04.469> here<00:02:04.500> but<00:02:05.040> it<00:02:05.219> looks<00:02:05.430> pretty<00:02:05.490> nice<00:02:05.790> up<00:02:06.030> here

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
up here but it looks pretty nice up here

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.609 
up here but it looks pretty nice up here
you've<00:02:06.780> got<00:02:06.810> a<00:02:07.619> very<00:02:08.429> smooth

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
you've got a very smooth

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:12.910 
you've got a very smooth
and<00:02:09.890> just<00:02:10.399> lightweight<00:02:10.729> design<00:02:11.569> to<00:02:12.140> it<00:02:12.290> it<00:02:12.530> is

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
and just lightweight design to it it is

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.000 
and just lightweight design to it it is
very<00:02:13.220> much<00:02:13.400> so<00:02:13.640> small<00:02:14.569> and<00:02:14.900> doesn't<00:02:15.409> pop<00:02:15.769> out

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
very much so small and doesn't pop out

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.910 
very much so small and doesn't pop out
all<00:02:16.220> that<00:02:16.400> much<00:02:16.670> around<00:02:17.239> my<00:02:17.420> ears<00:02:17.450> and<00:02:18.049> my<00:02:18.140> ears

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
all that much around my ears and my ears

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.119 
all that much around my ears and my ears
do<00:02:19.190> fit<00:02:19.459> in<00:02:19.640> between<00:02:19.849> all<00:02:20.390> the<00:02:20.920> circular<00:02:21.920> frame

00:02:22.119 --> 00:02:22.129 
do fit in between all the circular frame

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:25.420 
do fit in between all the circular frame
of<00:02:22.340> course<00:02:22.610> so<00:02:23.299> that<00:02:23.629> is<00:02:24.230> all<00:02:24.590> good<00:02:24.950> there<00:02:25.310> you

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
of course so that is all good there you

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:26.860 
of course so that is all good there you
go<00:02:25.580> that's<00:02:25.849> what<00:02:26.030> it<00:02:26.120> looks<00:02:26.299> like<00:02:26.480> on<00:02:26.720> the

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
go that's what it looks like on the

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.039 
go that's what it looks like on the
sides<00:02:27.819> so<00:02:28.819> the<00:02:29.000> other<00:02:29.120> thing<00:02:29.209> to<00:02:29.480> note<00:02:29.750> though

00:02:30.039 --> 00:02:30.049 
sides so the other thing to note though

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:32.800 
sides so the other thing to note though
I<00:02:30.079> suppose<00:02:30.500> is<00:02:31.420> basically<00:02:32.420> I'm<00:02:32.510> going<00:02:32.629> to<00:02:32.720> go

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
I suppose is basically I'm going to go

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.600 
I suppose is basically I'm going to go
into<00:02:32.930> a<00:02:33.049> bunch<00:02:33.260> of<00:02:33.379> hypothetical<00:02:34.190> sort<00:02:34.519> of

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
into a bunch of hypothetical sort of

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.940 
into a bunch of hypothetical sort of
situations<00:02:35.480> on<00:02:35.780> the<00:02:36.049> negative<00:02:36.500> sides<00:02:36.709> again

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
situations on the negative sides again

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:38.380 
situations on the negative sides again
they're<00:02:37.099> just<00:02:37.310> like<00:02:37.459> hypothetical<00:02:38.239> in<00:02:38.360> this

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
they're just like hypothetical in this

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.390 
they're just like hypothetical in this
sort<00:02:38.750> of<00:02:38.810> the<00:02:38.959> situation<00:02:39.709> you<00:02:40.099> know<00:02:40.220> the

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
sort of the situation you know the

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.849 
sort of the situation you know the
headphones<00:02:40.760> on<00:02:41.120> my<00:02:41.299> break<00:02:41.569> oh<00:02:41.810> I<00:02:42.349> just<00:02:42.709> feel

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:42.859 
headphones on my break oh I just feel

00:02:42.859 --> 00:02:44.380 
headphones on my break oh I just feel
like<00:02:42.950> I<00:02:43.099> should<00:02:43.489> point<00:02:43.670> that<00:02:43.790> out<00:02:43.940> you<00:02:44.269> know

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
like I should point that out you know

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:45.910 
like I should point that out you know
just<00:02:44.870> to<00:02:45.049> let<00:02:45.230> you<00:02:45.319> know<00:02:45.440> what<00:02:45.620> you<00:02:45.769> all<00:02:45.890> are

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
just to let you know what you all are

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.550 
just to let you know what you all are
getting<00:02:46.430> so<00:02:46.910> of<00:02:47.090> course<00:02:47.269> we've<00:02:47.780> got<00:02:47.959> this<00:02:48.230> sort

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
getting so of course we've got this sort

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.520 
getting so of course we've got this sort
of<00:02:48.620> clamp<00:02:48.920> design<00:02:49.340> and<00:02:49.609> that's<00:02:50.480> exactly<00:02:50.930> how

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
of clamp design and that's exactly how

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.259 
of clamp design and that's exactly how
and<00:02:52.040> and<00:02:52.400> the<00:02:52.549> only<00:02:52.700> way<00:02:52.910> that<00:02:53.120> these

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:53.269 
and and the only way that these

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:56.080 
and and the only way that these
headphones<00:02:53.540> can<00:02:54.019> you<00:02:54.409> know<00:02:54.500> be<00:02:54.739> in<00:02:55.040> a<00:02:55.370> resting

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
headphones can you know be in a resting

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.210 
headphones can you know be in a resting
position<00:02:56.299> I<00:02:56.840> mean<00:02:57.019> they<00:02:57.290> can<00:02:57.650> definitely<00:02:58.129> be

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
position I mean they can definitely be

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:59.920 
position I mean they can definitely be
around<00:02:58.489> your<00:02:58.670> neck<00:02:58.879> where<00:02:59.510> they<00:02:59.720> won't

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
around your neck where they won't

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:01.420 
around your neck where they won't
necessarily<00:03:00.109> get<00:03:00.500> crushed<00:03:00.829> but<00:03:01.010> obviously

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
necessarily get crushed but obviously

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:03.309 
necessarily get crushed but obviously
within<00:03:01.640> this<00:03:01.879> sort<00:03:02.120> of<00:03:02.150> a<00:03:02.269> situation<00:03:02.450> there's

00:03:03.309 --> 00:03:03.319 
within this sort of a situation there's

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:05.559 
within this sort of a situation there's
no<00:03:03.530> folding<00:03:04.069> up<00:03:04.250> or<00:03:04.430> anything<00:03:04.519> like<00:03:04.849> that<00:03:05.000> so

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:05.569 
no folding up or anything like that so

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:08.080 
no folding up or anything like that so
you've<00:03:05.720> got<00:03:05.930> this<00:03:06.140> headband<00:03:06.829> right<00:03:07.220> and<00:03:07.459> and

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
that's great you know it's comfortable

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.160 
that's great you know it's comfortable
it<00:03:10.579> works<00:03:10.819> but<00:03:11.150> at<00:03:11.269> the<00:03:11.420> same<00:03:11.659> time<00:03:11.930> when

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
it works but at the same time when

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.319 
it works but at the same time when
you're<00:03:12.290> using<00:03:12.500> this<00:03:12.769> headband<00:03:13.340> in<00:03:13.760> a<00:03:13.970> closed

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:14.329 
you're using this headband in a closed

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:16.420 
you're using this headband in a closed
position<00:03:14.599> and<00:03:15.079> you<00:03:15.470> have<00:03:15.650> it<00:03:15.799> like<00:03:16.010> that<00:03:16.040> and

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:18.859 
maybe you have some sort of bowling ball

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:21.159 
maybe you have some sort of bowling ball
you<00:03:19.160> know<00:03:19.280> and<00:03:19.549> you<00:03:19.639> smash<00:03:20.030> it<00:03:20.269> down<00:03:20.299> like<00:03:20.900> that

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:21.169 
you know and you smash it down like that

00:03:21.169 --> 00:03:23.530 
you know and you smash it down like that
and<00:03:21.410> this<00:03:21.829> is<00:03:22.010> on<00:03:22.130> a<00:03:22.160> table<00:03:22.459> it<00:03:22.970> just<00:03:23.329> seems

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540 
and this is on a table it just seems

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.390 
and this is on a table it just seems
like<00:03:23.780> this<00:03:24.019> sort<00:03:24.260> of<00:03:24.290> headband<00:03:24.739> is<00:03:24.980> going<00:03:25.310> to

like this sort of headband is going to

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.430 
like this sort of headband is going to
break<00:03:25.609> right<00:03:26.030> I<00:03:26.269> mean<00:03:26.629> with<00:03:26.780> the<00:03:26.900> amount<00:03:27.260> of

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 
break right I mean with the amount of

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.699 
break right I mean with the amount of
force<00:03:28.340> as<00:03:28.669> well<00:03:29.120> as<00:03:29.209> just<00:03:29.359> weight<00:03:29.690> attached<00:03:30.410> to

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:30.709 
force as well as just weight attached to

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:33.039 
force as well as just weight attached to
some<00:03:30.980> sort<00:03:31.220> of<00:03:31.280> object<00:03:31.489> in<00:03:31.910> the<00:03:32.030> right<00:03:32.269> angle

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:33.049 
some sort of object in the right angle

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:34.809 
some sort of object in the right angle
and<00:03:33.230> everything<00:03:33.650> it<00:03:33.829> seems<00:03:34.250> like<00:03:34.400> this<00:03:34.579> head

00:03:34.809 --> 00:03:34.819 
and everything it seems like this head

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:37.569 
and everything it seems like this head
band<00:03:35.629> is<00:03:35.900> going<00:03:36.139> to<00:03:36.230> snap<00:03:36.440> when<00:03:37.040> I<00:03:37.069> push<00:03:37.370> it

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:37.579 
band is going to snap when I push it

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:39.750 
band is going to snap when I push it
together<00:03:37.730> it's<00:03:38.329> pretty<00:03:38.599> good<00:03:38.870> at<00:03:39.079> actually

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 
together it's pretty good at actually

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.099 
together it's pretty good at actually
forcing<00:03:40.760> more<00:03:40.970> of<00:03:41.090> the<00:03:41.180> weight<00:03:41.359> towards<00:03:41.750> the

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:42.109 
forcing more of the weight towards the

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:44.379 
forcing more of the weight towards the
bottom<00:03:42.319> here<00:03:42.799> as<00:03:42.919> you<00:03:43.370> can<00:03:43.400> see<00:03:43.549> together<00:03:44.120> and

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:44.389 
bottom here as you can see together and

00:03:44.389 --> 00:03:46.449 
bottom here as you can see together and
you<00:03:44.900> know<00:03:45.019> I'm<00:03:45.199> my<00:03:45.470> pecs<00:03:45.739> are<00:03:45.919> flexing<00:03:46.430> right

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:46.459 
you know I'm my pecs are flexing right

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:48.339 
you know I'm my pecs are flexing right
now<00:03:46.790> as<00:03:46.940> I<00:03:47.060> squeeze<00:03:47.299> this<00:03:47.510> all<00:03:47.720> together<00:03:47.900> so

00:03:48.339 --> 00:03:48.349 
now as I squeeze this all together so

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:50.890 
now as I squeeze this all together so
I'm<00:03:48.620> putting<00:03:48.980> some<00:03:49.220> good<00:03:49.400> force<00:03:49.699> there<00:03:50.000> but

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
I'm putting some good force there but

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.199 
I'm putting some good force there but
clearly<00:03:51.169> there's<00:03:51.650> no<00:03:51.859> real<00:03:52.459> weight<00:03:52.819> attached

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:53.209 
clearly there's no real weight attached

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:55.080 
clearly there's no real weight attached
to<00:03:53.480> that<00:03:53.569> so<00:03:53.840> I<00:03:53.870> mean<00:03:54.139> they're<00:03:54.290> all<00:03:54.319> good<00:03:54.650> to<00:03:54.769> go

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
to that so I mean they're all good to go

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.729 
to that so I mean they're all good to go
basically<00:03:56.090> oh<00:03:56.120> one<00:03:56.540> thing<00:03:56.569> is<00:03:56.989> that<00:03:57.199> these<00:03:57.440> do

00:03:57.729 --> 00:03:57.739 
basically oh one thing is that these do

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:00.069 
basically oh one thing is that these do
slide<00:03:58.069> up<00:03:58.220> and<00:03:58.340> down<00:03:58.430> so<00:03:59.150> they<00:03:59.269> can<00:03:59.419> adjust<00:03:59.840> as

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:00.079 
slide up and down so they can adjust as

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:02.830 
slide up and down so they can adjust as
you<00:04:00.560> can<00:04:00.709> see<00:04:00.889> right<00:04:00.919> there<00:04:01.310> that's<00:04:02.239> the<00:04:02.569> side

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 
you can see right there that's the side

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.420 
you can see right there that's the side
and<00:04:03.019> what<00:04:03.169> they<00:04:03.290> look<00:04:03.470> like<00:04:03.500> and<00:04:03.919> I<00:04:04.069> did<00:04:04.250> have

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 
and what they look like and I did have

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:06.009 
and what they look like and I did have
to<00:04:04.459> move<00:04:04.760> it<00:04:04.879> all<00:04:04.970> the<00:04:05.000> way<00:04:05.180> down<00:04:05.209> in<00:04:05.660> order<00:04:05.900> to

00:04:06.009 --> 00:04:06.019 
to move it all the way down in order to

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:09.309 
to move it all the way down in order to
properly<00:04:06.650> fit<00:04:06.980> around<00:04:07.129> my<00:04:07.370> head<00:04:07.730> um<00:04:07.970> as<00:04:08.690> you

00:04:09.309 --> 00:04:09.319 
properly fit around my head um as you

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:12.039 
properly fit around my head um as you
can<00:04:09.470> notice<00:04:09.940> though<00:04:10.940> is<00:04:11.269> that<00:04:11.299> there<00:04:11.720> is<00:04:11.870> this

00:04:12.039 --> 00:04:12.049 
can notice though is that there is this

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:14.559 
can notice though is that there is this
cord<00:04:12.410> though<00:04:12.650> right<00:04:13.280> that<00:04:13.609> for<00:04:14.030> some<00:04:14.209> people

00:04:14.559 --> 00:04:14.569 
cord though right that for some people

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:16.120 
cord though right that for some people
you<00:04:14.599> might<00:04:14.840> not<00:04:15.049> be<00:04:15.260> a<00:04:15.290> fan<00:04:15.620> of<00:04:15.650> the<00:04:15.889> cord

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 
you might not be a fan of the cord

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:17.439 
you might not be a fan of the cord
hanging<00:04:16.519> out<00:04:16.789> there<00:04:17.000> it<00:04:17.150> would<00:04:17.269> have<00:04:17.299> been

00:04:17.439 --> 00:04:17.449 
hanging out there it would have been

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:20.170 
hanging out there it would have been
nice<00:04:17.630> to<00:04:18.200> have<00:04:18.229> that<00:04:18.560> you<00:04:19.130> know<00:04:19.250> sleep<00:04:19.909> then

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:20.180 
nice to have that you know sleep then

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.510 
nice to have that you know sleep then
and<00:04:20.390> develop<00:04:20.810> into<00:04:21.260> the<00:04:21.409> wire<00:04:21.620> frame<00:04:22.039> itself

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:22.520 
and develop into the wire frame itself

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:23.200 
and develop into the wire frame itself
that

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.210 
that

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:24.999 
that
have<00:04:23.360> been<00:04:23.479> I<00:04:23.720> think<00:04:24.020> a<00:04:24.289> little<00:04:24.620> bit<00:04:24.770> more

00:04:24.999 --> 00:04:25.009 
have been I think a little bit more

00:04:25.009 --> 00:04:26.860 
have been I think a little bit more
appropriate<00:04:25.970> but<00:04:26.180> I<00:04:26.360> don't<00:04:26.509> know<00:04:26.569> again<00:04:26.840> it's

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
appropriate but I don't know again it's

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:29.710 
appropriate but I don't know again it's
just<00:04:27.139> a<00:04:27.319> another<00:04:28.009> design<00:04:28.490> standpoint<00:04:28.910> that

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:29.720 
just a another design standpoint that

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:31.570 
just a another design standpoint that
you<00:04:29.780> know<00:04:30.050> you<00:04:30.110> can<00:04:30.350> debate<00:04:30.710> about<00:04:30.889> and<00:04:31.280> of

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:31.580 
you know you can debate about and of

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:32.980 
you know you can debate about and of
course<00:04:31.910> one<00:04:32.120> of<00:04:32.150> the<00:04:32.270> things<00:04:32.539> though<00:04:32.750> is<00:04:32.960> that

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:32.990 
course one of the things though is that

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:34.839 
course one of the things though is that
when<00:04:33.259> you<00:04:33.349> close<00:04:33.650> it<00:04:33.680> all<00:04:33.949> the<00:04:34.069> way<00:04:34.220> up<00:04:34.400> I<00:04:34.639> mean

00:04:34.839 --> 00:04:34.849 
when you close it all the way up I mean

00:04:34.849 --> 00:04:37.600 
when you close it all the way up I mean
this<00:04:35.300> is<00:04:35.410> more<00:04:36.410> than<00:04:36.440> likely<00:04:36.830> not<00:04:37.190> going<00:04:37.220> to<00:04:37.490> be

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:37.610 
this is more than likely not going to be

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:39.370 
this is more than likely not going to be
the<00:04:37.759> situation<00:04:37.940> how<00:04:38.599> you<00:04:38.660> wear<00:04:38.960> these<00:04:39.110> unless

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:39.380 
the situation how you wear these unless

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:40.600 
the situation how you wear these unless
you're<00:04:39.560> a<00:04:39.620> little<00:04:39.860> kid<00:04:40.009> or<00:04:40.160> something<00:04:40.190> like

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:40.610 
you're a little kid or something like

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:42.400 
you're a little kid or something like
that<00:04:40.669> have<00:04:40.940> a<00:04:40.970> small<00:04:41.270> head<00:04:41.479> so<00:04:41.960> you<00:04:41.990> can<00:04:42.139> go

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:42.410 
that have a small head so you can go

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:44.710 
that have a small head so you can go
ahead<00:04:42.530> and<00:04:42.710> see<00:04:43.069> that<00:04:43.250> the<00:04:43.490> the<00:04:43.819> cord<00:04:44.240> where's

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:44.720 
ahead and see that the the cord where's

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.809 
ahead and see that the the cord where's
the<00:04:44.990> light<00:04:45.229> let's<00:04:45.650> adjust<00:04:46.160> the<00:04:46.370> light<00:04:46.580> you

00:04:46.809 --> 00:04:46.819 
the light let's adjust the light you

00:04:46.819 --> 00:04:49.059 
the light let's adjust the light you
know<00:04:46.940> Wow<00:04:47.150> bright<00:04:47.930> all<00:04:48.530> right<00:04:48.650> so<00:04:48.860> you<00:04:48.919> got

00:04:49.059 --> 00:04:49.069 
know Wow bright all right so you got

00:04:49.069 --> 00:04:51.490 
know Wow bright all right so you got
that<00:04:49.310> cord<00:04:49.669> there<00:04:49.940> and<00:04:50.150> so<00:04:50.750> that<00:04:51.050> cord<00:04:51.349> is

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:51.500 
that cord there and so that cord is

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.830 
that cord there and so that cord is
actually<00:04:51.919> blocking<00:04:52.190> you<00:04:52.639> know<00:04:52.759> part<00:04:53.120> of<00:04:53.270> your

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:53.840 
actually blocking you know part of your

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:55.810 
actually blocking you know part of your
your<00:04:54.139> rubber<00:04:54.380> piece<00:04:54.680> right<00:04:54.949> here<00:04:54.979> and<00:04:55.460> you

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:55.820 
your rubber piece right here and you

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:57.189 
your rubber piece right here and you
don't<00:04:56.000> necessarily<00:04:56.150> want<00:04:56.449> that<00:04:56.810> on<00:04:57.020> the

00:04:57.189 --> 00:04:57.199 
don't necessarily want that on the

00:04:57.199 --> 00:04:59.110 
don't necessarily want that on the
emblem<00:04:57.560> you<00:04:57.800> know<00:04:57.919> you<00:04:57.979> don't<00:04:58.190> want<00:04:58.550> that<00:04:58.759> to

00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.120 
emblem you know you don't want that to

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:00.820 
emblem you know you don't want that to
be<00:04:59.300> like<00:04:59.509> that<00:04:59.750> now<00:05:00.199> that's<00:05:00.380> not<00:05:00.530> going<00:05:00.710> to<00:05:00.800> be

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:00.830 
be like that now that's not going to be

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:04.930 
be like that now that's not going to be
the<00:05:01.130> the<00:05:01.580> situation<00:05:02.330> all<00:05:02.780> the<00:05:03.199> time<00:05:03.669> you<00:05:04.669> can

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:04.940 
the the situation all the time you can

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:07.060 
the the situation all the time you can
force<00:05:05.270> that<00:05:05.479> cord<00:05:05.810> is<00:05:06.050> just<00:05:06.440> a<00:05:06.530> little<00:05:06.740> cord

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:07.070 
force that cord is just a little cord

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:11.920 
force that cord is just a little cord
through<00:05:07.990> onto<00:05:08.990> an<00:05:09.410> in<00:05:09.889> between<00:05:10.120> the<00:05:11.120> wire

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:11.930 
through onto an in between the wire

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:14.200 
through onto an in between the wire
frame<00:05:12.349> and<00:05:12.620> the<00:05:12.889> headphone<00:05:13.310> itself<00:05:13.580> so<00:05:14.060> you'd

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:14.210 
frame and the headphone itself so you'd

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:16.899 
frame and the headphone itself so you'd
never<00:05:14.509> actually<00:05:14.810> see<00:05:15.289> it<00:05:15.550> standing<00:05:16.550> out<00:05:16.669> and

00:05:16.899 --> 00:05:16.909 
never actually see it standing out and

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:18.310 
never actually see it standing out and
getting<00:05:17.150> in<00:05:17.240> the<00:05:17.360> way<00:05:17.479> of<00:05:17.509> the<00:05:17.690> emblem<00:05:18.080> like<00:05:18.229> I

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:18.320 
getting in the way of the emblem like I

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:20.140 
getting in the way of the emblem like I
did<00:05:18.500> right<00:05:18.770> there<00:05:18.800> but<00:05:19.520> more<00:05:19.940> than<00:05:20.000> likely

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:20.150 
did right there but more than likely

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:22.300 
did right there but more than likely
you'll<00:05:20.539> never<00:05:20.750> even<00:05:20.930> notice<00:05:21.349> it<00:05:21.560> when<00:05:22.009> it's<00:05:22.190> on

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:22.310 
you'll never even notice it when it's on

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:23.740 
you'll never even notice it when it's on
the<00:05:22.430> side<00:05:22.639> of<00:05:22.669> your<00:05:22.819> headphones<00:05:23.330> you<00:05:23.509> know<00:05:23.599> you

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:23.750 
the side of your headphones you know you

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:25.120 
the side of your headphones you know you
have<00:05:23.900> to<00:05:23.990> have<00:05:24.110> your<00:05:24.199> girlfriend<00:05:24.650> adjust<00:05:24.979> it

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:25.130 
have to have your girlfriend adjust it

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:26.770 
have to have your girlfriend adjust it
if<00:05:25.159> you<00:05:25.370> really<00:05:25.610> care<00:05:26.180> about<00:05:26.210> the<00:05:26.539> way<00:05:26.630> that

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:26.780 
if you really care about the way that

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:29.469 
if you really care about the way that
you<00:05:26.900> look<00:05:27.080> in<00:05:27.229> that<00:05:27.259> much<00:05:27.979> detail<00:05:28.250> right<00:05:28.820> so<00:05:29.330> of

00:05:29.469 --> 00:05:29.479 
you look in that much detail right so of

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:31.839 
you look in that much detail right so of
course<00:05:29.539> that's<00:05:29.990> just<00:05:30.080> again<00:05:30.560> one<00:05:31.099> minor

00:05:31.839 --> 00:05:31.849 
course that's just again one minor

00:05:31.849 --> 00:05:34.330 
course that's just again one minor
little<00:05:32.270> thing<00:05:32.630> I<00:05:33.080> thought<00:05:33.889> there<00:05:34.070> was<00:05:34.190> like

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:34.340 
little thing I thought there was like

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:36.399 
little thing I thought there was like
one<00:05:34.520> more<00:05:34.669> oh<00:05:34.820> yeah<00:05:34.970> so<00:05:35.479> as<00:05:35.599> far<00:05:35.840> as<00:05:35.900> the<00:05:36.169> way<00:05:36.289> of

00:05:36.399 --> 00:05:36.409 
one more oh yeah so as far as the way of

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:37.839 
one more oh yeah so as far as the way of
these<00:05:36.530> headphones<00:05:36.800> work<00:05:37.220> you<00:05:37.370> can<00:05:37.520> see<00:05:37.699> that

00:05:37.839 --> 00:05:37.849 
these headphones work you can see that

00:05:37.849 --> 00:05:40.149 
these headphones work you can see that
the<00:05:38.330> way<00:05:38.479> that<00:05:38.960> they<00:05:39.169> stop<00:05:39.469> it<00:05:39.680> doesn't<00:05:39.979> seem

00:05:40.149 --> 00:05:40.159 
the way that they stop it doesn't seem

00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:41.350 
the way that they stop it doesn't seem
like<00:05:40.190> they<00:05:40.490> stopped<00:05:40.820> because<00:05:41.120> of<00:05:41.270> the

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:41.360 
like they stopped because of the

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:44.140 
like they stopped because of the
wireframe<00:05:41.960> here<00:05:42.259> where<00:05:42.500> these<00:05:43.150> actual

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:44.150 
wireframe here where these actual

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:47.260 
wireframe here where these actual
headphones<00:05:44.570> themselves<00:05:45.280> stop<00:05:46.280> it's<00:05:46.639> like<00:05:47.090> it

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:47.270 
headphones themselves stop it's like it

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:48.969 
headphones themselves stop it's like it
seems<00:05:47.479> like<00:05:47.719> it's<00:05:47.870> being<00:05:48.110> tugged<00:05:48.440> on<00:05:48.740> the

00:05:48.969 --> 00:05:48.979 
seems like it's being tugged on the

00:05:48.979 --> 00:05:51.399 
seems like it's being tugged on the
court<00:05:49.219> itself<00:05:49.550> so<00:05:49.759> that<00:05:49.789> that<00:05:50.090> cord<00:05:50.509> stops<00:05:51.169> a

00:05:51.399 --> 00:05:51.409 
court itself so that that cord stops a

00:05:51.409 --> 00:05:53.200 
court itself so that that cord stops a
headphone<00:05:51.740> from<00:05:51.979> continuing<00:05:52.580> but<00:05:52.789> I<00:05:52.820> mean<00:05:53.090> if

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:53.210 
headphone from continuing but I mean if

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:54.640 
headphone from continuing but I mean if
you<00:05:53.270> get<00:05:53.419> another<00:05:53.659> bash<00:05:53.930> or<00:05:54.229> another<00:05:54.440> object

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:54.650 
you get another bash or another object

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:56.830 
you get another bash or another object
and<00:05:55.039> again<00:05:55.280> the<00:05:55.880> headphone<00:05:56.240> got<00:05:56.389> stuck<00:05:56.659> like

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:56.840 
and again the headphone got stuck like

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:57.850 
and again the headphone got stuck like
that<00:05:56.900> it<00:05:57.139> seems<00:05:57.349> like<00:05:57.500> you<00:05:57.530> would<00:05:57.710> have<00:05:57.740> a

00:05:57.850 --> 00:05:57.860 
that it seems like you would have a

00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:59.920 
that it seems like you would have a
situation<00:05:58.099> where<00:05:58.639> the<00:05:58.759> headphone<00:05:59.120> could<00:05:59.330> snap

00:05:59.920 --> 00:05:59.930 
situation where the headphone could snap

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:02.499 
situation where the headphone could snap
that<00:06:00.229> cord<00:06:00.620> which<00:06:00.800> would<00:06:01.009> be<00:06:01.190> a<00:06:01.370> bad<00:06:01.940> situation

00:06:02.499 --> 00:06:02.509 
that cord which would be a bad situation

00:06:02.509 --> 00:06:05.469 
that cord which would be a bad situation
at<00:06:03.169> that<00:06:03.500> but<00:06:04.070> generally<00:06:04.550> speaking<00:06:04.580> that<00:06:05.000> is

00:06:05.469 --> 00:06:05.479 
at that but generally speaking that is

00:06:05.479 --> 00:06:08.529 
at that but generally speaking that is
about<00:06:06.169> it<00:06:06.530> that<00:06:06.770> I<00:06:06.800> can<00:06:07.130> figure<00:06:07.880> out<00:06:07.969> out<00:06:08.389> of

00:06:08.529 --> 00:06:08.539 
about it that I can figure out out of

00:06:08.539 --> 00:06:10.540 
about it that I can figure out out of
these<00:06:08.659> headphones<00:06:08.900> and<00:06:09.349> and<00:06:09.560> maybe<00:06:09.979> just<00:06:10.280> some

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:48.210 
block out some of the background noise

00:07:48.210 --> 00:07:51.709 
block out some of the background noise
it<00:07:49.050> uh<00:07:49.080> it's<00:07:49.650> not<00:07:50.009> an<00:07:50.279> extreme<00:07:50.880> amount<00:07:51.120> by<00:07:51.360> any

00:07:51.709 --> 00:07:51.719 
it uh it's not an extreme amount by any

00:07:51.719 --> 00:07:53.930 
it uh it's not an extreme amount by any
means<00:07:51.930> but<00:07:52.199> it's<00:07:52.380> like<00:07:52.560> it's<00:07:52.860> good<00:07:53.250> enough<00:07:53.610> you

00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:53.940 
means but it's like it's good enough you

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:57.080 
means but it's like it's good enough you
know<00:07:54.090> it<00:07:54.360> helps<00:07:54.770> reduce<00:07:55.770> the<00:07:56.159> background

00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:57.090 
know it helps reduce the background

00:07:57.090 --> 00:08:00.439 
know it helps reduce the background
noise<00:07:57.330> which<00:07:57.719> is<00:07:57.870> always<00:07:58.050> a<00:07:58.199> welcome<00:07:58.860> to<00:07:59.449> all

00:08:00.439 --> 00:08:00.449 
noise which is always a welcome to all

00:08:00.449 --> 00:08:03.740 
noise which is always a welcome to all
right<00:08:00.690> so<00:08:01.310> basically<00:08:02.310> I<00:08:02.389> gotta<00:08:03.389> say<00:08:03.630> that's

00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:03.750 
right so basically I gotta say that's

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:05.930 
right so basically I gotta say that's
about<00:08:04.080> it<00:08:04.110> so<00:08:04.529> there<00:08:05.159> you<00:08:05.279> go<00:08:05.310> if<00:08:05.610> you<00:08:05.699> have<00:08:05.789> any
