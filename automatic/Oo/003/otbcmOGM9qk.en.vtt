out the little area around it and let's
tnt<00:01:50.369> is<00:01:51.369> different<00:01:52.110> because<00:01:53.110> if<00:01:53.530> I<00:01:53.650> place<00:01:53.920> TNT

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
tnt is different because if I place TNT

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:59.180 
tnt is different because if I place TNT
