00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 I am gustavo from when first point sy 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.970
 I'm in a technical workshop 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:10.019
 specialized in continuous systems of 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:13.349
 computing with living lidÃ©n was in 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:16.410
 a talk an installation paper 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:21.320
 of the continuous system mx 371 is a team 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:24.960
 new very similar to m 21 10 21 20 and 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:28.289
 I want to make you some concerns as you 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.300
 it seemed this training and what 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.710
 parts learned from different from their 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.710
 method and details 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:39.020
 or the LIE pleasure how are you 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:42.010
 this for me is a pleasure to be in this 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:44.199
 talk really helped me 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:46.899
 the techniques of how to prepare 

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:50.710
 cartridges how to make sure that the 

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:54.760
 cartridges in their operation do not damage 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:57.789
 the printer despite the treatment of 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:01.089
 user also how to prepare the possible 

00:00:57.789 --> 00:01:01.920
 logo on the corks that go to the 

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:04.239
 cartridges 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.060
 including the tips that get into the 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:09.810
 cartridges in the diagonal cut that is 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:12.759
 something that in the particular did not know 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.909
 this now with these new techniques 

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:18.460
 we can be a little more prepared 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:20.679
 for the eventuality they may suggest 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:23.280
 how to present yourself with means with the 

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:26.380
 time and maybe avoid them and not possible 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:29.020
 not particular have served much for 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.759
 that all of how to make this system 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:34.680
 in this type of investor with which 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:36.840
 we were very worried about what 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:41.580
 to be able to offer a better product to 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:44.520
 client and that the client the idea the idea 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:46.850
 is good is to analyze the risks and 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:50.130
 keep critical points under control 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:53.760
 of the printers then here we have 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:57.330
 the printer that we have worked is a 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:02:00.810
 little unarmed this but definitely 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:02.520
 the steps are there and the results are 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.500
 let see for yourself here we start 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.020
 an impression 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.940
 of the quality as we are working on 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.740
 original and copy 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.630
 look if they had to give a 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:16.920
 rating from 1 to 10 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:19.550
 how much would be 10 times 10 out of 10 and ready 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.550
 many thanks
