00:00:03.437 --> 00:00:04.698
 Good Morning! 

00:00:05.177 --> 00:00:08.554
 I have rested brilliantly and I am again one hundred percent 

00:00:08.589 --> 00:00:11.166
 for my second and last day of skiing. 

00:00:11.201 --> 00:00:16.433
 I got up very early to arrive at Winter Fountains as soon as possible, 

00:00:16.433 --> 00:00:17.292
 in the council of Aller. 

00:00:17.527 --> 00:00:19.412
 And ... how could it be less, 

00:00:19.711 --> 00:00:21.212
 it's snowing! 

00:00:47.585 --> 00:00:49.678
 -Awesome! What is your name? 

00:00:49.713 --> 00:00:50.410
 -Javi. 

00:00:50.571 --> 00:00:51.521
 -I'm cristina. 

00:00:51.556 --> 00:00:54.292
 Well, you left me very impressed with what I just saw. 

00:00:54.327 --> 00:00:55.503
 - It will not be for so much. 

00:00:55.538 --> 00:00:59.661
 -This has to be very cool to do but quite dangerous. 

00:01:00.128 --> 00:01:00.627
 -Do not 

00:01:00.627 --> 00:01:02.182
 -No no? 

00:01:02.183 --> 00:01:05.485
 -No, with a good teacher to show you and take you out for a walk ... 

00:01:06.209 --> 00:01:07.497
 - Do you think I could ...? 

00:01:07.532 --> 00:01:08.859
 Well, no, no, no laughing. 

00:01:09.287 --> 00:01:12.186
 Try something like that? I have never put a board on my feet. 

00:01:12.195 --> 00:01:14.533
 How many years have you been doing Snow? 

00:01:14.706 --> 00:01:15.578
 -Ones 12. 

00:01:17.498 --> 00:01:19.424
 -When nobody was still here, or what? 

00:01:20.038 --> 00:01:20.841
 -Well, no... 

00:01:20.841 --> 00:01:23.256
 - There were more people? -... I'm one of those who started later. 

00:01:23.295 --> 00:01:24.714
 -There were a few yes. 

00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:27.895
 -What does it take to be a good snowboarder? 

00:01:30.192 --> 00:01:31.330
 -Many physicist ... 

00:01:33.577 --> 00:01:34.592
 a lot of skill ... 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.581
 that you do well and you want. That you like, mainly that you like it. 

00:01:38.582 --> 00:01:39.748
 - Hobby and balance. 

00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:40.735
 -And many hours. 

00:01:42.935 --> 00:01:45.466
 Well I've already taken a little walk on my own 

00:01:45.501 --> 00:01:48.500
 but I think that to know the Station properly, 

00:01:48.535 --> 00:01:50.108
 No one better than its director. 

00:01:50.143 --> 00:01:53.957
 So I have stayed with Jorge Fernández who is waiting for me on the chairlift. 

00:01:53.992 --> 00:01:55.353
 I have to get the ticket. 

00:01:58.067 --> 00:02:03.400
 -Jorge you have to make me a tour guide because it's an experience to get on this chairlift 

00:02:03.435 --> 00:02:04.658
 What are we watching? 

00:02:05.059 --> 00:02:07.921
 -The zone that transits from the lower part of the station 

00:02:07.956 --> 00:02:10.473
 that I take to comment that it is 1,500m high 

00:02:10.508 --> 00:02:12.014
 to go to the intermediate zone. 

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:16.483
 The route runs through an area of ​​beech and birch forest. 

00:02:16.518 --> 00:02:18.730
 On the days that there is a little more snow than today 

00:02:18.765 --> 00:02:22.199
 It is normal to see downhill skiers in any area, 

00:02:22.234 --> 00:02:24.777
 as we are seeing in these areas that we have here. 

00:02:24.812 --> 00:02:28.661
 -From what I see, beauty is one of the things that distinguish Winter sources. 

00:02:28.696 --> 00:02:33.899
 - What other things can we highlight that differentiate it from other stations? 

00:02:33.934 --> 00:02:39.342
 - I am sure that each station has its own peculiarities and its points of interest. 

00:02:39.377 --> 00:02:42.777
 From Winter Sources what we can say is that it is a really alpine station, 

00:02:42.812 --> 00:02:46.612
 being understood as such that the peaks are of rough forms, 

00:02:46.647 --> 00:02:48.052
 that there are steep slopes ... 

00:02:48.087 --> 00:02:53.011
 But at the same time it also has a variety of really interesting tracks, 

00:02:53.046 --> 00:02:56.697
 arranging from the easiest for those who start to the most difficult, 

00:02:56.732 --> 00:02:58.497
 which are the tracks of black color. 

00:03:02.451 --> 00:03:04.454
 -What is what we are seeing? 

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:07.933
 -The intermediate zone of the Station. 

00:03:08.102 --> 00:03:13.775
 From here we have on the left side the tape that also gives access 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.174
 the debutants area and to this side we have the other two chairlifts 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:21.442
 that make up the total ski lifts of the station. 

00:03:21.477 --> 00:03:23.270
 That is, we have the three zones: 

00:03:23.305 --> 00:03:24.163
 debutants area, 

00:03:24.198 --> 00:03:27.162
 intermediate zone of more or less affordable difficulty and 

00:03:27.197 --> 00:03:29.664
 the area already of high difficulty that is the Llomba chairlift. 

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:30.786
 -For every taste. 

00:03:31.644 --> 00:03:33.053
 Thank you very much Jorge 

00:03:33.088 --> 00:03:36.931
 And of course this has been the first time but it will not be the last, I will come back. 

00:03:36.966 --> 00:03:38.402
 - I hope, see you here very soon. 

00:03:38.402 --> 00:03:39.173
 -Thank you! 

00:03:40.197 --> 00:03:44.516
 It's already 5:30 in the afternoon and the tracks are about to close, 

00:03:44.551 --> 00:03:45.742
 what a pity! 

00:03:46.092 --> 00:03:49.060
 The truth is that it has been a perfect weekend. 

00:03:49.095 --> 00:03:51.556
 I leave with a very good impression of Winter Fountains, 

00:03:51.591 --> 00:03:55.011
 It is a fantastic station and I can not wait to go back. 

00:03:55.046 --> 00:03:57.229
 Does anyone else sign up for the next one? 

00:03:57.727 --> 00:03:59.303
 See you very soon!
