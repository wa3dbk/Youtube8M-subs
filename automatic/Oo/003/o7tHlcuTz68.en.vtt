00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:08.830
 so what is it that notes and well notes form the foundation of 

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:13.530
 our western music system and easter besides one to concentrate 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.349
 before many other music systems 

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:17.820
 it's a bit like alphabet 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.869
 for a language we can always 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:23.589
 to succeed in speaking a language without knowing how to decipher high in lyon 

00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:25.060
 know the letters of the alphabet 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.410
 disregard the alphabet of a slow again once again great doors of 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:29.949
 great possibilities 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:30.910
 strange more 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:34.840
 the advantage of music is like typing 26 or more letters for us 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.850
 linger on the con we hasten that this note in all and for all 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.740
 hence the presence of operations but 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:44.630
 we will see in the second part so very easy to take 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:48.480
 his reach of anyone stumbling is not much to understand at the beginning 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.500
 it's after that it's going to get complicated when we're going to see all of them apply to 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:52.710
 music 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.340
 so our this basic note 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.250
 is that everyone knows already i think dorignies face the swiss 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:03.200
 it is a cyclical system that has typed the same way. 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.730
 bears resume is put face to the cider house of it 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:07.280
 et cetera 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.549
 first important tip that will really really serve you later 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:11.510
 believe me 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:13.680
 learn to recite them to 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.580
 that is to say, all of us to say doremi to sudo and it is a very rare fact 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.940
 do you tell others if the only family veto 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.580
 learn the parker in one direction then in the other 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.380
 it will help you a lot later 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.390
 then you have to talk about the interval 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.280
 an interval is a difference in pitch between notes when playing notes 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:32.969
 self-love twice the same note 

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:35.710
 not a serious gap that will be more acute 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.580
 well this gap between these two can not be bigger or bigger or 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:44.350
 less small and we will quantify it in terms of tone and 2 half-turn 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.250
 we say for example interrupt the note whose clip will be your tone 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.080
 so I think I will not surprise anyone by saying that when we 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.620
 settles down decomposed into two 2 microns 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:56.289
 and the smaller cons 

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:59.749
 manipur with our notes it will be a little stiff half your contract not a quarter of 

00:01:59.749 --> 00:02:00.330
 tower 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.150
 in the notes 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:03.530
 another tip 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.530
 second tip that will serve you a lot a lot a lot 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:09.859
 so I was asking myself to apply right away 

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:13.409
 every time you talk you will read that you will calculate in 

00:02:13.409 --> 00:02:16.569
 the interval anton convert the om in 2004 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:20.270
 there is also to be between these two classes actually becomes more intense 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:24.159
 maybe ten ask somewhere that it's half-time 

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:27.980
 you will very often need to do the conversion between the tones and the 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:28.510
 metals 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.139
 so train right now 

00:02:30.139 --> 00:02:33.319
 devote for at intervals by converting the half-time tone 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:35.830
 systematically it will give you a lot later 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:37.609
 especially if you are a guitarist 

00:02:37.609 --> 00:02:41.279
 so let's take our notes now and we work and put all 

00:02:41.279 --> 00:02:43.419
 together to make a great mix 

00:02:43.419 --> 00:02:46.570
 we will resume the notes doubled against the sidr 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:49.730
 try to see what are the intervals that went through all this 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:50.379
 case 

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:52.019
 so we take them in order 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:55.019
 and between each note we will find anton 

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:56.689
 between them 

00:02:56.689 --> 00:03:00.659
 mifare that we will have Hamilton and between 6 and water we will not put your 

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:02.350
 that makes us 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:04.619
 golden pandemic anton 

00:03:04.619 --> 00:03:07.389
 a bridge but the uefa in 2002 

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:10.889
 facing wolverhampton solar a bridge the ssii 

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:11.710
 anton 

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:14.689
 and if the back to finish a half-turn 

00:03:14.689 --> 00:03:17.930
 it absolutely must absolutely know it 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:21.989
 parker if you are not able to pull them out like that without hesitation 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:25.680
 you will have trouble then take time so you repeat where all 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.029
 the days like a poetry you learn at school when we were 

00:03:28.029 --> 00:03:28.849
 small 

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:30.269
 you have to know him 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:32.839
 by heart it will be an automatism 

00:03:32.839 --> 00:03:35.459
 a small mnemonic device to remember 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:39.599
 there is however each note but there is not a half-turn after another on the track 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:42.370
 dir after him we have a microphone up to the lighthouse 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.269
 and after American cinema 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:46.589
 up to double 

00:03:46.589 --> 00:03:50.139
 also try to make or consider 

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:51.310
 between the rer 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:54.569
 eidos who is right before we also have a too talented tone in hand to find 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:57.339
 so we kind of pushed a little symmetrically 

00:03:57.339 --> 00:04:00.089
 we'll talk about it for a moment, it's something very 

00:04:00.089 --> 00:04:01.959
 important to see at this level 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:04.639
 last thing to say about integrators to afp 

00:04:04.639 --> 00:04:08.409
 they are all there that we can add them so for example opened 

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:11.229
 some intervals between water emission 

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:13.640
 well we take the drink between douliÃ©ry which makes 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:14.459
 A bridge 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:17.070
 we will take between reissue that makes a bridge 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.539
 no against all the millions da 

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:21.859
 it is possible that it 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:27.090
 while taking care of a little trick to see if we leave tomorrow our back and 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.629
 we're going to our country right after 

00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:32.620
 we have as much as as calculated 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.919
 but if we talk trulli and we want to go back just before his daughter 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:38.180
 the network 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:40.740
 we always have a bigger tone is always 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:42.029
 two options 

00:04:42.029 --> 00:04:45.679
 but if now we wanted to do something different compared to our country 

00:04:45.679 --> 00:04:49.959
 and that we went up to the next back prouzet mini shapes the so do 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:52.610
 well there are no more holes 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:55.610
 so you have to pay attention to this little part that will really be 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:58.880
 use it later when you apply without on instruments 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:01.020
 but in the meantime the minima of all 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:02.360
 between thousands of euros 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:05.439
 we have everything in transparency and we have no background in the sense 

00:05:05.439 --> 00:05:07.050
 we are all together capcom 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:08.999
 what's called a complementary interval 

00:05:08.999 --> 00:05:12.919
 we will talk more in detail in the course on intervals will hold 

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:14.379
 after this race 

00:05:14.379 --> 00:05:18.099
 but know it already that on the fate of their course our notes the intervals 

00:05:18.099 --> 00:05:21.020
 are not always the same but always together 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:23.810
 train yourself already a little bit has calculated the authors between the 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:25.710
 different notes manipulated all that 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:28.830
 and that we do not feel ready and that you could find station let's go to 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:30.480
 the second part to complicate things a little
