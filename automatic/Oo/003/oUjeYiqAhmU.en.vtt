00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:10.610
 let's talk about the sinus lift now 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:13.230
 maxillary is a surgical technique 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:15.780
 aimed at increasing the quantity of bone 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.430
 in the upper dairy sectors of the cable 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.470
 oral therefore in correspondence of the first one 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.820
 and second premolar of the first second 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.710
 higher morality 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:26.680
 can be followed both with access 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:28.449
 crystal and who with side access in 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:31.240
 Crestal access case also comes 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:33.220
 defined as mini or small rise in case 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:36.480
 side access is defined 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:36.480
 large sinus lift 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.370
 usually the big sinus lift 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:44.769
 maxillary is preferred when the 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:48.250
 large residual quantity available in 

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:51.269
 vertical direction is less than 4 mm 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:53.650
 while otherwise it is preferred 

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:57.250
 carry out the small sinus lift 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:59.770
 maxillary being a technique of 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:02.260
 increase in the volume of the quantity 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:05.530
 bone involves the use of material of 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:08.140
 graft can be used both bone 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:11.380
 autologous ie on the patient both bone 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:13.840
 heterologous ie bone originating from others 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:16.990
 animal species then bovine bone which 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:23.410
 not pig or nestor materials here 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:25.960
 synthetic due to the excellent percentage of 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:28.240
 success that is achieved today by using 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:31.180
 asset and pay the use of or acquitted 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:33.580
 they are almost abandoned too 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.380
 because I foresee a withdrawal area with 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.659
 consequent greater annoyance on the part 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.009
 of the patient 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:42.250
 now we also address the discourse of the 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:45.820
 healing time in case of increases in 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:48.909
 maxillary sinus if using his kit e 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:51.159
 rolo and a technique of 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:54.280
 side access for sinus lift 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:57.790
 maxillary healing time 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:59.200
 of the graft is generally nine months 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:01.540
 after these nine months 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.970
 implants can be inserted i 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:08.229
 which tend to heal in 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:12.190
 then another six months the total time 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:14.170
 between the first phase of grafting inside 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:17.200
 of the maxillary sinus elevation the second 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:20.290
 phase ie the insertion of the implants 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.300
 dental and their healing is about 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.580
 15 months 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:27.670
 this must be kept in mind to explain 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:29.670
 good to the patient especially if you want 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:32.980
 to address this surgical method 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:36.370
 to arrive at a rehabilitation that 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:39.390
 it is usually a fixed type in the case of 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:42.010
 rise in breast via crystal e access 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:44.860
 this is done contextually 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:47.860
 on implant placement and time 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:50.260
 healing decreases to about six 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:53.230
 months at the end of which then the plant 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:56.190
 can be loaded via prosthesis 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.190
 specific
