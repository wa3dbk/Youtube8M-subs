00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.210
 in the team competition was designed not 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:04.920
 like a chopper contest but rather 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.810
 like a I would have ended up adela 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.790
 laughing at the idea of â€‹â€‹giving access to 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.410
 oral admission tests of four 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.540
 business and management schools that 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.839
 are the cds the idrac the istec and the 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:18.119
 weapons it's also a contest that allows 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.529
 for each candidate must evaluate his 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.390
 degree of latitude to study 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.640
 of commerce and management but also 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.500
 to define trades and sectors 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.349
 adapted professionals 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.090
 I would say to his profile his skills 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.599
 his motivations but also his traits of 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.599
 personality 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.049
 good start it's gone 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.220
 personally the languages â€‹â€‹were good 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:55.070
 passed on 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:57.530
 the annals are pretty reliable for 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:59.570
 to train but on the contrary the logic 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.110
 I found it a bit hard it was rather 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:02.510
 reverse 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:04.280
 because I am in logical rest 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:09.440
 it was easier for me and so 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:11.750
 however a little more yesterday the competition 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:16.040
 team I knew through a website 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:19.670
 and also by the book each 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:22.130
 challenge by challenges magazine and 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:24.050
 so I inquired via the site 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.760
 team and then here you know everything 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:29.980
 I would like to work later 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.980
 in finance this year and financial 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.780
 during a competition team it's a contest 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.970
 which opens the doors of four schools 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:48.450
 recognized by the state so large 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:50.610
 business schools and for me it was 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.770
 important to be in a good school and 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.420
 then I looked a little bit every 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:57.380
 contest is to entail seemed to me 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:03:00.930
 well the tests are complete 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:02.760
 this is like haiti midh rc be at 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.690
 contact of students who will spend the 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:08.910
 contest and help them and accompany them 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:10.290
 in their in their competition it's up to 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.900
 say that in order for the test to happen 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:15.060
 well she and support in this ordeal 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.190
 who was very lucid since I even 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:20.569
 thought the contest and so I wish 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:24.330
 to share my experience and especially 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:26.540
 exceed the stress that this cuckoo can 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.540
 to bring 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.330
 Oh 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:42.170
 but in fact to summarize sure to say it 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:44.470
 in 2000 for kujtim is that we can 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:44.470
 pass
