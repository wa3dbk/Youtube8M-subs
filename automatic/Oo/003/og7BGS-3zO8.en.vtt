00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:06.140 
it as you walk past opposed to something
else<00:05:03.629> like<00:05:03.979> it<00:05:04.979> was<00:05:05.219> another<00:05:05.520> one<00:05:05.699> I<00:05:05.729> did<00:05:05.969> there

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:06.150 
else like it was another one I did there

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:09.499
