00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.310 
did four courses I entered in the last
one<00:00:22.710> of<00:00:22.949> the<00:00:23.369> point<00:00:23.670> nine<00:00:23.820> meters<00:00:24.119> and<00:00:24.660> that<00:00:24.779> we

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
one of the point nine meters and that we

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.950 
one of the point nine meters and that we
kind<00:00:25.590> of<00:00:25.680> used<00:00:25.890> as<00:00:26.099> my<00:00:26.279> warmup<00:00:26.730> and<00:00:27.060> then<00:00:27.570> I<00:00:27.599> had

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
kind of used as my warmup and then I had

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.490 
kind of used as my warmup and then I had
three<00:00:28.349> rounds<00:00:29.039> of<00:00:29.400> one<00:00:29.939> meter<00:00:30.240> jumpers<00:00:30.810> so

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:33.500 
three rounds of one meter jumpers so

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:39.100

unfortunately<00:00:34.500> for<00:00:34.620> my<00:00:35.360> third<00:00:36.360> round<00:00:37.640> I

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:39.110 
unfortunately for my third round I

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.049 
unfortunately for my third round I
didn't<00:00:40.110> really<00:00:40.350> get<00:00:40.500> video<00:00:40.950> because<00:00:41.520> like<00:00:41.820> my

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
didn't really get video because like my

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.880 
didn't really get video because like my
camera<00:00:42.360> just<00:00:42.660> shut<00:00:42.960> off<00:00:43.170> and<00:00:43.590> stopped

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
camera just shut off and stopped

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.190 
camera just shut off and stopped
recording<00:00:44.149> which<00:00:45.149> sucks<00:00:45.539> because<00:00:45.719> it<00:00:45.960> was<00:00:46.050> my

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
recording which sucks because it was my

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.690 
recording which sucks because it was my
sixth<00:00:46.590> place<00:00:46.920> round<00:00:47.780> but<00:00:49.190> that's<00:00:50.190> okay<00:00:50.489> so

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.580 

so<00:02:16.670> coming<00:02:17.030> out<00:02:17.270> of<00:02:17.450> this<00:02:17.630> corner<00:02:18.020> into<00:02:18.470> my

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
so coming out of this corner into my

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.710 
so coming out of this corner into my
first<00:02:18.860> combination<00:02:19.190> I<00:02:19.820> really<00:02:20.210> needed<00:02:20.420> to<00:02:20.510> get

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
first combination I really needed to get

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:21.340 
first combination I really needed to get
her<00:02:20.840> going

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
her going

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:24.400 
her going
and<00:02:22.060> that<00:02:23.060> didn't<00:02:23.360> really<00:02:23.390> happen<00:02:23.780> which<00:02:24.380> is

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
and that didn't really happen which is

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.470 
and that didn't really happen which is
why<00:02:24.680> we<00:02:24.830> struggled<00:02:25.310> in<00:02:25.460> this<00:02:25.700> last<00:02:26.150> part

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
why we struggled in this last part

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.100 
why we struggled in this last part
especially<00:02:28.210> so<00:02:29.210> really<00:02:29.480> I<00:02:29.510> just<00:02:29.570> have<00:02:29.840> to<00:02:29.990> get

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
especially so really I just have to get

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.640 
especially so really I just have to get
her<00:02:30.200> up<00:02:30.380> and<00:02:30.620> moving<00:02:31.040> more<00:02:32.230> coming<00:02:33.230> to<00:02:33.410> this

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
her up and moving more coming to this

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.460 
her up and moving more coming to this
line<00:02:34.070> was<00:02:34.640> great<00:02:35.060> because<00:02:35.510> it's<00:02:35.780> towards<00:02:36.200> home

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
line was great because it's towards home

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:45.520 
line was great because it's towards home
so<00:02:36.830> she<00:02:36.920> had<00:02:37.280> enough<00:02:37.580> go<00:02:43.720> let's<00:02:44.720> go<00:02:44.900> Mon<00:02:45.140> and

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
so she had enough go let's go Mon and

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.470 
so she had enough go let's go Mon and
then<00:02:45.920> this<00:02:46.070> combination<00:02:46.400> caused<00:02:47.150> us<00:02:47.450> some

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
then this combination caused us some

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:54.040 
then this combination caused us some
trouble<00:02:48.080> as<00:02:48.260> you<00:02:48.560> will<00:02:48.770> see<00:02:52.450> so<00:02:53.450> yeah<00:02:53.630> I<00:02:53.660> almost

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.050 
trouble as you will see so yeah I almost

00:02:54.050 --> 00:03:02.020 
trouble as you will see so yeah I almost
fell<00:02:54.470> off<00:02:58.930> but<00:02:59.930> I<00:02:59.959> stayed<00:03:00.530> on<00:03:00.560> because<00:03:01.550> I

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
fell off but I stayed on because I

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:04.840 
fell off but I stayed on because I
wanted<00:03:02.570> to<00:03:02.780> not<00:03:03.350> be<00:03:03.530> disqualified<00:03:03.860> and<00:03:04.520> right

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
wanted to not be disqualified and right

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:12.619 
wanted to not be disqualified and right
again

00:03:12.619 --> 00:03:12.629 

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:19.410 

yet<00:03:17.040> the<00:03:18.040> second<00:03:18.459> time<00:03:18.640> around<00:03:18.670> we<00:03:19.120> still

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420 
yet the second time around we still

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.479 
yet the second time around we still
struggle<00:03:19.689> through<00:03:20.290> the<00:03:20.439> combinations<00:03:21.250> so

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:21.489 
struggle through the combinations so

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:23.009 
struggle through the combinations so
that<00:03:21.640> is<00:03:21.760> definitely<00:03:22.120> something<00:03:22.360> we<00:03:22.720> need<00:03:22.870> to

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:23.019 
that is definitely something we need to

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:28.589 
that is definitely something we need to
work<00:03:23.200> on<00:03:25.769> so<00:03:26.769> this<00:03:27.010> is<00:03:27.069> the<00:03:27.370> course<00:03:27.700> that<00:03:28.030> I<00:03:28.269> did

00:03:28.589 --> 00:03:28.599 
work on so this is the course that I did

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:37.970 
work on so this is the course that I did
get<00:03:28.840> eighth<00:03:29.140> place<00:03:29.620> in<00:03:29.650> which<00:03:30.189> was<00:03:30.400> awesome

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.160 

but<00:03:38.980> that<00:03:39.579> combination<00:03:39.879> was<00:03:40.510> written<00:03:40.810> a

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.170 
but that combination was written a

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:46.979 
but that combination was written a
little<00:03:41.470> bit<00:03:41.709> better<00:03:41.950> which<00:03:42.459> is<00:03:42.640> great<00:03:45.930> this<00:03:46.930> is

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:46.989 
little bit better which is great this is

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:49.349 
little bit better which is great this is
the<00:03:47.260> same<00:03:47.470> course<00:03:47.859> because<00:03:48.430> they<00:03:48.849> repeat<00:03:49.209> the

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:49.359 
the same course because they repeat the

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:59.369 
the same course because they repeat the
courses<00:03:49.810> for<00:03:50.049> each<00:03:50.139> division<00:03:57.810> let's<00:03:58.810> go<00:03:58.989> Amaya

00:03:59.369 --> 00:03:59.379 
courses for each division let's go Amaya

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:02.460 
courses for each division let's go Amaya
so<00:04:00.129> then<00:04:00.340> I'm<00:04:00.519> coming<00:04:00.879> up<00:04:01.030> to<00:04:01.060> the<00:04:01.470> combination

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470 
so then I'm coming up to the combination

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:06.030 
so then I'm coming up to the combination
for<00:04:02.980> the<00:04:03.040> third<00:04:03.939> time<00:04:04.239> but<00:04:04.840> Luna<00:04:05.049> saved<00:04:05.650> Mars

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.040 
for the third time but Luna saved Mars

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.270 
for the third time but Luna saved Mars
but<00:04:06.400> and<00:04:06.790> got<00:04:07.359> over<00:04:07.780> the<00:04:08.019> jumps<00:04:08.409> whoa

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 
but and got over the jumps whoa

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.190 
but and got over the jumps whoa
so<00:04:09.879> yeah<00:04:10.060> we<00:04:10.269> just<00:04:10.480> knocked<00:04:10.659> down<00:04:10.810> the<00:04:10.989> last

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 
so yeah we just knocked down the last

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.360 
so yeah we just knocked down the last
jump<00:04:11.760> good<00:04:12.760> to<00:04:12.909> hit<00:04:13.060> it<00:04:13.180> yeah<00:04:14.370> so

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.370 
jump good to hit it yeah so

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:18.810

into our last and fourth course of the
day<00:04:56.919> we<00:04:57.189> were<00:04:57.369> both<00:04:57.639> really<00:04:57.999> tired<00:04:58.469> which<00:04:59.469> is

00:04:59.639 --> 00:04:59.649 
day we were both really tired which is

00:04:59.649 --> 00:05:01.859 
day we were both really tired which is
probably<00:05:00.129> what<00:05:00.669> made<00:05:01.119> our<00:05:01.149> chances<00:05:01.839> of

00:05:01.859 --> 00:05:01.869 
probably what made our chances of

00:05:01.869 --> 00:05:34.210 
probably what made our chances of
placing<00:05:02.559> really<00:05:03.009> low

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:34.220 

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:37.129 

this<00:05:35.220> line<00:05:35.490> was<00:05:35.759> never<00:05:35.970> a<00:05:36.060> problem<00:05:36.389> because<00:05:36.870> it

00:05:37.129 --> 00:05:37.139 
this line was never a problem because it

00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:43.390 
this line was never a problem because it
was<00:05:37.290> towards<00:05:37.710> home<00:05:38.040> so<00:05:38.580> she<00:05:38.669> liked<00:05:39.000> to<00:05:39.030> run

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:43.400 

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:45.710 

and<00:05:44.400> here<00:05:44.699> I<00:05:44.729> tried<00:05:45.060> to<00:05:45.180> get<00:05:45.330> her<00:05:45.419> up<00:05:45.570> and

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:45.720 
and here I tried to get her up and

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:49.460 
and here I tried to get her up and
collected<00:05:46.410> kind<00:05:46.800> of<00:05:47.509> so<00:05:48.509> that<00:05:48.690> she<00:05:49.020> could<00:05:49.259> get

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:49.470 
collected kind of so that she could get

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:52.360 
collected kind of so that she could get
over<00:05:49.530> the<00:05:49.919> jumps<00:05:50.250> easily<00:05:50.850> and<00:05:51.150> it<00:05:51.539> worked

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:52.370 
over the jumps easily and it worked

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:59.840 
over the jumps easily and it worked
pretty<00:05:53.370> well<00:05:57.770> the<00:05:58.770> one<00:05:58.979> thing<00:05:59.220> I<00:05:59.310> always<00:05:59.520> need

00:05:59.840 --> 00:05:59.850 
pretty well the one thing I always need

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:02.420 
pretty well the one thing I always need
to<00:06:00.000> remember<00:06:00.330> is<00:06:00.720> to<00:06:00.750> sit<00:06:01.259> up<00:06:01.440> and<00:06:01.650> not<00:06:01.979> tip

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:02.430 
to remember is to sit up and not tip

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:06.760 
to remember is to sit up and not tip
before<00:06:02.970> the<00:06:03.330> jumps<00:06:03.889> so<00:06:04.889> that<00:06:05.070> she<00:06:05.400> clears<00:06:05.820> them

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:06.770 
before the jumps so that she clears them

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:08.750 
before the jumps so that she clears them
so<00:06:07.770> that<00:06:07.889> is<00:06:08.010> definitely<00:06:08.160> something<00:06:08.520> I'm

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:08.760
