lines<00:00:21.570> your<00:00:21.779> main<00:00:21.990> line<00:00:22.260> and<00:00:22.560> the<00:00:23.010> reason<00:00:23.400> we

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
lines your main line and the reason we

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.390 
lines your main line and the reason we
use<00:00:23.550> file<00:00:24.359> on<00:00:24.600> or<00:00:24.840> a<00:00:24.869> braided<00:00:25.350> line<00:00:25.560> is<00:00:25.949> that

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
use file on or a braided line is that

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.160 
use file on or a braided line is that
it's<00:00:26.550> got<00:00:26.699> no<00:00:26.910> stretch<00:00:27.269> at<00:00:27.420> all<00:00:27.539> it's<00:00:27.990> very

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
it's got no stretch at all it's very

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.830 
it's got no stretch at all it's very
thin<00:00:28.800> so<00:00:29.010> you've<00:00:29.580> got<00:00:29.699> direct<00:00:29.970> contact<00:00:30.539> with

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
thin so you've got direct contact with

thin so you've got direct contact with
your<00:00:31.320> law<00:00:31.470> which<00:00:31.769> is<00:00:31.920> very<00:00:32.160> important<00:00:32.550> with

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
soft plastic fishing to be able to feel

soft plastic fishing to be able to feel
what's<00:00:34.350> going<00:00:34.620> on<00:00:34.739> at<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:34.890> end<00:00:34.980> of<00:00:35.070> your<00:00:35.130> lure

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
what's going on at the end of your lure

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.690 
what's going on at the end of your lure
it's<00:00:36.059> also<00:00:36.300> quite<00:00:37.110> bright<00:00:37.500> and<00:00:37.800> visible<00:00:38.610> in

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
it's also quite bright and visible in

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.280 
it's also quite bright and visible in
this<00:00:38.820> flame<00:00:39.090> green<00:00:39.390> color<00:00:39.660> so<00:00:39.870> you<00:00:39.930> can<00:00:40.020> see

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
this flame green color so you can see

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.990 
this flame green color so you can see
what's<00:00:40.440> going<00:00:40.710> on<00:00:40.800> with<00:00:40.950> it<00:00:41.129> the

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
what's going on with it the

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.200 
what's going on with it the
disadvantages<00:00:42.750> of<00:00:42.809> braid<00:00:43.530> is<00:00:43.829> that<00:00:44.100> it's<00:00:44.550> it

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
disadvantages of braid is that it's it

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.970 
disadvantages of braid is that it's it
is<00:00:45.360> visible<00:00:45.719> in<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:46.020> water<00:00:46.200> to<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.469> fish<00:00:46.710> and

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
is visible in the water to the fish and

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.709 
is visible in the water to the fish and
that<00:00:47.700> it's<00:00:48.660> also<00:00:48.870> not<00:00:49.350> greately<00:00:49.860> not<00:00:50.250> really

00:00:50.709 --> 00:00:50.719 
that it's also not greately not really

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:52.880 
that it's also not greately not really
abrasion<00:00:51.719> resistance<00:00:52.170> and<00:00:52.260> that's<00:00:52.379> why<00:00:52.649> we

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
abrasion resistance and that's why we

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.549 
abrasion resistance and that's why we
have<00:00:53.100> a<00:00:53.280> leader<00:00:53.670> on<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:54.000> end<00:00:54.199> usually<00:00:55.199> at<00:00:55.260> six

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
have a leader on the end usually at six

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.610 
have a leader on the end usually at six
foot<00:00:55.710> a<00:00:55.770> leader<00:00:56.010> use<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:56.969> Berkley<00:00:57.300> vanish

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:57.620 
foot a leader use the Berkley vanish

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.770 
foot a leader use the Berkley vanish
fluorocarbon<00:00:58.620> leader<00:00:58.800> and<00:00:59.420> the<00:01:00.420> reason<00:01:00.690> we

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
fluorocarbon leader and the reason we

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.150 
fluorocarbon leader and the reason we
use<00:01:00.809> that<00:01:01.140> is<00:01:01.320> that<00:01:01.469> it's<00:01:01.590> virtually

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
use that is that it's virtually

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.520 
use that is that it's virtually
invisible<00:01:02.550> to<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:02.940> fish<00:01:03.149> and<00:01:03.480> also<00:01:04.260> that<00:01:04.409> it's

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
invisible to the fish and also that it's

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.219 
invisible to the fish and also that it's
abrasion<00:01:05.159> resistant<00:01:05.640> another<00:01:06.420> advantage<00:01:07.080> of

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
abrasion resistant another advantage of

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.380 
abrasion resistant another advantage of
a<00:01:07.439> fluorocarbon<00:01:08.070> is<00:01:08.490> that<00:01:08.640> it<00:01:08.729> sinks<00:01:09.090> which<00:01:09.240> is

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
a fluorocarbon is that it sinks which is

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:10.730 
a fluorocarbon is that it sinks which is
handy<00:01:09.689> when<00:01:09.720> you're<00:01:09.900> fishing<00:01:10.049> soft<00:01:10.380> plastic

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
handy when you're fishing soft plastic

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.590 
handy when you're fishing soft plastic
lures<00:01:10.920> because<00:01:11.700> you<00:01:11.820> want<00:01:11.970> it<00:01:12.000> to<00:01:12.060> sink<00:01:12.360> them

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
lures because you want it to sink them

with the jig head it's assisting in the
syncing<00:01:15.509> process<00:01:15.860> audio<00:01:16.860> I'll<00:01:17.280> take<00:01:17.520> you

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
syncing process audio I'll take you

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.010 
syncing process audio I'll take you
through<00:01:17.670> rigging<00:01:18.150> up<00:01:18.270> with<00:01:18.479> fire<00:01:18.750> line<00:01:18.990> and

through rigging up with fire line and

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.820 
through rigging up with fire line and
vanish<00:01:20.900> we're<00:01:21.900> gonna<00:01:21.990> rig<00:01:22.200> up<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.470> flat<00:01:22.680> at

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
vanish we're gonna rig up the flat at

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.460 
vanish we're gonna rig up the flat at
first<00:01:23.070> so<00:01:23.340> I've<00:01:23.430> got<00:01:23.640> about<00:01:23.909> 15<00:01:24.420> pound<00:01:24.720> file<00:01:25.200> on

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
first so I've got about 15 pound file on

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.620 
first so I've got about 15 pound file on
and<00:01:26.250> I'm<00:01:26.340> gonna<00:01:26.430> rig<00:01:26.640> up<00:01:26.729> with<00:01:26.909> some<00:01:27.030> 14<00:01:27.420> pin

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
and I'm gonna rig up with some 14 pin

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.390 
and I'm gonna rig up with some 14 pin
leader<00:01:27.900> I'm<00:01:28.740> just<00:01:28.890> going<00:01:29.009> to<00:01:29.070> use<00:01:29.189> a<00:01:29.220> double
