00:00:11.039 --> 00:00:11.049 
so this is on one of the HDMI inputs and

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:15.479 
so this is on one of the HDMI inputs and
the<00:00:11.740> thing<00:00:11.980> just<00:00:13.589> goes<00:00:14.589> crazy<00:00:14.829> there's<00:00:15.309> no

the thing just goes crazy there's no
audio<00:00:15.879> and<00:00:16.570> it<00:00:16.690> flips<00:00:17.320> back<00:00:17.410> and<00:00:17.740> forth<00:00:18.010> let<00:00:18.550> me

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:18.640 
audio and it flips back and forth let me

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:19.620 
audio and it flips back and forth let me
flip<00:00:18.790> to<00:00:19.060> the<00:00:19.150> other

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:19.630 
flip to the other

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:26.700 
flip to the other
HDMI<00:00:20.530> input<00:00:23.310> turn<00:00:24.310> that<00:00:24.520> guy<00:00:24.730> on<00:00:25.530> this<00:00:26.530> is<00:00:26.680> a

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:26.710 
HDMI input turn that guy on this is a

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:31.410 
HDMI input turn that guy on this is a
Sony<00:00:27.430> blu-ray<00:00:27.820> player<00:00:29.220> hooked<00:00:30.220> up<00:00:30.369> to<00:00:30.520> it<00:00:30.640> once

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:31.420 
Sony blu-ray player hooked up to it once

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:34.470 
Sony blu-ray player hooked up to it once
it's<00:00:31.630> turned<00:00:31.869> on<00:00:32.399> you<00:00:33.399> can<00:00:33.429> see<00:00:33.699> it's<00:00:33.820> a<00:00:34.059> little

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:34.480 
it's turned on you can see it's a little

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.750 
it's turned on you can see it's a little
bit<00:00:34.600> fuzzy<00:00:34.899> here<00:00:35.260> but<00:00:35.440> once<00:00:35.649> it<00:00:35.890> kicks<00:00:36.339> in<00:00:36.550> all

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:36.760 
bit fuzzy here but once it kicks in all

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:43.549 
bit fuzzy here but once it kicks in all
the<00:00:36.909> way<00:00:37.109> that's<00:00:38.109> when<00:00:38.379> the<00:00:38.469> fireworks<00:00:38.679> start

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.989 

now<00:00:44.559> it's<00:00:44.739> like<00:00:44.890> this<00:00:45.039> every<00:00:45.429> time<00:00:45.579> you<00:00:45.640> turn

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:45.999 
now it's like this every time you turn

00:00:45.999 --> 00:00:49.799 
now it's like this every time you turn
the<00:00:46.179> TV<00:00:46.510> on<00:00:46.800> from<00:00:47.800> scratch<00:00:48.420> see<00:00:49.420> there<00:00:49.600> it<00:00:49.690> is

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:56.499 
blinks like crazy now if I flip back and

00:00:56.499 --> 00:01:00.299 
blinks like crazy now if I flip back and
forth<00:00:56.559> between<00:00:56.979> inputs<00:00:57.579> a<00:00:57.850> few<00:00:58.269> times<00:00:59.309> it

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:00.309 
forth between inputs a few times it

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:03.299 
forth between inputs a few times it
might<00:01:00.519> start<00:01:00.879> to<00:01:01.030> work<00:01:01.179> again<00:01:02.069> this<00:01:03.069> is<00:01:03.190> the

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:03.309 
might start to work again this is the

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:07.070 
might start to work again this is the
component<00:01:04.059> input<00:01:04.780> and<00:01:05.050> that<00:01:05.170> works<00:01:05.410> just<00:01:05.530> fine

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
component input and that works just fine

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:14.130 
component input and that works just fine
let's<00:01:08.080> try<00:01:08.380> the<00:01:09.690> HDMI<00:01:10.690> one<00:01:10.900> again<00:01:12.900> and<00:01:13.900> now

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:14.140 
let's try the HDMI one again and now

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.300 
let's try the HDMI one again and now
it's<00:01:15.180> part<00:01:16.180> way<00:01:16.360> working<00:01:17.040> except<00:01:18.040> for<00:01:18.220> the

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:18.310 
it's part way working except for the

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.830 
it's part way working except for the
audio<00:01:20.070> there's<00:01:21.070> some<00:01:21.400> jaggies<00:01:22.090> in<00:01:22.480> the<00:01:22.600> video

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:22.840 
audio there's some jaggies in the video

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:28.500 
audio there's some jaggies in the video
but<00:01:24.570> it's<00:01:25.570> starting<00:01:26.020> to<00:01:26.200> work<00:01:27.180> go<00:01:28.180> back<00:01:28.210> to

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:28.510 
but it's starting to work go back to

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:34.260 
but it's starting to work go back to
blu-ray<00:01:31.770> now<00:01:32.770> you<00:01:32.890> can<00:01:33.040> see<00:01:33.190> it<00:01:33.310> flashes

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.270 
blu-ray now you can see it flashes

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:38.490 
blu-ray now you can see it flashes
between<00:01:34.680> screwed<00:01:35.680> up<00:01:35.860> and<00:01:36.070> normal<00:01:36.490> and<00:01:37.360> as<00:01:38.290> the

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:38.500 
between screwed up and normal and as the

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:44.510 
between screwed up and normal and as the
TV<00:01:38.830> warms<00:01:39.160> up<00:01:39.340> it'll<00:01:39.550> get<00:01:39.700> better<00:01:39.880> and<00:01:40.090> better

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.370 

so<00:01:45.119> again<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.479> component<00:01:45.960> input<00:01:46.200> always

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
so again the component input always

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.539 
so again the component input always
works<00:01:46.710> here<00:01:48.110> let's<00:01:49.110> go<00:01:49.290> HDMI<00:01:49.979> one<00:01:50.189> on<00:01:50.430> the

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
works here let's go HDMI one on the

00:01:50.549 --> 00:02:00.620 
works here let's go HDMI one on the
cable<00:01:52.520> still<00:01:53.520> kind<00:01:53.790> of<00:01:53.850> messed<00:01:54.030> up<00:01:59.509> the<00:02:00.509> way

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
cable still kind of messed up the way

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:40.250 
cable still kind of messed up the way
again

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.929 

there<00:02:40.860> we<00:02:40.950> go<00:02:41.069> so<00:02:41.459> now<00:02:41.489> the<00:02:41.640> blu-ray<00:02:43.159> is<00:02:44.159> mostly

00:02:44.929 --> 00:02:44.939 
there we go so now the blu-ray is mostly

00:02:44.939 --> 00:02:47.720 
there we go so now the blu-ray is mostly
working<00:02:45.120> it<00:02:45.599> may<00:02:45.959> start<00:02:46.470> we'll<00:02:47.280> see<00:02:47.489> if<00:02:47.610> it

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730
