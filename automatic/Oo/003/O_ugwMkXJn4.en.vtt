a<00:01:15.600> good<00:01:15.780> idea<00:01:15.840> i<00:01:16.200> don't<00:01:16.409> think<00:01:16.650> multiplayer<00:01:17.250> is

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
a good idea i don't think multiplayer is

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
and be a better game than battlefield i

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.679 
and be a better game than battlefield i
don't<00:01:29.220> think<00:01:29.310> they<00:01:29.549> can<00:01:29.610> show<00:01:29.970> everything<00:01:30.390> at

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
don't think they can show everything at

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.020 
don't think they can show everything at
the<00:01:31.079> moment<00:01:31.380> right<00:01:31.560> now<00:01:31.619> i<00:01:32.189> think<00:01:32.640> right<00:01:32.820> now

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
the moment right now i think right now

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.969 
the moment right now i think right now
they<00:01:33.270> need<00:01:33.600> to<00:01:33.869> wait<00:01:34.140> a<00:01:34.170> little<00:01:34.500> bit<00:01:34.680> longer

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
they need to wait a little bit longer

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.609 
they need to wait a little bit longer
and<00:01:35.340> just<00:01:36.000> keep<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.509> hype<00:01:36.689> building<00:01:37.229> up<00:01:37.380> and

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
and just keep the hype building up and

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.399 
and just keep the hype building up and
then<00:01:38.250> just<00:01:39.210> deliver<00:01:39.659> with<00:01:39.900> an<00:01:40.020> explosive

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
then just deliver with an explosive

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.410 
then just deliver with an explosive
trailer<00:01:41.159> or<00:01:41.340> beta<00:01:41.610> or<00:01:41.850> whatever<00:01:42.150> they<00:01:42.299> have

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
ops which i think is a good idea I'm

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.879 
ops which i think is a good idea I'm
definitely<00:03:27.989> looking<00:03:28.199> forward<00:03:28.440> to<00:03:28.560> that<00:03:28.739> thing

talked<00:03:31.620> about<00:03:31.799> that<00:03:31.949> I<00:03:31.980> think<00:03:32.220> I'll<00:03:32.310> move<00:03:32.549> on

00:03:32.689 --> 00:03:32.699

talked about that I think I'll move on
to<00:03:32.849> battlefield<00:03:33.329> and<00:03:33.569> battlefield<00:03:34.500> I<00:03:34.620> was

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
to battlefield and battlefield I was

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:35.809 
to battlefield and battlefield I was
looking<00:03:35.010> really<00:03:35.280> I<00:03:35.310> was<00:03:35.519> really<00:03:35.549> looking

00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:35.819 
looking really I was really looking

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:38.020 
looking really I was really looking
forward<00:03:36.269> to<00:03:36.299> it<00:03:36.540> and<00:03:36.690> but<00:03:37.319> you<00:03:37.410> know<00:03:37.530> what

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.150 
forward to it and but you know what
honestly<00:03:39.030> I<00:03:39.120> think<00:03:39.329> the<00:03:40.169> idea<00:03:40.199> that<00:03:40.590> they<00:03:40.859> came

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
honestly I think the idea that they came

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:42.349 
honestly I think the idea that they came
in<00:03:41.340> with<00:03:41.519> his<00:03:41.730> we're<00:03:41.879> going<00:03:42.000> to<00:03:42.060> show<00:03:42.180> some

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:42.359

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:43.859 
stuff on console and I think everyone

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:45.589 
stuff on console and I think everyone
was<00:03:43.980> looking<00:03:44.069> forward<00:03:44.459> to<00:03:44.519> that<00:03:44.549> but<00:03:44.910> it

00:03:45.589 --> 00:03:45.599 
was looking forward to that but it

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:48.080 
was looking forward to that but it

attention off of monitor three so they

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:05.900 
attention off of monitor three so they
if<00:05:04.770> they're<00:05:04.950> moving<00:05:05.250> it<00:05:05.370> up<00:05:05.520> they<00:05:05.700> got<00:05:05.850> a

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:52.240 
but my point is the map packs don't

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:53.990 
but my point is the map packs don't
always<00:06:52.480> deliver<00:06:52.750> the<00:06:52.900> best<00:06:53.020> match<00:06:53.290> so

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:54.000 
always deliver the best match so

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.650 
always deliver the best match so
hopefully<00:06:55.000> you<00:06:55.060> guys<00:06:55.120> will<00:06:55.300> take<00:06:55.420> that<00:06:55.600> into

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:55.660 
hopefully you guys will take that into

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:56.880 
hopefully you guys will take that into

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:04.780 
the other maps go buy it but if you

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:06.480 
the other maps go buy it but if you
don't<00:07:04.960> play<00:07:05.050> black<00:07:05.320> ops<00:07:05.470> every<00:07:05.770> day<00:07:05.890> my
