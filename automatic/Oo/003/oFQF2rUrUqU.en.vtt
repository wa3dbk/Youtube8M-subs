kind<00:02:57.500> of<00:02:57.530> like<00:02:57.680> the<00:02:57.800> stealth<00:02:58.100> snorkel<00:02:58.610> set<00:02:58.820> up

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
kind of like the stealth snorkel set up

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.700 
kind of like the stealth snorkel set up
gas<00:03:01.430> vent<00:03:01.790> line<00:03:02.000> just<00:03:02.810> ran<00:03:03.080> it<00:03:03.200> right<00:03:03.230> up<00:03:03.500> the

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:03.710 
gas vent line just ran it right up the

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:08.590 
gas vent line just ran it right up the
new<00:03:04.160> CVT<00:03:04.550> exhaust<00:03:06.340> put<00:03:07.340> the<00:03:07.490> stock<00:03:07.790> stuff<00:03:08.360> back

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600 
new CVT exhaust put the stock stuff back

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:13.260 
new CVT exhaust put the stock stuff back
on<00:03:08.630> it<00:03:09.400> set<00:03:10.400> up<00:03:10.550> in<00:03:10.700> here<00:03:11.060> like<00:03:11.480> that<00:03:11.620> cover<00:03:12.620> on

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:13.270 
on it set up in here like that cover on

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:16.420 
on it set up in here like that cover on
the<00:03:14.270> last<00:03:14.480> thing<00:03:14.690> I<00:03:14.810> did<00:03:15.020> was<00:03:15.200> the<00:03:15.980> ExoMars

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
the last thing I did was the ExoMars

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:19.090 
the last thing I did was the ExoMars
have<00:03:17.360> a<00:03:17.390> hole<00:03:17.630> cut<00:03:17.810> out<00:03:17.900> here<00:03:18.170> with<00:03:18.860> a<00:03:18.890> piece

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.100 
have a hole cut out here with a piece

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.400 
have a hole cut out here with a piece
that<00:03:19.130> covers<00:03:19.670> this<00:03:19.820> well<00:03:20.690> it<00:03:20.840> only<00:03:20.930> fits<00:03:21.260> on

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.410 
that covers this well it only fits on

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:23.050 
that covers this well it only fits on
the<00:03:21.530> Gentoo<00:03:22.010> so<00:03:22.220> I<00:03:22.250> didn't<00:03:22.490> get<00:03:22.580> that<00:03:22.670> on<00:03:22.820> here

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
the Gentoo so I didn't get that on here

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.080 
the Gentoo so I didn't get that on here
so<00:03:23.270> I<00:03:23.330> just<00:03:23.650> drilled<00:03:24.650> some<00:03:24.800> holes<00:03:24.830> so<00:03:25.640> the<00:03:25.760> CVT

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
so I just drilled some holes so the CVT

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:29.080 
so I just drilled some holes so the CVT
exhaust<00:03:26.570> can<00:03:26.840> breathe<00:03:27.050> out<00:03:27.520> the<00:03:28.520> same<00:03:28.880> thing

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
exhaust can breathe out the same thing

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.570 
exhaust can breathe out the same thing
on<00:03:29.210> this<00:03:29.390> side<00:03:29.450> so<00:03:29.930> the<00:03:30.380> CVT<00:03:30.680> intake<00:03:31.220> and

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:31.580 
on this side so the CVT intake and

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:34.870 
on this side so the CVT intake and
airbox<00:03:31.970> and<00:03:32.150> intake<00:03:32.240> can<00:03:32.630> breathe
