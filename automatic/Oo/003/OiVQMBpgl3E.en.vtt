 hello youtube friends this time 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.400
 I bring you a tutorial on how to download 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.320

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.660
 a usb memory to see them in the 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.970
 television as if they were in film xd 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.890
 xd and burn them on a DVD because I've seen 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.010
 you are tired of seeing so many 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.710
 tutorials and they do not serve are shit xd 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:41.720

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.720
 that I leave in the description of the video 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.680
 now we go down and look for the movie that 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:50.960
 you look for 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.960
 which in my case will be fast furious 6 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:02.190
 well we give click then look for the 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.140
 description of the video I recommend you 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.420
 If you are going to download, do it through 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.790
 fail because in us link almost 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.340
 they always delete the files so that 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.410
 be on notice and then do not say 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.479
 that the tutorial and the link are crap 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:17.430
 but what assholes they see that they 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.000
 I notice I pause the video to not 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.000
 lengthen it 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.420
 they give you in download 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:02:01.560
 then fill this box they always ask 

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:01.560
 to verify that they are not a robot 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:10.950
 they give you in download 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:24.120
 and then it will depend on how fast 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:26.370

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:29.490
