not only is it stainless but it looks a

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.360 
not only is it stainless but it looks a
little<00:00:56.610> bit<00:00:56.969> different<00:00:57.559> the<00:00:58.559> reason<00:00:59.010> it<00:00:59.160> looks

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
little bit different the reason it looks

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.090 
little bit different the reason it looks
different<00:00:59.850> is<00:01:00.180> this<00:01:00.480> is<00:01:00.690> actually<00:01:01.079> a<00:01:01.109> class<00:01:01.530> 3

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
weapon these were actually and I think

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.060

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
still are used by the Navy SEALs the

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.789 
still are used by the Navy SEALs the
lead<00:01:11.280> unit<00:01:11.840> because<00:01:13.070> what<00:01:14.070> this<00:01:14.250> has<00:01:15.619> you<00:01:16.619> can

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
lead unit because what this has you can

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.450

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:17.650 
own
piece<00:05:15.800> to<00:05:16.039> it<00:05:16.190> I<00:05:16.280> think<00:05:16.550> actually<00:05:16.759> I<00:05:17.090> was<00:05:17.389> told

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:17.660 
piece to it I think actually I was told

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:21.969 
piece to it I think actually I was told
that<00:05:18.020> they<00:05:19.629> add<00:05:20.629> it<00:05:20.990> in<00:05:21.139> here<00:05:21.169> somewhere<00:05:21.830> but

00:05:21.969 --> 00:05:21.979 
that they add it in here somewhere but

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:23.920 
that they add it in here somewhere but
they<00:05:22.129> mill<00:05:22.340> it<00:05:22.370> so<00:05:22.789> good<00:05:23.060> you<00:05:23.270> cannot<00:05:23.569> see

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:23.930 
they mill it so good you cannot see

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:27.520 
they mill it so good you cannot see
where<00:05:24.110> it's<00:05:24.460> added<00:05:25.870> there<00:05:26.870> are<00:05:26.990> their

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:27.530 
where it's added there are their

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:30.219 
where it's added there are their
companies<00:05:28.159> I<00:05:28.400> think<00:05:28.430> that<00:05:28.849> made<00:05:29.060> the<00:05:29.840> black

00:05:30.219 --> 00:05:30.229 
companies I think that made the black

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:33.670 
companies I think that made the black
ones<00:05:30.590> and<00:05:30.919> they're<00:05:31.610> like<00:05:31.789> a<00:05:31.819> pitted<00:05:32.389> thing<00:05:32.690> so

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:33.680 
ones and they're like a pitted thing so

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:36.490 
ones and they're like a pitted thing so
you<00:05:34.280> know<00:05:34.400> you<00:05:34.460> can't<00:05:34.849> tell<00:05:35.120> but<00:05:35.599> this<00:05:36.020> one<00:05:36.319> has

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:36.500 
you know you can't tell but this one has

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:37.869 
you know you can't tell but this one has
done<00:05:36.860> so<00:05:37.340> well

00:05:37.869 --> 00:05:37.879 
done so well

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:42.220 
done so well
you<00:05:38.360> really<00:05:38.690> cannot<00:05:39.050> detect<00:05:40.009> it
