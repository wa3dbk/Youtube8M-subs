00:00:10.829 --> 00:00:15.259
 with the coming Monday which is the fourteenth third of 2011 begins 

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:19.329
 our alone the GWW I was two weeks ago at the ZEBET no idea who 

00:00:19.329 --> 00:00:23.619
 that is neither noticed at that time or two weeks ago and asked below 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:26.140
 other synonymous with a accordingly 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:27.929
 hardware support after 

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:30.909
 insofar as those who have not yet heard about ours 

00:00:30.909 --> 00:00:31.769
 other videos 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.160
 here we had this relatively we say challenging now 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.680
 but we need to stick to the whole virtualization in conjunction with the 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:40.320
 all 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.550
 like the autopsy 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:44.880
 in that sense, as well as hardware 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.920
 Manufacturer asked if the SNB we did not want to support 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.610
 other things include quality 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.090
 and of course I also have a statute of hers but what has for ours 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.900
 spectator 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.000
 Mama Bayern have 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.040
 a raffle from it and then 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.640
 then the buyer will be effects Well, anyway, the boys and girls 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.030
 actually the Gameforge AG 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.940
 the guards fired up for the GBW action Alf for us that was completely 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.330
 uninteresting or "What she wanted to see us," she said 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.340
 completely uninteresting in the truth completely creates on the insole 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:19.170
 reaction 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.759
 Furthermore, the Ersatzkasse idea and I have tried again and again in conversation that 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:23.770
 Topic rise 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.380
 To bring professors we wanted but the lady was not too 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.580
 he had said no but viewers the Finder class report with 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:34.190
 better chosen and so on and so forth 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:38.550
 so of course not completely recovered but definitely with Dr the reaction 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:42.030
 Percent that then pretty soon just arrived home already 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.150
 the Melda that we get a process for the first action two graphics cards 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:47.539
 should be sent directly 

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:49.530
 and there should be more 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.020
 That's just what they quit within about 24 hours 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:54.320
 could and 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.820
 that's super fast the only thing that is not important for a weighty one 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.130
 Guarantee for the products being taken over are all patterns from the USA 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.090
 the cowboy straight from the USA 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.950
 stands partly on the fact that they may not be sold, for example 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.060
 and so on and so on and therefore the warranty excluded everything 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.819
 As far as I remember correctly anyway, no guarantee 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:17.659
 because he is not just a sales contract 

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:22.129
 if you win something here with us, that's important after a deal 

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:23.630
 that this is exposed 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.340
 if so with the devices something should not have votes 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.259
 she does not pretend to anything the promise of her parries times 

00:02:31.259 --> 00:02:34.259
 but if at all they would have been very scared over the years 

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:36.869
 no claims 

00:02:36.869 --> 00:02:39.799
 Chances are also with the first delivery, I was almost that now 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:42.719
 you shortly after Iran the Romandie 

00:02:42.719 --> 00:02:48.210
 5450 of them shot a photo that's what the part looks like 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:49.400
 here below 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.889
 Sonos times ran 

00:02:51.889 --> 00:02:53.029
 possibly CAD seemed 

00:02:53.029 --> 00:02:54.099
 out loud 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:56.819
 resale 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:01.509
 second is an ATI Radeon HD 5570 

00:03:03.089 --> 00:03:06.159
 so we got the packaging is complete without packaging 

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:07.480
 of course a packaging 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.240
 Here, too, one stands for Engineering Sample 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:13.270
 North Fork Walleczek ash trees read aloud El 

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:20.839
 and as third Ahlen de February and 2 940 

00:03:21.589 --> 00:03:24.589
 as a quad-core processor if I've read that on the fast right 

00:03:26.399 --> 00:03:29.939
 Lyon beautifully stands the four us marriages Gemini 

00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:33.430
 It can already claim that in Germany of 7 2 percent 

00:03:34.689 --> 00:03:39.739
 from the expiry of the GdW action, we thought this was sometime forms 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:41.819
 next Monday until the European Championships 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:44.359
 Sunday following Monday 

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:48.529
 comScore was a video of us that we just put online and there 

00:03:48.529 --> 00:03:52.359
 then said that, for example, in the video card is raffled in the video 

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:55.329
 even some more detailed information will come with it 

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:59.249
 can determine if that even fits on her computer if she does 

00:03:59.249 --> 00:04:02.329
 could use at all 

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:06.819
 the period of participation in this raffle for the graphics card this 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:09.629
 for example by touting her 

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:11.179
 is from 

00:04:11.179 --> 00:04:12.960
 Time of the online position 

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:16.079
 until the same day 24 o'clock 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:20.159
 that is if the graphics card is placed on the 22 o'clock online so that 

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:20.870
 Video 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:24.879
 then the raffle runs for four hours from 8 pm to midnight 

00:04:25.379 --> 00:04:28.849
 after that has expired, a random generator will be triggered and the 

00:04:28.849 --> 00:04:29.980
 Comment number 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:33.580
 which coincides with the number of the random generator gets the 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:34.330
 map 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.170
 we want to exclude more every subjectivity so do not say 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:40.699
 that they should do something now 

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:44.499
 and then we have to decide after all Sarah is the most beautiful so far 

00:04:44.499 --> 00:04:45.750
 throughout the country 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:49.080
 Company or anyone and then but then 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:50.760
 in comments to word 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:54.210
 But much more effort 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:57.300
 Let's get to what you have to do to take part in the raffle 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:02.330
 First of all, they must be Semper's argument again, secondly 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:04.860
 you have to favor this video 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:07.710
 Third, they have to give thumbs up 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:11.039
 Quarter you need to embed this video in your channel 

00:05:12.289 --> 00:05:16.460
 Fifth, they must hardly miss seeing foreign help 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:20.120
 and from there also favor this video 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:21.320
 Subscribe and 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:23.569
 BamS deliver 

00:05:23.569 --> 00:05:26.240
 Sixth, you have to recognize Google 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:29.789
 and redirect all search results to this video 

00:05:29.789 --> 00:05:30.770
 SID tennis 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:32.930
 they have full page ads 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:35.559
 in any newspaper 

00:05:35.559 --> 00:05:39.409
 and this video is 8 serious 

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:43.460
 they have to buy advertising time at their favorite animal fouls at da and in 

00:05:43.459 --> 00:05:46.529
 this also on this video show 

00:05:47.949 --> 00:05:52.159
 Nine are you need to send a blood sample 

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:53.979
 To send birth certificate 

00:05:53.979 --> 00:05:59.300
 Alphonse she must have a blood test and birth certificate her birthday and 

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:00.129
 to send 

00:06:00.129 --> 00:06:02.339
 and penultimate is 

00:06:02.339 --> 00:06:06.359
 they juggle with three eyes they would perform a tap dance and 

00:06:06.359 --> 00:06:09.849
 At the same time Katharina Magdalena Lobensteiner want to sing a song 

00:06:09.849 --> 00:06:10.689
 to sing 

00:06:10.689 --> 00:06:12.279
 if you do not know what that is 

00:06:12.279 --> 00:06:16.409
 Link can be found above this video to another video and 

00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:20.649
 the last impulse as already mentioned at least one 

00:06:20.649 --> 00:06:21.910
 leave a comment 

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:25.870
 from all the comments with the after all the winners determined so far is that 

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:28.069
 he is relatively logical 

00:06:28.069 --> 00:06:31.069
 The last point is probably the most difficult 

00:06:31.639 --> 00:06:34.370
 if you do not need to win please give yours 

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:36.779
 corresponding videos no comment 

00:06:36.779 --> 00:06:40.469
 So someone behind Massa was at the process should not use winter 

00:06:40.469 --> 00:06:41.000
 can 

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.420
 in that case, just do not comment on it. "That increased the chances of the oldie's 

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:47.550
 Things may really want to have 

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:51.520
 So do not write first then win and in the end say that you even 

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:53.290
 did not want to participate and so on 

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:56.500
 «Won in addition to him to come and join them 

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:57.830
 winner video to shoot 

00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:58.939
 that's not a fan 

00:06:58.939 --> 00:07:00.180
 certainly not for her 

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:03.389
 if my colleagues are the waddles stormers but also to the plate 

00:07:03.389 --> 00:07:05.669
 full of them are very soft choir on it 

00:07:05.669 --> 00:07:07.719
 Believe me I did not care 

00:07:07.719 --> 00:07:09.839
 at the x 

00:07:09.839 --> 00:07:13.139
 just like that but when you think again 

00:07:13.139 --> 00:07:17.320
 it may be better if we delete all the points mentioned above 

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:21.190
 in almost all but one you will find out which one that is 

00:07:23.759 --> 00:07:26.550
 Conclusion if you need something from this club you can watch 

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:29.979
 Regularly over sometime in the next week these three become 

00:07:29.979 --> 00:07:31.499
 Videos posted online 

00:07:31.499 --> 00:07:35.079
 from the time of hiring until the same day 24 o'clock you have time 

00:07:35.079 --> 00:07:38.489
 Leave a comment if you manage to leave a comment 

00:07:39.689 --> 00:07:40.759
 they are there 

00:07:40.759 --> 00:07:42.610
 if you can not do it yourself 

00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:46.380
 if there are several comments Emmanuel has more chances "I can now 

00:07:46.379 --> 00:07:48.389
 not exactly say likely 

00:07:48.389 --> 00:07:50.369
 but make yourself responsible 

00:07:50.369 --> 00:07:53.369
 Google block their account or the government official 

00:07:55.539 --> 00:07:58.539
 OK 

00:08:00.069 --> 00:08:01.330
