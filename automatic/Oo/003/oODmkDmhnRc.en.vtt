00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
you can also mount the seat just

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.760 
you can also mount the seat just
rear-facing<00:01:51.180> and<00:01:51.930> you<00:01:52.020> can<00:01:52.140> switch<00:01:52.409> it<00:01:52.560> at<00:01:52.649> any

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
rear-facing and you can switch it at any

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.490 
rear-facing and you can switch it at any
moment<00:01:53.189> but<00:01:53.250> I<00:01:53.340> think<00:01:53.579> this<00:01:53.700> is<00:01:53.880> probably<00:01:54.500> the

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
moment but I think this is probably the

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.219 
moment but I think this is probably the
most<00:01:55.530> room<00:01:56.130> least<00:01:57.119> legroom<00:01:57.509> I<00:01:57.719> wouldn't<00:01:58.020> want

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
most room least legroom I wouldn't want

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.429 
most room least legroom I wouldn't want
to<00:01:58.350> sit<00:01:58.590> facing<00:01:59.310> the<00:01:59.549> rear<00:02:00.049> they<00:02:01.049> were<00:02:01.140> even

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
to sit facing the rear they were even

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.440 
to sit facing the rear they were even
