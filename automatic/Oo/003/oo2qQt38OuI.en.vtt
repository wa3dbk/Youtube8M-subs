you'll see about what it is this that

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.930 
you'll see about what it is this that
wasn't<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:20.910> actual<00:01:21.120> scene<00:01:21.660> but<00:01:22.560> it<00:01:23.220> is<00:01:23.729> just

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:23.940 
wasn't the actual scene but it is just

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.200 
wasn't the actual scene but it is just
essentially<00:01:24.690> what<00:01:25.260> every<00:01:25.680> obstacle<00:01:26.130> that<00:01:27.030> the

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
essentially what every obstacle that the

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.550 
essentially what every obstacle that the
hosts<00:01:27.420> in<00:01:27.570> different<00:01:27.869> cities<00:01:28.050> looks<00:01:28.350> like

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
hosts in different cities looks like

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.310 
hosts in different cities looks like
give<00:01:28.740> or<00:01:28.860> take<00:01:29.010> so<00:01:29.700> it's<00:01:29.850> a<00:01:29.940> 15-foot<00:01:30.720> jump<00:01:31.110> into

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
give or take so it's a 15-foot jump into

so<00:04:27.290> what<00:04:27.530> I<00:04:27.560> think<00:04:27.890> really<00:04:28.130> was<00:04:28.520> just<00:04:29.260> you<00:04:30.260> know

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:30.290 
so what I think really was just you know

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:32.470 
so what I think really was just you know
there's<00:04:30.740> no<00:04:30.950> protocol<00:04:31.460> set<00:04:31.730> for<00:04:31.910> who<00:04:32.030> jumps

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:32.480 
there's no protocol set for who jumps

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:35.470 
there's no protocol set for who jumps
from<00:04:33.200> what<00:04:33.410> I<00:04:33.440> was<00:04:33.980> reading<00:04:34.160> here<00:04:34.490> you<00:04:35.270> just

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:35.480 
from what I was reading here you just

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:37.060 
from what I was reading here you just
jump<00:04:35.750> whenever<00:04:35.960> you<00:04:36.200> feel<00:04:36.380> it's<00:04:36.560> time<00:04:36.710> to<00:04:36.860> jump

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.070

people may say it jump go go go fast

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:41.710 
people may say it jump go go go fast

person jumping at a time not having dark
muddy<00:05:07.710> water<00:05:08.010> why<00:05:08.280> can<00:05:08.699> it<00:05:08.729> just<00:05:08.940> be<00:05:09.030> normal

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:09.330 
muddy water why can it just be normal

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.300 
muddy water why can it just be normal
pool<00:05:09.750> a<00:05:09.990> normal<00:05:10.680> pool<00:05:10.889> would<00:05:11.010> have<00:05:11.100> been<00:05:11.190> much

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:11.310 
pool a normal pool would have been much

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:17.629 
pool a normal pool would have been much
better<00:05:11.570> but<00:05:13.070> you<00:05:14.070> know<00:05:15.830> it's<00:05:16.830> just<00:05:17.190> messed<00:05:17.400> up

00:05:17.629 --> 00:05:17.639 
better but you know it's just messed up

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:20.230 
better but you know it's just messed up
honestly<00:05:18.120> I<00:05:18.210> think<00:05:18.330> because<00:05:19.080> you've<00:05:19.410> got

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:20.240 
honestly I think because you've got

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:23.030 
honestly I think because you've got
11,000<00:05:21.240> people<00:05:21.330> participating<00:05:22.229> who<00:05:22.830> knows

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:23.040 
11,000 people participating who knows

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:26.230 
11,000 people participating who knows
maybe<00:05:23.310> 30<00:05:23.669> people<00:05:24.000> at<00:05:24.120> a<00:05:24.180> time

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:26.240 
maybe 30 people at a time

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:29.610 
maybe 30 people at a time
and<00:05:26.389> it's<00:05:26.750> just<00:05:26.990> like<00:05:27.669> asking<00:05:28.669> for

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:29.620 
and it's just like asking for

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:32.550 
and it's just like asking for
to<00:05:30.040> happen<00:05:30.430> because<00:05:30.639> imagine<00:05:31.630> I<00:05:31.990> jump<00:05:32.320> and

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:32.560 
to happen because imagine I jump and

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:33.990 
to happen because imagine I jump and
then<00:05:32.620> the<00:05:32.740> next<00:05:32.770> person<00:05:33.070> jumps<00:05:33.550> after<00:05:33.699> me

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:34.000 
then the next person jumps after me

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.510 
then the next person jumps after me
happens<00:05:34.900> to<00:05:35.110> just<00:05:35.320> jump<00:05:35.590> at<00:05:35.770> the<00:05:35.800> exact<00:05:36.160> same

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:36.520 
happens to just jump at the exact same

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:40.020 
happens to just jump at the exact same
position<00:05:36.880> I<00:05:37.300> am<00:05:37.350> hits<00:05:38.350> my<00:05:38.590> shoulders<00:05:39.100> pushes
