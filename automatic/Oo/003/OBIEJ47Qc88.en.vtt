 hello friends going to youtube as that 

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:11.840
 no other proxy tutorial will teach 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:14.990
 How to download the zombie mod 9.5 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:17.590
 for condition 0 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:21.690
 Well the first thing I have to do 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:21.690
 is to enter our browser 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:34.420
 It was the link that I'm going to leave 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.420
 in the description 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:47.450
 but the download of the x files and 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:53.449
 It works because I'm in charge of soil 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:57.050
 good as you can see download from in 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:01:01.400
 regular discharge because 9 10 minutes no 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:04.710
 it weighs a lot 19.24 mb 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:07.610
 good once downloaded 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.610

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:13.770

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.770
 they give him 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.700
 extract here 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:28.850
 once extracted it will appear this 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:31.370
 folder and this data would be among all 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:34.090

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:34.090
