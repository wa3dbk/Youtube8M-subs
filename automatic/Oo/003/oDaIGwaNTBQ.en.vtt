00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:51.280 
the straightaway doing on an ad it's in

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:51.690 
the straightaway doing on an ad it's in
slow-mo

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:51.700 
slow-mo

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:53.550 
slow-mo
are<00:04:51.970> feels<00:04:52.270> three<00:04:52.540> times<00:04:52.750> heavy<00:04:53.110> is<00:04:53.290> what<00:04:53.470> it

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:53.560 
are feels three times heavy is what it

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.860 
are feels three times heavy is what it
is<00:04:53.710> and<00:04:53.950> just<00:04:54.670> the<00:04:55.030> overall<00:04:55.120> differences<00:04:55.750> of

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:55.870 
is and just the overall differences of

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:58.890 
is and just the overall differences of
aerodynamics<00:04:56.590> here<00:04:56.680> Istanbul<00:04:57.810> obviously<00:04:58.810> the

00:04:58.890 --> 00:04:58.900 
aerodynamics here Istanbul obviously the

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:00.450 
aerodynamics here Istanbul obviously the
cars<00:04:59.110> are<00:04:59.260> real<00:04:59.380> light<00:04:59.590> and<00:04:59.980> it<00:05:00.070> takes<00:05:00.250> time<00:05:00.400> to

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:00.460 
cars are real light and it takes time to

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:01.890 
cars are real light and it takes time to
build<00:05:00.670> temp<00:05:00.910> in<00:05:01.030> the<00:05:01.120> tire<00:05:01.270> so<00:05:01.570> that<00:05:01.660> was<00:05:01.810> the

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:01.900 
build temp in the tire so that was the

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:03.990 
build temp in the tire so that was the
first<00:05:02.020> mistake<00:05:02.200> I<00:05:02.470> made<00:05:02.620> the<00:05:03.430> last<00:05:03.580> one<00:05:03.880> I'm

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:04.000 
first mistake I made the last one I'm

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.460 
first mistake I made the last one I'm
pressing<00:05:04.420> the<00:05:04.660> car<00:05:04.840> trying<00:05:05.080> to<00:05:05.140> get<00:05:05.260> it<00:05:05.320> up<00:05:05.440> to

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:05.470 
pressing the car trying to get it up to

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:08.850 
pressing the car trying to get it up to
its<00:05:05.680> capabilities<00:05:06.250> I<00:05:06.400> know<00:05:07.470> it<00:05:08.470> was<00:05:08.590> a<00:05:08.620> great

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:08.860 
its capabilities I know it was a great

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:10.350 
its capabilities I know it was a great
ride<00:05:09.010> today<00:05:09.190> I<00:05:09.310> mean<00:05:09.490> it's<00:05:09.700> good<00:05:09.880> time<00:05:10.030> to<00:05:10.210> gain

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:10.360 
ride today I mean it's good time to gain

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:11.880 
ride today I mean it's good time to gain
experience<00:05:10.900> and<00:05:11.050> understand<00:05:11.500> the<00:05:11.590> different

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:11.890 
experience and understand the different

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:14.160 
experience and understand the different
way<00:05:11.980> like<00:05:12.160> you're<00:05:12.880> still<00:05:13.120> were<00:05:13.270> able<00:05:13.390> to<00:05:13.660> knock

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:14.170 
way like you're still were able to knock

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:19.230 
way like you're still were able to knock
some<00:05:14.410> time<00:05:14.560> off<00:05:14.740> the<00:05:14.830> time<00:05:17.430> yeah<00:05:18.490> just<00:05:19.000> with

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:19.240 
some time off the time yeah just with

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:20.970 
some time off the time yeah just with
the<00:05:19.630> first<00:05:19.810> time<00:05:19.960> I<00:05:20.110> made<00:05:20.320> obviously<00:05:20.710> a<00:05:20.830> big

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:20.980 
the first time I made obviously a big

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:22.710 
the first time I made obviously a big
mistake<00:05:21.160> with<00:05:21.520> the<00:05:21.610> car<00:05:21.790> on<00:05:21.820> both<00:05:22.120> tires<00:05:22.360> just

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:22.720 
mistake with the car on both tires just

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:24.270 
mistake with the car on both tires just
spinning<00:05:23.230> around<00:05:23.320> we<00:05:23.650> stayed<00:05:23.830> on<00:05:23.860> the<00:05:24.070> track

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:24.280 
spinning around we stayed on the track

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:26.790 
spinning around we stayed on the track
that<00:05:25.180> made<00:05:25.450> me<00:05:25.750> understand<00:05:26.170> more<00:05:26.380> about<00:05:26.440> what

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:26.800 
that made me understand more about what

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.290 
that made me understand more about what
these<00:05:26.920> tires<00:05:27.160> are<00:05:27.370> about<00:05:27.580> when<00:05:27.730> you<00:05:27.790> start<00:05:28.060> up

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:28.300 
these tires are about when you start up

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.660 
these tires are about when you start up
car<00:05:28.540> your<00:05:28.690> fastest<00:05:29.080> lap<00:05:29.170> as<00:05:29.380> a<00:05:29.440> person<00:05:29.770> and<00:05:30.460> so

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:30.670 
car your fastest lap as a person and so

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:32.010 
car your fastest lap as a person and so
that's<00:05:30.820> the<00:05:30.940> biggest<00:05:31.120> difference<00:05:31.330> obviously

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:32.020 
that's the biggest difference obviously

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:34.200 
that's the biggest difference obviously
you<00:05:32.680> have<00:05:32.800> to<00:05:32.860> maintain<00:05:33.040> speed<00:05:33.580> movies<00:05:33.940> just

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:34.210 
you have to maintain speed movies just

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:36.150 
you have to maintain speed movies just
as<00:05:34.360> doing<00:05:34.720> the<00:05:34.780> cup<00:05:34.930> cars<00:05:35.170> but<00:05:35.380> I<00:05:35.650> was<00:05:35.890> able<00:05:36.010> to

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:36.160 
as doing the cup cars but I was able to

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:37.620 
as doing the cup cars but I was able to
generate<00:05:36.340> more<00:05:36.670> force<00:05:36.730> into<00:05:37.180> the<00:05:37.270> braking

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:37.630 
generate more force into the braking

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:38.820 
generate more force into the braking
zones<00:05:37.840> and<00:05:38.110> generate<00:05:38.410> more<00:05:38.440> speed<00:05:38.680> through

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:38.830 
zones and generate more speed through

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:41.010 
zones and generate more speed through
corners<00:05:39.370> and<00:05:39.880> just<00:05:40.120> understanding<00:05:40.690> the<00:05:40.750> cars

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:41.020 
corners and just understanding the cars

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:45.390 
corners and just understanding the cars
capability<00:05:41.650> every<00:05:42.130> lap<00:05:43.890> just<00:05:44.890> the<00:05:45.130> wrecked

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:45.400 
capability every lap just the wrecked

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:46.500 
capability every lap just the wrecked
half<00:05:45.550> of<00:05:45.700> the<00:05:45.760> fun<00:05:45.910> of<00:05:46.000> me<00:05:46.090> and<00:05:46.240> I<00:05:46.300> didn't<00:05:46.480> have

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:46.510 
half of the fun of me and I didn't have

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:48.480 
half of the fun of me and I didn't have
anywhere<00:05:46.810> to<00:05:46.870> go<00:05:46.990> but<00:05:47.140> this<00:05:48.070> stuff<00:05:48.280> keeps

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:48.490 
anywhere to go but this stuff keeps

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:50.760 
anywhere to go but this stuff keeps
going<00:05:48.760> on<00:05:48.880> then<00:05:49.210> are<00:05:49.930> you<00:05:50.080> people<00:05:50.380> at<00:05:50.470> home<00:05:50.590> can

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:50.770 
going on then are you people at home can

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:53.850 
going on then are you people at home can
bring<00:05:50.980> your<00:05:51.040> own<00:05:51.160> car<00:05:51.430> dinner<00:05:51.640> in
