 Also Thank you for seeing the athlete project Morita venue straight today 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:32.770
 The point of today's video is here 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:32.770
 I think if you can work on daily practice while being aware of the points of this video 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:46.120
 Today I will introduce how to use the backslip waist 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:50.350
 I think you've understood quite a lot of strong rolling 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:56.260
 The water inlet to the body will continue to grow in rolling a hand 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:01:02.860
 And if only the body gets wet in that state, the upper body is 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:06.140
 Marlowe and the season, but the last thing is that interest gets in the way of its rolling 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:13.159
 There to me it is around since the beginning of the Te 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:13.850
 And again not proposed I also come to see, but in order to go create another where the driving force 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:20.150
 Is 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:26.130
 I'll put put the left hip also When you become the right hand the last waist After the news 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:34.289
 Then, as in the case of the left hand'll put the right of typographical errors 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:39.060
 This queue Ya by you and are'll Once So naturally the incoming water is waist enters 

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:45.180
 You can roll but it will increase, so also the horn speed of the catch 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:51.430
 That because it is accelerated and the hand will not stop this waist contains the body enters a jerk 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:55.620
 Therefore, it will be easier to catch naturally, so please try it 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:02:01.820

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:01.820
