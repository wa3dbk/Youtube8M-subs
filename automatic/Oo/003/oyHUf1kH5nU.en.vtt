going to show you if I can in there

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.750 
going to show you if I can in there
there's<00:01:05.420> looks<00:01:05.780> like<00:01:05.930> one<00:01:06.170> clip<00:01:06.620> plastic<00:01:07.550> clip

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:07.760 
there's looks like one clip plastic clip

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.550 
there's looks like one clip plastic clip
that's<00:01:08.000> holding<00:01:08.330> it<00:01:08.420> on<00:01:08.540> if<00:01:09.140> you<00:01:09.230> can<00:01:09.410> try<00:01:09.530> to

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.560 
that's holding it on if you can try to

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:10.990 
that's holding it on if you can try to
work<00:01:09.800> it<00:01:09.980> to<00:01:10.100> get<00:01:10.250> it<00:01:10.370> out<00:01:10.490> without<00:01:10.700> breaking

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.000 
work it to get it out without breaking

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.750 
work it to get it out without breaking
it<00:01:11.330> cool<00:01:11.570> if<00:01:11.840> not<00:01:12.020> it's<00:01:12.560> probably<00:01:13.070> a<00:01:13.130> few<00:01:13.490> cents

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:13.760 
it cool if not it's probably a few cents

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.640 
it cool if not it's probably a few cents

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.969 

all<00:01:19.390> right<00:01:19.540> here's<00:01:19.840> the<00:01:19.900> clips<00:01:20.260> I<00:01:20.470> was<00:01:20.620> talking

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:20.979 
all right here's the clips I was talking

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:22.590 
all right here's the clips I was talking
about<00:01:21.040> I<00:01:21.310> actually<00:01:21.520> broke<00:01:21.970> them<00:01:22.180> here<00:01:22.390> that

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:22.600 
about I actually broke them here that

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.090 
about I actually broke them here that
one's<00:01:22.750> almost<00:01:23.020> intact<00:01:23.350> you<00:01:23.560> can<00:01:23.680> kind<00:01:23.860> of<00:01:23.920> see

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100 
one's almost intact you can kind of see

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.080 
one's almost intact you can kind of see
what<00:01:24.310> it<00:01:24.400> looks<00:01:24.580> like<00:01:25.080> on<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:27.640> inside<00:01:27.760> of<00:01:28.060> that

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090 
what it looks like on the inside of that

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.010 
what it looks like on the inside of that
front<00:01:28.510> part<00:01:28.720> of<00:01:28.930> the<00:01:29.050> rear<00:01:29.229> fender<00:01:29.470> flare<00:01:31.020> you

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.020 
front part of the rear fender flare you

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.320 
front part of the rear fender flare you
can<00:01:32.229> see<00:01:32.470> how<00:01:33.010> they're<00:01:33.310> aligned<00:01:33.760> in<00:01:33.940> there<00:01:34.119> I

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:34.330 
can see how they're aligned in there I

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:36.570 
can see how they're aligned in there I
tried<00:01:35.110> to<00:01:35.229> pop<00:01:35.440> them<00:01:35.650> off<00:01:35.830> but<00:01:36.160> since<00:01:36.369> they

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:36.580 
tried to pop them off but since they

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:38.310 
tried to pop them off but since they
were<00:01:36.610> opposing<00:01:37.119> different<00:01:37.690> ways<00:01:37.840> I<00:01:37.869> ended<00:01:38.259> up

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.320 
were opposing different ways I ended up

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.410 
were opposing different ways I ended up
breaking<00:01:38.470> one<00:01:38.860> really<00:01:39.130> bad<00:01:39.310> and<00:01:39.550> then<00:01:40.300> the

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:40.420 
breaking one really bad and then the

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.630 
breaking one really bad and then the
other<00:01:40.540> one<00:01:40.720> kind<00:01:40.900> of<00:01:41.020> broke<00:01:41.229> a<00:01:41.350> little<00:01:41.590> bit<00:01:41.740> try

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640 
other one kind of broke a little bit try

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.090 
other one kind of broke a little bit try
to<00:01:42.700> get<00:01:42.880> it<00:01:43.000> off<00:01:43.119> in<00:01:43.300> tact<00:01:43.540> but<00:01:43.890> didn't<00:01:44.890> work<00:01:45.070> so

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:45.100 
to get it off in tact but didn't work so

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.130 
to get it off in tact but didn't work so
well<00:01:45.520> so<00:01:45.759> you<00:01:46.000> can<00:01:46.090> see<00:01:46.240> these<00:01:46.420> rubber<00:01:46.570> gaskets

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140 
well so you can see these rubber gaskets

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.310 
well so you can see these rubber gaskets
are<00:01:47.290> all<00:01:47.520> dork<00:01:48.520> tup<00:01:48.759> here<00:01:49.060> so<00:01:49.330> I'll<00:01:49.570> probably<00:01:49.780> I

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:50.320 
are all dork tup here so I'll probably I

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.410 
are all dork tup here so I'll probably I
think<00:01:51.130> I<00:01:51.190> might<00:01:51.340> try<00:01:51.729> and<00:01:51.850> weld<00:01:52.060> the<00:01:52.210> holeshot

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
think I might try and weld the holeshot

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.580 
think I might try and weld the holeshot
on<00:01:52.810> the<00:01:52.930> fenders<00:01:53.320> but<00:01:53.910> I'll<00:01:54.910> think<00:01:55.090> about<00:01:55.240> it

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
on the fenders but I'll think about it

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.139 
on the fenders but I'll think about it
so<00:01:56.590> there's<00:01:56.890> the<00:01:57.070> first<00:01:57.280> part<00:01:57.460> of<00:01:57.759> the<00:01:57.880> front

00:01:58.139 --> 00:01:58.149 
so there's the first part of the front

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:03.150 
so there's the first part of the front
rear<00:01:58.330> fender<00:02:00.330> and<00:02:01.470> I'll<00:02:02.470> get<00:02:02.710> to<00:02:02.860> the<00:02:02.979> next

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:03.160 
rear fender and I'll get to the next

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.400 
rear fender and I'll get to the next
part<00:02:03.490> here<00:02:03.610> so<00:02:04.119> the<00:02:04.570> back<00:02:04.780> part<00:02:05.110> of<00:02:05.170> the<00:02:05.259> rear

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:05.410 
part here so the back part of the rear

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:08.160 
part here so the back part of the rear
fender<00:02:05.820> the<00:02:06.820> back<00:02:07.030> part<00:02:07.330> you<00:02:07.479> can<00:02:07.660> see<00:02:07.960> has

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
fender the back part you can see has

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:21.780 
pull it off you'll find that there is

00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:24.080 
pull it off you'll find that there is
one<00:07:21.930> clip<00:07:22.530> there<00:07:22.800> of<00:07:23.070> course<00:07:23.370> I<00:07:23.550> broke<00:07:23.790> that

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:24.090 
one clip there of course I broke that

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:27.440 
one clip there of course I broke that
because<00:07:24.570> I<00:07:24.690> wasn't<00:07:24.960> patient<00:07:25.340> but<00:07:26.340> uh<00:07:26.450> there's

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:27.450 
because I wasn't patient but uh there's

00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:29.420 
because I wasn't patient but uh there's
taken<00:07:27.960> off<00:07:28.110> so<00:07:28.500> now<00:07:28.770> you<00:07:28.830> can<00:07:29.010> probably<00:07:29.100> take<00:07:29.370> a

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:29.430 
taken off so now you can probably take a

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:32.840 
taken off so now you can probably take a
rubber<00:07:29.670> eraser<00:07:30.980> first<00:07:31.980> I'd<00:07:32.160> wash<00:07:32.400> it<00:07:32.610> to<00:07:32.730> get

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:32.850
