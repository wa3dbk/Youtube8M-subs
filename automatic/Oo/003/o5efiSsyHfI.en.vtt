runt that they'll do when they're eating
actually<00:02:07.420> eating<00:02:07.720> the<00:02:07.750> food<00:02:10.799> yeah<00:02:11.799> like<00:02:12.099> that

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
actually eating the food yeah like that

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.460 
actually eating the food yeah like that
and<00:02:12.730> they'll<00:02:13.030> do<00:02:13.209> that<00:02:13.420> kind<00:02:13.930> of<00:02:13.989> rhythmically

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
and they'll do that kind of rhythmically

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:16.259 
and they'll do that kind of rhythmically
while<00:02:14.769> I'm<00:02:14.890> petting<00:02:15.190> them<00:02:15.430> or<00:02:15.730> scratching

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:16.269 
while I'm petting them or scratching

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:17.220 
while I'm petting them or scratching
their<00:02:16.390> bellies<00:02:16.720> they<00:02:16.870> could<00:02:17.049> actually

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
their bellies they could actually

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.800 
their bellies they could actually
straighten<00:02:17.739> their<00:02:18.069> tail<00:02:18.310> and<00:02:18.670> I<00:02:19.090> think<00:02:19.660> it's

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
straighten their tail and I think it's

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.110 
straighten their tail and I think it's
an<00:02:19.959> expression<00:02:20.500> of<00:02:20.980> things<00:02:21.549> they<00:02:21.819> can<00:02:21.940> get<00:02:22.000> the

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
an expression of things they can get the

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.120 
an expression of things they can get the
tail<00:02:22.299> of<00:02:22.329> firm<00:02:22.660> anytime<00:02:23.079> there<00:02:23.230> yeah<00:02:23.829> I<00:02:23.860> think

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
tail of firm anytime there yeah I think

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.970 
tail of firm anytime there yeah I think
it's<00:02:24.700> a<00:02:24.819> relaxed<00:02:25.599> state<00:02:25.870> it's<00:02:26.470> actually<00:02:26.860> going

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
it's a relaxed state it's actually going

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.620 
it's a relaxed state it's actually going
to<00:02:27.040> be<00:02:27.099> coiled<00:02:27.610> depending<00:02:28.000> on<00:02:28.090> what<00:02:28.299> kind<00:02:28.480> of

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
to be coiled depending on what kind of

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:30.000 
to be coiled depending on what kind of
pig<00:02:28.810> it<00:02:28.900> is<00:02:28.989> when<00:02:29.200> they<00:02:29.319> are<00:02:29.380> relaxed<00:02:29.920> and

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
pig it is when they are relaxed and

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:31.199 
pig it is when they are relaxed and
they're<00:02:30.160> walking<00:02:30.340> around<00:02:30.610> eating<00:02:31.060> or

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 
they're walking around eating or

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:33.390 
they're walking around eating or
foraging<00:02:31.690> their<00:02:32.079> tails<00:02:32.350> will<00:02:32.500> be<00:02:32.620> curly<00:02:33.069> but

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
foraging their tails will be curly but

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.470 
foraging their tails will be curly but
when<00:02:33.519> they're<00:02:33.639> excited<00:02:34.090> it<00:02:34.239> actually

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
when they're excited it actually

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.900 
when they're excited it actually
straightens<00:02:35.049> out<00:02:35.230> they<00:02:35.739> both<00:02:35.980> actually<00:02:36.609> have

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
straightens out they both actually have

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:38.520 
straightens out they both actually have
a<00:02:36.940> lot<00:02:37.239> of<00:02:37.299> hair<00:02:37.600> it's<00:02:37.750> very<00:02:37.900> coarse<00:02:38.319> and

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
a lot of hair it's very coarse and

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.099 
a lot of hair it's very coarse and
bristly<00:02:38.590> it<00:02:39.579> would<00:02:39.940> if<00:02:40.150> there<00:02:40.359> are<00:02:40.510> wild<00:02:40.900> pigs

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:41.109 
bristly it would if there are wild pigs

00:02:41.109 --> 00:02:42.390 
bristly it would if there are wild pigs
and<00:02:41.260> they<00:02:41.319> are<00:02:41.380> living<00:02:41.560> out<00:02:41.769> in<00:02:41.889> the<00:02:41.920> woods<00:02:42.130> it

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
and they are living out in the woods it

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.610 
and they are living out in the woods it
would<00:02:42.489> protect<00:02:42.880> their<00:02:43.090> skin<00:02:43.299> on<00:02:43.690> the<00:02:44.380> hair

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
would protect their skin on the hair

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:45.930 
would protect their skin on the hair
because<00:02:44.920> it's<00:02:45.069> so<00:02:45.220> course<00:02:45.549> if<00:02:45.790> they<00:02:45.880> were

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
because it's so course if they were

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.789 
because it's so course if they were
going<00:02:46.209> through<00:02:46.239> the<00:02:46.480> brush<00:02:46.690> the<00:02:47.230> undergrowth

00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:47.799 
going through the brush the undergrowth

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:51.210 
going through the brush the undergrowth
and<00:02:48.329> they<00:02:49.329> actually<00:02:49.510> do<00:02:49.780> shut<00:02:50.079> it<00:02:50.200> out<00:02:50.319> so<00:02:51.100> at

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
and they actually do shut it out so at

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:52.590 
and they actually do shut it out so at
some<00:02:51.340> points<00:02:51.670> when<00:02:51.790> you<00:02:51.819> come<00:02:52.120> here<00:02:52.299> to<00:02:52.420> visit

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:52.600 
some points when you come here to visit

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.960 
some points when you come here to visit
you'll<00:02:53.200> see<00:02:53.470> some<00:02:53.950> naked<00:02:54.220> piggies<00:02:54.760> because

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
you'll see some naked piggies because

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.000 
you'll see some naked piggies because
they'll<00:02:55.120> there<00:02:55.450> their<00:02:55.870> harems<00:02:56.260> just<00:02:56.590> shut<00:02:56.799> out

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
they'll there their harems just shut out

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:58.979 
they'll there their harems just shut out
and<00:02:57.250> then<00:02:57.730> they'll<00:02:57.910> grow<00:02:58.060> in<00:02:58.209> a<00:02:58.239> thick

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989 
and then they'll grow in a thick

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:01.140 
and then they'll grow in a thick
luxurious<00:02:59.230> coat<00:02:59.950> pigs<00:03:00.370> when<00:03:00.730> they<00:03:00.970> get

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
luxurious coat pigs when they get

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.270 
luxurious coat pigs when they get
overheated<00:03:01.569> they<00:03:02.290> need<00:03:02.470> to<00:03:02.650> be<00:03:02.769> able<00:03:02.799> to<00:03:03.100> get

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
overheated they need to be able to get

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:04.440 
overheated they need to be able to get
rid<00:03:03.400> of<00:03:03.430> the<00:03:03.609> heat<00:03:03.819> so<00:03:04.000> they<00:03:04.120> could<00:03:04.269> roll

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
rid of the heat so they could roll

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.870 
rid of the heat so they could roll
around<00:03:04.480> in<00:03:04.780> the<00:03:04.840> mud<00:03:04.930> and<00:03:05.430> then<00:03:06.430> the<00:03:06.579> water

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
around in the mud and then the water

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.140 
around in the mud and then the water
will<00:03:07.090> evaporate<00:03:07.150> off<00:03:07.930> of<00:03:08.170> them<00:03:08.380> and<00:03:08.590> also<00:03:09.549> they

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
will evaporate off of them and also they

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.080 
will evaporate off of them and also they
it<00:03:10.810> can<00:03:11.139> protect<00:03:11.530> them<00:03:11.769> from<00:03:12.069> insect<00:03:12.519> bites<00:03:12.790> if

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
it can protect them from insect bites if

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.300 
it can protect them from insect bites if
there's<00:03:13.299> a<00:03:13.389> thick<00:03:13.599> covering<00:03:13.959> mud<00:03:14.230> and<00:03:14.440> also

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
there's a thick covering mud and also

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.160 
there's a thick covering mud and also
sunburn<00:03:15.790> so<00:03:16.000> it's<00:03:16.269> a<00:03:16.389> sunscreen<00:03:16.750> as<00:03:17.019> well

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
sunburn so it's a sunscreen as well

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:19.740 
sunburn so it's a sunscreen as well
they're<00:03:17.560> very<00:03:17.799> very<00:03:18.010> smart<00:03:18.519> them<00:03:18.880> they<00:03:19.540> can
