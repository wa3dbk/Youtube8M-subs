My name is Robert Janásek and I work as marketing manager in Lenovo Czech Republic.

00:00:09.725 --> 00:00:14.168
This autumn we are celebrating the 20th anniversary of ThinkPad laptops.

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:18.307
The very first ThinkPad laptop was launched
on market in 1992

00:00:18.308 --> 00:00:23.308
and since then ThinkPad laptops have been bringing the best and most up-to-date technology solutions to their users.

00:00:23.887 --> 00:00:30.158
We can say that improvement, innovation and  perfection are literally encoded in ThinkPad's DNA.

00:00:30.485 --> 00:00:32.871
The most significant symbol of ThinkPad laptops is the TrackPoint,

00:00:32.872 --> 00:00:37.459
a little red dot in the middle of the keyboard which is symbolically present even in the ThinkPad logo.

00:00:38.582 --> 00:00:45.010
On the occasion of ThinkPad's 20th anniversary, we have prepared a limited Special Edition of golden TrackPoints.

00:00:45.633 --> 00:00:50.517
My name is Vlastimil Kalaš, I work as goldsmith and jeweler and I specialize in custom manufacturing.

00:00:50.544 --> 00:00:59.061
Lenovo contacted me with a request to produce a prototype of a fully-functional component - TrackPoint.

00:00:59.605 --> 00:01:04.744
This prototype was a success, wherefore I was asked to produce a whole set of these components.

00:01:04.745 --> 00:01:10.444
This golden TrackPoint is made of 14-carat gold

00:01:10.445 --> 00:01:13.643
and works just like the original made of rubber.

00:01:50.338 --> 00:01:57.135
