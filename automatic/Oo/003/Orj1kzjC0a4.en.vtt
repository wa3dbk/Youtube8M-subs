00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
the problem is there is no OS 10 blu-ray

the problem is there is no OS 10 blu-ray
playback<00:00:49.800> software<00:00:50.219> that<00:00:50.610> we've<00:00:50.730> seen

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
playback software that we've seen

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.330 
playback software that we've seen
anywhere<00:00:51.539> so<00:00:52.440> you<00:00:52.500> are<00:00:52.620> stuck<00:00:53.010> with<00:00:53.039> a<00:00:53.160> weird

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
anywhere so you are stuck with a weird

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.369 
anywhere so you are stuck with a weird
thing<00:00:53.610> like<00:00:54.149> boot<00:00:54.449> camp<00:00:54.480> and<00:00:54.960> booting<00:00:55.260> into

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
thing like boot camp and booting into

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.490 
thing like boot camp and booting into
windows<00:00:55.760> look<00:00:56.760> you<00:00:57.239> could<00:00:57.510> try<00:00:57.899> vmware<00:00:58.469> fusion

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
windows look you could try vmware fusion

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.260 
windows look you could try vmware fusion
and<00:00:59.010> parallel<00:00:59.399> so<00:00:59.550> basically<00:00:59.850> our<00:00:59.879> emulation

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
and parallel so basically our emulation

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.549 
and parallel so basically our emulation
software<00:01:00.449> to<00:01:00.870> let<00:01:01.020> you<00:01:01.140> run<00:01:01.350> windows

under<00:01:07.530> them<00:01:07.740> because<00:01:07.950> I<00:01:07.979> believe<00:01:08.400> hdcp<00:01:09.090> gets

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
under them because I believe hdcp gets

under them because I believe hdcp gets

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
broken through the virtualization pass

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.050 
broken through the virtualization pass
through<00:01:13.189> we<00:01:14.189> got<00:01:14.340> all<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.520> major<00:01:14.729> blu-ray

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
home theater PC software on the way so

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:17.929 
home theater PC software on the way so
we'll<00:01:16.950> do<00:01:17.070> our<00:01:17.189> best<00:01:17.220> to<00:01:17.460> get<00:01:17.520> them<00:01:17.640> running<00:01:17.790> on

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
we'll do our best to get them running on

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.030 
we'll do our best to get them running on
OS<00:01:18.030> 10<00:01:18.360> too<00:01:18.630> because<00:01:19.170> there's<00:01:19.650> a<00:01:19.740> couple<00:01:19.890> of

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
OS 10 too because there's a couple of

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.440

check<00:01:21.720> out<00:01:21.840> but<00:01:22.049> so<00:01:22.229> far<00:01:22.470> right<00:01:22.740> now<00:01:22.770> I<00:01:22.950> think

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
check out but so far right now I think

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.550 
check out but so far right now I think
your<00:01:23.430> stuff<00:01:23.670> is<00:01:23.970> you're<00:01:24.869> stuck<00:01:25.200> doing<00:01:25.409> the

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
your stuff is you're stuck doing the

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.830 
your stuff is you're stuck doing the
weird<00:01:25.830> stuff<00:01:26.040> until<00:01:26.880> apple<00:01:27.299> launches<00:01:27.659> their

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
weird stuff until apple launches their

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.330 
weird stuff until apple launches their
own<00:01:27.960> sovereign<00:01:28.409> that's<00:01:28.650> compatible<00:01:28.920> to<00:01:29.189> play

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
own sovereign that's compatible to play

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.310 
own sovereign that's compatible to play
back<00:01:29.520> as<00:01:29.700> well<00:01:29.880> that<00:01:30.479> data<00:01:30.900> would<00:01:31.049> assume

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
back as well that data would assume

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.450 
back as well that data would assume
would<00:01:31.350> happen<00:01:31.710> sooner<00:01:31.890> rather<00:01:32.040> than<00:01:32.400> later

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
would happen sooner rather than later

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.249 
would happen sooner rather than later
but<00:01:32.820> I<00:01:33.060> haven't<00:01:33.360> seen<00:01:33.570> an<00:01:33.659> announcement<00:01:34.140> yet
