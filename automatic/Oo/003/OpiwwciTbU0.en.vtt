GCSE biology syllabus statement 331 and

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.940 
GCSE biology syllabus statement 331 and
here<00:00:06.240> we're<00:00:06.420> describing<00:00:06.839> the<00:00:07.259> process<00:00:07.470> of

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
here we're describing the process of

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.060 
here we're describing the process of
evolution<00:00:08.130> by<00:00:08.809> means<00:00:09.809> of<00:00:10.170> natural<00:00:10.889> selection

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
evolution by means of natural selection

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:18.650 
evolution by means of natural selection
evolution<00:00:16.010> we<00:00:17.010> will<00:00:17.190> define<00:00:17.670> in<00:00:18.119> a<00:00:18.270> couple<00:00:18.570> of

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
evolution we will define in a couple of

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.010 
evolution we will define in a couple of
different<00:00:18.930> ways<00:00:18.990> the<00:00:19.740> first<00:00:20.010> one<00:00:20.279> is<00:00:20.490> a<00:00:21.150> change

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
different ways the first one is a change

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:31.020 
different ways the first one is a change
in<00:00:23.449> the<00:00:24.449> form<00:00:25.230> of<00:00:27.230> organisms

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:31.030 

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:32.940 

or<00:00:31.600> perhaps<00:00:31.810> you<00:00:32.110> could<00:00:32.260> think<00:00:32.410> of<00:00:32.590> that<00:00:32.619> as

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:32.950 
or perhaps you could think of that as

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:37.400 
or perhaps you could think of that as
the<00:00:33.930> new<00:00:34.930> forms<00:00:35.380> of<00:00:35.560> organisms<00:00:36.370> arising<00:00:37.060> and

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
the new forms of organisms arising and

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.500 
the new forms of organisms arising and
the<00:00:38.410> second<00:00:38.950> version<00:00:39.220> of<00:00:39.490> this<00:00:39.760> which<00:00:40.060> is<00:00:40.480> a

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:40.510 
the second version of this which is a

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:46.850 
the second version of this which is a
little<00:00:40.660> bit<00:00:40.840> more<00:00:40.990> technical<00:00:41.290> is<00:00:42.480> a<00:00:43.480> change<00:00:44.350> in

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.600 

the<00:00:47.860> frequency

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.370 

so<00:00:51.210> that's<00:00:51.420> just<00:00:51.540> how<00:00:52.290> many<00:00:53.750> so<00:00:54.750> a<00:00:54.780> change<00:00:55.200> in

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:55.380 
so that's just how many so a change in

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:02.780 
so that's just how many so a change in
the<00:00:55.470> frequency<00:00:55.650> of<00:00:56.810> alleles<00:01:01.790> natural

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:02.790 
the frequency of alleles natural

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:08.280 
the frequency of alleles natural
selection

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:08.290 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:13.560 

is<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:09.400> mechanism

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:13.570 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:18.640 

of<00:01:14.159> evolution

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:18.650 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.870 

and<00:01:18.890> was<00:01:19.700> first<00:01:20.000> proposed<00:01:20.540> as<00:01:20.930> you<00:01:21.170> know<00:01:21.380> by

in this example I'm going to illustrate

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:33.310 
in this example I'm going to illustrate
a<00:01:30.140> change<00:01:30.950> in<00:01:31.220> allele<00:01:31.490> frequency<00:01:32.420> by<00:01:32.870> means<00:01:33.110> of

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:33.320 
a change in allele frequency by means of

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.760 
a change in allele frequency by means of
natural<00:01:33.800> selection<00:01:33.979> in<00:01:34.580> an<00:01:35.390> example<00:01:36.490> which

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:19.950 

so<00:02:18.340> the<00:02:18.460> organism<00:02:19.060> that<00:02:19.090> we're<00:02:19.420> looking<00:02:19.540> at

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:19.960 
so the organism that we're looking at

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:26.300 
so the organism that we're looking at
evolving<00:02:20.590> is<00:02:20.800> staphylococcus<00:02:21.730> aureus<00:02:24.510> the

evolving is staphylococcus aureus the

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.180 
evolving is staphylococcus aureus the
normal<00:02:27.310> form<00:02:27.700> of<00:02:28.290> staphylococcus<00:02:29.290> aureus<00:02:29.650> or

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:32.320 
the original form of staphylococcus

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:36.450 
the original form of staphylococcus
aureus<00:02:32.440> is<00:02:33.900> susceptible<00:02:34.900> to<00:02:35.740> being<00:02:35.890> killed<00:02:36.220> by

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:36.460 
aureus is susceptible to being killed by

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:38.640 
aureus is susceptible to being killed by
this<00:02:36.520> molecule<00:02:36.910> here<00:02:37.480> this<00:02:37.690> molecule<00:02:37.930> here<00:02:38.470> is

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
this molecule here this molecule here is

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:44.870 
this molecule here this molecule here is
called<00:02:39.340> methicillin<00:02:42.450> and<00:02:43.450> it's<00:02:44.200> a<00:02:44.320> type<00:02:44.650> of

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
called methicillin and it's a type of

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:51.230 
called methicillin and it's a type of
antibiotic<00:02:47.760> so<00:02:48.760> this<00:02:48.910> chemical<00:02:49.530> kills

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:51.240 
antibiotic so this chemical kills

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.280 
antibiotic so this chemical kills
staphylococcus<00:02:52.240> aureus<00:02:52.480> and<00:02:52.810> those

mutation<00:03:44.599> a<00:03:47.080> random<00:03:48.080> mutation<00:03:48.230> to<00:03:49.040> the<00:03:49.159> genome

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:49.640 
mutation a random mutation to the genome

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:52.839 
mutation a random mutation to the genome
of<00:03:49.900> staphylococcus<00:03:50.900> aureus<00:03:51.110> which<00:03:51.849> allowed

00:03:52.839 --> 00:03:52.849 
of staphylococcus aureus which allowed

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:55.119 
of staphylococcus aureus which allowed
it<00:03:53.060> to<00:03:53.269> develop<00:03:53.840> the<00:03:54.170> characteristic<00:03:54.980> of

00:03:55.119 --> 00:03:55.129 
it to develop the characteristic of

00:03:55.129 --> 00:04:04.910 
it to develop the characteristic of
breaking<00:03:55.730> down<00:03:56.230> methicillin<00:03:57.230> on

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.430 

because<00:04:05.730> it<00:04:05.970> can<00:04:06.150> break<00:04:06.390> down<00:04:06.420> methicillin<00:04:07.349> on

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
because it can break down methicillin on

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.440 
because it can break down methicillin on
it<00:04:07.650> is<00:04:08.130> no<00:04:08.310> longer<00:04:08.490> killed<00:04:09.030> by<00:04:09.390> this

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.450 
it is no longer killed by this

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:13.449 
it is no longer killed by this
antibiotic<00:04:10.110> and<00:04:10.880> we<00:04:11.880> describe<00:04:12.300> this<00:04:12.780> kind<00:04:13.200> of

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:13.459 
antibiotic and we describe this kind of

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:16.580 
antibiotic and we describe this kind of
staphylococcus<00:04:14.459> aureus<00:04:14.640> as<00:04:15.060> the<00:04:15.810> resistant

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
staphylococcus aureus as the resistant

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:23.560 
staphylococcus aureus as the resistant
form

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:23.570 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:26.980 

so<00:04:24.170> what<00:04:24.350> we<00:04:24.500> noticed<00:04:24.890> then<00:04:25.190> is<00:04:25.400> that<00:04:26.180> if<00:04:26.570> we

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:26.990 
so what we noticed then is that if we

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:31.750 
so what we noticed then is that if we
draw<00:04:28.090> an<00:04:29.090> extra<00:04:29.360> bar<00:04:29.690> here<00:04:30.050> to<00:04:30.230> represent<00:04:30.760> the

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:31.760 
draw an extra bar here to represent the

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:36.580 
draw an extra bar here to represent the
resistant<00:04:32.330> form<00:04:33.280> here<00:04:34.280> we<00:04:34.460> have<00:04:35.590> methicillin

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.590 
resistant form here we have methicillin

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:38.890 
resistant form here we have methicillin
and<00:04:36.740> susceptible<00:04:37.660> staphylococcus<00:04:38.660> aureus

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:38.900 
and susceptible staphylococcus aureus

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:40.900 
and susceptible staphylococcus aureus
the<00:04:39.380> one<00:04:39.560> that<00:04:39.740> dies<00:04:40.010> when<00:04:40.310> treated<00:04:40.670> with<00:04:40.730> the

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:40.910 
the one that dies when treated with the

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:46.170 
the one that dies when treated with the
antibiotic<00:04:41.600> and<00:04:41.750> here<00:04:42.740> we<00:04:43.460> have<00:04:43.670> the

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.180 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:48.430 

methicillin-resistant<00:04:47.440> staphylococcus

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:48.440 
methicillin-resistant staphylococcus

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:53.670 
methicillin-resistant staphylococcus
aureus<00:04:48.700> so<00:04:49.700> now<00:04:49.880> we've<00:04:50.090> got<00:04:50.360> two<00:04:50.990> forms<00:04:51.740> of<00:04:52.010> the

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 
aureus so now we've got two forms of the

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.290 
aureus so now we've got two forms of the
bacteria<00:04:54.680> which<00:04:55.160> you'll<00:04:55.340> remember<00:04:55.670> having

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:56.300 
bacteria which you'll remember having

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.360 
bacteria which you'll remember having
different<00:04:56.810> forms<00:04:57.350> was<00:04:57.890> one<00:04:58.130> of<00:04:58.250> our

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:58.370 
different forms was one of our

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:03.820 
different forms was one of our
definitions<00:04:59.000> of<00:04:59.180> evolution<00:05:02.830> when

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:03.830 
definitions of evolution when

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:06.130 
definitions of evolution when
antibiotics<00:05:04.160> are<00:05:04.790> applied<00:05:05.330> to<00:05:05.720> the

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:06.140 
antibiotics are applied to the

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:10.410 
antibiotics are applied to the
population<00:05:07.570> this<00:05:08.570> one<00:05:08.900> this<00:05:09.350> population<00:05:10.220> is

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:10.420 
population this one this population is

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:14.910 
population this one this population is
decreased<00:05:11.710> but<00:05:12.710> because<00:05:13.220> this<00:05:13.820> form<00:05:14.270> here<00:05:14.330> is

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:14.920 
decreased but because this form here is

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:19.570 
decreased but because this form here is
resistant<00:05:15.920> to<00:05:16.630> the<00:05:17.630> antibiotic<00:05:18.380> they<00:05:19.160> become

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:19.580 
resistant to the antibiotic they become

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:24.730 
resistant to the antibiotic they become
increasingly<00:05:20.570> common<00:05:21.370> and<00:05:23.290> of<00:05:24.290> course<00:05:24.560> that

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:24.740 
increasingly common and of course that

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:27.070 
increasingly common and of course that
leads<00:05:24.950> to<00:05:25.160> our<00:05:25.190> second<00:05:26.030> definition<00:05:26.780> of

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:27.080 
leads to our second definition of

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:31.510 
leads to our second definition of
evolution<00:05:27.910> which<00:05:28.910> is<00:05:29.120> an<00:05:29.300> increase<00:05:30.080> in<00:05:30.520> the

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:31.520 
evolution which is an increase in the

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:40.830 
evolution which is an increase in the
frequency<00:05:31.820> of<00:05:32.980> the<00:05:33.980> allyl<00:05:34.720> for<00:05:35.720> resistance

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:40.840 

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.230 

there<00:05:41.470> are<00:05:41.620> two<00:05:41.919> features<00:05:42.250> to<00:05:42.760> be<00:05:42.880> noticed

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:43.240 
there are two features to be noticed

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:48.110 
there are two features to be noticed
here<00:05:43.919> the<00:05:44.919> first<00:05:45.280> one<00:05:45.550> was<00:05:45.850> the<00:05:46.180> random

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:48.120 
here the first one was the random

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:55.200 
here the first one was the random
mutation<00:05:49.919> and<00:05:51.960> the<00:05:52.960> second<00:05:53.470> one<00:05:53.710> was<00:05:53.949> the<00:05:54.699> non

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:55.210 
mutation and the second one was the non

00:05:55.210 --> 00:06:01.679 
mutation and the second one was the non
random<00:05:58.380> selection

00:06:01.679 --> 00:06:01.689 

00:06:01.689 --> 00:06:03.959 

so<00:06:02.349> there's<00:06:02.529> the<00:06:02.619> random<00:06:03.009> mutation<00:06:03.549> which

00:06:03.959 --> 00:06:03.969 
so there's the random mutation which

00:06:03.969 --> 00:06:10.079 
so there's the random mutation which
produced<00:06:04.479> the<00:06:04.629> M<00:06:05.039> are<00:06:06.039> s<00:06:06.519> a<00:06:06.909> form<00:06:07.569> and<00:06:08.819> the<00:06:09.819> non

00:06:10.079 --> 00:06:10.089 
produced the M are s a form and the non

00:06:10.089 --> 00:06:14.299 
produced the M are s a form and the non
random<00:06:10.569> selection<00:06:11.249> due<00:06:12.249> to<00:06:12.429> the<00:06:12.610> antibiotic

00:06:14.299 --> 00:06:14.309 
random selection due to the antibiotic

00:06:14.309 --> 00:06:19.529 
random selection due to the antibiotic
which<00:06:15.309> is<00:06:15.549> selecting<00:06:16.179> the<00:06:16.619> mrs<00:06:17.619> a<00:06:18.029> to<00:06:19.029> survive

00:06:19.529 --> 00:06:19.539 
which is selecting the mrs a to survive

00:06:19.539 --> 00:06:25.669 
which is selecting the mrs a to survive
and<00:06:19.929> the<00:06:20.559> m<00:06:20.860> SS<00:06:21.699> a<00:06:21.969> to<00:06:22.779> be<00:06:22.899> selected<00:06:23.499> and<00:06:23.649> killed

00:06:25.669 --> 00:06:25.679 
and the m SS a to be selected and killed

00:06:25.679 --> 00:06:29.279 
and the m SS a to be selected and killed
these<00:06:26.679> two<00:06:27.099> components<00:06:27.879> here<00:06:28.449> are<00:06:29.139> the

00:06:29.279 --> 00:06:29.289 
these two components here are the

00:06:29.289 --> 00:06:31.469 
these two components here are the
classic<00:06:29.739> features<00:06:29.949> of<00:06:30.429> the<00:06:30.729> process<00:06:31.269> of

00:06:31.469 --> 00:06:31.479 
classic features of the process of

00:06:31.479 --> 00:06:36.119 
classic features of the process of
natural<00:06:32.259> selection<00:06:34.709> it<00:06:35.709> should<00:06:35.979> be<00:06:36.009> noted

00:06:36.119 --> 00:06:36.129 
natural selection it should be noted

00:06:36.129 --> 00:06:39.439 
natural selection it should be noted
that<00:06:36.489> natural<00:06:37.059> selection<00:06:37.209> is<00:06:37.719> a<00:06:37.809> process<00:06:38.289> and

00:06:39.439 --> 00:06:39.449 
that natural selection is a process and

00:06:39.449 --> 00:06:43.229 
that natural selection is a process and
not<00:06:40.449> a<00:06:40.689> thing
