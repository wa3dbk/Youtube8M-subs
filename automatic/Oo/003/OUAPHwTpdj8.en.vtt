 wanted to 

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.980
 is awarded the golden calf 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:13.279
 for his contribution to the film of happiness to buy from pieter hoof 

00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:16.279
 and they can typically make moves 

00:00:17.749 --> 00:00:21.060
 ridiculous person in the vpro program 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.949
 and we will check them out 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.949
 fortunately can wait well for the clothes 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:37.100
 come naturally 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.190
 X 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:40.850
 barneveld 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.850
 placed a nice fall on her honors list 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.830
 the man you became your bank I watch you do it on the albert heijn 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:51.900
 the municipality of alphen chaam 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.820
 me too 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.150
 but what have they got her 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:02.060
 When we walk for weeks we also have the same length of time but we will come one more 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:03.550
 number of meters long 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:06.540
 from March this story 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:07.490
 singer 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.430
 couches standard 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.430
 salary will probably remain the wrong way 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.210
 assume a broadcast itself we have a black one 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.990
 it also appeared that you should not give directions but sit now 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:22.290
 I sometimes see a 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.770
 like that of 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.610
 the other clubs as of the kick-off place of plan 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:30.070
 get along well with him 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:31.100
 Well 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.150
 to the debate 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.150
 what do you think 8 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.920
 also enjoy those things done 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.439
 yes of course the relocation volumes are 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.820
 or is that the stadium in a youth club 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.680
 I think that is an outlet 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.860
 you that a topper 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.860
 cut down on 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:09.029
 know the association 

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:09.609
