00:04:59.820 --> 00:04:59.830 
within temptation a little bit different

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:01.020 
within temptation a little bit different
from<00:04:59.889> the<00:04:59.980> band's<00:05:00.220> I've<00:05:00.400> been<00:05:00.700> talking<00:05:00.970> about

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:02.470 
not not so much on the metal side but a

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:04.170 
not not so much on the metal side but a
little<00:05:02.620> bit<00:05:02.710> of<00:05:02.800> that<00:05:02.860> goth<00:05:03.250> rock<00:05:03.639> kind<00:05:04.120> of
