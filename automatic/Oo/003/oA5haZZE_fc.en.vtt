digital context-aware okay thanks Jake
yes<00:00:11.670> digital<00:00:12.269> context<00:00:12.840> where<00:00:13.019> dca<00:00:13.620> is<00:00:14.099> about

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
yes digital context where dca is about

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:16.430 
yes digital context where dca is about
bringing<00:00:15.179> the<00:00:15.420> right<00:00:15.630> information<00:00:15.839> right

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
bringing the right information right

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.849 
bringing the right information right
time<00:00:16.680> to<00:00:16.920> write<00:00:17.130> device<00:00:17.520> in<00:00:18.180> 2010<00:00:19.080> if<00:00:19.410> I<00:00:19.619> would

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
time to write device in 2010 if I would

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.040 
time to write device in 2010 if I would
have<00:00:19.980> taken<00:00:20.189> these<00:00:20.699> sets<00:00:21.029> of<00:00:21.210> wearables<00:00:21.689> here

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
have taken these sets of wearables here

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.050 
have taken these sets of wearables here
and<00:00:22.230> handing<00:00:23.070> them<00:00:23.220> to<00:00:23.250> an<00:00:23.580> enterprise

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
and handing them to an enterprise

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.050 
and handing them to an enterprise
resource<00:00:24.359> and<00:00:24.960> said<00:00:25.140> be<00:00:25.350> productive<00:00:25.980> I<00:00:26.250> think

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
resource and said be productive I think

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:27.980 
resource and said be productive I think
there<00:00:27.210> would<00:00:27.300> be<00:00:27.330> a<00:00:27.449> little<00:00:27.689> bit<00:00:27.840> of<00:00:27.869> a

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
there would be a little bit of a

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.509 
there would be a little bit of a
learning<00:00:28.230> curve<00:00:28.439> it<00:00:28.830> probably<00:00:29.130> take<00:00:29.250> them<00:00:29.460> a

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
learning curve it probably take them a

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.810 
learning curve it probably take them a
little<00:00:29.699> bit<00:00:29.880> of<00:00:29.910> time<00:00:30.210> today<00:00:30.960> in<00:00:31.289> 2015<00:00:32.219> Jake<00:00:32.550> I

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
little bit of time today in 2015 Jake I

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.510 
little bit of time today in 2015 Jake I
can<00:00:33.300> hand<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:33.840> enterprise<00:00:34.260> resource<00:00:34.559> these

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
can hand the enterprise resource these

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.119 
can hand the enterprise resource these
sets<00:00:36.300> of<00:00:36.450> devices<00:00:36.960> and<00:00:37.200> all<00:00:37.320> they<00:00:37.530> have<00:00:37.710> to<00:00:37.980> do

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
sets of devices and all they have to do

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.940 
sets of devices and all they have to do
is<00:00:38.250> turn<00:00:38.460> them<00:00:38.730> on<00:00:38.940> and<00:00:39.239> these<00:00:39.840> devices<00:00:40.350> will

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
is turn them on and these devices will

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.700 
is turn them on and these devices will
make<00:00:41.100> them<00:00:41.280> productive<00:00:41.460> in<00:00:42.030> their<00:00:42.210> job<00:00:42.710> we

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
make them productive in their job we

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.400 
make them productive in their job we
bring<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.100> right<00:00:44.280> information<00:00:44.550> to<00:00:45.149> device<00:00:46.140> at

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
bring the right information to device at

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.100 
bring the right information to device at
the<00:00:46.500> right<00:00:46.680> time<00:00:46.950> so<00:00:47.850> when<00:00:48.390> you<00:00:48.480> say<00:00:48.629> these

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
the right time so when you say these

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.330 
the right time so when you say these
will<00:00:49.260> make<00:00:49.379> them<00:00:49.530> productive<00:00:49.649> in<00:00:49.980> your<00:00:50.160> in

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
will make them productive in your in

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.709 
will make them productive in your in
their<00:00:50.489> job<00:00:50.670> can<00:00:50.940> you<00:00:50.969> give<00:00:51.149> me<00:00:51.210> an<00:00:51.270> example<00:00:51.329> of

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
their job can you give me an example of

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.049 
their job can you give me an example of
what<00:00:51.870> that<00:00:51.899> what<00:00:52.379> that<00:00:52.410> looks<00:00:52.680> like<00:00:52.739> yeah<00:00:53.430> yeah

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
what that what that looks like yeah yeah

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.439 
what that what that looks like yeah yeah
you<00:00:54.120> bet<00:00:54.510> so<00:00:55.110> one<00:00:55.770> example<00:00:55.920> is<00:00:56.850> all<00:00:57.149> can<00:00:57.329> do<00:00:57.420> a

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
you bet so one example is all can do a

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.020 
you bet so one example is all can do a
couple<00:00:57.780> of<00:00:57.870> examples<00:00:58.109> one<00:00:58.500> example<00:00:58.859> is<00:00:59.250> we<00:00:59.850> can

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
couple of examples one example is we can

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.910 
couple of examples one example is we can
automatically<00:01:00.660> navigate<00:01:01.289> them<00:01:01.500> around

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
automatically navigate them around

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.889 
automatically navigate them around
throughout<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.489> day<00:01:02.699> if<00:01:03.030> they're<00:01:03.300> a<00:01:03.329> person

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
throughout the day if they're a person

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.420 
throughout the day if they're a person
that's<00:01:04.080> on<00:01:04.260> a<00:01:04.320> schedule<00:01:04.860> we<00:01:05.070> know<00:01:05.220> all<00:01:05.400> about

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
that's on a schedule we know all about

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.179 
that's on a schedule we know all about
them<00:01:05.939> so<00:01:06.540> we<00:01:06.869> can<00:01:07.049> actually<00:01:07.290> turn<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:08.040> right

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
them so we can actually turn the right

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.000 
them so we can actually turn the right
device<00:01:08.400> on<00:01:08.790> navigate<00:01:09.420> them<00:01:09.659> to<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.680> location

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
device on navigate them to the location

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.039 
device on navigate them to the location
they're<00:01:11.310> supposed<00:01:11.580> to<00:01:11.640> be<00:01:11.820> at<00:01:12.049> we

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
they're supposed to be at we

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.679 
they're supposed to be at we
automatically<00:01:13.590> turn<00:01:13.830> on<00:01:13.860> another<00:01:14.280> device<00:01:14.689> are

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
automatically turn on another device are

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.300 
automatically turn on another device are
the<00:01:15.930> we<00:01:16.259> actually<00:01:16.650> send<00:01:16.860> information<00:01:17.040> to

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
the we actually send information to

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.859 
the we actually send information to
another<00:01:17.490> device<00:01:17.759> like<00:01:18.000> a<00:01:18.030> watch<00:01:18.299> when<00:01:18.750> they

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
another device like a watch when they

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.960 
another device like a watch when they
arrived<00:01:19.200> it<00:01:19.470> says<00:01:19.650> how<00:01:19.830> you<00:01:19.860> arrived<00:01:20.340> you're

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
arrived it says how you arrived you're

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.820 
arrived it says how you arrived you're
supposed<00:01:21.270> to<00:01:21.390> do<00:01:21.540> this<00:01:21.780> task<00:01:22.080> we<00:01:22.680> can

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
supposed to do this task we can

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.520 
supposed to do this task we can
automatically<00:01:23.340> turn<00:01:23.610> on<00:01:23.640> a<00:01:24.409> function<00:01:25.409> on

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
automatically turn on a function on

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.590 
automatically turn on a function on
another<00:01:25.830> device<00:01:25.979> like<00:01:26.130> a<00:01:26.430> smart<00:01:26.790> glass<00:01:27.000> that

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
another device like a smart glass that

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.120 
another device like a smart glass that
has<00:01:27.750> a<00:01:27.780> checklist<00:01:28.170> that<00:01:28.560> tells<00:01:28.890> them<00:01:29.009> exactly

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
has a checklist that tells them exactly

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.840 
has a checklist that tells them exactly
how<00:01:29.670> to<00:01:30.030> do<00:01:30.360> that<00:01:30.600> task<00:01:30.900> if<00:01:31.439> so<00:01:31.890> like<00:01:32.640> for

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
how to do that task if so like for

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.429 
how to do that task if so like for
example<00:01:32.939> I<00:01:33.210> can<00:01:33.360> have<00:01:33.479> like<00:01:33.810> a<00:01:33.840> checklist<00:01:34.170> up

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
example I can have like a checklist up

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.020 
example I can have like a checklist up
here<00:01:34.560> in<00:01:34.650> my<00:01:34.740> eye<00:01:34.770> probably<00:01:35.759> not<00:01:35.820> with<00:01:35.939> this

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
here in my eye probably not with this

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.390 
here in my eye probably not with this
person<00:01:36.210> not<00:01:36.600> just<00:01:36.630> not<00:01:37.320> this<00:01:37.770> to<00:01:37.950> you<00:01:38.070> but<00:01:38.340> you

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
person not just not this to you but you

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.730 
person not just not this to you but you
could<00:01:38.640> do<00:01:38.729> this<00:01:39.000> unit<00:01:39.390> or<00:01:39.570> another<00:01:39.810> unit<00:01:40.229> yes

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
could do this unit or another unit yes

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.609 
could do this unit or another unit yes
and<00:01:41.009> that<00:01:41.430> checklist<00:01:41.759> is<00:01:42.180> voice-activated<00:01:42.840> so

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
and that checklist is voice-activated so

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.380 
and that checklist is voice-activated so
if<00:01:43.860> you<00:01:43.979> got<00:01:44.130> stuck<00:01:44.340> on<00:01:44.640> step<00:01:44.909> three<00:01:44.939> in<00:01:45.240> that

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
if you got stuck on step three in that

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.660 
if you got stuck on step three in that
checklist<00:01:45.659> Jake<00:01:46.110> you<00:01:46.560> could<00:01:46.740> say<00:01:46.920> video<00:01:47.130> and

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
checklist Jake you could say video and

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.999 
checklist Jake you could say video and
we<00:01:48.149> can<00:01:48.329> actually<00:01:48.689> bring<00:01:48.869> up<00:01:49.079> a<00:01:49.200> video<00:01:49.380> snippet

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
we can actually bring up a video snippet

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.600 
we can actually bring up a video snippet
at<00:01:50.189> their<00:01:50.399> expert<00:01:51.090> level<00:01:51.740> expertise<00:01:52.740> level<00:01:52.979> to

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
at their expert level expertise level to

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.190 
at their expert level expertise level to
show<00:01:53.820> them<00:01:54.030> how<00:01:54.180> to<00:01:54.210> get<00:01:54.450> to<00:01:54.600> that<00:01:54.689> stuff<00:01:54.990> if

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
show them how to get to that stuff if

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.990 
show them how to get to that stuff if
that's<00:01:55.380> not<00:01:55.530> good<00:01:55.590> enough<00:01:55.829> Jake<00:01:56.280> we<00:01:56.820> can

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
that's not good enough Jake we can

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.760 
that's not good enough Jake we can
actually<00:01:57.149> they<00:01:57.659> could<00:01:57.810> actually<00:01:57.990> say<00:01:58.229> diagram

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
actually they could actually say diagram

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.740 
actually they could actually say diagram
we<00:01:59.100> would<00:01:59.280> bring<00:01:59.399> up<00:01:59.670> engineering<00:02:00.090> diagrams

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
we would bring up engineering diagrams

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.270 
we would bring up engineering diagrams
to<00:02:00.960> show<00:02:01.229> them<00:02:01.409> how<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.619> pieces<00:02:01.829> fit<00:02:02.009> together

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
to show them how the pieces fit together

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.100 
to show them how the pieces fit together
if<00:02:02.579> that's<00:02:02.729> not<00:02:02.880> good<00:02:02.939> enough<00:02:03.149> we<00:02:03.750> could<00:02:03.930> say

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
if that's not good enough we could say

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.709 
if that's not good enough we could say
hey<00:02:04.380> call<00:02:05.189> agent<00:02:05.759> and<00:02:05.909> it<00:02:06.210> would<00:02:06.390> actually

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
hey call agent and it would actually

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.650 
hey call agent and it would actually
call<00:02:06.960> a<00:02:07.229> expert<00:02:08.220> remotely<00:02:08.849> they<00:02:09.179> could<00:02:09.420> see

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
call a expert remotely they could see

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.199 
call a expert remotely they could see
exactly<00:02:10.020> what<00:02:10.470> they're<00:02:10.830> seeing<00:02:11.099> and<00:02:11.489> help

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
exactly what they're seeing and help

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.550 
exactly what they're seeing and help
them<00:02:12.390> solve<00:02:12.599> the<00:02:12.780> problem<00:02:13.110> for<00:02:13.140> mall

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
them solve the problem for mall

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.190 
them solve the problem for mall
away<00:02:13.739> so<00:02:14.459> that's<00:02:14.790> one<00:02:15.060> use<00:02:15.330> case<00:02:15.540> that<00:02:15.900> pulls

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
away so that's one use case that pulls

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.229 
away so that's one use case that pulls
together<00:02:16.410> a<00:02:16.739> lot<00:02:16.950> of<00:02:17.010> service<00:02:17.459> packages<00:02:18.030> and

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:18.239 
together a lot of service packages and

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:19.520 
together a lot of service packages and
they<00:02:18.330> don't<00:02:18.480> have<00:02:18.599> to<00:02:18.750> do<00:02:18.870> anything<00:02:19.110> except

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
they don't have to do anything except

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.620 
they don't have to do anything except
turn<00:02:19.680> on<00:02:19.860> the<00:02:19.980> devices<00:02:20.480> everything<00:02:21.480> just

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
turn on the devices everything just

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.059 
turn on the devices everything just
happens<00:02:22.140> because<00:02:22.319> we<00:02:22.530> know<00:02:22.680> all<00:02:22.770> about<00:02:22.920> that

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
happens because we know all about that

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:25.550 
happens because we know all about that
person<00:02:23.660> another<00:02:24.660> use<00:02:24.870> case<00:02:24.959> if<00:02:25.260> you<00:02:25.290> want<00:02:25.500> to

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
person another use case if you want to

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.640 
person another use case if you want to
talk<00:02:25.709> about<00:02:25.770> is<00:02:26.489> is<00:02:26.700> a<00:02:26.760> use<00:02:27.239> case<00:02:27.510> that<00:02:28.170> uses

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
talk about is is a use case that uses

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.160 
talk about is is a use case that uses
devices<00:02:29.190> like<00:02:29.310> this<00:02:29.610> and<00:02:30.080> there<00:02:31.080> are

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
devices like this and there are

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.530 
devices like this and there are
situations<00:02:31.530> where<00:02:32.220> people<00:02:32.250> are<00:02:32.700> very<00:02:33.060> extreme

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
situations where people are very extreme

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.839 
situations where people are very extreme
conditions<00:02:34.080> and<00:02:34.709> we<00:02:34.950> want<00:02:35.160> to<00:02:35.250> understand<00:02:35.700> or

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:35.849 
conditions and we want to understand or

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:37.850 
conditions and we want to understand or
they<00:02:35.880> get<00:02:36.090> dehydrated<00:02:36.330> what<00:02:37.260> what<00:02:37.590> what's

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
they get dehydrated what what what's

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.559 
they get dehydrated what what what's
going<00:02:38.190> on<00:02:38.310> with<00:02:38.550> their<00:02:38.670> biometrics<00:02:39.300> how<00:02:39.450> does

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569 
going on with their biometrics how does

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:40.550 
going on with their biometrics how does
this<00:02:39.660> tell<00:02:39.870> somebody<00:02:40.140> whether<00:02:40.290> or<00:02:40.440> not

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
this tell somebody whether or not

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.650 
this tell somebody whether or not
they're<00:02:40.709> dehydrated<00:02:40.860> yeah<00:02:41.519> so<00:02:41.910> these<00:02:42.360> types

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
they're dehydrated yeah so these types

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.340 
they're dehydrated yeah so these types
of<00:02:42.950> these<00:02:43.950> types<00:02:44.489> of<00:02:44.670> sensors<00:02:44.910> a<00:02:45.170> couple<00:02:46.170> with

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
of these types of sensors a couple with

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:48.620 
of these types of sensors a couple with
other<00:02:46.530> sensors<00:02:47.010> can<00:02:47.220> pull<00:02:47.400> biometrics<00:02:48.120> their

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
other sensors can pull biometrics their

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.930 
other sensors can pull biometrics their
emotional<00:02:49.170> state<00:02:49.230> and<00:02:49.739> determine<00:02:50.670> whether

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
emotional state and determine whether

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.710 
emotional state and determine whether
these<00:02:51.239> guys<00:02:51.510> are<00:02:52.459> in<00:02:53.459> a<00:02:53.610> good<00:02:53.790> state<00:02:54.090> whether

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
these guys are in a good state whether

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.539 
these guys are in a good state whether
from<00:02:54.989> a<00:02:55.080> biometric<00:02:55.650> stamp<00:02:55.860> or<00:02:56.100> emotional

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:56.549 
from a biometric stamp or emotional

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:59.150 
from a biometric stamp or emotional
standpoint<00:02:56.760> it<00:02:57.239> can<00:02:57.569> notify<00:02:57.870> their<00:02:58.560> boss<00:02:58.830> get

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
standpoint it can notify their boss get

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.130 
standpoint it can notify their boss get
notified<00:02:59.489> guy<00:02:59.700> next<00:02:59.970> to<00:03:00.120> them<00:03:00.420> you<00:03:00.720> can<00:03:00.900> build

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
notified guy next to them you can build

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.160 
notified guy next to them you can build
these<00:03:01.260> devices<00:03:01.620> into<00:03:02.390> hard<00:03:03.390> hats<00:03:03.660> into<00:03:04.019> the

these devices into hard hats into the

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.740 
these devices into hard hats into the
police<00:03:04.380> officers<00:03:04.980> yeah<00:03:05.370> yeah<00:03:05.640> yeah<00:03:05.849> it<00:03:06.599> has

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
police officers yeah yeah yeah it has

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.949 
police officers yeah yeah yeah it has
expanders<00:03:07.410> so<00:03:07.980> so<00:03:08.430> you<00:03:08.489> can<00:03:08.700> expand<00:03:09.030> it<00:03:09.180> out<00:03:09.330> so

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
expanders so so you can expand it out so

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:13.009 
expanders so so you can expand it out so
we<00:03:10.230> have<00:03:10.410> 400<00:03:11.310> plus<00:03:11.489> use<00:03:11.730> cases<00:03:12.030> and<00:03:12.299> growing

of the actual use cases for the digital
context-aware<00:03:28.410> but<00:03:28.739> what's<00:03:29.310> the<00:03:29.430> value

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:29.609 
context-aware but what's the value
