motion material now Polliwog on a
quarter<00:02:44.530> inch<00:02:44.710> deep<00:02:45.010> maybe<00:02:45.400> 3/8<00:02:45.880> so<00:02:46.780> we're<00:02:46.930> not

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050 
quarter inch deep maybe 3/8 so we're not

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:49.170 
quarter inch deep maybe 3/8 so we're not
asking<00:02:47.470> gold<00:02:47.710> to<00:02:47.920> drop<00:02:48.370> very<00:02:48.580> far<00:02:48.700> to<00:02:49.000> get<00:02:49.120> to

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
asking gold to drop very far to get to

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.300 
asking gold to drop very far to get to
the<00:02:49.360> bottom<00:02:49.750> I'm<00:02:50.440> gonna<00:02:50.650> keep<00:02:50.920> a<00:02:51.040> side-by-side

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
the bottom I'm gonna keep a side-by-side

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.820 
the bottom I'm gonna keep a side-by-side
motion<00:02:52.270> and<00:02:52.420> I'm<00:02:52.480> slowly<00:02:52.750> gonna<00:02:53.080> lean<00:02:53.350> my<00:02:53.560> pan

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
motion and I'm slowly gonna lean my pan

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:56.340 
motion and I'm slowly gonna lean my pan
forward<00:02:54.430> to<00:02:54.640> bring<00:02:54.880> that<00:02:55.030> gold<00:02:55.270> down<00:02:55.600> and<00:02:55.960> get

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.350 
forward to bring that gold down and get

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:58.050 
forward to bring that gold down and get
caught<00:02:56.590> up<00:02:56.770> in<00:02:56.950> that<00:02:57.130> first<00:02:57.400> riffle<00:02:57.850> of<00:02:57.970> the

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
caught up in that first riffle of the

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.720 
caught up in that first riffle of the
pan<00:02:58.330> my<00:02:59.320> lighter<00:02:59.590> materials<00:03:00.160> will<00:03:00.310> suspend

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
pan my lighter materials will suspend

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.330 
pan my lighter materials will suspend
themselves<00:03:01.300> across<00:03:01.510> the<00:03:01.840> top<00:03:02.080> and<00:03:02.980> will<00:03:03.160> give

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
themselves across the top and will give

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:04.740 
themselves across the top and will give
a<00:03:03.370> little<00:03:03.610> side<00:03:03.970> to<00:03:04.180> side

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
a little side to side

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.560 
a little side to side
maybe<00:03:05.100> 45-degree<00:03:06.100> motion<00:03:06.550> and<00:03:06.760> get<00:03:07.360> rid<00:03:07.540> of

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:07.570 
maybe 45-degree motion and get rid of

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:09.750 
maybe 45-degree motion and get rid of
some<00:03:07.690> of<00:03:07.930> that<00:03:07.959> lighter<00:03:08.290> materials<00:03:08.860> when<00:03:09.730> I

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
some of that lighter materials when I

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.820 
some of that lighter materials when I
start<00:03:10.150> to<00:03:10.270> see<00:03:10.450> my<00:03:10.570> black<00:03:10.840> sands<00:03:11.200> I'll<00:03:11.500> scoop

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:11.830 
start to see my black sands I'll scoop

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:13.620 
start to see my black sands I'll scoop
up<00:03:12.070> and<00:03:12.340> I'll<00:03:12.459> flatten<00:03:12.790> it<00:03:13.000> back<00:03:13.180> out<00:03:13.450> again

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630 
up and I'll flatten it back out again

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:15.870 
up and I'll flatten it back out again
now<00:03:14.620> I'm<00:03:14.770> crawling<00:03:14.980> about<00:03:15.160> an<00:03:15.430> eighth<00:03:15.550> of<00:03:15.730> an

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 
now I'm crawling about an eighth of an

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.479 
now I'm crawling about an eighth of an
inch<00:03:15.970> deep<00:03:16.239> not<00:03:17.110> asking<00:03:17.560> gold<00:03:17.770> to<00:03:17.890> go<00:03:18.040> too<00:03:18.100> far

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489 
inch deep not asking gold to go too far

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:21.270 
inch deep not asking gold to go too far
to<00:03:18.730> get<00:03:19.630> to<00:03:19.690> the<00:03:19.930> bottom<00:03:20.290> I'll<00:03:20.530> slowly<00:03:20.890> bring

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
to get to the bottom I'll slowly bring

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.160 
to get to the bottom I'll slowly bring
it<00:03:21.310> forward<00:03:21.670> up<00:03:21.910> into<00:03:22.180> those<00:03:22.330> bottom<00:03:22.750> ripples

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
it forward up into those bottom ripples

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.440 
it forward up into those bottom ripples
and<00:03:23.709> as<00:03:23.890> I<00:03:24.100> do<00:03:24.160> the<00:03:24.459> lighter<00:03:24.670> materials<00:03:25.270> will

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
and as I do the lighter materials will

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:28.350 
and as I do the lighter materials will
fluff<00:03:25.780> across<00:03:26.140> the<00:03:26.410> top<00:03:26.970> towards<00:03:27.970> the<00:03:28.090> front

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:28.360 
fluff across the top towards the front

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:33.300 
fluff across the top towards the front
of<00:03:28.390> the<00:03:28.510> pan<00:03:29.100> then<00:03:30.100> I'll<00:03:30.280> wash<00:03:30.550> that<00:03:30.880> off<00:03:32.310> with

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
of the pan then I'll wash that off with

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.430 
of the pan then I'll wash that off with
a<00:03:33.340> little<00:03:34.000> bit<00:03:34.209> of<00:03:34.300> a<00:03:34.390> motion<00:03:34.810> here<00:03:34.989> just<00:03:35.230> wash

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440 
a little bit of a motion here just wash

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.199 
a little bit of a motion here just wash
some<00:03:35.709> of<00:03:35.830> those<00:03:35.890> light<00:03:36.130> fans<00:03:36.459> as<00:03:36.700> you<00:03:36.730> can<00:03:36.970> see

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:37.209 
some of those light fans as you can see

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:39.780 
some of those light fans as you can see
now<00:03:37.420> we're<00:03:38.080> getting<00:03:38.380> a<00:03:38.440> lot<00:03:38.650> more<00:03:38.680> black<00:03:39.160> sands

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
now we're getting a lot more black sands

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.180 
now we're getting a lot more black sands
and<00:03:40.510> we're<00:03:40.720> probably<00:03:41.110> down<00:03:41.260> to<00:03:41.290> very<00:03:41.770> little

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190 
and we're probably down to very little

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:48.670 
and we're probably down to very little
bit<00:03:42.400> of<00:03:42.550> material<00:03:43.060> it's<00:03:43.959> very<00:03:44.260> flat<00:03:44.820> then

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:51.770 

bringing<00:03:49.680> these<00:03:49.770> lighter<00:03:50.010> materials<00:03:50.610> now<00:03:51.600> as

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
bringing these lighter materials now as

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.240 
bringing these lighter materials now as
you<00:03:51.900> can<00:03:52.020> see<00:03:52.080> I'm<00:03:52.350> not<00:03:52.530> even<00:03:52.800> going<00:03:52.950> to<00:03:52.980> pan

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
you can see I'm not even going to pan

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.370 
you can see I'm not even going to pan
this<00:03:53.490> part<00:03:53.819> in<00:03:53.970> the<00:03:54.060> water<00:03:54.300> because<00:03:55.050> I<00:03:55.319> know

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
this part in the water because I know

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.020 
this part in the water because I know
those<00:03:55.620> are<00:03:55.830> my<00:03:55.860> heavies<00:03:56.310> and<00:03:56.340> the<00:03:56.640> forward

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
those are my heavies and the forward

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.390 
those are my heavies and the forward
stuff<00:03:57.330> should<00:03:57.569> be<00:03:57.600> my<00:03:57.870> light<00:03:58.080> stuff<00:03:58.410> as<00:03:59.250> you

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
stuff should be my light stuff as you

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:00.949 
stuff should be my light stuff as you
can<00:03:59.580> see<00:03:59.730> we've<00:03:59.910> got<00:04:00.060> a<00:04:00.120> pretty<00:04:00.450> decent<00:04:00.870> amount

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
can see we've got a pretty decent amount

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:03.920 
can see we've got a pretty decent amount
of<00:04:01.200> blacks<00:04:01.470> and<00:04:01.800> there<00:04:02.270> yeah<00:04:03.270> just<00:04:03.690> a<00:04:03.780> couple

buckets yeah looks like we got two

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.870 
buckets yeah looks like we got two
Pickers<00:04:09.740> that's<00:04:10.740> just<00:04:11.250> what<00:04:11.459> we're<00:04:11.610> looking

and there's flake also showing up all
the<00:04:15.000> way<00:04:15.120> big<00:04:15.690> large<00:04:15.930> heavies

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:16.829 
the way big large heavies

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:19.190 
the way big large heavies
now<00:04:17.790> those<00:04:17.970> heavies<00:04:18.329> will<00:04:18.359> be<00:04:18.600> magnetite

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:19.200 
now those heavies will be magnetite

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.270 
now those heavies will be magnetite
hematite<00:04:19.859> yeah<00:04:20.609> your<00:04:20.940> magnetites<00:04:21.570> hematite
