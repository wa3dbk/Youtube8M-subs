strength his lack of lateral foot speed
the<00:04:27.050> fact<00:04:27.290> he's<00:04:27.500> turnover<00:04:28.100> prone<00:04:28.370> this<00:04:28.910> past

very inconsistent from long distance and

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:36.190 
very inconsistent from long distance and
so<00:04:34.160> there<00:04:34.370> is<00:04:34.490> the<00:04:34.640> upside<00:04:35.030> the<00:04:35.360> sense<00:04:35.690> the

about and yet there is which is

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:03.250 
about and yet there is which is
surprising<00:05:01.550> so<00:05:01.760> high<00:05:02.000> in<00:05:02.300> the<00:05:02.390> draft<00:05:02.690> usually

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:03.260 
surprising so high in the draft usually

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.529 
surprising so high in the draft usually
when<00:05:03.830> we<00:05:03.919> talk<00:05:03.950> up<00:05:04.340> sides<00:05:04.610> about<00:05:04.849> big<00:05:05.120> men<00:05:05.330> that

because<00:05:09.780> the<00:05:09.930> upside<00:05:10.259> of<00:05:10.289> the<00:05:10.440> fact

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:10.680 
because the upside of the fact

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.529 
because the upside of the fact
seven-footers<00:05:11.580> are<00:05:11.729> rare<00:05:11.910> that<00:05:12.120> can<00:05:12.240> play<00:05:12.389> the

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:17.370 
the problem with that is when you're

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:19.070 
the problem with that is when you're

for him to come over and play in the NBA

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:31.730 
for him to come over and play in the NBA
now<00:06:30.719> it's<00:06:30.840> a<00:06:30.900> good<00:06:30.990> thing<00:06:31.169> as<00:06:31.229> a<00:06:31.289> bad<00:06:31.440> thing<00:06:31.500> on

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:31.740 
now it's a good thing as a bad thing on

now it's a good thing as a bad thing on
one<00:06:31.919> hand<00:06:32.159> it's<00:06:32.400> an<00:06:32.729> leverage<00:06:33.389> it's<00:06:33.719> an<00:06:33.780> asset

00:06:34.159 --> 00:06:34.169 
one hand it's an leverage it's an asset

00:06:34.169 --> 00:06:35.779 
one hand it's an leverage it's an asset
because<00:06:34.289> he<00:06:34.620> can<00:06:34.770> always<00:06:34.889> go<00:06:35.099> back<00:06:35.130> and<00:06:35.520> play

00:06:35.779 --> 00:06:35.789 
because he can always go back and play

00:06:35.789 --> 00:06:37.490 
because he can always go back and play
in<00:06:36.150> Europe<00:06:36.419> if<00:06:36.719> he<00:06:36.810> doesn't<00:06:37.110> like<00:06:37.229> where<00:06:37.409> he's

in Europe if he doesn't like where he's
drafted<00:06:37.710> that's<00:06:38.039> probably<00:06:38.340> going<00:06:38.460> to<00:06:38.520> keep

00:06:38.689 --> 00:06:38.699 
drafted that's probably going to keep

00:06:38.699 --> 00:06:40.399 
drafted that's probably going to keep
the<00:06:39.030> Memphis<00:06:39.360> Grizzlies<00:06:39.569> from<00:06:39.870> drafting<00:06:40.289> them

00:06:40.399 --> 00:06:40.409 
the Memphis Grizzlies from drafting them

00:06:40.409 --> 00:06:41.839 
the Memphis Grizzlies from drafting them
on<00:06:40.740> the<00:06:40.919> other<00:06:41.009> hand<00:06:41.280> it<00:06:41.400> is<00:06:41.520> going<00:06:41.669> to<00:06:41.759> be

00:06:41.839 --> 00:06:41.849 
on the other hand it is going to be

00:06:41.849 --> 00:06:44.089 
on the other hand it is going to be
expensive<00:06:42.240> for<00:06:42.449> him<00:06:42.630> the<00:06:43.229> NBA<00:06:43.530> teams<00:06:43.770> can<00:06:43.979> only

00:06:44.089 --> 00:06:44.099 
expensive for him the NBA teams can only

00:06:44.099 --> 00:06:46.939 
expensive for him the NBA teams can only
contribute<00:06:44.960> $500,000<00:06:45.960> toward<00:06:46.469> that<00:06:46.650> buyout

00:06:46.939 --> 00:06:46.949 
contribute $500,000 toward that buyout

00:06:46.949 --> 00:06:48.649 
contribute $500,000 toward that buyout
so<00:06:47.370> it<00:06:47.460> also<00:06:47.580> makes<00:06:47.880> you<00:06:47.969> think<00:06:48.210> if<00:06:48.360> you<00:06:48.569> were

00:06:48.649 --> 00:06:48.659 
so it also makes you think if you were

00:06:48.659 --> 00:06:50.089 
so it also makes you think if you were
to<00:06:48.690> slide<00:06:49.080> down<00:06:49.349> the<00:06:49.380> draft<00:06:49.680> board<00:06:49.889> a<00:06:49.979> little

00:06:50.089 --> 00:06:50.099 
to slide down the draft board a little

00:06:50.099 --> 00:06:51.980 
to slide down the draft board a little
bit<00:06:50.219> would<00:06:50.789> it<00:06:50.880> be<00:06:51.030> financially<00:06:51.599> worthwhile

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:51.990 
bit would it be financially worthwhile

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:53.689 
bit would it be financially worthwhile
for<00:06:52.169> him<00:06:52.380> to<00:06:52.469> come<00:06:52.620> over<00:06:52.650> because<00:06:53.009> with<00:06:53.580> the

00:06:53.689 --> 00:06:53.699 
for him to come over because with the

00:06:53.699 --> 00:06:55.850 
for him to come over because with the
NBA<00:06:53.819> Rookie<00:06:54.150> salary<00:06:54.690> scale<00:06:54.900> the<00:06:55.440> lower<00:06:55.650> you're

00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:55.860 
NBA Rookie salary scale the lower you're

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:57.529 
NBA Rookie salary scale the lower you're
drafted<00:06:56.310> the<00:06:56.520> lower<00:06:56.699> your<00:06:56.880> first<00:06:57.090> year<00:06:57.300> salary

00:06:57.529 --> 00:06:57.539 
drafted the lower your first year salary

00:06:57.539 --> 00:06:59.360 
drafted the lower your first year salary
as<00:06:57.810> well<00:06:57.840> so<00:06:58.289> something<00:06:58.800> to<00:06:58.860> think<00:06:58.979> about<00:06:59.069> for

00:06:59.360 --> 00:06:59.370 
as well so something to think about for

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:00.890 
as well so something to think about for
him<00:06:59.490> from<00:06:59.639> a<00:06:59.729> dollars<00:07:00.030> and<00:07:00.150> cents<00:07:00.360> perspective

00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:00.900 
him from a dollars and cents perspective

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:02.749 
him from a dollars and cents perspective
that<00:07:01.020> potential<00:07:01.530> soap-opera<00:07:02.159> for<00:07:02.400> somebody

00:07:02.749 --> 00:07:02.759 
that potential soap-opera for somebody

00:07:02.759 --> 00:07:05.270 
that potential soap-opera for somebody
out<00:07:02.819> there
