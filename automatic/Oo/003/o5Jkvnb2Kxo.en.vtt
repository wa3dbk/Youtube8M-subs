00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
much one of them so I've tried my best

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.259 
much one of them so I've tried my best
the<00:00:58.949> reason<00:00:59.250> he<00:00:59.309> was<00:00:59.429> laid<00:00:59.640> before<00:00:59.789> is<00:01:00.239> because

00:01:00.259 --> 00:01:00.269 
the reason he was laid before is because

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:03.560 
the reason he was laid before is because
he<00:01:01.260> ended<00:01:01.739> up<00:01:01.859> turning<00:01:02.160> into<00:01:02.460> endings<00:01:03.300> are

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
he ended up turning into endings are

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.590 
he ended up turning into endings are
done<00:01:04.070> so<00:01:05.070> there<00:01:05.309> you<00:01:05.430> can<00:01:05.610> see<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.880> profile

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
much I can do about it at the moment he

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.719 
much I can do about it at the moment he
has<00:01:31.140> got<00:01:31.380> quite<00:01:31.530> a<00:01:31.619> dense<00:01:31.950> beard<00:01:32.340> and<00:01:32.640> as

has got quite a dense beard and as
you'll<00:01:33.000> know<00:01:33.409> the<00:01:34.409> only<00:01:34.649> way<00:01:34.979> we<00:01:35.189> can<00:01:35.340> change

00:01:35.389 --> 00:01:35.399 
you'll know the only way we can change

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:38.120 
you'll know the only way we can change
the<00:01:35.729> density<00:01:35.939> of<00:01:36.270> his<00:01:36.750> facial<00:01:37.289> hair<00:01:37.320> is<00:01:37.829> by

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
the density of his facial hair is by

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.309 
the density of his facial hair is by
just<00:01:38.399> changing<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.939> color<00:01:39.210> but<00:01:40.049> well<00:01:40.289> I

00:01:40.309 --> 00:01:40.319 
just changing the color but well I

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:43.459 
just changing the color but well I
having<00:01:40.710> with<00:01:41.219> dark<00:01:41.520> hair<00:01:41.640> like<00:01:42.060> that<00:01:42.289> it<00:01:43.289> makes

00:01:43.459 --> 00:01:43.469 
having with dark hair like that it makes

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:45.380 
having with dark hair like that it makes
his<00:01:43.679> eyebrows<00:01:44.130> do<00:01:44.340> really<00:01:44.700> ducked<00:01:44.939> as<00:01:45.090> well<00:01:45.270> if

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
his eyebrows do really ducked as well if

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.859 
his eyebrows do really ducked as well if
I<00:01:45.539> think<00:01:45.869> maybe<00:01:46.709> the<00:01:47.100> dark<00:01:47.369> hair<00:01:47.700> looks<00:01:48.659> a

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
I think maybe the dark hair looks a

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.620 
I think maybe the dark hair looks a
little<00:01:48.929> bit<00:01:49.709> a<00:01:50.069> little<00:01:50.219> bit<00:01:50.700> more<00:01:51.060> like<00:01:51.329> him

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
little bit a little bit more like him

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.730 
little bit a little bit more like him
and<00:01:53.329> yeah<00:01:54.329> also<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:54.899> dark<00:01:55.170> hair<00:01:55.439> probably

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
and yeah also the dark hair probably

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.889 
and yeah also the dark hair probably
does<00:01:56.039> look<00:01:56.069> a<00:01:56.369> little<00:01:56.520> bit<00:01:56.789> more<00:01:56.969> like<00:01:57.209> him<00:01:57.390> so

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
does look a little bit more like him so

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.589
