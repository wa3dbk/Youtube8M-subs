carve into the ball write down the lines
and<00:01:50.150> you'll<00:01:50.240> want<00:01:50.420> to<00:01:50.510> do<00:01:50.630> that<00:01:50.840> so<00:01:51.770> it's

two<00:03:57.590> or<00:03:57.739> three<00:03:57.950> times<00:03:58.220> and<00:03:58.550> what<00:03:59.209> this<00:03:59.390> is

00:03:59.590 --> 00:03:59.600 
two or three times and what this is

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.000 
two or three times and what this is
going<00:03:59.720> to<00:03:59.780> do<00:03:59.959> is<00:04:00.110> give<00:04:00.290> you<00:04:00.410> a<00:04:00.440> little<00:04:00.530> bit<00:04:00.890> of

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.010 
going to do is give you a little bit of

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:04.660 
going to do is give you a little bit of
leeway<00:04:01.220> so<00:04:01.670> that<00:04:02.390> when<00:04:02.510> you<00:04:02.660> tack<00:04:03.190> the<00:04:04.190> square

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:04.670 
leeway so that when you tack the square

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:07.900 
leeway so that when you tack the square
onto<00:04:05.450> the<00:04:05.570> ball<00:04:05.720> it<00:04:06.020> conforms<00:04:07.010> and<00:04:07.430> you'll<00:04:07.640> see

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:07.910 
onto the ball it conforms and you'll see

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:10.560 
onto the ball it conforms and you'll see
here<00:04:08.150> in<00:04:08.239> a<00:04:08.330> minute<00:04:08.510> so<00:04:09.050> I've<00:04:09.170> got<00:04:09.380> that<00:04:09.590> all

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:10.570 
here in a minute so I've got that all

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:12.699 
here in a minute so I've got that all
covered<00:04:11.570> up<00:04:11.690> and<00:04:11.840> you<00:04:11.959> can<00:04:12.110> see<00:04:12.290> I've<00:04:12.470> got<00:04:12.650> one

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:12.709 
covered up and you can see I've got one

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:14.380 
covered up and you can see I've got one
already<00:04:13.040> tacked<00:04:13.400> into<00:04:13.580> place<00:04:13.670> and<00:04:14.090> see<00:04:14.239> how

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:14.390 
already tacked into place and see how

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:17.050 
already tacked into place and see how
that<00:04:14.570> fits<00:04:14.750> nicely<00:04:15.290> around<00:04:16.160> the<00:04:16.370> ball<00:04:16.549> the

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:17.060 
that fits nicely around the ball the

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:18.370 
that fits nicely around the ball the
next<00:04:17.359> thing<00:04:17.450> you're<00:04:17.570> going<00:04:17.720> to<00:04:17.810> do<00:04:17.959> is<00:04:18.080> cut

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:18.380 
next thing you're going to do is cut

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:21.789 
next thing you're going to do is cut
several<00:04:19.130> one<00:04:19.910> inch<00:04:20.150> by<00:04:20.630> four<00:04:20.959> inch<00:04:20.989> strips<00:04:21.530> and

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:21.799 
several one inch by four inch strips and

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:26.200 
several one inch by four inch strips and
then<00:04:22.610> start<00:04:23.540> by<00:04:24.140> folding<00:04:24.440> them<00:04:25.160> in<00:04:25.340> half<00:04:25.580> like

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:26.210 
then start by folding them in half like

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:28.600 
then start by folding them in half like
so<00:04:26.240> and<00:04:26.750> then<00:04:27.289> open<00:04:27.650> it<00:04:27.770> back<00:04:27.800> up<00:04:27.979> and<00:04:28.400> in<00:04:28.490> the

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:28.610 
so and then open it back up and in the

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:30.040 
so and then open it back up and in the
middle<00:04:28.910> you're<00:04:29.120> going<00:04:29.150> to<00:04:29.330> kind<00:04:29.539> of<00:04:29.630> fold<00:04:29.990> it

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050 
middle you're going to kind of fold it

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:31.290 
middle you're going to kind of fold it
like<00:04:30.200> you<00:04:30.320> would<00:04:30.410> a<00:04:30.470> paper<00:04:30.710> airplane

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300 
like you would a paper airplane

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:34.270 
like you would a paper airplane
the<00:04:32.300> two<00:04:32.510> sides<00:04:32.900> down<00:04:33.170> so<00:04:33.470> it<00:04:33.560> makes<00:04:33.740> an<00:04:33.860> even

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.280 
the two sides down so it makes an even

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:39.250 
the two sides down so it makes an even
point<00:04:36.340> then<00:04:37.340> you<00:04:37.520> can<00:04:37.700> begin<00:04:37.970> by<00:04:38.180> covering<00:04:38.630> the

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:39.260 
point then you can begin by covering the

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.470 
point then you can begin by covering the
square<00:04:39.650> and<00:04:39.860> you're<00:04:40.760> just<00:04:40.940> going<00:04:41.150> to<00:04:41.210> tack

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:41.480 
square and you're just going to tack

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:43.480 
square and you're just going to tack
this<00:04:41.720> in<00:04:41.960> place<00:04:42.230> make<00:04:42.620> sure<00:04:42.650> the<00:04:42.980> seam<00:04:43.250> is

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:43.490 
this in place make sure the seam is

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:46.630 
this in place make sure the seam is
facing<00:04:43.970> upward<00:04:45.100> and<00:04:46.100> you're<00:04:46.220> just<00:04:46.370> going<00:04:46.550> to

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:46.640 
facing upward and you're just going to

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:48.490 
facing upward and you're just going to
tack<00:04:46.850> this<00:04:47.120> around<00:04:47.420> with<00:04:47.600> straight<00:04:48.260> pins

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:48.500 
tack this around with straight pins

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:55.690 
tack this around with straight pins
around<00:04:49.490> on<00:04:50.090> either<00:04:50.420> side<00:04:51.050> and<00:04:52.780> then<00:04:54.520> do<00:04:55.520> the

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:55.700 
around on either side and then do the

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:57.460 
around on either side and then do the
other<00:04:55.730> side<00:04:55.940> and<00:04:56.270> I've<00:04:56.330> got<00:04:56.510> one<00:04:56.690> started<00:04:57.200> here

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:57.470 
other side and I've got one started here

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:59.560 
other side and I've got one started here
and<00:04:57.680> you<00:04:58.310> can<00:04:58.430> see<00:04:58.610> all<00:04:58.760> the<00:04:58.880> points<00:04:59.270> with<00:04:59.450> the

00:04:59.560 --> 00:04:59.570 
and you can see all the points with the

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:01.660 
and you can see all the points with the
seams<00:04:59.810> facing<00:05:00.380> out<00:05:00.560> and<00:05:00.770> then<00:05:01.280> just<00:05:01.490> continue

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:01.670 
seams facing out and then just continue

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:04.720 
seams facing out and then just continue
around<00:05:02.330> the<00:05:02.860> diameter<00:05:03.860> of<00:05:03.890> the<00:05:04.070> ball<00:05:04.250> covering

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:04.730 
around the diameter of the ball covering

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:07.360 
around the diameter of the ball covering
it<00:05:04.880> and<00:05:05.600> you'll<00:05:05.930> keep<00:05:06.200> going<00:05:06.650> and<00:05:06.860> going<00:05:07.130> and

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:07.370 
it and you'll keep going and going and

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:09.730 
it and you'll keep going and going and
going<00:05:07.490> until<00:05:07.910> you<00:05:08.300> have<00:05:08.540> covered<00:05:08.840> your<00:05:09.320> entire
