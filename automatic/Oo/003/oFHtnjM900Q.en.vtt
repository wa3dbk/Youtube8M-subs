onto<00:01:05.040> what's<00:01:05.220> called<00:01:05.460> a<00:01:05.640> chassis<00:01:06.150> which<00:01:06.450> is

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
onto what's called a chassis which is

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.240 
onto what's called a chassis which is
basically<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:07.110> base<00:01:07.260> of<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.560> vehicle<00:01:07.950> so<00:01:08.159> the

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
basically the base of the vehicle so the

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.679 
basically the base of the vehicle so the
great<00:01:08.430> thing<00:01:08.610> about<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.880> motive<00:01:09.150> technology

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
great thing about the motive technology

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.690 
great thing about the motive technology
is<00:01:09.840> that<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.020> technology<00:01:10.439> makes<00:01:11.130> it<00:01:11.250> modular

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
is that the technology makes it modular

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.460 
is that the technology makes it modular
so<00:01:12.299> that<00:01:12.330> means<00:01:12.720> that<00:01:12.840> you<00:01:12.930> can<00:01:13.080> take<00:01:13.260> any

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
so that means that you can take any

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.670 
so that means that you can take any
battery<00:01:13.920> and<00:01:14.159> put<00:01:14.939> it<00:01:15.090> on<00:01:15.210> any<00:01:15.450> chassis<00:01:15.990> and<00:01:16.439> so

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
battery and put it on any chassis and so

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.109 
battery and put it on any chassis and so
that<00:01:16.799> means<00:01:16.979> you<00:01:17.100> can<00:01:17.250> use<00:01:17.280> it<00:01:17.520> for<00:01:17.640> a<00:01:17.700> garbage

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
that means you can use it for a garbage

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.820 
that means you can use it for a garbage
truck<00:01:18.150> you<00:01:18.689> can<00:01:18.840> use<00:01:18.990> it<00:01:19.170> for<00:01:19.380> a<00:01:19.439> shuttle<00:01:19.799> bus

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
truck you can use it for a shuttle bus

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.249 
truck you can use it for a shuttle bus
for<00:01:20.400> a<00:01:20.430> school<00:01:20.880> bus<00:01:21.119> now<00:01:21.540> if<00:01:21.659> this<00:01:21.750> electric

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
for a school bus now if this electric

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.200 
for a school bus now if this electric
truck<00:01:22.500> here<00:01:22.740> it<00:01:22.830> turns<00:01:23.009> out<00:01:23.189> to<00:01:23.430> be<00:01:23.460> a<00:01:23.580> success

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210
