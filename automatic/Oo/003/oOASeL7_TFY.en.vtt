disengages<00:01:04.960> all<00:01:05.110> the<00:01:05.260> gears<00:01:05.590> and<00:01:05.860> it<00:01:05.979> allows

00:01:06.209 --> 00:01:06.219 
disengages all the gears and it allows

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:08.190 
disengages all the gears and it allows
the<00:01:06.490> reel<00:01:06.670> to<00:01:06.820> come<00:01:07.000> apart<00:01:07.299> just<00:01:07.570> very

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:08.200 
the reel to come apart just very

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:13.859 
the reel to come apart just very
smoothly<00:01:08.560> as<00:01:08.859> you<00:01:08.890> can<00:01:09.159> see<00:01:12.420> now<00:01:13.420> that<00:01:13.659> we<00:01:13.750> got

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:13.869 
smoothly as you can see now that we got

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:15.749 
smoothly as you can see now that we got
the<00:01:14.049> real<00:01:14.200> disassembled<00:01:15.039> it's<00:01:15.340> time<00:01:15.609> to

the real disassembled it's time to

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:20.010 
the real disassembled it's time to
change<00:01:15.969> the<00:01:16.210> bearings<00:01:18.359> I'll<00:01:19.359> be<00:01:19.689> replacing

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020 
change the bearings I'll be replacing

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.440 
change the bearings I'll be replacing
the<00:01:20.380> brake<00:01:20.590> side<00:01:20.920> bearing<00:01:21.250> which<00:01:21.880> is<00:01:22.030> this<00:01:22.210> guy

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:22.450 
the brake side bearing which is this guy

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.560 
the brake side bearing which is this guy
right<00:01:22.840> here<00:01:22.869> and<00:01:23.520> it's<00:01:24.520> locked<00:01:24.820> in<00:01:25.119> by<00:01:25.539> a

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 
right here and it's locked in by a

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:27.660 
right here and it's locked in by a
little<00:01:25.990> a<00:01:26.109> retainer<00:01:26.500> clip<00:01:26.829> and<00:01:27.070> we<00:01:27.429> have<00:01:27.549> to

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670 
little a retainer clip and we have to

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:29.459 
little a retainer clip and we have to
remove<00:01:27.909> from<00:01:28.149> the<00:01:28.270> reel<00:01:28.479> and<00:01:28.719> that's<00:01:29.109> very

00:01:29.459 --> 00:01:29.469 
remove from the reel and that's very

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:32.039 
remove from the reel and that's very
difficult<00:01:30.009> to<00:01:30.100> get<00:01:30.250> out<00:01:30.310> and<00:01:30.789> so<00:01:31.689> if<00:01:31.780> you<00:01:31.869> don't

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:32.049 
difficult to get out and so if you don't

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:35.219 
difficult to get out and so if you don't
have<00:01:32.289> a<00:01:33.210> needlenose<00:01:34.210> pair<00:01:34.509> of<00:01:34.600> pliers<00:01:34.810> to<00:01:34.899> grab

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:35.229 
have a needlenose pair of pliers to grab

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:36.630 
have a needlenose pair of pliers to grab
it<00:01:35.380> as<00:01:35.499> you<00:01:35.619> remove<00:01:35.799> from<00:01:35.859> the<00:01:36.100> reel<00:01:36.280> it<00:01:36.490> will

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 
it as you remove from the reel it will

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.279 
it as you remove from the reel it will
eject<00:01:36.969> out<00:01:37.179> in<00:01:37.359> the<00:01:37.450> middle<00:01:37.659> of<00:01:37.749> nowhere<00:01:37.929> and

00:01:38.279 --> 00:01:38.289 
eject out in the middle of nowhere and

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:41.700 
eject out in the middle of nowhere and
you<00:01:38.380> could<00:01:38.530> possibly<00:01:38.679> lose<00:01:39.130> it<00:01:39.340> and<00:01:40.649> now<00:01:41.649> we

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 
you could possibly lose it and now we

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:43.980 
you could possibly lose it and now we
take<00:01:42.070> out<00:01:42.249> the<00:01:42.399> brake<00:01:42.609> side<00:01:42.850> bearing<00:01:43.210> using

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
take out the brake side bearing using

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.319 
take out the brake side bearing using
the<00:01:44.109> needlenose<00:01:44.409> pliers<00:01:44.920> now<00:01:45.310> I<00:01:45.670> install<00:01:46.149> the

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:46.329 
the needlenose pliers now I install the

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:48.749 
the needlenose pliers now I install the
new<00:01:46.509> orange<00:01:47.079> seal<00:01:47.350> ceramic<00:01:47.890> bearing<00:01:48.219> in<00:01:48.340> the

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 
brake side of the reel and now I'm going

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.929 
brake side of the reel and now I'm going
to<00:01:52.119> reinsert<00:01:52.600> the<00:01:52.749> clip<00:01:53.520> which<00:01:54.520> is<00:01:54.549> the<00:01:54.789> most

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:54.939 
to reinsert the clip which is the most

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:59.959 
to reinsert the clip which is the most
difficult<00:01:55.119> part
