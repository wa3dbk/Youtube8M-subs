Andre<00:00:00.299> obviously<00:00:00.570> a<00:00:00.599> difficult<00:00:00.989> day<00:00:01.140> what<00:00:01.469> do

00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:01.530 
Andre obviously a difficult day what do

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:04.039 
Andre obviously a difficult day what do
you<00:00:01.620> make<00:00:01.770> of<00:00:01.829> what<00:00:02.070> you've<00:00:02.190> seen<00:00:03.049> well

00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:04.049 
you make of what you've seen well

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.820 
you make of what you've seen well
difficult<00:00:04.500> to<00:00:05.210> start<00:00:06.210> obviously<00:00:06.830> considering

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
difficult to start obviously considering

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.600 
difficult to start obviously considering
a<00:00:07.950> role<00:00:08.069> in<00:00:08.189> 15<00:00:08.519> seconds<00:00:08.970> put<00:00:09.870> some<00:00:10.610> your

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
a role in 15 seconds put some your

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.370 
a role in 15 seconds put some your
planning<00:00:12.120> in<00:00:12.480> doubt<00:00:12.750> and<00:00:12.960> everything<00:00:13.259> that

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
planning in doubt and everything that

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.250 
planning in doubt and everything that
you<00:00:13.469> had<00:00:13.559> parent<00:00:14.130> so<00:00:14.660> it's<00:00:15.660> difficult<00:00:15.839> to<00:00:16.109> take

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
you had parent so it's difficult to take

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:17.870 
you had parent so it's difficult to take
I<00:00:16.410> think<00:00:16.440> we<00:00:16.680> had<00:00:16.770> a<00:00:16.800> very<00:00:17.130> very<00:00:17.160> good<00:00:17.310> reaction

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
I think we had a very very good reaction

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.349 
I think we had a very very good reaction
to<00:00:18.109> the<00:00:19.109> gold<00:00:19.320> suffered<00:00:20.060> you<00:00:21.060> know<00:00:21.150> that's

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
to the gold suffered you know that's

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.029 
to the gold suffered you know that's
probably<00:00:21.510> the<00:00:21.810> only<00:00:21.960> positive<00:00:22.470> all<00:00:22.800> the<00:00:22.920> game

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
probably the only positive all the game

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.580 
probably the only positive all the game
we<00:00:23.220> have<00:00:23.400> is<00:00:23.550> from<00:00:24.420> the<00:00:25.140> moment<00:00:25.470> that<00:00:25.500> we

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
we have is from the moment that we

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.019 
we have is from the moment that we
suffered<00:00:26.070> those<00:00:27.029> first<00:00:28.310> 20<00:00:29.310> minutes<00:00:29.429> before

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
suffered those first 20 minutes before

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.650 
suffered those first 20 minutes before
they<00:00:30.210> scored<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:31.260> second<00:00:31.650> goal<00:00:32.239> so<00:00:33.239> it's<00:00:33.480> not

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
they scored the second goal so it's not

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.290 
they scored the second goal so it's not
this<00:00:33.960> it's<00:00:34.739> not<00:00:34.890> a<00:00:34.920> lot<00:00:35.100> to<00:00:35.280> to<00:00:35.880> look<00:00:36.030> for

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
this it's not a lot to to look for

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.709 
this it's not a lot to to look for
everything<00:00:37.020> went<00:00:37.350> went<00:00:37.739> bad<00:00:37.920> for<00:00:38.100> us<00:00:38.600> you<00:00:39.600> know

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
everything went went bad for us you know

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.799 
everything went went bad for us you know
for<00:00:40.520> from<00:00:41.520> being<00:00:41.760> one<00:00:41.910> of<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.059> best<00:00:42.239> defenses

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
for from being one of the best defenses

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.630 
for from being one of the best defenses
in<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:42.960> country<00:00:43.050> into<00:00:43.590> suffering<00:00:44.460> six<00:00:44.879> goals

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:46.640 
in the country into suffering six goals

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.819 
in the country into suffering six goals
so<00:00:47.640> you<00:00:48.539> know<00:00:48.660> there's<00:00:48.899> not<00:00:48.989> a<00:00:49.079> lot<00:00:49.230> of<00:00:49.260> good<00:00:49.469> we

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
so you know there's not a lot of good we

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.500 
so you know there's not a lot of good we
could<00:00:49.980> say<00:00:50.160> we<00:00:50.670> could<00:00:50.789> say<00:00:50.940> that<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.270> city

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
could say we could say that the city

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.680 
could say we could say that the city
were<00:00:51.719> an<00:00:51.930> excellent<00:00:52.230> we<00:00:52.559> were<00:00:53.149> extremely<00:00:54.149> poor

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
were an excellent we were extremely poor

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.119 
were an excellent we were extremely poor
today<00:00:55.050> and<00:00:55.500> we<00:00:56.399> pay<00:00:56.579> them<00:00:56.690> every<00:00:57.690> press<00:00:58.129> having

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
today and we pay them every press having

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.340 
today and we pay them every press having
been<00:00:59.280> so<00:00:59.550> solid<00:00:59.760> all<00:01:00.090> season<00:01:00.660> why<00:01:00.899> wasn't<00:01:01.320> that

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
been so solid all season why wasn't that

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.709 
been so solid all season why wasn't that
the<00:01:01.530> case<00:01:01.710> today<00:01:01.920> what<00:01:02.190> was<00:01:02.309> different<00:01:02.910> well<00:01:03.690> I

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
the case today what was different well I

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.660 
the case today what was different well I
think<00:01:03.840> you<00:01:04.500> have<00:01:04.589> to<00:01:04.739> give<00:01:05.129> credit<00:01:05.159> to<00:01:05.489> the

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
think you have to give credit to the

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.450 
think you have to give credit to the
opponent<00:01:06.060> after<00:01:06.619> whatever<00:01:07.619> I<00:01:07.860> would<00:01:08.040> say<00:01:08.220> that

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
opponent after whatever I would say that

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.170 
opponent after whatever I would say that
we<00:01:09.420> had<00:01:09.570> a<00:01:09.659> small<00:01:10.140> reaction<00:01:10.920> when<00:01:11.729> we<00:01:11.820> came<00:01:12.030> up

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
we had a small reaction when we came up

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.330 
we had a small reaction when we came up
from<00:01:12.360> halftime<00:01:12.869> that<00:01:14.570> you<00:01:15.570> know<00:01:16.100> if<00:01:17.100> we

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
from halftime that you know if we

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.460 
from halftime that you know if we
managed<00:01:17.580> to<00:01:17.640> score<00:01:17.850> one<00:01:18.210> you<00:01:18.390> get<00:01:19.049> back<00:01:19.290> into

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
managed to score one you get back into

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.370 
managed to score one you get back into
the<00:01:19.650> game<00:01:19.880> but<00:01:20.880> I<00:01:20.939> think<00:01:21.000> from<00:01:21.479> from<00:01:21.900> the

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
the game but I think from from the

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.920 
the game but I think from from the
moment<00:01:22.619> that<00:01:22.650> we<00:01:22.799> suffer<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.130> Fornell<00:01:23.610> we

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:23.930 
moment that we suffer the Fornell we

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.570 
moment that we suffer the Fornell we
mentally<00:01:24.930> weren't<00:01:25.259> weren't<00:01:26.250> playing<00:01:26.460> the

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
mentally weren't weren't playing the

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.609 
mentally weren't weren't playing the
game<00:01:27.650> so<00:01:28.650> upset<00:01:29.930> it's<00:01:30.930> difficult<00:01:31.350> difficult

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
game so upset it's difficult difficult

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.450 
game so upset it's difficult difficult
conditions<00:01:32.220> for<00:01:32.420> for<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:33.659> players<00:01:33.930> for<00:01:34.460> for

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
conditions for for the players for for

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.499 
conditions for for the players for for
everybody<00:01:36.290> you<00:01:37.290> know<00:01:37.409> we<00:01:37.759> we<00:01:38.759> had<00:01:38.880> high
