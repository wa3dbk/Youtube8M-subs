Roger perhaps slightly tongue-in-cheek
our<00:00:03.120> commentator<00:00:03.600> said<00:00:03.840> that<00:00:04.080> you're<00:00:04.290> just

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:04.500 
our commentator said that you're just

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:05.990 
our commentator said that you're just
simply<00:00:04.620> better<00:00:04.920> at<00:00:05.100> playing<00:00:05.310> the<00:00:05.460> game<00:00:05.700> but

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
simply better at playing the game but

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.360 
simply better at playing the game but
how<00:00:06.390> do<00:00:06.450> you<00:00:06.569> explain<00:00:06.899> your<00:00:07.740> absolute

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
how do you explain your absolute

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.180 
how do you explain your absolute
dominance<00:00:08.700> over<00:00:09.030> for<00:00:09.450> our<00:00:09.570> over<00:00:09.990> these<00:00:10.110> years

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:10.190 
dominance over for our over these years

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:12.709 
dominance over for our over these years
well<00:00:11.190> I<00:00:11.219> mean<00:00:11.370> I<00:00:11.490> guess<00:00:11.670> I've<00:00:11.910> taken<00:00:12.179> advantage

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
well I mean I guess I've taken advantage

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.990 
well I mean I guess I've taken advantage
of<00:00:13.019> the<00:00:13.469> fact<00:00:13.679> that<00:00:13.860> I<00:00:14.219> was<00:00:14.400> well<00:00:14.610> number<00:00:14.849> one

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
of the fact that I was well number one

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.150 
of the fact that I was well number one
in<00:00:15.120> the<00:00:15.240> first<00:00:15.420> five<00:00:16.230> that<00:00:16.590> we<00:00:16.680> played<00:00:16.890> against

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
in the first five that we played against

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.590 
in the first five that we played against
each<00:00:17.310> other<00:00:17.550> and<00:00:17.609> he<00:00:17.730> was<00:00:17.850> only<00:00:18.060> up<00:00:18.150> and<00:00:18.270> coming

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
each other and he was only up and coming

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.410 
each other and he was only up and coming
back<00:00:18.779> then<00:00:19.020> so<00:00:19.800> I<00:00:19.830> mean<00:00:20.220> those<00:00:20.789> match<00:00:21.060> that<00:00:21.330> was

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
back then so I mean those match that was

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.210 
back then so I mean those match that was
really<00:00:21.750> supposed<00:00:22.500> to<00:00:22.650> win<00:00:22.890> and<00:00:23.130> then

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
really supposed to win and then

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.700 
really supposed to win and then
obviously<00:00:23.340> the<00:00:23.699> last<00:00:23.880> sort<00:00:24.210> of<00:00:24.269> five<00:00:24.960> to<00:00:25.199> ten<00:00:25.439> I

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
obviously the last sort of five to ten I

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.320 
obviously the last sort of five to ten I
think<00:00:26.220> we've<00:00:26.340> had<00:00:26.430> some<00:00:26.609> good<00:00:26.730> matches<00:00:26.910> many

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
think we've had some good matches many

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:28.550 
think we've had some good matches many
of<00:00:27.449> them<00:00:27.539> have<00:00:27.660> been<00:00:27.750> in<00:00:27.900> the<00:00:28.050> wars<00:00:28.199> only<00:00:28.500> if

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
of them have been in the wars only if

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.230 
of them have been in the wars only if
you<00:00:28.710> have<00:00:28.800> been<00:00:28.949> on<00:00:29.039> clay<00:00:29.310> so<00:00:30.029> I<00:00:30.060> definitely

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
you have been on clay so I definitely

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.640 
you have been on clay so I definitely
think<00:00:30.539> also<00:00:30.779> that's<00:00:31.109> been<00:00:31.320> a<00:00:31.349> slight

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
think also that's been a slight

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.350 
think also that's been a slight
advantage<00:00:31.800> and<00:00:32.279> I<00:00:32.399> think<00:00:32.669> just<00:00:32.910> to<00:00:33.000> match<00:00:33.120> up

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
advantage and I think just to match up

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.209 
advantage and I think just to match up
for<00:00:34.079> me<00:00:34.200> as<00:00:34.320> a<00:00:34.350> good<00:00:34.559> one<00:00:34.739> maybe<00:00:34.920> against

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
for me as a good one maybe against

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.010 
for me as a good one maybe against
Ferrer<00:00:35.579> but<00:00:35.850> I<00:00:35.880> think<00:00:36.149> today<00:00:36.570> that's<00:00:36.899> as

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
Ferrer but I think today that's as

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.780 
Ferrer but I think today that's as
strong<00:00:37.170> as<00:00:37.380> I've<00:00:37.500> ever<00:00:37.590> seen<00:00:37.739> Ferrer<00:00:38.640> you

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
strong as I've ever seen Ferrer you

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.250 
strong as I've ever seen Ferrer you
could<00:00:38.940> tell<00:00:39.149> he<00:00:39.270> was<00:00:39.360> confident<00:00:39.840> coming<00:00:40.050> from

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
could tell he was confident coming from

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.380 
could tell he was confident coming from
the<00:00:40.559> winds<00:00:40.829> and<00:00:40.920> violence<00:00:41.190> in<00:00:41.370> Paris<00:00:41.790> and<00:00:41.969> I

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
the winds and violence in Paris and I

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.049 
the winds and violence in Paris and I
was<00:00:42.809> impressed<00:00:43.020> so<00:00:43.379> I'm<00:00:43.710> happy<00:00:44.219> I<00:00:44.250> I<00:00:44.550> got<00:00:44.940> out

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
was impressed so I'm happy I I got out

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.479 
was impressed so I'm happy I I got out
of<00:00:45.239> it<00:00:45.329> in<00:00:45.420> that<00:00:45.510> second<00:00:45.870> set<00:00:46.079> and<00:00:46.110> I<00:00:46.770> think

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
of it in that second set and I think

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:48.560 
of it in that second set and I think
it's<00:00:47.579> good<00:00:47.700> good<00:00:47.850> chances<00:00:48.149> to<00:00:48.270> make<00:00:48.390> it

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
it's good good chances to make it

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:49.819 
it's good good chances to make it
through<00:00:48.719> to<00:00:48.840> the<00:00:48.870> semi<00:00:49.140> is<00:00:49.289> because<00:00:49.530> he<00:00:49.620> seemed

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
through to the semi is because he seemed

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.610 
through to the semi is because he seemed
extremely<00:00:50.100> tough<00:00:50.460> and<00:00:50.719> confident<00:00:51.719> and<00:00:51.870> that<00:00:52.140> I

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
extremely tough and confident and that I

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.979 
extremely tough and confident and that I
think<00:00:53.039> he<00:00:53.460> gets<00:00:53.879> great<00:00:54.090> respect<00:00:54.510> from<00:00:54.660> the

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
think he gets great respect from the

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.979 
think he gets great respect from the
fellow<00:00:55.170> players<00:00:55.469> with<00:00:56.460> his<00:00:56.550> work<00:00:56.760> ethic<00:00:57.210> how

only<00:01:06.180> he<00:01:06.510> only<00:01:06.689> took<00:01:06.900> one<00:01:07.350> of<00:01:07.380> those<00:01:07.560> was<00:01:08.490> that

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
only he only took one of those was that

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.160 
only he only took one of those was that
something<00:01:08.760> that<00:01:08.850> you<00:01:09.479> know<00:01:09.570> frustrates<00:01:10.020> him

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
something that you know frustrates him

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.740 
something that you know frustrates him
more<00:01:10.409> than<00:01:10.530> gives<00:01:10.740> you<00:01:10.890> confidence<00:01:11.479> I'm<00:01:12.479> not

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
more than gives you confidence I'm not

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.570 
more than gives you confidence I'm not
sure<00:01:12.810> I<00:01:12.930> mean<00:01:13.110> a<00:01:13.200> maybe<00:01:13.530> works<00:01:13.770> both<00:01:13.979> ways<00:01:14.250> but

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
sure I mean a maybe works both ways but

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.100 
sure I mean a maybe works both ways but
I<00:01:14.700> mean<00:01:14.880> all<00:01:15.090> you<00:01:15.299> can<00:01:15.450> do<00:01:15.540> is<00:01:15.659> try<00:01:15.840> your<00:01:15.990> best

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
I mean all you can do is try your best

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.420 
I mean all you can do is try your best
and<00:01:16.380> I<00:01:16.500> don't<00:01:16.680> think<00:01:16.860> he<00:01:16.920> leaves<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.280> match

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
and I don't think he leaves the match

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.940 
and I don't think he leaves the match
with<00:01:17.670> regrets<00:01:18.060> and<00:01:18.330> so<00:01:18.540> do<00:01:19.170> i<00:01:19.229> i'm<00:01:19.350> very<00:01:19.770> happy

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
with regrets and so do i i'm very happy

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.800 
with regrets and so do i i'm very happy
i<00:01:20.130> mean<00:01:20.280> look<00:01:20.400> it's<00:01:20.520> a<00:01:20.880> great<00:01:21.119> achievement<00:01:21.270> to

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
i mean look it's a great achievement to

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.359 
i mean look it's a great achievement to
save<00:01:22.140> so<00:01:22.290> many<00:01:22.380> break<00:01:22.619> points<00:01:22.979> against<00:01:23.189> one<00:01:23.340> of

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
save so many break points against one of

the best return players in the game and

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.020 
the best return players in the game and
i<00:01:25.740> wish<00:01:25.890> i<00:01:26.040> could<00:01:26.189> have<00:01:26.250> served<00:01:26.520> a<00:01:26.640> little<00:01:26.759> bit
