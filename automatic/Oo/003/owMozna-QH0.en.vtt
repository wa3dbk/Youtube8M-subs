00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:54.169 
factor because he pursued mayweather in

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:56.080

such<00:04:54.380> a<00:04:54.410> way<00:04:54.650> and<00:04:54.919> thought<00:04:55.220> he<00:04:55.460> that<00:04:55.729> fight<00:04:55.940> was

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:56.090 
such a way and thought he that fight was

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:58.150 
such a way and thought he that fight was
a<00:04:56.150> lock<00:04:56.449> and<00:04:56.690> now<00:04:56.840> he's<00:04:57.110> not<00:04:57.530> gonna<00:04:57.919> see

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:58.160
