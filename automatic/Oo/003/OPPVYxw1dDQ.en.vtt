00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:06.410 
through her back three feet or through a
hind<00:07:04.500> quarter<00:07:04.860> and<00:07:05.460> you<00:07:06.000> can<00:07:06.150> tell<00:07:06.390> that

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:06.420 
hind quarter and you can tell that

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:11.600 
hind quarter and you can tell that
through<00:07:06.840> expression<00:07:07.650> anyway<00:07:10.310> so<00:07:11.310> that's<00:07:11.430> a

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:11.610 
through expression anyway so that's a

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:13.520 
through expression anyway so that's a
different<00:07:11.970> expression<00:07:12.540> all<00:07:12.810> together<00:07:12.990> even

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:13.530 
different expression all together even

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:15.680 
different expression all together even
though<00:07:13.980> she's<00:07:14.190> still<00:07:14.310> coming<00:07:14.610> at<00:07:14.910> me<00:07:15.090> she's

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:15.690 
though she's still coming at me she's

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:17.690 
though she's still coming at me she's
still<00:07:15.810> kind<00:07:16.080> of<00:07:16.170> dominating<00:07:16.800> me<00:07:16.950> in<00:07:17.070> some<00:07:17.340> form

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:17.700 
still kind of dominating me in some form

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:21.560 
still kind of dominating me in some form
but<00:07:18.600> he<00:07:19.290> is<00:07:19.530> a<00:07:19.560> not<00:07:20.100> sort<00:07:20.340> of<00:07:20.400> like<00:07:20.460> this<00:07:20.910> her

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:21.570 
but he is a not sort of like this her

00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:23.660 
but he is a not sort of like this her
heads<00:07:21.810> not<00:07:21.900> like<00:07:22.170> that<00:07:22.440> she's<00:07:23.250> starting<00:07:23.430> to

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:23.670 
heads not like that she's starting to

00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:26.150 
heads not like that she's starting to
get<00:07:23.880> lower<00:07:24.390> through<00:07:25.080> a<00:07:25.140> head<00:07:25.320> and<00:07:25.440> neck<00:07:25.680> an

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:26.160 
get lower through a head and neck an

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:28.430 
get lower through a head and neck an
expression<00:07:26.790> and<00:07:27.390> I<00:07:27.450> can<00:07:27.660> now<00:07:27.810> get<00:07:28.080> in<00:07:28.200> on<00:07:28.320> this

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:28.440 
expression and I can now get in on this

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:32.080 
expression and I can now get in on this
side<00:07:29.150> she's<00:07:30.150> now<00:07:30.330> let<00:07:30.540> me<00:07:30.690> in<00:07:30.900> here

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:32.090 
side she's now let me in here

00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:35.180 
side she's now let me in here
so<00:07:33.090> we're<00:07:33.240> starting<00:07:33.450> to<00:07:33.720> build<00:07:33.900> up<00:07:34.140> that<00:07:35.130> trust

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:35.190 
so we're starting to build up that trust

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:38.000 
so we're starting to build up that trust
and<00:07:35.730> communication<00:07:36.410> to<00:07:37.410> be<00:07:37.530> able<00:07:37.620> to<00:07:37.800> work

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:38.010 
and communication to be able to work

00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:39.800 
and communication to be able to work
with<00:07:38.190> the<00:07:38.280> horse<00:07:38.600> effectively<00:07:39.600> and

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:39.810 
with the horse effectively and

00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:43.010 
with the horse effectively and
efficiently<00:07:40.610> to<00:07:41.610> get<00:07:41.760> it<00:07:41.850> ready<00:07:42.090> to<00:07:42.390> be

00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:43.020 
efficiently to get it ready to be

00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:46.040 
efficiently to get it ready to be
handled<00:07:43.800> before<00:07:44.190> saddling<00:07:44.940> now<00:07:45.780> you've<00:07:45.960> been

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:46.050 
handled before saddling now you've been

00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:48.470 
handled before saddling now you've been
going<00:07:46.320> for<00:07:46.410> half<00:07:46.740> an<00:07:46.890> hour<00:07:47.070> or<00:07:47.340> so<00:07:47.550> that's

00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:48.480 
going for half an hour or so that's

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:49.910 
going for half an hour or so that's
exactly<00:07:48.930> where<00:07:49.080> I'd<00:07:49.170> leave<00:07:49.410> her<00:07:49.590> today

00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:49.920 
exactly where I'd leave her today

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:51.560 
exactly where I'd leave her today
because<00:07:50.220> I<00:07:50.280> want<00:07:50.460> to<00:07:50.520> build<00:07:50.730> on<00:07:50.880> it<00:07:51.060> I<00:07:51.210> don't

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:51.570 
because I want to build on it I don't

00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:53.490 
because I want to build on it I don't
want<00:07:51.720> to<00:07:51.780> take<00:07:51.930> it<00:07:52.080> out<00:07:52.230> of<00:07:52.350> her<00:07:52.470> now

00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:53.500 
want to take it out of her now

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:55.530 
want to take it out of her now
Oh
