00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
side you can see the difference that's

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.900

large<00:02:36.470> and<00:02:37.470> you<00:02:38.040> will<00:02:38.160> find<00:02:38.430> with<00:02:38.790> this

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
large and you will find with this

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.240 
large and you will find with this
particular<00:02:39.330> diaper<00:02:40.050> and<00:02:40.380> the<00:02:40.560> inserts<00:02:41.040> that

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
particular diaper and the inserts that

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.550 
particular diaper and the inserts that
you<00:02:41.760> will<00:02:42.090> get<00:02:42.270> with<00:02:42.510> them<00:02:42.690> that<00:02:43.230> they<00:02:43.380> are

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
you will get with them that they are

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.590 
you will get with them that they are
extremely<00:02:43.830> thin<00:02:44.400> so<00:02:45.030> what<00:02:45.300> you<00:02:45.420> might

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
extremely thin so what you might

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.199 
extremely thin so what you might
typically<00:02:46.050> have<00:02:46.380> on<00:02:46.620> a<00:02:46.650> larger<00:02:47.220> setting<00:02:47.610> with

typically have on a larger setting with

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:50.540 
typically have on a larger setting with
your<00:02:48.390> child<00:02:48.720> you<00:02:49.320> would<00:02:49.440> have<00:02:49.709> on<00:02:49.950> a<00:02:50.010> smaller

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:53.300 
your child you would have on a smaller
setting<00:02:51.000> most<00:02:51.300> likely<00:02:51.750> in<00:02:51.959> this<00:02:52.620> diaper<00:02:52.920> if

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
setting most likely in this diaper if

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:58.130 
setting most likely in this diaper if
you<00:02:54.300> notice<00:02:54.690> a<00:02:54.840> gap<00:02:55.489> along<00:02:56.489> the<00:02:56.790> thigh<00:02:57.510> of<00:02:57.870> your

you notice a gap along the thigh of your

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.500 
you notice a gap along the thigh of your
baby's<00:02:58.470> leg<00:02:59.060> underneath<00:03:00.060> you<00:03:00.360> would

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
baby's leg underneath you would

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:05.360 
baby's leg underneath you would
definitely<00:03:00.660> want<00:03:00.900> to<00:03:01.110> pull<00:03:01.350> it<00:03:01.470> up<00:03:02.780> and<00:03:04.370> that

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
definitely want to pull it up and that

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.310 
definitely want to pull it up and that
is<00:03:05.640> both<00:03:05.850> of<00:03:06.060> the<00:03:06.150> diapers<00:03:06.540> in<00:03:06.720> their<00:03:06.930> smallest

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
is both of the diapers in their smallest

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:11.360 
is both of the diapers in their smallest
settings<00:03:07.860> and<00:03:09.290> the<00:03:10.290> pattern<00:03:10.680> on<00:03:10.800> the<00:03:10.920> front<00:03:10.950> is

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
settings and the pattern on the front is

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.570 
settings and the pattern on the front is
pretty<00:03:11.970> similar<00:03:12.300> on<00:03:12.660> the<00:03:13.500> snaps<00:03:13.860> other<00:03:14.340> than

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
pretty similar on the snaps other than

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.770 
pretty similar on the snaps other than
just<00:03:15.000> the<00:03:15.239> hip<00:03:15.530> alongside<00:03:16.530> the<00:03:16.860> hips<00:03:17.330> so<00:03:18.330> if<00:03:18.660> we

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
just the hip alongside the hips so if we

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.550 
just the hip alongside the hips so if we
were<00:03:18.900> to<00:03:18.930> open<00:03:19.110> up<00:03:19.410> these<00:03:19.590> diapers<00:03:21.260> you<00:03:22.260> can

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
were to open up these diapers you can

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:27.860 
were to open up these diapers you can
see<00:03:22.890> on<00:03:23.130> the<00:03:23.430> front<00:03:23.820> panel<00:03:24.209> of<00:03:24.660> the<00:03:26.450> mom<00:03:27.450> label

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
see on the front panel of the mom label

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.430 
see on the front panel of the mom label
there<00:03:28.230> is<00:03:28.470> an<00:03:28.830> additional<00:03:29.989> panel<00:03:30.989> here<00:03:31.260> that

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
there is an additional panel here that

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.229 
there is an additional panel here that
I'll<00:03:31.560> avoid<00:03:31.830> leaking<00:03:32.400> especially<00:03:33.060> in<00:03:33.150> the

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
I'll avoid leaking especially in the

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:34.490 
I'll avoid leaking especially in the
babies<00:03:33.540> that<00:03:33.660> are<00:03:33.690> sleeping<00:03:34.080> on<00:03:34.170> their<00:03:34.320> tummy

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
babies that are sleeping on their tummy

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:42.110 
babies that are sleeping on their tummy
and<00:03:35.030> in<00:03:36.030> the<00:03:36.180> blue<00:03:36.330> label<00:03:40.070> there<00:03:41.070> is<00:03:41.370> no

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
and in the blue label there is no

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.900 
and in the blue label there is no
additional<00:03:42.570> panel<00:03:42.980> also<00:03:43.980> a<00:03:44.280> difference<00:03:44.700> in

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
additional panel also a difference in

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:50.030 
additional panel also a difference in
the<00:03:45.060> mom<00:03:45.239> label<00:03:45.600> is<00:03:45.750> that<00:03:46.049> the<00:03:47.900> pocket<00:03:48.900> is<00:03:49.170> a

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
the mom label is that the pocket is a

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.860 
the mom label is that the pocket is a
little<00:03:50.370> bit<00:03:50.489> wider<00:03:50.820> and<00:03:51.180> it<00:03:51.750> also<00:03:51.989> has<00:03:52.230> a<00:03:52.920> flap

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.870 
little bit wider and it also has a flap

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:56.750 
little bit wider and it also has a flap
so<00:03:54.870> it's<00:03:55.079> easy<00:03:55.320> to<00:03:55.440> stuff<00:03:55.829> and<00:03:56.130> remove<00:03:56.370> inserts

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
so it's easy to stuff and remove inserts

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.140 
so it's easy to stuff and remove inserts
especially<00:03:57.720> if<00:03:57.900> you<00:03:58.170> have<00:03:58.200> a<00:03:58.739> daddy<00:03:59.340> with<00:04:00.120> a

and one other thing about these and it's

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.660 
and one other thing about these and it's
hard<00:04:24.630> to<00:04:24.750> tell<00:04:24.990> in<00:04:25.200> a<00:04:25.290> video<00:04:25.590> but<00:04:25.860> if<00:04:26.100> you<00:04:26.460> can

and has a higher fiber density and that

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:36.680 
and has a higher fiber density and that
it's<00:04:34.050> heavier<00:04:34.590> and<00:04:34.830> you<00:04:35.310> can<00:04:35.580> definitely<00:04:36.360> feel

00:06:58.170 --> 00:06:58.180 
and it is a little bit easier we also

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:01.110 
and it is a little bit easier we also
have<00:06:58.630> a<00:06:58.870> flap<00:06:59.380> that<00:06:59.560> we<00:06:59.680> can<00:06:59.860> fold<00:07:00.130> over<00:07:00.430> on<00:07:00.610> the
