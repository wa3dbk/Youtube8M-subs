00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
that I have things going indoors so I

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.910 
that I have things going indoors so I
wanted<00:00:20.550> to<00:00:20.670> do<00:00:20.850> an<00:00:21.060> update<00:00:21.420> on<00:00:21.660> the<00:00:22.350> radishes

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
wanted to do an update on the radishes

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.300 
wanted to do an update on the radishes
that<00:00:23.130> I<00:00:23.400> have<00:00:23.730> growing<00:00:24.539> indoors<00:00:25.199> the<00:00:26.099> two

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
that I have growing indoors the two

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.400 
that I have growing indoors the two
radishes<00:00:26.760> in<00:00:27.060> the<00:00:27.240> center<00:00:27.660> look<00:00:27.930> like<00:00:28.170> they're

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
radishes in the center look like they're

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.080 
radishes in the center look like they're
about<00:00:28.590> ready<00:00:28.920> to<00:00:29.010> be<00:00:29.310> harvested

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
about ready to be harvested

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.690 
about ready to be harvested
and<00:00:30.359> this<00:00:30.990> is<00:00:31.199> the<00:00:31.320> side<00:00:31.590> where<00:00:32.009> I<00:00:32.040> send<00:00:32.489> out

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
and this is the side where I send out

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.500 
and this is the side where I send out
every<00:00:33.300> other<00:00:33.860> seedling<00:00:34.860> so<00:00:35.460> they<00:00:36.090> have<00:00:36.270> more

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
every other seedling so they have more

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.229 
every other seedling so they have more
space<00:00:36.570> to<00:00:36.899> grow<00:00:37.380> but<00:00:37.980> not<00:00:38.190> all<00:00:38.520> the<00:00:38.670> plants<00:00:39.059> on

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
space to grow but not all the plants on

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.020 
space to grow but not all the plants on
this<00:00:39.450> row<00:00:39.690> are<00:00:39.930> doing<00:00:40.230> well<00:00:40.440> for<00:00:40.829> example<00:00:41.030> this

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
this row are doing well for example this

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.410 
this row are doing well for example this
guy<00:00:42.360> over<00:00:42.600> here<00:00:42.750> on<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.440> far<00:00:43.680> left<00:00:44.070> is

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:44.420 
guy over here on the far left is

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.510 
guy over here on the far left is
probably<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:45.570> smallest<00:00:46.020> plant<00:00:46.590> in<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.309> pot

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
probably the smallest plant in the pot

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.400 
probably the smallest plant in the pot
so<00:00:47.879> I'm<00:00:47.969> not<00:00:48.090> really<00:00:48.239> sure<00:00:48.360> what<00:00:48.750> contributes

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
so I'm not really sure what contributes

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.229 
so I'm not really sure what contributes
to<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:49.860> growth<00:00:50.100> of<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.730> plant<00:00:52.910> this<00:00:53.910> is<00:00:54.090> the

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
to the growth of the plant this is the

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.450 
to the growth of the plant this is the
other<00:00:54.449> side<00:00:54.780> where<00:00:55.230> I<00:00:55.260> didn't<00:00:55.829> thin<00:00:56.100> out<00:00:56.250> the

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
other side where I didn't thin out the

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.360 
other side where I didn't thin out the
plants<00:00:56.940> and<00:00:57.260> some<00:00:58.260> of<00:00:58.410> them<00:00:58.559> are<00:00:58.770> doing<00:00:59.100> better

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
plants and some of them are doing better

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.910 
plants and some of them are doing better
than<00:00:59.520> others<00:00:59.870> again<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:01.199> ones<00:01:01.410> in<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:01.770> center

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
than others again the ones in the center

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.240 
than others again the ones in the center
seem<00:01:02.370> to<00:01:02.520> be<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:03.090> biggest<00:01:03.409> also<00:01:04.409> kay<00:01:04.619> so<00:01:04.920> I'm

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
seem to be the biggest also kay so I'm

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:14.920 
seem to be the biggest also kay so I'm
going<00:01:05.400> to<00:01:05.460> harvest<00:01:05.970> these<00:01:06.330> two<00:01:06.689> up<00:01:07.080> front<00:01:07.380> oh

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.390 

that's<00:01:15.930> awesome<00:01:16.259> it's<00:01:16.680> a<00:01:16.799> lot<00:01:16.950> bigger<00:01:17.220> than

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
that's awesome it's a lot bigger than

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:29.349 
that's awesome it's a lot bigger than
what<00:01:18.390> I<00:01:18.450> had<00:01:18.750> outside<00:01:19.229> last<00:01:20.189> year

00:01:29.349 --> 00:01:29.359 

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:33.830 

that's<00:01:30.359> really<00:01:30.569> nice<00:01:30.840> went<00:01:31.140> to<00:01:32.270> okay<00:01:33.270> so<00:01:33.329> here

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
that's really nice went to okay so here

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.080 
that's really nice went to okay so here
the<00:01:33.990> two<00:01:34.200> radishes<00:01:34.679> I<00:01:35.100> just<00:01:35.399> harvest<00:01:35.909> these

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
the two radishes I just harvest these

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.359 
the two radishes I just harvest these
are<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:36.600> biggest<00:01:36.810> radishes<00:01:37.350> that<00:01:37.560> I've<00:01:38.069> grown

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
are the biggest radishes that I've grown

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.779 
are the biggest radishes that I've grown
the<00:01:39.179> last<00:01:39.420> time<00:01:39.689> it<00:01:39.869> was<00:01:39.990> just<00:01:40.020> much<00:01:40.530> smaller<00:01:41.399> I

00:01:41.779 --> 00:01:41.789 
the last time it was just much smaller I

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:44.510 
the last time it was just much smaller I
think<00:01:41.850> this<00:01:42.240> is<00:01:42.359> a<00:01:42.390> success<00:01:42.929> for<00:01:43.289> me<00:01:43.520> it's

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
think this is a success for me it's

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.029 
think this is a success for me it's
exactly<00:01:45.060> two<00:01:45.659> months<00:01:46.079> since<00:01:46.259> I<00:01:46.439> sewed<00:01:46.799> the

00:01:47.029 --> 00:01:47.039 
exactly two months since I sewed the

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:50.569 
exactly two months since I sewed the
radish<00:01:47.369> seeds<00:01:47.759> I<00:01:48.119> let<00:01:49.049> it<00:01:49.170> dry<00:01:49.439> out<00:01:49.469> once<00:01:49.979> so

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
radish seeds I let it dry out once so

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.520 
radish seeds I let it dry out once so
that's<00:01:50.969> why<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.299> leaves<00:01:51.659> are<00:01:51.899> looking<00:01:52.349> a

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
that's why the leaves are looking a

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.050 
that's why the leaves are looking a
little<00:01:52.829> bit<00:01:53.299> shabby<00:01:54.890> but<00:01:55.890> I<00:01:55.950> think<00:01:56.429> I'm<00:01:56.759> going

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
little bit shabby but I think I'm going

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.559 
little bit shabby but I think I'm going
to<00:01:57.119> harvest<00:01:57.479> now<00:01:57.780> because<00:01:59.209> they<00:02:00.209> look<00:02:00.390> pretty

00:02:00.559 --> 00:02:00.569 
to harvest now because they look pretty

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:02.529 
to harvest now because they look pretty
ready<00:02:00.869> not<00:02:01.110> all<00:02:01.349> of<00:02:01.500> them<00:02:01.679> but<00:02:01.829> most<00:02:02.039> of<00:02:02.280> them

00:02:02.529 --> 00:02:02.539 
ready not all of them but most of them

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:10.249 
ready not all of them but most of them
so<00:02:03.539> let's<00:02:03.750> see<00:02:03.959> what<00:02:04.110> they<00:02:04.289> look<00:02:04.319> like<00:02:09.259> that's

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
so let's see what they look like that's

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:24.430 
so let's see what they look like that's
a<00:02:10.440> cute<00:02:10.709> little<00:02:10.739> one<00:02:21.739> so<00:02:22.739> that's<00:02:22.980> everything<00:02:23.700> I

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
a cute little one so that's everything I

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.990 
a cute little one so that's everything I
think<00:02:25.440> now<00:02:25.829> I'm<00:02:26.190> going<00:02:26.400> to<00:02:26.519> plant<00:02:26.849> some

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
think now I'm going to plant some

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.420 
think now I'm going to plant some
iSchool<00:02:27.780> radishes<00:02:28.200> this<00:02:28.620> time<00:02:28.859> I<00:02:29.010> got<00:02:29.220> some

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
iSchool radishes this time I got some

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.780 
iSchool radishes this time I got some
seeds<00:02:29.700> for<00:02:29.970> that<00:02:30.090> so<00:02:31.049> I'll<00:02:31.380> probably<00:02:31.609> mix<00:02:32.609> this

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
seeds for that so I'll probably mix this

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.759 
seeds for that so I'll probably mix this
up<00:02:32.940> a<00:02:33.120> little<00:02:33.209> bit<00:02:33.480> and<00:02:33.810> maybe<00:02:33.989> add<00:02:34.260> some<00:02:34.560> worm

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:34.769 
up a little bit and maybe add some worm

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:41.180 
up a little bit and maybe add some worm
castings<00:02:35.400> and<00:02:35.870> plant<00:02:36.870> again<00:02:38.329> and<00:02:39.620> here<00:02:40.620> is<00:02:40.859> the

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
castings and plant again and here is the

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:44.330 
castings and plant again and here is the
last<00:02:41.459> harvest<00:02:41.970> I<00:02:42.510> think<00:02:43.319> it<00:02:43.500> looks<00:02:43.739> very

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
last harvest I think it looks very

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.349 
last harvest I think it looks very

it<00:02:48.359> took<00:02:48.690> probably<00:02:49.680> twice<00:02:50.549> the<00:02:50.819> time<00:02:51.060> that<00:02:51.930> it

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049 
it took probably twice the time that it

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:55.129 
it took probably twice the time that it
says<00:02:52.230> on<00:02:52.260> the<00:02:52.500> packet<00:02:52.919> so<00:02:53.190> two<00:02:53.579> months<00:02:54.000> since<00:02:54.900> I

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:55.139 
says on the packet so two months since I

00:02:55.139 --> 00:02:57.650 
says on the packet so two months since I
sowed<00:02:55.440> the<00:02:55.680> seeds<00:02:55.980> and<00:02:56.310> probably<00:02:57.120> this<00:02:57.269> has<00:02:57.510> to

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
sowed the seeds and probably this has to

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.150 
sowed the seeds and probably this has to
do<00:02:57.810> with<00:02:57.959> the<00:02:58.139> amount<00:02:58.290> of<00:02:58.470> sunlight<00:02:58.739> it's

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
do with the amount of sunlight it's

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.610 
do with the amount of sunlight it's
getting<00:02:59.630> but<00:03:00.630> I'm<00:03:00.750> pretty<00:03:00.930> happy<00:03:01.019> it's<00:03:01.560> like

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620

getting but I'm pretty happy it's like
an<00:03:01.889> indoor<00:03:02.370> experiment<00:03:03.150> and<00:03:03.359> it's<00:03:03.540> it<00:03:04.049> grew

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380
