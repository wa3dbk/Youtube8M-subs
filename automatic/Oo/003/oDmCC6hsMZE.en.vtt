00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.070 
will actually talk to the factory ECU so

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:32.940 
will actually talk to the factory ECU so
all<00:01:30.429> about<00:01:30.700> -<00:01:31.090> cluster<00:01:31.720> all<00:01:32.289> of<00:01:32.410> our<00:01:32.500> controls

on our scene the console will work just

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.419 
on our scene the console will work just
like<00:01:35.259> the<00:01:35.410> car<00:01:35.590> did<00:01:35.800> when<00:01:35.979> we<00:01:36.070> picked<00:01:36.280> it<00:01:36.340> up

00:01:36.419 --> 00:01:36.429 
like the car did when we picked it up

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:38.790 
like the car did when we picked it up
I'm<00:01:36.700> sure<00:01:36.940> it<00:01:37.119> will<00:01:37.390> so<00:01:37.929> estimated<00:01:38.560> power

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:38.800 
I'm sure it will so estimated power

I'm sure it will so estimated power
output<00:01:39.280> is<00:01:39.459> provided<00:01:40.000> about<00:01:40.179> 500<00:01:40.890> so<00:01:41.890> now<00:01:42.039> that

00:01:42.089 --> 00:01:42.099

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:45.009 
the car is a mid-engine car and in that

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:46.889 
the car is a mid-engine car and in that
relation<00:01:45.490> that<00:01:45.640> is<00:01:45.759> very<00:01:46.119> mid-engine<00:01:46.660> the

00:01:46.889 --> 00:01:46.899 
relation that is very mid-engine the

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:49.290 
relation that is very mid-engine the
engine<00:01:47.289> is<00:01:47.410> very<00:01:47.709> far<00:01:48.009> forward<00:01:48.310> for<00:01:48.670> a<00:01:48.700> v8<00:01:49.000> and

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.730 
frame but now cradles both our engine
and<00:02:30.400> now<00:02:30.790> transmission<00:02:31.450> and<00:02:31.690> our<00:02:32.350> suspension

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:32.740 
and now transmission and our suspension

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.910 
and now transmission and our suspension
points<00:02:33.280> so<00:02:33.850> all<00:02:34.030> of<00:02:34.240> this<00:02:34.360> six<00:02:35.290> bolts<00:02:35.560> can<00:02:35.830> be

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
points so all of this six bolts can be

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.160 
points so all of this six bolts can be
dropped<00:02:36.130> out<00:02:36.400> of<00:02:36.670> the<00:02:36.790> car<00:02:37.000> and<00:02:37.540> navels<00:02:37.960> the

car to be easily be worked off and a
very<00:02:41.380> simple<00:02:41.770> design<00:02:42.150> this<00:02:43.150> back<00:02:43.570> point<00:02:43.870> the

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
very simple design this back point the

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:47.070 
very simple design this back point the
rear<00:02:44.530> point<00:02:44.860> and<00:02:45.160> a<00:02:45.280> front<00:02:45.550> point<00:02:45.820> this<00:02:46.750> is<00:02:46.930> all

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
rear point and a front point this is all

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.320 
rear point and a front point this is all
part<00:02:47.380> of<00:02:47.530> the<00:02:47.740> factory<00:02:48.550> subframe<00:02:49.090> the

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
part of the factory subframe the

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.900 
part of the factory subframe the
suspension<00:02:49.990> subframe<00:02:50.470> and<00:02:50.890> what<00:02:51.550> we've<00:02:51.760> gone

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
suspension subframe and what we've gone

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.180 
suspension subframe and what we've gone
and<00:02:52.090> done<00:02:52.150> is<00:02:52.390> we've<00:02:52.600> taken<00:02:52.930> another<00:02:53.740> part<00:02:54.040> of

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
and done is we've taken another part of

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:57.000 
and done is we've taken another part of
another<00:02:54.430> subframe<00:02:55.060> and<00:02:55.420> added<00:02:56.230> another<00:02:56.410> link

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
another subframe and added another link

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.520 
another subframe and added another link
to<00:02:57.340> the<00:02:57.460> front<00:02:57.730> gear<00:02:58.000> box<00:02:58.690> pin<00:02:58.990> up<00:02:59.140> the<00:02:59.290> frame

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
to the front gear box pin up the frame

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.460 
to the front gear box pin up the frame
rail<00:02:59.770> and<00:03:00.420> gusseted<00:03:01.420> this<00:03:01.600> into<00:03:01.990> the<00:03:02.110> factory

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
rail and gusseted this into the factory

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.190 
rail and gusseted this into the factory
subframe<00:03:02.920> so<00:03:03.130> now<00:03:03.310> we've<00:03:03.580> turned<00:03:03.880> this

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
subframe so now we've turned this

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.040 
subframe so now we've turned this
suspension<00:03:05.200> subframe<00:03:05.860> into<00:03:06.310> a<00:03:06.340> engine

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
suspension subframe into a engine

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:10.020 
suspension subframe into a engine
transmission<00:03:08.050> and<00:03:08.680> suspension<00:03:08.920> subframe<00:03:09.730> so

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
transmission and suspension subframe so

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.890 
transmission and suspension subframe so
one<00:03:10.360> two<00:03:11.230> three<00:03:11.980> bolts<00:03:12.340> on<00:03:12.400> either<00:03:12.730> side<00:03:13.060> we

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
one two three bolts on either side we

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.580 
one two three bolts on either side we
can<00:03:14.020> drop<00:03:14.200> the<00:03:14.380> whole<00:03:14.620> drivetrain

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
can drop the whole drivetrain

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.860 
can drop the whole drivetrain
one<00:03:17.190> of<00:03:17.310> the<00:03:17.400> other<00:03:17.550> unique<00:03:18.180> features<00:03:18.720> that

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
one of the other unique features that

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.440 
one of the other unique features that
we've<00:03:19.020> done<00:03:19.200> on<00:03:19.380> the<00:03:19.410> build<00:03:19.680> is<00:03:19.890> the<00:03:20.239> window<00:03:21.239> is

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
we've done on the build is the window is

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.660 
we've done on the build is the window is
fixed<00:03:22.050> on<00:03:22.260> the<00:03:22.830> back<00:03:22.980> of<00:03:23.160> the<00:03:23.220> production

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
fixed on the back of the production

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.089 
fixed on the back of the production
genesis<00:03:24.090> coupe<00:03:24.270> and<00:03:24.870> your<00:03:25.110> trunk<00:03:25.440> is<00:03:25.620> hinged

00:03:26.089 --> 00:03:26.099 
genesis coupe and your trunk is hinged

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:28.280 
genesis coupe and your trunk is hinged
well<00:03:26.940> because<00:03:27.270> we've<00:03:27.450> got<00:03:27.630> so<00:03:27.810> many<00:03:27.930> goodies

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
well because we've got so many goodies

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:31.430 
well because we've got so many goodies
now<00:03:29.000> under<00:03:30.000> the<00:03:30.090> trunk<00:03:30.390> not<00:03:30.900> under<00:03:31.140> the<00:03:31.230> hood

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
now under the trunk not under the hood

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.820 
now under the trunk not under the hood
we've<00:03:32.310> actually<00:03:32.459> made<00:03:32.760> a<00:03:32.819> hood<00:03:33.150> hinged<00:03:33.830> trunk

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:34.830 
we've actually made a hood hinged trunk

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:39.259 
we've actually made a hood hinged trunk
or<00:03:35.580> a<00:03:35.970> finished<00:03:36.450> hatch<00:03:36.739> so<00:03:38.000> I'm<00:03:39.000> going<00:03:39.239> to

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:39.269 
or a finished hatch so I'm going to

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:41.979 
or a finished hatch so I'm going to
confidently<00:03:39.810> say<00:03:40.200> that<00:03:40.230> this<00:03:40.590> is<00:03:40.800> the<00:03:40.950> only

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:41.989 
confidently say that this is the only

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:46.160 
confidently say that this is the only
hatchback<00:03:42.989> genesis<00:03:43.530> coupe<00:03:43.709> in<00:03:43.890> the<00:03:43.950> world
