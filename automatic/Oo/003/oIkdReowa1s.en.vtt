00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
let's say here during exercise on

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.659 
let's say here during exercise on
training<00:00:31.230> days<00:00:31.500> or<00:00:31.859> throughout<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.430> day<00:00:32.550> on

training days or throughout the day on
non<00:00:32.880> training<00:00:33.300> days<00:00:33.450> so<00:00:33.690> basically<00:00:34.079> just<00:00:34.170> get

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
non training days so basically just get

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.560 
non training days so basically just get
those<00:00:34.739> BCAAs<00:00:35.460> in<00:00:35.640> your<00:00:35.790> body<00:00:35.969> get<00:00:36.300> them<00:00:36.390> into

00:01:47.639 --> 00:01:47.649 
dump this in the one stick package says

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:49.200 
dump this in the one stick package says
dump<00:01:47.890> it<00:01:48.009> in<00:01:48.130> 8<00:01:48.280> ounces<00:01:48.580> of<00:01:48.670> water<00:01:48.729> which<00:01:48.970> I

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.210 
dump it in 8 ounces of water which I

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.460 
dump it in 8 ounces of water which I
have

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:53.470

admitted<00:02:23.760> a<00:02:23.819> couple<00:02:24.060> more<00:02:24.240> times<00:02:24.450> here

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.449 

there<00:02:35.220> we<00:02:35.340> go<00:02:36.349> virtually<00:02:37.349> no<00:02:37.530> chumps<00:02:38.129> lon

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
there we go virtually no chumps lon

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:42.910 
there we go virtually no chumps lon
little<00:02:39.000> white<00:02:39.180> floating<00:02:40.040> so<00:02:41.040> good<00:02:41.849> mixability

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
little white floating so good mixability

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:48.800
