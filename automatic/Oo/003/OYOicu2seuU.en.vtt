00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.869 
slices and I decorated this one too and
then<00:02:35.930> she<00:02:36.319> gave<00:02:36.439> me<00:02:36.500> this<00:02:36.739> to<00:02:36.980> experiment<00:02:37.730> on

00:02:37.869 --> 00:02:37.879 
then she gave me this to experiment on

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:41.289 
then she gave me this to experiment on
this<00:02:38.180> is<00:02:38.359> just<00:02:38.569> a<00:02:38.689> little<00:02:38.989> I<00:02:40.060> don't<00:02:41.060> know<00:02:41.150> you

00:02:41.289 --> 00:02:41.299 
this is just a little I don't know you

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:42.819 
this is just a little I don't know you
it<00:02:41.569> will<00:02:41.629> eclipse<00:02:41.900> on<00:02:42.170> to<00:02:42.319> your<00:02:42.439> pants<00:02:42.739> or

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:42.829 
it will eclipse on to your pants or

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:45.250 
it will eclipse on to your pants or
something<00:02:42.980> and<00:02:43.280> it<00:02:43.430> goes<00:02:43.609> like<00:02:43.760> this<00:02:43.909> and<00:02:44.659> its

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
something and it goes like this and its

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.710 
something and it goes like this and its
really<00:02:45.470> long<00:02:45.950> though<00:02:46.250> this<00:02:46.459> part<00:02:46.730> and<00:02:46.970> you<00:02:47.569> can

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
really long though this part and you can

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.770 
really long though this part and you can
like<00:02:47.840> a<00:02:48.500> clip<00:02:49.400> on<00:02:49.579> your<00:02:49.790> keys<00:02:50.299> or<00:02:50.480> something

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
like a clip on your keys or something

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.929 
like a clip on your keys or something
and<00:02:51.139> I<00:02:51.379> made<00:02:51.680> these<00:02:51.799> little<00:02:52.040> pendants<00:02:52.579> like

00:02:52.929 --> 00:02:52.939 
and I made these little pendants like

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:57.879 
and I made these little pendants like
this<00:02:53.209> one<00:02:53.980> this<00:02:54.980> is<00:02:55.129> a<00:02:55.159> little<00:02:55.459> um<00:02:56.500> green<00:02:57.500> one

00:02:57.879 --> 00:02:57.889 
this one this is a little um green one

00:02:57.889 --> 00:03:03.640 
this one this is a little um green one
and<00:02:58.250> then<00:02:58.400> here<00:02:58.760> is<00:02:58.909> um<00:03:00.549> this<00:03:01.549> little<00:03:01.819> one<00:03:02.650> and

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
and then here is um this little one and

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.390 
and then here is um this little one and
I<00:03:03.980> also<00:03:04.189> made<00:03:04.700> a<00:03:05.060> little<00:03:05.269> ring<00:03:05.780> and<00:03:06.169> I<00:03:07.129> don't

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
I also made a little ring and I don't

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.429
