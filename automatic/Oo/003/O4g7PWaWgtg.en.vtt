00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:16.990
 cocktail and one from the caribbean 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:20.650
 a monitor offers a clock so go 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:31.390
 if half the world compare all the 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:33.790
 I recommend one to two spoons 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.330
 Three of you are traveling in the Münsterwald 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:39.100
 do 

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:41.199
 depending on how you loved it, yes 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:44.409
 animal then porree expensive perfect mix 

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:46.420
 ran lets stamp the whole only the 

00:00:44.409 --> 00:00:49.589
 latte our cane sugar location 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:54.159
 plastic wood depending on what suits him 

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:55.989
 what she finds important with the power of 

00:00:54.159 --> 00:00:59.760
 sports make a bit of his 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:04.500
 There's a lot going on out there all day 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.500
 cancer we need the next one 

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:13.179
 fair leaves 45 we are already here 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:15.429
 I'll go for it in simple terms 

00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:18.250
 damp cloth lives remains very long 

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:22.090
 Fresh and the week says the winemaker 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:25.630
 not just pounding, otherwise you push 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:27.969
 the whole bittern out with that 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:32.979
 I think a bit disgusting 

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:34.689
 so live in the case you can 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:38.649
 really take another white around 

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:41.100
 such as bakali or what you do 

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:43.539
 at home you have what you find in the 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.049
 shopping market after no 

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:46.689
 differences 

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:51.359
 I usually do it 5 this is the one 

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:54.810
 best we could get with the 15 

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:54.810
 just on top 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:03.780
 so little circle you need the glass 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:06.750
 not quite full but makes already 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.930
 whatever is pure so that the glass 314 he fully 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.930
 is 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:41.550
 let why ranges and performs all 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:49.050
 Just minerals on a good sip with it 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:52.770
 the whole second gets elements 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:56.850
 you the whole will then piece one 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:03:01.200
 It is the voice of Münster that decorates it 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:03.560
 quite pretty from joy to welcome it 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.560
 so on
