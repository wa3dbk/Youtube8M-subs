00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.750

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:09.320
 So textures package texture pack for 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:13.860

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.029
 It 's easy, I'll give you two 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.880

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.680
 Two left to texture pack you could 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.410
 Just download and I'll do it 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.820
 Now all the more hannibals my strength 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.680
 texture pack the textures 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.420
 I have this on a website below 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.059
 loaded but a few textures 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.100
 that's what the textures mean 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.840
 Rooms are negotiable among others 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:41.370
 which is still done to someone else 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.570

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.129
 I'll just say that with the 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.700
 my kraft texture pack and that 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:51.449
 Unpack that and open it 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:53.670
 folder here until you see all these pictures 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:57.210
 you see and you mark that now 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.730
 All control right click and then on 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:04.049
 Copy then starts the program a 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:05.250
 fan box as administrator if you have 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.960
 should you be able to do it that way i know 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.310
 but now also iphone docks forgive 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.170
 will certainly others 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.170
 programs for serve and serve them all 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:16.369
 just as similar works and jo 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.600
 Now we just close our device 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:23.180
 to the pc 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:26.610
 wait a minute about the landmarks and 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:28.080
 subsequently connected the same 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.210
 he would have to recognize here I know 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.790
 not if i look mine as if mine 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.180
 program always bakes that funny here 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.409
 now 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.939
 the ipod touch with recognized apparently 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.610
 It looks the same and you go here 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:43.290
 on user applications 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.350
 oh and you have to go on iphone too 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.030
 go box classic and then you have to 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.210

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.550

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:57.720
 and now her here again 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:59.570
 Right-click on the page and click 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.500
 to insert 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:03.210

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.160
 textures pure the actionwerk now 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.570
 you have to make sure that 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:12.980
 from the urban during the process 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:17.490
 is closed and yes really finished 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:19.680
 and go a bit of texture pack 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.760
 is in it now you can the device 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.040
 separate again 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.959
 The best is that if now here 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.660

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:29.150

 disconnect her now 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.300
 neustadt it is not absolutely necessary 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.570
 but I would recommend you violently 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.890

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:40.440
