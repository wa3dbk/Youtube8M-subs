00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:41.830 
and down I'll get my man in there edge

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:46.380 
and down I'll get my man in there edge
you<00:01:42.070> can<00:01:42.190> see<00:01:43.770> goes<00:01:44.770> up<00:01:44.980> and<00:01:45.190> down<00:01:45.250> and<00:01:46.150> would

you can see goes up and down and would

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.350 
you can see goes up and down and would
also<00:01:46.540> do<00:01:46.780> the<00:01:46.870> same<00:01:47.080> thing<00:01:47.140> left<00:01:47.860> and<00:01:48.010> right

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
also do the same thing left and right

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.910 
also do the same thing left and right
only<00:01:49.360> thing<00:01:49.600> the<00:01:49.720> left<00:01:50.140> to<00:01:50.260> right<00:01:50.410> is<00:01:50.560> a<00:01:50.590> little

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
only thing the left to right is a little

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.440 
only thing the left to right is a little
bit<00:01:51.070> different<00:01:51.520> as<00:01:51.640> it<00:01:51.790> has<00:01:51.910> a<00:01:51.940> breakaway

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450 
bit different as it has a breakaway

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.110 
bit different as it has a breakaway
cylinder<00:01:53.140> and<00:01:53.860> what<00:01:54.070> that<00:01:54.250> means<00:01:54.460> to<00:01:54.670> you<00:01:54.970> is

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:55.120 
cylinder and what that means to you is

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:56.370 
cylinder and what that means to you is
if<00:01:55.270> you<00:01:55.360> hit<00:01:55.510> something<00:01:55.780> really<00:01:56.170> hard

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
if you hit something really hard

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.940 
if you hit something really hard
something<00:01:57.310> has<00:01:57.640> to<00:01:57.820> give<00:01:58.080> the<00:01:59.080> cylinder<00:01:59.620> has<00:01:59.920> a

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 
something has to give the cylinder has a

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:01.770 
something has to give the cylinder has a
breakaway<00:02:00.430> valve<00:02:00.820> that<00:02:01.330> relieves<00:02:01.600> the

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
breakaway valve that relieves the

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.290 
breakaway valve that relieves the
pressure<00:02:01.930> and<00:02:02.800> will<00:02:02.950> allow<00:02:03.100> the<00:02:03.160> a<00:02:03.370> the<00:02:03.850> play

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:04.300 
pressure and will allow the a the play

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.240 
pressure and will allow the a the play
to<00:02:04.360> give<00:02:04.690> it'll<00:02:05.260> reset<00:02:05.680> in<00:02:05.800> about<00:02:05.980> five

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
to give it'll reset in about five
