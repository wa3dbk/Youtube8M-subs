00:00:00.064 --> 00:00:03.947
 When you look at shots or pictures of astronauts in space, 

00:00:03.947 --> 00:00:07.430
 There does not seem to be any attraction while working here. 

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:12.678
 Everything does not fall in one direction - in fact it is not even clear what is the top or bottom. 

00:00:12.678 --> 00:00:14.118
 Everything Floats Around ... 

00:00:14.118 --> 00:00:16.115
 If you push this wall, 

00:00:16.115 --> 00:00:17.786
 I will float in that direction. 

00:00:17.786 --> 00:00:25.774
 So, it does not seem there is such a mass effect as gravity that is trying to pull everything down. 

00:00:25.774 --> 00:00:33.019
 But the question is that these astronauts are still not far from the huge body (Earth) 

00:00:33.019 --> 00:00:39.427
 In fact the space shuttle rises a few hundred miles above the Earth's surface. 

00:00:39.427 --> 00:00:43.607
 If the space shuttle, if you draw it, is likely to be right there. 

00:00:43.607 --> 00:00:48.920
 We know that the force of gravity between two bodies is equal 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:01:00.400
 C, the gravity constant multiplied by the mass of the first body, multiplied by the mass of the second body, divided by the square of the distance between the two bodies. 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.415
 The space shuttle is right here 

00:01:02.415 --> 00:01:06.133
 Only a few hundred millimeters above ground, 

00:01:06.133 --> 00:01:11.984
 These "nicks" do not differ much, it's a little farther than if you were on the surface of the earth. 

00:01:11.984 --> 00:01:17.800
 Remember that it is "pure" measured from where you are, to the center of the earth. 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:23.453
 Or a real niqab is from the center of the body to the center of the earth, the center of the earth represents the distance here. 

00:01:23.453 --> 00:01:28.050
 If you're on the surface of the earth, or you're on a few hundred miles from the surface of the earth 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:33.298
 It will not change "نق" significantly in particular in percentage 

00:01:33.298 --> 00:01:34.800
 So when we look that way 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:40.124
 It seems quite clear that the gravitational force of a person is in space 

00:01:40.124 --> 00:01:48.623
 Only a few hundred miles above the Earth's surface should not be coiled differently from the gravitational force of a person standing on the earth's surface. 

00:01:48.623 --> 00:01:51.456
 So my question to you is what gives? 

00:01:51.456 --> 00:01:58.000
 If you have to be attracted to space, how can we collect these images for people swimming in space 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:05.016
 The answer is, if there is an attraction in space, these people actually fall 

00:02:05.016 --> 00:02:10.125
 They are moving fast enough for the speed of the earth to keep them away. 

00:02:10.125 --> 00:02:12.029
 Let me tell you what I'm talking about. 

00:02:12.029 --> 00:02:16.142
 Where if you take, if you choose 

00:02:16.142 --> 00:02:19.318
 Let's see, I'm sitting here in Africa, shooting at something 

00:02:19.318 --> 00:02:26.379
 Maybe I have a really good slingshot and would like to hurt a moving object very quickly maybe 45 degrees. 

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:29.800
 It may take a short time and eventually hit another point. 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.369
 This is actually what is already a great doppler slingshot. 

00:02:32.369 --> 00:02:36.085
 I will travel at least thousands of miles, at least thousands of miles 

00:02:36.085 --> 00:02:40.682
 If it starts up more quickly, if it is more powerful 

00:02:40.682 --> 00:02:45.373
 The missile will launch a little more quickly, 

00:02:45.373 --> 00:02:47.091
 But certainly will return to Earth. 

00:02:47.091 --> 00:02:49.691
 Let's try to push it faster than this. 

00:02:49.691 --> 00:02:52.385
 Then it will fall towards the ground. 

00:02:52.385 --> 00:02:58.097
 Let's push it harder than those, it will eventually fall down toward the ground. 

00:02:58.097 --> 00:02:59.788
 I think you see where you go. 

00:02:59.788 --> 00:03:01.200
 Let's move faster 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.363
 If it starts up more quickly, eventually it will fall towards the ground, faster than those. 

00:03:06.363 --> 00:03:14.351
 If you push an object faster than that, it will move away and then fall towards the ground. 

00:03:14.351 --> 00:03:15.698
 I think you see what's happening 

00:03:15.698 --> 00:03:21.467
 All the time, you are moving faster and faster, aiming your shell faster, faster, more and more 

00:03:21.467 --> 00:03:29.998
 For a certain speed when you leave the shell, all the time, it is trying to fall towards the ground 

00:03:29.998 --> 00:03:33.438
 You will move quickly trying to leave the ground. 

00:03:33.438 --> 00:03:40.341
 It will spin and rotate around the ground, and the shell would resemble a planet 

00:03:40.356 --> 00:03:51.644
 If what happens if there is no magnetizing force for the shell, if there is no acceleration of gravity the body will move straight towards space 

00:03:51.644 --> 00:04:02.079
 But because of the constant force of gravity that drives the shell towards the center of the earth, or the center of that shell and the center of the earth will rush toward each other. 

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:03.471
 I think it's the best way to think about it. 

00:04:03.533 --> 00:04:15.395
 The force of gravity does it, turning the shell's way into a curve and moving fast enough if the shell or any object we talk about is going to spin around the earth 

00:04:15.426 --> 00:04:27.748
 Because there is not much to the surface, there is no air if you are on a high altitude such as a space shuttle, such as the absence of a noticeable pull 

00:04:27.748 --> 00:04:31.469
 This will be observed for a period of time 

00:04:31.469 --> 00:04:44.544
 Although there is little cloud, this is why satellites slow down, because of a small resistance to air, if the answer to this puzzle (a difficult problem or question) that there is actually gravity 

00:04:44.575 --> 00:04:54.115
 It's not a gravity-free environment, it's what happens that the astronauts of space shuttle and everything in space will fall 

00:04:54.115 --> 00:04:58.802
 But it moves so fast that it does not hit the ground, does not reach the ground 

00:04:58.802 --> 00:05:01.854
 It keeps spin and spin and spin. 

00:05:01.854 --> 00:05:04.467
 But, fully under the influence of gravity 

00:05:04.513 --> 00:05:10.698
 If its speed is slowing, there is a brake for the ground 

00:05:10.698 --> 00:05:17.982
 They put the brakes here, and they will go down towards the ground. 

00:05:17.982 --> 00:05:24.515
 There is nothing special about its movement three hundred or four hundred miles away in space, where the effect of gravity does not appear 

00:05:24.515 --> 00:05:27.818
 In fact the effect of gravity at a certain level. You can not 

00:05:27.818 --> 00:05:35.885
 It seems to be unnoticeable at some points, but it is hundreds of miles higher than the air, known for its gravity 

00:05:35.885 --> 00:05:40.952
 You will be in orbit, you will move fast enough, so if you fall, it will not hit the ground 

00:05:40.952 --> 00:05:51.802
 If you want to estimate the force of gravity, and this is actually what NASA did, where gravity was able to put people in a plane called the "rocket vomiter" because it makes the people in it sick. 

00:05:51.802 --> 00:05:59.218
 As if their movement is a projectile projectile, where if the path of the shell in the parabola, will say. 

00:05:59.218 --> 00:06:09.793
 If the plane will take off it will operate as a free fall or in a parallel track 

00:06:09.793 --> 00:06:13.283
 If anyone found in that plane will experience free fall. 

00:06:13.283 --> 00:06:20.167
 Where, if you will jump, jump if you jump bungee or parachute 

00:06:20.167 --> 00:06:28.369
 Mm, until feeling when the cylinder moves up and then drops down you will feel pain in your stomach because of the free fall. 

00:06:28.369 --> 00:06:33.856
 This is exactly what astronauts feel when they are in a constant state of free fall. 

00:06:33.856 --> 00:06:43.338
 But it is not noticeable when you are in deep space and you are not close to any noticeable mass. 

00:06:43.338 --> 00:06:50.387
 It feels exactly the same if you feel there is no gravity around you. 

00:06:50.387 --> 00:06:57.854
 Let's clarify things a bit? For someone who is in the space shuttle and there are no windows, there is no way to find out 

00:06:57.854 --> 00:07:02.582
 If they are close to the body mass or they feel free fall, they're in the planet or 

00:07:02.659 --> 99:59:59.999
 Or they are completely away from any mass or they are in a place where little gravity
