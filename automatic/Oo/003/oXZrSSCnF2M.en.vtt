 scrub phases are list of shoulders 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.330
 this digs me good general conditions

 but pushed by sea entrances to 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.959
 confirmed because the index of 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:34.479
 confidence is low for the wind one to 

00:01:31.959 --> 00:01:37.149
