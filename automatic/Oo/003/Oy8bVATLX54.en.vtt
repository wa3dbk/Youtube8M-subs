00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
definitely as an investor you know it's

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.539 
definitely as an investor you know it's
not<00:02:34.840> just<00:02:34.900> the<00:02:35.320> minerals<00:02:35.709> there<00:02:36.070> but<00:02:36.340> being

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:36.549 
not just the minerals there but being

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:38.819 
not just the minerals there but being
able<00:02:36.640> to<00:02:36.790> pull<00:02:36.970> it<00:02:37.060> out<00:02:37.180> at<00:02:37.480> a<00:02:37.630> low<00:02:37.840> cost<00:02:38.079> of

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:38.829 
able to pull it out at a low cost of

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:40.319 
able to pull it out at a low cost of
course<00:02:39.100> being<00:02:39.310> conservative<00:02:39.940> here<00:02:40.090> really

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:40.329 
course being conservative here really

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:42.720 
course being conservative here really
helps<00:02:40.690> you<00:02:40.810> do<00:02:40.930> want<00:02:41.110> to<00:02:41.230> you<00:02:41.650> know<00:02:41.769> if<00:02:42.340> they<00:02:42.549> up

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
helps you do want to you know if they up

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:44.550 
helps you do want to you know if they up
shoot<00:02:43.030> and<00:02:43.269> they<00:02:43.510> exceed<00:02:43.959> your<00:02:44.140> conservative

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
shoot and they exceed your conservative

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.080 
shoot and they exceed your conservative
estimates<00:02:44.920> that's<00:02:45.070> great<00:02:45.370> but<00:02:45.880> being

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
estimates that's great but being

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:47.789 
estimates that's great but being
conservative<00:02:46.420> helps<00:02:46.720> you<00:02:46.870> filter<00:02:47.350> out<00:02:47.590> some

00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:47.799 
conservative helps you filter out some

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:50.910 
conservative helps you filter out some
of<00:02:47.860> the<00:02:47.980> losing<00:02:48.280> potential<00:02:48.820> losers

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
of the losing potential losers

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.370 
of the losing potential losers
another<00:02:51.819> thing<00:02:52.060> to<00:02:52.180> focus<00:02:52.330> on<00:02:52.690> is<00:02:52.870> cost<00:02:53.170> per

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
another thing to focus on is cost per

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:54.720 
another thing to focus on is cost per
ounce<00:02:53.410> so<00:02:53.800> a<00:02:53.860> lot<00:02:54.010> of<00:02:54.100> companies<00:02:54.490> in<00:02:54.520> their

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
ounce so a lot of companies in their

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.520 
ounce so a lot of companies in their
investor<00:02:55.060> presentation<00:02:55.720> will<00:02:55.930> list<00:02:56.140> a<00:02:56.260> cost

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
investor presentation will list a cost

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.650 
investor presentation will list a cost
per<00:02:56.740> ounce<00:02:56.770> this<00:02:57.580> is<00:02:57.640> really<00:02:58.090> important<00:02:58.569> you

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
per ounce this is really important you

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.300 
per ounce this is really important you
know<00:02:58.780> it's<00:02:59.110> basically<00:02:59.440> the<00:02:59.860> the<00:03:00.069> opportunity

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
know it's basically the the opportunity

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.449 
know it's basically the the opportunity
the<00:03:00.700> company<00:03:01.030> has<00:03:01.209> is<00:03:01.750> you<00:03:02.410> know<00:03:02.560> the<00:03:03.010> market

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:03.459 
the company has is you know the market

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:05.520 
the company has is you know the market
price<00:03:03.640> in<00:03:03.790> the<00:03:03.850> mineral<00:03:04.240> -<00:03:04.930> the<00:03:05.080> cost<00:03:05.290> per

their<00:03:07.750> that<00:03:08.500> they<00:03:08.650> can<00:03:08.920> access<00:03:09.100> that's<00:03:09.880> sort

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:10.209 
their that they can access that's sort

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:13.110 
their that they can access that's sort

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:25.470 
something that has 4,100 grams per ton a
lot<00:03:23.260> of<00:03:23.380> the<00:03:23.470> mines<00:03:23.680> now<00:03:24.010> have<00:03:24.580> less<00:03:25.030> than<00:03:25.270> 2

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
lot of the mines now have less than 2

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.810 
lot of the mines now have less than 2
grams<00:03:25.780> per<00:03:26.440> ton<00:03:26.620> less<00:03:26.860> than<00:03:27.040> one<00:03:27.310> gram<00:03:27.610> per<00:03:27.640> ton

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:27.820 
grams per ton less than one gram per ton

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:31.070 
grams per ton less than one gram per ton
so<00:03:28.180> this<00:03:28.330> really<00:03:28.630> shows<00:03:28.750> an<00:03:29.140> extreme<00:03:29.560> scenario

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
so this really shows an extreme scenario

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:34.170 
so this really shows an extreme scenario
but<00:03:32.080> that<00:03:32.230> higher<00:03:32.920> grams<00:03:33.310> per<00:03:33.519> ton<00:03:33.700> generally

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
but that higher grams per ton generally

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.750 
but that higher grams per ton generally
is<00:03:34.239> gonna<00:03:34.360> have<00:03:34.510> a<00:03:34.540> lower<00:03:34.870> cost<00:03:35.290> of<00:03:35.590> mining<00:03:35.830> so

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
is gonna have a lower cost of mining so

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.850 
is gonna have a lower cost of mining so
that<00:03:36.940> sort<00:03:37.180> of<00:03:37.239> gives<00:03:37.420> you<00:03:37.540> an<00:03:37.630> idea<00:03:37.860> something

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:38.860 
that sort of gives you an idea something

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.100 
that sort of gives you an idea something
like<00:03:39.070> this<00:03:39.220> a<00:03:39.280> 4<00:03:39.700> over<00:03:39.850> 4000<00:03:40.540> is<00:03:40.600> very<00:03:40.840> rare

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.110 
like this a 4 over 4000 is very rare

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:42.630 
like this a 4 over 4000 is very rare
like<00:03:41.320> I<00:03:41.410> mentioned<00:03:41.739> most<00:03:41.830> of<00:03:41.980> them<00:03:42.130> around<00:03:42.370> one

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:42.640 
like I mentioned most of them around one

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.820 
like I mentioned most of them around one
gram<00:03:42.910> now<00:03:43.230> you<00:03:44.230> know<00:03:44.320> a<00:03:44.350> lot<00:03:44.530> of<00:03:44.590> people<00:03:44.739> are

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:44.830 
gram now you know a lot of people are

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:46.229 
gram now you know a lot of people are
concerned<00:03:45.130> that<00:03:45.430> a<00:03:45.670> lot<00:03:45.760> of<00:03:45.940> the<00:03:46.060> easy

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:46.239 
concerned that a lot of the easy

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:47.910 
concerned that a lot of the easy
resource<00:03:46.780> has<00:03:46.930> been<00:03:46.959> taken<00:03:47.290> up<00:03:47.410> so<00:03:47.530> the<00:03:47.620> mining

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:47.920 
resource has been taken up so the mining

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:49.199 
resource has been taken up so the mining
business<00:03:48.220> is<00:03:48.340> getting<00:03:48.430> a<00:03:48.580> little<00:03:48.640> bit<00:03:48.820> harder

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.209 
business is getting a little bit harder

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:53.610 
business is getting a little bit harder
now<00:03:51.180> history<00:03:52.180> repeats<00:03:52.720> areas<00:03:53.230> that<00:03:53.380> I've<00:03:53.470> had
