00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:25.710
 link with some carrier demand 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:31.109
 more firm in setting you down 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:34.020
 over the phone and the 15 and face 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:37.680
 my annual dinner of 5 the middle is a 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:47.000
 bike and what you have 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:56.460
 but also attention here what happens 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:59.629
