00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.990 
I see some girl with the cat on the back
of<00:02:25.570> her<00:02:25.660> jacket<00:02:25.900> it<00:02:26.770> starts<00:02:27.130> to<00:02:27.310> go<00:02:27.670> beyond

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
of her jacket it starts to go beyond

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.910 
of her jacket it starts to go beyond
being<00:02:28.570> a<00:02:28.660> clothing<00:02:29.140> line<00:02:29.320> and<00:02:29.530> it<00:02:29.620> becomes

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
being a clothing line and it becomes

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.070 
being a clothing line and it becomes
something<00:02:30.160> that<00:02:30.430> resonates<00:02:31.000> and<00:02:31.239> embodies

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
something that resonates and embodies

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.670 
something that resonates and embodies
these<00:02:32.380> different<00:02:33.070> wonderful<00:02:33.760> women

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
these different wonderful women

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.470 
these different wonderful women
it<00:02:35.680> takes<00:02:35.920> a<00:02:36.160> lot<00:02:36.370> I<00:02:36.400> think<00:02:36.760> to<00:02:36.910> build<00:02:37.150> and<00:02:37.360> grow

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
it takes a lot I think to build and grow

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.310 
it takes a lot I think to build and grow
a<00:02:37.570> brand<00:02:38.020> and<00:02:38.320> sort<00:02:38.680> of<00:02:38.739> create<00:02:39.130> that<00:02:39.430> trust<00:02:40.320> we

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:41.320 
a brand and sort of create that trust we

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.710 
a brand and sort of create that trust we
have<00:02:41.350> our<00:02:41.709> fingers<00:02:42.370> on<00:02:42.610> the<00:02:42.670> pulse<00:02:42.940> of<00:02:43.480> what's

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
have our fingers on the pulse of what's

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.030 
have our fingers on the pulse of what's
hot<00:02:44.110> I<00:02:44.170> think<00:02:44.590> that's<00:02:44.739> part<00:02:45.040> of<00:02:45.100> our<00:02:45.220> longevity
