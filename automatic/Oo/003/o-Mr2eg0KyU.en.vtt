server lists from the mine shaft or info
website<00:00:21.150> and<00:00:21.630> then<00:00:22.410> find<00:00:23.340> the<00:00:23.869> server<00:00:24.869> that<00:00:25.380> is

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
don't even need the server for this I

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.090 
don't even need the server for this I
thought<00:00:54.420> you<00:00:54.690> did<00:00:54.870> but<00:00:55.109> you<00:00:55.140> don't<00:00:55.440> then<00:00:55.649> hit

used<00:01:48.840> to<00:01:48.990> register<00:01:49.140> and<00:01:49.710> then<00:01:51.800> sometimes<00:01:52.800> it

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
used to register and then sometimes it

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.170 
used to register and then sometimes it
will<00:01:52.980> say<00:01:53.160> are<00:01:53.280> you<00:01:53.310> logged<00:01:53.580> in<00:01:53.730> sometimes

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
on the servers and also be very just

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.309 
on the servers and also be very just
don't<00:02:20.680> always<00:02:21.310> join<00:02:21.760> a<00:02:21.790> server<00:02:22.060> just<00:02:22.810> go

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:23.319 
don't always join a server just go

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:28.559 
don't always join a server just go
usually<00:02:24.030> um<00:02:25.799> actually<00:02:27.180> because<00:02:28.180> most<00:02:28.390> of<00:02:28.480> the

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:28.569 
usually um actually because most of the

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:32.369 
usually um actually because most of the
times<00:02:28.780> these<00:02:28.959> servers<00:02:29.489> don't<00:02:30.489> really<00:02:31.379> work

00:02:32.369 --> 00:02:32.379 
times these servers don't really work

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:34.979 
times these servers don't really work
that<00:02:32.680> well<00:02:32.859> at<00:02:33.700> times<00:02:34.000> it<00:02:34.390> just<00:02:34.450> depends<00:02:34.930> on

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
that well at times it just depends on

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:39.410 
that well at times it just depends on
what<00:02:35.140> the<00:02:35.200> server<00:02:35.530> actually<00:02:35.890> is<00:02:36.310> and<00:02:38.159> you<00:02:39.159> gain

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
what the server actually is and you gain

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.030 
what the server actually is and you gain
most<00:02:40.420> of<00:02:40.629> time<00:02:40.750> to<00:02:40.930> do<00:02:41.019> stuff<00:02:41.079> like<00:02:41.439> every<00:02:41.799> once

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
most of time to do stuff like every once

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.379 
most of time to do stuff like every once
awhile<00:02:42.189> you'll<00:02:42.489> find<00:02:42.730> are<00:02:42.879> actually<00:02:43.180> pretty

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:43.389 
awhile you'll find are actually pretty

00:02:43.389 --> 00:02:45.929 
awhile you'll find are actually pretty
good<00:02:43.629> server<00:02:43.870> like<00:02:44.170> the<00:02:44.319> server<00:02:44.560> at<00:02:45.430> first<00:02:45.730> I

00:02:45.929 --> 00:02:45.939 
good server like the server at first I

00:02:45.939 --> 00:02:47.670 
good server like the server at first I
just<00:02:45.969> did<00:02:46.510> it<00:02:46.629> because<00:02:46.659> it<00:02:46.959> was<00:02:47.109> a<00:02:47.200> part<00:02:47.500> of<00:02:47.560> the

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
just did it because it was a part of the

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:53.640 
just did it because it was a part of the
video<00:02:47.920> tutorial<00:02:48.519> and<00:02:48.870> yeah<00:02:50.730> but<00:02:51.730> also<00:02:52.530> yet<00:02:53.530> you

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
video tutorial and yeah but also yet you

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.379 
video tutorial and yeah but also yet you
guys<00:02:53.799> can<00:02:53.980> basically<00:02:54.159> do<00:02:54.489> whatever<00:02:54.639> mr.

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:55.389 
guys can basically do whatever mr.

00:02:55.389 --> 00:02:57.270 
guys can basically do whatever mr.
precise<00:02:55.689> unless<00:02:55.989> the<00:02:56.169> server<00:02:56.409> has<00:02:56.560> it<00:02:57.010> like

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
precise unless the server has it like

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.670 
precise unless the server has it like
clothes<00:02:57.669> or<00:02:57.939> something<00:02:58.060> I<00:02:58.510> haven't<00:02:59.500> getting

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
clothes or something I haven't getting

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.190 
clothes or something I haven't getting
some<00:02:59.829> lag<00:03:00.010> time<00:03:00.340> yes<00:03:01.030> while<00:03:01.480> though<00:03:01.840> I<00:03:01.870> hate

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
some lag time yes while though I hate

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.949 
some lag time yes while though I hate
this<00:03:02.650> server<00:03:03.280> but<00:03:04.090> I'm<00:03:04.329> just<00:03:04.629> doing<00:03:04.840> this<00:03:04.900> for

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 
this server but I'm just doing this for

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:08.069 
this server but I'm just doing this for
the<00:03:05.230> tutorial<00:03:05.409> purposes<00:03:05.950> and<00:03:06.659> usually<00:03:07.659> are

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:08.079 
the tutorial purposes and usually are

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:10.199 
the tutorial purposes and usually are
somewhere<00:03:08.530> around<00:03:08.650> there<00:03:08.919> that<00:03:09.099> works<00:03:09.459> there

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:10.209 
somewhere around there that works there

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:11.970 
somewhere around there that works there
you<00:03:10.389> find<00:03:10.510> a<00:03:10.629> warp<00:03:10.810> you<00:03:11.169> can<00:03:11.409> usually<00:03:11.590> either

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
you find a warp you can usually either

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.909 
you find a warp you can usually either
do<00:03:12.480> /warp<00:03:13.480> and<00:03:13.750> then<00:03:13.959> type<00:03:14.260> in<00:03:14.409> that<00:03:14.530> name<00:03:14.709> or

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:14.919 
do /warp and then type in that name or

00:03:14.919 --> 00:03:17.250 
do /warp and then type in that name or
sometimes<00:03:15.340> they'll<00:03:15.519> allow<00:03:15.790> you<00:03:15.849> to<00:03:16.180> click<00:03:17.049> it

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
sometimes they'll allow you to click it

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.250 
sometimes they'll allow you to click it
right<00:03:18.010> click<00:03:18.219> it<00:03:18.400> and<00:03:18.430> then<00:03:19.090> usually<00:03:19.719> you<00:03:20.109> can

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
right click it and then usually you can

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.399 
right click it and then usually you can
teleport<00:03:20.620> to<00:03:20.829> there<00:03:20.980> or<00:03:21.069> something<00:03:21.489> and

00:03:22.399 --> 00:03:22.409 
teleport to there or something and

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:25.830 
teleport to there or something and
there's<00:03:23.669> many<00:03:24.669> servers<00:03:24.940> out<00:03:25.090> there<00:03:25.150> but<00:03:25.629> only

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
there's many servers out there but only

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.289 
there's many servers out there but only
if<00:03:25.930> you<00:03:26.049> are<00:03:26.109> actually<00:03:26.440> really<00:03:27.220> good<00:03:27.340> and<00:03:27.669> I

00:03:28.289 --> 00:03:28.299 
if you are actually really good and I

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:30.210 
if you are actually really good and I
was<00:03:28.510> supposed<00:03:29.470> to<00:03:29.500> be<00:03:29.590> the<00:03:29.769> hunger<00:03:30.040> game

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
was supposed to be the hunger game

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.309 
was supposed to be the hunger game
server<00:03:30.549> when<00:03:31.000> the<00:03:31.419> only<00:03:31.810> thing<00:03:32.079> that<00:03:32.229> was

00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:32.319 
server when the only thing that was

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:35.369 
server when the only thing that was
playing<00:03:32.590> on<00:03:32.739> it<00:03:32.859> was<00:03:33.010> all<00:03:33.909> screwed<00:03:34.239> up<00:03:34.389> but

00:03:35.369 --> 00:03:35.379 
playing on it was all screwed up but

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:37.890
