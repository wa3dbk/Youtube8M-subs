recovery<00:00:05.790> series<00:00:06.060> it's<00:00:06.750> the<00:00:06.930> technique<00:00:07.319> i'm

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
recovery series it's the technique i'm

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.669 
recovery series it's the technique i'm
using<00:00:07.830> in<00:00:08.090> episode<00:00:09.090> 10<00:00:09.510> of<00:00:09.750> road<00:00:10.170> to<00:00:10.290> recovery

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
using in episode 10 of road to recovery

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:12.080 
using in episode 10 of road to recovery
i<00:00:10.860> think<00:00:11.160> i'll<00:00:11.280> probably<00:00:11.429> use<00:00:11.550> it<00:00:11.849> in<00:00:11.910> some

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
i think i'll probably use it in some

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.360 
i think i'll probably use it in some
others<00:00:12.360> as<00:00:12.509> well<00:00:12.660> so<00:00:13.049> if<00:00:13.320> i<00:00:13.500> do<00:00:13.559> then<00:00:14.130> you<00:00:14.250> know

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
others as well so if i do then you know

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:15.950 
others as well so if i do then you know
where<00:00:14.549> to<00:00:14.639> come<00:00:14.790> to<00:00:14.940> check<00:00:15.150> out<00:00:15.299> how<00:00:15.480> i'm<00:00:15.630> doing

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
where to come to check out how i'm doing

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.140 
where to come to check out how i'm doing

because that's what we did in the

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.349 
because that's what we did in the
episode<00:01:00.930> now<00:01:01.340> you<00:01:02.340> obviously<00:01:02.640> want<00:01:02.789> to<00:01:02.879> first

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
episode now you obviously want to first

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.149

Brazil<00:01:05.820> ceria<00:01:06.470> goalkeepers<00:01:08.479> mm-hmm<00:01:09.619> gold<00:01:10.619> and

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.270 
Brazil ceria goalkeepers mm-hmm gold and

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.690 
Brazil ceria goalkeepers mm-hmm gold and
it<00:01:12.270> doesn't<00:01:12.570> matter<00:01:12.720> what<00:01:12.900> formation<00:01:13.320> now<00:01:14.040> the

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
it doesn't matter what formation now the

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.450 
it doesn't matter what formation now the
first<00:01:14.880> thing<00:01:15.030> we<00:01:15.240> want<00:01:15.330> to<00:01:15.450> do<00:01:15.659> is<00:01:16.280> find<00:01:17.280> out

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
first thing we want to do is find out

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.789 
first thing we want to do is find out
what<00:01:18.030> his<00:01:18.299> lowest<00:01:18.930> buy<00:01:19.170> it<00:01:19.229> now<00:01:19.439> prices

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
what his lowest buy it now prices

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.760 
what his lowest buy it now prices
because<00:01:20.570> we<00:01:21.570> are<00:01:21.810> pretty<00:01:22.049> much<00:01:22.140> guaranteed<00:01:22.740> to

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
because we are pretty much guaranteed to

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.950 
because we are pretty much guaranteed to
sell<00:01:23.159> any<00:01:23.400> card<00:01:23.820> that<00:01:24.000> we<00:01:24.270> sell<00:01:24.479> at<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.689> lowest

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
sell any card that we sell at the lowest

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.719 
sell any card that we sell at the lowest
buy<00:01:25.110> it<00:01:25.170> now<00:01:25.350> if<00:01:25.590> it's<00:01:25.740> a<00:01:25.830> very<00:01:26.009> popular<00:01:26.189> card

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
buy it now if it's a very popular card

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.719 
buy it now if it's a very popular card
so<00:01:27.420> what<00:01:27.810> we'll<00:01:27.960> do<00:01:28.110> is<00:01:28.140> we'll<00:01:28.530> go<00:01:28.710> for<00:01:29.040> buy<00:01:29.670> it

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
so what we'll do is we'll go for buy it

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.420 
so what we'll do is we'll go for buy it
now<00:01:29.939> maximum<00:01:30.479> price<00:01:30.720> will<00:01:31.259> search<00:01:31.500> it<00:01:31.770> up<00:01:31.860> go

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
now maximum price will search it up go

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.950 
now maximum price will search it up go
up<00:01:32.610> to<00:01:32.820> a<00:01:32.850> think<00:01:33.360> that<00:01:33.570> his<00:01:33.750> bite<00:01:34.259> now<00:01:34.470> is<00:01:34.619> about

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
up to a think that his bite now is about

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.230 
up to a think that his bite now is about
3,500<00:01:36.960> so<00:01:37.290> if<00:01:37.350> we<00:01:37.470> go<00:01:37.619> for<00:01:37.770> 36<00:01:38.280> yeah<00:01:38.970> there's

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
3,500 so if we go for 36 yeah there's

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.480 
3,500 so if we go for 36 yeah there's
quite<00:01:39.299> a<00:01:39.479> few<00:01:39.540> 436<00:01:40.439> and<00:01:40.619> below<00:01:40.860> so<00:01:41.189> if<00:01:41.220> we<00:01:41.310> just

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
quite a few 436 and below so if we just

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.120 
quite a few 436 and below so if we just
drop<00:01:42.030> it<00:01:42.060> down<00:01:42.270> a<00:01:42.329> little<00:01:42.570> bit<00:01:42.780> so<00:01:43.530> we<00:01:43.950> can<00:01:43.979> see

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
drop it down a little bit so we can see

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.499

and<00:03:29.280> then<00:03:29.640> you<00:03:29.880> know<00:03:30.000> it's<00:03:30.180> quite<00:03:30.450> easy<00:03:30.480> to

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
and then you know it's quite easy to

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:33.380 
and then you know it's quite easy to
think<00:03:31.260> who<00:03:31.830> you'd<00:03:32.100> have<00:03:32.850> in<00:03:32.970> your<00:03:33.090> team

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
think who you'd have in your team

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:34.430 
think who you'd have in your team
obviously<00:03:33.630> you<00:03:33.989> don't<00:03:34.110> want<00:03:34.140> to<00:03:34.290> be<00:03:34.350> looking

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
obviously you don't want to be looking

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.020 
obviously you don't want to be looking
at<00:03:34.680> someone<00:03:34.920> who's<00:03:35.040> like<00:03:35.190> two<00:03:35.940> hundred

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
at someone who's like two hundred

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:37.880 
at someone who's like two hundred
thousand<00:03:36.600> coins<00:03:36.750> don't<00:03:37.140> don't<00:03:37.530> think<00:03:37.739> I'm

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
thousand coins don't don't think I'm

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:39.560 
thousand coins don't don't think I'm
saying<00:03:38.160> that<00:03:38.400> think<00:03:38.730> about<00:03:38.940> people<00:03:39.150> that<00:03:39.480> are

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:39.570 
saying that think about people that are

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:42.830 
saying that think about people that are
like<00:03:39.720> you<00:03:39.989> know<00:03:40.290> that<00:03:40.880> probably<00:03:41.880> max<00:03:42.269> like<00:03:42.510> 20

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
like you know that probably max like 20

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.500 
like you know that probably max like 20
30<00:03:43.080> k<00:03:43.470> I<00:03:43.709> mean<00:03:43.760> there<00:03:44.760> won't<00:03:44.880> be<00:03:45.060> as<00:03:45.150> many<00:03:45.269> of

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
30 k I mean there won't be as many of

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:46.820 
30 k I mean there won't be as many of
them<00:03:45.660> and<00:03:45.780> you<00:03:45.840> need<00:03:45.989> more<00:03:46.140> coins<00:03:46.440> to<00:03:46.560> do<00:03:46.650> those

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:46.830 
them and you need more coins to do those

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:47.870 
them and you need more coins to do those
players<00:03:47.070> but<00:03:47.250> there<00:03:47.370> are<00:03:47.489> some<00:03:47.670> that<00:03:47.820> are

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
players but there are some that are

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.640 
players but there are some that are
quite<00:03:48.150> cheap<00:03:48.480> that<00:03:48.660> you<00:03:48.780> can<00:03:48.930> quite<00:03:49.200> easily<00:03:49.230> do

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
quite cheap that you can quite easily do

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.830 
quite cheap that you can quite easily do
and<00:03:49.890> it's<00:03:50.370> quite<00:03:50.580> it's<00:03:50.730> as<00:03:51.209> simple<00:03:51.330> as<00:03:51.510> that<00:03:51.600> if

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
and it's quite it's as simple as that if

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.930 
and it's quite it's as simple as that if
I<00:03:51.900> went<00:03:52.049> on<00:03:52.200> to<00:03:52.350> Surrey<00:03:52.650> out<00:03:52.860> I'd<00:03:53.100> easily<00:03:53.670> think

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
I went on to Surrey out I'd easily think

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:55.670 
I went on to Surrey out I'd easily think
of<00:03:54.030> the<00:03:54.180> players<00:03:54.420> that<00:03:54.540> I<00:03:54.750> would<00:03:54.900> that<00:03:55.470> would

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
it's going to be Buffon Julio says are

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.680 
it's going to be Buffon Julio says are
who<00:04:01.680> I've<00:04:01.799> already<00:04:01.950> done<00:04:02.280> a<00:04:02.489> steak<00:04:03.060> limburg<00:04:03.450> or

who I've already done a steak limburg or

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:05.780 
who I've already done a steak limburg or
and<00:04:04.410> then<00:04:04.560> it<00:04:04.709> right<00:04:04.950> back<00:04:05.220> we'd<00:04:05.489> be<00:04:05.610> playing

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
and then it right back we'd be playing

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:08.660 
and then it right back we'd be playing
Mike<00:04:06.180> on<00:04:06.480> or<00:04:06.750> I<00:04:07.170> don't<00:04:07.620> know<00:04:07.799> some<00:04:08.220> I'm<00:04:08.459> not

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
Mike on or I don't know some I'm not

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:09.800 
Mike on or I don't know some I'm not
sure<00:04:08.820> there's<00:04:08.940> anyone<00:04:09.269> else<00:04:09.480> that<00:04:09.660> people

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
sure there's anyone else that people

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:11.630 
sure there's anyone else that people
would<00:04:10.049> choose<00:04:10.079> that<00:04:10.290> Michael<00:04:11.280> would<00:04:11.400> be<00:04:11.519> the

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 
would choose that Michael would be the

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.490 
would choose that Michael would be the
one<00:04:11.760> I<00:04:11.940> would<00:04:12.000> choose<00:04:12.120> then<00:04:12.870> it<00:04:13.019> sends<00:04:13.230> back

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
one I would choose then it sends back

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:17.180 
one I would choose then it sends back
probably<00:04:13.769> yeah<00:04:14.900> Chiellini<00:04:15.900> and<00:04:16.320> someone<00:04:17.010> else

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
probably yeah Chiellini and someone else

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:19.159 
probably yeah Chiellini and someone else
probably<00:04:17.459> be<00:04:17.700> Thiago<00:04:18.180> Silva<00:04:18.209> be<00:04:18.780> the<00:04:18.930> first

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:19.169 
probably be Thiago Silva be the first

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:20.630 
probably be Thiago Silva be the first
choice<00:04:19.500> but<00:04:19.530> of<00:04:19.890> it<00:04:20.010> he's<00:04:20.190> quite<00:04:20.400> expensive

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:20.640 
choice but of it he's quite expensive

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:23.150 
choice but of it he's quite expensive
for<00:04:20.880> so<00:04:21.180> maybe<00:04:21.390> not<00:04:21.600> and<00:04:21.870> then<00:04:22.680> at<00:04:22.800> left-back

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
for so maybe not and then at left-back

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.420 
for so maybe not and then at left-back
it<00:04:23.490> would<00:04:23.610> be<00:04:23.880> an<00:04:24.530> heart<00:04:25.530> with<00:04:25.710> an<00:04:25.860> entire<00:04:26.190> way

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
it would be an heart with an entire way

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:27.200 
it would be an heart with an entire way
it's

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
it's

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:28.610 
it's
simple<00:04:27.690> is<00:04:27.810> simple<00:04:28.110> stuff<00:04:28.289> like<00:04:28.350> that<00:04:28.470> and

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
simple is simple stuff like that and

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.650 
simple is simple stuff like that and
then<00:04:28.860> there's<00:04:29.100> people<00:04:29.220> like<00:04:29.479> lavezzi<00:04:30.479> up

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:30.660 
then there's people like lavezzi up

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:32.570 
then there's people like lavezzi up
front<00:04:30.990> you<00:04:31.289> know<00:04:31.410> he's<00:04:31.949> one<00:04:31.979> that<00:04:32.400> people

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
front you know he's one that people

front you know he's one that people
would<00:04:32.880> want<00:04:33.120> and<00:04:33.440> you<00:04:34.440> know<00:04:34.560> par<00:04:34.830> so<00:04:35.190> Robinho

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 
would want and you know par so Robinho

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.520 
would want and you know par so Robinho
they're<00:04:36.330> all<00:04:36.479> the<00:04:36.690> players<00:04:36.900> that<00:04:37.050> you<00:04:37.289> want<00:04:37.500> to

they're all the players that you want to
be<00:04:37.650> looking<00:04:37.800> at<00:04:38.099> so<00:04:38.610> all<00:04:38.729> you<00:04:38.789> have<00:04:38.880> to<00:04:39.000> do<00:04:39.210> is

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360 
be looking at so all you have to do is

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.900 
be looking at so all you have to do is
go<00:04:39.569> on<00:04:39.810> find<00:04:40.319> their<00:04:40.500> lowest<00:04:40.680> bite<00:04:41.009> now<00:04:41.220> then

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:41.910 
go on find their lowest bite now then

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:43.430 
go on find their lowest bite now then
take<00:04:42.210> off<00:04:42.419> a<00:04:42.479> little<00:04:42.720> bit<00:04:42.960> I'd<00:04:43.169> say<00:04:43.380> you

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:43.440 
take off a little bit I'd say you

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:46.300 
take off a little bit I'd say you
probably<00:04:43.830> want<00:04:44.099> to<00:04:44.190> make<00:04:44.340> about<00:04:44.669> like<00:04:45.509> between

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:46.310 
probably want to make about like between

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:50.330 
probably want to make about like between
50<00:04:47.310> and<00:04:47.340> I<00:04:47.759> know<00:04:48.660> fifteen<00:04:49.199> fifteen<00:04:50.009> twenty

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:50.340 
50 and I know fifteen fifteen twenty

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:51.980 
50 and I know fifteen fifteen twenty
percent<00:04:50.610> back<00:04:50.849> on<00:04:51.060> whatever<00:04:51.210> you're<00:04:51.479> spending

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:55.339 
percent back on whatever you're spending
and<00:04:52.759> so<00:04:53.759> you<00:04:53.819> want<00:04:54.090> to<00:04:54.180> search<00:04:54.389> for<00:04:54.419> fifty<00:04:54.930> 20s

00:04:55.339 --> 00:04:55.349 
and so you want to search for fifty 20s

00:04:55.349 --> 00:04:57.529 
and so you want to search for fifty 20s
percent<00:04:55.770> less<00:04:56.039> than<00:04:56.280> what<00:04:56.430> you're<00:04:56.699> hoping<00:04:57.330> for

that's<00:05:05.039> basically<00:05:05.550> the<00:05:05.639> technique<00:05:06.120> so<00:05:06.389> you

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:06.449 
that's basically the technique so you

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:09.020 
that's basically the technique so you
just<00:05:06.750> find<00:05:07.199> the<00:05:07.349> lowest<00:05:07.620> bite<00:05:07.889> now<00:05:08.070> bid<00:05:08.729> on<00:05:08.880> it

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:09.030 
just find the lowest bite now bid on it

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:11.360 
just find the lowest bite now bid on it
with<00:05:09.240> max<00:05:09.539> price<00:05:09.840> for<00:05:10.199> less<00:05:10.410> just<00:05:10.979> do<00:05:11.099> it<00:05:11.130> all

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:11.370 
with max price for less just do it all

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:12.740 
with max price for less just do it all
the<00:05:11.490> way<00:05:11.580> up<00:05:11.729> to<00:05:11.759> an<00:05:11.970> hour<00:05:12.090> and<00:05:12.270> you<00:05:12.449> can<00:05:12.599> do

the way up to an hour and you can do

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:14.810 
the way up to an hour and you can do
multiple<00:05:13.020> players<00:05:13.470> don't<00:05:13.889> know<00:05:14.039> nothing<00:05:14.520> stop
