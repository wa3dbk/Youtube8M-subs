00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:02.580 
hey guys it's Keith best in the Midwest

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:04.130 
hey guys it's Keith best in the Midwest
you're<00:00:03.389> here<00:00:03.570> you're<00:00:03.810> in<00:00:03.840> the<00:00:03.929> right<00:00:04.080> place

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.140 
you're here you're in the right place

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.880 
you're here you're in the right place
probably<00:00:05.779> been<00:00:06.779> working<00:00:07.109> with<00:00:07.200> electronics

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
probably been working with electronics

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.040 
probably been working with electronics
pretty<00:00:08.160> much<00:00:08.309> my<00:00:08.490> whole<00:00:08.700> life<00:00:08.730> it's<00:00:09.480> a<00:00:09.599> lot<00:00:09.840> of

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
pretty much my whole life it's a lot of

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.440 
pretty much my whole life it's a lot of
TVs<00:00:10.440> man<00:00:10.740> they're<00:00:11.519> not<00:00:11.700> stupid<00:00:11.969> they<00:00:12.300> know

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
TVs man they're not stupid they know

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.299 
TVs man they're not stupid they know
that<00:00:12.630> capacitors<00:00:13.290> only<00:00:13.590> last<00:00:13.830> for<00:00:14.130> two<00:00:14.280> years

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
that capacitors only last for two years

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.160 
that capacitors only last for two years
so<00:00:14.790> that's<00:00:14.910> how<00:00:15.120> long<00:00:15.330> the<00:00:15.509> warranty<00:00:15.960> works

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
so that's how long the warranty works

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.769 
so that's how long the warranty works
usually<00:00:16.590> a<00:00:16.650> bunch<00:00:16.740> of<00:00:16.920> capacitors<00:00:17.520> blown<00:00:17.779> on

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
usually a bunch of capacitors blown on

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.599 
usually a bunch of capacitors blown on
the<00:00:18.810> set<00:00:19.109> there's<00:00:19.289> only<00:00:19.439> IC<00:00:19.980> chip<00:00:20.340> that's

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
the set there's only IC chip that's

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.179 
the set there's only IC chip that's
blown<00:00:21.050> and<00:00:22.050> I'm<00:00:22.170> going<00:00:22.410> to<00:00:22.470> swap<00:00:22.800> out<00:00:22.980> the

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
blown and I'm going to swap out the

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.099 
blown and I'm going to swap out the
analog<00:00:23.640> power<00:00:23.910> board<00:00:24.269> on<00:00:24.390> it<00:00:24.539> it's<00:00:24.900> pretty

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
analog power board on it it's pretty

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:26.900 
analog power board on it it's pretty
simple<00:00:25.170> all<00:00:25.650> you<00:00:25.800> need<00:00:25.949> is<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:26.400> Philips

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
simple all you need is the Philips

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.089 
simple all you need is the Philips
screwdriver<00:00:27.390> and<00:00:27.689> set<00:00:27.869> of<00:00:27.960> pliers<00:00:28.140> and<00:00:28.650> the

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
screwdriver and set of pliers and the

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.500 
screwdriver and set of pliers and the
new<00:00:29.250> board<00:00:29.490> of<00:00:29.640> course<00:00:29.849> which<00:00:30.060> I'll<00:00:30.240> show<00:00:30.420> you

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
new board of course which I'll show you

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:31.400 
new board of course which I'll show you
where<00:00:30.779> I<00:00:30.810> got<00:00:31.080> it

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
where I got it

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.180 
where I got it
for<00:00:31.590> less<00:00:31.769> than<00:00:31.980> $25<00:00:32.940> total<00:00:33.860> and<00:00:34.860> that<00:00:34.920> does

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
for less than $25 total and that does

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.130 
for less than $25 total and that does
include<00:00:35.520> shipping<00:00:35.850> so<00:00:36.239> usually<00:00:36.750> I<00:00:36.780> would<00:00:36.989> just

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
include shipping so usually I would just

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.900 
include shipping so usually I would just
fix<00:00:37.440> that<00:00:37.530> one<00:00:37.860> component<00:00:38.250> and<00:00:38.610> be<00:00:38.700> done<00:00:38.850> with

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
fix that one component and be done with

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.990 
fix that one component and be done with
it<00:00:39.270> which<00:00:40.140> would<00:00:40.350> be<00:00:40.410> a<00:00:40.559> lot<00:00:40.800> more<00:00:41.070> harder<00:00:41.430> so

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
it which would be a lot more harder so

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.569 
it which would be a lot more harder so
this<00:00:42.149> is<00:00:42.300> much<00:00:42.540> simpler<00:00:43.410> in<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:44.190> end<00:00:44.370> much

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
this is much simpler in the end much

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.760 
this is much simpler in the end much
cheaper<00:00:45.090> and<00:00:45.300> you<00:00:45.360> can<00:00:46.170> do<00:00:46.320> it<00:00:46.410> too

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
cheaper and you can do it too

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.069 
cheaper and you can do it too
all<00:00:47.340> right<00:00:47.460> guys<00:00:47.670> we<00:00:47.850> got<00:00:47.969> to<00:00:48.090> send<00:00:48.450> your<00:00:48.629> tvs

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
all right guys we got to send your tvs

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.869 
all right guys we got to send your tvs
that<00:00:49.110> won't<00:00:49.500> come<00:00:49.710> on<00:00:49.739> you<00:00:50.190> try<00:00:50.399> to<00:00:50.460> turn<00:00:50.640> it<00:00:50.789> on

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
that won't come on you try to turn it on

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.630 
that won't come on you try to turn it on
and<00:00:51.120> it<00:00:51.210> will<00:00:51.870> turn<00:00:52.170> itself<00:00:52.350> off<00:00:52.800> it's<00:00:53.579> pretty

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
and it will turn itself off it's pretty

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.510 
and it will turn itself off it's pretty
common<00:00:54.860> we're<00:00:55.860> going<00:00:55.980> to<00:00:56.039> take<00:00:56.250> it<00:00:56.370> off<00:00:56.489> the

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
common we're going to take it off the

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.099 
common we're going to take it off the
wall<00:00:56.910> lay<00:00:57.360> it<00:00:57.510> face<00:00:58.050> down<00:00:58.109> on<00:00:59.660> something<00:01:00.660> soft

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
wall lay it face down on something soft

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:06.350 
wall lay it face down on something soft
and<00:01:01.910> take<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.059> back<00:01:03.270> panel<00:01:03.690> off<00:01:03.979> as<00:01:05.330> you<00:01:06.330> can

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
and take the back panel off as you can

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.770 
and take the back panel off as you can
see<00:01:06.630> I<00:01:06.659> got<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:06.990> back<00:01:07.170> panel<00:01:07.560> off<00:01:07.680> here<00:01:08.780> I'm

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
see I got the back panel off here I'm

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.600 
see I got the back panel off here I'm
looking<00:01:09.930> at<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.320> board<00:01:10.590> on<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:10.890> left<00:01:11.220> here

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
z5 VG is the one on this board or you

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.370 
z5 VG is the one on this board or you
could<00:01:51.000> look<00:01:51.090> at<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.360> side<00:01:51.600> panels<00:01:52.200> right

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
could look at the side panels right

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:58.010 
could look at the side panels right
there<00:01:55.880> here's<00:01:56.880> a<00:01:56.970> closer<00:01:57.210> look<00:01:57.509> at<00:01:57.660> that

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
there here's a closer look at that

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.390 
there here's a closer look at that
z5<00:01:58.560> VG<00:01:59.280> and<00:02:00.440> on<00:02:01.440> the<00:02:01.560> back<00:02:01.740> of<00:02:01.920> the<00:02:01.979> board<00:02:02.190> this

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:02.400 
z5 VG and on the back of the board this

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.600 
z5 VG and on the back of the board this
is<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.640> IC<00:02:03.450> chip<00:02:03.780> that<00:02:04.020> has<00:02:04.259> blown<00:02:04.650> it<00:02:04.680> really

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
is the IC chip that has blown it really

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.540 
is the IC chip that has blown it really
only<00:02:05.729> costs<00:02:06.210> a<00:02:06.300> dollar<00:02:06.509> but<00:02:06.920> the<00:02:07.920> manufacturer

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
only costs a dollar but the manufacturer

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.729 
only costs a dollar but the manufacturer
only<00:02:08.670> sells<00:02:09.030> it<00:02:09.179> in<00:02:09.209> spools<00:02:09.570> of<00:02:09.780> a<00:02:09.869> thousand<00:02:10.470> so

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
only sells it in spools of a thousand so

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.080 
only sells it in spools of a thousand so
I'm<00:02:11.009> just<00:02:11.220> going<00:02:11.370> to<00:02:11.430> go<00:02:11.550> ahead<00:02:11.640> and<00:02:11.820> replace

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
I'm just going to go ahead and replace

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.860 
I'm just going to go ahead and replace
the<00:02:12.120> whole<00:02:12.450> board<00:02:12.780> for<00:02:13.050> less<00:02:13.170> than<00:02:13.380> $25<00:02:14.870> pretty

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
the whole board for less than $25 pretty

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.130 
the whole board for less than $25 pretty
simple<00:02:16.290> fix<00:02:17.330> and<00:02:18.330> a<00:02:18.420> lot<00:02:18.630> easier<00:02:18.989> than

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
simple fix and a lot easier than

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.729 
simple fix and a lot easier than
desoldering<00:02:19.860> and<00:02:20.160> resolder<00:02:20.730> and<00:02:21.239> all<00:02:21.300> that

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:21.739 
desoldering and resolder and all that

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:24.290 
desoldering and resolder and all that
here's<00:02:22.739> the<00:02:22.920> new<00:02:23.130> part<00:02:23.340> I<00:02:23.520> ordered<00:02:23.850> you<00:02:24.120> can

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
here's the new part I ordered you can

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.740 
here's the new part I ordered you can
see<00:02:24.510> the<00:02:25.310> it's<00:02:26.310> a<00:02:26.400> BA<00:02:26.640> instead<00:02:27.270> of<00:02:27.360> an<00:02:27.480> AAA

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
see the it's a BA instead of an AAA

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.170 
see the it's a BA instead of an AAA
which<00:02:28.590> is<00:02:28.800> the<00:02:28.980> original<00:02:29.190> part<00:02:29.730> so<00:02:30.060> it's

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
which is the original part so it's

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.640 
which is the original part so it's
slightly<00:02:30.450> different<00:02:30.959> but<00:02:31.200> it<00:02:31.440> will

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
slightly different but it will

00:02:31.650 --> 00:06:13.140 
slightly different but it will
definitely<00:02:32.250> work

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:13.150 

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:16.330 

so<00:06:14.150> the<00:06:14.300> TV<00:06:14.539> works<00:06:14.990> as<00:06:15.259> you<00:06:15.440> can<00:06:15.680> see<00:06:15.919> it's<00:06:16.129> been

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:16.340 
so the TV works as you can see it's been

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:18.700 
so the TV works as you can see it's been
working<00:06:16.729> for<00:06:16.940> a<00:06:16.970> few<00:06:17.270> months<00:06:17.569> and<00:06:18.080> put<00:06:18.470> enough
