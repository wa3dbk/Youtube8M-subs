the cars keep skidding a bit and a

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:23.230 
the cars keep skidding a bit and a

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:26.260 
little bit cautious rounded corner
I'm<00:04:24.229> going<00:04:24.500> on<00:04:24.650> this<00:04:24.740> sector<00:04:25.160> using<00:04:26.060> the<00:04:26.120> best

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270 
I'm going on this sector using the best

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:27.730 
I'm going on this sector using the best
of<00:04:26.360> my<00:04:26.449> curves<00:04:26.720> because<00:04:27.110> obviously<00:04:27.349> the<00:04:27.590> last

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:27.740 
of my curves because obviously the last

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:30.339 
of my curves because obviously the last
straight<00:04:28.039> isn't<00:04:28.310> as<00:04:28.400> useful<00:04:28.550> because<00:04:29.539> the

00:04:30.339 --> 00:04:30.349 
straight isn't as useful because the

00:04:30.349 --> 00:04:32.469 
straight isn't as useful because the
base<00:04:30.800> actually<00:04:31.130> finish<00:04:31.400> is<00:04:31.610> so<00:04:32.270> got<00:04:32.389> the
