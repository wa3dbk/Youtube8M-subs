00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.670 
can lead to improvements and how we
understand<00:02:04.729> human<00:02:05.510> function<00:02:05.990> by<00:02:06.320> looking<00:02:06.590> at

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:06.680 
understand human function by looking at

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.820 
understand human function by looking at
animals<00:02:07.330> after<00:02:08.330> talking<00:02:08.869> to<00:02:09.019> and<00:02:09.200> we<00:02:09.470> can<00:02:09.619> see

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
animals after talking to and we can see

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.530 
animals after talking to and we can see
that<00:02:09.950> keeping<00:02:10.340> animals<00:02:10.580> in<00:02:10.789> captivity<00:02:10.909> is<00:02:11.510> a

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
that keeping animals in captivity is a

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.330 
that keeping animals in captivity is a
positive<00:02:12.080> thing<00:02:12.290> providing<00:02:13.100> that<00:02:13.220> the

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
positive thing providing that the

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:14.410 
positive thing providing that the
animals<00:02:13.730> are<00:02:13.880> living<00:02:14.000> in<00:02:14.209> the<00:02:14.270> right

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
animals are living in the right

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.140 
animals are living in the right
conditions<00:02:15.310> now<00:02:16.310> we<00:02:16.370> want<00:02:16.580> to<00:02:16.670> find

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
conditions now we want to find

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.869 
conditions now we want to find
if<00:02:17.360> you<00:02:17.840> the<00:02:18.170> general<00:02:18.470> public<00:02:18.860> are<00:02:19.129> for<00:02:19.640> or

00:02:19.869 --> 00:02:19.879 
if you the general public are for or

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:20.350 
if you the general public are for or
against

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
against

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.670 
against
animals<00:02:20.720> in<00:02:20.810> captivity<00:02:22.900> it<00:02:23.900> depends<00:02:24.409> what

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
animals in captivity it depends what

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.550 
animals in captivity it depends what
it's<00:02:24.830> for<00:02:25.010> I<00:02:25.310> suppose<00:02:26.269> so<00:02:26.840> if<00:02:27.080> they've<00:02:27.290> if

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
it's for I suppose so if they've if

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.350 
it's for I suppose so if they've if
there's<00:02:27.860> animals<00:02:28.280> that<00:02:28.610> are<00:02:28.760> nearly<00:02:29.120> dying

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
there's animals that are nearly dying

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.170 
there's animals that are nearly dying
out<00:02:29.599> and<00:02:29.780> they've<00:02:29.900> got<00:02:29.930> them<00:02:30.110> in<00:02:30.200> captivity<00:02:30.500> to

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
out and they've got them in captivity to

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
out and they've got them in captivity to
repopulate<00:02:32.440> the<00:02:33.440> wild<00:02:34.209> then<00:02:35.209> I<00:02:35.599> guess<00:02:36.049> it

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
repopulate the wild then I guess it

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.899 
repopulate the wild then I guess it
serves<00:02:36.349> purpose<00:02:36.860> but<00:02:37.129> it<00:02:37.519> doesn't<00:02:37.760> make<00:02:37.819> me

00:02:37.899 --> 00:02:37.909 
serves purpose but it doesn't make me

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:39.699 
serves purpose but it doesn't make me
feel<00:02:37.940> very<00:02:38.150> good<00:02:38.390> it<00:02:38.989> depends<00:02:39.319> how<00:02:39.470> will<00:02:39.620> I

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
feel very good it depends how will I

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:41.710 
feel very good it depends how will I
kept<00:02:39.980> like<00:02:40.549> I'm<00:02:40.730> not<00:02:40.940> fully<00:02:41.299> against<00:02:41.569> it

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
kept like I'm not fully against it

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:42.850 
kept like I'm not fully against it
otherwise<00:02:41.900> I<00:02:42.019> wouldn't<00:02:42.200> be<00:02:42.260> here

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
otherwise I wouldn't be here

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:44.380 
otherwise I wouldn't be here
tens<00:02:43.310> where<00:02:43.459> they've<00:02:43.579> come<00:02:43.610> from<00:02:43.790> as<00:02:44.239> well

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
tens where they've come from as well

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:48.399 
tens where they've come from as well
like<00:02:44.690> if<00:02:44.840> they<00:02:44.959> come<00:02:45.170> from<00:02:47.110> they<00:02:48.110> come<00:02:48.290> from

00:02:48.399 --> 00:02:48.409 
like if they come from they come from

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:50.740 
like if they come from they come from
somewhere<00:02:48.799> like<00:02:49.340> where<00:02:49.700> they're<00:02:50.629> being

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
somewhere like where they're being

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.390 
somewhere like where they're being
mistreated<00:02:51.230> then<00:02:51.470> I<00:02:51.530> guess<00:02:51.680> it's<00:02:51.890> alright<00:02:52.160> but

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
mistreated then I guess it's alright but

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.979 
mistreated then I guess it's alright but
otherwise<00:02:52.760> if<00:02:52.940> they<00:02:53.060> just<00:02:53.239> caught<00:02:53.540> from<00:02:53.780> their

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 
otherwise if they just caught from their

00:02:53.989 --> 00:03:00.550 
otherwise if they just caught from their
home<00:02:54.500> and<00:02:54.829> then<00:02:58.359> yes<00:02:59.359> I<00:02:59.599> am<00:02:59.750> of<00:03:00.079> course<00:03:00.109> they

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
home and then yes I am of course they

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.589 
home and then yes I am of course they
should<00:03:00.590> be<00:03:00.950> they<00:03:01.579> should<00:03:01.609> be<00:03:01.879> in<00:03:01.940> their<00:03:02.299> own

00:03:02.589 --> 00:03:02.599 
should be they should be in their own

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:07.000 
should be they should be in their own
inner<00:03:03.560> world<00:03:04.010> not<00:03:04.609> in<00:03:04.640> the<00:03:04.810> juzu<00:03:05.840> or<00:03:06.079> because

inner world not in the juzu or because

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.000 
inner world not in the juzu or because
obviously<00:03:07.599> we<00:03:08.599> don't<00:03:08.750> have<00:03:09.290> the<00:03:09.470> right<00:03:09.709> to

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
obviously we don't have the right to

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.190 
obviously we don't have the right to
