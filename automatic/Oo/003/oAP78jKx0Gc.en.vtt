from that more physics involved in the

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.430 
from that more physics involved in the
game<00:00:32.090> we<00:00:33.090> really<00:00:33.270> upgraded<00:00:33.750> the<00:00:33.899> graphics<00:00:34.290> for

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
game we really upgraded the graphics for

Empire three from empires 2 and that

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.720 
Empire three from empires 2 and that
really<00:00:37.020> paid<00:00:37.320> off<00:00:37.350> because<00:00:37.920> our<00:00:38.250> maps<00:00:38.520> are

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
really paid off because our maps are

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.330 
really paid off because our maps are
really<00:00:39.480> beautiful<00:00:39.690> looking<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:40.620> terrain<00:00:40.980> the

the<00:00:46.770> water<00:00:47.010> is<00:00:47.160> very<00:00:47.789> real<00:00:48.180> like<00:00:48.450> it's<00:00:48.750> really

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
the water is very real like it's really

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.260 
the water is very real like it's really
beautiful<00:00:49.620> and<00:00:50.190> we<00:00:50.340> have<00:00:50.489> procedural<00:00:51.030> grass

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
beautiful and we have procedural grass

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.209 
beautiful and we have procedural grass
in<00:00:51.600> there<00:00:51.840> which<00:00:52.050> gives<00:00:52.320> it<00:00:52.440> a<00:00:52.500> nice<00:00:52.620> realistic

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
in there which gives it a nice realistic

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.430 
in there which gives it a nice realistic
feel<00:00:53.489> I<00:00:53.850> really<00:00:54.449> love<00:00:54.629> playing<00:00:54.960> in<00:00:55.110> modern

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
feel I really love playing in modern

future weapons and effects beyond a
little<00:01:50.270> bit<00:01:50.390> I<00:01:50.420> think<00:01:50.510> what<00:01:50.870> most<00:01:51.260> people

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:51.620 
little bit I think what most people

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:53.170 
little bit I think what most people
would<00:01:51.770> consider<00:01:51.950> strict<00:01:52.610> historical

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:53.180 
would consider strict historical

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.870 
would consider strict historical
accuracy<00:01:53.480> but<00:01:54.410> it's<00:01:54.830> a<00:01:54.950> great<00:01:55.190> deal<00:01:55.430> of<00:01:55.460> fun<00:01:55.730> to

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
accuracy but it's a great deal of fun to

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.450 
accuracy but it's a great deal of fun to
play<00:01:56.090> and<00:01:56.360> it<00:01:56.480> it<00:01:56.810> lets<00:01:57.080> us<00:01:57.260> take<00:01:57.590> that<00:01:57.920> future

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
play and it it lets us take that future

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:08.609 
play and it it lets us take that future
gameplay<00:01:58.910> into<00:01:59.150> the<00:01:59.240> next<00:01:59.510> level

one of our core tenants when we started
designing<00:02:10.989> III<00:02:11.980> was<00:02:12.250> to<00:02:12.489> make<00:02:12.670> the<00:02:12.819> interface

00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:13.269 
designing III was to make the interface

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:15.449 
designing III was to make the interface
as<00:02:13.569> simple<00:02:14.140> and<00:02:14.230> clean<00:02:14.500> as<00:02:14.680> possible<00:02:14.709> and

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
as simple and clean as possible and

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:19.320 
as simple and clean as possible and
we've<00:02:16.420> worked<00:02:17.200> very<00:02:17.319> hard<00:02:17.620> to<00:02:18.159> try<00:02:18.430> to<00:02:18.459> keep

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
we've worked very hard to try to keep

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.600 
we've worked very hard to try to keep
all<00:02:19.629> of<00:02:19.659> the<00:02:20.019> gameplay<00:02:20.739> depth<00:02:21.040> that<00:02:21.220> we<00:02:21.340> could

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
all of the gameplay depth that we could

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.789 
all of the gameplay depth that we could
while<00:02:22.360> still<00:02:22.750> only<00:02:23.019> presenting<00:02:23.500> the<00:02:23.590> player

00:02:23.789 --> 00:02:23.799 
while still only presenting the player

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:25.589 
while still only presenting the player
with<00:02:24.040> the<00:02:24.069> options<00:02:24.549> that<00:02:24.970> they<00:02:25.000> need<00:02:25.360> at<00:02:25.510> the

00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:25.599 
with the options that they need at the

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:27.630 
with the options that they need at the
time<00:02:25.629> we<00:02:26.319> we<00:02:26.560> definitely<00:02:27.129> went<00:02:27.340> for<00:02:27.610> a

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
time we we definitely went for a

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.759 
time we we definitely went for a
simplified<00:02:28.180> resource<00:02:28.629> system<00:02:29.079> as<00:02:29.290> compared

simplified resource system as compared

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:32.009 
simplified resource system as compared
to<00:02:29.829> EE<00:02:30.069> too<00:02:30.519> but<00:02:30.909> we<00:02:31.030> made<00:02:31.209> sure<00:02:31.239> to<00:02:31.569> keep<00:02:31.720> all

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:32.019 
to EE too but we made sure to keep all

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:33.930 
to EE too but we made sure to keep all
of<00:02:32.049> the<00:02:32.440> gameplay<00:02:33.040> elements<00:02:33.519> of<00:02:33.610> resource

gathering<00:02:34.180> it<00:02:34.540> even<00:02:34.959> though<00:02:35.170> there's<00:02:35.709> a<00:02:35.769> lot

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
gathering it even though there's a lot

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:37.559
