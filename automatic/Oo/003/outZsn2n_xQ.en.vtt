shadows to my game and as you can see

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:55.529 
shadows to my game and as you can see
there<00:01:50.619> is<00:01:50.770> quite<00:01:51.310> a<00:01:51.640> weird<00:01:52.000> shadow<00:01:54.539> being

00:01:55.529 --> 00:01:55.539 
there is quite a weird shadow being

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
casted on the ground for no reason and

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:04.980 
casted on the ground for no reason and
apparently<00:02:00.359> no<00:02:01.359> source<00:02:01.810> let's<00:02:02.799> see<00:02:03.840> there<00:02:04.840> is

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
apparently no source let's see there is

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.630 
apparently no source let's see there is
no<00:02:05.350> source<00:02:05.979> for<00:02:06.399> this<00:02:06.609> shadow<00:02:08.190> this<00:02:09.190> shadow<00:02:09.550> is

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
no source for this shadow this shadow is

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
no source for this shadow this shadow is
glitched<00:02:10.149> it<00:02:11.050> is<00:02:11.290> caused<00:02:11.680> by<00:02:11.950> enabling

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
glitched it is caused by enabling

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.430 
glitched it is caused by enabling
Beedrill<00:02:13.660> and<00:02:13.930> shadows<00:02:14.500> to<00:02:14.860> your<00:02:15.070> game<00:02:16.440> it

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
Beedrill and shadows to your game it

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:23.370 
Beedrill and shadows to your game it
often<00:02:18.010> appears<00:02:18.190> in<00:02:19.060> game<00:02:20.490> from<00:02:21.490> about<00:02:21.910> 6<00:02:22.510> to<00:02:23.350> 8

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
often appears in game from about 6 to 8

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:28.220 
often appears in game from about 6 to 8
o'clock<00:02:24.310> in<00:02:24.520> the<00:02:24.610> evening

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.039 

he<00:02:29.230> most<00:02:29.530> likely<00:02:29.890> looks<00:02:30.670> like<00:02:31.000> this<00:02:31.390> straight

00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:32.049 
he most likely looks like this straight

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:35.360 
he most likely looks like this straight
lines<00:02:32.530> passing<00:02:33.159> through<00:02:33.370> the<00:02:33.730> ground

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
lines passing through the ground

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:40.770 
lines passing through the ground
straight<00:02:36.370> lines<00:02:36.730> of<00:02:37.000> shadows<00:02:38.340> and<00:02:39.340> it<00:02:40.209> is

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
straight lines of shadows and it is

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.020 
straight lines of shadows and it is
giving<00:02:41.110> quite<00:02:41.530> a<00:02:41.799> weird<00:02:42.220> and<00:02:42.670> a<00:02:42.760> pleasant

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
giving quite a weird and a pleasant

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.860 
giving quite a weird and a pleasant
effect<00:02:43.659> as<00:02:43.930> you<00:02:44.290> can<00:02:44.500> see<00:02:44.799> as<00:02:45.690> shadows<00:02:46.690> are

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
effect as you can see as shadows are

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:50.729 
effect as you can see as shadows are
moving<00:02:47.670> those<00:02:48.670> bug<00:02:49.000> shadows<00:02:49.510> also<00:02:49.810> are<00:02:50.260> moving

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 
moving those bug shadows also are moving

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:59.309 
moving those bug shadows also are moving
with<00:02:51.129> them<00:02:55.980> so<00:02:56.980> this<00:02:57.970> is<00:02:58.120> how<00:02:58.329> this<00:02:58.510> book<00:02:58.780> looks

00:02:59.309 --> 00:02:59.319 
with them so this is how this book looks

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:01.710 
with them so this is how this book looks
like<00:02:59.620> in<00:02:59.920> game<00:03:00.190> when<00:03:00.489> you<00:03:00.609> have<00:03:00.640> your<00:03:01.120> Beedrill

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
like in game when you have your Beedrill

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.699 
like in game when you have your Beedrill
and<00:03:01.930> shadows<00:03:02.440> enabled<00:03:03.780> now<00:03:04.780> I<00:03:04.810> will<00:03:05.260> do<00:03:05.500> a

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
and shadows enabled now I will do a

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:12.229 
and shadows enabled now I will do a
quick<00:03:06.010> comparison<00:03:08.670> be<00:03:09.670> travelin<00:03:10.389> shadows<00:03:11.190> is

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
quick comparison be travelin shadows is

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:25.890 
quick comparison be travelin shadows is
disabled<00:03:17.340> Beedrill<00:03:18.340> and<00:03:18.639> shadows<00:03:19.209> is<00:03:19.569> enabled

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.860 

and<00:03:25.989> once<00:03:26.799> again<00:03:27.010> beedrill<00:03:27.849> and<00:03:28.120> shadows<00:03:28.599> is

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
and once again beedrill and shadows is

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:35.009 
and once again beedrill and shadows is
disabled<00:03:31.379> so<00:03:32.379> in<00:03:32.650> conclusion<00:03:33.209> if<00:03:34.209> you<00:03:34.900> are

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:35.019 
disabled so in conclusion if you are

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:36.960 
disabled so in conclusion if you are
