00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
me see here on a bench mark here I'm

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.299 
me see here on a bench mark here I'm
actually<00:00:39.000> running<00:00:39.329> this<00:00:39.629> at<00:00:42.079> one<00:00:43.079> point<00:00:43.309> 836

gigahertz overclock I'm not all Evo 3ds

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.580 
gigahertz overclock I'm not all Evo 3ds
might<00:00:47.910> be<00:00:48.059> able<00:00:48.120> to<00:00:48.270> overclock<00:00:48.629> that<00:00:48.930> much<00:00:49.140> nor

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
might be able to overclock that much nor

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.189 
might be able to overclock that much nor
do<00:00:49.829> I<00:00:49.910> recommend<00:00:50.910> you<00:00:51.149> to<00:00:51.360> actually<00:00:51.539> run<00:00:51.899> it<00:00:52.050> at

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
do I recommend you to actually run it at

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.439 
do I recommend you to actually run it at
that<00:00:52.440> rate<00:00:52.649> unless<00:00:52.829> you've<00:00:53.219> connected<00:00:53.940> to

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
that rate unless you've connected to

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.790 
that rate unless you've connected to
your<00:00:54.930> USB<00:00:55.410> drive<00:00:55.649> or<00:00:56.340> USB<00:00:56.640> charger<00:00:57.449> and<00:00:57.809> you're

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
your USB drive or USB charger and you're

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.349 
your USB drive or USB charger and you're
playing<00:00:58.949> some<00:00:59.219> kind<00:00:59.340> of<00:00:59.430> 3d<00:00:59.820> games<00:01:00.059> that

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
playing some kind of 3d games that

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.810 
playing some kind of 3d games that
requires<00:01:00.960> every<00:01:01.379> bit<00:01:01.590> of<00:01:01.829> CPU<00:01:02.550> power

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
requires every bit of CPU power

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.030 
requires every bit of CPU power
otherwise<00:01:03.600> I<00:01:03.780> would<00:01:03.899> set<00:01:04.080> it<00:01:04.110> papi<00:01:04.439> just

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
otherwise I would set it papi just

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.560 
otherwise I would set it papi just
overclocked<00:01:05.519> it<00:01:05.700> just<00:01:05.909> a<00:01:06.000> little<00:01:06.030> bit<00:01:06.299> maybe

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
overclocked it just a little bit maybe

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.539 
overclocked it just a little bit maybe
1.4<00:01:07.290> 1.5<00:01:07.740> gigahertz<00:01:08.130> and<00:01:08.580> put<00:01:08.790> it<00:01:08.880> on<00:01:09.000> demand

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:10.549 
1.4 1.5 gigahertz and put it on demand

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:13.010 
1.4 1.5 gigahertz and put it on demand
that<00:01:11.549> way<00:01:11.700> you<00:01:11.760> get<00:01:12.000> very<00:01:12.420> good<00:01:12.630> battery<00:01:12.960> life

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
that way you get very good battery life

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.270 
that way you get very good battery life
out<00:01:14.010> of<00:01:14.070> it<00:01:14.840> these<00:01:15.840> are<00:01:16.020> only<00:01:16.200> for<00:01:16.619> benchmarks

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
out of it these are only for benchmarks

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.749 
out of it these are only for benchmarks
only<00:01:17.580> so<00:01:18.360> I<00:01:18.390> got<00:01:18.570> 29<00:01:19.080> 30<00:01:19.500> I<00:01:19.890> was<00:01:20.310> getting<00:01:20.430> near

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
only so I got 29 30 I was getting near

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.830 
only so I got 29 30 I was getting near
30<00:01:21.500> 530-600<00:01:22.500> earlier<00:01:22.860> um<00:01:23.100> so<00:01:24.060> those<00:01:24.509> scores

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
30 530-600 earlier um so those scores

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.730 
30 530-600 earlier um so those scores
were<00:01:25.049> really<00:01:25.380> good<00:01:26.960> and<00:01:27.960> I<00:01:28.439> got<00:01:28.619> it

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
were really good and I got it

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.920 
were really good and I got it
overclocked<00:01:29.220> and<00:01:29.970> for<00:01:30.240> those<00:01:30.329> of<00:01:30.390> you<00:01:30.600> who

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
overclocked and for those of you who

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.429 
overclocked and for those of you who
don't<00:01:31.229> know<00:01:31.549> how<00:01:32.549> to<00:01:32.579> install<00:01:33.060> it<00:01:33.119> I<00:01:33.659> made

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
don't know how to install it I made

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.679 
don't know how to install it I made
another<00:01:34.710> video<00:01:34.979> for<00:01:35.850> this<00:01:36.030> wrong<00:01:36.270> because<00:01:36.570> you

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
another video for this wrong because you

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.840 
another video for this wrong because you
have<00:01:36.810> to<00:01:36.990> format<00:01:37.650> it<00:01:37.710> as<00:01:37.979> extension<00:01:38.490> for<00:01:38.670> file

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
have to format it as extension for file

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.370 
have to format it as extension for file
system<00:01:39.240> you<00:01:39.360> can<00:01:39.479> do<00:01:39.600> it<00:01:39.689> without<00:01:39.840> doing<00:01:40.350> that

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
system you can do it without doing that

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.670 
system you can do it without doing that
but<00:01:40.680> then<00:01:40.860> it<00:01:41.009> will<00:01:41.549> be<00:01:41.700> a<00:01:41.729> lot<00:01:41.909> slower<00:01:42.150> um<00:01:42.680> but

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
but then it will be a lot slower um but

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.219 
but then it will be a lot slower um but
off<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:43.950> go<00:01:44.280> I<00:01:44.310> can<00:01:44.610> see<00:01:44.909> it's<00:01:45.060> it's<00:01:45.659> just<00:01:46.020> much

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
off the go I can see it's it's just much

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:47.840 
off the go I can see it's it's just much
faster<00:01:46.649> i<00:01:46.740> was<00:01:46.890> playing<00:01:47.340> with<00:01:47.430> all<00:01:47.729> these

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
faster i was playing with all these

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.630 
faster i was playing with all these
other<00:01:48.030> arms<00:01:48.659> and<00:01:48.810> then<00:01:48.930> i<00:01:49.049> find<00:01:49.320> that<00:01:49.530> i<00:01:49.770> came

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
other arms and then i find that i came

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.060 
other arms and then i find that i came
back<00:01:51.210> to<00:01:51.270> this<00:01:51.600> and<00:01:51.840> as<00:01:51.930> soon<00:01:52.110> as<00:01:52.320> i<00:01:52.530> fin<00:01:52.829> stall

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
back to this and as soon as i fin stall

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.940 
back to this and as soon as i fin stall
this<00:01:53.250> again<00:01:53.610> i<00:01:53.939> noticed<00:01:54.840> that<00:01:54.990> it's<00:01:55.170> so<00:01:55.530> much

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
this again i noticed that it's so much

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.600 
this again i noticed that it's so much
faster<00:01:57.350> this<00:01:58.350> lock<00:01:58.680> screen<00:01:58.979> is<00:01:59.100> kind<00:01:59.310> of<00:01:59.399> cool

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
faster this lock screen is kind of cool

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.080 
faster this lock screen is kind of cool
too<00:01:59.939> you've<00:02:00.509> got<00:02:00.719> the<00:02:01.460> kind<00:02:02.460> of<00:02:02.640> a<00:02:02.729> sense

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
too you've got the kind of a sense

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.230 
too you've got the kind of a sense

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.870

think<00:03:04.450> it's<00:03:04.570> a<00:03:04.690> bit<00:03:04.870> even<00:03:05.230> better<00:03:05.440> now<00:03:05.880> because

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
think it's a bit even better now because

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.820 
think it's a bit even better now because
it's<00:03:07.150> been<00:03:07.270> two<00:03:07.510> months<00:03:07.660> anyway<00:03:08.290> for<00:03:08.530> those<00:03:08.680> of
