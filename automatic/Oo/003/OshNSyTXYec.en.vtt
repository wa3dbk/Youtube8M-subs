I'm pretty sure I'm going to show you
how<00:00:47.700> to<00:00:47.760> change<00:00:48.000> it<00:00:48.120> so<00:00:48.330> here<00:00:48.420> we<00:00:48.510> go<00:00:48.630> it's<00:00:49.530> very

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
how to change it so here we go it's very

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.700 
how to change it so here we go it's very
cold<00:00:50.100> it's<00:00:51.000> frizzy<00:00:51.480> okay<00:00:52.320> so<00:00:52.380> we're<00:00:52.680> just

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
cold it's frizzy okay so we're just

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.640 
cold it's frizzy okay so we're just
gonna<00:00:53.000> start<00:00:54.000> off<00:00:54.180> by<00:00:54.210> opening<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.200> bonnet<00:00:55.320> so

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:55.650 
gonna start off by opening the bonnet so

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:01.720 
gonna start off by opening the bonnet so
in<00:00:55.770> this<00:00:55.890> car<00:00:58.910> there<00:00:59.910> we<00:01:00.000> go<00:01:00.090> and<00:01:00.330> then<00:01:00.570> open<00:01:01.260> it

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:01.730 
in this car there we go and then open it

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.700 
in this car there we go and then open it
okay<00:01:02.730> okay<00:01:03.720> so<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:04.019> first<00:01:04.140> thing<00:01:04.260> you<00:01:04.409> can<00:01:04.559> do

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
okay okay so the first thing you can do

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.190 
okay okay so the first thing you can do
is<00:01:04.860> take<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.280> engine<00:01:05.489> cover<00:01:05.820> off<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.960> bolts

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
is take the engine cover off the bolts

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.740 
is take the engine cover off the bolts
on<00:01:07.290> here<00:01:07.439> are<00:01:07.680> here<00:01:08.479> yeah

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
on here are here yeah

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:16.730 
on here are here yeah
and<00:01:14.360> right<00:01:15.360> so<00:01:15.630> you<00:01:15.689> need<00:01:16.049> an<00:01:16.200> 8<00:01:16.320> mil<00:01:16.530> socket

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
and right so you need an 8 mil socket

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.260 
and right so you need an 8 mil socket
might<00:01:17.100> different<00:01:17.430> some<00:01:17.580> cars<00:01:17.850> you<00:01:18.000> know

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
might different some cars you know

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.609 
might different some cars you know
probably<00:01:18.630> have<00:01:18.810> a<00:01:18.840> full<00:01:19.020> socket<00:01:19.380> set<00:01:19.530> I'm

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
probably have a full socket set I'm

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.200 
probably have a full socket set I'm
guessing<00:01:19.890> if<00:01:19.950> you're<00:01:20.039> gonna<00:01:20.130> do<00:01:20.340> in<00:01:20.460> this<00:01:20.579> so

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
guessing if you're gonna do in this so

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.489 
guessing if you're gonna do in this so
let's<00:01:21.359> check<00:01:21.570> out<00:01:21.719> these<00:01:21.840> bolts<00:01:22.229> and<00:01:22.350> we'll

00:01:22.489 --> 00:01:22.499 
let's check out these bolts and we'll

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:38.840 
let's check out these bolts and we'll
get<00:01:22.560> up<00:01:22.710> to<00:01:22.829> cook

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.830 

okay<00:01:39.850> next<00:01:40.030> thing<00:01:40.180> you<00:01:40.300> can<00:01:40.420> do<00:01:40.600> is<00:01:40.720> you're

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:13.479 
alright so this is what we got the
filter<00:03:11.450> is<00:03:11.659> in<00:03:11.810> there<00:03:12.079> and<00:03:12.290> you<00:03:13.069> just<00:03:13.190> step

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:13.489 
filter is in there and you just step

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:14.979 
filter is in there and you just step
back<00:03:13.639> a<00:03:13.700> bit<00:03:13.790> you<00:03:13.940> can<00:03:14.060> see<00:03:14.209> where<00:03:14.540> that<00:03:14.659> is<00:03:14.780> so

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:14.989 
back a bit you can see where that is so

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:18.150 
back a bit you can see where that is so
it's<00:03:15.769> in<00:03:15.889> there<00:03:16.099> and<00:03:16.280> this<00:03:16.400> foil<00:03:16.609> screw<00:03:16.879> is<00:03:16.970> one

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
it's in there and this foil screw is one

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.750 
it's in there and this foil screw is one
two<00:03:19.160> three<00:03:20.019> and<00:03:21.040> one<00:03:22.040> two<00:03:22.099> that<00:03:22.310> way

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
two three and one two that way

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.849 
two three and one two that way
I<00:03:22.790> should<00:03:23.510> seal<00:03:23.780> to<00:03:24.019> pull<00:03:24.199> that<00:03:24.319> back<00:03:24.530> now<00:03:24.709> when

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:24.859 
I should seal to pull that back now when

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:26.650 
I should seal to pull that back now when
you<00:03:24.919> can<00:03:25.069> get<00:03:25.190> to<00:03:25.370> it<00:03:25.459> so<00:03:26.180> now<00:03:26.299> it's<00:03:26.449> going<00:03:26.569> to

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660 
you can get to it so now it's going to

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:35.580 
you can get to it so now it's going to
tell

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.660 

so<00:03:36.590> now<00:03:36.710> you're<00:03:36.830> gonna<00:03:36.890> want<00:03:37.130> to<00:03:37.160> pull<00:03:37.310> it<00:03:37.430> off

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:45.380 
gonna have to get it around a couple of

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:46.930 
gonna have to get it around a couple of
like<00:03:45.680> as<00:03:45.830> the<00:03:45.950> wires<00:03:46.130> here<00:03:46.430> and<00:03:46.490> I'm<00:03:46.790> believing

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:46.940 
like as the wires here and I'm believing

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:48.160 
like as the wires here and I'm believing
that's<00:03:47.270> a<00:03:47.420> fuel<00:03:47.630> line

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.170 
that's a fuel line

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:50.290 
that's a fuel line
just<00:03:48.800> be<00:03:48.920> careful<00:03:49.100> but<00:03:49.460> you<00:03:49.490> just<00:03:49.790> if<00:03:50.060> you<00:03:50.120> give

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:50.300 
just be careful but you just if you give

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:52.720 
just be careful but you just if you give
it<00:03:50.360> a<00:03:50.390> good<00:03:50.510> tug<00:03:50.720> it<00:03:50.900> comes<00:03:51.110> out<00:03:51.350> an<00:03:52.250> X<00:03:52.520> will

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:52.730 
it a good tug it comes out an X will

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:56.230 
it a good tug it comes out an X will
will<00:03:53.330> show<00:03:53.480> you<00:03:53.570> change<00:03:53.870> it<00:03:54.490> this<00:03:55.490> is<00:03:55.760> your<00:03:56.120> own
