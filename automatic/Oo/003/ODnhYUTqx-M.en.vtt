the wonder why science segment I thought

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.629 
the wonder why science segment I thought
that<00:00:09.929> was<00:00:10.019> long<00:00:10.230> in<00:00:10.260> the<00:00:10.469> past<00:00:10.679> but<00:00:10.950> our<00:00:11.190> video

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
that was long in the past but our video

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
of camouflage that you can do an

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:25.820 
of camouflage that you can do an
experiment<00:01:24.750> at<00:01:25.020> home<00:01:25.049> if<00:01:25.350> you<00:01:25.439> take<00:01:25.650> some

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
experiment at home if you take some

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.620 
experiment at home if you take some
wallpaper<00:01:26.280> wrapping<00:01:26.790> paper<00:01:27.000> that's<00:01:27.240> pattern

put a thyroid silhouette or cut out on

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.609 
put a thyroid silhouette or cut out on
it<00:01:29.909> you<00:01:30.210> can<00:01:30.329> see<00:01:30.570> it<00:01:30.600> very<00:01:30.780> easily<00:01:31.079> but<00:01:31.409> if<00:01:31.530> you

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
it you can see it very easily but if you

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.310 
it you can see it very easily but if you
put<00:01:31.770> a<00:01:31.799> pattern<00:01:32.250> cut<00:01:32.820> out<00:01:32.970> on<00:01:33.180> it<00:01:33.360> it<00:01:33.600> wins<00:01:34.020> in

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
put a pattern cut out on it it wins in

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.380 
put a pattern cut out on it it wins in
just<00:01:34.890> like<00:01:35.009> these<00:01:35.159> stripes<00:01:35.549> how<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:36.210> animals

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
just like these stripes how the animals

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.999 
just like these stripes how the animals
blend<00:01:36.810> into<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.200> wild<00:01:37.500> so<00:01:37.650> it<00:01:37.770> could<00:01:37.920> it

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
blend into the wild so it could it

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.249 
blend into the wild so it could it
protects<00:01:38.369> themselves<00:01:39.000> in<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.540> wild<00:01:39.930> from

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
protects themselves in the wild from

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.719 
protects themselves in the wild from
predators<00:01:40.680> that's<00:01:41.100> right<00:01:41.250> right<00:01:41.460> and<00:01:41.579> like

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
predators that's right right and like

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.460 
predators that's right right and like
this<00:01:41.880> this<00:01:42.119> predator<00:01:42.540> helps<00:01:42.810> sneak<00:01:43.020> up<00:01:43.170> on<00:01:43.320> its

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
this this predator helps sneak up on its

Angela<00:01:54.540> tell<00:01:54.780> us<00:01:54.899> about<00:01:55.049> this<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.530> peacock

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
Angela tell us about this the peacock

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.139 
Angela tell us about this the peacock
doesn't<00:01:56.369> look<00:01:56.490> like<00:01:56.670> that's<00:01:56.850> a<00:01:57.000> lot<00:01:57.119> of

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
doesn't look like that's a lot of

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.389 
doesn't look like that's a lot of
camouflage<00:01:57.810> exam<00:01:58.350> no<00:01:58.829> that's<00:01:59.009> right<00:01:59.250> in<00:01:59.369> fact

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
camouflage exam no that's right in fact

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:00.800 
camouflage exam no that's right in fact
the<00:01:59.579> reason<00:01:59.729> the<00:01:59.939> peacocks<00:02:00.299> have<00:02:00.450> such<00:02:00.600> bright

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
the reason the peacocks have such bright

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.719 
the reason the peacocks have such bright
feathers<00:02:01.140> is<00:02:01.259> to<00:02:01.380> attract<00:02:01.740> a<00:02:01.890> mate<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.579> half

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
feathers is to attract a mate the half

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.520 
feathers is to attract a mate the half
of<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:02.939> feathers<00:02:03.270> actually<00:02:03.750> protect<00:02:04.259> them

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
of the feathers actually protect them

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.080 
of the feathers actually protect them
well<00:02:05.009> I<00:02:05.040> gave<00:02:05.100> you<00:02:05.369> a<00:02:05.399> goose<00:02:05.610> feather<00:02:05.880> if<00:02:06.000> you

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
well I gave you a goose feather if you

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.340 
well I gave you a goose feather if you
bring<00:02:06.299> that<00:02:06.450> up<00:02:06.509> and<00:02:06.810> when<00:02:06.930> you<00:02:07.020> notice<00:02:07.320> that

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
bring that up and when you notice that

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.680 
bring that up and when you notice that
water<00:02:07.649> birds<00:02:07.950> preen<00:02:08.220> themselves<00:02:08.450> they<00:02:09.450> spread

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
water birds preen themselves they spread

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.070 
water birds preen themselves they spread
oil<00:02:09.750> across<00:02:10.229> their<00:02:10.470> feathers

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
oil across their feathers

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.380 
oil across their feathers
look<00:02:11.800> at<00:02:11.890> how<00:02:12.010> the<00:02:12.070> water<00:02:12.280> beads<00:02:12.760> up<00:02:12.970> like<00:02:13.150> and

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
look at how the water beads up like and

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:14.730 
look at how the water beads up like and
that's<00:02:13.540> because<00:02:13.690> the<00:02:13.930> oil<00:02:13.960> in<00:02:14.320> their<00:02:14.440> feathers

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:14.740 
that's because the oil in their feathers

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:16.320 
that's because the oil in their feathers
that's<00:02:14.950> right<00:02:15.220> because<00:02:15.460> oil<00:02:15.730> and<00:02:16.000> water<00:02:16.150> do

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
that's right because oil and water do

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:17.880 
that's right because oil and water do
not<00:02:16.360> mix<00:02:16.510> it<00:02:16.930> helps<00:02:17.140> protect<00:02:17.320> the<00:02:17.530> feathers

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
not mix it helps protect the feathers

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:19.680 
not mix it helps protect the feathers
not<00:02:18.190> tell<00:02:18.430> us<00:02:18.460> about<00:02:18.670> detergents<00:02:19.420> and<00:02:19.480> things

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
not tell us about detergents and things

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:20.640 
not tell us about detergents and things
like<00:02:19.810> that<00:02:19.870> they<00:02:20.080> get<00:02:20.230> into<00:02:20.440> our<00:02:20.530> environment

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
like that they get into our environment

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.710 
like that they get into our environment
the<00:02:21.160> pollutants<00:02:21.580> so<00:02:22.030> that's<00:02:22.210> why<00:02:22.330> it<00:02:22.390> is<00:02:22.480> so

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
the pollutants so that's why it is so

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:23.910 
the pollutants so that's why it is so
critical<00:02:23.170> to<00:02:23.200> protect<00:02:23.590> our<00:02:23.710> environment

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
critical to protect our environment

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.380 
critical to protect our environment
because<00:02:24.280> when<00:02:24.370> you<00:02:24.460> have<00:02:24.550> like<00:02:24.610> oil<00:02:24.880> spills<00:02:25.270> or

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
because when you have like oil spills or

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.510 
because when you have like oil spills or
detergent<00:02:25.900> too<00:02:26.260> much<00:02:26.470> oil<00:02:26.680> can<00:02:27.100> actually<00:02:27.400> harm

detergent too much oil can actually harm
