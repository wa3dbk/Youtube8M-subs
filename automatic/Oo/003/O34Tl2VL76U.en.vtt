00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:24.290
 campaign for the use of smoke detectors 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:27.860
 to promote that you are engaged in the 

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:29.240
 preparations for it yes important for them too 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:31.670
 we go through that as soon as we go 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.110
 let's see but how is the idea 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:34.610
 arise 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.230
 well we've been doing this for years 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.540
 within the framework of the fire prevention week 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:41.120
 campaign to get people burned 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.410
 raise safety awareness and this 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.059
 years we actually chose the for 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.129
 for a slightly harder approach 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:47.690
 we want to try this year to people 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:49.550
 to point out that you have safety 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.770
 actually to a large extent themselves 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.110
 in your hand and is a smoke detector 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:56.510
 one of the components from last 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:58.969
 you have a container for a year 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.800
 markets represented by the region works 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:01.969
 that then not enough 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.430
 yes but it still appears 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:06.110
 research that, for example , 70% of 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.149
 the Dutch purple and red or still 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.369
 but has a smoke detector so we are there 

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:12.740
 actually still striving to 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:13.789
 also the last 30 percent over the 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.250
 draw a line 

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:17.090
 In addition, there are many others 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.970
 facilities that people can do themselves 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:22.580
 take fireproof live and 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.410
 be safety conscious 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.569
 today a roll of photos for the campaign 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:28.399
 how the ideas came about 

00:01:26.569 --> 00:01:30.740
 forward for this campaign 

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:33.050
 yes work together in a workgroup and well 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.959
 we will then decide for ourselves for a moment 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:37.550
 and then all kinds of ideas are added 

00:01:35.959 --> 00:01:38.330
 some are achievable sommers and not 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:39.349
 achievable 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.090
 and finally we have one 

00:01:39.349 --> 00:01:42.590
 campaign we thought of 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.280
 well that would be a good campaign 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.280
 can be 

00:01:45.349 --> 00:01:50.869
 the couch you sit on which one 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:52.459
 firemen brought home that house 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:54.380
 is that we got 

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:56.000
 fire brigade has that very many people 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.700
 what they can rely on 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.229
 and this band also comes from, for example 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.399
 the cycle 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:03.560
 you have told it like that 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:04.670
 one-off is that it is no longer usable 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.690
 is afterwards 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.619
 you will have it all neatly 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:08.619
 neatly told 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:14.300
 Yes 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:27.510
 build it took me 3 minutes 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:27.510
 In this case just three minutes 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:30.460
 the flames came out such that it 

00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:32.500
 is no longer responsible for longer 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:34.479
 stay 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:36.610
 the message it goes very fast 

00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:38.020
 I'm actually shocked 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:39.940
 yes that is actually what we also just 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:41.380
 to show the people at 

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:43.300
 fire you should assume that you have the 

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:45.460
 we depend on you for the first few minutes 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:47.590
 to make provisions yourself 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:49.090
 do you come out of your house on time and bring it 

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:50.350
 yourself in safety 

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:53.229
 the fire brigade is generally the 

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:54.820
 pasta seven eight minutes and that will come to you 

00:05:53.229 --> 00:05:55.630
 not just the combi in principle 

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:57.520
 don't save 

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:58.900
 take care of your own safety are one 

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:59.860
 number of facilities that you can do yourself 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:01.150
 to meet 

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:03.910
 take good care in the first place 

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:05.650
 working smoke detectors ensures that you 

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:06.550
 always keep the key in a fixed place 

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:07.840
 to commit 

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:10.120
 also ensures that you get a good one 

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:13.090
 Have a flight plan and make the 

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:13.990
 filter from your extractor hood and your laundry 

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:15.400
 dry and clean 

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:17.770
 those are basically a few basic tips 

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:19.150
 which we want to give 

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:22.210
 and we want to show how fast 

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:23.440
 fire goes because it struck me on that too 

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:25.419
 quite a long time before he 

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:27.639
 Smoke detector goes on and then you still have your own 

00:06:25.419 --> 00:06:29.919
 only 2 minutes and then you want outside 

00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:31.300
 yes we are basically going to be the 

00:06:29.919 --> 00:06:33.580
 from that at the moment here too 

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:35.110
 report is mainly he hangs real 

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:37.419
 the living room that you don't normally do 

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:39.310
 you normally hang it in the escape routes 

00:06:37.419 --> 00:06:41.500
 and then it takes a little longer for it 

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:43.840
 Be prepared to report an idea , but then you still have 

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:46.030
 sufficient time for the building to 

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:47.740
 flights via the stairs so if you have one 

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:48.460
 smoke detector on hang it then in the 

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:50.289
 escape routes 

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:52.750
 then you want warned in time is 

00:06:50.289 --> 00:06:54.729
 so little hope that you are still safe 

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:57.129
 come out 

00:06:54.729 --> 00:07:00.039
 make it now often with you houses 

00:06:57.129 --> 00:07:02.889
 without also mentioning yes it is still 

00:07:00.039 --> 00:07:04.900
 so that it appears that 30% of people are still 

00:07:02.889 --> 00:07:07.089
 no smoke detector and it is so 

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:08.919
 that there are a lot of people who smoke detector 

00:07:07.089 --> 00:07:11.050
 do not know who no longer works 

00:07:08.919 --> 00:07:14.229
 whether the battery has been removed and genuine 

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:18.419
 a smoke detector costs less than 25 euros and 

00:07:14.229 --> 00:07:18.419
 she saved lives that has really been proven
