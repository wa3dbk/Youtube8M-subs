00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.950 
the funnest gaming I've had in a long

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
this weekend so I thought hey why not

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.260 
this weekend so I thought hey why not
some<00:01:28.979> late<00:01:29.159> night<00:01:29.340> gaming<00:01:29.549> let's<00:01:29.880> have<00:01:30.060> some

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
some late night gaming let's have some

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.600 
some late night gaming let's have some
fun<00:01:30.479> and<00:01:30.689> it<00:01:31.079> was<00:01:31.259> super<00:01:31.799> exciting<00:01:32.369> to<00:01:32.490> get

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
fun and it was super exciting to get

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.280 
fun and it was super exciting to get
more<00:01:32.850> interactive<00:01:33.390> than<00:01:33.420> I<00:01:33.600> have<00:01:33.840> in<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.259> past
