00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
a dusclops and I used a similar set to

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.400 
a dusclops and I used a similar set to
the<00:00:15.059> one<00:00:15.240> that<00:00:15.450> I'm<00:00:15.599> going<00:00:15.780> to<00:00:15.870> be<00:00:16.020> using<00:00:16.320> in

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
the one that I'm going to be using in

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:17.779 
the one that I'm going to be using in
this<00:00:16.529> video<00:00:16.710> and<00:00:17.039> it<00:00:17.160> actually<00:00:17.340> turned<00:00:17.670> out

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
this video and it actually turned out

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.099 
this video and it actually turned out
really<00:00:18.000> really<00:00:18.420> awesome<00:00:20.449> it's<00:00:21.449> really<00:00:21.600> helped

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
really really awesome it's really helped

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.620 
really really awesome it's really helped
by<00:00:22.350> the<00:00:22.410> ever<00:00:22.740> light<00:00:22.949> as<00:00:23.100> well<00:00:23.340> but<00:00:24.150> to<00:00:24.449> make

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
by the ever light as well but to make

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.230 
by the ever light as well but to make
out<00:00:24.810> to<00:00:25.109> make<00:00:25.260> up<00:00:25.410> for<00:00:25.619> the<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:26.730> drop<00:00:27.000> in

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
out to make up for the the drop in

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.050 
out to make up for the the drop in
obviously<00:00:27.990> evolution<00:00:28.560> from<00:00:28.680> dusts<00:00:29.099> dusclops

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
obviously evolution from dusts dusclops

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.540 
obviously evolution from dusts dusclops
to<00:00:30.390> dust<00:00:30.630> sculptors<00:00:31.019> haven't<00:00:31.289> really<00:00:31.740> quite<00:00:32.520> a

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
to dust sculptors haven't really quite a

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.470 
to dust sculptors haven't really quite a
big<00:00:32.790> drop<00:00:33.030> in<00:00:33.170> stats<00:00:34.170> so<00:00:34.500> I<00:00:35.460> just<00:00:35.940> made<00:00:36.180> up<00:00:36.360> for

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
big drop in stats so I just made up for

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.180 
big drop in stats so I just made up for
that<00:00:36.540> a<00:00:36.660> little<00:00:36.960> bit<00:00:37.200> and<00:00:37.469> changed<00:00:38.070> a<00:00:38.160> couple

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
that a little bit and changed a couple

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.590 
that a little bit and changed a couple
of<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.670> moves<00:00:38.879> around<00:00:39.030> just<00:00:39.960> to<00:00:40.050> suit<00:00:40.350> it<00:00:41.600> its

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
of the moves around just to suit it its

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.420 
of the moves around just to suit it its
main<00:00:42.870> problem<00:00:43.200> was<00:00:43.350> it<00:00:43.469> didn't<00:00:43.739> have<00:00:43.920> a<00:00:43.950> lot<00:00:44.309> of

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
main problem was it didn't have a lot of

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.139 
main problem was it didn't have a lot of
health<00:00:44.700> so<00:00:45.030> and<00:00:45.739> I<00:00:46.739> wanted<00:00:47.280> to<00:00:47.370> do<00:00:47.489> something<00:00:47.850> a

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
health so and I wanted to do something a

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.020 
health so and I wanted to do something a
little<00:00:48.480> bit<00:00:48.719> different<00:00:49.110> than<00:00:49.410> my<00:00:50.340> dust<00:00:50.579> copses

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
little bit different than my dust copses

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.430 
little bit different than my dust copses
moves<00:00:51.270> but<00:00:51.480> I'll<00:00:51.840> probably<00:00:52.020> do<00:00:52.260> that<00:00:52.289> in

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
moves but I'll probably do that in

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.000 
moves but I'll probably do that in
another<00:00:52.649> video<00:00:52.920> in<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.250> future<00:00:53.399> but<00:00:54.270> anyway<00:00:54.660> I

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 
another video in the future but anyway I

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.130 
another video in the future but anyway I
just<00:00:56.010> needed<00:00:56.160> a<00:00:56.309> couple<00:00:56.489> of<00:00:56.610> traps<00:00:56.850> up<00:00:57.149> and<00:00:57.449> a

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
just needed a couple of traps up and a

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.010 
just needed a couple of traps up and a
little<00:00:58.980> a<00:00:59.670> little<00:01:00.420> thing<00:01:00.570> I<00:01:00.660> wanted<00:01:00.870> to<00:01:00.960> do

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
little a little thing I wanted to do

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.979 
little a little thing I wanted to do
with<00:01:01.289> my<00:01:01.500> smegal<00:01:02.129> just<00:01:02.399> we'll<00:01:03.270> get<00:01:03.690> to<00:01:03.809> that<00:01:03.840> in

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
with my smegal just we'll get to that in

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.190 
with my smegal just we'll get to that in
a<00:01:04.199> second<00:01:04.589> so<00:01:04.860> I<00:01:05.850> actually<00:01:06.570> thought<00:01:06.840> that<00:01:06.900> gay

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
a second so I actually thought that gay

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.359 
a second so I actually thought that gay
actually<00:01:07.560> thought<00:01:07.680> this<00:01:07.830> Ginga<00:01:08.130> would<00:01:08.250> have

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
actually thought this Ginga would have

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.550 
actually thought this Ginga would have
hidden<00:01:08.580> power<00:01:08.820> fire<00:01:09.119> but<00:01:09.479> it<00:01:09.600> didn't<00:01:09.900> so<00:01:10.110> I<00:01:10.140> am

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
hidden power fire but it didn't so I am

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.100 
hidden power fire but it didn't so I am
going<00:01:10.830> to<00:01:10.920> go<00:01:11.010> into<00:01:11.250> my<00:01:11.369> Rosa<00:01:11.790> raid<00:01:12.090> I<00:01:12.360> hear<00:01:12.960> it

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
going to go into my Rosa raid I hear it

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.440 
going to go into my Rosa raid I hear it
I<00:01:13.290> don't<00:01:13.320> really<00:01:13.710> need<00:01:13.920> to<00:01:14.100> set<00:01:14.310> up<00:01:14.450> anything

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
I don't really need to set up anything

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.330 
I don't really need to set up anything
he<00:01:15.570> I<00:01:15.600> just<00:01:15.659> want<00:01:16.020> to<00:01:16.110> see<00:01:16.530> what<00:01:16.740> moves<00:01:17.040> the

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
he I just want to see what moves the

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.450 
he I just want to see what moves the
Ginga<00:01:17.670> had<00:01:17.850> but<00:01:18.720> he<00:01:18.840> goes<00:01:18.990> into<00:01:19.200> his<00:01:19.439> pineco

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
Ginga had but he goes into his pineco

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.460 
Ginga had but he goes into his pineco
I'm<00:01:20.759> guessing<00:01:21.540> that<00:01:21.630> has<00:01:21.780> ever<00:01:21.990> like<00:01:22.200> because

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
I'm guessing that has ever like because

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.450 
I'm guessing that has ever like because
why<00:01:23.009> why<00:01:23.490> else<00:01:23.700> would<00:01:23.909> you<00:01:23.939> use<00:01:24.030> pineco<00:01:25.460> it's

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
why why else would you use pineco it's

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.999 
why why else would you use pineco it's
just<00:01:27.270> a<00:01:27.360> standard<00:01:27.750> battle<00:01:27.960> so<00:01:28.290> I<00:01:28.320> go<00:01:28.650> into<00:01:28.829> my

just a standard battle so I go into my

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.440 
just a standard battle so I go into my
Smeagol<00:01:29.400> here<00:01:29.549> because<00:01:29.850> I'm<00:01:30.090> pretty<00:01:30.329> sure

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
Smeagol here because I'm pretty sure

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:31.999 
Smeagol here because I'm pretty sure
he's<00:01:30.750> just<00:01:30.780> gonna<00:01:31.020> get<00:01:31.320> he's<00:01:31.500> gonna<00:01:31.650> go<00:01:31.829> for

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
he's just gonna get he's gonna go for

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.789 
he's just gonna get he's gonna go for
obviously<00:01:32.939> set<00:01:33.150> up<00:01:33.270> moves<00:01:33.509> and<00:01:33.840> I'm<00:01:34.140> confident

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.749 
got a few layers of spikes up I was
actually<00:01:49.619> going<00:01:49.890> to<00:01:50.009> go<00:01:50.070> for<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.310> block<00:01:50.520> first

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
actually going to go for the block first

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.389 
actually going to go for the block first
then<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.270> trick<00:01:51.509> but<00:01:51.689> I<00:01:51.750> wasn't<00:01:51.930> yeah<00:01:52.439> I'm<00:01:53.040> I

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
then the trick but I wasn't yeah I'm I

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:54.889 
then the trick but I wasn't yeah I'm I
messed<00:01:53.820> up<00:01:53.970> there<00:01:54.149> but<00:01:54.270> it's<00:01:54.390> all<00:01:54.540> good<00:01:54.750> it

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
messed up there but it's all good it

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.870 
messed up there but it's all good it
worked<00:01:55.140> out<00:01:55.320> for<00:01:55.439> the<00:01:55.530> best<00:01:55.680> anyway<00:01:56.040> so<00:01:56.549> now

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
worked out for the best anyway so now

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.380 
worked out for the best anyway so now
the<00:01:57.299> poncho<00:01:57.810> is<00:01:57.990> blocked<00:01:58.409> in<00:01:59.060> and<00:02:00.060> he's

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
the poncho is blocked in and he's

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.810 
the poncho is blocked in and he's
actually<00:02:00.860> he's<00:02:01.860> got<00:02:02.070> a<00:02:02.100> choice<00:02:02.310> pick<00:02:02.610> so<00:02:02.759> he

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
actually he's got a choice pick so he

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.719 
actually he's got a choice pick so he
can<00:02:02.969> only<00:02:03.090> use<00:02:03.270> spikes<00:02:04.229> to<00:02:04.649> I<00:02:05.009> switch<00:02:05.460> it<00:02:05.670> out

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
can only use spikes to I switch it out

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.150 
can only use spikes to I switch it out
so<00:02:06.000> I<00:02:06.270> can<00:02:06.600> basically<00:02:06.780> set<00:02:07.170> up<00:02:07.200> defend<00:02:07.799> orders

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
so I can basically set up defend orders

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.869 
so I can basically set up defend orders
like<00:02:08.819> +6<00:02:09.450> defend<00:02:10.170> orders<00:02:10.500> on<00:02:10.679> my<00:02:11.150> Smeagol<00:02:12.150> so

00:02:12.869 --> 00:02:12.879 
like +6 defend orders on my Smeagol so

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:15.300 
like +6 defend orders on my Smeagol so
this<00:02:13.599> will<00:02:13.719> be<00:02:13.810> perfect<00:02:14.019> little<00:02:14.409> just<00:02:15.189> the

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
this will be perfect little just the

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.030 
this will be perfect little just the
defensive<00:02:15.760> boost<00:02:16.030> for<00:02:16.299> my<00:02:16.560> my<00:02:17.560> desk<00:02:17.769> goal

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
defensive boost for my my desk goal

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.440 
defensive boost for my my desk goal
that's<00:02:18.249> really<00:02:18.519> all<00:02:18.609> I<00:02:18.639> needed<00:02:18.969> just<00:02:19.239> to<00:02:19.329> make

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
that's really all I needed just to make

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.319 
that's really all I needed just to make
up<00:02:19.599> for<00:02:19.810> the<00:02:19.930> the<00:02:20.889> fact<00:02:21.280> that<00:02:21.400> I'm<00:02:21.579> not<00:02:21.700> a<00:02:21.760> well

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:22.329 
up for the the fact that I'm not a well

00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:24.989 
up for the the fact that I'm not a well
not<00:02:22.629> a<00:02:22.659> dusclops<00:02:23.109> and<00:02:23.590> I<00:02:24.010> you<00:02:24.370> don't<00:02:24.549> have<00:02:24.790> to

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:26.859 
you don't have a very large amount of

00:02:26.859 --> 00:02:28.920 
you don't have a very large amount of
health<00:02:27.069> even<00:02:27.700> the<00:02:27.909> final<00:02:28.239> evolution<00:02:28.450> Dustin

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
health even the final evolution Dustin

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:30.449 
health even the final evolution Dustin
or<00:02:29.019> doesn't<00:02:29.260> have<00:02:29.349> a<00:02:29.439> large<00:02:29.920> amount<00:02:30.069> of<00:02:30.310> health

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
I'm going to be carrying the evolution

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:36.030 
I'm going to be carrying the evolution
stone<00:02:32.950> on<00:02:33.129> it<00:02:33.159> as<00:02:33.370> well<00:02:33.609> just<00:02:33.639> for<00:02:34.629> that<00:02:34.810> and<00:02:35.290> I

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
stone on it as well just for that and I

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.759 
stone on it as well just for that and I
I<00:02:37.030> wanted<00:02:37.510> to<00:02:37.599> make<00:02:37.750> use<00:02:37.959> of<00:02:37.989> the<00:02:38.200> move<00:02:38.379> curse

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:38.769 
I wanted to make use of the move curse

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:42.420 
I wanted to make use of the move curse
as<00:02:39.040> well<00:02:39.250> on<00:02:39.819> a<00:02:39.879> ghost<00:02:40.180> type<00:02:41.040> just<00:02:42.040> in<00:02:42.219> case

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
as well on a ghost type just in case

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.879 
as well on a ghost type just in case
that<00:02:42.790> I<00:02:43.090> come<00:02:43.329> across<00:02:43.569> anything<00:02:43.900> like<00:02:44.109> a<00:02:44.349> steel

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:44.889 
that I come across anything like a steel

00:02:44.889 --> 00:02:48.360 
that I come across anything like a steel
or<00:02:45.150> something<00:02:46.150> really<00:02:47.099> annoying<00:02:48.099> that<00:02:48.280> I

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
or something really annoying that I

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:53.250 
or something really annoying that I
could<00:02:48.549> use<00:02:49.000> that<00:02:49.889> against<00:02:50.889> it<00:02:51.930> but<00:02:52.930> yeah<00:02:53.049> it's

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
could use that against it but yeah it's

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.089 
could use that against it but yeah it's
just<00:02:53.319> a<00:02:53.669> random<00:02:54.669> little<00:02:54.879> idea<00:02:55.209> but<00:02:55.689> um<00:02:56.099> since

00:02:57.089 --> 00:02:57.099 
just a random little idea but um since

00:02:57.099 --> 00:02:58.770 
just a random little idea but um since
it<00:02:57.219> didn't<00:02:57.459> have<00:02:57.609> leftover<00:02:58.329> than<00:02:58.540> I<00:02:58.599> thought

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
it didn't have leftover than I thought

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.949 
it didn't have leftover than I thought
or<00:02:59.019> if<00:02:59.379> I<00:02:59.530> get<00:02:59.590> if<00:03:00.400> I<00:03:00.699> get<00:03:00.760> fretted<00:03:01.239> or<00:03:01.389> status

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 
or if I get if I get fretted or status

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:03.689 
or if I get if I get fretted or status
or<00:03:02.169> something<00:03:02.290> like<00:03:02.590> that<00:03:02.769> I<00:03:02.949> might<00:03:03.459> want<00:03:03.669> to
