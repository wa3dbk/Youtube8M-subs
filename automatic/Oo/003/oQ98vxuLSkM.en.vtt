that's<00:00:14.959> right

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:15.530 
that's right

Steve Jobs this PC is actually better
and<00:00:21.039> more<00:00:22.039> reliable<00:00:22.429> than<00:00:22.580> an<00:00:22.670> apple<00:00:22.910> which<00:00:23.029> is

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:23.119 
and more reliable than an apple which is

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:24.700 
and more reliable than an apple which is
absolutely<00:00:23.449> incredible<00:00:23.570> this<00:00:23.900> is<00:00:24.019> the<00:00:24.050> k2<00:00:24.320> 30

thousand so let's take a look at the
idea<00:00:45.079> Center<00:00:45.410> K<00:00:45.530> 230<00:00:45.920> and<00:00:46.129> see<00:00:46.370> what's<00:00:46.609> up<00:00:46.789> with

00:00:47.439 --> 00:00:47.449 
idea Center K 230 and see what's up with

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:49.479 
idea Center K 230 and see what's up with
very<00:00:47.780> very<00:00:48.050> nice<00:00:48.230> desktop<00:00:48.680> on<00:00:48.829> a<00:00:48.859> grey<00:00:49.129> budget

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:25.940 
do it's not a card it's on board but it

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.060 
do it's not a card it's on board but it
will<00:01:26.030> do<00:01:26.300> 1080p<00:01:26.690> they'll<00:01:27.200> do<00:01:27.320> 720p<00:01:27.560> videos

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.070 
will do 1080p they'll do 720p videos

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:29.170 
will do 1080p they'll do 720p videos
it'll<00:01:28.280> do<00:01:28.370> hi-def<00:01:28.670> stuff<00:01:28.850> it<00:01:28.940> looked<00:01:29.090> really

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.180 
it'll do hi-def stuff it looked really

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:30.760 
it'll do hi-def stuff it looked really
good<00:01:29.360> and<00:01:29.660> my<00:01:29.990> favorite<00:01:30.230> part<00:01:30.410> is<00:01:30.470> a<00:01:30.530> nice

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100 
probably have a Wi-Fi network and you're

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.960 
probably have a Wi-Fi network and you're
gonna<00:01:37.190> set<00:01:37.400> it<00:01:37.460> up<00:01:37.550> and<00:01:37.640> it's<00:01:37.760> gonna<00:01:37.880> work

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:37.970 
gonna set it up and it's gonna work

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:40.630 
gonna set it up and it's gonna work
great<00:01:38.540> now<00:01:39.470> let's<00:01:39.740> go<00:01:39.950> a<00:01:39.980> little<00:01:40.250> bit<00:01:40.430> to<00:01:40.550> the

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 
great now let's go a little bit to the

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.480 
great now let's go a little bit to the
inside<00:01:40.670> of<00:01:41.180> this<00:01:41.300> case<00:01:41.540> which<00:01:42.470> is<00:01:42.620> very<00:01:42.830> nice

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 
inside of this case which is very nice

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.760 
inside of this case which is very nice
I'll<00:01:44.240> show<00:01:44.450> you<00:01:44.510> what's<00:01:44.750> in<00:01:44.870> here<00:01:45.020> very<00:01:45.350> simple

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770

I'll show you what's in here very simple
I<00:01:45.800> think<00:01:45.950> that's<00:01:46.070> why<00:01:46.190> Lenovo<00:01:46.850> has<00:01:46.970> so<00:01:47.120> much

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
I think that's why Lenovo has so much

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.000 
I think that's why Lenovo has so much
