00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
relaxed hair and then my last tip that

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.860 
relaxed hair and then my last tip that
I'm<00:02:40.890> going<00:02:40.950> to<00:02:41.310> suggest<00:02:41.550> applies<00:02:42.150> to<00:02:42.390> both<00:02:42.570> and

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
I'm going to suggest applies to both and

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.110 
I'm going to suggest applies to both and
that<00:02:43.320> is<00:02:43.470> instead<00:02:43.830> of<00:02:44.010> depending<00:02:44.340> on<00:02:44.700> the<00:02:44.910> curl

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
that is instead of depending on the curl

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.120 
that is instead of depending on the curl
type<00:02:45.360> you<00:02:45.510> have<00:02:45.720> you<00:02:46.170> have<00:02:46.350> to<00:02:46.380> focus<00:02:46.860> on<00:02:47.010> the

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
type you have you have to focus on the

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.220 
type you have you have to focus on the
porosity<00:02:47.430> and<00:02:47.819> texture<00:02:48.239> of<00:02:48.269> your<00:02:48.480> hair<00:02:48.720> so

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
porosity and texture of your hair so

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.320 
porosity and texture of your hair so
when<00:02:49.410> I<00:02:49.530> refer<00:02:50.040> to<00:02:50.069> texture<00:02:50.670> texture<00:02:51.090> is<00:02:51.300> the

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
when I refer to texture texture is the

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.090 
when I refer to texture texture is the
feel<00:02:51.780> of<00:02:51.810> your<00:02:52.140> hair<00:02:52.200> it's<00:02:52.560> how<00:02:52.769> your<00:02:52.950> hair
