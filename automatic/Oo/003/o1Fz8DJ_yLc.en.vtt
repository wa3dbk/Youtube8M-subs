ladies and gentlemen that the question

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.410 
ladies and gentlemen that the question
is<00:02:40.990> no<00:02:41.260> longer<00:02:41.290> what<00:02:41.860> we<00:02:42.100> need<00:02:42.370> to<00:02:42.550> do<00:02:42.820> but<00:02:43.150> why

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
is no longer what we need to do but why

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.280 
is no longer what we need to do but why
it<00:02:43.480> isn't<00:02:43.930> happening<00:02:44.080> on<00:02:44.380> a<00:02:44.410> bigger<00:02:44.650> scale<00:02:46.290> the

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
it isn't happening on a bigger scale the

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.700 
it isn't happening on a bigger scale the
answer<00:02:47.710> is<00:02:47.890> actually<00:02:48.160> very<00:02:48.580> simple<00:02:49.500> for<00:02:50.500> as

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:50.710 
answer is actually very simple for as

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:52.500 
answer is actually very simple for as
long<00:02:50.890> as<00:02:51.040> it<00:02:51.130> remains<00:02:51.430> more<00:02:51.700> profitable<00:02:52.360> to

long as it remains more profitable to

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.320 
long as it remains more profitable to
produce<00:02:52.630> food<00:02:53.140> using<00:02:53.650> the<00:02:54.220> kind<00:02:54.550> of<00:02:54.700> intensive

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
the environment and to human health then

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:01.830 
the environment and to human health then
it<00:03:00.220> is<00:03:00.400> to<00:03:00.550> farm<00:03:00.790> in<00:03:00.910> a<00:03:01.000> sustainable<00:03:01.450> way

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
it is to farm in a sustainable way

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.800 
it is to farm in a sustainable way
then<00:03:02.830> producers<00:03:03.460> will<00:03:03.640> simply<00:03:04.060> go<00:03:04.240> on<00:03:04.390> doing

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
then producers will simply go on doing

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:06.930 
then producers will simply go on doing
that<00:03:05.230> because<00:03:06.010> they<00:03:06.130> have<00:03:06.370> to<00:03:06.400> follow<00:03:06.760> the

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690

food<00:04:31.020> we<00:04:31.259> consume<00:04:31.439> would<00:04:32.129> then<00:04:32.340> actually<00:04:32.969> be

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
food we consume would then actually be

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.929 
food we consume would then actually be
at<00:04:33.449> the<00:04:33.990> price<00:04:34.259> that<00:04:34.740> reflects<00:04:35.159> the<00:04:35.400> real<00:04:35.580> cost

00:04:35.929 --> 00:04:35.939 
at the price that reflects the real cost

00:04:35.939 --> 00:04:40.189 
at the price that reflects the real cost
of<00:04:36.120> production<00:04:37.280> so<00:04:38.280> it<00:04:39.240> is<00:04:39.449> my<00:04:39.629> sincere<00:04:40.110> hope

00:04:40.189 --> 00:04:40.199 
of production so it is my sincere hope

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:43.219 
of production so it is my sincere hope
that<00:04:41.039> you're<00:04:41.250> gathering<00:04:41.490> this<00:04:42.000> week<00:04:42.240> we'll

00:04:43.219 --> 00:04:43.229 
that you're gathering this week we'll

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:45.770 
that you're gathering this week we'll
begin<00:04:43.409> to<00:04:43.830> provide<00:04:44.009> some<00:04:44.520> direction<00:04:44.699> as<00:04:45.240> to

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:45.780 
begin to provide some direction as to

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:48.320 
begin to provide some direction as to
how<00:04:45.960> creating<00:04:46.439> such<00:04:46.740> circumstances<00:04:47.610> might<00:04:48.150> be

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:48.330 
how creating such circumstances might be

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:50.480 
how creating such circumstances might be
possible<00:04:48.840> in<00:04:49.379> order<00:04:49.590> that<00:04:49.770> we<00:04:50.009> can<00:04:50.039> stimulate

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:50.490 
possible in order that we can stimulate

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:53.089 
possible in order that we can stimulate
tangible<00:04:51.419> changes<00:04:51.900> in<00:04:52.229> the<00:04:52.710> way<00:04:52.830> we<00:04:52.860> approach

00:04:53.089 --> 00:04:53.099 
tangible changes in the way we approach

00:04:53.099 --> 00:04:56.240 
tangible changes in the way we approach
this<00:04:53.550> most<00:04:53.789> fundamental<00:04:54.449> questions<00:04:55.250> namely
