00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:05.589
 with data together before you start 

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:07.629
 our life at the request of many 

00:00:05.589 --> 00:00:11.440
 people what they did 

00:00:07.629 --> 00:00:16.650
 they asked me they asked me as in the 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:19.509
 video of the rada of such I do not have 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.669
 really after explaining the story 

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:23.439
 of kalise ice cream 

00:00:21.669 --> 00:00:25.449
 you really have a story behind us 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:27.550
 they have not become famous thanks to 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:28.869
 iniesta to say it in a way that does not 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:31.539
 be Spain because maybe they will not know 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:33.370
 last iniesta one of the players of 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:35.040
 the Spanish team and FC Barcelona 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:38.760
 little bit 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.650
 had an announcement of the famous phrase of 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.240
 galicia for all and well then to 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.650
 francesitos we go to the towns they 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.420
 made the graduates famous and they were 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:47.160
 famous but a lot of people when you 've seen 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.360
 an ice cream of this type I suppose 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.860
 who talk more about if he's in the 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.360
 new but good to me I like more the 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:55.530
 cone that anything else does not 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:57.000
 let's proceed to digital boxing let's 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.180
 to open one of the most who has 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.840
 melted because it's all pretty 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.840
 there really is a cake 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:09.009
 intentional enchantment of opens all 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:11.250
 then let's try everything 

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:11.250
 we can 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:19.659
 live live while the video 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:22.420
 then, as usual, it was 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:25.780
 destroying for which neither 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:27.820
 warped is a bit warped 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.600
 I do not know how to explain it 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.600
 a bite 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:42.400
 the outside is good we are good 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.400
 it's quite quite in the plenary 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:57.340
 monopoly to support a little bit until the 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:58.600
 supports a little bit already down and good here 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.210
 As you can see, it has chocolate and you can see that 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.890
 I had more more chocolate has gotten something 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:04.479
 in for bone and the price of ice cream 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:06.670
 be very good but a practice is 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:09.929
 We are going to try the 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.929
 chocolate of what qualities 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.680
 I 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.629
 maybe the video in which I feel more 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:21.129
 ridiculous 

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:24.940
 I'm analyzing a fucking shit that 

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:24.940
 you do not fuck with me anymore 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:37.660
 is basing good I recommend it 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.790
 quite our pretty pretty good 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:42.150
 vulgar yes that truth that the cornet 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.150
 is 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.160
 that happens basically because they are 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.290
 Freeze a little before taking it home 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.900
 and when thawing to be able to wet the 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:55.100
 cornet and softens but good is 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:57.520
 my fault I guess it's good enough 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:59.780
 good and the truth is quite curious 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:01.760
 this video pretty the school really 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.770
 will happen to posterity on my channel 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.150
 surely good nothing more likely is 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:07.810
 that we have in the next world 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.810
 approach
