to 250,000 and of course an overall
Australian<00:01:28.200> map<00:01:28.380> so<00:01:29.340> let's<00:01:29.549> go<00:01:29.700> somewhere<00:01:30.000> a

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
Australian map so let's go somewhere a

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.620 
Australian map so let's go somewhere a
little<00:01:30.329> bit<00:01:30.479> interesting<00:01:31.110> so<00:01:32.119> you<00:01:33.119> slide<00:01:33.390> down

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
little bit interesting so you slide down

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.060 
little bit interesting so you slide down
here<00:01:33.659> we've<00:01:33.960> got<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.290> high<00:01:34.770> country

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
here we've got the high country

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.289 
here we've got the high country
Victorian<00:01:36.060> East<00:01:36.360> sheet<00:01:36.860> let's<00:01:37.860> go<00:01:38.270> down<00:01:39.270> a

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
Victorian East sheet let's go down a

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.870 
Victorian East sheet let's go down a
little<00:01:39.479> bit<00:01:39.600> further<00:01:40.430> got<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.520> Simpson

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
little bit further got the Simpson

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.630 
little bit further got the Simpson
Desert<00:01:42.110> 500k<00:01:43.110> map<00:01:43.380> so<00:01:43.680> we<00:01:43.710> simply<00:01:44.130> tap<00:01:44.340> on<00:01:44.520> it

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
Desert 500k map so we simply tap on it

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:45.950 
Desert 500k map so we simply tap on it
and<00:01:44.820> it's<00:01:44.939> going<00:01:45.060> to<00:01:45.149> show<00:01:45.329> us<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.659> middle<00:01:45.780> of

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
and it's going to show us the middle of

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.080 
and it's going to show us the middle of
the<00:01:46.079> map<00:01:46.259> we<00:01:47.070> can<00:01:47.250> then<00:01:48.140> move<00:01:49.140> around<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.590> map

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
the map we can then move around the map

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.770 
the map we can then move around the map
we<00:01:51.090> can<00:01:51.470> zoom<00:01:52.470> out<00:01:52.880> we<00:01:53.880> continue<00:01:54.299> to<00:01:54.420> zoom<00:01:54.600> out

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
we can zoom out we continue to zoom out

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.510 
we can zoom out we continue to zoom out
it'll<00:01:55.110> actually<00:01:55.259> change<00:01:55.439> maps<00:01:55.979> to<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:56.310> next

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
it'll actually change maps to the next

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.680 
it'll actually change maps to the next
scale<00:01:56.960> or<00:01:57.960> we<00:01:58.200> can<00:01:58.350> zoom<00:01:58.530> back<00:01:58.560> in

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:01.690 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:03.820 

we<00:02:02.690> might<00:02:02.900> know<00:02:03.080> that<00:02:03.320> we<00:02:03.440> want<00:02:03.650> to<00:02:03.680> head<00:02:03.800> to

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:03.830 
we might know that we want to head to

it's going to put in a waypoint for us

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.440 
it's going to put in a waypoint for us
this<00:02:13.069> Waypoint<00:02:13.580> we<00:02:13.670> can<00:02:13.819> then<00:02:13.940> drag<00:02:14.150> around

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
this Waypoint we can then drag around

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.320 
this Waypoint we can then drag around
the<00:02:14.690> screen<00:02:14.959> by<00:02:14.990> using<00:02:15.319> the<00:02:15.530> little<00:02:15.650> green

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:19.459 
left/right up/down arrow and we can just

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:21.870 
left/right up/down arrow and we can just
place<00:02:19.670> it<00:02:19.700> there<00:02:20.060> nicely<00:02:20.510> on<00:02:20.600> Papa's<00:02:20.930> corner

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
change the name of the Waypoint that we

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.210 
change the name of the Waypoint that we
put<00:02:32.360> in<00:02:32.480> put<00:02:33.080> in<00:02:33.170> notes<00:02:33.410> all<00:02:33.709> sorts<00:02:34.010> of<00:02:34.070> extra

information<00:02:34.520> about<00:02:35.120> that<00:02:35.270> Waypoint<00:02:35.780> we<00:02:36.350> can

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
information about that Waypoint we can

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.500 
information about that Waypoint we can
also<00:02:36.590> delete<00:02:37.010> the<00:02:37.130> mark<00:02:37.340> down<00:02:37.520> the<00:02:37.580> bottom<00:02:37.940> so

driven over trip you could zoom in and

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:47.629 
driven over trip you could zoom in and
out<00:04:46.199> on<00:04:46.260> that<00:04:46.470> track<00:04:46.680> log<00:04:46.919> as<00:04:47.070> well<00:04:47.220> so<00:04:47.430> we<00:04:47.520> can

00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:47.639 
out on that track log as well so we can

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:49.909 
out on that track log as well so we can
get<00:04:47.729> a<00:04:47.760> little<00:04:47.910> bit<00:04:48.030> more<00:04:48.180> information<00:04:48.860> so<00:04:49.860> you

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360 
can see changes the map we're looking at

can see changes the map we're looking at
I<00:04:51.979> think<00:04:52.979> this<00:04:53.250> was<00:04:53.400> on<00:04:53.550> the<00:04:53.669> equipt<00:04:53.910> repop<00:04:54.360> -

00:04:54.469 --> 00:04:54.479 
I think this was on the equipt repop -

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:56.659 
I think this was on the equipt repop -
