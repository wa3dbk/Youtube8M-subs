00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:05.910
 I would like to explain to you today how 

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:08.519
 the ceramic motor coating of 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.559
 it works very well 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.630
 not an additive like here 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.549
 other products so it measures 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.070
 is a proper coating of the 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.960
 motors i want you to do that for a short time 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.769
 explain here we have a piston and 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:26.160
 here the piston rings of the piston goes in 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:29.010
 cylinder up and down between these 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.050
 So both share the piston and the 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.940
 cylinder walls my hand represents the 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:37.980
 Cylinders were created there was a friction 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.930
 that this friction is harmful to the 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.480
 engine is the engine lubricated 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:47.010
 it will be so oil is in the 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:49.710
 engine and this oil film between the 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:53.399
 piston and the cylinder wall is protects 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:55.079
 So the engine is in suspense now 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.440
 but so if they are in the morning or 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.960
 just start the engine for the first time 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:03.870
 is the oil down 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:05.460
 the piston goes up it is not 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.520
 lubrication is therefore no 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:11.280
 Oil between the piston and the cylinder 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.220
 land and that is the friction the view 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:17.520
 the engine breaks down one says today 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:20.729
 that a start of the engine corresponds 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.369
 about a ride from 1500 to 1800 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.560
 kilometer on the highway because he is there 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:28.140
 getting lubricated is so bad is so 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:31.350
 a so-called karl died when she did 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:34.740
 the very good ceramic coating in the 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.689
 just turn the engine oil on 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.780
 Allow the engine to run a bit with the oil 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:43.380
 some temperature has engine shut off and 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:46.439
 the whole dose in the engine oil cover again 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.750
 and then ten fifteen minutes 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.100
 drive so that misses the beautiful and 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.530
 the coating already at the beginning 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:56.040
 so if they work very well 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:59.640
 ceramic motor protection island inside 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.649
 the following happens the ceramics mixed 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.840
 yourself with the oil and start with the oil 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:06.030
 in the engine to wander that is we 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:09.379
 slower piston upwards from above 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:11.800
 Going down here is the oil as 

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:14.110
 protection film 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.240
 the film and e-mails the ceramists the 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.700
 ceramic is a polaris material 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:21.610
 that means that the ceramic particles 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:24.090
 to adhere to the metal and indeed 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.890
 here at the piston there are the piston rings 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:29.440
 The piston rings are so with a 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.660
 ceramic film coated and the 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.400
 Cylinder walls are also with 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.970
 a ceramic movie story that 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.650
 means and when you start the engine 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:42.270
 It can not be that metal anymore 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:45.790
 on the metal lubricant that was 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:50.350
 friction generated but between the 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:52.930
 Metal are two ceramic films it is 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:55.270
 a ceramic film on the piston ring 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.790
 and a ceramic film in the cylinder 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:03:00.610
 wall that means you have the problem of 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:02.320
 capitol not only eliminates that 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:05.320
 They eliminate this problem through the 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:07.360
 coating of very good but it 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:11.440
 also arises another rubbing motto 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:14.370
 The engine generates heat and heat 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:17.170
 friction when you feel the friction 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:20.709
 drive back as it is less friction 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:23.140
 Do you have more for the power over then 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:25.540
 the temperature will not work either 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:28.209
 change upwards but will become 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.950
 Changing back ceramics has a lot 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:32.400
 better friction coefficient than 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:34.720
 every metal and a much better one 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.810
 heat transfer sco efficient that 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:39.340
 means by the ceramic motor they have 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:39.940
 a permanent coating in yours 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.980
 engine 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:44.560
 this coating remains about 40 to 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:46.660
 50 thousand kilometers we recommend each 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.970
 year a new ceramic coating 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:50.470
 empathize 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:53.260
 even if she makes oil changes 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:55.390
 stick the ceramic to the metal because it yes 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:57.790
 as I said no additive that is in the oil 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:01.090
 but it is a coating off 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:03.370
 the metal of your engine when the friction 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:05.890
 going back all sorts of things are changing 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:07.870
 parameter less friction means more 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:10.510
 performance or means just with the 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:12.970
 same effort with the same with the 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:15.430
 a little the same 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:17.970
 To get performance so you have 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:20.979
 less fuel use less 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:23.800
 gasoline or less diesel the noise money 

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:25.449
 back the intervals of 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:28.720
 You can top up your services 

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:31.000
 driving there are very specific advantages 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:33.280
 additional benefits they all 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.650
 after your test of the product that is 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:38.440
 In any case, the main reason why 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:41.460
 every motor has a ceramic coating 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:45.639
 and would have to have a very good 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:47.889
 cold start is protected and just a lot 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:50.789
 there is less friction and a lot more 

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:50.789
 less wear
