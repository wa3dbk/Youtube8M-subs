tutorial on polymer clay as you can see
I<00:00:15.690> have<00:00:16.049> three<00:00:16.590> pieces<00:00:16.830> of<00:00:17.340> conditioned<00:00:18.029> light

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
I have three pieces of conditioned light

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.540 
I have three pieces of conditioned light
red<00:00:18.690> blue<00:00:18.990> and<00:00:19.020> green<00:00:19.350> we're<00:00:20.189> going<00:00:20.310> to<00:00:20.369> make

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
red blue and green we're going to make

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.240 
red blue and green we're going to make
some<00:00:20.939> very<00:00:21.300> chunky<00:00:21.660> beads<00:00:22.020> and<00:00:22.380> this<00:00:22.980> is<00:00:23.130> one

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
some very chunky beads and this is one

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.980 
some very chunky beads and this is one
of<00:00:23.279> the<00:00:23.430> easiest<00:00:23.850> things<00:00:24.000> you<00:00:24.269> can<00:00:24.480> do<00:00:24.630> take

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
of the easiest things you can do take

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.630 
of the easiest things you can do take
your<00:00:25.140> tissue<00:00:25.350> blade<00:00:25.710> and<00:00:26.960> just<00:00:27.960> cut<00:00:28.640> this

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
your tissue blade and just cut this

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.310 
your tissue blade and just cut this
isn't<00:00:29.910> already<00:00:30.060> marbled<00:00:30.570> piece<00:00:30.840> this<00:00:31.109> green

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
isn't already marbled piece this green

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.530 
isn't already marbled piece this green
piece<00:00:31.529> here<00:00:31.800> it<00:00:31.920> marbled<00:00:32.309> it<00:00:32.399> with<00:00:32.610> yellow<00:00:33.360> and

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
piece here it marbled it with yellow and

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.100 
piece here it marbled it with yellow and
you'll<00:00:34.380> see<00:00:34.530> how<00:00:34.620> to<00:00:34.649> do<00:00:34.860> that<00:00:34.890> in<00:00:35.130> a<00:00:35.160> minute<00:00:36.110> so

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
you'll see how to do that in a minute so

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.569 
you'll see how to do that in a minute so
we're<00:00:37.200> just<00:00:37.230> going<00:00:37.530> to<00:00:37.559> cut<00:00:38.160> these<00:00:38.340> pieces

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
we're just going to cut these pieces

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.139 
we're just going to cut these pieces
into<00:00:39.570> chunks<00:00:40.160> make<00:00:41.160> sure<00:00:41.340> you<00:00:41.489> have<00:00:41.730> a<00:00:41.760> good

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
into chunks make sure you have a good

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.600 
into chunks make sure you have a good
work<00:00:42.420> surface<00:00:42.930> I<00:00:43.110> have<00:00:43.350> this<00:00:43.559> is<00:00:43.770> a<00:00:43.920> mat<00:00:44.219> for

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
work surface I have this is a mat for

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.049 
work surface I have this is a mat for
polymer<00:00:45.059> clay<00:00:45.320> but<00:00:46.320> you<00:00:46.680> can<00:00:46.920> I<00:00:47.250> would

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
polymer clay but you can I would

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.790 
polymer clay but you can I would
recommend<00:00:48.450> you<00:00:48.600> get<00:00:48.780> one<00:00:48.809> if<00:00:49.230> you<00:00:49.590> want<00:00:49.739> to

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
recommend you get one if you want to

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.410 
recommend you get one if you want to
keep<00:00:49.950> messing<00:00:50.160> with<00:00:50.399> polymer<00:00:50.879> clay<00:00:50.910> so<00:00:51.329> we've

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
keep messing with polymer clay so we've

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.610 
keep messing with polymer clay so we've
got<00:00:51.539> all<00:00:51.629> these<00:00:51.780> cut<00:00:52.170> into<00:00:52.379> little<00:00:52.500> chunks

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
got all these cut into little chunks

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.220 
got all these cut into little chunks
make<00:00:53.190> sure<00:00:53.370> they're<00:00:53.550> separated<00:00:54.120> now<00:00:54.570> normally

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
make sure they're separated now normally

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.799 
make sure they're separated now normally
I<00:00:55.440> would<00:00:55.500> use<00:00:56.160> a<00:00:56.190> pasta<00:00:56.789> machine<00:00:56.910> for<00:00:57.300> this<00:00:57.480> but

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
I would use a pasta machine for this but

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.380 
I would use a pasta machine for this but
since<00:00:58.170> this<00:00:58.379> is<00:00:58.559> a<00:00:58.680> tutorial<00:00:59.070> for<00:00:59.579> beginners<00:01:00.149> I

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
since this is a tutorial for beginners I

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.290 
since this is a tutorial for beginners I
am<00:01:00.960> assuming<00:01:01.289> what<00:01:01.800> you<00:01:02.190> don't<00:01:02.609> have<00:01:02.879> a<00:01:02.910> pasta

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
am assuming what you don't have a pasta

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.870 
am assuming what you don't have a pasta
machine<00:01:03.420> yet<00:01:03.809> so<00:01:04.229> that's<00:01:04.619> why<00:01:04.920> I<00:01:05.339> am<00:01:05.850> using

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
machine yet so that's why I am using

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.940 
machine yet so that's why I am using
this<00:01:06.210> acrylic<00:01:06.990> roller<00:01:07.140> that<00:01:07.530> actually

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
this acrylic roller that actually

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.880 
this acrylic roller that actually
belongs<00:01:08.189> to<00:01:08.310> my<00:01:08.490> stepkids<00:01:08.810> and<00:01:09.810> I<00:01:10.470> stole<00:01:10.740> it

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
belongs to my stepkids and I stole it

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.609 
belongs to my stepkids and I stole it
firm<00:01:11.130> in<00:01:11.310> it<00:01:11.900> just<00:01:12.900> get<00:01:13.080> these<00:01:13.229> chucks

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
firm in it just get these chucks

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.920 
firm in it just get these chucks
separated<00:01:14.189> in<00:01:14.340> here<00:01:14.610> too<00:01:17.630> so<00:01:18.630> we're<00:01:18.750> going<00:01:18.840> to

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
separated in here too so we're going to

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.219 
separated in here too so we're going to
take<00:01:19.140> all<00:01:19.290> these<00:01:19.439> or<00:01:20.009> just<00:01:20.100> got<00:01:20.310> out<00:01:20.430> kind<00:01:20.759> of

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:21.229 
take all these or just got out kind of

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:27.980 
take all these or just got out kind of
smoosh<00:01:22.229> them<00:01:23.180> just<00:01:24.180> like<00:01:24.299> that<00:01:26.810> just<00:01:27.810> going<00:01:27.930> to

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
smoosh them just like that just going to

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.410 
smoosh them just like that just going to
smush<00:01:28.409> them<00:01:28.560> together

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.420 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.860 

and<00:01:32.260> kind<00:01:32.470> of<00:01:32.560> roll<00:01:32.770> it<00:01:32.920> in<00:01:33.040> a<00:01:33.100> very<00:01:33.310> crude<00:01:34.270> log

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:34.870 
and kind of roll it in a very crude log

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:36.620 
and kind of roll it in a very crude log
doesn't<00:01:35.410> look<00:01:35.530> very<00:01:35.680> pretty<00:01:35.860> yet

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
doesn't look very pretty yet

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:49.170 
doesn't look very pretty yet
okay<00:01:37.630> look<00:01:39.810> cut<00:01:40.810> those<00:01:41.020> into<00:01:41.320> pieces<00:01:48.180> we're

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:49.180 
okay look cut those into pieces we're

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.380 
okay look cut those into pieces we're
going<00:01:49.330> to<00:01:49.390> take<00:01:49.570> the<00:01:49.690> pieces<00:01:49.900> and<00:01:51.240> we're<00:01:52.240> gonna

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390 
going to take the pieces and we're gonna

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:59.550 
going to take the pieces and we're gonna
smush<00:01:53.050> it<00:01:53.080> together<00:01:53.470> again<00:01:58.290> now<00:01:59.290> we're<00:01:59.470> going

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 
smush it together again now we're going

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.190 
smush it together again now we're going
to<00:01:59.620> roll<00:01:59.950> that<00:02:00.540> so<00:02:01.540> now<00:02:01.660> what<00:02:01.810> you<00:02:01.900> want<00:02:01.930> to<00:02:02.050> do

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
to roll that so now what you want to do

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.450 
to roll that so now what you want to do
is<00:02:02.320> you<00:02:02.440> just<00:02:02.620> want<00:02:02.770> to<00:02:02.800> kind<00:02:02.920> of<00:02:03.040> roll<00:02:03.220> it<00:02:03.340> out

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.460 
is you just want to kind of roll it out

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.520 
is you just want to kind of roll it out
in<00:02:03.640> a<00:02:03.700> crude<00:02:03.940> log<00:02:04.180> and<00:02:04.630> then<00:02:05.050> you<00:02:05.140> want<00:02:05.290> to<00:02:05.320> take

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 
in a crude log and then you want to take

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.680 
in a crude log and then you want to take
your<00:02:05.650> roller<00:02:05.830> or<00:02:06.100> your<00:02:06.250> pasta<00:02:06.610> machine<00:02:06.910> you

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:07.690 
your roller or your pasta machine you

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.020 
your roller or your pasta machine you
just<00:02:07.810> want<00:02:07.960> to<00:02:08.020> roll<00:02:08.170> it<00:02:08.350> out<00:02:09.000> keep<00:02:10.000> your

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
just want to roll it out keep your

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.160 
just want to roll it out keep your
pressure<00:02:10.869> as<00:02:11.250> even<00:02:12.250> as<00:02:12.580> possible<00:02:12.720> which<00:02:13.720> I<00:02:13.930> am

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
pressure as even as possible which I am

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.729 
pressure as even as possible which I am
very<00:02:14.200> clearly<00:02:14.920> terrible<00:02:15.850> at<00:02:16.000> doing<00:02:16.530> never<00:02:17.530> was

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:17.739 
very clearly terrible at doing never was

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:22.229 
very clearly terrible at doing never was
very<00:02:17.830> good<00:02:18.160> at<00:02:18.250> that<00:02:20.670> so<00:02:21.670> we're<00:02:21.910> just<00:02:21.940> going<00:02:22.180> to

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:22.239 
very good at that so we're just going to

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:24.300 
very good at that so we're just going to
roll<00:02:22.480> this<00:02:22.630> out<00:02:22.780> and<00:02:22.989> see<00:02:23.800> if<00:02:23.860> we<00:02:23.950> like<00:02:23.980> what

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310

as possible so I'm going to trim these

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.210 
as possible so I'm going to trim these
ends<00:02:52.930> off<00:02:53.049> so<00:02:53.290> I<00:02:53.320> don't<00:02:53.500> have<00:02:53.620> to<00:02:53.769> mess<00:02:53.980> with

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
ends off so I don't have to mess with

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.740 
ends off so I don't have to mess with
the<00:02:54.910> thinner<00:02:55.150> ends<00:02:55.630> there<00:02:57.239> I'm<00:02:58.239> going<00:02:58.390> to<00:02:58.480> set

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
the thinner ends there I'm going to set

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.110 
the thinner ends there I'm going to set
this<00:02:58.900> aside<00:02:59.080> for<00:02:59.530> scrap<00:02:59.799> clay<00:03:00.070> and<00:03:01.000> we're

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
this aside for scrap clay and we're

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.180 
this aside for scrap clay and we're
going<00:03:01.390> to<00:03:01.540> take<00:03:01.780> a<00:03:01.989> cookie<00:03:02.590> cutter<00:03:02.739> doesn't

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
going to take a cookie cutter doesn't

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.400 
going to take a cookie cutter doesn't
matter<00:03:03.580> the<00:03:04.239> shape<00:03:04.540> of<00:03:04.720> your<00:03:04.810> cookie<00:03:05.380> cutter

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
matter the shape of your cookie cutter

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.910 
matter the shape of your cookie cutter
it<00:03:06.220> matters<00:03:07.060> that<00:03:07.090> all<00:03:07.750> your<00:03:07.930> beads<00:03:08.080> are<00:03:08.620> the

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
it matters that all your beads are the

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.190 
it matters that all your beads are the
same<00:03:09.160> size<00:03:09.430> I'm<00:03:10.420> actually<00:03:10.630> just<00:03:10.930> going<00:03:11.110> to

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
same size I'm actually just going to

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.430 
same size I'm actually just going to
take<00:03:11.380> the<00:03:11.530> tissue<00:03:11.709> blade<00:03:12.070> and<00:03:13.019> get<00:03:14.019> the<00:03:14.200> clay

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
take the tissue blade and get the clay

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.720 
take the tissue blade and get the clay
all<00:03:14.799> up<00:03:15.370> so<00:03:15.640> it<00:03:16.239> comes<00:03:16.480> up<00:03:16.690> easier<00:03:17.130> I'm<00:03:18.130> just

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
all up so it comes up easier I'm just

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:24.030 
all up so it comes up easier I'm just
going<00:03:18.850> to<00:03:18.880> cut<00:03:19.090> out<00:03:19.120> a<00:03:19.239> few<00:03:19.480> pieces<00:03:19.890> yeah<00:03:23.040> that

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
going to cut out a few pieces yeah that

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.390 
going to cut out a few pieces yeah that
one's<00:03:24.190> stuck

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:33.270 

just<00:03:28.000> poke<00:03:28.209> that<00:03:28.360> out<00:03:31.650> something<00:03:32.650> you<00:03:32.680> can<00:03:33.040> do

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
just poke that out something you can do

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:34.470 
just poke that out something you can do
if<00:03:33.459> you're<00:03:33.579> finding<00:03:33.790> that<00:03:34.000> your<00:03:34.150> cookie

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
if you're finding that your cookie

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.619 
if you're finding that your cookie
cutter<00:03:34.510> is<00:03:34.930> sticking<00:03:35.409> is<00:03:35.700> you<00:03:36.700> can<00:03:37.030> spray<00:03:37.599> a

00:03:37.619 --> 00:03:37.629 
cutter is sticking is you can spray a

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:39.780 
cutter is sticking is you can spray a
little<00:03:37.810> water<00:03:37.959> on<00:03:38.409> the<00:03:38.709> top<00:03:39.069> gives<00:03:39.610> it<00:03:39.730> a

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
little water on the top gives it a

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:41.789 
little water on the top gives it a
better<00:03:39.939> release<00:03:40.269> these<00:03:41.110> are<00:03:41.230> older<00:03:41.470> cookie

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:41.799 
better release these are older cookie

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:44.460 
better release these are older cookie
cutters<00:03:42.390> usually<00:03:43.390> just<00:03:43.599> use<00:03:43.750> them<00:03:43.930> to<00:03:43.959> size

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
cutters usually just use them to size

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:46.649 
cutters usually just use them to size
out<00:03:44.680> beads<00:03:44.980> so<00:03:45.340> they<00:03:45.849> don't<00:03:46.030> work<00:03:46.180> out<00:03:46.329> very

00:03:46.649 --> 00:03:46.659 
out beads so they don't work out very

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:47.849 
out beads so they don't work out very
well<00:03:46.720> I<00:03:46.840> think<00:03:46.989> I<00:03:47.200> bought<00:03:47.379> them<00:03:47.530> at<00:03:47.650> Hobby

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:47.859 
well I think I bought them at Hobby

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:49.649 
well I think I bought them at Hobby
Lobby<00:03:47.980> and<00:03:48.430> they<00:03:48.519> were<00:03:48.579> meant<00:03:49.000> for<00:03:49.120> polymer

00:03:49.649 --> 00:03:49.659 
Lobby and they were meant for polymer

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:52.380 
Lobby and they were meant for polymer
clay<00:03:49.810> but<00:03:50.230> they<00:03:51.010> kind<00:03:51.250> of<00:03:51.340> suck<00:03:51.700> for<00:03:52.000> polymer

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:52.390 
clay but they kind of suck for polymer

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:54.569 
clay but they kind of suck for polymer
clay<00:03:52.510> so<00:03:52.930> there's<00:03:53.200> that<00:03:53.439> got<00:03:54.189> some<00:03:54.370> clay<00:03:54.549> on

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:54.579 
clay so there's that got some clay on

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:56.729 
clay so there's that got some clay on
the<00:03:54.760> work<00:03:54.909> surface<00:03:55.120> and<00:03:55.510> that's<00:03:55.659> fine<00:03:55.959> so

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:56.739 
the work surface and that's fine so

00:03:56.739 --> 00:03:58.619 
the work surface and that's fine so
we're<00:03:56.859> just<00:03:56.890> going<00:03:57.129> to<00:03:57.189> take<00:03:57.400> these<00:03:57.579> and<00:03:57.909> we're

00:03:58.619 --> 00:03:58.629 
we're just going to take these and we're

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:02.190 
we're just going to take these and we're
going<00:03:58.900> to<00:03:59.040> very<00:04:00.040> gently<00:04:00.180> round<00:04:01.180> them<00:04:01.389> out<00:04:01.629> with

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200 
going to very gently round them out with

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.580 
going to very gently round them out with
our<00:04:02.349> fingers<00:04:03.209> before<00:04:04.209> rolling<00:04:05.019> them<00:04:05.290> into<00:04:05.470> a

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:05.590 
our fingers before rolling them into a

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:15.030 
our fingers before rolling them into a
bead<00:04:10.680> and<00:04:12.030> there<00:04:13.030> you<00:04:13.180> have<00:04:13.209> it<00:04:13.389> there<00:04:14.260> is<00:04:14.530> a

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 
bead and there you have it there is a

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.060 
bead and there you have it there is a
bead<00:04:15.539> you<00:04:16.539> if<00:04:16.780> you<00:04:16.900> have<00:04:17.019> creases<00:04:17.560> like<00:04:17.829> this

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070 
bead you if you have creases like this

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:20.009 
bead you if you have creases like this
right<00:04:18.280> here<00:04:18.519> you<00:04:18.669> can<00:04:18.849> just<00:04:19.030> use<00:04:19.419> your<00:04:19.690> finger

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:20.019 
right here you can just use your finger

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:23.490 
right here you can just use your finger
to<00:04:20.229> smooth<00:04:20.500> that<00:04:20.709> out<00:04:21.539> very<00:04:22.539> easy<00:04:22.900> to<00:04:23.169> do<00:04:23.320> a

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500 
to smooth that out very easy to do a

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.159 
to smooth that out very easy to do a
four-camera<00:04:24.310> derps

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:25.169 
four-camera derps

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:27.689 
four-camera derps
so<00:04:26.169> like<00:04:26.650> I<00:04:26.680> said<00:04:26.949> we're<00:04:27.099> going<00:04:27.190> to<00:04:27.250> roll<00:04:27.460> this

00:04:27.689 --> 00:04:27.699 
so like I said we're going to roll this

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:33.020 
so like I said we're going to roll this
bead<00:04:27.940> out<00:04:29.910> and<00:04:30.910> then<00:04:31.389> we<00:04:31.479> have<00:04:31.599> another<00:04:31.690> one

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030 
bead out and then we have another one

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:36.000 
bead out and then we have another one
these<00:04:34.030> are<00:04:34.150> toothpicks<00:04:34.630> if<00:04:35.500> you're<00:04:35.800> getting

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.010 
these are toothpicks if you're getting

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:37.740 
these are toothpicks if you're getting
really<00:04:36.250> serious<00:04:36.460> about<00:04:36.820> beads<00:04:37.180> you<00:04:37.389> can<00:04:37.570> use<00:04:37.720> a

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:37.750 
really serious about beads you can use a
