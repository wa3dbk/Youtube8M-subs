basic<00:00:15.480> point<00:00:15.900> that<00:00:16.080> is<00:00:16.440> POI<00:00:16.830> for<00:00:17.220> people<00:00:17.490> who

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
basic point that is POI for people who

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.130 
basic point that is POI for people who
are<00:00:17.640> just<00:00:17.820> starting<00:00:18.029> out<00:00:18.330> or<00:00:18.510> very<00:00:18.840> very<00:00:18.930> close

folks who think the tricks that I'm
working<00:00:23.580> on<00:00:23.730> my<00:00:23.939> tech<00:00:24.119> bloggers<00:00:24.359> really

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
working on my tech bloggers really

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.519 
working on my tech bloggers really
really<00:00:24.900> cool<00:00:25.109> but<00:00:25.980> who<00:00:26.900> don't<00:00:27.900> yet<00:00:28.260> have<00:00:28.289> the

really cool but who don't yet have the

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.370 
really cool but who don't yet have the
technical<00:00:29.039> acumen<00:00:29.310> to<00:00:29.670> do<00:00:29.910> them<00:00:30.119> so<00:00:30.449> I'm<00:00:31.230> going

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
technical acumen to do them so I'm going

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.840 
technical acumen to do them so I'm going
to<00:00:31.410> try<00:00:31.679> out<00:00:31.859> working<00:00:32.219> with<00:00:32.340> people<00:00:32.700> right

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
to try out working with people right

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.250 
to try out working with people right
from<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.149> beginning<00:00:33.239> and<00:00:33.630> see<00:00:33.809> if<00:00:33.930> it<00:00:34.020> helps

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
in this video we're going to cover what

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.280 
in this video we're going to cover what
I<00:01:01.140> consider<00:01:01.559> to<00:01:01.710> be<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:02.510> crucial<00:01:03.510> element<00:01:04.049> in

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
I consider to be the crucial element in

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.149 
I consider to be the crucial element in
making<00:01:05.040> real<00:01:05.670> turns<00:01:06.000> which<00:01:06.390> I've<00:01:07.320> heard<00:01:07.799> for

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
making real turns which I've heard for

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.750 
making real turns which I've heard for
too<00:01:08.430> as<00:01:08.700> a<00:01:09.150> to<00:01:09.360> be<00:01:09.570> weave<00:01:09.840> or<00:01:10.200> I<00:01:10.830> sometimes

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
too as a to be weave or I sometimes

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.760 
too as a to be weave or I sometimes
refer<00:01:12.090> to<00:01:12.240> it<00:01:12.510> as<00:01:12.570> a<00:01:12.630> tic-tac<00:01:13.229> because<00:01:13.650> it

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
refer to it as a tic-tac because it

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.660 
refer to it as a tic-tac because it
reminds<00:01:14.159> me<00:01:14.220> a<00:01:14.310> lot<00:01:14.520> of<00:01:14.580> a<00:01:15.920> trick<00:01:16.920> of<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.430> same

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
reminds me a lot of a trick of the same

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.340 
reminds me a lot of a trick of the same
name<00:01:17.880> that<00:01:18.090> I<00:01:18.119> learned<00:01:18.450> as<00:01:18.659> a<00:01:18.689> skateboarder

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
name that I learned as a skateboarder

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.130 
name that I learned as a skateboarder
growing<00:01:19.619> up<00:01:19.710> in<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:19.860> eighties<00:01:20.720> it<00:01:21.720> basically

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
growing up in the eighties it basically

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.340 
growing up in the eighties it basically
is<00:01:23.270> rotating<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.360> boyd<00:01:24.600> forwards<00:01:25.170> and

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
is rotating the boyd forwards and

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.200 
is rotating the boyd forwards and
switching<00:01:25.890> which<00:01:26.040> side<00:01:26.280> of<00:01:26.310> your<00:01:26.460> body<00:01:26.759> it's

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
switching which side of your body it's

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.760 
switching which side of your body it's
on<00:01:27.479> yes

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
on yes

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.550 
on yes
forwards<00:01:29.610> would<00:01:30.030> be<00:01:30.150> considered<00:01:30.689> or<00:01:31.200> at<00:01:31.409> least

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
forwards would be considered or at least

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.789 
forwards would be considered or at least
I<00:01:31.680> would<00:01:31.860> consider<00:01:32.159> it<00:01:32.280> to<00:01:32.490> be<00:01:33.170> when<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.619> poi

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
I would consider it to be when the poi

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.429 
I would consider it to be when the poi
is<00:01:34.860> rotating<00:01:35.400> is<00:01:35.520> such<00:01:35.700> a<00:01:35.729> way<00:01:36.000> that<00:01:36.479> it<00:01:37.049> seems

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
is rotating is such a way that it seems

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.039 
is rotating is such a way that it seems
to<00:01:37.650> be<00:01:37.799> going<00:01:38.070> up<00:01:38.460> when<00:01:39.000> it's<00:01:39.119> behind<00:01:39.540> you<00:01:39.840> and

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
to be going up when it's behind you and

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.230 
to be going up when it's behind you and
down<00:01:40.680> it's<00:01:41.070> in<00:01:41.159> front<00:01:41.400> of<00:01:41.460> you<00:01:41.520> like<00:01:41.549> this<00:01:41.729> yes

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
down it's in front of you like this yes

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.480 
down it's in front of you like this yes
and<00:01:42.420> of<00:01:43.350> course<00:01:43.560> you<00:01:43.710> want<00:01:43.890> to<00:01:43.920> have<00:01:44.009> it<00:01:44.310> on

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
and of course you want to have it on

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.060 
and of course you want to have it on
your<00:01:44.640> side<00:01:44.939> in<00:01:45.329> what<00:01:45.600> we<00:01:45.689> refer<00:01:46.020> to<00:01:46.049> as<00:01:46.470> wheel

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
your side in what we refer to as wheel

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.859 
your side in what we refer to as wheel
plank<00:01:47.460> that<00:01:47.610> is<00:01:47.909> that<00:01:48.119> place<00:01:48.390> where<00:01:48.600> it<00:01:48.689> feels

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
plank that is that place where it feels

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.830 
plank that is that place where it feels
like<00:01:49.049> when<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:49.829> poi<00:01:50.040> are<00:01:50.189> rotating<00:01:50.790> they<00:01:51.450> are

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
like when the poi are rotating they are

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.050 
like when the poi are rotating they are
like<00:01:52.680> I<00:01:52.710> said<00:01:52.770> a<00:01:52.950> wagon<00:01:53.310> wheels<00:01:53.520> on<00:01:53.729> each<00:01:53.820> side

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
like I said a wagon wheels on each side

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.999 
like I said a wagon wheels on each side
you<00:01:54.240> write<00:01:54.799> cool

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
you write cool

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:01.429 
you write cool
so<00:01:56.549> if<00:01:57.390> you<00:01:58.229> guts<00:01:58.799> this<00:01:59.570> rotation<00:02:00.570> forward

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
so if you guts this rotation forward

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.880 
so if you guts this rotation forward
down<00:02:02.360> the<00:02:03.360> next<00:02:03.689> step<00:02:03.869> is<00:02:04.049> to<00:02:04.259> play<00:02:04.590> with

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
down the next step is to play with

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.380 
down the next step is to play with
switching<00:02:05.340> it<00:02:05.430> back<00:02:05.460> and<00:02:05.790> forth<00:02:06.000> and<00:02:06.210> you'd<00:02:06.299> be

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
switching it back and forth and you'd be

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:06.940 
switching it back and forth and you'd be
surprised

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
surprised

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.190 
surprised

many people left are over the years who
having<00:02:09.800> a<00:02:09.830> difficult<00:02:10.819> time<00:02:10.849> with<00:02:11.269> this

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
having a difficult time with this

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.979 
having a difficult time with this
concept<00:02:11.840> a<00:02:12.080> lot<00:02:12.620> of<00:02:12.769> people<00:02:13.099> want<00:02:13.849> to<00:02:14.269> try<00:02:14.599> and

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:14.989 
concept a lot of people want to try and

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:19.180 
concept a lot of people want to try and
change<00:02:15.050> the<00:02:15.680> orientation<00:02:15.910> of<00:02:16.910> the<00:02:17.599> plane<00:02:18.190> such

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
change the orientation of the plane such

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:20.710 
change the orientation of the plane such
that<00:02:19.489> when<00:02:19.670> they<00:02:19.790> get<00:02:20.000> right<00:02:20.209> over<00:02:20.360> to<00:02:20.480> the

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
that when they get right over to the

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.350 
that when they get right over to the
left<00:02:20.959> hand<00:02:21.110> side<00:02:21.290> now<00:02:21.860> the<00:02:22.190> boy<00:02:22.519> is<00:02:22.670> coming<00:02:22.879> up

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
left hand side now the boy is coming up

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.120 
left hand side now the boy is coming up
when<00:02:24.110> it's<00:02:24.230> in<00:02:24.349> front<00:02:24.500> of<00:02:24.620> them<00:02:24.739> and<00:02:24.890> downs

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
when it's in front of them and downs

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.070 
when it's in front of them and downs
behind<00:02:25.760> them<00:02:25.910> that's<00:02:26.450> not<00:02:26.630> what<00:02:26.780> we<00:02:26.870> want<00:02:27.019> to

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
behind them that's not what we want to

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.080 
behind them that's not what we want to
accomplish<00:02:27.319> it<00:02:27.709> we<00:02:28.250> want<00:02:28.459> to<00:02:28.519> accomplish<00:02:28.700> here

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
accomplish it we want to accomplish here

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.120 
accomplish it we want to accomplish here
is<00:02:29.330> be<00:02:29.750> able<00:02:29.900> to<00:02:30.050> make<00:02:30.230> it<00:02:30.380> so<00:02:30.410> that<00:02:30.620> you<00:02:30.890> can

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
is be able to make it so that you can

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.900 
is be able to make it so that you can
cross<00:02:31.700> the<00:02:32.090> poi<00:02:32.360> in<00:02:32.569> front<00:02:32.870> of<00:02:32.959> you<00:02:33.910> when

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
cross the poi in front of you when

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:36.309 
cross the poi in front of you when
you're<00:02:35.030> looking<00:02:35.150> at<00:02:35.450> it<00:02:35.480> straight<00:02:35.840> on<00:02:35.900> this

00:02:36.309 --> 00:02:36.319 
you're looking at it straight on this

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:38.199 
you're looking at it straight on this
looks<00:02:36.560> somewhat<00:02:36.890> like<00:02:36.950> a<00:02:37.310> figure<00:02:37.549> eight<00:02:37.790> and

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209 
looks somewhat like a figure eight and

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:40.990 
looks somewhat like a figure eight and
you'll<00:02:39.110> note<00:02:39.319> that<00:02:39.349> there<00:02:40.099> is<00:02:40.280> essentially

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
you'll note that there is essentially

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.330 
you'll note that there is essentially
this<00:02:41.500> position<00:02:42.500> that<00:02:42.650> looks<00:02:42.799> like<00:02:42.920> an<00:02:43.040> X

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
this position that looks like an X

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:44.650 
this position that looks like an X
directly<00:02:43.910> in<00:02:44.000> front<00:02:44.239> of<00:02:44.299> you

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
directly in front of you

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.380 
directly in front of you
wherein<00:02:45.380> the<00:02:45.769> poi<00:02:45.980> seem<00:02:46.430> to<00:02:46.610> be<00:02:46.700> crossing<00:02:47.000> from

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
wherein the poi seem to be crossing from

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.000 
wherein the poi seem to be crossing from
one<00:02:47.450> side<00:02:47.780> of<00:02:47.810> your<00:02:48.019> body<00:02:48.140> to<00:02:48.290> the<00:02:48.410> other<00:02:48.650> and

one side of your body to the other and

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:50.770 
one side of your body to the other and
this<00:02:49.250> point<00:02:49.549> is<00:02:49.700> usually<00:02:50.090> referred<00:02:50.510> to<00:02:50.540> as<00:02:50.690> a

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
this point is usually referred to as a

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.039 
this point is usually referred to as a
cross<00:02:50.989> plane<00:02:51.610> now<00:02:52.610> the<00:02:53.239> way<00:02:53.540> you<00:02:53.599> accomplish

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:54.049 
cross plane now the way you accomplish

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:55.360 
cross plane now the way you accomplish
this<00:02:54.230> if<00:02:54.380> you're<00:02:54.500> having<00:02:54.650> a<00:02:54.769> hard<00:02:54.980> time<00:02:55.010> with

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
this if you're having a hard time with

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.020 
this if you're having a hard time with
it<00:02:55.549> is<00:02:55.700> you<00:02:56.060> first<00:02:56.239> begin<00:02:56.690> with<00:02:57.910> having<00:02:58.910> it

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
it is you first begin with having it

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.449 
it is you first begin with having it
rotating<00:02:59.540> forwards<00:03:00.019> say<00:03:00.799> on<00:03:00.890> your<00:03:00.980> right<00:03:01.190> side

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:01.459 
rotating forwards say on your right side

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:05.440 
rotating forwards say on your right side
if<00:03:01.640> we're<00:03:01.849> using<00:03:01.970> our<00:03:02.180> right<00:03:02.360> hand<00:03:02.980> and<00:03:04.450> then

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
if we're using our right hand and then

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:07.750 
if we're using our right hand and then
you<00:03:05.569> stop<00:03:05.810> it<00:03:06.019> and<00:03:06.200> then<00:03:06.950> you<00:03:07.069> try<00:03:07.220> getting<00:03:07.610> it

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
you stop it and then you try getting it

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.120 
you stop it and then you try getting it
rotating<00:03:08.239> forwards<00:03:08.810> with<00:03:09.530> it<00:03:09.709> crossed<00:03:09.950> over

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.130 
rotating forwards with it crossed over

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:11.590 
rotating forwards with it crossed over
the<00:03:10.280> left<00:03:10.459> side<00:03:10.640> of<00:03:10.700> your<00:03:10.790> body<00:03:10.940> and<00:03:11.209> notice

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:11.600 
the left side of your body and notice

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.349 
the left side of your body and notice
that<00:03:11.900> my<00:03:12.440> left<00:03:12.709> hand<00:03:13.040> it<00:03:13.340> rather<00:03:13.910> my<00:03:14.120> right

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:14.359 
that my left hand it rather my right

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:16.870 
that my left hand it rather my right
hand<00:03:14.660> is<00:03:14.959> moved<00:03:15.260> all<00:03:15.530> the<00:03:15.650> way<00:03:15.680> so<00:03:15.859> it's<00:03:16.430> even

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880 
hand is moved all the way so it's even

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:20.140 
hand is moved all the way so it's even
with<00:03:17.359> my<00:03:17.540> left<00:03:17.780> shoulder<00:03:17.959> yeah<00:03:18.530> and<00:03:19.150> once

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
with my left shoulder yeah and once

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:21.879 
with my left shoulder yeah and once
again<00:03:20.299> when<00:03:20.600> I'm<00:03:20.690> there<00:03:20.930> I<00:03:21.139> make<00:03:21.500> it<00:03:21.620> so<00:03:21.859> that

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:21.889 
again when I'm there I make it so that

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:24.160 
again when I'm there I make it so that
the<00:03:22.190> boys<00:03:22.430> coming<00:03:22.819> down<00:03:23.090> in<00:03:23.299> front<00:03:23.540> of<00:03:23.630> me<00:03:23.720> up

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
the boys coming down in front of me up

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:28.780 
the boys coming down in front of me up
behind<00:03:24.620> me<00:03:24.889> yeah<00:03:25.430> and<00:03:27.069> what<00:03:28.069> I'm<00:03:28.250> doing<00:03:28.609> this

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
behind me yeah and what I'm doing this

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.229 
behind me yeah and what I'm doing this
as<00:03:29.590> the<00:03:30.590> poise<00:03:30.859> going<00:03:31.280> in<00:03:31.400> front<00:03:31.700> of<00:03:31.819> me<00:03:32.000> I'm

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:32.239 
as the poise going in front of me I'm

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:35.050 
as the poise going in front of me I'm
going<00:03:32.510> to<00:03:32.569> try<00:03:32.750> and<00:03:32.900> slide<00:03:33.260> my<00:03:33.769> hand<00:03:34.190> over<00:03:34.819> back

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
going to try and slide my hand over back

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:38.879 
going to try and slide my hand over back
to<00:03:35.269> my<00:03:35.420> right<00:03:35.630> side<00:03:35.900> once<00:03:36.500> again<00:03:36.829> that<00:03:37.579> is

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:38.889 
to my right side once again that is

00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:41.740 
to my right side once again that is
sliding<00:03:39.889> it<00:03:40.130> back<00:03:40.250> to<00:03:40.400> the<00:03:40.519> right<00:03:40.670> and<00:03:40.970> now<00:03:41.600> I'm

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.750 
sliding it back to the right and now I'm

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:42.940 
sliding it back to the right and now I'm
in<00:03:41.900> that<00:03:42.049> position<00:03:42.200> I<00:03:42.530> originally<00:03:42.889> started

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:42.950 
in that position I originally started

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:47.530 
in that position I originally started
from<00:03:43.400> yeah<00:03:44.019> okay<00:03:45.019> so<00:03:45.880> that's<00:03:46.880> relatively<00:03:47.420> easy

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
from yeah okay so that's relatively easy

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.410 
from yeah okay so that's relatively easy
but<00:03:47.989> what<00:03:48.109> about<00:03:48.290> getting<00:03:48.440> back<00:03:48.799> now<00:03:49.420> getting

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:50.420 
but what about getting back now getting

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.920 
but what about getting back now getting
back<00:03:50.569> is<00:03:50.750> a<00:03:50.780> little<00:03:50.989> bit<00:03:51.200> trickier<00:03:51.709> because

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930 
back is a little bit trickier because

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:56.949 
back is a little bit trickier because
you're<00:03:53.930> going<00:03:54.170> to<00:03:54.230> have<00:03:54.410> to<00:03:55.420> make<00:03:56.420> that<00:03:56.630> same

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:56.959 
you're going to have to make that same

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:00.400 
you're going to have to make that same
switch<00:03:57.560> but<00:03:57.889> you're<00:03:58.040> doing<00:03:58.459> it<00:03:58.840> in<00:03:59.840> a<00:04:00.139> way<00:04:00.260> that

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:00.410 
switch but you're doing it in a way that

think about this is that I'm
I'm<00:04:06.980> imagining<00:04:07.760> I'm<00:04:08.360> pulling<00:04:08.960> up<00:04:09.260> on<00:04:09.500> the<00:04:09.530> toy

I'm imagining I'm pulling up on the toy

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:13.500 
I'm imagining I'm pulling up on the toy
when<00:04:10.970> it's<00:04:11.120> on<00:04:11.240> the<00:04:11.330> outside<00:04:11.720> of<00:04:11.840> my<00:04:11.930> arm<00:04:12.140> and

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:13.510 
when it's on the outside of my arm and

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:15.910 
when it's on the outside of my arm and
when<00:04:14.510> that<00:04:14.750> moment<00:04:14.990> happens

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:15.920 
when that moment happens

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:19.560 
when that moment happens
I<00:04:15.950> then<00:04:16.730> try<00:04:16.970> and<00:04:17.090> pull<00:04:17.299> up<00:04:17.510> on<00:04:17.690> the<00:04:17.810> ploy

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
I then try and pull up on the ploy

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:22.890 
I then try and pull up on the ploy
pulling<00:04:20.570> it<00:04:20.720> up<00:04:20.989> the<00:04:21.680> inside<00:04:22.070> of<00:04:22.190> the<00:04:22.280> arm<00:04:22.430> up

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:22.900 
pulling it up the inside of the arm up

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:30.910 
the inside of the outside of the inside
and<00:04:29.150> the<00:04:29.660> way<00:04:29.690> you<00:04:29.840> know<00:04:30.050> you've<00:04:30.200> got<00:04:30.380> this<00:04:30.620> is

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:30.920 
and the way you know you've got this is

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:33.880 
and the way you know you've got this is
that<00:04:31.370> when<00:04:31.670> you<00:04:31.700> look<00:04:32.090> at<00:04:32.240> the<00:04:32.360> ploy<00:04:32.600> as<00:04:32.990> its

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:33.890 
that when you look at the ploy as its

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:35.650 
that when you look at the ploy as its
switching<00:04:34.160> over<00:04:34.400> sides<00:04:34.850> it<00:04:35.150> should<00:04:35.330> look<00:04:35.480> like

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:35.660 
switching over sides it should look like

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:38.920 
switching over sides it should look like
it's<00:04:35.810> coming<00:04:36.080> straight<00:04:36.260> for<00:04:36.590> your<00:04:36.650> face<00:04:37.930> don't

years there are so many tricks that are

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:56.710 
years there are so many tricks that are
going<00:04:55.040> to<00:04:55.100> require<00:04:55.520> that<00:04:55.580> you<00:04:55.940> notice<00:04:56.330> don't

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:10.180 
which is also going to feel kind of
difficult<00:05:08.070> but<00:05:08.160> all<00:05:08.370> the<00:05:08.520> same<00:05:08.729> tips<00:05:09.090> apply

in<00:05:13.590> Reverse<00:05:14.400> of<00:05:14.610> course<00:05:14.850> is<00:05:15.030> the<00:05:15.180> orientation

00:05:15.469 --> 00:05:15.479 
in Reverse of course is the orientation

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:18.439 
in Reverse of course is the orientation
we're<00:05:16.229> in<00:05:16.470> it<00:05:16.800> seems<00:05:17.460> like<00:05:17.699> the<00:05:17.820> poison<00:05:18.060> going

00:05:18.439 --> 00:05:18.449 
we're in it seems like the poison going

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:20.900 
we're in it seems like the poison going
up<00:05:18.780> when<00:05:19.260> it's<00:05:19.380> in<00:05:19.530> front<00:05:19.710> of<00:05:19.860> you<00:05:20.010> and<00:05:20.310> down

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:20.910 
up when it's in front of you and down

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:22.460 
up when it's in front of you and down
when<00:05:21.180> it<00:05:21.270> goes<00:05:21.419> back<00:05:21.630> behind<00:05:21.780> your<00:05:22.139> shoulder

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:22.470 
when it goes back behind your shoulder

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:23.710 
when it goes back behind your shoulder
yes

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:23.720 
yes

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:26.780 
yes
now<00:05:24.720> switching<00:05:25.500> this<00:05:26.220> back<00:05:26.580> and<00:05:26.729> forth

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:26.790 
now switching this back and forth

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:31.129 
now switching this back and forth
between<00:05:27.150> sides<00:05:27.660> on<00:05:28.050> the<00:05:28.530> reverse<00:05:28.860> and<00:05:29.160> in<00:05:30.150> most

00:05:31.129 --> 00:05:31.139 
between sides on the reverse and in most

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:32.810 
between sides on the reverse and in most
cases<00:05:31.320> feels<00:05:31.800> a<00:05:31.949> little<00:05:32.070> bit<00:05:32.250> more<00:05:32.310> difficult

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:32.820 
cases feels a little bit more difficult

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:35.420 
cases feels a little bit more difficult
than<00:05:32.940> doing<00:05:33.090> it<00:05:33.240> on<00:05:33.330> front-end<00:05:33.860> or<00:05:34.860> doing<00:05:35.370> it

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:35.430 
than doing it on front-end or doing it

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:38.750 
than doing it on front-end or doing it
forwards<00:05:35.880> rather<00:05:36.949> the<00:05:37.949> way<00:05:38.070> usually<00:05:38.340> like<00:05:38.639> to

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:38.760 
forwards rather the way usually like to

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:40.610 
forwards rather the way usually like to
think<00:05:38.940> about<00:05:39.150> this<00:05:39.389> is<00:05:39.690> that<00:05:39.990> I'm<00:05:40.260> dropping

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:40.620 
think about this is that I'm dropping

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:43.310 
think about this is that I'm dropping
the<00:05:41.070> poi<00:05:41.310> and<00:05:41.639> in<00:05:42.150> some<00:05:42.389> respects<00:05:42.750> when<00:05:42.990> I<00:05:43.080> pull

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:43.320 
the poi and in some respects when I pull

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:45.950 
the poi and in some respects when I pull
it<00:05:43.350> up<00:05:43.590> I<00:05:43.919> let<00:05:44.340> it<00:05:44.460> drop<00:05:44.669> back<00:05:45.270> to<00:05:45.300> the<00:05:45.600> outside

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:45.960 
it up I let it drop back to the outside

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:49.340 
it up I let it drop back to the outside
of<00:05:45.990> my<00:05:46.199> arm<00:05:46.350> drop<00:05:46.830> it<00:05:47.070> drop<00:05:47.850> it<00:05:47.970> drop<00:05:48.449> it

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:49.350 
of my arm drop it drop it drop it

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:52.969 
of my arm drop it drop it drop it
yeah<00:05:49.550> so<00:05:50.550> as<00:05:50.850> its<00:05:51.210> dropping<00:05:51.889> experiment<00:05:52.889> with

00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:52.979 
yeah so as its dropping experiment with

00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:56.890 
yeah so as its dropping experiment with
moving<00:05:53.580> your<00:05:53.699> body<00:05:53.910> slightly<00:05:54.690> to<00:05:54.900> the<00:05:55.080> side

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:56.900 
moving your body slightly to the side

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:00.379 
moving your body slightly to the side
such<00:05:57.900> that<00:05:58.169> big<00:05:58.410> drops<00:05:59.090> inside<00:06:00.090> around

00:06:00.379 --> 00:06:00.389 
such that big drops inside around

00:06:00.389 --> 00:06:02.659 
such that big drops inside around
outside<00:06:00.990> you're<00:06:01.410> on<00:06:01.560> inside<00:06:02.340> your<00:06:02.490> arm

00:06:02.659 --> 00:06:02.669 
outside you're on inside your arm

00:06:02.669 --> 00:06:05.510 
outside you're on inside your arm
outside<00:06:03.419> driving<00:06:03.870> inside<00:06:04.500> around<00:06:04.770> I'll<00:06:05.220> set

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:05.520 
outside driving inside around I'll set

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:08.420 
outside driving inside around I'll set
your<00:06:05.669> arm<00:06:05.850> inside<00:06:06.330> your<00:06:06.750> arm<00:06:06.900> now<00:06:07.320> cetera<00:06:07.860> once

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:08.430 
your arm inside your arm now cetera once

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:10.310 
your arm inside your arm now cetera once
that<00:06:08.610> feels<00:06:08.820> pretty<00:06:08.940> comfortable<00:06:09.479> try<00:06:10.050> doing

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:10.320 
that feels pretty comfortable try doing

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:12.920 
that feels pretty comfortable try doing
it<00:06:10.470> without<00:06:10.590> moving<00:06:10.889> your<00:06:11.070> body<00:06:11.720> inside<00:06:12.720> or
