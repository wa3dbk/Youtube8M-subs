00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 it's a spring or it's up 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.089
 every spring moved in with me 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.859
 in a painterly video I have 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.559
 a real fisherman in the bremer 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.900
 worn and then described so many 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.670
 China please make a hard shell all the way 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.500
 just super long it can have done 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.060
 I thought to myself this time today 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.460
 Hairstyles are really made 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.800
 all super super fast and still have 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.420
 two other herringbone heads for but 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.490
 if you do not know for arguing 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.740
 soft is no problem I can you 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.660
 the first time and then wants to attack 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.640
 Hairstyle have fun with the video and go 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.739
 let 's start where I start with viruses 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.410
 herringbone job ever works 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.629
 I've had hard and two for that 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.969
 then parts of the parts 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.040
 outside my main strand of hair one 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.079
 Thinner strand of hair I catch 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.480
 mostly with the page to mine 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.730
 face shows and then lead them to the 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.920
 inside of the other strands now 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.020
 becomes the partitioned and laid over 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.280
 streak with the skin streak of the other 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.320
 summarized page 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.270
 So just let them into the 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.129
 tear in strands and then 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.350
 I repeat the step exactly like that 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.450
 take a narrow strand of the 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.820
 outside of the left main strand of hair 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:13.170
 and put it to the inside of the right one 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:15.420
 strive then I fix make the surf 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:19.220
 a little bigger and voluminous 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:22.110
 Then we start with the first hairstyle 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:24.150
 I have smooth hair for that again 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.220
 I have a middle part which is very important 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.020
 is in the request make exactly that 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.659
 same steps as just divide mine 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.280
 hair again in two parts next to the front 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.290
 a bit my pony out because I have the 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.060
 after a bit of work and then 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.369
 Let's take another small one 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.860
 strand of my main hair and see put 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.299
 the inside for a fishbone soft 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.820
 this kind of power then always think about it 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.530
 can put up above you can 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.990
 but below that would be one 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.780
 spray and I'll make it up 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.060
 below 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.860
 come'm here again made 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.570
 master equal step on the other 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:58.030
 I read my little ponies page 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:00.670
 again, my hair parted and 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.320
 bad to down what right now 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.909
 The hair is important around tight 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.500
 to pull stranded because if you to 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:08.080
 lets loose and afterwards one has one 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.580
 cool on the ear and just when you see them 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.959
 This does not look over your head 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:18.400
 so always remember 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:20.410
 nice to pull the hair soft 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.030
 number two is also finished we fix 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.350
 which is very important to you now 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.030
 you have to separate your hair nicely 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:27.820
 Of course that's one of those things too 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.739
 little personal preference i like 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:31.750
 My hair is always very measured and very 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:32.320
 pulled apart 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.360
 it's been a little bit 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:36.370
 looks messy if you do not 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.660
 makes it easy for your kipper 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.970
 but here you can see very well 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:42.280
 in difference, that's why I repeat 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.110
 on the other side again and 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:48.060
 then I have two wonderful time 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:49.950
 I think that's the way to wear it 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.540
 start now with my first soft 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.580
 to lay over my head all 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.160
 importantly, your index finger takes over 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:58.170
 then lend as a small money because then 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.910
 bend your hair well and you can 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.880
 the hair or 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:04.680
 Fix the job very well 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.720
 the whole thing with a hair clip and do 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.640
 the same with the other soft here 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.590
 tried it a little bit the 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.150
 to hide hair clips that's one 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.860
 little optimization thing you have to 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.290
 just sew a few hair clips and 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:18.930
 she was always trying to 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.760
 hide that wants me there has me 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.980
 made my france laugh 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.510
 mobile corp and then I have to go here 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.620
 for example so had a few hair 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.480
 disturbed me 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.760
 that really is a matter of taste 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.650
 and then just try around there 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.900
 For example, I have optimized again 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.489
 hiding and then start 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.989
 Partially my job a bit like that 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:38.940
 to pull apart that one really 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:40.890
 even more sees the structure of the pot 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.530
 Here again it is after yours 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:45.239
 taste but I like that very much 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:47.220
 pulled apart and my pony track 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:48.599
 to the very center of gravity I found 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.370
 that's why I have a bit back 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:52.790
 plugged and then we are already 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.790
 finished 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:10.280
 for the next hairstyle we need 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:12.410
 a middle part which was very nice for me 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.120
 What is unusual is what is very important 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:16.310
 biting over here again because we 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:18.139
 only our upper dk needs the parts 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:19.639
 I drop off here and you throw 

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:21.919
 the other hair on the side with it 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:24.080
 do not interfere with one and far too 

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:25.790
 Again and again at my table I often live too 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.840
 lichens here very important starts from 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:29.030
 at the front 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:31.699
 because if we partie from the rear h 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:33.440
 then you would almost be the one 

00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:34.760
 braid so half in the face we hang 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.229
 wanted a little more on the quasi 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:38.750
 behind the head 

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:40.610
 have fallen backwards and catch 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:42.229
 so with the front strand of hair on 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:49.310
 and then just fled normally 

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:51.410
 on herringbone braid down fix that 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:52.220
 whole as always and we repeat that 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:54.380
 same step 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:56.750
 I prefer the have what it brings easy 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:58.070
 more volume and fullness in the braid and 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:00.280
 You do not look so boring 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:00.280
 out 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:05.750
 But so boring find such a 

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:07.550
 Smooth hair that's why I use 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:09.530
 first a heat protection traffic stars 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:11.810
 my favorite product currently i love 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:14.180
 it just my week start writing it 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:16.430
 i'll give you mandy infobox and start on me 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:17.870
 to make beechey waves so completely 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:20.150
 important I do not entice with any 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:22.729
 but really only because of my hair 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:24.919
 Leave it in for just 23 seconds 

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:26.870
 curler and then I repeat the 

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:31.900
 Step on both sides snappily everywhere 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:31.900
 nice loose beechey welden 

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:46.230
 with a bit of texture 

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:48.300
 just missed more apartments 

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:51.180
 I still use a text rising spray 

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:52.560
 and spray that very generously into mine 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:57.230
 hair that will be a little bit more 

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:57.230
 more relaxed and not so perfect 

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:03.560
 next hairdresser I have my beechey 

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:05.210
 we have retained waves like that again 

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:07.010
 a bit more if in the hair 

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:09.650
 also straight in the front 

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:11.840
 ponies and a little more text 

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:13.580
 already helm spray because I just like 

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:15.230
 choose this effect from these and so on 

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:17.660
 that's a hairstyle scolds me 

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:19.430
 I now whirl up such hits 

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:22.010
 just two cords from my hair 

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:24.170
 this is really super easy attach 

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:25.850
 those with h just save because of it 

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:27.920
 is easier but you can also immediately 

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:30.430
 take on soft rubber and make me quasi 

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:32.900
 behind the back of a small braid 

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:34.370
 then I draw from the cord still so 

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:35.510
 a bit like hair out with it 

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:38.120
 just a little bit here again 

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:39.320
 looks bigger and voluminous and now 

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:41.570
 very important for me 

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:44.060
 herringbone depart from a cord 

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:45.560
 and again a normal hair the 

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:46.820
 Blanket can be your own 

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:49.040
 might have a retrospective one 

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:51.620
 but more can some perceive the 

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:53.510
 is as always personal preference and 

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:55.390
 make a whole man herringbone soft 

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:57.950
 until they have reached the bottom 

00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:59.600
 Again, I found the zob again 

00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:02.060
 pull apart a bit more 

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:06.250
 volume to do with it all a 

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:06.250
 bit more messi umbokko looks and 

00:07:06.409 --> 00:07:10.849
 yes still many other hairstyle videos 

00:07:08.869 --> 00:07:12.709
 you can click on it here or in the 

00:07:10.849 --> 00:07:15.619
 infobox I have a lot of different ones 

00:07:12.709 --> 00:07:17.929
 cordes hairstyle still a little something 

00:07:15.619 --> 00:07:19.249
 festive so definitely looked 

00:07:17.929 --> 00:07:20.989
 times through a gate like that that works 

00:07:19.249 --> 00:07:21.830
 We liked the video 

00:07:20.989 --> 00:07:23.089
 a thumbs up 

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:24.979
 so I know that I often once 

00:07:23.089 --> 00:07:26.989
 make videos and videos or we'll see 

00:07:24.979 --> 00:07:29.349
 us in the comments and then until 

00:07:26.989 --> 00:07:29.349
 Sunday
