 how to use this ticket to make an intelligent selection of your 

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:15.379
 foods 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:18.379
 next in this field 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:34.270
 the nutritional label effectively air the he is the onu that allows 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:38.480
 people can make an intelligent detection when the time comes 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.640
 That is why it is important that more and more people know what the 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.170
 ingredients that are using your products 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.320

 it is important to see that more and more time someone arming will follow each 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.929
 more people in supermarkets 

00:01:00.929 --> 00:01:05.519
 emphasize that the time to read the nutrition labeling the end is the 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:06.660
 that tells us 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:07.950
 g 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.450
 what I am eating 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.420
 how much can I consume and what benefits can it give me at a vertical level? 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.220
 the first step that I have to do to read the labeling 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.680
 nutritional these cases 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.410
 1 if you have table of contents 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:27.950
 or two if the food has the nutritional labeling in question of chemistry and 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.480
 in the first way that I have to refine where they are labeled 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.410
 and as spectators 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:37.890
 find yourself gather the most important peace we have when we read a 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.250
 nutritional labeling that the amount of energy and that is what the 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.340
 Energy can be expressed in two different ways 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.930
 the kilo would die or would it be so good in calories 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:54.730
 This is when the nutritional labeling is presented to the two forces 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.160
 calories is how we consume them again that day when the 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:03.710
 equivalent to consuming two thousand calories in the case of the average person in the 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.490
 case of kilocalories 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:07.670
 more calories 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.800
 equivalent to 4 points 18 kilos of grapes 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:14.930
 when we go forward in the nutritional labeling we find 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.290
 different department one that would be the macronutrients possess the nutrients 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.419
 that give us mainly energy 

00:02:21.419 --> 00:02:24.429
 carbohydrates proteins and fats 

00:02:24.429 --> 00:02:29.619
 and another apartment we walk apart vitamins and minerals in this case 

00:02:29.619 --> 00:02:34.180
 carbohydrates proteins and vegetable fats in the amount of grams 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.650
 who wants for each one of us we are customers the food that we 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.169
 we are selecting 

00:02:39.169 --> 00:02:42.939
 here the most important thing is that the label or nutritional does not serve to 

00:02:42.939 --> 00:02:43.620
 compare 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.880
 the amount of grams who suits us best for example if I have less 

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:51.780
 product that you have accumulated have more grams of fat than others 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:56.850
 there we can be a reason why we choose to turn ourselves over 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:58.519
 pass to an election 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:02.230
 when we talk about vitamins and minerals we are talking 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.439
 from the amount of the great forest gate to finish the road by passion 

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:09.819
 and also gives us a percentage 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:14.609
 again this percentage is an average this tells me that in the amount 

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:17.749
 in this way that first and foremost that vitamin 

00:03:17.749 --> 00:03:19.599
 that I am consuming 

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:22.439
 efe with this portion of product 

00:03:22.439 --> 00:03:25.780
 here the important thing again is that vitamins and minerals 

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:28.049
 is to compare 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:32.590
 which ones have the largest percentages of vitamins and 

00:03:32.589 --> 00:03:33.499
 minerals 

00:03:33.499 --> 00:03:37.429
 I look for foods that are my home in antioxidant vitamins such as vitamin 

00:03:37.429 --> 00:03:41.239
 ap vitamin c vitamin d 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:44.259
 nutrients like calcium iron 

00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:49.409
 since it is an important consumer and sought that the percentages of sodium 

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:53.930
 percent and cholesterol is not a vitamin c so it is also contributed 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:56.659
 being lower then yes 

00:03:56.659 --> 00:04:00.870
 a nutritional label is a very important aspect the total now to take 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:02.540
 purchase decisions 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:06.769
 because it is the one that tells us what food is the one that I should consume 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:09.049
 because it fits more to my needs 

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:13.009
 when I already have the product and I know that this is better than another 

00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:16.569
 those of the label or news indicates which is the correct position of 

00:04:16.569 --> 00:04:19.829
 consume to be able to continue healthy eating 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:23.629
 It is important to remember that nutritional labeling is based on a diet 

00:04:23.629 --> 00:04:27.639
 but good them of two thousand calories for an adult person 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:31.009
 so it is important that we also make the adjustment 

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:34.860
 facebook to what we go to the stage of life which we are 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:38.930
 another thing that is very important in nutrition labeling is going to 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:43.460
 indicate the amount of vitamins and minerals ocean aspects 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:48.030
 nutritional that knock down the door this value added to the food that 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:52.610
 we want to obtain foods that are rich in fibers that are low in 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:53.550
 sugars 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:56.550
 foods that are low in cholesterol in saturated fats 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:01.270
 They are asking couples to wait in areas Healthy eating is for whom 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:03.680
 they will bring benefits in our health 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:06.680
 it is important that we all remember to read nutritional labeling 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:11.460
 we know with this dynamic so important to be there in knowing how to choose 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:15.449
 who is best for us and is that not only can you try a diet that 

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:18.639
 be healthy but also be delicious 

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:21.879
 in him both in people bush in food 

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:23.270
 who does not finally 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:27.400
 table of food contents it is important that the both of the 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:30.169
 ingredients with which they are produced 

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:35.719
 for example if I have a product in which the sugar the fat the butter or 

00:05:35.719 --> 00:05:38.320
 some kind of ungrateful like millions 

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:42.050
 are within the first three ingredients of the food 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:47.199
 is an element that usually comes heavily loaded with sugars or houses 

00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:49.279
 which is not recommended to use 

00:05:49.279 --> 00:05:53.799
 let's read new soldiers the nutritional labeling whereabouts the content of 

00:05:53.799 --> 00:05:58.999
 nuclear calories also good to determine this month the ingredients with 

00:05:58.999 --> 00:06:01.439
 those who are using 

00:06:01.439 --> 00:06:04.369
 natural or artificial 

00:06:04.369 --> 00:06:08.550
 includes monkeys to determine the expiration date that is also 

00:06:08.549 --> 00:06:12.409
 important within a healthy diet so that fiche we stay the 

00:06:12.409 --> 00:06:13.709
 maximum benefit of our diet
