00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:07.440
 in this case no b4 edges of the second floor 

00:00:08.199 --> 00:00:11.549
 kelly correctly positioned 

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:15.749
 don't worry scandic any position and you always do this 

00:00:15.749 --> 00:00:18.029
 move here that itches first 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.619
 at most two times in a row let's see if it's enough once with the dog 1 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:24.529
 come forward with central ring 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:27.480
 2 rotation of the right side 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.179
 come back 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.179
 two other Tuscans on the right side 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.240
 this given place 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:38.850
 the others 3 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.510
 no i am a perfect settled person important to have one in place 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.750
 sometimes a suitable one is positioned behind on the left side like this 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.110
 and you always do this move here 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:53.660
 go on like this with plan 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.770
 2 rotation of your right 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:58.240
 that you come back 

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:01.000
 here is the second floor 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
 2 rotations with right side 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.450
 let's see what happened 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.450
 but this one still out this too 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:11.680
 and this too 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.750
 then we do it again again 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.870
 behind left 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:20.250
 go on like this with plan 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.740
 two votes from the right side 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.450
 return with the second floor 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.940
 2 rotation of your right 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.410
 then let's see what happens on this post gone 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:35.200
 this is positioned contact manuli 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.250
 this positioned indented this is positioned not oriented then we have 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:40.440
 two edges 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.010
 opposite 1 4 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:45.480
 it's water 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:46.760
 that is 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.930
 positioned but not oriented to correct this thing here 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.060
 located in the cube 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:54.680
 and place it like this 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.680
 the edge under a bear is important 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:03.100
 and you perform the move that runs the sun and at the corners position when 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.550
 I play 180 degrees with each other this this one 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:09.800
 not caring that this is already the case 

00:02:18.179 --> 00:02:21.179
 right 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:24.699
 right 

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:27.699
 awakens again 

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:32.579
 right 

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:36.479
 soap 

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:39.479
 right 

00:02:40.969 --> 00:02:43.939
 durox in the first floor 

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:46.999
 let's see how it happened 

00:02:46.999 --> 00:02:49.999
 so now let's give this that affixed this too 

00:02:51.149 --> 00:02:52.769
 these two 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:55.769
 I'm off to bring the yellow underneath 

00:02:56.579 --> 00:03:00.419
 here too it is very simple enough cbc video of the cube of 90 degrees in 

00:03:00.419 --> 00:03:03.349
 this sense we get in the case 

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:07.430
 as if we had not started with the white color as whose first color is 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:11.059
 we must carry the yellow saddle pad this one here on this side 

00:03:12.679 --> 00:03:15.679
 ok the move always the same 

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:19.909
 right 

00:03:21.529 --> 00:03:24.529
 right 

00:03:27.339 --> 00:03:29.639
 right again 

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:32.589
 on 

00:03:32.589 --> 00:03:35.589
 right 

00:03:37.309 --> 00:03:40.309
 right 

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:43.499
 two votes on the first floor 

00:03:43.499 --> 00:03:44.499
 the nightmare is over
