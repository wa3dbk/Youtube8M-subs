00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
you know these drum heads came about for

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.890 
you know these drum heads came about for
a<00:03:34.650> reason<00:03:35.189> not<00:03:35.340> just<00:03:35.790> because<00:03:36.389> they<00:03:36.569> were<00:03:36.629> cool

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
a reason not just because they were cool

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.599 
a reason not just because they were cool
to<00:03:36.930> look<00:03:37.230> at<00:03:38.810> the<00:03:39.810> lights<00:03:40.109> inside<00:03:40.439> are<00:03:41.129> really

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:41.609 
to look at the lights inside are really

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:45.080 
to look at the lights inside are really
what<00:03:42.389> started<00:03:42.870> it<00:03:43.019> all<00:03:43.579> they<00:03:44.579> would<00:03:44.909> look<00:03:45.060> very

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
what started it all they would look very

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.869 
what started it all they would look very
good<00:03:45.359> in<00:03:46.079> an<00:03:46.260> orchestra<00:03:46.829> at<00:03:47.099> a<00:03:47.129> very<00:03:47.459> elegant

00:03:47.869 --> 00:03:47.879 
good in an orchestra at a very elegant

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:50.330 
good in an orchestra at a very elegant
affair<00:03:48.439> but<00:03:49.439> the<00:03:49.500> real<00:03:49.769> reason<00:03:50.040> they<00:03:50.219> were

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
affair but the real reason they were

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.720 
affair but the real reason they were
doing<00:03:50.670> it<00:03:50.849> is<00:03:51.000> because<00:03:51.180> these<00:03:51.989> again<00:03:52.739> our

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
doing it is because these again our

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:56.330 
doing it is because these again our
animal<00:03:54.599> skin<00:03:54.989> heads<00:03:55.319> they're<00:03:55.650> made<00:03:55.859> of<00:03:56.010> CAP

00:03:59.539 --> 00:03:59.549 
skin and what happens to calf skin in

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:02.569 
skin and what happens to calf skin in
humid<00:04:00.090> weather<00:04:00.120> is<00:04:00.659> it<00:04:01.230> begins<00:04:01.620> to<00:04:01.829> loosen<00:04:02.040> and

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:02.579 
humid weather is it begins to loosen and

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:05.599 
humid weather is it begins to loosen and
it<00:04:03.239> sags<00:04:03.599> and<00:04:04.109> the<00:04:04.260> drums<00:04:04.500> go<00:04:04.739> out<00:04:04.889> of<00:04:05.040> tune<00:04:05.250> and

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:05.609 
it sags and the drums go out of tune and

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:08.059 
it sags and the drums go out of tune and
it<00:04:05.700> was<00:04:05.819> a<00:04:05.849> real<00:04:06.120> nightmare<00:04:06.450> in<00:04:06.840> those<00:04:06.989> days<00:04:07.319> so

00:04:08.059 --> 00:04:08.069 
it was a real nightmare in those days so

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:10.550 
it was a real nightmare in those days so
the<00:04:08.909> lights<00:04:09.150> were<00:04:09.389> put<00:04:09.419> inside<00:04:09.780> to<00:04:10.109> give<00:04:10.319> just

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
the lights were put inside to give just

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.569 
the lights were put inside to give just
enough<00:04:11.370> of<00:04:11.730> a<00:04:12.689> drying<00:04:13.079> effect<00:04:13.290> to<00:04:13.739> tighten

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:14.579 
enough of a drying effect to tighten

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:16.939 
enough of a drying effect to tighten
those<00:04:14.730> heads<00:04:15.030> back<00:04:15.299> up<00:04:15.540> but<00:04:16.049> they<00:04:16.169> also<00:04:16.380> had

00:04:16.939 --> 00:04:16.949 
those heads back up but they also had

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:21.289 
those heads back up but they also had
special<00:04:17.609> heaters<00:04:18.570> that<00:04:19.139> would<00:04:19.380> be<00:04:20.299> connected

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:21.299 
special heaters that would be connected

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:23.330 
special heaters that would be connected
to<00:04:21.660> the<00:04:21.780> drums<00:04:22.079> inside<00:04:22.740> there<00:04:22.949> it<00:04:23.070> was<00:04:23.310> a

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
to the drums inside there it was a

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.820 
to the drums inside there it was a
heating<00:04:23.760> element<00:04:23.880> and<00:04:24.360> that<00:04:24.900> also<00:04:25.169> did<00:04:25.680> the

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
heating element and that also did the

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:28.610 
heating element and that also did the
same<00:04:26.070> job<00:04:26.370> but<00:04:26.699> the<00:04:27.330> lightbulb<00:04:27.539> inside<00:04:28.349> you

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
same job but the lightbulb inside you

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.890 
same job but the lightbulb inside you
know<00:04:28.740> what<00:04:28.949> that<00:04:29.550> would<00:04:29.699> suffice<00:04:29.909> and<00:04:30.419> it

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 
know what that would suffice and it

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:32.270 
know what that would suffice and it
would<00:04:31.020> also<00:04:31.169> look<00:04:31.650> pretty

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
would also look pretty

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.089 
would also look pretty
it<00:04:32.699> looked<00:04:33.000> elegant<00:04:33.539> on<00:04:33.690> stage<00:04:34.020> hence<00:04:34.830> they

00:04:35.089 --> 00:04:35.099 
it looked elegant on stage hence they

00:04:35.099 --> 00:04:36.950 
it looked elegant on stage hence they
started<00:04:35.490> doing<00:04:35.760> these<00:04:35.909> silhouette<00:04:36.599> type

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 
started doing these silhouette type

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.529 
started doing these silhouette type
paintings<00:04:37.680> the<00:04:38.550> drum<00:04:38.789> company<00:04:39.030> started

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:39.539 
paintings the drum company started

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:40.879 
paintings the drum company started
putting<00:04:39.810> those<00:04:39.930> out<00:04:40.139> and<00:04:40.320> they<00:04:40.380> would<00:04:40.500> they

00:04:40.879 --> 00:04:40.889 
putting those out and they would they

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:42.050 
putting those out and they would they
would<00:04:40.979> actually<00:04:41.310> make<00:04:41.490> the<00:04:41.610> paintings

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 
would actually make the paintings

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:45.379 
would actually make the paintings
especially<00:04:42.770> to<00:04:43.770> be<00:04:43.919> enhanced<00:04:44.280> by<00:04:44.550> the<00:04:45.150> light

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:45.389 
especially to be enhanced by the light

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:47.689 
especially to be enhanced by the light
bulbs<00:04:45.810> that<00:04:45.900> were<00:04:46.229> put<00:04:46.770> inside<00:04:47.070> these<00:04:47.310> drums

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:47.699 
bulbs that were put inside these drums

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:48.920 
bulbs that were put inside these drums
now<00:04:48.300> mine

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:48.930 
now mine

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:51.560 
now mine
I<00:04:48.960> had<00:04:49.320> to<00:04:49.470> rewire<00:04:49.919> because<00:04:50.430> the<00:04:50.940> wiring<00:04:51.300> is

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:51.570 
I had to rewire because the wiring is

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:54.409 
I had to rewire because the wiring is
very<00:04:51.780> dangerous<00:04:52.139> you<00:04:52.860> know<00:04:53.400> that<00:04:53.820> old<00:04:53.970> wiring

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:54.419 
very dangerous you know that old wiring

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:56.570 
very dangerous you know that old wiring
is<00:04:54.539> carota<00:04:54.900> so<00:04:55.110> if<00:04:55.349> you<00:04:55.680> run<00:04:55.830> across<00:04:56.190> one<00:04:56.220> of

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:56.580 
is carota so if you run across one of

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:59.089 
is carota so if you run across one of
these<00:04:56.699> you<00:04:57.180> want<00:04:57.449> to<00:04:57.570> update<00:04:57.750> that<00:04:58.080> wiring<00:04:58.949> and

00:04:59.089 --> 00:04:59.099 
these you want to update that wiring and

00:04:59.099 --> 00:05:04.730 
these you want to update that wiring and
make<00:04:59.639> it<00:04:59.820> safe<00:05:00.120> so<00:05:00.810> I<00:05:01.669> think<00:05:03.229> these<00:05:04.229> just<00:05:04.560> have

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:04.740 
make it safe so I think these just have

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:08.210 
make it safe so I think these just have
a<00:05:04.770> special<00:05:05.370> vibe<00:05:05.639> about<00:05:06.000> them<00:05:06.360> you<00:05:06.509> know<00:05:07.220> there

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:08.220 
a special vibe about them you know there

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:09.710 
a special vibe about them you know there
