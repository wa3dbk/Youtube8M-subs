00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:10.189
 % and not bad the aspect is primordial 

00:00:10.189 --> 00:00:12.709

 dec near the action 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:45.910
 but not a report he brought to stop 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:47.920
 had already acquired mental 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.520
 and m I think the challenges that pleases me to anticipate at 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:53.970
 the organization 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:57.210
 It is a challenge to feel that he was holed up 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.580
 it's excellent 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:01.600

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.060
 cct working relationships 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.060
 it ended last night 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.179
 I feel very good about myself 5% 

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:33.280
 this is a very good opportunity today 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.110

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.480

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:43.060
 as the Canadian and also to be able to work with people like like 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:44.180
 baba 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:48.620
 glasgow ticker boivin club lyonnais leave staff do not I think that 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.640
 the general manager's summer experience 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.010
 still a good experience among the 1300 meters 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:58.330
 aa I think of a hand mode in the mail to have 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.850
 comprehension 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.210
 of the whole organization too I think to help you 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:07.290
 my relationships 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:13.350
 with the general director of the site the communication with the players and the 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.899
 communication in which the organization 

00:02:15.899 --> 00:02:18.089
 she is very important% 

00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:21.289
 with the players I think it's important even if in two 

00:02:21.289 --> 00:02:25.399

00:02:25.399 --> 00:02:29.549
 with network so that finally this club that all that was full of tickets 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:31.039
 in the 40s 

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:33.459
 and the job tomorrow too 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:36.289
 it's important I think if we look 

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:40.409
 still fair enough that I think discipline is very important 

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:44.279
 to this important source are hlm expenses 

00:02:44.279 --> 00:02:47.329
 then they have to act won channel and then it's something with 

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:51.519
 young people that she on the garden not enough I think I really want me 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:54.569
