reason why i want to complete all of

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.320 
reason why i want to complete all of
these<00:00:23.160> it's<00:00:23.369> not<00:00:23.490> because<00:00:23.760> you<00:00:23.910> know<00:00:23.939> of<00:00:24.119> my

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
these it's not because you know of my

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.390 
these it's not because you know of my
personal<00:00:24.869> achievement<00:00:25.560> or<00:00:25.710> whatever<00:00:26.099> but

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
personal achievement or whatever but

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.700 
personal achievement or whatever but
because<00:00:26.789> if<00:00:27.029> you<00:00:27.449> complete<00:00:27.779> all<00:00:27.810> of<00:00:27.990> those<00:00:28.289> you

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
because if you complete all of those you

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.519 
because if you complete all of those you
unlock<00:00:29.130> a<00:00:29.340> new<00:00:29.580> dungeoneering<00:00:30.390> mode<00:00:30.689> which<00:00:31.349> is

because you know obviously you have

because you know obviously you have
maxed<00:01:28.200> it<00:01:28.259> out<00:01:28.409> and<00:01:28.770> maybe<00:01:29.009> you<00:01:29.280> don't<00:01:29.430> want<00:01:29.729> to

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
maxed it out and maybe you don't want to

maxed it out and maybe you don't want to
get<00:01:29.970> any<00:01:30.180> daily<00:01:31.049> tasks<00:01:31.470> from<00:01:31.770> that<00:01:31.979> scale

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
because you don't need an extra

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.330 
because you don't need an extra
experience<00:01:34.140> in<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:34.560> mod<00:01:34.710> so<00:01:35.159> that's

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
experience in the mod so that's

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.429 
experience in the mod so that's
completely<00:01:35.670> fine<00:01:35.970> so<00:01:36.540> toggled<00:01:36.960> all<00:01:37.140> of<00:01:37.290> these

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
completely fine so toggled all of these

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.370 
completely fine so toggled all of these
out<00:01:37.710> because<00:01:38.100> I<00:01:38.220> have<00:01:38.369> the<00:01:38.759> maxed<00:01:39.420> and<00:01:39.570> I

wanted<00:01:40.799> only<00:01:41.009> to<00:01:41.130> get<00:01:41.369> my<00:01:41.640> dungeoneering<00:01:42.240> deal

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
wanted only to get my dungeoneering deal

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.840 
wanted only to get my dungeoneering deal
experience<00:01:42.990> which<00:01:43.530> is<00:01:43.680> understandable<00:01:43.979> but

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
experience which is understandable but

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.490 
experience which is understandable but
then<00:01:45.030> the<00:01:45.149> divination<00:01:45.509> skill<00:01:45.990> came<00:01:46.200> out<00:01:46.320> you

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
then the divination skill came out you

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.730 
then the divination skill came out you
know<00:01:46.649> and<00:01:47.540> all<00:01:48.540> its<00:01:48.720> finite<00:01:48.990> because<00:01:49.290> I<00:01:49.320> can

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
know and all its finite because I can

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.310 
know and all its finite because I can
get<00:01:49.890> both<00:01:50.100> of<00:01:50.310> these<00:01:50.430> now<00:01:50.670> daily<00:01:51.240> but<00:01:51.899> now<00:01:51.990> this

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
get both of these now daily but now this

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.870 
get both of these now daily but now this
is<00:01:52.470> what<00:01:52.619> I<00:01:52.649> don't<00:01:52.920> understand<00:01:53.460> look<00:01:53.610> at<00:01:53.759> this

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
is what I don't understand look at this

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.490 
is what I don't understand look at this
now<00:01:54.090> for<00:01:55.100> some<00:01:56.100> reason<00:01:56.310> I<00:01:56.759> still<00:01:56.880> get<00:01:57.570> farming

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
now for some reason I still get farming

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.770 
now for some reason I still get farming
I<00:01:58.649> still<00:01:58.860> get<00:01:58.979> agility<00:01:59.460> daily<00:01:59.850> tasks<00:02:00.420> I<00:02:00.509> still

don't<00:02:03.930> want<00:02:04.500> to<00:02:04.619> get<00:02:04.799> those<00:02:05.009> I<00:02:05.280> told<00:02:05.909> to<00:02:06.149> this

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
don't want to get those I told to this

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.180 
don't want to get those I told to this
guy<00:02:06.450> don't<00:02:06.810> want<00:02:07.079> to<00:02:07.170> get<00:02:07.320> toggle<00:02:07.740> all<00:02:07.890> of

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
engineering they give something like

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.150 
engineering they give something like
plants<00:02:19.400> imported<00:02:19.940> oil<00:02:19.970> you<00:02:20.570> know<00:02:20.690> although

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
but i still get the farming i still get

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.690 
but i still get the farming i still get
all<00:02:52.850> of<00:02:53.180> these<00:02:53.420> I<00:02:53.720> don't<00:02:54.530> know<00:02:54.620> what<00:02:54.770> to<00:02:54.920> do<00:02:55.070> why

completed so I completed 26 challenges
out<00:03:11.150> of<00:03:11.300> 47<00:03:11.840> for<00:03:12.230> the<00:03:12.380> demon<00:03:12.680> Haim<00:03:12.890> and<00:03:13.160> I<00:03:13.580> have

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
out of 47 for the demon Haim and I have

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.140 
out of 47 for the demon Haim and I have
locked<00:03:14.440> what<00:03:15.440> is<00:03:15.739> going<00:03:15.950> to<00:03:16.010> show<00:03:16.160> the<00:03:16.370> other

locked what is going to show the other

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.920 
locked what is going to show the other
requirements<00:03:18.459> level<00:03:19.459> 86<00:03:20.000> divination<00:03:20.600> so<00:03:20.720> this

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
requirements level 86 divination so this

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.259 
requirements level 86 divination so this
is<00:03:21.110> the<00:03:21.290> highest<00:03:21.590> requirement<00:03:22.489> and<00:03:22.700> I<00:03:23.030> only

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:23.269 
is the highest requirement and I only

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:25.509 
is the highest requirement and I only
have<00:03:23.570> two<00:03:24.019> that<00:03:24.260> I<00:03:24.320> cannot<00:03:24.799> could<00:03:25.040> only<00:03:25.160> do

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:25.519 
have two that I cannot could only do

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:29.410 
have two that I cannot could only do
this<00:03:26.239> one<00:03:26.510> and<00:03:26.750> oh<00:03:27.650> I<00:03:28.310> unlocked<00:03:28.760> in<00:03:29.000> the<00:03:29.209> next

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
this one and oh I unlocked in the next

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:31.479 
this one and oh I unlocked in the next
one<00:03:29.570> because<00:03:29.720> I<00:03:29.840> got<00:03:30.080> level<00:03:30.320> 70<00:03:30.769> divination

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:31.489 
one because I got level 70 divination

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:33.039 
one because I got level 70 divination
yes<00:03:31.850> so<00:03:32.030> it's<00:03:32.180> only<00:03:32.330> this<00:03:32.600> one<00:03:32.840> that<00:03:33.019> is

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:33.049 
yes so it's only this one that is

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:35.050 
yes so it's only this one that is
currently<00:03:33.560> locked<00:03:33.860> that<00:03:34.459> means<00:03:34.670> i<00:03:34.760> have<00:03:34.790> no

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
currently locked that means i have no

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.600 
currently locked that means i have no
requirements<00:03:35.780> yet<00:03:35.930> so<00:03:36.320> yeah<00:03:36.860> all<00:03:37.250> the<00:03:37.459> other
