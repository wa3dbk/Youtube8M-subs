00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:31.580 
okay so here we are at the divide and

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:34.120 
okay so here we are at the divide and
basically<00:01:32.480> I've<00:01:32.990> had<00:01:33.260> a<00:01:33.290> public<00:01:33.710> event<00:01:33.800> come

basically I've had a public event come

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.210 
basically I've had a public event come
in<00:01:34.310> this<00:01:35.210> is<00:01:35.420> one<00:01:35.600> of<00:01:35.630> those<00:01:35.900> bounties<00:01:36.830> where

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:37.220 
in this is one of those bounties where

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.610 
in this is one of those bounties where
you<00:01:37.490> have<00:01:37.700> to<00:01:37.910> wait<00:01:38.120> for<00:01:38.150> the<00:01:38.510> Wolves<00:01:39.260> to<00:01:39.380> start

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:39.620 
you have to wait for the Wolves to start

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:40.780 
you have to wait for the Wolves to start
prowling<00:01:39.800> there<00:01:40.220> it<00:01:40.310> is<00:01:40.400> in<00:01:40.580> the<00:01:40.640> bottom

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:40.790 
prowling there it is in the bottom

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:43.180 
prowling there it is in the bottom
left-hand<00:01:41.150> corner<00:01:41.360> so<00:01:42.260> I<00:01:42.590> shall<00:01:42.890> probably

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:43.190 
left-hand corner so I shall probably

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:47.080 
left-hand corner so I shall probably
jump<00:01:43.640> into<00:01:43.970> em<00:01:44.810> where<00:01:45.620> he<00:01:45.650> comes<00:01:45.980> in<00:01:46.250> basically

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
jump into em where he comes in basically

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:48.850 
jump into em where he comes in basically
once<00:01:47.270> the<00:01:47.450> wolf<00:01:47.630> start<00:01:47.960> prowling<00:01:48.230> you<00:01:48.650> take

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860 
once the wolf start prowling you take

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.130 
once the wolf start prowling you take
out<00:01:49.040> the<00:01:49.190> waves<00:01:49.430> and<00:01:49.790> then<00:01:50.330> he<00:01:50.660> will<00:01:50.870> be<00:01:50.960> the

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
out the waves and then he will be the

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:55.730 
the divide he dropped in over here where

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:58.240 
the divide he dropped in over here where
the<00:01:55.870> captain's<00:01:56.870> the<00:01:57.080> Fallen<00:01:57.440> captain's<00:01:57.860> jump
