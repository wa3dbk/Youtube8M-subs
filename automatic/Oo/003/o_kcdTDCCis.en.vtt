00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:12.269
 so here is the maybe edel grings 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:17.369
 crohn so this is a company that in 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:23.939
 turkey so he has several advantages 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:26.340
 we see the fixed in two suffers so 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:30.660
 there it allows to put a polo 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:34.800
 focus taxes for business there the focus 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:37.050
 so a sharpness adjustment of one of a 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.050
 very high precision in an accessory 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.850
 that I soon acquire slamming the 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.890
 put on pieces really allowed to 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.890
 do two really interesting things 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:04.340
 so it is very convenient too and more 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:04.340
 especially for that to do so les paul 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:13.710
 was there are several angles one can 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:16.320
 even put that on the belt that allows 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:19.290
 to have a stability with a big 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.970
 devices like the 800 So there you 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.810
 put your shoulder and peace to his wife 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:29.009
 so he puts watch in order to be able to 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:33.590
 fine-tune the sharpness in this 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:42.200
 mode there of course so no need for that 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:42.200
 or so I bought in accessories 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.310
 Something 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:58.600
 kita but really planting the shoulder 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:02:01.030
 to have to pau so keeps a little my 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:03.180
 puts in the focus to make a 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:06.700
 sharpness look in this mode 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:09.509
 so these are accessories that 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.509
 is relatively expensive 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:21.210
 you will of course mark the microphone one 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:25.370
 much better quality than the microphone 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:25.370
 internal of the 800 and 

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:33.180
 the violent clashes 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.239
 see like that 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.670
 and so that provides a very very good 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.670
 stability 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:21.680
 and so you can put it to the 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:21.680
 belt
