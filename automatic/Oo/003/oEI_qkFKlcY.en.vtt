what is a barre chord

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.300 
what is a barre chord
well<00:00:31.480> a<00:00:31.720> barre<00:00:32.439> chord<00:00:32.470> is<00:00:32.770> when<00:00:32.890> you<00:00:32.980> take<00:00:33.160> your

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:33.310 
well a barre chord is when you take your

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:36.720 
well a barre chord is when you take your
pointer<00:00:33.700> finger<00:00:34.260> and<00:00:35.260> you<00:00:35.740> you<00:00:36.100> basically<00:00:36.400> are

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:36.730 
pointer finger and you you basically are

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:41.549 
pointer finger and you you basically are
creating<00:00:37.180> a<00:00:37.270> bar<00:00:37.510> across<00:00:39.600> across<00:00:40.600> the<00:00:40.840> all<00:00:41.140> six

00:00:41.549 --> 00:00:41.559 
creating a bar across across the all six

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:43.500 
creating a bar across across the all six
strings<00:00:41.920> you're<00:00:42.370> kind<00:00:42.609> of<00:00:42.670> pushing<00:00:43.210> down<00:00:43.239> on

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:43.510 
strings you're kind of pushing down on

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.389 
strings you're kind of pushing down on
all<00:00:43.629> six<00:00:43.899> of<00:00:43.960> them<00:00:44.109> now<00:00:44.559> what<00:00:44.770> you're<00:00:44.949> doing<00:00:44.980> is

00:00:45.389 --> 00:00:45.399 
all six of them now what you're doing is

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:48.090 
all six of them now what you're doing is
you're<00:00:45.910> replicating<00:00:46.390> the<00:00:47.050> nut<00:00:47.260> think<00:00:47.890> of<00:00:48.010> the

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:48.100 
you're replicating the nut think of the

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.670 
you're replicating the nut think of the
nut<00:00:48.340> as<00:00:48.489> your<00:00:49.090> finger<00:00:49.420> and<00:00:49.719> so<00:00:50.289> when<00:00:50.530> you're

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:50.680 
nut as your finger and so when you're

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.950 
nut as your finger and so when you're
playing<00:00:50.920> a<00:00:51.100> bar<00:00:51.309> on<00:00:51.640> like<00:00:52.030> the<00:00:52.329> third<00:00:52.510> fret

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:52.960 
playing a bar on like the third fret

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.669 
playing a bar on like the third fret
here<00:00:53.370> I'm<00:00:54.370> basically<00:00:54.640> just<00:00:55.329> simulating<00:00:56.230> what

00:00:56.669 --> 00:00:56.679 
here I'm basically just simulating what

00:00:56.679 --> 00:00:59.040 
here I'm basically just simulating what
the<00:00:56.829> nut<00:00:56.980> would<00:00:57.160> do<00:00:57.280> another<00:00:57.899> example<00:00:58.899> is<00:00:59.019> a

00:00:59.040 --> 00:00:59.050 
the nut would do another example is a

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.080 
the nut would do another example is a
capo<00:00:59.620> if<00:00:59.800> you've<00:00:59.949> seen<00:01:00.160> a<00:01:00.190> capo<00:01:00.609> those<00:01:00.789> those

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:01.090 
capo if you've seen a capo those those

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:03.180 
capo if you've seen a capo those those
are<00:01:01.239> those<00:01:01.329> little<00:01:01.390> you<00:01:02.230> know<00:01:02.320> clips<00:01:02.739> you<00:01:03.070> know

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:03.190 
are those little you know clips you know

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:04.439 
are those little you know clips you know
little<00:01:03.429> metal<00:01:03.670> things<00:01:03.879> that<00:01:04.000> people<00:01:04.120> clip

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:04.449 
little metal things that people clip

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:06.420 
little metal things that people clip
onto<00:01:04.660> their<00:01:04.930> neck<00:01:05.110> and<00:01:05.350> it<00:01:05.830> allows<00:01:06.040> them<00:01:06.250> to

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:06.430 
onto their neck and it allows them to

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:08.790 
onto their neck and it allows them to
play<00:01:06.550> open<00:01:06.820> chords<00:01:07.390> at<00:01:07.540> a<00:01:07.660> higher<00:01:08.140> position<00:01:08.410> on

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:08.800 
play open chords at a higher position on

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.370 
play open chords at a higher position on
the<00:01:08.950> on<00:01:09.280> the<00:01:09.580> neck<00:01:09.760> but<00:01:10.230> basically<00:01:11.230> what

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:11.380 
the on the neck but basically what

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.190 
the on the neck but basically what
you're<00:01:11.500> doing<00:01:11.920> is<00:01:12.130> you're<00:01:12.340> kind<00:01:12.580> of<00:01:13.200> manually

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.200 
you're doing is you're kind of manually

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.130 
you're doing is you're kind of manually
creating<00:01:14.740> that<00:01:14.920> capo<00:01:15.460> or<00:01:15.850> the<00:01:16.270> nut<00:01:16.450> with<00:01:17.020> your

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.140 
creating that capo or the nut with your

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.890 
creating that capo or the nut with your
finger<00:01:17.470> so<00:01:17.650> that's<00:01:18.070> what<00:01:18.250> a<00:01:18.280> bar<00:01:18.520> is<00:01:18.840> when<00:01:19.840> you

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:19.900 
finger so that's what a bar is when you

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.050 
finger so that's what a bar is when you
hear<00:01:20.050> someone<00:01:20.260> to<00:01:20.380> refer<00:01:20.650> to<00:01:20.740> a<00:01:20.770> bar<00:01:21.010> chord<00:01:21.280> now

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.060 
hear someone to refer to a bar chord now

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.930 
hear someone to refer to a bar chord now
what<00:01:22.810> that<00:01:22.840> leaves<00:01:23.260> you<00:01:23.440> with<00:01:23.470> is<00:01:24.010> these<00:01:24.640> three

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:24.940 
what that leaves you with is these three

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.360 
what that leaves you with is these three
fingers<00:01:25.150> to<00:01:25.540> create<00:01:25.810> all<00:01:26.020> your<00:01:26.050> chords<00:01:26.560> so<00:01:27.100> if

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:27.370 
fingers to create all your chords so if

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:29.550 
fingers to create all your chords so if
this<00:01:27.760> is<00:01:28.060> simulating<00:01:28.390> the<00:01:28.780> nut<00:01:28.960> then<00:01:29.410> you've

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 
this is simulating the nut then you've

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.350 
this is simulating the nut then you've
got<00:01:29.710> three<00:01:30.010> fingers<00:01:30.370> to<00:01:30.400> create<00:01:30.730> your<00:01:31.030> chords

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:31.360 
got three fingers to create your chords

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.330 
got three fingers to create your chords
or<00:01:31.780> your<00:01:32.020> patterns<00:01:32.460> so<00:01:33.460> in<00:01:33.760> the<00:01:34.150> first<00:01:34.360> pattern

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
or your patterns so in the first pattern

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:37.960 
and I'll put the tablature up on the

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.930 
and I'll put the tablature up on the
screen<00:01:38.200> so<00:01:38.290> you<00:01:38.350> can<00:01:38.470> follow<00:01:38.650> along<00:01:38.940> what

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:39.940 
screen so you can follow along what

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:41.820 
screen so you can follow along what
we're<00:01:40.090> gonna<00:01:40.180> do<00:01:40.420> is<00:01:40.540> we're<00:01:40.660> gonna<00:01:40.720> bar<00:01:41.110> the

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:41.830 
we're gonna do is we're gonna bar the

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.610 
we're gonna do is we're gonna bar the
third<00:01:42.040> fret<00:01:42.340> here<00:01:42.610> and<00:01:42.990> now<00:01:43.990> the<00:01:44.050> great<00:01:44.470> thing

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:44.620 
third fret here and now the great thing

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:45.720 
third fret here and now the great thing
about<00:01:44.650> these<00:01:44.950> patterns<00:01:45.190> are<00:01:45.490> you're<00:01:45.670> not

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:45.730 
about these patterns are you're not

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:48.690 
about these patterns are you're not
limited<00:01:46.150> to<00:01:46.300> any<00:01:46.570> fret<00:01:46.930> since<00:01:47.860> it's<00:01:48.040> a<00:01:48.130> bar<00:01:48.310> you

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
limited to any fret since it's a bar you

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.850 
limited to any fret since it's a bar you
can<00:01:48.850> slide<00:01:49.210> this<00:01:49.450> anywhere<00:01:50.260> and<00:01:50.320> you<00:01:50.740> know

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860 
can slide this anywhere and you know

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:52.470 
can slide this anywhere and you know
obviously<00:01:51.160> get<00:01:51.310> different<00:01:51.760> major<00:01:52.000> chords

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:52.480 
obviously get different major chords

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:53.760 
obviously get different major chords
depending<00:01:52.900> on<00:01:52.990> where<00:01:53.140> you<00:01:53.230> slide<00:01:53.380> it<00:01:53.530> we'll

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
depending on where you slide it we'll

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:55.290 
depending on where you slide it we'll
get<00:01:53.950> into<00:01:54.130> that<00:01:54.190> a<00:01:54.340> minute<00:01:54.670> let's<00:01:54.940> make<00:01:55.150> the

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:55.300 
get into that a minute let's make the

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.320 
get into that a minute let's make the
pattern<00:01:55.630> first<00:01:55.870> so<00:01:56.770> if<00:01:57.370> we<00:01:57.640> borrow<00:01:57.940> the<00:01:58.120> third

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330 
pattern first so if we borrow the third

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.200 
pattern first so if we borrow the third
fret<00:01:58.720> like<00:01:59.380> that<00:01:59.620> take<00:02:00.460> our<00:02:00.580> middle<00:02:00.760> finger

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.210 
fret like that take our middle finger

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:06.090 
fret like that take our middle finger
and<00:02:01.420> push<00:02:01.870> down<00:02:02.140> on<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:03.780> third<00:02:04.780> string<00:02:05.200> in

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
and push down on the third string in

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.999 
and push down on the third string in
this<00:02:06.340> scenario<00:02:06.640> it's<00:02:06.970> on<00:02:07.090> the<00:02:07.180> fourth<00:02:07.450> fret<00:02:08.009> to

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
this scenario it's on the fourth fret to

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:13.380 
this scenario it's on the fourth fret to
create<00:02:10.230> this<00:02:11.230> note

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
create this note

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.130 
create this note
and<00:02:14.490> then<00:02:15.490> we're<00:02:15.670> gonna<00:02:15.760> take<00:02:16.060> our<00:02:16.360> ring

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
and then we're gonna take our ring

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.830 
and then we're gonna take our ring
finger<00:02:17.580> and<00:02:18.580> we're<00:02:18.730> gonna<00:02:18.850> push<00:02:19.210> it<00:02:19.390> down<00:02:19.600> on

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
finger and we're gonna push it down on

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.660 
finger and we're gonna push it down on
the<00:02:20.320> fifth<00:02:20.830> fret<00:02:21.460> fifth<00:02:22.030> string<00:02:23.490> way<00:02:24.490> down

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
that note so if I'm pushing down here

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.060 
that note so if I'm pushing down here
with<00:02:40.090> my<00:02:40.330> bar<00:02:40.600> and<00:02:40.840> I'm<00:02:41.410> pushing<00:02:41.680> down<00:02:41.890> with

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.070 
with my bar and I'm pushing down with

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:45.510 
with my bar and I'm pushing down with
these<00:02:42.400> three<00:02:42.730> fingers<00:02:43.209> I<00:02:43.500> can<00:02:44.500> play<00:02:44.740> all<00:02:44.950> six

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:45.520 
these three fingers I can play all six

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:52.380 
these three fingers I can play all six
strings<00:02:49.080> and<00:02:50.080> it<00:02:50.200> sounds<00:02:50.590> like<00:02:50.620> that<00:02:51.390> and

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
strings and it sounds like that and

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:56.490 
strings and it sounds like that and
that's<00:02:52.570> actually<00:02:52.840> a<00:02:53.260> G<00:02:53.650> chord<00:02:55.230> so<00:02:56.230> when<00:02:56.380> I'm

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
that's actually a G chord so when I'm

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:04.229 
that's actually a G chord so when I'm
strumming<00:03:01.350> strumming<00:03:02.350> all<00:03:02.739> six<00:03:03.040> strings<00:03:03.370> now

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:04.239 
strumming strumming all six strings now

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:06.360 
strumming strumming all six strings now
the<00:03:04.300> challenge<00:03:05.020> for<00:03:05.230> you<00:03:05.410> is<00:03:05.709> going<00:03:06.040> to<00:03:06.100> be

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
the challenge for you is going to be

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.330 
the challenge for you is going to be
getting<00:03:07.300> all<00:03:07.540> six<00:03:07.870> strings<00:03:08.200> to<00:03:08.560> ring<00:03:08.590> out<00:03:08.950> nice

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
getting all six strings to ring out nice

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:14.690 
getting all six strings to ring out nice
and<00:03:09.730> clean<00:03:10.239> just<00:03:11.140> like<00:03:11.350> that

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.400 

so<00:03:15.270> there's<00:03:15.450> a<00:03:15.510> couple<00:03:15.690> things<00:03:15.840> to<00:03:16.110> keep<00:03:16.260> in

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
so there's a couple things to keep in

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:19.370 
so there's a couple things to keep in
mind<00:03:16.590> here<00:03:16.920> one<00:03:17.610> the<00:03:18.000> thumb<00:03:18.300> always<00:03:18.780> back<00:03:19.140> here

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
mind here one the thumb always back here

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.920 
mind here one the thumb always back here
doing<00:03:19.560> its<00:03:19.800> thing<00:03:20.300> supporting<00:03:21.300> the<00:03:21.540> back<00:03:21.720> of

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
doing its thing supporting the back of

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.900 
doing its thing supporting the back of
the<00:03:22.020> neck<00:03:22.200> and<00:03:22.500> it's<00:03:22.680> pushing<00:03:22.980> so<00:03:23.610> I'm<00:03:23.700> pushing

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
the neck and it's pushing so I'm pushing

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.020 
the neck and it's pushing so I'm pushing
with<00:03:24.180> my<00:03:24.209> thumb<00:03:24.540> and<00:03:24.780> I'm<00:03:24.900> pulling<00:03:25.410> with<00:03:25.590> my

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 
with my thumb and I'm pulling with my

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:28.520 
with my thumb and I'm pulling with my
with<00:03:27.030> my<00:03:27.150> fingers<00:03:27.540> to<00:03:27.569> create<00:03:27.840> that<00:03:28.080> squeeze

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
with my fingers to create that squeeze

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.699 
with my fingers to create that squeeze
motion<00:03:29.040> and<00:03:29.959> which<00:03:30.959> gives<00:03:31.200> you<00:03:31.290> the<00:03:31.410> leverage

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
motion and which gives you the leverage

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:37.520 
motion and which gives you the leverage
you<00:03:31.830> need<00:03:33.140> but<00:03:34.140> if<00:03:34.260> you<00:03:34.380> keep<00:03:34.590> practicing<00:03:36.530> this

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
you need but if you keep practicing this

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.970 
you need but if you keep practicing this
pattern<00:03:38.010> you<00:03:38.130> will<00:03:38.340> get<00:03:38.580> it<00:03:38.760> and<00:03:38.970> you'll<00:03:39.330> see

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:39.980 
pattern you will get it and you'll see

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:42.949 
pattern you will get it and you'll see
just<00:03:40.980> how<00:03:41.100> useful<00:03:41.370> that<00:03:41.580> is<00:03:41.850> because<00:03:42.239> I<00:03:42.480> can

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
just how useful that is because I can

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:45.710 
just how useful that is because I can
take<00:03:43.170> this<00:03:43.500> this<00:03:44.370> pattern<00:03:44.849> and<00:03:45.000> shift<00:03:45.450> it<00:03:45.599> up

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
take this this pattern and shift it up

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:50.210 
take this this pattern and shift it up
in<00:03:45.900> one<00:03:46.080> notch<00:03:47.780> now<00:03:48.780> I'm<00:03:48.900> playing<00:03:49.140> a<00:03:49.260> g-sharp<00:03:49.830> I

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
in one notch now I'm playing a g-sharp I

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:54.080 
in one notch now I'm playing a g-sharp I
can<00:03:50.940> shift<00:03:51.150> it<00:03:51.300> up<00:03:51.420> another<00:03:51.720> notch<00:03:51.810> and<00:03:53.090> I'm

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
can shift it up another notch and I'm

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.690 
can shift it up another notch and I'm
playing<00:03:54.330> an<00:03:54.569> A<00:03:54.870> I<00:03:55.200> can<00:03:55.950> shift<00:03:56.160> it<00:03:56.280> up<00:03:56.400> another

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
playing an A I can shift it up another

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:01.009 
playing an A I can shift it up another
notch<00:03:57.530> and<00:03:58.530> I'm<00:03:58.620> playing<00:03:58.890> a<00:03:59.040> B<00:03:59.280> I<00:03:59.660> can<00:04:00.660> shift<00:04:00.870> it

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:01.019 
notch and I'm playing a B I can shift it

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:04.490 
notch and I'm playing a B I can shift it
up<00:04:01.140> another<00:04:01.410> notch<00:04:02.390> I'm<00:04:03.390> playing<00:04:03.660> a<00:04:03.750> see<00:04:03.959> see

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
up another notch I'm playing a see see

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:10.190 
up another notch I'm playing a see see
see<00:04:07.190> so<00:04:08.190> you<00:04:08.280> can<00:04:08.400> play<00:04:08.549> a<00:04:08.580> C<00:04:08.850> down<00:04:09.180> here<00:04:09.569> the

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
see so you can play a C down here the

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.050 
see so you can play a C down here the
open<00:04:10.500> position<00:04:10.890> where<00:04:11.069> you've<00:04:11.160> learned<00:04:11.370> it<00:04:11.549> or

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
open position where you've learned it or

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.090 
open position where you've learned it or
you<00:04:12.239> can<00:04:12.360> play<00:04:12.480> it<00:04:12.569> up<00:04:12.660> here<00:04:12.980> you<00:04:13.980> get

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:14.100 
you can play it up here you get

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:16.490 
you can play it up here you get
different<00:04:14.459> octaves<00:04:15.000> of<00:04:15.269> the<00:04:15.420> same<00:04:15.870> chord<00:04:16.139> so

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
different octaves of the same chord so

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.880 
different octaves of the same chord so
you<00:04:16.530> see<00:04:16.769> how<00:04:16.859> this<00:04:17.010> one<00:04:17.280> pattern<00:04:18.769> gives<00:04:19.769> you

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:19.890 
you see how this one pattern gives you

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:21.590 
you see how this one pattern gives you
all<00:04:20.310> kinds<00:04:20.340> of<00:04:20.700> different<00:04:20.850> chords<00:04:21.329> up<00:04:21.450> and

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600 
all kinds of different chords up and

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.390 
all kinds of different chords up and
down<00:04:21.720> the<00:04:21.870> neck<00:04:21.900> and<00:04:22.470> you<00:04:22.710> can<00:04:22.740> keep<00:04:23.039> going<00:04:23.160> as

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
down the neck and you can keep going as

high<00:04:23.550> as<00:04:23.610> your<00:04:23.880> fingers<00:04:24.210> will<00:04:24.360> squeeze

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.610 
high as your fingers will squeeze

high as your fingers will squeeze
another<00:04:26.610> thing<00:04:26.850> to<00:04:26.940> kind<00:04:27.120> of<00:04:27.180> point<00:04:27.450> out<00:04:27.600> which

another thing to kind of point out which

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:30.200 
another thing to kind of point out which
may<00:04:28.350> help<00:04:28.560> you<00:04:28.770> understand<00:04:29.520> what's<00:04:29.729> going<00:04:29.789> on

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 
may help you understand what's going on

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.420 
may help you understand what's going on
when<00:04:30.690> we<00:04:30.720> played<00:04:31.110> that<00:04:31.289> when<00:04:31.979> we<00:04:32.130> learn<00:04:32.280> to

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:32.430 
when we played that when we learn to

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:34.460 
when we played that when we learn to
play<00:04:32.580> an<00:04:32.640> E<00:04:32.789> chord

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.470 
play an E chord

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:38.090 
play an E chord
sit<00:04:34.920> down<00:04:35.100> here<00:04:35.430> think<00:04:36.270> of<00:04:36.420> that<00:04:36.600> as<00:04:37.100> notice

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:38.100 
sit down here think of that as notice

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.220 
sit down here think of that as notice
the<00:04:38.280> pattern<00:04:38.640> in<00:04:38.790> the<00:04:38.880> e<00:04:38.910> of<00:04:39.300> these<00:04:39.930> three

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:40.230 
the pattern in the e of these three

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:43.430 
the pattern in the e of these three
fingers<00:04:40.440> here<00:04:41.600> that's<00:04:42.600> the<00:04:42.810> exact<00:04:43.200> same

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:43.440 
fingers here that's the exact same

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.630 
fingers here that's the exact same
pattern<00:04:43.910> as<00:04:45.410> what<00:04:46.410> these<00:04:46.800> three<00:04:47.190> fingers<00:04:47.490> are

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:47.640 
pattern as what these three fingers are

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:50.270 
pattern as what these three fingers are
doing<00:04:47.730> here<00:04:48.240> so<00:04:48.900> if<00:04:49.110> I<00:04:49.230> were<00:04:49.380> to<00:04:49.500> take<00:04:49.680> this<00:04:49.980> and

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:50.280 
doing here so if I were to take this and

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:55.700 
doing here so if I were to take this and
go<00:04:51.270> down<00:04:52.820> go<00:04:53.820> down<00:04:53.850> one<00:04:54.150> more<00:04:54.180> where<00:04:54.900> my<00:04:55.020> bar

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:55.710 
go down go down one more where my bar

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:57.500 
go down go down one more where my bar
goes<00:04:55.920> away<00:04:56.070> because<00:04:56.640> it's<00:04:56.940> replaced<00:04:57.300> by<00:04:57.450> the

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:57.510 
goes away because it's replaced by the

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:02.480 
goes away because it's replaced by the
nut<00:04:58.340> see<00:04:59.340> that's<00:04:59.640> the<00:04:59.910> E<00:04:59.940> chord<00:05:01.220> so<00:05:02.220> when<00:05:02.400> I'm

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:02.490 
nut see that's the E chord so when I'm

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:05.810 
nut see that's the E chord so when I'm
what<00:05:03.240> I'm<00:05:03.360> doing<00:05:03.690> in<00:05:03.990> essence<00:05:04.530> is<00:05:04.710> the<00:05:04.950> pattern

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:05.820 
what I'm doing in essence is the pattern

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:07.430 
what I'm doing in essence is the pattern
here<00:05:06.120> is<00:05:06.270> really<00:05:06.510> just<00:05:06.660> the<00:05:06.990> same<00:05:07.170> pattern

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:07.440 
here is really just the same pattern

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.050 
here is really just the same pattern
that<00:05:07.740> I<00:05:07.800> use<00:05:07.980> when<00:05:08.160> I<00:05:08.190> play<00:05:08.430> that<00:05:08.610> open

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:09.060 
that I use when I play that open

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:10.060 
that I use when I play that open
position

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:10.070 
position

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:14.960 
position
Ecore<00:05:12.050> I'm<00:05:13.050> just<00:05:13.260> replacing<00:05:13.650> the<00:05:13.950> nut<00:05:14.520> with<00:05:14.820> my

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:14.970 
Ecore I'm just replacing the nut with my

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:15.500 
Ecore I'm just replacing the nut with my
finger

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:15.510 
finger

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:18.170 
finger
so<00:05:15.960> if<00:05:16.440> hopefully<00:05:17.160> that<00:05:17.310> helps<00:05:17.640> you<00:05:17.760> kind<00:05:18.030> of

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:18.180 
so if hopefully that helps you kind of

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:23.420 
so if hopefully that helps you kind of
visualize<00:05:18.540> what's<00:05:18.840> going<00:05:18.930> on<00:05:21.200> my<00:05:22.200> e<00:05:22.230> if<00:05:23.130> I<00:05:23.220> go

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:23.430 
visualize what's going on my e if I go

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:26.360 
visualize what's going on my e if I go
up<00:05:23.550> one<00:05:23.790> then<00:05:24.690> I've<00:05:24.840> got<00:05:24.990> an<00:05:25.140> F<00:05:25.380> now<00:05:25.950> remember

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:26.370 
up one then I've got an F now remember

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:28.550 
up one then I've got an F now remember
we<00:05:26.490> learned<00:05:26.640> to<00:05:26.820> play<00:05:26.940> an<00:05:27.030> F<00:05:27.180> like<00:05:27.240> this<00:05:27.570> but

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:28.560 
we learned to play an F like this but

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:32.270 
we learned to play an F like this but
with<00:05:28.680> a<00:05:28.740> bar<00:05:29.660> we<00:05:30.660> can<00:05:30.840> play<00:05:31.050> a<00:05:31.080> full<00:05:31.560> F<00:05:31.800> with<00:05:32.130> all

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:32.280 
with a bar we can play a full F with all

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.560 
with a bar we can play a full F with all
six<00:05:32.760> strings

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:34.570 
six strings

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:36.570 
six strings
and<00:05:35.080> you<00:05:35.230> can<00:05:35.410> use<00:05:35.650> either<00:05:35.770> of<00:05:36.100> them<00:05:36.280> it<00:05:36.400> just

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:36.580 
and you can use either of them it just

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:38.370 
and you can use either of them it just
depends<00:05:37.000> on<00:05:37.150> you<00:05:37.840> know<00:05:37.870> if<00:05:38.080> you're<00:05:38.230> playing

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:38.380 
depends on you know if you're playing

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:44.190 
depends on you know if you're playing
something<00:05:38.710> fast<00:05:42.510> you<00:05:43.510> may<00:05:43.660> not<00:05:43.810> have<00:05:43.960> enough

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:44.200 
something fast you may not have enough

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:45.870 
something fast you may not have enough
time<00:05:44.230> to<00:05:44.410> jump<00:05:44.770> back<00:05:45.130> and<00:05:45.160> forth<00:05:45.400> between<00:05:45.670> that

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:45.880 
time to jump back and forth between that

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:49.950 
time to jump back and forth between that
bar<00:05:46.210> chord<00:05:46.510> but<00:05:47.580> you<00:05:48.580> can<00:05:48.730> see<00:05:48.970> that's<00:05:49.450> an<00:05:49.720> e

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:49.960 
bar chord but you can see that's an e

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:54.330 
bar chord but you can see that's an e
that's<00:05:50.710> an<00:05:50.950> F<00:05:51.660> that's<00:05:52.660> an<00:05:52.900> f-sharp<00:05:53.130> up<00:05:54.130> one

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:54.340 
that's an F that's an f-sharp up one

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:58.530 
that's an F that's an f-sharp up one
more<00:05:54.550> that's<00:05:55.180> a<00:05:55.300> G<00:05:55.950> sharp<00:05:56.950> and<00:05:57.100> so<00:05:57.250> forth<00:05:57.490> so<00:05:57.910> by
