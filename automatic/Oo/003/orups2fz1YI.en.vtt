welcome back to leap tennis training
Scott<00:00:03.600> down<00:00:03.810> here<00:00:04.110> today<00:00:04.710> we're<00:00:04.950> going<00:00:05.070> to

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:05.160 
Scott down here today we're going to

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.820 
Scott down here today we're going to
talk<00:00:05.310> about<00:00:05.340> the<00:00:05.700> approach<00:00:06.030> shot<00:00:06.830> probably

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
talk about the approach shot probably

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.320 
talk about the approach shot probably
even<00:00:08.040> a<00:00:08.099> tough<00:00:08.340> shot<00:00:08.550> today<00:00:08.759> especially<00:00:09.030> for

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
even a tough shot today especially for

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.450 
even a tough shot today especially for
the<00:00:09.480> pros<00:00:09.780> is<00:00:10.050> when<00:00:10.559> they<00:00:10.680> come<00:00:10.920> into<00:00:11.070> their

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
the pros is when they come into their

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.310 
the pros is when they come into their
lot<00:00:11.700> at<00:00:11.820> the<00:00:11.910> time<00:00:11.940> of<00:00:12.300> the<00:00:12.390> new<00:00:12.510> technology

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
lot at the time of the new technology

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.020 
lot at the time of the new technology
with<00:00:13.470> the<00:00:13.559> strings<00:00:13.889> are<00:00:14.099> able<00:00:14.340> to<00:00:14.400> pass<00:00:14.730> the

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
with the strings are able to pass the

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.850 
with the strings are able to pass the
ball<00:00:15.059> down<00:00:15.840> at<00:00:15.990> their<00:00:16.170> feet<00:00:16.379> a<00:00:16.410> lot<00:00:16.619> most

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:16.860 
ball down at their feet a lot most

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:19.040 
ball down at their feet a lot most
recreational<00:00:17.640> players<00:00:17.880> we<00:00:18.210> have<00:00:18.449> to<00:00:18.660> hit<00:00:18.869> that

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
recreational players we have to hit that

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.490 
recreational players we have to hit that
approach<00:00:19.440> shot<00:00:19.770> so<00:00:20.460> few<00:00:21.060> things<00:00:21.300> to<00:00:21.510> make<00:00:21.690> make

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
approach shot so few things to make make

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.109 
approach shot so few things to make make
sure<00:00:22.710> you're<00:00:22.920> doing<00:00:23.070> is<00:00:23.369> when<00:00:23.699> you're<00:00:23.880> coming

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
sure you're doing is when you're coming

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:25.880 
sure you're doing is when you're coming
up<00:00:24.390> to<00:00:24.449> this<00:00:24.690> ball<00:00:24.990> you've<00:00:25.260> got<00:00:25.289> to<00:00:25.529> approach

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
up to this ball you've got to approach

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.160 
up to this ball you've got to approach
the<00:00:26.220> approach<00:00:26.330> what<00:00:27.330> I<00:00:27.359> mean<00:00:27.630> by<00:00:27.810> that<00:00:27.840> is

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
the approach what I mean by that is

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.009 
the approach what I mean by that is
getting<00:00:28.949> up<00:00:29.130> to<00:00:29.400> that<00:00:29.520> ball<00:00:29.789> soon<00:00:30.180> do<00:00:30.600> not<00:00:30.810> you

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
getting up to that ball soon do not you

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.990 
getting up to that ball soon do not you
don't<00:00:31.170> want<00:00:31.289> to<00:00:31.380> let<00:00:31.500> it<00:00:31.590> drop<00:00:31.890> okay<00:00:32.699> most

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
don't want to let it drop okay most

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.190 
don't want to let it drop okay most
players<00:00:33.270> get<00:00:33.600> up<00:00:33.690> to<00:00:33.870> it

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
players get up to it

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.170 
players get up to it
kind<00:00:34.559> of<00:00:34.680> a<00:00:34.860> little<00:00:35.160> bit<00:00:35.309> nervous<00:00:35.610> of<00:00:35.880> coming

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
kind of a little bit nervous of coming

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.959 
kind of a little bit nervous of coming
in<00:00:36.329> and<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:36.630> ball<00:00:36.840> starts<00:00:37.230> to<00:00:37.380> drop<00:00:37.860> down<00:00:38.160> okay

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
in and the ball starts to drop down okay

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.880 
in and the ball starts to drop down okay
you<00:00:39.030> want<00:00:39.300> to<00:00:39.329> get<00:00:39.570> it<00:00:39.719> as<00:00:39.840> it's<00:00:40.140> coming<00:00:40.530> up<00:00:40.680> at

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
you want to get it as it's coming up at

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.030 
you want to get it as it's coming up at
the<00:00:41.219> apex<00:00:41.730> meaning<00:00:42.540> as<00:00:42.719> it's<00:00:42.930> bouncing<00:00:43.500> you're

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
the apex meaning as it's bouncing you're

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.160 
the apex meaning as it's bouncing you're
turning<00:00:44.610> sideways<00:00:44.910> you're<00:00:45.420> not<00:00:45.540> spacing<00:00:46.050> the

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
turning sideways you're not spacing the

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.590 
turning sideways you're not spacing the
net<00:00:46.379> you're<00:00:46.950> turning<00:00:47.250> sideways<00:00:47.670> getting<00:00:48.480> it

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
net you're turning sideways getting it

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.600 
net you're turning sideways getting it
at<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:48.780> top<00:00:49.020> of<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.260> bounce<00:00:49.500> then<00:00:50.219> you<00:00:50.430> can

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
at the top of the bounce then you can

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.490 
at the top of the bounce then you can
impart<00:00:50.969> topspin<00:00:51.600> on<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:51.780> ball<00:00:51.870> if<00:00:52.260> you're

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
impart topspin on the ball if you're

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.660 
impart topspin on the ball if you're
going<00:00:52.680> for<00:00:52.920> a<00:00:52.980> topspin<00:00:53.399> approach<00:00:55.399> one<00:00:56.399> thing

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
going for a topspin approach one thing

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.369 
going for a topspin approach one thing
you<00:00:56.789> want<00:00:56.969> to<00:00:57.030> do<00:00:57.149> on<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.360> topspin<00:00:57.809> approaches

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
you want to do on the topspin approaches

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.770 
you want to do on the topspin approaches
making<00:00:59.010> sure<00:00:59.309> that<00:00:59.579> you<00:00:59.730> realize<00:01:00.180> as<00:01:00.449> you're

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
making sure that you realize as you're

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.810 
making sure that you realize as you're
turning<00:01:00.960> sideways<00:01:01.410> you're<00:01:01.800> inside<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.579> court

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
turning sideways you're inside the court

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.639 
turning sideways you're inside the court
so<00:01:03.000> you<00:01:03.030> actually<00:01:03.270> need<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:04.019> impart<00:01:04.409> a<00:01:04.530> little

00:01:04.639 --> 00:01:04.649 
so you actually need to impart a little

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:06.769 
so you actually need to impart a little
more<00:01:04.920> spin<00:01:05.279> to<00:01:05.579> pick<00:01:05.819> the<00:01:05.999> ball<00:01:06.149> up<00:01:06.209> and<00:01:06.569> drop

00:01:06.769 --> 00:01:06.779 
more spin to pick the ball up and drop

00:01:06.779 --> 00:01:09.590 
more spin to pick the ball up and drop
drop<00:01:07.109> it<00:01:07.259> in<00:01:07.409> so<00:01:07.979> we<00:01:08.700> don't<00:01:08.999> want<00:01:09.179> to<00:01:09.270> go<00:01:09.420> with

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
drop it in so we don't want to go with

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.660 
drop it in so we don't want to go with
our<00:01:09.719> traditional<00:01:10.350> long<00:01:10.679> follow-through<00:01:11.490> here

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
our traditional long follow-through here

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.459 
our traditional long follow-through here
the<00:01:11.909> ball<00:01:12.119> is<00:01:12.149> going<00:01:12.359> to<00:01:12.479> sail<00:01:12.719> now<00:01:12.990> most

00:01:13.459 --> 00:01:13.469 
the ball is going to sail now most

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:15.679 
the ball is going to sail now most
likely<00:01:13.679> so<00:01:14.159> we're<00:01:14.880> going<00:01:15.060> to<00:01:15.119> follow<00:01:15.299> through

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
likely so we're going to follow through

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:16.910 
likely so we're going to follow through
a<00:01:15.779> little<00:01:15.990> bit<00:01:16.109> here<00:01:16.289> on<00:01:16.319> the<00:01:16.499> forehand

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
a little bit here on the forehand

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.769 
a little bit here on the forehand
especially<00:01:17.549> just<00:01:17.729> over<00:01:18.149> here<00:01:18.299> next<00:01:18.509> to<00:01:18.630> my

00:01:18.769 --> 00:01:18.779 
especially just over here next to my

00:01:18.779 --> 00:01:20.690 
especially just over here next to my
shot<00:01:19.049> a<00:01:19.079> bit<00:01:19.349> more<00:01:19.560> of<00:01:19.679> a<00:01:19.770> windshield<00:01:20.459> wiper

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
shot a bit more of a windshield wiper

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.569 
shot a bit more of a windshield wiper
shorter<00:01:21.599> type<00:01:22.229> action<00:01:22.740> and<00:01:22.950> on<00:01:23.069> the<00:01:23.189> backhand

00:01:23.569 --> 00:01:23.579 
shorter type action and on the backhand

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:25.580 
shorter type action and on the backhand
the<00:01:23.729> same<00:01:23.939> I'm<00:01:24.060> really<00:01:24.389> going<00:01:24.569> to<00:01:24.599> pick<00:01:24.840> my<00:01:25.020> my

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
the same I'm really going to pick my my

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.529 
the same I'm really going to pick my my
wrist<00:01:25.920> up<00:01:26.219> and<00:01:26.579> finish<00:01:26.909> over<00:01:27.209> here<00:01:27.389> a<00:01:27.420> little

00:01:27.529 --> 00:01:27.539 
wrist up and finish over here a little

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:29.539 
wrist up and finish over here a little
more<00:01:27.920> again<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.310> traditional

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
more again the traditional

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.010 
more again the traditional
follow-through<00:01:30.359> is<00:01:30.389> going<00:01:30.599> to<00:01:30.659> be<00:01:30.719> all<00:01:30.899> the

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
follow-through is going to be all the

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.419 
follow-through is going to be all the
way<00:01:31.109> through<00:01:31.469> this<00:01:31.709> one's<00:01:32.009> going<00:01:32.249> to<00:01:32.310> be

00:01:32.419 --> 00:01:32.429 
way through this one's going to be

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:35.569 
way through this one's going to be
really<00:01:33.020> abbreviated<00:01:34.020> over<00:01:34.380> my<00:01:34.560> probably<00:01:35.310> mid

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
really abbreviated over my probably mid

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.789 
really abbreviated over my probably mid
shoulder<00:01:35.849> point<00:01:36.359> okay<00:01:36.959> so<00:01:36.990> so<00:01:37.740> I've

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
shoulder point okay so so I've

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:38.870 
shoulder point okay so so I've
approached<00:01:38.279> the<00:01:38.490> ball

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
approached the ball

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.019 
approached the ball
I'm<00:01:38.969> sideways<00:01:39.659> I<00:01:39.990> followed<00:01:40.889> through<00:01:41.219> and<00:01:41.639> what

00:01:42.019 --> 00:01:42.029 
I'm sideways I followed through and what

00:01:42.029 --> 00:01:45.229 
I'm sideways I followed through and what
do<00:01:42.119> I<00:01:42.179> do<00:01:42.299> I'm<00:01:42.749> trying<00:01:43.109> to<00:01:43.469> do<00:01:43.619> this<00:01:43.859> fluidly<00:01:44.579> so

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:45.239 
do I do I'm trying to do this fluidly so

00:01:45.239 --> 00:01:46.909 
do I do I'm trying to do this fluidly so
you'll<00:01:45.479> see<00:01:45.689> more<00:01:45.989> I'm<00:01:46.289> gonna<00:01:46.439> land<00:01:46.679> on<00:01:46.799> my

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:46.919 
you'll see more I'm gonna land on my

00:01:46.919 --> 00:01:48.919 
you'll see more I'm gonna land on my
left<00:01:47.159> foot<00:01:47.340> that<00:01:47.520> I'm<00:01:47.700> moving<00:01:47.939> forward<00:01:48.779> and

00:01:48.919 --> 00:01:48.929 
left foot that I'm moving forward and

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:50.779 
left foot that I'm moving forward and
then<00:01:49.139> I'm<00:01:49.289> going<00:01:49.409> to<00:01:49.499> get<00:01:49.619> into<00:01:49.859> my<00:01:50.009> split<00:01:50.489> step

00:01:50.779 --> 00:01:50.789 
then I'm going to get into my split step

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:56.480 
then I'm going to get into my split step
position<00:01:51.029> here

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.940 

so<00:01:57.330> I've<00:01:57.420> skipped<00:01:57.690> my<00:01:57.840> approach<00:01:58.200> on<00:01:58.470> here<00:01:58.710> and

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
so I've skipped my approach on here and

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.380 
so I've skipped my approach on here and
then<00:01:59.100> I'm<00:01:59.190> going<00:01:59.340> to<00:01:59.430> move<00:01:59.640> forward<00:02:00.030> and<00:02:00.240> get

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
then I'm going to move forward and get

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.960 
then I'm going to move forward and get
to<00:02:00.450> my<00:02:00.690> split<00:02:01.110> step<00:02:01.380> position<00:02:01.560> now<00:02:02.220> before<00:02:02.940> I

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970 
to my split step position now before I

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.510 
to my split step position now before I
do<00:02:03.120> that<00:02:03.600> as<00:02:03.810> I'm<00:02:04.380> meeting<00:02:04.830> I<00:02:04.980> want<00:02:05.250> to<00:02:05.310> take<00:02:05.490> a

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
do that as I'm meeting I want to take a

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.419 
do that as I'm meeting I want to take a
couple<00:02:05.970> of<00:02:06.150> quick<00:02:06.480> steps<00:02:06.900> to<00:02:07.470> get<00:02:07.680> as<00:02:07.860> close<00:02:08.100> to

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
couple of quick steps to get as close to

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.090 
couple of quick steps to get as close to
the<00:02:08.580> net<00:02:08.729> as<00:02:08.880> I<00:02:09.000> can<00:02:09.300> and<00:02:09.570> do<00:02:10.320> my<00:02:10.500> split<00:02:10.860> step

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100 
the net as I can and do my split step

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.890 
the net as I can and do my split step
when<00:02:11.430> the<00:02:11.610> opponent<00:02:12.090> hits<00:02:12.330> the<00:02:12.510> ball<00:02:12.690> or

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
when the opponent hits the ball or

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.199 
when the opponent hits the ball or
attempts<00:02:13.440> a<00:02:13.530> passing<00:02:13.950> shot<00:02:14.130> okay<00:02:14.850> so<00:02:14.910> let's

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
attempts a passing shot okay so let's

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:17.690 
attempts a passing shot okay so let's
see<00:02:15.360> that<00:02:15.510> again<00:02:15.540> I'm<00:02:16.200> back<00:02:16.500> here<00:02:16.770> how<00:02:17.400> many

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
see that again I'm back here how many

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.340 
see that again I'm back here how many
here<00:02:17.970> my<00:02:18.150> follow-through<00:02:18.600> is<00:02:18.840> a<00:02:18.870> little<00:02:19.140> more

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
here my follow-through is a little more

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.110 
here my follow-through is a little more
and<00:02:19.620> then<00:02:19.680> I'm<00:02:19.830> going<00:02:19.950> to<00:02:19.980> really<00:02:20.280> explode<00:02:20.880> a

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
and then I'm going to really explode a

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.850 
and then I'm going to really explode a
couple<00:02:21.480> of<00:02:21.570> quick<00:02:21.750> steps<00:02:22.110> and<00:02:22.290> get<00:02:22.500> into<00:02:22.740> my

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
couple of quick steps and get into my

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.490 
couple of quick steps and get into my
balance<00:02:23.310> split<00:02:23.640> step<00:02:23.880> position<00:02:24.230> reason<00:02:25.230> I<00:02:25.290> get

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
balance split step position reason I get

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.620 
balance split step position reason I get
into<00:02:25.680> this<00:02:25.800> position<00:02:26.280> is<00:02:26.490> because<00:02:26.910> I'm<00:02:27.510> going

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
into this position is because I'm going

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.449 
into this position is because I'm going
to<00:02:27.720> need<00:02:27.810> to<00:02:27.959> change<00:02:28.230> direction<00:02:28.739> if<00:02:29.040> they<00:02:29.220> try

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
to need to change direction if they try

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:31.250 
to need to change direction if they try
to<00:02:29.489> hit<00:02:29.760> a<00:02:29.790> passing<00:02:30.060> shot<00:02:30.450> away<00:02:30.630> from<00:02:30.989> me<00:02:31.110> which

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
to hit a passing shot away from me which

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:32.750 
to hit a passing shot away from me which
is<00:02:31.470> probably<00:02:31.980> what<00:02:32.280> they're<00:02:32.400> going<00:02:32.520> to<00:02:32.610> do

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
is probably what they're going to do

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.840 
is probably what they're going to do
okay<00:02:33.540> so<00:02:34.050> in<00:02:34.350> here<00:02:34.410> I've<00:02:35.100> got<00:02:35.400> into<00:02:35.640> a<00:02:35.670> good

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
okay so in here I've got into a good

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:37.760 
okay so in here I've got into a good
position<00:02:36.030> here<00:02:36.360> but<00:02:36.720> I've<00:02:36.810> taken<00:02:37.140> those<00:02:37.440> quick

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
position here but I've taken those quick

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.130 
position here but I've taken those quick
steps<00:02:38.130> to<00:02:38.370> get<00:02:38.550> there<00:02:38.760> okay<00:02:39.300> I<00:02:39.330> didn't<00:02:39.900> just

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
steps to get there okay I didn't just

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.370 
steps to get there okay I didn't just
hit<00:02:40.709> the<00:02:40.950> approach<00:02:41.310> I<00:02:41.610> okay<00:02:42.570> have<00:02:42.870> a<00:02:42.900> look<00:02:43.200> at

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
hit the approach I okay have a look at

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.470 
hit the approach I okay have a look at
where<00:02:43.530> the<00:02:43.709> balls<00:02:43.920> going<00:02:44.070> and<00:02:44.760> admire<00:02:45.120> it<00:02:45.360> and

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
where the balls going and admire it and

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.360 
where the balls going and admire it and
then<00:02:45.750> move<00:02:46.080> slowly<00:02:46.500> and<00:02:46.890> because<00:02:47.010> I'm<00:02:47.190> going

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
then move slowly and because I'm going

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.280 
then move slowly and because I'm going
to<00:02:47.430> get<00:02:47.610> trapped<00:02:48.030> here<00:02:48.420> at<00:02:48.510> the<00:02:48.630> service<00:02:49.050> line

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
to get trapped here at the service line

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.979 
to get trapped here at the service line
I<00:02:49.560> want<00:02:50.190> to<00:02:50.280> try<00:02:50.459> to<00:02:50.520> get<00:02:50.790> in<00:02:50.940> as<00:02:51.120> tight<00:02:51.780> on<00:02:51.900> the

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
I want to try to get in as tight on the

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:54.110 
I want to try to get in as tight on the
net<00:02:52.170> as<00:02:52.290> I<00:02:52.410> can<00:02:52.680> so<00:02:53.130> I<00:02:53.160> can<00:02:53.250> put<00:02:53.580> that<00:02:53.610> ball<00:02:54.000> away

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
net as I can so I can put that ball away

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.510 
net as I can so I can put that ball away
remember<00:02:55.020> approach<00:02:55.440> shot<00:02:55.739> it's<00:02:55.980> not<00:02:56.190> a<00:02:56.250> winner

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
remember approach shot it's not a winner

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.180 
remember approach shot it's not a winner
it's<00:02:57.330> a<00:02:57.480> set<00:02:57.750> up<00:02:57.900> all<00:02:58.140> for<00:02:58.470> me<00:02:58.590> to<00:02:58.709> put<00:02:58.890> the<00:02:59.010> ball

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
it's a set up all for me to put the ball

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.600 
it's a set up all for me to put the ball
low<00:02:59.340> with<00:02:59.520> an<00:02:59.640> easier<00:03:00.060> bolyar<00:03:00.510> and<00:03:00.630> overhead

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
low with an easier bolyar and overhead

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:05.180 
low with an easier bolyar and overhead
okay<00:03:02.610> so<00:03:02.930> difficult<00:03:03.930> to<00:03:04.170> do<00:03:04.350> this<00:03:04.560> difficult

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
okay so difficult to do this difficult

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.190 
okay so difficult to do this difficult
to<00:03:05.340> approach<00:03:05.730> and<00:03:06.090> put<00:03:06.600> the<00:03:06.720> volume<00:03:06.959> way

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
to approach and put the volume way

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.590 
to approach and put the volume way
effectively<00:03:07.860> it<00:03:07.980> takes<00:03:08.250> some<00:03:08.489> practice<00:03:08.670> but

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
effectively it takes some practice but

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.840 
effectively it takes some practice but
definitely<00:03:10.410> keep<00:03:10.709> trying<00:03:11.400> to<00:03:11.489> be<00:03:11.610> more

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
definitely keep trying to be more

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:13.430 
definitely keep trying to be more
aggressive<00:03:12.090> on<00:03:12.420> this<00:03:12.600> ball<00:03:12.840> because<00:03:13.230> you

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
aggressive on this ball because you

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.440 
aggressive on this ball because you
don't<00:03:13.920> want<00:03:14.100> to<00:03:14.160> be<00:03:14.310> stuck<00:03:14.640> playing<00:03:15.030> against

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
don't want to be stuck playing against

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.000 
don't want to be stuck playing against
players<00:03:15.690> that<00:03:15.989> are<00:03:16.080> hitting<00:03:16.380> the<00:03:16.440> ball<00:03:16.620> short

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
players that are hitting the ball short

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.070 
players that are hitting the ball short
all<00:03:17.220> day<00:03:17.459> and<00:03:17.700> you're<00:03:18.299> not<00:03:18.330> doing<00:03:18.720> anything

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
all day and you're not doing anything
