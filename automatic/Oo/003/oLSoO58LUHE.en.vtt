00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.850 
sides and we end up with a short little
piece<00:02:01.909> that<00:02:01.939> wouldn't<00:02:02.389> make<00:02:02.509> much<00:02:04.749> is<00:02:05.749> that

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
piece that wouldn't make much is that

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.700 
piece that wouldn't make much is that
this<00:02:07.400> handle<00:02:07.910> I'm<00:02:08.149> tucking<00:02:08.840> it<00:02:09.110> into<00:02:09.259> my<00:02:09.500> body
