 working with them during our year 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:54.519

 for our team during this time 

00:00:57.339 --> 00:01:03.909
 girls ages 9 to 14 are taken to 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:06.790
 to test their elasticity to improve 

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:09.159
 the technical quality of the movements are 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:11.560
 seven hours of training a day 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:13.840
 hence the current technician years ago 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:16.840
 she intends to pass on the girls to 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:19.330
 accuracy of the movements and expects 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:22.300
 contribute to the growth and 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:25.030
 algae enhancement girls 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:28.390
 were selected to attend the course 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:32.530
 are future talents here from the state as 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:34.300
 the gymnast fernanda and in 2012 was champion 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.010
 in the masses 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.320
 I hope it's a course that will have a 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:41.530
 bring good growth as a gymnast 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:44.290
 some experience as 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:46.330
 the culture that we receive from the 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:47.650
 comes from bulgaria which is a sport is a 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:51.130
 place where we think it's very 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:54.159
 strong and also bring an improvement 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:56.920
 we for competitions improve the 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:59.380
 holidays and it has only been a week since the 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.060
 technique came to the state but the changes 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.409
 are already visible 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:06.549
 we already noticed changed his 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:08.170
 significant even in the form of 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:11.140
 execution of the movement the most 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:15.489
 technique, the children have already 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:17.110
 are already having a different level and 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:19.959
 perfection a movement in a modality 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:22.810
 that perfection is always welcome and it is 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:26.080
 Of course girls expect to suck the most 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:28.959
 from the experience of the Bulgarian champion them 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:31.720
 better parts and maneuvers compete better 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:33.519
 experience and also learn 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.660
 new things that we plant that 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:35.920
 at the time of competing 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:39.370
 We're training a little more 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:42.160
 hard is being better and is there in the future 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:45.710
 so do not be a better gymnast than 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:48.710
 This is coming around well. 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:48.710
 Hmm 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:59.170
 I enjoyed the Bulgarian teacher here 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:04.160
 and I was here learning some moves 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:08.960
 I'm there under the table and organic 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:11.810
 Only, I'll never go, people. 

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:13.580
 leave here with the girls and 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.810
 I hope everyone does. 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:17.150
 holy spirit that girls can 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.690
 shine and bring more victories to the 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.690

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:28.770
