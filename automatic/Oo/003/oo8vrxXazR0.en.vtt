actually<00:00:22.740> going<00:00:23.070> a<00:00:23.189> little<00:00:23.310> bit<00:00:23.460> faster<00:00:23.670> than

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
actually going a little bit faster than

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.849 
actually going a little bit faster than
I<00:00:24.090> imagined<00:00:24.600> because<00:00:24.750> I<00:00:24.900> thought<00:00:25.260> getting<00:00:25.680> to

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
I imagined because I thought getting to

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.109 
I imagined because I thought getting to
a<00:00:25.890> thousand<00:00:26.220> subscribers<00:00:26.340> was<00:00:26.789> gonna<00:00:26.910> take<00:00:27.090> a

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
a thousand subscribers was gonna take a

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.519 
a thousand subscribers was gonna take a
very<00:00:27.359> long<00:00:27.420> time<00:00:27.570> but<00:00:27.960> I<00:00:28.050> think<00:00:28.289> it's<00:00:28.380> actually

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
very long time but I think it's actually

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.710 
very long time but I think it's actually
good<00:00:28.769> to<00:00:28.830> get<00:00:28.949> here<00:00:29.220> a<00:00:29.369> lot<00:00:29.730> sooner<00:00:29.789> so<00:00:30.689> I

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
good to get here a lot sooner so I

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.810 
good to get here a lot sooner so I
thought<00:00:31.230> I<00:00:31.439> could<00:00:31.619> make<00:00:31.650> a<00:00:31.800> special<00:00:32.250> video<00:00:32.369> and

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
thought I could make a special video and

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.139 
thought I could make a special video and
unbox<00:00:33.660> a<00:00:34.020> new<00:00:34.590> mic<00:00:34.800> that<00:00:34.950> I<00:00:35.040> just<00:00:35.280> bought<00:00:35.460> and<00:00:35.969> I

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:45.050 
guess blue snowball building like this

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:47.830 
guess blue snowball building like this
yes<00:03:45.800> that's<00:03:46.340> how<00:03:46.490> it<00:03:46.610> goes<00:03:46.730> I<00:03:47.030> don't<00:03:47.660> know<00:03:47.720> if

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 
yes that's how it goes I don't know if

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.610 
yes that's how it goes I don't know if
you<00:03:47.960> screw<00:03:48.260> it<00:03:48.350> on<00:03:48.470> or<00:03:49.600> actually<00:03:50.600> I<00:03:50.630> think<00:03:50.720> I'm

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620 
you screw it on or actually I think I'm

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:54.790 
you screw it on or actually I think I'm
really<00:03:51.740> not<00:03:51.920> sure<00:03:53.290> okay<00:03:54.290> that's<00:03:54.500> how<00:03:54.590> it<00:03:54.710> goes

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:54.800 
really not sure okay that's how it goes

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.860 
really not sure okay that's how it goes
alright<00:03:55.040> yeah<00:03:55.790> you<00:03:56.030> just<00:03:56.150> screw<00:03:56.510> it<00:03:56.600> on<00:03:56.690> like

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:56.870 
alright yeah you just screw it on like

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:00.010 
alright yeah you just screw it on like
this<00:03:57.140> and<00:03:57.500> I<00:03:58.220> guess<00:03:58.490> that's<00:03:59.180> just<00:03:59.270> a<00:03:59.510> general

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:00.020 
this and I guess that's just a general

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:02.290 
this and I guess that's just a general
idea<00:04:00.170> of<00:04:00.440> the<00:04:00.560> blue<00:04:00.770> snowball<00:04:01.040> um<00:04:01.400> you<00:04:02.060> can't

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060 
of like just straight like facing this

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:09.880 
of like just straight like facing this
way<00:04:08.120> you<00:04:08.330> can't<00:04:08.630> move<00:04:08.810> it<00:04:08.930> up<00:04:09.080> or<00:04:09.320> down<00:04:09.560> kind<00:04:09.860> of
