00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.330 
that first part of the stitch and then
you<00:00:45.899> grab<00:00:46.260> your<00:00:47.180> yarn<00:00:48.180> from<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.600> fall<00:00:49.379> that's

bit of this off to the right and now

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.560 
bit of this off to the right and now
we'll<00:01:03.329> do<00:01:03.420> another<00:01:03.660> net<00:01:03.989> stitch<00:01:05.090> go<00:01:06.090> in<00:01:06.270> there

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.840 
we'll do another net stitch go in there
to<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.110> right<00:01:08.030> wrap<00:01:09.030> it<00:01:09.360> pull<00:01:10.400> it<00:01:11.400> through<00:01:11.640> to

the<00:01:12.000> left<00:01:12.680> and<00:01:13.680> then<00:01:13.860> take<00:01:14.070> it<00:01:14.220> up<00:01:15.770> just<00:01:16.770> do

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
the left and then take it up just do

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.330

stitch all the way across the row and

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.740 
stitch all the way across the row and
after<00:01:25.500> a<00:01:25.710> while<00:01:25.920> you'll<00:01:26.310> just<00:01:27.290> start<00:01:28.290> to<00:01:28.439> flow

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 
after a while you'll just start to flow

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.010 
after a while you'll just start to flow
it<00:01:30.750> won't<00:01:30.990> be<00:01:31.170> hard<00:01:31.409> work<00:01:31.680> at<00:01:31.890> all

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
it won't be hard work at all

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:39.260 
it won't be hard work at all
if<00:01:34.020> you<00:01:34.229> have<00:01:34.409> arthritis<00:01:34.710> like<00:01:35.490> I<00:01:35.729> did<00:01:38.270> don't

hold this yarn too tight

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.249 
hold this yarn too tight
what<00:01:41.430> I<00:01:41.460> usually<00:01:42.090> do<00:01:42.509> is<00:01:42.659> I<00:01:42.689> wrapped<00:01:43.049> around

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
what I usually do is I wrapped around

that pinky and I bring this finger up
like<00:01:46.259> this<00:01:46.740> and<00:01:47.390> I<00:01:48.390> let<00:01:48.720> the<00:01:48.930> yarn<00:01:49.200> flow

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
like this and I let the yarn flow

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.450 
like this and I let the yarn flow
through<00:01:50.610> my<00:01:50.820> fingers<00:01:51.530> as<00:01:52.530> I<00:01:52.829> work<00:01:53.130> I<00:01:53.399> don't

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
through my fingers as I work I don't

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.730 
through my fingers as I work I don't
hold<00:01:53.820> it<00:01:53.939> really<00:01:54.210> tight<00:01:54.390> if<00:01:55.110> you<00:01:55.229> hold<00:01:55.439> it<00:01:55.530> too

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
hold it really tight if you hold it too

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.609 
hold it really tight if you hold it too
tight<00:01:56.159> it<00:01:57.060> took<00:01:57.299> health<00:01:57.600> some<00:01:57.899> pain<00:01:58.259> if<00:01:58.590> you

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
tight it took health some pain if you

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.399 
tight it took health some pain if you
have<00:01:58.770> arthritis<00:01:59.310> like<00:01:59.700> I<00:01:59.909> did<00:02:00.180> and<00:02:01.170> you've

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
have arthritis like I did and you've

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.740 
have arthritis like I did and you've
young<00:02:01.680> people<00:02:02.100> out<00:02:02.219> there<00:02:02.490> you<00:02:02.700> can<00:02:02.909> lie<00:02:03.689> and

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
young people out there you can lie and

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.490 
young people out there you can lie and
hold<00:02:04.590> it<00:02:04.680> as<00:02:04.799> tight<00:02:05.070> as<00:02:05.100> you<00:02:05.280> want<00:02:05.430> right<00:02:06.500> just

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
hold it as tight as you want right just

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.080 
hold it as tight as you want right just
be<00:02:07.649> careful<00:02:07.680> not<00:02:08.129> to<00:02:08.369> do<00:02:08.459> it<00:02:08.580> too<00:02:08.819> tight

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
be careful not to do it too tight

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.080 
be careful not to do it too tight
because<00:02:09.800> if<00:02:10.800> you<00:02:10.979> make<00:02:11.160> your<00:02:11.370> stitches<00:02:11.670> too

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
because if you make your stitches too

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.280 
because if you make your stitches too
tight

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
tight

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.959 
tight
then<00:02:13.799> they're<00:02:14.250> hard<00:02:14.610> to<00:02:14.879> work<00:02:15.890> each<00:02:16.890> ray<00:02:17.280> it's

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:17.969 
then they're hard to work each ray it's

00:02:17.969 --> 00:02:20.750 
then they're hard to work each ray it's
a<00:02:18.090> little<00:02:18.329> bit<00:02:18.450> harder<00:02:18.840> to<00:02:19.049> work<00:02:19.519> so<00:02:20.519> it<00:02:20.579> was

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
a little bit harder to work so it was

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.740 
a little bit harder to work so it was
better<00:02:21.299> to<00:02:21.510> let<00:02:21.629> the<00:02:21.810> stitches<00:02:23.090> work<00:02:24.090> smoothly

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
better to let the stitches work smoothly

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.530 
better to let the stitches work smoothly
let<00:02:25.230> the<00:02:25.379> yarn<00:02:25.650> flow<00:02:26.099> so<00:02:26.579> that's<00:02:26.790> how<00:02:27.090> to<00:02:27.120> do

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
let the yarn flow so that's how to do

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.679 
let the yarn flow so that's how to do
the<00:02:27.719> knit<00:02:27.840> stitch<00:02:28.730> and<00:02:29.730> so<00:02:29.939> we'll<00:02:30.120> finish<00:02:30.359> all

00:02:30.679 --> 00:02:30.689 
the knit stitch and so we'll finish all

00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:35.360 
the knit stitch and so we'll finish all
of<00:02:30.870> that<00:02:31.370> and<00:02:32.370> I've<00:02:33.180> only<00:02:33.689> got<00:02:33.989> like<00:02:34.370> 22

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:41.639 
37 I did a smaller version so I'm gonna

00:02:41.639 --> 00:02:43.399

end<00:02:43.560> of<00:02:43.650> this<00:02:43.769> way<00:02:44.099> let<00:02:44.639> you<00:02:44.819> see<00:02:45.090> how<00:02:45.359> it<00:02:46.290> ends

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:56.989 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:00.170 

I'm<00:02:57.989> gonna<00:02:58.169> have<00:02:58.409> one<00:02:58.680> stitch<00:02:59.159> left<00:02:59.189> so<00:03:00.000> you're

doing the right side of that pull it
through<00:03:03.930> and<00:03:04.620> your<00:03:04.829> last<00:03:05.040> stitch<00:03:06.049> might<00:03:07.049> look

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:07.319 
through and your last stitch might look

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:09.440 
through and your last stitch might look
real<00:03:07.590> loose<00:03:07.980> like<00:03:08.400> mine<00:03:08.700> does<00:03:09.000> but<00:03:09.269> don't

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450

00:04:08.839 --> 00:04:08.849 
take this back and tighten it up don't

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:12.589 
take this back and tighten it up don't
do<00:04:09.120> that<00:04:09.329> because<00:04:09.629> if<00:04:09.900> you<00:04:10.019> do<00:04:11.090> you<00:04:12.090> make<00:04:12.269> two

00:04:12.589 --> 00:04:12.599 
do that because if you do you make two

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:17.569 
do that because if you do you make two
loops<00:04:13.159> to<00:04:14.159> work<00:04:14.400> and<00:04:14.930> that<00:04:16.130> makes<00:04:17.130> you<00:04:17.400> have

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:17.579 
loops to work and that makes you have

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:20.180 
loops to work and that makes you have
too<00:04:17.789> many<00:04:17.909> stitches<00:04:18.389> so<00:04:19.380> leave<00:04:19.590> this<00:04:19.859> yarn

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
too many stitches so leave this yarn

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.879 
too many stitches so leave this yarn
down<00:04:20.659> and<00:04:21.659> leave<00:04:21.840> that<00:04:22.049> loop<00:04:22.289> hanging<00:04:22.560> loose

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:22.889 
down and leave that loop hanging loose

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:25.120 
down and leave that loop hanging loose
don't<00:04:23.880> worry<00:04:24.180> about<00:04:24.330> it

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.130 
don't worry about it

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:28.450 
don't worry about it
you<00:04:25.370> know<00:04:25.520> it'll<00:04:26.060> fix<00:04:26.270> itself<00:04:26.480> as<00:04:26.960> you<00:04:27.110> work<00:04:27.460> so

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:28.460 
you know it'll fix itself as you work so

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:31.240 
you know it'll fix itself as you work so
now<00:04:28.700> as<00:04:29.240> you're<00:04:29.510> making<00:04:30.020> your<00:04:30.200> first<00:04:30.500> stitch

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:35.270 
pull it a little snug since that yarn is

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:38.380 
pull it a little snug since that yarn is
kind<00:04:35.510> of<00:04:35.570> loose<00:04:35.930> there<00:04:36.610> and<00:04:37.610> then<00:04:37.880> just<00:04:38.150> keep

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:38.390 
kind of loose there and then just keep

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:40.240 
kind of loose there and then just keep
working<00:04:38.960> and<00:04:39.110> always<00:04:39.470> going<00:04:39.680> in<00:04:39.920> the<00:04:40.040> right
