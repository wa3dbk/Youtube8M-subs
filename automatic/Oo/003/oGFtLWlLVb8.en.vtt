00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:07.090
 We will work the next color in 

00:00:02.769 --> 00:00:10.090
 any point, let's start 

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:10.090
 we raise 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:14.980
 our first whole on any 

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:14.980
 of the integers 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:23.820
 ok three chains do not replace the first 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:27.580
 whole ok now we are going to add a 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.359
 then let's do whole 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:31.980
 chains 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:34.130
 whole 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.320
 every 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:38.750
 whole 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.510
 chain in the only place that we're not going to 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.579
 do that is in the last 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.850
 the last and the first we will knit 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:49.840
 together 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:52.480
 in half we weave the last the first 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:55.650
 protect with half and close it 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:58.370
 together and there we make head 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:01.950
 let's start then number 2 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:05.309
 from number 2 to number 8 we will knit 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:08.299
 whole chains 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.299
 whole 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.900
 chain 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:17.520
 whole 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:19.590
 chain so let's weave the 7's 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.329
 center 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.329
 ok we still need a little bit 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:33.320
 when we get to number 9 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:35.479
 and we have weave 7 integers and string 1 2 3 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:39.120
 4 5 6 7 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:41.580
 ok when we get to 9 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:44.370
 we make the whole point halfway 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:48.840
 the next one we're going to make the point 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:51.510
 whole in half we close them together and 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.340
 do it again so let's chain 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:57.399
 make our beginnings and finals 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:59.350
 so that we stay together then we 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:02.590
 will be 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:05.009
 look, we have a little wave with start and 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:08.140
 so let's continue working 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:10.300
 until also again finishing this 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:13.230
 row we see each other when we have 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.230
 finished the row
