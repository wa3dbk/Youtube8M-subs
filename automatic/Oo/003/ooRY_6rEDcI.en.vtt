so<00:00:52.020> one<00:00:52.170> of<00:00:52.199> the<00:00:52.320> biggest<00:00:52.469> mistakes<00:00:52.920> that<00:00:53.010> I

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
so one of the biggest mistakes that I

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.069 
so one of the biggest mistakes that I
see<00:00:53.190> people<00:00:53.340> make<00:00:53.789> especially<00:00:54.180> females<00:00:54.840> is

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
see people make especially females is

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.930 
see people make especially females is
that<00:00:55.230> they<00:00:55.739> decide<00:00:56.100> that<00:00:56.129> in<00:00:56.460> order<00:00:56.670> to<00:00:56.699> lose

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
that they decide that in order to lose

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.580 
that they decide that in order to lose
weight<00:00:56.969> or<00:00:57.539> in<00:00:57.840> order<00:00:58.020> to<00:00:58.079> get<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.289> body<00:00:58.469> I

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
weight or in order to get the body I

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.410 
weight or in order to get the body I
want<00:00:58.920> I'm<00:00:59.070> going<00:00:59.250> to<00:00:59.309> really<00:00:59.699> deplete<00:01:00.239> and

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
want I'm going to really deplete and

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.000 
want I'm going to really deplete and
deprive<00:01:00.719> myself<00:01:00.930> of<00:01:01.230> calories<00:01:01.800> and

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
deprive myself of calories and

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.670 
deprive myself of calories and
eventually<00:01:02.760> what<00:01:02.910> ends<00:01:03.120> up<00:01:03.180> happening<00:01:03.239> is<00:01:03.870> the

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
eventually what ends up happening is the

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.399 
eventually what ends up happening is the
body<00:01:04.979> gets<00:01:05.280> upset<00:01:05.729> and<00:01:06.000> that<00:01:06.750> is<00:01:06.960> really

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
body gets upset and that is really

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:08.870 
body gets upset and that is really
really<00:01:07.560> due<00:01:07.799> to<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.010> fact<00:01:08.250> that<00:01:08.369> they've<00:01:08.610> gone

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
really due to the fact that they've gone

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.330 
really due to the fact that they've gone
through<00:01:08.939> a<00:01:09.240> long<00:01:09.810> period<00:01:10.409> of<00:01:10.740> dieting<00:01:11.220> and

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
they've never replenished what they've

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.590 
they've never replenished what they've
kind<00:01:13.650> of<00:01:13.710> burned<00:01:13.979> through<00:01:14.250> and<00:01:14.460> so<00:01:14.610> one<00:01:15.360> of<00:01:15.479> the

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
kind of burned through and so one of the

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.719

day per week that's a very very high

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.800 
day per week that's a very very high
carbohydrate<00:01:25.920> meal<00:01:26.130> by<00:01:26.759> doing<00:01:27.270> this<00:01:27.450> it

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
carbohydrate meal by doing this it

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.109 
carbohydrate meal by doing this it
affects<00:01:28.200> your<00:01:28.320> leptin<00:01:28.710> levels<00:01:29.100> and<00:01:29.280> leptin<00:01:29.939> is

affects your leptin levels and leptin is
a<00:01:30.150> hormone<00:01:30.240> that<00:01:30.659> is<00:01:30.900> released<00:01:31.079> that<00:01:31.500> tells

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
a hormone that is released that tells

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.670 
a hormone that is released that tells
the<00:01:32.130> brain<00:01:32.369> I'm<00:01:32.700> full<00:01:33.329> well<00:01:34.259> when<00:01:34.500> you

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
the brain I'm full well when you

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.700 
the brain I'm full well when you
basically<00:01:35.280> diet<00:01:35.759> for<00:01:36.750> long<00:01:37.049> periods<00:01:37.560> of<00:01:37.619> time

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
basically diet for long periods of time

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.219 
basically diet for long periods of time
there's<00:01:38.520> interference<00:01:38.850> it<00:01:39.390> doesn't<00:01:39.990> work

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
there's interference it doesn't work

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.499 
there's interference it doesn't work
properly<00:01:40.500> and<00:01:41.070> so<00:01:41.400> that's<00:01:41.759> another<00:01:42.180> reason

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
properly and so that's another reason

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.170 
properly and so that's another reason
why<00:01:42.960> I<00:01:42.990> recommend<00:01:43.979> this<00:01:44.130> high<00:01:44.430> calorie<00:01:45.030> high

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
why I recommend this high calorie high

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.450 
why I recommend this high calorie high

basically<00:01:58.560> choose<00:01:59.009> the<00:01:59.610> exact<00:02:00.000> goal<00:02:00.270> that<00:02:00.479> you

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
basically choose the exact goal that you

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.270 
basically choose the exact goal that you
want<00:02:00.810> so<00:02:01.049> there's<00:02:01.259> two<00:02:01.469> goals<00:02:01.710> shred<00:02:02.070> and

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
want so there's two goals shred and

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.330 
want so there's two goals shred and
build<00:02:02.520> with<00:02:02.759> the<00:02:02.880> shred<00:02:03.240> nutrition<00:02:03.840> program

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
build with the shred nutrition program

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.530 
build with the shred nutrition program
obviously<00:02:05.340> it's<00:02:05.460> going<00:02:05.549> to<00:02:05.610> shred<00:02:05.939> body<00:02:06.240> fat

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
obviously it's going to shred body fat

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:07.980 
obviously it's going to shred body fat
but<00:02:06.719> you're<00:02:06.869> also<00:02:07.049> going<00:02:07.380> to<00:02:07.439> see<00:02:07.500> in

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990 
but you're also going to see in

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.320 
but you're also going to see in
movement<00:02:08.289> and<00:02:08.440> lean<00:02:08.590> muscle<00:02:09.009> definition<00:02:09.330> with

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
movement and lean muscle definition with

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.150 
movement and lean muscle definition with
the<00:02:10.450> build<00:02:10.720> program<00:02:11.290> you're<00:02:11.920> going<00:02:12.099> to

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
the build program you're going to

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.550 
the build program you're going to
obviously<00:02:12.550> build<00:02:12.940> lean<00:02:13.150> muscle<00:02:13.180> and<00:02:13.780> you<00:02:14.290> will

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
obviously build lean muscle and you will

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.010 
obviously build lean muscle and you will
see<00:02:14.770> a<00:02:14.800> slight<00:02:15.099> reduction<00:02:15.340> in<00:02:15.730> in<00:02:16.330> body<00:02:16.720> fat

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
see a slight reduction in in body fat

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.290 
see a slight reduction in in body fat
but<00:02:17.319> the<00:02:17.590> goal<00:02:17.800> is<00:02:18.010> really<00:02:18.220> to<00:02:18.340> pack<00:02:18.730> on<00:02:18.970> size

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
but the goal is really to pack on size

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.960 
but the goal is really to pack on size
and<00:02:19.630> so<00:02:20.470> with<00:02:20.920> the<00:02:21.040> shred<00:02:21.340> program<00:02:21.520> you're

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
and so with the shred program you're

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.759 
and so with the shred program you're
doing<00:02:22.239> four<00:02:22.599> meals<00:02:22.959> per<00:02:23.770> day<00:02:23.800> plus<00:02:24.700> a

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:25.769 
doing four meals per day plus a

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:28.890 
doing four meals per day plus a
post-workout<00:02:26.769> shake<00:02:26.830> and<00:02:27.459> a<00:02:28.180> post-workout

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
post-workout shake and a post-workout

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.330 
post-workout shake and a post-workout
meal<00:02:30.989> so<00:02:31.989> on<00:02:32.110> the<00:02:32.230> build<00:02:32.440> nutrition<00:02:32.980> program

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
meal so on the build nutrition program

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.089 
meal so on the build nutrition program
you're<00:02:33.519> doing<00:02:33.790> five<00:02:34.180> core<00:02:34.660> meals<00:02:34.989> a<00:02:35.200> day<00:02:35.230> plus

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:36.099 
you're doing five core meals a day plus

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:38.790 
you're doing five core meals a day plus
a<00:02:36.280> post-workout<00:02:36.940> shake<00:02:37.000> a<00:02:37.540> post-workout<00:02:38.500> meal

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
a post-workout shake a post-workout meal

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.770 
a post-workout shake a post-workout meal
and<00:02:39.099> then<00:02:39.220> there<00:02:39.370> is<00:02:39.459> also<00:02:39.640> one<00:02:40.120> additional

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
and then there is also one additional

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:45.000 
and then there is also one additional
