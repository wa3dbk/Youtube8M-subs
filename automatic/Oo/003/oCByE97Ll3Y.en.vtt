worth<00:01:30.990> supporting<00:01:32.180> because<00:01:33.740> these<00:01:34.740> are

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
worth supporting because these are

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.440 
worth supporting because these are

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:14.700 
so after an initial listen I'm very

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:18.110

pleased that the new album is actually

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:21.020 
pleased that the new album is actually
their<00:06:18.240> heaviest<00:06:18.600> rock<00:06:19.729> sounding<00:06:20.729> album

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:21.030 
their heaviest rock sounding album

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:24.170 
their heaviest rock sounding album
they're<00:06:21.900> not<00:06:22.050> really<00:06:22.440> a<00:06:22.979> strong<00:06:23.610> rock<00:06:23.880> band

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:24.180 
they're not really a strong rock band

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:27.830 
they're not really a strong rock band
they're<00:06:24.600> more<00:06:24.840> pop<00:06:25.110> rock<00:06:26.030> but<00:06:27.030> this<00:06:27.600> one's

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:27.840 
they're more pop rock but this one's

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:29.780 
they're more pop rock but this one's
actually<00:06:27.990> pretty<00:06:28.410> heavy<00:06:28.710> they've<00:06:29.340> gone<00:06:29.550> for<00:06:29.760> a

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:29.790 
actually pretty heavy they've gone for a

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:31.820 
actually pretty heavy they've gone for a
bit<00:06:29.940> of<00:06:29.970> a<00:06:30.150> rock<00:06:30.330> image<00:06:30.840> and<00:06:31.229> some<00:06:31.710> of<00:06:31.770> the

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:31.830 
bit of a rock image and some of the

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:36.050 
bit of a rock image and some of the
tracks<00:06:32.130> are<00:06:32.660> reminiscent<00:06:33.660> of<00:06:34.430> more<00:06:35.430> classical

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:36.060 
tracks are reminiscent of more classical

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:39.350 
tracks are reminiscent of more classical
rock<00:06:36.300> bands<00:06:37.820> because<00:06:38.820> that's<00:06:39.000> one<00:06:39.180> of<00:06:39.270> my

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:39.360 
rock bands because that's one of my

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:42.379 
rock bands because that's one of my
concerns<00:06:39.389> because<00:06:40.169> I'm<00:06:41.060> worried<00:06:42.060> about<00:06:42.210> their

00:06:42.379 --> 00:06:42.389 
concerns because I'm worried about their

00:06:42.389 --> 00:06:44.840 
concerns because I'm worried about their
Japanese<00:06:42.810> industry<00:06:43.520> turning<00:06:44.520> them<00:06:44.699> into

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:44.850 
Japanese industry turning them into

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:48.409 
Japanese industry turning them into
