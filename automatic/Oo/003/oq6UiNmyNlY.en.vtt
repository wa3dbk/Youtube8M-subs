take when you launch and shut down your
activity<00:06:23.200> typically<00:06:24.200> these<00:06:24.410> involve<00:06:24.740> turning

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:25.010 
activity typically these involve turning

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:27.940 
activity typically these involve turning

on or off the power to your devices you

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:29.980 
on or off the power to your devices you
might<00:06:28.160> also<00:06:28.370> need<00:06:28.700> to<00:06:28.880> add<00:06:29.030> an<00:06:29.360> action<00:06:29.540> or<00:06:29.840> two

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:29.990 
might also need to add an action or two

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:33.460 
might also need to add an action or two
for<00:06:30.980> example<00:06:31.430> when<00:06:32.000> I<00:06:32.030> watch<00:06:32.330> a<00:06:32.450> DVD<00:06:32.750> I<00:06:33.050> need<00:06:33.380> to

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:33.470 
for example when I watch a DVD I need to

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:36.430 
for example when I watch a DVD I need to
switch<00:06:33.680> the<00:06:33.710> TV<00:06:34.220> to<00:06:34.460> the<00:06:34.490> HDMI<00:06:35.180> one<00:06:35.450> input<00:06:35.660> so

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:36.440 
switch the TV to the HDMI one input so

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:39.130 
switch the TV to the HDMI one input so
I'll<00:06:36.650> add<00:06:36.860> that<00:06:36.890> now<00:06:37.660> once<00:06:38.660> you're<00:06:38.840> launched

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:39.140 
I'll add that now once you're launched
