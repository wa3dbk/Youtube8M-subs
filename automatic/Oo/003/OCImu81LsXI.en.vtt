do is do then you would do three half
hitch<00:02:05.030> knots<00:02:05.300> after<00:02:05.750> the<00:02:05.870> bead<00:02:06.050> to<00:02:06.320> secure<00:02:06.890> it

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:07.010 
hitch knots after the bead to secure it

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:08.949 
hitch knots after the bead to secure it
into<00:02:07.130> place<00:02:07.250> on<00:02:07.610> the<00:02:07.670> ring<00:02:07.940> that's<00:02:08.509> correct

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
into place on the ring that's correct

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:11.040 
into place on the ring that's correct
yes<00:02:09.519> all<00:02:10.519> right

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:19.490 
and then two and you could use different

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:22.240 
and then two and you could use different
weights<00:02:19.850> of<00:02:20.030> cord<00:02:20.300> to<00:02:20.570> with<00:02:21.440> this<00:02:21.590> type<00:02:21.770> of<00:02:21.800> job

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
weights of cord to with this type of job

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.200 
weights of cord to with this type of job
yeah<00:02:22.730> this<00:02:23.000> is<00:02:23.180> a<00:02:23.210> 4-ply<00:02:24.760> Irish<00:02:25.760> waxed<00:02:26.120> linen

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:26.210 
yeah this is a 4-ply Irish waxed linen

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:30.520 
yeah this is a 4-ply Irish waxed linen
cord<00:02:26.390> that<00:02:26.990> I<00:02:27.200> use<00:02:28.360> for<00:02:29.360> most<00:02:29.540> of<00:02:29.810> for<00:02:30.200> most<00:02:30.380> of

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
cord that I use for most of for most of

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.620 
cord that I use for most of for most of
what<00:02:30.650> I<00:02:30.680> do<00:02:30.800> I<00:02:31.280> use<00:02:31.610> the<00:02:31.790> four<00:02:31.970> ply<00:02:32.180> but<00:02:32.420> you<00:02:32.510> can

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
what I do I use the four ply but you can

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.040 
what I do I use the four ply but you can
also<00:02:32.750> get<00:02:32.990> it<00:02:33.140> in<00:02:33.200> 2<00:02:33.440> pi<00:02:33.680> and<00:02:33.890> 3<00:02:34.070> ply<00:02:34.370> and<00:02:35.050> comes

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
also get it in 2 pi and 3 ply and comes

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.160 
also get it in 2 pi and 3 ply and comes
in<00:02:36.200> all<00:02:36.290> kinds<00:02:36.470> of<00:02:36.650> different<00:02:37.540> thicknesses<00:02:38.540> so

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
in all kinds of different thicknesses so

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:40.390 
in all kinds of different thicknesses so
once<00:02:39.410> you've<00:02:39.560> done<00:02:39.770> that<00:02:39.830> and<00:02:40.040> you've<00:02:40.280> gone

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
once you've done that and you've gone

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.460 
once you've done that and you've gone
all<00:02:40.610> the<00:02:40.760> way<00:02:40.850> around<00:02:41.120> the<00:02:41.240> ring<00:02:41.420> you'll<00:02:42.260> have

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
all the way around the ring you'll have

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.250 
all the way around the ring you'll have
something<00:02:42.709> that<00:02:42.860> looks<00:02:43.070> like<00:02:43.190> this<00:02:43.580> and<00:02:44.390> then

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
something that looks like this and then

a great little hanger and you could put

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:49.330 
a great little hanger and you could put
a<00:03:46.630> larger<00:03:47.630> bead<00:03:47.780> there<00:03:47.959> too<00:03:48.200> or<00:03:48.860> a<00:03:48.890> small<00:03:49.160> if

the six and fours together I know - yeah
a<00:03:55.489> little<00:03:56.269> bit<00:03:56.390> of<00:03:56.480> variation<00:03:56.840> in<00:03:57.290> the<00:03:57.470> size

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:57.920 
a little bit of variation in the size

head<00:04:30.500> knot<00:04:32.919> onto<00:04:33.919> the<00:04:34.040> ring<00:04:34.220> here<00:04:34.610> alright<00:04:35.120> so

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:35.419 
head knot onto the ring here alright so

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:37.629 
head knot onto the ring here alright so
you'd<00:04:35.570> put<00:04:35.840> one<00:04:36.080> strand<00:04:36.680> I<00:04:36.800> always<00:04:37.070> kind<00:04:37.340> of<00:04:37.400> do

00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:37.639 
you'd put one strand I always kind of do

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:39.550 
you'd put one strand I always kind of do
one<00:04:38.150> strand<00:04:38.510> at<00:04:38.630> a<00:04:38.720> time<00:04:38.750> here<00:04:39.169> because<00:04:39.290> it's

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:39.560 
one strand at a time here because it's

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:42.159 
one strand at a time here because it's
they're<00:04:40.340> uneven<00:04:40.730> yeah<00:04:41.270> they're<00:04:41.480> uneven<00:04:41.780> there

00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:42.169 
they're uneven yeah they're uneven there

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:45.600 
they're uneven yeah they're uneven there
so<00:04:42.500> then<00:04:43.370> what<00:04:43.580> you<00:04:43.669> would<00:04:43.820> do<00:04:44.000> is<00:04:44.240> instead<00:04:44.750> of

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:45.610 
so then what you would do is instead of

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:49.000 
so then what you would do is instead of
doing<00:04:46.610> that<00:04:47.540> not<00:04:47.870> like<00:04:48.320> we<00:04:48.470> did<00:04:48.740> with<00:04:48.950> the

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:49.010 
doing that not like we did with the

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:50.740 
doing that not like we did with the
short<00:04:49.340> piece<00:04:49.550> we'd<00:04:49.760> actually<00:04:49.970> string<00:04:50.480> a<00:04:50.540> bead

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:50.750 
short piece we'd actually string a bead

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:53.920 
short piece we'd actually string a bead
onto<00:04:51.200> this<00:04:51.530> one<00:04:51.800> oh<00:04:52.300> so<00:04:53.300> the<00:04:53.389> beat<00:04:53.540> goes<00:04:53.720> onto

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:53.930 
onto this one oh so the beat goes onto

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:56.110 
onto this one oh so the beat goes onto
your<00:04:54.169> short<00:04:54.470> strand<00:04:54.800> that's<00:04:55.040> right<00:04:55.520> for<00:04:56.030> this

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:56.120 
your short strand that's right for this

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:57.940 
your short strand that's right for this
one<00:04:56.180> yep<00:04:56.630> and<00:04:56.930> you're<00:04:57.080> stringing<00:04:57.350> on<00:04:57.500> and<00:04:57.830> then

00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:57.950 
one yep and you're stringing on and then

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:59.650 
one yep and you're stringing on and then
you<00:04:58.010> want<00:04:58.190> to<00:04:58.220> tie<00:04:58.430> an<00:04:58.580> overhand<00:04:58.760> knot<00:04:59.240> right

00:04:59.650 --> 00:04:59.660 
you want to tie an overhand knot right

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:04.210 
you want to tie an overhand knot right
after<00:05:00.080> the<00:05:00.200> bead<00:05:01.750> just<00:05:02.750> like<00:05:02.930> this<00:05:03.320> over<00:05:03.950> and

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:04.220 
after the bead just like this over and

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:05.890 
after the bead just like this over and
then<00:05:04.400> you<00:05:04.520> want<00:05:04.669> to<00:05:04.700> get<00:05:04.880> this<00:05:05.030> close<00:05:05.360> to<00:05:05.419> the

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:05.900 
then you want to get this close to the

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:08.680 
then you want to get this close to the
bead<00:05:06.080> as<00:05:06.410> you<00:05:06.590> can<00:05:07.090> so<00:05:08.090> you're<00:05:08.240> really<00:05:08.360> holding

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:08.690 
bead as you can so you're really holding

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:11.680 
bead as you can so you're really holding
it<00:05:08.810> in<00:05:08.930> place<00:05:09.130> yeah<00:05:10.130> we<00:05:10.940> didn't<00:05:11.180> hurts<00:05:11.360> become

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:11.690 
it in place yeah we didn't hurts become

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:13.420 
it in place yeah we didn't hurts become
part<00:05:11.930> of<00:05:12.050> the<00:05:12.169> fringe<00:05:12.380> then<00:05:12.740> this<00:05:12.980> time<00:05:13.190> that's

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:13.430 
part of the fringe then this time that's

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:16.659 
part of the fringe then this time that's
right<00:05:13.820> there<00:05:14.270> dangling<00:05:14.990> too<00:05:15.320> and<00:05:15.770> then<00:05:16.430> you

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:16.669 
right there dangling too and then you

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:19.270 
right there dangling too and then you
would<00:05:16.820> do<00:05:16.970> those<00:05:17.120> half<00:05:17.390> hitches<00:05:17.630> again<00:05:18.280> with

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:19.280 
would do those half hitches again with

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:23.590 
would do those half hitches again with
your<00:05:19.430> long<00:05:19.669> piece<00:05:21.910> isn't<00:05:22.910> winging<00:05:23.270> it<00:05:23.389> through

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:23.600 
your long piece isn't winging it through

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:25.510 
your long piece isn't winging it through
the<00:05:23.720> end<00:05:23.870> yeah<00:05:24.350> bring<00:05:24.860> the<00:05:24.950> end<00:05:25.100> through<00:05:25.490> the

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:25.520 
the end yeah bring the end through the

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:30.370 
the end yeah bring the end through the
loop<00:05:26.090> that<00:05:26.630> you<00:05:26.720> made<00:05:28.510> okay<00:05:29.510> goes<00:05:29.810> behind<00:05:30.020> the

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:30.380 
loop that you made okay goes behind the

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:32.440 
loop that you made okay goes behind the
cord<00:05:31.010> goes<00:05:31.190> behind<00:05:31.370> the<00:05:31.760> ring

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:32.450 
cord goes behind the ring

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:34.990 
cord goes behind the ring
yup<00:05:33.110> through<00:05:33.440> the<00:05:33.590> ring<00:05:33.800> and<00:05:34.100> then<00:05:34.700> through

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:35.000 
yup through the ring and then through

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.550 
yup through the ring and then through
the<00:05:35.150> loop<00:05:35.180> that's<00:05:35.750> how<00:05:35.930> you<00:05:35.990> do<00:05:36.229> the<00:05:36.260> half

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:36.560 
the loop that's how you do the half

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:38.860 
the loop that's how you do the half
hitch<00:05:36.800> knot<00:05:37.060> if<00:05:38.060> you<00:05:38.150> wanted<00:05:38.390> to<00:05:38.479> cover<00:05:38.630> more

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:38.870 
hitch knot if you wanted to cover more

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:40.540 
hitch knot if you wanted to cover more
area<00:05:39.260> on<00:05:39.440> the<00:05:39.560> ring<00:05:39.740> you<00:05:39.770> could<00:05:40.010> just<00:05:40.190> add<00:05:40.370> more

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:40.550 
area on the ring you could just add more

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:42.490 
area on the ring you could just add more
half<00:05:40.760> hitches<00:05:40.970> right<00:05:41.300> that's<00:05:41.690> right<00:05:41.990> I<00:05:42.229> love

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:42.500 
half hitches right that's right I love

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:44.580 
half hitches right that's right I love
using<00:05:42.919> the<00:05:43.160> half<00:05:43.310> hitch<00:05:43.520> and<00:05:43.970> it's<00:05:44.180> a<00:05:44.300> great

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:44.590 
using the half hitch and it's a great

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:48.540 
using the half hitch and it's a great
it's<00:05:45.590> a<00:05:45.740> great<00:05:45.770> knotting<00:05:46.630> technique<00:05:47.630> to

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:48.550 
it's a great knotting technique to

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:52.840 
it's a great knotting technique to
embellish<00:05:49.870> embellish<00:05:50.870> anything<00:05:51.440> a<00:05:51.560> ring<00:05:51.850> yeah
