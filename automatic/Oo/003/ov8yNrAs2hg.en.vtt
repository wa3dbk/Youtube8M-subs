Hi everybody, my name’s Mike Merchent, I’m
the director of golf here at Purgatory Golf

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:10.380
Club, this is Clay Merchent, Clay is going
to assist me today, and today we’re going

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.730
to talk about posture and setup.

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:20.360
Now first, with posture, here’s what we
want to do: we want to make sure that we bend

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:24.980
from our hips, slightly bending our knees.

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.850
Or you could go with the opposite - you could
slightly bend your knees and then bend from

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:31.220
your hips, but we want to make sure we bend
from our hips.

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.140
We don’t want to bend our knees too much,
we don’t want to bend over too much.

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.929
So Clay’s going to show me here his posture.

00:00:37.929 --> 00:00:44.609
Okay, you can see Clay’s got a little bit
of knee flex, his back’s pretty flat, and

00:00:44.609 --> 00:00:46.389
he’s bending over from his hips.

00:00:46.389 --> 00:00:47.389
That’s perfect.

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:52.969
Now, he gets to that position, just stand
straight up, put your arms to your side.

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:58.570
Now, slightly bend your knees, and then bend
over from your hips, and then let your arms

00:00:58.570 --> 00:00:59.570
fall.

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:04.049
Now you can see, as Clay just relaxes and
his arms fall, that’s right where he’s

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.369
going to hold the club, because his hands
are directly below his shoulders, and that’s

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:09.420
what you want.

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.080
So that’s really good posture, a nice flat
back, slightly bending your knees.

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:19.310
Now, from a good posture position, we’re
going to add his sand wedge to this.

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:24.649
Now the sand wedge, that’s his shortest
club in the bag.

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:28.380
So the ball’s going to be a little closer
to him, more towards the center of his stance,

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.579
and you can see, as he sets up to it, go ahead
and stay set up there, hands right below his

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:37.090
shoulders, back’s nice and flat, slightly
bending his knees.

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.630
Now, keep a hold of your sand wedge there,
I’m just going to lay your five iron right

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.090
on top of you here.

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.619
That’s where he would hold is five iron.

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:50.490
And as you can see, his hand position doesn’t
change, still right below his shoulders, he

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.580
doesn’t reach for it, he doesn’t bend
over any additional from his hips, so he’s

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:00.659
in the same position with his five iron as
he is with his sand wedge, and then we can

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.119
add the driver, and you’ll find that the
same thing applies here.

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:12.870
The club’s going to be in the same position
as it was with his sand wedge and his five

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.730
iron, except the ball is a little bit further
away from him, is a little bit more towards

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.150
the instep of his left food.

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:26.110
So, hopefully the question that we answered
there is “How do you set up to the ball?”

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:31.159
“What’s your posture supposed to look
like?” and “Does my posture change with

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:32.159
the clubs?”

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:33.159
And the answer is no.

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:37.569
A sand wedge, a five iron, a driver, if you’re
making it a full swing, you’re going to

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:42.140
be set up the very same: bend from the hips,
slightly bended knees, arms directly below

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.840
your shoulders, and you just change whatever
club that you want, whether it’s a sand

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.530
wedge, five iron or driver, or anything in
between, and it’s the same position every

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:52.530
time.

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:57.140
So once you’ve established good posture,
and you’ve made a habit out of that, it

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:58.140
will never change.

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.980
You’ll maintain that posture through your
setup position for the rest of your golfing

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:02.980
career.

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.569
Well, we want to thank you all for joining
us today.

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:08.620
This is Clay, I’m Mike, we’re here at
Purgatory Gold Club.

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:09.680
We’ll see you next time.
