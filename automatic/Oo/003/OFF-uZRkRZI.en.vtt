00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
let's just have a look to see how we

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.340 
let's just have a look to see how we
make<00:01:43.500> this<00:01:43.770> and<00:01:44.810> this<00:01:45.810> table<00:01:46.170> on<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.290> left

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
make this and this table on the left

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.420 
make this and this table on the left
here<00:01:47.119> simple<00:01:48.119> 5<00:01:48.450> wood<00:01:48.750> planks<00:01:49.259> as<00:01:49.469> far<00:01:50.250> as<00:01:50.340> I'm

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
here simple 5 wood planks as far as I'm

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.880 
here simple 5 wood planks as far as I'm
aware<00:01:50.490> they<00:01:50.880> can<00:01:51.030> be<00:01:51.149> any<00:01:51.390> wood<00:01:51.630> planks<00:01:52.079> and

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
aware they can be any wood planks and

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.429 
aware they can be any wood planks and
ink<00:01:53.189> sack<00:01:53.460> and<00:01:53.909> a<00:01:54.180> feather<00:01:54.450> and<00:01:55.170> that's<00:01:55.320> going

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
ink sack and a feather and that's going

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.730 
ink sack and a feather and that's going
to<00:01:55.500> give<00:01:55.590> you<00:01:55.740> a<00:01:55.829> writing<00:01:56.250> desk<00:01:56.520> and<00:01:56.960> a<00:01:57.960> writing

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
to give you a writing desk and a writing

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.499 
to give you a writing desk and a writing
desk<00:01:58.979> when<00:01:59.280> you<00:01:59.399> place<00:01:59.610> it<00:01:59.820> down<00:02:00.000> I've<00:02:00.210> got<00:02:00.240> one

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
desk when you place it down I've got one

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.120 
desk when you place it down I've got one
here<00:02:01.100> you'll<00:02:02.100> see<00:02:02.159> is<00:02:02.549> a<00:02:02.579> double<00:02:02.969> block<00:02:03.180> and

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
here you'll see is a double block and

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.630 
here you'll see is a double block and
it's<00:02:05.539> the<00:02:06.539> first<00:02:06.570> block<00:02:07.200> it<00:02:08.039> will<00:02:08.190> always<00:02:08.399> face

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
it's the first block it will always face

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.340 
it's the first block it will always face
away<00:02:08.940> from<00:02:08.970> where<00:02:09.300> you<00:02:09.390> place<00:02:09.600> it<00:02:09.840> basically

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 
away from where you place it basically

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:13.850 
away from where you place it basically
so<00:02:10.740> the<00:02:11.490> first<00:02:11.960> block<00:02:12.960> you<00:02:13.200> click<00:02:13.470> on<00:02:13.620> will<00:02:13.830> be

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
so the first block you click on will be

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.080 
so the first block you click on will be
the<00:02:14.520> first<00:02:14.790> block<00:02:15.060> and<00:02:15.360> then

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
the first block and then

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.949 
the first block and then
it<00:02:16.930> will<00:02:17.879> expand<00:02:18.879> onto<00:02:19.120> the<00:02:19.330> block<00:02:19.510> directly

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 
it will expand onto the block directly

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:24.449 
it will expand onto the block directly
behind<00:02:20.080> that<00:02:20.500> block<00:02:20.769> now<00:02:22.950> in<00:02:23.950> actual

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459 
behind that block now in actual

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:27.750 
behind that block now in actual
operation<00:02:25.060> or<00:02:25.390> we've<00:02:25.569> got<00:02:26.550> we've<00:02:27.550> got<00:02:27.730> a

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:03.740 
up a notebook with all your symbols in

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:06.980 
up a notebook with all your symbols in
as<00:07:04.740> far<00:07:04.980> as<00:07:05.130> I'm<00:07:05.220> aware<00:07:05.250> these<00:07:05.820> notebooks<00:07:06.120> do

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:06.990 
as far as I'm aware these notebooks do

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:09.650 
as far as I'm aware these notebooks do
operate<00:07:07.470> independently<00:07:08.250> on<00:07:08.640> a<00:07:08.670> server<00:07:09.090> so<00:07:09.510> if

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:09.660 
operate independently on a server so if

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:11.780 
operate independently on a server so if
your<00:07:10.470> server<00:07:10.740> is<00:07:10.980> set<00:07:11.220> up<00:07:11.370> that<00:07:11.580> way<00:07:11.760> and

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:11.790 
your server is set up that way and

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:14.000 
your server is set up that way and
allows<00:07:12.240> you<00:07:12.420> to<00:07:12.600> spawn<00:07:12.990> in<00:07:13.170> misc<00:07:13.350> loved<00:07:13.620> worlds

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:14.010 
allows you to spawn in misc loved worlds

00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:19.010 
allows you to spawn in misc loved worlds
you<00:07:14.970> could<00:07:15.300> effectively<00:07:15.720> trade<00:07:17.840> symbols<00:07:18.840> that

00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:19.020 
you could effectively trade symbols that

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:22.220 
you could effectively trade symbols that
you<00:07:19.140> find<00:07:19.410> in<00:07:19.590> your<00:07:19.770> your<00:07:20.340> notebooks<00:07:21.230> also

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:22.230 
you find in your your notebooks also

00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:23.630 
you find in your your notebooks also
your<00:07:22.440> notebooks<00:07:22.890> are<00:07:23.040> going<00:07:23.160> to<00:07:23.220> be<00:07:23.340> quite

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:23.640 
your notebooks are going to be quite

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:26.750 
your notebooks are going to be quite
precious<00:07:24.450> to<00:07:24.630> you<00:07:24.750> I<00:07:24.780> expect<00:07:25.260> and<00:07:26.220> so<00:07:26.580> bear

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:32.070 
is a writing desk I did cover a lot of

00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:35.990 
is a writing desk I did cover a lot of
the<00:07:32.340> actual<00:07:34.070> beast<00:07:35.070> graph<00:07:35.310> functions<00:07:35.550> with

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:36.000 
the actual beast graph functions with

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.720 
the actual beast graph functions with
this<00:07:36.120> as<00:07:36.300> well<00:07:36.480> but<00:07:37.070> that's<00:07:38.070> really<00:07:38.280> because
