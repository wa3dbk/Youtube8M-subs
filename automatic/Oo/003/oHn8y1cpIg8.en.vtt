00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
games always sometimes to double its

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.570 
games always sometimes to double its
work<00:02:56.840> because<00:02:57.840> it<00:02:58.019> can<00:02:58.280> keep<00:02:59.280> you<00:02:59.340> in<00:02:59.489> the

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:48.860 
responsible for for that I think we all

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:50.680 
responsible for for that I think we all
have<00:03:49.040> to<00:03:49.130> be<00:03:49.160> aware<00:03:49.460> of<00:03:49.520> our<00:03:49.820> advantages<00:03:50.330> and

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:50.690 
have to be aware of our advantages and

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:53.760 
have to be aware of our advantages and
our<00:03:50.900> strengths<00:03:51.380> and<00:03:51.940> from<00:03:52.940> my<00:03:53.090> perspective

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:53.770 
our strengths and from my perspective

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:56.500 
our strengths and from my perspective
maybe<00:03:54.770> because<00:03:55.040> I'm<00:03:55.160> one<00:03:55.430> of<00:03:55.550> the<00:03:55.640> inside<00:03:56.270> guys

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510 
maybe because I'm one of the inside guys

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:59.470 
maybe because I'm one of the inside guys
we<00:03:57.200> should<00:03:57.440> be<00:03:57.590> pounding<00:03:58.400> guys<00:03:58.580> every<00:03:59.330> night
