that<00:00:47.550> we're<00:00:47.730> really<00:00:47.850> focused<00:00:48.329> on<00:00:48.480> just<00:00:48.809> trying

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
that we're really focused on just trying

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.290 
that we're really focused on just trying

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
to identify with it footprint is what

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.520 
to identify with it footprint is what
have<00:00:51.390> we<00:00:51.480> learned<00:00:51.719> about<00:00:51.870> dealing<00:00:52.230> with<00:00:52.440> the

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
have we learned about dealing with the

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.950 
have we learned about dealing with the
disease<00:00:52.829> through<00:00:53.160> it<00:00:53.219> like<00:00:53.430> PSA<00:00:53.960> we're

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
disease through it like PSA we're

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.869 
disease through it like PSA we're
learning<00:00:55.170> all<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.649> time<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:56.370> unfortunate

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
learning all the time the unfortunate

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.880 
learning all the time the unfortunate
thing<00:00:57.030> is<00:00:57.090> we<00:00:57.420> don't<00:00:58.350> have<00:00:58.590> a<00:00:58.620> lot<00:00:58.859> of

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
thing is we don't have a lot of

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.319 
thing is we don't have a lot of
knowledge<00:00:59.219> about<00:01:00.289> PSA<00:01:01.289> so<00:01:02.070> it's<00:01:02.520> like

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
knowledge about PSA so it's like

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:04.910 
knowledge about PSA so it's like

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.330 
organized and responding very very
quickly<00:01:51.780> so<00:01:52.079> from<00:01:52.590> that<00:01:52.619> perspective<00:01:52.860> I<00:01:53.310> think

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
quickly so from that perspective I think

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.249 
quickly so from that perspective I think
we've<00:01:53.670> possibly<00:01:54.329> enhanced<00:01:54.869> our<00:01:54.990> reputation

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
we've possibly enhanced our reputation

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.399 
we've possibly enhanced our reputation
and<00:01:55.740> I<00:01:56.430> also<00:01:56.640> think<00:01:57.090> that<00:01:57.420> our<00:01:57.659> new<00:01:58.229> zealand

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
and I also think that our new zealand

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.920 
and I also think that our new zealand
enters<00:01:59.280> espera<00:01:59.640> are<00:01:59.820> really<00:02:00.240> the<00:02:00.479> reference

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
enters espera are really the reference

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.050 
enters espera are really the reference
for<00:02:01.170> kiwi<00:02:01.439> fruit<00:02:01.649> worldwide<00:02:02.070> quality<00:02:02.909> key

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
for kiwi fruit worldwide quality key

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.760 
for kiwi fruit worldwide quality key
before<00:02:03.180> it<00:02:03.329> comes<00:02:03.509> out<00:02:03.630> of<00:02:03.750> New<00:02:03.869> Zealand<00:02:04.200> we

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
before it comes out of New Zealand we

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.770 
before it comes out of New Zealand we
know<00:02:04.920> that<00:02:04.950> PSA<00:02:05.640> is<00:02:05.880> only<00:02:06.210> affecting<00:02:06.689> the

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
vines it's not affecting the fruit so

figure out what the new normal will be

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:25.820 
figure out what the new normal will be
I'd<00:04:24.479> like<00:04:24.660> to<00:04:24.750> think<00:04:24.930> five<00:04:25.080> years<00:04:25.320> we<00:04:25.500> would<00:04:25.770> be

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
I'd like to think five years we would be

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:29.330 
I'd like to think five years we would be
