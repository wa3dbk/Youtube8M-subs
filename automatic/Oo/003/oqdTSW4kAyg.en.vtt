00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
millions of times before but it's worth

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.759

reason<00:00:45.450> to<00:00:45.480> make<00:00:45.660> excuses<00:00:46.230> to<00:00:46.440> not<00:00:46.469> work<00:00:46.829> hard

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
reason to make excuses to not work hard

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.250 
reason to make excuses to not work hard
you<00:00:47.430> either<00:00:47.610> do<00:00:47.940> work<00:00:48.120> hard<00:00:48.360> or<00:00:48.660> you<00:00:48.780> don't<00:00:49.050> or

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
you either do work hard or you don't or

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.290 
you either do work hard or you don't or
you<00:00:49.320> can<00:00:49.530> develop<00:00:49.800> habits<00:00:50.100> in<00:00:50.460> order<00:00:50.969> to<00:00:51.180> help

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
you can develop habits in order to help

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.930 
you can develop habits in order to help
yourself<00:00:51.750> work<00:00:51.989> hard<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:53.100> second<00:00:53.520> one<00:00:53.640> and

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
yourself work hard the second one and

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.819 
yourself work hard the second one and
one<00:00:54.149> that<00:00:54.329> will<00:00:54.690> actually<00:00:54.719> help<00:00:55.140> you<00:00:55.260> develop

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
one that will actually help you develop

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.130 
one that will actually help you develop
a<00:00:56.100> hard<00:00:56.309> working<00:00:56.699> mentality<00:00:57.149> and<00:00:57.360> probably

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
a hard working mentality and probably

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.160 
a hard working mentality and probably
the<00:00:58.260> most<00:00:58.410> important<00:00:58.829> one<00:00:58.859> on<00:00:59.070> this<00:00:59.190> list<00:00:59.250> is

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.170 
the most important one on this list is

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.500 
the most important one on this list is
practice<00:01:01.170> on<00:01:01.320> your<00:01:01.469> own<00:01:01.530> and<00:01:02.120> why<00:01:03.120> mention

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
practice on your own and why mention

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.630 
practice on your own and why mention
this<00:01:03.840> is<00:01:04.080> because<00:01:04.559> a<00:01:04.589> lot<00:01:04.890> of<00:01:04.920> players<00:01:05.280> won't

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
this is because a lot of players won't

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.960 
this is because a lot of players won't
practice<00:01:06.119> outside<00:01:06.630> of<00:01:07.140> team<00:01:07.470> practices<00:01:08.220> you

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
practice outside of team practices you

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.109 
practice outside of team practices you
need<00:01:09.360> to<00:01:09.600> be<00:01:09.720> practicing<00:01:10.380> outside<00:01:10.830> of<00:01:11.610> team

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
need to be practicing outside of team

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.000 
need to be practicing outside of team
practice<00:01:12.689> this<00:01:12.990> means<00:01:13.439> that<00:01:13.590> you<00:01:13.680> need<00:01:13.830> to<00:01:13.920> be

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
practice this means that you need to be

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.920 
practice this means that you need to be
practicing<00:01:14.580> every<00:01:14.939> single<00:01:15.270> day<00:01:15.450> individually

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930

on<00:01:16.409> your<00:01:16.590> own<00:01:16.770> skills<00:01:17.280> because<00:01:18.090> when<00:01:18.270> you're

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
on your own skills because when you're

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.899 
on your own skills because when you're
in<00:01:18.479> a<00:01:18.570> team<00:01:18.810> practice<00:01:19.380> you<00:01:20.220> do<00:01:20.400> more<00:01:20.610> team

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
in a team practice you do more team

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.370 
in a team practice you do more team
drills<00:01:21.210> and<00:01:21.420> you<00:01:21.479> don't<00:01:21.659> do<00:01:21.780> individual

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
drills and you don't do individual

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.480 
drills and you don't do individual
drills<00:01:22.650> that<00:01:22.799> will<00:01:22.890> help<00:01:23.100> you<00:01:23.340> improve

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
drills that will help you improve

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.300 
drills that will help you improve
certain<00:01:24.090> areas<00:01:24.479> like<00:01:24.509> dribbling<00:01:24.979> and<00:01:25.979> skill

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
certain areas like dribbling and skill

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.280 
certain areas like dribbling and skill
moves<00:01:26.610> and<00:01:27.000> ball<00:01:27.180> control<00:01:27.360> and<00:01:27.600> all<00:01:27.869> that<00:01:28.080> I

moves and ball control and all that I

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.020 
moves and ball control and all that I
know<00:01:28.799> it's<00:01:29.070> very<00:01:29.189> hard<00:01:29.520> to<00:01:29.670> get<00:01:29.759> into<00:01:29.939> the

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
know it's very hard to get into the

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.300 
know it's very hard to get into the
habit<00:01:30.240> of<00:01:30.540> practicing<00:01:30.900> every<00:01:31.409> day<00:01:31.439> I<00:01:31.770> made<00:01:32.280> a

habit of practicing every day I made a

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.190 
habit of practicing every day I made a
video<00:01:32.549> on<00:01:32.729> how<00:01:33.000> to<00:01:33.119> do<00:01:33.360> this<00:01:33.509> though<00:01:33.720> so<00:01:34.049> I'll

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200

video<00:01:39.360> and<00:01:39.630> it's<00:01:39.750> all<00:01:39.930> about<00:01:40.079> how<00:01:40.229> to<00:01:40.259> develop

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
video and it's all about how to develop

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.399 
video and it's all about how to develop
the<00:01:40.829> habit<00:01:41.009> of<00:01:41.630> practicing<00:01:42.630> every<00:01:42.930> single<00:01:43.290> day

the habit of practicing every single day

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.819 
the habit of practicing every single day
the<00:01:43.829> third<00:01:44.040> thing<00:01:44.280> is<00:01:44.340> take<00:01:45.090> chances<00:01:45.600> now<00:01:46.170> this

the third thing is take chances now this
might<00:01:47.189> sound<00:01:47.430> a<00:01:47.549> little<00:01:47.610> more<00:01:47.850> complicated

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
might sound a little more complicated

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.160 
might sound a little more complicated
then<00:01:49.040> than<00:01:50.040> it<00:01:50.189> is<00:01:50.369> but<00:01:51.149> it<00:01:51.270> really<00:01:51.509> isn't<00:01:51.810> a

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
then than it is but it really isn't a

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.870 
then than it is but it really isn't a
lot<00:01:52.380> of<00:01:52.590> players<00:01:52.920> in<00:01:53.159> games<00:01:53.340> won't<00:01:53.670> take

lot of players in games won't take
chances<00:01:54.119> and<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:55.200> reason<00:01:55.560> they<00:01:55.710> won't<00:01:55.890> take

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
chances and the reason they won't take

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.940 
chances and the reason they won't take
chances<00:01:56.430> is<00:01:56.880> they<00:01:57.210> don't<00:01:57.360> even<00:01:57.450> try<00:01:57.719> to

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
chances is they don't even try to

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.590 
chances is they don't even try to
they'll<00:01:58.950> pass<00:01:59.189> it<00:01:59.399> off<00:01:59.549> to<00:01:59.759> a<00:01:59.790> teammate<00:02:00.329> or<00:02:00.540> an

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
they'll pass it off to a teammate or an
