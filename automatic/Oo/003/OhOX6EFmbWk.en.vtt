00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:48.079 
you train in the middle of the day I

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:50.529 
you train in the middle of the day I
really<00:00:48.620> recommend<00:00:48.879> combining<00:00:49.879> proteins<00:00:50.359> and

00:00:50.529 --> 00:00:50.539 
really recommend combining proteins and

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:53.529 
really recommend combining proteins and
fats<00:00:50.809> and<00:00:51.229> you<00:00:51.679> try<00:00:51.979> and<00:00:52.280> do<00:00:52.879> your<00:00:53.030> best<00:00:53.089> never

00:00:53.529 --> 00:00:53.539 
fats and you try and do your best never

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:55.090 
fats and you try and do your best never
to<00:00:53.659> combine<00:00:54.109> fats<00:00:54.469> and<00:00:54.829> carbohydrates

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:55.100 
to combine fats and carbohydrates

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.369 
to combine fats and carbohydrates
carbohydrates<00:00:55.699> is<00:00:56.299> an<00:00:56.420> insulin<00:00:56.899> spiking

00:00:57.369 --> 00:00:57.379 
carbohydrates is an insulin spiking

00:00:57.379 --> 00:00:58.989 
carbohydrates is an insulin spiking
hormone<00:00:57.769> which<00:00:57.979> is<00:00:58.100> also<00:00:58.369> a<00:00:58.399> storage<00:00:58.789> hormone

00:00:58.989 --> 00:00:58.999 
hormone which is also a storage hormone

00:00:58.999 --> 00:01:01.359 
hormone which is also a storage hormone
so<00:00:59.299> one<00:00:59.420> of<00:00:59.449> it<00:00:59.629> the<00:01:00.170> downfalls<00:01:00.920> of<00:01:01.039> that<00:01:01.190> is

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:01.369 
so one of it the downfalls of that is

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:03.609 
so one of it the downfalls of that is
that<00:01:01.609> if<00:01:01.789> you<00:01:02.209> spike<00:01:02.539> your<00:01:02.749> insulin<00:01:02.779> and

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:03.619 
that if you spike your insulin and

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:05.469 
that if you spike your insulin and
there's<00:01:03.859> a<00:01:03.889> fat<00:01:04.369> in<00:01:04.549> your<00:01:04.579> bloodstream<00:01:04.879> it's

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:05.479 
there's a fat in your bloodstream it's

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:08.889 
there's a fat in your bloodstream it's
more<00:01:06.109> likely<00:01:06.350> to<00:01:06.619> get<00:01:06.770> store<00:01:07.670> to<00:01:07.820> spot<00:01:08.119> ah<00:01:08.359> but

00:01:08.889 --> 00:01:08.899 
more likely to get store to spot ah but

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:10.630
