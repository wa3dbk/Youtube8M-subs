00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
small spaces without having to do an

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.230 
small spaces without having to do an

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
do a small space sometimes because you

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.850 
do a small space sometimes because you
don't<00:02:24.930> have<00:02:25.110> to<00:02:25.230> come<00:02:25.410> up<00:02:25.440> with<00:02:25.590> so<00:02:25.890> many

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
don't have to come up with so many

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:32.510 
don't have to come up with so many
different<00:02:28.860> ideas<00:02:29.370> for<00:02:29.400> one<00:02:29.760> layout<00:02:31.430> and<00:02:32.430> you

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
different ideas for one layout and you

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:33.980 
different ideas for one layout and you
just<00:02:32.700> flip<00:02:32.880> it<00:02:32.940> around<00:02:33.060> like<00:02:33.360> that<00:02:33.540> these<00:02:33.870> are

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
just flip it around like that these are

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:37.670 
just flip it around like that these are
all<00:02:34.020> going<00:02:34.350> with<00:02:34.560> that<00:02:34.590> same<00:02:35.450> event<00:02:36.500> you<00:02:37.500> can

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
all going with that same event you can

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.220 
all going with that same event you can
tell<00:02:37.860> by<00:02:38.010> the<00:02:38.420> theme<00:02:39.420> of<00:02:39.450> the<00:02:39.660> pattern<00:02:40.020> or<00:02:40.200> a

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:13.360 
put their address on the back that'd be
really<00:04:11.359> fun<00:04:11.659> or<00:04:12.260> you<00:04:12.889> could<00:04:13.040> even<00:04:13.129> do<00:04:13.340> a

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.370 
really fun or you could even do a

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:14.680 
really fun or you could even do a
calendar<00:04:13.819> one<00:04:14.090> where<00:04:14.239> you<00:04:14.299> just<00:04:14.480> do<00:04:14.569> the

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:14.690 
calendar one where you just do the

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:16.840 
calendar one where you just do the
highlights<00:04:15.109> from<00:04:15.290> each<00:04:15.470> month<00:04:15.639> get<00:04:16.639> some

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:16.850 
highlights from each month get some

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:19.960 
highlights from each month get some
January<00:04:17.269> through<00:04:17.539> December<00:04:17.750> tabs<00:04:18.760> and<00:04:19.760> put

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:19.970 
January through December tabs and put

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:22.060 
January through December tabs and put
your<00:04:20.090> highlights<00:04:20.510> that'd<00:04:21.260> be<00:04:21.350> so<00:04:21.530> easy<00:04:21.769> to

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.070 
your highlights that'd be so easy to

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:26.710 
your highlights that'd be so easy to
because<00:04:22.370> you<00:04:22.460> wouldn't<00:04:22.729> have<00:04:22.850> to<00:04:25.330> do<00:04:26.330> quite<00:04:26.539> as

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:26.720 
because you wouldn't have to do quite as

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.120 
because you wouldn't have to do quite as
much<00:04:26.870> you<00:04:27.080> could<00:04:27.199> just<00:04:27.289> add<00:04:27.530> a<00:04:27.560> few<00:04:27.860> here<00:04:28.100> and

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.130 
much you could just add a few here and

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:29.560 
much you could just add a few here and
there<00:04:28.310> would<00:04:28.580> be<00:04:28.610> a<00:04:28.669> great<00:04:28.940> way<00:04:29.090> to<00:04:29.150> be<00:04:29.300> able<00:04:29.330> to

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:29.570 
there would be a great way to be able to

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:33.430 
there would be a great way to be able to
do<00:04:29.690> it<00:04:29.720> 15<00:04:30.110> minutes<00:04:30.380> at<00:04:30.500> a<00:04:30.530> time<00:04:30.740> and<00:04:32.169> these<00:04:33.169> are

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.440 
do it 15 minutes at a time and these are

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.620 
do it 15 minutes at a time and these are
a<00:04:33.470> little<00:04:33.889> actually<00:04:34.490> wallet<00:04:34.940> size<00:04:35.150> prints
