 good 

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:08.710
 debuting in a modest history of 11 

00:00:05.319 --> 00:00:11.080
 pages in August 1962 in the Amazon 

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:13.150

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:15.190
 became an immediate success and soon 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:17.170
 he earned his own title in a comic 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:19.840
 it is still published half a century later 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:22.120
 the spiderman without doubts is one of the 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:25.510
 biggest marvel stars that's not 

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:27.280
 it is debatable will it be for being so young by 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:29.440
 his sense of humor for being of the 

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:32.649
 first with film to match or by 

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:34.750

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.740
 continuation 

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:41.650
 Peter Parker was the second spider-man 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:44.350
 in debuting with marvel the first time 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:46.750
 it was with the strange title where you will be 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:49.150
 when the spiders attack in this 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:51.910
 cartoon a common spider was exposed 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:53.800
 to the radioactive rays then it started to 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:55.980
 develop the intelligence of a being 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:59.380
 human and grow to huge proportions 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.540
 able to talk and even shoot this 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:04.120
 species of spider man was exterminated 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:06.880
 at the end of the story 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:08.950
 Peter Parker is a fan of the Mets 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.650
 friendly weaver loves the mets for 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.630
 identify with them on their own 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:15.460
 words the mets are a handful of 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:18.490
 adorable losers who made a 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:20.950
 Casual home run by accident plus no 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.960
 just because of this is big fan peter loves 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.330
 to the mets because he was raised so go to 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.369
 Shea Stadium was an annual tradition with 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:29.800
 his beloved young uncle that Peter continues 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:32.860
 after the death of this one 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:34.540
 who is moral thousands at the beginning of 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.000
 millennium marvel created the editorial line 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.740
 ultimate where they counted the 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.610
 stories of his heroes with a focus 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.950
 more current 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.869
 among them ultimate spider-man 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.450
 from Peter Parker was transformed into the 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:50.299
 arachnid hero of that universe makes a 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.850
 couple of years the character died his death 

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:55.100
 was narrated in two mini series here is 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:57.320
 where it appears in one scene moral miles 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.049
 totally new character that is 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.700
 transformed into the new spider man 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:03.679
 morals is a young black man with origins 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.479
 Latinos who won their powers as 

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:08.119
 did parker through one of the 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:10.489
 same radioactive spiders from 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:12.379
 then this editorial is the only one 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:15.739
 has not been canceled from the ultimate line 

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:17.510
 just like him classic spider-man thousands 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:20.120
 Maintains humor and personality 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.390
 friendly also possesses some powers 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:25.370
 added to the peter parker classics 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:28.040
 at the moment this character is not 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:30.410
 close to being in the cinemas leaked 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:33.079
 some documents between mabel and zombie 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:35.209
 to maintain the race and preferences of 

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:37.010
 Peter Parker as a white person and 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:39.230
 Heterosexual 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.870
 the next day stanley offered his 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:44.180
 point of view I do not care if Peter 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:47.239
 parker would have been originally black 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:49.970
 Indian Latino or anything else that 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:52.690
 it stayed that way but we made it white 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:55.250
 I do not see any reason to change that 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:57.740
 I certainly believe that the world has 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.960
 place for gay superheroes but again 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:01.760
 I do not find any reason to change 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:03.200
 the sexual preferences of a 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.140
 character once already 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:08.900
 established I have no problem in creating 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:11.150
 new homosexual superheroes and 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:13.580
 really the guru of the cameos has 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:15.740
 The whole reason is because you support 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:19.460
 gays are not going to become one 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:21.320
 now let's continue if your parents were not 

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:23.930
 so common 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:25.910
 richard and mary parker had been spies 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:28.310
 for the government of the us 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:30.860
 years later in a story 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:32.870
 retrospective showed that parents of 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:35.330
 spider-man had saved his life 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:37.490
 an agent known as agent in time 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:40.340
 then it is revealed that agent is not another 

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:42.350
 that logan wolverine and more surprising 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.780
 Mary Parker saved the life of the mutant 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:48.110
 while he had just a few weeks of 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:49.970
 pregnancy of his future son Peter so without 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:52.500
 that none knew that was the 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:55.860
 first time they were close 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:57.750
 peter's middle name is ben peter 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:59.700
 parker is one of the few heroes who 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.650
 have a personal life well scrutinize 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:04.050
 gives an indication of this is to have a 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:06.450
 second name the second name of 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:09.150
 peter benjamin was conceived as a 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:10.860
 homage to his uncle ben parker a number 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:13.020
 which shows Peter presenting his 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:14.970
 birth certificate in the building 

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:17.579
 federal of manhattan in order to 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:19.500
 get a passport but this little one 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:21.720
 apparently it was just to leave 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:23.820
 of step since other writers and up 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:26.340
 the same stanley would seem to make 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:28.700
 mind that does not exist 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:31.560
 Peter is not as loser as you think 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:34.590
 when stan reads and steve ditko what 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:36.870
 presented to the world in 1962 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:38.940
 Peter was a complete loser then the 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:41.580
 teenager becoming a spider-man 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:44.430
 his confidence and his popularity gave a 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:46.470
 significant jump in the seventh 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:48.780
 edition of his own series the amazing 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:50.090
 spider-man piter had his first girlfriend 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:52.760
 that she was a young and charming 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:55.500
 Secretary of the Daily Bugle Betty Brant 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:57.120
 after eight years he put an end to 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:59.430
 bullying hitting the bastard flash 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:02.040
 in front of your entire class right there 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:04.200
 I stop using the lenses and when peter 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:06.690
 she graduated from high school the most girl 

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:09.150
 popular school reads salem confessed 

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:10.770
 have had a crush on him but there 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:13.080
 The conquests do not end 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:15.000
 Peter would spend most of his years 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:16.830
 in college having something 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.729
 complicated with the beautiful blonde gwen 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:23.249
 stacy and mary jane the fiery redhead 

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:25.979
 the web only takes about one 

00:05:23.249 --> 00:05:28.650
 time that web has nothing to do with 

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:30.749
 its arachnid powers instead 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:32.909
 Peter used his scientific knowledge 

00:05:30.749 --> 00:05:34.830
 to develop its own web and a 

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:37.199
 pitcher to achieve those enviable 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:40.229
 swing for new york and also 

00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:42.839
 kick butts but these are proambiente 

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:44.639
 Stanley explained to readers that the 

00:05:42.839 --> 00:05:47.039
 artificial cobweb only lasts around 

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:49.499
 one hour before it evaporates in 

00:05:47.039 --> 00:05:53.399
 the air this concept is explained in the 

00:05:49.499 --> 00:05:55.469
 first the amazing spider-man of 1964 and 

00:05:53.399 --> 00:05:56.670
 it expanded to many other stories more 

00:05:55.469 --> 00:05:59.040
 late 

00:05:56.670 --> 00:06:01.290
 Aunt May was like most of the 

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:03.920
 Cute girls who die for the kids 

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:06.420
 bad and was married to a mobster 

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:09.270
 Peter discovered that his beloved aunt may 

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:11.580
 he had his own mysterious past as 

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:14.070
 May young woman had an affair with a 

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:16.200
 gangster named johnny geromel in this 

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:18.270

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:21.360
 Johnny's dark secret leaves him for 

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:23.780
 ben parker yes I know this seems 

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:25.650
 too much for a spiderman comics 

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:27.870
 fortunately no writer has 

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:29.820
 deepened on this topic I do not want 

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:32.100
 know about the burning adventures of the 

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:34.710
 aunt may or yes 

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:35.310
 spider-man joined the saturday cast 

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:38.010
 night live 

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:40.110
 when spider-man needed your help 

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:42.530
 to stop the nefarious silver samurai 

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:45.570
 what a tumult to bbc studies 

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:47.520
 the writer chris claremont and the artist 

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:50.160
 boc hong launched the approved edition by 

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:52.770
 the mbc that had the cast of sn l 

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:54.720
 to help spider-man go so far 

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:57.750
 like to pass for avengers 

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:59.360
 to fool the enemy of spider this 

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:02.040
 no doubt it is very curious and even 

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:04.260
 puzzling for some as well as 

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:06.750
 for many a dream come true see 

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:08.550
 to stanley present that nl in the 

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:10.830
 marvel universe 

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:12.780
 on one occasion the wall climbing stopped 

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:14.730
 an extraterrestrial to deceive a whole 

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:17.700
 generation to have sex 

00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:20.160
 without protection titled the amazing 

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:22.680
 spider-man versus the prodigy is something of 

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:24.770
 the strangest thing in a science plot 

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:26.880
 fiction the story had an evil 

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:28.560
 extraterrestrial called prodigy that 

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:30.660
 deliberately misinformed the 

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:33.420
 repercussions of the sexual activity of 

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:35.490
 the young the extraterrestrial filled with 

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:37.560
 information to unsuspecting young people by 

00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:38.529
 example telling them they could not stay 

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:40.239
 pregnant 

00:07:38.529 --> 00:07:42.609
 of 15 years old or in his first 

00:07:40.239 --> 00:07:44.949
 sexual experience the goal of the evil 

00:07:42.609 --> 00:07:46.929
 prodigal inspire young people to have 

00:07:44.949 --> 00:07:49.329
 children so he could put the children 

00:07:46.929 --> 00:07:51.549
 to work for him being extraterrestrial 

00:07:49.329 --> 00:07:53.799
 he came up with a complicated plan would be 

00:07:51.549 --> 00:07:56.379
 easier to just kidnap them for that 

00:07:53.799 --> 00:07:58.859
 spider-man approached and explained that the 

00:07:56.379 --> 00:08:03.329
 evil extraterrestrial was a pervert 

00:07:58.859 --> 00:08:03.329
 I'm hackers and until next time 

00:08:07.210 --> 00:08:10.210
 ah
