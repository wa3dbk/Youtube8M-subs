then<00:01:54.119> to<00:01:54.270> secure<00:01:54.659> it<00:01:54.780> we're<00:01:54.960> gonna

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
then to secure it we're gonna

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.649 
then to secure it we're gonna
around<00:01:56.090> the<00:01:56.330> outside<00:01:57.049> of<00:01:57.850> envelope<00:01:58.850> folding

00:01:59.649 --> 00:01:59.659 
around the outside of envelope folding

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:02.170 
around the outside of envelope folding
over<00:01:59.810> the<00:02:00.140> tab<00:02:00.560> and<00:02:00.950> then<00:02:01.310> once<00:02:01.520> it's<00:02:01.700> totally

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
over the tab and then once it's totally

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.530 
over the tab and then once it's totally
secure<00:02:02.659> we'll<00:02:03.229> just<00:02:03.530> trim<00:02:04.009> the<00:02:04.280> excess<00:02:04.729> we

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:05.540 
secure we'll just trim the excess we

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:06.820 
secure we'll just trim the excess we
need<00:02:05.689> to<00:02:05.780> do<00:02:05.990> the<00:02:06.170> outside<00:02:06.350> of<00:02:06.680> the<00:02:06.740> envelope

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:06.830 
need to do the outside of the envelope

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.540 
need to do the outside of the envelope
so<00:02:07.759> I<00:02:08.119> will<00:02:08.630> take<00:02:08.869> a<00:02:09.140> section<00:02:09.739> of<00:02:10.009> the<00:02:10.190> sleeve

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
so I will take a section of the sleeve

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.670 
so I will take a section of the sleeve
because<00:02:10.880> my<00:02:11.270> front<00:02:11.569> panel<00:02:11.870> isn't<00:02:12.440> going<00:02:12.590> to

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
because my front panel isn't going to

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.010 
because my front panel isn't going to
cover<00:02:12.890> the<00:02:13.190> entire<00:02:13.550> thing<00:02:13.910> if<00:02:14.330> you're<00:02:14.480> using<00:02:14.720> a

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
cover the entire thing if you're using a

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.320 
cover the entire thing if you're using a
large<00:02:15.290> shirt<00:02:15.680> or<00:02:15.860> an<00:02:15.950> extra<00:02:16.340> large<00:02:16.520> shirt<00:02:16.610> the

large shirt or an extra large shirt the

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.059 
large shirt or an extra large shirt the
front<00:02:17.569> panel<00:02:17.989> might<00:02:18.170> be<00:02:18.319> enough<00:02:18.590> to<00:02:18.620> cover<00:02:18.890> the

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:19.069 
front panel might be enough to cover the

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:20.680 
front panel might be enough to cover the
whole<00:02:19.130> thing<00:02:19.459> but<00:02:19.880> I'm<00:02:20.030> gonna<00:02:20.180> need<00:02:20.270> a<00:02:20.480> little

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
extra from the sleeve I'm gonna cover

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.280 
extra from the sleeve I'm gonna cover
the<00:02:23.000> side<00:02:23.239> that's<00:02:23.510> not<00:02:23.660> gonna<00:02:23.840> be<00:02:23.959> covered

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
the side that's not gonna be covered

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:25.780 
the side that's not gonna be covered
with<00:02:24.410> the<00:02:24.500> front<00:02:24.709> panel<00:02:25.040> at<00:02:25.130> the<00:02:25.160> pocket<00:02:25.640> with

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
with the front panel at the pocket with

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.900 
with the front panel at the pocket with
a<00:02:25.819> piece<00:02:26.360> of<00:02:26.510> the<00:02:26.599> sleeve<00:02:26.870> and<00:02:27.260> then<00:02:27.830> to<00:02:28.730> get

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
a piece of the sleeve and then to get

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:30.640 
a piece of the sleeve and then to get
the<00:02:29.060> corners<00:02:29.510> really<00:02:29.810> nice<00:02:29.989> you<00:02:30.230> basically

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
the corners really nice you basically

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.250 
the corners really nice you basically
just<00:02:31.130> fold<00:02:31.459> down<00:02:31.760> one<00:02:32.060> side<00:02:32.330> with<00:02:32.720> glue<00:02:32.989> and

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
just fold down one side with glue and

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.890 
just fold down one side with glue and
then<00:02:34.130> you'll<00:02:34.340> tuck<00:02:34.640> over<00:02:35.060> the<00:02:35.209> other<00:02:35.390> corner

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
then you'll tuck over the other corner

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.930 
then you'll tuck over the other corner
so<00:02:36.049> it's<00:02:36.200> a<00:02:36.260> nice<00:02:36.500> even<00:02:36.860> little<00:02:37.310> fold<00:02:37.640> and
