be interesting to see exactly how this

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.999 
be interesting to see exactly how this
pans<00:01:33.180> out<00:01:33.450> and<00:01:33.689> where<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:34.020> divide<00:01:34.290> my<00:01:34.530> lie<00:01:34.799> in

him again today a few issues with the
Vikings<00:01:59.340> I<00:01:59.430> think<00:01:59.670> are<00:01:59.790> worth<00:01:59.909> noting<00:02:00.329> number

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
Vikings I think are worth noting number

this football team now to what extent do
I<00:02:11.970> actually<00:02:12.090> believe<00:02:12.510> that

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
I actually believe that

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.030 
I actually believe that
I think<00:02:13.140> that<00:02:13.260> they<00:02:13.349> look<00:02:13.500> at<00:02:13.620> Simpsons<00:02:13.980> a

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
I think that they look at Simpsons a

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.650 
I think that they look at Simpsons a
fallback<00:02:14.250> option<00:02:14.790> because<00:02:14.940> at<00:02:15.060> least<00:02:15.180> he

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
fallback option because at least he

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.330 
fallback option because at least he
knows<00:02:15.810> the<00:02:16.050> system<00:02:16.230> because<00:02:17.010> they've<00:02:17.129> seen

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
knows the system because they've seen

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:18.589 
knows the system because they've seen
when<00:02:17.489> he's<00:02:17.610> been<00:02:17.819> healthy<00:02:17.849> which<00:02:18.269> he<00:02:18.360> was<00:02:18.450> not

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:18.599 
when he's been healthy which he was not

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:20.330 
when he's been healthy which he was not
for<00:02:18.780> most<00:02:18.930> of<00:02:19.050> last<00:02:19.230> season<00:02:19.379> that<00:02:19.980> there<00:02:20.190> is

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
for most of last season that there is

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.070 
for most of last season that there is
some<00:02:20.700> sort<00:02:21.239> of<00:02:21.300> juice<00:02:21.510> there<00:02:21.750> and<00:02:21.900> I<00:02:21.930> don't

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
some sort of juice there and I don't

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.390 
some sort of juice there and I don't
think<00:02:22.200> that<00:02:22.290> anybody<00:02:22.590> would<00:02:22.739> deny<00:02:23.010> that<00:02:23.220> the

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
think that anybody would deny that the

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.580 
think that anybody would deny that the
issue<00:02:23.700> with<00:02:23.910> Jerome<00:02:24.150> is<00:02:24.300> always<00:02:24.590> consistency

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
issue with Jerome is always consistency

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:26.720 
issue with Jerome is always consistency
and<00:02:25.800> I<00:02:26.040> think<00:02:26.190> the<00:02:26.250> way<00:02:26.340> you're<00:02:26.430> going<00:02:26.550> to<00:02:26.610> see

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
and I think the way you're going to see

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.280 
and I think the way you're going to see
the<00:02:26.819> Vikings<00:02:27.180> doing<00:02:27.510> looks<00:02:27.930> like<00:02:28.080> they<00:02:28.170> did

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
the Vikings doing looks like they did

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:29.570 
the Vikings doing looks like they did
last<00:02:28.319> year<00:02:28.590> when<00:02:28.769> Rick<00:02:28.890> Spielman<00:02:29.190> spent<00:02:29.400> a<00:02:29.430> lot

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
last year when Rick Spielman spent a lot

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:30.860 
last year when Rick Spielman spent a lot
of<00:02:29.610> time<00:02:29.730> at<00:02:29.940> the<00:02:30.000> podium<00:02:30.150> talking<00:02:30.599> about<00:02:30.750> how

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
of time at the podium talking about how

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.330 
of time at the podium talking about how
left<00:02:31.080> tackles<00:02:31.440> may<00:02:31.560> not<00:02:31.709> be<00:02:31.830> that<00:02:31.950> important

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
left tackles may not be that important

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:33.949 
left tackles may not be that important
in<00:02:32.400> the<00:02:32.489> modern<00:02:32.760> NFL<00:02:32.849> and<00:02:33.299> then<00:02:33.629> they<00:02:33.750> drive<00:02:33.930> to

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
in the modern NFL and then they drive to

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:36.229 
in the modern NFL and then they drive to
Matt<00:02:34.230> Kalil<00:02:34.410> I<00:02:34.709> think<00:02:35.129> one<00:02:35.250> of<00:02:35.280> film<00:02:35.910> and<00:02:36.030> stock

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
Matt Kalil I think one of film and stock

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:37.309 
Matt Kalil I think one of film and stock

and Jeff Schwartz was pushed out of the
rotation<00:04:08.910> i<00:04:09.419> think<00:04:09.750> that<00:04:09.840> they<00:04:09.930> may<00:04:10.109> end<00:04:10.139> up

line<00:06:09.330> but<00:06:09.660> I<00:06:09.720> think<00:06:09.900> somewhere<00:06:10.170> along<00:06:10.290> the

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:10.530 
line but I think somewhere along the

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:12.110 
line but I think somewhere along the
line<00:06:10.650> they<00:06:10.830> are<00:06:10.920> going<00:06:11.130> to<00:06:11.250> come<00:06:11.400> to<00:06:11.550> him<00:06:11.700> with

line they are going to come to him with

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:14.840 
line they are going to come to him with
a<00:06:12.180> pay<00:06:12.450> cut<00:06:12.500> simply<00:06:13.500> because<00:06:13.620> it's<00:06:14.250> just<00:06:14.370> tough

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:14.850 
a pay cut simply because it's just tough

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:16.760 
a pay cut simply because it's just tough
to<00:06:14.880> justify<00:06:15.480> that<00:06:15.840> and<00:06:16.080> I<00:06:16.380> don't<00:06:16.440> think<00:06:16.650> the

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:16.770 
to justify that and I don't think the

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:18.050 
to justify that and I don't think the
