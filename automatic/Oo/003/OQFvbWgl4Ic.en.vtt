00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:12.300
 Good day to all pilots with you again gif 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:15.450
 and today we will talk about merchants 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.310
 the luxury of this video appeared after 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.070
 request of one of the pilots to tell about 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.789
 this topic, he is extremely concerned that 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.619
 caravans you 9 take out hundreds of thousands of tons 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:29.099
 performances in hands out not at all 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:31.949
 sees native faces in these caravans so 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.960
 let's start in order luxury traders 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.510
 appears in the systems of experiencing 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.340
 economic boom and nairit wiki 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.500
 it is written that it is necessary that 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:44.040
 economic boom experienced not main 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:47.489
 fraction in the minor system but i'm really 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.050
 I am not sure about it now 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.000
 Is the system in this state possible 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.079
 look at the galactic map in 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.260
 system description 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.850
 if you have system data on 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.920
 currently luxury merchants and 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.750
 only buy performance xing chan tires 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.460
 and in order not to scare you further 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.949
 pronunciation I will call the translation 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.100
 This product namely amplifiers 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.570
 performance 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.159
 there is an opinion that they do not buy the most 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.939
 sold goods of the month 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:17.400
 but January ended this product is not 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.500
 changed so I think that this 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.060
 moment this system is running in 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.490
 and they just buy only these 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:27.140
 amplifiers are nothing else but in the following 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:29.520
 variations will add a variety of goods 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:32.579
 performance amplifiers produced 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:35.040
 only in hightech systems so far 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:39.150
 we only look for such systems with 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:41.280
 economic boom system itself 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.229
 is located signal is sitting lokshin 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.630
 they are not visible all at once is necessary 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:48.630
 fly closer to the station or in the planet 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:52.140
 and there you will see them in them and wait 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:54.030
 you merchants luxury if the station 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.159
 produces performance enhancers 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.290
 then buy them full hold and at all 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:01.710
 sails rush to this point of the blue club 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:03.930
 through there you meet several you 9 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.360
 enough to fly about one of them 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.509
 and then your three magically 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.979
 will become empty 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:12.890
 and your account will be credited for a round sum 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:15.110
 buys at the moment they are these very 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:19.849
 performance enhancers for the price of 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:21.769
 7450 credits per ton in general so that 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:23.420
 find out what merchants buy 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:25.700
 for the future or for example if you 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.680
 meet just a merchant you are not identified 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.739
 in the signal you can scan it 3 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.360
 dial-up scanner and the goods that you 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:36.110
 you will see him in the hold 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:38.900
 buys and now it's time to talk about 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.970
 profitability this business becomes 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.280
 profitable only if they match 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.489
 several factors so how back 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.019
 merchants to the station you fly empty 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:50.090
 firstly it is necessary that the station 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:53.390
 produced these same amplifiers 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:55.879
 performance is far from 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:58.220
 on all hightech stations and their price 

00:02:55.879 --> 00:03:00.260
 it would be at least around six 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:04.129
 half thousand loans and even better in 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:07.579
 around 6206 thousand 100 credits this 

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:09.530
 close to the ideal in the second point with 

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:11.750
 merchants must be in several 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.519
 millions of meters from the station well or 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:16.730
 pinch multiple light 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:18.380
 seconds then he saw what you see i 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.690
 flying at a distance of six thousand 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:21.319
 kilometers from the station and full circle on 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:23.660
 perry clip 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:26.329
 from loading a product to loading a new one 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:29.799
 it takes me about 4 minutes 

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:33.139
 maybe four and a half profit per 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:35.750
 profit from 240 tons of cargo 330 thousand 

00:03:33.139 --> 00:03:38.720
 loans if these conditions are not met 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:42.109
 then profitability goes down sharply i 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:45.019
 tried to fly in another system 

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:46.880
 at a distance of 200 light seconds so 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:50.180
 case the circle becomes about ten 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:52.690
 minutes if you buy again for more 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.690
 high prices 

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:59.569
 well I don't know there are six 606 700 

00:03:56.419 --> 00:04:02.569
 it also loses its meaning on its 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:06.290
 trade route and i have this money i have 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:12.379
 in view of 330000, even 350, I get about 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:14.419
 5 minutes flight economic boom in 

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:15.709
 the system last up to several days after 

00:04:14.419 --> 00:04:17.750
 this usually happens there 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:20.000
 escalation of conflicts and threats 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:23.340
 civil war which by the way usually 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.440
 then there is in addition a profit 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:27.210
 or luxury does not go to the trade rating 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:30.480
 will go node individual will come from 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:32.550
 smuggling soon brooks 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:34.500
 promised that this system will undergo 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:36.720
 changes at least shrink 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:39.449
 luxury merchant appearance number 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:41.760
 let's summarize can not say 

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:43.710
 what is it terribly fascinating 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:46.620
 rather, it looks like running very 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:48.150
 small circle yes and profitability like me 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.740
 told above it is comparable to 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:52.800
 profitability from a good trading 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:54.660
 the route to earn is necessary to 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.610
 Coincidentally a few small conditions 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:58.169
 distance from the station required product 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:00.810
 at the station at a low price 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:02.600
 now still a type of system of receipts of combat 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:05.150
 product is still extremely small 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:09.660
 produced only on hightech systems 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:12.389
 actually have either i changed all this 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:14.940
 a thing with luxury merchants I would raise 

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:16.889
 profits are higher but added risk 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:18.960
 police raids with any uber 

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:22.080
 a thing that stuns everything in psd in 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:25.680
 radius of five minutes from such a bloody 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:28.590
 bani rashida smuggling there with a finger and 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:30.330
 can not do or would load a brother 

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:32.850
 crammed full contraband hold 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:34.979
 the goods that you must bring 

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:37.680
 to the station and only there would you give 

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:38.280
 profit for the kill transaction then such 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:41.130
 trade 

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:42.240
 these same luxuries would be 

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:44.910
 incomparably more fun 

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:48.210
 well enough to dream see how she 

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:52.400
 It will be in the future and on this until all with 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:52.400
 you were a pilot gif and you successful flight
