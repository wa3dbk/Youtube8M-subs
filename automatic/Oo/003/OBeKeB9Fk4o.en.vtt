00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:17.949 
integrated in the whole main story of
this<00:03:16.340> girl<00:03:16.670> she's<00:03:17.000> a<00:03:17.030> drug<00:03:17.329> addict<00:03:17.720> and<00:03:17.930> she

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 
this girl she's a drug addict and she

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:20.140 
this girl she's a drug addict and she
runs<00:03:18.590> into<00:03:18.739> Denzel<00:03:19.130> Washington<00:03:19.670> and<00:03:19.910> they

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
runs into Denzel Washington and they

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:21.910 
runs into Denzel Washington and they
sort<00:03:20.359> of<00:03:20.420> help<00:03:20.660> each<00:03:20.750> other<00:03:20.989> in<00:03:21.200> ways<00:03:21.440> I<00:03:21.500> guess

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
sort of help each other in ways I guess

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.009 
sort of help each other in ways I guess
but<00:03:22.519> there<00:03:22.670> was<00:03:22.760> an<00:03:22.910> aspect<00:03:23.180> of<00:03:23.359> the<00:03:23.450> film<00:03:23.720> that

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:24.019 
but there was an aspect of the film that

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:26.050 
but there was an aspect of the film that
was<00:03:24.139> kind<00:03:24.440> of<00:03:24.530> boring<00:03:24.799> me<00:03:25.130> that<00:03:25.400> I<00:03:25.430> felt<00:03:25.730> kept

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060 
was kind of boring me that I felt kept

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:27.849 
was kind of boring me that I felt kept
deviating<00:03:26.870> and<00:03:27.049> I<00:03:27.109> was<00:03:27.290> trying<00:03:27.590> to<00:03:27.650> identify

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:27.859 
deviating and I was trying to identify

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:29.830 
deviating and I was trying to identify
what<00:03:28.340> it<00:03:28.430> was<00:03:28.579> and<00:03:28.790> I<00:03:28.819> didn't<00:03:29.180> really<00:03:29.480> catch<00:03:29.660> on

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
what it was and I didn't really catch on

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.690 
what it was and I didn't really catch on
to<00:03:30.019> it<00:03:30.139> until<00:03:30.170> the<00:03:30.410> end<00:03:30.590> of<00:03:30.769> the<00:03:30.859> film<00:03:31.130> I<00:03:31.340> didn't

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
to it until the end of the film I didn't

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.069 
to it until the end of the film I didn't
think<00:03:31.849> that<00:03:32.060> character<00:03:32.480> needed<00:03:32.720> to<00:03:32.810> be<00:03:32.959> in

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:33.079 
think that character needed to be in

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:34.569 
think that character needed to be in
this<00:03:33.170> movie<00:03:33.530> I<00:03:33.650> felt<00:03:34.069> that<00:03:34.190> she<00:03:34.340> could<00:03:34.519> have

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:34.579 
this movie I felt that she could have

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:36.069 
this movie I felt that she could have
just<00:03:34.639> been<00:03:34.880> removed<00:03:35.180> from<00:03:35.329> the<00:03:35.480> entire<00:03:35.750> movie

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:36.079 
just been removed from the entire movie

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:38.140 
just been removed from the entire movie
actually<00:03:36.530> I<00:03:36.650> understand<00:03:37.280> you<00:03:37.459> need<00:03:37.609> Denzel<00:03:38.060> to

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
actually I understand you need Denzel to

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.300 
actually I understand you need Denzel to
talk<00:03:38.389> to<00:03:38.599> somebody<00:03:38.810> and<00:03:39.170> there<00:03:39.829> were<00:03:39.950> certain

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
talk to somebody and there were certain

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:41.830 
talk to somebody and there were certain
aspects<00:03:40.730> of<00:03:40.819> what<00:03:41.209> was<00:03:41.329> going<00:03:41.599> on<00:03:41.660> between

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
aspects of what was going on between

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.449 
aspects of what was going on between
those<00:03:42.049> characters<00:03:42.290> that<00:03:42.530> was<00:03:42.919> definitely

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:43.459 
those characters that was definitely

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:44.860 
those characters that was definitely
there<00:03:43.549> was<00:03:43.639> some<00:03:43.790> meat<00:03:44.000> there<00:03:44.269> for<00:03:44.480> sure<00:03:44.660> I

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
there was some meat there for sure I

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:46.509 
there was some meat there for sure I
just<00:03:45.049> felt<00:03:45.260> like<00:03:45.290> it<00:03:45.500> didn't<00:03:45.769> really<00:03:45.919> need<00:03:46.459> to

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:46.519 
just felt like it didn't really need to

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:48.159 
just felt like it didn't really need to
be<00:03:46.819> in<00:03:46.910> the<00:03:47.030> movie<00:03:47.359> in<00:03:47.450> the<00:03:47.540> long<00:03:47.720> run<00:03:47.989> and<00:03:48.109> I

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:48.169 
be in the movie in the long run and I

00:03:48.169 --> 00:03:51.129 
be in the movie in the long run and I
feel<00:03:48.349> like<00:03:48.440> maybe<00:03:48.680> if<00:03:49.069> they<00:03:49.669> remove<00:03:50.000> that<00:03:50.329> the

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:51.139 
feel like maybe if they remove that the

00:03:51.139 --> 00:03:51.909 
feel like maybe if they remove that the
movie<00:03:51.319> would<00:03:51.440> have<00:03:51.470> been<00:03:51.560> a<00:03:51.680> little<00:03:51.829> more

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:51.919 
movie would have been a little more

00:03:51.919 --> 00:03:53.770 
movie would have been a little more
