00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:13.540 
was definitely laughing and we had a

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:15.960 
was definitely laughing and we had a
section<00:05:13.960> of<00:05:14.050> trail<00:05:14.260> we<00:05:14.440> put<00:05:14.650> in<00:05:14.800> just<00:05:15.100> for<00:05:15.760> him

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:15.970

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:19.680 
section of trail we put in just for him
it<00:05:16.900> was<00:05:17.110> really<00:05:17.440> tight<00:05:18.030> technical<00:05:19.030> but<00:05:19.510> that

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:19.690 
it was really tight technical but that

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:21.360 
it was really tight technical but that
was<00:05:19.870> it<00:05:20.440> was<00:05:20.620> something<00:05:20.830> he<00:05:20.860> would<00:05:21.070> have<00:05:21.190> done

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:21.370 
was it was something he would have done

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:24.150 
was it was something he would have done
at<00:05:22.360> 67<00:05:23.350> he<00:05:23.500> would<00:05:23.650> have<00:05:23.740> been<00:05:23.860> right<00:05:24.040> there

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:24.160 
at 67 he would have been right there

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:26.820 
at 67 he would have been right there
with<00:05:24.220> us<00:05:24.430> cutting<00:05:24.850> the<00:05:24.910> trail<00:05:25.150> so<00:05:25.510> I<00:05:25.750> think<00:05:26.200> I

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:26.830 
with us cutting the trail so I think I

00:05:26.830 --> 00:06:54.300 
with us cutting the trail so I think I
think<00:05:27.130> he<00:05:27.340> had<00:05:27.520> I<00:05:27.850> get<00:05:28.570> a<00:05:28.630> good<00:05:28.840> day<00:05:28.990> up<00:05:29.170> there

00:06:57.420 --> 00:06:57.430 
I think all the four city riders had a

00:06:57.430 --> 00:06:59.850 
I think all the four city riders had a
great<00:06:57.699> crew<00:06:57.970> it<00:06:58.180> helped<00:06:58.479> do<00:06:59.020> a<00:06:59.050> ton<00:06:59.440> of<00:06:59.470> trail
