00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:10.040 
taking a look at Grand Theft Auto 5

running on Intel HD 4600 graphics so

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.749 
running on Intel HD 4600 graphics so
this<00:00:10.290> is<00:00:10.650> has<00:00:11.070> world<00:00:11.340> GT<00:00:11.790> 2<00:00:12.059> graphics<00:00:12.950> on<00:00:13.950> a

this is has world GT 2 graphics on a

this is has world GT 2 graphics on a

quad core 45 watt part in a larger

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.269 
quad core 45 watt part in a larger
laptop<00:00:18.150> I<00:00:18.300> have<00:00:18.480> here<00:00:18.720> and<00:00:18.960> this<00:00:19.830> is<00:00:19.949> running

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
laptop I have here and this is running

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.800 
laptop I have here and this is running
at<00:00:20.600> 1366<00:00:21.600> by<00:00:21.689> 768<00:00:22.640> so<00:00:23.640> the<00:00:23.760> same<00:00:24.029> resolution

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
at 1366 by 768 so the same resolution

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.470 
at 1366 by 768 so the same resolution
that<00:00:25.289> I<00:00:25.410> ran<00:00:25.650> for<00:00:25.890> my<00:00:26.039> iris<00:00:26.460> pro<00:00:26.900> 5200<00:00:27.920> video

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:29.480 
that I ran for my iris pro 5200 video

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.720 
that I ran for my iris pro 5200 video
and<00:00:30.480> as<00:00:31.380> we're<00:00:31.560> allowing<00:00:31.740> this<00:00:31.949> load<00:00:32.279> again

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
and as we're allowing this load again

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.660 
and as we're allowing this load again
we're<00:00:32.940> on<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.180> same<00:00:33.360> drivers<00:00:34.219> very<00:00:35.219> similar

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
we're on the same drivers very similar

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:43.010 
we're on the same drivers very similar
setups<00:00:37.700> and<00:00:39.739> detail<00:00:40.739> is<00:00:41.040> at<00:00:41.399> sort<00:00:42.210> of<00:00:42.239> low

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
setups and detail is at sort of low

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.590 
setups and detail is at sort of low
detail<00:00:43.469> settings<00:00:44.010> so<00:00:44.370> really<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:45.180> only<00:00:45.329> thing

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
detail settings so really the only thing

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.600 
detail settings so really the only thing
we<00:00:45.629> can<00:00:45.840> drop<00:00:46.050> further<00:00:46.379> from<00:00:46.710> this<00:00:46.860> point<00:00:47.190> is

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
we can drop further from this point is

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.350 
we can drop further from this point is
the<00:00:48.090> resolution<00:00:49.610> everything<00:00:50.610> else<00:00:50.760> is<00:00:51.030> turned

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
the resolution everything else is turned

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.290 
the resolution everything else is turned
down<00:00:51.629> to<00:00:52.199> try<00:00:52.440> and<00:00:52.590> get<00:00:52.770> a<00:00:52.850> playable<00:00:53.850> level<00:00:54.210> of

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
down to try and get a playable level of

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.959 
down to try and get a playable level of
performance<00:00:54.899> from<00:00:55.170> this<00:00:55.640> system<00:00:56.640> with<00:00:56.820> the

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
performance from this system with the

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.830 
performance from this system with the
game<00:00:57.800> so<00:00:58.800> now<00:00:59.010> in<00:00:59.460> a<00:00:59.579> moment<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.120> test<00:01:00.570> will

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
game so now in a moment the test will

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:06.679 
game so now in a moment the test will
start<00:01:00.870> slowed<00:01:02.059> and<00:01:03.290> here<00:01:04.290> we<00:01:04.439> can<00:01:04.619> see<00:01:05.689> early

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
start slowed and here we can see early

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.660 
start slowed and here we can see early
on<00:01:06.810> in<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.080> test<00:01:07.290> we're<00:01:07.590> over<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.100> 30<00:01:08.340> frames

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
on in the test we're over the 30 frames

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.760 
on in the test we're over the 30 frames
per<00:01:08.760> second<00:01:09.180> mark<00:01:09.390> but<00:01:09.659> as<00:01:09.810> we<00:01:10.020> go<00:01:10.170> to<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.560> sort

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
per second mark but as we go to the sort

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.170 
per second mark but as we go to the sort
of<00:01:10.860> nighttime<00:01:11.130> settings<00:01:11.850> and<00:01:12.119> the

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
of nighttime settings and the

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.359 
of nighttime settings and the
transitions<00:01:12.810> through<00:01:13.080> there<00:01:13.320> we<00:01:13.560> do<00:01:13.799> get<00:01:14.100> some

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
transitions through there we do get some

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.460 
transitions through there we do get some
dips<00:01:14.640> below<00:01:14.909> 30<00:01:15.450> frames<00:01:15.840> per<00:01:15.960> second<00:01:18.470> moving

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
dips below 30 frames per second moving

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.219 
dips below 30 frames per second moving
on<00:01:19.710> to<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:19.950> next<00:01:20.040> stage<00:01:20.430> here<00:01:21.360> with<00:01:21.600> larger

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
on to the next stage here with larger

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.350 
on to the next stage here with larger
landscapes<00:01:22.860> and<00:01:23.189> more<00:01:23.340> zoomed<00:01:23.610> out<00:01:23.759> settings

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
landscapes and more zoomed out settings

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.890 
landscapes and more zoomed out settings
we<00:01:25.110> have<00:01:25.439> sort<00:01:25.710> of<00:01:25.770> low<00:01:26.100> 20s<00:01:26.909> so<00:01:27.270> again<00:01:27.630> we're

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
we have sort of low 20s so again we're

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.630 
we have sort of low 20s so again we're
getting<00:01:28.200> dips<00:01:28.530> in<00:01:28.740> frame<00:01:29.009> rate<00:01:29.250> which<00:01:29.460> isn't

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
getting dips in frame rate which isn't

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:39.010 
getting dips in frame rate which isn't
ideal<00:01:31.549> and<00:01:32.689> onto<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:33.810> third<00:01:34.020> scene<00:01:34.409> here<00:01:37.430> and

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
ideal and onto the third scene here and

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.940 
ideal and onto the third scene here and
again<00:01:40.700> mid<00:01:41.700> 20s<00:01:42.299> to<00:01:42.509> 30<00:01:42.869> frames<00:01:43.229> per<00:01:43.380> second

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
again mid 20s to 30 frames per second

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.469 
again mid 20s to 30 frames per second
down<00:01:44.670> to<00:01:44.850> sort<00:01:45.030> of<00:01:45.090> low<00:01:45.270> twenties<00:01:45.780> there<00:01:47.479> and

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
down to sort of low twenties there and

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.080 
down to sort of low twenties there and
in<00:01:49.110> the<00:01:49.200> final<00:01:49.619> scene<00:01:49.890> here<00:01:50.280> where<00:01:50.310> we<00:01:50.759> sort<00:01:51.060> of

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
in the final scene here where we sort of

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.609 
in the final scene here where we sort of
fly<00:01:51.270> through<00:01:51.299> and<00:01:51.689> follow<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:52.020> jet<00:01:52.259> and<00:01:52.500> get

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
fly through and follow the jet and get

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.370 
fly through and follow the jet and get
more<00:01:52.829> gameplay<00:01:53.369> scenario<00:01:53.970> where<00:01:54.720> typically

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
more gameplay scenario where typically

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.200 
more gameplay scenario where typically
I'm<00:01:55.799> sorry<00:01:56.100> one<00:01:56.310> more<00:01:56.490> before<00:01:56.820> that<00:01:57.000> we're

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
I'm sorry one more before that we're

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.270 
I'm sorry one more before that we're
typically<00:01:57.780> around<00:01:58.049> sort<00:01:58.530> of<00:01:58.649> 30<00:01:58.860> frames<00:01:59.189> per

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
typically around sort of 30 frames per

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.850 
typically around sort of 30 frames per
second<00:01:59.759> but<00:01:59.969> then<00:02:00.540> it<00:02:00.719> does<00:02:00.960> dip<00:02:01.439> under<00:02:01.619> that

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
second but then it does dip under that

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.530 
second but then it does dip under that
so<00:02:02.159> even<00:02:02.490> if<00:02:02.579> you're<00:02:02.729> playing<00:02:02.850> on<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:03.240> half

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
so even if you're playing on the half

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.590 
so even if you're playing on the half
vsync<00:02:04.200> mode<00:02:04.700> you're<00:02:05.700> not<00:02:05.880> going<00:02:06.119> to<00:02:06.210> have<00:02:06.360> a

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
vsync mode you're not going to have a

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.809 
vsync mode you're not going to have a
rock-solid<00:02:06.990> frame<00:02:07.770> rate<00:02:08.009> with<00:02:08.220> this<00:02:08.429> you<00:02:08.670> are

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
rock-solid frame rate with this you are

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.780 
rock-solid frame rate with this you are
gonna<00:02:09.000> get<00:02:09.270> dips<00:02:09.569> and<00:02:09.989> slow<00:02:10.920> down<00:02:11.190> as<00:02:11.459> it<00:02:11.489> goes

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
gonna get dips and slow down as it goes

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.330 
gonna get dips and slow down as it goes
along<00:02:12.030> and

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
along and

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.460 
along and
but<00:02:13.849> if<00:02:14.239> you<00:02:14.629> want<00:02:14.840> to<00:02:14.959> play<00:02:15.110> it<00:02:15.200> on<00:02:15.319> one<00:02:15.440> of

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
but if you want to play it on one of

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.030 
but if you want to play it on one of
these<00:02:15.620> laptops<00:02:16.099> then<00:02:17.090> it<00:02:17.660> is<00:02:17.870> a<00:02:18.230> playable

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
these laptops then it is a playable

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.150 
these laptops then it is a playable
experience<00:02:19.700> it's<00:02:19.940> not<00:02:20.209> a<00:02:20.709> perfect<00:02:21.709> experience

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
experience it's not a perfect experience

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.000 
experience it's not a perfect experience
but<00:02:22.640> you<00:02:22.760> can<00:02:23.000> get<00:02:23.269> by<00:02:23.480> and<00:02:23.840> run<00:02:24.110> the<00:02:24.290> title<00:02:24.739> as

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
but you can get by and run the title as

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.960 
but you can get by and run the title as
it<00:02:25.700> is<00:02:26.260> through<00:02:27.260> this<00:02:27.470> section<00:02:27.860> over<00:02:28.400> a<00:02:28.580> couple

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
it is through this section over a couple

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.500 
it is through this section over a couple
runs<00:02:29.390> I<00:02:29.900> got<00:02:30.080> averages<00:02:30.590> around<00:02:30.920> sort<00:02:31.190> of<00:02:31.310> 28<00:02:31.910> 31

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
runs I got averages around sort of 28 31

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.640 
runs I got averages around sort of 28 31
frames<00:02:33.019> per<00:02:33.260> second<00:02:35.110> so<00:02:36.110> you<00:02:36.170> do<00:02:36.379> get<00:02:36.590> some

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
frames per second so you do get some

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.830 
frames per second so you do get some
lower<00:02:37.069> dips<00:02:37.370> in<00:02:37.549> framerate<00:02:37.819> but<00:02:38.239> as<00:02:38.480> you<00:02:38.690> can

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
lower dips in framerate but as you can

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.449 
lower dips in framerate but as you can
see<00:02:39.049> through<00:02:39.379> sort<00:02:39.650> of<00:02:39.709> the<00:02:39.769> more<00:02:39.980> gameplay

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
see through sort of the more gameplay

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:43.119 
see through sort of the more gameplay
segments<00:02:41.120> with<00:02:41.330> less<00:02:41.989> action<00:02:42.500> going<00:02:42.769> on<00:02:42.920> we're

00:02:43.119 --> 00:02:43.129 
segments with less action going on we're

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:47.500 
segments with less action going on we're
typically<00:02:43.580> around<00:02:43.819> 30<00:02:44.209> frames<00:02:44.540> per<00:02:44.690> second<00:02:46.510> so

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
typically around 30 frames per second so

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.660 
typically around 30 frames per second so
it's<00:02:47.540> not<00:02:48.140> a<00:02:48.200> perfect<00:02:48.470> experience<00:02:49.040> but<00:02:49.459> if<00:02:49.549> you

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
it's not a perfect experience but if you

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.089 
it's not a perfect experience but if you
