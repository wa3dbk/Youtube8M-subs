mr.<00:03:45.019> buns<00:03:45.260> trying<00:03:45.620> to<00:03:45.680> take<00:03:45.829> the<00:03:45.920> throne<00:03:45.950> would

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
mr. buns trying to take the throne would

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:47.949 
mr. buns trying to take the throne would
you<00:03:46.489> try<00:03:46.670> to<00:03:46.730> do<00:03:46.940> there<00:03:47.150> I<00:03:47.359> think<00:03:47.690> he<00:03:47.750> was<00:03:47.870> just

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:47.959 
you try to do there I think he was just

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:49.270 
you try to do there I think he was just
trying<00:03:48.079> to<00:03:48.200> stop<00:03:48.350> that<00:03:48.410> momentum<00:03:48.769> and<00:03:49.010> you

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 
trying to stop that momentum and you

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.640 
trying to stop that momentum and you
can't<00:03:49.489> do<00:03:49.640> that<00:03:49.820> in<00:03:50.060> that<00:03:50.209> situation<00:03:50.750> I<00:03:50.959> think

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
can't do that in that situation I think

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:53.289 
can't do that in that situation I think
at<00:03:51.709> this<00:03:51.829> point<00:03:52.100> kind<00:03:52.730> of<00:03:52.850> lethal<00:03:53.090> really

00:03:53.289 --> 00:03:53.299 
at this point kind of lethal really

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:55.390 
at this point kind of lethal really
recognizes<00:03:54.290> that<00:03:54.410> he<00:03:54.620> can't<00:03:54.890> just<00:03:55.160> sit<00:03:55.310> still

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
recognizes that he can't just sit still

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.130 
recognizes that he can't just sit still
on<00:03:55.549> that<00:03:55.760> first<00:03:56.000> character<00:03:56.390> know<00:03:56.690> his

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:57.140 
on that first character know his

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:59.590 
on that first character know his
character<00:03:57.290> really<00:03:57.829> set<00:03:58.040> him<00:03:58.100> far<00:03:58.340> back<00:03:58.579> and<00:03:58.850> he

00:03:59.590 --> 00:03:59.600 
character really set him far back and he

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.720 
character really set him far back and he
needs<00:03:59.780> to<00:03:59.989> be<00:04:00.769> able<00:04:00.950> to<00:04:01.040> do<00:04:01.160> something<00:04:01.579> and

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
needs to be able to do something and

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:03.520 
needs to be able to do something and
it's<00:04:01.850> really<00:04:02.180> difficult<00:04:02.420> though<00:04:02.870> because<00:04:02.900> in

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.530 
it's really difficult though because in

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:06.130 
it's really difficult though because in
the<00:04:04.489> situations<00:04:05.090> that<00:04:05.150> our<00:04:05.480> case<00:04:05.720> our<00:04:05.870> cradle

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:06.140 
the situations that our case our cradle

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:08.500 
the situations that our case our cradle
puts<00:04:06.320> him<00:04:06.440> in<00:04:06.590> he's<00:04:06.980> Reynold<00:04:07.730> is<00:04:07.820> usually<00:04:08.239> safe

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:08.510 
puts him in he's Reynold is usually safe

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:12.350 
puts him in he's Reynold is usually safe
and<00:04:08.870> it<00:04:09.739> forces<00:04:10.130> kind<00:04:10.400> of<00:04:10.459> legal<00:04:10.609> to<00:04:10.820> uh

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:12.360 
and it forces kind of legal to uh

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:16.039 
and it forces kind of legal to uh
macGruber<00:04:13.160> yeah<00:04:14.160> and<00:04:14.630> kind<00:04:15.630> of<00:04:15.720> illegals

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
macGruber yeah and kind of illegals

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:17.630 
macGruber yeah and kind of illegals
trying<00:04:16.290> not<00:04:16.470> to<00:04:16.530> be<00:04:16.680> risky<00:04:17.040> I<00:04:17.190> think<00:04:17.400> he's<00:04:17.489> got

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:17.640 
trying not to be risky I think he's got

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:18.830 
trying not to be risky I think he's got
the<00:04:17.730> change<00:04:17.910> gained<00:04:18.150> over<00:04:18.269> that<00:04:18.510> thank

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
personally did not remember the second

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:39.800 
personally did not remember the second
to<00:04:35.060> empty<00:04:36.060> there<00:04:36.270> and<00:04:36.540> again<00:04:37.850> down<00:04:38.850> you<00:04:39.540> try<00:04:39.750> to

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:39.810 
to empty there and again down you try to

really<00:04:42.330> that<00:04:42.810> much<00:04:42.990> more<00:04:43.230> complicated<00:04:43.620> when

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.010 
really that much more complicated when

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:45.230 
really that much more complicated when
you're<00:04:44.100> playing<00:04:44.310> a<00:04:44.460> top<00:04:44.640> player<00:04:44.880> like<00:04:45.120> our

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
you're playing a top player like our

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:46.400 
you're playing a top player like our
case<00:04:45.390> awkwardly<00:04:45.780> you<00:04:45.930> have<00:04:46.050> to<00:04:46.169> find

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:46.410 
case awkwardly you have to find

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:48.440 
case awkwardly you have to find
somewhere<00:04:46.980> in<00:04:47.070> the<00:04:47.130> middle<00:04:47.460> to<00:04:47.850> make<00:04:48.030> yourself

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:48.450 
somewhere in the middle to make yourself

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:51.860 
somewhere in the middle to make yourself
not<00:04:49.020> as<00:04:49.950> susceptible<00:04:50.610> to<00:04:51.090> get<00:04:51.270> him<00:04:51.360> blown<00:04:51.540> up

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:51.870 
not as susceptible to get him blown up

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:54.140 
not as susceptible to get him blown up
exactly<00:04:52.350> and<00:04:52.950> Reynolds<00:04:53.550> gonna<00:04:53.730> find<00:04:54.030> that

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:54.150 
exactly and Reynolds gonna find that

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:55.790 
exactly and Reynolds gonna find that
hole<00:04:54.390> eventually<00:04:54.900> the<00:04:55.200> thing<00:04:55.380> is<00:04:55.560> get<00:04:55.740> the

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 
hole eventually the thing is get the

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:56.750 
hole eventually the thing is get the
little<00:04:55.950> bit<00:04:56.040> away<00:04:56.250> from<00:04:56.280> him

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:56.760 
little bit away from him

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:58.760 
little bit away from him
so<00:04:57.120> far<00:04:57.360> I<00:04:57.390> really<00:04:57.570> believe<00:04:57.990> he's<00:04:58.530> thought

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770 
so far I really believe he's thought

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:01.610 
so far I really believe he's thought
