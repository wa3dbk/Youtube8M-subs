00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
I'll highlight a couple of them I think

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.990 
I'll highlight a couple of them I think
there<00:00:12.000> were<00:00:12.090> most<00:00:12.469> significant<00:00:13.469> Force<00:00:14.000> one

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
there were most significant Force one

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.529 
there were most significant Force one
was<00:00:15.150> the<00:00:15.269> p80<00:00:15.540> rule<00:00:15.929> this<00:00:16.920> is<00:00:16.980> a<00:00:17.160> rule<00:00:17.310> that<00:00:17.789> we

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
was the p80 rule this is a rule that we

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.800 
was the p80 rule this is a rule that we
have<00:00:18.570> been<00:00:18.779> focused<00:00:19.140> on<00:00:19.260> for<00:00:19.320> quite<00:00:19.770> some<00:00:20.010> time

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:20.810 
have been focused on for quite some time

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:23.000 
have been focused on for quite some time
it's<00:00:21.810> a<00:00:21.900> play<00:00:22.140> that<00:00:22.170> we<00:00:22.500> think<00:00:22.740> is<00:00:22.859> not

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
it's a play that we think is not

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.810 
it's a play that we think is not
exciting<00:00:23.550> a<00:00:23.640> play<00:00:23.880> that<00:00:24.740> we<00:00:25.740> think<00:00:25.980> could<00:00:26.189> be

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
exciting a play that we think could be

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.870 
exciting a play that we think could be
improved<00:00:27.320> we<00:00:28.320> have<00:00:28.590> competition<00:00:29.490> committee

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
improved we have competition committee

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.970 
improved we have competition committee
made<00:00:30.240> a<00:00:30.269> recommendation<00:00:30.689> on<00:00:31.349> that<00:00:31.529> to<00:00:31.679> move<00:00:31.800> it

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
made a recommendation on that to move it

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.479 
made a recommendation on that to move it
back<00:00:32.730> to<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:33.000> 15<00:00:33.829> -<00:00:34.829> kick<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.040> extra<00:00:35.280> point

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
back to the 15 - kick the extra point

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.030 
back to the 15 - kick the extra point
and<00:00:35.880> also<00:00:36.480> to<00:00:36.690> allow<00:00:37.079> the<00:00:37.140> defense<00:00:37.620> to<00:00:37.770> score

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
and also to allow the defense to score

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.660 
and also to allow the defense to score
we<00:00:38.190> think<00:00:38.430> those<00:00:39.120> changes<00:00:39.600> are<00:00:39.950> terrific

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
we think those changes are terrific

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.580 
we think those changes are terrific
we<00:00:42.059> thought<00:00:42.360> of<00:00:42.420> some<00:00:42.690> other<00:00:42.870> ideas<00:00:43.320> in<00:00:43.500> the

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
we thought of some other ideas in the

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.040 
we thought of some other ideas in the
context<00:00:44.070> of<00:00:44.190> that<00:00:44.370> but<00:00:45.300> I<00:00:45.329> think<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:45.690> bottom

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
context of that but I think the bottom

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.380 
context of that but I think the bottom
line<00:00:46.230> on<00:00:46.590> that<00:00:46.620> is<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:47.640> ownership<00:00:47.850> would<00:00:48.180> like

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
line on that is the ownership would like

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.270 
line on that is the ownership would like
to<00:00:48.570> see<00:00:48.780> us<00:00:48.809> do<00:00:49.110> this<00:00:49.260> in<00:00:49.320> stages<00:00:49.860> so<00:00:49.890> we<00:00:50.129> can

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
to see us do this in stages so we can

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.520 
to see us do this in stages so we can
see<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.550> impact<00:00:50.879> of<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.960> changes<00:00:52.350> and

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
see the impact of the changes and

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.229 
see the impact of the changes and
evaluate<00:00:53.219> that<00:00:53.250> as<00:00:53.610> we<00:00:53.730> go<00:00:53.879> through<00:00:53.910> the

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
going to be implemented in everything we

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.390 
going to be implemented in everything we

do this coming season and for the future

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.100 
do this coming season and for the future
I<00:03:10.400> think<00:03:10.910> those<00:03:11.090> are<00:03:11.239> the<00:03:11.269> key<00:03:11.510> issues<00:03:11.840> one

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110 
I think those are the key issues one

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.770 
I think those are the key issues one
final<00:03:12.620> thing<00:03:12.769> I<00:03:12.860> guess<00:03:13.010> was<00:03:13.220> a<00:03:13.459> very<00:03:14.359> important

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
final thing I guess was a very important

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.960 
final thing I guess was a very important
issue<00:03:15.109> for<00:03:15.320> us<00:03:15.590> which<00:03:15.890> is<00:03:15.920> stadium<00:03:16.820> security

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970
