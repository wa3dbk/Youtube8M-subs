00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.899 
know I probably could have lost more and
I<00:02:03.810> probably<00:02:04.049> could<00:02:04.500> have<00:02:04.530> but<00:02:05.100> in<00:02:05.369> the<00:02:05.670> past

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
wanted to lose it as slow as I possibly

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.860 
wanted to lose it as slow as I possibly
can<00:02:17.530> so<00:02:17.860> that<00:02:18.460> way<00:02:18.730> it'll<00:02:18.880> stay<00:02:19.150> off<00:02:19.270> long<00:02:19.630> term

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870

but like the 30 that I've lost by the

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:20.789 
but like the 30 that I've lost by the
time<00:04:19.330> we<00:04:19.450> go<00:04:19.570> in<00:04:19.690> May<00:04:19.840> and<00:04:20.109> then<00:04:20.290> an<00:04:20.560> additional

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:20.799 
time we go in May and then an additional

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:24.870 
time we go in May and then an additional
20<00:04:21.459> so<00:04:21.700> a<00:04:21.729> total<00:04:22.000> of<00:04:22.180> 50<00:04:22.630> by<00:04:22.870> I<00:04:23.610> don't<00:04:24.610> know

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440 
maybe by the time

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.830 
maybe by the time
the<00:04:26.740> girls<00:04:27.040> go<00:04:27.760> to<00:04:27.790> school<00:04:27.940> again<00:04:28.600> well

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020 
be down 50 pounds total so that'll

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:39.480 
be down 50 pounds total so that'll
