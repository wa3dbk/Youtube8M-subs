00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:12.920
 hello everyone we meet so 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:15.950
 live los angeles with carnage 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:17.420
 hello to all this carnage so what are 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:19.070
 your first impressions about the 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:20.210
 room is precisely the locals who are 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:22.430
 friends the arrangements for his ribs 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.930
 championship is that it's huge 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:25.849
 is that there is no lan that you 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:27.830
 pushes to 32 stations to turn two 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:30.669
 teams have similarly no longer 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:33.079
 then yeah that's the one finally I hope 

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:33.980
 we know that lately 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:34.760
 was a bit complicated at the level 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.400
 results 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:40.520
 especially after we're actually going to say 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:43.930
 counter-performances that are not due 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.650
 precisely at your level but rather at 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.000
 the mental approach you had 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:48.680
 during tournaments is what you 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.600
 are confident about this for this coach 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.750
 benchikha I have no idea 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.170
 after making a top 4 a top3 a top 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.560
 12 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:59.960
 a top of all me that was 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:02.420
 janouille and be done take it I 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.130
 do not know we'll see it's a bit 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.960
 apprehension after discovering the 

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:07.910
 hen who is a little hen the 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.010
 higher with group 7 but 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:11.900
 just what is lamentable knows 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:12.250
 more con to these as it's either 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.570
 past 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.580
 and in this case it goes and we'll be 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:19.040
 well hot buildings it breaks and 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:21.140
 mathieu 32nd what 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.880
 and what are your precisely yours 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.220
 you your goals after that is that of 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.630
 championship 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:30.700
 no I have no idea in a patient 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:32.960
 is No. 4 I do not know if what how where 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.330
 i can not tell you that switzerland 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.640
 will happen so we'll say it's 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:39.770
 maybe the competition of your career 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.110
 so it does not serve the last in any case 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:46.190
 it's a risk if we crash it risks n 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:48.080
 1 to surf there in any case just a 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:48.530
 little question if you win the 400 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.830
 thousand dollars 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:54.080
 what are you doing with so there 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:56.330
 what you did not even think I risked 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.040
 to be very soul the first Sunday 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.120
 evening did not stop Sunday on Sunday 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.540
 evening I'll go on all fours 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:05.450
 in the plane meiway the party feast but 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:08.320
 not invite all thoughts to file 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:11.240
 not go away and weird this thing of the kind 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:12.470
 for you it is to coach a guy his more 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:15.140
 prestigious is more difficult to win 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.830
 that one mlg has widely there are all 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.510
 European teams 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.310
 there is actually only the best 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.420
 teams do not miss to have a brac 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.620
 is simple 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.910
 so could you notice 5 if you 're 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.350
 luck if you come across fast 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.930
 combs and program only a little 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.670
 less force but otherwise there is what there is 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.220
 four five teams who are who have 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.959
 passed through the sixteen teams whose 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.670
 the scenes at 4 5 4 5 that have passed that 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:36.320
 we speak a level that at worst knew 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.270
 win a round you finish top top 12 but 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:40.040
 after you would have that big 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:41.270
 you have a little bit old the table if 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.100
 you finish second is what you 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:45.050
 know who you risk falling into 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.790

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:49.550
