granted<00:03:38.050> there's<00:03:38.320> of<00:03:38.500> course<00:03:38.530> there's<00:03:38.920> a

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
granted there's of course there's a

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:40.620 
granted there's of course there's a
price<00:03:39.160> to<00:03:39.190> pay<00:03:39.310> for<00:03:39.400> that<00:03:39.670> these<00:03:40.240> are<00:03:40.450> not

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:40.630 
price to pay for that these are not

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:43.170 
price to pay for that these are not
cheap<00:03:40.900> these<00:03:41.080> retail<00:03:41.470> for<00:03:41.500> 189<00:03:42.400> almost<00:03:43.060> two

cheap these retail for 189 almost two

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.150 
cheap these retail for 189 almost two
hundred<00:03:43.300> dollars<00:03:43.690> so<00:03:44.380> you're<00:03:44.650> paying<00:03:44.950> for

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.160 
hundred dollars so you're paying for

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.790 
hundred dollars so you're paying for
that<00:03:45.250> that<00:03:45.490> quality<00:03:45.850> sound<00:03:46.060> but<00:03:46.440> in<00:03:47.440> my

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:47.800 
that that quality sound but in my

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:48.750 
that that quality sound but in my
opinion<00:03:47.890> even<00:03:48.220> though<00:03:48.370> they<00:03:48.490> are<00:03:48.580> very

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
opinion even though they are very

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.670 
opinion even though they are very
expensive<00:03:49.030> that's<00:03:49.450> definitely<00:03:49.870> worth<00:03:50.020> it<00:03:50.260> the

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 
expensive that's definitely worth it the

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.200 
expensive that's definitely worth it the
sound<00:03:50.920> quality<00:03:51.040> is<00:03:51.280> excellent<00:03:51.400> and<00:03:52.000> so<00:03:52.060> these

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:52.210 
sound quality is excellent and so these

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:53.340 
sound quality is excellent and so these
are<00:03:52.360> the<00:03:52.390> tips<00:03:52.660> I<00:03:52.780> was<00:03:52.870> talking<00:03:53.050> about<00:03:53.110> those

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:53.350 
are the tips I was talking about those

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:54.480 
are the tips I was talking about those
foam<00:03:53.590> tip<00:03:53.830> so<00:03:53.920> you<00:03:53.980> can<00:03:54.070> kind<00:03:54.220> of<00:03:54.250> crammed

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:54.490 
foam tip so you can kind of crammed

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:56.550 
foam tip so you can kind of crammed
these<00:03:54.670> in<00:03:54.820> really<00:03:55.510> small<00:03:55.750> like<00:03:55.930> that<00:03:56.170> stick

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 
these in really small like that stick

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.380 
these in really small like that stick
them<00:03:56.620> in<00:03:56.710> your<00:03:56.740> year<00:03:56.980> and<00:03:57.010> I<00:03:57.130> slowly<00:03:57.550> expand

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:58.390 
them in your year and I slowly expand

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:00.270 
them in your year and I slowly expand

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:08.050 
someone next to talking to you and you

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:09.420 
someone next to talking to you and you
won't<00:04:08.200> even<00:04:08.290> know<00:04:08.500> they're<00:04:08.620> there<00:04:08.860> talking<00:04:09.370> to

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 
won't even know they're there talking to

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:11.700 
won't even know they're there talking to
you<00:04:09.520> that's<00:04:09.760> how<00:04:09.880> that's<00:04:10.150> how<00:04:10.240> well<00:04:10.420> it<00:04:10.540> is<00:04:10.710> and

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:11.710 
you that's how that's how well it is and

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:13.080 
you that's how that's how well it is and
so<00:04:11.950> if<00:04:12.040> you<00:04:12.100> can<00:04:12.220> kind<00:04:12.370> of<00:04:12.400> tell<00:04:12.580> this<00:04:12.730> is<00:04:12.910> this

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.090 
so if you can kind of tell this is this

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:14.460 
so if you can kind of tell this is this
one<00:04:13.270> right<00:04:13.360> here<00:04:13.420> is<00:04:13.600> read<00:04:13.810> the<00:04:14.170> inside

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:14.470 
one right here is read the inside

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:16.470 
one right here is read the inside
plastic<00:04:14.680> piece<00:04:14.980> and<00:04:15.220> this<00:04:15.310> is<00:04:15.430> black<00:04:15.700> so<00:04:16.359> it's

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:16.480 
plastic piece and this is black so it's

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:17.910 
plastic piece and this is black so it's
an<00:04:16.570> easier<00:04:16.810> way<00:04:16.930> to<00:04:16.960> tell<00:04:17.290> okay<00:04:17.560> which<00:04:17.710> is<00:04:17.830> the

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:17.920 
an easier way to tell okay which is the

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:19.080 
an easier way to tell okay which is the
right<00:04:18.070> which<00:04:18.190> is<00:04:18.310> the<00:04:18.400> left<00:04:18.580> we'll<00:04:18.729> just<00:04:19.030> look

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.090 
right which is the left we'll just look

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:21.240 
right which is the left we'll just look
for<00:04:19.239> the<00:04:19.299> red<00:04:19.560> I'm<00:04:20.560> not<00:04:20.680> sure<00:04:20.739> if<00:04:20.950> that<00:04:20.979> shows

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.250
