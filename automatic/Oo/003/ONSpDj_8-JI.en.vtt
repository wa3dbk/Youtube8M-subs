00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 Hello everyone today, I would like to express 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:07.560
 my opinion with me will probably 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:10.040
 according to 80 90 percent of motorists 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.280
 who has such an accessory as 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.920
 auto shutter 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:17.600
 as indicated by the manufacturer of these blinds 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:21.210
 can be removed and put on in 10 15 seconds 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:27.029
 now we take a look here you see in 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:29.130
 Basically nothing complicated removal no well 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.900
 while we dress too big 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:35.160
 there were no difficulties 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:37.770
 in the slots of the magnets but the most important joint 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.800
 these curtains, they are not suitable for all brands 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:44.520
 car in my case is kia seed 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:47.460
 if i close this door then this one 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.920
 rezinochka she will stop me from removing this 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.840
 the curtain I mean if you stopped 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.820
 traffic cop 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.649
 policeman already in our case and you 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.109
 the door is closed then to remove this line 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.359
 you have to open the door to remove this 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:03.570
 the curtain and then it says that the withdrawal account 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:07.290
 I give did just like they say gentlemen well 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:09.270
 already a minus of these blinds the second you 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.330
 drive up to the parking lot 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.180
 you need to take a card or ticket as 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.430
 we made it 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:20.759
 again the window you will not be able to open you 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.680
 will have to open the door to go take 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.049
 this card and sits back in 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.360
 car huge minus of these 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:30.030
 the curtains is that through them all 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:33.689
 I can see everything just installed 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.790
 shutter light permeability 15 but how do you 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:38.579
 see all that is in the car can be seen 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.350
 she hides only the big picture but not 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.259
 more 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:44.520
 the second major drawback is if 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:46.860
 the sun will be different to you through the frontal 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.049
 the glass is to move from the inside to the curtain you 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.590
 see nothing except this one 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:54.149
 the curtains are very uncomfortable and thirdly yes 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.550
 nothing at all through these blinds 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.860
 see at night 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:00.140
 only if the car will go without steam 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.800
 you won't see her at all very bad 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.480
 distinctness 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.980
 and even look at ads from 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:06.080
 some beautiful girl you have not 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:09.050
 get push our eyes will be dug 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:11.060
 so here from this mesh well that's all 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.220
 what can i say about these curtains guys 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.490
 think before you buy 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.490
 well
