00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.953
I was told it was a melanoma.

00:00:01.954 --> 00:00:04.273
Like small mole made with a pen.

00:00:04.274 --> 00:00:06.328
My dreams completely changed.

00:00:06.329 --> 00:00:08.933
The moles started to appear.

00:00:08.934 --> 00:00:11.162
I'd say that absolutelly
everything changed.

00:00:11.163 --> 00:00:13.212
And no one is free from cancer.

00:00:13.213 --> 00:00:16.903
I thought I had a quiet life.

00:00:16.904 --> 00:00:18.669
I used to travel a lot.

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:21.037
I was at the top of my career.

00:00:21.038 --> 00:00:25.220
About 11 or 12 years ago,
I started to surf.

00:00:25.221 --> 00:00:30.119
I had a relatively small patch
on my skin, it was a spot.

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:33.568
As I used to go to the beach
almost every weekend...

00:00:33.569 --> 00:00:36.322
a very small mole appeared.

00:00:36.323 --> 00:00:39.344
A mole appeared on my back...

00:00:39.345 --> 00:00:43.029
and it started to change
in shape and size.

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:45.647
I noticed an irregular growth.

00:00:45.648 --> 00:00:48.700
That caught my attention,
but I didn't care much.

00:00:48.701 --> 00:00:50.801
His cancer was
discovered very small...

00:00:50.802 --> 00:00:52.414
on the face, on the nose.

00:00:52.415 --> 00:00:57.317
My husband said: “This mole is
bad, go to a dermatologist”.

00:00:57.318 --> 00:01:02.163
After my uncle convincing me,
I went to the dermatologist.

00:01:02.164 --> 00:01:06.717
One year later, taking my son
to the dermatologist...

00:01:06.718 --> 00:01:11.909
she asked if there was any history
of skin cancer in the family.

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:18.190
I discovered in a biopsy that
I had a melanoma on my nose.

00:01:18.191 --> 00:01:20.077
I was told it was a melanoma.

00:01:20.078 --> 00:01:25.449
"It looks like a melanoma",
but I didn’t know what it was.

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.298
That was when I knew...

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:32.167
I had to explain to myself
what was happening.

00:01:32.168 --> 00:01:35.271
I didn’t believe it,
I felt nothing... 

00:01:35.272 --> 00:01:39.582
no pain, it didn’t look
that big on the skin.

00:01:39.583 --> 00:01:41.495
So how could I have cancer?

00:01:41.496 --> 00:01:45.448
Melanoma is a common cancer,
as any other invasive cancer...

00:01:45.449 --> 00:01:47.083
and it can kill.

00:01:47.084 --> 00:01:48.819
My world fell apart.

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:50.336
I was knocked off my feet.

00:01:50.337 --> 00:01:54.920
Right after that, the surgical
procedures were carried on. 

00:01:54.921 --> 00:01:59.875
They had to take a margin of
one centimeter on the left side...

00:01:59.876 --> 00:02:03.680
that is, they took a part
of the nose and rebuild it. 

00:02:03.681 --> 00:02:06.105
I had a lot of difficult
moments on treatment. 

00:02:06.106 --> 00:02:07.952
It is a painful process.

00:02:07.953 --> 00:02:14.234
I believe that I won’t go back
surfing due to sun exposure.

00:02:14.235 --> 00:02:17.813
I used to put on
sunscreen once...

00:02:17.814 --> 00:02:21.641
and only 4 or 5 hours later,
I'd remember to use it again.

00:02:21.642 --> 00:02:25.125
My husband was reluctant.
He'd put it on in the morning...

00:02:25.126 --> 00:02:27.897
And then, he would say:
"Oh, I've already used it".

00:02:27.898 --> 00:02:31.726
It was partly because I was lazy,
and because of being smeared.

00:02:31.727 --> 00:02:36.593
It is important to use sunscreen,
even in the city...

00:02:36.594 --> 00:02:40.191
because the sun can be
bad for skin anywhere.

00:02:40.192 --> 00:02:44.291
Do a self-exam,
look at your body...

00:02:44.292 --> 00:02:46.115
look if there are any moles.

00:02:46.116 --> 00:02:48.101
This is a message for men...

00:02:48.102 --> 00:02:51.745
There is nothing effeminate
about using sunscreen.

00:02:51.746 --> 00:02:56.192
Everything that can be done
to contribute to disseminate it...

00:02:56.193 --> 00:03:01.907
to clarify it and
to prevent it is essential.

00:03:01.908 --> 00:03:05.174
Skin cancer reaches the
highest rates in Brazil.

00:03:05.175 --> 00:03:07.370
There are approximately,
among men and women...

00:03:07.371 --> 00:03:10.043
120.000 new cases
every year. 

00:03:10.044 --> 00:03:14.703
Am I paying attention to
the spots I have on my body? 

00:03:14.704 --> 00:03:17.815
How often do I go
to the dermatologist?

00:03:17.816 --> 00:03:22.074
How am I using sunscreen?
We must be informed...

00:03:22.075 --> 00:03:28.462
we must be aware, and able to
spread a responsible message.
