00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 the national day of refusal of failure 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.400
 school today is this sixth 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:06.120
 edition focuses on high school 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.460
 professional 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.860
 on this occasion a study shows that 16 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.150
 % of schoolchildren and college students 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.769
 do not understand what is being asked of them 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.360
 class and that one hundred and fifty thousand 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.990
 students leave the school system without 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.730
 diploma be close to one in five 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:22.439
 is precisely how to avoid that 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.820
 young people drop how to demonstrate to them 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.410
 we are interested in them 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.820
 it is on this question that the team 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.680
 pedagogy of a regional high school 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.480
 Parisian bent over she instituted 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.279
 individual interviews with 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.230
 students from the start of the year the opportunity to 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.180
 meet the high school students to listen to them and 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.489
 to guide them in their projects a 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.129
 paid approach 4 5 rbds 12 and david's 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.300
 malaise we will work on being 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.670
 citizens in the Roman empire 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.620
 so what does it mean to be a 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.170
 citizen the rights the homework that is 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.449
 citizen agree the theme of the course 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.550
 of history of the day be citizen under 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.770
 the worsened Roman and to assimilate his 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.059
 knowledge this second class has 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.670
 been divided into two groups 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:02.160
 then already those to be pumped 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.110
 it's when we believe a lot think about 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.420
 pretty much there less charged classes 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.189
 but also support classes in the evening 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.580
 cultural activities every 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.530
 weeks 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.610
 as well as a personalized follow-up of 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.170
 students throughout the year 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.760
 the new organization of 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.520
 the institution was established here in 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.710
 2009 and for samy who just arrived at 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.080
 high school transition with college 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.880
 so was done smoothly thanks to 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.140
 this new method of teaching in 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.540
 cornered on canvas and 2000 Group 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:31.650
 because we get to how to say that 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.850
 but this concentrate but yahia not there is not 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.340
 a lot of people in the class is 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.290
 like a glass that they like to help us 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.070
 who I feel they want them 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.320
 want to help us a lot 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.450
 teachers do not cross each other in wood on 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.360
 is not what we do not think at all 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.710
 and to discuss a problem of 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.509
 geometry with a teacher at 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.430
 intercourse nothing very surprising no 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.409
 more and students are even encouraged to 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.789
 do it because the proximity to the 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.350
 teachers even outside classes 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:56.789
 is also a priority of 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.210
 establishment in the schooling of 

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:59.280
 students 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.899
 we frame my attempt to take it all 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.880
 gently towards autonomy so that he 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:04.710
 take into account these difficulties which 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.060
 left himself to remedy these 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.469
 difficulties in going to find the right 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.479
 no one to help him 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:11.009
 no additional financial means 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.480
 been allocated to this public high school for the 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.549
 setting up this organization 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.040
 the budget was simply used 

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:19.200
 differently and that seems to work 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:22.970
 for proof the success rate 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.970
 General is close to 100%
