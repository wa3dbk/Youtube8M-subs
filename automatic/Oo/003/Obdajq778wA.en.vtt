00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:43.100 
think that would be the case right but

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.950 
think that would be the case right but
the<00:00:44.100> first<00:00:44.309> game<00:00:44.550> we<00:00:44.760> go<00:00:44.940> into<00:00:45.149> we<00:00:45.629> come<00:00:45.840> up

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.460 
ball in in the second half but I was
really<00:01:53.340> I<00:01:53.579> was<00:01:53.670> not<00:01:53.970> getting<00:01:54.240> any<00:01:54.479> worthy

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
really I was not getting any worthy

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.100 
really I was not getting any worthy
chances<00:01:56.100> and<00:01:56.340> this<00:01:56.880> game<00:01:57.090> was<00:01:57.270> not<00:01:57.509> really

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
chances and this game was not really

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.109 
chances and this game was not really
going<00:01:58.320> my<00:01:58.530> way<00:01:58.770> his<00:01:59.070> defenders<00:01:59.549> Lee<00:01:59.700> has<00:01:59.909> like

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
going my way his defenders Lee has like

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.359 
going my way his defenders Lee has like
two<00:02:00.689> three<00:02:00.719> four<00:02:01.380> defenders<00:02:01.860> around<00:02:02.159> me<00:02:02.280> at

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
two three four defenders around me at

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.780 
two three four defenders around me at
all<00:02:02.460> times<00:02:02.759> so<00:02:03.570> I<00:02:03.630> couldn't<00:02:03.899> get<00:02:03.990> any<00:02:04.140> space

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:04.790 
all times so I couldn't get any space

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.580 
all times so I couldn't get any space
definitely<00:02:05.790> not<00:02:06.000> with<00:02:06.119> Ibrahimovic<00:02:06.600> so<00:02:07.439> there

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
definitely not with Ibrahimovic so there

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.350 
definitely not with Ibrahimovic so there
was<00:02:07.680> no<00:02:07.799> chance<00:02:08.069> of<00:02:08.250> him<00:02:08.399> scoring<00:02:08.759> today<00:02:09.090> and

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
was no chance of him scoring today and

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.460 
was no chance of him scoring today and
then

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
then

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.320 
then
he<00:02:10.619> bounces<00:02:11.160> and<00:02:11.280> stuff<00:02:11.550> keep<00:02:11.760> happening<00:02:11.790> for

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
he bounces and stuff keep happening for

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.730 
he bounces and stuff keep happening for
this<00:02:12.450> guy<00:02:12.630> fair<00:02:12.930> enough<00:02:13.170> he<00:02:13.320> was<00:02:13.410> a<00:02:13.470> better

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740
