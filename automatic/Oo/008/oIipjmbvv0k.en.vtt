apparently the the video that I saw was

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.519 
apparently the the video that I saw was
not<00:00:25.830> correct<00:00:26.580> and<00:00:26.930> I<00:00:27.930> was<00:00:28.080> a<00:00:28.109> little<00:00:28.410> upset

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
not correct and I was a little upset

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.400

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
actual version which I practice sometime

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.680 
actual version which I practice sometime
to<00:00:35.840> try<00:00:36.840> to<00:00:36.899> perfect<00:00:37.739> it<00:00:38.250> so<00:00:38.579> if<00:00:39.329> I<00:00:39.510> make

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
to try to perfect it so if I make

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.549 
to try to perfect it so if I make
mistakes<00:00:39.840> well<00:00:40.500> everybody<00:00:41.460> does<00:00:41.700> but<00:00:42.239> um<00:00:42.559> I'll

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
mistakes well everybody does but um I'll

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.490 
mistakes well everybody does but um I'll
just<00:00:44.010> play<00:00:44.309> through<00:00:44.700> as<00:00:44.910> if<00:00:45.149> it<00:00:45.450> were<00:00:45.660> the

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
just play through as if it were the

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.459 
just play through as if it were the
regular<00:00:46.950> one<00:00:47.160> and<00:00:47.399> then<00:00:48.120> I'll<00:00:48.510> take<00:00:49.079> it<00:00:49.230> step

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
regular one and then I'll take it step

00:00:49.469 --> 00:01:38.770 
regular one and then I'll take it step
by<00:00:49.500> step

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.120 

alright<00:01:39.780> so<00:01:40.049> that<00:01:40.289> was<00:01:40.319> technically<00:01:40.890> the

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
alright so that was technically the

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.190 
alright so that was technically the
first<00:01:41.490> part<00:01:41.939> the<00:01:42.329> other<00:01:43.109> part<00:01:43.439> that<00:01:45.200> who

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
first part the other part that who

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.429 
first part the other part that who
called<00:01:47.069> it's<00:01:47.810> normally<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:48.840> right<00:01:49.170> hand

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
called it's normally the right hand

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.830 
called it's normally the right hand
that's<00:01:49.649> playing<00:01:49.950> most<00:01:50.310> it's<00:01:50.640> just<00:01:51.359> two<00:01:51.659> to

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
that's playing most it's just two to

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.440 
that's playing most it's just two to
three<00:01:52.049> keys<00:01:52.349> um<00:01:52.920> that<00:01:53.579> one's<00:01:53.759> real<00:01:53.969> simple<00:01:54.420> but

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
three keys um that one's real simple but

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.109 
three keys um that one's real simple but
since<00:01:55.259> I<00:01:55.560> still<00:01:56.369> haven't<00:01:56.729> been<00:01:56.849> able<00:01:56.969> to

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
since I still haven't been able to

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.709 
since I still haven't been able to
confirm<00:01:57.630> which<00:01:57.810> notes<00:01:58.109> they<00:01:58.409> are<00:01:58.640> I<00:01:59.640> won't<00:02:00.569> be

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
confirm which notes they are I won't be

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:05.169 
confirm which notes they are I won't be
adding<00:02:01.049> it<00:02:01.379> to<00:02:01.590> them<00:02:01.739> so<00:02:02.429> the<00:02:03.090> first<00:02:03.140> part<00:02:04.140> is

00:02:05.169 --> 00:02:05.179 
adding it to them so the first part is

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:13.130 
adding it to them so the first part is
these<00:02:06.179> four<00:02:07.020> keys<00:02:11.599> so<00:02:12.599> of<00:02:12.750> course<00:02:12.930> you're

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
these four keys so of course you're

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.619 
these four keys so of course you're
going<00:02:13.260> to<00:02:13.319> do<00:02:13.440> that<00:02:13.620> twice<00:02:13.980> and<00:02:14.340> then<00:02:15.180> for<00:02:15.540> the

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:15.629 
going to do that twice and then for the

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:24.110 
going to do that twice and then for the
next<00:02:15.780> part<00:02:16.230> would<00:02:16.650> be

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:36.050 

and<00:02:24.709> then<00:02:25.709> the<00:02:25.830> bottom<00:02:26.010> part<00:02:26.430> and<00:02:34.910> then<00:02:35.910> the

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
and then the bottom part and then the

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:46.369 
and then the bottom part and then the
next<00:02:44.269> now<00:02:45.269> the<00:02:45.360> second<00:02:45.750> part<00:02:45.840> is<00:02:46.019> tricky

00:02:46.369 --> 00:02:46.379 
next now the second part is tricky

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:50.059 
next now the second part is tricky
because<00:02:47.340> even<00:02:48.239> though<00:02:48.420> it's<00:02:48.720> these<00:02:49.440> the<00:02:49.860> four

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:50.069 
because even though it's these the four

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:51.500 
because even though it's these the four
notes<00:02:50.310> at<00:02:50.610> the<00:02:50.640> beginning<00:02:50.819> are<00:02:51.180> still<00:02:51.450> the

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
notes at the beginning are still the

00:02:51.510 --> 00:03:01.190 
notes at the beginning are still the
same<00:02:51.720> which<00:02:52.019> is<00:02:52.049> the<00:02:59.090> tricky<00:03:00.090> part<00:03:00.329> is<00:03:00.510> that<00:03:00.900> at

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
same which is the tricky part is that at

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.860 
same which is the tricky part is that at
the<00:03:01.530> second<00:03:01.890> time<00:03:02.099> it<00:03:02.430> doesn't<00:03:02.819> hit<00:03:03.329> the<00:03:03.569> next

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
the second time it doesn't hit the next

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:09.830 
the second time it doesn't hit the next
note<00:03:04.110> which<00:03:04.980> would<00:03:05.310> be<00:03:08.239> that's<00:03:09.239> only<00:03:09.540> for<00:03:09.780> the

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
note which would be that's only for the

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:15.220 
note which would be that's only for the
first<00:03:10.079> one<00:03:10.319> for<00:03:10.620> the<00:03:10.709> second<00:03:11.099> part<00:03:11.310> is<00:03:13.670> and

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
first one for the second part is and

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:17.600 
first one for the second part is and
then<00:03:16.230> the<00:03:16.470> next<00:03:16.709> one<00:03:16.829> just<00:03:17.069> continues<00:03:17.549> the

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
then the next one just continues the

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:32.270 
then the next one just continues the
same<00:03:27.769> now<00:03:29.690> if<00:03:30.690> you<00:03:31.500> want<00:03:31.709> to<00:03:31.769> try<00:03:31.920> to<00:03:31.980> put<00:03:32.190> it

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
same now if you want to try to put it

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.090 
same now if you want to try to put it
together<00:03:32.400> and<00:03:32.930> if<00:03:33.930> it's<00:03:34.139> easy<00:03:34.410> for<00:03:34.709> you<00:03:34.859> then

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
together and if it's easy for you then

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:36.680 
together and if it's easy for you then
there<00:03:35.609> you<00:03:35.730> go

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
there you go

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.610 
there you go
for<00:03:37.530> the<00:03:37.739> first<00:03:38.100> hand<00:03:38.720> I'll<00:03:39.720> be<00:03:40.079> posting<00:03:40.319> a

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620
