 water when lifting more weight or I will do 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:03.040
 more muscle mass passing does not influence 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:06.430

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:28.700
 what are the wristbands this is how you 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:34.119
 they release the pressure of feeling that you 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:36.860
 doll is separated from the here of the arm 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:39.860
 then they are the riffs they squeeze you very 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:43.190
 well your wristbands tighten you and the 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:45.320

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:04.450
 claw and not have that famous pain in the 

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:07.179
 dolls but that's all with the guys 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:10.830
 response with gloves you can 

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:13.900
 buy those that are years that are tied 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:16.030
 The whole doll is good but from that to 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:19.090

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:21.519
 muscle or what 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.970
