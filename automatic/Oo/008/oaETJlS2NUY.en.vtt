00:00:06.519 --> 00:00:12.620
 hello together today I want to show 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:14.949
 How I sum up this flower 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:17.660
 belongs to christmas and means 

00:00:14.949 --> 00:00:20.600
 poinsettia all these balls 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:23.419
 I need to elicit the rent for that 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:27.199
 is the main watch I make such a 

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:30.579
 classic dark red crumb and 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:34.070
 of course green berlin for the leaves 

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:42.440
 at first pretty much all these pearls 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:46.340
 mess up the step now 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:49.370
 I distance and fasten one 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:54.880
 balls on the kick that means I take 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:58.520
 a fair and talk turned around 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:01:02.180
 until these balls alone on the burr 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:06.100
 stays and that's how I do it 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.100
 same with all these pearls 

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:30.110
 Now I have made such a part 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:33.040
 And all these pearls have different 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:41.560
 height and that's good then too 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:44.119
 really everything together and then 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:51.049
 I also connect the two wires 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:52.270
 This is the rent that looks completely together 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:55.610
 good 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:57.709
 Now I'm doing the red leaves myself 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:00.020
 decides themselves reach the leaves 

00:01:57.709 --> 00:02:04.789
 But last time I collect red berries 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:10.580
 stepped on the foot and then I look like it 

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:13.730
 This handlebar will look its best 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:19.160
 is good for the first layer and then 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:21.170
 I cut off the degree and now 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.470
 I connect these two devices 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.470
 together 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:37.300
 next I do the first row and the 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.300
 basis of the century 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:51.620
 the leaves are playing up like that 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.620
 pretty daring 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:15.350
 and the piece from above dashing off and on 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:20.250
 the rest really not behind 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:23.130
 now I actually was and it was 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:26.580
 fits because all I leafed made 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:29.520
 I have shown these are the 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:32.430
 same with only two rows are there 

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:36.170
 the same with almost three 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:39.120
 rows here the base is three 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:42.570
 centimeter and I have it in here 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:45.270
 then around the base and then I have 

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:46.370
 four she prays are a bit 

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:50.120
 different 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:54.450
 the basis here is with all these 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:58.340
 3.5 centimeters but here I have 4 1 um 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:04:01.620
 the ball backup and here already five 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:04.340
 how I made such a plate show 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.340
 me now
