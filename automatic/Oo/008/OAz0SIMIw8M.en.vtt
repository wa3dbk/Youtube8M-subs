using this piece of as a sidearm it has
a<00:01:01.739> pretty<00:01:02.039> good<00:01:02.190> rate<00:01:02.370> of<00:01:02.399> fire<00:01:02.520> stability<00:01:03.390> and

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
a pretty good rate of fire stability and

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.780 
a pretty good rate of fire stability and
reload<00:01:04.110> at<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.680> cost<00:01:04.890> of<00:01:05.159> pretty<00:01:05.640> much

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
reload at the cost of pretty much

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.670 
reload at the cost of pretty much
tickling<00:01:06.330> enemies<00:01:06.659> with<00:01:06.990> tickle<00:01:07.380> bolts
