okay<00:00:04.410> so<00:00:04.470> now<00:00:04.859> we're<00:00:05.069> looking<00:00:05.310> at<00:00:05.460> a<00:00:05.640> supra

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330 
okay so now we're looking at a supra

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.030 
okay so now we're looking at a supra
yeah<00:00:06.600> so<00:00:06.839> we<00:00:06.930> move<00:00:07.109> from<00:00:07.230> our<00:00:07.410> moombah<00:00:07.710> lineup

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
yeah so we move from our moombah lineup

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.560 
yeah so we move from our moombah lineup
which<00:00:08.189> is<00:00:08.309> our<00:00:08.460> more<00:00:08.610> value<00:00:08.910> oriented<00:00:09.120> lineup

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
which is our more value oriented lineup

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.049 
which is our more value oriented lineup
the<00:00:10.500> best<00:00:10.710> equation<00:00:11.160> would<00:00:11.250> be<00:00:11.400> to<00:00:11.580> compare<00:00:12.030> a

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
the best equation would be to compare a

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:13.910 
the best equation would be to compare a
moon<00:00:12.360> but<00:00:12.509> with<00:00:12.630> a<00:00:12.660> Toyota<00:00:13.019> and<00:00:13.290> a<00:00:13.500> super<00:00:13.799> with

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
moon but with a Toyota and a super with

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.189 
moon but with a Toyota and a super with
Alexis<00:00:14.309> or<00:00:14.820> a<00:00:14.880> moombah<00:00:15.240> within<00:00:15.480> this<00:00:15.599> an<00:00:15.839> or<00:00:16.139> a

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
Alexis or a moombah within this an or a

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.439 
Alexis or a moombah within this an or a
super<00:00:16.650> with<00:00:16.770> or<00:00:16.890> not<00:00:17.010> without<00:00:17.279> infinity<00:00:17.880> okay

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
super with or not without infinity okay

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.060 
super with or not without infinity okay
so<00:00:18.690> they're<00:00:18.840> made<00:00:19.020> with<00:00:19.199> the<00:00:19.289> same<00:00:19.320> strict

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
so they're made with the same strict

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.400 
so they're made with the same strict
manufacturing<00:00:20.760> guidelines<00:00:21.150> both<00:00:21.990> boats<00:00:22.260> are

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
manufacturing guidelines both boats are

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:23.870 
manufacturing guidelines both boats are
actually<00:00:22.680> manufacturing<00:00:23.189> the<00:00:23.340> same<00:00:23.490> facility

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
actually manufacturing the same facility

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.240 
actually manufacturing the same facility
and<00:00:24.060> the<00:00:24.930> whole<00:00:25.109> layup<00:00:25.439> and<00:00:25.560> construction<00:00:26.099> of

and the whole layup and construction of

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.710 
and the whole layup and construction of
the<00:00:26.340> boat<00:00:26.490> is<00:00:26.670> identical<00:00:27.180> until<00:00:27.420> we<00:00:27.480> start

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
the boat is identical until we start

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.179 
the boat is identical until we start
rigging<00:00:27.960> so<00:00:28.619> when<00:00:28.740> you<00:00:28.830> looked<00:00:28.980> at<00:00:29.039> those

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
rigging so when you looked at those

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:30.529 
rigging so when you looked at those
moombas<00:00:29.550> or<00:00:29.699> beautiful<00:00:30.029> boats<00:00:30.210> we<00:00:30.390> don't

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
moombas or beautiful boats we don't

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.269 
moombas or beautiful boats we don't
sacrifice<00:00:30.720> anything<00:00:31.289> in<00:00:31.529> them<00:00:31.679> but<00:00:32.099> when<00:00:32.250> you

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
sacrifice anything in them but when you

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:33.770 
sacrifice anything in them but when you
get<00:00:32.399> into<00:00:32.460> a<00:00:32.669> supra<00:00:33.120> you'll<00:00:33.270> see<00:00:33.420> that<00:00:33.510> we<00:00:33.630> put

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
get into a supra you'll see that we put

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.780 
get into a supra you'll see that we put
the<00:00:33.870> extra<00:00:34.170> finishing<00:00:34.590> touches<00:00:34.770> use<00:00:35.489> finer

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
the extra finishing touches use finer

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.060 
the extra finishing touches use finer
materials<00:00:36.329> higher<00:00:37.020> grade<00:00:37.380> materials<00:00:37.860> the

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
materials higher grade materials the

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.979

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
the another boat in a moment that's

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.540 
the another boat in a moment that's
operational<00:00:55.530> but<00:00:55.770> what<00:00:55.890> it<00:00:55.980> does<00:00:56.129> essentially

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
operational but what it does essentially

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.459 
operational but what it does essentially
it<00:00:56.760> controls<00:00:57.390> all<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:57.660> operations<00:00:58.170> of<00:00:58.379> the

it controls all the operations of the
vote<00:00:58.590> from<00:00:58.739> one<00:00:58.920> center<00:00:59.190> so<00:00:59.789> can<00:01:00.030> control

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
vote from one center so can control

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.799 
vote from one center so can control

00:06:05.179 --> 00:06:05.189 
people yeah so the 410 horsepower are

00:06:05.189 --> 00:06:06.110 
people yeah so the 410 horsepower are
certainly<00:06:05.400> going<00:06:05.490> to<00:06:05.580> give<00:06:05.729> you<00:06:05.789> the<00:06:05.849> grunt

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:06.120 
certainly going to give you the grunt

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:07.309 
certainly going to give you the grunt
out<00:06:06.270> of<00:06:06.360> the<00:06:06.419> hole<00:06:06.539> and<00:06:06.750> then<00:06:06.840> provide<00:06:07.110> some

00:06:07.309 --> 00:06:07.319 
out of the hole and then provide some

00:06:07.319 --> 00:06:08.619 
out of the hole and then provide some
more<00:06:07.440> efficiency<00:06:07.860> when<00:06:07.949> it's<00:06:08.069> being<00:06:08.190> operated

00:06:08.619 --> 00:06:08.629 
more efficiency when it's being operated

00:06:08.629 --> 00:06:10.820 
more efficiency when it's being operated
so<00:06:09.629> that's<00:06:09.779> the<00:06:09.930> motor<00:06:10.110> that<00:06:10.199> provides<00:06:10.650> the

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:10.830 
so that's the motor that provides the

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:12.140 
so that's the motor that provides the
power<00:06:10.979> and<00:06:11.159> then<00:06:11.279> each<00:06:11.610> side<00:06:11.849> of<00:06:11.879> it<00:06:12.060> you'll

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:12.150 
power and then each side of it you'll

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:15.050 
power and then each side of it you'll
see<00:06:12.270> how<00:06:12.389> these<00:06:12.419> large<00:06:12.900> storage<00:06:13.889> areas<00:06:14.370> are<00:06:14.550> or

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:15.060 
see how these large storage areas are or

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:17.119 
see how these large storage areas are or
inside<00:06:15.629> right<00:06:16.379> now<00:06:16.409> at<00:06:16.590> the<00:06:16.710> show<00:06:16.860> we've<00:06:17.009> got

00:06:17.119 --> 00:06:17.129 
inside right now at the show we've got

00:06:17.129 --> 00:06:18.769 
inside right now at the show we've got
just<00:06:17.219> ballast<00:06:17.610> bag<00:06:17.789> on<00:06:18.000> in<00:06:18.180> there<00:06:18.360> for<00:06:18.509> display

00:06:18.769 --> 00:06:18.779 
just ballast bag on in there for display

00:06:18.779 --> 00:06:20.209 
just ballast bag on in there for display
but<00:06:18.990> when<00:06:19.139> the<00:06:19.229> ballast<00:06:19.560> is<00:06:19.680> fuller<00:06:19.889> still

00:06:20.209 --> 00:06:20.219 
but when the ballast is fuller still

00:06:20.219 --> 00:06:21.829 
but when the ballast is fuller still
lots<00:06:20.400> of<00:06:20.520> room<00:06:20.639> for<00:06:20.669> extra<00:06:20.849> stuff<00:06:21.210> yeah<00:06:21.479> this

00:06:21.829 --> 00:06:21.839 
lots of room for extra stuff yeah this

00:06:21.839 --> 00:06:23.749 
lots of room for extra stuff yeah this
just<00:06:21.990> gives<00:06:22.110> you<00:06:22.259> a<00:06:22.289> walkway<00:06:22.469> so<00:06:22.710> one<00:06:22.949> more<00:06:23.129> no

00:06:23.749 --> 00:06:23.759 
just gives you a walkway so one more no

00:06:23.759 --> 00:06:25.670 
just gives you a walkway so one more no
wait<00:06:24.060> boarding<00:06:24.389> all<00:06:24.479> day<00:06:24.659> and<00:06:25.379> you're<00:06:25.529> going

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:25.680 
wait boarding all day and you're going

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:26.940 
back and forth for the platform if you

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:28.279 
back and forth for the platform if you
don't<00:06:27.089> want<00:06:27.210> to<00:06:27.300> get<00:06:27.449> this<00:06:27.839> too<00:06:28.050> wet<00:06:28.259> or

00:06:28.279 --> 00:06:28.289 
don't want to get this too wet or

00:06:28.289 --> 00:06:30.079 
don't want to get this too wet or
slippery<00:06:28.650> you<00:06:29.129> can<00:06:29.279> open<00:06:29.520> that<00:06:29.669> hatch<00:06:29.849> and

00:06:30.079 --> 00:06:30.089 
slippery you can open that hatch and

00:06:30.089 --> 00:06:31.730 
slippery you can open that hatch and
walk<00:06:30.180> on<00:06:30.360> the<00:06:30.539> nose<00:06:30.870> get<00:06:31.080> surface<00:06:31.409> to<00:06:31.500> make<00:06:31.650> it

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:31.740 
walk on the nose get surface to make it

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:33.260 
walk on the nose get surface to make it
safer<00:06:32.039> how<00:06:32.250> long's<00:06:32.460> we<00:06:32.610> pick<00:06:32.789> your<00:06:32.940> load<00:06:33.089> up

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:33.270 
safer how long's we pick your load up

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:34.640 
safer how long's we pick your load up
the<00:06:33.419> ballast<00:06:33.779> the<00:06:33.990> ballast<00:06:34.229> takes<00:06:34.409> probably

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:34.650 
the ballast the ballast takes probably

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:36.999 
the ballast the ballast takes probably
about<00:06:35.339> seven<00:06:35.669> or<00:06:35.699> eight<00:06:35.819> minutes<00:06:35.940> to<00:06:36.210> finish

00:06:36.999 --> 00:06:37.009 
about seven or eight minutes to finish

00:06:37.009 --> 00:06:39.649 
about seven or eight minutes to finish
yeah<00:06:38.009> it's<00:06:38.250> like<00:06:38.520> I<00:06:38.639> said<00:06:38.819> it's<00:06:38.969> 1,900<00:06:39.539> pounds

00:06:39.649 --> 00:06:39.659 
yeah it's like I said it's 1,900 pounds

00:06:39.659 --> 00:06:40.909 
yeah it's like I said it's 1,900 pounds
there's<00:06:40.050> an<00:06:40.110> awful<00:06:40.289> lot<00:06:40.319> of<00:06:40.500> water<00:06:40.620> that<00:06:40.800> we

00:06:40.909 --> 00:06:40.919 
there's an awful lot of water that we

00:06:40.919 --> 00:06:42.469 
there's an awful lot of water that we
need<00:06:41.069> to<00:06:41.219> get<00:06:41.400> sucked<00:06:41.639> into<00:06:41.819> this<00:06:42.000> boat<00:06:42.210> yeah

00:06:42.469 --> 00:06:42.479 
need to get sucked into this boat yeah

00:06:42.479 --> 00:06:44.690 
need to get sucked into this boat yeah
to<00:06:43.020> get<00:06:43.139> it<00:06:43.229> weighted<00:06:43.469> down<00:06:43.589> and<00:06:44.039> I

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:44.700 
to get it weighted down and I

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:46.640 
to get it weighted down and I
yeah<00:06:45.270> accident<00:06:45.720> actually<00:06:45.840> exits<00:06:46.260> through<00:06:46.440> the

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:46.650 
yeah accident actually exits through the

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:48.620 
yeah accident actually exits through the
through<00:06:47.100> the<00:06:47.250> intake<00:06:47.580> so<00:06:48.060> there's<00:06:48.240> neat<00:06:48.480> new

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:48.630 
through the intake so there's neat new

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:50.000 
through the intake so there's neat new
pump<00:06:48.870> systems<00:06:49.200> in<00:06:49.290> this<00:06:49.410> boat<00:06:49.560> now<00:06:49.710> instead<00:06:49.950> of

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:50.010 
pump systems in this boat now instead of

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:51.140 
pump systems in this boat now instead of
having<00:06:50.100> water<00:06:50.430> shooting<00:06:50.670> into<00:06:50.820> the<00:06:50.910> sides

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:51.150 
having water shooting into the sides

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:52.730 
having water shooting into the sides
when<00:06:51.390> you're<00:06:51.510> draining<00:06:51.750> the<00:06:52.290> water<00:06:52.320> actually

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:52.740 
when you're draining the water actually

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:54.050 
when you're draining the water actually
exits<00:06:53.220> through<00:06:53.310> the<00:06:53.430> bottom<00:06:53.670> of<00:06:53.790> the<00:06:53.850> boat<00:06:53.970> in

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:54.060 
exits through the bottom of the boat in

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:55.610 
exits through the bottom of the boat in
this<00:06:54.180> boat<00:06:54.360> so<00:06:54.810> the<00:06:54.930> pumps<00:06:55.200> actually<00:06:55.440> reverse

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:55.620 
this boat so the pumps actually reverse

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:56.990 
this boat so the pumps actually reverse
themselves<00:06:55.830> and<00:06:56.190> suck<00:06:56.310> the<00:06:56.400> water<00:06:56.550> back<00:06:56.760> out

00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:57.000 
themselves and suck the water back out

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.820 
themselves and suck the water back out
of<00:06:57.030> the<00:06:57.210> bags<00:06:57.420> out<00:06:57.690> back<00:06:58.230> in<00:06:58.410> the<00:06:58.500> lake<00:06:58.650> below

00:06:58.820 --> 00:06:58.830 
of the bags out back in the lake below

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:02.330 
of the bags out back in the lake below
below<00:06:59.550> the<00:07:00.060> surface<00:07:00.210> yeah<00:07:00.540> yeah<00:07:00.960> very<00:07:01.340> nice
