Chinese<00:03:45.160> restaurants<00:03:45.700> when<00:03:45.850> they<00:03:45.970> have<00:03:46.150> fried

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
Chinese restaurants when they have fried

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:49.080 
Chinese restaurants when they have fried
rice<00:03:46.690> they<00:03:47.170> actually<00:03:47.560> use<00:03:47.800> the<00:03:48.250> leftover<00:03:48.910> rice

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.090 
rice they actually use the leftover rice

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:51.150 
rice they actually use the leftover rice
from<00:03:49.330> the<00:03:49.390> previous<00:03:49.870> name<00:03:50.140> the<00:03:50.650> plain<00:03:50.920> white

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.160 
from the previous name the plain white

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:52.830 
from the previous name the plain white
rice<00:03:51.430> that<00:03:51.700> happens<00:03:51.970> to<00:03:52.060> be<00:03:52.090> leftover<00:03:52.600> in<00:03:52.720> the

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
rice that happens to be leftover in the

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.630 
rice that happens to be leftover in the
restaurant<00:03:53.230> they<00:03:53.650> use<00:03:53.860> that<00:03:54.160> to<00:03:54.430> make<00:03:54.610> the

fried<00:03:55.000> rice<00:03:55.240> for<00:03:55.510> the<00:03:55.690> following<00:03:56.020> day<00:03:56.320> because

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:56.950 
fried rice for the following day because

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:58.650 
fried rice for the following day because
it<00:03:57.070> always<00:03:57.250> works<00:03:57.550> best<00:03:57.880> when<00:03:58.150> the<00:03:58.270> rice<00:03:58.450> is

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:58.660 
it always works best when the rice is

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:01.500 
it always works best when the rice is
cold<00:03:59.020> and<00:03:59.320> like<00:04:00.070> a<00:04:00.100> day<00:04:00.280> old<00:04:00.310> even<00:04:00.820> even<00:04:01.480> better
