00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:13.359
 hello my name is Julian and geography and 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:16.990
 now I'm going to make a portrait of the captain 

00:00:13.359 --> 00:00:19.449
 piluso the piluso captain was a hero 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:22.060
 child with character created by 

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:25.360
 Alberto Olmedo to start the 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:29.230
 What I do is work on wood 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:31.529
 black the contours of the figure when 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:35.320
 finish doing this what I do is 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:37.930
 slowly and go putting a thin layer and 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:41.620
 white couple always guiding us by 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:44.850
 the line of the drawing and always obviously 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:47.940
 with the photo next 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.780
 well not always so as not to make mistakes 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.579
 [Music] 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.430
 the paint we are using is paint 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:56.800
 the water is acrylic paint with air the 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:01:00.129
 air comes around here the paint comes together 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:02.170
 with the air here in this area squeezing 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:04.239
 the trigger down is only 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.640
 stretching air the further back you throw the 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:08.820
 Airbrush trigger plus paint is 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.820
 lengthening 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:19.939
 The more we pass the target than 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:22.429
 let's create a gray plus more big tube 

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:25.369
 higher this has gifts this way 

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:28.750
 we are raising the form we are creating 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:28.750
 the volume 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:37.680
 Now what are we going to do with the black 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:41.130
 is to mark the strong shadows and in 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:45.470
 dark and create gray to 2 and fix the 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.470
 mistakes that we send with the target 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.739
 [Music] 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:54.399
 until here what we did was mark the 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:56.469
 direction of light shadow what 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:59.409
 would be missing would end details 

00:01:56.469 --> 00:02:01.899
 punctual in the hat the face and 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:03.880
 finish the fund a bit if you want to see 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:06.000
 the finished work can be seen in 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.000
 Internet 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:11.449
 [Music] 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:17.810
