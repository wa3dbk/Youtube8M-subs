00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.670
 today I will raise an interesting 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:08.269
 question as well you know the studies 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:12.090
 of the human genome genetic engineering 

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:14.780
 they evolve more quickly and 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:18.810
 it is already possible to know how a person is 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:21.720
 physically it is already possible to know the color 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:24.449
 of his eyes the size of his nose the 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.599
 size of your teeth if you are going to have or not 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:30.750
 the wisdom tooth is possible to know 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:33.220
 absolutely everything just looking and 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.950
 encoding the DNA 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:39.400
 in fact there is an artist specifically 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:41.650
 who wanted to demonstrate this theory by going down 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:45.220
 be one of the busiest meters 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:47.920
 metro of the angels to catch some 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:51.730
 hairs that were in the seats 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:55.480
 hairs of normal people this artist never 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:58.660
 I had seen those people nonetheless 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:03.079
 through the data your DNA was 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:07.460
 able to recreate with exact precision 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:09.740
 the facial face of those people 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:13.159
 as you can see in none of us 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:16.010
 is safe let's leave traces 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:18.560
 genetic every time we sneeze every 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:20.659
 Once we put our hand somewhere 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.100
 we have earned the snot or any 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:24.320
 thing 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:27.770
 When we drop a hair we leave 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:31.490
 genetic traces every day at all 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:34.909
 hours and that is why this artist has 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:37.430
 created a new system to prevent that 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:41.630
 this happens in fact it is a 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:44.539
 substance that eliminates 95% of the trace 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:47.450
 genetic for example imagine that a 

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:49.580
 person has coughed on a surface then 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:53.740
 if you throw this this substance 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:56.509
 automatically 95% of the DNA will remain 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:02:00.560
 unrecognizable will be overshadowed and the 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:03.289
 Another 5% will be fought with a 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.149
 second substance the truth is that it 

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:07.729
 it's about the perfect solution for 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:09.350
 those who do not want to leave a mark on 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:12.230
 your crimes 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:15.470
 if people use this as always in 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:17.540
 negative plan because we will be before a 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.060
 new era in which no criminal 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:24.260
 no criminal who is intelligent 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:28.070
 can be tracked and caught we have 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:29.660
 here images of the faces that 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:33.370
 I represent this artist 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:35.590
 the artist header the way hat board 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.880
 As you can see they are sculptures in three 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.920
 dimensions 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.350
 he did two years ago in fact this 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:46.490
 news has been two years ago 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:49.460
 that what is more modern is the 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:52.790
 bottles the bottles with substances that 

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:54.680
 allow to delete the DNA and in second 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.770
 place a process known as 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:00.680
 replace that masks 0.5 by 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:02.810
 remaining one hundred with a mixture of DNA of 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:05.150
 50 different sources 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:09.380
 in short throwing these two substances 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:11.450
 in this pair of bottles two perfumes of 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:14.660
 spray that she invented that is 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:16.700
 artist invented then automatically it 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:20.900
 would undo any evidence that that 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:22.630
 person was there and that that DNA is 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.700
 yours 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:26.740
 quite risky there are not some 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.840
 inventions that like the human being then 

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:32.290
 it seems that he has the evil inside his 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:34.810
 head for surely use them in 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:37.300
 against what of the purpose with the 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:39.190
 that had to be used in this case 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:42.220
 I am convinced that many murderers 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:44.170
 many rapists there are many people to the 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:47.530
 which is interested in destroying your evidence 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:49.800
 Genetics will start using these 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:49.800
 aerosol sprays
