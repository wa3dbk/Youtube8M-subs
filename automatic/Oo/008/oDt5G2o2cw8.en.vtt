00:00:00.859 --> 00:00:05.090
 hi guys in this tutorial i will explain how to turn on the tools 

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:06.880
 of the Madonna 

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:09.880
 our md80 

00:00:10.569 --> 00:00:11.819
 first of all 

00:00:11.819 --> 00:00:17.199
 we have to enter the start menu enter into the menager cassette 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:19.220
 because once 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:21.800
 we are waiting for the little program to open 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.649
 in this brief - we will go ahahah love substantially 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.090
 to plan our passenger load 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:32.620
 and luggage 

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:35.800
 The fuel load is obviously very important 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.440
 also redeeming the passenger and luggage I would not let him see why 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.560
 I will explain born all the moment 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.560
 he did not know us leave what you have of the deceased that I think is fine 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.950
 click on the route planner 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:52.520
 at this point 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.520
 who call you I'm flight plan let's say saying 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:59.900
 practically the departure airport 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.080
 let's start from milan live malpensa 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.230
 villa indiamike charlie 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:08.150
 airport of destination 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.700
 we decide to go and create 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.460
 to Barcelona 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.700
 therefore deco climate 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.670
 good boy 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.990
 this year the icao code in barcelona 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.510
 alternate airport operating alternate report we can put 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.130
 example 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.979
 turin 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.360
 let's take an example 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.360
 india maik fox trot nurseries 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.320
 did this 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.740
 if you look at how blue block fluent is written 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.410
 we have our fuel load 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:44.430
 and marks us 10000 229 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:48.470
 this is our full fuel load 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.730
 clicking sotras why now 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:54.730
 we can note that therefore a little flower box 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.330
 the pounds elected air island fuel in kilograms 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.420
 we have in the left tank 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.570
 4 2 2 7 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:10.170
 in the sign is of the text excused 4 2007 in the central one 1 7 7 5 

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:13.999
 I recommend writing it on a piece of paper or 

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:19.089
 many say they rent the house directly inside the simulator 

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:20.189
 automatically 

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:23.439
 to me this does not happen but you do 

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:25.269
 to avoid 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:28.539
 shoreline concern us these colors 

00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:31.019
 I say they sign up on a sheet 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:34.019
 check the box start fs 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:37.019
 and click ok 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:39.609
 depre to your window 

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:42.609
 he should have been written with dark tekken 

00:02:43.149 --> 00:02:49.179
 what it will mean that your helium will load pushed without photo espen 

00:02:49.179 --> 00:02:51.159
 teeeeeee all pushed instruments 

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:54.619
 and now I will mark you as I will explain excuse me 

00:02:54.619 --> 00:02:57.619
 like ash this fantastic e 

00:02:58.399 --> 00:03:00.539
 are click on ok 

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:03.929
 and meanwhile it is loading the same engine 

00:03:03.929 --> 00:03:06.169
 meanwhile charging simulator 

00:03:06.169 --> 00:03:10.199
 we need maps because if you can't fly without maps 

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:13.839
 in the meantime I have already downloaded them but you still want an example if you don't have it 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:17.459
 tried to download it from the website of ivao italia 

00:03:18.029 --> 00:03:20.649
 which you see here in overlay 

00:03:20.649 --> 00:03:22.629
 the 

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:25.150
 the map of Milan malpensa 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:26.939
 I've already downloaded it 

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:29.439
 ojala 

00:03:29.439 --> 00:03:32.799
 the various you are leaving the airport 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:35.239
 which I will then explain to you 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:39.469
 how to introduce inside the computer of the ship or plane 

00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:41.409
 of the gdo 

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:46.089
 me on this one. d milano malpensa is also taken those of barcelona rain 

00:03:46.869 --> 00:03:50.349
 I have already decided suppose to arrive 

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:53.089
 obviously simulated online 

00:03:53.089 --> 00:03:58.109
 he will be a tiziana avitabile see you some stars 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:02.239
 if you are a beginner and you don't know what the 6 stars are but I will 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:03.619
 board of 

00:04:03.619 --> 00:04:07.479
 to download some excellent guides that you find on the internet just by typing 

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:09.449
 on google 

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:14.599
 sibestar however what concerns tail regarding the henkel bologna lands 

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:18.849
 you will surely find everything then 

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:20.469
 if you have any 

00:04:20.469 --> 00:04:21.689
 and question to make 

00:04:21.689 --> 00:04:23.930
 I will try to explain it 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:27.950
 I have it too, I am not very experienced 

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:30.159
 this adventure in the world of the frog 

00:04:30.159 --> 00:04:33.159
 of the Turin virtual flight are a little bit 

00:04:33.939 --> 00:04:35.349
 I arrange it I know 

00:04:35.349 --> 00:04:38.349
 because I also did this tutorial because moon 

00:04:39.059 --> 00:04:42.430
 in Italian there are very few, indeed almost zero 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:45.009
 then 

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:49.629
 I hope to be useful enough to at least start a little bit 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:52.529
 the simulator 

00:04:52.529 --> 00:04:54.199
 let's see if 

00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:56.610
 it is necessary for can do better alone 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:58.620
 when it is ready 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:00.629
 I will go on with explanation 

00:05:00.629 --> 00:05:01.900
 in the moment I interrupt which
