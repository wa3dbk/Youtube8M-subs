to put into a rack bag now the third
benefit<00:01:12.689> is<00:01:12.869> that<00:01:13.650> it's<00:01:13.979> really<00:01:14.340> easy<00:01:14.460> to

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
benefit is that it's really easy to

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.820 
benefit is that it's really easy to
expand<00:01:15.180> off<00:01:15.330> of<00:01:15.479> if<00:01:15.689> you've<00:01:15.780> got<00:01:15.960> even<00:01:16.350> larger

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
setup you can use this as a base and

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.710 
setup you can use this as a base and
build<00:01:19.950> upon<00:01:20.100> it<00:01:20.400> you<00:01:20.580> know<00:01:20.939> you<00:01:21.210> can<00:01:21.360> add<00:01:21.450> side

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
right and left sides or if you want to

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.050 
right and left sides or if you want to
build<00:01:27.930> up<00:01:28.220> the<00:01:29.220> verticals<00:01:29.670> are<00:01:29.820> long<00:01:29.939> enough

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
build up the verticals are long enough

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
that you could add extenders and create

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.969 
that you could add extenders and create
another<00:01:32.250> tier<00:01:32.670> right<00:01:32.880> above<00:01:33.150> you<00:01:33.420> mmm<00:01:34.439> that's

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
another tier right above you mmm that's

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.850 
another tier right above you mmm that's
cool<00:01:35.220> idea<00:01:35.460> isn't<00:01:35.610> it<00:01:35.869> plus<00:01:36.869> if<00:01:37.170> you<00:01:37.619> want<00:01:37.740> to

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.590 
cool idea isn't it plus if you want to
add<00:01:37.950> symbols<00:01:38.460> to<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.640> verticals<00:01:39.119> and<00:01:39.299> remove

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
add symbols to the verticals and remove

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.020 
add symbols to the verticals and remove
some<00:01:39.810> multi<00:01:40.079> clamps<00:01:40.439> you<00:01:41.159> can<00:01:41.340> easily<00:01:41.579> add<00:01:41.880> the

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
some multi clamps you can easily add the

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.700 
some multi clamps you can easily add the
RBA<00:01:42.329> right<00:01:42.780> to<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:43.049> top<00:01:43.229> of<00:01:43.259> each<00:01:43.500> of<00:01:43.649> the
