00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.609 
you know that plants probably going to
shut<00:01:12.240> down<00:01:12.270> if<00:01:12.600> it<00:01:12.719> gets<00:01:12.840> below<00:01:12.960> freezing<00:01:13.289> but

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
because once we get below 50 degrees

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.380 
because once we get below 50 degrees
that<00:01:34.200> plants<00:01:34.590> metabolism<00:01:35.280> just<00:01:35.429> slows<00:01:35.789> down<00:01:36.119> a

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
that plants metabolism just slows down a

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.599 
that plants metabolism just slows down a
lot<00:01:36.719> so<00:01:37.350> that<00:01:37.710> roundup<00:01:38.100> is<00:01:38.219> going<00:01:38.399> to<00:01:38.460> take<00:01:38.579> a

00:01:38.599 --> 00:01:38.609 
lot so that roundup is going to take a

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:40.669 
lot so that roundup is going to take a
long<00:01:38.969> time<00:01:39.479> to<00:01:39.840> work<00:01:40.020> through<00:01:40.259> that<00:01:40.409> system

00:01:40.669 --> 00:01:40.679 
long time to work through that system

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:42.349 
long time to work through that system
and<00:01:41.219> when<00:01:41.310> you<00:01:41.399> think<00:01:41.520> about<00:01:41.759> how<00:01:41.909> roundup

00:01:42.349 --> 00:01:42.359 
and when you think about how roundup

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:44.239 
and when you think about how roundup
works<00:01:42.570> especially<00:01:42.929> on<00:01:43.499> the<00:01:43.619> broadleaf<00:01:44.009> weeds

00:01:44.239 --> 00:01:44.249 
works especially on the broadleaf weeds

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:47.059 
works especially on the broadleaf weeds
it<00:01:44.819> has<00:01:45.060> to<00:01:45.210> go<00:01:45.359> to<00:01:45.420> each<00:01:45.780> growing<00:01:46.409> point<00:01:46.799> all

00:01:47.059 --> 00:01:47.069 
it has to go to each growing point all

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:48.709 
it has to go to each growing point all
the<00:01:47.189> way<00:01:47.219> down<00:01:47.490> that<00:01:47.700> plant<00:01:47.999> and<00:01:48.210> deliver<00:01:48.630> a

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:48.719 
the way down that plant and deliver a

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:51.020 
the way down that plant and deliver a
lethal<00:01:48.780> dose<00:01:49.229> if<00:01:49.799> it's<00:01:50.100> moving<00:01:50.549> that<00:01:50.700> roundup

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
lethal dose if it's moving that roundup

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.359 
lethal dose if it's moving that roundup
super<00:01:51.659> slow<00:01:51.929> through<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.289> plant<00:01:52.530> it<00:01:52.770> has<00:01:53.130> that

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
super slow through the plant it has that

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.580 
super slow through the plant it has that
much<00:01:53.670> more<00:01:54.090> time<00:01:54.479> to<00:01:54.780> break<00:01:54.990> that<00:01:55.200> product

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
much more time to break that product

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.260 
much more time to break that product
down<00:01:55.740> yeah<00:01:56.009> but<00:01:56.159> it's<00:01:56.280> before<00:01:56.460> that<00:01:56.670> even<00:01:57.060> it's

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
down yeah but it's before that even it's

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.120 
down yeah but it's before that even it's
when<00:01:57.450> you're<00:01:57.600> spraying<00:01:57.929> when<00:01:58.259> you<00:01:58.409> spray<00:01:58.829> is

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
when you're spraying when you spray is

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.520 
when you're spraying when you spray is
the<00:01:59.520> leaf<00:01:59.700> really<00:02:00.030> gonna<00:02:00.329> absorb<00:02:00.929> as<00:02:01.139> much

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
the leaf really gonna absorb as much

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.770 
the leaf really gonna absorb as much
liquid<00:02:02.219> when<00:02:02.549> it's<00:02:02.700> cold<00:02:03.030> as<00:02:03.359> compared<00:02:03.719> to

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
liquid when it's cold as compared to

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.050 
liquid when it's cold as compared to
when<00:02:03.899> it's<00:02:04.020> hot<00:02:04.170> no<00:02:04.469> way<00:02:04.649> so<00:02:05.249> I<00:02:05.579> just<00:02:05.789> look<00:02:05.939> at

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
when it's hot no way so I just look at

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.819 
when it's hot no way so I just look at
this<00:02:06.179> thing<00:02:06.389> is<00:02:06.630> I<00:02:06.810> don't<00:02:07.020> get<00:02:07.259> as<00:02:07.380> much<00:02:07.499> into

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
this thing is I don't get as much into

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.559 
this thing is I don't get as much into
the<00:02:07.920> plant<00:02:08.160> I<00:02:08.369> don't<00:02:08.610> move<00:02:08.879> it<00:02:09.030> as<00:02:09.149> quickly<00:02:09.360> to

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
the plant I don't move it as quickly to

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:10.999 
the plant I don't move it as quickly to
the<00:02:09.659> growing<00:02:09.929> point<00:02:10.200> and<00:02:10.349> when<00:02:10.619> those<00:02:10.739> two

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
the growing point and when those two

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.979 
the growing point and when those two
things<00:02:11.039> don't<00:02:11.489> happen<00:02:11.670> then<00:02:12.030> I<00:02:12.120> know<00:02:12.180> I<00:02:12.690> have<00:02:12.959> a

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
things don't happen then I know I have a

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:14.210 
things don't happen then I know I have a
lot<00:02:13.290> less<00:02:13.739> prod

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
lot less prod

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.270 
lot less prod
at<00:02:14.700> that<00:02:15.300> growing<00:02:15.780> point<00:02:16.050> I<00:02:16.230> may<00:02:16.800> not<00:02:17.010> have<00:02:17.220> a

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
at that growing point I may not have a

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.980 
at that growing point I may not have a
lethal<00:02:17.670> dose<00:02:17.820> anymore<00:02:18.270> and<00:02:18.450> especially<00:02:18.750> if

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
lethal dose anymore and especially if

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:20.720 
lethal dose anymore and especially if
I've<00:02:19.110> got<00:02:19.260> broad<00:02:19.500> leaves<00:02:19.740> where<00:02:20.160> I<00:02:20.190> may<00:02:20.520> have

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
I've got broad leaves where I may have

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.580 
I've got broad leaves where I may have
20<00:02:21.120> or<00:02:21.150> 30<00:02:21.270> growing<00:02:21.780> points<00:02:22.050> like<00:02:22.140> on<00:02:22.260> a<00:02:22.290> little

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
20 or 30 growing points like on a little

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.200 
20 or 30 growing points like on a little
lambsquarters<00:02:23.190> plant<00:02:23.460> that<00:02:23.850> I'm<00:02:23.970> trying<00:02:24.180> to

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210 
lambsquarters plant that I'm trying to

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:25.640 
lambsquarters plant that I'm trying to
kill<00:02:24.420> early<00:02:24.720> in<00:02:24.810> the<00:02:24.870> spring<00:02:25.050> well<00:02:25.380> you're

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
kill early in the spring well you're

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.500 
kill early in the spring well you're
gonna<00:02:25.770> kill<00:02:26.070> all<00:02:26.220> the<00:02:26.400> top<00:02:26.610> growing<00:02:27.120> points

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
gonna kill all the top growing points

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.300 
gonna kill all the top growing points
but<00:02:27.870> you<00:02:27.930> won't<00:02:28.350> kill<00:02:28.620> those<00:02:28.800> lower<00:02:29.040> growing

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
but you won't kill those lower growing

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:30.980 
but you won't kill those lower growing
points<00:02:29.670> because<00:02:29.940> you<00:02:30.060> just<00:02:30.240> run<00:02:30.480> out<00:02:30.660> of<00:02:30.690> steam

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
points because you just run out of steam

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.200 
points because you just run out of steam
so<00:02:31.410> you've<00:02:31.530> got<00:02:31.800> to<00:02:32.040> up<00:02:32.160> that<00:02:32.190> rate<00:02:32.730> or<00:02:32.970> of

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:33.210 
so you've got to up that rate or of

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:35.210 
so you've got to up that rate or of
course<00:02:33.450> the<00:02:33.690> other<00:02:33.810> choice<00:02:34.080> is<00:02:34.320> just<00:02:34.500> wait

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
course the other choice is just wait

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:36.650 
course the other choice is just wait
until<00:02:35.460> the<00:02:35.550> weather<00:02:35.670> warms<00:02:36.090> up<00:02:36.270> even<00:02:36.570> though

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
until the weather warms up even though

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.000 
until the weather warms up even though
we<00:02:36.810> don't<00:02:36.960> farm<00:02:37.230> a<00:02:37.320> tremendous<00:02:37.740> amount<00:02:37.920> of

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
we don't farm a tremendous amount of

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.100 
we don't farm a tremendous amount of
acres<00:02:38.310> we<00:02:38.460> farm<00:02:38.670> about<00:02:38.790> 2,700<00:02:39.600> crop<00:02:39.780> acres

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
acres we farm about 2,700 crop acres

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.050 
acres we farm about 2,700 crop acres
we've<00:02:40.470> got<00:02:40.620> two<00:02:40.800> sprayers<00:02:41.190> on<00:02:41.370> the<00:02:41.460> farm<00:02:41.670> so<00:02:42.030> I

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
we've got two sprayers on the farm so I

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.970 
we've got two sprayers on the farm so I
can<00:02:42.270> wait<00:02:42.660> until<00:02:42.960> just<00:02:43.140> the<00:02:43.320> right<00:02:43.350> time<00:02:43.710> I've

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
can wait until just the right time I've

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.340 
can wait until just the right time I've
got<00:02:44.130> two<00:02:44.400> operators<00:02:44.910> two<00:02:45.270> sprayers<00:02:45.660> and<00:02:46.020> we

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
got two operators two sprayers and we

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:48.590 
got two operators two sprayers and we
can<00:02:46.530> roll<00:02:46.770> and<00:02:47.100> I<00:02:47.610> can<00:02:47.790> get<00:02:47.940> everything<00:02:48.240> done<00:02:48.540> I

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
can roll and I can get everything done I

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.390 
can roll and I can get everything done I
could<00:02:48.840> spray<00:02:48.990> the<00:02:49.170> entire<00:02:49.470> farm<00:02:49.770> in<00:02:50.070> two<00:02:50.220> days

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
could spray the entire farm in two days

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.160 
could spray the entire farm in two days
well<00:02:50.940> you<00:02:51.090> know<00:02:51.180> what<00:02:51.300> that's<00:02:51.480> nice<00:02:51.720> brand<00:02:52.050> to

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
well you know what that's nice brand to

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.250 
well you know what that's nice brand to

one-man show I don't care if I own two
sprayers<00:02:58.890> I'm<00:02:59.580> the<00:02:59.730> one<00:02:59.850> that's<00:03:00.030> got<00:03:00.180> to<00:03:00.300> run

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
sprayers I'm the one that's got to run

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:01.910 
sprayers I'm the one that's got to run
them<00:03:00.570> and<00:03:00.810> I<00:03:01.050> can't<00:03:01.260> run<00:03:01.410> both<00:03:01.590> of<00:03:01.680> them<00:03:01.800> at<00:03:01.860> the

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
them and I can't run both of them at the

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.070 
them and I can't run both of them at the
same<00:03:02.010> time<00:03:02.160> so<00:03:02.460> what<00:03:02.850> I<00:03:02.880> need<00:03:03.000> to<00:03:03.120> do<00:03:03.330> I<00:03:03.540> need<00:03:03.750> to

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
same time so what I need to do I need to

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.440 
same time so what I need to do I need to
add<00:03:04.290> something<00:03:04.860> to<00:03:05.040> that<00:03:05.190> mix<00:03:05.640> to<00:03:06.120> make<00:03:06.150> this

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
add something to that mix to make this

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.240 
add something to that mix to make this
work<00:03:06.660> maybe<00:03:06.900> I<00:03:07.050> need<00:03:07.230> a<00:03:07.260> tank<00:03:07.590> mix<00:03:07.830> partner

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
work maybe I need a tank mix partner

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.010 
work maybe I need a tank mix partner
maybe<00:03:08.610> I<00:03:08.790> need<00:03:09.090> a<00:03:09.120> different<00:03:09.360> spray<00:03:09.810> a<00:03:09.840> diff

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:10.020 
maybe I need a different spray a diff

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.500 
maybe I need a different spray a diff
you<00:03:10.740> know<00:03:10.860> what<00:03:11.070> can<00:03:11.250> I<00:03:11.340> do<00:03:11.400> that<00:03:11.910> I<00:03:12.000> can<00:03:12.150> add<00:03:12.330> to

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
you know what can I do that I can add to

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.390 
you know what can I do that I can add to
the<00:03:12.600> tank<00:03:12.840> to<00:03:13.050> still<00:03:13.260> make<00:03:13.440> it<00:03:13.590> work<00:03:13.620> well<00:03:14.370> I

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
the tank to still make it work well I

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.160 
the tank to still make it work well I
just<00:03:14.640> look<00:03:14.970> at<00:03:15.120> it<00:03:15.150> as<00:03:15.360> you've<00:03:15.660> got<00:03:15.840> to<00:03:15.930> up<00:03:16.050> here

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
just look at it as you've got to up here

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.500 
just look at it as you've got to up here
to<00:03:16.320> glyphosate<00:03:16.770> right<00:03:17.130> okay<00:03:17.490> so<00:03:17.550> maybe<00:03:18.239> in

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
to glyphosate right okay so maybe in

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.300 
to glyphosate right okay so maybe in
some<00:03:18.750> cases<00:03:19.200> you<00:03:19.470> can<00:03:19.620> throw<00:03:19.800> something<00:03:20.070> else

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
some cases you can throw something else

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.070 
some cases you can throw something else
in<00:03:20.580> but<00:03:21.090> that<00:03:21.360> actually<00:03:21.750> could<00:03:21.900> be<00:03:21.959> a

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080 
in but that actually could be a

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.840 
in but that actually could be a
detriment<00:03:22.560> we<00:03:22.800> used<00:03:22.980> to<00:03:23.070> talk<00:03:23.250> to<00:03:23.400> farmers<00:03:23.550> all

the<00:03:23.970> time<00:03:24.180> years<00:03:24.450> ago<00:03:24.510> who<00:03:24.930> would<00:03:25.050> throw<00:03:25.290> in

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
the time years ago who would throw in

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.410 
the time years ago who would throw in

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.000 
240 with the roundup on the burndown I

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
he doing that for because the 240 is

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.510 
he doing that for because the 240 is
gonna<00:03:30.959> shut<00:03:31.200> the<00:03:31.350> plant<00:03:31.530> down<00:03:31.680> before<00:03:32.400> the

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
roundup and and I can just guess right

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.509 
roundup and and I can just guess right
now<00:03:57.840> the<00:03:58.350> rates<00:03:58.650> that<00:03:58.800> they're<00:03:59.040> gonna<00:03:59.130> put<00:03:59.400> in

00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 
now the rates that they're gonna put in

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:01.460 
now the rates that they're gonna put in
there<00:03:59.730> are<00:04:00.090> gonna<00:04:00.300> work<00:04:00.690> so<00:04:01.230> they're<00:04:01.380> gonna

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
there are gonna work so they're gonna

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.020 
there are gonna work so they're gonna
figure<00:04:01.739> out<00:04:01.860> what<00:04:02.130> the<00:04:02.280> rate<00:04:02.459> is<00:04:02.489> they<00:04:02.790> can't

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
figure out what the rate is they can't

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:04.699 
figure out what the rate is they can't

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
that depends a lot and if we're talking

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.040 
that depends a lot and if we're talking
annual<00:04:08.519> weeds<00:04:08.730> or<00:04:08.910> perennial<00:04:09.420> weeds<00:04:09.600> -<00:04:09.840> but

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:10.050 
annual weeds or perennial weeds - but

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:11.810 
annual weeds or perennial weeds - but
anyway<00:04:10.350> our<00:04:10.380> whole<00:04:10.800> point<00:04:11.070> here<00:04:11.400> is<00:04:11.459> just

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:11.820 
anyway our whole point here is just

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:13.790 
anyway our whole point here is just
think<00:04:12.390> about<00:04:12.480> how<00:04:12.810> herbicides<00:04:13.440> work<00:04:13.650> the

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:13.800 
think about how herbicides work the

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:15.199 
think about how herbicides work the
other<00:04:13.920> thing<00:04:14.130> is<00:04:14.250> you<00:04:14.400> have<00:04:14.459> to<00:04:14.670> do<00:04:14.790> everything

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209 
other thing is you have to do everything

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:17.030 
other thing is you have to do everything
right<00:04:15.390> so<00:04:15.690> that<00:04:16.169> means<00:04:16.440> when<00:04:16.650> you're<00:04:16.769> looking

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:17.040 
right so that means when you're looking

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.009 
right so that means when you're looking
at<00:04:17.130> the<00:04:17.250> label<00:04:17.580> and<00:04:17.669> it<00:04:17.760> says<00:04:17.790> put<00:04:18.359> on<00:04:18.390> 17

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:19.019 
at the label and it says put on 17
