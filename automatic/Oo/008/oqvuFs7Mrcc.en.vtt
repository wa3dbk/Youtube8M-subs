00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.120

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.240
 I was watching the story of a 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:18.300
 dog or you saw the puppy 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:22.350
 had some fish that were taken from the 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:26.640
 water was dying on the ground and 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:29.849

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.800
 fish floundering it is with muzzle and 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.110
 push the water 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:38.070
 playing in the fishes so that they 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:40.920
 could live an animal 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:44.760
 I want to save throwing water for others 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:49.620

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.940
 that's where nobody cared 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:01:02.449
 4 naked he was there stayed close to the 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.449
 field trying to pull it to save 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:09.869
 They say that when the person is very is 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.640
 pretty bad 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.580
 he is compared to an animal so-and-so 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:18.509
 animal but the animals will be that they are 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:21.030
 but the human being sees a person 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:23.390
 agonizing does not do anything the doggie was 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:27.600

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:30.150
 awesome is not is an eye on 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:35.369
 awesome how can a person 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:38.640
 have the holy spirit and not feel 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:42.750
 deep pain in your soul for those who 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:47.570
 are suffering without Jesus the pain of 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:51.570
 God's servants are the pain of God 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:55.799
 Jeremiah was the depth of the prophets who 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:59.060
 suffered because because he was the 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:03.890
 prophet chosen to take Israel 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:05.960
 will help Jerusalem to the worst of all 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:10.399
 News 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:14.420
 he would have to speak of captivity 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:16.280
 of Babylon he would have to announce that 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.860
 Jerusalem would be destroyed if the 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:21.530

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.930
 children would be killed than the old 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:27.200

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.939

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:32.269
 given to him this task 

00:02:28.939 --> 00:02:34.640
 and when he thought of it he announced 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:37.790
 for the people to repent and there was no 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.200
 repende ment Jeremiah said so I 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.290
 I wanted my head to 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:45.560
 turn into water I wanted her 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:49.970
 There was water so I could cry. 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:54.560
 cry for my people to cry for their children 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:57.040

00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:01.189

00:03:01.189 --> 00:03:08.450

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:17.930
 work that represents God's work for 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:21.380
 What do you represent your uniform? 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:24.450
 only a piece of cloth or a garment 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:27.750
 sacred you use for service 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:31.560

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:35.550

 the Corinthian takes his shirt and kisses him 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:46.230

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:07.550
 I remember my workman's uniform 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:07.550
 like it was today 

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:18.810
 brown shirt white pants and tie 

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:21.000
 tied at the time I entered and had 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:25.020
 a plaque a badge an 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:27.720
 written acrylic plate that amy was 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:29.910
 written a missionary on Sundays 

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:31.470
 because before I shone at that time if 

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:34.770
 he called resigning 

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:37.020
 so I had a plate I kept 

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:38.610
 for many years but changes there 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:41.010
 and I 'm going to go there and I'm losing 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:46.110
 but I wanted to know about it until 

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:48.740
 I wanted to have my plate up today. 

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:50.790
 today written and missionary sundays 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:53.760
 You know that I did 

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:57.480
 I came home and got my pants. 

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:59.790
 I put my 

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:03.570
 tie hanging took my badge 

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:06.660
 I'm working on the tie plate well. 

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:09.300
 straight what I thought 

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:11.100
 Tomorrow, come on, my uniform again. 

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:12.780
 to serve my god 

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:16.380
 and when I put on a 

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:19.560
 I felt so 

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:22.110
 I felt so beautiful so beautiful that 

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:24.200
 Beautiful clothes were the clothes I was wearing. 

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:29.610
 using 

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:31.569
 It was beautiful, my clothes were not bright. 

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:34.869
 it was the clothes itself 

00:06:31.569 --> 00:06:41.740
 was what she represented in the 

00:06:34.869 --> 00:06:45.300
 Soldier of God, your uniform is a burden. 

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:45.300
 or a fairy 

00:06:47.259 --> 00:06:55.029
 it may be that over time your 

00:06:50.439 --> 00:06:58.499
 has become a burden and you 

00:06:55.029 --> 00:07:02.649
 You're crazy to get away but you're afraid. 

00:06:58.499 --> 00:07:05.619
 to be tense and if I stop being the 

00:07:02.649 --> 00:07:08.319
 breno the devil to rise against me 

00:07:05.619 --> 00:07:09.459
 This is what makes you keep your 

00:07:08.319 --> 00:07:12.369
 uniform 

00:07:09.459 --> 00:07:17.439
 So you already fell and did not realize it. 

00:07:12.369 --> 00:07:20.909
 that because you have a thing a 

00:07:17.439 --> 00:07:25.389
 God is working is the desire to serve him 

00:07:20.909 --> 00:07:31.439
 for it is written that they which are of faith 

00:07:25.389 --> 00:07:35.669
 do not back down there is no back 

00:07:31.439 --> 00:07:38.979
 if you fall back you 're lost 

00:07:35.669 --> 00:07:41.589
 there is no turning back for us we enter 

00:07:38.979 --> 00:07:46.269
 on this path and we will go through it to the end 

00:07:41.589 --> 00:07:50.589
 of our lives and whoever comes back will 

00:07:46.269 --> 00:07:54.399
 to go back and meet the devil 

00:07:50.589 --> 00:07:56.619
 come back to meet him because 

00:07:54.399 --> 00:07:57.339
 God did not stay there, God stands before 

00:07:56.619 --> 00:08:01.419
 we 

00:07:57.339 --> 00:08:03.389
 The cloud is guiding us we have to 

00:08:01.419 --> 00:08:06.639
 follow her 

00:08:03.389 --> 00:08:11.729
 if you stay god you can not count on 

00:08:06.639 --> 00:08:11.729
 Do you think about it?
