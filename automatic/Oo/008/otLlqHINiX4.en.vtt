00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.990
 I will explain how to play a tweak on the guitar 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:09.420
 more precisely to say bases and pinch 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:14.240
 from the beginning and for example we put a chord am. 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:16.550
 play one of the three bass strings fifth 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:21.529
 then three lower strings 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:21.529
 at the same time the third pair and the first 

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:29.190
 3 we have the index finger 

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:32.640
 tugging second middle and 1 nameless 

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:35.489
 then again so is bass string 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:40.350
 taken that you need to alternate bass 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:42.629
 strings if we first extracted the fifth one 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.510
 there is an empty she we note la then 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:49.590
 the next one should be another bass 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:52.530
 note and not necessarily what is different 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:55.850
 the string you can be sandwiched little finger 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:01:00.000
 for example, too, 5 string on the third fret 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:03.780
 like this, the raccoon will be different, that is, we 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.670
 played means you have an empty 5 then three 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.770
 bottom strings 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:15.659
 checked and then little finger 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:16.560
 we clamp 3 frets 5 strings and play and again 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.760
 thereafter 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:23.060
 punching 3 lower strings 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:25.670
 for beginners is a complex variant is easier 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:29.150
 it will be natural when you first 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.590
 played fifth empty then box 0 and 3 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:35.170
 nothing strings 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:40.729
 then comes either 6 empty 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:46.549
 either 4 sandwiched already in a chord naturally 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:51.490
 and so all the time you can walk by the way 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:51.490
 constantly on these 3 strings 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.930
 the main thing is not to repeat 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:01.660
 this is how the bass strings alternate 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:03.940
 so if you see somewhere you spell 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:07.700
 or says alternating bass 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:10.670
 strings means exactly this 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.390
 here is another important point that some 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.650
 chords 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:18.440
 6 not played she just upsets 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.910
 all the sound does not go she in the chord all 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:23.420
 need to understand it 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:26.300
 for example, this is usually the bottom chords 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:32.030
 which is put on the first three strings 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:34.670
 lower brands im also d d7 all that 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:38.620
 they have strings even for bars and everything 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:40.519
 bottom around the neck of 6 it does not go 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:46.280
 so there is played 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:49.069
 either 5 or 4 and in some cases but 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.920
 these are rarer cases and the fifth is not even 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:54.440
 goes on not on some chords but need 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:57.130
 the main thing to remember is exactly on the bottom 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:02.299
 string 6 does not go therefore when 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:04.910
 rearrange for example c go all bass 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:07.700
 the strings are all bass too 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:11.480
 that is, everything on the middle and upper 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:14.780
 strings all go three no alternate these 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:17.750
 three bass strings as soon as dm and here 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:23.440
 all that is connected with the bottom three 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:26.359
 boldly discarding means going 5 4 5 4 and 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:29.240
 train alternately large 

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:31.800
 right finger i.e. 

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:36.630
 there is 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:39.090
 nick and skill letting a little but 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:41.790
 this skill therefore train 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:44.460
 thumb naturally by this method 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:47.160
 tick pin 3 bottom strings played 

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:49.670
 a lot of songs so its a must 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:52.580
 need to learn 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:55.989
 I hope helped to deal with it 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:55.989
 matter of all good
