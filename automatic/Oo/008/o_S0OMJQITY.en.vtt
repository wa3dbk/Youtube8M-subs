clenching<00:00:51.179> which<00:00:51.390> was<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.660> smart<00:00:51.929> thing<00:00:52.109> to

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
clenching which was the smart thing to

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.540 
clenching which was the smart thing to
do<00:00:52.379> with<00:00:52.589> us<00:00:52.710> which<00:00:52.739> is<00:00:52.890> supposed<00:00:53.219> to<00:00:53.309> do<00:00:53.429> when

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
do with us which is supposed to do when

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.180 
do with us which is supposed to do when
you<00:00:53.609> get<00:00:53.760> hurt<00:00:53.969> and<00:00:54.890> he<00:00:55.890> didn't<00:00:56.280> panic<00:00:56.550> and

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
made it through the room and I guess

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.070 
made it through the room and I guess
then<00:01:02.070> that<00:01:02.999> punch<00:01:03.269> must<00:01:03.539> have<00:01:03.629> been<00:01:03.749> a<00:01:03.780> wake-up

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
then that punch must have been a wake-up

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.550 
then that punch must have been a wake-up
call<00:01:04.290> him<00:01:04.830> cuz<00:01:05.250> from<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:06.270> third<00:01:06.540> round<00:01:06.810> on<00:01:07.140> to

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
call him cuz from the third round on to

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.190 
call him cuz from the third round on to
the<00:01:07.680> last<00:01:07.890> round<00:01:08.659> it<00:01:09.659> was<00:01:09.840> just<00:01:10.020> all

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
the last round it was just all

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.280 
the last round it was just all
mayweather<00:01:10.770> he<00:01:11.690> dominated<00:01:12.690> all<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.110> rounds

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
mayweather he dominated all the rounds

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.260 
mayweather he dominated all the rounds
after<00:01:13.530> that<00:01:15.200> he<00:01:16.200> was<00:01:16.290> landing<00:01:16.590> good<00:01:16.710> jabs<00:01:17.270> good

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
after that he was landing good jabs good

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.899

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:22.909 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:28.709 

basically<00:01:23.920> shane<00:01:24.920> mosley<00:01:25.249> just<00:01:25.729> faded<00:01:26.270> i

00:01:28.709 --> 00:01:28.719 

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:31.450 

guess<00:01:29.719> it<00:01:29.899> must<00:01:30.079> be<00:01:30.259> the<00:01:30.499> his<00:01:30.859> age<00:01:31.039> you<00:01:31.340> know

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.460 
guess it must be the his age you know

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.980 
guess it must be the his age you know
cuz<00:01:31.640> he's<00:01:31.789> 38<00:01:32.210> years<00:01:32.240> old<00:01:33.490> but<00:01:34.490> i<00:01:34.899> noticed<00:01:35.899> he

00:01:37.599 --> 00:01:37.609

00:02:31.089 --> 00:02:31.099 
could work something out with his drug

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:33.069 
could work something out with his drug
testing<00:02:31.609> where<00:02:32.329> they<00:02:32.420> can<00:02:32.569> get<00:02:32.690> this<00:02:32.870> fight

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:33.079 
testing where they can get this fight

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:35.500 
testing where they can get this fight
that<00:02:33.290> happened<00:02:33.880> because<00:02:34.880> it'd<00:02:35.120> be<00:02:35.269> a<00:02:35.299> damn

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
that happened because it'd be a damn

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.420 
that happened because it'd be a damn
shame<00:02:35.569> of<00:02:36.139> this<00:02:36.260> fight<00:02:36.470> never<00:02:36.680> happens

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
shame of this fight never happens

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.179 
shame of this fight never happens
but<00:02:39.030> it's<00:02:39.150> just<00:02:39.299> like<00:02:39.420> I<00:02:39.540> predicted<00:02:39.689> a<00:02:40.189> Shane

00:02:41.179 --> 00:02:41.189 
but it's just like I predicted a Shane

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:47.350 
but it's just like I predicted a Shane
Mosley<00:02:41.609> was<00:02:41.700> just<00:02:41.939> too<00:02:42.120> old<00:02:43.730> he<00:02:44.730> faded

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.160 

I'm<00:02:48.080> Boettcher<00:02:48.380> that's<00:02:48.530> why<00:02:48.650> I<00:02:48.680> mayweather<00:02:49.160> uh

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170

picked<00:02:52.000> mostly<00:02:53.000> to<00:02:53.210> fight<00:02:53.420> pussy<00:02:53.720> he<00:02:54.500> was

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
picked mostly to fight pussy he was

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.490 
picked mostly to fight pussy he was
probably<00:02:54.830> hoping<00:02:55.070> that<00:02:55.900> he<00:02:56.900> would<00:02:57.050> fade<00:02:57.290> in

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
probably hoping that he would fade in

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:58.900 
probably hoping that he would fade in
the<00:02:57.530> late<00:02:57.740> rounds<00:02:57.980> because<00:02:58.310> of<00:02:58.520> his<00:02:58.640> old<00:02:58.790> age

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
the late rounds because of his old age

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:00.760 
the late rounds because of his old age
and<00:02:59.330> looks<00:02:59.810> like<00:03:00.020> that's<00:03:00.170> exactly<00:03:00.560> what

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:00.770 
and looks like that's exactly what

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:04.030 
and looks like that's exactly what
happened<00:03:02.320> so<00:03:03.320> tell<00:03:03.620> me<00:03:03.650> what<00:03:03.830> you<00:03:03.920> guys
