00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.250
 greet you dear subscriber 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:08.370
 I have today 

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:13.730
 package wrapped next I started 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:17.640
 skiing and has written myself 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:20.699
 partial gear partial things buzz 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.439
 that is, I buy something in the store but 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:27.380
 some things are still better written out 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:33.950
 from China and writing out with aliexpress 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:39.600
 gloves gloves waterproof 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:42.379
 Good quality gloves 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.250
 there is well how to say writing out 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:46.980
 some things from china 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.590
 We first of all think of course that 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.800
 will come that is possible such a situation 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:55.739
 what's in the picture in the store will be 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.260
 everything looks beautiful 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.989
 wonderful but will actually come 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.370
 some bullshit so here I think that 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.970
 Now such an opinion 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:09.710
 most likely erroneous things are coming 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:12.770
 very good quality and 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:15.540
 high quality how to say manufacture 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:21.049
 quality production here for example 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:21.049
 these gloves are one piece of a thumb 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:29.479
 bills from such velvet it is made for 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:33.270
 to wipe glasses 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:37.170
 so here too the skin has 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:39.030
 some kind of coverage like soft-touch 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.659
 on the one hand the softness of the other side 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.600
 nice to touch here 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.790
 polyester 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:51.079
 there is a layout such 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:51.079
 in general, as it were 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:58.729
 nice fabric to the touch and inside very 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:02.720
 very very comfortable and not even hunting 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:07.520
 pull out here to be honest hands well and 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:09.489
 such cuffs are wonderful 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:13.130
 gloves 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:16.459
 See the link to the store in 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:20.390
 description there are several colors 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:25.610
 including bright more suitable for 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:32.269
 women are also different sizes so here 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:33.430
 number two is glasses a mask like this 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:38.690
 mask 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:46.180
 wiping cloth 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:49.160
 glass is also done everything is solid 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:51.860
 as you know it's me unpacking my 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:54.080
 not the first when I immediately unpacked was 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:56.510
 the film on this side of the glass was 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.070
 protective shipping film and with 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.360
 back side was significantly 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:02.870
 shipping film 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:05.420
 glasses well mask fits well here 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:09.610
 this is the inside is made soft 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:14.360
 and here it is already made so much harder 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:15.470
 no low tides like cheap ones 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:19.280
 plastic toys 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:24.820
 that is, you can see that everything is done clearly 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:29.049
 excellent well, as if conscientiously 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:29.049
 no, I do not see consumer goods 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:39.500
 Here Masha is worth $ 27 that is 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:44.190
 think for the price of 27 dollars this 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:47.480
 well let's say roughly 1000 and these from 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:50.010
 three to five thousand rubles which 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:58.340
 who take but exactly the same in 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:58.340
 the store is such a little bag 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:05.360
 rag 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:10.500
 so well still for this mask 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:11.570
 there is such a beak or how it is 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:18.109
 called 

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:18.109
 in order not to not burn nose 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:31.760
 so here it snaps now 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:31.760
 all complete 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:40.830
 these are the things that came to me 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:43.290
 from China to approach three parcels so 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:45.660
 that watch the video and in the next 

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:49.080
 video lessons we will return to the topic of repair 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:51.450
 I already have several repairs 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:54.320
 so the next video will be about 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:57.030
 repair equipment 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:05:02.070
 whom information seemed useful 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:05.150
 like the link to the store below well 

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:05.150
 and until the next lesson
