the water and of the flavor is not going
to<00:02:21.720> be<00:02:21.900> that<00:02:22.140> strong<00:02:22.800> it's<00:02:23.069> pretty<00:02:23.340> subtle<00:02:23.700> but

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
to be that strong it's pretty subtle but

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.660 
to be that strong it's pretty subtle but
it's<00:02:24.870> definitely<00:02:25.170> really<00:02:25.980> refreshing

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
it's definitely really refreshing

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.190 
it's definitely really refreshing
especially<00:02:26.910> like<00:02:27.330> on<00:02:27.360> a<00:02:27.480> hot<00:02:27.660> day<00:02:27.900> although

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
especially like on a hot day although

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.900 
especially like on a hot day although
you<00:02:28.380> can<00:02:28.620> have<00:02:28.890> it<00:02:29.069> pretty<00:02:29.220> much<00:02:29.459> year-round

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
you can have it pretty much year-round

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.390 
you can have it pretty much year-round
it<00:02:30.690> just<00:02:30.930> gives<00:02:31.140> your<00:02:31.410> water<00:02:31.650> just<00:02:31.830> a<00:02:32.160> little

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
it just gives your water just a little

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.880 
it just gives your water just a little
bit<00:02:32.519> more<00:02:32.640> flavor<00:02:32.880> and<00:02:33.299> the<00:02:33.330> other<00:02:34.230> important

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
bit more flavor and the other important

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.460 
bit more flavor and the other important
thing<00:02:35.040> is<00:02:35.190> that<00:02:35.220> it<00:02:35.640> doesn't<00:02:36.030> add<00:02:36.299> pretty<00:02:37.290> much

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
thing is that it doesn't add pretty much

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:38.690 
thing is that it doesn't add pretty much
any<00:02:37.650> calories<00:02:37.980> because<00:02:38.340> you're<00:02:38.459> not<00:02:38.549> really

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
any calories because you're not really

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.970 
any calories because you're not really
consuming<00:02:39.480> the<00:02:40.110> strawberries<00:02:40.709> you're<00:02:40.799> just

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
consuming the strawberries you're just

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.430

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:44.809 
getting you know some of the juices so
that<00:02:43.769> doesn't<00:02:44.069> really<00:02:44.100> add<00:02:44.400> too<00:02:44.700> many

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:44.819 
that doesn't really add too many

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:46.580 
that doesn't really add too many
calories<00:02:45.150> all<00:02:45.750> right<00:02:45.900> that's<00:02:46.110> about<00:02:46.410> it<00:02:46.440> for
