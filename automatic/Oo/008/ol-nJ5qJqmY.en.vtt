that it increases latency when you have
it<00:01:24.090> snapped<00:01:25.790> now<00:01:26.790> I'll<00:01:27.210> add<00:01:27.810> at<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.890> end<00:01:28.920> of

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
it snapped now I'll add at the end of

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.249 
it snapped now I'll add at the end of
this<00:01:29.220> video<00:01:29.490> how<00:01:30.450> to<00:01:30.479> make<00:01:30.780> sure<00:01:30.990> that<00:01:31.110> you're

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
this video how to make sure that you're

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.270 
this video how to make sure that you're
recording<00:01:31.530> in<00:01:31.890> a<00:01:32.150> 720p<00:01:33.200> rather<00:01:34.200> than<00:01:34.530> like<00:01:34.740> 480

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
recording in a 720p rather than like 480

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.310 
recording in a 720p rather than like 480
or<00:01:35.400> 360<00:01:36.180> P<00:01:36.360> I'll<00:01:36.509> add<00:01:36.689> that<00:01:36.869> and<00:01:37.049> at<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.290> end

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
or 360 P I'll add that and at the end

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.289 
or 360 P I'll add that and at the end
because<00:01:37.680> that<00:01:37.710> has<00:01:37.979> to<00:01:38.009> do<00:01:38.280> deal<00:01:38.970> with<00:01:39.000> the

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
because that has to do deal with the

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.340 
because that has to do deal with the
Xbox<00:01:40.259> ones<00:01:40.590> end<00:01:41.270> rather<00:01:42.270> than<00:01:42.479> twitch<00:01:42.930> is<00:01:43.110> n<00:01:43.229> so

00:04:09.809 --> 00:04:09.819 
now if your internet is decent at all

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:12.569 
now if your internet is decent at all
and<00:04:10.120> you<00:04:10.540> have<00:04:10.660> decent<00:04:11.079> bandwidth<00:04:11.470> it'll<00:04:12.430> give

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:12.579 
and you have decent bandwidth it'll give

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:15.720 
and you have decent bandwidth it'll give
you<00:04:12.670> 2,500<00:04:13.510> as<00:04:13.600> a<00:04:13.630> recommendation<00:04:14.549> so<00:04:15.549> let's

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:15.730 
you 2,500 as a recommendation so let's

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:17.819 
you 2,500 as a recommendation so let's
see<00:04:15.910> what<00:04:16.060> it<00:04:16.150> gives<00:04:16.239> us<00:04:16.479> this<00:04:16.660> time<00:04:16.959> and<00:04:17.200> if<00:04:17.739> it

00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:17.829 
see what it gives us this time and if it

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:19.500 
see what it gives us this time and if it
doesn't<00:04:18.100> work<00:04:18.190> the<00:04:18.340> first<00:04:18.549> time<00:04:18.669> I'll<00:04:19.060> try<00:04:19.389> it

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:19.510 
doesn't work the first time I'll try it

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:21.240 
doesn't work the first time I'll try it
again<00:04:19.630> by<00:04:19.989> turning<00:04:20.410> off<00:04:20.530> a<00:04:20.560> couple<00:04:20.829> things<00:04:21.130> in

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.250 
again by turning off a couple things in

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:23.250 
again by turning off a couple things in
the<00:04:21.340> house<00:04:21.489> that<00:04:21.519> are<00:04:21.850> on<00:04:21.970> Wi-Fi<00:04:22.150> and<00:04:22.599> then

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:23.260 
the house that are on Wi-Fi and then

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.680 
the house that are on Wi-Fi and then
redo<00:04:23.650> it<00:04:23.910> other<00:04:24.910> than<00:04:25.000> if<00:04:25.150> you<00:04:25.240> do<00:04:25.360> that<00:04:25.539> other

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:25.690 
redo it other than if you do that other

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:27.240 
redo it other than if you do that other
trick<00:04:25.960> that<00:04:25.990> I<00:04:26.139> told<00:04:26.380> you<00:04:26.500> about<00:04:26.590> unsnapping

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.250 
trick that I told you about unsnapping

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:30.719 
trick that I told you about unsnapping
while<00:04:28.180> you're<00:04:28.419> recording<00:04:28.930> or<00:04:29.729> broadcasting

00:04:30.719 --> 00:04:30.729 
while you're recording or broadcasting

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:33.210 
while you're recording or broadcasting
in<00:04:30.849> this<00:04:30.940> case<00:04:31.150> um<00:04:31.360> it<00:04:32.200> decreases<00:04:33.039> lead

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:33.220 
in this case um it decreases lead

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:35.940 
in this case um it decreases lead
latency<00:04:34.030> and<00:04:34.300> gives<00:04:34.810> you<00:04:34.930> more<00:04:35.139> connection<00:04:35.710> or

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:35.950 
latency and gives you more connection or

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:39.600 
latency and gives you more connection or
straight<00:04:36.669> to<00:04:36.820> the<00:04:36.940> export<00:04:37.389> and<00:04:38.340> this<00:04:39.340> does

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:39.610 
straight to the export and this does

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:41.610 
straight to the export and this does
take<00:04:39.940> a<00:04:39.970> while<00:04:40.090> every<00:04:40.690> single<00:04:40.960> time<00:04:41.169> so<00:04:41.440> don't

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:41.620 
take a while every single time so don't

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:43.560 
take a while every single time so don't
get<00:04:41.770> all<00:04:41.919> caught<00:04:42.520> up<00:04:42.580> if<00:04:42.880> it's<00:04:43.030> taking<00:04:43.389> a<00:04:43.419> while

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:43.570 
get all caught up if it's taking a while

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:45.290 
get all caught up if it's taking a while
thinking<00:04:43.960> that<00:04:44.110> you're<00:04:44.200> going<00:04:44.320> to<00:04:44.349> get<00:04:44.440> a<00:04:44.500> low

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300 
thinking that you're going to get a low

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.010 
thinking that you're going to get a low
recommendation<00:04:46.300> so<00:04:46.419> let's<00:04:46.539> go<00:04:46.660> down<00:04:46.840> to<00:04:46.930> my

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:47.020 
recommendation so let's go down to my

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:49.440 
recommendation so let's go down to my
recommendation<00:04:47.800> again<00:04:48.370> and<00:04:48.789> see<00:04:48.970> what<00:04:49.120> I<00:04:49.150> got

recommendation again and see what I got

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:52.409 
recommendation again and see what I got
see<00:04:50.310> 2500<00:04:51.310> kilobytes<00:04:51.760> per<00:04:51.849> second<00:04:52.270> so<00:04:52.330> that's

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:52.419 
see 2500 kilobytes per second so that's

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:55.890 
see 2500 kilobytes per second so that's
20<00:04:52.750> 720p<00:04:53.470> it<00:04:54.130> will<00:04:54.250> almost<00:04:54.460> always<00:04:54.849> be<00:04:55.180> like
