going to clear that up today
unfortunately<00:00:15.809> in<00:00:15.929> this<00:00:16.049> day<00:00:16.289> and<00:00:16.320> age<00:00:17.840> like

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
unfortunately in this day and age like

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.890 
unfortunately in this day and age like
bread<00:00:19.230> for<00:00:19.500> instance<00:00:19.890> they've<00:00:20.400> taken<00:00:20.730> out<00:00:21.119> the

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
bread for instance they've taken out the

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.080 
bread for instance they've taken out the
vitamins<00:00:22.710> and<00:00:22.800> minerals<00:00:23.010> because<00:00:23.340> they<00:00:23.910> won't

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
vitamins and minerals because they won't

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.029 
vitamins and minerals because they won't
store<00:00:24.720> on<00:00:24.840> the<00:00:24.960> Shelf<00:00:25.289> with<00:00:25.560> them<00:00:25.710> in<00:00:25.859> there

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
store on the Shelf with them in there

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.620 
store on the Shelf with them in there
they<00:00:26.400> take<00:00:26.609> them<00:00:26.789> out<00:00:26.939> and<00:00:27.029> then<00:00:27.150> they<00:00:27.180> add<00:00:27.420> in

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
they take them out and then they add in

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.080 
they take them out and then they add in
synthetic<00:00:28.230> ones<00:00:28.470> that<00:00:29.130> won't<00:00:29.550> make<00:00:29.699> it<00:00:29.880> rot

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
synthetic ones that won't make it rot

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.959 
synthetic ones that won't make it rot
basically<00:00:30.720> so<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:32.219> next<00:00:32.520> thing<00:00:32.669> that<00:00:32.700> comes

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
basically so the next thing that comes

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.459 
basically so the next thing that comes
from<00:00:33.180> that<00:00:33.390> is<00:00:33.600> people<00:00:34.079> try<00:00:34.260> to<00:00:34.290> take

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
from that is people try to take

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.889 
from that is people try to take
supplements<00:00:34.890> in<00:00:35.280> order<00:00:35.520> to<00:00:35.730> make<00:00:36.420> up<00:00:36.630> for<00:00:36.809> this

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
supplements in order to make up for this

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:42.300 
supplements in order to make up for this
lack<00:00:37.140> of<00:00:37.320> nutrition<00:00:37.860> that's<00:00:38.010> in<00:00:38.129> their<00:00:38.280> food

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:42.310 

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:44.190 

what<00:00:43.060> I'm<00:00:43.150> actually<00:00:43.300> going<00:00:43.570> to<00:00:43.660> talk<00:00:43.810> about<00:00:43.960> is

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:44.200 
what I'm actually going to talk about is

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.450 
what I'm actually going to talk about is
where<00:00:44.380> you<00:00:44.470> get<00:00:44.590> vitamins<00:00:45.040> from<00:00:45.190> and<00:00:45.400> the

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:45.460 
where you get vitamins from and the

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.610 
where you get vitamins from and the
different<00:00:45.760> sources<00:00:45.970> of<00:00:46.240> vitamins<00:00:46.630> the<00:00:47.380> first

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:47.620 
different sources of vitamins the first

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.160 
different sources of vitamins the first
one<00:00:47.920> and<00:00:48.190> absolutely<00:00:48.820> the<00:00:48.880> worst<00:00:49.480> one<00:00:49.900> are

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:50.170 
one and absolutely the worst one are

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.100 
one and absolutely the worst one are
synthetic<00:00:51.130> vitamins<00:00:51.610> or<00:00:51.870> vitamins<00:00:52.870> that<00:00:53.020> are

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:53.110 
synthetic vitamins or vitamins that are

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
synthetic vitamins or vitamins that are
actually<00:00:53.470> made<00:00:53.680> in<00:00:53.830> the<00:00:53.920> laboratory

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:54.130 
actually made in the laboratory

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:56.070 
actually made in the laboratory
synthesized<00:00:55.120> and<00:00:55.330> made<00:00:55.450> in<00:00:55.570> the<00:00:55.600> laboratory

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:56.080 
synthesized and made in the laboratory

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.320 
synthesized and made in the laboratory
and<00:00:56.620> one<00:00:57.310> of<00:00:57.400> the<00:00:57.460> reasons<00:00:57.790> for<00:00:57.850> this<00:00:58.060> is

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:58.330 
and one of the reasons for this is

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:00.480 
and one of the reasons for this is
because<00:00:58.480> it's<00:00:58.810> an<00:00:58.930> isolated<00:00:59.260> compound<00:00:59.920> for

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:00.490 
because it's an isolated compound for

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:02.370 
because it's an isolated compound for
instance<00:01:00.820> if<00:01:00.970> you<00:01:01.150> were<00:01:01.300> to<00:01:01.360> eat<00:01:01.900> an<00:01:02.140> orange

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:02.380 
instance if you were to eat an orange

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:05.280 
instance if you were to eat an orange
which<00:01:02.680> has<00:01:02.890> vitamin<00:01:03.460> C<00:01:03.670> in<00:01:03.820> there<00:01:04.170> you<00:01:05.170> would

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:05.290 
which has vitamin C in there you would

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:08.310 
which has vitamin C in there you would
get<00:01:05.500> the<00:01:05.680> entire<00:01:06.040> complex<00:01:06.750> all<00:01:07.750> the<00:01:07.960> different

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:08.320 
get the entire complex all the different

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.110 
get the entire complex all the different
vitamins<00:01:08.890> and<00:01:09.040> minerals<00:01:09.400> that<00:01:09.610> make<00:01:09.910> that

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:10.120 
vitamins and minerals that make that

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.270 
vitamins and minerals that make that
orange<00:01:10.330> complete<00:01:10.930> whereas<00:01:11.650> if<00:01:11.830> you<00:01:11.920> just<00:01:11.950> take

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.280 
orange complete whereas if you just take

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.910 
orange complete whereas if you just take
one<00:01:12.340> piece<00:01:12.820> of<00:01:13.060> that<00:01:13.200> vitamin<00:01:14.200> C<00:01:14.410> which<00:01:14.710> they

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:14.920 
one piece of that vitamin C which they

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.340 
one piece of that vitamin C which they
call<00:01:15.100> a<00:01:15.130> sorbic<00:01:15.729> acid<00:01:15.880> and<00:01:16.360> just<00:01:17.110> take<00:01:17.320> that

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.350 
call a sorbic acid and just take that

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.880 
call a sorbic acid and just take that
your<00:01:18.070> body<00:01:18.400> then<00:01:18.940> has<00:01:19.270> an<00:01:19.690> uncomplete<00:01:20.410> package

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:20.890 
your body then has an uncomplete package

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.450 
your body then has an uncomplete package
which<00:01:21.100> it<00:01:21.310> has<00:01:21.520> to<00:01:21.880> go<00:01:22.869> in<00:01:23.080> and<00:01:23.320> pull<00:01:24.130> from

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.460 
which it has to go in and pull from

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:25.980 
which it has to go in and pull from
different<00:01:24.490> tissues<00:01:25.060> in<00:01:25.210> the<00:01:25.240> body<00:01:25.420> to<00:01:25.690> make<00:01:25.869> it

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990 
different tissues in the body to make it

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:27.660 
different tissues in the body to make it
complete<00:01:26.410> so<00:01:26.890> it<00:01:26.979> can<00:01:27.100> actually<00:01:27.280> cause

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670 
complete so it can actually cause

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:29.280 
complete so it can actually cause
nutritional<00:01:28.360> deficiencies<00:01:28.990> and

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:29.290 
nutritional deficiencies and

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:31.320 
nutritional deficiencies and
unfortunately<00:01:30.160> this<00:01:30.340> is<00:01:30.520> the<00:01:30.550> most<00:01:30.820> common

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:31.330 
unfortunately this is the most common

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:32.600 
unfortunately this is the most common
one<00:01:31.479> that<00:01:31.510> people<00:01:31.660> use<00:01:31.930> it's<00:01:32.440> actually

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
one that people use it's actually

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.969 
one that people use it's actually
nutraceutical<00:01:34.320> again<00:01:35.320> made<00:01:35.590> in<00:01:35.619> a<00:01:35.770> laboratory

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:35.979 
nutraceutical again made in a laboratory

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:39.090 
nutraceutical again made in a laboratory
not<00:01:36.790> from<00:01:37.150> food<00:01:37.450> and<00:01:37.750> that<00:01:37.900> is<00:01:38.110> the<00:01:38.350> worst<00:01:38.740> kind

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
not from food and that is the worst kind

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:44.380 
not from food and that is the worst kind
of<00:01:39.220> supplement<00:01:39.759> to<00:01:39.850> take

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.140 

so<00:01:45.390> one<00:01:45.600> step<00:01:45.840> up<00:01:46.080> from<00:01:47.030> nutraceutical<00:01:48.030> or

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:48.150 
so one step up from nutraceutical or

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:49.880 
so one step up from nutraceutical or
synthetic<00:01:48.660> vitamin<00:01:49.110> is<00:01:49.230> actually<00:01:49.650> a<00:01:49.680> natural

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
synthetic vitamin is actually a natural

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.120 
synthetic vitamin is actually a natural
vitamin<00:01:50.520> not<00:01:51.150> necessarily<00:01:51.950> natural<00:01:52.950> that's

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
vitamin not necessarily natural that's

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.980 
vitamin not necessarily natural that's
written<00:01:53.430> on<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:53.640> label<00:01:53.820> because<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.660> FDA

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
written on the label because the FDA

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.960 
written on the label because the FDA
doesn't<00:01:55.320> regulate<00:01:55.800> whether<00:01:56.580> or<00:01:56.850> not

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:56.970 
doesn't regulate whether or not

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:59.210

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
refined meaning they take the carrot

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.550 
refined meaning they take the carrot
root<00:02:29.310> and<00:02:29.489> they<00:02:29.640> extract<00:02:30.300> that<00:02:30.720> piece<00:02:31.230> of<00:02:31.500> the

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
root and they extract that piece of the

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.740 
root and they extract that piece of the
vitamin<00:02:32.280> A<00:02:32.400> from<00:02:32.459> that<00:02:33.030> so<00:02:33.510> it's<00:02:33.660> not

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
vitamin A from that so it's not

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.270 
vitamin A from that so it's not
necessarily<00:02:34.380> going<00:02:34.620> to<00:02:34.739> give<00:02:34.920> you<00:02:35.040> all<00:02:35.070> the

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
able to use that vitamin A but it's

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.120 
able to use that vitamin A but it's
definitely<00:02:39.810> better<00:02:40.200> than<00:02:40.320> something<00:02:40.800> made<00:02:41.010> in
