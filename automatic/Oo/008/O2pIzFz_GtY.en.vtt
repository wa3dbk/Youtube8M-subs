00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.080
 if you are time to listen 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:09.630
 a day like today but in 1998 he debuted 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.120
 Sebastian would kill the lion in a match 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.820
 important because mouth won 4 to 0 front 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.940
 to gymnastics although he got off a few 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.940
 minutes 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:30.080
 of match 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:35.829
 diego cagna 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:47.210
 five minutes less against gymnastics if 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:51.350
 came from the interiors and this 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:56.250
 very quiet the look did not change anything is 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:59.720
 The same is still the same 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.720
 it is quite humble 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:06.190
 conversation and at this moment I had the 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:08.830
 feet a little better than now since 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:11.640
 disown with the feet the good not so much 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:15.250
 it's a little bit 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.830
 you have to give your nails a little 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:22.020
 what bothers him most and two that more than 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:26.420
 you have to take care of the player and his reserve and 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:29.060
 arrived the interim of asia gambón 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:31.580
 and then I had to start training 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.330
 with him with first and I went back to version 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:36.600
 for us and that nothing good 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:38.300
 for me it is impressive 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.870
 I wanted to show 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:43.490
 it's the moment that I finished 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:46.090
 playing from the rural when it came a 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.090
 sparks 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.180
 now those referents of a lot of 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.800
 players especially also from here 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.140
 of mouth of always 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.530
 as a referent at this moment have 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:01.010
 who looks low 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:03.170
 in that moment you end up looking at all 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:05.210
 to lose 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:08.409
 proof of guys were 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.409
 and also where after 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:15.150
 clarity when it came carlos bazán was 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.489
 diego cagna 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:20.010
 right hand drive is a game of five 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:21.330
 also after they tried to watch to play 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.580
 without a doubt 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:26.310
 it's like I think it's also taking a little 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:35.180
 of everything and try to learn from everyone 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:35.180
 but it 's like that 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:39.520
 I also had several but with the theme of 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:43.800
 European framework 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:47.660
 always speaking in first carlos 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.660
 I trust myself in a moment where I 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:56.600
 9 years 18 and 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.600
 very important 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:11.650
 if I'm going to tell the fans how are you 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:14.280
 Now that they want to know how they wanted 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.200
 still 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:19.690
 I still do not lower my arms and with the 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:21.840
 hope of being good and being able to 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:24.220
 train and play what we like and 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.819
 that the day I finish this is 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:29.150
 play us 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:31.609
 I know that I admire you a lot and a 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.409
 fan of yours I know who she is 

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:36.109
 I always told you my lady that always 

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:38.829
 he asks me if you are suffering because 

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:42.290
 Well, not a bitch but you have to go back 

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:46.760
 that's a great player, you had a 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:49.580
 very very good trajectory and good I'll 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:53.600
 I want a lot and I hope 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:56.319
 these 14 years that prevents your debut that 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:04:00.730
 always remember 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:04:05.019
 and all he said is for you or goes 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:06.730
 14 years in the debut so it's very 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:09.069
 old the truth that is very old that 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:12.180
 we can see or not hope that they are any 

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:12.180
 more I do not think but good
