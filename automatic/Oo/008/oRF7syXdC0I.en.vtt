00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.780
 NASA is preparing to carry out a 

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:12.719
 mission that would be the first time that 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.150
 performs not so far as to 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:18.060
 interplanetary bodies selects others 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.949
 planets has just been going to explore 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.660
 to send ships that explored ohanian 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.570
 ships in which like the moon 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.039
 They landing on humans within 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.249
 that body but now it's not about that 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.810
 it's about approaching an asteroid 

00:00:28.249 --> 00:00:32.400
 capture it and bring it down to earth 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.170
 bring it to earth to be able to 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.750
 investigate at will and in your case in the 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.670
 future exploit it commercially we are going to 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.199
 see how this works because although it is 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.510
 true that one of the plans of the 

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:46.710
 president obama said that for the year 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:48.690
 2025 the nash would land a ship 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.460
 inside an asteroid on the 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.620
 surface of the asteroid so that beings 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.050
 humans were there 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.930
 and they will investigate it live is also 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.879
 true that that mission the costs have 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.620
 result being prohibitive are not the 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.110
 times like to address that kind of 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:07.350
 missions then the institute that of 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:11.009
 technology a year ago already proposed that 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:13.860
 could send for a reasonable cost it 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:16.170
 could send an automatic ship not 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.399
 manned to capture a small 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.899
 asteroid would no longer be an asteroid 

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:21.000
 big on which to land are one 

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:22.950
 small about five or seven meters 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.140
 capture it and bring it down to earth 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.360
 put it within reach of an orion rocket 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.310
 for example so that this time there 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.200
 go the astronauts study it and what 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.929
 analyze and do what you have to do 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:37.409
 the scientists how much would this cost 

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:40.830
 for the price for a rock similar to 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.600
 the one that fell on Russia makes 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:44.310
 weeks making that impact 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.740
 being about five or seven meters and 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.830
 about 500 thousand tons of weight because the 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:52.229
 price would be about 2500 2,600 million 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.210
 dollars that's not much for a mission 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.770
 space even if it sounds like it sounds 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.770
 very important amount of money 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:01.259
 and as that is what they would thus a 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:04.829
 specifically designed ship will 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:06.840
 would bring this little asteroid to a 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:09.959
 part of the probe is like a huge cube 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.640
 emptiness that would capture that asteroid and 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:15.239
 then with some drive motors 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.950
 normal electrical would be brought to the 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:18.900
 outskirts of the earth where it 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.060
 I would park that asteroid for later 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.610
 can study it because if not 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.379
 place at a specific point could 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.230
 end up falling on earth and causing 

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:31.380
 some damage but ex there is a series of 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:33.299
 points in the nasa suggests that the best 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:37.110
 of the places would be a known point 

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:40.110
 as ml2 which is a point one of the 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.880
 five big points between between the 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.099
 earth and the moon let's explain a moment 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.500
 which is a lagrange point in a system 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:48.630
 orbital in which two bodies in the 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.540
 space as it is not in orbit of the other 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:53.700
 there are five points five special points 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.650
 where the light gravity of the two 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:59.459
 bodies are canceled and converted to zero 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:01.470
 if you put an object in that in those 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:02.580
 points specifically you can can 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.860
 stay station 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.870
 that is to say without being attracted neither by one nor 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.910
 by one of the two bodies and on the other 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.950
 between the earth and the moon in the system 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:13.140
 orbital or gravitational earth the moon 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:15.210
 there are five points the big one and in l two it is 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.130
 one of them these points are also 

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:18.990
 exploited to place satellites there 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:21.090
 that it suits us that they are always in the 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:22.830
 same position for different types of 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.860
 observations but well going back to 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:27.690
 asteroid this mission capture already that 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.790
 small asteroid and would transport it to 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:31.920
 one of the lagrange points between the 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:34.440
 earth and the moon and there would leave a 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.120
 there with a normal Orion rocket 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.370
 those that exist of those that are used 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:41.760
 now a group of scientists are only 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:44.310
 cars could go explore or get 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.920
 live samples or analyze what 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:48.840
 I would like disaster today of not worth 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.480
 any asteroid the nasa what is 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.860
 thinking is doing it with a kind of 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.180
 asteroids that also turns out to be 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:57.060
 the most common are the chondrites 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:59.280
 carbonaceous that have the peculiarity 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.900
 that they have very low density is like 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:03.209
 a clay ball that has run dry 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:06.180
 They do not contain many types of minerals 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:08.760
 but they are not solid rocks but I already say 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:10.379
 well as as mud agglomerations 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.629
 with which they would be much easier to 

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:15.329
 transport and it also turns out that this 

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:17.100
 type of meteorites are among the most 

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:19.320
 common of those that already fall to the earth 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:23.490
 of the bits that we can identify 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:25.680
 once on earth the future of this 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:28.080
 technique or this technology can be 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:30.870
 very promising because there is already a good 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:34.050
 number of private companies that are 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:37.500
 looking to the sky and looking for new 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:40.100
 places to explode especially for 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.100
 exploit 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:45.750
 to search your minerals and to search 

00:04:43.319 --> 00:04:47.430
 its water and carbonaceous chondrites are 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:50.939
 they lend for both we can 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:53.909
 imagine a near future of mining 

00:04:50.939 --> 00:04:57.360
 space in which private companies 

00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:59.969
 send their ships to drill or to 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.860
 get raw materials do not hate the 

00:04:59.969 --> 00:05:04.110
 land mines but asteroids that 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:05.400
 have been brought to do 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:08.310
 outskirts of the earth for its 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:10.289
 exploitation at this time all the 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:13.349
 technology for this mission is ready 

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:16.020
 the most complicated the hardest thing is 

00:05:13.349 --> 00:05:18.060
 Well, precisely to find 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:19.740
 candidates find these asteroids 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:21.509
 so small 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:23.009
 in the test we have it going back to 

00:05:21.509 --> 00:05:25.319
 meteorite from Russia is that nobody saw it 

00:05:23.009 --> 00:05:28.229
 approach nobody knew that it is that 

00:05:25.319 --> 00:05:29.970
 asteroid so tiny was about 

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:31.979
 to touch the earth and less stop us a 

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:34.889
 scared not why because the technologies 

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:36.419
 of detection of telescopes that 

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:38.669
 have the automatic programs of 

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:41.130
 search and tracking of this type of 

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:43.289
 objects to the little ones escape 

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:45.900
 it's not yet enough to end 

00:05:43.289 --> 00:05:48.509
 technology like to identify the 

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:50.099
 bodies of small size with which to 

00:05:48.509 --> 00:05:51.509
 the best within the programs 

00:05:50.099 --> 00:05:52.740
 automatic attempts of the 

00:05:51.509 --> 00:05:54.740
 telescopes yes there have been 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:57.509
 identifications but they have been 

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:59.340
 confused with noise and have been discarded 

00:05:57.509 --> 00:06:01.110
 that is to say the first thing that there is 

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:04.319
 do is find a candidate have 

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:06.840
 account that that candidate will travel to 

00:06:04.319 --> 00:06:08.970
 about 40 thousand kilometers per hour and 

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:10.590
 we have to calculate very well where is it going to 

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:12.810
 be in every moment to be able to send 

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:15.599
 the probe and capture it that's the part 

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:17.819
 more difficult although not impossible 

00:06:15.599 --> 00:06:21.599
 of this type of missions in any case 

00:06:17.819 --> 00:06:23.490
 a good experience and a news that 

00:06:21.599 --> 00:06:26.759
 I consider it good because 

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:28.530
 to allow us to expand first study 

00:06:26.759 --> 00:06:30.120
 the origins of our solar system of 

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:31.380
 a much more comfortable way does not 

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:33.750
 Missing to send astronauts to an asteroid 

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:35.819
 far away but bring a small one to the 

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:37.680
 land and studying it is a good idea and 

00:06:35.819 --> 00:06:39.900
 then for this future exploitation 

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:42.360
 commercial to which I referred good 

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:45.470
 time will tell us if this technology is 

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:45.470
 ends up using or not
