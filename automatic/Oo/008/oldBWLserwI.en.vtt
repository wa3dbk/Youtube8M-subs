that the college has taken this approach

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.600 
that the college has taken this approach
if<00:01:07.320> there<00:01:07.470> is<00:01:07.560> an<00:01:07.650> issue<00:01:07.740> of<00:01:07.890> security<00:01:08.310> and

identifying students for exams then
there<00:01:10.860> are<00:01:10.920> other<00:01:11.010> procedures<00:01:11.490> for<00:01:11.700> this<00:01:11.909> we

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
there are other procedures for this we

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.300 
there are other procedures for this we
do<00:01:12.570> not<00:01:12.600> have<00:01:12.840> a<00:01:12.900> legal<00:01:13.020> band<00:01:13.380> like<00:01:13.619> France<00:01:14.040> so

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
do not have a legal band like France so

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.980 
do not have a legal band like France so
I<00:01:14.340> don't<00:01:14.640> know<00:01:14.790> why<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.060> college<00:01:15.540> would<00:01:15.720> want

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
I don't know why the college would want

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.230 
I don't know why the college would want
to<00:01:16.170> do<00:01:16.350> this<00:01:16.560> referring<00:01:17.100> to<00:01:17.310> a<00:01:17.340> much<00:01:17.939> larger

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
to do this referring to a much larger

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.170 
to do this referring to a much larger
band<00:01:18.750> that<00:01:19.560> was<00:01:19.650> passed<00:01:19.860> in<00:01:20.070> France<00:01:20.340> now<00:01:20.939> this

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
band that was passed in France now this

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.700 
band that was passed in France now this
like<00:01:21.509> I<00:01:21.630> said<00:01:21.689> pops<00:01:22.080> up<00:01:22.229> every<00:01:22.409> once<00:01:22.560> in<00:01:22.650> a

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
like I said pops up every once in a

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.340 
like I said pops up every once in a
while<00:01:22.890> and<00:01:23.790> I<00:01:23.970> don't<00:01:24.330> know<00:01:24.540> exactly<00:01:25.020> what<00:01:25.229> the

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
while and I don't know exactly what the

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.310 
while and I don't know exactly what the
solution<00:01:25.770> should<00:01:26.280> be<00:01:26.340> I<00:01:26.790> don't<00:01:27.630> like<00:01:28.049> the

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
solution should be I don't like the

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.289 
solution should be I don't like the
banning<00:01:28.740> of<00:01:28.799> any<00:01:28.979> sort<00:01:29.310> of<00:01:29.369> clothing<00:01:29.850> just<00:01:30.180> as

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
banning of any sort of clothing just as

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:31.880 
banning of any sort of clothing just as
a<00:01:30.329> general<00:01:30.810> rule<00:01:30.840> and<00:01:31.290> I<00:01:31.350> think<00:01:31.619> that<00:01:31.770> it<00:01:31.860> is

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
a general rule and I think that it is

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.550 
a general rule and I think that it is
odd<00:01:32.189> to<00:01:32.220> particularly<00:01:32.880> target<00:01:33.329> a<00:01:33.560> religious

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
odd to particularly target a religious

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.770 
odd to particularly target a religious
group<00:01:34.710> because<00:01:35.250> today<00:01:35.939> it's<00:01:36.090> Muslims<00:01:36.479> but<00:01:36.689> it

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
group because today it's Muslims but it

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.539 
group because today it's Muslims but it
could<00:01:36.900> be<00:01:37.020> a<00:01:37.049> different<00:01:37.409> group<00:01:37.619> in<00:01:37.860> future

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549

walking around campus I think that

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.010 
walking around campus I think that
having<00:02:26.310> a<00:02:26.520> massive<00:02:26.790> problem<00:02:27.450> with<00:02:27.600> wearing<00:02:27.900> a

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
and things of that sort is unnecessary

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.120 
and things of that sort is unnecessary
now<00:02:32.910> it<00:02:33.180> could<00:02:33.450> be<00:02:33.750> that<00:02:34.080> some<00:02:34.320> criminal<00:02:34.920> could

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
now it could be that some criminal could

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:36.920 
now it could be that some criminal could
hide<00:02:35.370> themselves<00:02:35.640> by<00:02:36.120> wearing<00:02:36.390> a<00:02:36.540> burka<00:02:36.900> or

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
hide themselves by wearing a burka or

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.900 
hide themselves by wearing a burka or
something<00:02:37.320> like<00:02:37.410> that<00:02:37.470> or<00:02:37.860> a<00:02:37.950> shooter<00:02:38.700> could

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
something like that or a shooter could

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.360 
something like that or a shooter could
use<00:02:39.090> that<00:02:39.270> to<00:02:39.390> get<00:02:39.480> on<00:02:39.630> campus<00:02:40.130> let's<00:02:41.130> deal

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
use that to get on campus let's deal

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:42.650 
use that to get on campus let's deal
with<00:02:41.400> that<00:02:41.670> after<00:02:42.060> it<00:02:42.120> happens<00:02:42.480> I<00:02:42.630> think

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
with that after it happens I think

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.390 
with that after it happens I think
because<00:02:42.990> there's<00:02:43.290> no<00:02:43.470> precedent<00:02:43.770> for<00:02:44.100> there's

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
because there's no precedent for there's

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.190 
because there's no precedent for there's
no<00:02:44.460> reason<00:02:44.910> to<00:02:44.940> assume<00:02:45.360> that<00:02:45.600> that<00:02:45.990> is<00:02:46.140> going

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
no reason to assume that that is going

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.440 
no reason to assume that that is going
to<00:02:46.440> be<00:02:46.530> a<00:02:46.560> massive<00:02:47.010> issue<00:02:47.160> it's<00:02:47.760> theoretically

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
to be a massive issue it's theoretically

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.690 
to be a massive issue it's theoretically
an<00:02:48.570> issue<00:02:48.720> but<00:02:49.260> not<00:02:49.440> an<00:02:49.560> established<00:02:49.980> one<00:02:50.160> now

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
an issue but not an established one now

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.790 
an issue but not an established one now
in<00:02:50.820> terms<00:02:51.030> of<00:02:51.210> going<00:02:51.390> in<00:02:51.750> and<00:02:51.990> taking<00:02:52.140> tests

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
in terms of going in and taking tests

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.890 
in terms of going in and taking tests
and<00:02:52.950> things<00:02:53.070> like<00:02:53.280> that<00:02:53.340> that<00:02:54.330> I<00:02:54.390> think<00:02:54.780> is<00:02:54.870> a

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
and things like that that I think is a

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.660 
and things like that that I think is a
more<00:02:55.110> compelling<00:02:55.500> reason<00:02:55.980> to<00:02:56.010> want<00:02:56.400> to<00:02:56.550> have

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
more compelling reason to want to have

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.400 
more compelling reason to want to have
some<00:02:56.970> sort<00:02:57.210> of<00:02:57.300> security<00:02:57.510> measures<00:02:57.990> in<00:02:58.200> place

some sort of security measures in place

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.800 
some sort of security measures in place
and<00:02:58.920> just<00:02:59.850> in<00:02:59.940> terms<00:03:00.060> of<00:03:00.240> making<00:03:00.390> sure<00:03:00.540> that

and just in terms of making sure that

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.540 
and just in terms of making sure that
the<00:03:00.870> person<00:03:00.990> taking<00:03:01.290> the<00:03:01.470> test<00:03:01.680> is<00:03:01.920> the<00:03:02.250> person

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
the person taking the test is the person

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:03.980 
the person taking the test is the person

who's supposed to be taking the test now

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:06.650 
who's supposed to be taking the test now
it<00:03:04.590> is<00:03:05.280> complicated<00:03:05.970> I'm<00:03:06.090> sure<00:03:06.330> that<00:03:06.510> schools

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
it is complicated I'm sure that schools

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.270 
it is complicated I'm sure that schools
have<00:03:06.810> come<00:03:07.050> up<00:03:07.140> with<00:03:07.170> solutions<00:03:07.440> I<00:03:07.860> just<00:03:08.100> don't

have come up with solutions I just don't

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.120 
have come up with solutions I just don't
know<00:03:08.370> what<00:03:08.520> they<00:03:08.670> are<00:03:08.700> at<00:03:09.060> this<00:03:09.210> point<00:03:09.540> and

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.130 
know what they are at this point and

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:13.070 
know what they are at this point and
like<00:03:11.130> simply<00:03:11.490> handing<00:03:11.760> over<00:03:11.820> an<00:03:12.030> ID<00:03:12.180> that's

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
like simply handing over an ID that's

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.200 
like simply handing over an ID that's
something<00:03:13.440> but<00:03:14.400> it's<00:03:14.550> not<00:03:14.730> proof<00:03:15.000> positive

something but it's not proof positive

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:17.710 
something but it's not proof positive
that<00:03:15.540> you<00:03:15.780> are<00:03:15.930> the<00:03:16.140> same<00:03:16.320> person<00:03:16.530> and<00:03:16.950> perhaps

that you are the same person and perhaps

that you are the same person and perhaps
right<00:03:18.720> when<00:03:19.020> you<00:03:19.170> take<00:03:19.440> the<00:03:19.680> test<00:03:19.860> you<00:03:20.130> reveal

right when you take the test you reveal
your<00:03:20.610> face<00:03:20.820> I<00:03:20.970> don't<00:03:21.030> know<00:03:21.210> if<00:03:21.300> that<00:03:21.450> would<00:03:21.570> be

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
your face I don't know if that would be

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:25.220 
your face I don't know if that would be
more<00:03:22.520> acceptable<00:03:23.520> to<00:03:23.750> Muslim<00:03:24.750> students<00:03:25.140> at

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
more acceptable to Muslim students at

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.440 
more acceptable to Muslim students at
Birmingham<00:03:25.650> metropolitan<00:03:26.220> college<00:03:26.370> and<00:03:26.730> I

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
Birmingham metropolitan college and I

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:28.940 
Birmingham metropolitan college and I
assume<00:03:27.750> it<00:03:27.870> would<00:03:27.930> be<00:03:28.080> a<00:03:28.260> step<00:03:28.590> in<00:03:28.650> the<00:03:28.800> right

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
assume it would be a step in the right

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:30.950 
assume it would be a step in the right
direction<00:03:29.010> but<00:03:29.640> it<00:03:30.420> is<00:03:30.510> obviously

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:30.960 
direction but it is obviously

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.840 
direction but it is obviously
complicated<00:03:31.680> and<00:03:31.950> I<00:03:32.190> think<00:03:32.460> that<00:03:32.610> this<00:03:32.670> is

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
complicated and I think that this is

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:34.220 
complicated and I think that this is
something<00:03:33.030> that<00:03:33.150> many<00:03:33.360> universities<00:03:34.110> are

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
something that many universities are

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:35.390 
something that many universities are
going<00:03:34.380> to<00:03:34.470> have<00:03:34.560> to<00:03:34.650> deal<00:03:34.800> with<00:03:35.010> and<00:03:35.160> I<00:03:35.220> hope

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
going to have to deal with and I hope

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.040 
going to have to deal with and I hope
that<00:03:35.610> they<00:03:35.700> can<00:03:35.850> come<00:03:36.030> up<00:03:36.180> with<00:03:36.360> more

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:37.050 
that they can come up with more

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:38.690 
that they can come up with more
culturally<00:03:37.590> sensitive<00:03:37.800> ways<00:03:38.280> to<00:03:38.520> approach

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
culturally sensitive ways to approach

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.880 
culturally sensitive ways to approach
this<00:03:39.000> that<00:03:39.480> don't<00:03:39.690> alienate<00:03:40.230> so<00:03:40.620> many

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
this that don't alienate so many

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:43.790 
this that don't alienate so many
students<00:03:41.370> all<00:03:41.490> at<00:03:41.550> once<00:03:42.060> if<00:03:42.330> you<00:03:42.690> have<00:03:42.960> an<00:03:43.200> idea

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:43.800 
students all at once if you have an idea

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.950 
students all at once if you have an idea
for<00:03:43.890> what<00:03:44.100> could<00:03:44.310> be<00:03:44.370> done<00:03:44.640> to<00:03:44.940> sort<00:03:45.540> of<00:03:45.660> smooth

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:45.960 
for what could be done to sort of smooth

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:47.750 
for what could be done to sort of smooth
the<00:03:46.200> way<00:03:46.320> towards<00:03:46.770> having<00:03:46.980> the<00:03:47.190> security<00:03:47.730> you

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
the way towards having the security you

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.130 
the way towards having the security you
need<00:03:48.000> in<00:03:48.180> terms<00:03:48.330> of<00:03:48.510> making<00:03:48.690> sure<00:03:48.870> that<00:03:49.110> people

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
need in terms of making sure that people

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:50.900 
need in terms of making sure that people
are<00:03:49.410> taking<00:03:49.530> the<00:03:49.770> tests<00:03:50.040> they<00:03:50.430> are<00:03:50.550> the<00:03:50.670> actual

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:52.740 
people they're supposed to be but also

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:55.220 
people they're supposed to be but also
you<00:03:53.190> know<00:03:53.550> dealing<00:03:53.850> with<00:03:54.210> the<00:03:54.720> cultural

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230

you know dealing with the cultural
sensitivity<00:03:55.740> ness<00:03:55.920> is<00:03:56.070> necessary<00:03:56.700> when

sensitivity ness is necessary when
