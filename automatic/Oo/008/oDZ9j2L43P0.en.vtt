00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:17.500
 other definition and definition of amount 

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:20.170
 we will call the amount and we will sell 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:22.150
 a table of trainee all capital 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:24.849
 plus interest 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:28.149
 ie amount is the capital plus 

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:31.920
 game and we will defeat by the letter m 

00:00:28.149 --> 00:00:38.590
 this means that the amount 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:43.510
 will be the capital at most the interest amount is 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:48.100
 capital plus interest is capital plus 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:55.179
 I swear we can now summarize 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:59.909
 in summary it is in summary what we arrived 

00:00:55.179 --> 00:01:08.830
 in review in the network we arrived that interest 

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:18.400
 interest in a unit of time interest in a 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:22.750
 unit of time is expressed as the 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:27.400
 capital times the interest rate in a unit 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:32.920
 of time is the capital times the rate and 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:36.850
 we conclude that the amount is the 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:40.800
 capital but the game then in this moment 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:44.020
 with a few minutes we already have two ways 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:46.660
 in an age time jury of the capital is 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.610
 Chic amount is the most interest capital 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:50.530
 probably the student can tell me 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:54.040
 I know these formulas I ask you 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:56.080
 You know this way you know the 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:58.480
 from above the low index 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.740
 these formulas that you are seeing here 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:03.700
 O 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:07.510
 are forms of formulas or jury SIPS 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:09.940
 compound interest these forms are forms 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:14.650
 of June and simple or forms of interest 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:16.510
 Compound I ask you are you then 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:21.640
 five seconds 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:25.440
 ie ii good 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:27.730
 who answered simple interest formulas 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:32.530
 I missed ugly 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:36.069
 this does not mean simple interest and 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:42.520
 nor compound interest we're talking about 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:46.810
 of non- singular interest in the singular interest 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:49.840
 simple compound interest only exists when 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:54.400
 we go beyond a unit of time 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:59.400
 in a unit of time there is no interest 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:03.370
 there is only interest in a unit of time 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:06.610
 swore in the singular is capital is full 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:10.180
 this is neither simple interest nor interest 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:12.930
 things do not start from 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:16.870
 July said boos start before this 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:19.750
 then I swear in a unit of time is 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.790
 capital times rate in a unit time 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:26.910
 you do not produce interest 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:31.019
 You only produce Interest Interest. 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:31.019
 so let's look at some examples
