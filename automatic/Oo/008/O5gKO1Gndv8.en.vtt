Steve: Hi, it’s Steve from PartSelect. Today,
we’re going to show you how to change the

00:00:03.939 --> 00:00:08.540
injector nozzle on your washer. It’s a pretty
easy job. All we’re going to need is ¼

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:15.010
inch nut driver, a 3/8th socket with an extension,
and a stubby Philips screwdriver. Let me show

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:16.320
you how it’s done.

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.060
Now the first step in this repair will be
to disconnect the appliance from the power

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:28.570
supply, simply pull the plug from the receptacle
and we’re ready to start. Next we need to

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:33.910
remove the front panel using our stubby Philips
screw driver just two screws located about

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:41.450
an inch in from either side, just under that
lip in the front panel.

00:00:41.450 --> 00:01:04.170
We’re just going to grasp the front panel
by the sides and pull it forward at the bottom,

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.079
then we’ll hinge down from the top, you
see there are two spring clips that hold it

00:01:09.079 --> 00:01:24.729
to the top panel, we’ll set that aside.
Now with our 3/8th ratchet we’ll locate

00:01:24.729 --> 00:02:18.879
two bolts just inside the front panel one
on each side.

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:24.299
Now with the two retaining bolts removed we’re
next going to raise the whole top making sure

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:31.400
that the lid is held closed, if your model
has a bleach dispenser on it, we’ll need

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:39.230
to pull that hose off. We just tilt whole
top backwards on its hinges and lower the

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:51.290
lid till it’s in a safe position. And now
we have access to the injector assembly.

00:02:51.290 --> 00:03:04.749
Now there is a clamp that holds that hose
to the valve assembly a ¼ inch hex head screw

00:03:04.749 --> 00:03:18.010
now we’ll loosing that screw partway and
then we will pushing that, if the clamp is

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:24.659
really rusty you need to replace that, so
pick one of those up at local hardware store

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:30.409
or through your appliance spares distributor.

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:46.900
With the hose removed, you can remove the
valve assembly, there is a nozzle inside of

00:03:46.900 --> 00:04:00.650
that rubber valve, simply peel the rubber
valve off of it, and remove it. Insert the

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:07.879
new nozzle into the rubber valve and make
sure that we pull the rubber flange quarter

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:14.069
around and hinge on valve itself.

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:30.590
You just wet that surface a little bit, insert
it back into hose, making sure it doesn’t

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:50.880
fold over, slide that completely into the
valve assembly, re-tighten the clamp, now

00:04:50.880 --> 00:05:05.500
that we’ve secured the clamp, we’re ready
to put the top down, mostly importantly we

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:13.020
will want to make sure that we put the hose
back on the bleach nozzle.

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:36.280
Now we’re ready to put the two 3/8th bolts
back into the top cover, before we tighten

00:05:36.280 --> 00:06:31.879
the first one we’ll insert the second one
and make sure that it lines up properly. Again,

00:06:31.879 --> 00:06:35.920
check that bleach hose, make sure it hasn’t
got loose; and we’re ready to put the front

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:51.210
panel on. Insert the top edge first, with
the panel tilted over in an angle, and with

00:06:51.210 --> 00:07:02.360
upward pressure on the top just swing it into
place. And then we’ll install the two screws,

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:29.690
they go upwards at an angle, and our repair
is complete.

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:34.610
That just how easy it is to change the injector
nozzle on your washer. Thanks for watching,

00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:35.679
and good luck with your repair.
