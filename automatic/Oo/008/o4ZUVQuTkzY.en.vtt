 we have been almost a year 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:40.309
 we started in murals to scatter 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:42.290
 the facade the idea is to try to give it a 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:45.559
 message to young people a message 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:48.589
 positive the murals have a message 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:50.329
 with a phrase a phrase in this case by 

00:00:48.589 --> 00:00:53.179
 example is Maria Teresa Calcutta 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:57.319
 which says that a drop of water makes the 

00:00:53.179 --> 00:01:00.050
 difference of what we are doing 

00:00:57.319 --> 00:01:02.780

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.340
 areas that are dedicated to recreation to 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.229
 education as in the case of the 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.150

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.990

 part of the step initiative is a 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.930
 program in which the companies of the 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:38.210

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:45.230
