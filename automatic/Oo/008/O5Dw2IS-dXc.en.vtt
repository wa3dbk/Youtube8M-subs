learned and developed and still practice
to<00:00:22.000> the<00:00:22.119> state<00:00:22.390> including<00:00:22.869> the<00:00:23.380> molar<00:00:23.680> method

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:24.160 
to the state including the molar method

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.320 
to the state including the molar method
the<00:00:24.760> motions<00:00:25.529> finger<00:00:26.529> control<00:00:26.980> all<00:00:27.520> the<00:00:27.580> grips

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:28.330 
the motions finger control all the grips

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:34.130 
the motions finger control all the grips
and<00:00:28.630> much<00:00:29.110> more

take one of my sticks rest it on top of
my<00:01:27.840> hand<00:01:28.229> it<00:01:28.680> should<00:01:29.070> be<00:01:29.100> level<00:01:29.460> with<00:01:29.610> the

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
my hand it should be level with the

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.609 
my hand it should be level with the
floor<00:01:29.820> at<00:01:30.180> this<00:01:30.330> point<00:01:30.600> now<00:01:31.290> watch<00:01:31.470> what

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
floor at this point now watch what

floor at this point now watch what
happens<00:01:31.740> if<00:01:32.040> i<00:01:32.100> go<00:01:32.220> from<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.490> german<00:01:32.820> grip<00:01:33.030> to

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:33.330 
happens if i go from the german grip to

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.170 
happens if i go from the german grip to
the<00:01:33.420> American<00:01:33.869> grip<00:01:34.050> my<00:01:34.950> hand<00:01:35.250> angle<00:01:35.640> changes

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
the American grip my hand angle changes

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.180 
the American grip my hand angle changes
to<00:01:36.600> a<00:01:36.630> 45<00:01:37.440> degree<00:01:37.800> angle

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:41.190 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:43.740 

so<00:01:42.190> what<00:01:42.550> we<00:01:42.640> started<00:01:42.850> doing<00:01:42.910> to<00:01:43.150> develop<00:01:43.540> my

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:43.750 
so what we started doing to develop my

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.260 
so what we started doing to develop my
fingers<00:01:44.230> I<00:01:44.580> would<00:01:45.580> do<00:01:45.670> this<00:01:45.790> in<00:01:45.910> front<00:01:45.940> of<00:01:46.180> the

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.270 
fingers I would do this in front of the

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.450 
fingers I would do this in front of the
TV<00:01:46.480> sit<00:01:47.230> on<00:01:47.260> the<00:01:47.440> couch<00:01:47.590> put<00:01:47.890> my<00:01:47.980> arm<00:01:48.160> up<00:01:48.220> on<00:01:48.340> an

armrest put on my favorite TV show the

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.980 
armrest put on my favorite TV show the
motions<00:01:57.040> are<00:01:57.250> the<00:01:57.550> secret<00:01:58.030> to<00:01:58.300> great<00:01:58.510> dynamic

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 
motions are the secret to great dynamic

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.470 
motions are the secret to great dynamic
plane<00:01:59.380> they<00:02:00.040> should<00:02:00.220> be<00:02:00.310> practiced<00:02:00.850> to<00:02:01.090> ensure

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:01.480 
plane they should be practiced to ensure

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.540 
plane they should be practiced to ensure
that<00:02:01.720> you<00:02:01.810> have<00:02:01.840> the<00:02:02.020> stick<00:02:02.530> at<00:02:02.980> the<00:02:03.190> correct

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:03.550 
that you have the stick at the correct

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:05.640 
that you have the stick at the correct
height<00:02:03.700> for<00:02:04.510> the<00:02:04.600> dynamic<00:02:04.810> level<00:02:05.410> you<00:02:05.560> are

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:05.650 
height for the dynamic level you are

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:08.249 
height for the dynamic level you are
trying<00:02:05.950> to<00:02:06.070> achieve<00:02:06.660> let's<00:02:07.660> jump<00:02:07.900> into<00:02:08.080> these

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:08.259 
trying to achieve let's jump into these

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:11.280 
trying to achieve let's jump into these
motions<00:02:09.270> the<00:02:10.270> last<00:02:10.540> motion<00:02:10.990> I'd<00:02:11.080> like<00:02:11.200> to

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
motions the last motion I'd like to

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.530 
motions the last motion I'd like to
demonstrate<00:02:11.440> is<00:02:11.980> called<00:02:12.010> the<00:02:12.340> upstroke<00:02:12.850> this

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
demonstrate is called the upstroke this

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.120 
demonstrate is called the upstroke this
one<00:02:13.690> was<00:02:13.840> fun<00:02:14.050> to<00:02:14.170> practice<00:02:14.380> it<00:02:14.800> was<00:02:14.920> kind<00:02:15.100> of

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
one was fun to practice it was kind of

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.460 
one was fun to practice it was kind of
like<00:02:15.220> an<00:02:15.370> illusion<00:02:15.880> stroke<00:02:16.209> because<00:02:16.470> you

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
like an illusion stroke because you

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.520 
like an illusion stroke because you
start<00:02:17.890> low<00:02:18.130> you<00:02:19.030> tap<00:02:19.300> the<00:02:19.480> drum<00:02:19.720> and<00:02:19.959> you

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
start low you tap the drum and you
