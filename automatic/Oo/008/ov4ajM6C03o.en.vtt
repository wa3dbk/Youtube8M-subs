00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:08.240
 That's right, because it's an easy-to-ride type horse 

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:09.460
 Other Well look but it was a feeling that very good Kana at the time if you're start 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.639
 Do you try to go 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:15.180
 1 directly below also but reporters to each get an opinion 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:19.770
 Well I went there so often 

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:24.750
 Naturally I do not think that it is a good form because I got a little bit of high 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:29.400
 Basically the amp is of course something like everything else but once 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.150
 I thought you thought that the solitary king was the largest open last year 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.840
 Of this race 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.760
 It means that buying 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:38.789
 It is pointed so as not to separate too much 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.840
 Even after the pace, I think about the theme 

00:00:38.789 --> 00:00:45.100
 In the end, it became a straight line 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:47.750
 That's right, it's just a good presentation 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:52.510
 Line up early 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:53.880
 Although I aim at an event unexpectedly if I think, it is necessary because after all the other party is necessary 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.240
 Pretty 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:58.860
 I did not speak 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:58.860
 The ingredients are still the same day 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:06.770
 Further level up pace up towards the songs and jbc Tteyuu day to die this 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:10.730
 You are going to go 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:13.159
 Well, that's because the goal is a water mechanic 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:15.370
 I was able to race in the distance so oh 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:18.490
 Since read in a good shape 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:21.940
 If it is in the lubrication to the fray only 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:23.840
 5 won't wait 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:25.720

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.480

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:41.980
