00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 hello good to all I'm maximum we're 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.700
 here a new video of gta 5 the one in a 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.170
 death match that I created only 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.179
 exclusively to test the cars 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.920
 new that in my case I have no money 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.349
 to buy me all or turn the 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.839
 so I created a little game here 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.789
 to test them all with all of you 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.740
 I have not tried it like that I've picked up a couple of 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.689
 cars to see how they were going and such but what 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.060
 that I'll try Libya, I 'm going to see, 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.340
 evaluate them so to speak with all 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.109
 you ale is to say that then for 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.210
 the afternoon or later I'll upload another 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.590
 video in which all the games are 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.090
 you will have the description to be able to play 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.770
 if you want to play them too and try them 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.750
 the vehicles then later upload 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.370
 some of aircraft or golden luxor 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.710
 and the golden helicopter to test 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.690
 see your mobility and it does not make me do 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.660
 illusion to prove it since they are 10 million 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.670
 what the luxor costs and no no I'm not going 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.410
 to buy, that is, I am going to try it 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.120
 I mean half laugh and they are not at all 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.640
 more so well we have here by 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.170
 example the hot class car that does not 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.390
 it looks good but it has not 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.030
 finished liking his handling or anything 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.530
 I think there are nicer cars than this one 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.710
 and good to tell you that it is not tuned 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:07.110
 in none but they also change with their 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:10.290
 respect some others do not change anything 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.180
 of appearance since not in the holy just 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.909
 lets us tune it so we do not have 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.890
 here the engraving that I do not see it very very 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.430
 nice I do not finish liking his 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.470
 inside 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.259
 we have to see it also let's see 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.180
 does not have time this is a windows 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:26.729
 mother manuals mine kid good the 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.530
 normal steering wheel and everything else is 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.270
 simple to see what else we have for 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.060
 here we have this car that class 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.399
 Classical Classics Classical Classics 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.960
 seriously it 's a car that looks like an egg 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:39.030
 behind the truth does not finish me 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.580
 like this car either, so 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.500
 thank God I have not bought it and what 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.670
 only I like are the tubes of 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.750
 escape that everyone has left and 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:51.330
 right is very cool your interior is 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:53.460
 just like the other just that the 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.409
 Windows do not have them from manual I do not know 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.970
 where it is maintained or is it is not 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.920
 can lower the window mother of mine worse 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.840
 you still know it's a very old car 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.759
 only that the door is also cool 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.880
 very much how the kinematics of the 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.770
 doll when it comes and goes 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:11.190
 very managed to see if the 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.390
 door almost not only low good 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.280
 let's see let's see what more cars we have 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.260
 over here we have the super class car 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:19.290
 well we also have another one here that does not 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.420
 I know if this is new or what is exposed here 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:25.480
 because I feel like we exist, I do not think 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:27.730
 that inside also and 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.080
 it's the same as everyone, well, nothing three 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.700
 same cars now let's see the 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.140
 sports car I hope it's not for 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.610
 inside like all the others because 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.420
 then they already asked me to commit suicide 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:39.250
 I will slow suicide falls within 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.920
 baseline is worth at least the 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.150
 interior is like the environment I do not know if 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.700
 having also has the same but 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.080
 he's cool he's cool bad good is 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.330
 say that this car looks a lot like 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.400
 to a ferrari if you see it in red because it 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:52.569
 it looks a lot more in red although this one 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.739
 it's a little more busted because 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:55.120
 tested its speed 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:58.030
 now we're going to lose speed though 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:00.190
 I do not think that surpasses my environment but 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.900
 We will do the test more 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.670
 go ahead since a long time ago 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.010
 that a voice is of speed or of 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:08.319
 shields if I see that you like this guy 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.599
 of videos because today or tomorrow I will upload a 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:12.910
 type of shielding and speed and such 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:14.200
 see which are the most running and 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:16.209
 well we have already taught the cars of 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:19.060
 classes bÃ³lidos we have also taught to 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:20.319
 Classical sports cars and 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.420
 we have also taught the cars 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:25.180
 sports I liked the most with 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:27.670
 relation to paintings and types and 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.829
 personality these are the ones that take 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:31.990
 the palm here I have put all or 

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:33.460
 I've even put so many 

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:36.310
 but each and every one in a way 

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:38.200
 different 4 decade to see what kind of 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:39.490
 textures and colors we see the texture 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.260
 to call it in some way the 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:43.750
 textures are let's say the ways of 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.750
 vehicle and then the color then the color 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.980
 so good the textures these are 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:51.640
 triangular I do not know exactly how they are 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:53.710
 will be iluminatis type I do not know but it has 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:55.810
 very much liked only that not to the hundred 

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:58.390
 per cent the one that I liked a lot is 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:59.710
 this one in green only that is not what 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:02.140
 You will have a thumbnail in the video 

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:04.720
 I guess and is one of the cars more 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:06.600
 I liked with the painting there is a 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:10.300
 little interest and you have given us account 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:12.910
 it turns out that there is a yeti in the mirror 

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:15.160
 in the doors in the textures not in the 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:17.230
 color but in the textures that is like 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:19.810
 hidden is like I do not know showing something 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:21.489
 that nobody knows what the jet is and that it is 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:24.010
 out there hanging around and we still have not 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:26.830
 found good we continue here that 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:28.360
 more we have are these cars that are 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:30.820
 normal currents put 1 decade for 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.810
 that you see the type of colors and such this 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:33.670
 I liked it a lot because it's very 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:35.440
 striking colors 

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:36.700
 I will not go with such a striking car 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.780
 down the street that is to say it did not finish me 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:39.160
 to like a lot 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:40.570
 this one if I liked these 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:44.200
 textures I liked a lot in 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:45.700
 tiger leopard plan or do not know but cool 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:48.100
 very much the yellow has rubbed me 

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:50.800
 very much is very handsome can I 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:52.690
 ask for this car and then we also have 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:55.420
 one that is like a snake has put it 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:56.950
 also golden or I do not know what color is this 

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:58.900
 here you have all the cars all 

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:01.270
 textures types all the all 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:04.830
 new dlc cars looks comfortable you see 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:07.600
 that has everything very luxurious and does not 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:09.580
 bet handsome mola mola so much and I have not 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:11.770
 used to see if the speed also 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:13.480
 It depends very much not only the color 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:15.850
 the outside claims an acceleration and 

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:18.190
 does not have speed because with that then 

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:19.570
 I do not like it that good for aesthetics 

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:21.640
 hesitate with friends, yes 

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:23.440
 It's cool but I do not like the only 

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:26.260
 car that catches me I'll do the safest 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:29.440
 will be the ferrari the car this where is 

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:31.120
 is that this one that is here will be the 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:33.280
 only that I catch all the others as 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:35.830
 advice, I do not know if you have money for 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:37.720
 you catch it if they are not worth nothing 

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:39.490
 honestly so good guys nothing 

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:40.960
 more we will know it in another video in the 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:42.310
 who taught the look 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:44.020
 and nothing else I hope you liked it 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:45.340
 this video life favorites but if not 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:46.960
 you are and see you in the next video 

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:49.229
 Greetings and see you next time
