fact<00:02:28.910> coming<00:02:30.010> okay<00:02:31.750> think<00:02:32.750> about<00:02:32.960> this<00:02:33.260> here's

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
fact coming okay think about this here's

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.660 
fact coming okay think about this here's
a<00:02:34.310> real<00:02:34.580> big<00:02:34.790> twist<00:02:36.190> how<00:02:37.190> would<00:02:37.520> they<00:02:37.640> have

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
a real big twist how would they have

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.460 
a real big twist how would they have
even<00:02:38.060> how<00:02:38.420> would<00:02:38.600> they<00:02:38.690> even<00:02:38.720> have<00:02:39.080> zombie

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
even how would they even have zombie

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.530 
even how would they even have zombie
action<00:02:39.680> figures<00:02:40.160> in<00:02:40.430> the<00:02:40.520> 40s<00:02:40.940> I<00:02:42.220> mean<00:02:43.220> I<00:02:43.550> don't

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
action figures in the 40s I mean I don't

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.380 
action figures in the 40s I mean I don't
I'm<00:02:44.930> not<00:02:45.380> for<00:02:45.710> my<00:02:45.890> knowledge<00:02:46.700> the<00:02:47.000> zombies

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
I'm not for my knowledge the zombies

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.810 
I'm not for my knowledge the zombies
weren't<00:02:47.750> really<00:02:47.900> existent<00:02:48.710> during<00:02:49.250> the<00:02:49.370> 40s

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:49.820 
weren't really existent during the 40s

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:53.170 
weren't really existent during the 40s
in<00:02:50.200> cinema<00:02:51.200> so<00:02:52.100> how<00:02:52.460> would<00:02:52.520> they<00:02:52.760> even<00:02:52.790> have

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
in cinema so how would they even have

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.300 
in cinema so how would they even have
action<00:02:53.690> figures<00:02:54.050> about<00:02:54.320> it<00:02:54.500> my<00:02:54.680> guess<00:02:54.980> is<00:02:55.280> that

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
action figures about it my guess is that

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:03.250 
action figures about it my guess is that
maybe<00:02:56.680> maybe<00:02:57.680> here<00:02:58.510> okay<00:02:59.510> is<00:03:00.460> that<00:03:02.050> the<00:03:03.050> whole

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
maybe maybe here okay is that the whole

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.520 
maybe maybe here okay is that the whole
zombie<00:03:03.500> storyline<00:03:04.250> part<00:03:05.210> of<00:03:05.390> it<00:03:05.540> someone

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
zombie storyline part of it someone

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.880 
zombie storyline part of it someone
existed<00:03:07.600> the<00:03:08.600> actual<00:03:09.020> zombie<00:03:09.050> apocalypse

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:09.890 
existed the actual zombie apocalypse

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:14.140

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.480 
existed and Samantha and Edward bundled
up<00:03:14.240> in<00:03:14.360> the<00:03:14.450> house<00:03:14.600> to<00:03:14.900> be<00:03:15.020> safe<00:03:15.320> and<00:03:15.650> they

kind of you know be busy and kind of

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:26.350 
kind of you know be busy and kind of
make<00:03:25.040> like<00:03:25.070> the<00:03:25.340> worst<00:03:25.550> things<00:03:25.850> out<00:03:26.060> there

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:26.360 
make like the worst things out there

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:29.910 
make like the worst things out there
becomes<00:03:27.140> somewhat<00:03:27.560> fun<00:03:27.860> and<00:03:28.130> controllable

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
becomes somewhat fun and controllable

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.640 
becomes somewhat fun and controllable
controllable<00:03:30.970> so<00:03:31.970> that's<00:03:32.870> the<00:03:33.110> way<00:03:33.230> I<00:03:33.260> could

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
controllable so that's the way I could

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:34.930 
controllable so that's the way I could
possibly<00:03:33.830> look<00:03:34.250> at<00:03:34.430> it<00:03:34.580> that<00:03:34.700> would<00:03:34.790> be<00:03:34.910> a

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:34.940 
possibly look at it that would be a

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:37.150 
possibly look at it that would be a
really<00:03:35.210> cool<00:03:35.540> twist<00:03:35.900> if<00:03:36.170> the<00:03:36.740> zombie

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.160
