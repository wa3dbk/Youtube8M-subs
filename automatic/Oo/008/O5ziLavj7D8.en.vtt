keys<00:03:38.220> to<00:03:38.430> kind<00:03:38.670> of<00:03:38.760> line<00:03:39.060> that<00:03:39.330> up<00:03:39.360> and<00:03:39.660> you<00:03:39.780> can

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
keys to kind of line that up and you can

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.680 
keys to kind of line that up and you can
see<00:03:40.110> right<00:03:40.290> now<00:03:40.320> that<00:03:40.800> it<00:03:41.580> doesn't<00:03:42.060> fit<00:03:42.510> very

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
see right now that it doesn't fit very

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:46.040 
see right now that it doesn't fit very
well<00:03:43.110> so<00:03:43.980> I<00:03:44.010> did<00:03:44.459> a<00:03:44.489> pretty<00:03:44.850> poor<00:03:45.150> job<00:03:45.209> cropping

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:46.050 
well so I did a pretty poor job cropping

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:48.530 
well so I did a pretty poor job cropping
it<00:03:46.170> but<00:03:46.739> just<00:03:46.980> to<00:03:47.160> make<00:03:47.280> this<00:03:47.700> video<00:03:48.120> and<00:03:48.360> not

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540

too<00:03:48.870> lengthy<00:03:49.200> I'm<00:03:49.560> just<00:03:49.800> going<00:03:49.950> to<00:03:50.010> click<00:03:50.220> on

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
too lengthy I'm just going to click on

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.790

and then once again I could go to my
crop<00:04:02.720> and<00:04:03.720> I<00:04:03.810> could<00:04:03.989> crop<00:04:04.290> this<00:04:04.590> kind<00:04:04.920> of<00:04:05.040> into

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
crop and I could crop this kind of into

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:10.430 
crop and I could crop this kind of into
a<00:04:05.340> square<00:04:07.220> oops<00:04:08.220> once<00:04:09.180> again<00:04:09.540> it<00:04:09.750> is<00:04:09.780> doing

getting it a little bit nicer here might

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.529 
getting it a little bit nicer here might
go<00:04:34.319> in<00:04:34.470> here<00:04:34.800> and<00:04:34.919> change<00:04:35.190> this<00:04:35.580> one<00:04:35.849> just<00:04:36.360> a

are using the right right click key

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:52.969 
are using the right right click key
again<00:04:51.240> or<00:04:51.539> on<00:04:51.750> the<00:04:51.900> mouse<00:04:52.080> I'm<00:04:52.620> going<00:04:52.770> to<00:04:52.860> hit

00:04:52.969 --> 00:04:52.979 
again or on the mouse I'm going to hit

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:55.640 
again or on the mouse I'm going to hit
insert<00:04:53.630> there<00:04:54.630> we<00:04:54.750> go<00:04:54.900> we<00:04:55.080> can<00:04:55.110> make<00:04:55.380> this<00:04:55.500> one

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:55.650 
insert there we go we can make this one

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:59.990 
insert there we go we can make this one
a<00:04:55.710> little<00:04:55.860> bit<00:04:56.099> bigger<00:04:57.289> move<00:04:58.289> it<00:04:58.500> some<00:04:59.000> now

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:00.000 
a little bit bigger move it some now

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.520 
a little bit bigger move it some now
like<00:05:00.180> I<00:05:00.300> said<00:05:00.360> this<00:05:00.660> is<00:05:00.810> going<00:05:01.020> to<00:05:01.110> take<00:05:01.289> some

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:01.530 
like I said this is going to take some

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:04.390 
like I said this is going to take some
tweaking<00:05:01.860> make<00:05:02.820> this<00:05:03.000> a<00:05:03.060> little<00:05:03.270> bit<00:05:03.479> bigger

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:04.400 
tweaking make this a little bit bigger

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:09.589 
tweaking make this a little bit bigger
so<00:05:05.400> we<00:05:05.820> just<00:05:06.030> tweak<00:05:06.360> that<00:05:06.630> in<00:05:06.840> here<00:05:08.419> okay

00:05:09.589 --> 00:05:09.599 
so we just tweak that in here okay

00:05:09.599 --> 00:05:12.350 
so we just tweak that in here okay
so<00:05:09.840> we're<00:05:10.410> not<00:05:10.560> doing<00:05:10.830> too<00:05:11.400> bad<00:05:11.759> it<00:05:12.060> could<00:05:12.240> be

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:12.360 
so we're not doing too bad it could be

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.230 
so we're not doing too bad it could be
just<00:05:12.780> a<00:05:12.900> little<00:05:13.020> bit<00:05:13.259> bigger<00:05:13.830> or<00:05:14.490> a<00:05:14.699> little<00:05:15.120> bit

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:15.240 
just a little bit bigger or a little bit

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.589 
just a little bit bigger or a little bit
smaller<00:05:15.660> there<00:05:16.320> we<00:05:16.470> go<00:05:16.620> and<00:05:16.880> then<00:05:17.880> we're<00:05:18.479> going

00:05:18.589 --> 00:05:18.599 
smaller there we go and then we're going

00:05:18.599 --> 00:05:20.570 
smaller there we go and then we're going
to<00:05:18.630> go<00:05:18.780> over<00:05:19.050> to<00:05:19.169> our<00:05:19.199> crop<00:05:19.650> key<00:05:19.949> once<00:05:20.220> again

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:20.580 
to go over to our crop key once again

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:23.089 
to go over to our crop key once again
and<00:05:21.330> pull<00:05:21.539> this<00:05:21.720> one<00:05:21.930> in<00:05:22.139> just<00:05:22.169> a<00:05:22.650> little<00:05:22.919> bit

00:05:23.089 --> 00:05:23.099 
and pull this one in just a little bit

00:05:23.099 --> 00:05:27.879 
and pull this one in just a little bit
let's<00:05:23.940> see<00:05:24.150> how<00:05:24.300> that<00:05:24.360> looks<00:05:25.789> move<00:05:26.789> it<00:05:27.000> just<00:05:27.479> a

00:05:27.879 --> 00:05:27.889 
let's see how that looks move it just a

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:32.659 
let's see how that looks move it just a
little<00:05:28.889> bit<00:05:30.110> that<00:05:31.110> just<00:05:31.530> a<00:05:31.650> little<00:05:31.770> bit<00:05:31.919> with

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:32.669 
little bit that just a little bit with

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:34.999 
little bit that just a little bit with
the<00:05:32.789> arrow<00:05:33.000> keys<00:05:33.449> and<00:05:33.720> as<00:05:34.380> you<00:05:34.560> can<00:05:34.710> see<00:05:34.889> it

00:05:34.999 --> 00:05:35.009 
the arrow keys and as you can see it

00:05:35.009 --> 00:05:37.010 
the arrow keys and as you can see it
kind<00:05:35.250> of<00:05:35.280> makes<00:05:35.490> this<00:05:35.759> cube<00:05:36.120> here<00:05:36.150> to<00:05:36.870> make

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:37.020 
kind of makes this cube here to make

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:38.480 
kind of makes this cube here to make
this<00:05:37.169> a<00:05:37.229> little<00:05:37.409> bit<00:05:37.620> smaller<00:05:37.949> and<00:05:38.190> kind<00:05:38.400> of

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:38.490 
this a little bit smaller and kind of

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:40.790 
this a little bit smaller and kind of
tweak<00:05:38.729> that<00:05:38.940> that<00:05:39.509> is<00:05:39.780> the<00:05:39.990> easiest<00:05:40.500> way<00:05:40.770> to

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:40.800 
tweak that that is the easiest way to

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.879 
tweak that that is the easiest way to
make<00:05:41.130> the<00:05:41.280> cube<00:05:41.580> that<00:05:41.789> is<00:05:42.449> to<00:05:42.659> go<00:05:42.810> over<00:05:43.229> create

00:05:43.879 --> 00:05:43.889 
make the cube that is to go over create

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:47.209 
make the cube that is to go over create
a<00:05:43.919> new<00:05:44.159> slide<00:05:44.340> use<00:05:45.210> reuse<00:05:45.870> slides<00:05:46.229> and<00:05:46.620> then<00:05:47.009> go

00:05:47.209 --> 00:05:47.219 
a new slide use reuse slides and then go

00:05:47.219 --> 00:05:49.040 
a new slide use reuse slides and then go
and<00:05:47.400> find<00:05:47.460> your<00:05:48.270> template<00:05:48.719> that<00:05:48.750> you

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:49.050

going through there changes the picture

00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:52.410 
going through there changes the picture
within<00:06:51.100> the<00:06:51.310> picture<00:06:51.610> frame<00:06:51.880> that's<00:06:52.150> kind<00:06:52.360> of

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:52.420 
within the picture frame that's kind of

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:54.270 
within the picture frame that's kind of
a<00:06:52.510> cool<00:06:52.720> looking<00:06:53.020> effect<00:06:53.380> there<00:06:53.620> maybe<00:06:54.160> a

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:54.280 
a cool looking effect there maybe a

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:56.760 
a cool looking effect there maybe a
little<00:06:54.520> 3d<00:06:54.880> look<00:06:55.300> there<00:06:55.600> then<00:06:56.440> you<00:06:56.530> get<00:06:56.620> the

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:56.770 
little 3d look there then you get the

00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:58.740 
little 3d look there then you get the
little<00:06:56.890> twinkling<00:06:57.460> star<00:06:57.790> lights<00:06:58.030> there<00:06:58.450> and

00:06:58.740 --> 00:06:58.750 
little twinkling star lights there and

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:01.170 
little twinkling star lights there and
then<00:06:59.470> you've<00:06:59.590> got<00:06:59.770> the<00:06:59.920> cube<00:07:00.250> that<00:07:00.520> changes

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:01.180 
then you've got the cube that changes

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:04.890 
then you've got the cube that changes
the<00:07:01.360> the<00:07:01.690> pictures<00:07:02.350> inside<00:07:02.740> the<00:07:02.920> cube<00:07:03.250> and<00:07:03.900> you

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:04.900 
the the pictures inside the cube and you

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:06.660 
the the pictures inside the cube and you
get<00:07:05.050> this<00:07:05.200> weird-looking<00:07:05.800> transition<00:07:06.430> there

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:06.670 
get this weird-looking transition there

00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:10.530 
get this weird-looking transition there
which<00:07:07.420> is<00:07:07.600> kind<00:07:07.810> of<00:07:07.870> cool<00:07:08.080> and<00:07:09.270> then<00:07:10.270> there<00:07:10.420> we

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:10.540 
which is kind of cool and then there we

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:13.470 
which is kind of cool and then there we
go<00:07:10.720> it<00:07:10.960> just<00:07:11.200> zooms<00:07:11.500> up<00:07:11.860> and<00:07:12.190> then<00:07:12.970> another

00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:13.480 
go it just zooms up and then another

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:15.630 
go it just zooms up and then another
picture<00:07:13.990> swaps<00:07:14.290> out<00:07:14.560> with<00:07:14.800> that<00:07:14.920> now<00:07:15.160> not

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:15.640 
picture swaps out with that now not

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:18.480 
picture swaps out with that now not
quite<00:07:15.940> as<00:07:16.090> easy<00:07:16.300> as<00:07:16.630> with<00:07:17.260> keynote<00:07:17.710> but<00:07:18.070> you

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:18.490 
quite as easy as with keynote but you

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:20.880 
quite as easy as with keynote but you
