visit<00:00:33.329> my<00:00:33.480> hand<00:00:33.780> this<00:00:34.620> is<00:00:34.860> where<00:00:35.130> new<00:00:35.969> schools

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
visit my hand this is where new schools

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.569 
visit my hand this is where new schools
you<00:00:37.110> will<00:00:37.230> screw<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:37.739> school<00:00:38.070> and<00:00:38.250> you<00:00:38.340> take<00:00:38.550> a

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
you will screw the school and you take a

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.610 
you will screw the school and you take a
memory<00:00:38.850> cover<00:00:41.030> so<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.750> solution<00:00:43.170> to<00:00:43.200> add<00:00:43.469> our

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
memory cover so the solution to add our

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.889 
memory cover so the solution to add our
to<00:00:43.920> that<00:00:44.070> I<00:00:44.160> had<00:00:44.489> already<00:00:44.730> take<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.420> computer

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
to that I had already take the computer

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.049 
to that I had already take the computer
power<00:00:46.110> so<00:00:46.379> therefore<00:00:46.770> they<00:00:47.280> decide<00:00:47.670> to<00:00:47.700> show

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
power so therefore they decide to show

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.170 
power so therefore they decide to show
you<00:00:48.120> how<00:00:48.450> to<00:00:48.510> do<00:00:48.780> it<00:00:48.960> but<00:00:49.710> once<00:00:50.700> you<00:00:50.789> take<00:00:51.059> the

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
you how to do it but once you take the

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.569 
you how to do it but once you take the
memory<00:00:51.480> cover<00:00:51.870> there's<00:00:52.680> a<00:00:52.829> few<00:00:53.070> more<00:00:53.250> school

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579
