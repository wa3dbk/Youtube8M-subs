00:00:01.689 --> 00:00:06.700
 hi cancer i am going to show you how 

00:00:03.669 --> 00:00:08.920
 make some really good recipes 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:12.549
 serve for all your projects for 

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:15.129
 invitations to tile layouts for 

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:16.900
 cards these recipes are super useful 

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:18.880
 for any project that you 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:22.030
 wish and well let's talk a little 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:24.190
 about the length and width of the strip 

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:27.670
 I'm using a strip this time 

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:30.340
 of 12 inches and I'm using the in a 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:32.619
 width of an inch and a quarter the 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:34.960
 The width of the strip depends on the width 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:38.019
 I want my recipe and it must be to the 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:40.480
 half is to say if I want a rosette 

00:00:38.019 --> 00:00:43.120
 I measured 3 inches because I'm going to do the 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:45.069
 width of 1.5 inches or if I want in 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.809
 this case one of two and a half inches 

00:00:45.069 --> 00:00:49.120
 I'm going to make one of one and a half 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:50.769
 inch I'm giving these tips 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.780
 so that you never have any of 

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:55.210
 those little roses in which maybe the 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:58.089
 paper does not reach you it breaks or stays 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:00.069
 half weird and this kind of thing like that 

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:01.899
 is that well with these 

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:04.330
 with these measures is going to stay super 

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:05.440
 ok but you can do them is to say 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.570
 turn them 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.170
 if you need a wider rosette then 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:10.270
 good to do 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.159
 the longest if we like it is a rosette 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.650
 of those that are not as skinny as 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:16.869
 is that I 'm doing the folds 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:18.970
 to a quarter of an inch and it will stay with 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:20.680
 Folds thin, well, yes 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:23.860
 you want a little bit longer than 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.450
 it would be half an inch or an inch 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:29.259
 well, it would have to be a rosette 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:31.570
 much wider and with a thickness more than 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:34.420
 that is to say you can put thicknesses of 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:36.610
 4 inches or what do I know that depends and 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.250
 Well, these recipes can not be 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:41.710
 Serve to decorate centerpieces and 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:44.289
 etcetera you know that the limit then is 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:47.649
 your creativity and that never ends then 

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:50.170
 well now I'm going to fold one by one 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:52.479
 these doubles is that I previously marked 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:55.330
 but now I'm going to do them in zig zag 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:57.549
 with the fingers with the index fingers and 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.170
 I pass the paper forward and with my 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:01.720
 middle fingers 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:04.420
 I will take the paper up and so on 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:07.509
 I will do it again and again if it is already 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:09.670
 very long the paper and it does not reach you or already 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:11.319
 It's too thick for me to follow 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.569
 holding the same problem 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:15.700
 you can let go of it and keep folding in 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:18.370
 same address so as not to lose this 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:21.040
 pattern and this series and we already have and 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:24.099
 can be perfect very well because 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:27.099
 I have all these folds that mark already 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:30.730
 I have them now well done and I'm going to 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:32.859
 paste our last two dating parties 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.889
 so that they help us make a 

00:02:32.859 --> 00:02:38.169
 circle or to be joined a part and the 

00:02:35.889 --> 00:02:39.700
 another I take this time to tell you 

00:02:38.169 --> 00:02:42.249
 that if you have not subscribed to the channel 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.469
 memorabilia do not wait any longer to do it 

00:02:42.249 --> 00:02:46.389
 because every week we have new 

00:02:44.469 --> 00:02:48.760
 tutorials and tips so that each of 

00:02:46.389 --> 00:02:50.530
 your creations all that he does is a 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.049
 paper and it looks great 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:55.329
 you can improve it if all this video does not 

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:57.669
 forget to give us a like you put that 

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:59.829
 little hand that we like to see so much and 

00:02:57.669 --> 00:03:02.319
 Well, let's go to the step that follows 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:03.879
 next step is to put the silicon to 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:06.519
 that is not going to move our 

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:08.590
 rosette let's flip this way the 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:11.469
 rosette for the side of the one we do not want 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:13.120
 to see is to say if we have maybe 

00:03:11.469 --> 00:03:14.950
 decorative paper, so let's put it 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.540
 from the side we do not want 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.930
 the tie that if we want we will leave it 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:21.580
 down and let's put silicone in 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.830
 a circle I have found that this is 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:26.800
 one of the easiest ways for 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:28.599
 this recipe, do not open and do not leave 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:31.060
 up and strange things that some 

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:35.050
 sometimes it happens to me it seems super easy 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:37.239
 and we're going to put the circle there with the 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:39.390
 silicone once it's well so good 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:42.010
 we can even push in 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:42.819
 these parts and flip without any 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.379
 problem 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:46.540
 It's that easy, you just have to 

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:49.810
 wait approximately 30 seconds in 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:53.099
 what dries the silicone and tanda has already been 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:57.280
 Well, I saved a little bit that 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:59.110
 time and I have it here done once 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.030
 that you have it here on top you can put 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:03.730
 what you want from an adornito 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:05.410
 simple up maybe the name of a 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.480
 person for a party or a 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:10.239
 piercing like this mustache that I 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:12.819
 I put here you can make cupcakes toppers 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:14.799
 or you can use them for invitations 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:15.570
 you can also use them to decorate 

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:19.150
 any 

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:21.190
 card some layout etc. and good 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:23.620
 I have this rosette here because I love you 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:26.230
 exemplify that with a strip of 12 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:28.420
 inches is a little bit just for 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:30.760
 make this other rosette that is a bit 

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:32.800
 wider than my half inch between 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:34.540
 separation and separation this I do not like 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.820
 So much so is that I give a like to the 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:38.140
 on the left side and a dislike to those of 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:40.030
 the one on the right side 

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:41.770
 is not so father so is that good for 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:44.050
 that I made this video so you do not 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:46.750
 come out recipes like the one on the right side 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:48.970
 that while it's not the most horrific thing 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:50.680
 of the world is not so well made is not 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:52.810
 so well achieved is missing a little bit of 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:54.430
 paper and well, these are my 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:56.350
 recommendations to make recipes if 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:59.140
 you have doubts let me know in 

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:00.610
 comments here on youtube and not you 

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:02.500
 forget that we can see ourselves there in 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:04.270
 facebook and I'm sure I'm going to 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:08.400
 answer I send you great regret 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:08.400
 we see in the next video bye bye
