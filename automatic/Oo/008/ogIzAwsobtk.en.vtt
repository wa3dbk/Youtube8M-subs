00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
some of the electronics on board we've

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.380 
some of the electronics on board we've
got<00:01:10.290> an<00:01:10.380> overall<00:01:10.740> volume<00:01:11.130> control<00:01:11.520> we've<00:01:12.210> got

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
got an overall volume control we've got

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.510 
got an overall volume control we've got
a<00:01:12.420> pound<00:01:12.780> selector<00:01:13.620> dial<00:01:13.860> which<00:01:14.130> is<00:01:14.250> really

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
a pound selector dial which is really

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.100 
a pound selector dial which is really
easy<00:01:14.670> to<00:01:14.730> find<00:01:14.790> twelve<00:01:15.240> o'clock<00:01:15.480> so<00:01:15.870> having

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
easy to find twelve o'clock so having

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.900 
easy to find twelve o'clock so having
both<00:01:16.290> pickups<00:01:16.560> on<00:01:16.860> then<00:01:17.550> you've<00:01:17.670> got<00:01:17.790> the

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:17.910 
both pickups on then you've got the

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:19.820 
both pickups on then you've got the
active<00:01:18.450> dials<00:01:18.840> and<00:01:18.990> they<00:01:19.170> are<00:01:19.380> basically

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
active dials and they are basically

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.520 
active dials and they are basically
boost<00:01:20.220> and<00:01:20.520> cut<00:01:20.580> positions<00:01:21.360> for<00:01:21.570> bass<00:01:21.810> middle

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
boost and cut positions for bass middle

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.290 
boost and cut positions for bass middle
and<00:01:22.680> treble<00:01:22.770> so<00:01:23.550> we'll<00:01:23.670> keep<00:01:23.790> everything<00:01:24.000> at

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:24.300 
and treble so we'll keep everything at

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:34.900 
and treble so we'll keep everything at
12<00:01:24.540> o'clock<00:01:24.810> to<00:01:24.990> start<00:01:25.230> with

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:34.910 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:37.190 

okay<00:01:35.910> this<00:01:36.150> time<00:01:36.180> we'll<00:01:36.420> roll<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.720> dial<00:01:36.960> over

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
okay this time we'll roll the dial over

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:44.999 
okay this time we'll roll the dial over
to<00:01:37.500> just<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:38.370> middle<00:01:38.850> pick<00:01:39.000> up

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:45.009 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:54.139 

okay<00:01:46.009> this<00:01:46.250> time<00:01:46.280> the<00:01:46.939> bridge<00:01:47.119> pickle

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.370 

so<00:01:55.149> we'll<00:01:55.240> pop<00:01:55.360> that<00:01:55.420> back<00:01:55.689> at<00:01:55.840> 12<00:01:56.020> o'clock<00:01:56.259> so

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
so we'll pop that back at 12 o'clock so

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.080 
so we'll pop that back at 12 o'clock so
we<00:01:56.439> have<00:01:56.530> got<00:01:56.619> both<00:01:56.799> pickups<00:01:57.130> in<00:01:57.549> operation

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090 
we have got both pickups in operation

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:59.490 
we have got both pickups in operation
and<00:01:58.509> we'll<00:01:58.630> have<00:01:58.810> a<00:01:58.840> look<00:01:58.960> at<00:01:59.079> the<00:01:59.170> active

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500 
and we'll have a look at the active

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.010 
and we'll have a look at the active
controls<00:01:59.979> and<00:02:00.189> first<00:02:00.399> of<00:02:00.549> all<00:02:00.670> will<00:02:01.270> boost<00:02:01.600> the

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 
controls and first of all will boost the

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:14.040 
controls and first of all will boost the
the<00:02:02.380> middle<00:02:12.180> pop<00:02:13.180> that<00:02:13.330> back<00:02:13.510> to<00:02:13.630> 12

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
trouble so obviously there's a massive

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.350 
trouble so obviously there's a massive
range<00:03:09.340> of<00:03:09.519> tones<00:03:09.700> you<00:03:09.819> could<00:03:09.909> get<00:03:10.060> out<00:03:10.090> of<00:03:10.209> it

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360 
range of tones you could get out of it

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:11.910 
range of tones you could get out of it
because<00:03:10.480> you<00:03:10.659> could<00:03:10.780> you<00:03:11.230> know<00:03:11.349> boost<00:03:11.620> one<00:03:11.890> of

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
because you could you know boost one of

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.130 
because you could you know boost one of
the<00:03:12.099> controls<00:03:12.549> and<00:03:12.819> lower<00:03:13.000> another<00:03:13.390> have<00:03:13.989> them

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
the controls and lower another have them

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:15.479 
the controls and lower another have them
at<00:03:14.230> different<00:03:14.560> settings<00:03:14.980> you<00:03:15.099> could<00:03:15.190> change

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:15.489 
at different settings you could change

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:16.890 
at different settings you could change
that<00:03:15.730> pickups<00:03:16.120> as<00:03:16.299> well<00:03:16.480> as<00:03:16.629> you're<00:03:16.780> moving

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
that pickups as well as you're moving

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.960 
that pickups as well as you're moving
around<00:03:17.230> so<00:03:17.829> you<00:03:17.890> could<00:03:18.069> get<00:03:18.159> a<00:03:18.220> massive<00:03:18.640> range

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
around so you could get a massive range
