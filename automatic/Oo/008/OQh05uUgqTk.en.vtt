00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.830
 very good to all welcome to this 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:23.350
 new video and as a pedrito to the started 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:25.770
 that would be a small preview of what 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:28.659
 are the graphics of gta san andreas 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.670
 in that small advance did not show 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:34.240
 all the practical ones showing the ones that 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:37.000
 I liked more and nothing started with 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.799
 the tutorial well let's add the 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.770
 extraction in this video and you will have the 

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:44.549
 link that lead us to remember to jump the 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:46.180
 advertising before downloading the file 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.009
 Good 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:50.770
 once downloaded it will leave us this 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:54.369
 more hd rock the graphics file 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:56.979
 party 2014 well this one we have to 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:59.200
 extract on the desk and leave us this 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:01.170
 folder is called exactly the same as 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.880
 the other 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:07.060
 I recommend having a gta folder 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:08.740
 new to test these files and if 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.539
 we like to introduce it in the new 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:13.629
 gta folder 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:16.150
 well we open our folder of geria 

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:20.549
 we stand aside 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.549
 and we open our our folder 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:27.200
 now we have to open the folder not 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:30.650
 We also open the folder in English and 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:33.210
 the graphics and we drag it inside 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:35.730
 the lightweight folder 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:38.360
 well now we do the same with the 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.360
 other assets 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.810
 as files inside the dad folder 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:54.650
 and we make the files in the folder 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.650
 mobile 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:06.010
 OK once all files are in 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:08.590
 all the folders inside the folder 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:12.310
 from our ugt-a we have to catch these 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:15.300
 two files and put it also inside 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.300
 we place 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:20.700
 we would have what would be our new 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:23.550
 graphic of the gta san andreas and some 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:25.650
 new animations 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:27.840
 these files do not make it go 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:31.440
 slow our goal is very rare that 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:35.940
 I go slow and nothing I hope with the video 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:47.350
 see you in the chao 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:47.350
