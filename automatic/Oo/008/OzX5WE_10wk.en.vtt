00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:20.359 
I think we kept the ball quite well and

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:25.159 
I think we kept the ball quite well and
we<00:04:21.359> dominated<00:04:22.140> the<00:04:22.440> game<00:04:23.330> parts<00:04:24.330> at<00:04:24.630> least<00:04:24.690> in

we dominated the game parts at least in

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:26.390 
we dominated the game parts at least in
the<00:04:25.260> first<00:04:25.380> half<00:04:25.680> and<00:04:25.830> the<00:04:25.890> second<00:04:26.190> half<00:04:26.220> as
