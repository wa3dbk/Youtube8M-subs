00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
rushing can be a bit annoying by I stand

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.700 
rushing can be a bit annoying by I stand
by<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.520> fact<00:00:59.910> that<00:01:00.000> rushing<00:01:00.989> is<00:01:01.109> a<00:01:01.140> lot<00:01:01.410> less

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
by the fact that rushing is a lot less

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.529 
by the fact that rushing is a lot less
annoying<00:01:02.010> than<00:01:02.160> having<00:01:02.520> a<00:01:02.609> fight<00:01:02.820> interrupted

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
annoying than having a fight interrupted

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.990 
annoying than having a fight interrupted
and<00:01:03.799> nowadays<00:01:04.799> rushing<00:01:05.400> is<00:01:05.519> pretty<00:01:05.729> dead

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
and nowadays rushing is pretty dead

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.690 
and nowadays rushing is pretty dead
anyway<00:01:06.360> I<00:01:06.930> was<00:01:07.350> doing<00:01:07.530> max<00:01:07.770> gear<00:01:08.250> double

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
anyway I was doing max gear double

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.280 
anyway I was doing max gear double
crassly<00:01:08.970> rushing<00:01:09.390> earlier<00:01:09.720> so<00:01:09.869> I<00:01:09.900> could<00:01:10.200> have

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
crassly rushing earlier so I could have

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.969 
crassly rushing earlier so I could have
potentially<00:01:10.409> hit<00:01:10.860> double<00:01:11.580> 700s<00:01:12.380> and<00:01:13.380> I

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
potentially hit double 700s and I

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.950 
potentially hit double 700s and I
couldn't<00:01:14.220> like<00:01:14.460> I<00:01:14.670> still<00:01:15.299> can<00:01:15.420> get<00:01:15.570> killed<00:01:15.780> I

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
couldn't like I still can get killed I

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.899 
couldn't like I still can get killed I
would<00:01:16.080> hit<00:01:16.229> insanely<00:01:16.770> hard<00:01:17.220> and<00:01:17.549> still<00:01:17.850> not

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
would hit insanely hard and still not

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.380 
would hit insanely hard and still not
get<00:01:18.090> killed<00:01:18.439> since<00:01:19.439> bonfire<00:01:20.009> I<00:01:20.310> could<00:01:20.850> max<00:01:21.150> out

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
get killed since bonfire I could max out

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.380 
get killed since bonfire I could max out
my<00:01:21.990> damage<00:01:22.830> with<00:01:22.979> double<00:01:23.220> crisi<00:01:23.610> and<00:01:23.790> they

always<00:01:36.750> dying<00:01:37.140> first<00:01:37.560> attempt<00:01:38.100> it's<00:01:38.610> really

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
always dying first attempt it's really

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.030 
always dying first attempt it's really
really<00:01:39.360> not<00:01:39.540> an<00:01:39.689> option<00:01:40.229> anymore<00:01:40.350> unless<00:01:40.740> the

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
really not an option anymore unless the

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.910 
really not an option anymore unless the
people<00:01:41.189> at<00:01:41.460> FK<00:01:41.880> to<00:01:41.939> rush<00:01:42.380> and<00:01:43.380> I<00:01:43.500> do<00:01:43.560> think<00:01:43.860> that
