00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:44.900 
bought the tactical insertion surgeon

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.680 
bought the tactical insertion surgeon
just<00:01:45.900> medium<00:01:46.350> is<00:01:46.470> at<00:01:46.590> or<00:01:46.770> 21<00:01:47.340> semtex<00:01:48.060> this<00:01:48.450> kind

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:48.690 
just medium is at or 21 semtex this kind

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:50.469 
just medium is at or 21 semtex this kind
of<00:01:48.780> works<00:01:48.990> is<00:01:49.140> like<00:01:49.260> a<00:01:49.350> new<00:01:49.500> javelin<00:01:50.130> glitch

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 
of works is like a new javelin glitch

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:52.940 
of works is like a new javelin glitch
it's<00:01:51.479> like<00:01:51.630> once<00:01:51.869> you<00:01:51.990> do<00:01:52.140> this<00:01:52.350> if<00:01:52.649> someone

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
it's like once you do this if someone

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.430 
it's like once you do this if someone

comes up and kills you the grenade

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.469 
comes up and kills you the grenade
explodes<00:01:56.070> so<00:01:56.460> it's<00:01:56.610> kinda<00:01:56.880> like<00:01:56.940> a<00:01:57.090> javelin

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
explodes so it's kinda like a javelin

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:05.600 
explodes so it's kinda like a javelin
glitch<00:01:58.100> little<00:01:59.100> harder

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.510 

switch<00:02:06.390> back<00:02:06.630> to<00:02:06.660> the

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.520 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.580 

and<00:02:09.810> yeah<00:02:10.810> you<00:02:10.930> can<00:02:11.020> use<00:02:11.290> it<00:02:11.320> with<00:02:11.500> the

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
and yeah you can use it with the

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.420 
and yeah you can use it with the
tactical<00:02:12.010> insertion<00:02:12.460> to<00:02:13.950> which<00:02:14.950> works<00:02:15.220> for

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
tactical insertion to which works for

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.309 
tactical insertion to which works for
forwards

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:17.319
