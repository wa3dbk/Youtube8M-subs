 I do not know what this is, 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:33.289
 It's not like that. 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:38.810
 I have to know a little bit about how I will live in the future. 

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:38.810
 I have to meet a good husband 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.900

 We have four weeks and will need to work harder on the five elements within the society and many 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:02:00.770
 There are a few of these five that you will need to meet your husband and do your own. 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:11.370
 It is not right for the person who cares to study it

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:30.060
 This is internationally. 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:31.500
 So, you need to make sure that we study humanities correctly. 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:35.520
 It's possible 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:38.010
 In the future, there will be an era of literature. 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:43.680
 People have to study 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:49.440
 I have to study for humanity and study everything that makes sense. 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:56.820
 It's not that kind of people who live for technology. 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:03:03.060
 Uh, so that I was born this day in the five elements must be the Housewives 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:09.360
 The person who was born as a priest is well equipped with my own eyes. 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:15.420
 That 's how we do our husbands' stuff. 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:20.520
 So I'm going to do something like that. 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:22.650
 Future exchange was doing this I gave it to sleep well give illusion haejundago 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:26.970

 Oh, it's a helper. 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:38.250
 But after I did that, I gave up my whole life for you. 

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:44.010
 Since when did rahan be treated devoted helper life will have its own wrong 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:49.019
 Who is the person who tells the story, who is the wife who will be the wife 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:50.010
 I want to tell you that your wife is your wife, 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:53.240
 I need to know . 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:04:01.510
 Having money's not doeneunge wife 

00:03:53.240 --> 00:04:01.510
 My husband is the third person who lives with a lot of people . 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:08.740
 A man has many people. 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:10.880
 If it's a child, it's up to these people to be wrong and good. 

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:13.880
 It's there. 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:20.890
 I need to know how to do this . 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:20.890
 To do that, we have to study to see the society as a whole. 

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:31.190
 This is a guy who goes out and 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:35.770
 I have the strength to do it, but if I have the strength , there are a lot of people in my week 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:39.080
 This person has to re-examine his life and he has to raise his eyes. 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:41.870
 What is man that you clear key 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:48.800
 That's when you come back. 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:54.380
 When a woman makes a yottae yottae counsel put it well after the study 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:59.900
 She's like this conversation . 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:05:00.920
 Opening the wisdom and giving it back is the way to set it up. 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:05.600
 Without 

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:09.170
 So when we become the boss who became the boss and the boss who became the boss 

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:13.670
 Why do you treat your wife as a wife? 

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:17.420
 It 's called a wife because it's people who live for us . 

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:22.340
 You live well and you are treated like a wife. 

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:27.350
 If you do, you will have a sickness, a hard work, a hard work, 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:33.320
 You have to be huge and I live proudly in its place 

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:35.150

 If you do not play 

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:44.420
 Things that break in the chest will last a lifetime . 

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:49.250
 As the people are sick, so are you. 

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:54.260
 It's like being treated like a sword 

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:57.380
 I do not live for the people, I live for the people below. 

00:05:54.260 --> 00:06:03.110
 If you do not have a lot of hospitality 

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:06.140
 Now inside wont be good enough to receive a treat if a little good. 

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:11.570
 I will get sick . 

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:17.810
 Your family is in trouble and you start to have a sweep of your chest. 

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:18.620
 Why is it that you can not do your job in your seat so many people are having difficulties 

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:21.800
 Thing 

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:27.319
 I'm gonna fall down. 

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:32.899
 Also it suffered mental pain and thus they are always above those difficulties 

00:06:27.319 --> 00:06:35.270
 When I arrived, what did I do for the people I walked with? 

00:06:32.899 --> 00:06:38.719
 I have to think. 

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:43.279
 If you can not think of it, this person is the one who is not the boss, 

00:06:38.719 --> 00:06:49.249
 Because of the hardship and pain in the house. 

00:06:43.279 --> 00:06:52.309
 So I do not get respect, and after all , 

00:06:49.249 --> 00:06:55.129
 You must end it. 

00:06:52.309 --> 00:06:59.389
 So that's why . 

00:06:55.129 --> 00:07:02.959
 Our introductory study is the study of the elders . 

00:06:59.389 --> 00:07:08.389
 Oh, so now you turn it all the way 

00:07:02.959 --> 00:07:09.649

00:07:08.389 --> 00:07:14.199
 Because he's a person. 

00:07:09.649 --> 00:07:14.199
 It will be very good if you turn the direction so
