00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:11.740
 how about writing friends today I 'm going to 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:13.300
 prepare a nougat custard that you will see 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:17.440
 which is very easy to do 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:20.950
 we will need half a liter of milk 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:24.370
 the small brics of liquid cream 4 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:26.320
 eggs 5 tablespoons of sugar and one 

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:29.980
 nougat tablet 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:32.529
 we will start preparing a caramel with 3 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:35.110
 or 4 tablespoons of sugar depends on the 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:37.530
 molds that we want to make and then to 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:40.050
 then we will go doing the others 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.989
 well I have the candy that is being 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.449
 doing in this other case I have put the 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.680
 two 'breaks' of liquid cream that will make 

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:49.110
 I'll add the turn 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.870
 chopped but not all three tablet 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.200
 fourth parts of the tablet we will make a 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.560
 piece to decorate later 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:01:00.260
 we will put it and when it starts 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:03.200
 heat that does not boil it 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:05.690
 we will remove and grind it with the mini 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.170
 first and here I have the milk that was 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:09.800
 warming up 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.540
 to which is hot the 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:15.700
 we'll let it temper a bit to 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.700
 beat it together with the eggs 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.780
 we have 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:22.330
 let's look at the candy 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:25.390
 so 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:27.460
 and now we will start to beat the eggs 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.710
 with sugar 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:32.170
 and we will also add milk 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:34.659
 this plan can also be done very 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:37.320
 easy with the flan I have usually 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:40.140
 prepared on flan 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:45.080
 and it is prepared as indicated by the 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.080
 leaflet and then you add the 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:51.460
 we have that now it was already starting to boil and 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.600
 we prepare it and we crush it with 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:56.750
 ministry 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:59.780
 well I have put the 4 whole eggs 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:02.360
 together with the 5 tablespoons of sugar and 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:06.250
 now we will beat them and then 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.250
 we will add the milk and 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:12.210
 let's hope it's a little cooler and 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:15.360
 we will also mix everything 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:18.610
 I have beaten the eggs and the milk now 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:22.200
 we will be adding wool 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.200
 and we will be mixing it 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:27.120
 and then we will put it on the edges 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:29.490
 and we'll meet him in a bain- marie 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:33.130
 the approximate time of name 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:35.920
 I do not know because they are individual molds 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:38.380
 I think between 10-15 minutes but 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:41.220
 well we will do the skewer test and that 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:41.220
 we will have exact 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:49.790
 well as you can see we already have the 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:53.260
 we have taken cooked plans from 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.800
 for about 25 minutes 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.080
 and five minutes because 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:59.090
 They were a little bit of cooking on everything 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:02.380
 when you put them the year maria try 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.380
 that the water does not boil 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.060
 Thank you 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.580
 we will improve with a little cream 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.580
 mounted 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:27.310
 with the amounts that I have put me have 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.310
 left about 12 puddings 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:32.489
 individual normals 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:34.739
 It depends on the size you to do these 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:37.620
 they can leave more or less plans but what 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:40.579
 What is the individual flanera? 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.579
 left 12 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.080
 with a little bit of whipped cream 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:58.970
 the piece of nougat that I left aside 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:02.350
 Well, we'll put nothing on him a little 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:02.350
 sprinkled and you're 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:19.060
 we have already the plan pointed out I hope that what 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:21.930
 do and you will tell me to see if you like it 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.930
 a greeting
