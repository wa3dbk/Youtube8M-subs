00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
those knots and and you know when you

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.289 
those knots and and you know when you
when<00:01:41.250> you<00:01:41.280> typically<00:01:41.610> glide<00:01:41.939> through<00:01:41.970> them

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
when you typically glide through them

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:43.460 
when you typically glide through them
you<00:01:42.360> don't<00:01:42.509> spend<00:01:42.689> enough<00:01:42.780> time<00:01:42.930> on<00:01:43.110> them<00:01:43.380> to

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
you don't spend enough time on them to

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.440 
you don't spend enough time on them to
actually<00:01:43.649> you<00:01:44.340> know<00:01:44.369> release<00:01:44.820> them<00:01:45.060> and<00:01:45.149> let

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
actually you know release them and let

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.649 
actually you know release them and let
them<00:01:45.479> just<00:01:45.720> you<00:01:45.990> know<00:01:46.340> relax<00:01:47.340> sure<00:01:48.000> and<00:01:48.420> so

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
them just you know relax sure and so

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.450 
them just you know relax sure and so
what<00:01:48.930> we're<00:01:49.049> trying<00:01:49.200> to<00:01:49.290> do<00:01:49.439> here<00:01:49.470> is<00:01:49.770> just<00:01:49.799> get

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
what we're trying to do here is just get

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.889 
what we're trying to do here is just get
him<00:01:50.549> to<00:01:50.640> let<00:01:50.759> go<00:01:50.820> and<00:01:51.119> so<00:01:51.270> we<00:01:51.390> sit<00:01:51.630> on<00:01:51.659> them

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
him to let go and so we sit on them

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.450 
him to let go and so we sit on them
until<00:01:52.110> they<00:01:52.200> do<00:01:52.259> and<00:01:52.710> tell<00:01:52.890> me<00:01:53.040> what<00:01:53.189> kind<00:01:53.340> of

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
until they do and tell me what kind of

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.280 
until they do and tell me what kind of
what<00:01:53.729> kind<00:01:53.790> of<00:01:53.970> degree<00:01:54.149> you<00:01:54.420> have<00:01:54.450> cuz<00:01:54.780> I<00:01:54.869> found

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
what kind of degree you have cuz I found

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.440 
what kind of degree you have cuz I found
this<00:01:55.439> very<00:01:55.649> interesting<00:01:56.329> compared<00:01:57.329> to

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
this very interesting compared to

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.959 
this very interesting compared to
someone<00:01:57.630> who<00:01:57.840> typically<00:01:58.710> does<00:01:58.950> massage<00:01:59.340> my

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
someone who typically does massage my

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.609 
someone who typically does massage my
background<00:02:00.360> is<00:02:00.390> actually<00:02:00.570> biomechanics<00:02:01.439> and

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
background is actually biomechanics and

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:02.870 
background is actually biomechanics and
motor<00:02:02.100> learning<00:02:02.280> which<00:02:02.579> is<00:02:02.700> actually

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
motor learning which is actually

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.550 
motor learning which is actually
reteaching<00:02:03.420> the<00:02:03.630> muscles<00:02:03.960> how<00:02:04.110> to<00:02:04.170> function

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
reteaching the muscles how to function

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.679 
reteaching the muscles how to function
properly<00:02:04.880> I've<00:02:05.880> also<00:02:06.119> been<00:02:06.299> a<00:02:06.360> personal

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
properly I've also been a personal

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.139 
properly I've also been a personal
trainer<00:02:06.899> for<00:02:07.079> 15<00:02:07.380> years<00:02:07.560> and<00:02:07.740> so<00:02:07.890> I<00:02:07.920> work<00:02:08.879> more

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
trainer for 15 years and so I work more

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:09.690 
trainer for 15 years and so I work more
on

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
on

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.520 
on
integrating<00:02:10.479> the<00:02:10.569> entire<00:02:10.810> structure<00:02:11.170> and<00:02:11.410> the

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
integrating the entire structure and the

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.290 
integrating the entire structure and the
muscle<00:02:11.860> and<00:02:12.010> and<00:02:12.250> really<00:02:12.459> trying<00:02:12.670> to<00:02:12.700> restore

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
muscle and and really trying to restore

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.170 
muscle and and really trying to restore
function<00:02:13.900> and<00:02:14.050> form<00:02:14.080> to<00:02:14.470> the<00:02:14.560> body<00:02:15.180> versus

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
function and form to the body versus

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.320 
function and form to the body versus
just<00:02:16.900> trying<00:02:17.200> to<00:02:17.260> relax<00:02:17.349> it<00:02:17.830> and<00:02:18.010> so<00:02:18.670> we<00:02:18.819> tend

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
just trying to relax it and so we tend

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.390 
just trying to relax it and so we tend
to<00:02:19.420> focus<00:02:19.690> more<00:02:20.110> on<00:02:20.140> you<00:02:20.769> know<00:02:20.830> particular

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
to focus more on you know particular

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.369 
to focus more on you know particular
areas<00:02:21.730> of<00:02:21.849> problems<00:02:22.209> rather<00:02:22.510> than<00:02:22.690> work<00:02:23.260> in

00:02:23.369 --> 00:02:23.379 
areas of problems rather than work in

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:24.660 
areas of problems rather than work in
the<00:02:23.470> feet<00:02:23.650> if<00:02:23.830> the<00:02:23.980> neck<00:02:24.129> and<00:02:24.280> shoulders<00:02:24.550> hurt

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
the feet if the neck and shoulders hurt

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:25.770 
the feet if the neck and shoulders hurt
that's<00:02:24.819> what<00:02:24.940> I<00:02:24.970> was<00:02:25.060> going<00:02:25.150> to<00:02:25.209> ask<00:02:25.269> you<00:02:25.480> so

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
that's what I was going to ask you so

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.330 
that's what I was going to ask you so
because<00:02:26.050> it<00:02:26.530> means<00:02:26.739> for<00:02:26.890> someone<00:02:27.160> that<00:02:27.250> has

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
because it means for someone that has

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.839 
because it means for someone that has
back<00:02:27.610> or<00:02:27.790> neck<00:02:27.880> problems<00:02:28.420> or<00:02:28.750> maybe<00:02:29.849> spinal

00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:30.849 
back or neck problems or maybe spinal

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:32.910 
back or neck problems or maybe spinal
spinal<00:02:31.480> issues<00:02:31.840> they<00:02:32.290> would<00:02:32.440> come<00:02:32.650> in<00:02:32.800> and

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
spinal issues they would come in and

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.199 
spinal issues they would come in and
tell<00:02:33.040> you<00:02:33.160> specifically<00:02:33.670> where<00:02:33.910> their<00:02:34.030> pain

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:34.209 
tell you specifically where their pain

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:35.759 
tell you specifically where their pain
is<00:02:34.420> and<00:02:34.569> you<00:02:34.660> would<00:02:34.780> work<00:02:34.959> on<00:02:35.080> them<00:02:35.260> for<00:02:35.500> 30

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:35.769 
is and you would work on them for 30

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:38.190 
is and you would work on them for 30
minutes<00:02:36.069> an<00:02:36.340> hour<00:02:36.459> it<00:02:37.239> really<00:02:37.390> depends<00:02:37.750> most

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
minutes an hour it really depends most

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.020 
minutes an hour it really depends most
problems<00:02:38.680> take<00:02:38.860> 45<00:02:39.280> minutes<00:02:39.459> to<00:02:39.640> an<00:02:39.700> hour<00:02:39.819> but

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
problems take 45 minutes to an hour but

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:41.580 
problems take 45 minutes to an hour but
we<00:02:40.150> do<00:02:40.299> as<00:02:40.420> long<00:02:40.450> as<00:02:40.780> an<00:02:41.049> hour<00:02:41.140> and<00:02:41.290> a<00:02:41.319> half<00:02:41.440> I've

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590

do they have to come back it really
depends<00:02:53.709> on<00:02:53.799> the<00:02:53.860> problem<00:02:54.310> some<00:02:55.060> people<00:02:55.329> can
