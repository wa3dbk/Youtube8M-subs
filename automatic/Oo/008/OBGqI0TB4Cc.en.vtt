00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:04.579 

now<00:00:02.730> the<00:00:03.030> bell<00:00:03.179> system<00:00:03.449> in<00:00:03.570> this<00:00:03.659> game<00:00:03.899> is<00:00:04.140> kind

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
now the bell system in this game is kind

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:06.130 
now the bell system in this game is kind
of<00:00:04.799> like<00:00:04.920> one<00:00:05.130> of<00:00:05.160> those<00:00:05.279> grid-based

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:06.140 
of like one of those grid-based

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:09.620 
of like one of those grid-based
transistor<00:00:07.140> ones<00:00:07.580> but<00:00:08.580> you<00:00:08.639> have<00:00:08.849> a<00:00:09.030> lot<00:00:09.420> more

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
transistor ones but you have a lot more

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.360 
transistor ones but you have a lot more
leniency<00:00:10.290> when<00:00:10.590> it<00:00:10.679> comes<00:00:10.830> to<00:00:10.920> moving<00:00:11.099> around

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
leniency when it comes to moving around

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.280 
leniency when it comes to moving around
it's<00:00:11.639> not<00:00:11.820> just<00:00:12.030> strictly<00:00:12.630> left-right

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
it's not just strictly left-right

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.799 
it's not just strictly left-right
forwards<00:00:13.740> backwards<00:00:13.920> and<00:00:14.309> all<00:00:14.370> that<00:00:14.780> also<00:00:15.780> a

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
forwards backwards and all that also a

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:16.970 
forwards backwards and all that also a
feature<00:00:16.139> that<00:00:16.260> I'm<00:00:16.470> pretty<00:00:16.590> sure<00:00:16.770> a<00:00:16.800> lot<00:00:16.920> of

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
feature that I'm pretty sure a lot of

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.550 
feature that I'm pretty sure a lot of
those<00:00:17.130> games<00:00:17.250> don't<00:00:17.520> have<00:00:17.670> is<00:00:17.820> you<00:00:17.940> can<00:00:18.090> at<00:00:18.240> aim

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:18.560 
those games don't have is you can at aim

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.500 
those games don't have is you can at aim
you<00:00:19.560> don't<00:00:19.710> have<00:00:19.830> to<00:00:19.980> just<00:00:20.490> kind<00:00:20.730> of<00:00:20.850> blindly

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
you don't have to just kind of blindly

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.900 
you don't have to just kind of blindly
attack<00:00:21.779> us<00:00:21.900> in<00:00:22.020> front<00:00:22.199> of<00:00:22.289> you<00:00:22.439> and<00:00:22.619> I<00:00:23.340> find<00:00:23.730> a

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.140 
attack us in front of you and I find a
lot<00:00:24.150> of<00:00:24.210> ways<00:00:24.510> to<00:00:24.539> exploit<00:00:25.080> this<00:00:25.350> so<00:00:25.970> may<00:00:26.970> call

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
lot of ways to exploit this so may call

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.089 
lot of ways to exploit this so may call
me<00:00:27.269> chief<00:00:27.510> but<00:00:27.840> just<00:00:28.410> pleasing<00:00:28.680> the<00:00:28.830> best<00:00:29.010> of

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.530 
me chief but just pleasing the best of
the<00:00:29.160> system<00:00:29.460> I<00:00:29.550> think<00:00:29.789> oh<00:00:32.120> crap<00:00:33.120> stretching

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
the system I think oh crap stretching

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.240 
the system I think oh crap stretching
the<00:00:33.630> Vital<00:00:33.899> Voices<00:00:33.930> off<00:00:34.380> huh<00:00:37.070> they<00:00:38.070> get<00:00:38.219> a

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
the Vital Voices off huh they get a

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.230 
the Vital Voices off huh they get a
little<00:00:38.399> annoying<00:00:38.760> after<00:00:39.030> a<00:00:39.239> while

breaking<00:00:44.020> the<00:00:44.200> fourth<00:00:45.010> wall<00:00:45.100> a<00:00:45.280> little<00:00:45.430> bit

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:45.670 
breaking the fourth wall a little bit

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:54.060 
breaking the fourth wall a little bit
there<00:00:47.220> here<00:00:48.220> I<00:00:48.250> can't<00:00:48.700> move<00:00:50.220> options<00:00:52.770> crap<00:00:53.770> oh

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:54.070 
there here I can't move options crap oh

there here I can't move options crap oh
well<00:00:54.970> we'll<00:00:55.450> just<00:00:55.480> have<00:00:55.600> to<00:00:55.750> bear<00:00:55.900> with<00:00:55.930> it<00:00:56.080> for

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.170 
well we'll just have to bear with it for

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.120 
well we'll just have to bear with it for
this<00:00:56.350> one<00:00:56.530> fight<00:00:58.620> speaking<00:00:59.620> of<00:00:59.710> fighting<00:01:00.070> the

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:00.130 
this one fight speaking of fighting the

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:10.639 
this one fight speaking of fighting the
same<00:01:00.280> foods<00:01:00.490> pretty<00:01:00.670> long

00:01:10.639 --> 00:01:10.649 

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:12.840 

and<00:01:11.649> that's<00:01:11.829> because<00:01:11.979> all<00:01:12.250> your<00:01:12.369> enemies<00:01:12.520> have

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:12.850 
and that's because all your enemies have

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.029 
and that's because all your enemies have
to<00:01:13.030> move<00:01:13.329> and<00:01:13.509> attack<00:01:13.570> too<00:01:14.049> and<00:01:14.920> they're

00:01:15.029 --> 00:01:15.039 
to move and attack too and they're

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:16.830 
to move and attack too and they're
usually<00:01:15.159> quite<00:01:15.640> feeling<00:01:16.149> more<00:01:16.539> of<00:01:16.659> them<00:01:16.810> than

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:16.840 
usually quite feeling more of them than

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.270 
usually quite feeling more of them than
there<00:01:16.990> are<00:01:17.110> of<00:01:17.229> you<00:01:18.329> if<00:01:19.439> now<00:01:20.439> the<00:01:20.590> trick<00:01:20.890> is<00:01:20.920> you

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 
there are of you if now the trick is you

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.950 
there are of you if now the trick is you
behind<00:01:21.640> them<00:01:21.789> in<00:01:21.850> attack<00:01:22.090> it<00:01:22.240> is<00:01:22.360> hard<00:01:22.570> damage

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:22.960 
behind them in attack it is hard damage

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.020 
behind them in attack it is hard damage
if<00:01:23.619> they<00:01:23.770> get<00:01:23.920> behind<00:01:24.189> you<00:01:24.369> go<00:01:24.549> the<00:01:24.670> same<00:01:24.880> thing

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030 
if they get behind you go the same thing

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:30.450 
if they get behind you go the same thing
applies<00:01:25.299> who's<00:01:25.720> first<00:01:29.100> probably<00:01:30.100> must<00:01:30.310> move

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.460 
applies who's first probably must move

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:36.300 
applies who's first probably must move
could<00:01:30.850> it<00:01:30.939> cornered<00:01:32.850> you<00:01:33.850> huh<00:01:34.270> ah<00:01:35.310> critical

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.310 
could it cornered you huh ah critical

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.990 
could it cornered you huh ah critical
hit<00:01:36.340> oh<00:01:36.670> wait<00:01:37.090> no<00:01:38.399> just<00:01:39.399> like<00:01:39.490> the<00:01:39.759> pause

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000 
hit oh wait no just like the pause

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.279 
hit oh wait no just like the pause
because<00:01:40.299> it's<00:01:40.509> not<00:01:40.659> only<00:01:40.840> have<00:01:40.929> these<00:01:41.080> voices

00:01:41.279 --> 00:01:41.289 
because it's not only have these voices

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:44.820 
because it's not only have these voices
off<00:01:41.560> a<00:01:42.689> nice<00:01:43.689> purse<00:01:44.080> little<00:01:44.349> lineup<00:01:44.649> for

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:44.830 
off a nice purse little lineup for

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:51.860 
off a nice purse little lineup for
police<00:01:45.069> weapon

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:51.870 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:56.220 

a<00:01:54.060> good<00:01:55.060> rule<00:01:55.210> of<00:01:55.270> thumb<00:01:55.390> is<00:01:55.720> if<00:01:55.870> you<00:01:55.960> can<00:01:56.080> get

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:56.230 
a good rule of thumb is if you can get

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:58.260 
a good rule of thumb is if you can get
behind<00:01:56.380> them<00:01:56.770> and<00:01:56.980> attack<00:01:57.250> without<00:01:57.430> leaving

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
behind them and attack without leaving

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:59.970 
behind them and attack without leaving
your<00:01:58.390> back<00:01:58.570> up<00:01:58.720> into<00:01:58.870> someone<00:01:59.170> else<00:01:59.320> and<00:01:59.620> go

00:01:59.970 --> 00:01:59.980 
your back up into someone else and go

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:01.620 
your back up into someone else and go
for<00:02:00.250> it<00:02:00.340> but<00:02:00.520> otherwise<00:02:00.790> you<00:02:01.120> just<00:02:01.330> play<00:02:01.600> it

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 
for it but otherwise you just play it

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
for it but otherwise you just play it
safe<00:02:01.870> let's<00:02:02.410> go<00:02:03.870> now<00:02:04.870> that's<00:02:05.050> a<00:02:05.170> critical<00:02:05.440> hit

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:05.650 
safe let's go now that's a critical hit

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:14.250 
safe let's go now that's a critical hit
Oh<00:02:06.330> item<00:02:07.330> drops<00:02:07.570> right<00:02:12.750> they<00:02:13.750> dropped<00:02:13.960> gold
