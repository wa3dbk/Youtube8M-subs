00:03:41.039 --> 00:03:41.049 
then I'm going to take I think this look

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:44.159 
then I'm going to take I think this look
really<00:03:41.439> requires<00:03:42.009> lashes<00:03:42.849> so<00:03:43.389> I'm<00:03:43.689> doing<00:03:44.019> the

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:44.169 
really requires lashes so I'm doing the

00:03:44.169 --> 00:03:47.729 
really requires lashes so I'm doing the
ardell<00:03:45.150> 301<00:03:46.150> lashes<00:03:46.900> it's<00:03:47.229> just<00:03:47.379> a<00:03:47.500> little

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:47.739 
ardell 301 lashes it's just a little

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:51.240 
ardell 301 lashes it's just a little
half<00:03:48.239> wispy<00:03:49.239> little<00:03:49.599> outer<00:03:50.079> corner<00:03:50.590> lash<00:03:50.829> and

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.250 
half wispy little outer corner lash and

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:53.819 
half wispy little outer corner lash and
I<00:03:51.729> think<00:03:51.939> it<00:03:52.060> really<00:03:52.090> needs<00:03:52.599> black<00:03:53.199> eyeliner

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:53.829 
I think it really needs black eyeliner

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:57.509 
I think it really needs black eyeliner
and<00:03:54.220> a<00:03:54.370> winged<00:03:55.000> eyeliner<00:03:55.379> the<00:03:56.379> look<00:03:56.859> is<00:03:57.129> so

00:03:57.509 --> 00:03:57.519 
and a winged eyeliner the look is so

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:02.039 
and a winged eyeliner the look is so
warm<00:03:57.970> and<00:03:58.209> it<00:03:58.389> is<00:03:58.540> like<00:03:59.199> so<00:03:59.829> much<00:04:00.509> like<00:04:01.509> as<00:04:01.810> you

00:04:02.039 --> 00:04:02.049 
warm and it is like so much like as you

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:05.089 
warm and it is like so much like as you
see<00:04:02.259> here<00:04:02.739> but<00:04:03.069> just<00:04:03.250> not<00:04:03.400> this<00:04:03.729> bad<00:04:04.359> looking<00:04:04.900> I

00:04:05.089 --> 00:04:05.099 
see here but just not this bad looking I

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:06.960 
see here but just not this bad looking I
think<00:04:06.099> that<00:04:06.189> it<00:04:06.280> really<00:04:06.310> needs<00:04:06.639> something<00:04:06.939> to

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:06.970 
think that it really needs something to

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:09.390 
think that it really needs something to
grab<00:04:07.239> the<00:04:07.449> look<00:04:07.629> so<00:04:07.959> black<00:04:08.709> eyeliner<00:04:09.069> and

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
grab the look so black eyeliner and

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.280 
grab the look so black eyeliner and
lashes<00:04:09.879> are<00:04:10.030> really<00:04:10.269> needed<00:04:10.629> and<00:04:10.810> then<00:04:11.169> I'm

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.290 
lashes are really needed and then I'm

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:12.899 
lashes are really needed and then I'm
going<00:04:11.409> to<00:04:11.470> apply<00:04:11.859> a<00:04:12.159> really<00:04:12.370> good<00:04:12.639> coat<00:04:12.879> of

color<00:05:32.840> just<00:05:33.200> because<00:05:33.590> the<00:05:33.800> eyes<00:05:33.919> are<00:05:33.950> already

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:34.280

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:37.370 
really warm and I think that adding more

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:39.129 
really warm and I think that adding more
color<00:05:37.610> to<00:05:37.760> the<00:05:37.970> face<00:05:38.300> and<00:05:38.510> there<00:05:38.600> already<00:05:38.870> is

00:05:39.129 --> 00:05:39.139 
color to the face and there already is

00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:41.830 
color to the face and there already is
is<00:05:39.410> going<00:05:39.919> to<00:05:40.100> detract<00:05:40.669> from<00:05:40.850> the<00:05:41.060> eyes<00:05:41.300> and

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:41.840 
is going to detract from the eyes and

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:43.540 
is going to detract from the eyes and
have<00:05:42.380> way<00:05:42.530> too<00:05:42.590> much<00:05:42.740> going<00:05:42.889> on<00:05:43.040> to<00:05:43.250> the<00:05:43.340> face
