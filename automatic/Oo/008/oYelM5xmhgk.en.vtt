fantastic option for somebody who wants

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.740 
fantastic option for somebody who wants
to<00:01:13.650> go<00:01:13.799> out<00:01:13.979> and<00:01:14.159> be<00:01:14.250> social<00:01:14.460> I<00:01:14.909> don't<00:01:15.570> think

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
to go out and be social I don't think

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.210 
to go out and be social I don't think
you<00:01:15.810> should<00:01:15.960> be<00:01:16.110> scared<00:01:16.439> of<00:01:16.560> restaurants<00:01:17.070> if

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
you should be scared of restaurants if

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.469 
you should be scared of restaurants if
you're<00:01:17.670> just<00:01:17.880> starting<00:01:18.060> out<00:01:18.299> in

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
you're just starting out in

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.359 
you're just starting out in
fruitarianism<00:01:19.080> or<00:01:19.320> a<00:01:19.350> raw<00:01:19.530> food<00:01:19.799> diet<00:01:19.830> I<00:01:20.189> think

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
fruitarianism or a raw food diet I think

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.149 
fruitarianism or a raw food diet I think
you<00:01:20.460> should<00:01:20.610> avoid<00:01:20.880> restaurants<00:01:21.570> initially

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:22.159 
you should avoid restaurants initially

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:24.800 
you should avoid restaurants initially
because<00:01:23.159> some<00:01:23.759> people<00:01:24.030> really<00:01:24.060> have<00:01:24.509> a<00:01:24.780> hard

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
because some people really have a hard

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.340 
because some people really have a hard
time<00:01:25.170> saying<00:01:25.380> no<00:01:25.530> to<00:01:26.360> smelling<00:01:27.360> good<00:01:27.810> cooked

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
time saying no to smelling good cooked

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.300 
time saying no to smelling good cooked
foods<00:01:28.650> that<00:01:29.630> they<00:01:30.630> love<00:01:30.960> so<00:01:31.590> it's<00:01:32.040> probably

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
foods that they love so it's probably

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.940 
foods that they love so it's probably
not<00:01:32.460> a<00:01:32.490> good<00:01:32.700> idea<00:01:32.880> initially<00:01:33.860> starting<00:01:34.860> out

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
not a good idea initially starting out

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.399 
not a good idea initially starting out
in<00:01:35.220> fruitarianism<00:01:35.939> or<00:01:36.270> a<00:01:36.360> raw<00:01:36.509> food<00:01:36.780> diet<00:01:36.810> to

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
in fruitarianism or a raw food diet to

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.770 
in fruitarianism or a raw food diet to
go<00:01:37.560> to<00:01:37.650> restaurants<00:01:38.130> but<00:01:38.430> don't<00:01:38.970> think<00:01:39.659> that

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
go to restaurants but don't think that

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:40.999 
go to restaurants but don't think that
you<00:01:39.869> can<00:01:40.020> never<00:01:40.200> go<00:01:40.409> to<00:01:40.470> another<00:01:40.680> restaurant

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
you can never go to another restaurant

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.550 
you can never go to another restaurant
