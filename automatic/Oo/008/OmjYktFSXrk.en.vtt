00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
question I've never thought about that

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.270 
question I've never thought about that
if<00:03:01.780> you<00:03:01.960> actually<00:03:02.140> pay<00:03:02.440> close<00:03:02.770> attention<00:03:03.250> to

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
if you actually pay close attention to

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.050 
if you actually pay close attention to
think<00:03:03.610> about<00:03:03.850> it<00:03:04.030> in<00:03:04.210> the<00:03:04.720> game<00:03:05.290> I<00:03:06.060> technically

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
think about it in the game I technically

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.420 
think about it in the game I technically
gives<00:03:07.420> aunt<00:03:07.750> powers<00:03:08.620> which<00:03:08.800> make<00:03:09.100> them<00:03:09.250> you

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
gives aunt powers which make them you

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.580 
gives aunt powers which make them you
know<00:03:09.610> really<00:03:10.210> powerful<00:03:10.810> to<00:03:10.960> be<00:03:10.990> able<00:03:11.170> like<00:03:11.320> you

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
know really powerful to be able like you

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:12.900 
know really powerful to be able like you
know<00:03:11.680> make<00:03:11.860> the<00:03:11.980> world<00:03:12.190> to<00:03:12.310> toilet<00:03:12.760> and

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
know make the world to toilet and

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.330 
know make the world to toilet and
whatnot<00:03:13.390> so<00:03:13.600> technically<00:03:14.410> I<00:03:14.530> could<00:03:14.950> take<00:03:15.130> the

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
whatnot so technically I could take the

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.910 
whatnot so technically I could take the
way<00:03:15.490> take<00:03:16.390> away<00:03:16.630> his<00:03:16.810> power<00:03:17.110> if<00:03:17.320> I<00:03:17.470> wanted<00:03:17.770> to

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
way take away his power if I wanted to

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.670 
way take away his power if I wanted to
so<00:03:18.100> i<00:03:18.130> would<00:03:18.520> say<00:03:18.670> i'm<00:03:18.850> strong<00:03:19.240> than<00:03:19.450> him<00:03:19.680> but

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
so i would say i'm strong than him but

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.080 
so i would say i'm strong than him but
you<00:03:20.830> know<00:03:20.890> he's<00:03:21.070> got<00:03:21.220> those<00:03:21.430> like<00:03:21.670> fancy

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 
swords and stuff and he ended up killing

swords and stuff and he ended up killing
me<00:03:23.830> at<00:03:24.010> the<00:03:24.220> end<00:03:24.340> so<00:03:24.880> i<00:03:25.300> don't<00:03:26.230> know<00:03:26.380> i'd<00:03:26.590> have
