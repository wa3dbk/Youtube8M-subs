all but I think we need to move fat away
from<00:02:05.619> being<00:02:05.830> an<00:02:05.920> F<00:02:06.100> word<00:02:06.400> that<00:02:06.610> we<00:02:06.729> never

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
from being an F word that we never

from being an F word that we never
talked<00:02:07.299> about<00:02:07.479> I<00:02:07.630> think<00:02:07.810> we<00:02:08.049> need<00:02:08.200> to<00:02:08.259> discuss

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
talked about I think we need to discuss

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:09.960 
talked about I think we need to discuss
it<00:02:08.769> with<00:02:08.860> our<00:02:09.009> children<00:02:09.369> and<00:02:09.489> we<00:02:09.580> need<00:02:09.729> to<00:02:09.819> say

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
it with our children and we need to say

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:11.970 
it with our children and we need to say
things<00:02:10.179> like<00:02:10.330> if<00:02:10.810> you<00:02:10.989> eat<00:02:11.170> healthy<00:02:11.529> food<00:02:11.769> then

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
things like if you eat healthy food then

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.600 
things like if you eat healthy food then
you<00:02:12.129> won't<00:02:12.340> be<00:02:12.459> overweight

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
you won't be overweight

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.670 
you won't be overweight
and<00:02:13.730> I<00:02:13.970> also<00:02:14.150> think<00:02:14.540> that<00:02:14.660> parents<00:02:15.230> are<00:02:15.350> to

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
and I also think that parents are to

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.590 
and I also think that parents are to
blame<00:02:15.890> I<00:02:16.220> mean<00:02:16.490> the<00:02:16.910> parents<00:02:17.330> are<00:02:17.390> the<00:02:17.480> ones

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
blame I mean the parents are the ones

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.210 
blame I mean the parents are the ones
who<00:02:17.780> are<00:02:17.930> making<00:02:18.260> their<00:02:18.380> children<00:02:18.770> fan<00:02:19.040> and

who are making their children fan and

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.070 
who are making their children fan and
it's<00:02:19.340> akin<00:02:19.670> to<00:02:19.700> child<00:02:20.150> abuse<00:02:20.300> to<00:02:20.690> be<00:02:20.780> fattening

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
it's akin to child abuse to be fattening

know being chubby people having a good
time<00:05:11.400> that's<00:05:11.790> right<00:05:11.910> i<00:05:11.970> think<00:05:12.240> it's<00:05:12.330> a

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:12.390 
time that's right i think it's a

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:14.600 
time that's right i think it's a
breakthrough<00:05:12.690> we<00:05:13.080> tend<00:05:13.350> to<00:05:13.440> have<00:05:13.620> fat<00:05:14.190> people

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:14.610 
breakthrough we tend to have fat people

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:16.550 
breakthrough we tend to have fat people
on<00:05:14.730> the<00:05:14.850> telly<00:05:15.180> where<00:05:15.870> we<00:05:16.020> want<00:05:16.200> them<00:05:16.260> to<00:05:16.410> lose

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:16.560 
on the telly where we want them to lose

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:18.110 
on the telly where we want them to lose
weight<00:05:16.890> like<00:05:17.130> shows<00:05:17.400> like<00:05:17.520> The<00:05:17.790> Biggest<00:05:17.970> Loser

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.120 
weight like shows like The Biggest Loser

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:19.970 
weight like shows like The Biggest Loser
I<00:05:18.600> think<00:05:18.810> this<00:05:18.870> show<00:05:19.080> is<00:05:19.110> phenomenal<00:05:19.830> because

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:19.980 
I think this show is phenomenal because

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:22.430 
I think this show is phenomenal because
we<00:05:20.220> see<00:05:20.400> the<00:05:20.520> complexity<00:05:21.270> of<00:05:21.300> big<00:05:21.600> people<00:05:21.870> we

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:22.440 
we see the complexity of big people we

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:24.020 
we see the complexity of big people we
don't<00:05:22.560> also<00:05:22.740> see<00:05:22.980> big<00:05:23.190> people<00:05:23.490> kissing<00:05:23.790> on

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:24.030 
don't also see big people kissing on

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:25.280 
don't also see big people kissing on
television<00:05:24.600> or<00:05:24.720> seeing<00:05:24.990> all<00:05:25.140> the<00:05:25.260> different

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:25.290 
television or seeing all the different

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:27.500 
television or seeing all the different
nuances<00:05:26.160> of<00:05:26.220> their<00:05:26.490> lives<00:05:26.790> I<00:05:27.150> think<00:05:27.390> it's

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:27.510 
nuances of their lives I think it's

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:29.510 
nuances of their lives I think it's
absolutely<00:05:27.630> brilliant<00:05:28.230> mmm<00:05:29.010> yeah<00:05:29.310> I<00:05:29.340> agree

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:29.520 
absolutely brilliant mmm yeah I agree

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.340 
absolutely brilliant mmm yeah I agree
and<00:05:30.090> I<00:05:30.240> think<00:05:30.270> it<00:05:30.540> is<00:05:30.570> really<00:05:30.840> important<00:05:31.320> that

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:31.350 
and I think it is really important that

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:33.320 
and I think it is really important that
we<00:05:31.560> offer<00:05:31.740> diversity<00:05:32.490> because<00:05:32.910> we<00:05:33.150> are<00:05:33.300> a

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:33.330 
we offer diversity because we are a

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:36.230 
we offer diversity because we are a
diverse<00:05:33.750> nation<00:05:34.260> of<00:05:34.380> people<00:05:34.590> body<00:05:35.460> size<00:05:35.790> isn't

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:36.240 
diverse nation of people body size isn't

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.120 
diverse nation of people body size isn't
necessarily<00:05:36.780> indication<00:05:37.410> of<00:05:37.500> good<00:05:37.680> health<00:05:37.860> or

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:38.130 
necessarily indication of good health or

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:40.130 
necessarily indication of good health or
emotional<00:05:38.669> health<00:05:38.820> either<00:05:39.090> yeah<00:05:39.780> I'm<00:05:40.020> not

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:40.140 
emotional health either yeah I'm not

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:42.110 
emotional health either yeah I'm not
completely<00:05:40.440> convinced<00:05:40.590> but<00:05:41.340> that<00:05:41.400> Daniel<00:05:41.970> I

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:42.120 
completely convinced but that Daniel I

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.480 
completely convinced but that Daniel I
think<00:05:42.900> the<00:05:43.080> the<00:05:43.380> health<00:05:43.590> issue<00:05:43.830> should<00:05:44.010> always

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:44.490 
think the the health issue should always

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:46.340 
think the the health issue should always
be<00:05:44.640> tied<00:05:44.850> up<00:05:45.030> with<00:05:45.210> with<00:05:45.630> size<00:05:45.840> and<00:05:46.080> I<00:05:46.110> think

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:46.350 
be tied up with with size and I think

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:48.020 
be tied up with with size and I think
obesity<00:05:46.830> is<00:05:46.950> going<00:05:47.250> to<00:05:47.340> be<00:05:47.430> one<00:05:47.580> of<00:05:47.610> the<00:05:47.790> the

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:48.030 
obesity is going to be one of the the

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:50.780 
obesity is going to be one of the the
epidemic<00:05:48.540> issues<00:05:49.290> along<00:05:49.560> with<00:05:49.710> diabetes<00:05:50.130> in

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:50.790 
epidemic issues along with diabetes in
