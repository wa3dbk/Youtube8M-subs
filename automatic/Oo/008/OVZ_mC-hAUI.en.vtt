00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
distant trees using my favorite medium

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.269 
distant trees using my favorite medium
artisan<00:00:14.340> water<00:00:14.700> mix<00:00:15.030> of<00:00:15.179> oils<00:00:15.599> and<00:00:15.980> to<00:00:16.980> start

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
artisan water mix of oils and to start

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.970 
artisan water mix of oils and to start
off<00:00:17.520> with<00:00:17.789> I'm<00:00:18.390> gonna<00:00:18.690> make<00:00:19.260> up<00:00:19.470> a<00:00:19.619> shadow

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
off with I'm gonna make up a shadow

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.650 
off with I'm gonna make up a shadow
color<00:00:20.400> which<00:00:21.210> is<00:00:21.750> very<00:00:22.170> dark<00:00:22.619> and<00:00:22.970> I'm<00:00:23.970> using

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
color which is very dark and I'm using

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:25.849 
color which is very dark and I'm using
cobalt<00:00:25.320> blue

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
cobalt blue

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:32.420 
cobalt blue
it's<00:00:26.550> Payne's<00:00:26.880> gray<00:00:28.849> cadmium<00:00:29.849> yellow<00:00:29.880> and<00:00:31.430> to

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
it's Payne's gray cadmium yellow and to

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.580 
it's Payne's gray cadmium yellow and to
make<00:00:32.610> it<00:00:32.640> slightly<00:00:33.059> earthy<00:00:33.690> I'm<00:00:33.989> gonna<00:00:34.320> use<00:00:34.559> a

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
make it slightly earthy I'm gonna use a

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.299 
make it slightly earthy I'm gonna use a
little<00:00:34.950> raw<00:00:35.250> umber<00:00:36.350> right<00:00:37.350> so<00:00:37.980> I've<00:00:38.070> got<00:00:38.190> the

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
little raw umber right so I've got the

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.200 
little raw umber right so I've got the
mix<00:00:38.550> ready<00:00:38.850> now

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:41.210 
mix ready now

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.229 
mix ready now
and<00:00:42.290> the<00:00:43.290> technique<00:00:43.829> really<00:00:44.160> is<00:00:44.520> about<00:00:44.700> brush

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
and the technique really is about brush

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.350 
and the technique really is about brush
handling<00:00:45.870> rather<00:00:46.140> than<00:00:46.640> painting<00:00:47.640> when<00:00:48.270> you

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
handling rather than painting when you

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.389 
handling rather than painting when you
talk<00:00:48.629> to<00:00:48.780> people<00:00:48.960> about<00:00:49.170> painting<00:00:49.890> you<00:00:50.100> tend

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
talk to people about painting you tend

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.470 
talk to people about painting you tend
to<00:00:50.489> sort<00:00:50.820> of<00:00:50.969> think<00:00:51.180> about<00:00:51.320> strokes<00:00:52.340> well<00:00:53.480> with

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
to sort of think about strokes well with

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.770 
to sort of think about strokes well with
oil<00:00:54.660> painting<00:00:55.350> particularly<00:00:55.969> a<00:00:56.969> lot<00:00:57.510> of<00:00:57.539> the

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
oil painting particularly a lot of the

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.119 
oil painting particularly a lot of the
technique<00:00:58.440> is<00:00:59.539> just<00:01:00.539> pushing<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.230> brush<00:01:01.500> it's

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
technique is just pushing the brush it's

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.039 
technique is just pushing the brush it's
not<00:01:02.250> actually<00:01:02.670> building<00:01:02.910> strokes<00:01:03.510> so<00:01:03.809> I'm

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
not actually building strokes so I'm

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.210 
not actually building strokes so I'm
just<00:01:04.290> gonna<00:01:04.439> a<00:01:04.769> little<00:01:05.189> bit<00:01:05.460> further<00:01:05.850> along

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:07.220 
just gonna a little bit further along

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.800 
just gonna a little bit further along
keeping<00:01:08.220> a<00:01:08.340> broken<00:01:08.820> edge<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.210> shadows<00:01:09.600> in

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
keeping a broken edge the shadows in

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.330 
keeping a broken edge the shadows in
trees<00:01:10.200> mainly<00:01:11.600> caused<00:01:12.600> by<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:13.070> branches<00:01:14.070> so

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
trees mainly caused by the branches so

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.399 
trees mainly caused by the branches so
the<00:01:15.090> lower<00:01:15.270> part<00:01:15.600> of<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:15.780> trees<00:01:16.020> are<00:01:16.200> usually

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
the lower part of the trees are usually

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.490 
the lower part of the trees are usually
in<00:01:16.979> a<00:01:17.070> little<00:01:17.520> more<00:01:17.670> shadow<00:01:18.049> so<00:01:19.049> there's<00:01:19.259> the

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
in a little more shadow so there's the

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.420 
in a little more shadow so there's the
the<00:01:20.150> shadow<00:01:21.150> color<00:01:21.770> I'm<00:01:22.770> going<00:01:22.920> to<00:01:22.979> introduce

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
the shadow color I'm going to introduce

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.149 
the shadow color I'm going to introduce
now<00:01:23.729> to<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.210> mix<00:01:24.450> without<00:01:24.659> making<00:01:25.500> a<00:01:25.560> new<00:01:25.799> mix

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
now to the mix without making a new mix

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.070 
now to the mix without making a new mix
but<00:01:26.790> I'm<00:01:26.880> going<00:01:27.030> to<00:01:27.060> take<00:01:27.270> some<00:01:27.479> more<00:01:27.570> cadmium

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
but I'm going to take some more cadmium

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.010 
but I'm going to take some more cadmium
yellow<00:01:28.110> and<00:01:29.100> put<00:01:29.880> it<00:01:29.970> into<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.360> side<00:01:30.630> of<00:01:30.659> the

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
yellow and put it into the side of the

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.210 
yellow and put it into the side of the
mix<00:01:32.630> quite<00:01:33.630> a<00:01:33.689> nice<00:01:33.840> green<00:01:34.110> that's<00:01:34.380> so<00:01:34.650> and<00:01:35.130> we

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
mix quite a nice green that's so and we

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.219 
mix quite a nice green that's so and we
do<00:01:35.400> now<00:01:35.610> is<00:01:35.880> go<00:01:36.150> in<00:01:36.299> with<00:01:36.329> a<00:01:36.479> second<00:01:36.930> stage

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
do now is go in with a second stage

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.520 
do now is go in with a second stage
which<00:01:38.189> is<00:01:38.520> to<00:01:39.299> not<00:01:39.659> put<00:01:39.869> in<00:01:39.930> hot<00:01:40.110> this<00:01:40.229> isn't

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
which is to not put in hot this isn't

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.350 
which is to not put in hot this isn't
the<00:01:40.590> highlight<00:01:41.009> stage<00:01:41.400> this<00:01:41.820> is<00:01:41.880> just

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
the highlight stage this is just

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.889 
the highlight stage this is just
building<00:01:42.840> up<00:01:43.020> a<00:01:43.200> little<00:01:44.270> extra<00:01:45.270> color<00:01:45.509> a

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
building up a little extra color a

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.929 
building up a little extra color a
different<00:01:47.450> color<00:01:48.450> so<00:01:48.930> again<00:01:49.140> I'm<00:01:49.799> pushing<00:01:50.790> the

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
different color so again I'm pushing the

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.289 
different color so again I'm pushing the
brush<00:01:51.180> slightly<00:01:51.450> out<00:01:52.790> that<00:01:53.790> way<00:01:53.970> to<00:01:54.030> give<00:01:54.270> a

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
brush slightly out that way to give a

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.450 
brush slightly out that way to give a
broken<00:01:54.899> top<00:01:55.259> using<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:55.829> texture<00:01:56.219> of<00:01:56.310> the

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
broken top using the texture of the

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.410 
broken top using the texture of the
canvas<00:01:57.259> to<00:01:58.259> help<00:01:58.290> create<00:01:58.799> the<00:01:59.490> effect<00:02:00.240> the

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
canvas to help create the effect the

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.289 
canvas to help create the effect the
illusion<00:02:01.020> of<00:02:01.399> lots<00:02:02.399> of<00:02:02.549> branches<00:02:03.090> and<00:02:03.119> leaves

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
illusion of lots of branches and leaves

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.980 
illusion of lots of branches and leaves
so<00:02:04.290> picking<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:04.920> paint<00:02:05.250> up<00:02:05.549> and<00:02:05.909> I'm<00:02:06.329> pushing

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
so picking the paint up and I'm pushing

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.570 
so picking the paint up and I'm pushing
the<00:02:07.469> paint<00:02:07.680> into<00:02:07.950> the<00:02:08.069> brush<00:02:08.280> and<00:02:08.459> just

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
the paint into the brush and just

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.240 
the paint into the brush and just
rolling<00:02:09.149> it<00:02:09.239> slightly<00:02:09.479> as<00:02:09.750> I<00:02:09.869> do<00:02:09.929> so<00:02:10.319> just<00:02:11.160> to

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
rolling it slightly as I do so just to

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.949 
rolling it slightly as I do so just to
get<00:02:11.400> some<00:02:11.580> paint<00:02:11.879> around<00:02:12.239> the<00:02:12.450> tip<00:02:12.629> and<00:02:12.870> on

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
get some paint around the tip and on

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:13.460 
get some paint around the tip and on
this

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
this

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.230 
this
just<00:02:13.890> around<00:02:14.070> the<00:02:14.250> side<00:02:14.490> a<00:02:14.520> bit<00:02:14.760> so<00:02:14.970> that<00:02:15.120> you

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
just around the side a bit so that you

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:21.560 
just around the side a bit so that you
can<00:02:15.450> dab<00:02:16.140> it<00:02:16.350> on<00:02:18.500> just<00:02:19.500> touching<00:02:20.190> it<00:02:20.370> softly<00:02:21.270> on

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
can dab it on just touching it softly on

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:23.590 
can dab it on just touching it softly on
the<00:02:21.900> top<00:02:22.110> there<00:02:22.290> to<00:02:22.350> get<00:02:22.470> that<00:02:22.530> broken<00:02:22.890> effect

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.600 
the top there to get that broken effect

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.200 
the top there to get that broken effect
right<00:02:24.600> that<00:02:25.320> brush<00:02:25.530> down<00:02:25.800> now<00:02:26.040> and<00:02:26.280> switch<00:02:27.000> to

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.210 
right that brush down now and switch to

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.780 
right that brush down now and switch to
a<00:02:27.240> smaller<00:02:27.540> one<00:02:27.900> and<00:02:28.320> here<00:02:29.070> I'm<00:02:29.310> going<00:02:29.580> for<00:02:29.760> a

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
a smaller one and here I'm going for a

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.290 
a smaller one and here I'm going for a
third<00:02:30.150> color<00:02:30.510> which<00:02:31.110> again<00:02:31.890> if<00:02:32.460> I<00:02:32.670> work<00:02:32.970> into

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
third color which again if I work into

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.060 
third color which again if I work into
the<00:02:33.390> side<00:02:33.630> of<00:02:33.660> that<00:02:33.870> color<00:02:34.200> I<00:02:34.320> still<00:02:34.680> got<00:02:34.920> the

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
the side of that color I still got the

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.040 
the side of that color I still got the
three<00:02:35.280> colors<00:02:35.670> that<00:02:35.880> I<00:02:35.910> started<00:02:36.570> you<00:02:36.720> know<00:02:36.750> the

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
three colors that I started you know the

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.640 
three colors that I started you know the
the<00:02:37.980> first<00:02:38.250> shadow<00:02:38.580> color<00:02:38.910> of<00:02:39.060> the<00:02:39.180> second

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
the first shadow color of the second

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.730 
the first shadow color of the second
color<00:02:41.060> this<00:02:42.060> is<00:02:42.450> the<00:02:42.960> first<00:02:43.260> sort<00:02:43.680> of

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:43.740 
color this is the first sort of

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:45.860 
color this is the first sort of
highlighting<00:02:44.400> color<00:02:44.700> where<00:02:45.000> now<00:02:45.210> you<00:02:45.270> have<00:02:45.510> to

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
highlighting color where now you have to

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.480 
highlighting color where now you have to
think<00:02:46.110> about<00:02:46.260> light<00:02:46.650> direction<00:02:47.040> I'm<00:02:47.280> just

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:47.490 
think about light direction I'm just

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:48.850 
think about light direction I'm just
going<00:02:47.640> to<00:02:47.700> put<00:02:47.820> a<00:02:47.850> little<00:02:48.060> bit<00:02:48.209> of<00:02:48.360> medium

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
going to put a little bit of medium

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.490 
going to put a little bit of medium
thinning<00:02:49.860> medium<00:02:50.310> into<00:02:50.640> that<00:02:51.320> so<00:02:52.320> it's

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
thinning medium into that so it's

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.240 
thinning medium into that so it's
slightly<00:02:52.950> runny<00:02:53.700> or<00:02:53.970> very<00:02:54.240> slightly<00:02:54.720> and<00:02:55.250> now

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
slightly runny or very slightly and now

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.070 
slightly runny or very slightly and now
I'm<00:02:56.730> just<00:02:56.910> gonna<00:02:57.030> pick<00:02:57.360> it<00:02:57.390> up<00:02:57.540> pushing<00:02:57.959> it

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
I'm just gonna pick it up pushing it

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.260 
I'm just gonna pick it up pushing it
brushing<00:02:58.620> to<00:02:59.100> make<00:02:59.280> sure<00:02:59.490> I've<00:02:59.610> got<00:02:59.640> paint<00:03:00.060> on

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270 
brushing to make sure I've got paint on

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:02.900 
brushing to make sure I've got paint on
the<00:03:00.450> tips<00:03:00.690> of<00:03:00.840> the<00:03:00.959> bristles<00:03:01.140> and<00:03:01.680> now<00:03:02.490> we<00:03:02.550> have

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
the tips of the bristles and now we have

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.699 
the tips of the bristles and now we have
to<00:03:03.030> be<00:03:03.150> a<00:03:03.180> bit<00:03:03.390> selective<00:03:03.870> so<00:03:04.110> if<00:03:04.230> I<00:03:04.350> say<00:03:04.560> the

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
to be a bit selective so if I say the

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:07.070 
to be a bit selective so if I say the
lights<00:03:04.890> coming<00:03:05.220> from<00:03:05.520> top<00:03:06.090> left<00:03:06.360> lights

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
lights coming from top left lights

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.320 
lights coming from top left lights
coming<00:03:07.410> in<00:03:07.470> that<00:03:07.709> way<00:03:07.890> then<00:03:08.880> you<00:03:09.060> think<00:03:09.209> about

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
coming in that way then you think about

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:10.910 
coming in that way then you think about
the<00:03:09.570> branches<00:03:10.020> that<00:03:10.080> are<00:03:10.350> catching<00:03:10.740> the<00:03:10.830> light

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
the branches that are catching the light

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.320 
the branches that are catching the light
other<00:03:11.160> parts<00:03:11.520> of<00:03:11.640> the<00:03:11.760> trees<00:03:12.030> that<00:03:12.209> are

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
other parts of the trees that are

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:13.850 
other parts of the trees that are
catching<00:03:12.720> the<00:03:12.810> light<00:03:12.930> so<00:03:13.230> it'll<00:03:13.410> be<00:03:13.530> the<00:03:13.680> high

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
catching the light so it'll be the high

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:19.910 
catching the light so it'll be the high
parts<00:03:16.220> and<00:03:17.810> the<00:03:18.810> ends<00:03:19.110> of<00:03:19.230> the<00:03:19.290> branches<00:03:19.500> that

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
parts and the ends of the branches that

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.259 
parts and the ends of the branches that
are<00:03:20.250> out<00:03:20.489> towards<00:03:21.209> the<00:03:21.420> light<00:03:22.940> when<00:03:23.940> you<00:03:24.090> look

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
are out towards the light when you look

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:28.070 
are out towards the light when you look
at<00:03:24.450> a<00:03:24.510> group<00:03:24.750> of<00:03:24.989> trees<00:03:25.590> in<00:03:25.830> the<00:03:25.920> distance<00:03:27.080> you

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
at a group of trees in the distance you

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:29.930 
at a group of trees in the distance you
can<00:03:28.260> see<00:03:28.320> rhythms<00:03:28.920> in<00:03:29.220> the<00:03:29.519> foliage

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
can see rhythms in the foliage

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.729 
can see rhythms in the foliage
especially<00:03:30.570> if<00:03:30.660> it's<00:03:30.810> a<00:03:30.900> group<00:03:31.110> of<00:03:31.290> the<00:03:31.350> same

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
especially if it's a group of the same

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:33.830 
especially if it's a group of the same
species<00:03:32.250> of<00:03:32.610> trees<00:03:32.940> like<00:03:33.180> oak<00:03:33.239> trees<00:03:33.810> that

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
species of trees like oak trees that

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.930 
species of trees like oak trees that
grow<00:03:34.320> in<00:03:34.500> in<00:03:34.739> the<00:03:34.860> oak<00:03:34.980> woods<00:03:35.400> when<00:03:35.610> you<00:03:35.730> look

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
grow in in the oak woods when you look

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.150 
grow in in the oak woods when you look
at<00:03:36.090> them<00:03:36.239> from<00:03:36.450> a<00:03:36.600> distance<00:03:36.810> you<00:03:37.709> see<00:03:37.950> these

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
at them from a distance you see these

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.970 
at them from a distance you see these
lovely<00:03:38.519> patterns<00:03:39.300> and<00:03:40.140> that's<00:03:40.470> what<00:03:40.800> you're

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
lovely patterns and that's what you're

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:45.530 
lovely patterns and that's what you're
trying<00:03:41.160> to<00:03:41.519> to<00:03:42.510> get<00:03:42.720> into<00:03:43.140> the<00:03:43.260> painting<00:03:44.540> again

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
trying to to get into the painting again

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.320 
trying to to get into the painting again
at<00:03:45.989> the<00:03:46.110> top<00:03:46.440> just<00:03:47.040> because<00:03:47.670> it's<00:03:48.000> a<00:03:48.090> lighter

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:48.330 
at the top just because it's a lighter

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.449 
at the top just because it's a lighter
color<00:03:48.720> that<00:03:48.959> I'm<00:03:49.080> working<00:03:49.230> with<00:03:49.500> I'm<00:03:49.890> putting

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
color that I'm working with I'm putting

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:52.100 
color that I'm working with I'm putting
some<00:03:50.700> that<00:03:50.880> it's<00:03:51.239> catching<00:03:51.480> the<00:03:51.750> light<00:03:51.870> just

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.110 
some that it's catching the light just

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:55.370 
some that it's catching the light just
up<00:03:52.350> on<00:03:52.590> the<00:03:53.160> top<00:03:53.400> parts<00:03:53.820> there<00:03:54.090> if<00:03:54.630> you<00:03:55.110> find

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
up on the top parts there if you find

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.590 
up on the top parts there if you find
you're<00:03:55.890> pushing<00:03:56.519> the<00:03:56.640> brush<00:03:56.880> in<00:03:57.090> to<00:03:57.120> get<00:03:57.330> paint

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600 
you're pushing the brush in to get paint

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.330 
you're pushing the brush in to get paint
off<00:03:57.840> it<00:03:58.380> means<00:03:58.620> you<00:03:58.799> haven't<00:03:58.980> got<00:03:59.130> enough

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
off it means you haven't got enough

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:02.030 
off it means you haven't got enough
paint<00:03:59.580> on<00:03:59.730> the<00:03:59.880> brush<00:04:00.019> then<00:04:01.019> you<00:04:01.200> get<00:04:01.440> blobs

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
paint on the brush then you get blobs

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.640 
paint on the brush then you get blobs
rather<00:04:02.549> than<00:04:03.000> delicately<00:04:03.720> or<00:04:03.870> leaves<00:04:04.200> so<00:04:04.440> just

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
rather than delicately or leaves so just

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:06.380 
rather than delicately or leaves so just
make<00:04:04.799> sure<00:04:05.040> you've<00:04:05.250> got<00:04:05.459> plenty<00:04:05.489> of<00:04:05.940> paint<00:04:06.150> on

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.390 
make sure you've got plenty of paint on

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:08.360 
make sure you've got plenty of paint on
the<00:04:06.540> brush<00:04:06.660> so<00:04:07.410> that<00:04:07.560> when<00:04:07.680> you<00:04:07.769> just<00:04:07.950> touch<00:04:08.340> it

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
the brush so that when you just touch it

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:11.449 
the brush so that when you just touch it
to<00:04:08.700> the<00:04:08.820> canvas<00:04:09.080> you're<00:04:10.080> just<00:04:10.560> putting<00:04:10.980> a<00:04:11.190> tiny

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
to the canvas you're just putting a tiny

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:15.039 
to the canvas you're just putting a tiny
little<00:04:11.880> bit<00:04:12.090> of<00:04:12.120> paint<00:04:12.390> on<00:04:12.540> and<00:04:13.340> then<00:04:14.340> finally

00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:15.049 
little bit of paint on and then finally

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:18.380 
little bit of paint on and then finally
we<00:04:16.049> mixed<00:04:16.320> the<00:04:16.470> third<00:04:16.709> highlight<00:04:17.280> color<00:04:17.609> which

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:18.390 
we mixed the third highlight color which

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:21.320 
we mixed the third highlight color which
again<00:04:18.750> I'm<00:04:19.140> going<00:04:19.350> to<00:04:19.440> use<00:04:19.790> the<00:04:20.790> remaining<00:04:21.209> of

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:21.330 
again I'm going to use the remaining of

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:24.860 
again I'm going to use the remaining of
cadmium<00:04:21.959> yellow<00:04:23.060> this<00:04:24.060> time<00:04:24.120> I'm<00:04:24.630> going<00:04:24.780> to

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
cadmium yellow this time I'm going to

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:27.560

introduce<00:04:25.080> a<00:04:25.440> little<00:04:25.620> bit<00:04:25.770> of<00:04:25.919> yellow

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
introduce a little bit of yellow

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:29.840 
introduce a little bit of yellow
because<00:04:28.470> when<00:04:28.590> you<00:04:28.680> look<00:04:28.770> at<00:04:28.889> oak<00:04:29.040> trees<00:04:29.430> the

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:29.850 
because when you look at oak trees the

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:32.170 
because when you look at oak trees the
leaves<00:04:30.060> especially<00:04:30.780> late<00:04:31.290> in<00:04:31.500> the<00:04:31.680> summer

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180 
leaves especially late in the summer

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:36.379 
leaves especially late in the summer
have<00:04:33.180> a<00:04:33.830> sort<00:04:34.830> of<00:04:34.889> earthy<00:04:35.460> look<00:04:35.910> to<00:04:36.060> the<00:04:36.180> green

00:04:36.379 --> 00:04:36.389 
have a sort of earthy look to the green

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:38.000 
have a sort of earthy look to the green
it's<00:04:36.570> an<00:04:36.660> earthy<00:04:37.050> green<00:04:37.080> they're<00:04:37.560> not<00:04:37.590> bright

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.010 
it's an earthy green they're not bright

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:42.980 
it's an earthy green they're not bright
greens<00:04:39.080> vivid<00:04:40.080> greens<00:04:41.330> so<00:04:42.330> the<00:04:42.600> highlight

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990 
greens vivid greens so the highlight

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:47.510 
greens vivid greens so the highlight
color<00:04:43.370> that<00:04:44.370> I'm<00:04:44.490> gonna<00:04:44.639> use<00:04:44.970> is<00:04:45.419> the<00:04:46.520> earthy

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 
color that I'm gonna use is the earthy

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.400 
color that I'm gonna use is the earthy
green<00:04:48.240> color<00:04:48.840> now

green color now
the<00:04:49.530> loading<00:04:49.830> of<00:04:49.950> the<00:04:49.980> brush<00:04:50.190> this<00:04:50.430> time<00:04:50.460> is

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:50.850 
the loading of the brush this time is

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:52.460 
the loading of the brush this time is
gonna<00:04:50.910> be<00:04:51.120> slightly<00:04:51.330> different<00:04:51.660> what<00:04:52.350> I'm

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:52.470 
gonna be slightly different what I'm

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:54.740 
gonna be slightly different what I'm
going<00:04:52.620> to<00:04:52.680> do<00:04:52.860> is<00:04:53.010> stab<00:04:53.460> the<00:04:53.760> brush<00:04:54.030> into<00:04:54.450> the

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:54.750 
going to do is stab the brush into the

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:57.830 
going to do is stab the brush into the
paint<00:04:55.050> that<00:04:55.710> way<00:04:55.980> which<00:04:56.730> pushes<00:04:57.090> paint<00:04:57.570> up

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:57.840 
paint that way which pushes paint up

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:59.719 
paint that way which pushes paint up
between<00:04:58.200> the<00:04:58.410> bristles<00:04:58.590> and<00:04:59.040> splays<00:04:59.460> the

00:04:59.719 --> 00:04:59.729 
between the bristles and splays the

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:02.360 
between the bristles and splays the
bristles<00:05:00.090> out<00:05:00.650> you<00:05:01.650> don't<00:05:01.800> use<00:05:02.130> your

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:02.370 
bristles out you don't use your

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:04.070 
bristles out you don't use your
cherished<00:05:02.790> brushes<00:05:03.270> for<00:05:03.479> this<00:05:03.660> you<00:05:03.870> use<00:05:04.050> a

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 
cherished brushes for this you use a

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:08.120 
cherished brushes for this you use a
sort<00:05:04.830> of<00:05:05.000> an<00:05:06.000> old<00:05:06.270> worn<00:05:06.720> one<00:05:07.020> and<00:05:07.229> then<00:05:07.770> just

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:08.130 
sort of an old worn one and then just

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:10.700 
sort of an old worn one and then just
gently<00:05:08.520> touch<00:05:09.120> the<00:05:09.450> bristles<00:05:10.110> into<00:05:10.440> the<00:05:10.560> wet

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:10.710 
gently touch the bristles into the wet

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:13.010 
gently touch the bristles into the wet
paint<00:05:11.070> and<00:05:11.250> you'll<00:05:11.669> get<00:05:11.850> paint<00:05:12.180> on<00:05:12.389> the<00:05:12.810> very

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:13.020 
paint and you'll get paint on the very

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:15.530 
paint and you'll get paint on the very
tips<00:05:13.320> of<00:05:13.500> the<00:05:13.560> bristles<00:05:13.740> and<00:05:14.310> then<00:05:14.790> the<00:05:15.180> next

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:15.540 
tips of the bristles and then the next

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:20.000 
tips of the bristles and then the next
stage<00:05:15.780> is<00:05:16.200> to<00:05:16.310> just<00:05:17.310> highlight<00:05:18.770> where<00:05:19.770> the

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:20.010 
stage is to just highlight where the

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:23.120 
stage is to just highlight where the
light<00:05:20.389> really<00:05:21.389> catches<00:05:21.960> the<00:05:21.990> now<00:05:22.919> you're

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:23.130 
light really catches the now you're

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:25.010 
light really catches the now you're
thinking<00:05:23.520> in<00:05:23.639> terms<00:05:23.940> of<00:05:24.180> bunches<00:05:24.630> of<00:05:24.840> leaves

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:25.020 
thinking in terms of bunches of leaves

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:30.650 
thinking in terms of bunches of leaves
rather<00:05:25.500> than<00:05:25.889> branches<00:05:26.520> and<00:05:29.419> again<00:05:30.419> make<00:05:30.630> sure

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:30.660 
rather than branches and again make sure

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:32.540 
rather than branches and again make sure
that<00:05:30.840> plenty<00:05:31.289> of<00:05:31.380> paint<00:05:31.620> on<00:05:31.770> there<00:05:31.919> if<00:05:32.190> you

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:32.550 
that plenty of paint on there if you

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:35.180 
that plenty of paint on there if you
again<00:05:33.330> if<00:05:33.690> the<00:05:33.960> paint<00:05:34.200> doesn't<00:05:34.530> come<00:05:34.710> off<00:05:34.890> make

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:35.190 
again if the paint doesn't come off make

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:38.300 
again if the paint doesn't come off make
sure<00:05:35.490> that<00:05:35.850> it's<00:05:36.630> wet<00:05:37.289> enough<00:05:37.320> to<00:05:37.800> just<00:05:38.039> touch

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:38.310 
sure that it's wet enough to just touch

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:43.520 
sure that it's wet enough to just touch
off<00:05:38.580> of<00:05:38.789> the<00:05:38.850> brush<00:05:39.060> at<00:05:39.240> this<00:05:39.390> stage<00:05:42.200> you<00:05:43.200> get<00:05:43.470> a

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:43.530 
off of the brush at this stage you get a

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:45.110 
off of the brush at this stage you get a
bit<00:05:43.650> too<00:05:43.830> much<00:05:43.950> from<00:05:44.160> there<00:05:44.310> just<00:05:44.520> roll<00:05:44.880> the

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:45.120 
bit too much from there just roll the

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.120 
bit too much from there just roll the
brush<00:05:45.330> get<00:05:45.780> rid<00:05:45.930> of<00:05:45.960> the<00:05:46.080> excess<00:05:46.410> paint<00:05:46.680> and<00:05:47.010> do

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:47.130 
brush get rid of the excess paint and do

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:52.550 
brush get rid of the excess paint and do
it<00:05:47.250> again<00:05:49.729> and<00:05:50.729> then<00:05:50.910> we're<00:05:51.060> going<00:05:51.240> for<00:05:51.600> these

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:52.560 
it again and then we're going for these

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.770 
it again and then we're going for these
little<00:05:52.890> highlights<00:05:53.390> don't<00:05:54.390> want<00:05:54.510> to<00:05:54.600> do<00:05:54.690> it

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:54.780 
little highlights don't want to do it

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:56.690 
little highlights don't want to do it
all<00:05:54.870> over<00:05:54.900> the<00:05:55.200> trees<00:05:55.500> especially<00:05:55.800> not<00:05:56.490> down

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:56.700 
all over the trees especially not down

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:59.090 
all over the trees especially not down
the<00:05:56.850> bottom<00:05:57.240> too<00:05:57.450> much<00:05:57.720> because<00:05:58.110> it<00:05:58.740> depends

00:05:59.090 --> 00:05:59.100 
the bottom too much because it depends

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:00.590 
the bottom too much because it depends
on<00:05:59.190> the<00:05:59.310> light<00:05:59.460> direction<00:06:00.180> if<00:06:00.330> the<00:06:00.419> lights

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:00.600 
on the light direction if the lights

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:02.180 
on the light direction if the lights
coming<00:06:00.870> over<00:06:01.139> your<00:06:01.289> shoulder<00:06:01.680> then<00:06:01.889> some<00:06:02.100> of

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:02.190 
coming over your shoulder then some of

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:03.500 
coming over your shoulder then some of
the<00:06:02.250> lower<00:06:02.370> branches<00:06:02.789> will<00:06:03.000> catch<00:06:03.240> the<00:06:03.479> light

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:03.510 
the lower branches will catch the light

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:08.510 
the lower branches will catch the light
but<00:06:04.470> otherwise<00:06:04.970> keep<00:06:05.970> the<00:06:06.830> highlights<00:06:07.830> to<00:06:08.490> the

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:08.520 
but otherwise keep the highlights to the

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:13.520 
but otherwise keep the highlights to the
top<00:06:09.360> two-thirds<00:06:10.080> of<00:06:10.320> your<00:06:10.470> trees<00:06:10.770> and<00:06:12.380> try<00:06:13.380> and

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:13.530 
top two-thirds of your trees and try and

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:18.740 
top two-thirds of your trees and try and
leave<00:06:13.680> those<00:06:13.950> little<00:06:14.340> shadow<00:06:14.550> gaps<00:06:14.910> just<00:06:17.750> got

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:18.750 
leave those little shadow gaps just got

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:21.860 
leave those little shadow gaps just got
a<00:06:18.780> little<00:06:18.990> bit<00:06:19.080> of<00:06:20.360> highlighting<00:06:21.360> to<00:06:21.479> put<00:06:21.660> in

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:21.870 
a little bit of highlighting to put in

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:25.180 
a little bit of highlighting to put in
here<00:06:22.160> which<00:06:23.160> are<00:06:23.340> just<00:06:23.700> finishing<00:06:24.510> it<00:06:24.630> off

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:25.190 
here which are just finishing it off

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:27.860 
here which are just finishing it off
there<00:06:26.190> we<00:06:26.310> are<00:06:26.340> my<00:06:27.090> method<00:06:27.510> of<00:06:27.600> painting

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:27.870 
there we are my method of painting

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:31.969 
there we are my method of painting
middle<00:06:28.470> distant<00:06:28.830> trees<00:06:29.070> and<00:06:30.500> here<00:06:31.500> in<00:06:31.680> a

00:06:31.969 --> 00:06:31.979 
middle distant trees and here in a

00:06:31.979 --> 00:06:33.590 
middle distant trees and here in a
finished<00:06:32.370> painting<00:06:32.610> you<00:06:33.030> can<00:06:33.060> see<00:06:33.240> the

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:33.600 
finished painting you can see the

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:36.170 
finished painting you can see the
technique<00:06:34.020> used<00:06:34.350> to<00:06:34.590> to<00:06:35.010> affect<00:06:35.430> in<00:06:35.669> the<00:06:35.849> in

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:36.180
