we've just got one penny to spare so

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:11.950 
we've just got one penny to spare so
let's<00:01:06.979> put<00:01:07.189> the<00:01:07.280> penny<00:01:07.490> in<00:01:07.579> the<00:01:07.880> machine<00:01:10.960> okay

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 
let's put the penny in the machine okay

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.219 
let's put the penny in the machine okay
so<00:01:12.740> that's<00:01:13.100> in<00:01:13.280> there<00:01:13.460> now<00:01:13.640> and<00:01:14.000> now<00:01:14.840> we<00:01:14.900> can

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:15.229 
so that's in there now and now we can

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:17.679 
so that's in there now and now we can
buy<00:01:15.439> one<00:01:15.710> so<00:01:15.950> we<00:01:16.100> went<00:01:16.280> for<00:01:16.430> which<00:01:16.610> was<00:01:16.880> it<00:01:17.030> so

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:17.689 
buy one so we went for which was it so

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:22.440 
buy one so we went for which was it so
let's<00:01:17.899> pick<00:01:18.259> that

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:22.450 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.340 

glorious<00:01:23.890> absolutely<00:01:24.890> glorious

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.350 
glorious absolutely glorious

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.930 
glorious absolutely glorious
so<00:01:27.350> how<00:01:27.740> ISA<00:01:27.950> works<00:01:28.130> is<00:01:28.430> fairly

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:28.940 
so how ISA works is fairly

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:29.710 
so how ISA works is fairly
straightforward

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 
straightforward

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.540 
straightforward
now<00:01:30.500> if<00:01:30.650> you're<00:01:30.770> wondering<00:01:30.920> what<00:01:31.130> the<00:01:31.280> giant

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:31.550 
now if you're wondering what the giant

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:35.109 
now if you're wondering what the giant
coin<00:01:31.700> is<00:01:31.909> that<00:01:32.810> is<00:01:33.110> an<00:01:33.619> invisible<00:01:34.190> upside-down

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:35.119 
coin is that is an invisible upside-down

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:37.359 
coin is that is an invisible upside-down
giant<00:01:35.659> with<00:01:36.170> a<00:01:36.200> sunflower<00:01:36.619> in<00:01:36.799> his<00:01:36.890> hand<00:01:37.100> and

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:37.369 
giant with a sunflower in his hand and

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:39.370 
giant with a sunflower in his hand and
that<00:01:37.670> looks<00:01:37.909> like<00:01:38.030> a<00:01:38.180> giant<00:01:38.450> coin<00:01:38.750> which<00:01:39.200> I

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380 
that looks like a giant coin which I

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.800 
that looks like a giant coin which I
thought<00:01:39.560> looked<00:01:39.619> pretty<00:01:40.430> cool<00:01:40.610> so<00:01:41.540> what<00:01:41.690> we're

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
thought looked pretty cool so what we're

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.340 
thought looked pretty cool so what we're
doing<00:01:41.840> is<00:01:42.320> we<00:01:42.860> are<00:01:43.540> testing<00:01:44.540> if<00:01:44.750> a<00:01:44.899> player<00:01:45.110> has

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
doing is we are testing if a player has

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.550 
doing is we are testing if a player has
a<00:01:45.830> sunflower<00:01:46.550> in<00:01:46.940> their<00:01:47.420> first<00:01:47.690> individual<00:01:48.350> or

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 
a sunflower in their first individual or

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.840 
a sunflower in their first individual or
their<00:01:48.890> first<00:01:49.070> hopper<00:01:49.369> slots<00:01:49.869> now<00:01:50.869> if<00:01:51.110> they<00:01:51.350> do

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850 
their first hopper slots now if they do

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.270 
their first hopper slots now if they do
then<00:01:52.850> what's<00:01:53.060> going<00:01:53.210> to<00:01:53.240> happen<00:01:53.539> is<00:01:54.009> they<00:01:55.009> are

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
then what's going to happen is they are

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.359 
then what's going to happen is they are
going<00:01:55.490> to<00:01:55.759> have<00:01:56.240> their<00:01:56.479> score<00:01:56.780> set<00:01:57.110> in<00:01:57.500> coin

00:01:58.359 --> 00:01:58.369 
going to have their score set in coin

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:01.419 
going to have their score set in coin
hold<00:01:58.700> two<00:01:59.179> one<00:01:59.450> okay<00:02:00.020> so<00:02:00.229> what<00:02:00.800> this<00:02:00.860> means<00:02:01.130> is

00:02:01.419 --> 00:02:01.429 
hold two one okay so what this means is

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:04.029

holding the coin so if you are holding
the<00:02:11.959> coin<00:02:12.170> what's<00:02:13.010> going<00:02:13.160> to<00:02:13.190> happen<00:02:13.550> is<00:02:14.290> we're

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
the coin what's going to happen is we're

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.220 
the coin what's going to happen is we're
going<00:02:15.380> to<00:02:15.470> teleport<00:02:15.800> this<00:02:16.130> this<00:02:16.700> Giants<00:02:17.360> to

holding the coin will the Giants be

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:28.990 
holding the coin will the Giants be
repeatedly<00:02:27.739> teleported<00:02:28.400> to<00:02:28.430> you<00:02:28.610> to<00:02:28.790> give<00:02:28.910> the

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
repeatedly teleported to you to give the

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.830 
repeatedly teleported to you to give the
impression<00:02:29.150> that<00:02:29.360> you're<00:02:29.450> holding<00:02:29.780> this

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
impression that you're holding this

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.509 
impression that you're holding this
giant<00:02:29.900> coin<00:02:32.079> so<00:02:33.079> once<00:02:33.500> you're<00:02:33.650> once<00:02:34.370> you

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:34.519 
giant coin so once you're once you

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:36.940 
giant coin so once you're once you
you're<00:02:34.790> holding<00:02:35.090> the<00:02:35.180> coin<00:02:35.769> what's<00:02:36.769> going<00:02:36.920> to

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
you're holding the coin what's going to

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.740 
you're holding the coin what's going to
happen<00:02:37.250> is<00:02:37.430> we're<00:02:37.940> going<00:02:38.209> to<00:02:39.790> attempt<00:02:40.790> to<00:02:40.970> set

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
happen is we're going to attempt to set

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.539 
happen is we're going to attempt to set
any<00:02:41.930> player<00:02:42.260> that's<00:02:42.799> a<00:02:43.130> very<00:02:43.340> specific

00:02:43.539 --> 00:02:43.549 
any player that's a very specific

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:46.509 
any player that's a very specific
coordinate<00:02:44.329> it's<00:02:44.480> just<00:02:44.750> outside<00:02:45.320> of<00:02:45.380> the<00:02:45.560> of

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:46.519 
coordinate it's just outside of the of

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:50.069 
coordinate it's just outside of the of
the<00:02:47.390> slot<00:02:47.660> over<00:02:47.750> there<00:02:48.400> so<00:02:49.400> if<00:02:49.519> you're<00:02:49.640> holding

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:50.079 
the slot over there so if you're holding

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:53.110 
the slot over there so if you're holding
key<00:02:51.079> sunflower<00:02:51.530> just<00:02:52.010> outside<00:02:52.220> its<00:02:52.400> slot<00:02:52.610> then

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
key sunflower just outside its slot then

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.979 
key sunflower just outside its slot then
your<00:02:53.329> coin<00:02:53.950> score<00:02:55.030> will<00:02:56.030> be<00:02:56.150> set<00:02:56.329> to<00:02:56.360> 1<00:02:56.450> now

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:56.989 
your coin score will be set to 1 now

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:59.920 
your coin score will be set to 1 now
what<00:02:57.170> coin<00:02:57.500> score<00:02:58.040> is<00:02:58.280> is<00:02:58.610> basically<00:02:59.299> whether

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
what coin score is is basically whether

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:01.509 
what coin score is is basically whether
you're<00:03:00.140> allowed<00:03:00.380> to<00:03:00.680> buy<00:03:00.890> something<00:03:01.310> or<00:03:01.370> not

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:01.519 
you're allowed to buy something or not

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:02.770 
you're allowed to buy something or not
if<00:03:01.670> it's<00:03:01.790> at<00:03:01.940> zero<00:03:02.209> then<00:03:02.360> you<00:03:02.450> can't<00:03:02.660> buy

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
if it's at zero then you can't buy

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.430 
if it's at zero then you can't buy
anything<00:03:03.400> so<00:03:04.400> what's<00:03:05.239> done<00:03:05.450> that<00:03:05.630> we're<00:03:06.260> just

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
anything so what's done that we're just

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.199 
anything so what's done that we're just
going<00:03:06.709> to<00:03:06.890> clear<00:03:07.340> the<00:03:07.579> sunflower<00:03:07.970> your

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:08.209 
going to clear the sunflower your

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:10.569 
going to clear the sunflower your
inventory<00:03:08.660> and<00:03:08.840> because<00:03:09.799> the<00:03:10.070> sunflower<00:03:10.489> is

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:10.579 
inventory and because the sunflower is

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:12.340 
inventory and because the sunflower is
cleared<00:03:10.850> out<00:03:10.940> of<00:03:11.000> your<00:03:11.090> inventory<00:03:11.359> this

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:12.350 
cleared out of your inventory this

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:16.000 
cleared out of your inventory this
command<00:03:13.250> block<00:03:13.400> will<00:03:13.880> reset<00:03:14.390> your<00:03:14.739> Queen<00:03:15.739> hold

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
command block will reset your Queen hold

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:19.090 
command block will reset your Queen hold
score<00:03:16.280> back<00:03:16.640> to<00:03:16.850> zero<00:03:17.090> so<00:03:17.480> that<00:03:17.660> the<00:03:18.620> Giant<00:03:18.980> is

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.100 
score back to zero so that the Giant is

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:20.470 
score back to zero so that the Giant is
no<00:03:19.250> longer<00:03:19.459> being<00:03:19.670> teleported<00:03:19.910> to<00:03:20.180> you<00:03:20.329> and

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
no longer being teleported to you and

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.410 
no longer being teleported to you and
then<00:03:20.600> the<00:03:20.720> giant<00:03:21.109> will<00:03:21.230> just<00:03:21.440> be<00:03:21.590> I<00:03:22.060> think<00:03:23.060> that

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
then the giant will just be I think that

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:24.789 
then the giant will just be I think that
well<00:03:23.750> basically<00:03:23.900> the<00:03:24.260> last<00:03:24.410> one<00:03:24.650> will

00:03:24.789 --> 00:03:24.799 
well basically the last one will

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:26.710 
well basically the last one will
teleport<00:03:25.130> the<00:03:25.489> drive<00:03:25.760> back<00:03:25.970> to<00:03:26.239> his<00:03:26.359> holding

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
teleport the drive back to his holding

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.849 
teleport the drive back to his holding
spot<00:03:26.959> as<00:03:27.579> for<00:03:28.579> the<00:03:28.730> mob<00:03:29.630> dropping<00:03:30.230> system<00:03:30.620> it's

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:30.859 
spot as for the mob dropping system it's

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:32.730 
spot as for the mob dropping system it's
actually<00:03:31.549> really<00:03:31.699> really<00:03:31.820> easy<00:03:32.000> to<00:03:32.389> do

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:32.740 
actually really really easy to do

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:35.040 
actually really really easy to do
so<00:03:33.520> when<00:03:34.210> you<00:03:34.300> push<00:03:34.720> one<00:03:34.810> of<00:03:34.900> these<00:03:34.990> buttons

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:35.050 
so when you push one of these buttons

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:38.640 
so when you push one of these buttons
over<00:03:35.380> there<00:03:35.640> what<00:03:36.640> happens<00:03:36.970> is<00:03:37.590> there's<00:03:38.590> a

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
over there what happens is there's a

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:39.990 
over there what happens is there's a
command<00:03:38.890> block<00:03:39.010> behind<00:03:39.280> the<00:03:39.430> button<00:03:39.610> which

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
command block behind the button which

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.150 
command block behind the button which
was<00:03:40.180> set<00:03:40.360> block<00:03:40.570> a<00:03:40.900> block<00:03:41.350> here<00:03:41.680> okay

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.160 
was set block a block here okay

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.250 
was set block a block here okay
so<00:03:42.400> this<00:03:42.730> this<00:03:43.210> is<00:03:43.390> just<00:03:43.480> little<00:03:43.660> clock<00:03:43.990> well

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
so this this is just little clock well

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.260 
so this this is just little clock well
in<00:03:44.410> incomplete<00:03:45.010> clock<00:03:45.280> but<00:03:45.550> when<00:03:45.700> you<00:03:45.850> set<00:03:46.180> the

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:46.270 
in incomplete clock but when you set the

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:47.610 
in incomplete clock but when you set the
block<00:03:46.420> here<00:03:46.660> it<00:03:46.810> will<00:03:47.020> complete<00:03:47.350> the<00:03:47.440> clock

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
block here it will complete the clock

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:50.430 
block here it will complete the clock
which<00:03:48.490> will<00:03:48.780> continuously<00:03:49.780> run<00:03:50.050> this<00:03:50.230> command

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440 
which will continuously run this command

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.890 
which will continuously run this command
for<00:03:50.770> a<00:03:50.800> brief<00:03:51.340> period<00:03:51.580> of<00:03:51.820> time<00:03:51.880> so<00:03:52.330> teleport

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
for a brief period of time so teleport

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.750 
for a brief period of time so teleport
any<00:03:53.590> entity<00:03:54.310> of<00:03:54.520> type<00:03:54.760> of<00:03:54.940> pig<00:03:55.120> zombie<00:03:56.760> 0.1

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
any entity of type of pig zombie 0.1

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.810 
any entity of type of pig zombie 0.1
blocks<00:03:58.590> in<00:03:59.590> the<00:03:59.740> minus<00:04:00.070> direction<00:04:00.190> of<00:04:00.550> the<00:04:00.640> Z

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:00.820 
blocks in the minus direction of the Z

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:04.610 
blocks in the minus direction of the Z
so<00:04:01.600> for<00:04:02.530> about<00:04:02.710> five<00:04:03.010> ticks<00:04:03.370> it<00:04:04.030> will

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
so for about five ticks it will

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:09.560 
so for about five ticks it will
continuously<00:04:05.620> teleport<00:04:06.250> all<00:04:06.550> Pig<00:04:07.270> zombies<00:04:08.010> a

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:09.570 
continuously teleport all Pig zombies a

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:14.130 
continuously teleport all Pig zombies a
very<00:04:11.310> fraction<00:04:12.310> of<00:04:12.520> a<00:04:12.790> block<00:04:13.000> so<00:04:13.300> 0.1<00:04:13.930> blocks

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:14.140 
very fraction of a block so 0.1 blocks

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:17.100 
very fraction of a block so 0.1 blocks
so<00:04:14.440> for<00:04:14.650> five<00:04:14.800> ticks<00:04:15.150> so<00:04:16.150> basically<00:04:16.900> what

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:17.110 
so for five ticks so basically what

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:20.280 
so for five ticks so basically what
that's<00:04:17.230> going<00:04:17.350> to<00:04:17.410> do<00:04:17.560> is<00:04:17.710> it's<00:04:17.860> going<00:04:18.040> to<00:04:19.290> push

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:20.290 
that's going to do is it's going to push

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:23.340 
that's going to do is it's going to push
the<00:04:20.800> Pigman<00:04:21.790> forward<00:04:22.300> okay<00:04:22.600> so<00:04:23.080> the<00:04:23.170> one<00:04:23.290> on

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:23.350 
the Pigman forward okay so the one on

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:25.460 
the Pigman forward okay so the one on
the<00:04:23.500> end<00:04:23.650> is<00:04:23.830> going<00:04:23.950> to<00:04:24.010> be<00:04:24.160> pushed<00:04:24.430> off<00:04:24.730> and

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
the end is going to be pushed off and

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:27.630 
the end is going to be pushed off and
the<00:04:26.470> one<00:04:26.650> spines<00:04:26.980> are<00:04:27.100> going<00:04:27.310> to<00:04:27.370> be<00:04:27.460> pushed

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:27.640 
the one spines are going to be pushed

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:29.610 
the one spines are going to be pushed
forward<00:04:27.880> but<00:04:28.810> obviously<00:04:29.260> they<00:04:29.380> aren't<00:04:29.470> going

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:29.620 
forward but obviously they aren't going

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:30.720 
forward but obviously they aren't going
to<00:04:29.680> fall<00:04:29.770> off<00:04:29.920> because<00:04:30.070> you're<00:04:30.490> only<00:04:30.550> supposed

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:30.730 
to fall off because you're only supposed

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:34.500 
to fall off because you're only supposed
to<00:04:30.880> get<00:04:30.970> one<00:04:31.150> and<00:04:31.480> once<00:04:32.290> you've<00:04:32.410> done<00:04:32.440> that<00:04:33.510> the

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:34.510 
to get one and once you've done that the

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:38.610 
to get one and once you've done that the
clocks<00:04:34.720> just<00:04:34.960> reset<00:04:35.320> and<00:04:36.390> the<00:04:37.390> Queen<00:04:38.260> squares

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:38.620 
clocks just reset and the Queen squares

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:41.060 
clocks just reset and the Queen squares
reset<00:04:38.950> to<00:04:39.070> zero<00:04:39.370> so<00:04:39.610> you<00:04:39.640> can't<00:04:39.970> use<00:04:40.480> it<00:04:40.510> again

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:41.070 
reset to zero so you can't use it again

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:43.500 
reset to zero so you can't use it again
but<00:04:42.070> that's<00:04:42.430> all<00:04:42.820> there<00:04:43.090> is<00:04:43.120> to<00:04:43.390> it<00:04:43.480> really

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:43.510 
but that's all there is to it really

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:46.260 
but that's all there is to it really
nothing<00:04:44.440> much<00:04:44.560> to<00:04:44.620> I<00:04:45.160> hope<00:04:45.820> you<00:04:45.940> enjoyed<00:04:46.180> this

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:46.270 
nothing much to I hope you enjoyed this

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:50.100 
nothing much to I hope you enjoyed this
video<00:04:46.450> and<00:04:46.900> I<00:04:47.410> will<00:04:47.560> see<00:04:47.590> you<00:04:47.800> next<00:04:47.920> time
