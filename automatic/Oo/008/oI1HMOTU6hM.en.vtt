a different camera right now I've

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.140 
a different camera right now I've
decided<00:00:29.099> to<00:00:29.250> change<00:00:29.460> my<00:00:29.519> setup<00:00:29.880> around<00:00:30.060> a

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
decided to change my setup around a

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.490 
decided to change my setup around a
little<00:00:30.300> bit<00:00:30.480> and<00:00:30.630> that<00:00:30.750> means<00:00:30.929> using<00:00:31.109> a<00:00:31.289> couple

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
little bit and that means using a couple

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.290 
little bit and that means using a couple
different<00:00:31.590> devices<00:00:31.980> and<00:00:32.279> stuff<00:00:32.520> and<00:00:32.700> without

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
different devices and stuff and without

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.280 
different devices and stuff and without
getting<00:00:33.570> into<00:00:33.690> all<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:33.899> technical<00:00:34.200> details

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
getting into all the technical details

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.870 
getting into all the technical details
and<00:00:34.710> stuff<00:00:34.800> like<00:00:35.040> that<00:00:35.100> this<00:00:35.399> is<00:00:35.520> pretty<00:00:35.730> much

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
and stuff like that this is pretty much

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.610 
and stuff like that this is pretty much
so<00:00:36.000> i<00:00:36.030> can<00:00:36.210> record<00:00:36.300> live<00:00:36.750> all<00:00:36.989> the<00:00:37.260> time<00:00:37.290> like

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
so i can record live all the time like

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.080 
so i can record live all the time like
face<00:00:37.829> cam<00:00:38.040> and<00:00:38.190> all<00:00:38.250> that<00:00:38.399> stuff<00:00:38.520> all<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:38.879> time

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
face cam and all that stuff all the time

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.310 
face cam and all that stuff all the time
instead<00:00:39.480> of<00:00:39.540> you<00:00:39.690> in<00:00:39.780> my<00:00:39.840> little<00:00:39.989> one<00:00:40.170> hour

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
instead of you in my little one hour

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.049 
instead of you in my little one hour
sessions<00:00:40.800> and<00:00:40.920> stuff<00:00:41.129> like<00:00:41.219> that<00:00:41.280> so<00:00:41.790> instead

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
sessions and stuff like that so instead

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.040 
sessions and stuff like that so instead
of<00:00:42.120> trying<00:00:42.270> to<00:00:42.420> piece<00:00:42.540> together<00:00:42.660> all<00:00:42.960> these

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
of trying to piece together all these

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.420 
of trying to piece together all these
one-hour<00:00:43.410> sessions<00:00:43.890> I'm<00:00:44.010> hopefully<00:00:44.250> going<00:00:44.340> to

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
one-hour sessions I'm hopefully going to

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:45.770 
one-hour sessions I'm hopefully going to
be<00:00:44.489> recording<00:00:44.850> like<00:00:44.969> all<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.390> time<00:00:45.600> and

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
be recording like all the time and

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.270 
be recording like all the time and
capturing<00:00:46.110> as<00:00:46.260> much<00:00:46.410> footage<00:00:46.559> as<00:00:46.770> I<00:00:46.920> can<00:00:47.129> and

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
capturing as much footage as I can and

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.380 
capturing as much footage as I can and
i'll<00:00:47.370> catch<00:00:47.579> all<00:00:47.789> this<00:00:47.910> stuff<00:00:48.059> that<00:00:48.180> I<00:00:48.210> usually

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
i'll catch all this stuff that I usually

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:49.850 
i'll catch all this stuff that I usually
wouldn't<00:00:48.750> be<00:00:48.870> because<00:00:48.989> I'd<00:00:49.260> be<00:00:49.410> in<00:00:49.559> between

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
wouldn't be because I'd be in between

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.049 
wouldn't be because I'd be in between
sessions<00:00:50.070> and<00:00:50.370> something<00:00:50.610> would<00:00:50.700> happen<00:00:50.850> then

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
sessions and something would happen then

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.639 
sessions and something would happen then
I<00:00:51.149> would<00:00:51.180> miss<00:00:51.510> and<00:00:51.719> ultimately<00:00:52.379> this<00:00:52.590> will

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
I would miss and ultimately this will

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.049 
I would miss and ultimately this will
hopefully<00:00:52.860> result<00:00:53.309> in<00:00:53.520> be<00:00:53.670> uploading<00:00:54.030> a

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
hopefully result in be uploading a

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.670 
hopefully result in be uploading a
little<00:00:54.239> bit<00:00:54.360> more<00:00:54.449> often<00:00:54.780> and<00:00:54.960> that'll

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
little bit more often and that'll

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:56.840 
little bit more often and that'll
probably<00:00:55.829> happen<00:00:55.980> in<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.309> future<00:00:56.489> I'm<00:00:56.730> just

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
probably happen in the future I'm just

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:57.650 
probably happen in the future I'm just
rying<00:00:56.969> to<00:00:57.000> get<00:00:57.120> everything<00:00:57.390> figured<00:00:57.510> out

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
rying to get everything figured out

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:58.790 
rying to get everything figured out
right<00:00:57.840> now<00:00:58.050> but<00:00:58.289> that's<00:00:58.469> pretty<00:00:58.590> much<00:00:58.680> the
