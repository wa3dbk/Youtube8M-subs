00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:00.820 
velocity stack and math adapter you can

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.420 
velocity stack and math adapter you can
see<00:02:00.940> the<00:02:01.060> velocity<00:02:01.210> stack<00:02:01.690> on<00:02:01.869> this<00:02:02.050> side<00:02:02.430> and

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:03.430 
see the velocity stack on this side and

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:05.370 
see the velocity stack on this side and
the<00:02:03.610> math<00:02:03.759> adapter<00:02:04.180> on<00:02:04.270> this<00:02:04.420> side<00:02:04.600> the<00:02:05.229> MAF
