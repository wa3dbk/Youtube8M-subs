Acula can you explain what a leaking

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.950 
Acula can you explain what a leaking
heart<00:01:13.510> valve<00:01:13.750> is<00:01:14.229> a<00:01:14.970> leaking<00:01:15.970> heart<00:01:16.210> valve<00:01:16.510> the

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 
heart valve is a leaking heart valve the

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.630 
heart valve is a leaking heart valve the
way<00:01:17.140> the<00:01:17.410> the<00:01:17.680> heart<00:01:17.890> valve<00:01:18.130> typically

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:18.640 
way the the heart valve typically

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.920 
way the the heart valve typically
functions<00:01:19.180> is<00:01:19.420> when<00:01:19.750> the<00:01:19.930> heart<00:01:20.170> contracts

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
functions is when the heart contracts

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.170 
functions is when the heart contracts
it<00:01:22.230> opens<00:01:22.740> particularly<00:01:23.610> for<00:01:23.760> the<00:01:23.850> Orting

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
it opens particularly for the Orting

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.200 
it opens particularly for the Orting
valve<00:01:24.360> when<00:01:24.690> it<00:01:24.810> relaxes<00:01:25.500> it<00:01:25.950> closes<00:01:26.490> if<00:01:26.970> you

into the chamber from where it came so a

is<00:03:21.800> a<00:03:21.830> very<00:03:22.130> subtle<00:03:22.720> symptom<00:03:23.720> but<00:03:24.350> over<00:03:24.650> time

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:24.920 
is a very subtle symptom but over time

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.130 
is a very subtle symptom but over time
as<00:03:25.310> the<00:03:25.430> heart<00:03:25.610> muscle<00:03:25.970> gets<00:03:26.000> weaker<00:03:26.600> that's

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:27.140 
as the heart muscle gets weaker that's

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.640 
as the heart muscle gets weaker that's
when<00:03:27.440> the<00:03:27.590> more<00:03:27.770> extreme<00:03:28.280> symptoms<00:03:28.820> occur<00:03:29.650> so

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
when the more extreme symptoms occur so

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:32.440 
when the more extreme symptoms occur so

a structural abnormality the valve then
what<00:03:51.080> we<00:03:51.200> do<00:03:51.380> is<00:03:51.500> we<00:03:51.650> remove<00:03:51.920> that<00:03:52.670> aspect<00:03:53.360> of

the abnormality was after we do that
then<00:04:02.959> we<00:04:03.170> want<00:04:03.380> to<00:04:03.530> remodel<00:04:04.090> the<00:04:05.090> annulus<00:04:05.750> or

you will back to its normal shape when
valves<00:04:11.409> begin<00:04:11.739> to<00:04:11.920> leak<00:04:12.129> they<00:04:12.790> also<00:04:13.180> instead

00:04:13.649 --> 00:04:13.659 
valves begin to leak they also instead

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:16.140 
valves begin to leak they also instead
of<00:04:13.720> being<00:04:14.110> like<00:04:14.349> a<00:04:14.379> capital<00:04:14.980> D<00:04:15.220> on<00:04:15.430> its<00:04:15.610> side<00:04:15.879> as

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150 
of being like a capital D on its side as

of being like a capital D on its side as
what<00:04:16.359> I<00:04:16.389> tell<00:04:16.720> patients<00:04:16.930> is<00:04:17.350> the<00:04:17.500> normal

00:04:17.879 --> 00:04:17.889 
what I tell patients is the normal

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:20.069 
what I tell patients is the normal
geometry<00:04:18.459> of<00:04:18.519> the<00:04:18.639> valve<00:04:18.880> they<00:04:19.479> become<00:04:19.870> more

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:20.079 
geometry of the valve they become more

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:22.320 
geometry of the valve they become more
circular<00:04:20.560> so<00:04:21.340> by<00:04:21.519> replacing<00:04:21.729> that

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:22.330 
circular so by replacing that

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:24.600 
circular so by replacing that
annuloplasty<00:04:22.840> ring<00:04:23.500> it<00:04:23.770> recreates<00:04:24.220> that

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
annuloplasty ring it recreates that

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:27.030 
annuloplasty ring it recreates that
normal<00:04:25.120> capital<00:04:25.840> D<00:04:26.020> on<00:04:26.229> its<00:04:26.410> side<00:04:26.620> figure

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.040 
normal capital D on its side figure

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.760 
normal capital D on its side figure
which<00:04:27.760> then<00:04:28.000> allows<00:04:28.300> the<00:04:28.600> valve<00:04:28.810> to<00:04:29.050> function

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:29.770 
which then allows the valve to function

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:30.620 
which then allows the valve to function
normally

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:30.630 
normally

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:34.140

so<00:04:31.630> if<00:04:31.750> I<00:04:31.870> have<00:04:32.050> a<00:04:32.080> leaky<00:04:32.650> or<00:04:32.680> Tek<00:04:33.160> valve<00:04:33.370> how

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:34.150 
so if I have a leaky or Tek valve how

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:36.870 
so if I have a leaky or Tek valve how
can<00:04:34.540> that<00:04:34.660> be<00:04:34.720> treated<00:04:35.229> leaking<00:04:36.220> aortic<00:04:36.520> valve

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:36.880 
can that be treated leaking aortic valve

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.300 
can that be treated leaking aortic valve
sometimes<00:04:37.330> need<00:04:37.900> to<00:04:38.020> be<00:04:38.169> replaced<00:04:38.590> in<00:04:38.889> fact

most<00:04:39.610> of<00:04:39.760> the<00:04:39.850> time<00:04:40.090> because<00:04:40.539> typically
