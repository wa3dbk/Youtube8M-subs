00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
in it last year but I was in each and I

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.699 
in it last year but I was in each and I
recently<00:03:03.269> and<00:03:03.720> they<00:03:03.780> had<00:03:03.900> a<00:03:03.930> lot<00:03:04.230> of<00:03:04.349> similar

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
recently and they had a lot of similar

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:05.960 
recently and they had a lot of similar
ones<00:03:04.920> so<00:03:05.159> you<00:03:05.189> shouldn't<00:03:05.579> have<00:03:05.730> any<00:03:05.939> trouble

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
ones so you shouldn't have any trouble

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.479 
ones so you shouldn't have any trouble
finding<00:03:06.930> something<00:03:07.139> like<00:03:07.349> this<00:03:07.560> then<00:03:08.189> I<00:03:08.220> have

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
finding something like this then I have

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:10.729 
finding something like this then I have
this<00:03:08.670> knit<00:03:08.970> scarf<00:03:09.389> because<00:03:09.689> it<00:03:09.840> is<00:03:10.079> full<00:03:10.470> and

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
this knit scarf because it is full and

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:13.250 
this knit scarf because it is full and
it<00:03:10.829> is<00:03:10.980> colder<00:03:11.579> so<00:03:11.909> a<00:03:12.120> blouse<00:03:12.540> isn't<00:03:12.989> really

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
it is colder so a blouse isn't really

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.080 
it is colder so a blouse isn't really
going<00:03:13.409> to<00:03:13.500> keep<00:03:13.739> you<00:03:13.829> very<00:03:13.980> warm<00:03:14.370> so<00:03:14.609> I<00:03:14.670> decided

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
going to keep you very warm so I decided

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.539 
going to keep you very warm so I decided
to<00:03:15.209> incorporate<00:03:15.599> this<00:03:16.139> very<00:03:16.379> warm<00:03:16.829> wool<00:03:17.250> knit

00:03:41.719 --> 00:03:41.729 
or my favorite idea is first school

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:43.490 
or my favorite idea is first school
because<00:03:42.180> I'm<00:03:42.419> in<00:03:42.569> school<00:03:42.840> all<00:03:43.109> day<00:03:43.290> and

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
because I'm in school all day and

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.110 
because I'm in school all day and
sitting<00:03:43.739> in<00:03:43.889> those<00:03:44.040> uncomfortable<00:03:44.669> chairs<00:03:44.879> is

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
sitting in those uncomfortable chairs is

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.069 
sitting in those uncomfortable chairs is
not<00:03:45.329> fun<00:03:45.569> at<00:03:45.810> all

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:46.079 
not fun at all

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:48.140 
not fun at all
and<00:03:46.470> I<00:03:46.590> usually<00:03:46.919> tend<00:03:47.129> to<00:03:47.220> stick<00:03:47.489> to<00:03:47.760> track

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
and I usually tend to stick to track

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.390 
and I usually tend to stick to track
suits<00:03:48.479> and<00:03:48.720> whatnot<00:03:49.169> so<00:03:49.349> by<00:03:49.889> wearing<00:03:50.129> this

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
suits and whatnot so by wearing this

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:51.949 
suits and whatnot so by wearing this
you're<00:03:50.639> a<00:03:50.699> little<00:03:50.909> bit<00:03:51.030> more<00:03:51.269> dressed<00:03:51.569> up<00:03:51.750> for

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:53.899 
you're a little bit more dressed up for
school<00:03:52.169> but<00:03:52.379> you're<00:03:52.500> so<00:03:52.769> very<00:03:53.010> comfy<00:03:53.489> casual

another great aspect of this outfit is

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.040

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:24.629 
the color of the cardigan I really like
how<00:04:23.169> it<00:04:23.229> just<00:04:23.470> adds<00:04:23.620> a<00:04:23.800> bright<00:04:24.009> pop<00:04:24.250> of<00:04:24.280> color

00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:24.639 
how it just adds a bright pop of color

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:26.580 
how it just adds a bright pop of color
but<00:04:24.729> it's<00:04:25.060> not<00:04:25.210> overly<00:04:25.840> bright<00:04:26.199> because

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590
