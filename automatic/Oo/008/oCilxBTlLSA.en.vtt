 for this delicious recipe we are going to 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:12.660
 need lasagna pasta pepperoni 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.940
 pizza sauce and grated cheese first 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.619
 that there is nothing to cook our meat and 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.320
 We are going to be placing ground beef 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.029
 already marinated in a container with water 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.910
 boiling until it is totally 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:29.130
 cooked at the same time we will be 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:31.140
 boiling already the pasta since the meat 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.780
 milled is fully cooked let's 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.059
 remove excess water and fat and 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.710
 then we will put the ground meat 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:39.710
 again in the pan to brown the 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:44.310
 after the pasta has boiled 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.800
 we are going to place it as we are seeing in 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:50.510
 the video in a circular way so that it 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.510
 make us much easier to close it 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:57.559
 then we will be placing the meat 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:01:00.110
 crushed bottles and cheese and 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:01.699
 I'm also going to be using sauce 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:04.729
 few that peron and because I do not 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:06.909
 like it a lot but you do it to your 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:06.909
 taste 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:24.340
 we may have finished filling 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.350
 our pizza lasagna let's proceed to 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.740
 close it the way it looks in the 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.740
 video 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.490
 more pieces of pasta are used better 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.170
 still so that you do not leave any 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.230
 part on the outside then you will be 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:46.200
 placing the sauce the cheese and 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:48.600
 pepperoni above as always and 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.810
 then you will put it in the oven in 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.890
 400 degrees approximately 20 minutes 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.890
 equal to 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:00.200
