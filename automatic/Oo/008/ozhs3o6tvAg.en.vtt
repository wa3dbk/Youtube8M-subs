community defenses because it just takes
more<00:00:27.240> missiles<00:00:27.660> which<00:00:27.840> means<00:00:28.050> you<00:00:28.140> can't

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
more missiles which means you can't

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.389 
more missiles which means you can't

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
defense video if you saw it I was able

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.670 
defense video if you saw it I was able
to<00:00:36.000> get<00:00:36.180> two<00:00:36.390> or<00:00:36.540> three<00:00:36.719> in<00:00:36.809> single<00:00:37.079> fly<00:00:37.260> by<00:00:37.440> I

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.350 
to get two or three in single fly by I
did<00:00:38.100> manage<00:00:38.309> to<00:00:38.399> get<00:00:38.550> one<00:00:38.790> here<00:00:39.149> by<00:00:39.300> spamming

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
did manage to get one here by spamming

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.299 
did manage to get one here by spamming
on<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:39.870> very<00:00:40.200> first<00:00:40.530> frigate<00:00:40.860> that<00:00:41.100> was<00:00:41.219> in

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
on the very first frigate that was in

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.700 
on the very first frigate that was in
range<00:00:41.550> but<00:00:42.239> a<00:00:42.270> lot<00:00:42.480> of<00:00:42.540> that's<00:00:42.629> luck<00:00:43.079> I<00:00:43.290> mean<00:00:43.559> I

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
range but a lot of that's luck I mean I

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.160 
range but a lot of that's luck I mean I
don't<00:00:43.770> always<00:00:44.340> get<00:00:44.670> a<00:00:45.149> shield<00:00:45.690> drainer<00:00:45.899> on<00:00:46.050> my

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
don't always get a shield drainer on my

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.810 
don't always get a shield drainer on my
first<00:00:46.379> or<00:00:46.649> even<00:00:46.710> my<00:00:46.890> second<00:00:47.280> pass<00:00:47.520> in<00:00:47.760> the

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
first or even my second pass in the

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.700 
first or even my second pass in the
frigates<00:00:48.149> so<00:00:48.360> it<00:00:49.079> does<00:00:49.200> take<00:00:49.230> a<00:00:49.379> little<00:00:49.469> bit<00:00:49.590> of

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
frigates so it does take a little bit of

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.590 
frigates so it does take a little bit of
extra<00:00:49.829> concentration<00:00:50.640> to<00:00:50.700> get<00:00:50.820> it<00:00:50.910> here<00:00:51.120> the

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
extra concentration to get it here the

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.529 
extra concentration to get it here the
other<00:00:51.780> thing<00:00:52.050> destroying<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:53.329> capital<00:00:54.329> ship

other thing destroying the capital ship

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.479 
other thing destroying the capital ship
bridge<00:00:54.870> it's<00:00:55.260> equally<00:00:55.739> impossible<00:00:56.070> here

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
bridge it's equally impossible here

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.069 
bridge it's equally impossible here
unfortunately<00:00:56.579> it's<00:00:57.239> there's<00:00:57.780> just<00:00:57.960> not

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
unfortunately it's there's just not

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.840 
unfortunately it's there's just not
enough<00:00:58.140> time<00:00:58.350> as<00:00:59.160> far<00:00:59.340> as<00:00:59.370> I<00:00:59.489> can<00:00:59.550> tell<00:00:59.640> it's

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
enough time as far as I can tell it's

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.639 
enough time as far as I can tell it's
impossible<00:01:00.300> I<00:01:00.329> mean<00:01:00.449> if<00:01:00.539> you<00:01:00.629> can<00:01:00.899> do<00:01:01.350> it<00:01:01.530> and

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
impossible I mean if you can do it and

make a video of it I would love it i
would<00:01:03.449> definitely<00:01:03.690> feature<00:01:03.960> here<00:01:04.290> but<00:01:05.210> as<00:01:06.210> far

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
would definitely feature here but as far

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.640 
would definitely feature here but as far
as<00:01:06.420> i<00:01:06.540> know<00:01:06.630> it's<00:01:06.780> impossible<00:01:06.990> to<00:01:07.229> destroy<00:01:07.530> the

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
as i know it's impossible to destroy the

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
torpedo of course because there's just

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.219 
torpedo of course because there's just
not<00:01:10.740> enough<00:01:10.799> time<00:01:11.299> spent<00:01:12.299> assaulting<00:01:12.869> it<00:01:12.960> and

not enough time spent assaulting it and

not enough time spent assaulting it and
there's<00:01:13.920> a<00:01:13.979> few<00:01:14.100> times<00:01:14.340> when<00:01:14.460> you<00:01:14.549> think<00:01:14.790> you

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
there's a few times when you think you

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.280 
there's a few times when you think you
can<00:01:15.060> attack<00:01:15.330> it<00:01:15.360> but<00:01:15.600> it's<00:01:15.689> being<00:01:15.840> blocked<00:01:16.020> by

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.230 
can attack it but it's being blocked by
something<00:01:16.650> it's<00:01:16.890> really<00:01:17.040> annoying<00:01:17.250> but<00:01:18.119> it's

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
something it's really annoying but it's

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.370 
something it's really annoying but it's
the<00:01:18.360> same<00:01:18.540> here<00:01:18.750> it's<00:01:18.840> just<00:01:18.990> as<00:01:19.080> it<00:01:19.200> isn't

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.140 
interceptor they just take a few hits
from<00:01:28.650> your<00:01:28.799> blasters<00:01:29.220> like<00:01:29.369> maybe<00:01:29.700> just<00:01:29.939> two

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
from your blasters like maybe just two

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.149 
from your blasters like maybe just two
seconds<00:01:30.509> of<00:01:30.630> sustained<00:01:30.960> fire<00:01:31.200> or<00:01:31.470> a<00:01:31.530> couple

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
seconds of sustained fire or a couple

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.140 
seconds of sustained fire or a couple
missiles<00:01:32.549> so<00:01:33.479> they're<00:01:33.600> not<00:01:33.720> a<00:01:33.780> problem

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.150 
missiles so they're not a problem

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:36.800

there someone pop my right there I just
pop<00:01:56.100> my<00:01:56.219> warfare<00:01:56.579> mod<00:01:56.759> the<00:01:56.909> reason<00:01:57.119> is<00:01:57.240> that

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
pop my warfare mod the reason is that

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.490 
pop my warfare mod the reason is that
this<00:01:57.420> fury<00:01:57.659> class<00:01:57.899> ship<00:01:58.079> does<00:01:58.229> a<00:01:58.290> lot<00:01:58.439> of

this fury class ship does a lot of

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.830 
this fury class ship does a lot of
damage<00:01:58.770> so<00:01:59.189> I<00:01:59.399> just<00:02:00.030> wanted<00:02:00.270> you<00:02:00.479> know<00:02:00.630> not

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
damage so I just wanted you know not

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.780 
damage so I just wanted you know not
even<00:02:00.899> risk<00:02:01.320> it<00:02:01.439> so<00:02:01.890> there<00:02:02.070> we<00:02:02.130> go<00:02:02.250> notice<00:02:02.729> that

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
even risk it so there we go notice that

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.069 
even risk it so there we go notice that
my<00:02:02.969> shields<00:02:03.270> aren't<00:02:03.420> even<00:02:03.600> down<00:02:03.719> all<00:02:03.869> the<00:02:03.960> way

generator still left on this frigate so

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.270 
generator still left on this frigate so
I<00:02:30.780> just<00:02:31.080> spammed<00:02:31.350> everything<00:02:31.680> I<00:02:31.770> have<00:02:31.920> at<00:02:32.100> it

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.100 

and<00:02:35.280> there<00:02:35.880> we<00:02:35.970> go<00:02:36.000> the<00:02:36.360> last<00:02:36.540> one<00:02:36.720> god<00:02:36.840> i<00:02:36.870> think

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
and there we go the last one god i think

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:38.870 
and there we go the last one god i think
it's<00:02:37.200> i<00:02:37.350> think<00:02:37.380> it<00:02:37.560> is<00:02:37.620> five<00:02:37.890> missiles<00:02:38.700> /

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
it's i think it is five missiles /

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.330 
it's i think it is five missiles /
generator<00:02:39.260> that's<00:02:40.260> why<00:02:40.470> it<00:02:40.530> takes<00:02:40.740> a<00:02:41.010> little

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
generator that's why it takes a little

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.520 
generator that's why it takes a little
bit<00:02:41.460> longer<00:02:41.670> than<00:02:41.910> before<00:02:42.170> this<00:02:43.170> was<00:02:43.320> a<00:02:43.380> pretty

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
bit longer than before this was a pretty

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.500 
bit longer than before this was a pretty
smooth<00:02:43.920> run<00:02:44.250> i<00:02:44.280> mean<00:02:44.610> i<00:02:44.790> don't<00:02:45.000> always<00:02:45.270> get<00:02:45.420> it

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
smooth run i mean i don't always get it

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:46.820 
smooth run i mean i don't always get it
done<00:02:45.630> too<00:02:45.720> smoothly<00:02:46.020> sometimes<00:02:46.440> i<00:02:46.530> don't<00:02:46.590> get

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
done too smoothly sometimes i don't get

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.490

of course your store the turrets in the

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.100 
of course your store the turrets in the
capital<00:03:12.150> ship<00:03:12.270> you<00:03:12.390> don't<00:03:12.540> get<00:03:12.630> any<00:03:12.780> bonus

capital ship you don't get any bonus
mission<00:03:13.410> for<00:03:13.560> that<00:03:13.650> unfortunately<00:03:14.160> and<00:03:14.400> you

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300

mission for that unfortunately and you
can<00:03:15.420> also<00:03:15.540> destroy<00:03:15.870> the<00:03:15.990> rest<00:03:16.170> of<00:03:16.230> the<00:03:16.290> targets

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
can also destroy the rest of the targets

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.050 
can also destroy the rest of the targets
on<00:03:16.650> these<00:03:16.740> frigates<00:03:17.100> just<00:03:17.400> to<00:03:17.550> take<00:03:17.730> the

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
on these frigates just to take the

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:19.760 
on these frigates just to take the
pressure<00:03:18.300> off<00:03:18.450> of<00:03:18.660> you<00:03:18.750> because<00:03:19.110> the<00:03:19.260> turrets

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:19.770 
pressure off of you because the turrets

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:21.740 
pressure off of you because the turrets
on<00:03:19.920> frigates<00:03:20.280> do<00:03:20.430> a<00:03:20.460> lot<00:03:20.880> of<00:03:20.910> damage<00:03:21.210> if

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
on frigates do a lot of damage if

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.870 
on frigates do a lot of damage if
they're<00:03:22.110> allowed<00:03:22.380> to<00:03:22.440> which<00:03:22.890> is<00:03:23.040> fire<00:03:23.280> fire<00:03:23.850> a

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
they're allowed to which is fire fire a

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.350 
they're allowed to which is fire fire a
you<00:03:24.060> at<00:03:24.210> will<00:03:24.420> and<00:03:24.660> i<00:03:25.590> wasn't<00:03:25.910> may<00:03:26.910> be<00:03:26.970> as

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 
you at will and i wasn't may be as

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:28.880 
you at will and i wasn't may be as
vigilant<00:03:27.870> about<00:03:28.140> destroying<00:03:28.500> those<00:03:28.620> as<00:03:28.800> I

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
vigilant about destroying those as I

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:30.020 
vigilant about destroying those as I
needed<00:03:29.160> to<00:03:29.250> be<00:03:29.340> I<00:03:29.370> just<00:03:29.640> focus<00:03:29.880> on<00:03:29.910> the

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
needed to be I just focus on the

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:31.970 
needed to be I just focus on the
generators<00:03:30.480> and<00:03:30.660> the<00:03:30.750> Bombers<00:03:31.140> and<00:03:31.380> that's

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
generators and the Bombers and that's

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:33.410 
generators and the Bombers and that's
about<00:03:32.100> it<00:03:32.220> so<00:03:32.820> I<00:03:32.850> guess<00:03:33.030> you<00:03:33.150> could<00:03:33.180> say<00:03:33.390> I

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
about it so I guess you could say I

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:34.880 
about it so I guess you could say I
could<00:03:33.570> execute<00:03:33.780> this<00:03:33.990> a<00:03:34.050> little<00:03:34.320> better<00:03:34.470> but<00:03:34.710> I

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
could execute this a little better but I

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:36.410 
could execute this a little better but I
mean<00:03:35.100> it's<00:03:35.400> plain<00:03:35.670> to<00:03:35.700> beat<00:03:35.970> the<00:03:36.060> mission<00:03:36.330> and

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
mean it's plain to beat the mission and

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:37.460 
mean it's plain to beat the mission and
all<00:03:36.510> the<00:03:36.600> bonus<00:03:36.870> from<00:03:37.020> all<00:03:37.140> the<00:03:37.230> bonus

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
all the bonus from all the bonus

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.040 
all the bonus from all the bonus
missions<00:03:37.770> and<00:03:38.120> have<00:03:39.120> about<00:03:39.330> half<00:03:39.540> health<00:03:39.840> at

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:40.050 
missions and have about half health at

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:41.720 
missions and have about half health at
the<00:03:40.170> end<00:03:40.290> see<00:03:40.890> I<00:03:40.920> just<00:03:40.950> too<00:03:41.220> much<00:03:41.370> damage<00:03:41.640> I

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
the end see I just too much damage I

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.550 
the end see I just too much damage I
took<00:03:41.790> I<00:03:42.060> was<00:03:42.270> at<00:03:42.450> right<00:03:43.110> when<00:03:43.260> I<00:03:43.320> started

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
took I was at right when I started

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:44.930 
took I was at right when I started
talking<00:03:43.709> about<00:03:43.980> the<00:03:44.190> friggin<00:03:44.430> the<00:03:44.520> turrets<00:03:44.850> I

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
talking about the friggin the turrets I

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.820 
talking about the friggin the turrets I
was<00:03:45.060> at<00:03:45.240> like<00:03:45.870> eighty<00:03:46.080> percent<00:03:46.260> and<00:03:46.620> I<00:03:46.680> just

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:46.830 
was at like eighty percent and I just

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:48.170 
was at like eighty percent and I just
dropped<00:03:47.070> down<00:03:47.190> to<00:03:47.250> just<00:03:47.430> over<00:03:47.580> half<00:03:47.850> and<00:03:48.120> the

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
dropped down to just over half and the

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:49.730 
dropped down to just over half and the
reason<00:03:48.450> was<00:03:48.570> I<00:03:48.630> passed<00:03:48.959> up<00:03:49.170> a<00:03:49.320> frigate<00:03:49.620> that

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:49.740 
reason was I passed up a frigate that

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:51.500 
reason was I passed up a frigate that
had<00:03:49.830> full<00:03:50.040> turrets<00:03:50.400> and<00:03:50.520> just<00:03:50.730> lit<00:03:51.000> me<00:03:51.120> up<00:03:51.150> and

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
had full turrets and just lit me up and

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:53.600 
had full turrets and just lit me up and
took<00:03:52.230> off<00:03:52.380> that<00:03:52.530> much<00:03:52.650> health<00:03:52.890> this<00:03:53.340> was<00:03:53.490> with

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
took off that much health this was with

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:56.270 
took off that much health this was with
the<00:03:53.730> full<00:03:53.940> grade<00:03:54.300> 5<00:03:54.510> upgrades<00:03:54.930> to<00:03:55.200> you<00:03:56.130> can

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
the full grade 5 upgrades to you can

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:01.520 
the full grade 5 upgrades to you can
imagine<00:03:56.490> how<00:03:56.990> much<00:03:57.990> damage<00:03:58.200> it<00:03:58.410> is

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.960 

now<00:04:02.530> this<00:04:02.650> is<00:04:02.800> the<00:04:02.830> only<00:04:03.010> attack<00:04:03.430> run<00:04:03.670> you<00:04:03.790> get

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 
now this is the only attack run you get

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:06.090 
now this is the only attack run you get
on<00:04:04.060> the<00:04:04.150> capital<00:04:04.450> ship<00:04:04.630> bridge<00:04:04.870> I<00:04:05.110> decide<00:04:06.070> not

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:06.100 
on the capital ship bridge I decide not

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:08.790 
on the capital ship bridge I decide not
even<00:04:06.430> to<00:04:06.820> waste<00:04:07.000> my<00:04:07.150> time<00:04:07.360> with<00:04:07.570> it<00:04:07.650> I'm<00:04:08.650> just

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:08.800 
even to waste my time with it I'm just

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.350 
even to waste my time with it I'm just
gonna<00:04:08.890> blow<00:04:09.040> turns<00:04:09.370> instead<00:04:09.700> and<00:04:09.880> maybe<00:04:10.120> blow

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:10.360 
gonna blow turns instead and maybe blow

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:11.760 
gonna blow turns instead and maybe blow
of<00:04:10.420> a<00:04:10.480> shield<00:04:10.690> generator<00:04:10.990> I<00:04:11.200> even<00:04:11.470> get<00:04:11.560> it<00:04:11.680> is

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:11.770 
of a shield generator I even get it is

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:13.440 
of a shield generator I even get it is
hard<00:04:11.950> to<00:04:11.980> tell<00:04:12.190> because<00:04:12.640> if<00:04:12.880> I<00:04:12.940> did<00:04:13.090> it<00:04:13.240> happen

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:13.450 
hard to tell because if I did it happen

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:22.520 
hard to tell because if I did it happen
off-screen

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:22.530 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:24.779 

yeah<00:04:23.530> I<00:04:23.560> believe<00:04:24.009> this<00:04:24.099> is<00:04:24.189> the<00:04:24.249> last<00:04:24.460> wave<00:04:24.669> of

00:04:24.779 --> 00:04:24.789 
yeah I believe this is the last wave of

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:29.790 
yeah I believe this is the last wave of
bombers<00:04:25.120> or<00:04:25.300> close<00:04:25.479> to<00:04:25.659> it

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.580

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:50.870 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:53.320 

yep<00:04:51.870> now<00:04:52.110> we<00:04:52.199> can<00:04:52.260> just<00:04:52.350> drift<00:04:52.620> off<00:04:52.740> into<00:04:52.889> space

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:53.330 
yep now we can just drift off into space
