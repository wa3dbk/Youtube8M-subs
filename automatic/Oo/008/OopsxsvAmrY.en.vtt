00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.730
 it continues with the success or with 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:08.069
 the group of spirits in the machine of 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.900
 Assassin's creed II around this one 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.120
 success or trophy 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.210
 that's just 15 computers 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.809
 at abstergo entertainment hedge so 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.809
 in the present 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:27.210
 and first of all, you have to do it 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.859
 in the present and I say now 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:33.090
 or no idea 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:36.059
 he just goes to quit menus and then 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:40.320
 animus then leave country here 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:44.399
 abstergo entertainment here before yours 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.360
 desk and now you have to go in here 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.610
 the building 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:51.000
 15 chop computer you already have 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:53.940
 a few hacked during the campaign 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.640
 and now just a few more here 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.350
 because everywhere are distributed anyway more than 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.379
 15 I believe you already have three four 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:06.980
 Everyone already has five of them 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:11.970
 automatically through the main story 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:18.780
 so accurate and there are two now 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:20.970
 different types of hacks once here 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:24.810
 So always go to the computer and 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.730
 then interact with that and then apply 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.800
 just a little children's puzzle 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:31.530
 none of you should solve it again 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.610
 a problem have take some here 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.730
 some a bit longer some a bit 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:38.190
 less a bit shorter but im 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:40.950
 the end effect is all relatively simple 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:44.400
 that was the first kind from the back and that 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.170
 here is the second one down left 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:49.440
 Your card can also be selected 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:53.100
 or press america to call if 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:56.070
 I'll just knows and that is the 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:59.100
 you also do not have a second kind of tail 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.570
 Also, everything was not very special 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.430
 difficult and demanding everything completely 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.080
 easy 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:07.610
 maybe it will take two three attempts 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.610
 but then it should actually work 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:22.800
 and then if you do that 15 times 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.720
 you always get what stays there 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:28.890
 then left is computer directly 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:31.080
 15 33 and the topic where I have 15 now 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.760
 piece that was already the 15 comes with it 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:36.180
 her 10 gamerscore or one 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:38.790
 bronze trophy because just 15 computers in 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:42.930
 the present has hacked and now 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:45.170
 can you and her general on the 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.489
 card look here now they are gone 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:51.090
 ddp direct if a computer hacked 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:54.180
 then the disappear 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:56.280
 so to speak of the map here 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.540
 Over there more if any 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.670
 you can not make it over there 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:03.769
 make free or the building is then 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.769
 also bigger anyway
