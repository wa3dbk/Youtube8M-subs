00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
take this and we're going to make two

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.070 
take this and we're going to make two
holes<00:01:10.380> with<00:01:11.159> this<00:01:11.310> there<00:01:12.090> are<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.420> center<00:01:12.869> I

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
holes with this there are the center I

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.380 
holes with this there are the center I
mean<00:01:13.439> they're<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.680> same<00:01:13.860> size<00:01:14.100> as<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.970> inside

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
mean they're the same size as the inside

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.600 
mean they're the same size as the inside
of<00:01:15.420> this<00:01:15.740> so<00:01:16.740> we're<00:01:16.860> gonna<00:01:16.979> basically<00:01:17.250> place

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
of this so we're gonna basically place

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.649 
of this so we're gonna basically place
that<00:01:17.909> and<00:01:18.240> we're<00:01:18.360> gonna<00:01:19.700> eyeball<00:01:20.700> it<00:01:20.970> and<00:01:21.360> make

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
that and we're gonna eyeball it and make

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.090 
that and we're gonna eyeball it and make
a<00:01:21.689> hole<00:01:21.960> like<00:01:21.990> that<00:01:22.350> and<00:01:22.680> then<00:01:22.830> you'll<00:01:22.950> see<00:01:23.040> you

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
a hole like that and then you'll see you

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.670 
a hole like that and then you'll see you
leading<00:01:23.250> with<00:01:23.400> s4<00:01:23.759> okay<00:01:24.540> so<00:01:24.600> now<00:01:25.049> when<00:01:25.290> you<00:01:25.500> got

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
leading with s4 okay so now when you got

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.289 
leading with s4 okay so now when you got
a<00:01:26.119> hole<00:01:27.119> cut<00:01:27.450> out<00:01:28.400> you're<00:01:29.400> gonna<00:01:29.490> size<00:01:29.820> it<00:01:30.119> so

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
a hole cut out you're gonna size it so

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.429 
a hole cut out you're gonna size it so
it<00:01:30.450> fits<00:01:31.549> right<00:01:32.549> down<00:01:32.790> there<00:01:33.060> and<00:01:33.659> then<00:01:34.350> what

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
it fits right down there and then what

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:35.870 
it fits right down there and then what
you're<00:01:34.560> gonna<00:01:34.650> do<00:01:34.920> you're<00:01:35.340> gonna<00:01:35.520> make

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
you're gonna do you're gonna make

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.050 
you're gonna do you're gonna make
another<00:01:36.150> hole<00:01:36.450> in<00:01:37.130> center<00:01:38.130> so<00:01:38.520> it<00:01:38.759> will<00:01:38.880> just

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
another hole in center so it will just

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.429 
another hole in center so it will just
slide<00:01:39.240> onto<00:01:39.570> this<00:01:39.930> and<00:01:40.579> uh<00:01:41.840> on<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:42.990> tube<00:01:43.200> here

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
slide onto this and uh on the tube here

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:49.420 
slide onto this and uh on the tube here
alright<00:01:44.509> make<00:01:45.509> sure<00:01:45.630> you<00:01:45.720> make<00:01:45.869> two<00:01:46.049> of<00:01:46.140> them

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.430
