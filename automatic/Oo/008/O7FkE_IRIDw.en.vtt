00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:13.329 
and now she's here yeah I still feel she

00:02:13.329 --> 00:02:24.900

could<00:02:13.450> go<00:02:13.599> more<00:02:13.840> though<00:02:14.049> but<00:02:14.500> we're<00:02:14.680> not<00:02:23.910> good

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
could go more though but we're not good

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.170 
could go more though but we're not good
lots<00:02:25.629> of<00:02:25.780> movement
