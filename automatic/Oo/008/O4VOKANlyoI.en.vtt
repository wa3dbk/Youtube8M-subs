00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:46.460 
by the way I'm I've just realized that

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:48.760 
by the way I'm I've just realized that
you<00:02:46.730> can<00:02:46.880> put<00:02:47.060> the<00:02:47.240> you<00:02:47.690> can<00:02:47.840> put<00:02:47.990> for<00:02:48.170> recon<00:02:48.530> um

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:48.770 
you can put the you can put for recon um

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:50.710 
you can put the you can put for recon um
you<00:02:49.370> can<00:02:49.520> put<00:02:49.640> the<00:02:49.730> recon<00:02:50.090> head<00:02:50.300> thing<00:02:50.570> up

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
you can put the recon head thing up

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.710 
you can put the recon head thing up
there<00:02:50.750> the<00:02:51.530> reconyx<00:02:51.890> extends<00:02:52.850> extension<00:02:53.540> up

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
there the reconyx extends extension up

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.020 
there the reconyx extends extension up
onto<00:02:54.230> the<00:02:54.380> into<00:02:55.010> this<00:02:55.100> barrel<00:02:55.520> but<00:02:56.000> I

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
onto the into this barrel but I

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:57.940 
onto the into this barrel but I
definitely<00:02:56.240> wouldn't<00:02:57.110> recommend<00:02:57.560> it<00:02:57.709> close

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
definitely wouldn't recommend it close

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.850 
definitely wouldn't recommend it close
like<00:02:58.220> you<00:02:58.730> put<00:02:58.970> the<00:02:59.090> barrel<00:02:59.270> on<00:02:59.540> it<00:02:59.600> um<00:02:59.900> it

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
like you put the barrel on it um it

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:03.400 
like you put the barrel on it um it
would<00:03:00.980> definitely<00:03:01.810> reduce<00:03:02.810> the<00:03:02.959> range<00:03:03.170> of

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 
would definitely reduce the range of

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:07.720 
would definitely reduce the range of
your<00:03:03.560> gun<00:03:03.770> so<00:03:04.930> yes<00:03:05.930> and<00:03:06.200> this<00:03:06.290> gun<00:03:06.500> has<00:03:06.530> a<00:03:06.770> to
