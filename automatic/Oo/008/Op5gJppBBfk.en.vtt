level<00:00:41.100> there<00:00:41.700> was<00:00:41.850> a<00:00:41.879> little<00:00:42.059> bit<00:00:42.239> of<00:00:42.300> a<00:00:42.390> tense

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
level there was a little bit of a tense

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.630 
level there was a little bit of a tense
edge<00:00:42.960> that<00:00:43.260> just<00:00:43.469> would<00:00:43.770> not<00:00:44.010> release

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
edge that just would not release

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.490 
edge that just would not release
throughout<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.180> his<00:00:45.329> entire<00:00:45.629> tenure<00:00:45.899> how

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
throughout the his entire tenure how

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.900 
throughout the his entire tenure how
frige<00:00:46.770> certainly<00:00:47.190> is<00:00:47.280> not<00:00:47.370> going<00:00:47.489> to<00:00:47.579> go<00:00:47.700> soft

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
frige certainly is not going to go soft

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.760 
frige certainly is not going to go soft
with<00:00:48.180> this<00:00:48.300> team<00:00:48.480> but<00:00:48.660> at<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:49.079> same<00:00:49.289> time<00:00:49.500> he's

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
with this team but at the same time he's

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.260 
with this team but at the same time he's
just<00:00:49.829> a<00:00:50.039> little<00:00:50.340> more<00:00:50.460> of<00:00:50.579> a<00:00:50.640> player's<00:00:50.940> coach

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270

just a little more of a player's coach
and<00:00:51.539> I<00:00:51.570> think<00:00:51.780> things<00:00:51.960> are<00:00:52.020> going<00:00:52.140> to<00:00:52.230> just

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
and I think things are going to just

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:53.840 
and I think things are going to just
chill<00:00:52.680> out<00:00:52.710> just<00:00:53.010> a<00:00:53.100> little<00:00:53.129> bit<00:00:53.489> just<00:00:53.730> enough
