because it's otherwise it's get tiring
mentally<00:02:21.650> and<00:02:21.830> you<00:02:22.220> need<00:02:22.370> your<00:02:22.550> mind<00:02:22.819> to<00:02:22.970> be

lot<00:02:34.310> of<00:02:34.430> the<00:02:34.489> times<00:02:34.760> what<00:02:35.000> we<00:02:35.120> try<00:02:35.269> to<00:02:35.299> do<00:02:35.480> is

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630 
lot of the times what we try to do is

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:38.350 
lot of the times what we try to do is
just<00:02:36.200> change<00:02:36.410> the<00:02:36.650> monotony<00:02:37.160> so<00:02:37.549> change<00:02:38.180> up

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
just change the monotony so change up

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.150 
just change the monotony so change up
the<00:02:38.480> training<00:02:38.870> so<00:02:39.079> that<00:02:39.260> actually<00:02:39.620> gives<00:02:39.650> a

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
the training so that actually gives a

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.400 
the training so that actually gives a
bit<00:02:40.489> of<00:02:40.610> mental<00:02:40.940> precious<00:02:41.390> and<00:02:41.660> a<00:02:42.079> bit<00:02:42.290> of<00:02:42.380> that
