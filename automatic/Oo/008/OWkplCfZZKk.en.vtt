00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.990
 on the program anime studio pro 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.480
 I take it off while my computer 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.730
 not completely broke down in this lesson 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.160
 tell you about this notice thing as 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.680
 the character wizard click here 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:20.720
 us hiding a little window like us 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:23.609
 see here is such a bald character we have 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:25.859
 here we can choose a character 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:29.279
 which are already there and coming from it 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:31.760
 can edit it i will choose here 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.760
 of this 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:37.780
 characters can also add them 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:40.600
 characters and there we want to edit 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:43.690
 save it to use often 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:46.500
 they click here here and called 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:49.449
 call our character 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:53.800
 also now we can customize it 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:58.739
 There is a pitch body pitch than pitch 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:01:00.360
 any width of the abdomen in this case 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:05.309
 but 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:08.010
 length but all that leg hand I also here 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.840
 There are already made settings, that is, how 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.460
 we see us runet now sneakers 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.060
 such 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.060
 I will do 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:23.440
 boots on u poland the same thing 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:25.150
 for comparison, that's not clear 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.280
 what 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:30.250
 in general, yes there are a lot of settings and we can 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.530
 it is also very interesting to regulate 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:35.050
 the same with the hands can be here then you 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:37.720
 make boxing gloves 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:39.340
 and what else is remarkable in the master 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.990
 characters what he is working 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:46.120
 character from all sides that is and with 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:49.840
 front with a demigod alphabet there behind and all 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:50.490
 about mirror then if we want but if 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.320
 we are lazy 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.150
 quickly do the characters then we can click 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:57.600
 random and our character is done 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:57.600
 random house 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:08.520
 well but we clearly move on after 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:09.450
 we tuned our body we move to 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:14.220
 setting up a sailor 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:18.440
 there are different types of faces here are completely different 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:21.080
 and we can set up here 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:24.170
 our face adjusts our rod our nose 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:26.920
 our head our eyes are very many 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.920
 any settings 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:35.520
 and after that we can build like ours 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:38.300
 eyes mouth us way to be 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:42.510
 Regarding the head, that is, the above 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:44.700
 next we can make our movement 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:48.060
 characters customize 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:51.810
 walking jump kick and 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:55.080
 well a hand sign but this is a sense of greeting 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:58.489
 or vice versa goodbye then we can 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:00.989
 set up the whole thing that is a body a 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:04.260
 how often will he walk 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:05.599
 time that is how fast what 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.640
 will be 

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:10.920
 that 's how it will upset with his foot 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:13.260
 I will show here how we see it so 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.750
 throws them away throws everything 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:19.440
 let's make it so it stands still 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:21.420
 and as if not even falling in love can also 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:24.690
 height raise her legs do that is 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:28.540
 generally will lift up the belly not 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:31.180
 very cool or not at all 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.469
 the span of the arms that is generally not here 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:37.670
 looks like and 

00:03:32.469 --> 00:03:40.430
 and in general the country and the slope of the body 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:44.480
 that is, without slope and slightly slope 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:45.380
 and with a sharp inclination in general is tun tun tun 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.319
 tun 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:51.220
 Well, I understand what we can do with 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:53.480
 other species except those that 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:57.010
 automatically configured and give themselves 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:04:00.410
 configure let's say like a wave of your hand 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:02.840
 next is the clothes we can this she 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:04.670
 shorts that's us t-shirt we can 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:07.959
 make our shorts long or 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:11.690
 short of that leg and no shorts and 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:14.299
 do our t-shirt too either 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:18.570
 T-shirt any hands 

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:23.870
 after that we can adjust the light 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:27.509
 our trouser and color of our t-shirt 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:31.139
 I think it is clear after that we can 

00:04:27.509 --> 00:04:36.320
 adjust the skin itself i mean skin color 

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:42.270
 hair and contour color their skin last 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:47.940
 rozier there everything is the same we can 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:51.210
 adjust the hair color and contours of our 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:54.530
 bodies why can we adjust the width 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:58.490
 contours or reset them 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:05:00.900
 do not reset and put as 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:05.070
 default settings ie constantly 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:07.530
 the contour will have a width of contours 3 after 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:10.430
 we can choose random from this 

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:10.430
 extended line 

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:18.710
 and scale on our working field 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:18.710
 after that we press ok and 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:22.770
 what happens with us this character 

00:05:20.789 --> 00:05:25.289
 transferred to our working field we 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:28.289
 here we see a lot now 

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:30.840
 bones and we can from all sides of it 

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:34.439
 now manipulate him ie hands 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:36.060
 here we move and that's all cool with us 

00:05:34.439 --> 00:05:37.860
 everything looks like something very much all 

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:41.210
 worked out and this is all very cool 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:44.900
 Looks like if you put 100 for a long time 

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:48.210
 truly cool character but I think is clear 

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:50.969
 the unit master characters told on 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:53.219
 this is our lesson coming to an end thanks for 

00:05:50.969 --> 00:05:56.210
 viewing thanks for watching everyone 

00:05:53.219 --> 00:05:56.210
 thank you all bye
