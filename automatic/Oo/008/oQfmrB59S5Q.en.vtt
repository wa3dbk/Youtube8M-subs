00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.170
 tell them that I ask for an apology 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.660
 since I do not upload videos in more than 10 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.940
 days but the reasons were many in 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.590
 first I went on vacation after I 

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:33.480
 I think sick and even now I'm still 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.280
 sick then if the voice is heard 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.110

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.670
 but the finger and grow that pack open 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.699

 for time remove limit it 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:54.530

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.820
 they want to buy coins on the page that 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.340

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.200
 good people let's start the video of 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.090
 today and we go there and then again here 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.370
 we have the team of the week that we 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:22.610
 presented today there are players 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:25.310
 interesting and others not so much me the day 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.740
 today I would like to look for de gea well 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.540
 like a rooney it would not be bad the truth 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.750
 obviously I think rooney is the best 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:34.310
 of the whole team and here we have 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.979
 all those who present us in the eleven 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:39.150
 initial as well as their respective 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:41.400
 banking 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.940
 there are also founders good fliers 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:48.060
 He is a great player but good people for 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:51.300
 not be longer this video we go on 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.370
 look for those guys that if they're good I'll 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.770
 to open four packages of these from the 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:58.080
 of 15 thousand and already what I get with 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.630
 discard something sold or sell some 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:03.060
 player of something that has left me I will 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.610
 buy some 7,500 to see what 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:08.510
 it comes out to us and nothing people go with the 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.510
 first sachet 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:15.060
 Let's see if something good comes out 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.520
 I hope so 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.650
 not even if it's not a guy you say something 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.110
 can be seen at least for 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:27.140
 retrieve the novels so let's go to the 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:27.140
 people first men the little ball and 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:33.090
 and we always start badly in this kind of 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:36.870
 things 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:39.900
 we have not had absolutely anything 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.730
 and I hope to get it is the hand of the 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.790
 What are they 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.129
 twice as big but good 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.140
 mode 

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:51.030
 second about let's the people we wait 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.980
 what will there be if something good comes out so 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.769
 less with the one of today although it is not scams 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.940
 decision but something that costs is a 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:03:00.490
 little expensive at least 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:04.630
 OMG 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:06.340
 nothing nothing people because this happens to me 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:07.870
 nothing is touching me 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.370
 I never get anything in reality and I 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.550
 I have few coins 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:14.850
 I have so many coins 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:17.760
 his mouth more for colleagues of this one but 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:19.070
 I also do not have the best luck 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.560
 of the world 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:24.060
 third about people the last one we're going to 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.970
 open of those of 15 thousand and already 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:29.780
 later because to live of 7 500 they go 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.780
 Let's see what's up 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:38.349
 new to touch anything 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:38.349
 Good vibes on books 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:45.430
 crash 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:49.200
 I do not know how much it sells could give 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.200
 in the game of 10,000 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.100
 now we know checking agreement when 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:55.770
 cost 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:04:00.210
 but good cross 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:02.340
 it's something something is something 

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:05.250
 when about people come from rooms 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:08.610
 about the fourth envelope we have seven 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:10.670
 of the ten that they give us 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:13.390
 my god we see that something good comes out 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:15.310
 please 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:20.579
 ros has been the best thing that has come out 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:20.579
 so I can tell you our things 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:27.210
 I think I'm line and fellaini fellini 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.210
 sells for something 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:37.229
 croatia the best I will buy zinc 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:39.569
 urgent to eat 5 and I do not know how many of 

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:42.689
 7,500 I'm going to buy 5 to move away 

00:04:39.569 --> 00:04:46.919
 this a little better 

00:04:42.689 --> 00:04:48.330
 the hopes here so the last 

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:53.120
 about 15 thousand coins that I will come 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:55.569
 people and then I saw if I open 7,500 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:58.449
 or if we do not already leave it like this 

00:04:55.569 --> 00:05:01.800
 results is bad in me is bad 

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:01.800
 I can not say more so 

00:05:02.339 --> 00:05:10.679
 anything that is not a single player or 

00:05:06.819 --> 00:05:10.679
 only one that is serious 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:23.700
 good one on a free envelope here 

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:26.780
 is ronaldo christian people are what 

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:31.139
 we open and I'm going to open one plus one of 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:33.330
 15,000 because not and already do the last 

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:37.400
 because the truth is to spend the coins on 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:37.400
 many envelopes that just a ripoff 

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:42.730
 but good last about people 

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:46.090
 please let's let something come out 

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:48.460
 something comes out I already lost hope 

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:52.580
 they are about free but then since 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:54.960
 the more you leave you can leave now 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:57.389
 I do not expect anything more 

00:05:54.960 --> 00:06:00.169
 does not know and is the second to say 

00:05:57.389 --> 00:06:00.169
 what do i do and good 

00:06:00.689 --> 00:06:03.649
 nothing does not come out 

00:06:04.129 --> 00:06:08.040
 and can not say 

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:10.110
 I do not intend to open more of these 

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:13.280
 15,000 the truth 

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:13.280
 it was too much 

00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:20.270
 let's open for free that did not come out 

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:24.050
 I hope something good comes out is an envelope 

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:25.999
 normal gold but then good people no no 

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:29.029
