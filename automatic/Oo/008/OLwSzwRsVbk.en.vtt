off<00:01:18.720> you<00:01:19.020> already<00:01:19.380> know<00:01:19.530> how<00:01:19.680> it<00:01:19.830> goes<00:01:19.979> down

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
off you already know how it goes down

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.490 
off you already know how it goes down
either<00:01:20.759> lose<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.390> ball<00:01:21.570> it<00:01:22.049> goes<00:01:22.259> out<00:01:22.470> of

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
either lose the ball it goes out of

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.800 
either lose the ball it goes out of
bounds<00:01:22.710> or<00:01:23.280> something<00:01:23.640> else<00:01:23.790> crazy<00:01:24.210> happens

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
bounds or something else crazy happens

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.130 
bounds or something else crazy happens
so<00:01:25.290> everything<00:01:26.220> is<00:01:26.490> interrupt<00:01:27.060> abul<00:01:27.390> in<00:01:27.600> a

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
so everything is interrupt abul in a

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.890 
so everything is interrupt abul in a
one-man<00:01:28.979> animation<00:01:29.759> so<00:01:29.939> suppose<00:01:30.689> you're

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
one-man animation so suppose you're

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.810 
one-man animation so suppose you're
crossing<00:01:31.320> over<00:01:31.439> somebody<00:01:31.890> you<00:01:32.369> shake<00:01:32.640> them

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
crossing over somebody you shake them

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.460 
crossing over somebody you shake them
down<00:01:32.970> with<00:01:33.180> a<00:01:33.210> headsy<00:01:33.659> and<00:01:33.840> then<00:01:34.140> you<00:01:34.200> can<00:01:34.320> just

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
down with a headsy and then you can just

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:35.749 
down with a headsy and then you can just
break<00:01:34.619> out<00:01:34.799> it<00:01:34.979> at<00:01:35.100> heads<00:01:35.310> you<00:01:35.490> can<00:01:35.610> go

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
break out it at heads you can go

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.270 
break out it at heads you can go
straight<00:01:36.060> to<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.329> rim<00:01:36.630> on<00:01:37.020> 2k<00:01:37.590> you<00:01:37.650> normally

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
straight to the rim on 2k you normally

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.280 
straight to the rim on 2k you normally
have<00:01:38.430> to<00:01:38.640> finish<00:01:38.880> you<00:01:39.689> know<00:01:39.869> and<00:01:40.110> this<00:01:40.229> is

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
have to finish you know and this is

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.260 
have to finish you know and this is
where<00:01:40.650> we're<00:01:40.799> going<00:01:40.920> to<00:01:41.009> get<00:01:41.189> into<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:42.060> two

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
where we're going to get into the two

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.870 
where we're going to get into the two
men<00:01:42.509> animations<00:01:43.229> all<00:01:43.470> right<00:01:43.700> two<00:01:44.700> men

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
men animations all right two men

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.899 
men animations all right two men
animations<00:01:45.570> is<00:01:45.810> what<00:01:46.409> basically<00:01:46.920> runs<00:01:47.549> to

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
animations is what basically runs to

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.910 
animations is what basically runs to
cake<00:01:48.149> like<00:01:48.540> that's<00:01:48.930> what<00:01:49.170> drives<00:01:49.439> them<00:01:49.770> it

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
cake like that's what drives them it

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.219 
cake like that's what drives them it
makes<00:01:50.220> the<00:01:50.430> game<00:01:50.610> look<00:01:50.670> look<00:01:51.509> good<00:01:51.750> it<00:01:52.020> makes

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
it fluid but at the same time it makes

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.780 
it fluid but at the same time it makes
stupidity<00:01:55.619> happen<00:01:56.070> stuff<00:01:56.490> that<00:01:56.759> just

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
stupidity happen stuff that just

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.080 
stupidity happen stuff that just
shouldn't<00:01:57.479> be<00:01:57.810> happening<00:01:58.110> happens<00:01:59.070> so<00:01:59.579> for

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
shouldn't be happening happens so for

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.450 
shouldn't be happening happens so for
example<00:02:00.180> you<00:02:00.750> go<00:02:01.170> up<00:02:01.290> for<00:02:01.500> a<00:02:01.530> dunk<00:02:01.770> that's<00:02:02.189> wide
