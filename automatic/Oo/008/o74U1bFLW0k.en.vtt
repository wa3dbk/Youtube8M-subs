the drive channel this is where you'll

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:33.270 
the drive channel this is where you'll

the other one the drive channel is just

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.979 
the other one the drive channel is just
going<00:02:35.349> to<00:02:35.410> control<00:02:35.800> how<00:02:36.040> much<00:02:36.900> distortion<00:02:37.900> you

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:37.989 
going to control how much distortion you

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:39.420 
going to control how much distortion you
have<00:02:38.170> as<00:02:38.349> you<00:02:38.440> increase<00:02:38.709> the<00:02:38.950> drive<00:02:39.190> the

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
have as you increase the drive the

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.640 
have as you increase the drive the
volume<00:02:39.790> will<00:02:39.910> go<00:02:40.030> up<00:02:40.239> and<00:02:40.540> so<00:02:41.349> if<00:02:41.470> you've

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
volume will go up and so if you've

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.080 
volume will go up and so if you've
increased<00:02:41.920> the<00:02:42.220> drive<00:02:42.430> you<00:02:42.640> might<00:02:42.819> have<00:02:42.970> to

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
increased the drive you might have to

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:44.550 
increased the drive you might have to
adjust<00:02:43.180> the<00:02:43.510> master<00:02:43.930> again<00:02:44.140> to<00:02:44.319> get<00:02:44.410> it<00:02:44.470> to

adjust the master again to get it to

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.650 
adjust the master again to get it to
blend<00:02:44.769> against<00:02:45.730> the<00:02:45.819> clean<00:02:46.030> channel<00:02:46.480> when<00:02:46.569> you

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
blend against the clean channel when you

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.150 
blend against the clean channel when you
jump<00:02:46.900> back<00:02:47.080> and<00:02:47.260> forth<00:02:47.319> with<00:02:47.650> the<00:02:47.739> foot<00:02:47.920> switch

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
the reverb on this is pretty good but

the reverb on this is pretty good but
I'm<00:02:50.230> going<00:02:50.350> to<00:02:50.410> start<00:02:50.620> it<00:02:50.709> off<00:02:50.799> in<00:02:51.010> the<00:02:51.069> halfway

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
I'm going to start it off in the halfway

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:54.690 
I'm going to start it off in the halfway
position<00:02:51.640> just<00:02:52.569> so<00:02:52.660> that<00:02:52.810> you'll<00:02:52.959> hear<00:02:53.700> how

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
position just so that you'll hear how

plenty of presence and because I like a

plenty of presence and because I like a

nice smooth distortion I keep the

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.020 
nice smooth distortion I keep the

problem<00:03:05.470> with<00:03:05.980> 60<00:03:06.340> watts<00:03:06.549> so<00:03:07.150> I<00:03:07.180> start<00:03:07.510> with

00:03:07.589 --> 00:03:07.599 
problem with 60 watts so I start with

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:10.050 
problem with 60 watts so I start with
the<00:03:07.660> presence<00:03:08.080> off<00:03:08.310> but<00:03:09.310> if<00:03:09.430> you<00:03:09.549> want<00:03:09.760> to<00:03:09.940> you

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
the presence off but if you want to you

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:11.759 
the presence off but if you want to you
can<00:03:10.209> start<00:03:10.450> within<00:03:10.599> 12<00:03:11.019> o'clock<00:03:11.290> and<00:03:11.440> adjust

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:11.769 
can start within 12 o'clock and adjust

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:13.380 
can start within 12 o'clock and adjust
from<00:03:11.860> there<00:03:11.950> but<00:03:12.549> I<00:03:12.580> know<00:03:12.700> this<00:03:12.940> amp<00:03:13.150> pretty

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
from there but I know this amp pretty

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:14.520 
from there but I know this amp pretty
well<00:03:13.599> I'm<00:03:13.720> going<00:03:13.840> start<00:03:14.049> with<00:03:14.080> the<00:03:14.170> presence

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
well I'm going start with the presence

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.440 
well I'm going start with the presence
off<00:03:14.709> I've<00:03:15.250> got<00:03:15.430> the<00:03:15.640> reverb<00:03:15.910> pretty<00:03:16.209> high<00:03:16.390> I've

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
off I've got the reverb pretty high I've

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:18.780 
off I've got the reverb pretty high I've
got<00:03:16.780> the<00:03:16.870> master<00:03:17.290> at<00:03:17.380> about<00:03:17.620> between<00:03:18.100> 2<00:03:18.549> &amp;<00:03:18.730> 3

a power amp in and I take this preamp
out<00:03:43.389> to<00:03:43.630> a<00:03:43.660> 25k<00:03:44.440> volume<00:03:44.859> pedal<00:03:45.100> and<00:03:45.370> from<00:03:46.150> the

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:46.239 
out to a 25k volume pedal and from the

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 
now those of you that see me play live

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:51.629 
now those of you that see me play live
see<00:03:50.290> me<00:03:50.410> use<00:03:50.560> that<00:03:50.739> volume<00:03:50.950> pedal<00:03:51.190> wonder<00:03:51.519> how

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:51.639 
see me use that volume pedal wonder how

00:03:51.639 --> 00:03:53.879 
see me use that volume pedal wonder how
come<00:03:51.880> I<00:03:51.910> can<00:03:52.150> get<00:03:52.329> such<00:03:53.019> smooth<00:03:53.410> control<00:03:53.829> of

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:53.889 
come I can get such smooth control of

00:03:53.889 --> 00:03:54.990 
come I can get such smooth control of
the<00:03:53.980> volume<00:03:54.280> without<00:03:54.340> affecting<00:03:54.910> the

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
the volume without affecting the

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.390 
the volume without affecting the
distortion<00:03:55.569> that's<00:03:55.780> because<00:03:56.170> it's<00:03:56.859> a<00:03:57.040> volume

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 
distortion that's because it's a volume

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.150 
distortion that's because it's a volume
pedal<00:03:57.579> with<00:03:58.090> a<00:03:58.120> 25k<00:03:58.989> pot<00:03:59.319> so<00:03:59.650> that<00:03:59.799> you<00:03:59.950> it's

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.160 
pedal with a 25k pot so that you it's

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.550 
pedal with a 25k pot so that you it's
looking<00:04:00.549> for<00:04:00.700> an<00:04:00.760> active<00:04:01.090> signal<00:04:01.510> and<00:04:01.660> coming

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
looking for an active signal and coming

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.050 
looking for an active signal and coming
out<00:04:02.620> of<00:04:02.769> here<00:04:02.950> I've<00:04:03.190> got<00:04:03.370> that<00:04:03.549> active<00:04:03.880> signal

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.060 
out of here I've got that active signal

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:06.750 
out of here I've got that active signal
my<00:04:04.329> volume<00:04:04.660> control<00:04:05.049> is<00:04:05.350> after<00:04:05.980> my<00:04:06.160> distortion

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:06.760 
my volume control is after my distortion

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.610 
my volume control is after my distortion
so<00:04:07.420> I<00:04:07.450> can<00:04:07.690> bring<00:04:07.840> it<00:04:07.959> up<00:04:08.079> and<00:04:08.170> down<00:04:08.260> real

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
so I can bring it up and down real

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:10.410 
so I can bring it up and down real
smooth<00:04:08.950> without<00:04:09.400> affecting<00:04:09.819> the<00:04:09.910> distortion

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:10.420 
smooth without affecting the distortion

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:13.709 
smooth without affecting the distortion
we'll<00:04:10.540> hear<00:04:10.690> what<00:04:10.720> that<00:04:10.810> sounds<00:04:11.200> like<00:04:11.260> next
