just<00:02:58.620> about<00:02:58.770> the<00:02:58.830> only<00:02:58.980> thing<00:02:59.220> that<00:02:59.580> our

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
just about the only thing that our

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.110 
just about the only thing that our

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
I think one of the reasons to do network

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.600 
I think one of the reasons to do network
is<00:03:03.830> popular<00:03:04.459> is<00:03:04.849> this<00:03:05.030> because<00:03:05.799> or<00:03:06.799> in<00:03:07.190> common

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610 
is popular is this because or in common
