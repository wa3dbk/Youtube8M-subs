00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
to mine or you idiot make sure the water

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.020 
to mine or you idiot make sure the water
stream<00:02:01.080> does<00:02:01.320> not<00:02:01.470> disappear<00:02:01.860> otherwise<00:02:02.700> you

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
stream does not disappear otherwise you

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.180 
stream does not disappear otherwise you

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:05.190 
will burn to death as you get pushed

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:13.790 
will burn to death as you get pushed
into<00:02:05.550> the<00:02:06.210> lava<00:02:07.429> so<00:02:12.260> yes<00:02:13.260> it<00:02:13.410> would

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
into the lava so yes it would

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:24.740 
into the lava so yes it would
so<00:02:14.370> for<00:02:14.610> number<00:02:14.700> six<00:02:23.390> make<00:02:24.390> sure<00:02:24.510> was<00:02:24.600> not

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
so for number six make sure was not

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.440 
so for number six make sure was not
raining<00:02:24.959> and<00:02:25.650> this<00:02:26.550> is<00:02:26.760> the<00:02:26.940> one<00:02:27.180> where<00:02:27.360> it<00:02:27.420> was

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
raining and this is the one where it was

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.470 
raining and this is the one where it was
going<00:02:27.630> to<00:02:27.750> be<00:02:27.840> ten<00:02:28.140> and<00:02:28.530> we<00:02:29.400> thought<00:02:29.700> when<00:02:30.450> I

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
going to be ten and we thought when I

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.750 
going to be ten and we thought when I
tested<00:02:30.840> before<00:02:31.050> spiders<00:02:31.530> didn't<00:02:31.830> climb<00:02:32.130> but

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
tested before spiders didn't climb but

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:40.940 
tested before spiders didn't climb but
as<00:02:33.060> you'll<00:02:33.390> see<00:02:33.480> we<00:02:34.200> get<00:02:34.380> attacked<00:02:39.530> yeah

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
as you'll see we get attacked yeah

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:46.310 
as you'll see we get attacked yeah
motion<00:02:41.580> had<00:02:41.730> spider-man<00:02:43.970> so<00:02:44.970> that's<00:02:45.750> one<00:02:46.170> sec

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
motion had spider-man so that's one sec

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:47.180 
motion had spider-man so that's one sec
so<00:02:46.410> he's<00:02:46.590> not<00:02:46.680> invisible

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
so he's not invisible

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:48.590 
so he's not invisible
