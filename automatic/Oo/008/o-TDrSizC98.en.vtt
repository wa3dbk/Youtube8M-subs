00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:08.340
 hello friends tattoo today we will see 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.559
 two very good options for tattooists 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.209
 professionals and for those who are 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.240
 they are starting in the world of tattoo 

00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:18.210
 let's see from the new school a 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:21.599
 rotating dragonfly style with frame 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:24.300
 Metallic with a solid fit morse 

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:27.929
 with a new implement that are subject 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:30.990
 Rods has classic clip connection 

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:34.680
 court and what we're going to see has adjustment 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.900
 of hit tension up here and this 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.390
 machine is characterized by being ideal 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:41.700
 for lines and for shadows unlike 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.580
 of other rotating this time the 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:47.670
 ascending and descending serves us to 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:50.460
 the sides let's see that his stealth and 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:55.110
 his strength is impressive but first 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:58.980
 we are going to weigh it is a machine that weighs 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:02.130
 66 grams imperceptible in the hand 65 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.769
 grams to be correct let's see what 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:08.549
 we talked about the stealth of this machine 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:12.390
 This machine is ideal to have it 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:17.050
 because it requires little configuration and 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:19.170
 always always go let's see 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:24.210
 that this machine 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:26.640
 has a regulated soft gait and this 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.880
 machine in general is ideal to use it 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:33.540
 with low or medium voltages we are going to 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.729
 lower the voltage and they will see that well 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:40.759
 everything keeps hitting let's make a 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.759
 resistance test with your finger 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:46.789
 it does not slow down really we are 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:50.000
 exerting a lot of pressure to leave 

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:53.420
 walk but it does so this 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.159
 power and this demanded is key let's 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.170
 show that you still have more strength 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:02:00.460
 gradually raising the voltage nor what 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.460
 they will notice in the sound 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:10.640
 It has strength to spare an excellent 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:15.890
 option now to demonstrate a little more 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:19.160
 let's try it with a magnum 25 a 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:21.860
 rod with the group of 25 needles 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:24.069
 it's a brush we're already talking about a 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:27.280
 large and heavy needle 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:29.889
 here the bra is in operation 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.230
 of rods brings all the vibration towards 

00:02:29.889 --> 00:02:34.689
 the box making the strokes and the 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:37.900
 hand holding the toe does not get tired 

00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:40.450
 both and in the case of making lines that 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:44.409
 allow us to make solid lines we are going to 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:46.739
 see now how he moves these twenty-five 

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:46.739
 needles 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:56.370
 without any problem we will exercise the 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.610
 Pressure 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:01.220
 and it does not slow down 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:04.880
 It is a very good option to have them 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:07.910
 between our machines now leaving the 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:11.900
 new school let's move on to the classic 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:16.010
 Coil machine This is a machine 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:20.180
 national with a pure steel box 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:24.380
 brass wire posts brass one 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:27.520
 very solid adjustment pin strapping 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:31.190
 line shorts and also has a hit 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:34.940
 regulated and very sharp we are going to try it 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:38.750
 is a powerful machine ideal for lines 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:41.600
 the balance that this table offers is very 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:45.440
 good very good since it allows us 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:49.069
 fluid tracings let's try 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:51.620
 small and large voltages 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:54.849
 let's go down because it's a machine with 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:54.849
 a lot of strength 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:00.280
 we are going to go up gradually 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:07.750
 so that they realize that this whale 

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:10.500
 it is also another tool 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:10.500
 indispensable 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:20.030
 let's go up a bit more 

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:23.150
 it really has a lot more strength than 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:25.220
 this but it is not necessary because it is a 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:28.780
 alaina machine let's do the test 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:28.780
 of the resistance with the finger 

00:04:29.249 --> 00:04:35.280
 it does not slow down 

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:39.330
 a national option 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:43.020
 with an imported option very good for 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:46.710
 cover the two needs of lines and 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:48.750
 of shadows besides that this machine the 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:51.120
 dragon fly can also be used to 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:53.990
 lines until next time and we wish you 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.990
 good ink
