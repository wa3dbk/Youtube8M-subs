00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.210
 do not 

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:18.400
 hello my name roberto come to 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.320
 sent more equally our truck is 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.180
 something like activating the transit towers 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.130
 and light airways or activate them for 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:25.810
 that they begin to send a signal or 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:27.760
 I leave it in another way how to make it work 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:29.920
 the naftas and the cards the ships 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:32.830
 cars and well then I will explain 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:35.050
 how I did it and what happens first of all 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:37.150
 we have to go to buried and get it 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.890
 the nascar if you do not know how to do it if 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:40.450
 there would be a separate tutorial because 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:42.220
 I still do not have the scenes then 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:43.720
 I suppose if they do not they do not know where the 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:46.060
 nothing but now a video of how 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.739
 get it first we have to 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:50.170
 get the nascar from buried and go to 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:52.210
 transita activate it below the tower and 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.670
 it will come out to us that if it allows it and we 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.050
 let's go back to the menu and when we go to 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:00.420
 menu let's see the transit tower 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:00.420
 throwing like lightning and this will sound 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.540
 once we do this we already know that 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.490
 we have it ready and something else before 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.830
 leave transit go pick up the 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.869
 transition naphtics activated if not the 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.700
 have I'm going to pick up the nascar that are 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.880
 goes behind the debut bus so that 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.770
 know after this we will get fed up 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.080
 and rise there we go with the card 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.030
 transit and with that of with the one of buried the 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.009
 can see that they are the two followed is 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.250
 one over another one over another forgiveness 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:31.680
 let's give rice and activate it 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.000
 under the tower we activate everything well and 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.280
 we are going to allow it to be 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.619
 transit and before leaving the 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.179
 equal game we will pick up the one from the 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.399
 age and rise and do not know how to do it by 

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:42.990
 there I have a tutorial on my channel 

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:44.759
 We pick up the die rice and 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.200
 after that he came out of the 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.860
 game and we can see also how 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.860
 is giving signal 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.909
 and now we can see how the 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.909
 two cards the one of trÃ nsit and the one of dire 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:59.170
 rise with boring and minor I can not 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:01.000
 confirm but I have been told that the 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.829
 truth and rise does not work in buried no 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.259
 I can confirm then keep them 

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:06.580
 updated when when I get it in 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:09.130
 twitter that is the description in 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:13.300
 facebook if you want to follow me more 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:14.680
 I had to tell you about this so I did not 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.030
 I know if it's a book or something but when 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.709
 we go to the map in a move towards 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.569
 bored we can see that the right is 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:21.970
 line as if it were some game mode 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:24.519
 new or something but I do not find it 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.600
 no, there are not any youtuber have told me 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:27.400
 that explained a new game mode 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.560
 but I think it 's coming in because I do not 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.030
 it is not what nothing but that was what 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.709
 I managed to activate the transit towers and 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.569
 I know everyone is worried about 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:36.220
 buried but we can activate the towers 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:38.230
 with the naphthas so that they know so that 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.549
 start sending signal and good you 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.260
 say goodbye I wanted to tell you that I have not 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:43.180
 been uploading many videos of buried 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.400
 because I've been working with the clan 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.049
 trying to describe the interest we do not go 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.760
 we're not going so bad either 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:50.500
 several steps done that I do not know if the 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.880
 most have them but we have several 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.130
 steps and we have several things to do 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.750
 in the in the district then we are 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:57.080
 working on that why you can not 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:02.540
 upload many videos 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:03.560
 and when I recorded the capture and good 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:07.480
 now yes I think it would be all a 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.480
 strong number with these audio videos
