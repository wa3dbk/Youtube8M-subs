00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:06.480
 as part of the skoda fabia new project in 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:08.790
 spotlight 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.490
 car center gives answers to the first questions 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:14.120
 our readers in the technical section 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.120
 diaries 

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:27.070
 start-stop system with a mechanism 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.140
 energy recovery during braking 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:31.480
 set as standard 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.610
 equipment for all engines of the new skoda 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:35.290
 fabia whose exhaust gases 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:36.580
 meet environmental standards 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:39.700
 Euro-6 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:41.470
 These are motors with a displacement of 1 and 2 liters. 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:44.350
 on engines with distributed injection 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:46.900
 fuel m &amp; a and 110 horsepower 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:49.059
 forces this system is not installed 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.830
 start-stop system can be switched off 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:53.230
 special button on the instrument panel 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:55.420
 or it turns off automatically when 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:57.190
 certain conditions for example in 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:00.820
 depending on the steering angle 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:03.280
 wheels or at position of the selector akpp 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.409
 the start-stop system recognizes that 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.100
 car performs a maneuver for example 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:08.020
 parked 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.630
 and excludes automatic shutdown 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:13.510
 engine as in this situation it 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.729
 can be dangerous also to shut off 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:17.590
 engine can affect the driver and in 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:20.260
 depending on the use of brakes 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:22.180
 if the car is traveling slowly for example in 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:24.070
 traffic jam or maneuver system 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.680
 recognizes the traffic situation and not 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.780
 turns off the engine however if the driver 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.180
 will slow down stronger i have to press 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.049
 on the brake pedal with great effort 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.509
 engine shut down 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:36.399
 useful function of the start-stop system in 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:39.310
 new skoda fabia is a mapping 

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:41.079
 car settings menu reasons why 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.899
 engine does not turn off automatically 

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:46.619
 or why he wound up again 

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:46.619
 own initiative 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:01.130
 in the new skoda fabia applies 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:03.440
 electromechanical amplifier si and ps with 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.810
 variable performance or rather 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.550
 gains which decreases with 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.770
 increasing speed electric amplifier 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:10.880
 provides ease of rotation of the steering wheel on 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:13.220
 low speeds 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.170
 for example when parking and on large 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.720
 speeds during maneuvers provides 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.460
 excellent feedback extra 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.830
 advantage of electromechanical 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:23.720
 power steering is saving 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.730
 fuel as it consumes 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.130
 electricity only in moments when 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.090
 it's necessary 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.920
 electromechanical amplifier in the new 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.770
 Fabia installed under the scheme 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.780
 si and ps which is auxiliary effort 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:36.830
 this is transmitted to the drive through 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.040
 downshift 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:41.810
 directly to the steering column 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.300
 eliminates the need to use 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.830
 hydraulic pump and pipelines necessary 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:48.410
 for electro-hydraulic amplifier 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:50.780
 power steering motor with 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:53.990
 gearbox is installed directly in 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:56.060
 new electric power steering column 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:57.980
 Fabia allows you to mount in the car 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.959
 all sorts of electronic helpers 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.790
 for example for this model is available 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:04.430
 driver fatigue determination system 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:05.900
 which controls the nature of the movement 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.060
 steering wheel and using a special 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:11.170
 software determines 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.170
 tired driver and 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:25.040
 the new skoda fabia is installed 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:26.600
 absolutely new family of motors 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:30.320
 abbreviated 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:32.300
 and and 211 they are created on a single new 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:34.160
 modular platform for gasoline engines 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:36.110
 mqb volkswagen 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.300
 these units will be installed on 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:40.730
 models to various brands of concern 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:42.890
 new family of motors consists of three 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:45.020
 and 4-cylinder units as with turbo 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:46.490
 compressors with direct 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:48.500
 fuel injection in the cylinder 

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:50.240
 play and atmospheric with 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.300
 distributed injection mi pi ah 

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:54.260
 modular design provided 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:57.680
 interchangeability of individual modules 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:59.780
 different motors past and this generation 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.880
 Tess motors and are distinguished by many 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:04.580
 details one of the differences of the new 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:07.040
 engine and hey 211 to use 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:08.930
 play from the predecessor Tess and 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.760
 last generation is that 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:13.580
 here is the maximum injection pressure 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:15.590
 fuel increased to 200 bar which 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:17.870
 provides a new fuel pump 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:19.640
 fuel is injected into the cylinders through 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:21.770
 five-hole nozzles with 

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:24.470
 possibility of filing up to three separate 

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:26.780
 portions of fuel on one working cycle 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:28.220
 on motors with a start-stop system also 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:30.800
 installed a new speed sensor 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:33.590
 crankshaft with recognizing the direction of it 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:36.110
 rotation is needed for more accurate 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:37.250
 recognizing the position system in which 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:39.140
 crankshaft stopped 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:40.970
 without this sensor system operation 

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:43.400
 start-stop is difficult because 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:46.160
 Electronics does not see in what position 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:48.290
 The pistons are also in the new 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:50.570
 I am in the drive timing belt is used 

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:52.660
 a belt that does not require replacement 

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:55.660
 throughout the lifetime 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:55.660
 the car
