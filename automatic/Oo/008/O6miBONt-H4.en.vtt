get in to progress through here and go
down<00:00:12.929> here<00:00:13.849> look<00:00:14.849> at<00:00:14.940> that<00:00:15.030> it's<00:00:15.179> clean<00:00:16.100> tidy

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:18.529 
down here look at that it's clean tidy

down here look at that it's clean tidy
but<00:00:19.529> the<00:00:19.740> din<00:00:20.640> rail<00:00:20.880> wall<00:00:21.320> didn't<00:00:22.320> go<00:00:22.439> quite<00:00:22.710> as

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
but the din rail wall didn't go quite as

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.620 
but the din rail wall didn't go quite as
low<00:00:23.010> as<00:00:23.189> i<00:00:23.310> was<00:00:23.430> expecting<00:00:23.760> i<00:00:24.000> decided<00:00:24.420> to<00:00:24.480> put

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
low as i was expecting i decided to put

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.450 
low as i was expecting i decided to put
this<00:00:24.720> shelving<00:00:25.019> unit<00:00:25.470> here<00:00:25.769> instead<00:00:26.130> of<00:00:26.189> in

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
this shelving unit here instead of in

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.200 
this shelving unit here instead of in
there<00:00:27.920> I've<00:00:28.920> got<00:00:29.070> another<00:00:29.279> extra<00:00:29.670> meter<00:00:29.970> and<00:00:30.179> a

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
there I've got another extra meter and a

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.330 
there I've got another extra meter and a
half<00:00:30.240> of<00:00:30.630> din<00:00:30.840> rail<00:00:31.050> left<00:00:31.410> is<00:00:31.590> like<00:00:31.830> and<00:00:32.160> it's

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
half of din rail left is like and it's

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.069 
half of din rail left is like and it's
about<00:00:32.460> sixteen<00:00:32.940> dollars<00:00:33.149> for<00:00:33.510> six<00:00:33.719> linear

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
about sixteen dollars for six linear

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.709 
about sixteen dollars for six linear
metres<00:00:34.500> and<00:00:34.940> that's<00:00:35.940> actually<00:00:36.090> cheaper<00:00:36.630> than

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
metres and that's actually cheaper than

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.440 
metres and that's actually cheaper than
a<00:00:36.809> couple<00:00:36.989> of<00:00:37.110> these<00:00:37.230> plastic<00:00:37.680> tubs<00:00:37.980> and<00:00:38.820> it's

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
a couple of these plastic tubs and it's

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:40.670 
a couple of these plastic tubs and it's
a<00:00:39.480> much<00:00:39.629> better<00:00:39.870> way<00:00:40.020> of<00:00:40.050> storing<00:00:40.440> all<00:00:40.649> your

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
a much better way of storing all your

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.889 
a much better way of storing all your
equipment<00:00:41.300> you<00:00:42.300> can<00:00:42.390> see<00:00:42.600> what<00:00:42.719> you've<00:00:42.870> got

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
equipment you can see what you've got

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.229 
equipment you can see what you've got
into<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.620> ratings<00:00:44.040> and<00:00:44.160> everything<00:00:44.520> is<00:00:45.059> easy

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
into the ratings and everything is easy

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.229 
into the ratings and everything is easy
enough<00:00:45.390> to<00:00:45.539> pick<00:00:45.809> one<00:00:45.989> off<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.289> wall<00:00:47.239> yeah

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
enough to pick one off the wall yeah

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.720 
enough to pick one off the wall yeah
really<00:00:48.780> good<00:00:48.950> so<00:00:49.950> I<00:00:49.980> got<00:00:50.250> pneumatics

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
really good so I got pneumatics

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.250 
really good so I got pneumatics
hydraulics<00:00:51.059> all<00:00:51.480> that<00:00:51.629> sort<00:00:51.809> of<00:00:51.840> stuff<00:00:51.899> in

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
hydraulics all that sort of stuff in

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.529 
hydraulics all that sort of stuff in
there<00:00:52.579> refrigeration<00:00:53.579> that<00:00:54.059> still<00:00:54.329> needs<00:00:54.510> to

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
there refrigeration that still needs to

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.200 
there refrigeration that still needs to
be<00:00:54.629> sorted<00:00:54.930> and<00:00:55.730> inventories<00:00:56.730> when<00:00:57.030> I<00:00:57.090> get

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
be sorted and inventories when I get

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.319 
be sorted and inventories when I get

that's<00:01:58.500> who<00:01:58.680> makes<00:01:58.920> it<00:01:59.100> that's<00:01:59.280> a<00:01:59.369> power

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
that's who makes it that's a power

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.300 
that's who makes it that's a power
supply<00:01:59.810> it's<00:02:00.810> about<00:02:00.899> 120<00:02:01.680> pounds<00:02:01.890> there's

been used since i stashed it years ago
that's<00:03:32.470> pretty<00:03:32.620> much<00:03:32.739> going<00:03:33.130> unless<00:03:33.940> it's<00:03:34.239> of

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:21.530 
that stuff is well worth hanging on to

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:24.130 
that stuff is well worth hanging on to
the<00:04:22.490> rest<00:04:22.670> of<00:04:22.820> it<00:04:22.970> well<00:04:23.180> the<00:04:23.840> samoled

place<00:04:35.540> to<00:04:35.570> live<00:04:36.010> probably<00:04:37.010> pegs<00:04:37.370> down<00:04:37.730> there

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:38.030 
place to live probably pegs down there

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:39.400 
place to live probably pegs down there
i'll<00:04:38.150> put<00:04:38.330> a<00:04:38.390> peg<00:04:38.600> board<00:04:38.870> in<00:04:38.990> there<00:04:39.140> and<00:04:39.320> just

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:39.410 
i'll put a peg board in there and just

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:40.950 
i'll put a peg board in there and just
hang<00:04:39.620> the<00:04:39.740> cables<00:04:40.130> in<00:04:40.250> that<00:04:40.370> little<00:04:40.580> corner

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:40.960 
hang the cables in that little corner

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.210 
hang the cables in that little corner
that'll<00:04:41.960> work<00:04:42.080> quite<00:04:42.380> well<00:04:42.410> so<00:04:42.770> I<00:04:42.920> can't

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:43.220 
that'll work quite well so I can't

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:44.620 
that'll work quite well so I can't
really<00:04:43.370> see<00:04:43.580> that<00:04:43.730> corner<00:04:44.090> being<00:04:44.270> used<00:04:44.570> for

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:44.630 
really see that corner being used for

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:46.720 
really see that corner being used for
anything<00:04:44.870> else<00:04:45.170> other<00:04:45.380> than<00:04:45.620> collecting<00:04:46.100> junk

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:46.730 
anything else other than collecting junk

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:49.900 
anything else other than collecting junk
that<00:04:46.970> never<00:04:47.240> gets<00:04:47.420> seen<00:04:47.750> I<00:04:48.640> want<00:04:49.640> to<00:04:49.730> avoid

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:49.910 
that never gets seen I want to avoid

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:53.140 
that never gets seen I want to avoid
having<00:04:50.120> to<00:04:50.210> park<00:04:50.510> stuff<00:04:50.810> in<00:04:51.110> here<00:04:51.820> if<00:04:52.820> there's

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:53.150 
having to park stuff in here if there's

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:54.640 
having to park stuff in here if there's
room<00:04:53.330> through<00:04:53.540> maroons<00:04:54.170> you<00:04:54.290> just<00:04:54.470> leave

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:54.650 
room through maroons you just leave

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:56.530 
room through maroons you just leave
something<00:04:55.010> in<00:04:55.190> pocket<00:04:55.610> there<00:04:55.790> it's<00:04:56.270> just

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:56.540 
something in pocket there it's just

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:57.880 
something in pocket there it's just
going<00:04:56.660> to<00:04:56.720> make<00:04:56.780> things<00:04:56.900> difficult<00:04:57.350> to<00:04:57.680> get<00:04:57.860> to

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:57.890 
going to make things difficult to get to

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:00.160 
going to make things difficult to get to
so<00:04:58.400> as<00:04:59.000> long<00:04:59.180> as<00:04:59.240> I<00:04:59.360> keep<00:04:59.480> the<00:04:59.630> floor<00:04:59.870> space

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:00.170 
so as long as I keep the floor space

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:02.560 
so as long as I keep the floor space
clean<00:05:00.560> it'll<00:05:01.520> be<00:05:01.610> clear<00:05:01.820> enough<00:05:02.030> to<00:05:02.090> get<00:05:02.360> to

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:02.570 
clean it'll be clear enough to get to

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:04.870 
clean it'll be clear enough to get to
and<00:05:02.810> I<00:05:03.440> shouldn't<00:05:03.920> have<00:05:04.190> any<00:05:04.370> major<00:05:04.610> issues

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:04.880 
and I shouldn't have any major issues

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:07.870 
and I shouldn't have any major issues
with<00:05:05.410> not<00:05:06.410> being<00:05:06.650> bothered<00:05:07.130> trying<00:05:07.400> to<00:05:07.610> pull

quick update bits and pieces going on

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:01.090 
quick update bits and pieces going on
and<00:05:58.840> you're<00:05:59.840> going<00:06:00.050> to<00:06:00.110> move<00:06:00.260> along<00:06:00.410> here<00:06:00.800> soon

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:01.100 
and you're going to move along here soon

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:04.150 
and you're going to move along here soon
and<00:06:01.310> do<00:06:01.700> all<00:06:01.820> that<00:06:01.850> sort<00:06:02.180> of<00:06:02.210> stuff<00:06:03.160> hopefully

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:04.160 
and do all that sort of stuff hopefully

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:05.710 
and do all that sort of stuff hopefully
once<00:06:04.490> the<00:06:04.610> bench<00:06:04.790> is<00:06:04.970> clear<00:06:05.240> I'll<00:06:05.419> get<00:06:05.570> the

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:05.720 
once the bench is clear I'll get the

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:08.020 
once the bench is clear I'll get the
server<00:06:06.380> and<00:06:06.740> to<00:06:06.860> cut<00:06:07.010> another<00:06:07.250> another<00:06:07.460> pc

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:08.030

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:10.720 
server and to cut another another pc
fired<00:06:08.360> up<00:06:08.630> and<00:06:08.780> working<00:06:09.230> and<00:06:09.460> be<00:06:10.460> able<00:06:10.520> to<00:06:10.610> go

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:10.730 
fired up and working and be able to go

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:13.390 
fired up and working and be able to go
from<00:06:10.880> there<00:06:11.090> so<00:06:11.650> it's<00:06:12.650> just<00:06:12.740> progressive

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:13.400

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:14.890 
from there so it's just progressive
starting<00:06:13.730> from<00:06:13.850> this<00:06:13.940> corner<00:06:14.240> here<00:06:14.600> and<00:06:14.750> just

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:14.900 
starting from this corner here and just

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:17.920 
starting from this corner here and just
radiating<00:06:15.590> out<00:06:15.770> like<00:06:16.040> fall<00:06:16.910> out<00:06:16.940> essentially

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:17.930 
radiating out like fall out essentially

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:20.290 
radiating out like fall out essentially
the<00:06:18.740> cleanups<00:06:19.160> like<00:06:19.340> nuclear<00:06:19.640> fallout<00:06:20.000> it

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:20.300 
the cleanups like nuclear fallout it

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:24.220 
the cleanups like nuclear fallout it
just<00:06:20.480> creeps<00:06:20.780> out<00:06:21.020> gradually<00:06:21.350> and<00:06:23.230> consumes

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:24.230 
just creeps out gradually and consumes

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:29.200 
just creeps out gradually and consumes
everything<00:06:25.750> thanks<00:06:26.750> for<00:06:26.900> watching
