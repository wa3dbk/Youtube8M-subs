things we're not focused enough we did

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:26.950 
things we're not focused enough we did
second<00:01:26.090> half<00:01:26.210> we<00:01:26.360> didn't<00:01:26.540> turn<00:01:26.690> the<00:01:26.720> ball<00:01:26.810> over

with four times so that like that

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:29.890 
with four times so that like that
because<00:01:28.880> a<00:01:28.970> half<00:01:29.210> I<00:01:29.360> was<00:01:29.450> really<00:01:29.630> mad<00:01:29.780> at

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:29.900 
because a half I was really mad at

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.719 
because a half I was really mad at
better<00:01:30.050> turnovers<00:01:30.590> and<00:01:30.740> we<00:01:31.369> were<00:01:31.460> fortunate

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:31.729 
better turnovers and we were fortunate

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:33.910 
better turnovers and we were fortunate
because<00:01:31.970> JP<00:01:32.330> through<00:01:32.780> one<00:01:33.410> pass<00:01:33.650> he<00:01:33.830> was

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
because JP through one pass he was

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.260 
because JP through one pass he was
throwing<00:01:34.100> it<00:01:34.220> to<00:01:34.310> Justin<00:01:34.759> and<00:01:34.970> Bryce

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
throwing it to Justin and Bryce

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:36.880 
throwing it to Justin and Bryce
intercepted<00:01:35.960> and<00:01:36.110> dunked<00:01:36.380> it<00:01:36.470> so<00:01:36.590> he<00:01:36.650> got<00:01:36.800> an

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
intercepted and dunked it so he got an

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.300 
intercepted and dunked it so he got an
assist<00:01:37.190> when<00:01:37.880> it<00:01:37.970> was<00:01:38.060> really<00:01:38.270> a<00:01:38.300> turnover<00:01:38.810> and

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
assist when it was really a turnover and

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.070 
assist when it was really a turnover and
but<00:01:40.310> I<00:01:40.670> thought<00:01:41.240> we<00:01:41.360> handled<00:01:41.570> it<00:01:41.780> better<00:01:41.900> but

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:42.080 
but I thought we handled it better but

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.600 
but I thought we handled it better but
we<00:01:42.229> just<00:01:42.380> weren't<00:01:42.680> focused<00:01:43.250> starting<00:01:43.550> to

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
we just weren't focused starting to

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.160 
we just weren't focused starting to
second<00:01:43.880> half<00:01:44.060> and<00:01:44.300> everybody's<00:01:44.900> gonna<00:01:45.020> say

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
second half and everybody's gonna say

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.910 
second half and everybody's gonna say
well<00:01:45.380> what<00:01:45.950> you<00:01:46.130> say<00:01:46.280> was<00:01:46.460> 25<00:01:46.909> after<00:01:47.750> Jay<00:01:47.960> ps3

pretty doggone well from outside with
four<00:02:20.720> guys<00:02:20.930> and<00:02:21.730> so<00:02:22.730> they<00:02:22.880> were<00:02:22.940> doing<00:02:23.150> that

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
four guys and so they were doing that

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.330 
four guys and so they were doing that
and<00:02:23.540> then<00:02:23.630> I<00:02:23.690> went<00:02:23.840> small<00:02:24.350> and<00:02:24.410> play<00:02:24.739> JP<00:02:25.160> as<00:02:25.310> a

and then I went small and play JP as a

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.910

for<00:02:25.670> ghosts<00:02:25.970> Isaiah<00:02:26.870> had<00:02:27.049> four<00:02:27.290> fouls<00:02:27.560> and

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
for ghosts Isaiah had four fouls and

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.150 
for ghosts Isaiah had four fouls and
then<00:02:28.660> Bryce<00:02:29.660> wasn't<00:02:30.170> involved<00:02:30.440> as<00:02:30.739> much<00:02:30.769> as<00:02:31.070> I

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
then Bryce wasn't involved as much as I

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:32.710 
then Bryce wasn't involved as much as I
wanted<00:02:31.400> to<00:02:31.549> the<00:02:31.730> referee<00:02:32.060> felt<00:02:32.269> like<00:02:32.390> a<00:02:32.420> Bryce

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
wanted to the referee felt like a Bryce

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.420 
wanted to the referee felt like a Bryce
was<00:02:32.900> talking<00:02:33.290> to<00:02:33.350> him<00:02:33.560> and<00:02:33.920> so<00:02:34.070> I<00:02:34.130> didn't<00:02:34.310> like

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
was talking to him and so I didn't like

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:35.979 
was talking to him and so I didn't like
that<00:02:34.640> so<00:02:34.850> it<00:02:34.940> took<00:02:35.030> Bryce<00:02:35.299> out<00:02:35.510> at<00:02:35.630> one<00:02:35.750> point

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:35.989 
that so it took Bryce out at one point

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:39.940 
that so it took Bryce out at one point
but<00:02:36.670> it's<00:02:37.670> hard<00:02:37.850> to<00:02:37.910> say<00:02:38.230> I<00:02:39.230> think<00:02:39.620> we've

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
but it's hard to say I think we've

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.370 
but it's hard to say I think we've
gotten<00:02:40.250> better<00:02:40.459> but<00:02:41.120> we<00:02:41.900> made<00:02:42.079> more<00:02:42.260> mistakes

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
gotten better but we made more mistakes

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:44.170 
gotten better but we made more mistakes
tonight<00:02:42.890> then<00:02:43.250> I<00:02:43.340> would<00:02:43.489> hope<00:02:43.670> we<00:02:43.850> would<00:02:43.880> make

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
tonight then I would hope we would make

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.530 
tonight then I would hope we would make
whatever<00:02:45.079> day<00:02:45.470> is<00:02:45.530> what's<00:02:45.950> today<00:02:46.280> today<00:02:46.540> what

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
whatever day is what's today today what

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.330 
whatever day is what's today today what
day<00:02:47.660> of<00:02:47.750> the<00:02:47.780> week<00:02:47.840> is<00:02:48.140> Tuesday<00:02:48.890> so<00:02:49.070> we<00:02:49.190> play

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
day of the week is Tuesday so we play

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.250 
day of the week is Tuesday so we play
Saturday<00:02:49.790> okay<00:02:50.540> I<00:02:50.570> would<00:02:50.750> hope<00:02:50.900> that<00:02:50.930> you

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
Saturday okay I would hope that you

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.650 
Saturday okay I would hope that you
would<00:02:51.350> get<00:02:51.500> rid<00:02:51.680> of<00:02:51.709> those<00:02:51.860> mistakes<00:02:52.570> you<00:02:53.570> know

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
would get rid of those mistakes you know

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.420 
would get rid of those mistakes you know
five<00:02:53.930> days<00:02:54.200> four<00:02:54.560> days<00:02:54.620> before<00:02:54.769> the<00:02:55.220> first

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
five days four days before the first

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.250 
five days four days before the first
conference<00:02:55.940> game<00:02:56.060> so<00:02:56.450> it<00:02:56.900> would<00:02:56.989> be<00:02:57.079> a<00:02:57.110> big

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
conference game so it would be a big

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.610 
conference game so it would be a big
challenge<00:02:57.500> for<00:02:57.799> us<00:02:57.950> and<00:02:58.280> practice<00:02:59.120> for<00:02:59.470> us<00:03:00.470> to

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
challenge for us and practice for us to

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.229 
challenge for us and practice for us to
focus<00:03:00.769> on<00:03:01.100> the<00:03:01.190> things<00:03:01.340> we<00:03:01.549> need<00:03:01.730> to<00:03:01.760> focus<00:03:01.940> on

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:02.239 
focus on the things we need to focus on

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:05.830 
focus on the things we need to focus on
to<00:03:02.329> get<00:03:02.450> a<00:03:02.480> heck<00:03:02.600> a<00:03:02.630> lot<00:03:02.720> better<00:03:04.780> fumble<00:03:05.780> the

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
to get a heck a lot better fumble the

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.740 
to get a heck a lot better fumble the
ball<00:03:05.870> out<00:03:06.019> of<00:03:06.049> bounds<00:03:06.200> of<00:03:06.470> the<00:03:06.590> same

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
ball out of bounds of the same

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.240 
ball out of bounds of the same
seemed<00:03:08.750> like<00:03:08.780> didn't<00:03:09.530> really<00:03:09.709> even<00:03:09.770> go<00:03:10.040> in<00:03:10.160> the

hole what did JP it was steel I think on

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:14.470 
hole what did JP it was steel I think on
the<00:03:12.890> other<00:03:13.069> side<00:03:13.340> but<00:03:13.640> maybe<00:03:13.910> I<00:03:14.000> was<00:03:14.120> wrong<00:03:14.270> but

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
the other side but maybe I was wrong but

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.979 
the other side but maybe I was wrong but
I<00:03:14.750> was<00:03:15.349> so<00:03:15.500> frustrated<00:03:16.090> no<00:03:17.090> I<00:03:17.120> don't<00:03:17.750> try<00:03:17.930> to

know if you go back not that you should
just<00:03:58.370> try<00:03:58.519> to<00:03:58.640> take<00:03:58.790> my<00:03:58.940> word<00:03:59.060> for<00:03:59.330> it<00:03:59.360> I<00:03:59.660> said

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.170

focused<00:04:54.840> for<00:04:54.960> a<00:04:55.020> whole<00:04:55.199> game<00:04:55.439> is<00:04:55.620> something

00:04:55.969 --> 00:04:55.979 
focused for a whole game is something

00:04:55.979 --> 00:04:58.610
