00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
car as a mesh go into here let me move

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:14.570 
car as a mesh go into here let me move
this<00:02:13.530> out<00:02:13.620> of<00:02:13.709> the<00:02:13.800> way<00:02:13.890> kind<00:02:14.310> of<00:02:14.370> getting

cluttered and we'll press f4 to show the

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.220 
cluttered and we'll press f4 to show the
wireframe<00:02:18.390> model<00:02:19.349> and<00:02:20.660> we'll<00:02:21.660> do<00:02:21.810> is<00:02:22.050> we'll

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
wireframe model and we'll do is we'll

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.699 
wireframe model and we'll do is we'll
select<00:02:22.940> polygon<00:02:23.940> so<00:02:24.599> now<00:02:24.720> we<00:02:24.780> can<00:02:24.959> like<00:02:25.170> select

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
select polygon so now we can like select

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:28.940 
select polygon so now we can like select
polygons<00:02:26.640> at<00:02:27.209> a<00:02:27.239> time<00:02:27.569> and<00:02:27.810> I'm<00:02:28.709> going<00:02:28.920> to
