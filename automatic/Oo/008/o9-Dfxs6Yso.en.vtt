cutter<00:02:47.370> so<00:02:47.730> we're<00:02:48.180> gonna<00:02:48.270> get<00:02:48.480> a<00:02:48.540> third<00:02:48.810> of<00:02:48.900> a

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
cutter so we're gonna get a third of a

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:50.449 
cutter so we're gonna get a third of a
cup<00:02:49.080> of<00:02:49.140> butter<00:02:49.380> and<00:02:49.620> you<00:02:49.739> cut<00:02:49.980> it<00:02:50.100> in<00:02:50.190> and<00:02:50.400> you

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
cup of butter and you cut it in and you

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:51.920 
cup of butter and you cut it in and you
do<00:02:50.640> that<00:02:50.850> so<00:02:51.180> that<00:02:51.209> the<00:02:51.420> butter<00:02:51.570> actually

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
do that so that the butter actually

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.050 
do that so that the butter actually
stays<00:02:52.140> cold<00:02:52.470> because<00:02:52.800> if<00:02:53.100> you<00:02:53.220> melt<00:02:53.459> it<00:02:53.700> um

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060
