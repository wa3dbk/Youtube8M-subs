00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:07.830
 Hello, good afternoon, this is a 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:11.600
 small video tutorial in a van 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.250
 ford winstar model 96 

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:16.160
 and well, I think there have been 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:18.620
 tell you or what happened to you 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.810
 suddenly anticipated in the car and it starts to 

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:24.130
 listen to a similar revenue like this that 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:24.130
 they will listen next 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:35.110
 and sometimes the little pig is taken off 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:37.000
 and they see that it continues to bother and well 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:38.590
 more if you bring music in your in your 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.270
 truck is a bit annoying 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:45.390
 now to remove this little this 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.160
 this little problem has made me 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.950
 past that sometimes nothing more than new 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.350
 it's the ya-bean and sometimes it's like 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.420
 remove but then return that 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.850
 same problem so good if you 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.830
 the same thing happens to me as the only thing that 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.590
 have to do is remove the coverage 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:04.589
 that here on the steering wheel 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:07.110
 here is here this remember that for 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:11.010
 remove it first here below the 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.420
 steering wheel has three screws remove the 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.860
 three screws that are here that are of 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.980
 cross 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.390
 once removing those three screws 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:20.050
 proceed to remove the cover that goes 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.690
 back here 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:24.750
 just right under the lever 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:28.330
 speeds that you are as you can see 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.920
 is the building of ya bing this one already 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.590
 it was broken for I bought it if it's that 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:35.310
 needed 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:39.170
 once you have removed the cover 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:42.950
 from the steering wheel you go here to lavÃ­n 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:44.479
 and who already well can not be seen if 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.020
 they realize that there is a small 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:49.860
 pastillita 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:52.360
 I have not lost this one 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:57.480
 there is a small pillbox of rattlesnakes 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:57.480
 benzine that is precisely 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.450
 of this 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:09.000
 what is this pill that is here 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:12.180
 it even has nothing like a sheet that 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.790
 it's like a little mouse has a small 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.010
 little mouse and in the little thing like 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:20.910
 black plastic at the end are not going to give 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:22.490
 mind that the little one is bent and hits 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.950
 here 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:27.780
 with him and bean then hit here 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:31.170
 this little thing that they see is more 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.540
 worn it hits this thing that is 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.719
 here 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:38.299
 the latita sticks here in the keyhole and makes 

00:02:35.719 --> 00:02:42.439
 that annoying noise the only thing we do 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:45.530
 is pulling the latch out towards 

00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:48.969
 outside so that no longer touch the latchkey 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.969
 because if I touched it 

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:55.670
 that's what happens just withdraw 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:59.240
 the little mouse with a little effort 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:01.340
 so that it does not touch and ready it is not going to give 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:03.140
 that annoying noise 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:06.170
 and good as you see in three minutes what 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:08.300
 we solved like that is that that's all for 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:11.150
 my part keep watching more videos 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:13.310

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.840

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:16.550
 problem and here with what is the bomb 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.320
 of gas 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:19.670
 the fuel pump is fine but 

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:22.910
 it always marks me bad reading 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:26.020
