00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:12.440 
I think it's it's early I don't feel

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:15.730 
I think it's it's early I don't feel
like<00:04:12.680> I<00:04:12.980> have<00:04:13.700> the<00:04:14.000> possibility<00:04:14.480> to<00:04:15.110> coach

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:18.170

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:21.400 
full-time and I think when you're a
coach<00:04:18.470> you<00:04:18.890> really<00:04:19.190> need<00:04:19.459> to<00:04:20.360> get<00:04:20.570> everyday<00:04:20.930> at
