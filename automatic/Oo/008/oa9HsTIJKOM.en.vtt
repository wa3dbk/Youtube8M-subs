00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:09.680
 Okay, Jarvis, I just released my home address to a terrorist and called me to a duel ... 

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:12.240
 I want you to stop all unnecessary workflows 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.480
 and focus all your attention on protecting your house, okay? 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:16.560
 All right sir. 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.600
 Can I start the house party protocol now? 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:21.060
 Of course, why not? 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.640
 Atom charges! 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.560
 That is how VASEMBER 3 should have ended 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:36.640
 So who's hurt you? 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:38.900
 How do you know someone hurt in school? 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.240
 Because you're a middle-aged guy in a garage? 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.860
 Ohh. 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.320
 Take a kid, here's an armed flashlight, use it on the tyrant, or ... anyway. 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.400
 Is this legal? 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.540
 KIBORÍTASZ! 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.780
 Do you know that this is exactly the same story as "The Incredible Family"? 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.060
 We? No! 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.560
 DEEE. 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:57.060
 It's not! 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:58.200
 That's it. 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.300
 I met you long ago, I hurt you 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.680
 what you snapped and now you are super evil, you're better off and temporarily in captivity. 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:05.660
 One is the same. 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:06.420
 Not at all... 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.640
 First of all: 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.160
 I am surprised that Tony Stark knows the film at all to refer to it. 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:12.378
 Secondly: 

00:01:12.378 --> 00:01:14.698
 What do you mean, "temporarily in captivity"? 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.320
 Your hands are permanently attached to the quick binder. You're not going anywhere! 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.640
 You are Shard, and I'm Mr. Unshaven. 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.100
 Not the same! I breathe fire! 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.700
 I even have a black friend who helps fight the evil ... 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:27.854
 AND also has a super suit. 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:29.900
 God, this is really the incredible family. 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:32.340
 Do you know what's upset? 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:33.180
 We? 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.320
 When the president is held captive in Iron Patriot armor ... 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:37.920
 the armor is useless. 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.020
 But when Rhodes takes it, it works perfectly suddenly. 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:42.640
 Is that bothering you? 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:43.640
 Yes, this. 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.320
 Do you know what's upset? 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.520
 How did you get back to Gotham ... 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.760
 after you got out of that prison on the other side of the world? 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:50.700
 Explain this! 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.280
 Why does this disturb so many people? I already told you: 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.700
 Because I'm Batman! 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.560
 Come back to the story, please? 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:57.340
 Good, keep going. 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:09.600
 How's your bra not burning in the fire? 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:10.300
 We? 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.060
 Tony! 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.060
 The world is in danger, let's gather! We need you! 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.340
 Rawrr, Revenge. 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.060
 I need Tony. 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:19.380
 You need armor! 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:20.775
 Ohh, are you still HERE? 

00:02:20.994 --> 00:02:23.274
 Sorry, I blasted them all now. 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.080
 I've changed. 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.600
 WHY Did You Explode Them ?! 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:28.760
 Well metaphorically ... 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.060
 to show Pepper that it is more important than any mission and ... 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:32.360
 I'm more like a armor. 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:33.920
 Plus Christmas. 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.940
 Hazaaaah! 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.300
 I heard your call brothers! 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.060
 Let's fight for victory! 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:41.940
 Tony blasted all his armor! 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.320
 What, what? 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:44.660
 Why would you do that? 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.660
 Yes, Stark dropped out ... 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.220
 He's over. 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.780
 But I have an alternative. 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.220
 Pepper, practically like Terminator 2 ... 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:55.680
 Do you want to reserve Tony's place? 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:56.400
 I? 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.260
 Yes, little girl! Do you want to save the world? 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:58.760
 Seriously? 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:00.740
 That sounds pretty exciting! 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:02.240
 You can't replace it. What's going on? 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:03.985
 He killed Mandarin. 

00:03:03.985 --> 00:03:07.360
 With my technology! I blasted the clothes, but that doesn't mean 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:08.944
 that I'm not a Iron Man! 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:10.980
 Are you coming with us? 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:11.480
 Of course! 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.740
 Ohh, thank you guys! Come on! Pepper! 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:15.780
 I love you baby! 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:17.800
 You can't replace it! 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:19.840
 I'm Iron Man! Hear ?! 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.340
 I AM YOU! 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:24.600
 Like Jarvis! 

00:03:27.374 --> 00:03:29.374
 So are you retired or what? 

00:03:29.374 --> 00:03:31.094
 I don't know YOU are retired ?! 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.440
 I'm certainly not. 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:35.020
 I'm just getting started. 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.120
 Here, do you get me? 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.120
 What the...? Blow! 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.166
 I'll be back! 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:41.740
 Reboooooot! 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:46.720
 I'm Iron Man. 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:47.500
 I'm Batman! 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.000
 Get the "Mandarin Margarine" today! 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.860
 You never see how this butter imitation arrives. 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.000
 I know total disappointment ...
