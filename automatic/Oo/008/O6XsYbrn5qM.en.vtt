00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.030
 to be warm in the winter it is necessary 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:04.830
 isolate his house 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.690
 we can do it thanks to the insulation in 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.519
 fiberglass a material we 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.710
 installs inside the walls and the 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.110
 roof and we recognize its color 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.910
 pink features in isolating well 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.590
 your interior you could reduce 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.460
 considerably your consumption 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.260
 energy 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.760
 like what to see life in pink 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.760
 to think green 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.800
 what is the pink matter that helps 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:33.160
 think green fiberglass insulation 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:36.130
 which compound in 35% recycled glass 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:38.440
 it also includes vitrified mixture abl 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:40.239
 that is, a lot of sand and 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:43.230
 smaller amounts of carbonate of 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:46.239
 limestone sodium and other minerals 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.280
 recycled glass called cullet 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:52.020
 comes from bottles or windows 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:54.790
 this will be his second recycling 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.979
 the ingredients of the cullet and the mixture 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:59.070
 vitrified at bhl pours into an oven 

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:59.070
 electric 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:06.100
 the conveyor belt moves so as to 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:09.520
 divide the ingredients of the cullet and 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:12.010
 reliable dairy mixture it infiltrates and 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.450
 melt in the previous batch that 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:16.560
 has now become a puddle of 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.560
 glass at the bottom of the oven 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:24.260
 the molten glass escapes from the oven and 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:26.330
 flows in channels inclined to 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:28.220
 inside these channels burns 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:31.130
 natural gas keep the 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.740
 very high temperature this keeps the 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.120
 glass mixture in liquid form 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.790
 as it flows through holes at 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:40.010
 bottom of wedges in the melt green 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:43.760
 makes a drop of one meter in a tank 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:45.800
 which is called a sector in 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:48.170
 turning the glass is projected through 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:50.320
 thousands of verture in the tank this 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:53.570
 which creates as many thin fiberglass 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:55.460
 gases and compressed air it pulls them 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:58.190
 fibers to make them even more 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:01.850
 thin this process is similar to that 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:04.070
 which is used to prepare cotton candy 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:07.600
 but soon the fibers will look like 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.600
 even more to cotton candy 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:12.880
 nozzles spray them with a primer 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:14.310
 made of polymer glue tinted with 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.020
 a pink dye 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:20.280
 fibers tend to hole in the ground 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:20.280
 and form clusters 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.689
 a conveyor belt stuffs its 

00:02:23.329 --> 00:02:25.689
 moorings 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.450
 steel plates compress the pile 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:34.359
 when she enters the oven that 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:37.560
 heats to 260 degrees celsius warm air 

00:02:34.359 --> 00:02:40.329
 seep through by fixing the glue 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.310
 while the battery comes out of the oven and 

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:46.590
 circular saws the slice in bank 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.590
 from 38 to 60 cm wide 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:52.480
 these bands goes through a series of rods 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.480
 which separates them 

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:58.160
 then an inkjet prints on each 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.680
 gang 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.680
 a number that corresponds to its factor r 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.450
 it is the thermal resistance factor 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.340
 of the material it indicates how much 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.260
 the insulation prevents the heat from 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.510
 escape from your roof by doing 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.810
 climb your electricity bill by 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.810
 the very fact 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:23.349
 now a big copa machine 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.670
 heaped steel teeth and bands 

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:27.230
 she's making big blocks of it 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:31.280
 could easily installed in a 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:34.040
 attic or wall after cutting the 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:36.319
 conveyor belt accelerates to deliver 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:39.190
 the fiberglass mats to the next 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:39.190
 workplace 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:45.280
 and now the mats falls into a 

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:47.960
 slide in small groups 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.250
 they reach a mechanical arm that 

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:51.580
 pushes them into a room of 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:51.580
 compression 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:57.099
 made there a hydraulic cylinder compresses 

00:03:54.879 --> 00:04:00.250
 the mats by reducing their volumes of 

00:03:57.099 --> 00:04:04.620
 5 to 10 times 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:04.620
 this compaction facilitates their transport 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:13.239
 at this stage another one to a 

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:15.069
 emerge from the side and push the stack of 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:18.130
 compressed mats in a head of 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:21.400
 filling this filling head 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:25.139
 is a hollow frame in the form of mats a 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:27.419
 worker and puts on a plastic bag 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:30.390
 the childhood jack the fiber NAALC 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:32.490
 glass in the plastic bag 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:34.850
 then the operation starts again for the 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:34.850
 next 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:45.480
 a conveyor belt brings the bags 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:48.380
 filled with mats to a machine he 

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:48.380
 is the hot one 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:54.840
 that's the sphere and the fiberglass is 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.840
 in the bag
