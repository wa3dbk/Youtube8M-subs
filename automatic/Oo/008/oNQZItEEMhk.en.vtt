the idea I put hot water in here
actually<00:01:39.780> use<00:01:40.110> my<00:01:40.290> Keurig<00:01:40.680> system<00:01:41.159> and<00:01:42.170> really

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
actually use my Keurig system and really

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.760 
actually use my Keurig system and really
easy<00:01:43.380> to<00:01:43.619> put<00:01:43.770> hot<00:01:43.920> water<00:01:43.979> in<00:01:44.369> you<00:01:45.619> take<00:01:46.619> this

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
easy to put hot water in you take this

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.830 
easy to put hot water in you take this
top<00:01:47.009> off<00:01:47.189> obviously<00:01:47.460> and<00:01:48.180> you<00:01:48.479> put<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.720> water

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
top off obviously and you put the water

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.340 
top off obviously and you put the water
in<00:01:48.960> how<00:01:49.799> do<00:01:49.860> you<00:01:50.520> take<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.149> water<00:01:51.270> out<00:01:51.390> well

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
in how do you take the water out well

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.530 
in how do you take the water out well
it's<00:01:52.619> very<00:01:52.740> simple<00:01:53.130> so<00:01:53.790> see<00:01:53.939> the<00:01:54.090> top<00:01:54.270> here<00:01:54.509> I

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
it's very simple so see the top here I

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.630 
it's very simple so see the top here I
just<00:01:54.600> pressed<00:01:54.960> it<00:01:55.110> down<00:01:55.170> and<00:01:55.799> there's<00:01:56.579> a

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
just pressed it down and there's a

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.270 
just pressed it down and there's a
little<00:01:56.759> piece<00:01:57.119> here<00:01:57.299> that<00:01:57.600> opens<00:01:57.979> so<00:01:58.979> you<00:01:59.040> take

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
little piece here that opens so you take

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:08.840 
little piece here that opens so you take
your<00:01:59.430> hot<00:01:59.549> water<00:01:59.790> and<00:02:00.210> you<00:02:00.450> pour<00:02:00.630> it<00:02:00.810> in

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:08.850 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:10.880 

right<00:02:09.850> right<00:02:10.270> there

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
right right there

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:16.530 
right right there
and<00:02:11.890> put<00:02:12.820> your<00:02:12.940> bottle<00:02:13.330> in<00:02:14.820> pretty<00:02:15.820> cool<00:02:16.030> eh<00:02:16.060> so

a<00:02:16.570> couple<00:02:17.230> other<00:02:17.380> quick<00:02:17.650> tips<00:02:17.860> before<00:02:18.160> you<00:02:18.370> go

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
a couple other quick tips before you go

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.350 
a couple other quick tips before you go
don't<00:02:18.850> leave<00:02:19.740> your<00:02:20.740> timer<00:02:21.070> so<00:02:21.610> of<00:02:21.880> course<00:02:22.150> it

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
don't leave your timer so of course it

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.910 
don't leave your timer so of course it
doesn't<00:02:22.510> have<00:02:22.720> a<00:02:22.750> timer<00:02:23.020> so<00:02:23.320> buy<00:02:23.470> one<00:02:23.680> of<00:02:23.710> these

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
doesn't have a timer so buy one of these

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.820 
doesn't have a timer so buy one of these
at<00:02:24.310> the<00:02:24.910> dollar<00:02:25.090> store<00:02:25.210> for<00:02:25.660> a<00:02:26.020> dollar<00:02:26.080> two<00:02:26.650> and

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
at the dollar store for a dollar two and

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.660 
at the dollar store for a dollar two and
you<00:02:26.890> can<00:02:27.040> time<00:02:27.280> your<00:02:27.670> formula<00:02:28.210> or<00:02:28.630> breast<00:02:29.050> milk

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
you can time your formula or breast milk

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
you can time your formula or breast milk
to<00:02:30.670> make<00:02:30.790> sure<00:02:30.940> that's<00:02:31.150> the<00:02:31.330> perfect

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
to make sure that's the perfect

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.470 
to make sure that's the perfect
temperature<00:02:31.990> okay<00:02:32.830> the<00:02:33.760> other<00:02:33.820> thing<00:02:34.120> is<00:02:34.240> you

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
temperature okay the other thing is you

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:35.820 
temperature okay the other thing is you
can<00:02:34.510> take<00:02:34.780> this<00:02:34.900> hot<00:02:35.110> water<00:02:35.260> and<00:02:35.620> you<00:02:35.680> can

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
can take this hot water and you can

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:38.130 
can take this hot water and you can
actually<00:02:36.250> make<00:02:36.700> formula<00:02:37.030> with<00:02:37.420> it<00:02:37.630> that's<00:02:37.990> the

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
actually make formula with it that's the

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:39.930 
actually make formula with it that's the
other<00:02:38.230> really<00:02:38.710> great<00:02:38.830> advantage<00:02:39.670> of<00:02:39.820> the

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
other really great advantage of the

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.200 
other really great advantage of the
system<00:02:40.330> so<00:02:41.020> you<00:02:41.250> use<00:02:42.250> that<00:02:42.460> hot<00:02:42.610> water<00:02:42.820> you

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:43.210 
system so you use that hot water you

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:44.760 
system so you use that hot water you
make<00:02:43.360> your<00:02:43.510> own<00:02:43.540> formula<00:02:44.200> and<00:02:44.350> you're<00:02:44.470> good<00:02:44.620> to

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:44.770 
make your own formula and you're good to

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:48.060 
make your own formula and you're good to
go<00:02:44.800> and<00:02:46.110> we<00:02:47.110> have<00:02:47.200> another<00:02:47.500> one<00:02:47.680> really

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.070
