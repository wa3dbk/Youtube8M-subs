00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:05.790
 each of us loves evening walks 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.280
 the city 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.950
 when everything is full of bright signs 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.250
 fanciful lanterns and hurried headlights 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.650
 home 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.630
 cars at such a time constantly 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.100
 bumping into interesting shots which 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.779
 would love to keep myself on 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.730
 memory or show friends 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.710
 but compact cameras and smartphones 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.630
 physically incapable of remembering that 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.119
 the beauty that you see with your own eyes 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.160
 all because of the modest amount of light and 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.900
 a large difference in brightness to 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.610
 get a cool result for you 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.530
 need a camera with a big 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.570
 sensor and holy strong lens 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.940
 habitually considered that such signs 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.219
 Only SLRs actually possess 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.170
 no mirrorless cameras handle 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.969
 such a task with the same success can 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.950
 even better because the matrix they have the same 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:50.489
 And glass can be chosen to suit every taste. 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.840
 color and mood fujifilm x 11 of 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.449
 best representatives without a mirror 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.699
 brotherhood and shooting in the dark its strong 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.829
 seahorse while other apparatuses 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:02.129
 will produce a disturbing eye noise on 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:04.170
 sensitivity iso 1600 3 200 for x1 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.510
 will be well developed and low noise 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.790
 The picture who of you did not try beautifully 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.560
 take a picture of the sunset probably all and 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.600
 every time you come across the same 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.549
 same problem well how to convey that 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.439
 beautiful gradient shades in the sky 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.180
 who sees the eye for such a task 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.280
 need a sensor with a large 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.820
 dynamic range well in general such 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.369
 as here 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:26.040
 may the dark power of sunset come with us 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.600
 one of the most beautiful properties of the evening 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.790
 the lights in the city create this 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.890
 amazing tanks in the background is true for 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.290
 This will need a high-aperture lens. 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.299
 better fix which can blur well 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.670
 background in each mirrorless 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.050
 the system has such an instance checks and fuji 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.580
 no exception and 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:43.320
 ruler almost all lenses 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:45.150
 luminous and allow to achieve 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.550
 beautiful results in the night city 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:50.040
 It's no secret that evening shots are often 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:51.720
 suffer from the wrong shades for everything 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.130
 need to blame automatics which is not 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.760
 managed to set the balance correctly 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.490
 white 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:57.930
 Our camera with this everything is fine, you can 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.880
 of course use and built 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.710
 flash to illuminate a portrait but you 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.600
 do not want to get a passport photo 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.230
 with a frightened face and eyes like a 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.820
 the vampire 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:07.650
 by the way here the flash has not 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.660
 regulated hack for shooting in 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:11.400
 indoors rotate upright position 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.300
 to create soft diffused light 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.950
 from the ceiling 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.140
 no one certainly interferes fasten on 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.060
 hot shoe and full flash search 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.130
 or synchronizer and use 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.320
 illuminator in the distance all these 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.820
 charms opportunity compact and light 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.220
 new generation camera 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:30.380
 mirrorless camera and finally we 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.380
 out of the dark a camera without a mirror
