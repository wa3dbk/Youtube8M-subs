like I wanted to define the crease a

00:05:18.999 --> 00:05:20.850 
like I wanted to define the crease a
little<00:05:19.029> bit<00:05:19.479> further<00:05:19.749> so<00:05:20.259> I'm<00:05:20.379> taking<00:05:20.559> my

00:05:29.619 --> 00:05:32.009 
would have probably smudged my base
makeup<00:05:29.889> or<00:05:30.429> could<00:05:30.759> have<00:05:30.849> created<00:05:31.389> a<00:05:31.539> fall<00:05:31.809> down
