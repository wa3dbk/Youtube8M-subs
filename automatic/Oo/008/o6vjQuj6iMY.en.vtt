00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
percent that was right after our trials

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.420 
percent that was right after our trials
when<00:01:22.110> Michael<00:01:22.439> had<00:01:22.560> just<00:01:22.590> shown<00:01:22.950> that<00:01:23.159> he<00:01:23.280> was

when Michael had just shown that he was

when Michael had just shown that he was
on<00:01:23.460> fire<00:01:23.909> I<00:01:24.420> was<00:01:25.259> seventy-five<00:01:26.040> percent

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
on fire I was seventy-five percent

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.380 
on fire I was seventy-five percent
confident<00:01:27.150> it<00:01:27.299> was<00:01:28.110> usually<00:01:28.740> 60<00:01:29.490> 40<00:01:29.820> against

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
confident it was usually 60 40 against

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.929 
confident it was usually 60 40 against
70<00:01:30.930> 30<00:01:31.229> against<00:01:31.710> when<00:01:32.159> he<00:01:32.250> broke<00:01:32.430> his<00:01:32.610> wrist

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
70 30 against when he broke his wrist

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.600 
70 30 against when he broke his wrist
this<00:01:33.210> fall<00:01:33.509> before<00:01:33.720> it<00:01:34.200> was<00:01:34.320> a<00:01:34.380> t20<00:01:35.100> I<00:01:35.250> actually

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
this fall before it was a t20 I actually

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.550 
this fall before it was a t20 I actually
i<00:01:35.820> might<00:01:36.000> have<00:01:36.119> said<00:01:36.150> 90<00:01:36.630> 10<00:01:36.979> against<00:01:38.180> doing<00:01:39.180> it

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
i might have said 90 10 against doing it

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.899 
i might have said 90 10 against doing it
so<00:01:40.560> it<00:01:40.680> wasn't<00:01:41.009> like<00:01:41.159> we<00:01:41.310> came<00:01:41.490> into<00:01:41.700> work

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
so it wasn't like we came into work

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.880 
so it wasn't like we came into work
every<00:01:42.270> day<00:01:42.299> and<00:01:42.720> we<00:01:42.840> really<00:01:43.140> were<00:01:43.259> motivated

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
every day and we really were motivated

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.350 
every day and we really were motivated
and<00:01:44.040> we<00:01:44.159> really<00:01:44.430> thought<00:01:44.610> it<00:01:44.670> was<00:01:44.850> going<00:01:45.060> well

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
and we really thought it was going well

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.850 
and we really thought it was going well
it<00:01:45.630> was<00:01:46.049> there<00:01:46.200> were<00:01:46.290> times<00:01:46.560> where<00:01:46.770> you<00:01:46.799> just

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
it was there were times where you just

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.210 
it was there were times where you just
have<00:01:47.130> to<00:01:47.250> come<00:01:47.460> in<00:01:47.670> and<00:01:47.820> do<00:01:48.329> it<00:01:48.509> because<00:01:49.220> you

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
have to come in and do it because you

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.880 
have to come in and do it because you
have<00:01:50.399> faith<00:01:50.729> that<00:01:50.759> it's<00:01:51.149> going<00:01:51.299> to<00:01:51.360> work<00:01:51.570> out

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
have faith that it's going to work out

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.910 
have faith that it's going to work out
you<00:01:52.890> know<00:01:53.119> fake<00:01:54.119> it<00:01:54.149> till<00:01:54.479> you<00:01:54.600> make<00:01:54.630> it

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
you know fake it till you make it

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.130 
you know fake it till you make it
there's<00:01:55.920> something<00:01:56.159> to<00:01:56.460> that<00:01:57.140> particularly

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
there's something to that particularly

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.190 
there's something to that particularly
in<00:01:58.290> coaching<00:01:59.180> so<00:02:00.180> I<00:02:00.210> think<00:02:00.540> that's<00:02:00.899> what<00:02:01.079> your

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
in coaching so I think that's what your

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.870 
in coaching so I think that's what your
dream<00:02:01.439> does<00:02:01.680> your<00:02:01.920> dream<00:02:02.070> kind<00:02:02.280> of<00:02:02.430> get<00:02:02.579> keeps

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
dream does your dream kind of get keeps

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.490 
dream does your dream kind of get keeps
you<00:02:03.030> going<00:02:03.180> through<00:02:03.540> those<00:02:03.689> tough<00:02:03.960> times<00:02:03.990> and

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
you going through those tough times and

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.289 
you going through those tough times and
the<00:02:04.890> most<00:02:05.100> important<00:02:05.579> thing<00:02:05.700> you<00:02:05.820> dream<00:02:06.060> does

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
the most important thing you dream does

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.100 
the most important thing you dream does
is<00:02:06.479> it<00:02:06.960> stimulates<00:02:07.590> creative<00:02:08.099> thought<00:02:09.110> starts

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
is it stimulates creative thought starts

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.199 
is it stimulates creative thought starts
making<00:02:10.440> you<00:02:10.560> think<00:02:10.890> about<00:02:11.099> what<00:02:11.459> you<00:02:11.580> can<00:02:11.610> do

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
making you think about what you can do

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.850 
making you think about what you can do
and<00:02:12.480> what<00:02:13.140> is

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
and what is

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.550 
and what is
civil<00:02:14.130> and<00:02:14.310> it<00:02:14.580> all<00:02:14.700> starts<00:02:15.030> with<00:02:15.120> a<00:02:15.180> question

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
civil and it all starts with a question

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.350 
civil and it all starts with a question
and<00:02:16.560> I<00:02:17.370> think<00:02:17.400> that's<00:02:17.760> what<00:02:17.940> you<00:02:17.970> have<00:02:18.120> to<00:02:18.210> do

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
and I think that's what you have to do

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.700 
and I think that's what you have to do
once<00:02:18.570> you<00:02:18.690> kind<00:02:18.810> of<00:02:18.900> get<00:02:19.020> this<00:02:19.170> idea<00:02:19.560> in<00:02:19.680> your

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:19.710 
once you kind of get this idea in your

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:21.890 
once you kind of get this idea in your
head<00:02:19.830> of<00:02:20.010> where<00:02:20.280> you<00:02:20.430> want<00:02:20.640> to<00:02:20.730> be<00:02:20.940> and<00:02:21.210> and<00:02:21.690> how

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
head of where you want to be and and how

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.270 
head of where you want to be and and how
do<00:02:21.960> you<00:02:22.020> feel<00:02:22.290> about<00:02:22.320> it<00:02:22.740> because<00:02:23.010> it's<00:02:23.160> an

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
do you feel about it because it's an

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.710 
do you feel about it because it's an
emotional<00:02:23.760> thing<00:02:23.820> I<00:02:24.060> think<00:02:24.210> the<00:02:24.300> dream<00:02:24.570> is

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
emotional thing I think the dream is

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.320 
emotional thing I think the dream is
largely<00:02:25.020> emotional<00:02:25.830> you<00:02:26.490> start<00:02:26.820> thinking

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
largely emotional you start thinking

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.380 
largely emotional you start thinking
about<00:02:27.830> what<00:02:28.830> you<00:02:28.890> need<00:02:29.100> to<00:02:29.220> do<00:02:29.400> and<00:02:29.640> that's<00:02:30.090> the

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
about what you need to do and that's the

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.300 
about what you need to do and that's the
planning<00:02:30.810> phase<00:02:31.050> but<00:02:31.500> the<00:02:31.590> plan<00:02:31.830> starts<00:02:32.190> with

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
planning phase but the plan starts with

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.210 
planning phase but the plan starts with
the<00:02:32.400> question<00:02:33.410> you<00:02:34.410> have<00:02:34.650> to<00:02:34.770> ask<00:02:34.980> yourself

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
the question you have to ask yourself

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.260 
the question you have to ask yourself

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:05.180 
here today unless he had 18 gold medals
that's<00:04:04.140> what<00:04:04.290> it<00:04:04.320> was<00:04:04.440> going<00:04:04.620> to<00:04:04.709> take<00:04:04.830> it<00:04:05.040> was

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
that's what it was going to take it was

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:06.949 
that's what it was going to take it was
going<00:04:05.310> to<00:04:05.370> take<00:04:05.519> something<00:04:05.820> great<00:04:06.269> not<00:04:06.660> just

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959 
going to take something great not just

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:08.990 
going to take something great not just
good<00:04:07.200> not<00:04:07.230> just<00:04:07.500> six<00:04:08.010> he'd<00:04:08.190> already<00:04:08.310> won<00:04:08.459> six

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
good not just six he'd already won six

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.630 
good not just six he'd already won six
that<00:04:09.720> would<00:04:09.840> be<00:04:09.959> enough<00:04:10.230> for<00:04:10.440> most<00:04:10.980> people<00:04:11.430> for

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 
that would be enough for most people for

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:14.600 
that would be enough for most people for
ten<00:04:12.120> lifetimes<00:04:12.829> so<00:04:13.829> I<00:04:13.860> think<00:04:14.010> that<00:04:14.220> that<00:04:14.459> was

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:14.610 
ten lifetimes so I think that that was

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:16.520 
ten lifetimes so I think that that was
how<00:04:15.060> we<00:04:15.120> kind<00:04:15.420> of<00:04:15.540> got<00:04:15.660> started<00:04:16.109> about<00:04:16.169> that

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
how we kind of got started about that

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:18.800 
how we kind of got started about that
but<00:04:17.430> I<00:04:17.459> wanted<00:04:17.760> to<00:04:17.820> tell<00:04:18.000> you<00:04:18.060> the<00:04:18.269> true<00:04:18.510> story

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
but I wanted to tell you the true story

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:20.420 
but I wanted to tell you the true story
about<00:04:19.140> why<00:04:19.350> he<00:04:19.380> won<00:04:19.799> the<00:04:19.829> eight<00:04:20.130> gold<00:04:20.370> medals

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
about why he won the eight gold medals

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.730 
about why he won the eight gold medals
there<00:04:21.060> are<00:04:21.180> several<00:04:21.450> really<00:04:21.959> key<00:04:22.200> reasons

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
there are several really key reasons

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:26.720 
there are several really key reasons
behind<00:04:23.640> it<00:04:24.530> the<00:04:25.530> first

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:26.730
