have<00:00:23.820> a<00:00:23.850> deep<00:00:24.090> roster<00:00:24.300> so<00:00:24.630> we<00:00:24.750> were<00:00:24.810> able<00:00:24.960> to

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
have a deep roster so we were able to

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:26.779 
have a deep roster so we were able to
practice<00:00:25.590> five<00:00:25.769> on<00:00:25.920> five<00:00:26.130> every<00:00:26.369> day<00:00:26.400> we<00:00:26.670> have

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
I think that's good because usually you

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.210 
I think that's good because usually you
have<00:02:20.930> a<00:02:21.050> coach<00:02:21.200> he<00:02:21.320> only<00:02:21.470> gets<00:02:21.650> on<00:02:21.800> certain

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
have a coach he only gets on certain

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.430 
have a coach he only gets on certain
guys<00:02:22.400> and<00:02:22.730> that's<00:02:23.120> not<00:02:23.330> very<00:02:23.450> good<00:02:23.750> but<00:02:24.290> if<00:02:24.380> he

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
guys and that's not very good but if he

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:25.930 
guys and that's not very good but if he
gets<00:02:24.620> on<00:02:24.709> everybody<00:02:25.100> the<00:02:25.220> same<00:02:25.400> way<00:02:25.610> then<00:02:25.820> I

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
I'm 55 years old so of course there's a

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.910 
I'm 55 years old so of course there's a
process<00:02:55.340> to<00:02:55.370> what<00:02:55.970> would<00:02:56.209> I<00:02:56.269> do<00:02:56.420> and<00:02:56.920> hopefully

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
process to what would I do and hopefully

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.160 
process to what would I do and hopefully
I<00:02:58.370> learned<00:02:58.760> to<00:02:58.910> trust<00:02:59.090> the<00:02:59.330> players<00:02:59.540> more<00:02:59.870> and

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
I learned to trust the players more and

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.050 
I learned to trust the players more and
more<00:03:00.470> and<00:03:00.680> more<00:03:00.860> and<00:03:01.160> then<00:03:01.310> I<00:03:01.580> don't<00:03:01.760> have<00:03:01.910> to

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
more and more and then I don't have to

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.150 
more and more and then I don't have to
like<00:03:02.269> you<00:03:02.300> try<00:03:03.170> I<00:03:03.200> don't<00:03:03.470> have<00:03:03.769> to<00:03:03.920> try<00:03:04.100> to

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
like you try I don't have to try to

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.830 
like you try I don't have to try to
control<00:03:04.430> too<00:03:04.790> much<00:03:04.970> and<00:03:05.239> I<00:03:05.330> think<00:03:05.540> that's<00:03:05.690> the

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
control too much and I think that's the

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.420 
control too much and I think that's the
biggest<00:03:06.019> thing<00:03:06.200> I<00:03:06.410> need<00:03:06.590> you<00:03:06.620> to<00:03:06.769> work<00:03:07.280> on

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
whatever you keep telling the guys is

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:10.780 
whatever you keep telling the guys is
that<00:03:09.650> when<00:03:09.800> we<00:03:09.950> play<00:03:10.130> in<00:03:10.280> the<00:03:10.370> Danish<00:03:10.670> League

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
that when we play in the Danish League

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:12.580 
that when we play in the Danish League

a little bit the other way around that

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:20.199 
a little bit the other way around that
