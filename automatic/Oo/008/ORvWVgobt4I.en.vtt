 youtube 

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:26.349
 we went into the field today to test and 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:28.449
 evaluate how the stick and successor of the 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:30.939
 Power line qat as I go power one 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:31.660
 only the designation stick and the old 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:34.269
 model 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:36.430
 everything was new and never seen before 

00:00:34.269 --> 00:00:38.199
 boots that puts it 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:41.050
 in the boot camp in model 

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:42.970
 comparative in the market acts as the 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:46.239
 most impressive aspects have accumulated 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:49.390
 power 11 is the leather adjustment long 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:51.339
 little material between the foot and the ball, which 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:53.530
 makes it extremely comfortable 

00:00:51.339 --> 00:00:55.330
 taking into account the fact that it is 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:58.269
 a boot made of material 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:01:00.939
 your leather is made from 

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:03.930
 of an extremely high synthetic microfiber 

00:01:00.939 --> 00:01:06.820
 elastic and flexible call to give light 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.580
 The light attack is extremely thin. 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:12.040
 comfortable with the touched it is like a 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:15.340
 second skin comparable to the 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:17.380
 its competitor funai says adap 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:20.110
 light seems to embrace your foot for 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:22.510
 complete including the curvature of the sole 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.770
 foot which leaves its fit almost 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:26.080
 Perfect 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.510
 your flexibility does what you can 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.190
 withdraw the uterus from the box and 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:32.800
 direct to the field for the first session 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:37.330
 seamlessly use as points of 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:39.760
 friction pressure on the instep and 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:42.300
 on the front of the leather 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:45.340
 the technology that the puma calls alcohol 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:47.520
 are foam inserts that modify the 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:50.620
 ball control and kicks and passes 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.750
 against technology inserted in the 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:53.590
 the puma calls for ever fitch cheese and 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.720
 external 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.570
 it is a pretty rubber applique 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.310
 wire that provides stability and support 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:02.740
 to the foot 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:05.770
 The language is made of the same light 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:08.170
 two daughters of foam 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.599
 positioned to increase the comfort of the 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:13.540
 typing of records even if the 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:16.030
 Closer way with flooring is done 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.220
 in thinner packs in the area of ​​the beak of the foot 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.920
 with juices that allow great 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.319
 flexibility in both directions 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:26.189
 he has 11 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:28.019
 four clinics and seven longitudinal ones 

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:30.329
 traction and starting and 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:32.549
 direction and unmatched comfort 

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:34.439
 not having the inflection point that 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:36.749
 bothers during use 

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:39.450
 how flexible it is that it performs a 

00:02:36.749 --> 00:02:40.620
 important role in attracting and starting 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.260
 and racing 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:45.569
 no matter how much you change direction 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.969
 will always twist the direction of 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:49.500
 his movements proposed the clothing and a 

00:02:47.969 --> 00:02:52.319
 brings a package of technologies 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.510
 that in the end the difference 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:56.849
 during the 90 minutes of play 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.189
 according to studies made by the flea 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:01.859
 to kick a ball barefoot at 

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:04.409
 flexibility of the foot including the 

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:05.819
 curl of the fingers allows to generate more 

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:07.859
 kick power 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:10.500
 the movement directing the toes 

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:12.510
 and flex the sole of the foot back 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.639
 is something that is usually restricted from 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.829
 most of the cleats to solve this 

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:18.900
 problem the puma implemented a card 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:23.040
 in the floor of the celebrated paulo a 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:24.989
 called gsf gradual stability frei 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.000
 it allows your foot to flex 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:28.949
 naturally by hitting the ball 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.750
 just as Pierre managed the football is a 

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:33.209
 barefoot ball 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:35.579
 this movement is complemented and 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:38.280
 allowed by the elasticity of capital and 

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:41.250
 micro fifa adapt haiti that stretches 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:44.099
 longitudinally with respect to the foot or 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:47.299
 talking about weight at size 41 of the 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:49.349
 Brazil, she weighs exactly 200 and nine grams 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:51.750
 extremely lightweight for a 

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:54.150
 power in terms of size the size 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:56.310
 41 of Brazil corresponds to size 10 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:59.129
 from the United States what for me? 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:01.319
 became a little shade of the 

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:04.709
 space on the tip of the foot, which would 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:07.049
 number 40.5 ideal for me if you 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:09.180
 prefers a tighter football 

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:12.569
 I suggest you ask for a half size smaller than 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:14.849
 What do you usually wear the puma and I'm going to give birth 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:16.409
 one is a simple boot compared to 

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:17.459
 more complex in relation to peace 

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:19.049
 technological 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:20.639
 Imagine how much work or 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:22.770
 laboratory until there is how to present 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:24.509
 your show will have the body achieve 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:27.000
 play simplicity play 

00:04:24.509 --> 00:04:28.469
 bare feet really should not be easy 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.389
 the dedication with which the manufacturer 

00:04:28.469 --> 00:04:32.580
 developed that nike boot at the end 

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:34.620
 process that is field and play makes 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:36.900
 that the user does not remain indifferent 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:38.940
 I have used in whole numbers both 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:40.169
 of synthetic material as of worship but 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:42.210
 I've never used a model that 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:43.380
 would surprise us as positively as the 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.750
 like power 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:46.650
