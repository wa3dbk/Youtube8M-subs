00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
have to do is just find the objects as

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.760 
have to do is just find the objects as
fast<00:02:08.489> as<00:02:08.640> you<00:02:08.729> can<00:02:08.940> if<00:02:09.899> you<00:02:10.050> don't<00:02:10.229> find<00:02:10.379> one<00:02:10.619> in

like
example<00:02:11.480> I<00:02:11.510> think<00:02:11.540> it<00:02:11.840> gives<00:02:11.930> maybe<00:02:12.230> 34

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
example I think it gives maybe 34

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.910 
example I think it gives maybe 34
seconds<00:02:13.489> the<00:02:14.209> game<00:02:14.390> is<00:02:14.540> already<00:02:14.659> okay<00:02:15.230> so<00:02:15.709> here

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
seconds the game is already okay so here

there<00:02:21.920> it<00:02:22.069> is<00:02:22.129> padlock<00:02:23.200> 123<00:02:24.200> the<00:02:24.409> faster<00:02:24.739> you

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:24.829 
there it is padlock 123 the faster you

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:26.559 
there it is padlock 123 the faster you
big<00:02:25.069> things<00:02:25.340> the<00:02:25.760> more<00:02:25.939> points<00:02:26.269> you<00:02:26.390> get

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:26.569 
big things the more points you get

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:29.920 
big things the more points you get
scissors<00:02:27.879> 123<00:02:28.879> and<00:02:29.150> also<00:02:29.420> a<00:02:29.450> lot<00:02:29.750> of<00:02:29.780> the

objects<00:02:30.319> are<00:02:30.439> different<00:02:30.859> colors<00:02:31.010> so<00:02:31.340> it's<00:02:31.489> a

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:31.609 
objects are different colors so it's a

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:33.940 
objects are different colors so it's a
little<00:02:31.790> bit<00:02:31.879> harder<00:02:32.269> to<00:02:32.359> find<00:02:32.950> scissors

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
little bit harder to find scissors

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.759

right now it might look a little bit
easier<00:04:00.470> like<00:04:01.190> something<00:04:01.729> like<00:04:01.819> that<00:04:02.000> but<00:04:02.209> when

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:02.690 
easier like something like that but when

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:04.990 
easier like something like that but when
you<00:04:02.840> watch<00:04:03.379> it<00:04:03.409> watch<00:04:04.069> someone<00:04:04.459> play<00:04:04.489> it's<00:04:04.909> a

you watch it watch someone play it's a
lot<00:04:05.180> easier<00:04:05.650> than<00:04:06.650> when<00:04:07.190> you're<00:04:07.340> actually

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:07.489
