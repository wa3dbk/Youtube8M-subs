[♪]

00:00:11.386 --> 00:00:12.638
What's up beautiful people?

00:00:12.638 --> 00:00:14.097
It's your homegirl Shameless,

00:00:14.097 --> 00:00:18.727
all up in your building with
this cutie pa-tootie [laughs]

00:00:18.727 --> 00:00:19.728
Pierce.

00:00:19.728 --> 00:00:21.521
You guys might
recognize him from my channel,

00:00:21.521 --> 00:00:23.649
we did a Halloween video,

00:00:23.649 --> 00:00:25.317
and he was giving you,

00:00:25.317 --> 00:00:28.528
he was giving you
isolations, Birdman,

00:00:28.528 --> 00:00:30.197
but anyways I wanted to
bring him on my channel

00:00:30.197 --> 00:00:33.116
because Pierce is an
awesome talented dancer.

00:00:33.116 --> 00:00:36.745
He is young, he's so cute,

00:00:36.745 --> 00:00:39.831
and he has toured
with Miley Cyrus,

00:00:39.831 --> 00:00:41.792
you did the music video,
what was her name?

00:00:41.792 --> 00:00:44.169
- Kiesza. 
- Kiesza.

00:00:44.169 --> 00:00:45.379
MAYA: Brooklyn, one take right?

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:47.756
- Yeah. 
- So, he's pretty hot.

00:00:47.756 --> 00:00:49.800
So I wanted to get
him before he gets

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.219
too hot for this channel,

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:54.513
but you guys know I'm
all about inspiration,

00:00:54.513 --> 00:00:55.806
and being
shameless and all that,

00:00:55.806 --> 00:00:57.766
and I think Pierce is
a great example of that.

00:00:57.766 --> 00:01:02.437
So, I have a few
questions for, to Big Bird,

00:01:02.437 --> 00:01:06.316
how did you know
that this passion, love

00:01:06.316 --> 00:01:07.943
would turn into a career?

00:01:07.943 --> 00:01:09.236
It was the only thing
that made sense to me,

00:01:09.236 --> 00:01:10.779
at least dancing
and acting were.

00:01:10.779 --> 00:01:13.949
And, at least the
only things I could
emotionally like connect to.

00:01:13.949 --> 00:01:17.119
MAYA: Yeah. 
PIERCE: I think maybe like 19,

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:19.913
when Rhapsody James,
who is one of my mentors,

00:01:19.913 --> 00:01:21.748
love her to death, she
took me under her wing

00:01:21.748 --> 00:01:23.375
and I did her program,

00:01:23.375 --> 00:01:25.961
I realized I could
make it into a profession.

00:01:25.961 --> 00:01:28.505
How old were you
when you started dancing?

00:01:28.505 --> 00:01:31.758
I started dancing at 16
with ballet for like a year,

00:01:31.758 --> 00:01:33.844
and then I found out
about hip-hop at 17.

00:01:33.844 --> 00:01:36.305
What bumps in the
road did you encounter

00:01:36.305 --> 00:01:40.976
in the pursuits of your pursuit
of happiness and dance?

00:01:40.976 --> 00:01:42.602
A lot, honestly,

00:01:42.602 --> 00:01:46.315
well as I told you before,
I have Asperger's syndrome,

00:01:46.315 --> 00:01:48.692
that was kind of
difficult having to deal with,

00:01:48.692 --> 00:01:50.235
in this industry especially,

00:01:50.235 --> 00:01:51.778
like because it's like,

00:01:51.778 --> 00:01:55.699
we choose to be in this industry
that is filled with rejection,

00:01:55.699 --> 00:01:59.036
and I'm kind of
OK with rejection,

00:01:59.036 --> 00:02:01.496
because I'm kind of
blind to it almost,

00:02:01.496 --> 00:02:04.333
it's kind of
like, oh OK, whatever.

00:02:04.333 --> 00:02:06.335
So what's the challenge,
what's the roadblock?

00:02:06.335 --> 00:02:08.170
Uh, social
etiquette, I think at first --

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:09.463
MAYA: Oh, OK.

00:02:09.463 --> 00:02:10.881
And then I trained myself

00:02:10.881 --> 00:02:12.924
with the help of
like friends and family,

00:02:12.924 --> 00:02:16.303
like helped me associate better.

00:02:16.303 --> 00:02:18.263
When I first got
signed after like,

00:02:18.263 --> 00:02:20.640
right before I booked
Beyonce and my grandma died,

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.476
and then after my grandpa died,

00:02:22.476 --> 00:02:24.394
and then I tour my meniscus,

00:02:24.394 --> 00:02:26.897
so I had to get
knee surgery at 19,

00:02:26.897 --> 00:02:28.607
and it was fine,
it was like --

00:02:28.607 --> 00:02:29.733
MAYA: So could you dance?

00:02:29.733 --> 00:02:32.569
No, not for a month and a half,
but it was fine after that,

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:36.365
I got back on the
horse, quote unquote,

00:02:36.365 --> 00:02:39.493
and I booked a Macy's commercial
and a Pepsi commercial.

00:02:39.493 --> 00:02:40.994
MAYA: Great, yeah.

00:02:40.994 --> 00:02:44.915
And I did like a couple
of random music videos,

00:02:44.915 --> 00:02:46.875
and then I've just been hustling

00:02:46.875 --> 00:02:49.252
and trying to bust
my ass ever since,

00:02:49.252 --> 00:02:50.921
you know just --

00:02:50.921 --> 00:02:52.714
So it sounds like,
even though you,

00:02:52.714 --> 00:02:55.467
I mean these are
like major bumps.

00:02:55.467 --> 00:02:56.760
PIERCE: Yeah.

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.554
You still have
these major blessings

00:02:59.554 --> 00:03:00.722
in the process.

00:03:00.722 --> 00:03:01.723
PIERCE: If anything,

00:03:01.723 --> 00:03:03.058
if history has
taught us anything

00:03:03.058 --> 00:03:08.313
that humanity rises in the
greatest depressions of life,

00:03:08.313 --> 00:03:10.607
and like a Phoenix
from the ashes, almost.

00:03:10.607 --> 00:03:13.026
MAYA: He will
ascend into the sky!

00:03:13.026 --> 00:03:14.444
[laughter]

00:03:14.444 --> 00:03:15.862
You constantly
have to push yourself

00:03:15.862 --> 00:03:18.240
because -- and
keep going forward --

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:22.285
because that's the
only direction God gave us.

00:03:22.285 --> 00:03:23.912
MAYA: Yay!

00:03:23.912 --> 00:03:27.124
What's been your
favorite experience so far?

00:03:27.124 --> 00:03:28.667
There sounds like a lot.

00:03:28.667 --> 00:03:32.003
PIERCE: Miley Cyrus -- 
MAYA: Miley Cyrus! [laughs] Duh.

00:03:32.003 --> 00:03:34.965
PIERCE: It was nuts, wild.

00:03:34.965 --> 00:03:41.471
MAYA: What advice
would you give past Pierce?

00:03:41.471 --> 00:03:42.764
That's just like,

00:03:42.764 --> 00:03:45.100
I automatically
know to not give a fuck,

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.561
and when I say that there's
a big difference between

00:03:47.561 --> 00:03:49.604
not caring and
not giving a fuck.

00:03:49.604 --> 00:03:51.356
The difference is
I think with caring

00:03:51.356 --> 00:03:53.316
you have to care about someone's
emotion and everything,

00:03:53.316 --> 00:03:55.360
but when you're
not giving a fuck

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.113
has to do with your career
and your personal benefit,

00:03:58.113 --> 00:04:00.824
and not caring
about other's opinions,

00:04:00.824 --> 00:04:04.035
and not caring about what other
people have to say about you,

00:04:04.035 --> 00:04:08.415
and what they may do to
deter you from your path,

00:04:08.415 --> 00:04:10.333
like that's not giving a fuck.

00:04:10.333 --> 00:04:14.421
MAYA: Take the higher road.

00:04:14.421 --> 00:04:17.174
And what advice would
you give present Pierce?

00:04:17.174 --> 00:04:20.510
Honestly, to be a little
more ballsy than I already am,

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:22.971
like I'm pretty
balls, but sometimes I --

00:04:22.971 --> 00:04:24.639
MAYA: Just push, on the move?

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:26.975
PIERCE: I always push,
but sometimes I feel like

00:04:26.975 --> 00:04:27.934
I could push a little more.

00:04:27.934 --> 00:04:28.810
MAYA: More.

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:30.061
PIERCE: Not to
the extent of like,

00:04:30.061 --> 00:04:32.647
I'm not going to be on some
Gaga shit, like I'm really not,

00:04:32.647 --> 00:04:35.442
you're not going to see
me in bedazzled face wear,

00:04:35.442 --> 00:04:37.736
I promise none of
that, but um -- [laughter]

00:04:37.736 --> 00:04:41.114
So, to present Pierce
push a little bit more --

00:04:41.114 --> 00:04:42.365
PIERCE: Yeah. 
MAYA: -- than you already do?

00:04:42.365 --> 00:04:43.325
PIERCE: Yeah.

00:04:43.325 --> 00:04:45.452
And finally! My
last question is,

00:04:45.452 --> 00:04:49.122
where do you see yourself
in 5 years and in 10 years?

00:04:49.122 --> 00:04:50.665
A household name hopefully,

00:04:50.665 --> 00:04:53.376
and I don't know mean that
in a boasting kind of way.

00:04:53.376 --> 00:04:54.836
I really, I know
where I'm headed,

00:04:54.836 --> 00:04:56.046
and I know where I want to go,

00:04:56.046 --> 00:04:59.674
as well as, leading
my own foundation to

00:04:59.674 --> 00:05:01.802
bring money and light to kids

00:05:01.802 --> 00:05:04.763
with development
and social problems,

00:05:04.763 --> 00:05:08.892
as well as kids who
have learning disorders

00:05:08.892 --> 00:05:10.018
and things like that,

00:05:10.018 --> 00:05:14.356
just to show them that
like we can do it, you know?

00:05:14.356 --> 00:05:16.441
And that shouldn't be a
deterrent from their path,

00:05:16.441 --> 00:05:17.734
it should be something,

00:05:17.734 --> 00:05:19.861
if anything a blessing
in disguise, you know?

00:05:19.861 --> 00:05:21.363
Because I had to
learn later in life

00:05:21.363 --> 00:05:26.076
that my quote unquote disorder
was actually a blessing.

00:05:26.076 --> 00:05:31.039
It's not something that's
going to deter me from my path,

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:33.750
but actually help
me progress on it

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:36.044
if I learned how to
use it the right way.

00:05:36.044 --> 00:05:39.047
