00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:30.880 
my storm dragon's attack be sure to use
a<00:02:26.990> dragon<00:02:27.770> with<00:02:27.920> upgraded<00:02:28.640> si<00:02:28.880> attack<00:02:29.270> or<00:02:29.890> if

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
a dragon with upgraded si attack or if

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:32.860 
a dragon with upgraded si attack or if
you're<00:02:31.130> lucky<00:02:31.370> enough<00:02:31.580> and<00:02:31.970> you<00:02:32.120> get<00:02:32.300> to<00:02:32.540> go

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
you're lucky enough and you get to go

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.650 
you're lucky enough and you get to go
into<00:02:33.350> battle<00:02:33.560> first<00:02:34.150> alright<00:02:35.150> just<00:02:35.330> looking

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
into battle first alright just looking

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.770 
into battle first alright just looking
along<00:02:35.900> I<00:02:36.080> think<00:02:36.290> my<00:02:36.530> most<00:02:36.800> powerful<00:02:37.600> dragon<00:02:38.600> is

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
along I think my most powerful dragon is

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.980 
along I think my most powerful dragon is
this<00:02:39.200> dragon<00:02:39.740> I<00:02:40.060> don't<00:02:41.060> think<00:02:41.330> I<00:02:41.420> upgraded

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:41.990 
this dragon I don't think I upgraded

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:43.630 
this dragon I don't think I upgraded
this<00:02:42.140> dragons<00:02:42.620> attack<00:02:42.950> I<00:02:43.190> don't<00:02:43.400> think<00:02:43.580> I

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
this dragons attack I don't think I

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.570 
this dragons attack I don't think I
upgrade<00:02:44.090> any<00:02:44.330> si<00:02:44.750> attack<00:02:45.080> at<00:02:45.320> all<00:02:45.500> because<00:02:46.340> I'm

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
upgrade any si attack at all because I'm

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:49.360 
upgrade any si attack at all because I'm
not<00:02:46.700> really<00:02:46.910> into<00:02:47.030> si<00:02:47.630> I'm<00:02:48.110> usually<00:02:48.440> using

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
not really into si I'm usually using

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.260 
not really into si I'm usually using
legendary<00:02:49.970> dragons<00:02:50.510> so<00:02:50.720> let's<00:02:51.650> try<00:02:51.860> this

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:52.270 
legendary dragons so let's try this

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:55.360 
legendary dragons so let's try this
hopefully<00:02:53.270> we<00:02:53.540> do<00:02:53.780> get<00:02:54.110> this<00:02:54.440> but<00:02:54.860> if<00:02:54.980> we<00:02:55.010> don't

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
hopefully we do get this but if we don't

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.100 
hopefully we do get this but if we don't
then<00:02:55.730> we<00:02:55.880> might<00:02:56.060> have<00:02:56.120> to<00:02:56.390> go<00:02:56.540> into<00:02:56.750> battle

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110 
then we might have to go into battle

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:01.180 
then we might have to go into battle
again<00:02:57.560> if<00:02:57.830> we<00:02:58.610> get<00:02:58.820> are<00:02:59.120> we<00:02:59.420> wide<00:03:00.050> why<00:03:00.920> do<00:03:00.980> we

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
again if we get are we wide why do we

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.220 
again if we get are we wide why do we
never<00:03:01.430> get<00:03:01.820> first<00:03:02.060> attack<00:03:02.420> alright<00:03:02.900> we<00:03:03.050> did

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
never get first attack alright we did

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.160 
never get first attack alright we did
upgrade<00:03:03.740> this<00:03:04.640> dragon<00:03:05.150> with<00:03:05.360> whirlpool<00:03:05.660> so

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
upgrade this dragon with whirlpool so

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.480 
upgrade this dragon with whirlpool so
let's<00:03:06.410> use<00:03:06.590> whirlpool<00:03:09.070> alright<00:03:10.070> so<00:03:10.250> that<00:03:10.459> was

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:10.490 
let's use whirlpool alright so that was

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:14.320 
let's use whirlpool alright so that was
whirlpool<00:03:11.270> that<00:03:11.300> did<00:03:11.900> take<00:03:12.170> off<00:03:12.380> a<00:03:12.410> lot<00:03:13.330> so

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:14.330 
whirlpool that did take off a lot so

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:17.170 
whirlpool that did take off a lot so
definitely<00:03:14.989> use<00:03:15.260> an<00:03:15.470> upgraded<00:03:16.100> attack<00:03:16.790> like

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
definitely use an upgraded attack like

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.509 
definitely use an upgraded attack like
that<00:03:17.209> because<00:03:18.200> usually<00:03:19.070> if<00:03:19.220> you<00:03:19.370> don't

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:19.519 
that because usually if you don't

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:21.250 
that because usually if you don't
upgrade<00:03:19.730> your<00:03:20.150> attack<00:03:20.450> you<00:03:20.690> don't<00:03:20.930> have<00:03:21.230> a

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
upgrade your attack you don't have a

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.470 
upgrade your attack you don't have a
chance<00:03:21.590> because<00:03:21.920> this<00:03:22.130> dragon<00:03:22.640> has<00:03:23.090> more

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
chance because this dragon has more

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.960 
chance because this dragon has more
health<00:03:23.750> than<00:03:24.050> you<00:03:24.200> no<00:03:24.410> matter<00:03:24.620> what<00:03:25.040> if<00:03:25.340> you

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
health than you no matter what if you

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:28.030 
health than you no matter what if you
have<00:03:26.180> like<00:03:26.420> ten<00:03:27.080> thousand<00:03:27.620> it<00:03:27.769> will<00:03:27.890> have

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
have like ten thousand it will have

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:29.770 
have like ten thousand it will have
fifteen<00:03:28.519> thousand<00:03:28.940> if<00:03:29.030> you<00:03:29.150> have<00:03:29.269> twenty

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
fifteen thousand if you have twenty

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:31.600 
fifteen thousand if you have twenty
thousand<00:03:30.200> he<00:03:30.650> will<00:03:30.800> have<00:03:30.950> twenty-five

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:31.610 
thousand he will have twenty-five

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:33.280 
thousand he will have twenty-five
thousand<00:03:32.120> so<00:03:32.209> it's<00:03:32.360> always<00:03:32.540> like<00:03:32.840> that

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
thousand so it's always like that

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:35.350 
thousand so it's always like that
so<00:03:33.650> let's<00:03:33.890> we'll<00:03:34.070> use<00:03:34.220> whirlpool<00:03:34.820> again<00:03:35.120> I'm

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:35.360 
so let's we'll use whirlpool again I'm

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.180 
so let's we'll use whirlpool again I'm
pretty<00:03:35.570> sure<00:03:35.750> whirlpool<00:03:36.530> is<00:03:36.650> gonna<00:03:36.800> take<00:03:37.040> out

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:37.190 
pretty sure whirlpool is gonna take out

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:41.080 
pretty sure whirlpool is gonna take out
this<00:03:37.340> dragon<00:03:37.810> there<00:03:38.810> it<00:03:38.930> is
