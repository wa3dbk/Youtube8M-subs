00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:44.860 
already had a sec I'm gonna look I'd and
there<00:00:39.980> it's<00:00:40.790> big<00:00:41.780> water<00:00:42.730> it's<00:00:43.730> designed<00:00:44.690> for

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870 
there it's big water it's designed for

there it's big water it's designed for
the<00:00:48.010> DSLR<00:00:49.510> handheld<00:00:50.510> camera

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:51.080 
the DSLR handheld camera

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:56.140 
the DSLR handheld camera
I<00:00:52.180> believe<00:00:53.180> this<00:00:53.420> one<00:00:53.690> and<00:00:54.260> I<00:00:54.920> might<00:00:55.670> be

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:56.150 
I believe this one and I might be

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:57.730 
I believe this one and I might be
corrected<00:00:56.720> here<00:00:56.990> but<00:00:57.200> I<00:00:57.230> think<00:00:57.290> this<00:00:57.560> was

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:57.740 
corrected here but I think this was

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:03.580 
corrected here but I think this was
designed<00:00:58.220> to<00:00:59.500> take<00:01:00.500> the<00:01:01.510> big<00:01:02.510> red<00:01:02.810> as<00:01:03.320> it's
