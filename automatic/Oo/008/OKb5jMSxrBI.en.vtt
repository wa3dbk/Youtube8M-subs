be the entrance to this pipeline located

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.320 
be the entrance to this pipeline located
right<00:02:13.400> there<00:02:14.709> with<00:02:15.709> any<00:02:15.890> luck<00:02:16.090> we<00:02:17.090> should<00:02:17.120> be

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
right there with any luck we should be

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.300 
right there with any luck we should be
able<00:02:17.450> to<00:02:17.599> find<00:02:17.750> out<00:02:17.989> whether<00:02:18.860> or<00:02:19.040> not<00:02:19.129> this

00:04:24.909 --> 00:04:24.919 
dive because there's about 500 feet up

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:27.970 
dive because there's about 500 feet up
until<00:04:25.400> a<00:04:25.720> couple<00:04:26.720> minutes<00:04:26.930> ago<00:04:27.230> and<00:04:27.440> then<00:04:27.560> shot

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:27.980 
until a couple minutes ago and then shot

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:29.830 
until a couple minutes ago and then shot
up<00:04:28.100> to<00:04:28.250> about<00:04:28.370> a<00:04:28.430> hundred<00:04:28.520> which<00:04:29.419> is<00:04:29.570> well

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 
up to about a hundred which is well

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:31.690 
up to about a hundred which is well
within<00:04:30.050> his<00:04:30.320> diving<00:04:30.590> range<00:04:30.950> on<00:04:31.250> I'm<00:04:31.550> supposed

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:31.700 
within his diving range on I'm supposed

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:33.940 
within his diving range on I'm supposed
to<00:04:31.940> be<00:04:32.060> so<00:04:32.210> ago<00:04:32.390> yeah<00:04:32.870> but<00:04:33.530> that<00:04:33.650> makes<00:04:33.800> me

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:33.950 
to be so ago yeah but that makes me

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:35.920 
to be so ago yeah but that makes me
think<00:04:34.190> that<00:04:34.310> we're<00:04:34.520> actually<00:04:35.330> on<00:04:35.600> this

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:35.930 
think that we're actually on this

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:38.560 
think that we're actually on this
pipeline<00:04:36.169> and<00:04:36.740> uh<00:04:36.910> we<00:04:37.910> might<00:04:38.060> get<00:04:38.180> some<00:04:38.330> really

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:38.570 
pipeline and uh we might get some really

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:39.760 
pipeline and uh we might get some really
interesting<00:04:38.720> stuff<00:04:38.930> he's<00:04:39.290> going<00:04:39.440> to<00:04:39.500> go<00:04:39.590> down
