and I mean never want to go by but it's

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:48.620 
and I mean never want to go by but it's
a<00:01:47.610> good<00:01:47.760> habit<00:01:47.910> showing<00:01:48.270> you<00:01:48.390> got<00:01:48.540> that

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
a good habit showing you got that

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.330 
a good habit showing you got that
character<00:01:49.020> that<00:01:49.170> that<00:01:49.560> bottles<00:01:49.979> about<00:01:50.190> to

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
character that that bottles about to

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.070

Carla<00:02:18.660> doctrine<00:02:19.080> much<00:02:19.320> much<00:02:19.620> wrong<00:02:19.890> I<00:02:20.040> just<00:02:20.070> I

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
Carla doctrine much much wrong I just I

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:22.400 
Carla doctrine much much wrong I just I
wanted<00:02:20.970> to<00:02:21.060> just<00:02:21.180> make<00:02:21.360> a<00:02:21.390> change<00:02:21.720> to<00:02:21.840> see<00:02:22.350> if

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
wanted to just make a change to see if

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.350 
wanted to just make a change to see if
it<00:02:22.530> made<00:02:22.620> a<00:02:22.650> difference<00:02:22.830> there<00:02:23.820> was<00:02:23.940> no<00:02:24.090> slight

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
it made a difference there was no slight

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.560 
it made a difference there was no slight
on<00:02:24.540> and<00:02:24.810> on<00:02:24.959> Kyle<00:02:25.200> at<00:02:25.380> all<00:02:25.560> and<00:02:25.770> Josh<00:02:26.550> grew<00:02:27.300> into

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
on and on Kyle at all and Josh grew into

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:30.620 
on and on Kyle at all and Josh grew into
the<00:02:27.660> game<00:02:27.810> I<00:02:28.080> thought<00:02:28.970> as<00:02:29.970> the<00:02:30.180> game<00:02:30.360> went<00:02:30.450> long

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
the game I thought as the game went long

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:31.790 
the game I thought as the game went long
and<00:02:30.660> he<00:02:30.870> looked<00:02:31.050> more<00:02:31.170> of<00:02:31.230> a<00:02:31.320> threat<00:02:31.440> i<00:02:31.590> thought

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
and he looked more of a threat i thought

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.440 
and he looked more of a threat i thought
he<00:02:31.860> did<00:02:31.980> quite<00:02:32.010> well<00:02:32.160> especially<00:02:33.000> the<00:02:33.060> last<00:02:33.180> 20

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
he did quite well especially the last 20

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.000 
he did quite well especially the last 20
minutes<00:02:33.570> it<00:02:34.140> doesn't<00:02:34.440> seem<00:02:34.560> to<00:02:34.590> matter<00:02:34.739> now

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
minutes it doesn't seem to matter now

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.410 
minutes it doesn't seem to matter now
but<00:02:35.130> I<00:02:35.220> had<00:02:35.310> a<00:02:35.340> good<00:02:35.700> shout<00:02:35.940> I<00:02:35.970> think<00:02:36.269> for<00:02:36.390> a

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
but I had a good shout I think for a

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.390 
but I had a good shout I think for a
penalty<00:02:36.600> in<00:02:36.780> the<00:02:36.930> first<00:02:37.140> half<00:02:37.380> and<00:02:37.709> did<00:02:38.280> you

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
penalty in the first half and did you

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.190 
penalty in the first half and did you
feel<00:02:38.610> that<00:02:38.640> Bronco<00:02:39.209> ship<00:02:39.390> may<00:02:39.540> be<00:02:39.570> obscene

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
feel that Bronco ship may be obscene

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.840 
feel that Bronco ship may be obscene
read<00:02:40.380> as<00:02:40.500> well<00:02:40.530> he<00:02:40.830> caught<00:02:41.160> Walcott<00:02:41.519> when<00:02:41.730> it

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
read as well he caught Walcott when it

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.340 
read as well he caught Walcott when it
had<00:02:42.090> already<00:02:42.209> been<00:02:42.360> put<00:02:42.600> down<00:02:42.630> in<00:02:42.840> the<00:02:43.049> second

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
had already been put down in the second

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.710 
had already been put down in the second
period<00:02:43.970> didn't<00:02:44.970> know<00:02:45.030> he'd<00:02:45.150> only<00:02:45.299> been<00:02:45.480> booked

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
period didn't know he'd only been booked

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.979 
period didn't know he'd only been booked
so<00:02:46.110> yeah<00:02:46.260> probably<00:02:46.590> and<00:02:47.570> apparently<00:02:48.570> wooden

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
so yeah probably and apparently wooden

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:50.930 
so yeah probably and apparently wooden
guessing<00:02:49.620> is<00:02:49.709> it<00:02:49.860> it's<00:02:50.130> been<00:02:50.280> caught<00:02:50.489> in<00:02:50.700> first

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
guessing is it it's been caught in first

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.699 
guessing is it it's been caught in first
and<00:02:51.090> first<00:02:51.299> up<00:02:51.510> yeah<00:02:51.750> it<00:02:52.200> was<00:02:52.380> it<00:02:52.560> was<00:02:52.650> a

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
and first up yeah it was it was a

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:53.900 
and first up yeah it was it was a
collision<00:02:52.950> that<00:02:53.190> listen<00:02:53.459> I<00:02:53.519> don't<00:02:53.700> know<00:02:53.790> I've

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
collision that listen I don't know I've
