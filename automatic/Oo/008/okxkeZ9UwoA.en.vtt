00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.270 

that<00:01:09.020> see<00:01:10.020> that's<00:01:10.409> why<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:10.680> human<00:01:11.070> race

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
that see that's why the human race

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.580 
that see that's why the human race

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
honest I think it will have to take a

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.250 
honest I think it will have to take a
Clinton<00:03:35.670> another<00:03:36.270> Clinton<00:03:36.630> to<00:03:36.810> get<00:03:37.020> another

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
Clinton another Clinton to get another

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.020 
Clinton another Clinton to get another
Bush<00:03:37.530> out<00:03:37.770> because<00:03:38.250> it<00:03:38.370> took<00:03:38.520> a<00:03:38.580> Clinton

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030

Bush out because it took a Clinton
before<00:03:39.450> and<00:03:40.230> I<00:03:40.290> think<00:03:40.500> I'll<00:03:40.650> have<00:03:40.800> to<00:03:40.920> take

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.070

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:43.059 
before and I think I'll have to take
another<00:03:41.220> Clinton<00:03:41.700> again<00:03:42.120> too

00:03:43.059 --> 00:03:43.069
