it's really ridiculous how some of
today's<00:04:54.160> games<00:04:54.700> aren't<00:04:55.270> even<00:04:55.570> that<00:04:55.720> good<00:04:55.780> with

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:56.410 
today's games aren't even that good with

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:59.340 
today's games aren't even that good with

the AI on your team and then after

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:01.020 
the AI on your team and then after
you're<00:04:59.590> done<00:04:59.800> and<00:05:00.130> then<00:05:00.190> after<00:05:00.760> you're<00:05:00.880> done

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:01.030 
you're done and then after you're done

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:26.980 
plotter story of Killzone there's a

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:29.490 
plotter story of Killzone there's a
little<00:05:27.250> historical<00:05:27.640> background<00:05:28.200> that<00:05:29.200> is

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:29.500 
little historical background that is

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:31.950 
little historical background that is
actually<00:05:30.220> more<00:05:30.430> interesting<00:05:31.090> but<00:05:31.419> the<00:05:31.660> story

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:31.960 
actually more interesting but the story

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:34.050 
actually more interesting but the story
doesn't<00:05:32.169> really<00:05:32.440> present<00:05:32.710> it<00:05:33.130> really<00:05:33.610> well<00:05:33.790> in

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:34.060 
doesn't really present it really well in

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:36.420 
doesn't really present it really well in
the<00:05:34.210> game<00:05:34.419> and<00:05:34.720> Killzone<00:05:35.380> 3<00:05:35.410> and<00:05:35.860> 2

the game and Killzone 3 and 2

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:39.810 
the game and Killzone 3 and 2
you<00:05:36.610> really<00:05:37.120> oh<00:05:37.330> man<00:05:38.110> those<00:05:38.530> stories<00:05:39.250> are<00:05:39.550> so

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:39.820 
you really oh man those stories are so

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:42.120 
you really oh man those stories are so
good<00:05:40.120> but<00:05:40.390> this<00:05:40.540> one's<00:05:40.870> a<00:05:41.080> little<00:05:41.200> more<00:05:41.740> vague

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:42.130 
good but this one's a little more vague

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:44.969 
good but this one's a little more vague
and<00:05:42.580> not<00:05:43.150> as<00:05:43.360> good<00:05:43.419> as<00:05:43.750> those<00:05:44.050> ones<00:05:44.350> were<00:05:44.530> so

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:44.979 
and not as good as those ones were so

00:05:44.979 --> 00:05:46.800 
and not as good as those ones were so
for<00:05:45.490> the<00:05:45.580> story<00:05:45.880> basically<00:05:46.300> it's<00:05:46.720> your

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:46.810 
for the story basically it's your

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:48.900 
for the story basically it's your
typical<00:05:47.020> oh<00:05:47.530> we<00:05:48.070> ought<00:05:48.220> to<00:05:48.250> try<00:05:48.460> to<00:05:48.520> stop<00:05:48.790> the

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:48.910 
typical oh we ought to try to stop the

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:50.520 
typical oh we ought to try to stop the
bad<00:05:49.090> guys<00:05:49.120> that's<00:05:49.780> pretty<00:05:50.080> much<00:05:50.260> how<00:05:50.470> the

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:50.530 
bad guys that's pretty much how the

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:52.440 
bad guys that's pretty much how the
story<00:05:50.830> is<00:05:51.010> I<00:05:51.250> can't<00:05:51.520> really<00:05:51.700> spoil<00:05:52.120> anything

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:52.450 
story is I can't really spoil anything

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:54.150 
story is I can't really spoil anything
but<00:05:52.600> that's<00:05:52.930> pretty<00:05:53.229> much<00:05:53.320> all<00:05:53.590> it<00:05:53.650> is<00:05:53.860> it's

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:54.160 
but that's pretty much all it is it's

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:56.130 
but that's pretty much all it is it's
just<00:05:54.280> you<00:05:54.820> have<00:05:54.970> to<00:05:55.090> stop<00:05:55.300> the<00:05:55.419> bad<00:05:55.570> guys<00:05:55.600> and

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:56.140 
just you have to stop the bad guys and

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:57.810 
just you have to stop the bad guys and
it<00:05:56.229> doesn't<00:05:56.530> really<00:05:56.650> go<00:05:56.919> anywhere<00:05:56.950> other<00:05:57.700> than

00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:57.820 
it doesn't really go anywhere other than

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:01.250 
it doesn't really go anywhere other than
that<00:05:58.780> too<00:05:59.050> much<00:05:59.200> I<00:05:59.669> enjoyed<00:06:00.669> the<00:06:00.880> characters

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:01.260 
that too much I enjoyed the characters

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:04.140
