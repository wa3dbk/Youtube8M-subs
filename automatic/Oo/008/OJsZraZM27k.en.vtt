00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
 I saw it vii it's horrible you know by its cold 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.069
 so much that he spent the next seven years 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.540
 trying to build a machine the 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.540
 time to stop this event 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:15.139
 and why did not he come the same I do not want 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:16.610
 get bored with the details of the trip in 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:18.410
 the time but the most is part of the 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:21.130
 calculations and he did not want to write his weight 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:21.130
 infront of me 

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:27.430
 I do not occupy in the time machine anymore 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:27.430
 You see, it does not fit anywhere 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:39.820
 this is the end 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:42.760
 yes 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:45.790
 do not talk about that and I just 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:48.879
 realize that I will never walk until 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:51.030
 the white altar you also wanted to be 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:51.030

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.930

00:00:54.220 --> 00:01:00.110
 president of an underwater colony 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:03.230
 self-sustaining goodbye 6 landis 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:05.090

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:08.250

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:10.800
 I care about me 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.900
 listen I'm the only dead chance 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:16.670
 and bridges do not know that that place 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.890
 collapse then I will go with you 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.210
 it's time to send the forces 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.490
 special 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:27.330
 we will use the davenport turbo car and 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:30.119
 when you reach the pedals it is the last 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.729
 option to disable it adam boots those 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:36.050
 cables and step aside soon 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.050

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:51.130
 with wheels remotely monitor 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:54.940
 with the adam they are doing there I read 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:58.210

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.440

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:46.220

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:46.220

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.480
 95 dollars 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:54.400
