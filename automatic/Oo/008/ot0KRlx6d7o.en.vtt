00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.050 
bike but also a fast bike that was
stable<00:01:34.850> to<00:01:35.850> ride<00:01:36.229> especially<00:01:37.229> if<00:01:38.189> thinking<00:01:38.909> in

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
stable to ride especially if thinking in

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.819 
stable to ride especially if thinking in
terms<00:01:39.090> of<00:01:39.420> if<00:01:39.600> you<00:01:39.720> hit<00:01:40.020> a<00:01:40.049> bump<00:01:40.380> of<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.619> road

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
terms of if you hit a bump of the road

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.819 
terms of if you hit a bump of the road
at<00:01:41.159> ultra<00:01:41.970> high<00:01:42.119> speed<00:01:42.350> that<00:01:43.350> they<00:01:43.590> didn't

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
at ultra high speed that they didn't

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.560 
at ultra high speed that they didn't
want<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.040> bike<00:01:44.189> to<00:01:44.220> get<00:01:44.460> upset<00:01:44.909> such<00:01:45.390> that<00:01:45.540> a

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
want the bike to get upset such that a

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.840 
want the bike to get upset such that a
rider<00:01:45.810> could<00:01:46.049> fly<00:01:46.229> off<00:01:46.470> so<00:01:47.250> on<00:01:47.340> and<00:01:47.430> so<00:01:47.549> forth

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
rider could fly off so on and so forth

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.719 
rider could fly off so on and so forth
so<00:01:48.229> you<00:01:49.229> can<00:01:49.500> see<00:01:49.680> that<00:01:49.890> there's<00:01:50.070> wings<00:01:50.369> on<00:01:50.610> the

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
so you can see that there's wings on the

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.450 
so you can see that there's wings on the
bike<00:01:50.939> that<00:01:51.750> really<00:01:52.079> aid<00:01:52.259> in<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.619> aerodynamics

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
bike that really aid in the aerodynamics

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.740 
bike that really aid in the aerodynamics
I<00:01:54.590> understand<00:01:55.590> that<00:01:55.920> at<00:01:56.790> higher<00:01:57.090> speeds<00:01:57.509> the

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
I understand that at higher speeds the

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.530 
I understand that at higher speeds the
bike<00:01:57.930> starts<00:01:58.350> to<00:01:58.560> drop<00:01:58.799> down<00:01:58.979> a<00:01:59.040> little<00:01:59.250> bit

00:01:59.530 --> 00:01:59.540 
bike starts to drop down a little bit

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:03.010 
bike starts to drop down a little bit
it<00:01:59.720> keeps<00:01:59.960> it<00:02:00.110> down<00:02:00.290> keeps<00:02:00.830> it<00:02:00.980> stable<00:02:02.020> the

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
it keeps it down keeps it stable the

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.230 
it keeps it down keeps it stable the
frame<00:02:03.350> of<00:02:03.590> the<00:02:03.680> bike<00:02:03.890> is<00:02:04.220> what<00:02:04.880> they<00:02:05.000> call<00:02:05.210> a

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
frame of the bike is what they call a

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.109 
frame of the bike is what they call a
trellis<00:02:05.840> style<00:02:06.200> frame<00:02:06.640> it<00:02:07.640> was<00:02:07.760> made<00:02:07.970> with
