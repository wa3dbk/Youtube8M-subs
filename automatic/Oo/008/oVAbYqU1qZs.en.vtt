00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
right here we get the first look at the

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.309 
right here we get the first look at the
character<00:02:09.800> concepts<00:02:10.800> so<00:02:11.840> like<00:02:12.840> I<00:02:12.989> said<00:02:13.050> the

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
character concepts so like I said the

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.130 
character concepts so like I said the
closest<00:02:13.680> this<00:02:14.250> resembles<00:02:14.879> is<00:02:15.120> the<00:02:15.720> characters

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
closest this resembles is the characters

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.690 
closest this resembles is the characters
of<00:02:16.260> magical<00:02:16.590> melody<00:02:16.709> kind<00:02:17.040> of<00:02:17.099> the<00:02:17.250> shorter

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
of magical melody kind of the shorter

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.640 
of magical melody kind of the shorter
more<00:02:17.940> cartoony<00:02:18.660> look<00:02:18.690> which<00:02:19.260> for<00:02:19.440> some<00:02:19.590> reason

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
more cartoony look which for some reason

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.750 
more cartoony look which for some reason
I<00:02:20.010> always<00:02:20.040> liked<00:02:20.550> more<00:02:20.879> I<00:02:21.150> don't<00:02:21.870> know<00:02:21.930> it<00:02:22.050> just

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
really interesting now we've never had

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.170 
really interesting now we've never had
any<00:03:31.739> kind<00:03:31.980> of<00:03:32.040> just<00:03:32.190> straight<00:03:32.430> up<00:03:32.519> building

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
any kind of just straight up building

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.990 
any kind of just straight up building
materials<00:03:33.810> that<00:03:34.590> you<00:03:34.739> can<00:03:34.890> just<00:03:35.129> create<00:03:35.730> your

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
materials that you can just create your

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.570 
materials that you can just create your
own<00:03:36.060> things<00:03:36.540> with<00:03:36.810> so<00:03:37.590> here<00:03:37.980> she's<00:03:38.280> kind<00:03:38.519> of

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580 
own things with so here she's kind of

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.520 
own things with so here she's kind of
what<00:03:39.330> got<00:03:39.540> what<00:03:39.750> looks<00:03:39.900> like<00:03:40.019> a<00:03:40.110> bridge

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
what got what looks like a bridge

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.550 
what got what looks like a bridge
building<00:03:41.280> so<00:03:42.030> that<00:03:42.269> is<00:03:42.540> interesting<00:03:43.379> because

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
building so that is interesting because

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:44.869 
building so that is interesting because
obviously<00:03:44.099> you're<00:03:44.400> going<00:03:44.549> to<00:03:44.610> be<00:03:44.670> able<00:03:44.730> to

00:03:44.869 --> 00:03:44.879 
obviously you're going to be able to

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:46.250 
obviously you're going to be able to
build<00:03:45.030> bridges<00:03:45.299> wherever<00:03:45.750> you<00:03:45.840> want<00:03:46.049> which

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
build bridges wherever you want which

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:47.809 
build bridges wherever you want which
would<00:03:46.379> be<00:03:46.470> cool<00:03:46.709> but<00:03:46.890> it<00:03:47.400> makes<00:03:47.549> you<00:03:47.640> wonder

00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:47.819 
would be cool but it makes you wonder

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:50.240 
would be cool but it makes you wonder
what<00:03:48.150> other<00:03:48.659> kind<00:03:49.110> of<00:03:49.170> things<00:03:49.440> are<00:03:49.709> you<00:03:50.069> going

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
what other kind of things are you going

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:51.649 
what other kind of things are you going
to<00:03:50.310> be<00:03:50.430> able<00:03:50.459> to<00:03:50.670> just<00:03:50.760> lay<00:03:51.000> down<00:03:51.030> and<00:03:51.239> build

00:03:51.649 --> 00:03:51.659 
to be able to just lay down and build

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:22.780 
to look but up here in the top left

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.440 
to look but up here in the top left
corner<00:04:22.870> you<00:04:23.680> see<00:04:23.830> the<00:04:23.950> heart<00:04:24.300> metering<00:04:25.300> that

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:25.450

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:27.090 
corner you see the heart metering that
I'm<00:04:25.600> not<00:04:25.810> really<00:04:25.960> sure<00:04:26.050> what<00:04:26.440> that<00:04:26.470> is<00:04:26.800> I'm

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:27.100 
I'm not really sure what that is I'm

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.830 
I'm not really sure what that is I'm
wondering<00:04:27.790> if<00:04:27.850> that's<00:04:28.060> kind<00:04:28.450> of<00:04:28.480> like<00:04:28.630> the

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:28.840 
wondering if that's kind of like the

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.659 
wondering if that's kind of like the
stamina<00:04:29.350> bar<00:04:29.530> but<00:04:30.100> it<00:04:30.190> looks<00:04:30.370> kind<00:04:30.610> of

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:30.669 
stamina bar but it looks kind of

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:32.610 
stamina bar but it looks kind of
simplistic<00:04:31.210> and<00:04:31.660> one<00:04:31.900> thing<00:04:32.110> that<00:04:32.140> worries<00:04:32.590> me

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:32.620 
simplistic and one thing that worries me

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:34.950 
simplistic and one thing that worries me
about<00:04:32.860> this<00:04:33.160> game<00:04:33.520> is<00:04:33.730> that<00:04:34.390> they're<00:04:34.750> going<00:04:34.870> to

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 
about this game is that they're going to

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.580 
about this game is that they're going to
try<00:04:35.140> to<00:04:35.169> make<00:04:35.940> it<00:04:36.940> so<00:04:37.600> creative<00:04:38.110> with<00:04:38.140> the

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:38.590 
try to make it so creative with the

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:41.490 
try to make it so creative with the
Minecraft<00:04:39.160> field<00:04:40.020> that<00:04:41.020> they're<00:04:41.260> going<00:04:41.440> to

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:41.500 
Minecraft field that they're going to

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:43.710 
Minecraft field that they're going to
kind<00:04:41.680> of<00:04:41.770> have<00:04:42.250> to<00:04:42.280> simplify<00:04:42.760> other<00:04:43.150> features

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:43.720 
kind of have to simplify other features

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:45.960 
kind of have to simplify other features
of<00:04:43.750> the<00:04:43.900> game<00:04:44.020> kind<00:04:44.260> of<00:04:44.320> like<00:04:44.500> item<00:04:45.130> upgrades
