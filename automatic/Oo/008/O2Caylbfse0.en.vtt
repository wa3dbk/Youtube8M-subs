it up it is not currently working
because<00:01:54.869> I'm<00:01:55.170> waiting<00:01:55.619> for<00:01:55.649> my<00:01:57.619> um

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:01.870 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:11.200 

my<00:02:04.120> WEP<00:02:07.510> wireless<00:02:08.510> router<00:02:09.050> come<00:02:09.619> in<00:02:09.800> but<00:02:10.610> yeah

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:11.210 
my WEP wireless router come in but yeah

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:13.870 
my WEP wireless router come in but yeah
this<00:02:11.450> is<00:02:11.630> just<00:02:12.080> the<00:02:12.500> basic<00:02:12.920> idea<00:02:13.340> what<00:02:13.580> you<00:02:13.700> do

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
this is just the basic idea what you do

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.130 
this is just the basic idea what you do
is<00:02:14.120> from<00:02:14.450> your<00:02:14.630> DSi<00:02:15.110> you<00:02:15.170> would<00:02:15.970> theoretically

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
is from your DSi you would theoretically

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.440 
is from your DSi you would theoretically
download<00:02:18.610> taller<00:02:19.610> your<00:02:19.790> computer<00:02:20.300> to

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
download taller your computer to

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.770 
download taller your computer to
download<00:02:20.600> certain<00:02:21.320> games<00:02:21.590> from<00:02:22.310> the<00:02:22.780> game's

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
download certain games from the game's

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.810 
download certain games from the game's
engine<00:02:24.080> calm<00:02:24.740> and<00:02:26.200> you<00:02:27.200> hit<00:02:28.040> you<00:02:28.250> have<00:02:28.460> to<00:02:28.640> make

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:28.820 
engine calm and you hit you have to make

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:32.200 
engine calm and you hit you have to make
a<00:02:28.850> profile<00:02:29.420> but<00:02:29.780> see<00:02:30.670> it<00:02:31.670> doesn't<00:02:32.060> work

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:32.210 
a profile but see it doesn't work

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:36.280 
a profile but see it doesn't work
because<00:02:32.480> I<00:02:32.810> don't<00:02:32.990> have<00:02:33.110> a<00:02:33.200> WEP<00:02:34.040> I<00:02:34.280> have<00:02:34.720> WPA<00:02:35.720> so

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
because I don't have a WEP I have WPA so

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.130 
because I don't have a WEP I have WPA so
I<00:02:36.760> realized<00:02:37.760> that<00:02:37.850> its<00:02:38.060> downgrade<00:02:38.630> for<00:02:38.930> many

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
I realized that its downgrade for many

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.580 
I realized that its downgrade for many
of<00:02:39.320> you<00:02:39.470> but<00:02:40.780> if<00:02:41.780> you<00:02:42.020> want<00:02:42.230> to<00:02:42.290> give<00:02:42.470> this

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
of you but if you want to give this

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.320 
of you but if you want to give this
working<00:02:43.070> it's<00:02:43.220> really<00:02:43.900> helpful<00:02:44.900> because<00:02:46.330> what

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330 
working it's really helpful because what

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:52.840 
working it's really helpful because what
you<00:02:47.450> could<00:02:47.630> do<00:02:47.810> is<00:02:48.050> you<00:02:51.220> can<00:02:52.220> do<00:02:52.370> is<00:02:52.550> you<00:02:52.820> can
