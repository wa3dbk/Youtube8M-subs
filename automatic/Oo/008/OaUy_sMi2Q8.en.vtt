00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:42.770 
well this system is going to reduce the

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:45.129 
well this system is going to reduce the
bacteria<00:04:43.280> will<00:04:44.180> really<00:04:44.630> get<00:04:44.720> rid<00:04:44.840> of<00:04:44.900> all<00:04:45.050> the

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:45.139 
bacteria will really get rid of all the

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:47.250 
bacteria will really get rid of all the
bacteria<00:04:45.320> and<00:04:45.650> then<00:04:45.800> reduce<00:04:46.550> the<00:04:46.580> oil<00:04:46.850> as<00:04:47.000> well

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:47.260 
bacteria and then reduce the oil as well

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.330 
bacteria and then reduce the oil as well
and<00:04:48.260> by<00:04:48.350> doing<00:04:48.500> those<00:04:48.650> things<00:04:48.860> your<00:04:49.039> acne

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:49.340 
and by doing those things your acne

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:51.370 
and by doing those things your acne
literally<00:04:49.789> cannot<00:04:50.000> be<00:04:50.210> formed<00:04:50.600> because<00:04:51.199> when

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:51.380 
literally cannot be formed because when

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:54.550 
literally cannot be formed because when
oil<00:04:51.560> and<00:04:52.010> bacteria<00:04:52.490> meet<00:04:52.760> it<00:04:53.479> forms<00:04:53.870> acne<00:04:54.380> so

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:54.560 
oil and bacteria meet it forms acne so

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.050 
oil and bacteria meet it forms acne so
when<00:04:54.680> these<00:04:54.800> two<00:04:54.979> me<00:04:55.100> two<00:04:55.160> forms<00:04:55.490> of<00:04:55.520> acne<00:04:55.849> and
