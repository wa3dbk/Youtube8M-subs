we now we link them all up just like
that<00:03:13.830> and<00:03:14.830> we<00:03:15.340> actually<00:03:15.520> hook<00:03:16.240> it<00:03:16.390> up<00:03:16.510> to<00:03:16.540> the

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
that and we actually hook it up to the

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.140 
that and we actually hook it up to the
green<00:03:17.110> circuit<00:03:17.590> and<00:03:17.830> this<00:03:18.730> is<00:03:18.880> what<00:03:19.030> it<00:03:19.120> should

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
green circuit and this is what it should

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.830 
green circuit and this is what it should
look<00:03:19.300> like<00:03:20.940> it's<00:03:21.940> going<00:03:22.060> to<00:03:22.150> power<00:03:22.330> these<00:03:22.510> six

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
look like it's going to power these six

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.540 
look like it's going to power these six
Pistons<00:03:23.290> to<00:03:23.620> push<00:03:23.830> the<00:03:24.010> floor<00:03:24.220> up

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:27.550

and<00:06:07.990> repeater<00:06:08.979> on<00:06:09.190> four<00:06:10.500> we<00:06:11.500> copy<00:06:11.680> the<00:06:12.070> same

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:12.430 
and repeater on four we copy the same

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:15.839 
and repeater on four we copy the same
design<00:06:12.880> of<00:06:13.650> sticky<00:06:14.650> pistons<00:06:15.039> on<00:06:15.190> the<00:06:15.310> side<00:06:15.580> too

00:06:15.839 --> 00:06:15.849 
design of sticky pistons on the side too

00:06:15.849 --> 00:06:18.839 
design of sticky pistons on the side too
with<00:06:16.539> our<00:06:16.750> floor<00:06:17.110> and<00:06:17.289> ceiling<00:06:17.740> or<00:06:18.070> floor<00:06:18.370> and

00:06:18.839 --> 00:06:18.849 
with our floor and ceiling or floor and

00:06:18.849 --> 00:06:21.810 
with our floor and ceiling or floor and
wall<00:06:19.060> blocks<00:06:20.159> this<00:06:21.159> is<00:06:21.370> what<00:06:21.520> it<00:06:21.610> should<00:06:21.639> look

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:21.820 
wall blocks this is what it should look

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:25.119 
wall blocks this is what it should look
like

00:06:25.119 --> 00:06:25.129 

00:06:25.129 --> 00:06:27.309 

you're<00:06:25.939> going<00:06:26.089> to<00:06:26.149> notice<00:06:26.330> that<00:06:26.659> the<00:06:27.110> end

00:06:27.309 --> 00:06:27.319 
you're going to notice that the end

00:06:27.319 --> 00:06:30.969 
you're going to notice that the end
pistons<00:06:27.889> don't<00:06:28.219> push<00:06:28.520> and<00:06:28.849> this<00:06:29.539> is<00:06:29.809> a<00:06:29.979> because

00:06:30.969 --> 00:06:30.979 
pistons don't push and this is a because

00:06:30.979 --> 00:06:33.909 
pistons don't push and this is a because
you<00:06:31.369> need<00:06:31.550> redstone<00:06:32.419> torches<00:06:32.749> underneath<00:06:33.259> and

00:06:33.909 --> 00:06:33.919 
you need redstone torches underneath and

00:06:33.919 --> 00:06:36.309 
you need redstone torches underneath and
then<00:06:33.949> this<00:06:34.489> will<00:06:34.610> happen<00:06:34.899> so<00:06:35.899> this<00:06:36.080> is<00:06:36.169> what

00:06:36.309 --> 00:06:36.319 
then this will happen so this is what

00:06:36.319 --> 00:06:42.279 
then this will happen so this is what
should<00:06:36.469> happen<00:06:39.999> now<00:06:40.999> you<00:06:41.059> cannot<00:06:41.629> fill<00:06:42.139> in

00:06:42.279 --> 00:06:42.289 
should happen now you cannot fill in

00:06:42.289 --> 00:06:55.919 
should happen now you cannot fill in
your<00:06:43.059> your<00:06:44.059> sides<00:06:44.419> and<00:06:49.809> you're<00:06:50.809> ready<00:06:50.899> to<00:06:51.080> go

00:06:55.919 --> 00:06:55.929 

00:06:55.929 --> 00:06:58.540 

at<00:06:56.929> the<00:06:57.019> beginning<00:06:57.379> of<00:06:57.439> the<00:06:57.559> video<00:06:57.860> I<00:06:58.099> said<00:06:58.429> you

00:06:58.540 --> 00:06:58.550 
at the beginning of the video I said you

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:01.389 
at the beginning of the video I said you
needed<00:06:58.759> a<00:06:59.029> hard<00:06:59.419> set<00:06:59.749> input<00:06:59.990> all<00:07:00.649> this<00:07:01.129> means

00:07:01.389 --> 00:07:01.399 
needed a hard set input all this means

00:07:01.399 --> 00:07:02.919 
needed a hard set input all this means
is<00:07:01.550> that<00:07:01.729> you<00:07:02.119> need<00:07:02.300> to<00:07:02.479> power<00:07:02.659> it<00:07:02.779> with<00:07:02.899> a

00:07:02.919 --> 00:07:02.929 
is that you need to power it with a

00:07:02.929 --> 00:07:06.429 
is that you need to power it with a
repeater<00:07:03.499> or<00:07:03.800> lever<00:07:04.629> if<00:07:05.629> you're<00:07:05.869> powering<00:07:06.199> it

00:07:06.429 --> 00:07:06.439 
repeater or lever if you're powering it

00:07:06.439 --> 00:07:12.570 
repeater or lever if you're powering it
under<00:07:06.769> the<00:07:06.860> floor<00:07:08.649> so<00:07:09.649> it<00:07:10.839> works<00:07:11.839> like<00:07:12.050> this

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:12.580 
under the floor so it works like this

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:16.779 
under the floor so it works like this
the<00:07:13.580> only<00:07:13.849> reason<00:07:14.089> is<00:07:15.249> you<00:07:16.249> need<00:07:16.399> to<00:07:16.519> power

00:07:16.779 --> 00:07:16.789 
the only reason is you need to power

00:07:16.789 --> 00:07:19.480 
the only reason is you need to power
both<00:07:17.029> this<00:07:17.509> repeater<00:07:18.050> and<00:07:18.139> this<00:07:18.559> redstone<00:07:19.069> and

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:19.490 
both this repeater and this redstone and

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:23.619 
both this repeater and this redstone and
that<00:07:20.119> just<00:07:20.389> doesn't<00:07:20.449> work<00:07:20.749> with<00:07:21.740> just<00:07:22.629> with

00:07:23.619 --> 00:07:23.629 
that just doesn't work with just with

00:07:23.629 --> 00:07:36.260 
that just doesn't work with just with
just<00:07:23.989> the<00:07:24.769> wire<00:07:25.509> you<00:07:26.509> get<00:07:26.689> problems<00:07:27.409> like<00:07:27.589> this

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:36.270 

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:38.330
