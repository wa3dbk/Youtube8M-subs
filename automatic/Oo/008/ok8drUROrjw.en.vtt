the<00:01:12.869> line<00:01:13.560> of<00:01:13.680> scrimmage<00:01:13.770> I<00:01:14.100> thought<00:01:14.250> we<00:01:14.369> did

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.250 
we would have probably felt like we were

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:19.950 
we would have probably felt like we were
one<00:01:18.430> to<00:01:18.520> be<00:01:18.670> if<00:01:18.790> I<00:01:18.910> were<00:01:18.970> totally<00:01:19.390> average<00:01:19.660> more
