down or anything like that I can't take

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.749 
down or anything like that I can't take
it<00:06:09.060> what's<00:06:09.150> going<00:06:09.419> to<00:06:09.509> happen<00:06:09.900> in<00:06:10.469> 50<00:06:11.099> years<00:06:11.370> or

00:06:11.749 --> 00:06:11.759 
it what's going to happen in 50 years or

it what's going to happen in 50 years or
25<00:06:12.240> years<00:06:12.630> or<00:06:12.840> so<00:06:13.020> but<00:06:13.680> I<00:06:13.710> would<00:06:13.979> say<00:06:14.219> certainly

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:14.520 
25 years or so but I would say certainly

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:17.110 
25 years or so but I would say certainly
for<00:06:15.000> the<00:06:15.090> next<00:06:15.360> 25<00:06:15.840> years<00:06:15.900> as<00:06:16.560> far<00:06:16.770> as<00:06:16.889> I<00:06:17.039> know

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:17.120 
for the next 25 years as far as I know

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:20.689 
for the next 25 years as far as I know
this<00:06:18.120> place<00:06:18.419> will<00:06:18.659> continue<00:06:19.169> to<00:06:19.409> operate<00:06:19.860> and

00:06:20.689 --> 00:06:20.699 
this place will continue to operate and

00:06:20.699 --> 00:06:24.010 
this place will continue to operate and
at<00:06:21.389> a<00:06:21.419> point<00:06:21.690> in<00:06:21.840> time<00:06:22.139> it<00:06:22.380> will<00:06:22.409> probably<00:06:22.740> be

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:24.020 
at a point in time it will probably be

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:27.860 
at a point in time it will probably be
there<00:06:25.020> probably<00:06:25.289> would<00:06:25.710> will<00:06:26.099> be<00:06:26.279> more<00:06:26.870> public

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:27.870 
there probably would will be more public

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:31.570 
there probably would will be more public
input<00:06:28.080> or<00:06:28.620> public<00:06:29.099> membership

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:31.580 
input or public membership

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:36.279 
input or public membership
and<00:06:32.509> the<00:06:32.659> other<00:06:32.810> thing<00:06:32.900> is<00:06:33.610> in<00:06:34.610> my<00:06:34.819> family<00:06:35.289> most

00:06:36.279 --> 00:06:36.289
