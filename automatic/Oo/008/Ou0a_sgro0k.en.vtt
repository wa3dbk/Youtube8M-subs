because<00:02:02.969> of<00:02:03.210> the<00:02:03.240> stealth<00:02:03.540> that's<00:02:03.750> one<00:02:03.930> of<00:02:04.020> the

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
because of the stealth that's one of the

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:05.830 
because of the stealth that's one of the
main<00:02:04.259> reasons<00:02:04.619> i'm<00:02:04.740> not<00:02:04.890> that<00:02:05.040> hyped<00:02:05.369> about<00:02:05.490> it

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
main reasons i'm not that hyped about it

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.999 
main reasons i'm not that hyped about it
also<00:02:06.840> that<00:02:06.960> it<00:02:07.079> falls<00:02:07.200> right

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
also that it falls right

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.199 
also that it falls right
um<00:02:09.019> so<00:02:10.019> yeah<00:02:10.170> they<00:02:10.349> have<00:02:10.530> the<00:02:10.769> least<00:02:11.009> a<00:02:11.519> little

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
um so yeah they have the least a little

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.520 
um so yeah they have the least a little
trailer<00:02:12.720> I<00:02:12.840> don't<00:02:13.079> know<00:02:13.170> if<00:02:13.230> they<00:02:13.379> release

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
trailer I don't know if they release

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.080 
trailer I don't know if they release
another<00:02:13.890> one<00:02:14.069> like<00:02:14.220> I<00:02:14.340> said<00:02:14.549> I<00:02:14.579> haven't<00:02:14.970> been

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
another one like I said I haven't been

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.369 
another one like I said I haven't been
following<00:02:15.450> this<00:02:15.629> as<00:02:15.780> much<00:02:15.959> as<00:02:16.110> I<00:02:16.170> should<00:02:16.200> have

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:16.379 
following this as much as I should have

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:18.170 
following this as much as I should have
so<00:02:16.680> shouldn't<00:02:16.980> be<00:02:17.040> making<00:02:17.189> a<00:02:17.430> video<00:02:17.579> yet<00:02:17.909> but<00:02:18.150> I

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
so shouldn't be making a video yet but I

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.600 
so shouldn't be making a video yet but I
just<00:02:18.480> felt<00:02:18.659> like<00:02:18.780> getting<00:02:18.959> a<00:02:19.260> video<00:02:19.500> up<00:02:19.709> I

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
just felt like getting a video up I

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.910 
just felt like getting a video up I
might<00:02:21.450> make<00:02:21.569> another<00:02:21.629> one<00:02:21.989> sooner<00:02:22.409> on<00:02:22.590> down

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
might make another one sooner on down

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.789 
might make another one sooner on down
the<00:02:23.129> line<00:02:23.310> when<00:02:24.030> it's<00:02:24.379> closer<00:02:25.379> to<00:02:25.530> being

00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:25.799 
the line when it's closer to being

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:27.460 
the line when it's closer to being
released<00:02:26.129> and<00:02:26.310> I<00:02:26.400> know<00:02:26.459> more<00:02:26.760> about<00:02:26.849> the<00:02:27.090> game

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
released and I know more about the game

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.720 
released and I know more about the game
so<00:02:29.480> it's<00:02:30.530> apparently<00:02:31.530> no<00:02:31.769> longer<00:02:32.549> about

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
so it's apparently no longer about

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.670 
so it's apparently no longer about
Stealth<00:02:33.180> which<00:02:33.540> is<00:02:33.690> retarded<00:02:34.079> because<00:02:34.319> that's

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
Stealth which is retarded because that's

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.470 
Stealth which is retarded because that's
what<00:02:34.829> makes<00:02:35.040> metal<00:02:35.220> gear<00:02:35.519> what<00:02:35.819> metal<00:02:36.120> gear<00:02:36.329> is

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
what makes metal gear what metal gear is

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.259 
what makes metal gear what metal gear is
and<00:02:37.109> it's<00:02:37.439> about<00:02:37.620> Ryan<00:02:37.859> I<00:02:38.189> know<00:02:38.879> not<00:02:39.090> about

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269 
and it's about Ryan I know not about

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:41.539 
and it's about Ryan I know not about
snake<00:02:39.540> anymore<00:02:39.930> one<00:02:40.920> thing<00:02:41.159> that<00:02:41.310> does

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:41.549 
snake anymore one thing that does

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:43.640 
snake anymore one thing that does
confuse<00:02:42.450> me<00:02:42.569> a<00:02:42.599> little<00:02:42.750> bit<00:02:42.900> is<00:02:43.049> the<00:02:43.200> timing<00:02:43.590> of

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
confuse me a little bit is the timing of

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.430 
confuse me a little bit is the timing of
this<00:02:43.769> game<00:02:43.980> now<00:02:44.250> i'm<00:02:44.430> pretty<00:02:44.849> sure<00:02:45.209> that<00:02:45.569> this

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
this game now i'm pretty sure that this

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.190 
this game now i'm pretty sure that this
game<00:02:46.760> supposedly<00:02:47.760> takes<00:02:48.180> place<00:02:48.480> after<00:02:48.750> Metal

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
game supposedly takes place after Metal

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.839 
game supposedly takes place after Metal
Gear<00:02:49.230> Solid<00:02:49.470> 4<00:02:49.739> i'm<00:02:49.889> pretty<00:02:50.250> sure<00:02:50.370> don't<00:02:50.639> quote

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:50.849 
Gear Solid 4 i'm pretty sure don't quote

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:54.520 
Gear Solid 4 i'm pretty sure don't quote
me<00:02:51.030> on<00:02:51.060> this<00:02:51.150> but<00:02:51.470> i<00:02:52.470> think<00:02:52.829> it<00:02:52.950> takes<00:02:53.879> place

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
me on this but i think it takes place

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:59.949 
me on this but i think it takes place
sometime<00:02:55.530> after<00:02:55.980> two<00:02:56.269> but<00:02:57.269> before<00:02:58.010> 4444

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
sometime after two but before 4444

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:03.589 
sometime after two but before 4444
because<00:03:01.670> if<00:03:02.670> you've<00:03:02.849> seen<00:03:03.030> the<00:03:03.150> screenshot

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:03.599 
because if you've seen the screenshot

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:05.599 
because if you've seen the screenshot
from<00:03:04.170> like<00:03:04.409> IGN<00:03:04.829> they<00:03:05.010> have<00:03:05.190> a<00:03:05.220> picture<00:03:05.579> of

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
but he looked like pretty much after

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:04.339 
but he looked like pretty much after
three<00:04:01.349> but<00:04:01.560> a<00:04:01.590> little<00:04:01.829> bit<00:04:01.949> older<00:04:03.049> so<00:04:04.049> now<00:04:04.169> they

00:04:04.339 --> 00:04:04.349 
three but a little bit older so now they

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:08.990 
three but a little bit older so now they
be<00:04:04.409> unmuted<00:04:06.590> so<00:04:07.590> yeah<00:04:07.799> big<00:04:08.129> boss<00:04:08.340> looks<00:04:08.790> like

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
be unmuted so yeah big boss looks like

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.780 
be unmuted so yeah big boss looks like
he'll<00:04:09.359> aged<00:04:09.690> slightly<00:04:10.680> at<00:04:10.979> like<00:04:11.310> this<00:04:11.549> looks

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
he'll aged slightly at like this looks

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:15.199 
he'll aged slightly at like this looks
like<00:04:11.879> it's<00:04:12.120> only<00:04:12.569> a<00:04:13.049> little<00:04:13.560> bit<00:04:13.799> after<00:04:14.209> three

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209 
like it's only a little bit after three

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:16.590 
like it's only a little bit after three
but<00:04:15.599> then

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:16.600 
but then

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.949 
but then
couldn't<00:04:16.870> really<00:04:17.050> be<00:04:17.320> right<00:04:17.560> after<00:04:17.970> two<00:04:18.970> so

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 
couldn't really be right after two so

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:21.510 
couldn't really be right after two so
this<00:04:20.110> this<00:04:20.410> timing<00:04:20.830> is<00:04:20.890> really<00:04:20.980> confusing<00:04:21.220> me

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:21.520 
this this timing is really confusing me

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:23.220 
this this timing is really confusing me
in<00:04:21.580> his<00:04:21.700> pictures<00:04:22.090> the<00:04:22.300> reason<00:04:22.570> why<00:04:22.720> because

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:23.230 
in his pictures the reason why because

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:29.280 
in his pictures the reason why because
it<00:04:23.410> shows<00:04:25.110> old<00:04:26.110> snake<00:04:26.560> or<00:04:27.690> not<00:04:28.690> old<00:04:28.840> snake<00:04:29.140> my

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:29.290 
it shows old snake or not old snake my

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:32.520 
it shows old snake or not old snake my
bad<00:04:29.580> big<00:04:30.580> boss<00:04:30.820> and<00:04:31.300> you<00:04:31.570> know<00:04:31.660> he's<00:04:32.080> kind<00:04:32.110> of

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:32.530 
bad big boss and you know he's kind of

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:37.040 
bad big boss and you know he's kind of
young<00:04:33.540> unless<00:04:34.540> they<00:04:35.200> found<00:04:35.590> like<00:04:36.070> an

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.050 
young unless they found like an

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:39.450 
young unless they found like an
anti-aging<00:04:38.050> thing<00:04:38.290> or<00:04:38.440> like<00:04:38.620> the<00:04:38.740> reverse<00:04:38.890> of

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:39.460 
anti-aging thing or like the reverse of

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:41.160 
anti-aging thing or like the reverse of
what's<00:04:39.640> happening<00:04:40.090> to<00:04:40.300> solid<00:04:40.660> snake<00:04:40.930> or

what's happening to solid snake or
something<00:04:41.320> like<00:04:41.650> that<00:04:41.790> so<00:04:42.790> hopefully<00:04:43.390> they'd

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810 
something like that so hopefully they'd

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:46.200 
something like that so hopefully they'd
be<00:04:43.990> awesome<00:04:44.380> if<00:04:44.500> we<00:04:44.860> see<00:04:45.160> some<00:04:45.370> of<00:04:45.400> big<00:04:46.000> boss

if<00:04:48.370> you<00:04:48.520> see<00:04:48.670> a<00:04:48.700> little<00:04:48.880> bit<00:04:49.030> of<00:04:49.090> style<00:04:49.270> snake

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:49.540

in that game hopefully you can get a

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:54.150 
in that game hopefully you can get a
little<00:04:52.930> bit<00:04:53.170> of<00:04:53.200> play<00:04:53.410> time<00:04:53.620> is<00:04:53.680> when<00:04:53.920> am<00:04:54.100> I

little bit of play time is when am I
highly<00:04:54.550> doubt<00:04:54.730> it<00:04:54.790> because<00:04:55.120> it<00:04:55.420> seems<00:04:55.630> like

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:55.720 
highly doubt it because it seems like

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:57.210 
highly doubt it because it seems like
it's<00:04:55.900> more<00:04:55.960> about<00:04:56.170> riding<00:04:56.530> but<00:04:56.950> you<00:04:57.100> know

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:57.220 
it's more about riding but you know
