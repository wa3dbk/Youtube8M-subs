can get to these and I'll just show you

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:08.520 
can get to these and I'll just show you
guys<00:01:06.970> really<00:01:07.240> quick<00:01:07.509> how<00:01:07.690> to<00:01:07.750> make<00:01:07.960> them<00:01:08.170> it's

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:08.530 
guys really quick how to make them it's

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:10.529 
guys really quick how to make them it's
again<00:01:09.039> it's<00:01:09.220> pretty<00:01:09.399> easy<00:01:09.670> stuff<00:01:10.149> though

00:01:10.529 --> 00:01:10.539 
again it's pretty easy stuff though

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:12.960 
again it's pretty easy stuff though
you<00:01:11.050> print<00:01:11.649> out<00:01:11.740> and<00:01:12.039> cut<00:01:12.460> out<00:01:12.580> along<00:01:12.820> the

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:12.970 
you print out and cut out along the

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:14.999 
you print out and cut out along the
dotted<00:01:13.149> line<00:01:13.479> it's<00:01:13.750> a<00:01:13.869> rectangular<00:01:14.410> origami

00:01:14.999 --> 00:01:15.009 
dotted line it's a rectangular origami

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:16.380 
dotted line it's a rectangular origami
so<00:01:15.310> you<00:01:15.399> start<00:01:15.670> off<00:01:15.729> with<00:01:15.759> a<00:01:15.940> rectangular

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:16.390 
so you start off with a rectangular

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.690 
so you start off with a rectangular
sheet<00:01:16.720> of<00:01:16.869> paper<00:01:17.050> and<00:01:17.590> I<00:01:18.250> tried<00:01:18.490> to<00:01:18.580> keep

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:18.700 
sheet of paper and I tried to keep

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.139 
sheet of paper and I tried to keep
things<00:01:18.880> to<00:01:19.149> the<00:01:19.270> same<00:01:19.479> proportion<00:01:20.020> as<00:01:20.319> like

00:01:21.139 --> 00:01:21.149 
things to the same proportion as like

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:24.809 
things to the same proportion as like
the<00:01:22.149> paper<00:01:22.539> sizes<00:01:22.810> we<00:01:23.080> use<00:01:23.259> here<00:01:23.590> so<00:01:23.700> it's<00:01:24.700> a

00:01:24.809 --> 00:01:24.819 
the paper sizes we use here so it's a

00:01:24.819 --> 00:01:28.230 
the paper sizes we use here so it's a
proportion<00:01:25.569> to<00:01:25.899> a4<00:01:26.560> but<00:01:26.940> obviously<00:01:27.940> smaller

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:28.240 
proportion to a4 but obviously smaller

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.040 
proportion to a4 but obviously smaller
so<00:01:28.660> that<00:01:28.899> it<00:01:29.050> would<00:01:29.170> print<00:01:29.440> hopefully<00:01:30.069> on

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:31.050 
so that it would print hopefully on

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:34.139 
so that it would print hopefully on
everybody's<00:01:32.050> printers<00:01:32.470> but<00:01:32.800> this<00:01:33.729> is<00:01:33.880> kind<00:01:34.090> of

00:01:34.139 --> 00:01:34.149 
everybody's printers but this is kind of

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:36.059 
everybody's printers but this is kind of
the<00:01:34.330> deal<00:01:34.899> that<00:01:35.110> you<00:01:35.259> get<00:01:35.440> here<00:01:35.679> and<00:01:35.800> what<00:01:35.920> you

00:01:36.059 --> 00:01:36.069 
the deal that you get here and what you

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:37.680 
the deal that you get here and what you
want<00:01:36.099> to<00:01:36.310> do<00:01:36.429> is<00:01:36.580> just<00:01:36.789> start<00:01:37.300> with<00:01:37.569> the

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:37.690 
want to do is just start with the

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:39.449 
want to do is just start with the
pattern<00:01:38.020> facing<00:01:38.440> down<00:01:38.649> and<00:01:38.860> with<00:01:39.069> it<00:01:39.250> long

00:01:39.449 --> 00:01:39.459 
pattern facing down and with it long

00:01:39.459 --> 00:01:41.820 
pattern facing down and with it long
ways<00:01:39.490> and<00:01:40.119> go<00:01:41.020> ahead<00:01:41.200> and<00:01:41.289> just<00:01:41.410> start<00:01:41.619> by

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:41.830 
ways and go ahead and just start by

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:43.620 
ways and go ahead and just start by
putting<00:01:42.160> a<00:01:42.310> nice<00:01:42.520> crease<00:01:42.970> here<00:01:43.240> right<00:01:43.420> in<00:01:43.539> the

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 
putting a nice crease here right in the

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.830 
putting a nice crease here right in the
middle<00:01:44.489> you<00:01:45.489> want<00:01:45.640> to<00:01:45.729> try<00:01:45.910> to<00:01:45.970> get<00:01:46.149> as<00:01:46.390> closest

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
middle you want to try to get as closest

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.540 
middle you want to try to get as closest
to<00:01:47.080> the<00:01:47.200> edge<00:01:47.349> as<00:01:47.619> you<00:01:47.770> can<00:01:47.979> here<00:01:48.250> when<00:01:48.369> you<00:01:48.429> do

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:48.550 
to the edge as you can here when you do

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:50.999 
to the edge as you can here when you do
that<00:01:48.700> and<00:01:49.149> then<00:01:49.869> I<00:01:49.989> also<00:01:50.140> want<00:01:50.470> to<00:01:50.560> fold<00:01:50.770> in

00:01:50.999 --> 00:01:51.009 
that and then I also want to fold in

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:53.430 
that and then I also want to fold in
half<00:01:51.190> again<00:01:51.429> here<00:01:52.060> and<00:01:52.270> if<00:01:52.720> you<00:01:52.840> can<00:01:53.020> help<00:01:53.229> it

half again here and if you can help it

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.589 
half again here and if you can help it
you<00:01:53.979> might<00:01:54.190> you<00:01:54.610> want<00:01:54.759> to<00:01:54.849> try<00:01:55.030> to<00:01:55.090> keep<00:01:55.360> as

00:01:55.589 --> 00:01:55.599 
you might you want to try to keep as

00:01:55.599 --> 00:02:00.690 
you might you want to try to keep as
close<00:01:56.050> to<00:01:57.390> allowing<00:01:58.390> for<00:01:58.750> as<00:01:59.470> a<00:02:00.160> little<00:02:00.489> bit<00:02:00.610> of

close to allowing for as a little bit of

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.190 
close to allowing for as a little bit of
white<00:02:00.910> showing<00:02:01.209> up<00:02:01.390> here<00:02:01.599> at<00:02:01.660> the<00:02:01.750> top<00:02:01.929> if<00:02:02.110> he

white showing up here at the top if he
can<00:02:02.349> help<00:02:02.530> it<00:02:02.679> and<00:02:03.459> then<00:02:03.880> you<00:02:04.390> can<00:02:04.569> either<00:02:04.750> just

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:04.989 
can help it and then you can either just

00:02:04.989 --> 00:02:07.320 
can help it and then you can either just
fold<00:02:05.319> straight<00:02:05.830> like<00:02:06.009> this<00:02:06.220> way<00:02:06.489> or<00:02:06.819> you<00:02:07.149> can

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:07.330 
fold straight like this way or you can

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.680 
fold straight like this way or you can
open<00:02:07.720> things<00:02:07.929> up<00:02:08.229> and<00:02:08.610> fold<00:02:09.610> either<00:02:10.060> way<00:02:10.330> I

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
open things up and fold either way I

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.260 
open things up and fold either way I
find<00:02:11.379> sometimes<00:02:11.800> the<00:02:12.010> other<00:02:12.129> way<00:02:12.270> there's

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
find sometimes the other way there's

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:14.850 
find sometimes the other way there's
just<00:02:13.540> too<00:02:13.720> much<00:02:13.810> paper<00:02:14.140> and<00:02:14.410> it's<00:02:14.530> hard<00:02:14.739> to

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
just too much paper and it's hard to

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.710 
just too much paper and it's hard to
make<00:02:15.010> it<00:02:15.160> look<00:02:15.310> good<00:02:15.580> so<00:02:15.910> do<00:02:16.330> it<00:02:16.360> this<00:02:16.540> way

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
make it look good so do it this way

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.979 
make it look good so do it this way
first<00:02:16.959> if<00:02:17.200> you<00:02:17.290> like<00:02:17.410> open<00:02:18.220> it<00:02:18.459> up<00:02:18.640> and<00:02:19.060> you

just want to look here and find where

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.820 
just want to look here and find where
the<00:02:22.120> open<00:02:22.569> flap<00:02:22.840> is<00:02:23.110> here<00:02:23.470> I'm<00:02:23.530> going<00:02:23.620> to<00:02:23.710> make

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
the open flap is here I'm going to make

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:25.860 
the open flap is here I'm going to make
that<00:02:24.010> at<00:02:24.190> the<00:02:24.310> top<00:02:24.520> and<00:02:25.150> I've<00:02:25.240> got<00:02:25.420> my<00:02:25.510> creased

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
that at the top and I've got my creased

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.820 
that at the top and I've got my creased
edge<00:02:26.080> down<00:02:26.410> at<00:02:26.500> the<00:02:26.620> bottom<00:02:26.770> you<00:02:27.520> need

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
edge down at the bottom you need

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:29.590 
edge down at the bottom you need
scissors<00:02:28.250> for<00:02:28.580> this<00:02:28.700> part<00:02:29.090> we're<00:02:29.300> just<00:02:29.450> going

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
scissors for this part we're just going

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.870 
scissors for this part we're just going
to<00:02:29.660> cut<00:02:30.020> right<00:02:30.050> along<00:02:30.560> the<00:02:30.770> this<00:02:31.250> centerline

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
to cut right along the this centerline

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.810 
to cut right along the this centerline
and<00:02:32.180> I'm<00:02:32.600> just<00:02:32.750> going<00:02:33.050> to<00:02:33.110> go<00:02:33.410> to<00:02:33.440> and<00:02:34.190> just<00:02:34.550> a

and I'm just going to go to and just a
tiny<00:02:35.270> little<00:02:35.540> bit<00:02:35.750> beyond<00:02:36.230> this<00:02:37.040> crease<00:02:37.460> so

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
tiny little bit beyond this crease so

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:39.490 
tiny little bit beyond this crease so
that<00:02:38.060> I<00:02:38.090> can<00:02:38.330> create<00:02:38.510> the<00:02:38.960> section<00:02:39.350> that<00:02:39.470> I

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
that I can create the section that I

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.070 
that I can create the section that I
need<00:02:39.800> to<00:02:40.580> separate<00:02:40.940> it<00:02:41.030> everything<00:02:41.660> out<00:02:41.810> so<00:02:42.020> I

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
need to separate it everything out so I

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.000 
need to separate it everything out so I
can<00:02:42.290> make<00:02:42.500> a<00:02:43.270> book<00:02:44.270> here<00:02:44.660> so<00:02:44.840> I<00:02:45.350> get<00:02:45.560> this<00:02:45.710> part

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
can make a book here so I get this part

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.430 
can make a book here so I get this part
kind<00:02:46.250> of<00:02:46.400> done<00:02:46.580> and<00:02:47.540> then<00:02:47.750> I<00:02:47.780> can<00:02:47.930> go<00:02:48.230> ahead<00:02:48.260> and

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
kind of done and then I can go ahead and

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.090 
kind of done and then I can go ahead and
open<00:02:48.920> everything<00:02:49.670> up<00:02:50.380> fold<00:02:51.380> it<00:02:51.560> in<00:02:51.680> half<00:02:51.710> this

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
open everything up fold it in half this

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.190 
open everything up fold it in half this
way<00:02:52.270> make<00:02:53.270> sure<00:02:53.300> you've<00:02:53.570> got<00:02:53.600> the<00:02:53.870> creases

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
way make sure you've got the creases

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.710 
way make sure you've got the creases
going<00:02:54.380> the<00:02:54.470> right<00:02:54.560> way<00:02:54.620> on<00:02:54.920> both<00:02:55.100> sides<00:02:55.720> push

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
going the right way on both sides push

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.960 
going the right way on both sides push
in<00:02:56.930> to<00:02:57.170> the<00:02:57.200> inside<00:02:57.710> and<00:02:57.950> this<00:02:58.070> part<00:02:58.340> will<00:02:58.370> open

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
in to the inside and this part will open

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:01.180 
in to the inside and this part will open
up<00:02:59.060> into<00:02:59.300> a<00:02:59.360> nice<00:02:59.480> little<00:02:59.600> diamond<00:03:00.110> shape<00:03:00.190> push

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
up into a nice little diamond shape push

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.460

that all the way in and then this is the

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:05.650 
that all the way in and then this is the
obviously<00:03:04.160> the<00:03:04.250> cover<00:03:04.610> of<00:03:04.940> our<00:03:05.060> notebook<00:03:05.510> we

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
obviously the cover of our notebook we

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.150 
obviously the cover of our notebook we
can<00:03:05.780> just<00:03:05.930> leave<00:03:06.050> that<00:03:06.260> down<00:03:06.470> and<00:03:06.830> then<00:03:06.920> here

can just leave that down and then here

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:08.590 
can just leave that down and then here
you<00:03:07.280> can<00:03:07.460> just<00:03:07.610> make<00:03:07.790> sure<00:03:07.970> things<00:03:08.240> are<00:03:08.360> lining

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600 
you can just make sure things are lining

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.360 
you can just make sure things are lining
up<00:03:08.810> good<00:03:09.080> make<00:03:09.770> sure<00:03:09.800> that<00:03:10.190> you've<00:03:10.340> got

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
really perfect there's going to be a

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:27.400 
really perfect there's going to be a
little<00:03:26.090> extra<00:03:26.540> on<00:03:26.720> the<00:03:26.840> outside<00:03:27.230> edge

especially on this last part that you
fold<00:03:29.270> over<00:03:29.540> just<00:03:30.110> because<00:03:30.260> of<00:03:30.380> the<00:03:30.470> way<00:03:30.620> that

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:30.830 
fold over just because of the way that

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:32.949 
fold over just because of the way that
the<00:03:31.010> folding<00:03:31.550> works<00:03:31.760> but<00:03:32.090> you<00:03:32.510> should<00:03:32.690> end<00:03:32.870> up

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:32.959 
the folding works but you should end up

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:34.300 
the folding works but you should end up
with<00:03:33.110> a<00:03:33.140> nice<00:03:33.320> little<00:03:33.530> notebook<00:03:33.920> like<00:03:34.040> this

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
with a nice little notebook like this

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.340 
with a nice little notebook like this
and<00:03:34.640> it's<00:03:34.940> got<00:03:35.090> the<00:03:35.239> image<00:03:35.690> on<00:03:35.840> the<00:03:35.930> front<00:03:36.080> and

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:36.350 
and it's got the image on the front and

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:38.770 
and it's got the image on the front and
the<00:03:36.650> back<00:03:36.800> QR<00:03:37.700> codes<00:03:37.970> on<00:03:38.150> the<00:03:38.270> back<00:03:38.420> and<00:03:38.690> then

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 
the back QR codes on the back and then

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:40.780 
the back QR codes on the back and then
like<00:03:38.959> I<00:03:39.050> said<00:03:39.110> just<00:03:39.440> a<00:03:39.590> little<00:03:39.620> all<00:03:40.400> of<00:03:40.459> them

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:42.790

have<00:03:40.940> a<00:03:40.970> pumpkin<00:03:41.390> in<00:03:41.660> them<00:03:41.840> I<00:03:41.989> thought<00:03:42.620> that

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:42.800

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.460
