notice how I wrap this to the inside
here<00:02:22.650> that's<00:02:23.650> the<00:02:23.830> way<00:02:23.950> you<00:02:24.010> want<00:02:24.220> to<00:02:24.250> do<00:02:24.430> on

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
the arrow bar portion is wrap it in

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.540 
the arrow bar portion is wrap it in
because<00:02:28.300> the<00:02:28.420> way<00:02:28.510> your<00:02:28.690> hands<00:02:28.960> grip<00:02:29.320> it<00:02:29.550> it's

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.390 

because<00:03:38.570> if<00:03:38.720> you<00:03:38.780> pull<00:03:39.560> it<00:03:39.590> tight<00:03:39.860> on<00:03:40.130> the

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
because if you pull it tight on the

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.150 
because if you pull it tight on the
final<00:03:40.760> turn<00:03:41.000> it's<00:03:41.840> more<00:03:42.320> likely<00:03:42.500> to<00:03:42.680> pull<00:03:42.890> off

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:43.160 
final turn it's more likely to pull off

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.140 
final turn it's more likely to pull off
there<00:03:43.550> so<00:03:43.730> I<00:03:43.790> got<00:03:43.940> that<00:03:44.210> one<00:03:44.420> done<00:03:45.880> okay<00:03:46.880> now

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150 
there so I got that one done okay now

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:52.140 
there so I got that one done okay now
I'm<00:03:47.450> going<00:03:47.660> to<00:03:47.870> do<00:03:48.340> the<00:03:49.540> base<00:03:50.540> bar<00:03:50.810> here<00:03:51.290> and

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
I'm going to do the base bar here and

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:56.440 
I'm going to do the base bar here and
I'm<00:03:53.150> going<00:03:53.330> to<00:03:53.390> wrap<00:03:53.630> that<00:03:53.930> I<00:03:54.970> wrap<00:03:55.970> this<00:03:56.210> to

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:56.450 
I'm going to wrap that I wrap this to

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:58.210 
I'm going to wrap that I wrap this to
the<00:03:56.540> inside<00:03:56.990> this<00:03:57.440> I'm<00:03:57.590> going<00:03:57.710> to<00:03:57.770> wrap<00:03:57.920> to<00:03:58.100> the

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:58.220 
the inside this I'm going to wrap to the

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:02.470 
the inside this I'm going to wrap to the
outside<00:03:59.530> so<00:04:00.530> again<00:04:00.890> I'm<00:04:01.610> going<00:04:01.760> to<00:04:01.820> start<00:04:02.210> up

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:02.480 
outside so again I'm going to start up

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:06.310 
outside so again I'm going to start up
here<00:04:02.920> and<00:04:03.920> right<00:04:04.280> below<00:04:04.550> the<00:04:04.700> brake<00:04:04.880> lever<00:04:05.320> so

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:06.320 
here and right below the brake lever so

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:16.370 
here and right below the brake lever so
I'm<00:04:06.380> going<00:04:06.500> take<00:04:06.590> a<00:04:06.650> little<00:04:06.890> bit<00:04:07.010> of<00:04:07.070> tape

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.620 

just<00:04:17.040> a<00:04:17.160> little<00:04:17.370> bit<00:04:17.640> over<00:04:18.239> the<00:04:18.330> end<00:04:18.450> of<00:04:18.540> it

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
just a little bit over the end of it

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:22.310 
just a little bit over the end of it
over<00:04:19.230> there<00:04:19.380> the<00:04:20.070> tape<00:04:20.670> there<00:04:20.970> and<00:04:21.209> i'ma<00:04:22.080> start

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
over there the tape there and i'ma start

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.230 
over there the tape there and i'ma start
it<00:04:22.440> just<00:04:22.470> right<00:04:23.010> below<00:04:23.310> the<00:04:23.700> bottom<00:04:23.910> of<00:04:24.180> the

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
it just right below the bottom of the

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.530 
it just right below the bottom of the
brake<00:04:24.450> lever<00:04:25.310> and<00:04:26.310> I'm<00:04:26.580> going<00:04:26.700> to<00:04:26.790> wrap<00:04:27.390> it

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540 
brake lever and I'm going to wrap it

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.540 
brake lever and I'm going to wrap it
around<00:04:27.600> underneath<00:04:28.220> stretching<00:04:29.220> it<00:04:29.310> just<00:04:29.490> a

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:29.550 
around underneath stretching it just a

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:35.360 
around underneath stretching it just a
little<00:04:29.670> bit<00:04:31.190> overlap<00:04:32.190> it<00:04:32.900> and<00:04:34.160> then<00:04:35.160> start

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:35.370 
little bit overlap it and then start

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:39.350 
little bit overlap it and then start
working<00:04:35.700> my<00:04:35.790> way<00:04:35.820> down<00:04:36.380> now<00:04:37.880> it's<00:04:38.880> your<00:04:39.090> choice

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360 
working my way down now it's your choice

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:40.820 
working my way down now it's your choice
of<00:04:39.600> how<00:04:39.780> far<00:04:40.110> that<00:04:40.380> you<00:04:40.440> want<00:04:40.620> to<00:04:40.680> wrap<00:04:40.800> it

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:40.830 
of how far that you want to wrap it

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:41.750 
of how far that you want to wrap it
around<00:04:40.980> I<00:04:41.130> could<00:04:41.310> wrap<00:04:41.430> it<00:04:41.460> all<00:04:41.640> the<00:04:41.670> way

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:41.760 
around I could wrap it all the way

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:43.190 
around I could wrap it all the way
around<00:04:42.120> if<00:04:42.240> I<00:04:42.330> wanted<00:04:42.630> to<00:04:42.690> I<00:04:42.840> could<00:04:43.170> have

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:43.200 
around if I wanted to I could have

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:44.690 
around if I wanted to I could have
wrapped<00:04:43.440> this<00:04:43.650> all<00:04:43.860> the<00:04:43.950> way<00:04:44.040> down<00:04:44.070> farther<00:04:44.580> if

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:44.700 
wrapped this all the way down farther if

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:46.640 
wrapped this all the way down farther if
I<00:04:44.760> wanted<00:04:45.030> to<00:04:45.240> but<00:04:45.930> I'm<00:04:46.050> going<00:04:46.170> to<00:04:46.230> wrap<00:04:46.380> this

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.650 
I wanted to but I'm going to wrap this

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:49.580 
I wanted to but I'm going to wrap this
down<00:04:46.950> to<00:04:47.360> right<00:04:48.360> about<00:04:48.600> there<00:04:48.930> and<00:04:48.960> then<00:04:49.200> stop

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
down to right about there and then stop

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:52.220 
down to right about there and then stop
it<00:04:50.090> maybe<00:04:51.090> even<00:04:51.240> a<00:04:51.390> little<00:04:51.510> bit<00:04:51.660> less<00:04:51.810> me<00:04:52.020> right

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:52.230 
it maybe even a little bit less me right

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:56.780 
it maybe even a little bit less me right
there<00:04:54.260> again<00:04:55.260> I'm<00:04:55.470> just<00:04:55.560> going<00:04:55.740> to<00:04:55.800> overlap<00:04:56.760> it

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:56.790 
there again I'm just going to overlap it

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:12.659 
there again I'm just going to overlap it
by<00:04:57.060> about<00:04:57.270> half<00:04:58.790> wrap<00:04:59.790> it<00:04:59.910> around

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:12.669 

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:14.670 

and<00:05:13.270> on<00:05:13.569> the<00:05:13.689> inside<00:05:13.960> of<00:05:13.990> curves<00:05:14.289> here<00:05:14.530> you

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:14.680 
and on the inside of curves here you

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.559 
and on the inside of curves here you
want<00:05:14.860> to<00:05:14.949> maybe<00:05:15.310> overlap<00:05:15.819> it<00:05:15.999> by<00:05:16.150> a<00:05:16.180> little<00:05:16.479> bit

00:05:16.559 --> 00:05:16.569 
want to maybe overlap it by a little bit

00:05:16.569 --> 00:05:19.679 
want to maybe overlap it by a little bit
more<00:05:16.900> than<00:05:17.139> half<00:05:17.379> so<00:05:18.069> that<00:05:18.210> you<00:05:19.210> leave<00:05:19.360> enough

00:05:19.679 --> 00:05:19.689 
more than half so that you leave enough

00:05:19.689 --> 00:05:22.559 
more than half so that you leave enough
on<00:05:19.900> the<00:05:20.530> outside<00:05:21.009> of<00:05:21.249> the<00:05:21.460> curve<00:05:21.849> there<00:05:22.270> let<00:05:22.479> me

00:05:22.559 --> 00:05:22.569 
on the outside of the curve there let me

00:05:22.569 --> 00:05:24.239 
on the outside of the curve there let me
see<00:05:22.749> go<00:05:23.050> ahead<00:05:23.379> just<00:05:23.710> a<00:05:23.770> little<00:05:23.800> bit<00:05:24.009> more

00:05:24.239 --> 00:05:24.249 
see go ahead just a little bit more

00:05:24.249 --> 00:06:02.140 
see go ahead just a little bit more
there

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:02.150 

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:04.080 

I<00:06:02.180> think<00:06:02.870> would<00:06:02.990> go<00:06:03.080> to<00:06:03.139> right<00:06:03.440> about<00:06:03.650> there

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:04.090 
I think would go to right about there

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:06.700 
I think would go to right about there
now<00:06:05.090> I'm<00:06:05.210> going<00:06:05.330> to<00:06:05.389> do<00:06:05.510> again<00:06:06.320> I'm<00:06:06.560> going<00:06:06.650> to

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:06.710 
now I'm going to do again I'm going to

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:18.159 
now I'm going to do again I'm going to
cut<00:06:06.919> this<00:06:07.070> diagonally<00:06:07.910> across

00:06:18.159 --> 00:06:18.169 

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:27.850 

like<00:06:18.770> that<00:06:19.509> take<00:06:20.509> a<00:06:20.539> little<00:06:20.659> bit<00:06:20.810> of<00:06:20.870> tape<00:06:26.860> and

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:27.860 
like that take a little bit of tape and

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:36.760 
like that take a little bit of tape and
then<00:06:28.009> just<00:06:28.249> wrap<00:06:28.669> this<00:06:28.879> around

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:36.770 

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:41.570 

you<00:06:37.370> want<00:06:37.520> to<00:06:37.580> stretch<00:06:37.849> the<00:06:38.060> tape

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:41.580 

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:53.119 

on<00:06:41.790> these<00:06:42.630> earlier<00:06:42.930> loops

00:06:53.119 --> 00:06:53.129 

00:06:53.129 --> 00:06:57.399 

then<00:06:53.699> on<00:06:53.789> the<00:06:53.879> final<00:06:54.059> loop<00:06:54.330> just<00:06:54.869> cut<00:06:55.139> it<00:06:55.289> and

00:06:57.399 --> 00:06:57.409 
then on the final loop just cut it and

00:06:57.409 --> 00:07:01.429 
then on the final loop just cut it and
wrap<00:06:58.409> it<00:06:58.729> more<00:06:59.729> with<00:07:00.689> just<00:07:00.899> a<00:07:01.020> very<00:07:01.050> little

00:07:01.429 --> 00:07:01.439 
wrap it more with just a very little

00:07:01.439 --> 00:07:05.209 
wrap it more with just a very little
tension<00:07:01.800> on<00:07:02.099> there<00:07:02.309> so<00:07:02.819> it's<00:07:02.909> more<00:07:03.439> just<00:07:04.439> much

00:07:05.209 --> 00:07:05.219 
tension on there so it's more just much

00:07:05.219 --> 00:07:09.090 
tension on there so it's more just much
looser

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:09.100 

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:11.010 

and<00:07:09.490> there<00:07:09.760> you<00:07:09.880> go<00:07:10.060> and<00:07:10.330> then<00:07:10.450> just<00:07:10.480> repeat<00:07:10.750> on

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:11.020 
and there you go and then just repeat on

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:15.600 
and there you go and then just repeat on
the<00:07:11.110> other<00:07:11.140> side<00:07:11.850> do<00:07:12.850> the<00:07:12.880> exact<00:07:13.240> same<00:07:13.300> thing
