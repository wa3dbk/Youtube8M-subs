playing quintuplets or five strokes per
pulse<00:00:28.470> so<00:00:29.130> first<00:00:29.519> let's<00:00:29.880> start<00:00:30.179> by<00:00:30.420> just

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
pulse so first let's start by just

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
is actually a pillow and I just found

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.250 
is actually a pillow and I just found
two<00:01:35.400> chairs<00:01:35.730> and<00:01:36.030> set<00:01:36.540> them<00:01:36.660> up<00:01:36.750> facing<00:01:37.140> each

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:37.260 
two chairs and set them up facing each

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.380 
two chairs and set them up facing each
other<00:01:37.410> one<00:01:37.890> of<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.070> challenges<00:01:38.610> that's<00:01:38.910> that

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
other one of the challenges that's that

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.210 
other one of the challenges that's that
a<00:01:39.420> pillow<00:01:39.960> presents<00:01:40.470> is<00:01:40.590> that<00:01:40.740> it<00:01:40.920> doesn't

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
a pillow presents is that it doesn't

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.219 
a pillow presents is that it doesn't
bounce<00:01:41.430> really<00:01:41.940> have<00:01:42.210> to<00:01:42.360> earn<00:01:42.510> each<00:01:42.870> stroke

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
bounce really have to earn each stroke

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.560 
bounce really have to earn each stroke
because<00:01:43.979> there's<00:01:44.160> no<00:01:44.310> bounce<00:01:44.790> off<00:01:45.060> of<00:01:45.090> like<00:01:45.540> a

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
because there's no bounce off of like a

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.440 
because there's no bounce off of like a
drum<00:01:45.930> or<00:01:46.229> a<00:01:46.290> practice<00:01:46.860> pad<00:01:47.010> for<00:01:47.310> example<00:01:47.729> this

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
drum or a practice pad for example this

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.060 
drum or a practice pad for example this
sequence<00:01:48.930> is<00:01:49.110> actually<00:01:49.500> a<00:01:49.530> to<00:01:49.830> measure

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
sequence is actually a to measure

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.550 
sequence is actually a to measure
sequence<00:01:50.640> in<00:01:50.820> four-four<00:01:51.270> time<00:01:51.540> so<00:01:52.470> we're

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
sequence in four-four time so we're

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.530 
sequence in four-four time so we're
playing<00:01:52.800> quintuplets<00:01:53.460> or<00:01:53.640> five<00:01:53.910> strokes<00:01:54.270> per
