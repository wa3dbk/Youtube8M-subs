00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:14.440 
the core system and we've been training

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.200 
the core system and we've been training
down<00:01:14.680> here<00:01:14.890> last<00:01:15.070> year<00:01:15.280> for<00:01:15.640> one<00:01:16.060> of<00:01:16.150> the

00:01:18.319 --> 00:01:18.329 
stages around this area last year and

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:29.550 
stages around this area last year and
its<00:01:19.329> really<00:01:19.570> tough<00:01:19.810> terrain<00:01:21.990> but<00:01:22.990> it'd<00:01:23.229> be<00:01:23.350> fun

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.160 

I've<00:01:30.460> been<00:01:30.549> plotted<00:01:30.970> this<00:01:31.090> route<00:01:31.390> I<00:01:31.659> know<00:01:31.869> how

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.170 
I've been plotted this route I know how

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.679 
I've been plotted this route I know how
tough<00:01:32.229> it<00:01:32.530> is<00:01:32.649> in<00:01:32.829> part<00:01:33.070> so<00:01:33.430> we're<00:01:34.329> going<00:01:34.479> to<00:01:34.600> be

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:12.790 
it's a heady stayed this one so we put
nice<00:06:09.979> low<00:06:10.310> gears<00:06:10.910> on<00:06:11.780> the<00:06:11.960> bike<00:06:12.110> so<00:06:12.620> you<00:06:12.680> can

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:12.800 
nice low gears on the bike so you can

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:14.650 
nice low gears on the bike so you can
get<00:06:12.860> up<00:06:13.009> all<00:06:13.250> the<00:06:13.460> hills<00:06:13.669> locally<00:06:14.270> rather<00:06:14.479> than

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:14.660 
get up all the hills locally rather than

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:17.439 
get up all the hills locally rather than
having<00:06:14.840> to<00:06:14.930> to<00:06:15.590> walk<00:06:15.770> on<00:06:15.979> them<00:06:16.190> also<00:06:17.180> with<00:06:17.330> the

having to to walk on them also with the
hills<00:06:17.660> you've<00:06:17.870> got<00:06:17.960> to<00:06:18.050> come<00:06:18.199> back<00:06:18.229> down

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:18.650 
hills you've got to come back down

hills you've got to come back down
something<00:06:19.280> I<00:06:19.370> would<00:06:19.490> recommend<00:06:19.789> these<00:06:20.120> fit<00:06:20.449> in

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:20.630 
something I would recommend these fit in

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:23.170 
something I would recommend these fit in
you<00:06:21.199> can<00:06:21.380> see<00:06:21.620> here<00:06:21.919> new<00:06:22.160> brake<00:06:22.669> blocks<00:06:22.850> onto

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:23.180 
you can see here new brake blocks onto

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:25.270 
you can see here new brake blocks onto
the<00:06:23.360> bike<00:06:23.509> so<00:06:23.810> that<00:06:23.960> you<00:06:24.080> have<00:06:24.350> good<00:06:24.530> a<00:06:24.770> good

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:25.280 
the bike so that you have good a good

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:28.810 
the bike so that you have good a good

baking<00:07:38.030> heat<00:07:38.270> it's<00:07:38.840> gonna<00:07:38.990> have<00:07:39.140> to<00:07:39.230> do<00:07:39.380> some

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:39.590 
baking heat it's gonna have to do some

00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:41.080 
baking heat it's gonna have to do some
training<00:07:39.860> anybody<00:07:40.280> wants<00:07:40.520> to<00:07:40.610> do<00:07:40.730> that<00:07:40.910> Ray
