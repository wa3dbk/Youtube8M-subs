00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.470 
example so I have these shorts they're
from<00:00:41.160> forever<00:00:41.399> 21<00:00:41.489> they<00:00:42.090> were<00:00:42.149> really<00:00:42.390> cheap

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
from forever 21 they were really cheap

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.940 
from forever 21 they were really cheap
probably<00:00:43.290> like<00:00:43.440> $12<00:00:44.539> if<00:00:45.539> this<00:00:45.960> were<00:00:46.350> fewer<00:00:46.710> cuz

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
probably like $12 if this were fewer cuz

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.130 
probably like $12 if this were fewer cuz
this<00:00:47.100> top<00:00:47.370> is<00:00:47.550> black<00:00:47.820> and<00:00:48.090> white<00:00:48.300> if<00:00:48.870> these

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
this top is black and white if these

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.350 
this top is black and white if these
were<00:00:49.440> black<00:00:49.710> and<00:00:49.890> white<00:00:49.950> I<00:00:50.309> would<00:00:50.670> definitely

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
were black and white I would definitely

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.950 
were black and white I would definitely
pair<00:00:51.750> this<00:00:52.379> to<00:00:52.559> get<00:00:52.710> this<00:00:52.980> with<00:00:53.460> these<00:00:53.960> with

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
pair this to get this with these with

play<00:01:06.360> around<00:01:06.600> with<00:01:06.750> it<00:01:06.869> before<00:01:06.990> you<00:01:07.200> actually

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460 
play around with it before you actually

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.969 
play around with it before you actually
before<00:01:08.460> you<00:01:08.580> execute<00:01:08.970> it<00:01:09.299> but<00:01:09.780> it<00:01:10.110> looks<00:01:10.590> so

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
before you execute it but it looks so

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.920 
before you execute it but it looks so
cute<00:01:11.310> if<00:01:11.549> you<00:01:11.580> get<00:01:11.820> it<00:01:11.909> right

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
cute if you get it right

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
actually will work together but this

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.800
