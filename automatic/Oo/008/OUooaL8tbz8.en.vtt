00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:08.889 
it on poorly because it will just not

00:04:08.889 --> 00:04:11.099 
it on poorly because it will just not
cover<00:04:09.609> up<00:04:09.970> it<00:04:10.209> will<00:04:10.299> just<00:04:10.449> cover<00:04:10.660> up<00:04:10.780> the

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:15.379 
cover up it will just cover up the
proximity<00:04:11.560> sensor<00:04:11.889> and<00:04:12.280> it<00:04:12.579> will<00:04:12.760> not<00:04:12.940> work

you're going to want to do this

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.320 
you're going to want to do this
beforehand<00:04:38.830> because<00:04:39.190> it's<00:04:40.030> going<00:04:40.180> to<00:04:40.240> be

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.330 
beforehand because it's going to be

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.450 
beforehand because it's going to be
easier<00:04:40.660> now<00:04:41.290> the<00:04:41.350> next<00:04:41.740> step<00:04:41.920> is<00:04:42.070> you're<00:04:42.430> going

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:42.460

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:47.740 
of the 3m don't touch that yet because

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:50.100 
of the 3m don't touch that yet because
it<00:04:47.950> is<00:04:47.980> still<00:04:48.340> something<00:04:48.700> very<00:04:48.970> sticky<00:04:49.270> you're

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.110 
it is still something very sticky you're

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:51.510

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:05.170 
take your time with it and if you are

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:07.680 
take your time with it and if you are
lining<00:05:05.410> up<00:05:05.590> perfectly<00:05:06.100> it<00:05:06.370> will<00:05:06.430> be<00:05:06.580> good<00:05:06.760> this

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:07.690 
lining up perfectly it will be good this

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:09.780 
lining up perfectly it will be good this
is<00:05:07.870> kind<00:05:08.140> of<00:05:08.200> a<00:05:08.320> one-shot<00:05:08.800> thing<00:05:08.830> so<00:05:09.430> if<00:05:09.670> you

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:09.790 
is kind of a one-shot thing so if you

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:12.870 
is kind of a one-shot thing so if you
push<00:05:10.000> it<00:05:10.150> down<00:05:10.180> the<00:05:10.930> he<00:05:11.140> civ<00:05:11.440> may<00:05:11.680> stick<00:05:12.580> onto

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:12.880 
push it down the he civ may stick onto

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:15.810 
push it down the he civ may stick onto
the<00:05:13.030> glass<00:05:13.270> and<00:05:13.600> you're<00:05:13.960> basically<00:05:14.440> done<00:05:14.820> make

place<00:06:04.930> with<00:06:05.349> the<00:06:05.580> 3G<00:06:06.580> s<00:06:06.789> or<00:06:07.330> 3G<00:06:07.780> and<00:06:08.580> next<00:06:09.580> thing

00:06:09.749 --> 00:06:09.759 
place with the 3G s or 3G and next thing

00:06:09.759 --> 00:06:12.839 
place with the 3G s or 3G and next thing
you're<00:06:09.969> going<00:06:10.090> to<00:06:10.150> want<00:06:10.240> to<00:06:10.569> test<00:06:10.930> it<00:06:11.229> so<00:06:11.849> kind

00:06:12.839 --> 00:06:12.849 
you're going to want to test it so kind

of remove it a little bit and see if
everything<00:06:16.599> works<00:06:16.889> next<00:06:17.889> step<00:06:18.039> is<00:06:18.159> to<00:06:18.310> screw

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:18.550 
everything works next step is to screw

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:20.820 
everything works next step is to screw
back<00:06:18.699> to<00:06:18.849> two<00:06:19.060> big<00:06:19.509> screws<00:06:19.900> in<00:06:20.169> the<00:06:20.319> bottom<00:06:20.710> of

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:20.830 
back to two big screws in the bottom of

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:23.909 
back to two big screws in the bottom of
the<00:06:20.919> 3GS<00:06:21.310> and<00:06:21.610> the<00:06:22.509> final<00:06:23.349> last<00:06:23.469> step<00:06:23.740> is<00:06:23.889> to

00:06:23.909 --> 00:06:23.919 
the 3GS and the final last step is to

00:06:23.919 --> 00:06:26.580 
the 3GS and the final last step is to
test<00:06:24.310> out<00:06:24.520> again<00:06:25.060> everything<00:06:25.719> works<00:06:25.960> all<00:06:26.259> the
