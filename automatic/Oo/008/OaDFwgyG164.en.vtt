00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.660
 a dramatic situation was seen in the 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.460
 track of a circus when a lioness 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.500
 pounced on a spectator who had 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.509
 been invited to participate in this 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.890
 show the images recorded in 

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:24.570
 the Peruvian city of cuzco were 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.699
 analyzed by Chilean experts who 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.180
 explain why this serious 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.180
 incident 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:36.940
 wild as your nature is lion 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:39.610
 I drag a teacher down the track 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.740
 a circus in Peru the 33-year-old woman 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:43.989
 I had volunteered for a 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:46.840
 act in which the animal would jump over 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:49.210
 she the teacher was with her 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:51.160
 course when stressed out feline is 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:54.629
 threw on her 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.629
 he throws himself against her 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:03.309
 try to take it off but it is impossible 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:06.490
 fortunately the lioness releases it and 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:08.799
 roxana separates malherida but with life a 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:11.159
 atlas like that suddenly it would have 

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:12.560
 seen ruined 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:16.040
 rhythm 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:19.040
 do not hide where the table is 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.040
 but 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:25.170
 despite the evidence of the images the 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:28.170
 tamer ensures that everything was product of 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:31.490
 an accident would have to jump and it has 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.490
 slipped and falling 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:37.320
 when falling from all the raspa the lady but 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.240
 a different vision is the one that has this 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.820
 zoologist of the wing show 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.220
 that identifies another motivation in the 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:47.490
 behavior of the animal there is an animal 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.990
 over excited which is part of the 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.180
 show 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:54.390
 that at a certain moment visualize 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.820
 what he understands as a possible prey 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.430
 is a woman who exposes her neck that is 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.979
 the most vulnerable part that encourages 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.649
 attack of the animal and that contact with 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.869
 the lions should be cautious about everything 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:09.030
 at the moment feeding them zoos 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:11.190
 they have protocols that avoid contact 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:14.700
 direct with them so as not to stress 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:16.650
 the animals that are kept in this 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.319
 kind of circuses are wild animals and 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:22.590
 therefore they retain retain their 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:24.959
 nature and its capacity for predation 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.040
 it's a matter of remembering the experience of 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:27.780
 jose silva 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.180
 caretaker of the national zoo that was 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:33.000
 attacked by pampa a white tiger the 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.100
 2012 about to lose his arm by 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.709
 enter the cage when the animal is 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:40.739
 I was feeding an exposed fracture 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:43.470
 in four parts on his shoulder did not end 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:46.780
 with his love for cats an accident 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:50.989
 with my family and I have to go back 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:52.580
 be with my family are the animals the 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:54.230
 specialists of the national zoo 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.630
 like most establishments 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:59.660
 they do not have contact with animals 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:02.390
 Savages respect a beast that is 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:04.459
 unpredictable although the animal is very 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.230
 used to be with a person never 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:07.730
 he knows how he will act therefore the 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:09.170
 animal can attack at any minute 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.690
 they are unpredictable 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.790
 It's still wild in the safari park 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:15.830
 in rancagua who know about treatment 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:18.170
 of lions this tour with the 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:20.959
 animals on the car shows 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:22.310
 a controlled closeness are pumps 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:24.350
 time at any time can 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:27.140
 react badly so in and of itself you have to 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:28.910
 have your security always never have 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:31.340
 a direct contact with the lions never 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:33.260
 is that these animals are not cats of 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.090
 pets can not be 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:37.400
 feed or provoke in them a 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:39.410
 stress situation one of the factors 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.569
 that could affect the lion in the attack to 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:43.519
 the teacher the problem I think it's not 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:45.410
 the circus tenure but the bad 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:47.720
 tenure and the little education that can 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:49.310
 have the same circus whether in care 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.930
 veterinarian and in the same training 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:54.010
 that animals have to be able to 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:54.010
 react with people 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.110
 and that is that tiger lion attacks or 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:03.450
 felines in general are more common than 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:05.849
 that is believed thing to see the force with 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:08.040
 that this feather defended itself after escaping 

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:10.650
 of the zoo of santiago more than 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:13.200
 a decade the animal appeared the avenue 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:16.280
 but independence after seven 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.280
 missing hours 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:23.150
 and that stress is key the lioness in the 

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:25.669
 Monaco circus in Peru is hit 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:28.220
 repeatedly with this rod as a 

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:29.660
 sample of domination but ended by 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:32.479
 violate the animal 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:34.460
 this concept of circus tamer is with 

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:36.350
 negative reinforcements before the animal 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:39.050
 he receives a punishment if he does not do what one 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:41.360
 is asking you to do change today 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:42.979
 in day the concept is upside down to the animal 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:45.410
 it is anticipated if the animal does not want to do it 

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:47.780
 does not receive animal prize is from a 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:51.550
 exceptional beauty achieved by large 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:51.550
 and guys that good 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:01.830
 we also do not know that they are domesticated 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:09.009
 wild animals you have to remember it for 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:11.229
 that respect distance before a species 

00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:13.629
 that however quiet it may be 

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:15.550
 be deadly a carnivore that had 

00:05:13.629 --> 00:05:17.080
 compassion with this teacher that 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:20.129
 probably will not forget this 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.129
 experience ever
