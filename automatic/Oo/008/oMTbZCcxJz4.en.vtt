it was against red I casted the game

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.430 
it was against red I casted the game
probably<00:02:10.950> about<00:02:11.129> two<00:02:11.849> or<00:02:11.970> three<00:02:12.150> hours<00:02:12.180> ago<00:02:12.540> so

about earlier June we are now going up
in<00:03:53.310> the<00:03:53.430> five<00:03:53.670> roaches<00:03:53.910> so<00:03:54.180> those<00:03:54.330> roaches<00:03:54.570> are

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
in the five roaches so those roaches are

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:56.540 
in the five roaches so those roaches are
going<00:03:55.440> to<00:03:55.500> act<00:03:55.680> as<00:03:55.890> a<00:03:55.920> very<00:03:56.190> very<00:03:56.400> strong

fight back but you got to also remember
to<00:04:03.660> and<00:04:03.930> one<00:04:04.110> thing<00:04:04.410> and<00:04:04.769> very<00:04:05.640> very<00:04:05.880> early<00:04:06.150> in

to and one thing and very very early in

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:09.020 
to and one thing and very very early in
the<00:04:06.600> game<00:04:06.840> larva<00:04:07.410> production<00:04:08.010> is<00:04:08.190> absolutely

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
the game larva production is absolutely

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:12.050 
the game larva production is absolutely
critical<00:04:09.269> thank<00:04:10.110> you<00:04:10.260> fax<00:04:10.530> machine<00:04:10.860> and<00:04:11.060> you

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
critical thank you fax machine and you

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.180 
critical thank you fax machine and you
are<00:04:12.269> really<00:04:12.600> really<00:04:12.780> limited<00:04:13.260> on<00:04:13.470> your<00:04:13.680> larva

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
are really really limited on your larva

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:17.659 
are really really limited on your larva
so<00:04:14.730> it<00:04:15.090> may<00:04:15.840> be<00:04:15.870> that<00:04:16.049> Junie<00:04:16.919> prime<00:04:17.250> is<00:04:17.430> going

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:17.669 
so it may be that Junie prime is going

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:19.190 
so it may be that Junie prime is going
to<00:04:17.760> have<00:04:17.940> more<00:04:18.180> larva<00:04:18.540> because<00:04:18.900> he<00:04:18.989> already

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:19.200 
to have more larva because he already

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.320 
to have more larva because he already
has<00:04:19.470> another<00:04:19.739> hatchery<00:04:20.250> down<00:04:20.430> he<00:04:20.790> is<00:04:20.970> getting

has another hatchery down he is getting

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:23.060 
has another hatchery down he is getting
a<00:04:21.419> queen<00:04:21.720> over<00:04:21.989> here<00:04:22.200> so<00:04:22.380> he<00:04:22.680> should<00:04:22.860> be<00:04:22.890> able

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
a queen over here so he should be able

so<00:06:47.069> quickly<00:06:47.580> hey<00:06:48.180> Pro<00:06:48.449> had<00:06:48.689> tried<00:06:49.050> a<00:06:49.080> power

00:06:49.459 --> 00:06:49.469 
so quickly hey Pro had tried a power

00:06:49.469 --> 00:06:52.279 
so quickly hey Pro had tried a power
drone<00:06:49.949> and<00:06:50.189> by<00:06:50.669> power<00:06:50.939> droning<00:06:51.479> and<00:06:51.629> he

00:06:52.279 --> 00:06:52.289 
drone and by power droning and he

00:06:52.289 --> 00:06:54.469 
drone and by power droning and he
stopped<00:06:52.650> his<00:06:52.919> Roach<00:06:53.219> production<00:06:53.819> for<00:06:54.030> just<00:06:54.360> a

00:06:54.469 --> 00:06:54.479 
stopped his Roach production for just a

00:06:54.479 --> 00:06:57.350 
stopped his Roach production for just a
moment<00:06:54.689> I<00:06:54.990> believe<00:06:55.650> five<00:06:56.009> roaches<00:06:56.430> would<00:06:57.240> have

00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:57.360 
moment I believe five roaches would have

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:00.559 
moment I believe five roaches would have
