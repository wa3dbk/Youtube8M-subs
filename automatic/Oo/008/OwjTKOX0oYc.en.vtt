00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:18.970 
then kind of just run around here and
then<00:02:17.930> they're<00:02:18.020> gonna<00:02:18.080> try<00:02:18.410> running<00:02:18.740> a<00:02:18.800> but

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
then they're gonna try running a but

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.580 
then they're gonna try running a but
it's<00:02:19.250> too<00:02:19.430> far<00:02:19.640> so<00:02:19.880> they<00:02:20.000> run<00:02:20.210> back<00:02:20.450> and<00:02:20.810> then

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
it's too far so they run back and then

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.900 
it's too far so they run back and then
eventually<00:02:21.950> you<00:02:22.460> just<00:02:22.490> kind<00:02:22.910> of<00:02:22.970> create<00:02:23.240> this

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
eventually you just kind of create this

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.610 
eventually you just kind of create this
well<00:02:25.910> you're<00:02:26.150> basically<00:02:26.750> a<00:02:26.840> turret<00:02:27.260> and<00:02:27.410> they

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
well you're basically a turret and they

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.800 
well you're basically a turret and they
can't<00:02:27.830> kill<00:02:28.010> you<00:02:28.130> now<00:02:28.490> here's<00:02:28.700> a<00:02:28.760> part<00:02:29.690> where

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
can't kill you now here's a part where

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.170 
can't kill you now here's a part where
you<00:02:29.959> struggle<00:02:30.350> with<00:02:30.760> you<00:02:31.760> want<00:02:31.940> to<00:02:32.030> make<00:02:32.150> sure

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
you struggle with you want to make sure

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.840 
you struggle with you want to make sure
that<00:02:32.540> you<00:02:32.720> stack<00:02:33.050> them<00:02:33.260> so<00:02:33.320> we're<00:02:33.800> gonna<00:02:33.890> try

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 
that you stack them so we're gonna try

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:38.199 
that you stack them so we're gonna try
and<00:02:34.970> pull<00:02:35.270> them<00:02:35.390> at<00:02:35.510> 55<00:02:36.080> a<00:02:36.860> setter<00:02:37.850> to<00:02:37.940> hold

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209 
and pull them at 55 a setter to hold

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:43.900 
and pull them at 55 a setter to hold
again<00:02:38.510> and<00:02:38.860> then<00:02:39.860> at<00:02:40.040> 50<00:02:40.430> 60<00:02:41.209> boom<00:02:41.690> stacked<00:02:42.910> and

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
again and then at 50 60 boom stacked and

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.810 
again and then at 50 60 boom stacked and
then<00:02:44.060> so<00:02:44.209> you<00:02:44.270> just<00:02:44.510> kind<00:02:44.720> of<00:02:44.780> sit<00:02:44.959> there<00:02:45.820> shoot

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:46.820 
then so you just kind of sit there shoot

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
right where you broke the first tree

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.520 
right where you broke the first tree
this<00:02:58.790> is<00:02:58.940> good<00:02:59.120> spot<00:02:59.360> to<00:02:59.450> stand<00:02:59.690> they<00:03:00.320> won't

right let's see oh I might have to

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:33.580 
right let's see oh I might have to
DUP<00:03:29.800> okay<00:03:30.800> let's<00:03:30.980> see<00:03:31.099> if<00:03:31.190> we<00:03:31.310> can't<00:03:32.380> stack<00:03:33.380> it

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
DUP okay let's see if we can't stack it

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:38.260 
DUP okay let's see if we can't stack it
again<00:03:34.120> wait<00:03:35.120> for<00:03:35.300> him<00:03:35.420> to<00:03:35.480> go<00:03:35.630> back<00:03:35.709> pull<00:03:37.270> and

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:38.270 
again wait for him to go back pull and

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:40.930 
again wait for him to go back pull and
let's<00:03:38.599> see<00:03:38.780> come<00:03:38.959> on<00:03:39.400> there<00:03:40.400> we<00:03:40.489> go

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:40.940 
let's see come on there we go

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.710 
let's see come on there we go
stacked<00:03:41.720> again<00:03:42.040> so<00:03:43.040> you<00:03:43.730> just<00:03:43.910> keep<00:03:44.180> this<00:03:44.420> up

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720 
stacked again so you just keep this up

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.979 
stacked again so you just keep this up
and<00:03:44.989> you<00:03:45.080> just<00:03:45.110> keep<00:03:45.380> going<00:03:45.440> with<00:03:45.830> it

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:46.989 
and you just keep going with it

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:51.759 
and you just keep going with it
basically<00:03:49.510> it's<00:03:50.510> not<00:03:50.630> really<00:03:50.900> a<00:03:50.930> disadvantage

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:51.769 
basically it's not really a disadvantage

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:54.790 
basically it's not really a disadvantage
like<00:03:52.190> you<00:03:52.700> don't<00:03:52.880> level<00:03:53.810> up<00:03:54.019> as<00:03:54.260> fast<00:03:54.500> as<00:03:54.680> you

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:54.800 
like you don't level up as fast as you

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.190 
like you don't level up as fast as you
should<00:03:54.860> while<00:03:55.280> doing<00:03:55.549> this<00:03:55.810> but<00:03:56.810> generally

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200
