00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:15.010
 Hello, good, let's continue with the process 

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:18.220
 of installation and configuration of fs 

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:19.990
 and now once created the space of 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.980
 names that we did in the video 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:24.130
 previous tutorial 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:26.079
 now play and go adding each one of 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:27.579
 those shared folders of the 

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:30.970
 different servers of our 

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:33.820
 organization well for it simply 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:36.380
 we will click with the secondary button on 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:39.070
 space in the namespace 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:40.660
 and new folder 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.910
 well in this case we will go 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:45.730
 placing the name of the folder and the 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:47.410
 shared resource of each of the 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.900
 servers 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:52.120
 in this case we are going to add and 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:54.250
 then we will put the name 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:57.399
 well for example server 1 well 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:01:00.300
 let's integrate inside fs aplix and 2 

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:02.950
 because in this case we select upl and 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:06.310
 we accept 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:08.230
 We accept and already we give you the 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:11.840
 same name we could put 11 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:14.899
 different we accept 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:19.869
 and it's already added in agreement let's go with 

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:19.869
 the other secondary button new folder 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:26.259
 we add examine by default is 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:30.570
 open from server 1 we selected 

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:30.570
 dock we accept 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:37.710
 we accept and we put it up the same 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:40.650
 name and we accept well we already have 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:43.710
 added these resources from the first 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:47.040
 server we go with the remaining button 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:49.730
 secondary new folder 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:53.360
 we click on add 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:55.970
 in this case we click on examine and 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:59.570
 the resource is on server 2 so 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:02.600
 we either look for the server or in 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:05.030
 this case as we know the name it 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:08.090
 we put server 2 we click on 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:10.460
 show shared folders this is the 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.880
 only one that we have is already selected 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:16.630
 we accept 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:19.030
 we accept and put you up here the 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:22.080
 same name of agreement for no 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:24.510
 complicate us accept 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:28.050
 and we have added the resource of 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:32.480
 server 2 and the third button is missing 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:34.690
 secondary new folder to add 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.760
 examine 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:39.460
 we place we are going to do it in this case 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.560
 here for you to see it we make a 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:44.110
 click on examine here we would look for it 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:47.550
 within the active directory we could 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:50.290
 go advanced search now 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:53.320
 all machines would appear in this 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:56.330
 case we will select the double 3 server 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:58.520
 click accept 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:00.230
 and automatically appear 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.570
 shares that have the 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:05.530
 server 3 in this case we are interested 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:07.790
 integrate that notes into the df 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:12.120
 we accept 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:14.780
 we accept we put the name up 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:18.420
 the same as the shared resource 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:20.760
 we accept and we already have all integrated 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:24.450
 The shared resources of the server 1 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:27.260
 server 2 and server 3 inside in 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:29.569
 this case the namespace resources 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:33.349
 agree 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:36.260
 well there we can go checking doing 

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:37.730
 one click on the different folders that 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.670
 we have created within the space of 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:43.370
 names as each one points to your site 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:46.160
 to the server and share in 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:50.180
 you see server 1 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:54.500
 in this case server 3 server 1 and 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:57.470
 server 2 okay well let's go to 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:59.810
 check from a client machine if 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:04.010
 all these resources appear 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:07.100
 shared in an integrated way well then 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:10.040
 we 're going to go to a client team 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:14.620
 to start a session for example with 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:14.620
 this domain user with user 1 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:28.819
 and let's check 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:31.509
 simply placing 'hacker' bar 

00:04:28.819 --> 00:04:31.509
 local 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:37.129
 and in this case we should have 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:40.720
 bar and the namespace that 

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:40.720
 we have said that it is resources 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:46.889
 resources when you press enter you see it 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:50.759
 appear 

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:52.319
 the different folders with in this case 

00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:54.629
 the content of each of the 

00:04:52.319 --> 00:04:56.879
 servers set our clients 

00:04:54.629 --> 00:05:00.060
 our domain users when 

00:04:56.879 --> 00:05:03.509
 enter and simply type in this route 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:05.639
 as a shared resource they will access the 

00:05:03.509 --> 00:05:09.029
 shared folders of the different 

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:11.219
 servers of 1 of 2 and 3 when doing 

00:05:09.029 --> 00:05:14.099
 double click we will see the resources 

00:05:11.219 --> 00:05:18.060
 shared from a folder that in this 

00:05:14.099 --> 00:05:20.789
 case the clients will not know in any 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:22.919
 moment if it is in 1 in 2 or in the 

00:05:20.789 --> 00:05:25.199
 third server of agreement but of this 

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:27.569
 way we can integrate then all those 

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:30.180
 resources that is what we pursue with 

00:05:27.569 --> 00:05:32.969
 of fs of agreement is to say that the 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:34.379
 correct verification is worth well then in 

00:05:32.969 --> 00:05:36.150
 the next video tutorial we will continue 

00:05:34.379 --> 00:05:39.300
 advancing with some little things 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:41.449
 related to de fs voucher come up 

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:41.449
 then
