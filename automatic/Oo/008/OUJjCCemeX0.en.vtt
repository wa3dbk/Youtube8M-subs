I can use that one okay so let's summon

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:02.000 
I can use that one okay so let's summon
a<00:01:59.430> bit<00:01:59.610> forth<00:01:59.910> to<00:02:00.090> show<00:02:00.270> us<00:02:00.360> how<00:02:00.450> that<00:02:00.480> works<00:02:01.010> it

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:02.010 
a bit forth to show us how that works it

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:03.440 
a bit forth to show us how that works it
has<00:02:02.160> a<00:02:02.190> little<00:02:02.460> bit<00:02:02.580> window<00:02:02.909> here<00:02:03.120> which<00:02:03.300> has

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
has a little bit window here which has

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.560 
has a little bit window here which has
an<00:02:03.600> under<00:02:03.960> lit<00:02:04.110> LED<00:02:04.380> light<00:02:04.920> as<00:02:05.159> well<00:02:05.430> so<00:02:06.060> you

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
an under lit LED light as well so you

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.449 
an under lit LED light as well so you
can<00:02:06.720> rotate<00:02:06.870> your<00:02:07.200> bits<00:02:07.440> and<00:02:07.620> it<00:02:08.039> allows<00:02:08.250> you

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
can rotate your bits and it allows you

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.580 
can rotate your bits and it allows you
to<00:02:08.489> see<00:02:09.090> where<00:02:09.360> the<00:02:09.539> bits<00:02:09.720> are<00:02:09.899> well<00:02:10.409> that

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
to see where the bits are well that

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:11.899 
to see where the bits are well that
looks<00:02:10.769> like<00:02:10.830> a<00:02:10.920> nod<00:02:11.220> to<00:02:11.400> the<00:02:11.519> older<00:02:11.879> generation

00:02:11.899 --> 00:02:11.909 
looks like a nod to the older generation

00:02:11.909 --> 00:02:13.880 
looks like a nod to the older generation
I<00:02:12.540> could<00:02:12.690> I<00:02:12.720> mean<00:02:12.870> that<00:02:12.989> thing<00:02:13.110> is<00:02:13.230> like<00:02:13.440> as<00:02:13.650> fat

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
I could I mean that thing is like as fat

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.580 
I could I mean that thing is like as fat
as<00:02:14.040> my<00:02:14.159> finger<00:02:14.580> when<00:02:14.730> you<00:02:14.760> magnify<00:02:14.970> it<00:02:15.590> that's

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
as my finger when you magnify it that's

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.350 
as my finger when you magnify it that's
cool<00:02:16.830> so<00:02:17.160> you<00:02:17.250> can<00:02:17.370> select<00:02:17.520> whichever<00:02:17.970> bet<00:02:18.240> you

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
cool so you can select whichever bet you

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.500 
cool so you can select whichever bet you
really<00:02:18.510> like

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
really like

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.270 
really like
and<00:02:19.599> you<00:02:20.019> use<00:02:20.170> a<00:02:20.200> sliding<00:02:20.560> switch<00:02:20.800> right<00:02:21.069> here

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
and you use a sliding switch right here

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.070 
and you use a sliding switch right here
yeah<00:02:21.550> and<00:02:21.819> that's<00:02:22.750> it

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
yeah and that's it

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.380 
yeah and that's it
lamb<00:02:23.230> comes<00:02:23.560> out<00:02:23.739> okay<00:02:24.340> since<00:02:24.700> you<00:02:24.819> are<00:02:25.030> well

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
lamb comes out okay since you are well

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.000 
lamb comes out okay since you are well
let's<00:02:25.569> pop<00:02:25.750> that<00:02:25.930> one<00:02:26.049> out<00:02:26.170> again<00:02:26.319> and<00:02:26.560> just

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
let's pop that one out again and just

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:28.229 
let's pop that one out again and just
drive<00:02:27.159> a<00:02:27.190> screw<00:02:27.430> with<00:02:27.670> the<00:02:27.819> slot

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
let's talk about the bits I mean they

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.670 
let's talk about the bits I mean they
come<00:03:21.640> out<00:03:21.819> you<00:03:22.120> know<00:03:22.209> on<00:03:22.390> command<00:03:22.810> right<00:03:23.049> but

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
come out you know on command right but

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.440 
come out you know on command right but
let's<00:03:23.919> say<00:03:24.069> you<00:03:24.130> strip<00:03:24.639> one<00:03:24.849> how<00:03:25.269> do<00:03:25.329> you

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
let's say you strip one how do you

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:29.159 
let's say you strip one how do you
replace<00:03:25.720> it<00:03:26.370> you<00:03:27.370> basically<00:03:27.900> throw<00:03:28.900> it<00:03:29.019> out

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:29.169 
replace it you basically throw it out

00:03:29.169 --> 00:03:30.990 
replace it you basically throw it out
right<00:03:29.769> well<00:03:30.489> that<00:03:30.579> didn't<00:03:30.790> come<00:03:30.880> out<00:03:30.940> that

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
right well that didn't come out that

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.759 
right well that didn't come out that
easily<00:03:31.150> no<00:03:31.810> it<00:03:32.109> does<00:03:32.319> have<00:03:32.500> a<00:03:32.530> rare-earth

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:32.769 
easily no it does have a rare-earth

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:34.379 
easily no it does have a rare-earth
magnet<00:03:33.340> that<00:03:33.459> will<00:03:33.579> allow<00:03:33.760> you<00:03:33.819> to<00:03:33.940> hold<00:03:34.120> a<00:03:34.209> bit

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:34.389 
magnet that will allow you to hold a bit

00:03:34.389 --> 00:03:35.699 
magnet that will allow you to hold a bit
so<00:03:34.569> it<00:03:34.690> just<00:03:34.930> doesn't<00:03:35.139> pop<00:03:35.380> out<00:03:35.560> when<00:03:35.680> you

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:35.709 
so it just doesn't pop out when you

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:38.099 
so it just doesn't pop out when you
reject<00:03:36.160> from<00:03:36.220> the<00:03:36.310> bits<00:03:36.549> mm-hmm<00:03:37.090> it<00:03:37.180> does<00:03:37.419> hold

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:38.109 
reject from the bits mm-hmm it does hold

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:39.990 
reject from the bits mm-hmm it does hold
a<00:03:38.260> bit<00:03:38.380> and<00:03:38.530> they're<00:03:38.650> strong<00:03:38.980> okay<00:03:39.489> and<00:03:39.760> it

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
a bit and they're strong okay and it

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.879 
a bit and they're strong okay and it
comes<00:03:40.180> with<00:03:40.299> the<00:03:40.510> 12<00:03:40.750> as<00:03:40.930> you<00:03:41.019> said<00:03:41.230> pre-loaded

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:41.889 
comes with the 12 as you said pre-loaded

00:03:41.889 --> 00:03:43.559 
comes with the 12 as you said pre-loaded
and<00:03:42.040> let's<00:03:42.220> rattle<00:03:42.370> off<00:03:42.639> the<00:03:42.819> configurations

00:03:43.559 --> 00:03:43.569 
and let's rattle off the configurations

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:46.710 
and let's rattle off the configurations
yes<00:03:43.959> so<00:03:44.290> you<00:03:44.349> have<00:03:44.590> pH<00:03:45.069> zero<00:03:45.519> Philip<00:03:46.090> zero<00:03:46.359> one

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
yes so you have pH zero Philip zero one

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.890 
yes so you have pH zero Philip zero one
two<00:03:47.019> three<00:03:47.620> you<00:03:48.130> have<00:03:48.250> slotted<00:03:48.819> four<00:03:49.299> six

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
two three you have slotted four six

two three you have slotted four six
eight<00:03:50.169> to<00:03:50.650> ten<00:03:50.859> and<00:03:51.069> then<00:03:51.609> you<00:03:51.730> have<00:03:51.910> torques

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690 
eight to ten and then you have torques

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:56.190 
eight to ten and then you have torques
10<00:03:53.169> 15<00:03:53.769> 25<00:03:54.250> and<00:03:54.310> square<00:03:54.730> one<00:03:54.910> and<00:03:55.060> two<00:03:55.180> yeah<00:03:55.690> you

you use this when you were doing that
absolutely<00:04:10.120> actually<00:04:10.299> didn't<00:04:10.660> have<00:04:10.780> enough

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:10.989 
absolutely actually didn't have enough

absolutely actually didn't have enough
room<00:04:11.230> in<00:04:11.410> our<00:04:11.650> apartment<00:04:12.129> to<00:04:12.370> put<00:04:12.700> it<00:04:12.790> together

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:12.910 
room in our apartment to put it together

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:15.869 
room in our apartment to put it together
yeah<00:04:13.450> we<00:04:14.040> started<00:04:15.040> driving<00:04:15.340> in<00:04:15.609> screws

00:04:15.869 --> 00:04:15.879 
yeah we started driving in screws

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:17.310 
yeah we started driving in screws
because<00:04:16.180> we<00:04:16.239> thought<00:04:16.359> Philips<00:04:16.720> is<00:04:16.840> there<00:04:17.049> and

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:17.320 
because we thought Philips is there and

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.199 
because we thought Philips is there and
then<00:04:17.560> as<00:04:17.829> you<00:04:18.190> go<00:04:18.400> through<00:04:18.789> different

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.209 
then as you go through different

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:21.029 
then as you go through different
configurations<00:04:20.019> the<00:04:20.199> fasteners<00:04:20.650> started<00:04:20.949> to

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:21.039 
configurations the fasteners started to

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:24.120 
configurations the fasteners started to
change<00:04:21.280> and<00:04:21.880> we're<00:04:22.750> like<00:04:22.960> Oh<00:04:23.169> God<00:04:23.710> I<00:04:23.889> kept

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 
change and we're like Oh God I kept

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:25.710 
change and we're like Oh God I kept
running<00:04:24.280> back<00:04:24.430> to<00:04:24.699> my<00:04:24.820> toolbox<00:04:25.210> trying<00:04:25.660> to

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720 
running back to my toolbox trying to

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.450 
running back to my toolbox trying to
find<00:04:25.900> the<00:04:26.020> right<00:04:26.199> bed<00:04:26.500> and<00:04:26.770> come<00:04:27.010> back<00:04:27.160> to<00:04:27.340> it

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460 
find the right bed and come back to it

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.100 
find the right bed and come back to it
and<00:04:27.849> I<00:04:27.909> just<00:04:28.090> kept<00:04:28.270> thinking<00:04:28.300> oh<00:04:28.570> god<00:04:28.930> I<00:04:28.960> just

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:31.630 
need to have this right here load it

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:32.730 
need to have this right here load it
with<00:04:31.719> the<00:04:31.810> bits<00:04:31.990> that<00:04:32.080> I<00:04:32.169> need<00:04:32.349> and

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:32.740 
with the bits that I need and

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:34.710 
with the bits that I need and
go<00:04:32.889> ahead<00:04:33.099> right<00:04:33.669> okay<00:04:34.210> well<00:04:34.419> I'll<00:04:34.479> tell<00:04:34.660> you

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:34.720 
go ahead right okay well I'll tell you

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.170 
go ahead right okay well I'll tell you
what<00:04:34.870> let's<00:04:35.470> talk<00:04:35.740> then<00:04:35.979> about<00:04:36.310> charging<00:04:37.000> time

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:37.180 
what let's talk then about charging time

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.029 
what let's talk then about charging time
because<00:04:38.050> you<00:04:38.289> know<00:04:38.349> you<00:04:38.470> said<00:04:38.650> you<00:04:38.770> can<00:04:38.889> put

00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:39.039 
because you know you said you can put

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:40.860 
because you know you said you can put
your<00:04:39.220> USB<00:04:39.819> charger<00:04:40.240> in<00:04:40.360> there<00:04:40.509> but<00:04:40.630> how<00:04:40.720> long

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:40.870 
your USB charger in there but how long

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:42.990 
your USB charger in there but how long
does<00:04:40.930> it<00:04:40.990> take<00:04:41.169> to<00:04:41.289> go<00:04:41.410> zero<00:04:41.710> to<00:04:41.800> full<00:04:42.160> three<00:04:42.910> to

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.000 
does it take to go zero to full three to

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.670 
does it take to go zero to full three to
five<00:04:43.180> hours<00:04:43.539> and<00:04:43.720> it's<00:04:43.840> independent<00:04:44.560> of

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:44.680 
five hours and it's independent of

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.230 
five hours and it's independent of
whether<00:04:44.889> you<00:04:45.130> do<00:04:45.250> the<00:04:45.400> wall<00:04:45.580> charger<00:04:46.000> that<00:04:46.120> we

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:46.240 
whether you do the wall charger that we

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.240 
whether you do the wall charger that we
provide<00:04:46.630> you<00:04:46.660> with<00:04:46.930> or<00:04:47.169> the<00:04:47.410> USB<00:04:47.800> charging<00:04:48.099> off

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.250 
provide you with or the USB charging off

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:50.189 
provide you with or the USB charging off
your<00:04:48.400> cell<00:04:48.550> phone<00:04:48.759> okay<00:04:49.180> and<00:04:49.509> so<00:04:49.900> it<00:04:50.050> comes

00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:50.199 
your cell phone okay and so it comes

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:52.379 
your cell phone okay and so it comes
with<00:04:50.319> the<00:04:50.560> charger<00:04:51.039> but<00:04:51.310> if<00:04:51.580> you<00:04:51.819> just<00:04:52.180> don't

00:04:52.379 --> 00:04:52.389 
with the charger but if you just don't
