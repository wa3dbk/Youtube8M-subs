00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.640 
you don't need to learn the kanji right
away<00:02:11.190> but<00:02:11.310> you<00:02:11.550> should<00:02:11.730> at<00:02:11.760> least<00:02:12.060> all

japanese you learn at least in hiragana
because<00:02:16.409> learning<00:02:16.799> it<00:02:17.040> in<00:02:17.069> romaji<00:02:17.370> is

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
because learning it in romaji is

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.580 
because learning it in romaji is
counterproductive<00:02:17.939> it<00:02:18.569> slows<00:02:18.870> you<00:02:18.989> down<00:02:19.049> it's

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
counterproductive it slows you down it's

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.530 
counterproductive it slows you down it's
an<00:02:19.680> extra<00:02:19.950> step<00:02:19.980> and<00:02:20.430> the<00:02:21.120> first<00:02:21.329> thing<00:02:21.420> you

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
an extra step and the first thing you

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.509 
an extra step and the first thing you
need<00:02:21.629> to<00:02:21.689> learn<00:02:21.810> anyway<00:02:22.319> is<00:02:22.439> here<00:02:22.620> to<00:02:22.709> ghana<00:02:22.860> so

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
need to learn anyway is here to ghana so

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:25.520 
need to learn anyway is here to ghana so
you<00:02:24.209> might<00:02:24.360> as<00:02:24.450> well<00:02:24.540> learn<00:02:24.870> hiragana<00:02:25.110> and

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
you might as well learn hiragana and

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.130 
you might as well learn hiragana and
then<00:02:26.040> when<00:02:26.220> you<00:02:26.310> get<00:02:26.400> the<00:02:26.579> sheet<00:02:26.819> of<00:02:27.060> vocab<00:02:27.870> in

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
then when you get the sheet of vocab in

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.530 
then when you get the sheet of vocab in
hiragana<00:02:28.500> you'll<00:02:28.860> know<00:02:28.980> what<00:02:29.129> it<00:02:29.220> says<00:02:29.540> then

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
hiragana you'll know what it says then

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.099 
hiragana you'll know what it says then
you<00:02:30.629> can<00:02:30.750> go<00:02:30.810> from<00:02:30.900> there<00:02:32.269> final<00:02:33.269> question<00:02:33.390> for

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:34.109 
you can go from there final question for

00:02:34.109 --> 00:02:40.610 
you can go from there final question for
now<00:02:38.209> so<00:02:39.209> even<00:02:39.510> if<00:02:39.629> you<00:02:39.720> memorize<00:02:39.870> katakana

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
now so even if you memorize katakana

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.319 
now so even if you memorize katakana
hiragana<00:02:40.950> and<00:02:41.159> kanji<00:02:41.430> how<00:02:41.760> can<00:02:41.970> you<00:02:42.090> know<00:02:42.269> what

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:42.329 
hiragana and kanji how can you know what

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:48.890 
hiragana and kanji how can you know what
it<00:02:42.480> means<00:02:42.659> in<00:02:42.989> your<00:02:43.439> language<00:02:43.680> um<00:02:47.659> well<00:02:48.659> as<00:02:48.780> I

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
it means in your language um well as I

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.509 
it means in your language um well as I
said<00:02:49.109> you're<00:02:49.349> going<00:02:49.470> to<00:02:49.530> learn<00:02:49.590> your<00:02:49.739> ABCs<00:02:50.159> the

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:50.519 
said you're going to learn your ABCs the

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:53.089 
said you're going to learn your ABCs the
pyridine<00:02:51.030> at<00:02:51.180> ethicon<00:02:51.799> then<00:02:52.799> you're<00:02:52.889> going<00:02:52.980> to

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
go on to learn vocab and then presumably

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:56.809 
go on to learn vocab and then presumably
at<00:02:55.440> that<00:02:55.620> point<00:02:55.889> you<00:02:56.099> will<00:02:56.280> also<00:02:56.400> be<00:02:56.519> learning

grammar or after that you start learning

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:01.610 
grammar or after that you start learning
