i can actually use my iphone with the
gorillapod<00:02:01.079> as<00:02:01.229> well<00:02:01.439> but<00:02:01.920> i'm<00:02:02.040> going<00:02:02.189> to

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
gorillapod as well but i'm going to

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.100 
gorillapod as well but i'm going to
stick<00:02:02.369> with<00:02:02.399> the<00:02:02.579> zi8<00:02:02.790> now<00:02:03.299> and<00:02:03.630> give<00:02:03.930> that<00:02:04.079> a

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
stick with the zi8 now and give that a

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.550 
stick with the zi8 now and give that a
go<00:02:04.320> and<00:02:04.530> see<00:02:04.590> what<00:02:04.950> it<00:02:05.070> looks<00:02:05.250> like<00:02:05.990> ok<00:02:06.990> so<00:02:07.380> this

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
go and see what it looks like ok so this

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.770 
go and see what it looks like ok so this
is<00:02:07.740> the<00:02:07.890> second<00:02:08.250> tank<00:02:08.369> actually<00:02:08.759> the<00:02:09.569> first

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
is the second tank actually the first

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.020 
is the second tank actually the first
white<00:02:10.140> ride<00:02:10.619> I<00:02:11.039> didn't<00:02:11.520> realize

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
white ride I didn't realize

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.970 
white ride I didn't realize
there<00:02:12.090> is<00:02:12.180> a<00:02:12.209> volume<00:02:12.870> control<00:02:12.900> on<00:02:13.410> the

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
there is a volume control on the

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.590 
there is a volume control on the
microphone<00:02:14.370> input<00:02:14.819> so<00:02:15.000> that<00:02:15.030> was<00:02:15.240> turned<00:02:15.390> way

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
microphone input so that was turned way

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.690 
microphone input so that was turned way
down<00:02:15.630> so<00:02:16.470> I've<00:02:16.680> now<00:02:16.890> turned<00:02:17.160> up<00:02:17.250> to<00:02:17.430> maximum

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
down so I've now turned up to maximum

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.490 
down so I've now turned up to maximum
and<00:02:17.970> hopefully<00:02:18.300> you<00:02:18.360> can<00:02:18.630> you<00:02:18.959> can<00:02:19.110> hear<00:02:19.319> this

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
and hopefully you can you can hear this

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.620 
and hopefully you can you can hear this
now<00:02:19.740> it<00:02:19.860> might<00:02:19.950> be<00:02:20.069> in<00:02:20.160> a<00:02:20.220> single<00:02:20.520> channel<00:02:20.850> I

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
now it might be in a single channel I

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.559 
now it might be in a single channel I
think<00:02:22.290> it's<00:02:22.410> a<00:02:22.470> mono<00:02:22.770> input<00:02:23.400> so<00:02:24.180> I<00:02:24.209> might<00:02:24.450> have

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
think it's a mono input so I might have

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:26.210 
think it's a mono input so I might have
to<00:02:24.600> again<00:02:25.170> sort<00:02:25.680> that<00:02:25.800> out<00:02:25.860> in

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
to again sort that out in

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.820 
to again sort that out in
post-production<00:02:26.700> but<00:02:27.690> anyway<00:02:28.050> you<00:02:28.560> can<00:02:28.680> see

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
post-production but anyway you can see

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.280 
post-production but anyway you can see
now<00:02:28.980> the<00:02:29.010> quality<00:02:29.610> of<00:02:29.640> the<00:02:30.000> 1080p<00:02:30.450> signal<00:02:30.959> so

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
now the quality of the 1080p signal so

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.640 
now the quality of the 1080p signal so
let's<00:02:31.530> go<00:02:31.680> back<00:02:31.709> to<00:02:32.100> the<00:02:32.220> standard<00:02:32.700> video<00:02:33.650> ok

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
let's go back to the standard video ok

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.580 
let's go back to the standard video ok
so<00:02:34.709> back<00:02:35.069> on<00:02:35.250> to<00:02:35.520> the<00:02:35.550> sony<00:02:36.000> camcorder<00:02:36.690> bury

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
so back on to the sony camcorder bury

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.050 
so back on to the sony camcorder bury
your<00:02:37.739> mind<00:02:37.950> that<00:02:38.130> the<00:02:38.250> sony<00:02:38.459> camcorders

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
your mind that the sony camcorders

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.250 
your mind that the sony camcorders
probably<00:02:39.450> eight<00:02:39.569> to<00:02:39.600> nine<00:02:39.840> times<00:02:40.140> more

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
probably eight to nine times more

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.190 
probably eight to nine times more
expensive<00:02:40.500> than<00:02:41.160> the<00:02:41.220> the<00:02:41.790> kodak<00:02:42.180> zi8<00:02:42.540> now

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
expensive than the the kodak zi8 now

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.870 
expensive than the the kodak zi8 now
I've<00:02:43.290> just<00:02:43.319> uploaded<00:02:44.130> some<00:02:44.489> of<00:02:44.610> the<00:02:44.670> footage

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
I've just uploaded some of the footage

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.240 
I've just uploaded some of the footage
into<00:02:45.269> Final<00:02:45.930> Cut<00:02:45.989> Pro<00:02:46.050> to<00:02:46.650> have<00:02:46.890> a<00:02:46.920> look<00:02:47.100> at<00:02:47.190> it

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
into Final Cut Pro to have a look at it

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.250 
into Final Cut Pro to have a look at it
before<00:02:47.310> I<00:02:47.640> assemble<00:02:48.209> this<00:02:48.750> particular<00:02:49.019> video

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
before I assemble this particular video

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.320 
before I assemble this particular video
clip<00:02:49.620> and<00:02:49.800> to<00:02:49.950> my<00:02:50.040> eyes<00:02:50.220> it<00:02:50.550> still<00:02:50.970> looks<00:02:51.150> a<00:02:51.209> bit

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
clip and to my eyes it still looks a bit

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:52.880 
clip and to my eyes it still looks a bit
too<00:02:51.570> grainy<00:02:51.930> really<00:02:52.380> to<00:02:52.500> be<00:02:52.590> honest<00:02:52.800> and

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
too grainy really to be honest and

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.050 
too grainy really to be honest and
that's<00:02:53.010> even<00:02:53.250> with<00:02:53.280> the<00:02:53.459> bright<00:02:53.670> studio

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
that's even with the bright studio

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.410 
that's even with the bright studio
lights<00:02:54.300> here<00:02:54.989> in<00:02:55.019> the<00:02:55.380> office<00:02:55.940> so<00:02:56.940> probably

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
lights here in the office so probably

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:58.610 
lights here in the office so probably
will<00:02:57.569> come<00:02:57.690> into<00:02:57.900> its<00:02:58.019> own<00:02:58.140> when<00:02:58.200> you're<00:02:58.500> out

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
will come into its own when you're out

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.530 
will come into its own when you're out
and<00:02:58.769> about<00:02:58.830> in<00:02:59.130> bright<00:02:59.310> sunshine<00:02:59.550> but<00:03:00.030> indoor

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
and about in bright sunshine but indoor

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.449 
and about in bright sunshine but indoor
use<00:03:00.750> probably<00:03:01.380> want<00:03:01.530> to<00:03:01.590> knock<00:03:02.130> it<00:03:02.280> down<00:03:02.310> to

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
use probably want to knock it down to

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:05.660 
use probably want to knock it down to
720p<00:03:03.360> now<00:03:04.110> when<00:03:04.260> I<00:03:04.290> am<00:03:04.380> out<00:03:04.530> and<00:03:04.739> about<00:03:04.800> I<00:03:05.190> will

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
720p now when I am out and about I will

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.880 
720p now when I am out and about I will
