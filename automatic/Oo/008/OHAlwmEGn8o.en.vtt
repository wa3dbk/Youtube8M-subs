00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
someone can think of using them like

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:39.770

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 
yeah I didn't make that up you turn into

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:22.009

this<00:04:22.140> game<00:04:22.350> I<00:04:22.560> had<00:04:22.770> no<00:04:23.220> idea<00:04:23.250> baby<00:04:23.760> was<00:04:23.970> a

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
this game I had no idea baby was a

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.150 
this game I had no idea baby was a
female<00:04:24.270> so<00:04:25.020> I<00:04:25.050> thought<00:04:25.290> maybe<00:04:25.590> turned<00:04:25.920> into

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 
female so I thought maybe turned into

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:27.830 
female so I thought maybe turned into
like<00:04:26.250> a<00:04:26.310> superhero<00:04:26.850> with<00:04:27.120> a<00:04:27.330> crown<00:04:27.570> or

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 
like a superhero with a crown or

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.590 
like a superhero with a crown or
something<00:04:28.230> I<00:04:29.060> personally<00:04:30.060> like<00:04:30.150> that<00:04:30.330> idea

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:30.600 
something I personally like that idea

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.890 
something I personally like that idea
better<00:04:30.780> than<00:04:31.050> being<00:04:31.500> a<00:04:31.590> fairy<00:04:31.770> princess

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:32.900

better than being a fairy princess
moving<00:04:33.900> forward<00:04:34.140> if<00:04:34.500> you<00:04:34.770> mess<00:04:34.980> up<00:04:35.010> the<00:04:35.250> timing

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:35.640 
moving forward if you mess up the timing

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:37.610 
moving forward if you mess up the timing
of<00:04:35.700> the<00:04:35.820> buttons<00:04:36.180> baby<00:04:36.960> will<00:04:37.170> start<00:04:37.380> getting

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:37.620 
of the buttons baby will start getting

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:39.800 
of the buttons baby will start getting
smaller<00:04:38.160> and<00:04:38.430> the<00:04:38.880> levels<00:04:39.210> lions<00:04:39.540> will<00:04:39.660> get

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:39.810 
smaller and the levels lions will get

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:42.500 
smaller and the levels lions will get
more<00:04:39.960> distorted<00:04:40.940> eventually<00:04:41.940> baby<00:04:42.150> will<00:04:42.330> turn

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:42.510 
more distorted eventually baby will turn

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:44.570 
more distorted eventually baby will turn
into<00:04:42.600> a<00:04:42.720> frog<00:04:42.960> if<00:04:43.650> you<00:04:43.800> take<00:04:43.950> a<00:04:43.980> number<00:04:44.220> more

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 
heads to turn into a warm and after that

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.420 
heads to turn into a warm and after that
you<00:04:47.700> disappear<00:04:48.360> it's<00:04:48.660> game<00:04:49.140> over<00:04:49.280> getting<00:04:50.280> hit

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.430

state and not only are you getting
smaller<00:04:54.360> but<00:04:55.020> I<00:04:55.110> stated<00:04:55.350> earlier<00:04:55.590> the<00:04:56.280> level

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:56.610 
smaller but I stated earlier the level

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:58.909 
smaller but I stated earlier the level
gets<00:04:56.790> really<00:04:57.300> distorted<00:04:57.450> and<00:04:57.990> I<00:04:58.470> personally

00:04:58.909 --> 00:04:58.919 
gets really distorted and I personally

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:00.830 
gets really distorted and I personally
find<00:04:59.100> that<00:04:59.310> this<00:04:59.490> makes<00:04:59.700> me<00:04:59.910> make<00:05:00.120> more<00:05:00.419> errors

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:00.840 
find that this makes me make more errors

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:03.200 
find that this makes me make more errors
