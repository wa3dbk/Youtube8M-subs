you

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.170 

then<00:01:52.560> you<00:01:52.800> go<00:01:52.950> to<00:01:52.980> a<00:01:53.100> bridge<00:01:53.430> which<00:01:53.850> starts

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
then you go to a bridge which starts

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.310

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:23.620 
which starts fifth the 4th strings 10th
to<00:05:17.360> 12th<00:05:17.570> fret<00:05:17.810> Peloquin<00:05:18.440> eight<00:05:18.800> times<00:05:22.630> then

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:23.630 
to 12th fret Peloquin eight times then

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:29.219 
to 12th fret Peloquin eight times then
at<00:05:23.750> the<00:05:23.870> 12th<00:05:24.200> and<00:05:24.320> 14th<00:05:24.680> back<00:05:24.920> five<00:05:25.280> times

00:05:29.219 --> 00:05:29.229 

00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:38.490 

so<00:05:30.229> the<00:05:30.320> interlude<00:05:30.710> should<00:05:30.889> sound<00:05:31.070> like

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:38.500 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:41.060 

there's<00:05:39.490> a<00:05:39.580> long<00:05:39.760> pause<00:05:40.000> and<00:05:40.300> that<00:05:40.390> there's<00:05:40.630> a

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:41.070 
there's a long pause and that there's a

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:44.010 
there's a long pause and that there's a
second<00:05:42.070> interlude<00:05:42.430> which<00:05:42.640> starts<00:05:43.020> power

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:44.020 
second interlude which starts power

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:45.810 
second interlude which starts power
chord<00:05:44.290> on<00:05:44.560> the<00:05:44.590> fifth<00:05:44.980> and<00:05:45.250> sixth<00:05:45.430> strings<00:05:45.580> for

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:45.820 
chord on the fifth and sixth strings for

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:54.850 
chord on the fifth and sixth strings for
seven<00:05:46.030> the<00:05:46.120> fifth<00:05:46.300> fret<00:05:46.510> sixteen<00:05:47.260> times

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:54.860 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:06:00.629 

then<00:05:55.860> you<00:05:55.980> go<00:05:56.100> back<00:05:56.130> to<00:05:56.700> the<00:05:56.970> main<00:05:57.150> riff

00:06:00.629 --> 00:06:00.639 

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:03.390 

four<00:06:01.389> times<00:06:01.719> there's<00:06:02.530> a<00:06:02.620> quick<00:06:02.830> grip<00:06:03.069> on<00:06:03.310> the

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:03.400 
four times there's a quick grip on the

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:04.890 
four times there's a quick grip on the
fifth<00:06:03.580> of<00:06:03.669> six<00:06:03.729> drinks<00:06:04.060> seven<00:06:04.449> the<00:06:04.509> ninth<00:06:04.689> fret

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:04.900 
fifth of six drinks seven the ninth fret

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:09.800 
fifth of six drinks seven the ninth fret
power<00:06:05.229> cord<00:06:05.530> eight<00:06:05.860> times

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:09.810 

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:14.780 

down<00:06:10.620> two<00:06:10.889> thousand<00:06:11.370> seven<00:06:11.639> five<00:06:11.940> times<00:06:13.790> so

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:14.790 
down two thousand seven five times so

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:20.690 
down two thousand seven five times so
that<00:06:14.880> rip<00:06:15.120> should<00:06:15.300> sound<00:06:15.480> like

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:20.700 

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:23.520 

then<00:06:21.700> you<00:06:22.150> go<00:06:22.270> to<00:06:22.300> another<00:06:22.690> bridge<00:06:23.020> the<00:06:23.500> first

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:23.530 
then you go to another bridge the first

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:31.080 
then you go to another bridge the first
half<00:06:23.920> is<00:06:24.070> the<00:06:24.160> same<00:06:24.370> as<00:06:24.490> the<00:06:24.610> others

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:31.090 

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:33.270 

for<00:06:31.930> the<00:06:32.020> second<00:06:32.350> half<00:06:32.380> you<00:06:32.590> start<00:06:32.860> fourth

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:33.280 
for the second half you start fourth

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:37.260 
for the second half you start fourth
string<00:06:33.550> fourth<00:06:33.610> fret<00:06:34.680> sixth<00:06:35.680> fret<00:06:36.270> third

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:37.270 
string fourth fret sixth fret third

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:58.310 
string fourth fret sixth fret third
string<00:06:37.300> fourth<00:06:44.790> second<00:06:45.790> three<00:06:45.940> seven<00:06:50.520> eight

00:06:58.310 --> 00:06:58.320 

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:14.260 

so<00:06:59.320> that<00:06:59.350> bridge<00:06:59.650> should<00:06:59.800> sound<00:07:00.040> like

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:14.270 

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:16.430 

definitely<00:07:15.270> after<00:07:15.390> you<00:07:15.720> play<00:07:15.870> open<00:07:16.200> six

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:16.440 
definitely after you play open six

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:17.450 
definitely after you play open six
string<00:07:16.680> and<00:07:16.830> seventh<00:07:17.160> fret<00:07:17.280> on<00:07:17.340> the

00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:17.460 
string and seventh fret on the

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:26.830 
string and seventh fret on the
third-string<00:07:17.700> six<00:07:18.270> times<00:07:24.230> four<00:07:25.230> strings<00:07:25.500> if

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:26.840 
third-string six times four strings if

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:32.830 
third-string six times four strings if
we're<00:07:27.840> that<00:07:27.960> four<00:07:28.230> times

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:32.840 

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:35.650 

and<00:07:33.440> that<00:07:33.919> you<00:07:34.310> hit<00:07:34.550> a<00:07:34.760> power<00:07:35.030> chord<00:07:35.330> on<00:07:35.600> the

00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:35.660 
and that you hit a power chord on the

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:40.710 
and that you hit a power chord on the
fifth<00:07:36.440> the<00:07:37.430> sixth<00:07:37.700> range<00:07:37.910> 12th<00:07:38.210> and<00:07:38.330> 14th<00:07:38.660> fret

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:40.720 
fifth the sixth range 12th and 14th fret

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:58.390 
fifth the sixth range 12th and 14th fret
so<00:07:41.720> the<00:07:41.840> answer<00:07:42.139> should<00:07:42.290> sound<00:07:42.500> like

00:07:58.390 --> 00:07:58.400 

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:00.249
