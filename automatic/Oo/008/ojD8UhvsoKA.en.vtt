have<00:01:33.840> a<00:01:34.200> DB<00:01:34.470> access<00:01:34.860> so<00:01:35.340> let's<00:01:35.460> go<00:01:35.549> back<00:01:35.700> home

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
have a DB access so let's go back home

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:40.520 
have a DB access so let's go back home
again<00:01:36.979> back<00:01:37.979> to<00:01:38.009> the<00:01:38.310> launcher<00:01:39.079> there<00:01:40.079> we<00:01:40.320> go

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
again back to the launcher there we go

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.550 
again back to the launcher there we go
let's<00:01:40.740> go<00:01:40.860> to<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.090> Amazon<00:01:42.090> one<00:01:42.540> and<00:01:42.810> see<00:01:43.350> how

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
let's go to the Amazon one and see how

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.380 
let's go to the Amazon one and see how
the<00:01:43.619> bottom<00:01:44.369> bar<00:01:44.490> did<00:01:44.700> just<00:01:44.850> disappear<00:01:45.270> on<00:01:45.360> me

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
the bottom bar did just disappear on me

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.120 
the bottom bar did just disappear on me
there<00:01:45.630> I'm<00:01:45.689> not<00:01:45.780> quite<00:01:46.200> sure<00:01:46.229> why<00:01:46.740> let's<00:01:47.009> see

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
there I'm not quite sure why let's see

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.469 
there I'm not quite sure why let's see
if<00:01:47.189> we<00:01:47.280> can<00:01:47.369> get<00:01:47.460> that<00:01:47.549> back<00:01:47.759> there<00:01:48.210> it<00:01:48.390> is

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
if we can get that back there it is

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.200 
if we can get that back there it is
alright<00:01:48.750> so<00:01:48.899> we'll<00:01:48.990> go<00:01:49.110> home<00:01:49.290> and<00:01:49.560> so<00:01:50.490> one

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
alright so we'll go home and so one

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.539 
alright so we'll go home and so one
thing<00:01:51.240> about<00:01:51.899> this<00:01:52.590> is<00:01:52.829> like<00:01:53.009> if<00:01:53.189> you<00:01:53.220> don't

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
thing about this is like if you don't

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:54.950 
thing about this is like if you don't
want<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:53.880> stock<00:01:54.090> launcher<00:01:54.299> you're<00:01:54.750> still

want the stock launcher you're still
missing<00:01:55.229> framework<00:01:55.619> stuff<00:01:55.829> so<00:01:55.979> you<00:01:56.040> don't

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
missing framework stuff so you don't
