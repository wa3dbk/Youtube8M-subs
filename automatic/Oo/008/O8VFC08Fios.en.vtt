a bit more portable but I don't really
recommend<00:00:59.039> doing<00:00:59.309> that<00:00:59.489> because<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.879> hinges

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
recommend doing that because the hinges

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:01.910 
recommend doing that because the hinges
on<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.449> sides<00:01:00.690> are<00:01:01.020> not<00:01:01.320> that<00:01:01.590> great<00:01:01.859> of

very<00:01:33.479> strong<00:01:33.840> base<00:01:34.380> which<00:01:34.650> is<00:01:34.680> a<00:01:34.799> good<00:01:35.070> and<00:01:35.280> a

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
very strong base which is a good and a

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.910 
very strong base which is a good and a
bad<00:01:35.369> thing<00:01:35.880> and<00:01:36.090> during<00:01:37.020> playing<00:01:37.259> some<00:01:37.619> songs

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
bad thing and during playing some songs

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.499 
bad thing and during playing some songs

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
I noticed that the base would just

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.140 
I noticed that the base would just
really<00:01:39.840> overwhelmed<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.650> whole<00:01:40.829> song<00:01:41.130> and<00:01:41.460> I

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
really overwhelmed the whole song and I
