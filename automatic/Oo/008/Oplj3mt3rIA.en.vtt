00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
just testing it if it survives it

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.019 
just testing it if it survives it
probably<00:00:19.350> will<00:00:19.529> but<00:00:20.160> it's<00:00:20.310> still<00:00:20.520> fun<00:00:20.789> to<00:00:20.820> do

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
probably will but it's still fun to do

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.450
