the new Canon Powershot SX 280 I

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.459 
the new Canon Powershot SX 280 I
basically<00:00:09.570> had<00:00:09.809> it<00:00:09.929> from<00:00:10.110> the<00:00:10.200> very<00:00:10.320> start

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
basically had it from the very start

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.499 
basically had it from the very start
first<00:00:11.010> day<00:00:11.190> I<00:00:11.219> started<00:00:11.639> using<00:00:11.790> it<00:00:12.090> took<00:00:12.300> some

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
first day I started using it took some

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.720 
first day I started using it took some
pictures<00:00:12.740> recorded<00:00:13.740> some<00:00:13.920> video<00:00:14.190> after<00:00:14.700> a

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
pictures recorded some video after a

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.240 
pictures recorded some video after a
couple<00:00:14.969> minutes<00:00:15.210> of<00:00:15.540> recording<00:00:15.990> video<00:00:16.139> at<00:00:16.619> 60

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
couple minutes of recording video at 60

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:18.620 
couple minutes of recording video at 60
frames<00:00:17.490> per<00:00:17.640> second<00:00:18.210> and<00:00:18.300> doing<00:00:18.480> a<00:00:18.510> little

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
frames per second and doing a little

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.170 
frames per second and doing a little
zooming<00:00:19.050> that<00:00:19.500> read<00:00:19.859> fast<00:00:20.400> flashing<00:00:21.029> light

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
zooming that read fast flashing light

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.599 
zooming that read fast flashing light
was<00:00:21.359> going<00:00:21.510> and<00:00:22.109> I<00:00:22.199> thought<00:00:22.380> that's<00:00:22.619> terrible

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
was going and I thought that's terrible

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.290 
was going and I thought that's terrible
I<00:00:24.619> shut<00:00:25.619> it<00:00:25.650> off<00:00:25.890> recharge<00:00:26.519> the<00:00:26.699> battery<00:00:27.000> came

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
I shut it off recharge the battery came

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.179 
I shut it off recharge the battery came
back<00:00:27.510> I<00:00:27.810> decided<00:00:28.380> to<00:00:28.560> test<00:00:28.740> it<00:00:28.890> out<00:00:29.039> just

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
back I decided to test it out just

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.580 
back I decided to test it out just
taking<00:00:29.550> pictures<00:00:29.730> and<00:00:30.420> I<00:00:30.449> would<00:00:31.199> take<00:00:31.320> a<00:00:31.349> few

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
taking pictures and I would take a few

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.440 
taking pictures and I would take a few
pictures<00:00:31.769> put<00:00:32.309> the<00:00:32.430> camera<00:00:32.730> to<00:00:32.850> shut<00:00:33.239> it<00:00:33.329> off

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
pictures put the camera to shut it off

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:34.220 
pictures put the camera to shut it off
put<00:00:33.719> it<00:00:33.809> down

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
put it down

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.870 
put it down
next<00:00:34.590> time<00:00:34.680> I<00:00:34.770> walked<00:00:35.010> by<00:00:35.190> I<00:00:35.219> took<00:00:35.579> some<00:00:35.760> more

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
next time I walked by I took some more

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.360 
next time I walked by I took some more
pictures<00:00:36.120> to<00:00:36.570> test<00:00:36.809> it<00:00:36.960> out<00:00:37.079> got<00:00:37.680> up<00:00:37.770> to<00:00:37.920> 400

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
pictures to test it out got up to 400

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.100 
pictures to test it out got up to 400
pictures<00:00:38.550> never<00:00:39.149> had<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.420> flashing<00:00:39.899> light

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
pictures never had the flashing light

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.569 
pictures never had the flashing light
and<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.500> battery<00:00:40.829> indicator<00:00:41.070> was<00:00:41.370> still

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
and the battery indicator was still

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.060 
and the battery indicator was still
showing<00:00:41.879> full<00:00:42.120> so<00:00:42.870> I<00:00:42.899> decided<00:00:43.469> to<00:00:43.590> test<00:00:43.890> out

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
showing full so I decided to test out

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.220 
showing full so I decided to test out
the<00:00:44.250> video<00:00:44.520> and<00:00:44.579> sure<00:00:45.030> enough<00:00:45.059> doing<00:00:45.840> the

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
the video and sure enough doing the

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.170 
the video and sure enough doing the
video<00:00:46.680> recording<00:00:47.219> from<00:00:47.370> a<00:00:47.550> fully<00:00:47.760> charged

battery<00:00:48.300> at<00:00:48.930> about<00:00:49.250> seven<00:00:50.250> seven<00:00:50.730> and<00:00:50.850> a<00:00:50.879> half

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
battery at about seven seven and a half

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.510 
battery at about seven seven and a half
minutes<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.719> red<00:00:52.289> indicator<00:00:52.860> lights<00:00:53.129> started

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
minutes the red indicator lights started

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.720 
minutes the red indicator lights started
flashing<00:00:53.699> but<00:00:54.600> since<00:00:55.050> I<00:00:55.440> had<00:00:56.100> read<00:00:56.370> that<00:00:56.399> it

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
flashing but since I had read that it

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.000 
flashing but since I had read that it
may<00:00:56.879> not<00:00:57.030> be<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.300> battery<00:00:57.600> itself<00:00:57.930> just<00:00:58.770> that

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
may not be the battery itself just that

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.920 
may not be the battery itself just that
it's<00:00:59.190> uh<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.820> indicator<00:01:00.300> light<00:01:00.570> is<00:01:00.600> getting

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
it's uh the indicator light is getting

it's uh the indicator light is getting
it<00:01:01.170> wrong<00:01:01.320> I<00:01:01.620> continued<00:01:02.100> to<00:01:02.250> record<00:01:02.430> and<00:01:02.820> I<00:01:02.850> was

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
it wrong I continued to record and I was

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.939 
it wrong I continued to record and I was
able<00:01:03.120> to<00:01:03.300> get<00:01:03.570> not<00:01:04.049> recording<00:01:04.500> all<00:01:04.619> at<00:01:04.769> once

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
able to get not recording all at once

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.100 
able to get not recording all at once
but<00:01:05.250> in<00:01:05.369> maybe<00:01:05.580> four<00:01:06.000> chunks<00:01:06.390> I<00:01:06.720> was<00:01:06.869> able<00:01:06.960> to

just<00:01:13.439> shut<00:01:13.619> itself<00:01:13.950> off<00:01:14.189> because<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.760> battery

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
just shut itself off because the battery

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.480 
just shut itself off because the battery
had<00:01:15.240> gotten<00:01:15.420> too<00:01:15.630> low<00:01:15.780> on<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.200> Canon<00:01:16.560> forums<00:01:17.070> a

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
had gotten too low on the Canon forums a

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.460 
had gotten too low on the Canon forums a
lot<00:01:17.909> of<00:01:18.000> people<00:01:18.270> talking<00:01:18.659> about<00:01:18.990> this<00:01:19.170> and

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
lot of people talking about this and

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.760 
lot of people talking about this and
most<00:01:19.680> of<00:01:19.860> them<00:01:19.979> it<00:01:20.130> seems<00:01:20.369> to<00:01:20.640> be<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:21.770> sensor

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
most of them it seems to be the sensor

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.850 
most of them it seems to be the sensor
battery<00:01:23.400> sensor<00:01:23.880> indicator<00:01:24.509> that's<00:01:24.990> at<00:01:25.470> fault

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
battery sensor indicator that's at fault

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.859 
battery sensor indicator that's at fault
in<00:01:26.130> some<00:01:26.430> way<00:01:26.610> though<00:01:27.210> some<00:01:27.479> people<00:01:27.780> are

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
in some way though some people are

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.230 
in some way though some people are
saying<00:01:28.140> they<00:01:28.439> only<00:01:28.590> get<00:01:28.799> to<00:01:28.950> take<00:01:29.130> thirty<00:01:30.030> to

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
saying they only get to take thirty to

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.969 
saying they only get to take thirty to
fifty<00:01:30.390> pictures<00:01:30.990> and<00:01:31.290> then<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.439> camera<00:01:31.770> shuts

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
fifty pictures and then the camera shuts

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.010 
fifty pictures and then the camera shuts
itself<00:01:32.310> off<00:01:32.549> it<00:01:33.000> could<00:01:33.329> be<00:01:33.479> tied<00:01:33.689> into<00:01:33.930> that

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
itself off it could be tied into that

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.719 
itself off it could be tied into that
but<00:01:34.470> if<00:01:34.650> that<00:01:34.829> were<00:01:34.950> happening<00:01:35.070> to<00:01:35.340> me<00:01:35.520> I<00:01:35.549> think

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
but if that were happening to me I think

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.789 
but if that were happening to me I think
I<00:01:35.939> definitely<00:01:36.329> would<00:01:36.509> return<00:01:36.810> it<00:01:37.020> in<00:01:37.409> my<00:01:37.560> case

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
I definitely would return it in my case

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.700 
I definitely would return it in my case
though<00:01:38.130> I<00:01:38.820> think<00:01:39.450> it's<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:39.960> indicator<00:01:40.439> that's

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
though I think it's the indicator that's

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.190 
though I think it's the indicator that's
faulty<00:01:41.189> I've<00:01:41.759> also<00:01:42.360> read<00:01:42.630> some<00:01:42.869> people<00:01:43.110> have

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
faulty I've also read some people have

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.600 
faulty I've also read some people have
changed<00:01:43.350> out<00:01:43.649> batteries<00:01:44.040> and<00:01:44.159> that<00:01:44.430> hasn't

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
changed out batteries and that hasn't

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.730 
changed out batteries and that hasn't
helped<00:01:45.000> I<00:01:45.149> have<00:01:45.509> my<00:01:45.689> own<00:01:45.810> theory<00:01:46.350> on<00:01:46.500> what's

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
helped I have my own theory on what's

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.670 
helped I have my own theory on what's
going<00:01:47.009> on<00:01:47.159> I'm<00:01:48.119> thinking<00:01:48.780> that<00:01:49.020> this<00:01:49.619> is

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
going on I'm thinking that this is

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.940 
going on I'm thinking that this is
basically<00:01:50.100> the<00:01:50.810> sx260<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:52.170> previous<00:01:52.560> model

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
basically the sx260 the previous model

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.480 
basically the sx260 the previous model
in<00:01:53.040> terms<00:01:53.250> of<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:54.180> housing<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:55.409> lens<00:01:55.710> the

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
in terms of the housing the lens the

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.700 
in terms of the housing the lens the
sensor<00:01:57.000> what<00:01:57.509> they've<00:01:57.689> changed<00:01:58.020> is<00:01:58.530> they've

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
sensor what they've changed is they've

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.090 
sensor what they've changed is they've
added<00:01:59.070> a<00:01:59.479> faster<00:02:00.479> processor<00:02:01.259> basically<00:02:01.860> the

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
added a faster processor basically the

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.730 
added a faster processor basically the
digit<00:02:02.430> six<00:02:02.759> which<00:02:03.420> I<00:02:03.719> imagine<00:02:04.049> draws<00:02:04.469> more

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
digit six which I imagine draws more

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.310 
digit six which I imagine draws more
electricity<00:02:05.100> and<00:02:05.549> they<00:02:06.390> now<00:02:06.570> allow<00:02:06.899> you<00:02:06.960> to

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
electricity and they now allow you to

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.680 
electricity and they now allow you to
record<00:02:07.680> in<00:02:07.950> high-definition<00:02:08.399> at<00:02:08.849> 60<00:02:09.420> frames

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
record in high-definition at 60 frames

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.089 
record in high-definition at 60 frames
per<00:02:09.840> second<00:02:10.379> which<00:02:10.530> they<00:02:10.709> didn't<00:02:10.920> allow

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
per second which they didn't allow

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.760 
per second which they didn't allow
before<00:02:11.489> and<00:02:11.730> that<00:02:12.239> video<00:02:12.750> encoding

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
before and that video encoding

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.440 
before and that video encoding
is<00:02:13.830> about<00:02:14.070> the<00:02:14.220> most<00:02:14.430> intensive<00:02:15.120> thing<00:02:15.300> you

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
is about the most intensive thing you

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.180 
is about the most intensive thing you
can<00:02:15.600> do<00:02:15.750> on<00:02:15.960> a<00:02:15.990> computer<00:02:16.230> and<00:02:16.650> basically<00:02:16.770> it's

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
can do on a computer and basically it's

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.760 
can do on a computer and basically it's
a<00:02:17.250> computer<00:02:17.640> chip<00:02:17.670> in<00:02:18.060> here<00:02:18.330> so<00:02:18.840> what<00:02:19.470> I<00:02:19.500> think

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
a computer chip in here so what I think

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.800 
a computer chip in here so what I think
you're<00:02:19.920> looking<00:02:20.070> at<00:02:20.370> is<00:02:20.610> this<00:02:20.820> new<00:02:21.090> higher

we're working on a fix for it presumably
it<00:03:27.720> would<00:03:27.840> be<00:03:27.930> a<00:03:27.959> firmware<00:03:28.410> update<00:03:28.830> that's

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
it would be a firmware update that's

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.940 
it would be a firmware update that's
basically<00:03:29.850> a<00:03:30.530> program<00:03:31.530> that<00:03:31.740> you<00:03:31.830> would

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
basically a program that you would

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:33.949 
basically a program that you would
download<00:03:32.220> and<00:03:32.850> either<00:03:33.000> using<00:03:33.450> the<00:03:33.480> Canon

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
download and either using the Canon

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:36.140 
download and either using the Canon
utility<00:03:34.470> on<00:03:34.620> your<00:03:34.650> computer<00:03:35.250> plugged<00:03:35.970> into

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
utility on your computer plugged into

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.690 
utility on your computer plugged into
the<00:03:36.360> camera<00:03:36.750> or<00:03:36.990> possibly<00:03:37.650> if<00:03:38.040> you<00:03:38.340> put<00:03:38.550> that

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
the camera or possibly if you put that

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.120 
the camera or possibly if you put that
file<00:03:39.030> onto<00:03:39.510> an<00:03:39.630> SD<00:03:39.750> card<00:03:40.290> and<00:03:40.620> go<00:03:40.770> into<00:03:40.920> some

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
file onto an SD card and go into some

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:42.800 
file onto an SD card and go into some
special<00:03:41.610> mode<00:03:41.790> on<00:03:41.970> the<00:03:42.060> camera<00:03:42.270> it<00:03:42.690> will

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
special mode on the camera it will

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.290 
special mode on the camera it will
basically<00:03:43.010> reprogram<00:03:44.010> some<00:03:44.940> of<00:03:45.150> the

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:45.300 
basically reprogram some of the

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:47.420 
basically reprogram some of the
information<00:03:45.840> in<00:03:45.959> the<00:03:46.050> camera<00:03:46.440> so<00:03:46.770> that<00:03:47.070> the

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
information in the camera so that the

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.760 
information in the camera so that the
battery<00:03:48.150> sensor<00:03:48.720> at<00:03:48.900> least<00:03:49.080> in<00:03:49.230> video<00:03:49.530> mode

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:49.770 
battery sensor at least in video mode

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:52.280 
battery sensor at least in video mode
maybe<00:03:50.430> can<00:03:50.760> make<00:03:51.000> the<00:03:51.150> adjustment<00:03:51.780> for<00:03:52.050> the

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
maybe can make the adjustment for the

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.440 
maybe can make the adjustment for the
new<00:03:52.680> voltage<00:03:53.310> levels<00:03:53.730> when<00:03:53.970> you're<00:03:54.120> recording

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
new voltage levels when you're recording

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.930 
new voltage levels when you're recording
in<00:03:54.810> high<00:03:54.840> definition<00:03:55.320> video<00:03:55.800> after<00:03:56.580> I<00:03:56.610> had

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
in high definition video after I had

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:58.490 
in high definition video after I had
been<00:03:57.180> using<00:03:57.390> this<00:03:57.570> a<00:03:57.720> few<00:03:57.900> days<00:03:58.020> and<00:03:58.260> having

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
been using this a few days and having

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:59.990 
been using this a few days and having
the<00:03:58.560> battery<00:03:58.830> issue<00:03:59.010> I<00:03:59.160> was<00:03:59.430> seriously

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
the battery issue I was seriously

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.080 
the battery issue I was seriously
considering<00:04:00.600> returning<00:04:01.170> it<00:04:01.320> and<00:04:01.500> then<00:04:02.220> I<00:04:02.550> took

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
considering returning it and then I took

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:04.699 
considering returning it and then I took
the<00:04:03.450> best<00:04:03.600> picture<00:04:03.959> I've<00:04:04.050> ever<00:04:04.140> taken<00:04:04.440> in<00:04:04.680> my

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
the best picture I've ever taken in my

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:06.740 
the best picture I've ever taken in my
life<00:04:05.040> with<00:04:05.430> this<00:04:05.550> camera<00:04:05.850> which<00:04:06.150> I<00:04:06.300> don't<00:04:06.510> give

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
life with this camera which I don't give

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.480 
life with this camera which I don't give
a<00:04:06.780> whole<00:04:06.990> lot<00:04:07.110> of<00:04:07.230> credit<00:04:07.380> to<00:04:07.770> that<00:04:07.980> to<00:04:08.280> me

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:08.490 
a whole lot of credit to that to me

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:09.710 
a whole lot of credit to that to me
because<00:04:09.030> I<00:04:09.120> don't<00:04:09.270> think<00:04:09.330> I've<00:04:09.510> suddenly

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
because I don't think I've suddenly

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.570 
because I don't think I've suddenly
become<00:04:10.050> a<00:04:10.080> better<00:04:10.260> photographer<00:04:10.440> but<00:04:11.190> and<00:04:11.489> it

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:11.580 
become a better photographer but and it

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:13.310 
become a better photographer but and it
wasn't<00:04:11.760> a<00:04:12.000> particularly<00:04:12.390> unique<00:04:12.630> photo<00:04:13.050> it

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:13.320 
wasn't a particularly unique photo it

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.020 
wasn't a particularly unique photo it
was<00:04:13.440> just<00:04:13.620> a<00:04:13.739> squirrel<00:04:14.130> that<00:04:14.459> happen<00:04:14.730> to<00:04:14.820> pause

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
was just a squirrel that happen to pause

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:16.940 
was just a squirrel that happen to pause
in<00:04:15.360> the<00:04:15.420> tree<00:04:15.660> and<00:04:15.870> look<00:04:16.020> over<00:04:16.200> at<00:04:16.470> me<00:04:16.680> but

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:16.950 
in the tree and look over at me but

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:18.860 
in the tree and look over at me but
because<00:04:17.370> the<00:04:17.640> camera<00:04:18.000> would<00:04:18.120> start<00:04:18.419> so<00:04:18.630> quick

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
because the camera would start so quick

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:20.960 
because the camera would start so quick
because<00:04:19.109> it<00:04:19.380> could<00:04:19.530> focus<00:04:20.190> so<00:04:20.580> quickly

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
because it could focus so quickly

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:23.010 
because it could focus so quickly
because<00:04:21.330> of<00:04:21.480> the<00:04:21.570> 20x<00:04:22.049> zoom<00:04:22.200> because

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.020 
because of the 20x zoom because

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.290 
because of the 20x zoom because
zoom<00:04:23.319> is<00:04:23.560> very<00:04:23.800> steady<00:04:24.310> and<00:04:24.430> gets<00:04:24.759> you<00:04:24.879> a<00:04:24.910> very

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 
zoom is very steady and gets you a very

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:26.670 
zoom is very steady and gets you a very
sharp<00:04:25.629> picture<00:04:26.050> if<00:04:26.199> you<00:04:26.229> have<00:04:26.410> enough<00:04:26.620> light

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 
sharp picture if you have enough light

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.890 
sharp picture if you have enough light
it<00:04:27.550> ended<00:04:27.970> up<00:04:28.030> being<00:04:28.240> the<00:04:28.330> best<00:04:28.360> picture<00:04:28.810> I've

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:28.900 
it ended up being the best picture I've

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.170 
it ended up being the best picture I've
ever<00:04:28.990> taken<00:04:29.259> so<00:04:29.740> I<00:04:29.770> can't<00:04:30.520> send<00:04:30.729> this<00:04:30.819> camera

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.180 
ever taken so I can't send this camera

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:33.240 
ever taken so I can't send this camera
back<00:04:31.300> because<00:04:31.930> I<00:04:32.020> can't<00:04:32.289> do<00:04:32.620> things<00:04:32.889> like<00:04:33.069> that

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:33.250 
back because I can't do things like that

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:35.070 
back because I can't do things like that
with<00:04:33.669> this<00:04:33.789> guy<00:04:34.090> which<00:04:34.360> is<00:04:34.389> my<00:04:34.659> previous

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:35.080 
with this guy which is my previous

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.339 
with this guy which is my previous
camera<00:04:35.530> the<00:04:35.710> Canon<00:04:36.490> ELPH<00:04:36.699> 310<00:04:37.479> which<00:04:38.110> was<00:04:38.319> a

00:04:38.339 --> 00:04:38.349 
camera the Canon ELPH 310 which was a

00:04:38.349 --> 00:04:40.140 
camera the Canon ELPH 310 which was a
good<00:04:38.590> camera<00:04:39.039> that's<00:04:39.220> certainly<00:04:39.610> small<00:04:39.940> and

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150 
good camera that's certainly small and

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:41.999 
good camera that's certainly small and
lightweight<00:04:40.300> but<00:04:40.990> this<00:04:41.110> is<00:04:41.289> small<00:04:41.620> enough<00:04:41.770> and

00:04:41.999 --> 00:04:42.009 
lightweight but this is small enough and

00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:43.559 
lightweight but this is small enough and
lightweight<00:04:42.520> enough<00:04:42.669> to<00:04:42.849> take<00:04:43.240> all<00:04:43.419> the

00:04:43.559 --> 00:04:43.569 
lightweight enough to take all the

00:04:43.569 --> 00:04:46.589 
lightweight enough to take all the
places<00:04:43.780> that<00:04:43.960> I<00:04:44.080> took<00:04:44.199> this<00:04:44.590> but<00:04:45.250> a<00:04:45.819> tech<00:04:46.240> soom

00:04:46.589 --> 00:04:46.599 
places that I took this but a tech soom

00:04:46.599 --> 00:04:48.330 
places that I took this but a tech soom
and<00:04:46.990> it<00:04:47.080> takes<00:04:47.289> a<00:04:47.440> while<00:04:47.560> to<00:04:47.590> start<00:04:47.770> up<00:04:48.129> it

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:48.340 
and it takes a while to start up it

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:49.980 
and it takes a while to start up it
takes<00:04:48.520> a<00:04:48.639> while<00:04:48.759> between<00:04:48.940> pictures<00:04:49.360> I<00:04:49.780> just

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:49.990 
takes a while between pictures I just

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:52.469 
takes a while between pictures I just
got<00:04:50.379> used<00:04:50.620> to<00:04:50.830> this<00:04:51.220> one<00:04:51.430> now<00:04:51.639> and<00:04:51.669> so<00:04:52.120> I<00:04:52.150> can't

00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:52.479 
got used to this one now and so I can't

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:53.520 
got used to this one now and so I can't
go<00:04:52.569> back<00:04:52.750> to<00:04:52.960> my<00:04:53.110> ELF

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:53.530 
go back to my ELF

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:56.309 
go back to my ELF
now<00:04:53.860> other<00:04:54.069> than<00:04:54.190> the<00:04:54.340> battery<00:04:55.000> issue<00:04:55.210> and<00:04:55.930> the

00:04:56.309 --> 00:04:56.319 
now other than the battery issue and the

00:04:56.319 --> 00:04:58.439 
now other than the battery issue and the
stupid<00:04:57.190> placement<00:04:57.639> of<00:04:57.699> the<00:04:57.789> flash<00:04:58.000> that<00:04:58.270> keeps

00:04:58.439 --> 00:04:58.449 
stupid placement of the flash that keeps

00:04:58.449 --> 00:04:59.790 
stupid placement of the flash that keeps
wanting<00:04:58.630> to<00:04:58.750> pop<00:04:58.900> my<00:04:59.050> finger<00:04:59.349> off<00:04:59.500> when<00:04:59.710> it

00:04:59.790 --> 00:04:59.800 
wanting to pop my finger off when it

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.290 
wanting to pop my finger off when it
wants<00:05:00.039> to<00:05:00.099> use<00:05:00.310> the<00:05:00.460> flash<00:05:00.610> other<00:05:00.909> than<00:05:01.150> those
