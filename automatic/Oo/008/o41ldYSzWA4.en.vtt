00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
Huggies overnight um these aren't

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.850 
Huggies overnight um these aren't

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.150 
but I thought I might give it a go

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
us but I really liked her to get back in

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.910 
us but I really liked her to get back in
her<00:02:26.370> bed<00:02:26.870> just<00:02:27.870> make<00:02:28.019> her<00:02:28.140> as<00:02:28.230> comfortable<00:02:28.260> as

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
her bed just make her as comfortable as

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.650 
her bed just make her as comfortable as
possible<00:02:28.950> and<00:02:29.519> these<00:02:29.790> diapers<00:02:30.060> are<00:02:30.420> supposed

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
possible and these diapers are supposed

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.580 
possible and these diapers are supposed
to<00:02:30.750> be<00:02:31.700> pretty<00:02:32.700> good<00:02:32.850> keeping<00:02:33.780> them<00:02:33.959> till<00:02:34.290> dry

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
to be pretty good keeping them till dry

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.569 
to be pretty good keeping them till dry
I<00:02:34.920> guess<00:02:35.310> I<00:02:35.549> don't<00:02:35.670> know<00:02:37.010> if<00:02:38.010> that<00:02:38.310> was<00:02:38.549> the

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:38.579 
I guess I don't know if that was the

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:41.240 
I guess I don't know if that was the
problem<00:02:39.150> and<00:02:39.329> then<00:02:39.660> the<00:02:39.690> seventh<00:02:40.200> item<00:02:40.440> was

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
problem and then the seventh item was

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.650 
problem and then the seventh item was
not<00:02:41.549> necessary<00:02:42.510> at<00:02:42.870> all<00:02:43.049> but<00:02:43.410> I<00:02:43.760> self<00:02:44.760> love

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
not necessary at all but I self love

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.410 
not necessary at all but I self love
mangoes<00:02:46.200> and

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
mangoes and

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:48.970 
mangoes and
and<00:02:47.659> so<00:02:47.780> I<00:02:47.810> thought<00:02:48.019> Abby<00:02:48.260> might<00:02:48.530> like<00:02:48.739> them

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
and so I thought Abby might like them

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.509 
and so I thought Abby might like them
too<00:02:49.219> and<00:02:49.640> then<00:02:49.849> the<00:02:49.969> last<00:02:50.209> item<00:02:50.870> that<00:02:50.900> was

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:51.519 
too and then the last item that was

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:54.670 
too and then the last item that was
Huggies<00:02:52.519> little<00:02:52.969> swimmers<00:02:53.450> and<00:02:54.139> Abby<00:02:54.409> has

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
Huggies little swimmers and Abby has

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.649 
Huggies little swimmers and Abby has
