00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:10.520
 or the life line of the advanced 

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:13.280
 this makeup that is to highlight the 

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:16.670
 brown eyes like mine is in shades 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:19.070
 golden and purple is very very beautiful 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:21.910
 and very easy to do as always if you 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.910
 you want to learn to read 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:28.010
 I'm going to start applying a test 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:29.840
 shadows this is the nick swisher or beige 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:33.280
 and it helps that the color of your shadow 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.280
 stand out and last all day 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:41.859
 now I will take a pencil and a 

00:00:39.429 --> 00:00:44.440
 purple shade and I'm going to delineate 

00:00:41.859 --> 00:00:46.559
 the whole basin friends as you can see it 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.559
 there 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:57.050
 I will take a small brush to apply shadows 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:59.660
 small and a golden pigment and I 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.340
 what is going to put it under the purple color is 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:04.270
 say about the almond of my eye and 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.270
 also in the lacrimal 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:13.579
 and I'm going to use a shadow to speak a 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:16.899
 little darker and put back from 

00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:16.899
 half of the eye out 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:28.140
 with the same purple shade retouch the 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.140
 line that we have done before 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.759
 I will take a brush to blend in 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:39.439
 angle and I'm going to blur this color from 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.439
 the socket of my eye towards my being 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:44.310
 let's border all the golden color 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.740
 but we are not going to mix them at all if 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:50.600
 they have to see a very important line 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.600
 and very precise between these two colors 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.280
 and blends the edges very well so that 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.940
 It looks very delicate and it does not look like 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.940
 a hit 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.310
 now let's outline I'm going to take a 

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:09.110
 gel eyeliner and let's draw a 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.379
 very thin line attached to the eyelashes 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.379
 higher 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.420
 this time I will not do any kind of 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.610
 tail is going to follow the natural way of 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:21.569
 my eye and I will also delineate the line 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.569
 of the water that is this 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.860
 let's enter the tabs and we're going to 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:36.960
 apply lash 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.000
 I'm going to define to separate very well each 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:41.820
 one of my eyelashes then do not apply 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.440
 the zig zag eyelash and I'm also going to 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:46.430
 Apply the lash on the lashes 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.430
 lower 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:55.170
 yes 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:57.440
 ready and this is all the work 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.390
 we have to do in the eyes 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.460
 I'm going to take a bronzer and a brush 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:03.440
 for dust and I'm going to apply a little 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:06.040
 on the face to give warmth to me 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.040
 complexion 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:12.019
 I will use a pink blush and I will 

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:14.410
 put on the apples of my face 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:15.900
 and then he took it back 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:17.849
 do not 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:21.650
 for the lips I will use a gloss 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:21.650
 natural like this 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:29.270
