duty<00:01:48.950> I<00:01:49.070> love<00:01:49.370> night<00:01:49.610> maps<00:01:49.970> and<00:01:50.180> it<00:01:50.240> seems<00:01:50.420> to

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570 
duty I love night maps and it seems to

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:51.700 
duty I love night maps and it seems to
me<00:01:50.690> that<00:01:50.720> this<00:01:50.990> is<00:01:51.110> going<00:01:51.260> to<00:01:51.320> be<00:01:51.410> somewhat

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:51.710 
me that this is going to be somewhat

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:53.710 
me that this is going to be somewhat
mid-range<00:01:52.310> because<00:01:52.730> there<00:01:52.880> is<00:01:53.030> snipers<00:01:53.510> in<00:01:53.540> a

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720 
mid-range because there is snipers in a

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.810 
mid-range because there is snipers in a
tower<00:01:53.960> so<00:01:54.230> it<00:01:54.650> looks<00:01:54.800> pretty<00:01:55.040> cool<00:01:55.160> the<00:01:55.520> next

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 
tower so it looks pretty cool the next

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.940 
tower so it looks pretty cool the next
map<00:01:55.940> is<00:01:56.120> called<00:01:56.420> stronghold<00:01:57.050> a<00:01:57.200> snowy<00:01:57.620> icy

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950

allowing for close quarters combat with
long-range<00:02:02.830> engagement<00:02:03.830> so<00:02:03.980> looks<00:02:04.190> like

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.220 
long-range engagement so looks like

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:05.950 
long-range engagement so looks like
there's<00:02:04.430> going<00:02:04.520> to<00:02:04.610> be<00:02:04.640> a<00:02:04.700> big<00:02:05.060> snowy<00:02:05.390> map<00:02:05.750> if

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
you remember back in black ops 2 there

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:09.580 
you remember back in black ops 2 there
was<00:02:08.060> a<00:02:08.090> map<00:02:08.300> called<00:02:08.509> downhill<00:02:09.080> which<00:02:09.259> was<00:02:09.410> set

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
was a map called downhill which was set

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:11.530 
was a map called downhill which was set
in<00:02:09.770> the<00:02:09.890> French<00:02:10.190> Alps<00:02:10.369> so<00:02:10.759> I'll<00:02:11.120> got<00:02:11.270> a<00:02:11.300> strong

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
in the French Alps so I'll got a strong

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:12.910 
in the French Alps so I'll got a strong
vibe<00:02:11.780> that's<00:02:11.990> going<00:02:12.170> to<00:02:12.230> be<00:02:12.290> somewhat<00:02:12.710> like

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
vibe that's going to be somewhat like

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.309 
vibe that's going to be somewhat like
downhill<00:02:13.280> the<00:02:13.700> next<00:02:13.970> thing<00:02:14.120> is<00:02:14.150> cold<00:02:14.600> relic

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:15.319 
downhill the next thing is cold relic

downhill the next thing is cold relic
which<00:02:15.769> is<00:02:15.890> battle<00:02:16.219> your<00:02:16.340> way<00:02:16.430> through<00:02:16.609> some

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
seems to me there's going to be some

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.030 
seems to me there's going to be some
typos<00:02:23.269> of<00:02:23.389> nights<00:02:23.689> of<00:02:23.900> the<00:02:24.019> museum<00:02:24.530> type<00:02:24.799> thing

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
are being created so it looks like this

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.009 
are being created so it looks like this
is<00:02:37.370> going<00:02:37.459> to<00:02:37.549> be<00:02:37.670> like<00:02:37.819> a<00:02:37.969> drone<00:02:38.359> type<00:02:38.659> of<00:02:38.810> map

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:39.019 
is going to be like a drone type of map

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:40.390 
is going to be like a drone type of map
from<00:02:39.200> black<00:02:39.439> ops<00:02:39.680> 2<00:02:39.920> i'm<00:02:40.040> kind<00:02:40.250> of<00:02:40.280> getting

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
from black ops 2 i'm kind of getting

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.039 
from black ops 2 i'm kind of getting
that<00:02:40.609> vibe<00:02:40.819> from<00:02:40.879> there<00:02:41.269> so<00:02:41.780> that's<00:02:41.900> going<00:02:41.989> to

00:02:42.039 --> 00:02:42.049 
that vibe from there so that's going to

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:43.990 
that vibe from there so that's going to
be<00:02:42.109> awesome<00:02:42.349> as<00:02:42.709> well<00:02:42.739> the<00:02:43.189> next<00:02:43.340> map<00:02:43.579> is<00:02:43.760> going

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
be awesome as well the next map is going

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.940 
be awesome as well the next map is going
to<00:02:44.090> be<00:02:44.209> a<00:02:44.239> map<00:02:44.480> called<00:02:44.719> overboard<00:02:45.319> it<00:02:45.499> says

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
to be a map called overboard it says

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.429 
to be a map called overboard it says
sinking<00:02:46.430> rapidly<00:02:46.700> a<00:02:47.060> large<00:02:47.510> oil<00:02:47.780> rig<00:02:48.109> allows

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:46.520 
which is also really interesting says

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.190 
which is also really interesting says
moon<00:04:46.820> from<00:04:47.030> college<00:04:47.360> duty<00:04:47.570> black<00:04:47.810> ops<00:04:47.840> 2

moon from college duty black ops 2

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.830 
moon from college duty black ops 2
zombies<00:04:48.230> are<00:04:49.100> also<00:04:49.370> in<00:04:49.730> talk<00:04:50.030> the<00:04:50.240> idea<00:04:50.600> is

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:50.840 
zombies are also in talk the idea is

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.080 
zombies are also in talk the idea is
that<00:04:50.870> a<00:04:51.110> space<00:04:51.530> map<00:04:51.830> in<00:04:52.070> multiplayer<00:04:52.610> would<00:04:52.940> be

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.090 
that a space map in multiplayer would be

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:55.300 
that a space map in multiplayer would be
nice<00:04:53.330> special<00:04:53.780> addition<00:04:54.230> to<00:04:54.800> the<00:04:54.920> default

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:55.310 
nice special addition to the default

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:57.340 
nice special addition to the default
maps<00:04:55.580> however<00:04:55.940> it's<00:04:56.030> likely<00:04:56.420> to<00:04:56.570> appears<00:04:56.900> DLC

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:57.350 
maps however it's likely to appears DLC

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:58.960 
maps however it's likely to appears DLC
so<00:04:57.500> the<00:04:57.620> moon<00:04:57.800> map<00:04:57.980> we<00:04:58.310> might<00:04:58.490> be<00:04:58.640> seeing<00:04:58.820> from

00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:58.970 
so the moon map we might be seeing from

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:00.670 
so the moon map we might be seeing from
black<00:04:59.270> ops<00:04:59.480> 1<00:04:59.750> zombies<00:05:00.110> not<00:05:00.230> sure<00:05:00.380> whites<00:05:00.530> as

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:00.680 
black ops 1 zombies not sure whites as

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:02.770 
black ops 1 zombies not sure whites as
black<00:05:00.860> ops<00:05:01.040> 2<00:05:01.250> so<00:05:01.910> we<00:05:02.060> could<00:05:02.240> be<00:05:02.390> seeing<00:05:02.600> it

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:02.780 
black ops 2 so we could be seeing it

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:04.960 
black ops 2 so we could be seeing it
somewhat<00:05:03.290> soon<00:05:03.620> maybe<00:05:04.160> in<00:05:04.340> black<00:05:04.490> ops<00:05:04.640> 3<00:05:04.730> i'm
