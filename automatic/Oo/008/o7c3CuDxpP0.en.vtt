00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:10.950
 Hello everyone, you have to play 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.490
 channel and today we look at this 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.740
 the game as a kinder gave a survival instinct 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:21.230
 release which was just recently a game 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:24.210
 came out on the playstation 3 and xbox 360 pics and 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:26.490
 the plot of the story is built on the same name 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.220
 television series which is not a little known 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.000
 especially in the west and is a prequel 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.910
 to him 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.790
 well, enough of the prefaces let's see 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.520
 already start the toy itself and in some 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.379
 gully with the learning process and I immediately 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.320
 drew attention to the fact that the game is very 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.660
 closed wall locations literally crushed 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.390
 by its narrowness of course with the development 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:51.149
 plot they get bigger but feeling 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.520
 the room had not gone yet but if 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.399
 the game is not localized and then disconnect 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:59.760
 subtitles learn English better I personally 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.350
 not satisfied with the period not 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.170
 the detainee is just stupid 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.540
 Those listen to me if my wife is a fool south 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.939
 just run away years from the first fight 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.460
 Zombies understand what to kill with the mouse 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:14.220
 melee is extremely uncomfortable understandable 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:17.460
 The game was made more by the 2nd and there to lead 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.500
 battle is much more interesting yet and that 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.840
 that we die at the hands of a zombie at the beginning 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.340
 games are plot twist don't get angry 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.770
 don't start over 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.479
 after all this gives us control 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.060
 the main character where i already drew 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.189
 attention to the graphics the game is quietly going 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.890
 at maximum speed with the included fraps and 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:37.110
 separately sound recording program from 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.689
 this we conclude that we are not playing 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.640
 krayzis 3 logical that load 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:44.310
 closed level with not quite fresh 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.939
 computer graphics semi-annual or even 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.500
 a year ago is not difficult 

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:51.780
 returning to the plot mate reports 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.240
 that you need to quickly dump and send 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.920
 look for us fuel for cars and in this and 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.530
 the whole gameplay begins 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.409
 gently roll in the sump killing them 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.060
 stealth mode and by the way there is a mode 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.219
 squatting 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.430
 find gasoline and quickly dump out 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:19.940
 this location is different and min 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:21.950
 up and here is the mega twist of the plot in 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.680
 which we are offered to choose by ourselves 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.810
 way to the next place of events and more 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.600
 You can get there in three ways. 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.880
 each of which has its drawbacks and 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:34.550
 advantages as an opportunity to receive 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:40.250
 another gas station but it will pay 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:42.230
 a certain amount of gasoline during 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.660
 second mission of our mission 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:47.000
 is also a search for fuel but 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.980
 agree a little more interesting here already 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.440
 we are in an abandoned building with a flashlight 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:54.080
 By the way, I never figured out the stock. 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:56.410
 zombies on the world like reacts not even 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.410
 I know 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:10.370
 another feature of the game mechanics 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:21.480
 glass in all machines armor-piercing and 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:24.150
 bulletproof and our hero grunting on 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:28.190
 alone can easily and naturally 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:28.190
 push a foreign car if necessary 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:42.960
 worth mentioning arsenal weapons yes he 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:45.030
 wide enough but out of the cold quickly 

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:47.760
 you get used to some one and already 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:50.010
 I do not want to change firearrow cool but 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.410
 use it also not yet 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:54.960
 wish for zombies die quietly from 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:56.910
 cold instead of first-aid kits by the way hero 

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:58.830
 uses a sports drink after drinking 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:00.950
 who relaxes in duke style 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:00.950
 nukema 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:08.100
 to distract the zombie game in stealth mode 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:10.709
 there are also glass bottles and 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:13.530
 fire and but they are frankly useless 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:15.780
 Now a zombie and a fight with three 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:18.090
 there are two already causing problems but 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:20.609
 just because the game really did on 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:22.890
 consoles still have scrum moments more often 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:25.440
 just arising from the discoveries of the next 

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:27.210
 the door where the zombies supposedly suddenly scares 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:29.340
 player and trying to bite 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:31.650
 fight takes place in the form of a short 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:34.440
 simple on on games where we are sure 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:36.720
 let's win spawn zombies on the map is not extremely 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:39.330
 logicable this is especially strange 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:42.030
 when I recall in the game the feeling of a closed 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:44.220
 rooms here we go barn zombies not 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:47.250
 it was going out of it there worth whole 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:48.960
 five walking from the air but 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:51.210
 It is worth noting that zombies are very 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:53.610
 varied and repetitive have time 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:55.830
 forget that you can not say about the characters with 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:58.130
 which we interact during 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:58.130
 games 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:10.440
 still striking behavior and simplicity 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:12.060
 dialogue of meeting people in a game like 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:14.520
 as if frankly don't care what's around 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:18.830
 zombie apocalypse and generally everything is ok come on 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:18.830
 I go to gasoline always live on 

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:36.449
 bright memorial finish my tank tank flippers script 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:38.880
 obviously does not create an atmosphere and so let us down 

00:05:36.449 --> 00:05:41.190
 totals in the game need 100 percent 

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:42.870
 play fans of the show they are exactly 

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:45.660
 will find something of their own in it 

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:49.139
 I'm like a zombie lover the horror of the apocalypse 

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:51.539
 games I wish and I will give the game a second chance and another 

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:54.000
 once I try to turn it on there maybe they donâ€™t 

00:05:51.539 --> 00:05:56.280
 there are interesting and still worth it 

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.710
 note that the atmosphere appears when 

00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:01.560
 you run out of sports patrons 

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:03.449
 drinks there is no dialogue will run your 

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:06.120
 zombie character like old grandfather 

00:06:03.449 --> 00:06:08.300
 bush every 30 meters after which 

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:10.979
 rejoice picking up a pack of ammo 

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:13.530
 I hope you liked it was a review from 

00:06:10.979 --> 00:06:17.539

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:17.539
