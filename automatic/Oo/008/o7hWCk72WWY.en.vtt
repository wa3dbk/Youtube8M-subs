00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
school kits one other question that we

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.430 
school kits one other question that we
get<00:00:38.250> sometimes<00:00:38.460> is<00:00:39.120> on<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.540> boxes<00:00:39.930> of<00:00:40.050> crayons

get sometimes is on the boxes of crayons
every<00:00:40.829> now<00:00:40.920> and<00:00:41.070> then<00:00:41.129> there's<00:00:41.370> a<00:00:41.430> tiny<00:00:41.790> tiny

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239

and<00:00:46.980> we<00:00:47.219> are<00:00:47.390> careful<00:00:48.390> about<00:00:48.750> having

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
and we are careful about having

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.029 
and we are careful about having
patriotic<00:00:50.129> symbols<00:00:50.579> on<00:00:50.969> our<00:00:51.510> kits<00:00:52.289> and<00:00:52.559> quilts

for safety of the folks who receive them

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.410 
for safety of the folks who receive them
so<00:00:55.559> it's<00:00:55.949> not<00:00:56.129> really<00:00:56.489> necessary<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:57.030> blacken

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
so it's not really necessary to blacken

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.959 
so it's not really necessary to blacken
this<00:00:57.600> out<00:00:57.809> this<00:00:58.079> is<00:00:58.140> not<00:00:58.820> significant<00:00:59.820> this

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
this out this is not significant this

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.090 
this out this is not significant this
just<00:01:00.239> shows<00:01:00.480> where<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:00.809> item<00:01:01.109> was<00:01:01.230> made<00:01:01.500> where

from<00:01:23.009> getting<00:01:23.189> broken<00:01:23.659> what<00:01:24.659> I<00:01:24.689> like<00:01:24.960> to<00:01:25.110> do<00:01:25.229> is

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
from getting broken what I like to do is

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.230 
from getting broken what I like to do is
stack<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.979> spirals<00:01:26.460> opposite<00:01:27.060> one<00:01:27.210> another

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
stack the spirals opposite one another

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.109 
stack the spirals opposite one another
so<00:01:28.140> that<00:01:28.170> they<00:01:29.130> don't<00:01:29.220> get<00:01:29.430> caught<00:01:29.759> together

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
so that they don't get caught together

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.890 
so that they don't get caught together
and<00:01:30.570> then<00:01:31.259> I<00:01:31.530> put<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:32.009> ruler<00:01:32.280> in<00:01:32.670> between<00:01:33.299> like

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
and then I put the ruler in between like

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.370 
and then I put the ruler in between like
this<00:01:34.140> so<00:01:34.950> that<00:01:34.979> it<00:01:35.220> won't<00:01:35.369> get<00:01:35.520> broken<00:01:35.759> in

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
this so that it won't get broken in

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
this so that it won't get broken in
transit<00:01:37.380> so<00:01:37.890> put<00:01:38.220> that<00:01:38.250> in<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.820> bag<00:01:39.000> first
