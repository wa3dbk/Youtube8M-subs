making the pieces to the puzzle is what

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.560 
making the pieces to the puzzle is what
we<00:01:51.620> end<00:01:51.740> up<00:01:51.860> doing<00:01:51.920> here<00:01:52.370> our<00:01:52.850> competition<00:01:53.450> is

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:56.660 
pretty easy to make them the way they

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:58.570 
pretty easy to make them the way they
work<00:01:56.870> it's<00:01:57.410> real<00:01:57.680> difficult<00:01:58.160> to<00:01:58.250> make<00:01:58.430> them

00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:58.580 
work it's real difficult to make them

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.630 
work it's real difficult to make them
