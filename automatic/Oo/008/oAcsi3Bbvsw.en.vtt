 better we put a coffee that falls on 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.620
 Sun or not I think it would be the most income 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:52.800

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.899

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.820
 happening from my incredible never seen 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:01.660

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.159
 It makes a lot of war as always 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:28.280
 Thu 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.280
 we do not have food right now 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.370
 As for your fence you know guys the 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.909
 technique of always 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:39.330
 although also 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:43.340
 we could opt for the option 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:43.340
 of surprise do not shit 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.200

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:59.200
 and why not my mother boy habilitate 

00:01:53.799 --> 00:02:01.799
 as just because this is already being a 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:05.890
 little tram I'm left alone I say here 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:07.719
 maybe we're not going there we're going there 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.910
 let's see what we can do is 

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:11.980
 being part a bit strange but I 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.170
 I think we can beat the comic of 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.640
 wood to all possible guys my sword 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:19.239
 of wood is capable of anything goes 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.590
 these other children that I think I have 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:22.120
 super jump and like I do not have it 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.700
 a second track of guys that 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:27.720

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.720

 Give me game guys, play me 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:36.180
 it's not over the game is over 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:53.160
 here is the destination chest 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:56.230
 so since we have it we take advantage 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.490
 they take what I get around here a 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.610
 really fucking but today since I 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:02.590
 I always look at the positive part of 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:04.090
 things always look the part 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.980
 positive guy tomorrow to remember the 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:07.750
 trapdoor is not even open to see for 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.750

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:14.790
 It seems incredible how you want me to sky 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:14.790
 true war 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:33.579
 it seems that it is already 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:35.849
 but little things that kill me from a small 

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:35.849
 problem 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:40.830
 to see 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:40.830
 OK 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:48.910

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:51.200
 to know we're going to catch these little things 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:54.980
 let's go up here we are five and 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:57.950
 now this is being greater than zero and 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:04:00.670
 let's go for the next one I say ok 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:00.670
 the next 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:06.150
 right here I do not have a boat nor do I have 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:07.880
 nothing but nothing like the same as not 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:11.720
 there is a problem 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:14.140
 there is no problem really the problem of 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:14.140
 today 

00:04:20.819 --> 00:04:23.910
 why 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:41.259
 I was playing well 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:45.400
 I was playing well 

00:04:41.259 --> 00:04:49.160
 from another time it's there in the background 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:51.620
 from the fellow escalerite that made me 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:53.849
 here a woman to for the companion of 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:58.110
 there 

00:04:53.849 --> 00:05:00.689
 it's worth it and he's going to be happy for life and 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:02.009
 he does not know what is coming is they know what 

00:05:00.689 --> 00:05:04.050
 that is coming yes yes yes yes they had everything 

00:05:02.009 --> 00:05:05.699
 come out so that I had a girl throw you 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:08.459
 all the arcane that you want, sir 

00:05:05.699 --> 00:05:10.930

00:05:08.459 --> 00:05:12.759
 honey with a lot of love 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:14.889
 With a lot of love, my friend, look at times 

00:05:12.759 --> 00:05:18.080
 for the snow on your face 

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:19.759
 a bÃ©ticos a eye 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:22.270
 because the uncle that was not going to 

00:05:19.759 --> 00:05:22.270
 I know that 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:27.449
 so what does that do that makes 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:29.600
 do the motive of the skill but what 

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:29.600

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:36.120
 so it makes that way 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:39.390
 but being this park or 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:40.710
