of<00:01:49.880> breaking<00:01:50.030> out<00:01:50.299> right<00:01:50.479> now<00:01:50.720> only<00:01:50.990> because

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
of breaking out right now only because

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.859 
of breaking out right now only because
of<00:01:51.700> hormone<00:01:52.700> changes<00:01:53.119> and<00:01:53.360> stuff<00:01:53.450> I<00:01:53.659> think

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:53.869 
of hormone changes and stuff I think

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:55.569

think it's a perfect color for kinda

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:27.130 
think it's a perfect color for kinda
like<00:04:25.970> an<00:04:26.060> everyday<00:04:26.300> look<00:04:26.570> if<00:04:26.720> you<00:04:26.810> want<00:04:27.020> some

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:27.140 
like an everyday look if you want some

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:28.750 
like an everyday look if you want some
color<00:04:27.410> added<00:04:27.740> to<00:04:27.860> your<00:04:27.980> lips<00:04:28.160> but<00:04:28.370> you<00:04:28.490> don't

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:28.760 
color added to your lips but you don't

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:30.500 
want your lips to be overly bright I

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.470 
want your lips to be overly bright I
think<00:04:30.980> it's<00:04:31.100> a<00:04:31.160> very<00:04:31.250> complementing<00:04:32.000> pink<00:04:32.330> it

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:32.480 
think it's a very complementing pink it

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.960 
think it's a very complementing pink it
looks<00:04:32.630> good<00:04:32.930> if<00:04:33.290> you<00:04:33.350> can<00:04:34.040> pull<00:04:34.220> it<00:04:34.340> off<00:04:34.460> as<00:04:34.730> an

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:34.970 
looks good if you can pull it off as an

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:37.390 
looks good if you can pull it off as an
everyday<00:04:35.120> lip<00:04:36.020> but<00:04:36.740> at<00:04:36.800> the<00:04:36.890> same<00:04:37.070> time<00:04:37.220> it's

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400 
everyday lip but at the same time it's

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.550 
everyday lip but at the same time it's
very<00:04:37.460> moisturizing<00:04:37.910> it's<00:04:38.690> it's<00:04:39.050> like<00:04:39.169> a<00:04:39.290> bomb

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:39.560 
very moisturizing it's it's like a bomb

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:42.460 
very moisturizing it's it's like a bomb
consistency<00:04:40.550> so<00:04:40.880> that's<00:04:41.870> what<00:04:42.020> I<00:04:42.080> really<00:04:42.320> like

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:42.470 
consistency so that's what I really like

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:44.620 
consistency so that's what I really like
about<00:04:42.500> that<00:04:42.980> and<00:04:43.280> just<00:04:43.790> feels<00:04:44.060> gone<00:04:44.270> your<00:04:44.419> lips

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:44.630 
about that and just feels gone your lips

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:45.790 
about that and just feels gone your lips
so<00:04:44.810> it's<00:04:45.050> kind<00:04:45.200> of<00:04:45.230> like<00:04:45.350> a<00:04:45.410> mixture<00:04:45.710> between
