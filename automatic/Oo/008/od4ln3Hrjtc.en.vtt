00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:18.360
 welcome this is cooking step to 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.900
 step today I will show how to prepare 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:26.810
 some easy cream cookies or cream 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.810
 milk and how are these ingredients 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:34.149
 and if you do not like coconut you can also 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:36.309
 to be made with cream only me here 

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:39.430
 I will use a special cream to 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:41.680
 Asturian brand pastry that has made me 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:44.650
 come in box and enjoy box of this 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:49.089
 month as you know how good we enjoy is a 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:50.500
 monthly distribution box and I'm going to 

00:00:49.089 --> 00:00:53.470
 leave here in the video description 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:57.130
 a promotional code to order 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:01:02.320
 he enjoys box and now he 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:04.830
 to start you have to measure the cream 250 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.830
 milliliters 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:12.180
 you have to separate two egg yolks 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:14.900
 we can do so with the system of 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.250
 bottle they can search between videos 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:20.570
 very easy system to separate the 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.570
 yolk whites 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:32.230
 and now then in a container 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:32.230
 you have to mix the cream with the sugar 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.470
 the two egg yolks 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.560
 we mix the flour right now 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:48.650
 it's a very easy recipe here is 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:52.250
 important when we are mixing 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:55.100
 always turn to the same side like this 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:59.440
 this way the lumps will not be made 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.440
 of flour balls that sometimes remain 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:15.910
 and now that we have it well mixed 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:18.550
 you have to add the grated coconut as 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:21.790
 I used to say earlier if you do not like coconut 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:24.600
 can do so only with cream or 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.600
 milk cream 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.110
 and good now below 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:43.390
 we have the mass ready I will place 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.060
 in a pastry bag to shape 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:49.690
 so it's going to be easier to do the 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:52.930
 cookies and they will all be the same and 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:57.570
 beautiful in a baking dish with 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.570
 vegetable paper so they do not stick 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:07.560
 you have to cook them until they are 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:09.540
 golden brown about 15 to 20 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:13.129
 minutes 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.129
 and looking at it so they do not burn 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:23.030
 here I am using an electric oven 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:27.170
 so heat up and down 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:29.690
 and 180 degrees and we will have ready the 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:32.360
 cream and coconut cookies already know if they 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:35.440

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.440

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.709
