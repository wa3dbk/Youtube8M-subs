 handle 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.679
 I am a Christian from Milan 

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:33.030
 of the family company having cousin 

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:34.739
 andrea my father and my uncle we raise 260 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.410
 heads of dairy cows in a company 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:40.860
 which covers an area of ​​100 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:43.980
 hectares about our activity started 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.510
 in 1937 and the milk we produce comes 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.300
 intended for the production of grain 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.530
 Padano a few months ago we decided to 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.269
 renew our plant 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.280
 milking because we were starting to have 

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:55.829
 problems in terms of yield and quality 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.720
 of the interventions productions of 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.309
 extraordinary maintenance was now 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:01.290
 on the agenda 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.239
 we opted for the proposed solution 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:04.850
 from mick klein because it seemed to us 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.229
 the only one able to combine technology 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.659
 and efficiency at a cost of 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.880
 klein ha adequate investment 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.110
 designed and built the plant on 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.780
 based on our needs 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.790
 we had limited space but thanks to milk 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.979
 line we could increase the number 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.470
 total milking places without having to 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.060
 intervene on the stable structure 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.740
 assembly operations have been 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.939
 fast and in the meantime they have us 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.580
 installed but milking parlor 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:32.040
 provisional to ensure continuity 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:34.920
 our activity today we have a room of 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:37.500
 reading parallel to 14 plus 14 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.270
 too many mil system maybe integrated 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.820
 we have also equipped each animal with 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.620
 collar ruminate between identification the 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.130
 calories detection of the activity 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:46.130
 renal 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.640
 Yup 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:20.510
 we chose milk line because it was in 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:22.549
 able to provide us with any kind of 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.889
 equipment just think of mine 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:27.349
 perhaps an innovative system of 

00:02:24.889 --> 00:02:29.030
 milking makes single quarter since 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:31.489
 we use this system we have 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.560
 significantly reduced cases of mastitis 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:34.849
 in our animals with an immediate 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.530
 economic saving 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:38.599
 the milking system for single 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.819
 fourth and life in case of tour ruler 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:43.370
 and therefore the welfare of our animals 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:44.780
 guaranteed as well as the quality of the 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.060
 our productions 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:50.239
 we also decided to combine with 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:52.189
 micro and I were the migri a handle of 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:55.030
 new generation that facilitates us in 

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:55.030
 milking operations 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:15.370
 more klein has also installed a new one 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:17.439
 vacuum system with inverter thanks to the 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.450
 which through a continuous regulation 

00:03:17.439 --> 00:03:21.670
 of speed from the pump the consumption of 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:23.560
 electricity is optimized 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:26.049
 guaranteeing at the same time a level of 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.519
 empty constant graziani the clan 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:29.650
 we have total control of the 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:32.019
 milking and herd management 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:34.599
 all the systems the claim is integrated 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:36.459
 with nikon hn software that allows us to 

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:39.480
 have all the data in real time 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:39.480
 animals on the farm 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:45.560
 at the end of each milking check i 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:47.870
 more salient data or production 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.790
 of milk the animals in heat such as 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:52.130
 abnormal combination and alarms of 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:54.200
 conductivity this allows me to 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:56.600
 optimize fertility and prevent 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.640
 any health problems 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:00.830
 in case of need we are joined by 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:03.620
 qualified technical service staff 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:05.480
 assistance room is excellent 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:06.830
 milan milking is perfect for ours 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:08.510
 needs 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:10.780
 we are very satisfied with the choice that 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:10.780
 we have done
