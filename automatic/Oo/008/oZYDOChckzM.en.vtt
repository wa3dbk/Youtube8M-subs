really<00:02:24.050> but<00:02:24.460> unless<00:02:25.460> there's<00:02:25.700> nothing<00:02:26.030> down

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
really but unless there's nothing down

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.870 
really but unless there's nothing down
here<00:02:26.210> but<00:02:26.720> it<00:02:27.320> looks<00:02:27.530> like<00:02:27.680> there<00:02:27.860> is<00:02:28.120> whoa<00:02:29.800> oh

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
here but it looks like there is whoa oh

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.560 
here but it looks like there is whoa oh
this<00:02:31.880> is<00:02:32.000> like<00:02:32.120> is<00:02:32.390> this<00:02:32.660> oh<00:02:32.840> yes<00:02:33.530> I<00:02:34.270> think<00:02:35.270> this

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:35.570 
this is like is this oh yes I think this

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:36.850 
this is like is this oh yes I think this
is<00:02:35.630> like<00:02:35.840> the<00:02:35.900> room<00:02:36.170> where<00:02:36.290> they<00:02:36.410> hold<00:02:36.650> off

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
is like the room where they hold off

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.300 
is like the room where they hold off
maybe<00:02:38.110> and<00:02:39.110> the<00:02:39.260> troll<00:02:39.530> comes<00:02:39.770> in<00:02:39.950> and<00:02:40.100> this<00:02:40.190> is

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
maybe and the troll comes in and this is

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.810 
maybe and the troll comes in and this is
where<00:02:40.430> the<00:02:40.520> book<00:02:40.670> is<00:02:40.790> I'm<00:02:41.060> probably<00:02:41.420> wrong<00:02:41.780> but

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:42.820 
where the book is I'm probably wrong but

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:45.250 
where the book is I'm probably wrong but
yes<00:02:43.820> I'm<00:02:44.090> digging<00:02:44.390> it<00:02:44.510> oh<00:02:44.600> yeah<00:02:44.870> and<00:02:45.080> then

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
yes I'm digging it oh yeah and then

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.200 
yes I'm digging it oh yeah and then
that's<00:02:45.710> probably<00:02:45.950> the<00:02:46.310> well<00:02:46.640> or<00:02:46.910> whatever

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:47.210 
that's probably the well or whatever

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:50.460 
that's probably the well or whatever
that<00:02:47.510> Pippin<00:02:47.960> knocks<00:02:48.830> the<00:02:49.070> thing<00:02:49.280> down<00:02:49.430> maybe

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
that Pippin knocks the thing down maybe

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:54.810 
that Pippin knocks the thing down maybe
maybe<00:02:51.610> maybe

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:54.820 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:03:01.990 

now<00:02:55.820> what<00:02:58.600> yeah<00:03:00.340> well<00:03:01.340> there's<00:03:01.550> a<00:03:01.610> lot<00:03:01.820> bigger

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
now what yeah well there's a lot bigger

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.660 
now what yeah well there's a lot bigger
than<00:03:02.090> I<00:03:02.300> thought

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
than I thought

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.070 
than I thought
now<00:03:04.670> it's<00:03:04.850> just<00:03:04.970> like<00:03:05.090> if<00:03:05.300> you<00:03:05.390> go<00:03:05.510> down<00:03:05.750> under

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080 
now it's just like if you go down under

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.470 
now it's just like if you go down under
well<00:03:06.530> that<00:03:06.770> that's<00:03:07.130> it<00:03:07.280> you<00:03:07.700> know<00:03:07.820> what<00:03:07.850> if<00:03:08.390> you

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480
