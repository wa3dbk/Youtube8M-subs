works<00:00:55.910> this<00:00:56.910> is<00:00:57.090> pretty<00:00:57.300> basic

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
works this is pretty basic

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.049 
works this is pretty basic
straightforward<00:00:58.260> method<00:00:58.879> you're<00:00:59.879> going<00:01:00.000> to

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
straightforward method you're going to

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.270 
straightforward method you're going to
put<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.300> mail<00:01:00.480> in<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.750> first<00:01:01.020> day<00:01:01.230> and<00:01:02.160> let

put the mail in the first day and let

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.910 
put the mail in the first day and let
them<00:01:02.399> just<00:01:02.520> kind<00:01:02.730> of<00:01:02.760> get<00:01:02.910> used<00:01:02.940> to<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.329> tank

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 
them just kind of get used to the tank

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.679 
them just kind of get used to the tank
the<00:01:04.920> second<00:01:05.339> d<00:01:05.460> put<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:05.880> female<00:01:06.270> in<00:01:06.450> with<00:01:06.659> a

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
the second d put the female in with a

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.219 
the second d put the female in with a
like<00:01:06.869> a<00:01:06.900> lava<00:01:07.200> lamp<00:01:07.409> a<00:01:07.920> lot<00:01:08.610> of<00:01:08.640> glass<00:01:09.630> vase

like a lava lamp a lot of glass vase
it's<00:01:11.220> on<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.580> bottom<00:01:11.939> and<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.180> top<00:01:12.210> or<00:01:12.600> you

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
it's on the bottom and the top or you

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.050 
it's on the bottom and the top or you
can<00:01:12.869> use<00:01:12.900> a<00:01:13.020> regular<00:01:13.260> vase<00:01:14.040> that's<00:01:14.430> you<00:01:14.939> know

can use a regular vase that's you know

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.109 
can use a regular vase that's you know
closed<00:01:15.479> on<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:15.720> bottom<00:01:15.990> and<00:01:16.080> open<00:01:16.530> on<00:01:16.619> top<00:01:17.119> the

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
closed on the bottom and open on top the

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.630 
closed on the bottom and open on top the
lava<00:01:18.409> kind<00:01:19.409> of<00:01:19.500> allow<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:19.710> lamp<00:01:20.070> one<00:01:20.310> works<00:01:20.520> a

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
lava kind of allow the lamp one works a

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:21.679 
lava kind of allow the lamp one works a
little<00:01:20.729> bit<00:01:20.880> better<00:01:21.000> because<00:01:21.240> you<00:01:21.540> can<00:01:21.570> just

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
little bit better because you can just

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:22.999 
little bit better because you can just
pull<00:01:21.990> it<00:01:22.080> straight<00:01:22.229> out<00:01:22.439> and<00:01:22.799> you're<00:01:22.920> not

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
pull it straight out and you're not

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.050 
pull it straight out and you're not
going<00:01:23.189> to<00:01:23.310> create<00:01:23.460> a<00:01:23.549> current<00:01:23.909> that<00:01:24.000> can

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
going to create a current that can

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.679 
going to create a current that can
actually<00:01:24.270> ruin<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:24.750> nest<00:01:24.990> for<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.439> mail<00:01:26.689> when

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
actually ruin the nest for the mail when

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.380 
actually ruin the nest for the mail when
you<00:01:28.020> use<00:01:28.259> a<00:01:28.340> the<00:01:29.340> non<00:01:29.549> you<00:01:30.000> know<00:01:30.090> just<00:01:30.270> regular

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
you use a the non you know just regular

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.179 
you use a the non you know just regular
face<00:01:30.840> when<00:01:31.350> you<00:01:31.409> dump<00:01:31.650> it<00:01:31.770> out<00:01:31.890> it<00:01:32.070> could

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
face when you dump it out it could

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:33.590 
face when you dump it out it could
actually<00:01:32.369> disrupt<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:32.970> bubbles<00:01:33.299> and<00:01:33.450> break

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
actually disrupt the bubbles and break

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.200 
actually disrupt the bubbles and break
up<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.810> nest<00:01:34.110> for<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.380> mail<00:01:34.939> with<00:01:35.939> this

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
up the nest for the mail with this

because if you do feed them they kind of

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.560 
because if you do feed them they kind of
create<00:01:42.659> egg<00:01:42.810> eaters<00:01:43.350> a<00:01:43.619> little<00:01:44.009> bit<00:01:44.299> and<00:01:45.299> after

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
create egg eaters a little bit and after

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.600 
create egg eaters a little bit and after
that<00:01:45.600> we<00:01:45.869> can<00:01:45.899> do<00:01:46.409> is<00:01:46.590> after<00:01:46.920> you<00:01:47.250> introduce

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
that we can do is after you introduce

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.010 
that we can do is after you introduce
the<00:01:47.790> female<00:01:48.210> you<00:01:48.299> just<00:01:48.479> kind<00:01:48.659> of<00:01:48.689> let<00:01:48.810> nature

take its course you know the best way to
tell<00:01:52.590> if<00:01:52.710> a<00:01:52.770> females<00:01:53.189> ready<00:01:53.430> she<00:01:53.850> will<00:01:54.030> have

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
tell if a females ready she will have

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.719 
tell if a females ready she will have
vertical<00:01:55.140> bars<00:01:55.439> going<00:01:55.710> up<00:01:55.860> and<00:01:56.009> down<00:01:56.100> usually

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
vertical bars going up and down usually

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.870 
vertical bars going up and down usually
between<00:01:56.850> three<00:01:57.329> to<00:01:57.360> five<00:01:58.070> Cs<00:01:59.070> horizontal<00:01:59.700> bars

between three to five Cs horizontal bars

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.639 
between three to five Cs horizontal bars
going<00:02:00.149> across<00:02:00.450> her<00:02:00.780> then<00:02:01.049> she's<00:02:01.290> definitely

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
going across her then she's definitely

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.130 
going across her then she's definitely
not<00:02:01.680> ready<00:02:01.920> to<00:02:02.070> breed<00:02:02.450> and<00:02:03.450> another<00:02:03.810> way<00:02:03.990> if

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
not ready to breed and another way if

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.840 
not ready to breed and another way if
you<00:02:04.229> can't<00:02:04.500> see<00:02:04.710> any<00:02:04.860> bars<00:02:05.070> like<00:02:05.399> if<00:02:05.520> you<00:02:05.640> have

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
you can't see any bars like if you have

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.369 
you can't see any bars like if you have
a<00:02:05.880> white<00:02:06.509> female<00:02:06.750> if<00:02:07.310> the<00:02:08.479> Hat<00:02:09.479> is<00:02:09.660> face<00:02:10.050> lower
