 earn gold right now everyone 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.950
 Hello Marakasi with you today I wanted 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.980
 would show you a good tank fight 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:20.039
 stb-1 on the steppe map player from the very beginning 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.350
 The battlefield is sent to Zelenka, so usually 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.830
 call this direction though 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:29.099
 green there is not very much and fails 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:32.430
 cause damage to object 140 here 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.860
 too much also he substituted to 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:38.910
 comes here from 3 more 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:41.430
 and our hero weighs him a pillow 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.660
 Basically the place is very good especially 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.870
 if not 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.379
 arts that in the current randomness honestly 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.809
 by saying 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.660
 rare I do not even remember 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:55.590
 in general, of course, randomly favors 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:58.770
 the player doesnâ€™t look much 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:01.649
 he has two serious opponents 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:05.010
 10 levels in this fight four nines 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:07.979
 many eights and below two ltshki 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.140
 seventh level in general, I do not know what 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:13.080
 the player made him so lucky 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:16.200
 honestly i'm into such fights almost 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:20.400
 never get maybe there times in 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:24.030
 a thousand years if I offer sacrifices 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:27.930
 I can choose there and it will happen 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:31.350
 sure the player is very much well zadonatil 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:34.110
 or do not know him just wildly lucky them 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.479
 Essentially he could win there million 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.840
 dollars but instead he is just 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:43.710
 got into this fight but also quite well 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.390
 since at least he can relax and 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.810
 cause a lot of damage 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:51.030
 IS-3 is trying to tank this tank 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:53.340
 stb-1 little by little to disassemble it 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.070
 shells do not understand why IS-3 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.740
 exposes his board if he is after 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.570
 how does it go do not go no 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:04.350
 shoots just snaps off 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:08.369
 and generally managed to destroy it from below 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:10.170
 actively milks opponents and stb-1 decides 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:13.230
 help your allies 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:16.080
 here of course shoot with strands on 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:19.080
 and stitches are not the best idea 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.690
 less you can try to play here from 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:25.440
 terrain and somehow to tank 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.280
 the towers besides the gun at stb-1 is pretty 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.930
 punching 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.709
 and very much for receptionists it is possible to break through e75 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.770
 towers 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:38.010
 but the second shell has already landed in ld and 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:41.670
 There certainly could not punch the top 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:43.980
 attacks object 140 and of course you need it 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:46.530
 eliminate so that it does not interfere and not 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.769
 understood the allies but 3 foursome with 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:52.200
 it does a great job 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:53.880
 what is left is two even opponents m103 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.790
 and e75 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:03:00.120
 Of course you need to quickly disassemble them 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:03.120
 And uzhend not and go further in attack 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:05.930
 apparently on the other flank all very 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.110
 bad and allies there as always 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:11.640
 streamed 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:14.640
 note that manages to handle and stb-1 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:18.570
 returns wearing his base there like 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:22.019
 just arrived and stream which destroys 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:25.560
 ally too who was on IS-3 and 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:28.200
 stb-1 also gets it yet 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:32.160
 pretty calm but at the end I promise 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:35.579
 you very vigorous batch and so STB-1 rides 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:38.640
 closer to its base and in the distance appears 

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:42.540
 object 704 grabs the rendering distance 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:45.480
 to see him and stb-1 of course not 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:48.450
 refuses to fool him , but who else 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:51.570
 can refuse when there is such 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:55.019
 A victim that can be shot in 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:59.310
 the board and manages to pick it up appears 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:04:00.959
 another adversary kv-4 and he too 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:04.920
 sent vanguard the truth of it 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:07.040
 to gather ally but that's okay still 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:10.950
 full of enemies that they can 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:14.880
 to sell and of course allies left 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:18.320
 not much t-34 is-3 and super-duper 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:21.470
 Tanchik with an obscure name 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:25.250
 AUG sponsor Panthers boast or anything 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:27.140
 like stb-1 decides to wait for the light 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:30.170
 and lit up ahead 

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:33.650
 from 3 issued true march him to board 

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:37.280
 well, and the allies for some reason went ahead and 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:39.950
 in the end they split up and they start 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:43.190
 attack opponents of course chances 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:45.980
 there are no allies here they are parsing 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:48.680
 first bursting arch and then 3 

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:53.120
 just ripped them to shreds and 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:56.710
 remains stb-1 along with panther haul 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:59.600
 this fight fails to break through IS-7 and 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:02.330
 trying our heroes about home 

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:03.860
 in nld here he just puts him 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:06.830
 manages to inflict on him 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:08.570
 320 damage but shoot from afar 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:10.810
 opponents because our hero 

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:14.330
 is on the cross her need from here 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:17.870
 leave otherwise you can lose all your 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:21.020
 strength appears st-1 fails 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:24.170
 punch him under such tilt enemies 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:26.720
 just surrounded our japanese shoot 

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:29.990
 on him from different sides but still he 

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:32.360
 resists destroys st-1 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:33.650
 highlights IS-3 quickly over them 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:37.540
 shoot out of 3 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:39.140
 smears in on stb-1 goes on it and 

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:43.310
 picks up from 3 

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:47.050
 Well, they leave here and 7 rather pulls up 

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:50.600
 close but not yet substituted and 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:53.030
 he is apparently waiting for his allies with you 

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:55.610
 one you understand what you need to leave here 

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:58.400
 in general, need to do something about it because 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:06:01.430
 stand now is not an option but then decided 

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:04.580
 go on the attack not family stb-1 bites him 

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:05.300
 and 7 is repaired and staples one again his 

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:08.960
 bead 

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:11.390
 and already from 7 nothing can be done 

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:16.120
 he has plenty of time to fix and 

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:18.050
 stb-1 just parses it without problems and 

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:21.620
 destroys in the end 

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:25.370
 leaves 3 and of course he punches 

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:28.280
 of our cardboard Japanese but stb-1 too 

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:32.030
 punches is-3 puts him on a harp and 

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:36.129
 correctly twists him shot him 

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:39.879
 in the stern and successfully ignite the stream further 

00:06:36.129 --> 00:06:43.009
 getting him two more opponents left 

00:06:39.879 --> 00:06:45.650
 t-34 and royal tiger 

00:06:43.009 --> 00:06:46.639
 the american leave shoots punches 

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:50.000
 our hero 

00:06:46.639 --> 00:06:51.080
 stb-1 is shot at it leaves 

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.259
 also kt 

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:57.110
 our hero chooses a3 cat four 

00:06:54.259 --> 00:06:59.240
 breaks through stb-1 further our hero 

00:06:57.110 --> 00:07:02.509
 trying to spin kt shoots him 

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:05.419
 on the move , kt is trying to turn with 

00:07:02.509 --> 00:07:08.569
 you one drives off back and just 

00:07:05.419 --> 00:07:11.479
 ridiculous smears stb-1 destroys it 

00:07:08.569 --> 00:07:14.270
 and wins this fight let's see 

00:07:11.479 --> 00:07:17.030
