00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.150
 99 Welcome to the game Borussia 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:08.309
 dortmund against the hamburger sv 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.230
 yes, what can we do with the game today? 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.900
 expect us to do so first 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.370
 look how it orders for the teams 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.990
 is dortmund is after this winter break 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.640
 as strong as ever 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.170
 because they put in relation to the first 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.580
 three back and games 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.519
 the best start to the club's history 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.960
 Doubling up has the best 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.240
 offensive of the bundesliga at least 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.429
 so far in 2013 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.320
 because she already has eleven goals 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.600
 shot the bvb plays home today 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.040
 and that means one for the hsv 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.530
 big disadvantage of when we last 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.960
 13 away game from hsv considered 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.700
 they could win only two of them and 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.829
 that against the so-called cellar children 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:48.149
 namely against greuther forth with a 1 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:51.329
 0 and against augsburg with a 2 0 in 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:54.690
 the round was the HSV with 3 to 2 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:57.510
 win against dortmund and had with it 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.359
 a series finishes his style 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.879
 the second longest of the bundesliga 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.920
 history is because dortmund had against 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:09.240
 the hamburger sv a very long series 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.979
 namely 31 unbeaten games before 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.409
 So we go to the gates and highlights 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.240
 the question come to you what do you believe 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.220
 how will the game end today? 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.259
 you think the hsv has a chance against 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.380
 borussia dortmund or becomes dortmund 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:24.090
 his great success so far 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.420
 continue this second half 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.860
 can 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.259
 just write in the 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.060
 comments and yes we still see here 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.780
 briefly the exhibition and dortmund 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.460
 and of course now again from 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:38.880
 the hamburger sv and we want too 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:41.490
 then the same time come to impetus yes the 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.590
 Partie ran just two minutes and 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.640
 already there was a free kick for hamburg 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.640
 in your own half 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:52.120
 now resting on left 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:56.020
 rudniks again on the outside a seventh 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:57.490
 space is still playing in the middle off after 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.640
 on the front van der vaart full ride on 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:04.930
 Master and make the gate in the fifth 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:06.430
 minute for the hamburger sv so early 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.840
 already a goal that wants there 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:11.440
 Of course, do not let yourself sit down 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.730
 not five minutes later comes here 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.390
 attack a misspile of the 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:18.580
 defense laskowski now in the 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.120
 middle seventh place at idol götze on 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.680
 bender 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:26.760
 if you prefer during the day to 1 1 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:29.709
 yes as fast as five minutes and 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:32.050
 Already the world is looking very different again 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:34.330
 it was somehow balanced out 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:35.980
 to be expected that top and not there 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.950
 will push in the back now 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:42.700
 here again a possibility for the HSV 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:44.820
 22 minute flank purely rudniks but the 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:48.030
 is equal defused first 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:51.040
 lewandowski equality on god bender 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.709
 lewandowski exceedingly make a good one 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.450
 game 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:57.400
 laskowski can prevail 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.739
 pulled a little pulled jersey but the 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.910
 Referee says advantage 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:03.760
 laskowski does not know exactly how to get in 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:07.390
 should play and there are throw are like that 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:10.049
 it looks more often but one is throwing now 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:10.049
 here for the hsv 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.180
 can then be pushed back again 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:21.640
 then there is space dortmund plays on 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:24.400
 götze blasczykowski now on the outside 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:26.500
 lewandowski yes there is space 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:30.790
 blasczykowski on the outside again picek 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:36.120
 clever flank in and out is that 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:38.319
 thing blaszczykowski in the 29 minute 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.459
 tell the hit the 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:42.099
 decisive hits why 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:43.120
 we will see that again decisively 

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:45.430
 a few minutes later 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:48.879
 four minutes later in the 33rd 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.620
 minute light over the outside, yes, too 

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:52.599
 bender 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:54.790
 if you 're gonna shoot 

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:56.799
 deflected and outputs a corner 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:58.180
 then they do not make us that way 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:00.819
 are already in the meantime 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:03.040
 second half and hamburg tried it 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:05.290
 continue 75010 minute is his 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.299
 failing to do so consistently enough 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:10.810
 they are consistent as they were before 

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:12.430
 also beyond the whole game 75 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:14.560
 minute now here you can try it 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:16.150
 with an entry that comes out quite well 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:19.470
 but the defense of dortmund 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:21.260
 Do not sleep here now 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:23.090
 Dortmund 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.650
 we see there so potash tried too 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:27.140
 Shooting does not apply 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:28.720
 This situation has become hummels 

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:32.510
 hurt and philippe center comes for it 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:34.880
 turns off if that was worth it 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:36.980
 i definitely not anymore 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:40.070
 a lot has happened, the game is over 

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:42.380
 from two to one and has been 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:45.050
 decided after 29 minutes 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:46.730
 hence the decisive factor 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:48.590
 Do you believe the question again? 

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:50.150
 when the game ends , just write 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:52.960
 in the comments and see you then 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:52.960
 in the next forecast
