00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
inside we move the other modular

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.870 
inside we move the other modular
buildings<00:02:11.019> into<00:02:11.380> the<00:02:11.470> background<00:02:12.069> and<00:02:12.310> what

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
buildings into the background and what

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.880 
buildings into the background and what
we<00:02:13.030> decided<00:02:13.510> to<00:02:13.690> do<00:02:13.990> with<00:02:14.170> the<00:02:14.260> ice<00:02:14.410> cream<00:02:14.860> shop

was to use

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.720 
was to use
LEGO<00:02:17.240> pieces<00:02:17.390> that<00:02:18.230> are<00:02:18.380> not<00:02:18.770> very<00:02:19.190> common

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
LEGO pieces that are not very common

LEGO pieces that are not very common
which<00:02:20.210> in<00:02:20.420> this<00:02:20.600> case<00:02:20.660> are<00:02:21.230> the<00:02:21.350> light<00:02:21.620> blue

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980
