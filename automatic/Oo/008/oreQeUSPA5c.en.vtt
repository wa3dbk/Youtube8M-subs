00:00:00.759 --> 00:00:05.660
 Ali who is 23 hours or alcohol prohibition with new today will not be there 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:09.510
 twelve more days on the calendar which means that we have arrived and day 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.420
 12 from the hill black ops 2 today we have a pretty nice one 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:17.500
 Topics include the first Turkish Football Building Fair in general 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:18.669
 any call or duty 

00:00:18.669 --> 00:00:22.399
 has taken place at a time so far that the club verbally and know that costs 

00:00:22.399 --> 00:00:23.159
 them again 

00:00:23.159 --> 00:00:26.339
 as the first program but I immediately got you in without doubt 

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:27.710
 do you have flex check 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:32.219
 leaves is actually exactly the same as all previous calf child's is one 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:33.320
 nice wark 3 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.370
 tomorrow three injuries on but there was two splash too that he has one 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:39.739
 complex process wells was an experiment 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:43.800
 but now you have the drawbar spurt it is exactly the same as in black ops 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.940
 a ball except for a thing 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:47.899
 if she has released on 8 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:50.960
 then the end is put new flu but yes that you are not that super much 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.280
 later a real approaching goat 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.440
 I am not sure if it is, it is all speculation, but it is 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:58.710
 it's not all known 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.860
 but I assume they don't put it in as the second room we chose 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:04.460
 sure you have no question at all 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:09.400
 they chose completely changed before the old master camper spoke behind 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.729
 of all times they actually have a sort of for us program 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:16.350
 I think that thinking differently will also use and not be scared 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.690
 let him just let's first explain what exactly chose means 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:22.590
 dost is actually just six and in fashion marchÃ© 3 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.460
 on top of a thing s changed a thing and that is that if you are not in 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.920
 movement is that you can just be seen on the windows 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.770
 And this actually ensures the train because the boxes are ideal 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.710
 acquired rus 6 who know know who want to be and therefore i am sure i 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:38.160
 looked with very annoying 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:39.430
 that on 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:42.390
 if you're just racing i'm setting up a lot and then 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.100
 they get a level 3 fm judge and i see if your new vi 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.140
 in the past someone arrives, I just lie down on my stomach and 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.150
 and that was a nuisance 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:55.460
 and that's why we usually use sex symbol becomes 3 and then i go too 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.960
 probably just chose to use two in black ops because it 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.080
 just a real plus point is made instead of a camper I know it sounds 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.390
 quite controversial but i think they have the bad name of ghost and them 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.130
 wanted to adjust by 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:08.389
 call the rwandan 

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:12.799
 I already hear your height question experienced how can you still asked 

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:16.769
 continue to be just an ordinary killstreaks that can be done with the turk mcclaren 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:20.679
 after a few days to get animals exactly the same as the mill market 3 it is business 

00:02:20.679 --> 00:02:24.199
 that is now also in the same team, the shack did not both demolish them at the same time 

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:28.559
 will hear less often from jaap lagerweij 6 in those who miss that eleventh 

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:31.679
 gratitude chose of course because the black ops is 2 

00:02:31.679 --> 00:02:34.439
 that little sentence on those two plates behind each other is becoming less common 

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:38.739
 encountering no sense because it is simply on behalf of there can therefore be a possibility 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:40.880
 becomes a walk art by name 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.230
 but then again you have to spend an extra point and I now had it in the 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.389
 had a few questions about the previous episode 

00:02:46.389 --> 00:02:49.389
 if you were still wearing it just have questions about the subject in it 

00:02:49.389 --> 00:02:53.009
 generally bolat place and telecom and the chances for the next day 

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:54.379
 answer the next day 

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:56.169
 on the tape was just in the comments 

00:02:56.169 --> 00:02:59.489
 shares of standard ten points that was the question always start with ten 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:02.689
 points you have out of ten points you can't make them less you can't do them either 

00:03:02.689 --> 00:03:04.930
 making more everyone suffers from thirteen points 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:06.379
 even from apple for one 

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:09.569
 a number of highly pro cantibus jobs at the front therefore makes sure just like one 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:12.819
 nice wark three that sets you up against all killstreaks 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:14.480
 some very limited 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:15.560
 you have hard line 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.830
 but small has been adjusted setting up previously purchased duplicity thing is still 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:21.990
 of course it was always with ideas 

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:24.479
 with which I very fresh with less on 

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:28.079
 with what less could do that they have also done the fair or 

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:30.969
 duty's it was just all your killstreaks and a point earlier but it was 

00:03:30.969 --> 00:03:32.120
 of course a bit false 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.690
 because if you like that if you only have young animals the emo was 3 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:39.100
 that was just a third of those guys you had to get less and if 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:40.969
 you just did that in 

00:03:40.969 --> 00:03:43.919
 if you apply the whole the same principle to a man on 

00:03:43.919 --> 00:03:47.849
 a 25th and less talent on 4 May is of course not fair 

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:51.249
 they have now just done a standard percentage, I think on Monday 

00:03:51.249 --> 00:03:55.789
 out of five 62 so that you have to get less and therefore happy because 

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:58.719
 I always looked at a few punk boxes because it always was 

00:03:58.719 --> 00:04:00.210
 none for the higher streaks 

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:03.379
 and before that was just completely worthless 

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:07.220
 as the last burke of the council let a puzzle factual know 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:11.100
 let know exactly the same as a black ops forever went full in the ns and then 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:12.689
 just sprint faster 

00:04:12.689 --> 00:04:16.820
 that was a bit where the stock market i am so big a caravan east and draw 

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:20.079
 Loud know how to use including chose most because just chose really one 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:21.779
 recipe has become burg 

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:24.199
 fletcher card for as year on a breath 

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:28.949
 on an exciting people doing this is in denmark residential area and spots and the 

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:30.490
 emmy's just needy 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:33.889
 and we leave it if you are just entitled to a very small one that costs 

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:37.259
 makes little sense because no one nasser apartheid because she calls the market image 

00:04:37.259 --> 00:04:39.020
 have to see what goes on every second 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:41.449
 there were not being said as a trainer 

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:44.990
 after which a little more in my opinion on the stock market got into me 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:47.860
 but I have received a lot of smoke that I remain this team 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.970
 considering I always thought of the year will be standard citizens 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:55.010
 which boundlessly annoyed us but it looks like it is from there 

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:57.230
 one that Bekkerzeel is the right way and one 

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:59.759
 to give in this second life and for that too 

00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:04.340
 last weekend were incredibly well received in five sets by the German 

00:05:04.339 --> 00:05:05.860
 it is so that on 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:08.150
 about the last time that is because there 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:11.600
 This is an offer to make the afternoon was in that sense there is also attention 

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.150
 the one that gave him this weekend 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:16.150
 A large part of the data center is located on the east coast of America 

00:05:17.009 --> 00:05:19.580
 and of course everything is processed in it and you can understand that 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:22.619
 a whole visit is running when a supercomputers are turned off 

00:05:22.619 --> 00:05:23.120
 flow 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:26.620
 the employer must be dry for a while and that is there that no just awful 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:30.620
 lots of motivation and a little bit in the next episode of guests for later
