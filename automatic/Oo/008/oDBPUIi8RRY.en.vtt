that it's the best representation of

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.679 
that it's the best representation of
knapford<00:02:59.010> station<00:02:59.310> that<00:03:00.090> there<00:03:00.239> ever<00:03:00.389> has

00:03:00.679 --> 00:03:00.689 
knapford station that there ever has

00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:02.960 
knapford station that there ever has
been<00:03:00.720> and<00:03:01.079> probably<00:03:01.400> that<00:03:02.400> there<00:03:02.519> ever<00:03:02.669> will

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
been and probably that there ever will

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.899 
been and probably that there ever will
be<00:03:03.109> however<00:03:04.109> I<00:03:04.439> only<00:03:04.859> downside<00:03:05.549> to<00:03:05.700> that<00:03:05.730> is

00:03:05.899 --> 00:03:05.909 
be however I only downside to that is

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:08.990 
be however I only downside to that is
that<00:03:06.120> it's<00:03:06.450> only<00:03:06.659> two<00:03:07.019> platforms<00:03:07.609> you<00:03:08.609> can<00:03:08.790> but

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
that it's only two platforms you can but

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.300 
that it's only two platforms you can but
