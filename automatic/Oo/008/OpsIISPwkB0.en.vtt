00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:09.920
 hello to everyone as i promised today i 

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:12.410
 tell you and show you the difference 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:16.280
 between the original varnish about films 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:19.910
 rooms and crafts I already showed you 

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:23.500
 This is how the original varnish does not look like 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:27.609
 only horses write but the butterfly is here and 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:32.300
 that the forest is also on someone who writes horses 

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:38.420
 advertises it as a stamping varnish 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:42.910
 but I 'll just check it out for now. 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:47.629
 practice and so drawing I have already chosen 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:50.270
 I take the original varnish first 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:56.739
 I as quickly as possible because the varnishes 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:56.739
 dry quickly take a hook 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:11.470
 about strain 1 it on the handle like this 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:21.700
 put it looks so well naturally 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:26.720
 drawing about black quickly dried up 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:30.650
 almost could not and now not for nothing 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:37.810
 original varnish was looking like you 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:37.810
 acts even need to say goodbye quickly 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.740
 varnish 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:02:01.210
 scraper stamp on the nose here so we 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:06.360
 the result I have more time lacquer 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:12.280
 left in the figure smaller numbers to 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:17.110
 left on the nails to you here I put 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:20.230
 drawing this already talk about what lacquer 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:24.790
 not an original escape but more than an hour 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:32.250
 left not only here but in fact 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:35.170
 drawing is very bad 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:38.580
 interrupted and 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:43.209
 You already have such a result 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:47.380
 if you can see the whole picture 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:50.640
 but rather lacquer stayed here even 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:52.870
 nothing will break through 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:56.140
