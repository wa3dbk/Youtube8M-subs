relate<00:03:25.480> to<00:03:25.540> and<00:03:25.930> I<00:03:25.960> think<00:03:26.230> that<00:03:26.470> that's<00:03:26.680> a

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:26.860 
relate to and I think that that's a

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:29.400 
relate to and I think that that's a
testament<00:03:27.550> to<00:03:27.580> Paul<00:03:27.850> is<00:03:28.150> writing<00:03:28.360> I<00:03:28.660> hope<00:03:29.200> the

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:35.770 
but also I hope that it makes them think

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:38.160

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.350 
from the play and to think about in your
own<00:03:41.740> life<00:03:42.010> so<00:03:42.040> I<00:03:42.430> hope<00:03:42.580> you<00:03:42.760> believe<00:03:42.910> with<00:03:43.180> that

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:43.360 
own life so I hope you believe with that

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.330 
own life so I hope you believe with that
I<00:03:43.600> think<00:03:44.020> I<00:03:44.110> really<00:03:44.350> respond<00:03:44.740> to<00:03:44.830> the<00:03:44.950> material

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
I think I really respond to the material

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.310 
I think I really respond to the material
in<00:03:45.430> particular<00:03:45.910> because<00:03:46.150> I<00:03:46.420> wasn't<00:03:47.230> just

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:47.320 
in particular because I wasn't just

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.830 
in particular because I wasn't just
going<00:03:47.470> to<00:03:47.590> the<00:03:47.710> theater<00:03:48.070> to<00:03:48.340> see<00:03:48.640> a<00:03:48.910> story<00:03:49.390> that

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 
going to the theater to see a story that

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.300 
going to the theater to see a story that
I<00:03:49.870> liked<00:03:50.260> I<00:03:50.560> was<00:03:50.710> seeing<00:03:50.890> a<00:03:50.950> story<00:03:51.160> that<00:03:51.280> I

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
I liked I was seeing a story that I

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:52.740 
I liked I was seeing a story that I
liked<00:03:51.520> and<00:03:51.670> I<00:03:51.760> could<00:03:51.940> also<00:03:52.090> really<00:03:52.480> relate<00:03:52.720> to

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 
liked and I could also really relate to

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.890 
liked and I could also really relate to
in<00:03:53.020> my<00:03:53.110> own<00:03:53.230> life<00:03:53.440> so<00:03:54.310> for<00:03:54.820> four<00:03:55.540> people<00:03:55.660> I'm

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 
in my own life so for four people I'm

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.990 
in my own life so for four people I'm
thirty-five<00:03:56.350> so<00:03:56.800> four<00:03:57.310> people<00:03:57.550> in<00:03:57.670> that<00:03:57.790> age

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
thirty-five so four people in that age

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.810 
thirty-five so four people in that age
range<00:03:58.030> I<00:03:58.510> think<00:03:58.540> it<00:03:58.840> adds<00:03:59.320> an<00:03:59.530> extra<00:03:59.950> bit<00:04:00.790> of

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:00.820 
range I think it adds an extra bit of

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:01.860 
range I think it adds an extra bit of
something<00:04:01.420> that<00:04:01.570> it<00:04:01.660> isn't<00:04:01.840> just

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870 
something that it isn't just

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:03.120 
something that it isn't just
entertaining<00:04:02.530> it's<00:04:02.680> something<00:04:02.950> that'll

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:03.130 
entertaining it's something that'll

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:04.980 
entertaining it's something that'll
really<00:04:03.220> speak<00:04:03.580> to<00:04:03.610> you<00:04:03.790> I<00:04:04.000> think<00:04:04.390> that's<00:04:04.660> true

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:04.990 
really speak to you I think that's true

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:06.900 
really speak to you I think that's true
art<00:04:05.290> is<00:04:05.530> whenever<00:04:05.770> you<00:04:06.160> go<00:04:06.280> to<00:04:06.340> see<00:04:06.520> something

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:06.910 
art is whenever you go to see something

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:08.160 
art is whenever you go to see something
and<00:04:07.060> you<00:04:07.120> leave<00:04:07.450> and<00:04:07.600> you're<00:04:07.720> talking<00:04:08.080> about

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.170 
and you leave and you're talking about

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:10.170 
and you leave and you're talking about
it<00:04:08.410> maybe<00:04:08.590> for<00:04:08.950> you<00:04:09.430> know<00:04:09.520> hours<00:04:09.880> or<00:04:10.030> days

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 
it maybe for you know hours or days

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.480 
it maybe for you know hours or days
later<00:04:10.530> it<00:04:11.530> definitely<00:04:11.950> leaves<00:04:12.190> an<00:04:12.370> impression

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:12.490 
later it definitely leaves an impression

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:15.870 
later it definitely leaves an impression
and<00:04:13.300> I<00:04:13.959> think<00:04:14.340> that's<00:04:15.340> reason<00:04:15.640> to<00:04:15.730> see

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:15.880 
and I think that's reason to see

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:19.440 
and I think that's reason to see
anything<00:04:16.239> I<00:04:16.620> get<00:04:17.620> it<00:04:17.769> this<00:04:18.580> is<00:04:18.730> an<00:04:18.850> actually<00:04:19.330> or
