grandeur of the waterfall McCullers of

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.339 
grandeur of the waterfall McCullers of
it<00:00:13.680> was<00:00:14.040> absolutely<00:00:14.849> incredible<00:00:14.970> I<00:00:15.599> feel<00:00:16.170> like

it was absolutely incredible I feel like

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:20.180 
it was absolutely incredible I feel like
you<00:00:16.680> can<00:00:16.950> really<00:00:17.430> only<00:00:17.880> study<00:00:18.390> biology<00:00:18.980> in<00:00:19.980> a

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:20.190 
you can really only study biology in a

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:22.760 
you can really only study biology in a
lab<00:00:20.369> we<00:00:20.970> have<00:00:21.119> to<00:00:21.270> get<00:00:21.480> out<00:00:21.660> and<00:00:21.869> see<00:00:22.440> it<00:00:22.590> and

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:22.770 
lab we have to get out and see it and

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:25.340 
lab we have to get out and see it and
touch<00:00:23.310> it<00:00:23.369> and<00:00:23.580> in<00:00:24.570> VN<00:00:24.840> it's<00:00:25.020> really

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
touch it and in VN it's really

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.769 
touch it and in VN it's really
understand<00:00:25.949> what<00:00:26.340> life<00:00:26.640> is<00:00:26.850> about<00:00:26.880> I<00:00:27.480> think

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
understand what life is about I think

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.080 
understand what life is about I think
it's<00:00:27.900> a<00:00:27.960> great<00:00:28.140> opportunity<00:00:28.289> and<00:00:29.039> I<00:00:29.130> would<00:00:30.000> do

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
it's a great opportunity and I would do

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:39.290 
it's a great opportunity and I would do
it<00:00:30.150> again<00:00:30.240> a<00:00:30.630> heartbeat<00:00:36.710> it's<00:00:37.710> just<00:00:38.129> like<00:00:38.300> so

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
it again a heartbeat it's just like so

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.090 
it again a heartbeat it's just like so
incredible<00:00:40.170> on<00:00:40.260> you<00:00:40.320> i<00:00:40.409> can't<00:00:40.769> believe<00:00:41.070> that

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
incredible on you i can't believe that

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.850 
incredible on you i can't believe that
like<00:00:41.570> this<00:00:42.570> is<00:00:42.720> a<00:00:42.750> place<00:00:43.019> you<00:00:43.049> actually<00:00:43.680> get<00:00:43.830> to

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
like this is a place you actually get to

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.920 
like this is a place you actually get to
go<00:00:44.159> your<00:00:44.580> life<00:00:44.820> like<00:00:45.290> like<00:00:46.290> how<00:00:46.500> lucky<00:00:47.040> is<00:00:47.280> that

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:47.930 
go your life like like how lucky is that

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:50.560 
go your life like like how lucky is that
there's<00:00:48.930> a<00:00:49.080> very<00:00:49.320> few<00:00:49.530> passes<00:00:49.920> out<00:00:50.040> of<00:00:50.070> that

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:50.570 
there's a very few passes out of that

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:54.170 
there's a very few passes out of that
change<00:00:51.570> how<00:00:52.019> you<00:00:52.080> learn<00:00:53.040> how<00:00:53.549> you<00:00:53.610> study<00:00:53.970> and

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
change how you learn how you study and

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.219 
change how you learn how you study and
how<00:00:54.330> you<00:00:54.390> think<00:00:55.820> as<00:00:56.820> a<00:00:56.879> student<00:00:57.330> and<00:00:57.600> I<00:00:57.989> think

00:00:58.219 --> 00:00:58.229 
how you think as a student and I think

00:00:58.229 --> 00:00:59.990 
how you think as a student and I think
frequently<00:00:58.979> it's<00:00:59.190> more<00:00:59.400> about<00:00:59.489> learning<00:00:59.820> it

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
frequently it's more about learning it

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.380 
frequently it's more about learning it
to<00:01:00.119> spitting<00:01:00.420> it<00:01:00.510> out<00:01:01.250> or<00:01:02.250> learning<00:01:03.119> it<00:01:03.299> and

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
to spitting it out or learning it and

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.289 
to spitting it out or learning it and
using<00:01:03.720> it<00:01:03.780> later<00:01:03.989> but<00:01:04.440> I<00:01:04.970> learned<00:01:05.970> more<00:01:06.270> about

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
using it later but I learned more about

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.560 
using it later but I learned more about
myself<00:01:06.479> as<00:01:07.080> a<00:01:07.680> scientist<00:01:08.369> and<00:01:08.490> an<00:01:08.579> artist<00:01:08.939> then

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
myself as a scientist and an artist then

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:16.910 
myself as a scientist and an artist then
I<00:01:09.930> think<00:01:10.200> I<00:01:10.289> ever<00:01:10.500> have<00:01:10.740> in<00:01:10.770> my<00:01:10.979> life

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.609 

for<00:01:17.920> I<00:01:18.189> think<00:01:19.079> ninety-seven<00:01:20.079> percent<00:01:20.110> of<00:01:20.500> us

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:20.619 
for I think ninety-seven percent of us

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:23.310 
for I think ninety-seven percent of us
coming<00:01:20.979> to<00:01:21.460> die<00:01:22.270> on<00:01:22.420> coming<00:01:22.990> to<00:01:23.049> South<00:01:23.229> America

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:23.320 
coming to die on coming to South America

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.069 
coming to die on coming to South America
and<00:01:23.680> doing<00:01:24.009> this<00:01:24.159> type<00:01:24.399> of<00:01:24.430> work<00:01:24.579> is<00:01:25.000> very<00:01:25.750> new

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:26.079 
and doing this type of work is very new

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:28.950 
and doing this type of work is very new
and<00:01:26.380> to<00:01:27.189> experience<00:01:27.789> that<00:01:28.240> with<00:01:28.420> a<00:01:28.570> group<00:01:28.869> of

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:28.960 
and to experience that with a group of

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.499 
and to experience that with a group of
people<00:01:29.380> I<00:01:29.590> don't<00:01:29.890> think<00:01:29.950> anything<00:01:30.579> could<00:01:30.939> can

00:01:31.499 --> 00:01:31.509 
people I don't think anything could can

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:34.789 
people I don't think anything could can
bring<00:01:31.719> you<00:01:31.840> closer<00:01:32.110> in<00:01:32.590> something<00:01:32.950> like<00:01:33.100> that

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
bring you closer in something like that

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.639 
bring you closer in something like that
let<00:01:35.799> me<00:01:35.890> let's<00:01:36.310> take<00:01:36.460> a<00:01:36.520> look<00:01:36.759> so<00:01:37.229> and<00:01:38.229> that's

00:01:38.639 --> 00:01:38.649 
let me let's take a look so and that's

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:40.649 
let me let's take a look so and that's
the<00:01:38.950> beauty<00:01:39.340> of<00:01:39.610> appliance<00:01:40.270> in<00:01:40.420> the<00:01:40.479> night

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:40.659 
the beauty of appliance in the night

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:43.169 
the beauty of appliance in the night
dance<00:01:40.960> the<00:01:41.079> biology<00:01:41.619> is<00:01:42.490> all<00:01:42.700> of<00:01:42.789> a<00:01:42.850> sudden

00:01:43.169 --> 00:01:43.179 
dance the biology is all of a sudden

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:46.319 
dance the biology is all of a sudden
like<00:01:43.420> you<00:01:44.170> realize<00:01:44.560> the<00:01:44.799> kind<00:01:45.340> of<00:01:45.429> tension<00:01:45.759> and

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:46.329 
like you realize the kind of tension and

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:48.949 
like you realize the kind of tension and
the<00:01:46.420> horses<00:01:46.810> and<00:01:47.259> that<00:01:47.439> and<00:01:47.710> the<00:01:48.039> physics<00:01:48.549> that

00:01:48.949 --> 00:01:48.959 
the horses and that and the physics that

00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:52.080 
the horses and that and the physics that
you<00:01:49.959> know<00:01:50.110> it<00:01:50.920> is<00:01:51.039> required<00:01:51.369> for<00:01:51.789> certain

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 
you know it is required for certain

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.029 
you know it is required for certain
biological<00:01:52.299> relationship<00:01:52.869> to<00:01:53.409> happen<00:01:53.799> and

00:01:54.029 --> 00:01:54.039 
biological relationship to happen and

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:57.330 
biological relationship to happen and
you<00:01:54.280> get<00:01:54.459> to<00:01:54.549> do<00:01:54.700> it<00:01:54.789> yourself<00:01:55.979> this<00:01:56.979> is<00:01:57.159> your

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
you get to do it yourself this is your

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.089 
you get to do it yourself this is your
first<00:01:57.450> catfish<00:01:58.450> and<00:01:59.020> you<00:01:59.200> got<00:01:59.409> a<00:01:59.439> really<00:01:59.709> good

00:02:00.089 --> 00:02:00.099 
first catfish and you got a really good

00:02:00.099 --> 00:02:04.080 
first catfish and you got a really good
one<00:02:01.679> what<00:02:02.679> I<00:02:02.709> did<00:02:03.009> learn<00:02:03.220> I<00:02:03.640> think<00:02:04.000> I'll

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
one what I did learn I think I'll

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.260 
one what I did learn I think I'll
remember<00:02:04.569> for<00:02:05.080> a<00:02:05.140> lot<00:02:05.319> longer<00:02:05.530> because<00:02:05.920> I

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
remember for a lot longer because I

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:15.420 
remember for a lot longer because I
interacted<00:02:13.170> being<00:02:14.170> in<00:02:14.319> Diana's<00:02:14.860> is<00:02:15.040> made<00:02:15.220> me

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
interacted being in Diana's is made me

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:16.809 
interacted being in Diana's is made me
learn<00:02:15.760> and

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819 
learn and

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:20.040 
learn and
think<00:02:17.420> about<00:02:17.599> things<00:02:18.099> on<00:02:19.099> a<00:02:19.159> completely

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
think about things on a completely

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.440 
think about things on a completely
everything<00:02:20.980> not<00:02:21.190> just<00:02:21.220> climate<00:02:21.880> change<00:02:22.210> not

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
everything not just climate change not

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.330 
everything not just climate change not
just<00:02:22.480> global<00:02:22.930> warming<00:02:23.230> and<00:02:23.350> not<00:02:23.500> just<00:02:23.770> the

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
just global warming and not just the

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.640 
just global warming and not just the
continuum<00:02:24.850> between<00:02:25.540> art<00:02:25.930> and<00:02:25.960> science<00:02:26.200> but

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
continuum between art and science but

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.220 
continuum between art and science but
everything<00:02:27.340> I<00:02:27.550> would<00:02:28.030> do<00:02:28.210> this<00:02:28.390> again<00:02:28.900> that's

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
everything I would do this again that's

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:42.930 
everything I would do this again that's
my<00:02:29.410> personal<00:02:29.890> statement<00:02:30.160> without<00:02:30.550> a<00:02:30.790> doubt
