the<00:00:26.970> middle<00:00:27.240> I<00:00:27.390> just<00:00:27.750> think<00:00:27.869> it's<00:00:28.080> really<00:00:28.230> cute

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
the middle I just think it's really cute

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:29.929 
the middle I just think it's really cute
I<00:00:28.710> mean<00:00:28.890> obviously<00:00:29.010> I<00:00:29.279> wouldn't<00:00:29.519> wear<00:00:29.699> it<00:00:29.760> with

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
I mean obviously I wouldn't wear it with

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.370 
I mean obviously I wouldn't wear it with
this<00:00:30.119> but<00:00:30.390> if<00:00:30.689> I<00:00:30.840> was<00:00:30.960> wearing<00:00:31.080> it<00:00:31.289> with

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
this but if I was wearing it with

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.270 
this but if I was wearing it with
something<00:00:31.619> either<00:00:32.070> navy<00:00:33.000> or<00:00:33.300> cream<00:00:34.110> or

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.280 
something either navy or cream or

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.190 
something either navy or cream or
anything<00:00:35.280> really<00:00:36.090> plain<00:00:36.480> I<00:00:36.510> think<00:00:36.930> this<00:00:37.050> would

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
anything really plain I think this would

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.299 
anything really plain I think this would
look<00:00:37.230> really<00:00:37.530> nice<00:00:37.739> and<00:00:37.920> I<00:00:37.980> think<00:00:38.160> it<00:00:38.219> just

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
look really nice and I think it just

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.340 
look really nice and I think it just
adds<00:00:38.520> to<00:00:38.700> it<00:00:38.910> I<00:00:39.120> have<00:00:39.510> a<00:00:39.540> feeling<00:00:39.750> that<00:00:39.930> this<00:00:40.140> is

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
adds to it I have a feeling that this is

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.380 
adds to it I have a feeling that this is
only<00:00:40.500> about<00:00:40.739> two<00:00:41.129> or<00:00:41.309> three<00:00:41.520> pounds<00:00:41.700> and<00:00:42.120> for

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
only about two or three pounds and for

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.479 
only about two or three pounds and for
that<00:00:42.420> really<00:00:42.870> you<00:00:43.020> can't<00:00:43.260> say<00:00:43.440> no<00:00:43.620> I<00:00:43.860> have<00:00:44.309> got

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
that really you can't say no I have got

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.580 
that really you can't say no I have got
quite<00:00:44.670> a<00:00:44.700> few<00:00:44.850> necklaces<00:00:45.360> and<00:00:45.660> I<00:00:46.260> know<00:00:46.379> I

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
quite a few necklaces and I know I

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:47.840 
quite a few necklaces and I know I
shouldn't<00:00:47.039> really<00:00:47.160> be<00:00:47.280> adding<00:00:47.670> to<00:00:47.760> my

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
shouldn't really be adding to my

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.130 
shouldn't really be adding to my
collection<00:00:47.879> but<00:00:48.360> I<00:00:48.539> just<00:00:48.780> thought<00:00:48.899> this<00:00:49.079> was

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
collection but I just thought this was

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.590 
collection but I just thought this was
really<00:00:49.469> sweet<00:00:49.710> so<00:00:49.920> I<00:00:49.950> wanted<00:00:50.280> to<00:00:50.340> get<00:00:50.550> it<00:00:50.700> the

really sweet so I wanted to get it the
next<00:00:51.870> thing<00:00:51.960> I<00:00:52.110> got<00:00:52.350> there<00:00:52.649> is<00:00:52.739> maybe<00:00:53.039> a<00:00:53.219> little

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
next thing I got there is maybe a little

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.250 
next thing I got there is maybe a little
bit<00:00:53.579> of<00:00:53.699> an<00:00:53.789> unusual<00:00:53.940> thing<00:00:54.510> to<00:00:54.570> buy<00:00:54.870> and<00:00:55.170> we

to carry around low different charges so

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:23.990 
to carry around low different charges so
that<00:01:22.920> we<00:01:23.009> can<00:01:23.159> charge<00:01:23.369> a<00:01:23.490> different<00:01:23.820> phones

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
that we can charge a different phones

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.179 
that we can charge a different phones
and<00:01:24.299> this<00:01:24.810> one<00:01:25.049> has<00:01:25.350> got<00:01:25.530> three<00:01:25.830> different

wear<00:03:00.350> so<00:03:00.560> many<00:03:00.680> dresses<00:03:00.980> for<00:03:01.370> work<00:03:01.550> and<00:03:01.940> I<00:03:02.000> just

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:02.270 
wear so many dresses for work and I just

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:04.330 
wear so many dresses for work and I just
find<00:03:02.510> that<00:03:02.690> it's<00:03:02.960> a<00:03:03.020> bit<00:03:03.200> of<00:03:03.290> a<00:03:03.350> nightmare<00:03:03.590> when

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
find that it's a bit of a nightmare when

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.640 
find that it's a bit of a nightmare when
I<00:03:04.640> am<00:03:05.240> wearing<00:03:05.600> sort<00:03:05.870> of<00:03:05.930> a<00:03:05.960> tight<00:03:06.200> dress<00:03:06.380> or

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
I am wearing sort of a tight dress or

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:08.110 
I am wearing sort of a tight dress or
something<00:03:06.740> if<00:03:07.070> you<00:03:07.250> have<00:03:07.430> really<00:03:07.970> really

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
something if you have really really

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.870 
something if you have really really
obvious<00:03:08.750> panty<00:03:09.680> line<00:03:09.830> I'm<00:03:10.130> not<00:03:10.430> a<00:03:10.490> fan<00:03:10.700> of<00:03:10.730> that

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:10.880 
obvious panty line I'm not a fan of that

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.790 
obvious panty line I'm not a fan of that
so<00:03:11.420> I<00:03:11.450> decided<00:03:11.810> that<00:03:12.050> each<00:03:12.260> pair<00:03:12.560> of<00:03:12.650> these

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:12.800 
so I decided that each pair of these

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.710 
so I decided that each pair of these
knickers<00:03:13.040> would<00:03:13.280> be<00:03:13.400> so<00:03:13.610> good<00:03:13.850> because<00:03:14.120> they

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
knickers would be so good because they

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.030 
knickers would be so good because they
are<00:03:14.900> really<00:03:15.170> really<00:03:15.380> thin<00:03:15.650> and<00:03:15.680> they<00:03:15.920> are

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
are really really thin and they are

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.530 
are really really thin and they are
really<00:03:16.190> lightweight<00:03:16.460> and<00:03:17.030> it<00:03:17.150> just<00:03:17.390> means

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
really lightweight and it just means

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:18.820 
really lightweight and it just means
that<00:03:17.660> hopefully<00:03:18.080> it<00:03:18.230> won't<00:03:18.380> show<00:03:18.560> up<00:03:18.620> through

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:18.830 
that hopefully it won't show up through

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:21.040 
that hopefully it won't show up through
my<00:03:18.860> dresses<00:03:19.280> so<00:03:19.880> like<00:03:20.060> I<00:03:20.090> said<00:03:20.240> each<00:03:20.750> one<00:03:21.020> of

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:21.050 
my dresses so like I said each one of

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:23.410 
my dresses so like I said each one of

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620 
quite good especially considering i've

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:29.140 
quite good especially considering i've
had<00:03:27.800> a<00:03:27.830> few<00:03:27.890> pair<00:03:28.190> of<00:03:28.280> these<00:03:28.370> in<00:03:28.550> the<00:03:28.640> past<00:03:28.850> and

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 
had a few pair of these in the past and

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:30.850 
had a few pair of these in the past and
they<00:03:29.330> have<00:03:29.510> lasted<00:03:29.960> really<00:03:30.260> really<00:03:30.440> well<00:03:30.590> i

00:04:52.759 --> 00:04:55.270 
got a really really great zip on the
