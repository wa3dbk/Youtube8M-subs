00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.230 
show you how I did it both designing it
and<00:00:11.250> actually<00:00:11.639> returning<00:00:12.330> it<00:00:12.420> on<00:00:13.820> the<00:00:14.820> design

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
and actually returning it on the design

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.060 
and actually returning it on the design
I<00:00:15.269> want<00:00:15.540> to<00:00:15.570> make<00:00:15.809> here<00:00:16.109> is<00:00:16.320> for<00:00:16.590> a<00:00:16.619> 4-inch

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
I want to make here is for a 4-inch

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.790 
I want to make here is for a 4-inch
block<00:00:17.430> so<00:00:18.150> I've<00:00:18.480> drawn<00:00:18.810> myself<00:00:19.170> out<00:00:19.320> a<00:00:19.350> 4<00:00:19.650> inch

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
block so I've drawn myself out a 4 inch

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.340 
block so I've drawn myself out a 4 inch
square<00:00:20.160> and<00:00:20.400> I've<00:00:20.580> marked<00:00:20.939> the<00:00:21.150> center<00:00:21.630> now

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
square and I've marked the center now

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.849 
square and I've marked the center now
what<00:00:22.650> I'm<00:00:22.830> going<00:00:23.010> to<00:00:23.100> do<00:00:23.340> are<00:00:24.289> flower<00:00:25.289> petals

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
what I'm going to do are flower petals

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.040 
what I'm going to do are flower petals
which<00:00:26.519> overlap<00:00:27.180> and<00:00:27.480> actually<00:00:27.840> make

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
which overlap and actually make

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.620 
which overlap and actually make
something<00:00:28.349> a<00:00:28.710> smaller<00:00:29.609> flower<00:00:29.939> shape<00:00:30.300> in<00:00:30.510> the

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
something a smaller flower shape in the

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.540 
something a smaller flower shape in the
middle<00:00:30.929> so<00:00:31.590> I'll<00:00:31.740> show<00:00:31.949> you<00:00:32.009> roughly<00:00:32.219> what<00:00:32.399> I

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
middle so I'll show you roughly what I

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.389 
middle so I'll show you roughly what I
mean<00:00:32.820> I'm<00:00:33.300> going<00:00:33.630> to<00:00:33.750> go<00:00:33.930> up<00:00:34.469> there<00:00:34.890> in<00:00:35.250> the

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
mean I'm going to go up there in the

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.110 
mean I'm going to go up there in the
sort<00:00:35.969> of<00:00:36.059> a<00:00:36.180> petal<00:00:36.570> shape<00:00:36.600> and<00:00:37.820> then<00:00:38.820> come<00:00:39.090> back

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
sort of a petal shape and then come back

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.010 
sort of a petal shape and then come back
to<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.570> center<00:00:40.050> and<00:00:41.010> go<00:00:41.190> down<00:00:41.399> again<00:00:41.840> and<00:00:42.840> do

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
to the center and go down again and do

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.830 
to the center and go down again and do
something<00:00:43.469> similar<00:00:43.800> at<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.520> bottom<00:00:44.910> right<00:00:45.629> so

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
something similar at the bottom right so

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.410 
something similar at the bottom right so
I've<00:00:45.930> got<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:46.230> two<00:00:46.410> there<00:00:46.680> which<00:00:46.890> sort<00:00:47.219> of<00:00:47.420> set

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
I've got the two there which sort of set

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.819 
I've got the two there which sort of set
this<00:00:48.600> in<00:00:48.809> half<00:00:49.020> so<00:00:49.260> you<00:00:49.350> can<00:00:49.469> see<00:00:49.620> roughly

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
this in half so you can see roughly

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.189 
this in half so you can see roughly
where<00:00:50.100> you're<00:00:50.219> going<00:00:50.520> from<00:00:50.670> now<00:00:50.850> so<00:00:51.629> next<00:00:51.899> I'm

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
where you're going from now so next I'm

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.580 
where you're going from now so next I'm
going<00:00:52.230> to<00:00:52.410> take<00:00:52.620> out<00:00:52.829> one<00:00:53.070> next<00:00:53.399> to<00:00:53.730> that<00:00:54.590> and

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
going to take out one next to that and

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.529 
going to take out one next to that and
go<00:00:55.770> up<00:00:55.949> to<00:00:56.129> there<00:00:56.370> and<00:00:57.350> come<00:00:58.350> back<00:00:58.500> again<00:00:58.829> and

00:00:59.529 --> 00:00:59.539 
go up to there and come back again and

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:02.330 
go up to there and come back again and
then<00:01:00.539> I'm<00:01:00.870> going<00:01:01.140> to<00:01:01.199> take<00:01:01.379> one<00:01:01.590> out<00:01:01.620> down<00:01:02.010> that

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
then I'm going to take one out down that

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.160 
then I'm going to take one out down that
way<00:01:03.170> and<00:01:04.170> come<00:01:04.559> back<00:01:04.739> again<00:01:05.869> now<00:01:06.869> what<00:01:07.020> you'll

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
way and come back again now what you'll

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.370 
way and come back again now what you'll
see<00:01:07.380> is<00:01:07.500> that<00:01:07.530> I'm<00:01:08.600> overlapping<00:01:09.600> a<00:01:09.930> bit<00:01:10.110> there

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
see is that I'm overlapping a bit there

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.230 
see is that I'm overlapping a bit there
and<00:01:10.650> as<00:01:11.040> we<00:01:11.220> go<00:01:11.340> on<00:01:11.549> you'll<00:01:11.760> see<00:01:11.850> that<00:01:12.090> that

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
and as we go on you'll see that that

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.719 
and as we go on you'll see that that
starts<00:01:12.659> to<00:01:12.750> form<00:01:12.990> an<00:01:13.110> internal<00:01:13.680> square<00:01:13.950> right

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
starts to form an internal square right

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.450 
starts to form an internal square right
sorry<00:01:15.390> an<00:01:15.540> internal<00:01:15.960> flower<00:01:16.200> right<00:01:17.009> so<00:01:17.220> I<00:01:17.250> go

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
sorry an internal flower right so I go

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.190 
sorry an internal flower right so I go
off<00:01:17.610> on<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.880> next<00:01:18.030> one<00:01:18.360> and<00:01:18.600> again<00:01:18.750> I'm<00:01:19.020> going

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
off on the next one and again I'm going

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.330 
off on the next one and again I'm going
up<00:01:19.380> they're<00:01:19.640> overlapping<00:01:21.740> I'm<00:01:22.740> coming<00:01:23.159> back

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
up they're overlapping I'm coming back

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.240 
up they're overlapping I'm coming back
down<00:01:23.610> here<00:01:24.030> again<00:01:24.350> and<00:01:25.350> then<00:01:25.860> I<00:01:25.950> do<00:01:26.009> the<00:01:26.220> same

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
down here again and then I do the same

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.880 
down here again and then I do the same
across<00:01:26.790> in<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.090> other<00:01:27.240> direction<00:01:28.369> so<00:01:29.369> that's

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
across in the other direction so that's

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.580 
across in the other direction so that's
giving<00:01:31.890> me<00:01:32.329> start<00:01:33.329> at<00:01:33.509> my<00:01:33.659> inner<00:01:33.930> inner<00:01:34.409> flower

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
giving me start at my inner inner flower

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.010 
giving me start at my inner inner flower
there<00:01:34.920> so<00:01:35.579> now<00:01:35.729> I've<00:01:35.909> got<00:01:36.119> six<00:01:36.420> here<00:01:36.720> and<00:01:36.960> I

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
there so now I've got six here and I

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.859 
there so now I've got six here and I
just<00:01:37.259> need<00:01:37.439> these<00:01:37.650> two<00:01:37.710> more<00:01:38.610> so<00:01:38.939> I've<00:01:39.060> got<00:01:39.270> one

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
just need these two more so I've got one

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.340 
just need these two more so I've got one
going<00:01:40.259> out<00:01:40.409> that<00:01:40.829> way<00:01:41.280> and<00:01:42.000> come<00:01:42.930> back<00:01:43.170> in

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
going out that way and come back in

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.999 
going out that way and come back in
again<00:01:43.500> and<00:01:43.970> one<00:01:44.970> going<00:01:45.180> up<00:01:45.479> that<00:01:45.750> way<00:01:46.009> and

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
again and one going up that way and

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.139 
again and one going up that way and
coming<00:01:47.280> back<00:01:47.520> in<00:01:47.729> again

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
coming back in again

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.530 
coming back in again
right<00:01:48.990> now<00:01:49.290> these<00:01:49.560> aren't<00:01:49.829> as<00:01:50.180> that<00:01:51.180> one<00:01:51.360> there

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
right now these aren't as that one there

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.620 
right now these aren't as that one there
is<00:01:51.689> too<00:01:51.899> big<00:01:52.140> so<00:01:52.380> I'm<00:01:52.799> going<00:01:53.040> to<00:01:53.130> have<00:01:53.310> to

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
is too big so I'm going to have to

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.380 
is too big so I'm going to have to
redraw<00:01:54.630> that<00:01:54.960> slightly<00:01:55.380> like<00:01:55.829> that<00:01:56.180> so<00:01:57.180> that

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
redraw that slightly like that so that

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.230 
redraw that slightly like that so that
that<00:01:57.780> bit<00:01:58.409> there<00:01:58.649> and<00:01:59.009> all<00:01:59.280> of<00:01:59.490> that<00:01:59.700> out<00:01:59.880> I'm

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
that bit there and all of that out I'm

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.139 
that bit there and all of that out I'm
using<00:02:00.689> a<00:02:01.040> HB<00:02:02.040> pencil<00:02:02.219> so<00:02:02.610> I<00:02:02.640> can<00:02:02.850> rub<00:02:03.000> things

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
using a HB pencil so I can rub things

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.480 
using a HB pencil so I can rub things
out<00:02:03.329> easily<00:02:03.570> as<00:02:03.899> I<00:02:03.990> go<00:02:04.170> so<00:02:04.770> now<00:02:04.950> you<00:02:05.009> can<00:02:05.369> see

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
out easily as I go so now you can see

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.039 
out easily as I go so now you can see
broadly<00:02:05.969> I've<00:02:06.149> got<00:02:06.360> although<00:02:06.600> I'll<00:02:06.750> have<00:02:06.930> to

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
broadly I've got although I'll have to

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.290 
broadly I've got although I'll have to
refine<00:02:07.380> this<00:02:07.530> a<00:02:07.590> bit<00:02:07.860> I've<00:02:08.700> got<00:02:08.940> an<00:02:09.119> outer

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
refine this a bit I've got an outer

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.260 
refine this a bit I've got an outer
flower<00:02:09.720> and<00:02:10.080> an<00:02:10.379> inner<00:02:10.649> flower<00:02:10.890> as<00:02:11.129> well<00:02:11.340> so<00:02:12.150> my

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
flower and an inner flower as well so my

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.130 
flower and an inner flower as well so my
next<00:02:12.480> stage<00:02:12.629> now

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
next stage now

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.120 
next stage now
to<00:02:13.440> go<00:02:13.620> over<00:02:13.920> this<00:02:14.070> in<00:02:15.800> something<00:02:16.800> heavy<00:02:17.100> like

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
to go over this in something heavy like

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.250 
to go over this in something heavy like
a<00:02:17.340> felt-tip<00:02:17.730> or<00:02:18.000> something<00:02:18.510> so<00:02:18.930> that<00:02:19.110> the

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
a felt-tip or something so that the

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.740 
a felt-tip or something so that the
design<00:02:19.560> shows<00:02:19.860> up<00:02:20.070> really<00:02:20.370> well<00:02:20.660> what<00:02:21.660> I'm

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
design shows up really well what I'm

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.050 
design shows up really well what I'm
going<00:02:21.840> to<00:02:21.960> do<00:02:22.110> then<00:02:22.320> is<00:02:22.530> put<00:02:23.490> it<00:02:23.640> underneath

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
going to do then is put it underneath

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.410 
going to do then is put it underneath
the<00:02:24.720> fabric<00:02:25.170> so<00:02:26.010> that<00:02:26.040> I<00:02:26.220> can<00:02:26.430> trace<00:02:26.730> on<00:02:27.030> to<00:02:27.300> the

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
the fabric so that I can trace on to the

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.540 
the fabric so that I can trace on to the
fabric<00:02:27.780> itself<00:02:28.110> and<00:02:28.410> I'm<00:02:28.830> still<00:02:29.070> using<00:02:29.430> the

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
fabric itself and I'm still using the

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.020 
fabric itself and I'm still using the
pencil<00:02:29.790> for<00:02:30.210> this<00:02:30.300> chasing<00:02:30.810> because<00:02:31.940> then<00:02:32.940> I

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
pencil for this chasing because then I

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.270 
pencil for this chasing because then I
can<00:02:33.180> rub<00:02:33.330> it<00:02:33.360> out<00:02:33.600> if<00:02:33.750> I<00:02:33.870> do<00:02:33.930> go<00:02:34.200> wrong<00:02:34.230> and<00:02:34.620> I<00:02:35.220> am

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
can rub it out if I do go wrong and I am

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.650 
can rub it out if I do go wrong and I am
going<00:02:35.640> to<00:02:35.730> wash<00:02:35.880> this<00:02:36.090> after<00:02:36.450> it's<00:02:36.570> been

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
going to wash this after it's been

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.530 
going to wash this after it's been
quilted<00:02:37.110> anyway<00:02:37.410> but<00:02:37.890> I<00:02:37.920> want<00:02:38.220> good<00:02:38.540> distinct

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
quilted anyway but I want good distinct

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.870 
quilted anyway but I want good distinct
lines<00:02:39.750> from<00:02:40.110> me<00:02:40.860> to<00:02:41.010> be<00:02:41.130> able<00:02:41.220> to<00:02:41.340> follow<00:02:41.520> as

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
lines from me to be able to follow as

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.060 
lines from me to be able to follow as
I'm<00:02:42.060> quilting<00:02:42.540> so<00:02:43.200> I'm<00:02:43.380> doing<00:02:43.530> one<00:02:43.770> of<00:02:43.920> these

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
I'm quilting so I'm doing one of these

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.250 
I'm quilting so I'm doing one of these
for<00:02:44.340> the<00:02:44.430> moment<00:02:44.610> in<00:02:45.030> each<00:02:45.120> white<00:02:45.450> square<00:02:45.959> and

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
for the moment in each white square and

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.800 
for the moment in each white square and
here<00:02:47.130> you<00:02:47.310> can<00:02:47.430> see<00:02:47.670> I've<00:02:47.850> got<00:02:48.060> a<00:02:48.120> felt<00:02:48.570> tip

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
here you can see I've got a felt tip

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.770 
here you can see I've got a felt tip
drawing<00:02:49.230> underneath<00:02:49.860> so<00:02:50.670> now<00:02:50.880> I<00:02:50.910> can<00:02:51.390> just<00:02:51.570> go

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
drawing underneath so now I can just go

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.940 
drawing underneath so now I can just go
over<00:02:51.810> this<00:02:52.580> with<00:02:53.580> my<00:02:53.790> pencil<00:02:54.060> and<00:02:54.810> I<00:02:55.620> can<00:02:55.800> draw

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
over this with my pencil and I can draw

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.250 
over this with my pencil and I can draw
the<00:02:56.010> design<00:02:56.310> onto<00:02:56.820> the<00:02:57.090> block<00:02:57.330> so<00:02:57.989> I'm<00:02:58.110> going

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
the design onto the block so I'm going

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.110 
the design onto the block so I'm going
to<00:02:58.290> keep<00:02:58.500> going<00:02:58.680> on<00:02:58.860> to<00:02:59.100> now<00:02:59.250> and<00:02:59.520> do<00:02:59.640> this<00:02:59.880> in

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
to keep going on to now and do this in

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.430 
to keep going on to now and do this in
all<00:03:00.480> the<00:03:00.510> full<00:03:01.170> white<00:03:01.620> blocks<00:03:02.010> on<00:03:02.640> this<00:03:02.850> quilt

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
all the full white blocks on this quilt

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.650 
all the full white blocks on this quilt
I've<00:03:04.440> drawn<00:03:04.770> a<00:03:04.800> flower<00:03:05.160> now<00:03:05.520> in<00:03:05.850> each<00:03:06.209> of<00:03:06.239> the

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
I've drawn a flower now in each of the

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.530 
I've drawn a flower now in each of the
complete<00:03:07.620> squares<00:03:08.070> but<00:03:08.430> I<00:03:08.459> haven't<00:03:08.760> done

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
complete squares but I haven't done

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.250 
complete squares but I haven't done
anything<00:03:09.810> in<00:03:09.989> the<00:03:10.080> triangles<00:03:10.620> and<00:03:10.830> I<00:03:12.260> these

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
anything in the triangles and I these

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.070 
anything in the triangles and I these
were<00:03:13.290> all<00:03:13.770> made<00:03:14.190> for<00:03:14.459> a<00:03:14.489> 4-inch<00:03:14.910> blob<00:03:15.209> now<00:03:15.750> I've

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 
were all made for a 4-inch blob now I've

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.220 
were all made for a 4-inch blob now I've
also<00:03:16.760> done<00:03:17.760> the<00:03:17.910> same<00:03:18.150> design<00:03:18.510> for<00:03:18.540> an<00:03:18.840> 8<00:03:18.989> inch

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
also done the same design for an 8 inch

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.320 
also done the same design for an 8 inch
block<00:03:19.560> and<00:03:19.799> that<00:03:20.370> is<00:03:20.610> going<00:03:20.790> to<00:03:20.880> go<00:03:21.030> in<00:03:21.209> the

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.330 
block and that is going to go in the

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:25.970 
block and that is going to go in the
center<00:03:22.040> now<00:03:23.040> I<00:03:23.070> can<00:03:23.549> get<00:03:24.510> the<00:03:24.750> layering<00:03:25.620> done

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
center now I can get the layering done

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.360 
center now I can get the layering done
and<00:03:26.160> put<00:03:26.280> the<00:03:26.400> warning<00:03:26.790> and<00:03:26.880> the<00:03:26.940> backing<00:03:27.269> on<00:03:27.390> I

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
and put the warning and the backing on I

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:30.740 
and put the warning and the backing on I
began<00:03:29.370> with<00:03:29.580> the<00:03:29.760> central<00:03:30.269> block<00:03:30.510> which<00:03:30.720> is

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
began with the central block which is

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.710 
began with the central block which is
the<00:03:30.959> bigger<00:03:31.440> of<00:03:32.130> the<00:03:32.489> flowers<00:03:33.120> the<00:03:33.330> 8<00:03:33.480> inch

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
the bigger of the flowers the 8 inch

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.680 
the bigger of the flowers the 8 inch
flower<00:03:33.989> and<00:03:34.980> now<00:03:35.130> the<00:03:35.190> way<00:03:35.790> I've<00:03:36.180> sewed<00:03:36.480> them

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
flower and now the way I've sewed them

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.630 
flower and now the way I've sewed them
is<00:03:36.930> first<00:03:37.230> of<00:03:37.350> all<00:03:37.410> I've<00:03:37.680> gone<00:03:38.010> stitch<00:03:38.370> in<00:03:38.549> the

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 
is first of all I've gone stitch in the

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.250 
is first of all I've gone stitch in the
ditch<00:03:38.670> all<00:03:39.090> the<00:03:39.269> way<00:03:39.360> around<00:03:39.600> the<00:03:39.780> square<00:03:40.049> to

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
ditch all the way around the square to

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.120 
ditch all the way around the square to
stabilize<00:03:40.769> that<00:03:41.040> square<00:03:41.459> then<00:03:42.299> I<00:03:43.130> traveled

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
stabilize that square then I traveled

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.820 
stabilize that square then I traveled
back<00:03:44.489> along<00:03:45.000> one<00:03:45.330> of<00:03:45.450> those<00:03:45.630> seams<00:03:45.959> so<00:03:46.620> that<00:03:46.650> I

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:46.830 
back along one of those seams so that I

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:49.280 
back along one of those seams so that I
could<00:03:47.010> get<00:03:47.160> to<00:03:47.220> the<00:03:47.459> point<00:03:47.700> of<00:03:47.940> a<00:03:48.239> petal<00:03:48.959> and

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
could get to the point of a petal and

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.740 
could get to the point of a petal and
then<00:03:49.830> started<00:03:50.280> to<00:03:50.370> follow<00:03:50.610> that<00:03:50.880> down<00:03:51.090> so<00:03:51.720> I

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
then started to follow that down so I

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.380 
then started to follow that down so I
came<00:03:51.870> into<00:03:52.200> the<00:03:52.410> center<00:03:52.769> there<00:03:52.950> and<00:03:53.190> then<00:03:54.060> went

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
came into the center there and then went

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:58.100 
came into the center there and then went
out<00:03:54.690> on<00:03:55.170> the<00:03:55.470> next<00:03:55.709> petal<00:03:56.280> back<00:03:57.060> in<00:03:57.299> again<00:03:57.600> to

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:58.110 
out on the next petal back in again to

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:00.560 
out on the next petal back in again to
the<00:03:58.200> center<00:03:58.680> and<00:03:58.920> out<00:03:59.489> again<00:04:00.030> on<00:04:00.269> the<00:04:00.420> next

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:00.570 
the center and out again on the next

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:01.070 
the center and out again on the next
petal

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:01.080 
petal

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:04.070 
petal
now<00:04:01.530> the<00:04:02.180> the<00:04:03.180> lines<00:04:03.450> of<00:04:03.750> these<00:04:03.870> are

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.080 
now the the lines of these are

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.660 
now the the lines of these are
overlapping<00:04:04.500> as<00:04:04.769> you<00:04:04.860> can<00:04:05.040> see<00:04:05.220> that's<00:04:05.400> where

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 
overlapping as you can see that's where

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:07.820 
overlapping as you can see that's where
you<00:04:05.760> get<00:04:05.910> the<00:04:06.000> smaller<00:04:06.299> petal<00:04:06.750> from<00:04:06.959> but<00:04:07.560> it's

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:07.830 
you get the smaller petal from but it's

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:10.430 
you get the smaller petal from but it's
very<00:04:08.250> easy<00:04:08.670> just<00:04:09.060> to<00:04:09.180> keep<00:04:09.570> that<00:04:09.840> going<00:04:10.079> in<00:04:10.350> a

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
very easy just to keep that going in a

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.610 
very easy just to keep that going in a
gentle<00:04:10.890> loop<00:04:11.070> all<00:04:11.280> the<00:04:11.310> time<00:04:11.780> and<00:04:12.780> you<00:04:13.290> can<00:04:13.440> get

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
gentle loop all the time and you can get

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.380 
gentle loop all the time and you can get
right<00:04:13.829> the<00:04:13.980> way<00:04:14.100> around<00:04:14.340> to<00:04:14.910> the<00:04:15.000> beginning

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:15.390 
right the way around to the beginning

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:17.780 
right the way around to the beginning
again<00:04:15.450> then<00:04:15.870> I<00:04:16.049> find<00:04:16.890> it<00:04:17.040> easier<00:04:17.370> to<00:04:17.430> do<00:04:17.669> it

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:17.790 
again then I find it easier to do it

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:19.009 
again then I find it easier to do it
this<00:04:18.000> way

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:19.019 
this way

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:21.770 
this way
petals<00:04:19.650> side<00:04:19.979> by<00:04:20.190> side<00:04:20.489> rather<00:04:21.209> than<00:04:21.419> the<00:04:21.570> way

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
petals side by side rather than the way

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:23.570 
petals side by side rather than the way
I<00:04:21.810> drew<00:04:22.140> it<00:04:22.169> which<00:04:22.500> was<00:04:22.740> opposite<00:04:23.310> to<00:04:23.460> each

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
I drew it which was opposite to each

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.960 
I drew it which was opposite to each
other<00:04:23.820> because<00:04:24.450> this<00:04:24.900> way<00:04:25.080> you<00:04:25.140> can

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:25.970 
other because this way you can

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:27.940 
other because this way you can
it's<00:04:26.690> easier<00:04:26.960> to<00:04:27.080> keep<00:04:27.200> track<00:04:27.470> of<00:04:27.620> where<00:04:27.770> you

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:27.950 
it's easier to keep track of where you

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:29.890 
it's easier to keep track of where you
are<00:04:27.980> and<00:04:28.310> of<00:04:28.430> what<00:04:28.610> you're<00:04:28.760> doing<00:04:28.910> and<00:04:29.240> then<00:04:29.690> as

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900 
are and of what you're doing and then as

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:32.050 
are and of what you're doing and then as
you're<00:04:30.020> coming<00:04:30.320> back<00:04:30.500> down<00:04:30.770> here<00:04:31.250> you<00:04:31.880> want

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:32.060 
you're coming back down here you want

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:33.670 
you're coming back down here you want
your<00:04:32.240> mind<00:04:32.390> to<00:04:32.540> be<00:04:32.630> thinking<00:04:33.080> ahead<00:04:33.170> to<00:04:33.380> this

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 
your mind to be thinking ahead to this

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.620 
your mind to be thinking ahead to this
line<00:04:34.010> so<00:04:34.550> that<00:04:34.580> you<00:04:34.820> know<00:04:35.000> that's<00:04:35.270> the<00:04:35.510> way

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:35.630 
line so that you know that's the way

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:38.110 
line so that you know that's the way
that<00:04:35.780> you're<00:04:35.930> going<00:04:36.110> to<00:04:36.140> go<00:04:36.260> out<00:04:36.410> next<00:04:36.890> I<00:04:37.520> will

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:40.010 
that's as having started with the big

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:42.730 
that's as having started with the big
one<00:04:40.190> I<00:04:40.370> then<00:04:41.000> went<00:04:41.420> off<00:04:41.660> and<00:04:42.050> again<00:04:42.530> I'm

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:42.740 
one I then went off and again I'm

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:44.440 
one I then went off and again I'm
stitching<00:04:43.160> on<00:04:43.460> the<00:04:43.580> ditch<00:04:43.760> of<00:04:43.940> these<00:04:44.090> but<00:04:44.360> I'm

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:44.450 
stitching on the ditch of these but I'm

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:47.440 
stitching on the ditch of these but I'm
not<00:04:44.600> quilting<00:04:45.080> in<00:04:45.230> them<00:04:45.470> but<00:04:46.070> I've<00:04:46.250> went<00:04:47.240> round

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:52.150 
not quilting in them but I've went round
that<00:04:47.870> Square<00:04:48.320> and<00:04:48.530> then<00:04:49.160> did<00:04:49.790> this<00:04:50.980> flower<00:04:51.980> in

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:52.160 
that Square and then did this flower in

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.790 
that Square and then did this flower in
the<00:04:52.250> middle<00:04:52.280> and<00:04:52.670> so<00:04:53.270> on<00:04:53.450> there<00:04:53.720> so<00:04:54.170> I'm<00:04:54.560> going

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.490 
the middle and so on there so I'm going
to<00:04:54.860> set<00:04:55.010> it<00:04:55.130> up<00:04:55.220> now<00:04:55.430> so<00:04:55.640> you<00:04:55.670> can<00:04:55.910> see<00:04:56.500> I've

to set it up now so you can see I've

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.770 
to set it up now so you can see I've
shown<00:04:57.800> three<00:04:58.310> sides<00:04:58.610> of<00:04:58.820> the<00:04:59.000> square<00:04:59.240> around

00:04:59.770 --> 00:04:59.780 
shown three sides of the square around

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:01.450 
shown three sides of the square around
this<00:05:00.020> flower<00:05:00.350> and<00:05:00.740> I'm<00:05:00.830> just<00:05:01.010> going<00:05:01.160> to<00:05:01.280> show

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:01.460 
this flower and I'm just going to show

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:04.720 
this flower and I'm just going to show
that<00:05:01.700> last<00:05:02.360> line<00:05:03.110> now<00:05:03.560> and<00:05:03.830> then<00:05:04.280> I'll<00:05:04.430> go<00:05:04.580> in

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:04.730 
that last line now and then I'll go in

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:07.980 
that last line now and then I'll go in
and<00:05:04.850> I'll<00:05:04.970> surelly<00:05:05.600> the<00:05:06.320> flower<00:05:06.590> itself<00:05:07.160> so

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:07.990 
and I'll surelly the flower itself so

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:10.510 
and I'll surelly the flower itself so
smooth<00:05:08.990> everything<00:05:09.320> down<00:05:09.500> always<00:05:10.250> always

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:10.520 
smooth everything down always always

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:13.360 
smooth everything down always always
keep<00:05:10.970> it<00:05:11.120> as<00:05:11.270> flat<00:05:11.450> as<00:05:11.720> you<00:05:11.810> can<00:05:11.900> and<00:05:12.380> use<00:05:13.340> a

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:13.370 
keep it as flat as you can and use a

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:15.840 
keep it as flat as you can and use a
slight<00:05:13.880> sideways<00:05:14.480> pressure<00:05:14.780> of<00:05:14.960> your<00:05:15.110> fingers

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:15.850 
slight sideways pressure of your fingers

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:18.880 
slight sideways pressure of your fingers
to<00:05:16.850> keep<00:05:17.210> it<00:05:17.420> as<00:05:17.720> smooth<00:05:18.140> as<00:05:18.350> possible

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:18.890 
to keep it as smooth as possible

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:21.310 
to keep it as smooth as possible
it's<00:05:19.310> also<00:05:19.670> worth<00:05:20.150> going<00:05:20.630> underneath<00:05:21.050> and

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:21.320 
it's also worth going underneath and

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:23.650 
it's also worth going underneath and
just<00:05:21.500> pulling<00:05:22.160> out<00:05:22.280> a<00:05:22.310> bit<00:05:22.660> smoothing

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:23.660 
just pulling out a bit smoothing

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:24.760 
just pulling out a bit smoothing
underneath<00:05:24.080> a<00:05:24.110> bit<00:05:24.350> just<00:05:24.530> to<00:05:24.620> make<00:05:24.740> sure

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:24.770 
underneath a bit just to make sure

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:26.550 
underneath a bit just to make sure
you're<00:05:25.100> backing<00:05:25.430> isn't<00:05:25.730> getting<00:05:25.970> caught<00:05:26.180> up

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:26.560 
you're backing isn't getting caught up

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:33.610 
you're backing isn't getting caught up
okay

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:33.620 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:36.350 

so<00:05:34.620> that's<00:05:34.890> that<00:05:35.130> square<00:05:35.490> complete<00:05:35.940> so<00:05:36.210> I<00:05:36.240> know

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:36.360 
so that's that square complete so I know

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:38.150 
so that's that square complete so I know
now<00:05:36.660> that<00:05:36.690> the<00:05:37.050> center<00:05:37.560> area<00:05:37.890> where<00:05:38.070> the

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:38.160 
now that the center area where the

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.880 
now that the center area where the
flower<00:05:38.370> is<00:05:38.610> has<00:05:39.150> been<00:05:39.360> stabilized<00:05:39.960> so<00:05:40.560> now<00:05:40.710> I'm

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:40.890 
flower is has been stabilized so now I'm

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:42.530 
flower is has been stabilized so now I'm
going<00:05:41.100> to<00:05:41.220> travel<00:05:41.460> back<00:05:41.700> along<00:05:42.000> the<00:05:42.150> stitching

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:42.540 
going to travel back along the stitching

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:48.800 
going to travel back along the stitching
I've<00:05:42.690> just<00:05:42.930> done<00:05:43.200> for<00:05:46.640> just<00:05:47.640> that<00:05:47.790> inch<00:05:48.420> or<00:05:48.630> so

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:48.810 
I've just done for just that inch or so

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:50.930 
I've just done for just that inch or so
until<00:05:49.080> I<00:05:49.320> get<00:05:49.470> to<00:05:49.620> the<00:05:49.680> top<00:05:49.890> of<00:05:50.040> the<00:05:50.130> petal<00:05:50.460> and

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:50.940 
until I get to the top of the petal and

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:52.370 
until I get to the top of the petal and
now<00:05:51.150> I'm<00:05:51.360> going<00:05:51.540> to<00:05:51.600> start<00:05:51.900> looping<00:05:52.080> around

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:52.380 
now I'm going to start looping around

00:05:52.380 --> 00:06:21.749 
now I'm going to start looping around
all<00:05:52.740> the<00:05:52.860> petals

00:06:21.749 --> 00:06:21.759 

00:06:21.759 --> 00:06:24.219 

this<00:06:22.759> is<00:06:22.939> such<00:06:23.149> a<00:06:23.179> simple<00:06:23.449> design<00:06:23.929> that<00:06:23.959> I

00:06:24.219 --> 00:06:24.229 
this is such a simple design that I

00:06:24.229 --> 00:06:27.399 
this is such a simple design that I
don't<00:06:24.559> need<00:06:24.830> to<00:06:24.889> keep<00:06:25.759> moving<00:06:26.599> the<00:06:26.929> fabric<00:06:27.259> too

00:06:27.399 --> 00:06:27.409 
don't need to keep moving the fabric too

00:06:27.409 --> 00:06:30.369 
don't need to keep moving the fabric too
much<00:06:27.939> if<00:06:28.939> I<00:06:29.149> had<00:06:29.299> to<00:06:29.389> keep<00:06:29.539> swiveling<00:06:30.049> it<00:06:30.229> it

00:06:30.369 --> 00:06:30.379 
much if I had to keep swiveling it it

00:06:30.379 --> 00:06:32.199 
much if I had to keep swiveling it it
would<00:06:30.499> slow<00:06:30.679> things<00:06:30.709> down<00:06:31.009> a<00:06:31.159> lot<00:06:31.459> but<00:06:31.909> because

00:06:32.199 --> 00:06:32.209 
would slow things down a lot but because

00:06:32.209 --> 00:06:34.299 
would slow things down a lot but because
it's<00:06:32.389> just<00:06:32.569> a<00:06:32.719> simple<00:06:33.049> loop<00:06:33.259> each<00:06:33.469> time<00:06:33.499> and

00:06:34.299 --> 00:06:34.309 
it's just a simple loop each time and

00:06:34.309 --> 00:06:36.639 
it's just a simple loop each time and
I've<00:06:34.459> got<00:06:34.610> it<00:06:34.759> well<00:06:34.969> marked<00:06:35.360> with<00:06:35.539> pencil<00:06:36.049> I

00:06:36.639 --> 00:06:36.649 
I've got it well marked with pencil I

00:06:36.649 --> 00:06:39.189 
I've got it well marked with pencil I
can<00:06:37.159> keep<00:06:37.369> going<00:06:37.399> and<00:06:38.089> see<00:06:38.509> where<00:06:38.719> I'm<00:06:38.869> going

00:06:39.189 --> 00:06:39.199 
can keep going and see where I'm going

00:06:39.199 --> 00:06:41.949 
can keep going and see where I'm going
still<00:06:39.499> with<00:06:40.069> it<00:06:40.419> usually<00:06:41.419> pointing<00:06:41.779> in<00:06:41.899> the

00:06:41.949 --> 00:06:41.959 
still with it usually pointing in the

00:06:41.959 --> 00:06:58.520 
still with it usually pointing in the
same<00:06:41.989> direction

00:06:58.520 --> 00:06:58.530 

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:01.130 

right<00:06:59.530> so<00:06:59.800> now<00:06:59.920> I've<00:07:00.070> been<00:07:00.100> right<00:07:00.430> around<00:07:00.550> the

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:01.140 
right so now I've been right around the

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:03.870 
right so now I've been right around the
the<00:07:02.140> flower<00:07:02.710> and<00:07:03.070> I'm<00:07:03.190> back<00:07:03.370> to<00:07:03.400> where<00:07:03.610> I<00:07:03.640> began

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:03.880 
the flower and I'm back to where I began

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:07.980 
the flower and I'm back to where I began
of<00:07:04.150> the<00:07:04.300> tip<00:07:04.510> of<00:07:04.660> that<00:07:05.700> petal<00:07:06.700> so<00:07:07.150> now<00:07:07.450> I<00:07:07.780> will

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:07.990 
of the tip of that petal so now I will

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:10.410 
of the tip of that petal so now I will
travel<00:07:08.620> stitch<00:07:08.920> along<00:07:09.310> one<00:07:09.730> of<00:07:09.880> these<00:07:10.060> seams

00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:10.420 
travel stitch along one of these seams

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:11.940 
travel stitch along one of these seams
either<00:07:10.810> that<00:07:11.050> one<00:07:11.200> I've<00:07:11.290> already<00:07:11.470> come<00:07:11.770> back

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:11.950 
either that one I've already come back

00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:15.390 
either that one I've already come back
on<00:07:12.160> or<00:07:12.610> down<00:07:12.910> there<00:07:13.380> and<00:07:14.380> then<00:07:14.560> I<00:07:14.650> can<00:07:14.680> begin<00:07:15.160> to

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:15.400 
on or down there and then I can begin to

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:17.400 
on or down there and then I can begin to
stitch<00:07:15.790> around<00:07:15.970> the<00:07:16.210> ditch<00:07:16.390> for<00:07:16.600> this<00:07:16.780> next

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:17.410 
stitch around the ditch for this next

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:27.980 
stitch around the ditch for this next
one

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:27.990
