00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:13.279
 on the principle of study in Moscow 

00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:16.379
 here and not worth the candle product 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.449
 capable we are very upset 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.640
 Luzhkov 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.640
 tactics strategy 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.689
 starting table chair stuffed 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.660
 water 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.530
 the representatives 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.530
 in the capital 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.270
 disk 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:49.570
 lack of coherence 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.570
 eat drink 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.390
 rubles 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.940
 the game is generally a phone experience 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:05.930
 football 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.210
 because 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.490
 clavicle normal schedule is quite and 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.000
 very difficult 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.980
 accordingly four people would be 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:18.440
 one gene bartoli 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.920
 Minsk picture quite pleasant 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.920
 wolves 700 kv 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:30.970
 she really football of course a little like 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:32.940
 because too 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:34.600
 dynamically 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.970
 they move athletes 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.160
 in real pain in slow 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:40.970
 braked tass 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.550
 search here left here right before 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:44.450
 little hall 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.149
 and everything happens very, very quickly 

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:49.480
 dynamic that is 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:52.060
 on the bands to not roll 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:53.780
 although you can mastruev 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.550
 chelendzh twist 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:59.550
 due to this i don't know 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.380
 there are all sorts of lane strikes 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:06.990
 enrages the most 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.669
 what he 

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:10.919
 active player who controls 

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:13.579
 automatically switches itself 

00:02:13.579 --> 00:02:15.430
 accordingly focused on 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.889
 one chip closest to you 

00:02:17.889 --> 00:02:19.319
 own goal there switched to 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:21.639
 there is no other I donâ€™t know what to do there 

00:02:21.639 --> 00:02:23.549
 at all 

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:26.099
 I suspect that it can be like that 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:29.299
 set up to 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:31.349
 manage your own adventures 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:34.579
 editor 

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:36.059
 but this is my position 

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:38.789
 say no settings so on 

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:40.049
 politician 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:41.840
 the game is calculated 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.629
 sharpened anthem flag 

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:47.619
 Putin therefore play straw 

00:02:47.619 --> 00:02:48.879
 Hermann 

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:51.159
 it is clear that if I lose I do not know 

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:54.399
 hours 10 then Lithuania jerk off 

00:02:54.399 --> 00:02:56.019
 and so here 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:57.909
 even when it seems to remember which buttons 

00:02:57.909 --> 00:03:00.909
 offset treatment 

00:03:01.679 --> 00:03:02.879
 don't care who is ok 

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:05.879
 get to play 

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:15.059
 everything 

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:18.739
 most advanced no description of st 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:20.539
 but here's the keyboard 

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:23.229
 that is, there is only a description of what 

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:26.229
 common do on haz 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:30.219
 of course there is a description when 

00:03:30.219 --> 00:03:32.629
 if before starting the game there is such 

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:34.209
 doll 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:37.299
 tune in a construction site 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:38.940
 adjust parameters 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:40.740
 before that you can watch it and 

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:43.589
 absolutely not see 

00:03:43.589 --> 00:03:45.449
 oh if you just started playing with him 

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:46.479
 to withstand 

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:49.479
 memorize how it is there 

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:57.799
 generally on pvp played in the system 

00:03:58.539 --> 00:04:00.599
 there were difficulties with this a 

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:03.599
 switching to players 

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:18.269
 in general, of course the behavior of all this 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:20.039
 Enigmatic enough that I 

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:22.109
 I suspect that he 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:23.879
 each player individual contributed 

00:04:23.879 --> 00:04:26.639
 their such paintings 

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:27.960
 I will answer 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.050
 characteristics depends 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:31.199
 how he remembered 

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:34.629
 the people pass the class takes the ball 

00:04:34.629 --> 00:04:36.770
 gets tired with so on 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:39.770
 to penetrate this whole ideology 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:43.559
 spend a lot of time 

00:04:43.559 --> 00:04:46.559
 to the main role 

00:04:47.349 --> 00:04:49.650
 but then of course yes 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:52.650
 of course can get to get 

00:04:56.099 --> 00:04:59.389
 I'm still very dynamic 

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:02.389
 in the sense that he is anti rabies world 

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:15.709
 buckwheat is hard enough that we 

00:05:15.709 --> 00:05:18.080
 cope with it 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:21.080
 of course you can try 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:32.990
 ambassador beat spa nice actually 

00:05:36.939 --> 00:05:39.939
 rejection and not cause 

00:05:45.309 --> 00:05:48.309
 I think the run-up to the championship 

00:05:49.259 --> 00:05:51.949
 an object 

00:05:51.949 --> 00:05:54.949
 All this data gris but relevant 

00:06:00.069 --> 00:06:00.589
 picket
