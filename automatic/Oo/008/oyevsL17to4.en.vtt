00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.999 

you<00:01:25.680> still<00:01:25.860> get<00:01:25.979> that<00:01:26.100> kind<00:01:26.400> of<00:01:26.430> grip<00:01:26.700> in<00:01:26.850> a<00:01:26.939> set

00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:28.009 
you still get that kind of grip in a set

that<00:01:29.009> it's<00:01:29.729> quite<00:01:29.939> still<00:01:30.360> quite<00:01:30.540> punchy<00:01:31.640> and

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
that it's quite still quite punchy and

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.910 
that it's quite still quite punchy and
you<00:01:32.759> get<00:01:32.880> that<00:01:33.000> gases<00:01:33.780> kind<00:01:34.110> of<00:01:34.200> lager<00:01:34.470> style

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
and so almost Pilsner lager

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.990 
and so almost Pilsner lager
and<00:01:38.490> so<00:01:39.060> it's<00:01:39.840> ideal<00:01:40.110> if<00:01:40.710> you<00:01:41.100> want<00:01:41.490> to<00:01:41.640> lose

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.109 
and so it's ideal if you want to lose
weight<00:01:43.189> and<00:01:44.189> this<00:01:44.340> is<00:01:44.520> sounding<00:01:44.759> like<00:01:44.820> a<00:01:44.939> bit

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
weight and this is sounding like a bit

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.460 
weight and this is sounding like a bit
of<00:01:45.149> an<00:01:45.360> advertorial<00:01:45.750> but<00:01:46.049> it's<00:01:46.140> not<00:01:46.259> meant<00:01:46.439> to

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
of an advertorial but it's not meant to

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.330 
of an advertorial but it's not meant to
be<00:01:46.619> and<00:01:47.130> and<00:01:47.790> also<00:01:48.890> you<00:01:49.890> don't<00:01:50.009> want<00:01:50.189> to<00:01:50.250> wake

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.240 
up in the morning with a hangover so
this<00:01:54.270> is<00:01:54.390> my<00:01:54.540> little<00:01:54.689> recommendation<00:01:55.500> for<00:01:55.770> for
