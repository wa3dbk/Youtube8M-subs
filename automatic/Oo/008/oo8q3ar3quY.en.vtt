today what we're going to look at is

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:20.230 
today what we're going to look at is
riding<00:00:18.770> with<00:00:18.949> the<00:00:19.070> balanced<00:00:19.430> position<00:00:19.670> in

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:20.240 
riding with the balanced position in

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.610 
riding with the balanced position in
walk<00:00:21.020> trot<00:00:21.500> and<00:00:21.800> canter<00:00:22.900> so<00:00:23.900> the<00:00:24.080> first<00:00:24.350> thing

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:24.620 
walk trot and canter so the first thing

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:27.730 
walk trot and canter so the first thing
we're<00:00:24.800> looking<00:00:24.890> at<00:00:25.220> is<00:00:25.490> that<00:00:26.390> the<00:00:27.230> rider<00:00:27.500> is

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:27.740 
we're looking at is that the rider is

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:30.310 
we're looking at is that the rider is
sitting<00:00:28.039> in<00:00:28.160> the<00:00:28.250> deepest<00:00:28.670> part<00:00:28.910> of<00:00:29.090> saddle<00:00:29.510> so

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:30.320 
sitting in the deepest part of saddle so

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.650 
sitting in the deepest part of saddle so
what's<00:00:30.560> crucial<00:00:30.890> is<00:00:31.490> that<00:00:32.059> the<00:00:32.149> saddle<00:00:32.570> is

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:32.660 
what's crucial is that the saddle is

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:35.260 
what's crucial is that the saddle is
correctly<00:00:33.350> fitting<00:00:33.829> and<00:00:34.129> correctly<00:00:34.579> balanced

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:35.270 
correctly fitting and correctly balanced

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:37.479 
correctly fitting and correctly balanced
because<00:00:35.809> if<00:00:36.140> the<00:00:36.260> saddle<00:00:36.469> is<00:00:36.680> sitting<00:00:37.010> too<00:00:37.250> low

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:37.489 
because if the saddle is sitting too low

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:40.840 
because if the saddle is sitting too low
behind<00:00:37.700> or<00:00:38.630> too<00:00:39.020> low<00:00:39.200> in<00:00:39.350> front<00:00:39.650> that<00:00:40.520> will

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:40.850 
behind or too low in front that will

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:42.700 
behind or too low in front that will
affect<00:00:41.420> the<00:00:41.690> way<00:00:41.720> the<00:00:42.020> rider<00:00:42.230> can<00:00:42.470> balance

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:42.710 
affect the way the rider can balance

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:43.540 
affect the way the rider can balance

you just like to ride a circle somewhere

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.940 
you just like to ride a circle somewhere
and<00:03:00.600> then<00:03:01.290> a<00:03:01.319> change<00:03:01.650> of<00:03:01.889> rain<00:03:03.440> so<00:03:04.440> as<00:03:04.590> you<00:03:04.739> ride

and then a change of rain so as you ride
on<00:03:05.220> to<00:03:05.400> a<00:03:05.459> circle<00:03:06.120> keep<00:03:06.690> a<00:03:06.780> little<00:03:06.900> bit<00:03:07.049> more

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
on to a circle keep a little bit more

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.590 
on to a circle keep a little bit more
weight<00:03:07.620> in<00:03:07.859> the<00:03:07.889> inside<00:03:08.459> stirrup<00:03:09.030> keep<00:03:09.480> the

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
weight in the inside stirrup keep the

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.170 
weight in the inside stirrup keep the
inside<00:03:10.079> shoulder<00:03:10.470> back<00:03:10.920> and<00:03:11.190> look<00:03:11.370> round<00:03:11.730> your

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
inside shoulder back and look round your

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.020 
inside shoulder back and look round your
circle<00:03:12.810> so<00:03:13.769> your<00:03:13.950> shoulders<00:03:14.489> match<00:03:14.760> the

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
circle so your shoulders match the

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:20.990 
circle so your shoulders match the
horses<00:03:15.510> shoulders

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.210 

and<00:03:21.780> then<00:03:22.020> if<00:03:22.140> you<00:03:22.230> could<00:03:22.380> change<00:03:22.590> the<00:03:22.890> Raylan

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
and then if you could change the Raylan

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:24.890 
and then if you could change the Raylan
show<00:03:23.430> us<00:03:23.580> that<00:03:23.730> same<00:03:24.060> movement<00:03:24.570> on<00:03:24.750> the<00:03:24.870> other

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
show us that same movement on the other

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:46.580 
show us that same movement on the other
rein

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.040 

so<00:03:47.190> when<00:03:47.640> you<00:03:47.760> change<00:03:48.030> the<00:03:48.270> rain<00:03:48.569> you<00:03:48.870> then

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:49.050 
so when you change the rain you then

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:51.170 
so when you change the rain you then
need<00:03:49.290> to<00:03:49.440> change<00:03:49.830> the<00:03:50.489> positioning<00:03:51.000> of<00:03:51.120> your

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
need to change the positioning of your

need to change the positioning of your
body<00:03:51.569> a<00:03:51.720> little<00:03:51.900> bit<00:03:52.200> so<00:03:52.890> you<00:03:52.950> keep<00:03:53.250> there<00:03:53.520> a

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:53.550 
body a little bit so you keep there a

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:55.130 
body a little bit so you keep there a
little<00:03:53.760> bit<00:03:53.849> more<00:03:54.060> weight<00:03:54.270> in<00:03:54.540> the<00:03:54.569> inside

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
little bit more weight in the inside

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:57.589 
little bit more weight in the inside
stirrup<00:03:55.739> because<00:03:56.610> particularly<00:03:57.060> on<00:03:57.239> a<00:03:57.300> big

00:03:57.589 --> 00:03:57.599 
stirrup because particularly on a big

00:03:57.599 --> 00:03:59.600 
stirrup because particularly on a big
moving<00:03:58.080> young<00:03:58.290> horse<00:03:58.620> it<00:03:58.860> will<00:03:58.980> tend<00:03:59.190> to<00:03:59.310> throw

00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610 
moving young horse it will tend to throw

you to the outside of the saddle with
centrifugal<00:04:02.730> force<00:04:03.239> so<00:04:03.390> keep<00:04:03.780> the<00:04:03.900> weight

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.080 
centrifugal force so keep the weight

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.920 
centrifugal force so keep the weight

so<00:05:14.220> once<00:05:14.490> the<00:05:14.700> horse<00:05:14.940> has<00:05:15.120> become<00:05:15.419> a<00:05:15.450> bit<00:05:15.690> more

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:15.770 
so once the horse has become a bit more

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:23.719 
so once the horse has become a bit more
educated<00:05:17.360> that<00:05:18.360> will<00:05:18.770> improve<00:05:22.100> so<00:05:23.100> likewise

00:05:23.719 --> 00:05:23.729 
educated that will improve so likewise

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:26.750 
educated that will improve so likewise
at<00:05:24.180> through<00:05:24.600> the<00:05:24.720> transition<00:05:25.500> the<00:05:26.190> lower<00:05:26.400> leg

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:26.760 
at through the transition the lower leg

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:28.700 
at through the transition the lower leg
didn't<00:05:27.150> move<00:05:27.360> it<00:05:27.660> stayed<00:05:27.930> secure<00:05:28.169> and

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:28.710 
didn't move it stayed secure and

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:30.909 
didn't move it stayed secure and
underneath<00:05:29.130> her<00:05:29.430> maintaining<00:05:30.300> her<00:05:30.419> balance

00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:30.919 
underneath her maintaining her balance

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:38.420 
underneath her maintaining her balance
hand<00:05:31.919> soft<00:05:33.560> elbows<00:05:34.560> nice<00:05:34.919> and<00:05:35.220> flexible<00:05:37.430> if

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:38.430 
hand soft elbows nice and flexible if

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:40.520 
hand soft elbows nice and flexible if
you<00:05:38.820> could<00:05:38.910> ride<00:05:39.090> a<00:05:39.120> circle<00:05:39.780> in<00:05:39.870> the<00:05:39.900> canter

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:40.530 
you could ride a circle in the canter

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:57.890 
you could ride a circle in the canter
and<00:05:40.560> then<00:05:40.950> forward<00:05:41.490> to<00:05:41.669> trot

00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:57.900 

00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:59.990 

so<00:05:58.440> the<00:05:58.590> downward<00:05:58.979> transition<00:05:59.639> was<00:05:59.790> more

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:00.000 
so the downward transition was more

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.210 
so the downward transition was more
balanced<00:06:00.449> which<00:06:00.780> then<00:06:01.020> helps<00:06:01.470> the<00:06:01.710> rider

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:02.220 
balanced which then helps the rider

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:05.210 
balanced which then helps the rider
maintain<00:06:03.030> her<00:06:03.270> balance<00:06:03.540> and<00:06:04.199> then<00:06:05.009> in<00:06:05.130> your

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:05.220 
maintain her balance and then in your

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:10.520 
maintain her balance and then in your
own<00:06:05.280> time<00:06:05.729> forward<00:06:06.120> to<00:06:06.479> walk<00:06:09.259> and<00:06:10.259> if<00:06:10.410> you

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:10.530 
own time forward to walk and if you

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:20.350 
own time forward to walk and if you
could<00:06:10.680> just<00:06:10.710> join<00:06:11.039> me<00:06:11.310> over<00:06:11.460> here

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:20.360 

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:25.490 

so<00:06:21.360> just<00:06:21.960> to<00:06:22.170> recap<00:06:23.240> the<00:06:24.240> most<00:06:24.750> important

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:25.500 
so just to recap the most important

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:28.400 
so just to recap the most important
thing<00:06:25.710> for<00:06:25.920> the<00:06:26.010> rider<00:06:26.280> is<00:06:26.940> to<00:06:27.420> remain<00:06:28.080> in

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:28.410 
thing for the rider is to remain in

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:30.680 
thing for the rider is to remain in
balance<00:06:29.190> and<00:06:29.370> allow<00:06:29.670> the<00:06:29.730> horse<00:06:30.180> to<00:06:30.480> work

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:30.690 
balance and allow the horse to work

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:34.180 
balance and allow the horse to work
without<00:06:31.080> being<00:06:31.260> interfered<00:06:32.100> with<00:06:32.400> so<00:06:33.270> she

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:34.190 
without being interfered with so she

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:37.520 
without being interfered with so she
maintained<00:06:35.190> the<00:06:35.370> two<00:06:35.580> lines<00:06:35.960> ears<00:06:36.960> shoulder

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:37.530 
maintained the two lines ears shoulder

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:40.280 
maintained the two lines ears shoulder
hip<00:06:37.770> and<00:06:37.980> heel<00:06:38.430> and<00:06:38.640> then<00:06:39.300> again<00:06:39.600> this<00:06:39.840> line<00:06:40.110> is

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:40.290 
hip and heel and then again this line is

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:42.830 
hip and heel and then again this line is
important<00:06:41.010> from<00:06:41.190> the<00:06:41.280> elbow<00:06:41.820> through<00:06:42.480> the<00:06:42.660> arm

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:42.840 
important from the elbow through the arm

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:45.830 
important from the elbow through the arm
and<00:06:43.230> down<00:06:43.290> into<00:06:44.010> the<00:06:44.100> hand<00:06:44.340> so<00:06:45.090> she<00:06:45.180> can<00:06:45.480> give

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:45.840 
and down into the hand so she can give

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:47.930 
and down into the hand so she can give
and<00:06:46.200> take<00:06:46.410> through<00:06:46.770> the<00:06:46.860> elbow<00:06:47.310> joint<00:06:47.610> you

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:47.940 
and take through the elbow joint you

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:49.130 
and take through the elbow joint you
could<00:06:48.060> just<00:06:48.240> show<00:06:48.360> how<00:06:48.540> you'd<00:06:48.690> give<00:06:48.900> it<00:06:48.930> the

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:49.140 
could just show how you'd give it the

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:51.830 
could just show how you'd give it the
sit<00:06:49.350> so<00:06:50.040> that<00:06:50.070> you<00:06:50.820> can<00:06:51.060> move<00:06:51.300> your<00:06:51.600> hand

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:51.840 
sit so that you can move your hand

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:54.110 
sit so that you can move your hand
forward<00:06:52.230> and<00:06:52.830> always<00:06:53.010> encourage<00:06:53.760> the<00:06:53.910> horse

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:54.120 
forward and always encourage the horse

00:06:54.120 --> 00:07:00.200 
forward and always encourage the horse
to<00:06:54.330> work<00:06:54.480> forward<00:06:54.900> to<00:06:55.260> the<00:06:55.380> contact<00:06:57.380> and<00:06:59.210> then

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:00.210 
to work forward to the contact and then

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:03.740 
to work forward to the contact and then
as<00:07:00.480> the<00:07:00.690> horse<00:07:00.900> gets<00:07:01.260> better<00:07:01.530> trained<00:07:02.750> his

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:03.750 
as the horse gets better trained his

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:05.390 
as the horse gets better trained his
transitions<00:07:04.410> will<00:07:04.620> get<00:07:04.800> better<00:07:05.040> and

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:05.400 
transitions will get better and

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:06.920 
transitions will get better and
therefore<00:07:05.760> to<00:07:05.850> be<00:07:05.940> easier<00:07:06.420> for<00:07:06.480> him<00:07:06.870> to

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:06.930 
therefore to be easier for him to

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:08.960 
therefore to be easier for him to
maintain<00:07:07.260> his<00:07:07.560> balance<00:07:07.770> and<00:07:08.460> for<00:07:08.700> the<00:07:08.760> rider

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:08.970 
maintain his balance and for the rider

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:12.440 
maintain his balance and for the rider
thank<00:07:09.930> you<00:07:10.050> very<00:07:10.200> much
