00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:29.800
 as soon as the horse stays still obediently you can start with the 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.060
 preparatory exercises of reverence 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:36.060
 I call this stretching legs 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.700
 please ask amaya a bow 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.510
 as you can see in reverence the outstretched hand clearly supports a good 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:51.510
 part of the weight despite its oblique position and as it goes down it still does 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:52.550
 plus 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.270
 this means that there is a significant effort to support weight at the moment 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:58.830
 of stretch 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:02.400
 this horse has gone through all the previous exercises that we have already 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.210
 taught 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.260
 Diaz has developed strong confidence and his muscles are fine 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.730
 preparations 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:13.030
 now they do is demonstrate in the various actions of the jobs they have as the 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:14.950
 horse feels it 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.950
 I ask the owner to keep his face right 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.820
 on the occasion of the vagina 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.230
 then the horse felt pressure up here what for him will be the 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:33.230
 order to descend his body 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.690
 on the other side of your body you will feel pressure on your ribs just that 

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:42.330
 for them was the order to move towards millions corn 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.200
 felt a pressure on his hands back will indicate that the recoil 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.540
 after 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.560
 ap 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.040
 by the passage of xynthia I also felt pressure and when I was I won 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.360
 experience this feeling will make you feel that you are carefully wrapped 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.530
 for work like in a hammock and that will not fall
