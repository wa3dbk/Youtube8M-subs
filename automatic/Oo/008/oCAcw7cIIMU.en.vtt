 that has been very good for development 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.799
 what did you learn the most there? 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.420
 yes i think i work a lot through the workout 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.899
 have gained confidence in 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:51.000
 yes every football player does and yes 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.710
 the times i have sat was year 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.939
 always yes then I see you stop it 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:58.890
 or you can raid or play for a while 

00:01:55.939 --> 00:02:01.170
 and yes at willem 2 i really have everything 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.399
 played and the two cousins and many 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.530
 give confidence 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:05.670
 yes that's that buy students glory 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.130
 back 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.450
 Last year he was allowed out what to say 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:10.709
 you are now happy to change in the year 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.140
 want to get back 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:14.910
 then we have a look at the situation 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:18.360
 two years ago after a year of fire and 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.260
 gentlemen nice to look at and for him 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.230
 to get better 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:26.170
 well that didn't work out so well 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.549
 and restless breendonk ate well it is 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.709
 have returned to the 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:30.670
 preparing them then you look a 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:35.069
 times 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:36.730
 well then decided not to 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:39.400
 Well 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:43.629
 thus let go in two and 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.830
 yes retain a large rights 

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:46.540
 on the player 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:49.840
 so it was easier and he 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:53.319
 has a lot to get back and there you see 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:55.510
 that you have something smaller smaller with me 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:57.610
 clubs you get the opportunity to 40 5 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:01.660
 play games and that is at ajax 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:04.989
 sometimes difficult to care about the youth 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:07.090
 give all matches a long long chance 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:09.609
 and then you see it with him 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:12.459
 worked out very well 

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:14.230
 blue blades now 22 to you are not 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:17.560
 talent more than you are mature guy 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:19.180
 so then you also see in the bowl you want and 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.709
 two energies just something the 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.450
 bottom of soccer in a nice go 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:24.760
 Fighting fight baatjes of course 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:28.840
 everything always good from the youth hey 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:31.359
 everything well arranged so tell concerns 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.220
 it is just very good learning 

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:34.930
 required now also met with the eye 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.250
 on a possible departure from another 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:39.639
 left back study 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:42.150
 already at that position to make strong 

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:44.859
 well that is obvious because truly 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:46.660
 together we decided that boilies 

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:51.459
 want to look across the border 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:54.040
 So the chances are very high that he is 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:57.000
 in far going to get and have thus 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.000
 anticipated 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:02.130
 I think I've been you in that year 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.570
 then people you can be here so you still have 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:05.130
 meanwhile still had contact with 

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:08.550
 former teammates with now again 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:10.440
 your teammates yes yes I have it often 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:12.960
 contact with fieldman 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:16.200
 with davy klaassen so that's it 

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:18.000
 always funny in the past and yes 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.739
 the still have contact with what 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.790
 they said when you have you around 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:24.030
 came 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:24.510
 nice meta you are happy with this back 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:28.820

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:28.820
