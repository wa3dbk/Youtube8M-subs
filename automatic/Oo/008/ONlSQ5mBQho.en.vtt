00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:21.130 
leg lift box so it's a whole heap of

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:23.250 
leg lift box so it's a whole heap of
bars<00:00:21.400> against<00:00:21.730> the<00:00:21.940> wall<00:00:22.119> and<00:00:22.360> you're<00:00:23.170> gonna

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:23.260 
bars against the wall and you're gonna

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:24.269 
bars against the wall and you're gonna
kind<00:00:23.440> of<00:00:23.529> hang<00:00:23.590> on<00:00:23.800> it<00:00:23.890> and<00:00:23.980> then<00:00:24.070> lift<00:00:24.250> your

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:24.279 
kind of hang on it and then lift your

kind of hang on it and then lift your
toes<00:00:24.490> up<00:00:24.700> to<00:00:24.790> the<00:00:24.880> bar<00:00:25.060> I<00:00:25.090> could<00:00:25.420> do<00:00:25.510> that

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:25.540 
toes up to the bar I could do that

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:27.330 
toes up to the bar I could do that
really<00:00:25.810> easily<00:00:26.200> and<00:00:26.320> i<00:00:26.529> think<00:00:26.770> that's<00:00:27.070> when

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:27.340 
really easily and i think that's when

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:29.429 
really easily and i think that's when
the<00:00:27.730> coach<00:00:27.910> to<00:00:28.090> the<00:00:28.119> car<00:00:28.419> was<00:00:28.630> like<00:00:28.810> yes<00:00:29.110> you
