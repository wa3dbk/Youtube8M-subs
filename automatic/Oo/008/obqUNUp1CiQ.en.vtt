00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.030
 victor Iranian have chosen a stretch of beach not frequented by the 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:38.170
 fishermen 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:39.730
 it's a lonely beach 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:42.580
 almost desert a few kilometers from Valencia 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:46.530
 already a few days ago of his last attempt and the temperatures have gone up 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.980
 considerably since then 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.600
 In addition, the fishermen of the area have managed to capture some specimen 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.600
 close to 3 kilos 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.140
 today our fishermen against what is usual in the area have 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.640
 decided to fish the gold of the day 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.520
 something common in other places but not here where large specimens 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.990
 they are usually captured 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:24.470
 or at sunset 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:29.150
 but perhaps the exciting thing about fishing is that all these theories and customs 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.150
 in coming down 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:10.120
 from acaip 

00:02:38.529 --> 00:02:41.529
 on the catwalk 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:50.389
 this great gilthead to overcome them 

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:53.029
 He left a few hours after noon 

00:03:53.029 --> 00:03:57.259
 once again it is confirmed that in this of fishing the many theories 

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:59.989
 Sometimes that's just theories 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:03.909
 a piece of this size aps-c that to a strong resistance that the fisherman 

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:08.609
 must know how to control because there is a hasty gesture an inopportune movement that 

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:12.439
 board this powerful pÃ©rez can break the line puncture the fret 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.900
 always warriors go reel 

00:04:26.939 --> 00:04:30.809
 to wait for it to be above 40 meters 50 meters that when more war 

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:35.569
 That's when you get patience 

00:04:35.569 --> 00:04:38.569
 i and that loreto aloha envites that has 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.599
 let the drift get tired 

00:04:42.599 --> 00:04:44.340
 bring it closer to the shore 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:47.520
 and that the piercing put my belly up 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:50.509
 that is synonymous with this ode to her 

00:04:50.509 --> 00:04:52.830
 he has it 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:55.830
 12 from oradea with the help of a wave take it out 

00:04:59.719 --> 00:05:01.930
 if you are in a hurry to get it out 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:05.460
 now she will touch the sand and she had a sudden movement 

00:05:06.279 --> 00:05:07.689
 colom and mordant 

00:05:07.689 --> 00:05:09.800
 the cd to telo break 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.800
 so what you always have to avoid 

00:05:13.999 --> 00:05:17.209
 percent until then life about 150 meters 

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:21.789
 for a little fight and brickwork omoa invited but 

00:05:22.539 --> 00:05:25.349
 in the end it came out 

00:05:25.349 --> 00:05:26.809
 the delay in Cuba 

00:05:26.809 --> 00:05:27.719
 tomorrow brings the time
