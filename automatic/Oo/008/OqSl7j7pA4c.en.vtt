00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:13.129
 podcast to sign studies from the 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:14.840
 facilities of the teacher's room 

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:18.580
 university art center 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:20.779
 architecture and design last week 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:23.840
 my wife and I went to the area 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:26.390
 dress up Medrano and we met her and 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:30.170
 I was surprised that he was selling 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:32.780
 you have them again, panama, and I take 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:37.040
 to memory in a memory father of the 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:38.440
 childhood that we used those sneakers to 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.109
 to be 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.489
 playing with friends while being there in the 

00:00:41.109 --> 00:00:44.739
 physical education class at school 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:47.350
 and it made me an interesting topic in the 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:49.769
 which we can chat a little in this 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:49.769
 podcast 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:00.520
 to these tennis nobody can imitate them 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.950
 know they are original because they are very 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:05.470
 endorsers and because they are made to 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:08.460
 hand are made for the feet of 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.460
 children and for adults 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:15.790
 georges physical education bathtub 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:17.230
 blue and white socks was the 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:19.740
 accompaniment for the classes of 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:19.740
 physical education 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:28.050
 for where Mexico is bcv was founded on 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:30.420
 August 2, 1962 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:34.500
 and you have what is known as panama is 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:39.170
 originally the model 0084 of the name 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.170
 of champion and was created in 1976 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.979
 currently tennis is not manufactured 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:50.350
 in our navy blue colors 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:52.920
 blue sky white pink red white with 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:57.450
 red white with blue black with yellow 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.450
 and black with him 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.509
 in these times there are those who are 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:06.100
 buying the white tennis shoes of panama 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:06.100
 to paint them many colors 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.810
 good as we can realize what they are 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:20.019
 impacting have a long history 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.909
 from the 60s that journey 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:23.470
 again the seventies with its design 

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:25.569
 most successful after others came 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:29.860
 closed models with another type of 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:31.390
 materials and I think the value has to 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.829
 being tennis is a bit sentimental 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:36.340
 especially for the generations that 

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:39.730
 we come the decade of the eighties 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:42.250
 a little bit a beginning of the 90 but 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:47.230
 already later in that journey of the 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:49.030
 decade of the 90s were left without 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.790
 sell that tennis until in 2003 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:54.310
 he came back again 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:56.410
 that retro wave behind 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.000
 good for this thing we say goodbye 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:02.430
