00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.989
 before we get the command blocks more exactly 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:05.939
 we should first see the 

00:00:03.989 --> 00:00:07.890
 Basics of the command scan them 

00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:10.080
 start with a / and can either 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.240
 with op right in the chat line over 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.830
 a command blog or on a server 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.690
 running in the console 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.849
 You can also put them in a text of 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.160
 write books or chat messages 

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:23.039
 We will be packing directly into minecraft 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.570
 all commands listed with / help in 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.929
 the chat line we can also do the 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.339
 tab key use a commentator 

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:30.749
 we want to let complete ourselves 

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:32.730
 the exact syntax of a command 

00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:34.500
 we can watch the command without 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.180
 execute parameters or even the 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.520
 command page in minecraft the review 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.770
 linked in the description 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.690
 elementary is eg the / game mode command 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.780
 with him we can for a selector 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.700
 between the creative doubt adventure 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.310
 or select spectator mode 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.140
 detailed information on the information for 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:53.970
 Lektor and finds her in the extra video 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.920
 would you like a selector to one 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:58.110
 use certain position teleport 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.820
 get the scp command and give the 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:01.200
 desired coordinates to the 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.930
 coordinates his current position 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.880
 One finds out by pressing the f3 key 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.380
 expresses there once there 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.810
 coordinates for normal use 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.909
 and about the exact coordinates for 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.369
 Experts are in a command 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.950
 coordinates needed takes over minecraft 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.240
 the rule when pressing the tab button 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.939
 automatically the values ​​of the block the 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.340
 you have selected with the crosshairs f3 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.749
 Menu you will also find a red green 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.960
 and blue line 

00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:30.240
 These indicate in which direction the 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.799
 xyz I want to get bigger I want one 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.749
 players so by five blocks in the direction 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.670
 I have to teleport to the red line 

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:38.039
 the value of his ex- coordinator at 5 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.929
 increase to us big computational tasks too 

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:41.850
 There is a relative saving in minecraft 

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:44.729
 coordinates of the Bahnstadt one 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:47.249
 numerical value with old gr and plus one 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.049
 wave minecraft automatically takes the 

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:51.420
 coordinates of the player 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.280
 I just want to find the players 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.439
 now teleport to ex five blocks 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.659
 I hang a five behind this wave 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.130
 for - six blocks opposite to the 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.109
 blue line i use for the z 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.779
 coordinate a wave with a minus 6 

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:05.670
 1 at the tc command is also available 

00:02:03.779 --> 00:02:07.200
 behind the coordinates for the position 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.330
 also two more slots for the 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.459
 horizontal and vertical direction 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.870
 of the player mf3 menu you can find the 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:14.569
 exactly 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.340
 value in the point facing alternatively one can 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:18.140
 at tc command also city 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.299
 coordinate the name of a player 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.640
 writing with this command will be the 

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:24.290
 selecta therefore to a target person 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.150
 you want to teleport players randomly 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.159
 distribute in a square area 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.409
 you use the spread players command 

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:32.840
 first you give tx and z 

00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:35.090
 coordinates of the center then 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.340
 the distance to each entity approximately 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.709
 should be apart and then 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:42.170
 the length with the square of the point 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:43.640
 from nothing and z direction both in 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.310
 positive as well as negative direction 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.019
 teams are to be set up together 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.970
 will stay , among other things, if not 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:51.500
 if and at the end we decide 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.480
 for which sectors the command 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.250
 the players will not play 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.959
 teleported in caves but always on 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.629
 the highest light air blog 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:01.970
 If we want to select kill we use 

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:03.409
 the command the point at the 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:06.890
 deceased players to be revived 

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:09.140
 shall be determined with spawn point set 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:12.440
 worldspan also gives the center 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:14.599
 of 32 32 blocks wide range of 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.340
 in which the players are new to the world 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:18.260
 come as my spread players command 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:20.000
 should spawn the difficulty of one 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.639
 world we can with / difficulty 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.160
 set the daytime setting with / 

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:28.220
 times at or it can and the weather can 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:29.200
 to get full with / meta or / bird down 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:32.030
 influence 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:34.040
 stay is a sim level a lot with us 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:36.079
 can test if a command is blocked 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:38.299
 is for visually appealing writings 

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:39.739
 you use the plate and title command 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:41.900
 the more accurate in a separate video 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:43.849
 Experience points can be presented 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.510
 one also with the / xp command 

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:47.269
 to distribute 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:50.660
 First you give the value of the xp and 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:53.000
 then select with xp3col 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:54.470
 coli gets three points of experience each 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.750
 by level a certain percentage 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:59.090
 the xp bar fill up whole level increases 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:02.569
 one by putting behind the value 1 l 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:04.190
 with xp 3 el kun the level will be so 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:05.449
 regardless of the status of the ex priest 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:07.340
 always increase by 3 

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:10.299
 with negative values ​​one can reach the level 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:10.299
 also reduce
