00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:31.710 

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:33.860 

I<00:06:31.740> think<00:06:32.699> it's<00:06:32.820> getting<00:06:33.030> close<00:06:33.479> to<00:06:33.509> two

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:33.870 
I think it's getting close to two

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:36.469 
I think it's getting close to two
o'clock<00:06:34.310> and<00:06:35.310> it's<00:06:35.880> still<00:06:36.120> coming<00:06:36.300> down

00:06:36.469 --> 00:06:36.479 
o'clock and it's still coming down

00:06:36.479 --> 00:06:39.860 
o'clock and it's still coming down
pretty<00:06:36.780> good<00:06:37.110> pretty<00:06:37.590> steady<00:06:38.750> and<00:06:39.750> they

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:39.870 
pretty good pretty steady and they

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:41.330 
pretty good pretty steady and they
always<00:06:40.020> said<00:06:40.289> we<00:06:40.380> were<00:06:40.590> due<00:06:40.740> to<00:06:40.860> get<00:06:41.039> one<00:06:41.190> two

always said we were due to get one two

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:43.790 
always said we were due to get one two
three<00:06:41.639> I<00:06:41.910> think<00:06:42.539> we've<00:06:42.870> already<00:06:43.050> gotten<00:06:43.410> sick

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:43.800 
three I think we've already gotten sick

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:45.770 
three I think we've already gotten sick
it's<00:06:44.250> pretty<00:06:44.580> close<00:06:44.880> to<00:06:45.150> two<00:06:45.360> o'clock

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:45.780 
it's pretty close to two o'clock

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:49.070 
it's pretty close to two o'clock
dispelling<00:06:46.350> the<00:06:46.590> driveway<00:06:47.100> open<00:06:47.900> see<00:06:48.900> the

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:49.080 
dispelling the driveway open see the

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:51.110 
dispelling the driveway open see the
pretty<00:06:49.530> trees<00:06:49.949> over<00:06:50.340> there<00:06:50.580> with<00:06:50.759> all<00:06:50.940> the

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:51.120 
pretty trees over there with all the

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:54.230 
pretty trees over there with all the
snow<00:06:51.389> one<00:06:51.800> two<00:06:52.800> o'clock<00:06:53.190> and<00:06:53.580> it's<00:06:53.940> still

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:54.240

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:13.740 

I<00:07:11.150> think<00:07:11.780> the<00:07:11.900> county<00:07:12.139> trust<00:07:12.560> has<00:07:12.740> only<00:07:12.950> been

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:13.750 
I think the county trust has only been

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:16.540 
I think the county trust has only been
passed<00:07:14.750> the<00:07:14.990> house<00:07:15.169> one<00:07:15.530> time<00:07:15.860> and<00:07:16.220> that's<00:07:16.310> out

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:16.550 
passed the house one time and that's out

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:19.060 
passed the house one time and that's out
on<00:07:16.580> the<00:07:16.850> main<00:07:17.060> road<00:07:17.090> not<00:07:17.510> even<00:07:17.840> it's<00:07:17.990> out<00:07:18.830> in

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:19.070 
on the main road not even it's out in

00:07:19.070 --> 00:08:00.410 
on the main road not even it's out in
front<00:07:19.310> of<00:07:19.370> our<00:07:19.520> house

00:08:00.410 --> 00:08:00.420
