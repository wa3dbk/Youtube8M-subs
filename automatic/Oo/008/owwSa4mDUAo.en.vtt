there's<00:00:18.960> loads<00:00:19.170> you<00:00:19.380> can<00:00:19.410> configure<00:00:19.890> you<00:00:20.520> can

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
there's loads you can configure you can

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.550 
there's loads you can configure you can
do<00:00:20.789> the<00:00:20.939> drop<00:00:21.180> percentage<00:00:21.689> chance<00:00:21.990> I've<00:00:22.350> got

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
do the drop percentage chance I've got

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.439 
do the drop percentage chance I've got
mine<00:00:22.710> set<00:00:22.740> to<00:00:23.100> a<00:00:23.130> ESO<00:00:23.640> will<00:00:23.820> do<00:00:23.970> it<00:00:24.089> most<00:00:24.269> of<00:00:24.390> the

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
mine set to a ESO will do it most of the

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.509 
mine set to a ESO will do it most of the
time<00:00:24.539> throughout<00:00:24.990> the<00:00:25.140> video<00:00:25.259> then<00:00:26.220> you<00:00:26.369> can

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
time throughout the video then you can

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:27.890 
time throughout the video then you can
have<00:00:26.609> a<00:00:26.640> message<00:00:26.939> you<00:00:27.300> can<00:00:27.390> set<00:00:27.570> this<00:00:27.689> to<00:00:27.869> true

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
or false and it will basically send a

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.030 
or false and it will basically send a
message<00:00:30.210> if<00:00:30.419> the<00:00:30.659> player<00:00:30.869> is<00:00:31.050> decapitated<00:00:31.890> and

actual decapitation itself so if the

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
rewards which you can also set you can

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.720 
rewards which you can also set you can
also<00:00:45.930> do<00:00:46.320> whether<00:00:46.559> mobs<00:00:46.859> drop<00:00:47.190> their<00:00:47.370> heads<00:00:47.550> or

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
also do whether mobs drop their heads or

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.970 
also do whether mobs drop their heads or
not<00:00:47.969> obviously<00:00:48.719> you<00:00:49.109> might<00:00:49.289> not<00:00:49.440> want<00:00:49.649> them<00:00:49.800> to

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
not obviously you might not want them to

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.819 
not obviously you might not want them to
so<00:00:50.219> you<00:00:50.309> can<00:00:50.430> put<00:00:50.910> that<00:00:50.969> false<00:00:51.510> there's<00:00:52.500> also<00:00:52.649> a

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
so you can put that false there's also a

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.229 
so you can put that false there's also a
few<00:00:53.160> other<00:00:53.280> things<00:00:53.399> you<00:00:53.760> can<00:00:53.850> have<00:00:53.969> grave

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
few other things you can have grave

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.180 
few other things you can have grave
stones<00:00:54.629> which<00:00:54.929> basically<00:00:54.960> pops<00:00:55.590> a<00:00:55.769> sign<00:00:55.980> down

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
stones which basically pops a sign down

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.889 
stones which basically pops a sign down
like<00:00:56.460> this<00:00:56.640> so<00:00:56.969> if<00:00:57.090> you<00:00:57.210> kill<00:00:57.390> a<00:00:57.420> player<00:00:57.719> it

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
like this so if you kill a player it

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.479 
like this so if you kill a player it
will<00:00:58.019> say<00:00:58.230> their<00:00:58.469> information<00:00:58.890> and<00:00:59.160> who<00:00:59.370> they

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
will say their information and who they

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.430 
will say their information and who they
were<00:00:59.579> killed<00:00:59.820> by<00:01:00.019> personally<00:01:01.019> I'd<00:01:01.109> have<00:01:01.289> that

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
were killed by personally I'd have that

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.930 
were killed by personally I'd have that
off<00:01:01.589> but<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:01.980> features<00:01:02.339> there<00:01:02.579> if<00:01:02.699> you<00:01:02.789> would

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
off but the features there if you would

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.540 
off but the features there if you would
like<00:01:03.179> it<00:01:03.449> lightning<00:01:04.379> on<00:01:04.500> death<00:01:04.800> so<00:01:05.190> if<00:01:05.400> the

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:05.550 
like it lightning on death so if the

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:08.060 
like it lightning on death so if the
player<00:01:05.760> dies<00:01:06.090> by<00:01:06.420> decapitation<00:01:06.780> it<00:01:07.770> will<00:01:07.920> do<00:01:08.040> a

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
player dies by decapitation it will do a

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.730 
player dies by decapitation it will do a
lightning<00:01:08.520> bolt<00:01:08.700> and<00:01:09.000> then<00:01:09.540> XP<00:01:10.110> reward<00:01:10.500> you

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
lightning bolt and then XP reward you

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.859 
lightning bolt and then XP reward you
can<00:01:10.860> also<00:01:11.010> set<00:01:11.400> this<00:01:11.520> to<00:01:11.729> true<00:01:11.759> and<00:01:12.180> set

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
can also set this to true and set

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.109 
can also set this to true and set
additional<00:01:13.170> XP<00:01:13.920> for<00:01:14.220> this<00:01:14.430> actual<00:01:14.790> beheading

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
additional XP for this actual beheading

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.740 
additional XP for this actual beheading
so<00:01:15.869> for<00:01:16.079> instance<00:01:16.110> if<00:01:16.530> I<00:01:16.619> behead<00:01:16.950> him<00:01:17.070> I'll<00:01:17.340> get

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750 
so for instance if I behead him I'll get

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.480 
so for instance if I behead him I'll get
50,000<00:01:18.750> extra<00:01:19.229> XP<00:01:19.560> which<00:01:19.920> I've<00:01:20.159> set<00:01:20.310> in<00:01:20.400> the

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
50,000 extra XP which I've set in the

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.490 
50,000 extra XP which I've set in the
config<00:01:20.880> file<00:01:21.090> obviously<00:01:21.990> you'd<00:01:22.140> want<00:01:22.350> your

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
config file obviously you'd want your

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.469 
config file obviously you'd want your
set<00:01:22.829> more<00:01:23.040> sensibly<00:01:23.579> than<00:01:23.759> that<00:01:23.909> but<00:01:24.180> this<00:01:24.329> is

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
set more sensibly than that but this is

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.170 
set more sensibly than that but this is
a<00:01:24.540> great<00:01:24.720> way<00:01:24.899> to<00:01:24.960> show<00:01:25.259> it<00:01:25.290> in<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.590> example<00:01:26.180> so

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
a great way to show it in the example so

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.870 
a great way to show it in the example so
for<00:01:27.329> instance<00:01:27.360> if<00:01:27.810> I<00:01:27.899> kill<00:01:28.140> him<00:01:28.579> you<00:01:29.579> can<00:01:29.700> see

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
for instance if I kill him you can see

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.399 
for instance if I kill him you can see
i'll<00:01:30.060> get<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.299> custom<00:01:30.689> message<00:01:31.049> it<00:01:31.200> says

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
i'll get the custom message it says

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.580 
i'll get the custom message it says
variation<00:01:32.040> bolt<00:01:32.280> was<00:01:32.460> decapitated<00:01:32.850> by<00:01:33.420> me<00:01:33.659> you

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
variation bolt was decapitated by me you
