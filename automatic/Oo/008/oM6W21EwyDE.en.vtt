whatever this is takes a lot of getting
used<00:01:51.030> to<00:01:51.180> but<00:01:51.390> you<00:01:51.600> will<00:01:51.780> get<00:01:51.930> used<00:01:51.990> to<00:01:52.290> it<00:01:52.409> but

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
used to but you will get used to it but

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.499 
used to but you will get used to it but
there<00:01:53.520> was<00:01:53.670> a<00:01:53.700> constant<00:01:54.240> level<00:01:54.329> of

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
there was a constant level of

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:55.819 
there was a constant level of
frustration<00:01:54.630> I<00:01:55.170> just<00:01:55.409> couldn't<00:01:55.649> do<00:01:55.799> it

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
frustration I just couldn't do it

another turn in a 180 is difficult and

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.709

in<00:01:59.130> a<00:01:59.310> multiplayer<00:01:59.729> it's<00:02:00.149> kind<00:02:00.420> of<00:02:00.450> funny<00:02:00.659> to

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
in a multiplayer it's kind of funny to

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.660 
in a multiplayer it's kind of funny to
watch<00:02:00.840> everyone<00:02:01.320> try<00:02:02.070> to<00:02:02.130> do<00:02:02.310> that<00:02:02.520> they're

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
watch everyone try to do that they're

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.789 
watch everyone try to do that they're
just<00:02:02.820> it's<00:02:03.060> essentially<00:02:03.600> a<00:02:03.630> who<00:02:04.380> can<00:02:04.560> get<00:02:04.710> you

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
just it's essentially a who can get you

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:08.990

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.260 
expect on any of these games
the<00:02:14.560> monsters<00:02:15.560> are<00:02:15.650> pretty<00:02:15.920> blocky<00:02:16.220> the<00:02:16.580> guns

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
controlling you can see I'm not doing

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.160 
controlling you can see I'm not doing
too<00:03:05.959> well<00:03:05.990> as<00:03:06.290> usual<00:03:07.660> but<00:03:08.660> you<00:03:08.840> will<00:03:09.020> get<00:03:09.110> used

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
too well as usual but you will get used

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:11.760 
too well as usual but you will get used
to<00:03:09.440> it<00:03:09.560> but<00:03:09.800> it's<00:03:10.430> never<00:03:10.670> going<00:03:10.820> to<00:03:10.880> be<00:03:10.970> fluid

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:11.770 
to it but it's never going to be fluid

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:14.050 
to it but it's never going to be fluid
so<00:03:12.770> let's<00:03:12.950> check<00:03:13.160> out<00:03:13.280> the<00:03:13.310> multiplayer<00:03:13.760> for<00:03:14.030> a

nothing<00:05:21.740> unique<00:05:22.220> from<00:05:23.260> idea<00:05:24.260> perspective<00:05:24.860> so

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:25.420 
nothing unique from idea perspective so

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:28.090 
nothing unique from idea perspective so
when<00:05:26.420> it<00:05:26.510> goes<00:05:26.600> on<00:05:26.720> sale<00:05:26.780> eventually<00:05:27.560> then<00:05:27.800> you

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:28.100 
when it goes on sale eventually then you

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:29.230 
when it goes on sale eventually then you
know<00:05:28.220> it's<00:05:28.400> probably<00:05:28.520> worth<00:05:28.790> picking<00:05:28.970> up<00:05:29.120> at

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:29.240
