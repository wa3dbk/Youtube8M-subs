I'm<00:00:06.210> going<00:00:06.720> to<00:00:06.899> show<00:00:07.170> you<00:00:07.200> how<00:00:07.710> to<00:00:07.770> trim<00:00:08.220> a

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
I'm going to show you how to trim a

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.150 
I'm going to show you how to trim a
horse's<00:00:08.790> hoof<00:00:09.120> with<00:00:09.809> a<00:00:09.840> rasp<00:00:10.200> on<00:00:10.530> our

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
horse's hoof with a rasp on our

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.690 
horse's hoof with a rasp on our
three-year-old<00:00:11.969> filly<00:00:12.509> flora<00:00:13.250> she<00:00:14.250> does<00:00:14.460> not

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
three-year-old filly flora she does not

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.599 
three-year-old filly flora she does not
wear<00:00:14.910> horseshoes<00:00:15.269> and<00:00:16.170> we<00:00:16.710> need<00:00:16.920> to<00:00:17.070> check<00:00:17.400> her

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
wear horseshoes and we need to check her

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.359 
wear horseshoes and we need to check her
horse<00:00:17.880> regularly<00:00:18.720> because<00:00:19.500> most<00:00:19.949> young

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
horse regularly because most young

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.279 
horse regularly because most young
horses<00:00:20.820> tend<00:00:21.630> to<00:00:21.869> wear<00:00:22.080> their<00:00:22.380> hoofs<00:00:22.650> unevenly

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:24.289 
horses tend to wear their hoofs unevenly

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:26.990 
horses tend to wear their hoofs unevenly
before<00:00:25.289> I<00:00:25.320> begin<00:00:25.680> to<00:00:25.859> work<00:00:26.070> on<00:00:26.279> the<00:00:26.460> hoof<00:00:26.670> I

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
before I begin to work on the hoof I

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.380 
before I begin to work on the hoof I
need<00:00:27.630> to<00:00:27.779> clean<00:00:28.050> it<00:00:28.320> from<00:00:28.980> any<00:00:29.220> soil<00:00:29.640> gravel<00:00:30.060> or

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
need to clean it from any soil gravel or

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.630 
need to clean it from any soil gravel or
mark

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:33.640 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.029 

so<00:00:34.120> we<00:00:34.300> can<00:00:34.510> see<00:00:34.749> that<00:00:35.019> she's<00:00:35.469> walked<00:00:35.739> a<00:00:35.890> bit

00:00:36.029 --> 00:00:36.039 
so we can see that she's walked a bit

00:00:36.039 --> 00:00:40.020 
so we can see that she's walked a bit
unevenly<00:00:37.320> so<00:00:38.320> this<00:00:38.500> is<00:00:38.679> the<00:00:38.890> outer<00:00:39.219> layer<00:00:39.460> of

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:40.030 
unevenly so this is the outer layer of

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.250 
unevenly so this is the outer layer of
roof<00:00:41.039> that<00:00:42.039> needs<00:00:42.429> to<00:00:43.359> be<00:00:43.390> adjusted

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:44.260 
roof that needs to be adjusted

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.950 
roof that needs to be adjusted
that's<00:00:44.500> all<00:00:44.769> that's<00:00:45.489> quite<00:00:45.820> soft<00:00:46.210> in<00:00:46.539> here

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:46.960 
that's all that's quite soft in here

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.029 
that's all that's quite soft in here
this<00:00:47.859> one<00:00:48.100> is<00:00:48.129> the<00:00:48.280> softest<00:00:48.940> part<00:00:49.469> so<00:00:50.469> what<00:00:50.769> we

00:00:51.029 --> 00:00:51.039 
this one is the softest part so what we

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:54.329 
this one is the softest part so what we
concentrate<00:00:51.699> on<00:00:51.909> us<00:00:52.089> is<00:00:52.390> this<00:00:52.750> here<00:00:53.140> you<00:00:54.100> can

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:54.339 
concentrate on us is this here you can

00:00:54.339 --> 00:00:58.139 
concentrate on us is this here you can
see<00:00:55.170> expect<00:00:56.170> thicker<00:00:56.859> here<00:00:57.369> and<00:00:57.640> she<00:00:57.850> walked

00:00:58.139 --> 00:00:58.149 
see expect thicker here and she walked

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:02.160 
see expect thicker here and she walked
more<00:00:58.449> on<00:00:58.570> that<00:00:58.780> side<00:00:59.109> it<00:01:00.070> helps<00:01:00.519> to<00:01:01.170> take

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:02.170 
more on that side it helps to take

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:07.350 
more on that side it helps to take
something<00:01:02.530> like<00:01:02.949> the<00:01:03.250> rasp<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:06.729> centerline

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:07.360 
something like the rasp the centerline

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.410 
something like the rasp the centerline
of<00:01:07.600> the<00:01:07.810> hoof<00:01:08.049> goes<00:01:08.710> through<00:01:09.130> the<00:01:09.310> Frog<00:01:09.670> which

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:10.420 
of the hoof goes through the Frog which

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.840 
of the hoof goes through the Frog which
is<00:01:10.659> the<00:01:10.840> triangular<00:01:11.470> shape<00:01:11.890> soft<00:01:12.310> bit<00:01:12.640> down

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:12.850 
is the triangular shape soft bit down

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.330 
is the triangular shape soft bit down
the<00:01:13.060> middle<00:01:13.270> good<00:01:13.869> way<00:01:14.080> to<00:01:14.140> mark<00:01:14.979> the

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340 
the middle good way to mark the

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.020 
the middle good way to mark the
centerline<00:01:16.560> you<00:01:17.560> look<00:01:17.709> at<00:01:17.890> it<00:01:18.069> because<00:01:18.819> you

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.030 
centerline you look at it because you

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.680 
centerline you look at it because you
won't<00:01:19.270> see<00:01:19.569> where<00:01:20.319> it<00:01:20.500> is<00:01:20.619> from<00:01:21.090> looking<00:01:22.090> down

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:22.690 
won't see where it is from looking down

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:32.039 
won't see where it is from looking down
on<00:01:23.020> it<00:01:23.490> it's<00:01:24.490> just<00:01:29.789> a<00:01:30.789> little<00:01:31.450> notch<00:01:31.750> in<00:01:31.780> it

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:32.049 
on it it's just a little notch in it

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:34.710 
on it it's just a little notch in it
here<00:01:32.560> there<00:01:33.429> you<00:01:33.580> can<00:01:33.759> see<00:01:33.939> the<00:01:34.090> knots<00:01:34.299> looking

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:34.720 
here there you can see the knots looking

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.440 
here there you can see the knots looking
down<00:01:34.959> onto<00:01:35.319> the<00:01:35.470> horse<00:01:35.709> you<00:01:36.340> know<00:01:36.450> our

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450 
down onto the horse you know our

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.139 
down onto the horse you know our
homemade<00:01:38.140> tripod<00:01:38.800> is<00:01:38.979> very<00:01:39.399> useful<00:01:39.970> for

00:01:40.139 --> 00:01:40.149 
homemade tripod is very useful for

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:42.630 
homemade tripod is very useful for
resting<00:01:40.869> the<00:01:40.989> hoof<00:01:41.170> on<00:01:41.379> while<00:01:42.009> I<00:01:42.039> work<00:01:42.429> with

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640 
resting the hoof on while I work with

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.660 
resting the hoof on while I work with
the<00:01:42.789> rasp<00:01:43.050> floor<00:01:44.050> is<00:01:44.259> very<00:01:44.459> cooperative<00:01:45.459> and

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
the rasp floor is very cooperative and

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.119 
the rasp floor is very cooperative and
quite<00:01:46.090> happily<00:01:46.509> stretches<00:01:47.170> her<00:01:47.319> leg<00:01:47.500> forward

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:48.129 
quite happily stretches her leg forward

00:01:48.129 --> 00:01:50.820 
quite happily stretches her leg forward
trimming<00:01:49.060> the<00:01:49.209> hoof<00:01:49.479> to<00:01:49.810> a<00:01:49.869> more<00:01:50.080> symmetrical

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:50.830 
trimming the hoof to a more symmetrical

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.309 
trimming the hoof to a more symmetrical
shape<00:01:51.069> is<00:01:51.250> important<00:01:51.819> as<00:01:52.000> an<00:01:52.629> uneven<00:01:53.080> wolf

00:01:53.309 --> 00:01:53.319 
shape is important as an uneven wolf

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:55.740 
shape is important as an uneven wolf
affects<00:01:53.860> the<00:01:54.069> horse<00:01:54.310> movement<00:01:55.030> and<00:01:55.239> can

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:55.750 
affects the horse movement and can

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.369 
affects the horse movement and can
damage<00:01:56.050> their<00:01:56.619> joints<00:01:57.390> we<00:01:58.390> find<00:01:58.780> that<00:01:59.140> by

00:01:59.369 --> 00:01:59.379 
damage their joints we find that by

00:01:59.379 --> 00:02:01.050 
damage their joints we find that by
trimming<00:01:59.739> the<00:01:59.890> horse<00:02:00.250> with<00:02:00.670> the<00:02:00.700> rasp

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
trimming the horse with the rasp

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.050 
trimming the horse with the rasp
regularly<00:02:01.989> we<00:02:02.500> can<00:02:02.709> manage<00:02:02.950> any<00:02:03.429> uneven

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
regularly we can manage any uneven

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.529 
regularly we can manage any uneven
growth<00:02:04.300> quite<00:02:04.810> well<00:02:05.129> but<00:02:06.129> the<00:02:06.310> hoof<00:02:06.580> has<00:02:07.179> many

00:02:07.529 --> 00:02:07.539 
growth quite well but the hoof has many

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:08.580 
growth quite well but the hoof has many
parts<00:02:08.080> to<00:02:08.170> it

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
parts to it

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.550 
parts to it
some<00:02:08.979> are<00:02:09.099> soft<00:02:09.399> and<00:02:09.640> can<00:02:10.149> get<00:02:10.360> damaged<00:02:10.810> if<00:02:11.110> the

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
some are soft and can get damaged if the

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.600 
some are soft and can get damaged if the
trimming<00:02:11.980> isn't<00:02:12.340> done<00:02:12.489> right<00:02:13.739> so<00:02:14.739> we've<00:02:15.310> done

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
trimming isn't done right so we've done

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.660 
trimming isn't done right so we've done
quite<00:02:15.940> a<00:02:16.060> bit<00:02:16.330> of<00:02:16.450> research<00:02:16.989> and<00:02:17.349> we<00:02:18.340> need<00:02:18.550> to

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
quite a bit of research and we need to

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:30.960 
quite a bit of research and we need to
be<00:02:18.819> careful<00:02:19.360> that<00:02:21.629> make<00:02:22.629> it<00:02:22.810> easier<00:02:25.890> we<00:02:29.970> ask

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
be careful that make it easier we ask

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.050 
be careful that make it easier we ask
our<00:02:31.269> farrier<00:02:31.870> as<00:02:32.140> the<00:02:32.409> expert<00:02:33.010> to<00:02:33.519> check<00:02:33.549> the

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
our farrier as the expert to check the

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:39.750 
our farrier as the expert to check the
Hoff's<00:02:34.299> regularly<00:02:37.890> quite<00:02:38.890> difficult<00:02:39.190> because

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
Hoff's regularly quite difficult because

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.370 
Hoff's regularly quite difficult because
hoof<00:02:40.690> isn't<00:02:41.200> isn't<00:02:41.650> very<00:02:42.490> symmetrical<00:02:43.450> so

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
hoof isn't isn't very symmetrical so

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.670 
hoof isn't isn't very symmetrical so
we've<00:02:44.530> taken<00:02:44.709> quite<00:02:45.069> a<00:02:45.130> lot<00:02:45.370> off<00:02:45.670> here<00:02:46.560> so<00:02:47.560> we

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
we've taken quite a lot off here so we

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:41.850 
hungry horses we'll continue with the
back<00:03:38.230> hoofs

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:41.860 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:43.410

the hoof pliers you have to be quite

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:00.400 
the hoof pliers you have to be quite
confident<00:03:59.000> that<00:03:59.209> you<00:03:59.900> know<00:03:59.930> what<00:04:00.200> you're

doing because you can cut into the soft
bit<00:04:03.200> very<00:04:03.800> easily<00:04:04.160> if<00:04:04.700> if<00:04:05.300> you<00:04:05.750> get<00:04:05.930> it<00:04:06.080> wrong

00:04:06.309 --> 00:04:06.319 
bit very easily if if you get it wrong

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:09.009 
bit very easily if if you get it wrong
and<00:04:06.650> that<00:04:06.830> would<00:04:07.040> hurt<00:04:07.280> the<00:04:07.519> hoof<00:04:07.730> a<00:04:08.000> lot<00:04:08.269> and

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:09.019 
and that would hurt the hoof a lot and

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:16.659 
and that would hurt the hoof a lot and
and<00:04:09.530> could<00:04:09.890> cause<00:04:10.099> infection<00:04:10.790> in<00:04:10.910> the<00:04:11.030> hoof<00:04:15.669> an

trimmed regularly too I maintain a

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:30.760 
trimmed regularly too I maintain a
symmetrical<00:04:28.160> shape<00:04:28.460> is<00:04:28.760> to<00:04:29.720> put<00:04:29.930> metal<00:04:30.410> shoes

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:30.770 
symmetrical shape is to put metal shoes

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:33.580

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:36.370 
on which protect off from wear and tear
but<00:04:34.400> then<00:04:34.580> the<00:04:34.729> hoof<00:04:34.940> would<00:04:35.600> keep<00:04:35.870> on<00:04:36.050> growing

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:36.380 
but then the hoof would keep on growing

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:39.340 
but then the hoof would keep on growing
underneath<00:04:36.740> the<00:04:37.220> shoe<00:04:37.490> so<00:04:38.450> every<00:04:38.780> eight<00:04:39.020> six

to eight weeks the shoe would need to be

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:44.200 
to eight weeks the shoe would need to be

taken off and the hoof would need a
