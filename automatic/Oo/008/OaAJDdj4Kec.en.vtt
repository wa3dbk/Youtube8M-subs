00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:13.000
 show I'm going to explain how to install the 

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:14.830
 minecraft the magical crops for 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.980
 minecraft 1.6 points which is the last 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:19.150
 version so far from the 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:20.590
 last lesson have changed a bit the 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:21.730
 way to install the modes so 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:23.380
 we will need first that you need 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:24.460
 the one of no in graph because for that now 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.320
 nor to this page that travels on the 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:29.300
 description and what they are going to have to 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:31.820
 do is shine here where you say you do 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:34.190
 once you click on there they come to the 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.290
 first version of the 6.2 point microphone 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.540
 so far is this when you watch the video 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:41.540
 they do not come out good new choose the manual 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:44.079
 by ars this forge 9.10 zero point for 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:46.790
 minecraft 1.6 points click on that option 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:48.589
 and they come here and here it is very important that 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.510
 download the install either from to 

00:00:48.589 --> 00:00:52.760
 direct playÃ³n as far as possible to not follow 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.650
 Fly like this, there is money left to 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.120
 developers I will not do it 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:57.800
 because I have already downloaded it from the desk 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.989
 but you download a file like this 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.370
 a file left then they 're going to have to 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:02.420
 come to the page of the musical crops that 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.030
 I'll also leave it down in the 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.740
 description 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.110
 and within that page they're going to have to 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:11.200
 go down a little more and look for no law test 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:15.400
 because the latest version 1.5 point 1.2 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:17.080
 but here is this way minecraft 1.6 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.759
 points this is the version that you that 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.979
 you have to download to click here 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:22.659
 musical language crops will carry up and what 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:24.130
 they are going to download again I am going to 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:25.540
 leave the page because I already 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.100
 I have downloaded and good once 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:29.950
 let's have these two 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.420
 files the first thing we're going to do is 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:35.229
 shine in the minecraft force file 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:38.050
 install double click urges the client a 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:39.910
 time they are with installing those things 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:41.020
 but I'm not going to do it for them 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:43.420
 you do not have to do it 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.909
 install click and read accept 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.229
 there is going to tell you that it was installed 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:50.310
 satisfactorily and what they are going to do 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:51.780
 now it is to open your minecraft folder 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.400
 this is to verify that it is 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.130
 installed 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:58.650
 and transformed leo etcetera and here below 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.190
 where it says loading profile 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:03.560
 is going to detect me that I have a 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:07.380
 new profile so you can sometimes 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:09.509
 ask for this and sometimes it does not work 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.500
 sometimes they are asked for one and sometimes they are 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:14.360
 ask when I click on the new 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.940
 the new profile but good as you see here 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:19.250
 they have their old profile and their profile does not 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.890
 which is the profile of forge now close 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:25.400
 here and how the old days are going to go 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:27.730
 a percentage of app data percentage 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.080
 let's go to the point folder minecraft 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.640
 and once between the folder point way 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.380
 we will lower the mods folder if not 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.900
 have you believe yourselves 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:38.210
 clark in a folder with the name we have 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.980
 we are going to sexenal magical crops 

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:41.510
 and we're going to put it inside the folder 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.180
 a lot once we have it in 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.700
 we close this and we go back to execute the 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.960
 minecraft we are going to execute is going to 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.610
 load the installer 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:51.560
 as I was telling you if you did not ask them like me 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:53.390
 instantly record the forge 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.800
 they will be asked when they select here 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.750
 they give him 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.250
 ay profile to which they can put magical 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:01.090

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:04.400

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.939
 video in which they ask us for a review of the 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:30.010
