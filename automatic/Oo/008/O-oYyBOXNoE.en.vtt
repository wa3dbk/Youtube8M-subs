00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
holding device to life and necessarily

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.819 
holding device to life and necessarily
look<00:00:47.489> like<00:00:47.520> this<00:00:48.170> but<00:00:49.170> basically<00:00:49.410> you<00:00:49.800> just

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
alright so now we got our water then we

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.950 
alright so now we got our water then we
have<00:01:41.150> our<00:01:41.299> lava<00:01:42.490> I'll<00:01:43.490> set<00:01:44.030> up<00:01:44.060> placing<00:01:44.659> their

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
have our lava I'll set up placing their

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.390 
have our lava I'll set up placing their
now<00:01:45.320> we're<00:01:45.440> going<00:01:45.530> to<00:01:45.590> start<00:01:45.860> one<00:01:46.009> up<00:01:46.100> in<00:01:46.250> this

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:46.400 
now we're going to start one up in this

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.050 
now we're going to start one up in this
room<00:01:47.740> start<00:01:48.740> making<00:01:49.040> some<00:01:49.220> section<00:01:49.700> now<00:01:49.909> we're

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
room start making some section now we're

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.830 
room start making some section now we're
going<00:01:50.180> to<00:01:50.240> do<00:01:50.299> this<00:01:50.479> is<00:01:51.009> so<00:01:52.149> pretty<00:01:53.149> pretty

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
going to do this is so pretty pretty

00:01:53.840 --> 00:02:02.889 
going to do this is so pretty pretty
simple<00:01:54.490> basically<00:01:55.490> what<00:01:55.670> you<00:01:55.789> do<00:01:56.119> is<00:02:01.899> just

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:02.899 
simple basically what you do is just

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:07.960 
simple basically what you do is just
dump<00:02:03.740> these<00:02:05.590> obvious<00:02:06.590> iron<00:02:06.830> that<00:02:07.190> that<00:02:07.460> bump

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
dump these obvious iron that that bump

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.979 
dump these obvious iron that that bump
into<00:02:08.420> your<00:02:09.250> storage<00:02:10.780> compartment<00:02:11.780> things

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:11.989 
into your storage compartment things

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:17.949 
into your storage compartment things
whatever<00:02:12.350> you<00:02:12.650> want<00:02:12.860> to<00:02:12.950> call<00:02:16.540> go<00:02:17.540> and<00:02:17.720> dump

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959 
whatever you want to call go and dump

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:21.370 
whatever you want to call go and dump
them<00:02:18.080> in<00:02:18.230> here<00:02:18.610> so<00:02:19.610> you<00:02:19.670> now<00:02:19.880> have<00:02:19.910> a<00:02:20.380> nice

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380 
them in here so you now have a nice

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.840 
them in here so you now have a nice
infinite<00:02:22.100> source<00:02:22.370> of<00:02:22.640> lava<00:02:23.600> and<00:02:23.780> water

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
infinite source of lava and water

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:28.449 
infinite source of lava and water
alright<00:02:26.140> so<00:02:27.140> next<00:02:27.380> thing<00:02:27.530> I<00:02:27.739> need<00:02:27.860> to<00:02:27.890> do<00:02:28.130> is

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:28.459 
alright so next thing I need to do is

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:32.220 
alright so next thing I need to do is
build<00:02:29.299> a<00:02:29.450> crisscross<00:02:29.870> pattern<00:02:30.970> all

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
build a crisscross pattern all

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.660 
build a crisscross pattern all
throughout<00:02:33.230> this<00:02:33.650> you'll<00:02:34.190> see<00:02:34.370> why<00:02:34.519> in<00:02:34.549> a

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
throughout this you'll see why in a

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.190 
throughout this you'll see why in a
little<00:02:34.910> bit<00:02:35.650> but<00:02:37.120> go<00:02:38.120> ahead<00:02:38.150> and<00:02:38.450> fill<00:02:39.079> it

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
little bit but go ahead and fill it

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:45.819 
little bit but go ahead and fill it
first<00:02:39.620> cross<00:02:39.890> pattern<00:02:40.760> just<00:02:41.239> like<00:02:41.360> this<00:02:44.829> all

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:45.829 
first cross pattern just like this all

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:49.479 
first cross pattern just like this all
right<00:02:46.280> I<00:02:46.640> like<00:02:47.030> that<00:02:47.180> our<00:02:48.010> crisscross<00:02:49.010> pattern

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:49.489 
right I like that our crisscross pattern

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:52.539 
right I like that our crisscross pattern
going<00:02:49.730> on<00:02:49.910> you<00:02:50.060> off<00:02:50.750> the<00:02:51.109> routes<00:02:51.430> so<00:02:52.430> we're

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:52.549 
going on you off the routes so we're

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:54.460 
going on you off the routes so we're
ready<00:02:52.640> to<00:02:52.760> start<00:02:52.850> making<00:02:53.329> some<00:02:53.480> city<00:02:53.780> I<00:02:54.079> don't

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
ready to start making some city I don't

00:02:54.470 --> 00:03:00.789 
ready to start making some city I don't
wanna<00:02:54.620> do<00:02:54.799> is<00:02:55.750> take<00:02:56.750> out<00:02:58.930> as<00:02:59.930> many<00:03:00.200> buckets<00:03:00.680> as
