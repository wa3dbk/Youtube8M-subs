is a party piece and I think that's

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.100 
is a party piece and I think that's
important<00:01:05.040> at<00:01:05.129> this<00:01:05.250> time<00:01:05.309> of<00:01:05.670> year<00:01:06.000> and<00:01:06.270> not

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
important at this time of year and not

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.700 
important at this time of year and not
least<00:01:07.380> because<00:01:08.369> this<00:01:08.909> means<00:01:09.299> you<00:01:10.260> can<00:01:10.500> make

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
least because this means you can make

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.260 
least because this means you can make
this<00:01:10.979> and<00:01:11.360> turn<00:01:12.360> any<00:01:12.740> meal<00:01:13.740> of<00:01:13.920> leftovers<00:01:14.640> into

this and turn any meal of leftovers into

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.700 
this and turn any meal of leftovers into
a<00:01:15.299> feast<00:01:16.759> another<00:01:17.759> thing<00:01:18.750> in<00:01:18.869> its<00:01:18.990> favor<00:01:19.320> is
