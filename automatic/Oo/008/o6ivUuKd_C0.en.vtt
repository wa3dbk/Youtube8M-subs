00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.400
 that we are here with a 

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.279
 really legendary 

00:00:08.279 --> 00:00:11.150
 a craft is totally treated 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:13.350
 of an aircraft that was precisely 

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:14.340
 constructed 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.289
 in the city to prepare we're going to talk 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.620
 with the director of the project the engineer cabos de debord olic 

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:22.750
 I'm going to tell you about this one hasbro 504 carlos 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:25.739
 What does this mean for a company behind Argentina? 

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:29.009
 good as you see the company pulsan was characterized 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:31.220
 I make them a very interesting challenge 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:33.170
 haiti this other more 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:36.310
 this plane is a plane of 1913 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:38.510
 n of English origin 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:41.820
 although we do not manufacture as a replica with the original materials 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.510
 that respecting all the nautical why 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.240
 and for that, a lot of work has been done in everything 

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:53.280
 computing flat computing and really carpentry and blacksmithing 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.380
 It is really craft 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.760
 that is why the materials that will be used 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.579
 will be urban avenue was a bit of the history of Avro 504 a plane I 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.680
 many years ago 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.680
 Esteve was initially that manufactured 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.260
 with intentions to defect 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:12.700
 a venezuela 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.150
 so that they make you sneak me royally has a skate for the pilot 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:18.460
 no capote the plane should 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:20.190
 so that it does not touch they say the floor 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:24.040
 and is built in very light wood we are talking about a pine is cross 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:25.340
 origin 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.250
 Canadian Americans 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.570
 that weighs exactly half that which would start a standard pine and known for 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:33.020
 we 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.150
 in the long life part that part where in that appointment more reinforcement is 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:38.110
 conceived 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.800
 in a right more ash the brake mother also very hard very noble very 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:42.650
 elastic 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:44.410
 based on the impacts 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:48.810
 and part of that because of the pillars of Allah is built in 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.390
 humanities in the hand gaal a defeat of leisure with us but not mature 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.180
 intentions to support those with the greatest impact of the posts 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.359
 cotano sinde the engine he has some peculiarity 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.050
 what is the performance or what are the main characteristics of an engine 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:06.340
 from what I see radial 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:11.570
 This mode still has 160 hp and has 160 kilos, so in the weight ratio 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:13.649
 power of an airplane 

00:02:13.649 --> 00:02:17.129
 and has it will move 1850 turn 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:20.959
 it was with that power and with that revolution in a plane that flies 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:23.629
 again at low speed 

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:27.090
 has its characteristic maximum mendaro perfomance of the 100 miles 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.239
 per hour 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:30.169
 as corners the project 

00:02:30.169 --> 00:02:34.679
 he augured 504 a few years ago and over here in parana that we do not have 

00:02:34.679 --> 00:02:37.679
 Juan Antonio was close to the company, Mr. Jorge Jorge. 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:40.649
 in another unit with air force people 

00:02:40.649 --> 00:02:44.899
 who decide to build this plane because it was the first airplane that was manufactured 

00:02:44.899 --> 00:02:48.179
 here in the military factory in the city of córdoba 

00:02:48.179 --> 00:02:51.339
 and of that 100 specimens were built, of which this moment in Argentina 

00:02:51.339 --> 00:02:54.339
 there is absolutely none 

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:58.510
 then there was a lack I do not know the time of the project 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.939
 How was the project how it started or what are the first steps that 

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:07.390
 perform until you get after a long time of martino to have this 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:08.469
 model here 

00:03:08.469 --> 00:03:09.929
 if given the 

00:03:09.929 --> 00:03:13.119
 the little information we had about this plane that we built a 

00:03:13.119 --> 00:03:16.739
 scale model 1 1 exactly the same nothing more than materials not 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:17.739
 aeronautical 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:21.030
 this allowed us to adjust all the planes that nobody wants to learn a little 

00:03:21.029 --> 00:03:22.949
 this office of day does not 

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:26.549
 is not now in pointing to any school then we manufacture the 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:30.930
 mockup the dome minor year was the previous step to be able to manufacture this airplane 

00:03:30.929 --> 00:03:34.239
 take off the first plane that goes olarte we calculate lima good in 15 days 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:34.989
 past 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:36.449
 in 15 days 

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:39.449
 on August 15 of the flying new podium to achieve 

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:42.959
 fly in this time now on this date that was planned due to still 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:45.199
 they will avoid the engine of the munco cine tv 

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:47.410
 he had a skirt 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:51.020
 no no lifts to appear from always we decided for now 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:54.719
 postpone the project until I love it with all the security they need hours 

00:03:54.719 --> 00:03:57.659
 beyond this the technological advances that it has 

00:03:57.659 --> 00:04:02.030
 today and that of renault and that is used in the renaut and cafes a really vicious 

00:04:02.029 --> 00:04:06.159
 incredible what the artisans do added reads like this the carpenters 

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:11.439
 anabolic engineers and all people that make up the family of san 

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:15.060
 argentina chiroque telepresence will arrive in 3d is not sow good friend of the 

00:04:15.059 --> 00:04:18.059
 character is noted for its craftsmanship there are not very young people 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:19.880
 very enthusiastic 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:21.439
 of this type of work 

00:04:21.439 --> 00:04:24.740
 for Carlos thank you very much and congratulations for the work 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:28.560
 that they carry out from sara argentina efe in favor of aviation and 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:29.490
 aeronautics 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.199
 steal a taste thank you very much 

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:34.320
 we were with engineer Cape of Bórtoli is the director 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:35.500
 our sector 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.470
 del cabro 504 manufactured in parana 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:41.960
 precisely in the hangars of the second air brigade the capital 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.720
