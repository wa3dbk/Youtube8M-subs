 the viewer if the personality plus a drawn one of our history more

 cuts he has won a professional photo essay if you check it out now 

00:00:12.989 --> 00:00:15.989
 I always did programs living with the father was disarmed 

00:00:16.909 --> 00:00:20.560
 the little matter of another company that had a professional book, right? 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.659
 in the study that takes more time 

00:00:22.659 --> 00:00:26.249
 I do not know what you want but you can lose it in the state 

00:00:26.249 --> 00:00:29.069
 So I told you to be in touch with me. 

00:00:29.069 --> 00:00:32.069
 is called 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:41.540
 to have a stronger renato team 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:42.720
 and it was the work 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.920
 complicated because the weather was very good so 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.920
 but I give a lot but do more to be connected to the selection 

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:57.950
 technically they do not make a big difference if you photograph a man and 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:00.249
 A woman I think is Portuguese. 

00:01:00.249 --> 00:01:04.900
 the makers of hair with fans we highly non-muse people 

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:09.909
 is finally some that techniques of whiskey agent of the used in riad I 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:13.580
 I think they are but with the mind the same with air but there are exceptions made to the 

00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:17.679
 A woman who used to spend marquinho before is one thing but we find 

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:20.679
 ninth in the male audience 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:28.650
 I think they 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.710
 probably good 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:32.740
 often more treated 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.470
 if you have this tendency the day d 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:39.120
 hold on a little did not because I'm a photographer woman 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:43.880
 This is what makes it a little difficult, but I do not have it or not. 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.880
 have had difficulties also to make do today 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.930
 euzÃ©bio and kicked in danger of getting a small piece of the couple celebrated this 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.760
 paulista in the rock 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.900
 it's a common procedure 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:07.090
 the marking saints still not implemented in the middle of the day 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.400
 The case was different for me, it's fashionable and bringing drugs for men. 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.449
 also 

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:15.449
 by the way we can make a very 

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:18.309
 but that is not wrong 

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:20.579
 It's that I remember never again. 

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:24.749
 but if it depends on him the pair would have of the army near the college because 

00:02:24.749 --> 00:02:27.049
 they happen very good I have to be 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:30.009
 I count with a post that certain companies that have 

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:33.009
 two days later and even internally 

00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:37.139
 strong and it stays up easy the selection is very good pointed out 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:41.349
 he talked to nobody said 

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:49.519
 with the new rules that meet demands 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:54.469
 - we had a lot of race that is comprehensive and to protocol I am a 

00:02:54.469 --> 00:02:57.650
 My husband's nice face, then I'll do it but I do not think 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.859
 fashion trend depending on the segment if it is not 

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:04.839
 Specific models split by a study based on walkway parts 

00:03:04.839 --> 00:03:07.919
 exotic different conferences 

00:03:07.919 --> 00:03:13.289
 found what to do in that pf standard had hugo in the monumental alaska 

00:03:13.289 --> 00:03:17.539
 I do not know if the person is there without I gave you a jump six months of work that I 

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:21.959
 I'm lucky they do not like it I think it's going to affect their quality and I think 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:24.959
 which has nothing definite 

00:03:29.249 --> 00:03:32.310
 this visit is to further intensify 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.469
 with the arrival of these objectives 

00:03:34.469 --> 00:03:36.929
 and this we always seek 

00:03:36.929 --> 00:03:38.679
 even because it is a good material 

00:03:38.679 --> 00:03:42.999
 but can deny this very definitely helps out of the terminals 

00:03:42.999 --> 00:03:46.929
 program happens this I believe that every day to day 

00:03:50.219 --> 00:03:51.080
 reformed 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:52.090
 I'm talking here's a family.
