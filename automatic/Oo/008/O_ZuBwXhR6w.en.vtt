 a nice surprise this mazda 6 0 of the 

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:12.880
 conduct 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:14.680
 really something 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.150
 comfortable 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:20.290
 silent and 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:22.670
 as for gilles it's true cars 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:24.320
 little like people very quickly 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.520
 in fact we have a few opinions 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.300
 seconds of a first feeling 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.500
 to learn it not confirm and already yesterday in 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.120
 learner I had found that very 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.770
 pleasant and it is confirmed over the 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:35.050
 kilometers 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:39.860
 Turkey is relaxing which is 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:43.090
 relaxing and that at the same time I 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:45.140
 connected to the road is a good compromise 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.060
 as soon as we have created a little we can play a 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.900
 little with pallets 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.490
 it resumes very well 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.630
 it really is 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:56.070
 it's nice the car and not too much 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:59.620
 heavy and well held in the armchairs 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:01.390
 without really doing a good job that is 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:04.390
 pity for mazda is that it is very 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:06.070
 little known what they have products 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:09.340
 they are 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:12.820
 but much better than when they were weak 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.930
 voice notoriety on this type of sedan 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:15.340
 which is not much 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.690
 today in France in terms of volume 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:21.160
 for them it's 1000 cars 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:22.510
 I hope in 2000 in 2013 but what the 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:27.220
 will choose will not be disappointed because we 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:28.510
 really has something google we have 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.000
 of the place a big car is a 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.620
 some straddling other slots 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.150
 this 4 meter eighty six a mulch 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.150
 exceeds the audi a4 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.790
 it's never obvious when we're on 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:42.159
 two slots and in addition with an image 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:46.340
 brand 

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:49.159
 faye fame low laughing because 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:52.689
 in fact I imagine with bleeding in 

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:52.689
 his pumps hiding under jean plagne 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.860
 and 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:05.980
 he makes his own opinion is not 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:08.080
 on the liver of the brands he added there 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:11.590
 where on this kind of cars we see 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:12.220
 still the differences with the super 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.020
 premium 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.960
 it's about certain details like the 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:19.690
 design these parts yes the market the lever 

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:21.730
 speed the little bar that the box 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.620
 this is a design from 20 years ago 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.500
 what is it that when you are on 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.100
 a nice melody shad less less than 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:31.210
 little things 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:33.820
 it is also true for example of 

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:36.000
 the touch screen which is very good 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:36.000
 anyway 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:40.660
 but the wii on the sides usually 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.890
 now all this has been integrated yes and 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:43.930
 then a ladies button still have 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:46.930
 the impression the debt in the 80s 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:54.250
 and that the Japanese there have always been this 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:56.560
 this side also comes out of the commandos of the 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:04:04.290
 stuff chiadÃ© then else next we get 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:04.290
 finds that the Germans 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:08.459
 now work in lesser 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:09.540
 every detail the press to you jumps 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:11.910
 in eyes when we compare cars 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:15.950
 it can be fun but it's 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:15.950
 that can put some people off
