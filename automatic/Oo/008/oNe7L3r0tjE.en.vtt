of my sound activated so as you can see
light<00:04:03.810> passes<00:04:04.290> through<00:04:04.850> pretty<00:04:05.850> good<00:04:06.260> so<00:04:07.790> what

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
light passes through pretty good so what

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:13.370 
light passes through pretty good so what
that<00:04:08.820> being<00:04:09.180> said<00:04:10.040> is<00:04:11.329> transparent<00:04:12.329> first<00:04:13.170> and
