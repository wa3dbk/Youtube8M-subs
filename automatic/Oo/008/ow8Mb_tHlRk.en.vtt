00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:12.530
 the ballerina bun is getting more and more 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:14.240
 that's why today I 'm going to teach you 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:16.039
 how to make this monkey so chic that 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:19.240
 stylize very much 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:19.240
 I'm going to look for inspiration 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.500
 first let's start making the line 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:30.220
 to one side choose the side that most 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.220
 favor 

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:36.329
 and we will go combing the hair and 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:39.290
 applying lacquer to fix it 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:43.880
 it has to be very polished 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:46.960
 we take the 10 and without fear 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.960
 let's apply 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.280
 the we come 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:09.320
 and when you have it, we hold it with a 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.320
 rubber 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.960
 if you see that you have not left everything 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:22.500
 polished that you want then you retire it and 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:26.330
 calm that if we combed the led it 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.330
 remove with a simple brushing 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:34.600
 and we repeat it we started again what 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.600
 we combed 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.520
 we apply lacquer 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:59.560
 now we take the queue and we're going to 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.560
 Roll it up to make the bow 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.930
 we entered the tips 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:18.930
 and we hold it with open forks 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.170
 we apply a little lacquer 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.530
 and now we could apply directly 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:43.110
 the lacquer 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:46.560
 or with the comb 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:48.980
 we apply it on the comb and polish everything 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.980
 monkey 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.099
 and ready 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.879
 we make the line to the side with the comb 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:07.290
 we collect the hair with a low ponytail 

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:10.019
 we roll up the pigtail and hold it with 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:13.879
 bow hairpins and finally we fix 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:13.879
 with extra strong linet lacquer 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:20.319
 you have seen how easy and elegant 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:21.700
 this hairstyle and many more are you 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:24.400
 waiting in the channel of l'orÃ©al 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:26.349
 remember before combing you look at yourself in the 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.819
 mirror and give yourself one because I'm worth it 

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:29.819
 you'll see how good it feels
