most powerful console they tend to this

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.890 
most powerful console they tend to this
go<00:01:14.580> for<00:01:14.790> more<00:01:15.530> innovative<00:01:16.530> sort<00:01:16.830> of<00:01:16.950> ideas<00:01:17.900> but

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
go for more innovative sort of ideas but

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.950 
go for more innovative sort of ideas but
hopefully<00:01:19.770> that<00:01:20.009> it<00:01:20.250> will<00:01:20.400> be<00:01:20.549> in<00:01:20.960> 1080p

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
hopefully that it will be in 1080p

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.780 
hopefully that it will be in 1080p
because<00:01:22.380> they<00:01:22.590> we<00:01:22.830> for<00:01:23.250> those<00:01:23.430> of<00:01:23.610> you<00:01:23.700> that

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
because they we for those of you that

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.039 
because they we for those of you that
don't<00:01:23.939> know<00:01:24.090> I'm<00:01:24.299> sure<00:01:24.330> all<00:01:24.570> of<00:01:24.689> you<00:01:24.840> don't

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
don't know I'm sure all of you don't

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.350 
don't know I'm sure all of you don't
play<00:01:25.229> it<00:01:25.380> but<00:01:25.530> it<00:01:26.400> actually<00:01:26.820> only<00:01:26.909> goes<00:01:27.119> up<00:01:27.150> to

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
play it but it actually only goes up to

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.690 
play it but it actually only goes up to
480p<00:01:28.049> so<00:01:28.560> you<00:01:28.650> can't<00:01:28.950> actually<00:01:29.130> play<00:01:29.400> it<00:01:29.549> maybe

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
480p so you can't actually play it maybe

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.660 
480p so you can't actually play it maybe
it's<00:01:29.930> 560<00:01:30.930> P<00:01:31.110> I<00:01:31.350> don't<00:01:31.680> know<00:01:31.770> but<00:01:31.950> you<00:01:32.400> can't

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
it's 560 P I don't know but you can't

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.590 
it's 560 P I don't know but you can't
actually<00:01:32.939> play<00:01:33.299> it<00:01:33.540> in<00:01:33.810> in<00:01:34.530> HD<00:01:35.180> so<00:01:36.180> that's<00:01:36.360> that

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
actually play it in in HD so that's that

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.480 
actually play it in in HD so that's that
you<00:01:36.720> know<00:01:36.750> that's<00:01:37.020> pretty<00:01:37.590> bad<00:01:37.860> in<00:01:38.100> terms<00:01:38.130> of

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
you know that's pretty bad in terms of

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.580 
you know that's pretty bad in terms of
graphics<00:01:38.970> and<00:01:39.299> they<00:01:40.020> definitely<00:01:40.229> need<00:01:40.500> to

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
graphics and they definitely need to

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.109 
graphics and they definitely need to
step<00:01:40.829> it<00:01:41.009> up<00:01:41.130> and<00:01:41.310> I<00:01:41.400> think<00:01:41.579> they've<00:01:41.729> realized

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
step it up and I think they've realized

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.230 
step it up and I think they've realized
that<00:01:42.240> it's<00:01:42.450> time<00:01:42.750> to<00:01:43.530> try<00:01:43.829> and<00:01:44.009> move<00:01:44.909> move

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
that it's time to try and move move

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.840 
that it's time to try and move move
things<00:01:45.479> along<00:01:45.600> a<00:01:45.750> bit<00:01:45.990> so<00:01:46.619> it's<00:01:47.460> got<00:01:47.820> a

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
things along a bit so it's got a

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.319 
things along a bit so it's got a
codename<00:01:48.299> it's<00:01:48.810> called<00:01:49.200> Project<00:01:49.799> Cafe<00:01:50.490> why<00:01:51.000> I

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
codename it's called Project Cafe why I

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.050 
codename it's called Project Cafe why I
have<00:01:51.600> no<00:01:51.840> idea<00:01:52.200> I<00:01:52.890> don't<00:01:53.640> know<00:01:53.759> if<00:01:53.850> it's<00:01:53.970> got

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
have no idea I don't know if it's got

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.670 
have no idea I don't know if it's got
anything<00:01:54.240> to<00:01:54.420> do<00:01:54.540> with<00:01:54.570> like<00:01:54.840> drinking<00:01:55.259> tea<00:01:55.530> or

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
anything to do with like drinking tea or

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.300 
anything to do with like drinking tea or
something<00:01:56.040> but<00:01:56.250> I<00:01:56.280> have<00:01:56.549> no<00:01:57.000> clue<00:01:58.219> but<00:01:59.219> the

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
something but I have no clue but the

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.310 
something but I have no clue but the
biggest<00:01:59.520> thing<00:01:59.729> about<00:01:59.820> it<00:02:00.119> is<00:02:00.240> the<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.990> idea

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
biggest thing about it is the the idea

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.010 
biggest thing about it is the the idea
that<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.770> new<00:02:01.950> controller<00:02:02.750> similar<00:02:03.750> to<00:02:03.869> the

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
that the new controller similar to the

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.600 
that the new controller similar to the
Wii<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.200> way<00:02:04.500> that<00:02:04.680> the<00:02:04.829> controller<00:02:05.219> was<00:02:05.430> such

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
Wii the way that the controller was such

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.719 
Wii the way that the controller was such
an<00:02:05.820> an<00:02:06.390> innovative<00:02:07.049> idea<00:02:07.409> and<00:02:08.009> so<00:02:08.250> different

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
an an innovative idea and so different

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.639 
an an innovative idea and so different
the<00:02:09.209> new<00:02:09.479> controller<00:02:09.959> it's<00:02:10.229> kind<00:02:10.410> of<00:02:10.470> has<00:02:10.619> a

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
the new controller it's kind of has a

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.680 
the new controller it's kind of has a
bit<00:02:10.709> like<00:02:11.430> you<00:02:11.879> know<00:02:12.000> you<00:02:12.060> know<00:02:12.330> when<00:02:12.450> you<00:02:12.540> see

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
bit like you know you know when you see

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.580 
bit like you know you know when you see
those<00:02:12.810> little<00:02:12.959> mock

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
those little mock

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.770 
those little mock
versions<00:02:14.220> of<00:02:14.430> fate<00:02:14.640> consoles<00:02:15.180> and<00:02:15.390> they<00:02:15.510> sort

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
versions of fate consoles and they sort

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.900 
versions of fate consoles and they sort
of<00:02:15.810> put<00:02:16.230> a<00:02:16.290> screen<00:02:16.770> on<00:02:16.800> the<00:02:17.069> controller<00:02:17.489> this

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
of put a screen on the controller this

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:18.830 
of put a screen on the controller this
is<00:02:17.970> actually<00:02:18.390> what<00:02:18.480> they're<00:02:18.599> going<00:02:18.750> for

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
is actually what they're going for

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.510 
is actually what they're going for
they're<00:02:19.140> actually<00:02:19.410> going<00:02:19.560> for<00:02:19.770> a<00:02:19.860> screen<00:02:20.250> on<00:02:20.459> a

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
they're actually going for a screen on a

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.699 
they're actually going for a screen on a
controller<00:02:20.670> that<00:02:21.330> wasn't<00:02:21.959> rumored<00:02:22.319> anyway

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
controller that wasn't rumored anyway

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:25.130 
controller that wasn't rumored anyway
and<00:02:22.950> then<00:02:23.190> here<00:02:24.150> they<00:02:24.300> was<00:02:24.510> rumored<00:02:24.959> there's

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
and then here they was rumored there's

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.680 
and then here they was rumored there's
going<00:02:25.260> to<00:02:25.319> be<00:02:25.380> a<00:02:25.470> six<00:02:25.800> inch<00:02:26.040> screen<00:02:26.510> with<00:02:27.510> it's

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
going to be a six inch screen with it's

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.120 
going to be a six inch screen with it's
gonna<00:02:27.750> have<00:02:27.900> buttons<00:02:28.290> on<00:02:28.410> it<00:02:28.440> on<00:02:28.620> the<00:02:28.709> side<00:02:28.890> as

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
gonna have buttons on it on the side as

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.160 
gonna have buttons on it on the side as
well<00:02:29.370> but<00:02:29.760> it's<00:02:30.120> also<00:02:30.180> skinnier<00:02:30.540> I<00:02:30.780> think<00:02:31.050> it's

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
well but it's also skinnier I think it's

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.190 
well but it's also skinnier I think it's
a<00:02:31.230> touchscreen<00:02:31.860> it<00:02:32.069> must<00:02:32.220> be<00:02:32.310> a<00:02:32.340> touch<00:02:32.550> screen

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
a touchscreen it must be a touch screen

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.570 
a touchscreen it must be a touch screen
controller<00:02:34.200> so<00:02:34.620> it's<00:02:35.130> going<00:02:35.310> to<00:02:35.370> sort<00:02:35.489> of

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
controller so it's going to sort of

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.370 
controller so it's going to sort of
incorporate<00:02:36.180> these<00:02:36.360> ideas<00:02:36.420> where<00:02:37.140> you<00:02:37.230> can

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
incorporate these ideas where you can

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.890 
incorporate these ideas where you can
actually<00:02:37.530> sort<00:02:37.980> touch<00:02:38.610> your<00:02:38.819> controller<00:02:39.269> for

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
actually sort touch your controller for

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.210 
actually sort touch your controller for
various<00:02:40.380> you<00:02:41.280> know<00:02:41.310> sort<00:02:41.610> of<00:02:41.640> in-game<00:02:43.220> actions

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
various you know sort of in-game actions

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.880 
various you know sort of in-game actions
and<00:02:44.580> it<00:02:44.790> gives<00:02:45.300> users<00:02:45.690> sort<00:02:46.080> of<00:02:46.140> more<00:02:46.410> more

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
and it gives users sort of more more

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.520 
and it gives users sort of more more
options<00:02:47.250> to<00:02:47.400> interact<00:02:47.760> with<00:02:47.880> the<00:02:47.970> game<00:02:48.180> and

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
options to interact with the game and

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.570 
options to interact with the game and
apparently<00:02:49.530> will<00:02:50.069> have<00:02:50.190> backwards

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
apparently will have backwards

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.729 
apparently will have backwards
compatibility<00:02:51.150> with<00:02:51.390> both<00:02:51.780> the<00:02:51.989> Wii<00:02:52.170> and<00:02:52.350> the

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
compatibility with both the Wii and the

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:55.340 
compatibility with both the Wii and the
Gamecube<00:02:53.370> for<00:02:54.299> any<00:02:54.420> of<00:02:54.569> those<00:02:54.660> guys<00:02:54.989> that<00:02:55.019> do

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
Gamecube for any of those guys that do

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.910 
Gamecube for any of those guys that do
want<00:02:55.500> to<00:02:55.680> plug<00:02:56.220> in<00:02:56.370> and<00:02:56.519> play<00:02:56.610> some<00:02:56.940> old<00:02:57.060> games

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
want to plug in and play some old games

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.610 
want to plug in and play some old games
so<00:02:58.920> it<00:02:59.010> sounds<00:02:59.280> pretty<00:02:59.519> interesting<00:02:59.819> and<00:03:00.360> is

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
so it sounds pretty interesting and is

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.690 
so it sounds pretty interesting and is
all<00:03:01.620> this<00:03:01.799> is<00:03:01.920> kind<00:03:02.099> of<00:03:02.130> rumored<00:03:02.489> at<00:03:02.610> the

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
all this is kind of rumored at the

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.640 
all this is kind of rumored at the
moment<00:03:03.120> I<00:03:03.299> think<00:03:03.660> the<00:03:03.900> code<00:03:04.380> name<00:03:04.620> project

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
moment I think the code name project

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.820 
moment I think the code name project
Cafe<00:03:05.370> is<00:03:05.430> kind<00:03:05.880> of<00:03:05.940> like<00:03:06.180> the<00:03:06.959> most<00:03:07.470> retarded

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
Cafe is kind of like the most retarded

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.620 
Cafe is kind of like the most retarded
sounding<00:03:08.519> bit<00:03:08.670> about<00:03:08.910> it's<00:03:09.269> actually<00:03:09.540> the

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
sounding bit about it's actually the

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.009 
sounding bit about it's actually the
most<00:03:10.519> the<00:03:11.519> most<00:03:11.670> official<00:03:12.239> bit<00:03:12.360> about<00:03:12.599> it<00:03:12.780> but

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019 
most the most official bit about it but

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:15.440 
most the most official bit about it but
some<00:03:13.489> it's<00:03:14.489> probably<00:03:14.970> going<00:03:15.060> to<00:03:15.120> be<00:03:15.180> more

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
some it's probably going to be more

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.599 
some it's probably going to be more
information<00:03:15.599> given<00:03:16.380> out<00:03:16.530> at<00:03:16.739> this<00:03:16.920> year's<00:03:17.250> e3

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:17.609 
information given out at this year's e3

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:20.539 
information given out at this year's e3
event<00:03:18.060> and<00:03:18.890> it's<00:03:19.890> probably<00:03:20.190> going<00:03:20.430> to<00:03:20.489> be

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:20.549 
event and it's probably going to be

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:24.319 
event and it's probably going to be
released<00:03:20.970> next<00:03:21.570> year<00:03:21.989> so<00:03:22.609> 2012<00:03:23.609> sort<00:03:24.060> of<00:03:24.120> near

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:24.329 
released next year so 2012 sort of near

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:27.110 
released next year so 2012 sort of near
the<00:03:24.359> Christmas<00:03:25.109> period<00:03:25.579> it's<00:03:26.579> sort<00:03:26.940> of<00:03:26.970> for

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
the Christmas period it's sort of for

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.880 
the Christmas period it's sort of for
consoles<00:03:27.480> going<00:03:27.720> to<00:03:27.780> sort<00:03:27.959> of<00:03:27.989> five<00:03:28.230> six<00:03:28.650> year

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
consoles going to sort of five six year

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.910 
consoles going to sort of five six year
cycle<00:03:29.400> and<00:03:29.609> the<00:03:30.359> cycle<00:03:30.810> now<00:03:30.959> is<00:03:31.109> sort<00:03:31.319> of<00:03:31.350> up<00:03:31.560> so

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
cycle and the cycle now is sort of up so

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.890 
cycle and the cycle now is sort of up so
it's<00:03:32.069> all<00:03:32.220> we<00:03:32.700> do<00:03:32.970> a<00:03:33.000> new<00:03:33.269> console<00:03:33.750> from

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
it's all we do a new console from

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.970 
it's all we do a new console from
Nintendo<00:03:34.019> anyway<00:03:34.709> and<00:03:35.329> as<00:03:36.329> for<00:03:36.690> the<00:03:36.989> ps3<00:03:37.440> guys

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660
