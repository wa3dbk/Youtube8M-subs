 we are going to open our photoshop 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:03.220
 we give ourselves let's wait a moment to 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:07.580
 to load because I already above 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:09.260
 I was going to use a picture of myself 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.240
 you can perform in any 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:14.960
 photo that you have, I will give in 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:17.440
 file open I'm going to select a photo 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.420
 I give in opening 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.400
 once done this we will select 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.860
 the tool where I am pointing 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:28.860
 of the cut out clipping tool 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:31.200
 we select and we are going to cut 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.580
 to leave it more or less our photo 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:38.190
 as a species after a square 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:40.620
 then we select and cut it from 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:42.330
 this way if you want to move it 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:44.630
 the photo for the sides can 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:48.090
 move as you look on the screen 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:51.270
 Well, I 'm going to locate it more or less 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.460
 in this way there once you 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:57.120
 select we give you a click on the blade 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.620
 to select we click and ready 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:03.030
 now let's use the tool 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:06.590
 elliptical frame that is also in the 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:08.860
 part of the left 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.520
 we removed a click and then we selected 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.950
 frame tool the indian 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.730
 so here what we are going to do is to 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:22.230
 position ourselves on the left side 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:24.780
 superior ok then we press the 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.510
 shift key we first press 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:31.020
 we do not have him pressed and now with the 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:34.890
 left click of mouse or mouse 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:38.400
 then we make the corresponding circle 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:42.910
 then first we release the click 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:47.200
 of the mouse and then the click of the chip 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:50.530
 if it has not gone well to remove 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:53.980
 the circle what we do is give control 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:56.650
 and he takes them off then we go back 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:59.080
 again to step back 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:01.900
 previous tonces again we select 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:05.140
 if we press shift and press the 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:07.000
 Left click of the mouse is so that 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:09.190
 you also learn from this 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.670
 way with let go of the first click of the 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:15.069
 mouse and now the chip then now that 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:16.569
 we have already made the circle then 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:19.630
 we can move in the location that 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:22.780
 we, then, like us more, what 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:26.160
 left like this and now we're going to 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:28.680
 go to filter we will go to 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:31.000
 distort and we will select 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.700
 expert hoist ok 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.790
 we click on sphere we give a 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:38.769
 click then now we're going to go where 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:41.290
 this part where I am pointing you 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:43.150
 let's give a less zoom to be able 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.560
 visualize the image as it is going to 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:47.770
 stay 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:50.160
 here already shows them the visualization and 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:53.650
 here in quantity we are going to select 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:56.380
 about 65 I recommend you leave it 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:58.569
 at 65 and it's up to you if 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:01.440
 you want to give more or less a me in 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:05.110
 my case I leave it this way in 6 565 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:08.020
 and in normal mode we selected a 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:09.750
 Once this is done, we give 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:12.960
 okay 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:15.180
 and it will stay like this now let's go 

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:18.120
 to duplicate the layer as we press 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:21.450
 control j to duplicate the layer and the 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:22.170
 we position now in the first layer of 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:25.620
 down ok 

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:28.320
 'here we select the layer and we will 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:29.790
 unchecking the layer will give a click 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:32.370
 so that those in this way 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:34.830
 again if we click us 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:37.550
 shows the total photo then if we give 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:40.740
 One click then we are left this way 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:42.870
 Now we are going to select the tool 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.880
 rectangular that is here in the part of 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:47.340
 down that is this if they do not disappear they give 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:51.090
 Right click and look for tool 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:52.800
 rectangular then here they can catch 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:54.720
 the color that you want and in me 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.700
 case I will select a black color 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:05:00.590
 you the color that you like 

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:02.990
 I give it in black then now 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:05.570
 we are going to 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:07.449
 to paint the black color 

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:10.120
 space 

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:12.910
 of the photo then we select more or 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:16.480
 less here 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:18.760
 there more or less and let go and be the 

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:20.650
 is the black color then the 

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:23.890
 we position if they want in the layer 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:26.920
 first or in the background layer and in my 

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:29.920
 case I leave it in a first layer and as 

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:33.250
 you see, they have already been created by 

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:35.380
 fisheye effect that looks from this 

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:37.680
 so you can apply then 

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:41.620
 in the photos you want 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:44.590
 make the fisheye effect has been 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:48.550
 very easy and simple I hope that you 

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:52.150
 has served and if you want it you can 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:54.310
 save the eye weight effect the photo 

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:57.640
 already done the fish eye then we are going to 

00:05:54.310 --> 00:06:00.570
 files we give in save as here 

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:00.570
 we put proof 

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:07.610
 and we give in jpg format 

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:10.529
 I select it in the writer and I give in 

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:13.830
 save I give in ok 

00:06:10.529 --> 00:06:16.530
 then I have already closed this window 

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:18.370
 and let's see how our 

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:23.510
 Photo 

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:25.730
 I have already made the fish eye 

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:29.120
 as you see, we are left with this 

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:31.130
 way the eye effect then we can 

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:33.910
 remove the zoom so you can 

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:37.010
 better visualize or enlarge the show 

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:39.950
 So this is the way you 

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:42.980

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:45.650
