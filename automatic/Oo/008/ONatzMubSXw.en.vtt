00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
a few of course but there's also on the

yeah<00:02:12.170> he's<00:02:12.440> certainly<00:02:12.770> profiting<00:02:13.190> and<00:02:13.310> he

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:13.460 
yeah he's certainly profiting and he

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:17.200 
yeah he's certainly profiting and he
admits<00:02:13.820> it<00:02:13.970> himself<00:02:14.180> like<00:02:14.660> I<00:02:15.370> wouldn't<00:02:16.370> take

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:17.210 
admits it himself like I wouldn't take

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:19.510 
admits it himself like I wouldn't take
it<00:02:17.270> to<00:02:17.420> extremes<00:02:17.510> like<00:02:17.900> he<00:02:18.110> did<00:02:18.320> but<00:02:18.740> I<00:02:19.010> can

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520 
it to extremes like he did but I can

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:20.950 
it to extremes like he did but I can
understand<00:02:19.850> the<00:02:19.940> points<00:02:20.240> like<00:02:20.450> there's<00:02:20.720> a<00:02:20.840> lot

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:20.960 
understand the points like there's a lot

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:24.820 
understand the points like there's a lot
of<00:02:21.100> troubled<00:02:22.570> gambling<00:02:23.570> addict<00:02:24.320> sort<00:02:24.680> of

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
of troubled gambling addict sort of

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.880 
of troubled gambling addict sort of
death<00:02:25.070> probably<00:02:25.960> like<00:02:26.960> gambling<00:02:27.500> in<00:02:27.620> general

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
death probably like gambling in general

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:29.290 
death probably like gambling in general
hurts<00:02:28.100> a<00:02:28.220> lot<00:02:28.340> but<00:02:28.760> I<00:02:28.850> don't<00:02:28.910> think<00:02:29.120> it's<00:02:29.240> just

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
hurts a lot but I don't think it's just

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.060 
hurts a lot but I don't think it's just
poker<00:02:29.630> it<00:02:29.840> could<00:02:30.050> be<00:02:30.200> anything<00:02:30.410> if<00:02:30.709> they

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.070 
poker it could be anything if they

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:32.380 
poker it could be anything if they
didn't<00:02:31.280> have<00:02:31.370> poker<00:02:31.550> they<00:02:31.790> would<00:02:31.970> probably

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
didn't have poker they would probably

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.570 
didn't have poker they would probably
play<00:02:33.260> here<00:02:33.470> and<00:02:33.620> at<00:02:33.770> the<00:02:33.860> casinos<00:02:34.310> like

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
play here and at the casinos like

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.000 
play here and at the casinos like
blackjack<00:02:34.820> and<00:02:35.090> stuff<00:02:35.270> like<00:02:35.420> that<00:02:35.660> so<00:02:35.930> I<00:02:36.140> don't

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
blackjack and stuff like that so I don't

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.430 
blackjack and stuff like that so I don't
mind<00:02:37.280> you<00:02:37.490> know<00:02:37.610> poker<00:02:38.150> I<00:02:38.510> think<00:02:39.230> it<00:02:39.320> gives

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
mind you know poker I think it gives

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 
think all odds a nice might be might be

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.160 
think all odds a nice might be might be
up<00:03:52.130> there<00:03:52.370> as<00:03:52.940> one<00:03:53.269> of<00:03:53.330> the<00:03:53.510> best<00:03:53.690> six<00:03:53.930> max

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:54.170 
up there as one of the best six max

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:59.229 
up there as one of the best six max
players<00:03:55.390> in<00:03:56.390> hits<00:03:56.570> up<00:03:56.750> all<00:03:57.530> also<00:03:57.920> or<00:03:58.340> what<00:03:59.180> do

00:03:59.229 --> 00:03:59.239 
players in hits up all also or what do

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:01.420 
players in hits up all also or what do
you<00:03:59.269> mean<00:03:59.420> no<00:03:59.690> bail<00:03:59.900> mental<00:04:00.799> Reena<00:04:01.160> I<00:04:01.190> think

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:01.430 
you mean no bail mental Reena I think

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:04.390 
you mean no bail mental Reena I think
it's<00:04:01.610> best<00:04:01.880> a<00:04:02.030> heads<00:04:02.209> up<00:04:02.330> but<00:04:02.540> six<00:04:02.840> max<00:04:03.049> its<00:04:03.400> you

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 
it's best a heads up but six max its you

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.000 
it's best a heads up but six max its you
can't<00:04:04.609> just<00:04:04.910> like<00:04:05.329> crunch<00:04:06.200> you<00:04:06.889> know

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010 
can't just like crunch you know

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:10.120 
can't just like crunch you know
software's<00:04:07.940> and<00:04:08.810> so<00:04:09.049> that<00:04:09.230> it

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:10.130 
software's and so that it

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:11.320 
software's and so that it
it's<00:04:10.280> a<00:04:10.400> little<00:04:10.640> bit<00:04:10.730> more<00:04:10.880> difficult<00:04:11.240> with

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:11.330 
it's a little bit more difficult with

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:12.940 
it's a little bit more difficult with
the<00:04:11.450> ranges<00:04:11.720> in<00:04:11.870> certain<00:04:12.320> spots<00:04:12.530> and<00:04:12.830> stuff

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:12.950 
the ranges in certain spots and stuff

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:15.490 
the ranges in certain spots and stuff
like<00:04:13.130> that<00:04:13.370> so<00:04:13.670> it<00:04:13.910> it<00:04:14.420> takes<00:04:14.690> more<00:04:14.870> experience

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:15.500 
like that so it it takes more experience

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.680 
like that so it it takes more experience
basically<00:04:15.770> to<00:04:16.280> be<00:04:16.640> good<00:04:16.790> at<00:04:16.940> that<00:04:17.120> game<00:04:17.330> then

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690 
basically to be good at that game then

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:18.790 
basically to be good at that game then
heads<00:04:17.870> up<00:04:18.020> in<00:04:18.140> hands<00:04:18.290> up<00:04:18.380> you<00:04:18.440> can<00:04:18.560> really

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:18.800 
heads up in hands up you can really

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:22.030 
heads up in hands up you can really
quickly<00:04:19.070> learn<00:04:19.430> it<00:04:19.610> by<00:04:19.840> by<00:04:20.840> using<00:04:21.140> like<00:04:21.590> proper

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:22.040 
quickly learn it by by using like proper

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:24.430 
quickly learn it by by using like proper
tools<00:04:22.340> and<00:04:22.490> software<00:04:23.150> to<00:04:23.630> analyze<00:04:23.720> your<00:04:24.140> game

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.440 
tools and software to analyze your game

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:27.250 
tools and software to analyze your game
in<00:04:25.070> that<00:04:25.280> one<00:04:25.810> last<00:04:26.810> question

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:27.260 
in that one last question

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.430 
in that one last question
I<00:04:27.350> remember<00:04:27.830> that<00:04:28.070> you<00:04:28.220> bought<00:04:28.490> a<00:04:29.080> tickets<00:04:30.080> to

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:30.440 
I remember that you bought a tickets to

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:33.520 
I remember that you bought a tickets to
space<00:04:31.600> is<00:04:32.600> that<00:04:32.780> still<00:04:32.960> honest<00:04:33.380> that's

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:33.530 
space is that still honest that's

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:37.300 
space is that still honest that's
something<00:04:34.540> I<00:04:35.540> think<00:04:36.200> the<00:04:36.290> first<00:04:36.500> first<00:04:36.950> people

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.310 
something I think the first first people

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:39.790 
something I think the first first people
bought<00:04:37.520> it<00:04:37.700> like<00:04:38.110> ten<00:04:39.110> years<00:04:39.320> ago<00:04:39.590> almost

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:39.800 
bought it like ten years ago almost

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.980 
bought it like ten years ago almost
they've<00:04:40.160> been<00:04:40.310> postponing<00:04:40.880> it<00:04:41.090> but<00:04:41.270> they

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:41.990 
they've been postponing it but they

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:44.140 
they've been postponing it but they
haven't<00:04:42.170> now<00:04:42.410> so<00:04:42.830> it's<00:04:43.070> forced<00:04:43.490> to<00:04:43.670> the<00:04:43.940> first

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:44.150 
haven't now so it's forced to the first

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:46.960 
haven't now so it's forced to the first
first<00:04:44.860> trip<00:04:45.860> is<00:04:45.980> supposed<00:04:46.280> to<00:04:46.370> be<00:04:46.610> leaving

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:46.970 
first trip is supposed to be leaving

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:49.210 
first trip is supposed to be leaving
this<00:04:47.330> year<00:04:47.690> at<00:04:48.260> the<00:04:48.410> end<00:04:48.500> of<00:04:48.590> this<00:04:48.740> year<00:04:49.070> and

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:49.220 
this year at the end of this year and

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:52.270 
this year at the end of this year and
I'm<00:04:49.700> like<00:04:49.910> the<00:04:50.180> 450th<00:04:51.080> in<00:04:51.560> the<00:04:51.800> queue<00:04:52.040> so

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:52.280 
I'm like the 450th in the queue so

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:55.150 
I'm like the 450th in the queue so
probably<00:04:53.240> now<00:04:53.720> probably<00:04:53.960> like<00:04:54.260> I<00:04:54.590> think<00:04:54.830> we

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:55.160 
probably now probably like I think we

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:56.680 
probably now probably like I think we
drove<00:04:55.310> out<00:04:55.550> pretty<00:04:55.760> fast<00:04:56.060> when<00:04:56.270> they<00:04:56.450> get<00:04:56.570> it

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:56.690 
drove out pretty fast when they get it

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:58.660 
drove out pretty fast when they get it
because<00:04:56.810> it's<00:04:57.080> under<00:04:57.320> like<00:04:57.440> a<00:04:57.670> one-time-use

00:04:58.660 --> 00:04:58.670 
because it's under like a one-time-use

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:01.270 
because it's under like a one-time-use
rocket<00:04:59.360> it's<00:04:59.540> like<00:04:59.750> um<00:04:59.960> they<00:05:00.860> have<00:05:00.980> built<00:05:01.190> a

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:01.280 
rocket it's like um they have built a

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.070 
rocket it's like um they have built a
crap<00:05:01.490> that<00:05:01.730> goes<00:05:02.030> up<00:05:02.210> and<00:05:02.420> then<00:05:02.480> it's<00:05:02.660> possible

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:03.080 
crap that goes up and then it's possible

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:06.310 
crap that goes up and then it's possible
it<00:05:03.140> can<00:05:03.290> land<00:05:03.470> land<00:05:04.250> on<00:05:04.490> an<00:05:04.870> airfield<00:05:05.870> and<00:05:06.110> and

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:06.320 
it can land land on an airfield and and

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:09.970 
it can land land on an airfield and and
basically<00:05:07.310> live<00:05:07.910> almost<00:05:08.600> yeah<00:05:09.200> like<00:05:09.830> five

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:09.980 
basically live almost yeah like five

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:13.480 
basically live almost yeah like five
shifts<00:05:10.280> a<00:05:10.430> day<00:05:10.460> yeah<00:05:11.330> yeah<00:05:11.480> I<00:05:12.290> guess<00:05:12.920> yeah<00:05:13.220> it's

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:13.490 
shifts a day yeah yeah I guess yeah it's

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:16.510 
shifts a day yeah yeah I guess yeah it's
possible<00:05:13.790> so<00:05:14.240> perhaps<00:05:15.050> like<00:05:15.470> in<00:05:15.890> two<00:05:16.040> years<00:05:16.310> I

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:16.520 
possible so perhaps like in two years I

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.850 
possible so perhaps like in two years I
can<00:05:16.670> hope<00:05:16.790> to<00:05:16.820> get<00:05:17.150> there<00:05:17.390> all<00:05:17.690> right<00:05:17.860> with

can hope to get there all right with
