here<00:00:17.520> let's<00:00:17.760> boot<00:00:17.970> up<00:00:18.150> the<00:00:18.359> Zed<00:00:19.109> 20<00:00:19.410> T<00:00:19.650> and<00:00:20.390> also

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
here let's boot up the Zed 20 T and also

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.070 
here let's boot up the Zed 20 T and also
the<00:00:21.539> surface<00:00:21.900> pro<00:00:22.109> 3<00:00:22.140> and<00:00:22.820> I<00:00:23.820> want<00:00:24.269> to<00:00:24.359> see<00:00:24.600> I'm

going<00:00:25.350> to<00:00:25.439> run<00:00:25.650> Photoshop<00:00:26.310> and<00:00:26.550> open<00:00:26.760> up<00:00:27.060> a<00:00:27.210> raw

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
going to run Photoshop and open up a raw

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.870 
going to run Photoshop and open up a raw
camera<00:00:28.199> file<00:00:28.619> so<00:00:28.920> a<00:00:28.949> picture<00:00:29.160> that's<00:00:29.460> taken

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
camera file so a picture that's taken

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.659 
camera file so a picture that's taken
with<00:00:30.449> a<00:00:30.480> digital<00:00:30.990> camera<00:00:31.199> in<00:00:31.500> Ross<00:00:31.769> floor<00:00:32.460> mode

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
with a digital camera in Ross floor mode

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.940 
with a digital camera in Ross floor mode
and<00:00:33.079> I'm<00:00:34.079> going<00:00:34.110> to<00:00:34.410> compare<00:00:34.800> those

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
and I'm going to compare those

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.799 
and I'm going to compare those
side-by-side<00:00:38.390> alright<00:00:39.390> for<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:39.600> sake<00:00:39.780> of

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
side-by-side alright for the sake of

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.389 
side-by-side alright for the sake of
comparison<00:00:40.260> we're<00:00:40.649> going<00:00:40.680> to<00:00:40.800> open<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.190> same

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
comparison we're going to open the same

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.760 
comparison we're going to open the same
file<00:00:41.760> in<00:00:42.000> Photoshop<00:00:42.600> let's<00:00:43.230> go

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:45.770 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:47.959 

of<00:00:46.770> course<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.070> first<00:00:47.250> time<00:00:47.370> we<00:00:47.579> log<00:00:47.760> into

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
of course the first time we log into

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.700 
of course the first time we log into
Photoshop<00:00:48.539> it's<00:00:48.690> going<00:00:48.870> to<00:00:48.989> be<00:00:49.050> a<00:00:49.200> little<00:00:49.469> bit

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
Photoshop it's going to be a little bit

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.299 
Photoshop it's going to be a little bit
slower<00:00:49.980> than<00:00:50.390> a<00:00:51.390> normal<00:00:52.079> opening<00:00:52.920> would<00:00:53.129> and

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
slower than a normal opening would and

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.189 
slower than a normal opening would and
file<00:00:53.550> opening<00:00:53.850> would<00:00:54.059> but<00:00:54.780> this<00:00:54.840> will<00:00:55.020> give<00:00:55.110> us

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
file opening would but this will give us

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.020 
file opening would but this will give us
a<00:00:55.289> good<00:00:55.440> demonstration<00:00:55.739> of<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.460> processing

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
a good demonstration of the processing

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.170 
a good demonstration of the processing
performance<00:00:58.670> okay<00:00:59.670> there<00:00:59.910> we<00:01:00.000> go

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
performance okay there we go

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.260 
performance okay there we go
ready<00:01:00.629> to<00:01:00.840> edit<00:01:01.170> I<00:01:01.440> change<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.190> exposure<00:01:02.579> or

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
ready to edit I change the exposure or

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.640 
ready to edit I change the exposure or
the<00:01:03.329> contrast<00:01:04.339> you'll<00:01:05.339> see<00:01:05.580> very<00:01:05.790> quickly

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:06.650 
the contrast you'll see very quickly

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.170 
the contrast you'll see very quickly
that<00:01:07.650> their<00:01:08.010> core<00:01:08.250> aim<00:01:08.400> is<00:01:08.549> quite<00:01:08.820> responsive

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
that their core aim is quite responsive

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.600 
that their core aim is quite responsive
to<00:01:09.900> changes<00:01:10.380> there<00:01:10.760> and<00:01:12.619> also<00:01:13.619> comparing<00:01:14.520> to

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
to changes there and also comparing to

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.070 
to changes there and also comparing to
the<00:01:14.729> surface<00:01:15.150> which<00:01:15.330> is<00:01:15.750> of<00:01:15.900> course

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
the surface which is of course

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.539 
the surface which is of course
responsive<00:01:18.409> what<00:01:19.409> I'm<00:01:19.530> looking<00:01:19.860> to<00:01:19.979> see<00:01:20.220> here

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
responsive what I'm looking to see here

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.270 
responsive what I'm looking to see here
is<00:01:20.880> how<00:01:21.780> different<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.439> experiences<00:01:23.130> of

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
is how different the experiences of

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.219 
is how different the experiences of
using<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.670> core<00:01:23.909> temp<00:01:24.150> processor<00:01:24.689> in<00:01:24.990> real

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
using the core temp processor in real

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.550 
using the core temp processor in real
life<00:01:25.610> compared<00:01:26.610> to<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:27.090> core<00:01:27.570> i7<00:01:27.840> alright

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
life compared to the core i7 alright

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:29.390 
life compared to the core i7 alright
5-series

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
5-series

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.649 
5-series
in<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:30.150> previous<00:01:30.570> generation<00:01:31.140> of<00:01:31.350> tablets

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:32.659 
in the previous generation of tablets

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:35.710 
in the previous generation of tablets
the<00:01:33.659> key<00:01:34.049> difference<00:01:34.470> here<00:01:34.560> is<00:01:34.950> that<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.280> core

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:35.720 
the key difference here is that the core

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.679 
the key difference here is that the core
M<00:01:36.720> processor<00:01:37.710> is<00:01:38.490> designed<00:01:38.850> to<00:01:39.329> conserve

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
M processor is designed to conserve

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.749 
M processor is designed to conserve
power<00:01:40.170> and<00:01:40.619> to<00:01:40.829> give<00:01:40.979> you<00:01:41.070> maximum<00:01:41.310> battery

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
power and to give you maximum battery

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.649 
power and to give you maximum battery
life<00:01:42.320> so<00:01:43.320> that<00:01:43.649> is<00:01:43.860> a<00:01:43.950> benefit<00:01:44.640> however<00:01:44.939> in

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
life so that is a benefit however in

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.210 
life so that is a benefit however in
order<00:01:45.840> to<00:01:45.960> achieve<00:01:46.320> that<00:01:46.530> they<00:01:46.680> do<00:01:46.740> have<00:01:47.070> to

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
order to achieve that they do have to

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.789 
order to achieve that they do have to
sacrifice<00:01:47.759> some<00:01:48.210> performance<00:01:48.930> and<00:01:49.320> that's

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
sacrifice some performance and that's

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.679 
sacrifice some performance and that's
what<00:01:49.979> you'll<00:01:50.100> be<00:01:50.189> able<00:01:50.280> to<00:01:50.460> see<00:01:50.670> here<00:01:51.030> in<00:01:51.360> some

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
what you'll be able to see here in some

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.859 
what you'll be able to see here in some

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
ways the new core M processor will

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.179 
ways the new core M processor will
perform<00:01:56.939> a<00:01:57.060> little<00:01:57.180> bit<00:01:57.360> better<00:01:57.630> in<00:01:58.079> others<00:01:58.469> it
