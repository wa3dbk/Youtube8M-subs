00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.990 
some warm-up races basically each
country<00:02:29.410> in<00:02:29.500> Europe<00:02:29.740> has<00:02:29.920> their<00:02:30.070> own<00:02:30.130> it's

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
country in Europe has their own it's

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.790 
country in Europe has their own it's
like<00:02:31.150> a<00:02:31.180> it's<00:02:31.630> like<00:02:31.750> a<00:02:31.840> outdoor<00:02:32.230> series<00:02:32.560> here

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
like a it's like a outdoor series here

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.080 
like a it's like a outdoor series here
but<00:02:32.950> there's<00:02:33.130> like<00:02:33.280> probably<00:02:33.460> five<00:02:33.880> or<00:02:33.910> six

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
but there's like probably five or six

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.449 
but there's like probably five or six
rounds<00:02:34.420> and<00:02:35.260> I<00:02:36.070> had<00:02:36.520> done<00:02:36.700> the<00:02:36.850> first<00:02:37.090> two<00:02:37.300> and

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
rounds and I had done the first two and

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:40.130 
rounds and I had done the first two and
in<00:02:38.790> the<00:02:38.909> first<00:02:39.150> year<00:02:39.390> I<00:02:39.480> had<00:02:39.659> racked<00:02:39.900> pretty

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
in the first year I had racked pretty

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.050 
in the first year I had racked pretty
good<00:02:40.379> and<00:02:40.680> I<00:02:40.980> think<00:02:41.280> my<00:02:41.519> head

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
good and I think my head

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.509 
good and I think my head
basically<00:02:42.930> took<00:02:43.349> some<00:02:43.560> time<00:02:43.739> off<00:02:43.980> we<00:02:44.400> had

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519 
basically took some time off we had

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:46.729 
basically took some time off we had

nothing<00:03:55.530> that<00:03:55.799> I've<00:03:55.980> ever<00:03:56.099> felt<00:03:56.370> before<00:03:56.579> and<00:03:56.790> I

00:03:57.289 --> 00:03:57.299 
nothing that I've ever felt before and I

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:00.550 
nothing that I've ever felt before and I
mean<00:03:58.109> to<00:03:59.040> not<00:03:59.250> be<00:03:59.430> able<00:03:59.549> to

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 
mean to not be able to

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.080 
mean to not be able to
train<00:04:00.739> and<00:04:01.069> stuff<00:04:01.250> like<00:04:01.400> that<00:04:01.610> just<00:04:01.940> from

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090 
train and stuff like that just from

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:03.699 
train and stuff like that just from
getting<00:04:02.540> dizzy<00:04:02.840> or<00:04:03.110> something<00:04:03.410> like<00:04:03.470> that<00:04:03.530> I

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:03.709 
getting dizzy or something like that I

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:04.900 
getting dizzy or something like that I
mean<00:04:03.920> I<00:04:04.130> think<00:04:04.340> that's<00:04:04.489> something<00:04:04.670> that<00:04:04.819> the

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:04.910 
mean I think that's something that the

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:06.520 
mean I think that's something that the
sport<00:04:05.209> needs<00:04:05.390> to<00:04:05.540> take<00:04:05.720> more<00:04:05.750> seriously<00:04:06.349> and

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.530 
sport needs to take more seriously and

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:09.100 
sport needs to take more seriously and
and<00:04:06.830> you<00:04:07.610> know<00:04:07.730> it<00:04:07.880> it<00:04:08.239> sucks<00:04:08.569> being<00:04:08.780> off<00:04:08.959> of

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:09.110 
and you know it it sucks being off of
