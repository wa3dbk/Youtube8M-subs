 manufacturers they bribe spectacular 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.250
 design but in terms of 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.170
 functionality is rather

 fitness bracelet 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:25.190

 cr 2032 battery watch does not look 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.930
 only beautiful and stylish but also elegant 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:50.230
 due to the small thickness and 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.850
 relatively small screen diameter 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:54.710

 women on the female hand they will 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.720
 look the most organic 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:11.180
 the clock has no buttons no connectors 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.640
 screen in the classic sense under 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.010
 float glass settles down 12 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.210
 single color LED 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:18.979
 indicators each 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.810
 corresponds to one of the traditional 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:23.360
 divisions on the watch face 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.299
 it is worth making a hand movement and two 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:28.100
 indicator light is yellowish 

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:29.030
 one of them does not blink and displays 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.159
 number of hours 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.950
 and the other corresponding minute 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:36.560
 arrows flashing solution is interesting but 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.509
 turns a bunch of inconvenience clock 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.119
 do not respond to all hand movements 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:42.450
 another opportunity to watch time not 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:44.729
 provided for 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.670
 there is no possibility to change or adjust 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.500
 the appearance of the dial in a certain 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.219
 only one time is visible on the screen 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.860
 indicator 

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:55.009
 so use and night and precisely in 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.479
 quality hours of dubious pleasure 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:59.130
 to work with the device is required 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.850
 install on smartphone and brand 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.549
 attachment 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:05.219
 in-house but not in the appstore myth playstore 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.770
 it does not search and install applications 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:10.640
 require a series of not the most obvious 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:12.959
 manipulation version of the application for ios 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.760
 not working without connecting with 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:17.220
 the smartphone will show the clock 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.470
 wrong time therefore from 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.900
 Connect to the smartphone can not go anywhere 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:24.630
 but even when you connect the clock to the native 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:27.060
 a smartphone in meizu mx4 arise 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.470
 unexplained problems in half this 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.150
 primitive application for 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.700
 fitness tracker with minimal 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:35.280
 settings for auto clock synchronization and 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.569
 applications work incorrectly and better 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.750
 do it manually 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:41.760
 the clock only notifies calls and sms 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.590
 LED indication limited 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.230
 simultaneous blinking of several 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:49.200
 indicators looking at the clock can not be found 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:52.049
 who is calling or writing as it is impossible to know and 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.540
 message content provided 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:56.340
 the ability to track face on but she 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.970
 has an extremely informative 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.700
 load 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:02.430
 the clock has no smart alarm function 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.620
 implementing the fitness function is far from 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.540
 perfect share my stretching 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:09.209
 can only be through Chinese social 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:11.160
 resources no settings which 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:15.630
 affected the operation of the device and 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:18.389
 applications are not here and night and stylish and 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:20.519
 inexpensive smartwatches working on one 

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:22.709
 batteries for several months with a pair 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:24.660
 interesting solutions like using 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:27.000
 led indicators to display time 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:28.560
 but disgusting software 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.989
 ensure cross out all 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.730
 dignity of the novelty 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:35.190
 device there is no function which 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.870
 she performed well his impossible 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:40.290
 use with some of the stated 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:43.430
 smartphones its current state and 2 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.430
 shgpi useless
