00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
okay here we're going to make a three

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:11.720 
okay here we're going to make a three
strand<00:00:10.320> splice<00:00:10.650> with<00:00:11.160> some<00:00:11.309> three<00:00:11.490> strand

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
strand splice with some three strand

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.600 
polyester
first<00:00:13.349> of<00:00:13.440> all<00:00:13.500> just<00:00:13.799> come<00:00:14.040> down<00:00:14.219> the<00:00:14.460> length

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
first of all just come down the length

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.830 
first of all just come down the length
of<00:00:14.790> your<00:00:14.910> tails<00:00:15.150> and<00:00:15.980> line<00:00:16.980> of<00:00:17.130> tape<00:00:17.340> or<00:00:17.580> a<00:00:17.609> whip

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:17.840 
of your tails and line of tape or a whip

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:24.410 
of your tails and line of tape or a whip
around<00:00:18.840> the<00:00:19.320> rope<00:00:22.970> next<00:00:23.970> to<00:00:24.150> this<00:00:24.300> is

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
around the rope next to this is

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:25.939 
around the rope next to this is
polyester<00:00:24.750> so<00:00:25.019> it's<00:00:25.140> melted<00:00:25.500> together<00:00:25.650> we're

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
polyester so it's melted together we're

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.339 
polyester so it's melted together we're
going<00:00:26.099> to<00:00:26.160> break<00:00:26.340> open<00:00:26.550> that<00:00:26.789> the<00:00:27.300> end<00:00:27.449> quick

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
going to break open that the end quick

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:29.660 
going to break open that the end quick
way<00:00:28.470> to<00:00:28.529> do<00:00:28.680> that<00:00:28.800> is<00:00:28.920> just<00:00:28.949> put<00:00:29.130> the<00:00:29.340> fit<00:00:29.519> in

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
way to do that is just put the fit in

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:36.470 
way to do that is just put the fit in
and<00:00:30.630> twist<00:00:30.960> it<00:00:31.140> around<00:00:35.059> to<00:00:36.059> end<00:00:36.210> up<00:00:36.329> with<00:00:36.390> the

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
and twist it around to end up with the

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.250 
and twist it around to end up with the
three<00:00:36.719> strands<00:00:37.170> unravel<00:00:38.070> those<00:00:38.870> to<00:00:39.870> get<00:00:40.110> to

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
three strands unravel those to get to

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.490 
three strands unravel those to get to
your<00:00:40.379> tape<00:00:41.629> the<00:00:42.629> start<00:00:42.930> is<00:00:43.079> probably<00:00:43.350> the

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
your tape the start is probably the

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.500 
your tape the start is probably the
hardest<00:00:43.890> you<00:00:44.340> lay<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.550> rope<00:00:44.789> down<00:00:44.969> so<00:00:45.300> the

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
hardest you lay the rope down so the

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.810 
hardest you lay the rope down so the
three<00:00:45.809> are<00:00:46.440> separated<00:00:46.980> like<00:00:47.190> so<00:00:47.399> one<00:00:47.640> at<00:00:47.730> the

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
three are separated like so one at the

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.510 
three are separated like so one at the
bottom<00:00:48.120> on<00:00:48.300> either<00:00:48.420> side<00:00:48.780> come<00:00:49.649> over<00:00:50.039> to<00:00:50.399> the

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
bottom on either side come over to the

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.819 
bottom on either side come over to the
top<00:00:50.730> this<00:00:51.210> fit<00:00:51.480> this<00:00:51.840> tail<00:00:52.230> is<00:00:52.469> going<00:00:52.649> to<00:00:52.710> go

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
top this fit this tail is going to go

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.090 
top this fit this tail is going to go
into<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.129> top<00:00:53.430> line<00:00:53.699> on<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:55.020> standing<00:00:55.890> side

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
into the top line on the standing side

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.319 
into the top line on the standing side
of<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.250> road<00:00:56.399> we<00:00:56.850> open<00:00:57.120> up<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.829> strand<00:00:59.149> pop<00:01:00.149> up

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
of the road we open up the strand pop up

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:06.530 
of the road we open up the strand pop up
fit<00:01:00.539> in<00:01:04.850> take<00:01:05.850> this<00:01:05.909> out<00:01:06.090> and<00:01:06.119> put<00:01:06.270> it<00:01:06.390> all<00:01:06.479> the

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
fit in take this out and put it all the

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.480 
fit in take this out and put it all the
way<00:01:06.600> through<00:01:06.630> so<00:01:07.439> we<00:01:07.530> go<00:01:07.650> to<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.920> tape<00:01:08.159> or<00:01:08.400> the

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
way through so we go to the tape or the

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.850 
way through so we go to the tape or the
whip<00:01:11.060> then<00:01:12.060> we're<00:01:12.180> going<00:01:12.299> to<00:01:12.330> work<00:01:12.479> around<00:01:12.860> the

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
whip then we're going to work around the

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.719 
whip then we're going to work around the
Rope<00:01:14.150> open<00:01:15.150> up<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.420> one<00:01:15.509> next<00:01:15.780> to<00:01:15.930> it

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:16.729 
Rope open up the one next to it

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:18.800 
Rope open up the one next to it
take<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:17.850> Fed<00:01:18.030> sometimes<00:01:18.420> it<00:01:18.509> makes<00:01:18.659> it

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
take the Fed sometimes it makes it

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.149 
take the Fed sometimes it makes it
easier<00:01:19.580> just<00:01:20.580> slide<00:01:20.759> that<00:01:20.970> in<00:01:21.030> under<00:01:21.360> there

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:22.159 
easier just slide that in under there

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:28.740 
easier just slide that in under there
work<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.250> other<00:01:23.310> way<00:01:24.140> and<00:01:25.369> then<00:01:26.369> there's<00:01:26.520> your

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:28.750 
work the other way and then there's your

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.600 
work the other way and then there's your
strand<00:01:29.530> for<00:01:29.890> this<00:01:30.010> one<00:01:32.310> once<00:01:33.310> we've<00:01:33.430> got<00:01:33.520> the

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:33.610 
strand for this one once we've got the

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:39.870 
strand for this one once we've got the
first<00:01:33.760> three<00:01:33.940> pull<00:01:34.780> down<00:01:34.960> down<00:01:35.200> tight<00:01:38.880> it

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
first three pull down down tight it

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.930 
first three pull down down tight it
should<00:01:39.940> look<00:01:40.180> something<00:01:40.240> like<00:01:40.570> that

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:41.940 
should look something like that

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.340 
should look something like that
next<00:01:42.940> we're<00:01:43.060> going<00:01:43.150> to<00:01:43.210> work<00:01:43.360> down<00:01:43.570> over<00:01:44.200> one

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.350 
next we're going to work down over one

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:46.950 
next we're going to work down over one
under<00:01:44.590> one<00:01:44.860> so<00:01:45.520> for<00:01:46.030> this<00:01:46.150> strand<00:01:46.450> we<00:01:46.630> go<00:01:46.780> over

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 
under one so for this strand we go over

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:56.280 
under one so for this strand we go over
this<00:01:47.050> one<00:01:47.230> and<00:01:47.410> we<00:01:47.620> go<00:01:47.740> in<00:01:47.950> under<00:01:48.070> that<00:01:55.140> it's<00:01:56.140> on

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:56.290 
this one and we go in under that it's on

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:09.639 
this one and we go in under that it's on
the<00:01:56.380> rope

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:19.050 

as<00:02:10.649> always<00:02:10.830> I've<00:02:11.190> won<00:02:11.459> under<00:02:11.790> one

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:29.740 

I've<00:02:20.060> won<00:02:20.390> under<00:02:20.660> the<00:02:20.870> next<00:02:28.420> with<00:02:29.420> polyester

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
I've won under the next with polyester

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.690 
I've won under the next with polyester
we<00:02:29.990> need<00:02:30.110> to<00:02:30.200> do<00:02:30.320> this<00:02:30.470> six<00:02:30.980> times<00:02:31.100> for<00:02:31.640> each

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
we need to do this six times for each

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:51.650 
we need to do this six times for each
strand

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:56.160 

once<00:02:52.660> you've<00:02:52.810> done<00:02:52.960> six<00:02:53.320> tax-free<00:02:53.890> and<00:02:55.170> you

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
once you've done six tax-free and you

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.340 
once you've done six tax-free and you
can<00:02:56.320> pull<00:02:56.560> down<00:02:56.740> the<00:02:57.720> x-trans<00:02:58.720> nice<00:02:58.990> and<00:02:59.200> tight

00:02:59.340 --> 00:02:59.350 
can pull down the x-trans nice and tight

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:03.980 
can pull down the x-trans nice and tight
so<00:02:59.620> it<00:02:59.710> looks<00:03:00.570> something<00:03:01.570> like<00:03:01.750> that

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:03.990 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:06.720

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
to finish off nicely what we're going to

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:16.320 
to finish off nicely what we're going to
do<00:03:07.380> is<00:03:08.380> take<00:03:08.800> one<00:03:09.790> of<00:03:09.820> the<00:03:09.970> strands<00:03:15.120> go<00:03:16.120> once

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:16.330 
do is take one of the strands go once

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:23.630 
do is take one of the strands go once
more<00:03:16.630> and<00:03:17.310> the<00:03:18.310> one<00:03:18.430> next<00:03:18.640> to<00:03:18.760> it<00:03:21.090> once<00:03:22.090> more

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
more and the one next to it once more

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:29.130 
more and the one next to it once more
back<00:03:24.640> to<00:03:24.820> our<00:03:24.910> first<00:03:25.180> strand<00:03:27.840> take<00:03:28.840> that<00:03:29.020> one

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.140 
back to our first strand take that one

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.270 
back to our first strand take that one
more<00:03:29.290> time<00:03:30.240> what<00:03:31.240> that<00:03:31.420> does<00:03:31.950> these<00:03:32.950> all<00:03:33.160> the
