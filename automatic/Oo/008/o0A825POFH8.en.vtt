00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:06.950
 nobody wants to fight I'll go back tomorrow and 

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:10.160
 it was exactly what helped goliat 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:14.660

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:19.029
 days but every time the 

00:00:17.089 --> 00:00:21.349
 Israelites ran to hide 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:23.749

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:27.140
 for his children then he sent the little 

00:00:23.749 --> 00:00:29.599
 David to the battlefield with food 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.789
 and David came to the camp of King Saul 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:34.010
 for now the goliat used to show up 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:37.090
 so that all the Israelites 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.090
 they were together 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.810
 arrived 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.950

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:57.130

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.760

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:22.120
 to the kids the people of god for god 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:25.030
 the law says that the Israelites were 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:27.310
 the elect of God in the guides by the 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:30.190
 desert helped us cross the Red Sea 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:32.770
 and every time they went into battle god 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:35.320
 I was with them they always knew that 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.850
 being god on his side nobody could 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:40.570
 Against them 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:43.180
 wow but the king and his men had 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:45.700

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:51.720
 they forgot that God is even bigger or 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:51.720
 heavens or the net you have something in your 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:58.640

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.640

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:11.190
