00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 
been an ongoing thing and then if we're

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:44.140 
been an ongoing thing and then if we're
not<00:01:42.799> having<00:01:42.979> dinner<00:01:43.130> at<00:01:43.580> my<00:01:43.759> house<00:01:43.940> they're

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:44.150 
not having dinner at my house they're

having dinner at each others house and

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.350 
having dinner at each others house and
and<00:01:45.740> just<00:01:46.130> trying<00:01:46.670> to<00:01:46.729> try<00:01:46.880> to<00:01:46.909> stay<00:01:47.119> as<00:01:47.210> close

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.360 
and just trying to try to stay as close

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.030 
and just trying to try to stay as close
as<00:01:47.570> possible<00:01:48.020> so<00:01:48.290> I<00:01:48.439> think<00:01:48.590> it<00:01:48.680> translates

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.040 
as possible so I think it translates

00:01:49.040 --> 00:02:01.570 
as possible so I think it translates
onto<00:01:49.250> the<00:01:49.340> court<00:01:59.440> it's<00:02:00.440> great<00:02:00.619> it's<00:02:01.280> fun<00:02:01.399> we
