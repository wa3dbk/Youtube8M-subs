I<00:02:22.980> was<00:02:23.099> saying<00:02:23.280> earlier<00:02:23.459> i<00:02:23.640> installed<00:02:24.000> it<00:02:24.030> on<00:02:24.090> a

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
I was saying earlier i installed it on a

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.600 
I was saying earlier i installed it on a
pc<00:02:24.690> which<00:02:25.230> did<00:02:25.410> take<00:02:25.620> quite<00:02:25.800> a<00:02:25.890> long<00:02:25.980> time<00:02:26.099> and

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
pc which did take quite a long time and

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.030 
pc which did take quite a long time and
say<00:02:27.569> if<00:02:27.810> you<00:02:27.840> look<00:02:28.110> where<00:02:28.319> the<00:02:28.410> mouse<00:02:28.560> is<00:02:28.590> as

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
say if you look where the mouse is as

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.300 
say if you look where the mouse is as
she<00:02:29.160> says<00:02:29.400> stage<00:02:29.790> 1<00:02:30.239> out<00:02:30.900> of<00:02:30.959> 20<00:02:31.530> so<00:02:32.130> there's

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
she says stage 1 out of 20 so there's

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.729 
she says stage 1 out of 20 so there's
quite<00:02:32.519> a<00:02:32.550> few<00:02:32.610> steps<00:02:32.940> to<00:02:33.150> go<00:02:33.269> through<00:02:33.599> and<00:02:34.500> when

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:34.739 
quite a few steps to go through and when

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:36.199 
quite a few steps to go through and when
i<00:02:34.769> installed<00:02:35.130> earlier<00:02:35.310> i<00:02:35.519> had<00:02:35.550> to<00:02:35.819> reboot

for<00:05:27.730> you<00:05:27.850> to<00:05:28.000> start<00:05:28.270> with<00:05:28.450> so<00:05:28.750> it<00:05:29.170> creates<00:05:29.560> you

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:29.680 
for you to start with so it creates you

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:32.390 
for you to start with so it creates you
it<00:05:29.800> like<00:05:29.950> the<00:05:30.040> default<00:05:30.820> page<00:05:31.060> in<00:05:31.240> about<00:05:31.510> page<00:05:31.840> a

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:32.400 
it like the default page in about page a

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:36.210 
it like the default page in about page a
spiral<00:05:33.400> sheets<00:05:33.640> folder<00:05:34.270> and<00:05:34.510> whatnot<00:05:35.080> and<00:05:35.350> and

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:36.220 
spiral sheets folder and whatnot and and

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:38.910 
spiral sheets folder and whatnot and and
it<00:05:36.730> opens<00:05:37.090> up<00:05:37.180> in<00:05:37.330> the<00:05:37.420> default<00:05:37.870> page<00:05:38.140> and<00:05:38.560> when

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:38.920 
it opens up in the default page and when

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:42.180

you<00:05:39.040> first<00:05:39.310> open<00:05:39.910> that<00:05:40.060> website<00:05:40.510> and<00:05:40.870> so<00:05:41.680> in<00:05:42.130> a

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:42.190 
you first open that website and so in a

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:44.010 
you first open that website and so in a
moment<00:05:42.550> we're<00:05:42.760> in<00:05:42.850> the<00:05:43.000> source<00:05:43.330> view<00:05:43.660> but<00:05:43.930> if

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:44.020 
moment we're in the source view but if

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:45.810 
moment we're in the source view but if
we<00:05:44.140> click<00:05:44.320> on<00:05:44.470> design<00:05:44.650> it<00:05:45.430> then<00:05:45.550> shows<00:05:45.760> just

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:45.820 
we click on design it then shows just

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:48.090 
we click on design it then shows just
the<00:05:46.090> website<00:05:46.540> in<00:05:46.750> the<00:05:46.780> graphical<00:05:47.290> view<00:05:47.530> and<00:05:47.800> as

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:55.470 
menu items like a title it's got a login
button<00:05:53.440> over<00:05:53.860> here<00:05:53.890> so<00:05:54.880> if<00:05:54.970> you<00:05:55.060> look<00:05:55.210> here<00:05:55.420> on

the left hand side there's an option
that<00:05:56.950> says<00:05:57.070> toolbox<00:05:57.670> so<00:05:58.030> if<00:05:58.090> you<00:05:58.180> just<00:05:58.360> click

00:05:58.500 --> 00:05:58.510 
that says toolbox so if you just click

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:03.960 
on the word and then this new menu pops
out<00:06:01.720> and<00:06:01.930> so<00:06:02.860> if<00:06:02.950> you<00:06:03.010> click<00:06:03.340> on<00:06:03.370> the<00:06:03.790> little

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:03.970

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:05.880 
out and so if you click on the little
pin<00:06:04.270> symbol<00:06:04.660> at<00:06:04.750> the<00:06:04.780> top<00:06:04.840> that<00:06:05.350> will<00:06:05.530> help<00:06:05.650> in

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:05.890 
pin symbol at the top that will help in

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:07.500 
pin symbol at the top that will help in
it<00:06:06.010> to<00:06:06.160> decide<00:06:06.490> which<00:06:06.610> will<00:06:06.820> always<00:06:07.000> be<00:06:07.300> there

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:07.510 
it to decide which will always be there

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:09.360 
it to decide which will always be there
so<00:06:08.260> these<00:06:08.380> are<00:06:08.440> some<00:06:08.590> of<00:06:08.680> the<00:06:08.800> standard

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:09.370 
so these are some of the standard

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:11.280 
so these are some of the standard
controls<00:06:10.210> that<00:06:10.390> we<00:06:10.510> use<00:06:10.690> inside<00:06:10.990> of<00:06:11.170> our

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:11.290 
controls that we use inside of our

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:13.980 
controls that we use inside of our
asp.net<00:06:11.710> web<00:06:12.130> sites<00:06:12.400> and<00:06:12.700> so<00:06:13.330> for<00:06:13.540> example<00:06:13.630> we

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:13.990 
asp.net web sites and so for example we

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:17.070 
asp.net web sites and so for example we
can<00:06:14.140> have<00:06:14.260> checkboxes<00:06:15.510> drop-down<00:06:16.510> list<00:06:16.840> we

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:17.080 
can have checkboxes drop-down list we

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:19.610 
can have checkboxes drop-down list we
can<00:06:17.200> add<00:06:17.350> in<00:06:17.500> images<00:06:18.040> all<00:06:18.730> that<00:06:18.970> sort<00:06:19.270> of<00:06:19.390> thing

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:19.620 
can add in images all that sort of thing

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:22.680 
can add in images all that sort of thing
and<00:06:20.620> then<00:06:20.710> when<00:06:20.830> we<00:06:20.920> get<00:06:21.040> into<00:06:21.190> the<00:06:21.690> database

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:22.690 
and then when we get into the database

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:24.210 
and then when we get into the database
side<00:06:22.990> of<00:06:23.170> it<00:06:23.290> we've<00:06:23.440> then<00:06:23.620> got<00:06:23.650> other<00:06:23.980> sort<00:06:24.160> of

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:24.220 
side of it we've then got other sort of

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:27.330 
side of it we've then got other sort of
controls<00:06:24.550> down<00:06:24.730> here<00:06:25.000> so<00:06:25.840> if<00:06:25.950> example<00:06:26.950> for<00:06:27.160> lot

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:27.340 
controls down here so if example for lot

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:29.520 
controls down here so if example for lot
for<00:06:27.610> logging<00:06:27.790> controls<00:06:28.330> we've<00:06:28.960> got<00:06:29.140> a<00:06:29.170> log<00:06:29.380> in

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:29.530 
for logging controls we've got a log in

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:32.540 
for logging controls we've got a log in
here<00:06:29.740> we've<00:06:30.130> got<00:06:30.160> a<00:06:30.520> change<00:06:31.390> password<00:06:31.900> control

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:32.550 
here we've got a change password control

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:36.180 
here we've got a change password control
create<00:06:33.550> a<00:06:33.700> new<00:06:34.060> user<00:06:34.570> wizard<00:06:35.260> as<00:06:35.440> all<00:06:36.040> these

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:36.190 
create a new user wizard as all these

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:38.270 
create a new user wizard as all these
things<00:06:36.430> will<00:06:36.610> be<00:06:36.730> using<00:06:36.940> in<00:06:37.300> the<00:06:37.930> upcoming

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:38.280 
things will be using in the upcoming
