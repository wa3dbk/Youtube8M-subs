yeah

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:08.270 
yeah
it<00:00:04.410> is<00:00:05.029> but<00:00:06.029> the<00:00:06.480> problem<00:00:06.629> is<00:00:07.170> that<00:00:07.410> I've

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
it is but the problem is that I've

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.180 
it is but the problem is that I've
sprayed<00:00:08.610> this<00:00:08.849> one<00:00:09.030> so<00:00:09.210> don't<00:00:09.420> eat<00:00:09.599> it<00:00:10.190> but

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
sprayed this one so don't eat it but

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.030 
sprayed this one so don't eat it but
they<00:00:12.030> are<00:00:12.300> that's<00:00:13.170> a<00:00:13.259> good<00:00:13.410> point<00:00:13.620> actually

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
they are that's a good point actually

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.250 
they are that's a good point actually
capsicum<00:00:14.700> annuum<00:00:14.969> ornamental<00:00:15.780> peppers<00:00:15.960> are

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
capsicum annuum ornamental peppers are

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.960 
capsicum annuum ornamental peppers are
very<00:00:16.560> spicy<00:00:16.920> because<00:00:19.400> the<00:00:20.400> only<00:00:20.550> problem<00:00:20.880> is

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
very spicy because the only problem is

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.160 
very spicy because the only problem is
they're<00:00:21.090> not<00:00:21.150> really<00:00:21.359> all<00:00:21.510> that<00:00:21.539> tasty<00:00:22.080> or

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
they're not really all that tasty or

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.839 
they're not really all that tasty or
edible<00:00:22.640> they're<00:00:23.640> not<00:00:23.820> bred<00:00:24.150> for<00:00:24.590> taste<00:00:25.590> or<00:00:26.490> for

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
edible they're not bred for taste or for

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.759 
edible they're not bred for taste or for
the<00:00:27.000> amount<00:00:27.240> of<00:00:27.330> spice<00:00:27.660> if<00:00:27.869> they<00:00:27.990> have<00:00:28.230> the

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
the amount of spice if they have the

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.410 
the amount of spice if they have the
rather<00:00:28.980> bread<00:00:29.310> for<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:29.580> way<00:00:29.699> that<00:00:29.849> they<00:00:30.000> look

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
rather bread for the way that they look

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.510 
rather bread for the way that they look
so<00:00:30.630> typically<00:00:31.050> ornamental<00:00:32.009> peppers<00:00:32.160> are

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
so typically ornamental peppers are

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.639 
so typically ornamental peppers are
extremely<00:00:33.149> hot<00:00:33.360> but<00:00:33.870> don't<00:00:34.079> taste<00:00:34.320> very<00:00:34.559> good

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
extremely hot but don't taste very good

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.410 
extremely hot but don't taste very good
so<00:00:35.340> people<00:00:35.610> don't<00:00:35.730> like<00:00:35.940> to<00:00:36.059> eat<00:00:36.090> them<00:00:36.210> all

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
so people don't like to eat them all

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.979 
so people don't like to eat them all
that<00:00:36.570> much<00:00:37.100> okay<00:00:38.100> it's<00:00:38.850> got<00:00:39.000> a<00:00:39.030> typical<00:00:39.719> pepper

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.850 
that much okay it's got a typical pepper

sort of the lanceolate shape to it okay
and<00:00:51.110> you<00:00:52.110> see<00:00:52.320> here<00:00:52.590> actually<00:00:52.980> I<00:00:53.309> didn't<00:00:53.550> know

and you see here actually I didn't know

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.250 
and you see here actually I didn't know
we<00:00:53.789> had<00:00:53.850> any<00:00:53.969> more<00:00:54.149> flowers<00:00:54.629> what<00:00:54.780> we<00:00:54.899> do

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
we had any more flowers what we do

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.260 
we had any more flowers what we do
this<00:00:56.160> is<00:00:56.309> a<00:00:56.340> typical<00:00:56.640> pepper<00:00:57.449> flower<00:00:58.020> okay<00:00:59.270> see

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
this is a typical pepper flower okay see

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.439 
this is a typical pepper flower okay see
there<00:01:00.859> yeah<00:01:01.859> they're<00:01:02.340> very<00:01:02.670> small<00:01:02.940> because<00:01:03.239> of

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
there yeah they're very small because of

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.590 
there yeah they're very small because of
this<00:01:03.600> particular<00:01:03.809> plants<00:01:04.470> it's<00:01:04.680> relatively

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600 
this particular plants it's relatively

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.830 
this particular plants it's relatively
small<00:01:06.600> peppers<00:01:07.400> but<00:01:08.400> you<00:01:09.119> typically<00:01:09.510> see<00:01:09.810> a

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
small peppers but you typically see a

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.670 
small peppers but you typically see a
small<00:01:11.270> flower<00:01:12.270> there<00:01:12.540> anyways<00:01:12.869> these<00:01:13.170> six

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
small flower there anyways these six

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.370 
small flower there anyways these six
little<00:01:13.920> petals<00:01:14.220> they're<00:01:14.659> why<00:01:15.689> that's<00:01:16.140> always

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
little petals they're why that's always

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.789 
little petals they're why that's always
the<00:01:16.770> color<00:01:16.979> of<00:01:17.250> pepper<00:01:18.119> flowers<00:01:18.720> and<00:01:19.650> then

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
the color of pepper flowers and then

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.100 
the color of pepper flowers and then
obviously<00:01:19.979> you<00:01:20.250> see<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.729> fruit<00:01:21.659> that<00:01:21.689> occur

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
obviously you see the fruit that occur

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.050 
obviously you see the fruit that occur
there<00:01:22.140> and<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:23.430> only<00:01:23.549> reason<00:01:24.030> that

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
there and the only reason that

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.210 
there and the only reason that
ornamental<00:01:24.600> peppers<00:01:24.780> are<00:01:25.080> used<00:01:25.380> is<00:01:25.710> for<00:01:26.070> the

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
ornamental peppers are used is for the

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.230 
ornamental peppers are used is for the
fruit<00:01:26.460> so<00:01:26.909> there<00:01:27.780> are<00:01:27.960> a<00:01:28.020> number<00:01:28.140> they're<00:01:28.680> so

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
fruit so there are a number they're so

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.960 
fruit so there are a number they're so
variable<00:01:30.240> from<00:01:30.600> one<00:01:30.810> to<00:01:31.140> another<00:01:31.409> we<00:01:32.220> see<00:01:32.460> some

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
variable from one to another we see some

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.969 
variable from one to another we see some
peppers<00:01:33.659> that<00:01:33.689> are<00:01:33.840> rounded<00:01:34.350> we<00:01:34.560> see<00:01:34.740> some

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
peppers that are rounded we see some

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.100 
peppers that are rounded we see some
peppers<00:01:35.340> that<00:01:35.369> are<00:01:35.549> this<00:01:36.150> cylindrical<00:01:36.540> look

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
peppers that are this cylindrical look

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.380 
peppers that are this cylindrical look
some<00:01:37.829> peppers<00:01:38.189> that<00:01:38.220> are<00:01:38.430> much<00:01:38.939> larger<00:01:39.150> than

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
some peppers that are much larger than

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.469 
some peppers that are much larger than
this<00:01:39.689> and<00:01:39.930> sort<00:01:40.380> of<00:01:40.470> cylindrical<00:01:41.479> some

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
this and sort of cylindrical some

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.039 
this and sort of cylindrical some
peppers<00:01:42.869> that<00:01:42.899> are<00:01:44.390> cylindrical<00:01:45.390> like<00:01:45.810> that

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
peppers that are cylindrical like that

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.170 
peppers that are cylindrical like that
but<00:01:46.200> they're<00:01:46.619> twisted<00:01:47.070> so<00:01:47.579> they<00:01:47.700> sort<00:01:47.970> of<00:01:48.000> have

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
but they're twisted so they sort of have

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.370 
but they're twisted so they sort of have
a

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.100 

and<00:01:51.830> a<00:01:51.950> nice<00:01:52.250> little<00:01:52.400> texture<00:01:52.880> will<00:01:53.150> change<00:01:53.840> to

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 
and a nice little texture will change to

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.340 
and a nice little texture will change to
them<00:01:54.640> one<00:01:55.640> I<00:01:55.670> can<00:01:55.939> think<00:01:56.150> of<00:01:56.299> Clopas<00:01:57.080> one

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
them one I can think of Clopas one

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.789 
them one I can think of Clopas one
called<00:01:57.619> Medusa<00:01:58.900> yeah<00:01:59.900> it's<00:02:00.049> sort<00:02:00.259> of<00:02:00.380> a<00:02:00.530> a

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:00.799 
called Medusa yeah it's sort of a a

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:03.430 
called Medusa yeah it's sort of a a
rounded<00:02:01.549> mound<00:02:01.580> but<00:02:02.509> the<00:02:02.720> peppers<00:02:03.229> are

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:03.440 
rounded mound but the peppers are

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.020 
rounded mound but the peppers are
twisted<00:02:04.100> and<00:02:04.280> it<00:02:04.580> sort<00:02:04.759> of<00:02:04.820> looks<00:02:04.970> like

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
twisted and it sort of looks like

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:10.090 
twisted and it sort of looks like
Medusa's<00:02:05.570> head<00:02:08.470> so<00:02:09.470> there's<00:02:09.679> a<00:02:09.739> number<00:02:09.950> of

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:10.100 
Medusa's head so there's a number of

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.080 
Medusa's head so there's a number of
different<00:02:10.250> cultivars<00:02:12.489> you<00:02:13.489> can<00:02:13.610> imagine<00:02:13.760> the

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
different cultivars you can imagine the

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:15.910 
different cultivars you can imagine the
different<00:02:14.390> types<00:02:14.600> of<00:02:14.750> fruits<00:02:15.020> so<00:02:15.590> then<00:02:15.770> you

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
different types of fruits so then you

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.449 
different types of fruits so then you
can<00:02:16.069> imagine<00:02:16.280> the<00:02:16.580> different<00:02:17.800> growth<00:02:18.800> habits

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:19.459 
can imagine the different growth habits

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:21.790 
can imagine the different growth habits
