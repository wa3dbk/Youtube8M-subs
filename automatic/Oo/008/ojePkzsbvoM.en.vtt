00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:25.640 
noises and I've tried to reset it but

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.179 
noises and I've tried to reset it but
I'm<00:00:26.640> gonna<00:00:26.820> try<00:00:27.029> and<00:00:27.090> do<00:00:27.269> this<00:00:27.359> one<00:00:27.539> more<00:00:27.750> time

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:28.189 
I'm gonna try and do this one more time

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:31.569 
I'm gonna try and do this one more time
for<00:00:29.189> some<00:00:29.369> reason<00:00:29.670> it<00:00:29.849> will<00:00:30.000> not<00:00:30.240> show<00:00:30.660> the

00:00:31.569 --> 00:00:31.579 
for some reason it will not show the

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:38.080 
for some reason it will not show the
what's<00:00:32.579> it<00:00:32.730> called<00:00:32.759> the<00:00:33.090> display<00:00:34.399> so<00:00:35.399> hold<00:00:36.270> on

a<00:01:04.690> hammer<00:01:04.960> I<00:01:05.290> will<00:01:05.979> see<00:01:06.190> how<00:01:06.370> well<00:01:06.550> the<00:01:06.700> screen

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.030 
a hammer I will see how well the screen

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:09.480 
a hammer I will see how well the screen
plays<00:01:07.330> out<00:01:07.540> over<00:01:07.570> here<00:01:07.990> and<00:01:08.140> we're<00:01:09.040> really

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
gonna see how strong Gorilla Glass 3

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.810 
gonna see how strong Gorilla Glass 3
really<00:01:13.060> is<00:01:13.270> because<00:01:13.630> first<00:01:14.350> so<00:01:15.010> far<00:01:15.310> and<00:01:15.640> my

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:15.820

experiences<00:01:16.570> doing<00:01:16.869> this<00:01:17.110> knife<00:01:17.380> scratch

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:17.740 
experiences doing this knife scratch

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.790 
experiences doing this knife scratch
test<00:01:18.160> and<00:01:18.430> this<00:01:18.580> 5<00:01:18.880> foot<00:01:19.119> drop<00:01:19.930> test<00:01:20.259> I'm<00:01:20.500> just

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:20.800 
test and this 5 foot drop test I'm just

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.940 
test and this 5 foot drop test I'm just
surprised<00:01:21.220> at<00:01:21.810> how<00:01:22.810> easily<00:01:23.140> this<00:01:23.500> thing<00:01:23.740> is

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:23.950 
surprised at how easily this thing is

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:29.730 
surprised at how easily this thing is
getting<00:01:24.160> destroyed<00:01:26.100> but<00:01:27.100> you<00:01:27.430> know<00:01:28.740> maybe

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:29.740 
getting destroyed but you know maybe

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.570 
getting destroyed but you know maybe
this<00:01:30.460> glass<00:01:31.119> really<00:01:31.570> is<00:01:31.750> resistant<00:01:32.410> so<00:01:32.619> I've

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:33.580 
this glass really is resistant so I've

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:44.520 
this glass really is resistant so I've
got<00:01:33.820> my<00:01:33.940> hammer<00:01:34.180> let's<00:01:35.170> do<00:01:35.380> it<00:01:35.530> oh<00:01:43.170> I<00:01:44.170> heard

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.530 
got my hammer let's do it oh I heard

00:01:44.530 --> 00:02:12.380 
got my hammer let's do it oh I heard
something<00:01:44.920> I<00:02:01.319> think<00:02:02.319> I<00:02:02.560> got<00:02:02.709> a<00:02:02.740> text<00:02:03.009> message

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.930 

so<00:02:13.390> I<00:02:13.420> could<00:02:13.840> tell<00:02:14.260> that<00:02:14.290> the<00:02:14.920> screen<00:02:15.790> is

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
so I could tell that the screen is

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.180 
so I could tell that the screen is
actually<00:02:16.330> really<00:02:16.840> strong<00:02:17.140> because<00:02:17.830> I'm<00:02:17.980> using

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
actually really strong because I'm using

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.110 
actually really strong because I'm using
pretty<00:02:18.819> much<00:02:18.910> full<00:02:19.270> force<00:02:20.459> like<00:02:21.459> a<00:02:21.640> regular

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
pretty much full force like a regular

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:27.140 
pretty much full force like a regular
just<00:02:22.510> kind<00:02:22.750> of<00:02:22.810> drop<00:02:23.200> you<00:02:23.380> know<00:02:23.500> hold<00:02:24.220> on<00:02:24.370> I

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.330 

mean<00:02:28.150> it<00:02:28.360> still<00:02:28.660> causes<00:02:29.130> scratches<00:02:30.130> either

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
mean it still causes scratches either

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.270 
mean it still causes scratches either
not<00:02:30.610> as<00:02:30.790> intense<00:02:31.630> and<00:02:31.930> visible<00:02:32.440> as<00:02:32.650> like<00:02:33.160> the

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
not as intense and visible as like the

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.870 
not as intense and visible as like the
iPhone<00:02:33.670> scratches<00:02:34.209> but<00:02:34.870> still<00:02:35.230> um<00:02:35.730> you<00:02:36.730> could

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
iPhone scratches but still um you could

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:38.699 
iPhone scratches but still um you could
still<00:02:37.150> see<00:02:37.330> the<00:02:37.480> scratches<00:02:37.750> are<00:02:38.110> very<00:02:38.380> light

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709 
still see the scratches are very light

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:42.360 
still see the scratches are very light
but<00:02:39.459> they're<00:02:39.700> very<00:02:40.030> delicate<00:02:40.300> so<00:02:40.950> like<00:02:41.950> the<00:02:42.130> 5

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
but they're very delicate so like the 5

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.059 
but they're very delicate so like the 5
foot<00:02:42.580> drop<00:02:42.880> test<00:02:43.180> you<00:02:43.390> know<00:02:43.830> even<00:02:44.830> though<00:02:44.920> it

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:45.069 
foot drop test you know even though it

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:47.610 
foot drop test you know even though it
was<00:02:45.220> very<00:02:45.250> it<00:02:45.790> wasn't<00:02:46.120> that<00:02:46.209> high<00:02:46.540> it<00:02:46.870> was

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
was very it wasn't that high it was

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.680 
was very it wasn't that high it was
they're<00:02:48.040> just<00:02:48.310> small<00:02:48.550> marks<00:02:48.940> all<00:02:49.150> over<00:02:49.510> though

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
they're just small marks all over though

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:51.540 
they're just small marks all over though
it<00:02:49.989> wasn't<00:02:50.290> really<00:02:50.440> intense<00:02:50.800> or<00:02:50.980> anything<00:02:51.190> I

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:51.550 
it wasn't really intense or anything I

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:53.040 
it wasn't really intense or anything I
don't<00:02:51.910> really<00:02:52.270> know<00:02:52.420> what<00:02:52.540> I'm<00:02:52.629> trying<00:02:52.750> to<00:02:52.870> say

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.050 
don't really know what I'm trying to say

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:56.490 
don't really know what I'm trying to say
but<00:02:53.290> I<00:02:53.500> think<00:02:53.980> that<00:02:54.190> the<00:02:54.819> Galaxy<00:02:55.420> s4<00:02:55.810> the

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
but I think that the Galaxy s4 the

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.920 
but I think that the Galaxy s4 the
screen<00:02:56.920> is<00:02:57.099> stronger<00:02:57.970> in<00:02:58.180> like<00:02:58.480> certain

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
screen is stronger in like certain

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.220 
screen is stronger in like certain
situations<00:02:59.730> but<00:03:00.730> let's<00:03:01.450> just<00:03:01.720> keep<00:03:01.960> doing

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
situations but let's just keep doing

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:10.089 
situations but let's just keep doing
this<00:03:02.350> a<00:03:02.410> little<00:03:02.620> more
