crinkles<00:01:55.720> in<00:01:55.869> it<00:01:56.020> and<00:01:56.229> now<00:01:56.830> we're<00:01:56.979> taking<00:01:57.310> the

00:01:57.389 --> 00:01:57.399 
crinkles in it and now we're taking the

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:59.550 
crinkles in it and now we're taking the
15<00:01:57.759> or<00:01:57.940> half<00:01:58.149> by<00:01:58.420> four<00:01:58.659> and<00:01:58.720> a<00:01:58.780> half<00:01:58.810> piece<00:01:59.229> and

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 
15 or half by four and a half piece and

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.859 
15 or half by four and a half piece and
with<00:01:59.830> the<00:01:59.950> nice<00:02:00.190> side<00:02:00.550> up<00:02:00.819> you're<00:02:01.479> gonna<00:02:01.630> want

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:01.869 
with the nice side up you're gonna want

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:04.919 
with the nice side up you're gonna want
to<00:02:01.899> fold<00:02:02.200> it<00:02:02.380> over<00:02:02.590> so<00:02:03.280> that<00:02:03.310> the<00:02:03.850> kind<00:02:04.300> of<00:02:04.360> more

00:02:04.919 --> 00:02:04.929 
to fold it over so that the kind of more

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:07.499 
to fold it over so that the kind of more
faded<00:02:05.170> side<00:02:05.530> is<00:02:05.770> facing<00:02:06.009> you<00:02:06.310> and<00:02:06.789> then<00:02:06.850> go

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:07.509 
faded side is facing you and then go

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:09.240 
faded side is facing you and then go
ahead<00:02:07.630> and<00:02:07.810> sew<00:02:08.200> it<00:02:08.350> at<00:02:08.530> the<00:02:08.679> edge<00:02:08.830> you<00:02:08.860> don't

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
ahead and sew it at the edge you don't

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.670 
ahead and sew it at the edge you don't
want<00:02:09.519> to<00:02:09.580> make<00:02:09.700> more<00:02:10.179> thicker<00:02:10.660> than<00:02:11.140> like<00:02:11.410> one

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
want to make more thicker than like one

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.009 
want to make more thicker than like one
inch<00:02:11.920> seam<00:02:12.370> you<00:02:12.880> want<00:02:13.060> it<00:02:13.120> to<00:02:13.209> be<00:02:13.330> pretty<00:02:13.600> small

00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:14.019 
inch seam you want it to be pretty small

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:16.140 
inch seam you want it to be pretty small
and<00:02:14.380> now<00:02:15.130> we're<00:02:15.280> gonna<00:02:15.370> go<00:02:15.549> ahead<00:02:15.730> and<00:02:15.880> flip<00:02:16.030> it

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
and now we're gonna go ahead and flip it

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:17.850 
and now we're gonna go ahead and flip it
over<00:02:16.269> so<00:02:16.450> that<00:02:16.660> the<00:02:16.900> seam<00:02:17.140> is<00:02:17.170> gonna<00:02:17.470> be<00:02:17.620> on<00:02:17.769> the

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
over so that the seam is gonna be on the

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.979 
over so that the seam is gonna be on the
inside<00:02:18.370> and<00:02:18.700> then<00:02:19.330> we're<00:02:19.450> gonna<00:02:19.540> go<00:02:19.750> ahead<00:02:19.870> and

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:19.989 
inside and then we're gonna go ahead and

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:21.449 
inside and then we're gonna go ahead and
iron<00:02:20.260> it<00:02:20.470> since<00:02:20.739> this<00:02:20.950> is<00:02:21.069> the<00:02:21.190> piece<00:02:21.430> that's

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
iron it since this is the piece that's

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:23.729 
iron it since this is the piece that's
going<00:02:22.090> to<00:02:22.330> go<00:02:22.660> around<00:02:22.989> your<00:02:23.170> hole<00:02:23.380> into<00:02:23.530> our

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:23.739 
going to go around your hole into our

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:29.479 
going to go around your hole into our
head

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:31.979 

so<00:02:30.489> go<00:02:30.640> ahead<00:02:30.760> and<00:02:30.879> do<00:02:31.090> the<00:02:31.239> same<00:02:31.450> thing<00:02:31.750> for

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989 
so go ahead and do the same thing for

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:34.440 
so go ahead and do the same thing for
that<00:02:32.140> 12<00:02:32.500> by<00:02:32.739> 2<00:02:32.800> inch<00:02:33.280> piece<00:02:33.640> you<00:02:33.910> want<00:02:34.060> to<00:02:34.180> flip

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
that 12 by 2 inch piece you want to flip

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.660 
that 12 by 2 inch piece you want to flip
it<00:02:34.599> over<00:02:34.750> so<00:02:35.110> it<00:02:35.650> makes<00:02:35.890> sure<00:02:35.980> that<00:02:36.099> the<00:02:36.430> seam

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
it over so it makes sure that the seam

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.000 
it over so it makes sure that the seam
is<00:02:36.700> no<00:02:37.239> larger<00:02:37.720> than<00:02:37.750> like<00:02:38.050> half<00:02:38.319> an<00:02:38.500> inch<00:02:38.709> and

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
is no larger than like half an inch and

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.970 
is no larger than like half an inch and
now<00:02:39.700> I<00:02:39.730> attached<00:02:40.300> a<00:02:40.660> safety<00:02:41.080> pin<00:02:41.290> to<00:02:41.500> that

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
now I attached a safety pin to that

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.729 
now I attached a safety pin to that
elastic<00:02:42.610> and<00:02:42.790> I'm<00:02:42.880> pulling<00:02:43.540> it<00:02:43.840> through<00:02:43.870> that

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739 
elastic and I'm pulling it through that

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:46.890 
elastic and I'm pulling it through that
fabric<00:02:45.700> and<00:02:46.090> you<00:02:46.300> want<00:02:46.450> to<00:02:46.510> make<00:02:46.599> sure<00:02:46.630> that

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
fabric and you want to make sure that

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.650 
fabric and you want to make sure that
the<00:02:47.019> edges<00:02:47.380> are<00:02:47.530> aligned<00:02:48.010> just<00:02:48.340> because<00:02:49.030> this

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
the edges are aligned just because this

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.630 
the edges are aligned just because this
the<00:02:50.170> fabric<00:02:50.530> is<00:02:50.650> going<00:02:50.739> to<00:02:50.830> stretch<00:02:51.220> as<00:02:51.489> the

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
the fabric is going to stretch as the

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.910 
the fabric is going to stretch as the
elastic<00:02:52.180> stretches<00:02:52.569> and<00:02:53.019> so<00:02:53.500> you<00:02:53.590> want<00:02:53.799> the

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
elastic stretches and so you want the

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.500 
elastic stretches and so you want the
middle<00:02:54.069> to<00:02:54.280> be<00:02:54.310> scrunched<00:02:54.879> up<00:02:55.030> at<00:02:55.239> the<00:02:55.360> edges

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
middle to be scrunched up at the edges

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.119 
middle to be scrunched up at the edges
to<00:02:55.870> be<00:02:55.959> aligned<00:02:56.290> and<00:02:56.560> I'm<00:02:56.620> gonna<00:02:56.739> go<00:02:56.920> ahead<00:02:57.010> and

00:02:57.119 --> 00:02:57.129 
to be aligned and I'm gonna go ahead and

00:02:57.129 --> 00:02:59.550 
to be aligned and I'm gonna go ahead and
sew<00:02:57.430> the<00:02:57.610> edges<00:02:57.810> also<00:02:58.810> just<00:02:59.140> so<00:02:59.260> that<00:02:59.410> you

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
sew the edges also just so that you

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.440 
sew the edges also just so that you
don't<00:02:59.739> lose<00:02:59.980> the<00:03:00.250> little<00:03:00.610> elastic<00:03:00.849> in<00:03:01.299> the

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
don't lose the little elastic in the

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.080 
don't lose the little elastic in the
fabric<00:03:01.930> and<00:03:02.140> with<00:03:02.860> that<00:03:02.980> 15<00:03:03.370> and<00:03:03.400> 1/2<00:03:03.579> piece

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
fabric and with that 15 and 1/2 piece

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:05.699 
fabric and with that 15 and 1/2 piece
you're<00:03:04.569> gonna<00:03:04.690> go<00:03:04.900> ahead<00:03:05.019> and<00:03:05.140> wrap<00:03:05.410> it<00:03:05.620> around

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
you're gonna go ahead and wrap it around

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:07.350 
you're gonna go ahead and wrap it around
the<00:03:06.040> little<00:03:06.190> scrunchie<00:03:06.819> that<00:03:06.849> we<00:03:07.150> just

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 
the little scrunchie that we just

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.479 
the little scrunchie that we just
created<00:03:07.780> and<00:03:08.110> this<00:03:08.620> is<00:03:08.739> gonna<00:03:08.890> create<00:03:09.220> the

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:09.489 
created and this is gonna create the

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:12.180 
created and this is gonna create the
base<00:03:09.970> for<00:03:10.000> the<00:03:10.630> headband<00:03:11.079> bow<00:03:11.440> and<00:03:11.769> it's

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
base for the headband bow and it's

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:15.030 
base for the headband bow and it's
basically<00:03:12.610> just<00:03:12.730> like<00:03:13.000> the<00:03:13.120> headband<00:03:13.750> and<00:03:14.040> you

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
basically just like the headband and you

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.710 
basically just like the headband and you
want<00:03:15.220> to<00:03:15.280> make<00:03:15.400> sure<00:03:15.579> that<00:03:15.760> you<00:03:15.940> arrange<00:03:16.329> it<00:03:16.510> so

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
want to make sure that you arrange it so

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.410 
want to make sure that you arrange it so
that<00:03:16.750> when<00:03:17.110> it's<00:03:17.290> gonna<00:03:17.470> go<00:03:17.829> on<00:03:18.130> your<00:03:18.370> head<00:03:18.819> it

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:20.880 
that when it's gonna go on your head it
won't<00:03:19.630> be<00:03:19.750> crinkled<00:03:20.230> or<00:03:20.530> a<00:03:20.560> wrap<00:03:20.860> around

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:20.890 
won't be crinkled or a wrap around

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:23.309 
won't be crinkled or a wrap around
strangely<00:03:21.819> so<00:03:21.970> make<00:03:22.120> sure<00:03:22.269> you<00:03:22.390> just<00:03:22.630> kind<00:03:23.290> of

00:03:23.309 --> 00:03:23.319 
strangely so make sure you just kind of

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:25.050 
strangely so make sure you just kind of
wrap<00:03:23.590> it<00:03:23.620> around<00:03:23.860> that<00:03:24.130> little<00:03:24.250> scrunchie<00:03:24.910> and

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
I'm gonna go ahead and sew it sewing it

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.250 
I'm gonna go ahead and sew it sewing it
will<00:03:27.400> ensure<00:03:27.880> that<00:03:27.910> it<00:03:28.180> stays<00:03:28.450> on<00:03:28.599> longer<00:03:28.840> and

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
will ensure that it stays on longer and

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.199 
will ensure that it stays on longer and
it<00:03:29.319> doesn't<00:03:29.680> just<00:03:29.799> unglue<00:03:30.430> but<00:03:30.940> if<00:03:31.000> you<00:03:31.060> want

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209 
it doesn't just unglue but if you want

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:53.739 
and a half piece it's literally just

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:56.160 
and a half piece it's literally just
like<00:03:54.040> a<00:03:54.100> random<00:03:54.400> oval<00:03:55.090> I'm<00:03:55.630> gonna<00:03:55.959> go<00:03:56.079> ahead

like a random oval I'm gonna go ahead

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:58.680 
like a random oval I'm gonna go ahead
and<00:03:56.500> fold<00:03:56.889> it<00:03:57.160> I<00:03:57.400> realized<00:03:58.000> after<00:03:58.180> this<00:03:58.510> you're

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:58.690 
and fold it I realized after this you're

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:00.930 
and fold it I realized after this you're
supposed<00:03:58.810> to<00:03:59.049> sew<00:03:59.350> another<00:03:59.859> piece<00:04:00.130> on<00:04:00.340> top<00:04:00.730> of

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:00.940 
supposed to sew another piece on top of

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:03.479 
supposed to sew another piece on top of
it<00:04:01.120> but<00:04:01.810> I<00:04:02.200> think<00:04:02.440> it<00:04:02.560> looks<00:04:02.769> fine<00:04:03.040> with<00:04:03.310> just

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:03.489 
it but I think it looks fine with just

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:05.520 
it but I think it looks fine with just
one<00:04:03.730> piece<00:04:04.090> it<00:04:04.389> might<00:04:04.810> be<00:04:04.959> like<00:04:05.079> a<00:04:05.139> little<00:04:05.260> bit

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
one piece it might be like a little bit

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:07.680 
one piece it might be like a little bit
thicker<00:04:05.799> and<00:04:05.950> near<00:04:06.790> but<00:04:07.090> I<00:04:07.239> think<00:04:07.420> it<00:04:07.510> looks

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:07.690 
thicker and near but I think it looks

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:09.089 
thicker and near but I think it looks
really<00:04:07.750> cute<00:04:08.079> with<00:04:08.170> one<00:04:08.349> piece<00:04:08.590> and<00:04:08.829> I<00:04:08.859> kind<00:04:09.069> of

00:04:09.089 --> 00:04:09.099 
really cute with one piece and I kind of

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:10.710 
really cute with one piece and I kind of
like<00:04:09.220> the<00:04:09.370> messy<00:04:09.730> feel<00:04:09.970> that<00:04:10.150> it<00:04:10.269> gives<00:04:10.480> I

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 
like the messy feel that it gives I

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.120 
like the messy feel that it gives I
think<00:04:11.049> it's<00:04:11.200> a<00:04:11.260> really<00:04:11.440> cute<00:04:11.650> kind<00:04:11.920> of<00:04:12.010> like
