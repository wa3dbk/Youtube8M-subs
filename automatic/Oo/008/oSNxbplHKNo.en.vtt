 hello guitarists and future guitarists 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:21.260
 welcome to once again do my 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:22.460
 guitar you know what is the website

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.180
 tutorials to learn how to play the 

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:28.279
 guitar free and in Spanish but 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:30.259
 I extract this theme plus is very simple 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:31.700
 for the time he has a remittance like that 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:33.380
 sugar cane that will also come very well 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:35.329
 for those who are introducing 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.890
 in the blues world and to practice a 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:38.870
 little bit of scales like that, some punctures 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.030
 accompanied by chords will come from 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.380
 wonder is also these issues that I 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.750
 like to bring those who also know that you 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:46.250
 like 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:48.350
 which you learn from me and then already 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.180
 you are building from this one 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.010
 your own creations and that's 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.579
 fantastic to go improvising to improve 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.699
 little by little 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:58.399
 your own technique from a 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:01:00.469
 little help that we all need in 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:02.929
 base for example of this you can compose 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:06.050
 a whole song can not help us 

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:07.280
 making track for a lot of things like that 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:08.780
 that we're not going to do anything, we 're going to go 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.100
 learn it step by step and with everything 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.840
 detail do not forget to like 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.130
 add favorites and subscribe 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.990
 because you will be jumping from all 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.850
 news of fermi guitar no longer you 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.870
 you will lose any new tutorial so 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.670
 nothing are you ready 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:22.860
 worth guitarists first of all I'm going 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.230
 to teach the picking is very simple and is 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.020
 repetitive is to say what we are going to play in 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:30.420
 two ropes but it's exactly the same 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.600
 in agreement we put the index finger in 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.270
 the fifth fifth string fret and we're going to 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.429
 touch once 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:40.719
 now with the ring finger we are going to touch 

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:44.119
 the fifth string the seventh fret 

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:47.179
 we return to the index finger fifth string 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:49.130
 fifth fret and 15 fourth fret string 

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:54.610
 with the same index finger we are going to see him 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:57.490
 slow motion and the chords would already enter 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:01.600
 we are going to do this here 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:04.090
 and here but it's exactly the same 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.470
 changing the rope from the fifth to the 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.000
 fourth and from the fourth to the fifth we're going 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.649
 to go playing with our strings at 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.780
 that is to say, you can change as 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:14.640
 you want according to the chords that we're going 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:17.190
 to use are a the greater a greater re 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.950
 yumi greater at the end to give that touch 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.600
 final memories are very chords 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.130
 simple but if you still do not know how 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.930
 touch them I recommend you click 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.459
 here you will take a series of videos 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.100
 in which I explain to you step by step and with 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:31.020
 every detail how to play these chords if 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.180
 you know how to play we're going to continue 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:34.709
 with the explanation of this subject to 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.510
 edit are you going to start playing the 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:38.730
 I tap on the fifth string after 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.170
 we will go to play in the we will change to 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.900
 touch the pointer on the fourth string 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:45.300
 we will play a king and return high to 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.250
 play the plucking on the fifth string and 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:49.820
 we will end with a rhythm in the according 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.820
 let's see it 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.650
 Y 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:03.420
 Y 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.420
 i 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.980
 Clear 

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:10.920
 and now we could finish it and go 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.750
 to incorporate is already agreed to 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.350
 finalize the topic would be for example 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.350
 in the following way 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.450
 i 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.099
 you 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:36.010
 this could be a good ending for this 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:37.300
 super easy blues theme and nothing I hope
