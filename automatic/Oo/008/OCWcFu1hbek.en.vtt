were<00:00:29.839> to<00:00:29.900> pull<00:00:30.650> the<00:00:30.859> thread<00:00:31.330> it<00:00:32.330> would<00:00:32.660> rotate

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:32.870 
were to pull the thread it would rotate

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:40.240 
were to pull the thread it would rotate
clockwise<00:00:36.160> and<00:00:37.160> take<00:00:37.789> this<00:00:38.000> and<00:00:38.980> put<00:00:39.980> it<00:00:40.039> on

clockwise and take this and put it on
your<00:00:40.899> the<00:00:41.899> place<00:00:42.140> where<00:00:42.289> the<00:00:42.379> thread<00:00:42.590> goes<00:00:42.829> the

00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:43.579 
your the place where the thread goes the

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:45.160 
your the place where the thread goes the
thread<00:00:43.820> doohickey<00:00:44.270> what<00:00:44.660> i<00:00:44.719> like<00:00:44.899> to<00:00:44.989> call<00:00:45.020> it
