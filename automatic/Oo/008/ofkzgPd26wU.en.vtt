you know holding them in tight another

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.250 
you know holding them in tight another
one<00:00:50.700> on<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:50.940> other<00:00:50.969> side<00:00:51.329> and<00:00:51.570> some<00:00:52.020> plate

one on the other side and some plate
steel<00:00:55.039> got<00:00:56.039> some<00:00:56.190> half-inch<00:00:56.760> all<00:00:57.629> thread<00:00:58.020> here

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
steel got some half-inch all thread here

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.549 
steel got some half-inch all thread here
holding<00:00:58.500> it<00:00:58.590> all<00:00:58.710> together<00:00:59.570> make<00:01:00.570> it<00:01:00.600> a<00:01:00.840> little

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
holding it all together make it a little

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:08.380 
holding it all together make it a little
more<00:01:01.680> stiff<00:01:03.589> then<00:01:04.589> just<00:01:05.400> wire<00:01:05.640> it<00:01:05.670> up<00:01:06.920> find<00:01:07.920> out

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.390 
more stiff then just wire it up find out

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:14.810 
more stiff then just wire it up find out
what<00:01:09.830> speed<00:01:10.830> you<00:01:10.979> want<00:01:11.130> it<00:01:13.310> we<00:01:14.310> got<00:01:14.460> this<00:01:14.580> one

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
what speed you want it we got this one

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.649 
what speed you want it we got this one
turnin<00:01:15.119> it'll<00:01:15.330> actually<00:01:15.900> turn<00:01:16.290> and<00:01:16.470> reverse

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:17.659 
turnin it'll actually turn and reverse

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:20.270 
turnin it'll actually turn and reverse
but<00:01:18.659> it's<00:01:18.780> a<00:01:18.869> lot<00:01:19.020> slower<00:01:19.290> in<00:01:19.560> Reverse<00:01:19.890> than<00:01:20.159> it

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
but it's a lot slower in Reverse than it

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.120 
but it's a lot slower in Reverse than it
is<00:01:20.460> and<00:01:20.700> forward<00:01:21.390> so<00:01:22.320> I<00:01:22.380> got<00:01:22.560> that<00:01:22.740> all<00:01:22.890> wired

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
is and forward so I got that all wired

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.719 
is and forward so I got that all wired
up<00:01:23.869> still<00:01:24.869> got<00:01:25.020> a<00:01:25.049> little<00:01:25.310> odds<00:01:26.310> and<00:01:26.490> ends<00:01:26.610> to

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
up still got a little odds and ends to

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.149 
up still got a little odds and ends to
get<00:01:27.060> rid<00:01:27.240> of<00:01:27.270> these<00:01:27.360> wires<00:01:27.659> and<00:01:27.900> whatnot<00:01:28.259> here

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159

my duck dunker that I made it's got that

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.309 
my duck dunker that I made it's got that
running<00:02:27.480> over<00:02:27.750> to<00:02:27.989> the<00:02:28.050> battery<00:02:30.019> see<00:02:31.019> what<00:02:31.230> it

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
running over to the battery see what it

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:36.860 
running over to the battery see what it
looks<00:02:31.800> like<00:02:31.950> I<00:02:34.940> don't<00:02:35.940> have<00:02:36.030> any<00:02:36.150> decoys<00:02:36.330> on<00:02:36.720> it

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
looks like I don't have any decoys on it

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:43.000 
looks like I don't have any decoys on it
yet<00:02:37.019> but<00:02:37.260> this<00:02:37.650> would<00:02:37.769> just<00:02:37.950> give<00:02:38.099> you<00:02:38.190> an<00:02:38.310> idea

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.640 

real<00:02:44.010> quiet<00:02:44.780> flex<00:02:45.780> it's<00:02:45.930> pretty<00:02:46.140> good
