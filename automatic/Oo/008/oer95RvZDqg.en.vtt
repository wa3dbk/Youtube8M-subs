00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.670
 hi youtubers I had reached the 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:19.599
 request how to make a blush type 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:23.050
 marble so I have this and I ended up 

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:25.599
 the asepsis is the natural tone and already 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:30.069
 dispute with the same method out there 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:32.110
 I leave the video link and I already have the 

00:00:30.069 --> 00:00:35.890
 pota and empty then what I'm going to do 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:39.490
 is to empty this blush is the tone 4 that 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:41.470
 it's very clear to me and then some 

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:44.100
 shadows that also have something 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:47.470
 of time that I do not occupy about 4 months 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:52.690
 then I'm going to empty them to go 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:54.730
 pink a red is matte red tone and this 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:58.239
 it's like silver to give it a 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:01:01.720
 shinny be very very very striking father 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:05.410
 and quite natural by the way 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:08.110
 then with alcohol of 96 what we 're going 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:11.290
 to do is to throw our powders 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:14.490
 without mixing them so much so that 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:18.000
 look like a kind of marble 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.740
 without mixing it let's give them light 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.290
 taps for alcohol to enter 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:26.340
 to the bottom of the boat 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:28.350
 there we are going to take more alcohol and there 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.450
 let it sit a little and evaporate 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.420
 a little alcohol and then if 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:37.050
 Engages a cloth making pressure 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:39.870
 even with your whole hand to do 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:42.450
 pressure and of course it is going to overflow 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:45.870
 by the sides what you have to 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:49.110
 to do is take it and put it inside the 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:52.440
 pot little by little if you take what is 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.990
 down is the same and you repeat the operation 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:57.560
 on one side of your rag it was removed and that 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:01.290
 believe youtubers this is all here is 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:04.320
 the blush finished with all the post 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:07.200
 empty and this is the tone you saw the 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:10.550
 spots are everywhere here already 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.550
 It was clean from the back 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.650
 this is all so you already know youtubers 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.540
 if you liked lehman and you're up 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.940
 share on their social networks and 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:23.500
 retweets and above all to tell me that they 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:26.500
 the tipÃ­n seemed the proposal so 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.500
 bye
