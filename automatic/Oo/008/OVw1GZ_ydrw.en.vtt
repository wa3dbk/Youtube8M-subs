00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:15.850 
you off so she gets a points for that
anyway<00:06:14.420> this<00:06:14.600> is<00:06:14.780> a<00:06:14.810> good<00:06:15.050> figure<00:06:15.260> I<00:06:15.410> like<00:06:15.680> it

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:15.860 
anyway this is a good figure I like it

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:17.710 
anyway this is a good figure I like it
it<00:06:16.280> shouldn't<00:06:16.520> running<00:06:16.730> too<00:06:16.880> much<00:06:17.090> either<00:06:17.300> for

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:17.720 
it shouldn't running too much either for

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:19.290 
it shouldn't running too much either for
some<00:06:17.840> reason<00:06:18.140> Beast<00:06:18.350> Machines<00:06:18.530> isn't<00:06:19.070> really

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:19.300 
some reason Beast Machines isn't really

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:22.240 
some reason Beast Machines isn't really
too<00:06:20.300> popular<00:06:20.600> suffer<00:06:21.560> maybe<00:06:21.770> a<00:06:21.830> couple<00:06:22.100> of

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:22.250 
too popular suffer maybe a couple of

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:23.560 
too popular suffer maybe a couple of
figures<00:06:22.580> but<00:06:22.730> this<00:06:22.910> isn't<00:06:23.270> one<00:06:23.300> of<00:06:23.420> those

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:23.570 
figures but this isn't one of those

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:25.120

figures so you should be able to get up

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:27.190 
figures so you should be able to get up
