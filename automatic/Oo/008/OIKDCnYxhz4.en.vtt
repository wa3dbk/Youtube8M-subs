00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
happen during the winter time and if

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.840 
happen during the winter time and if
you're<00:00:57.059> familiar<00:00:57.329> with<00:00:57.629> rail<00:00:58.590> expansion<00:00:59.430> and

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
you're familiar with rail expansion and

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.810 
you're familiar with rail expansion and
contraction<00:01:00.000> that<00:01:00.859> usually<00:01:01.859> happens<00:01:02.280> when

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
contraction that usually happens when

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.700 
contraction that usually happens when
the<00:01:03.030> weather<00:01:03.239> gets<00:01:03.420> cold<00:01:03.570> or<00:01:04.019> hot<00:01:04.260> you<00:01:04.619> know

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
when it's cold it contracts and when

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.070 
when it's cold it contracts and when
it's<00:01:07.890> hot<00:01:08.070> it<00:01:08.220> expands<00:01:08.820> so<00:01:09.030> using<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:09.869> same

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
it's hot it expands so using the same

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.190 
it's hot it expands so using the same
principles<00:01:10.909> you<00:01:11.909> can<00:01:11.970> just<00:01:12.360> get<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.750> well<00:01:12.930> car
