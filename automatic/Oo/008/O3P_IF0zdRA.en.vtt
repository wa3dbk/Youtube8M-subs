00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.549
 sometimes that feels like this one 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:08.099
 thing is in your life where you again 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.110
 and grow again and where you we again 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:13.230
 have the feeling that you do not step 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.330
 comes first and what you maybe then 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.539
 Do you make that history 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:22.920
 he admits that you are just not good 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:25.410
 in this one thing or you always 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.840
 flows things happen what this one 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.680
 thing concerns that you always have bad luck 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.680
 in this one thing 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:39.360
 I have my camera here and I had 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:43.170
 wonder why on all my 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.820
 photos I'm doing lately 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.800
 all so slightly a bit out of focus 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.539
 they do not really want all that 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:53.340
 to look crystal clear until my clothes are 

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:58.129
 that I'm a bit messy on the 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:01:00.870
 lens had dirt on the lens and 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:03.300
 that's exactly what in my life 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.880
 happens if you have the impression that 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.619
 somehow your picture is what you want 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.330
 your life has that at one 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.900
 place in any area of ​​yours 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:15.630
 life is not completely clean 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:17.640
 if you think okay i mean everything and mine 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.290
 life is okay so far except for 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.210
 this one place this one 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.799
 I just do not get baked 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.229
 I just get that one job 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:30.200
 not sharp around in the metaphor of that 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:33.720
 stay food when you realize that 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:35.070
 always in the same place in yours 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.990
 Living that means always in the same area 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.439
 in your life but in 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.329
 different situations always there 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.990
 you do not work again and again 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.729
 increases 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.950
 then it is like when you are with yours 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.110
 camera is running through the area and you 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.259
 realize that you are always at a certain 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.360
 make his picture the image out of focus 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.850
 is and no matter where the photo is 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:00.719
 no matter where in the world it does not matter 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:02.640
 which which which objects 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:04.350
 photography is or which subjects 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.469
 always photograph it on the same 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.360
 ask and sharp what do you say that that 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.340
 told her if it is always the same 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.620
 create and create 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.810
 no matter where I am then it can only be 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:18.819
 I can only lie on the lens 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:21.560
 through which I see the world 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:23.810
 and just as in your life is the 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.450
 means when you realize that you are constant 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:30.860
 again and again in one area 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:32.870
 your life over and over again 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.519
 on the wall for the first time or again 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.530
 at a certain point to text and 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:37.180
 you can not get further then you can 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.970
 knowledge 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:43.459
 it is not the lying out there 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.299
 Otherwise, the lens with which I am the 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:46.459
 perceive things 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:50.480
 that means I have obviously easy here 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:52.640
 lifestyles and that helps you 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.260
 the lookout you see hey that 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.150
 problem is not somewhere out there where 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.970
 I can do nothing about it but that 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:02.000
 problem is on my lens the problem 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:03.890
 lies in me in it the problem is from 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.489
 I can generate in the moment 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:06.799
 you do something 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:08.930
 In the case of the camera, everything I do 

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:12.650
 is that i can do a piece of paper 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:15.440
 take or take a cloth and the lens 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:19.549
 clean and everything is clean from now on 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:22.910
 everything I photograph and fall in love 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:25.430
 of your life the moment you are 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:27.049
 notice that this is a job or 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.670
 more places where you again and 

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:31.190
 again at aixtron where we are not again 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:32.959
 you want to go on your inner lens 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:35.180
 cleaning an inner lens are yours 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:39.380
 thoughts about things are yours 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:41.780
 his beliefs are yours 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:45.109
 Conviction of what you believe to be true 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:47.419
 means and what you think is possible and what 

00:03:45.109 --> 00:03:52.180
 You can use techniques for that 

00:03:47.419 --> 00:03:56.450
 Techniques like affirmations like technology 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:57.410

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:09.459
 German 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:11.780
 that is www.ee hwk point com / german 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:16.039
 that's a great technique with the 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:20.160
 you with whom you can find out where 

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:21.989
 dirt in your life 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.270
 on the island where you find yours 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:27.120
 Perception errors where you where you 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:30.150
 it looks a little different in truth 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:31.170
 and therefore comes up against resistance 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:33.960
 therefore not in your life 

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:35.790
 the only reason you come in 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:40.050
 your life ever 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:42.570
 being dissatisfied is because of yours 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:44.340
 Perception falls apart with what 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:46.050
 really that is the only reason 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:47.610
 were ever to be us peace 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:49.650
 can the definition of 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:52.740
 dissatisfaction is that 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:54.690
 falling apart from expectation that 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:56.580
 is the name of something in your head 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:59.310
 it is possible and the reality 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:00.870
 that is, what is out there and that 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:02.610
 only reason why this can happen 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:03.000
 only reason why fall apart 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:05.760
 can 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.040
 what the camera sees in her sensor and 

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:09.090
 what is in front of her lens is that the 

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:12.630
 lens is dirty 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:15.270
 because the camera takes everything exactly on 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:18.330
 the sensor takes everything exactly as it does 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:21.780
 is on it by the lens falls on him 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:24.000
 from outside and therefore always when you 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:26.280
 realize that there is this one place 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.440
 that one place in your picture 

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:30.630
 this one place in your life or 

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:33.780
 even more sites where the there 

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:35.730
 again and again dirt appears or 

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:37.440
 that there is not right there 

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:39.630
 wants to be sharp or not right 

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:41.160
 It's clear that you do not want to be 

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:43.560
 feel really comfortable on the spot or 

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:44.730
 you are dissatisfied then you know there is 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:47.160
 a bit of dirt on the list and 

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:49.500
 then checkout apply targeted techniques 

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:52.980
 this one of them is a technique 

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:54.810
 takes from the lens arm to clean and 

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:57.180
 to clean and from then 

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:59.760
 from then on everything is fine from then on 

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:02.880
 Do you have a clear view just like me 

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:05.730

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:07.710
