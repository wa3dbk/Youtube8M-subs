it a try I bought this kimono style over
thing<00:00:50.600> what<00:00:51.600> would<00:00:51.690> you<00:00:51.809> even<00:00:51.930> call<00:00:52.050> it<00:00:52.199> like

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
thing what would you even call it like

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.110 
thing what would you even call it like
jacket<00:00:52.770> I<00:00:52.890> guess<00:00:52.949> I<00:00:53.280> picked<00:00:53.460> a<00:00:53.579> really<00:00:53.730> pretty

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
jacket I guess I picked a really pretty

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.810 
jacket I guess I picked a really pretty
white<00:00:54.750> floral<00:00:55.289> pattern<00:00:55.890> it<00:00:56.250> doesn't<00:00:56.610> wrinkle

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
white floral pattern it doesn't wrinkle

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.400 
white floral pattern it doesn't wrinkle
quite<00:00:57.210> easily<00:00:57.390> so<00:00:57.750> I<00:00:57.780> don't<00:00:57.989> think<00:00:58.170> this<00:00:58.260> would

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
quite easily so I don't think this would

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.439 
quite easily so I don't think this would
be<00:00:58.530> very<00:00:58.710> good<00:00:58.829> for<00:00:59.039> travel<00:00:59.430> but<00:00:59.609> I<00:00:59.670> think<00:00:59.969> just

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
be very good for travel but I think just

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.479 
be very good for travel but I think just
to<00:01:00.510> throw<00:01:00.750> in<00:01:00.899> at<00:01:00.989> home<00:01:01.170> you<00:01:01.590> know<00:01:01.710> on<00:01:02.039> a<00:01:02.070> lazy
