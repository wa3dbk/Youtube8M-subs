00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
good tech card well let's look at how

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.930 
good tech card well let's look at how
the<00:00:31.019> format<00:00:31.529> shaping<00:00:32.099> up<00:00:32.219> and<00:00:32.399> see<00:00:32.489> how<00:00:32.669> we<00:00:32.730> can

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
the format shaping up and see how we can

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.940 
the format shaping up and see how we can
best<00:00:33.180> use<00:00:33.300> battle<00:00:33.780> fader<00:00:33.989> to<00:00:34.260> our<00:00:34.500> advantage

best use battle fader to our advantage

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.610 
best use battle fader to our advantage
the<00:00:35.550> format<00:00:36.090> has<00:00:36.239> evolved<00:00:36.809> to<00:00:36.930> a<00:00:36.960> point<00:00:37.320> where

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
the format has evolved to a point where

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.910 
the format has evolved to a point where
a<00:00:37.860> lot<00:00:37.890> of<00:00:38.640> games<00:00:38.969> are<00:00:39.180> over<00:00:39.690> by<00:00:39.870> turn<00:00:40.230> -<00:00:40.710> or

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
a lot of games are over by turn - or

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.580 
a lot of games are over by turn - or
even<00:00:41.100> turn<00:00:41.520> three<00:00:41.940> and<00:00:42.180> that<00:00:42.660> is<00:00:42.690> insanely

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
even turn three and that is insanely

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.430 
even turn three and that is insanely
fast<00:00:44.219> and<00:00:44.730> so<00:00:45.210> we're<00:00:45.390> battle<00:00:45.840> faders<00:00:46.200> so

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
fast and so we're battle faders so

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.920 
fast and so we're battle faders so
effective<00:00:47.129> is<00:00:47.430> that<00:00:47.700> when<00:00:48.180> your<00:00:48.300> opponent

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
effective is that when your opponent

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.840 
effective is that when your opponent
knows<00:00:49.260> that<00:00:49.710> they<00:00:49.890> can<00:00:50.129> go<00:00:50.309> for<00:00:50.610> a<00:00:50.640> game<00:00:50.820> and

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
knows that they can go for a game and

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.720 
knows that they can go for a game and
they<00:00:51.180> can<00:00:51.329> ensure<00:00:51.539> game<00:00:52.140> they<00:00:52.829> will<00:00:53.039> commit<00:00:53.550> as

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
they can ensure game they will commit as

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.450 
they can ensure game they will commit as
many<00:00:54.270> resources<00:00:54.750> as<00:00:55.199> possible<00:00:55.530> to<00:00:55.949> make<00:00:56.190> sure

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
many resources as possible to make sure

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.090 
many resources as possible to make sure
that<00:00:56.610> that<00:00:56.760> otk<00:00:57.360> goes<00:00:57.600> through<00:00:58.020> and<00:00:58.289> so<00:00:58.800> you

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
that that otk goes through and so you

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.040 
that that otk goes through and so you
slap<00:00:59.609> down<00:00:59.850> a<00:00:59.910> battle<00:01:00.390> later<00:01:00.629> when<00:01:00.899> they're

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
slap down a battle later when they're

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.410 
slap down a battle later when they're
committing<00:01:01.530> to<00:01:01.649> that<00:01:01.739> otk<00:01:02.399> they're<00:01:03.000> gonna<00:01:03.180> be

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
committing to that otk they're gonna be

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.299 
committing to that otk they're gonna be
in<00:01:03.539> an<00:01:03.660> awful<00:01:04.260> position<00:01:04.290> because<00:01:05.129> they've

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
in an awful position because they've

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.100 
in an awful position because they've
committed<00:01:05.790> nearly<00:01:06.240> all<00:01:06.390> of<00:01:06.450> their<00:01:06.720> resources

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
committed nearly all of their resources

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.280 
committed nearly all of their resources
to<00:01:07.530> that<00:01:07.560> and<00:01:07.950> they<00:01:08.580> didn't<00:01:08.939> get<00:01:09.150> game<00:01:09.570> and<00:01:09.900> so

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
to that and they didn't get game and so

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.810 
to that and they didn't get game and so
then<00:01:10.439> you<00:01:10.650> can<00:01:10.830> go<00:01:11.070> ahead<00:01:11.189> and<00:01:11.490> turn<00:01:11.670> the

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
then you can go ahead and turn the

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.880

be<00:01:45.659> nearly<00:01:46.170> out<00:01:46.380> of<00:01:46.740> resources<00:01:47.159> and<00:01:47.670> you<00:01:47.729> can

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
be nearly out of resources and you can

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.880 
be nearly out of resources and you can
just<00:01:48.299> totally<00:01:48.600> swing<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.259> game<00:01:49.439> around<00:01:49.740> in

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
just totally swing the game around in

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.980 
just totally swing the game around in
your<00:01:50.040> favor<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.820> same<00:01:51.119> theory<00:01:51.479> applies<00:01:51.780> for

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
your favor the same theory applies for

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.840 
your favor the same theory applies for
decks<00:01:52.140> like<00:01:52.320> cliff<00:01:52.649> Lords<00:01:52.920> and<00:01:53.070> neck<00:01:53.310> loss<00:01:53.549> and

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
decks like cliff Lords and neck loss and

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.060 
decks like cliff Lords and neck loss and
what<00:01:53.939> happens<00:01:54.360> is<00:01:54.600> they<00:01:55.079> eventually<00:01:55.770> run<00:01:56.040> out

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
what happens is they eventually run out

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.609 
what happens is they eventually run out
of<00:01:56.189> steam<00:01:56.700> and<00:01:57.090> so<00:01:57.479> battle<00:01:57.930> fader<00:01:58.079> is<00:01:58.229> really

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
of steam and so battle fader is really

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.469 
of steam and so battle fader is really
good<00:01:59.009> because<00:01:59.460> you're<00:01:59.640> pampering<00:02:00.270> their

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
good because you're pampering their

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.319 
good because you're pampering their
ability<00:02:01.020> to<00:02:01.049> otk<00:02:01.770> you<00:02:01.829> and<00:02:02.250> so<00:02:02.759> then<00:02:02.939> it<00:02:03.060> puts

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
ability to otk you and so then it puts

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.389 
ability to otk you and so then it puts
them<00:02:03.479> in<00:02:03.540> a<00:02:03.689> really<00:02:04.110> awful<00:02:04.350> position<00:02:04.770> because

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
them in a really awful position because

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:06.200 
them in a really awful position because
having<00:02:05.610> too

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
having too

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.749 
having too
those<00:02:06.450> resources<00:02:07.200> to<00:02:07.890> build<00:02:08.069> a<00:02:08.190> push<00:02:08.490> for<00:02:08.700> that

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
those resources to build a push for that

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.480 
those resources to build a push for that
otk<00:02:09.420> is<00:02:09.740> really<00:02:10.740> dangerous

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:11.490 
otk is really dangerous

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:12.920 
otk is really dangerous
but<00:02:11.760> bound<00:02:12.030> later<00:02:12.330> has<00:02:12.540> other<00:02:12.810> applications

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
but bound later has other applications

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.860 
but bound later has other applications
as<00:02:13.740> well<00:02:13.950> once<00:02:14.580> your<00:02:14.700> opponent's<00:02:15.270> turn<00:02:15.390> ends

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
as well once your opponent's turn ends

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.050 
as well once your opponent's turn ends
and<00:02:15.990> your<00:02:16.140> turn<00:02:16.440> begins<00:02:16.800> you<00:02:17.310> can<00:02:17.459> tribute<00:02:17.790> off

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
and your turn begins you can tribute off

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.520 
and your turn begins you can tribute off
that<00:02:18.270> battle<00:02:18.660> fader<00:02:18.840> for<00:02:19.080> something<00:02:19.380> like<00:02:19.500> a

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
that battle fader for something like a

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.770 
that battle fader for something like a
majesty<00:02:20.190> speed<00:02:20.490> or<00:02:20.700> a<00:02:20.730> vanity<00:02:21.240> speed<00:02:21.540> and

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
majesty speed or a vanity speed and

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.300 
majesty speed or a vanity speed and
that's<00:02:22.260> huge

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
that's huge

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:24.740 
that's huge
let<00:02:23.640> me<00:02:23.730> know<00:02:23.819> down<00:02:24.000> in<00:02:24.060> the<00:02:24.209> comments<00:02:24.630> what

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
let me know down in the comments what

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.600 
let me know down in the comments what
you<00:02:25.020> guys<00:02:25.050> think<00:02:25.590> about<00:02:25.680> battle<00:02:26.220> fader<00:02:26.400> I

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
you guys think about battle fader I

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.280 
you guys think about battle fader I
think<00:02:26.850> it's<00:02:27.000> really<00:02:27.569> powerful<00:02:27.780> right<00:02:28.260> now

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
think it's really powerful right now

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.680 
think it's really powerful right now
with<00:02:28.650> the<00:02:28.770> ability<00:02:29.250> to<00:02:29.370> stop<00:02:29.700> ot<00:02:30.120> Kay's<00:02:30.360> and

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
with the ability to stop ot Kay's and

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.020 
with the ability to stop ot Kay's and
compared<00:02:31.380> to<00:02:31.470> something<00:02:31.680> like<00:02:31.830> Gore's<00:02:32.340> Gore's

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
compared to something like Gore's Gore's

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.640 
compared to something like Gore's Gore's
requires<00:02:33.450> you<00:02:33.630> to<00:02:33.660> have<00:02:33.840> an<00:02:33.959> empty<00:02:34.319> field

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
requires you to have an empty field

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.740 
requires you to have an empty field
where<00:02:34.890> battle<00:02:35.280> fader<00:02:35.489> just<00:02:36.030> you<00:02:36.270> can<00:02:36.420> go<00:02:36.630> ahead

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
where battle fader just you can go ahead

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.240 
where battle fader just you can go ahead
and<00:02:36.959> throw<00:02:37.260> them<00:02:37.440> out<00:02:37.560> if<00:02:37.770> your<00:02:37.890> opponent

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
and throw them out if your opponent

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.340 
and throw them out if your opponent
declares<00:02:38.580> a<00:02:38.670> direct<00:02:38.970> attack<00:02:39.330> and<00:02:39.510> that's<00:02:40.019> it

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
declares a direct attack and that's it

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:41.570 
declares a direct attack and that's it
you<00:02:40.530> end<00:02:40.650> the<00:02:40.769> battle<00:02:40.950> phase<00:02:41.100> you
