it across a bit giraffe it's not isn't
that<00:05:56.610> long<00:05:56.880> but<00:05:57.300> I<00:05:57.630> suppose<00:05:58.640> this<00:05:59.640> is<00:05:59.700> bo<00:06:00.120> copy

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:01.250 
that long but I suppose this is bo copy

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:03.530 
that long but I suppose this is bo copy
so<00:06:02.250> now<00:06:02.430> let's<00:06:02.610> move<00:06:02.790> on<00:06:02.940> to<00:06:02.970> the<00:06:03.270> water

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:03.540 
so now let's move on to the water

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:17.630 
so now let's move on to the water
creatures<00:06:04.110> i<00:06:04.320> have<00:06:04.560> in<00:06:04.740> the<00:06:04.890> back

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:17.640 

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:21.600 

these<00:06:18.640> are<00:06:19.000> the<00:06:19.480> water<00:06:19.720> features<00:06:20.290> i<00:06:20.500> have<00:06:20.800> this

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:21.610 
these are the water features i have this

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:26.850 
these are the water features i have this
there's<00:06:22.270> a<00:06:22.540> hippopotamus<00:06:25.530> those<00:06:26.530> are<00:06:26.770> all

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:26.860 
there's a hippopotamus those are all

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:31.650 
there's a hippopotamus those are all
wrinkles<00:06:27.370> and<00:06:27.670> clicks<00:06:28.230> unexpected<00:06:30.450> this<00:06:31.450> is

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:31.660 
wrinkles and clicks unexpected this is

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:34.890 
wrinkles and clicks unexpected this is
the<00:06:31.900> Sark<00:06:32.200> the<00:06:32.440> great<00:06:32.650> white<00:06:32.860> shark<00:06:33.220> I<00:06:33.900> suppose

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:34.900

have an estimate why would I supposedly
call<00:06:45.640> hippo<00:06:46.060> but<00:06:47.100> those<00:06:48.100> are<00:06:48.460> my<00:06:48.670> water
