00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.719 
attached it was kind of odd I had to go
through<00:02:00.360> a<00:02:00.479> long<00:02:00.960> process<00:02:01.290> to<00:02:01.920> get<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:02.490> video

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
through a long process to get the video

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.810 
through a long process to get the video
working<00:02:03.240> at<00:02:03.810> least<00:02:04.079> off<00:02:04.290> of<00:02:04.649> the<00:02:04.770> iPhone<00:02:05.130> it

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
working at least off of the iPhone it

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.330 
working at least off of the iPhone it
plays<00:02:06.030> fine<00:02:06.540> on<00:02:06.960> the<00:02:07.530> iPhone<00:02:07.829> but<00:02:07.979> getting<00:02:08.190> it

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
plays fine on the iPhone but getting it

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.140 
plays fine on the iPhone but getting it
off<00:02:08.489> seemed<00:02:09.390> to<00:02:09.479> be<00:02:09.599> a<00:02:09.869> bit<00:02:10.550> tricky<00:02:11.550> at<00:02:11.730> least

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
off seemed to be a bit tricky at least

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.990 
off seemed to be a bit tricky at least
the<00:02:12.840> video<00:02:13.050> worked<00:02:13.260> but<00:02:13.440> the<00:02:13.560> audio<00:02:13.910> seemed<00:02:14.910> to

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
the video worked but the audio seemed to

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.520 
the video worked but the audio seemed to
be<00:02:15.090> an<00:02:15.210> issue<00:02:15.330> so<00:02:15.480> hopefully<00:02:16.260> there<00:02:16.410> will<00:02:16.470> be

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
be an issue so hopefully there will be

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:17.780 
be an issue so hopefully there will be
an<00:02:16.680> update<00:02:16.800> at<00:02:17.100> some<00:02:17.340> point<00:02:17.580> in<00:02:17.640> the<00:02:17.700> near
