00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:11.170 
more left it's not as tricky is now

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:29.250 
more left it's not as tricky is now
going<00:01:11.350> right<00:01:11.740> you're<00:01:12.430> gonna<00:01:12.520> jump<00:01:28.260> in

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:29.260 
going right you're gonna jump in

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.320 
going right you're gonna jump in
succession<00:01:29.770> so<00:01:30.070> that<00:01:30.700> shouldn't<00:01:31.030> present<00:01:31.150> a

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:31.330 
succession so that shouldn't present a

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.260 
succession so that shouldn't present a
problem<00:01:31.570> to<00:01:31.840> you<00:01:31.930> guys<00:01:32.310> now<00:01:33.310> go<00:01:33.520> on<00:01:33.610> your<00:01:33.700> way<00:01:34.000> I

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.270 
problem to you guys now go on your way I

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.030 
problem to you guys now go on your way I
recommend<00:01:34.810> that<00:01:35.050> you<00:01:35.110> do<00:01:35.350> not<00:01:35.500> try<00:01:35.800> to<00:01:35.860> get

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:36.040 
recommend that you do not try to get

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:37.770 
recommend that you do not try to get
that<00:01:36.190> power<00:01:36.369> because<00:01:36.760> it's<00:01:37.150> most<00:01:37.360> likely<00:01:37.479> that

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:37.780 
that power because it's most likely that

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.080 
that power because it's most likely that
you<00:01:38.050> will<00:01:38.290> die<00:01:38.619> because<00:01:39.160> getting<00:01:39.760> out<00:01:39.910> of<00:01:40.060> that

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
you will die because getting out of that

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.300 
you will die because getting out of that
little<00:01:40.660> crevice<00:01:41.080> there<00:01:41.290> is<00:01:41.650> very<00:01:41.890> difficult

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.310 
little crevice there is very difficult

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.820 
little crevice there is very difficult
now<00:01:42.550> going<00:01:43.540> this<00:01:43.690> way<00:01:43.869> I<00:01:43.900> recommend<00:01:44.290> going<00:01:44.650> on

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:44.830 
now going this way I recommend going on

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:49.170 
now going this way I recommend going on
the<00:01:44.979> right<00:01:45.130> side<00:01:47.310> so<00:01:48.310> continue<00:01:48.760> on<00:01:48.790> your<00:01:49.030> way

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:49.180 
the right side so continue on your way

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:49.650 
the right side so continue on your way
up

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:49.660 
up

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:52.440 
up
now<00:01:50.350> the<00:01:51.100> left<00:01:51.340> side<00:01:51.580> you<00:01:51.970> would<00:01:52.090> have<00:01:52.150> to<00:01:52.300> deal

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450 
now the left side you would have to deal

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.450 
now the left side you would have to deal
with<00:01:52.570> those<00:01:52.780> guys<00:01:52.810> and<00:01:53.500> if<00:01:53.890> you<00:01:53.920> didn't<00:01:54.310> have

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
with those guys and if you didn't have

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.190 
with those guys and if you didn't have
your<00:01:54.520> rolling<00:01:55.090> cutter<00:01:55.300> and<00:01:55.570> micros<00:01:56.020> that<00:01:56.170> a

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 
your rolling cutter and micros that a

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.370 
your rolling cutter and micros that a
problem<00:01:56.710> so<00:01:57.340> the<00:01:57.430> right<00:01:57.610> side<00:01:57.970> and<00:01:58.300> it's<00:01:58.960> quite

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 
problem so the right side and it's quite

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.180 
problem so the right side and it's quite
I<00:01:59.770> would<00:02:00.460> say<00:02:00.580> a<00:02:00.610> bit<00:02:00.790> easier<00:02:01.119> blowing<00:02:01.720> life

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:02.190 
I would say a bit easier blowing life

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:06.120 
I would say a bit easier blowing life
again<00:02:03.330> these<00:02:04.330> guys<00:02:04.390> are<00:02:04.810> out<00:02:05.380> there<00:02:05.590> game<00:02:05.770> so

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 
again these guys are out there game so

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:12.180 
again these guys are out there game so
you've<00:02:06.700> seen<00:02:07.060> them<00:02:10.530> and<00:02:11.530> you'll<00:02:11.710> see<00:02:11.920> using

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
you've seen them and you'll see using

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.280 
you've seen them and you'll see using
guts<00:02:12.760> immense<00:02:13.060> power<00:02:13.360> up<00:02:13.600> you<00:02:13.900> could<00:02:14.110> go

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
guts immense power up you could go

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:15.630 
guts immense power up you could go
through<00:02:14.530> here<00:02:14.800> just<00:02:14.980> in<00:02:15.310> case<00:02:15.340> you<00:02:15.610> change

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
through here just in case you change

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.410 
through here just in case you change
your<00:02:15.880> mind<00:02:15.970> you<00:02:16.210> want<00:02:16.390> to<00:02:16.450> go<00:02:16.570> black

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
your mind you want to go black

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.270 
your mind you want to go black
to<00:02:18.990> continue<00:02:19.349> on<00:02:19.590> your<00:02:19.620> way<00:02:19.890> and<00:02:20.040> you're<00:02:20.190> gonna

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
to continue on your way and you're gonna

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.050 
to continue on your way and you're gonna
notice<00:02:20.520> a<00:02:20.700> power<00:02:21.000> up<00:02:21.330> there<00:02:21.660> that<00:02:21.930> crevice<00:02:22.260> so

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
notice a power up there that crevice so

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.170 
notice a power up there that crevice so
use<00:02:24.060> the<00:02:24.480> gut<00:02:24.930> arm<00:02:25.620> power<00:02:26.130> Armstrong<00:02:26.940> arm

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
use the gut arm power Armstrong arm

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.630 
use the gut arm power Armstrong arm
we're<00:02:27.330> going<00:02:27.599> on<00:02:27.780> and<00:02:28.410> get<00:02:28.950> this<00:02:29.099> power<00:02:29.400> up

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
we're going on and get this power up

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.809 
we're going on and get this power up
with<00:02:29.910> the<00:02:30.000> power<00:02:30.270> up<00:02:30.450> does<00:02:30.750> is<00:02:31.170> create<00:02:31.819> these

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
with the power up does is create these

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:36.100 
with the power up does is create these
platforms<00:02:33.569> you<00:02:33.660> to<00:02:33.870> jump<00:02:34.080> on<00:02:34.260> in<00:02:34.620> high<00:02:35.310> areas

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
platforms you to jump on in high areas

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.360 
platforms you to jump on in high areas
now<00:02:37.110> I<00:02:37.140> went<00:02:37.410> left<00:02:37.590> here<00:02:38.390> if<00:02:39.390> you<00:02:39.600> would<00:02:39.750> right

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
now I went left here if you would right

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.460 
now I went left here if you would right
probably<00:02:41.370> easier<00:02:41.790> than<00:02:41.819> going<00:02:42.060> left

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
probably easier than going left

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.320 
probably easier than going left
but<00:02:44.010> again<00:02:44.250> if<00:02:44.430> you<00:02:44.520> have<00:02:44.640> the<00:02:44.760> ball<00:02:45.000> in<00:02:45.030> putter

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
but again if you have the ball in putter

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.490 
but again if you have the ball in putter
it<00:02:45.570> doesn't<00:02:45.900> go<00:02:45.990> bad

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
it doesn't go bad

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.830 
it doesn't go bad
now<00:02:48.190> if<00:02:48.310> you<00:02:48.430> did<00:02:48.730> go<00:02:48.970> right<00:02:49.270> the<00:02:49.450> thing<00:02:49.690> is

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
now if you did go right the thing is

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.750 
now if you did go right the thing is
you're<00:02:50.020> gonna<00:02:50.080> need<00:02:50.200> that<00:02:50.500> power<00:02:50.770> up<00:02:51.070> click<00:02:51.550> it

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
you're gonna need that power up click it

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.700 
you're gonna need that power up click it
on<00:02:52.440> the<00:02:53.440> upper<00:02:53.650> platform<00:02:54.630> because<00:02:55.630> you<00:02:56.410> use

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:56.710 
on the upper platform because you use

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:58.860 
on the upper platform because you use
guts<00:02:57.250> man's<00:02:57.520> arm<00:02:57.790> there<00:02:58.120> throw<00:02:58.510> that<00:02:58.690> rock

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
guts man's arm there throw that rock

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.670 
guts man's arm there throw that rock
away<00:02:59.200> you're<00:02:59.500> gonna<00:02:59.620> need<00:02:59.800> to<00:03:01.020> the<00:03:02.020> platform's

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
away you're gonna need to the platform's

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.010 
away you're gonna need to the platform's
to<00:03:02.890> get<00:03:03.100> to<00:03:03.550> the<00:03:03.640> higher<00:03:03.850> level<00:03:04.270> now<00:03:04.780> as<00:03:04.840> you

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:05.020 
to get to the higher level now as you

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:07.980 
to get to the higher level now as you
saw<00:03:05.200> there<00:03:05.470> I<00:03:05.500> had<00:03:05.800> knock<00:03:06.160> the<00:03:07.090> trap<00:03:07.450> out<00:03:07.660> of<00:03:07.840> me

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:07.990 
saw there I had knock the trap out of me

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:10.740 
saw there I had knock the trap out of me
because<00:03:08.470> these<00:03:08.890> spring<00:03:09.820> enemies<00:03:10.300> just

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
because these spring enemies just

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.620 
because these spring enemies just
knocking<00:03:11.290> right<00:03:11.470> off<00:03:11.620> the<00:03:11.770> ladder<00:03:11.950> so<00:03:12.630> make

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630 
knocking right off the ladder so make

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:15.360 
knocking right off the ladder so make
sure<00:03:13.660> you<00:03:13.930> don't<00:03:14.140> get<00:03:14.230> hit<00:03:14.440> by<00:03:14.470> them<00:03:14.830> as<00:03:15.010> you

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
sure you don't get hit by them as you

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.690 
sure you don't get hit by them as you
can<00:03:15.490> see<00:03:16.200> they<00:03:17.200> can<00:03:17.530> be<00:03:17.770> a<00:03:17.800> nuisance<00:03:18.040> if<00:03:18.550> we

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
can see they can be a nuisance if we

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.480 
can see they can be a nuisance if we
don't<00:03:18.880> we'll<00:03:18.970> get<00:03:19.120> off<00:03:19.210> the<00:03:19.390> ladder<00:03:19.600> in<00:03:19.870> time

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:20.490 
don't we'll get off the ladder in time

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:22.980 
don't we'll get off the ladder in time
then<00:03:21.490> again<00:03:21.760> you<00:03:21.910> have<00:03:21.940> to<00:03:22.180> wait<00:03:22.360> for<00:03:22.750> these

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:22.990 
then again you have to wait for these

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:29.670
