brake callipers okay and also this one

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.440 
brake callipers okay and also this one
here<00:01:40.890> it<00:01:40.950> controls<00:01:41.340> your<00:01:41.520> ride<00:01:41.729> control<00:01:42.150> which

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
here it controls your ride control which

here it controls your ride control which
is<00:01:42.479> disconnected<00:01:43.409> okay<00:01:43.979> okay<00:01:44.780> so<00:01:45.780> if<00:01:46.290> you<00:01:46.950> in

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
is disconnected okay okay so if you in

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.240 
is disconnected okay okay so if you in
these<00:01:47.909> white<00:01:48.390> ones<00:01:48.810> here<00:01:49.170> are<00:01:49.320> returns<00:01:49.890> back

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
these white ones here are returns back

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.010 
these white ones here are returns back
up<00:01:50.490> to<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:50.759> master<00:01:51.000> cylinder<00:01:51.390> because<00:01:51.899> you

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
up to the master cylinder because you

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.690 
up to the master cylinder because you
can't<00:01:52.259> keep<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:52.649> full<00:01:52.829> brake<00:01:53.070> pressure<00:01:53.369> down

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
can't keep the full brake pressure down

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.880 
can't keep the full brake pressure down
here<00:01:53.729> it<00:01:54.360> has<00:01:54.540> to<00:01:54.750> return<00:01:54.899> back<00:01:55.380> up<00:01:55.619> when<00:01:55.799> you

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
here it has to return back up when you

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.280 
here it has to return back up when you
let<00:01:56.040> go<00:01:56.070> onto<00:01:56.369> pedal<00:01:56.700> on<00:01:56.820> that

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.290 
let go onto pedal on that

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:01.180 
let go onto pedal on that
that<00:01:57.470> operates<00:01:58.010> okay<00:01:58.610> so<00:01:59.600> you<00:02:00.050> got<00:02:00.230> us<00:02:00.410> the

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:01.190 
that operates okay so you got us the

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:02.710 
that operates okay so you got us the
book<00:02:01.370> will<00:02:01.550> tell<00:02:01.700> you<00:02:01.850> more<00:02:02.030> on<00:02:02.240> that<00:02:02.270> if<00:02:02.570> you

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720 
book will tell you more on that if you

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.270 
book will tell you more on that if you
look<00:02:02.900> in<00:02:03.080> it<00:02:03.110> but<00:02:03.380> I<00:02:03.500> think<00:02:03.680> like<00:02:03.890> I<00:02:04.040> say

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
look in it but I think like I say

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.139 
look in it but I think like I say

the new rubber brake lines and steel
lines<00:02:26.420> going<00:02:26.720> to<00:02:27.020> the<00:02:27.140> front<00:02:27.380> calipers<00:02:27.920> yep

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:29.570 
lines going to the front calipers yep

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:31.810

the<00:02:29.990> only<00:02:30.170> steel<00:02:30.620> lines<00:02:30.890> that<00:02:31.160> have<00:02:31.340> not<00:02:31.580> been

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820 
the only steel lines that have not been

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:33.190 
the only steel lines that have not been
replaced<00:02:32.150> are<00:02:32.540> the<00:02:32.660> ones<00:02:32.840> that<00:02:33.050> run

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
replaced are the ones that run

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.290 
replaced are the ones that run
underneath<00:02:33.590> the<00:02:33.860> motor<00:02:34.070> because<00:02:34.430> of<00:02:34.850> the<00:02:35.000> oil

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300 
underneath the motor because of the oil

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:36.880 
underneath the motor because of the oil
that<00:02:35.420> were<00:02:35.720> on<00:02:35.959> them<00:02:36.140> were<00:02:36.290> the<00:02:36.470> only<00:02:36.620> reason

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
that were on them were the only reason

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.600 
that were on them were the only reason
why<00:02:37.190> they<00:02:37.400> were<00:02:37.459> salvageable<00:02:38.120> wow<00:02:39.310> that's

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
why they were salvageable wow that's

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.940 
why they were salvageable wow that's
I<00:02:40.959> should<00:02:41.959> have<00:02:42.080> coated<00:02:42.260> them<00:02:42.470> all<00:02:42.620> I<00:02:42.650> guess

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
I should have coated them all I guess

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.850 
I should have coated them all I guess
yeah<00:02:43.280> so<00:02:44.180> you're<00:02:44.390> accumulators<00:02:45.140> check<00:02:45.650> out

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
yeah so you're accumulators check out

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.810 
yeah so you're accumulators check out
flying<00:02:46.280> at<00:02:46.850> this<00:02:47.180> point<00:02:47.510> I<00:02:47.720> ran<00:02:48.080> all<00:02:48.290> new<00:02:48.470> lines

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:48.820 
flying at this point I ran all new lines

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:53.260 
flying at this point I ran all new lines

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:57.550 
switches on the accumulators the front
ones<00:02:55.640> been<00:02:56.120> changed<00:02:56.690> or<00:02:56.840> the<00:02:56.959> rear<00:02:57.140> ones<00:02:57.350> been

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.830 
ones been changed or the rear ones been
changed<00:02:58.010> but<00:02:58.160> one's<00:02:58.400> a<00:02:58.580> Spade<00:02:58.850> connector<00:02:59.510> and

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
changed but one's a Spade connector and

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.350 
changed but one's a Spade connector and
the<00:03:00.020> other<00:03:00.170> ones<00:03:00.410> a<00:03:00.530> bullet<00:03:00.920> connector<00:03:01.550> in

the other ones a bullet connector in

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.110 
the other ones a bullet connector in
this<00:03:02.600> rear<00:03:02.900> one<00:03:03.550> even<00:03:04.550> though<00:03:04.640> it<00:03:04.760> builds<00:03:05.030> up

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
this rear one even though it builds up

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.940 
this rear one even though it builds up
with<00:03:05.330> good<00:03:05.510> pressure<00:03:05.870> and<00:03:06.350> your<00:03:06.470> brake<00:03:06.709> light

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
with good pressure and your brake light

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:08.680 
with good pressure and your brake light
don't<00:03:07.190> turn<00:03:07.459> off<00:03:07.489> and<00:03:08.030> I'm<00:03:08.239> having<00:03:08.450> a

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 
don't turn off and I'm having a

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:10.509 
don't turn off and I'm having a
suspicion<00:03:08.989> that<00:03:09.320> it's<00:03:09.709> the<00:03:10.040> brake<00:03:10.280> light

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:10.519 
suspicion that it's the brake light

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:12.640 
suspicion that it's the brake light
switch<00:03:10.550> because<00:03:11.540> it<00:03:11.720> does<00:03:11.959> have<00:03:12.200> full

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
switch because it does have full

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.370 
switch because it does have full
pressure<00:03:13.340> full<00:03:13.820> pressure<00:03:14.120> going<00:03:14.450> to<00:03:14.810> it<00:03:14.989> so

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
pressure full pressure going to it so

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:17.620 
pressure full pressure going to it so
and<00:03:15.709> that's<00:03:16.310> what<00:03:16.519> turns<00:03:16.760> the<00:03:17.209> brake<00:03:17.390> light

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
and that's what turns the brake light

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:23.110 
and that's what turns the brake light
off<00:03:17.840> okay<00:03:18.680> good<00:03:19.120> okay<00:03:20.290> where's<00:03:21.290> the<00:03:22.120> calipers

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
off okay good okay where's the calipers

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.650 
off okay good okay where's the calipers
and<00:03:23.260> plumbing<00:03:24.260> it<00:03:24.380> for<00:03:24.560> the<00:03:25.299> passenger<00:03:26.299> front

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660 
and plumbing it for the passenger front

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.530 
and plumbing it for the passenger front
and<00:03:26.959> like<00:03:27.230> I<00:03:27.350> say<00:03:27.590> all<00:03:27.620> new<00:03:28.100> lines<00:03:28.370> from<00:03:29.269> steel

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
and like I say all new lines from steel

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:32.050 
and like I say all new lines from steel
lines<00:03:29.840> to<00:03:30.110> rubber<00:03:30.320> lines<00:03:30.790> all<00:03:31.790> the<00:03:31.940> way
