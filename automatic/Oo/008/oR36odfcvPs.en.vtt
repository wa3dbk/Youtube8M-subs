Yahtzee style game now I do find
interesting<00:00:34.550> this<00:00:34.640> is<00:00:34.700> the<00:00:34.820> size<00:00:35.149> of<00:00:35.329> the<00:00:35.450> box

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:35.660 
interesting this is the size of the box

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.869 
interesting this is the size of the box
right<00:00:36.430> this<00:00:37.430> is<00:00:38.120> what<00:00:38.360> comes<00:00:38.540> inside<00:00:38.930> the<00:00:39.079> bugs

00:00:39.869 --> 00:00:39.879

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:44.560 
right this is what comes inside the bugs
this<00:00:40.879> may<00:00:41.120> be<00:00:41.180> the<00:00:41.480> biggest<00:00:43.270> unnecessary<00:00:44.270> size

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:44.570 
this may be the biggest unnecessary size

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.990 
this may be the biggest unnecessary size
the<00:00:44.840> box<00:00:45.020> every<00:00:45.469> minute<00:00:45.739> but<00:00:46.460> what<00:00:46.640> have<00:00:46.820> you

00:00:48.639 --> 00:00:48.649

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
and then I can roll again or I could

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.190 
and then I can roll again or I could
stop<00:01:46.579> rolling<00:01:46.939> but<00:01:47.090> at<00:01:47.600> this<00:01:47.750> point<00:01:48.020> there's

run<00:04:06.590> I<00:04:06.770> don't<00:04:07.220> think<00:04:07.430> it's<00:04:07.520> a<00:04:07.670> great<00:04:08.060> game<00:04:08.300> but

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:08.600 
run I don't think it's a great game but

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.060 
run I don't think it's a great game but
it's<00:04:08.930> one<00:04:09.080> I<00:04:09.110> think<00:04:09.230> that<00:04:09.500> a<00:04:09.530> lot<00:04:09.740> of<00:04:09.770> people

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:10.070 
it's one I think that a lot of people
