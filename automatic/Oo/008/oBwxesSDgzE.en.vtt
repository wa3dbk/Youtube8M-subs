00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
expected because first of all Apple it

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.639 
expected because first of all Apple it
wouldn't<00:01:48.540> be<00:01:48.630> weird<00:01:48.840> if<00:01:48.990> even<00:01:49.259> before<00:01:49.380> us

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
wouldn't be weird if even before us

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:50.960 
wouldn't be weird if even before us
wouldn't<00:01:49.950> talk<00:01:50.070> of<00:01:50.220> this<00:01:50.399> update<00:01:50.700> because

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
wouldn't talk of this update because

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.690 
wouldn't talk of this update because
it's<00:01:51.570> a<00:01:51.659> 2011<00:01:52.200> phone<00:01:52.710> it's<00:01:52.950> four<00:01:53.159> years<00:01:53.369> old

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
think it is and it really really looks

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.590
