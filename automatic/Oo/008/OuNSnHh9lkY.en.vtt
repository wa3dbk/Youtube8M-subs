idea<00:00:56.820> what<00:00:56.940> store<00:00:57.149> it<00:00:57.239> was<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.780> two<00:00:57.930> things

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
idea what store it was the two things

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.150 
idea what store it was the two things
that<00:00:58.230> people<00:00:58.500> have<00:00:58.590> been<00:00:58.680> watching<00:00:58.980> very

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
that people have been watching very

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.680 
that people have been watching very
closely<00:00:59.340> for<00:00:59.699> a<00:00:59.730> number<00:00:59.760> one<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.149> iPad<00:01:00.510> and

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
closely for a number one the iPad and

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:01.910 
closely for a number one the iPad and
we'll<00:01:00.780> talk<00:01:00.899> about<00:01:01.020> that<00:01:01.140> in<00:01:01.289> a<00:01:01.440> moment<00:01:01.559> but

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
we'll talk about that in a moment but

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.750 
we'll talk about that in a moment but
also<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:03.000> paywall<00:01:03.899> will<00:01:04.170> come<00:01:04.409> clanging<00:01:05.339> down

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
also the paywall will come clanging down

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.210 
also the paywall will come clanging down
if<00:01:06.210> in<00:01:06.360> fact<00:01:06.510> a<00:01:06.689> walk<00:01:06.840> and<00:01:07.049> come<00:01:07.200> down<00:01:07.470> I<00:01:07.830> think

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
if in fact a walk and come down I think

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.679 
if in fact a walk and come down I think
people<00:01:08.369> are<00:01:08.580> starting<00:01:08.760> to<00:01:08.939> realize<00:01:09.510> and

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
people are starting to realize and

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.450 
people are starting to realize and
understand<00:01:10.110> and<00:01:10.350> agree<00:01:10.560> with<00:01:10.710> us<00:01:10.920> that<00:01:10.950> that

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
understand and agree with us that that

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.880 
understand and agree with us that that
our<00:01:11.700> gal<00:01:12.060> content<00:01:12.510> is<00:01:12.659> valuable<00:01:13.320> and<00:01:13.500> yet<00:01:13.799> we

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
our gal content is valuable and yet we

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.249 
our gal content is valuable and yet we
see<00:01:14.070> many<00:01:14.220> surveys<00:01:14.820> that<00:01:15.119> will<00:01:15.270> say<00:01:15.450> if<00:01:16.020> the

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
see many surveys that will say if the

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.109 
see many surveys that will say if the
public<00:01:16.409> are<00:01:16.740> asked<00:01:17.100> are<00:01:17.310> you<00:01:17.640> willing<00:01:17.820> suppose

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
public are asked are you willing suppose

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.179 
public are asked are you willing suppose
something<00:01:18.360> that<00:01:18.600> was<00:01:18.720> previously<00:01:18.990> free<00:01:19.710> if

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
something that was previously free if

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.520 
something that was previously free if
we're<00:01:20.939> lucky<00:01:20.970> maybe<00:01:21.540> five<00:01:21.900> percent<00:01:22.290> of<00:01:22.409> people

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
we're lucky maybe five percent of people

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.880 
we're lucky maybe five percent of people
say<00:01:22.890> yes<00:01:23.130> if<00:01:23.700> we<00:01:23.820> manage<00:01:24.180> to<00:01:24.330> rate<00:01:25.020> retain<00:01:25.439> five

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
say yes if we manage to rate retain five

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.670 
say yes if we manage to rate retain five
to<00:01:26.130> ten<00:01:26.280> percent<00:01:26.580> of<00:01:26.670> our<00:01:26.759> existing<00:01:27.210> audience

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:27.680 
to ten percent of our existing audience

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.440 
to ten percent of our existing audience
I'd<00:01:28.680> think<00:01:29.040> to<00:01:29.610> begin<00:01:29.909> with<00:01:30.060> that<00:01:30.210> it'd<00:01:30.329> be<00:01:30.360> a

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
I'd think to begin with that it'd be a

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.240 
I'd think to begin with that it'd be a
success<00:01:30.810> we<00:01:31.320> know<00:01:31.530> that<00:01:31.710> we<00:01:31.799> need<00:01:31.829> to<00:01:32.100> do<00:01:32.220> a

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
success we know that we need to do a

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.490 
success we know that we need to do a
better<00:01:32.670> job<00:01:32.850> and<00:01:33.270> I<00:01:33.630> think<00:01:33.900> that<00:01:34.049> saying<00:01:34.350> we'll

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
better job and I think that saying we'll

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.230 
better job and I think that saying we'll
look<00:01:34.530> paying<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.490> same<00:01:35.670> amount<00:01:35.729> of<00:01:35.909> money<00:01:35.970> for

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
look paying the same amount of money for

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.730 
look paying the same amount of money for
something<00:01:36.450> that<00:01:36.659> you've<00:01:36.750> had<00:01:36.900> for<00:01:36.960> free<00:01:37.290> is

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
something that you've had for free is

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.469 
something that you've had for free is
probably<00:01:38.159> not<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:38.340> right<00:01:38.460> equation<00:01:38.880> I<00:01:39.210> think

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
probably not the right equation I think

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.030 
probably not the right equation I think
that<00:01:39.600> will<00:01:39.720> do<00:01:39.869> it<00:01:39.990> better<00:01:40.200> you<00:01:40.650> know<00:01:40.770> we'll<00:01:40.890> go

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
that will do it better you know we'll go

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.380 
that will do it better you know we'll go
out<00:01:41.189> there<00:01:41.369> and<00:01:41.490> we'll<00:01:41.640> try<00:01:41.820> and<00:01:41.850> come<00:01:42.210> up<00:01:42.240> with

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
out there and we'll try and come up with

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.149 
out there and we'll try and come up with
a<00:01:42.450> product<00:01:42.689> i'm<00:01:42.990> sure<00:01:43.170> we're<00:01:43.350> doers<00:01:43.500> that

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
a product i'm sure we're doers that

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.550 
a product i'm sure we're doers that

the app itself is is our first pass so

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.499

the consumer experience not at all i

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.740 
the consumer experience not at all i
think<00:02:18.280> that<00:02:18.580> you<00:02:18.700> can<00:02:18.850> do<00:02:18.970> both<00:02:19.180> I<00:02:19.450> think<00:02:19.660> you

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
think that you can do both I think you

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.570 
think that you can do both I think you
can<00:02:19.900> satisfy<00:02:20.080> the<00:02:20.350> advertisers<00:02:21.010> by<00:02:21.160> having

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
critical mass for your audience and I

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:24.990

deadline<00:04:00.700> so<00:04:00.820> I<00:04:00.880> think<00:04:00.940> you're<00:04:01.180> right<00:04:01.300> Nick

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:06.980 
deadline so I think you're right Nick
thanks<00:04:02.110> for<00:04:02.200> your<00:04:02.290> time<00:04:02.410> I<00:04:02.710> should<00:04:03.100> be

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:06.990 

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:09.270 

if<00:04:07.990> I<00:04:08.110> had<00:04:08.260> to<00:04:08.350> encapsulate<00:04:08.590> it<00:04:08.890> in<00:04:09.100> one<00:04:09.250> word

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 
if I had to encapsulate it in one word

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.430 
if I had to encapsulate it in one word
it<00:04:09.640> would<00:04:09.670> be<00:04:09.850> authenticity<00:04:10.300> I<00:04:10.690> think<00:04:11.260> that

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:11.440 
it would be authenticity I think that

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.260 
it would be authenticity I think that
the<00:04:11.650> way<00:04:11.770> that<00:04:11.980> comes<00:04:12.160> in<00:04:12.310> moving<00:04:12.520> with<00:04:12.820> all

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:13.270 
the way that comes in moving with all

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:15.330 
the way that comes in moving with all
the<00:04:13.420> balls<00:04:13.600> in<00:04:13.780> the<00:04:13.900> air<00:04:14.020> and<00:04:14.340> operators

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340 
the balls in the air and operators

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:16.740 
the balls in the air and operators
coming<00:04:15.640> through<00:04:15.940> sort<00:04:16.300> of<00:04:16.360> out<00:04:16.570> of<00:04:16.630> nowhere

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:16.750 
coming through sort of out of nowhere

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:19.940 
coming through sort of out of nowhere
and<00:04:17.440> in<00:04:18.040> getting<00:04:18.370> the<00:04:18.430> footing<00:04:18.850> in<00:04:19.090> in<00:04:19.330> media

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:19.950 
and in getting the footing in in media

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:22.620 
and in getting the footing in in media
that<00:04:20.950> will<00:04:21.190> continue<00:04:21.610> to<00:04:21.700> grow<00:04:21.850> but<00:04:22.330> I<00:04:22.480> think

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:22.630 
that will continue to grow but I think

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:25.590 
that will continue to grow but I think
what<00:04:23.080> will<00:04:23.320> happen<00:04:23.860> is<00:04:24.070> that<00:04:24.550> only<00:04:24.790> those<00:04:25.120> who

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:25.600 
what will happen is that only those who

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.720 
what will happen is that only those who
have<00:04:25.630> substance<00:04:26.470> and<00:04:26.710> authenticity<00:04:26.980> to<00:04:27.580> their

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:27.730 
have substance and authenticity to their

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:30.240 
have substance and authenticity to their
voice<00:04:27.940> will<00:04:28.240> survive<00:04:28.600> and<00:04:28.990> I<00:04:29.800> think<00:04:29.950> that<00:04:30.070> will

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.250 
voice will survive and I think that will

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:32.640 
voice will survive and I think that will
become<00:04:30.370> a<00:04:30.520> big<00:04:30.790> barometer<00:04:31.420> going<00:04:31.990> forward<00:04:32.350> and

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.650 
become a big barometer going forward and

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:35.880 
become a big barometer going forward and
that's<00:04:33.430> a<00:04:33.520> good<00:04:33.640> thing<00:04:34.470> next<00:04:35.470> time<00:04:35.620> on<00:04:35.650> the
