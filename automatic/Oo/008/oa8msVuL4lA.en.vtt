00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:10.549
 Hello dear visitors of ours 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:13.309
 garden site whether we are with you again 

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:15.980
 talking about insect pests and 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:19.340
 Now we will not quite normal 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:21.079
 the story of the pest conifers here 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:24.800
 look please operator us 

00:00:21.079 --> 00:00:28.669
 now show how much our poor volume 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:32.960
 Christmas tree last year we ate pine trees 

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:34.730
 we defended them but this tree in 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.360
 last year absolutely no 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.300
 touched 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.690
 but apparently they have spread to this 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:44.360
 a Christmas tree that was not processed and 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:46.310
 some cells are completely left 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:49.190
 without needles and it happened 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:52.610
 literally all three days while in the snow 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:55.400
 garden we admired her good 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:58.190
 beautiful fluffy growths and after three 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:02.450
 of the day came and found this 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:04.869
 disgrace, I will show you how 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:08.360
 I used the means that is, we already 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:09.170
 destroyed these pests I had 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.900
 at hand 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:14.950
 that's just such a drug commander maxi 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:17.900
 it is as if calculated 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:21.110
 vegetable pests 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:24.920
 This is protection from the Colorado potato beetle 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.870
 on the potato and from the whitefly on 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.479
 cucumbers 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:31.159
 tomatoes here on greenhouse crops but 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:33.620
 I only had this one at hand 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:35.450
 drug and as it turned out he was fine 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:39.049
 coped with these maggots 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:41.110
 because here is what is calculated 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:42.530
 on the colorado potato beetle larvae 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:45.110
 Colorado potato beetle 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:47.000
 this commander maxi kills too and here 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.400
 as it turned out on the Christmas tree, he, too, us 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.350
 very well helped as i sprayed 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:55.180
 spread according to the instructions 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:57.280
 here is a bucket of water and such 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:01.630
 sprayer it in this case 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:04.460
 mist sprayer it works 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:08.390
 pumping air just like this 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:09.899
 see by hand is very convenient easy to 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.849
 circulation and 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:14.760
 long barbell allows enough 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:17.370
 climb high in the crown I will show you now 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:21.829
 and it is surprising that on such a pedestal 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:25.560
 I still need to get this one 

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:33.510
 process see how far it takes 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:35.879
 It is sent and flew well, that's more convenient 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:38.819
 even on the bottle to put on this hose 

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:42.269
 and then he won't fly out at all 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:46.859
 here's 1 pumping look like for a long time 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:49.409
 Lacks on sprays hand practically not 

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:52.470
 it remains and it is wonderful like this 

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:56.000
 just once they have processed our tree to 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.000
 and no one waited
