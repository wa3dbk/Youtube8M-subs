00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
I made it's a copy but I made this

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.590 
I made it's a copy but I made this
myself<00:01:49.290> which<00:01:49.770> is<00:01:49.799> still<00:01:50.399> kind<00:01:50.640> of<00:01:50.700> cool<00:01:50.909> but

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
myself which is still kind of cool but

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:52.670 
myself which is still kind of cool but
it's<00:01:51.840> different<00:01:52.020> if<00:01:52.170> you're<00:01:52.320> selling<00:01:52.560> its

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
it's different if you're selling its

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.940 
it's different if you're selling its
people<00:01:54.110> either<00:01:55.110> way<00:01:55.290> I<00:01:55.320> would<00:01:55.530> never<00:01:55.649> buy<00:01:55.920> it

people either way I would never buy it
and<00:01:56.280> my<00:01:56.549> second<00:01:56.909> reason<00:01:57.060> is<00:01:57.360> because<00:01:58.070> the

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
and my second reason is because the

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.240 
and my second reason is because the
quality<00:01:59.310> just<00:01:59.700> isn't<00:01:59.969> there<00:02:00.149> I<00:02:00.390> think<00:02:00.899> I<00:02:01.469> want

not<00:02:10.939> because<00:02:11.629> they<00:02:11.810> make<00:02:11.989> beautiful<00:02:12.230> dolls

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
not because they make beautiful dolls

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.129 
not because they make beautiful dolls
honestly<00:02:13.420> one<00:02:14.420> of<00:02:14.450> the<00:02:14.540> reasons<00:02:14.840> I<00:02:14.930> have<00:02:15.109> a

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:15.139 
honestly one of the reasons I have a

00:02:15.139 --> 00:02:16.720 
honestly one of the reasons I have a
volks<00:02:15.590> tall<00:02:15.769> and<00:02:16.010> a<00:02:16.099> mini<00:02:16.280> fee<00:02:16.519> for<00:02:16.700> that

volks tall and a mini fee for that

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.489 
volks tall and a mini fee for that
reason<00:02:16.999> is<00:02:17.239> because<00:02:17.389> fairyland<00:02:18.019> invokes<00:02:18.319> are

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:18.499 
reason is because fairyland invokes are

00:02:18.499 --> 00:02:19.780 
reason is because fairyland invokes are
known<00:02:18.620> for<00:02:18.799> their<00:02:18.829> beautiful<00:02:19.219> artwork<00:02:19.579> and

in they're entitled to their own opinion
and<00:03:26.629> whatnot<00:03:27.139> I<00:03:27.949> think<00:03:28.459> similarly<00:03:29.139> it<00:03:30.139> kind<00:03:30.409> of

00:03:30.429 --> 00:03:30.439 
and whatnot I think similarly it kind of

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:32.289 
and whatnot I think similarly it kind of
goes<00:03:30.560> along<00:03:30.769> with<00:03:30.919> what<00:03:30.979> i<00:03:31.099> buy<00:03:31.340> like<00:03:31.579> a<00:03:31.790> fake

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:32.299 
goes along with what i buy like a fake

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
before yes would I again probably not

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.449 
before yes would I again probably not
just<00:03:37.519> because<00:03:38.409> the<00:03:39.409> craftsmanship<00:03:40.099> doesn't

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:40.459

I've<00:05:47.790> read<00:05:48.660> both<00:05:48.900> sides<00:05:49.200> and<00:05:49.560> i<00:05:49.650> feel<00:05:49.920> like<00:05:50.100> i

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:50.280 
I've read both sides and i feel like i

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:51.440 
I've read both sides and i feel like i
don't<00:05:50.460> know<00:05:50.520> maybe<00:05:50.730> it<00:05:51.060> wasn't<00:05:51.240> malicious

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:51.450 
don't know maybe it wasn't malicious

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:54.140 
don't know maybe it wasn't malicious
maybe<00:05:51.960> it<00:05:52.200> wasn't<00:05:52.380> a<00:05:52.710> total<00:05:53.040> knockoff<00:05:53.820> and<00:05:54.030> rip

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:54.150 
maybe it wasn't a total knockoff and rip

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:58.880 
maybe it wasn't a total knockoff and rip
off<00:05:55.040> so<00:05:56.040> i<00:05:56.430> would<00:05:57.330> i<00:05:57.360> buy<00:05:57.600> like<00:05:57.810> a<00:05:57.840> copy<00:05:58.170> I<00:05:58.470> might

00:05:58.880 --> 00:05:58.890 
off so i would i buy like a copy I might

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:00.470 
off so i would i buy like a copy I might
if<00:05:59.130> I<00:05:59.430> really<00:05:59.790> liked<00:05:59.970> and<00:06:00.150> I<00:06:00.210> thought<00:06:00.360> the

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:00.480 
if I really liked and I thought the

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:02.510 
if I really liked and I thought the
quality<00:06:00.930> was<00:06:01.080> there<00:06:01.290> I<00:06:01.500> think<00:06:02.220> it's<00:06:02.340> a<00:06:02.400> little

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:02.520 
quality was there I think it's a little

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:03.950 
quality was there I think it's a little
different<00:06:02.790> and<00:06:03.060> maybe<00:06:03.270> that's<00:06:03.480> contradictory

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:03.960 
different and maybe that's contradictory

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:07.430 
different and maybe that's contradictory
but<00:06:04.110> that's<00:06:04.260> just<00:06:04.500> how<00:06:04.680> I<00:06:04.710> feel<00:06:05.210> and<00:06:06.260> it<00:06:07.260> really

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:07.440 
but that's just how I feel and it really

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:09.320 
but that's just how I feel and it really
depends<00:06:07.890> I<00:06:07.980> guess<00:06:08.010> on<00:06:08.340> how<00:06:08.490> they<00:06:08.640> play<00:06:08.850> off<00:06:09.060> the

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:09.330 
depends I guess on how they play off the

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:12.440 
depends I guess on how they play off the
copy<00:06:09.630> it<00:06:09.990> is<00:06:10.290> it<00:06:10.470> like<00:06:10.820> you<00:06:11.820> know<00:06:11.940> this<00:06:12.270> is<00:06:12.420> a

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:12.450 
copy it is it like you know this is a

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:14.150 
copy it is it like you know this is a
reimage<00:06:12.810> idea<00:06:13.320> from<00:06:13.500> this<00:06:13.710> company<00:06:13.950> that's

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:14.160 
reimage idea from this company that's

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:18.350 
reimage idea from this company that's
cool<00:06:14.370> I<00:06:14.610> would<00:06:15.380> appreciate<00:06:16.380> that<00:06:16.590> or<00:06:17.160> is<00:06:17.850> it<00:06:17.880> um

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:18.360 
cool I would appreciate that or is it um

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:21.140 
cool I would appreciate that or is it um
you<00:06:18.750> know<00:06:18.980> exact<00:06:19.980> copy<00:06:20.220> it's<00:06:20.460> like<00:06:20.550> wow<00:06:20.760> that

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:21.150 
you know exact copy it's like wow that

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:23.180 
you know exact copy it's like wow that
looks<00:06:21.390> exactly<00:06:21.780> like<00:06:21.960> that<00:06:22.050> other<00:06:22.230> doll<00:06:22.560> then

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:23.190 
looks exactly like that other doll then

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:24.950 
looks exactly like that other doll then
maybe<00:06:23.400> I<00:06:23.520> wouldn't<00:06:23.820> it's<00:06:24.060> just<00:06:24.150> I<00:06:24.480> think<00:06:24.720> it

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:24.960 
maybe I wouldn't it's just I think it

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:26.810 
maybe I wouldn't it's just I think it
depends<00:06:25.260> on<00:06:25.380> the<00:06:25.440> the<00:06:25.890> level<00:06:26.280> of<00:06:26.310> copying

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:26.820 
depends on the the level of copying

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:29.720 
depends on the the level of copying
they're<00:06:26.970> doing<00:06:27.330> and<00:06:28.260> if<00:06:28.650> I<00:06:28.800> really<00:06:29.310> feel<00:06:29.340> that

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:29.730 
they're doing and if I really feel that

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:32.780 
they're doing and if I really feel that
it<00:06:30.600> was<00:06:30.690> malicious<00:06:31.200> or<00:06:31.440> if<00:06:31.590> it<00:06:31.710> was<00:06:31.800> ill<00:06:32.280> intent

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:32.790 
it was malicious or if it was ill intent

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:35.180 
it was malicious or if it was ill intent
or<00:06:33.150> whatever<00:06:33.510> may<00:06:33.930> have<00:06:34.140> you<00:06:34.380> maybe<00:06:35.100> I

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:35.190 
or whatever may have you maybe I

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:37.899 
or whatever may have you maybe I
wouldn't<00:06:35.490> so<00:06:35.970> I<00:06:36.300> I<00:06:36.750> do<00:06:37.050> think<00:06:37.500> there's<00:06:37.530> a<00:06:37.680> diff

00:06:37.899 --> 00:06:37.909 
wouldn't so I I do think there's a diff

00:06:37.909 --> 00:06:42.080 
wouldn't so I I do think there's a diff
recasts<00:06:38.909> and<00:06:39.120> copies<00:06:40.129> copies<00:06:41.129> because<00:06:41.879> I

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:42.090 
recasts and copies copies because I

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:43.999 
recasts and copies copies because I
think<00:06:42.389> that<00:06:42.599> there<00:06:43.229> they<00:06:43.439> are<00:06:43.469> different

00:06:43.999 --> 00:06:44.009 
think that there they are different

00:06:44.009 --> 00:06:45.559 
think that there they are different
dolls<00:06:44.159> I<00:06:44.310> still<00:06:44.729> think<00:06:44.939> that<00:06:44.999> dust<00:06:45.300> of<00:06:45.449> dull

00:06:45.559 --> 00:06:45.569 
dolls I still think that dust of dull

00:06:45.569 --> 00:06:47.540 
dolls I still think that dust of dull
and<00:06:45.719> leaked<00:06:45.900> world<00:06:46.129> maybe<00:06:47.129> they're<00:06:47.310> similar

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:47.550 
and leaked world maybe they're similar

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:49.580 
and leaked world maybe they're similar
or<00:06:47.969> yes<00:06:48.150> there<00:06:48.389> somewhere<00:06:48.689> I<00:06:48.719> do<00:06:48.840> admit<00:06:49.319> yes
