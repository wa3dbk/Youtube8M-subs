00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:09.250
 well we finished then completing 

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:12.170
 the return and we finished with the six 

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:15.800
 separate chains forgive the six 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:19.960
 double suitcases separated already for 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:23.060
 then complete with our six 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:28.070
 first we had done in the 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:30.680
 diagram now how are we going to join this 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:33.700
 with this other part 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:38.840
 we had then our last vareta 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:41.110
 we make the chain and we are going to join it here 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:44.130
 as follows 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:44.130
 here then 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:52.910
 I put my crochet 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.910
 and the 1 with 1 last point 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:04.280
 then my first point about the 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:07.280
 first vareta here we did it with 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.930
 chains and now then we continue with the 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.230
 scheme 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:15.260
 we have to do here your located at a 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:18.650
 of them a wand 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:21.670
 but separated by a string like 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.670
 show the scheme 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:26.880
 we are doing this part now 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:39.320
 then we will raise then 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:39.320
 newly height wand 1 2 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:45.289
 3. 4 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:47.810
 that's a double wand height but 

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:51.530
 Now we are going to make it separated by a 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:53.460
 chain then we make 1 more 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.380
 5 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:59.909
 now then we do 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.909
 about each of them 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.220
 a wand 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.030
 a cabin 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.410
 3 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:28.040
 once a chain 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.040
 4 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.370
 a chain 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.400
 you 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:48.350
 5 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:54.820
 but our first wand was here 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:54.820
 then we have 1 2 3 4 5 6 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.370
 6 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:02.500
 twists separated by a string about 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:07.819
 our first group 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:10.480
 now let's do the next part 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:10.480
 What is it 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:16.000
 link 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:20.400
 these six wands 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.400
 in a single point like the rest 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:29.780
 about our first wand 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:33.670
 in we get only two points 1 2 and 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:33.670
 we leave these in suspension 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:39.540
 on the other suitcase 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:43.760
 we will get back only two points 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.760
 and they remain in suspension 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.790
 we do the same with the following 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.720
 before 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:00.579
 and the chair 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:07.550
 then we have fortune 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:25.300
 so 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:31.539
 like 123456 our first six 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:33.980
 paddles then 1 2 3 4 5 6 and this is 

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:37.460
 the first point 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:40.990
 and we're going to close them all then with 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:40.990
 a single point 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:44.300
 in this way 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:05:00.600
 sanctioned and we make a chain 

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:04.420
 we follow then when our point 

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:07.330
 a wand on each one is 

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:10.710
 separated by a point 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:10.710
 or a chain 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:15.150
 two 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:28.880
 4 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:28.880
 for a chain 

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:37.840
 5 

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:49.210
 with a chain 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:51.200
 and the same in these other three that the 

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:53.180
 we take out with a single point 

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:57.169
 but 

00:05:53.180 --> 00:06:01.300
 we do not finish weaving it and only 

00:05:57.169 --> 00:06:01.300
 we have 2 and we leave it in suspension 

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:06.039
 two 

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:14.639
 4 

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:19.020
 5 

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:32.340
 and we have them that we are going to take it with 

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:32.340
 a single point 

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:50.170
 we close and we make our long chain
