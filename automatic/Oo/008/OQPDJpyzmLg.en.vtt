this<00:02:03.270> step<00:02:03.509> I<00:02:03.810> will<00:02:04.500> use<00:02:04.679> the<00:02:04.829> printer

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
this step I will use the printer

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:08.119 
this step I will use the printer
registration<00:02:05.789> ID<00:02:06.049> which<00:02:07.049> was<00:02:07.289> printed<00:02:07.799> from
