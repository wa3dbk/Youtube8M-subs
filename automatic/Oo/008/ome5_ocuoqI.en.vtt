discovering T spawn right here and in
order<00:00:21.630> to<00:00:21.810> manage<00:00:22.230> the<00:00:22.470> spawn<00:00:22.800> points<00:00:23.340> I<00:00:23.550> made

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
order to manage the spawn points I made

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.859 
order to manage the spawn points I made
some<00:00:24.480> beds<00:00:24.750> and<00:00:26.060> it's<00:00:27.060> nighttime<00:00:27.269> so<00:00:27.750> we're

some beds and it's nighttime so we're

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.320 
some beds and it's nighttime so we're
going<00:00:27.960> to<00:00:28.050> sleep<00:00:28.439> set<00:00:29.310> my<00:00:29.550> spawn<00:00:29.849> point<00:00:30.119> this

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
going to sleep set my spawn point this

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.470 
going to sleep set my spawn point this
means<00:00:30.510> i<00:00:30.660> choose<00:00:30.990> terrorist<00:00:31.529> side<00:00:31.769> and<00:00:32.300> 4<00:00:33.300> x

diamond swords so you know it's a it's
an<00:00:39.329> FPS<00:00:39.780> map<00:00:40.050> so<00:00:40.320> i<00:00:40.350> figured<00:00:40.680> why<00:00:40.829> not<00:00:40.860> get<00:00:41.129> the

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
an FPS map so i figured why not get the

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.819 
an FPS map so i figured why not get the
only<00:00:41.579> shooting<00:00:41.910> item<00:00:42.210> in<00:00:42.300> the<00:00:42.390> game<00:00:44.180> see<00:00:45.180> here

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:45.829 
only shooting item in the game see here

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:50.330 
only shooting item in the game see here
comments<00:00:46.829> knifepoint<00:00:47.100> and<00:00:48.500> here's<00:00:49.500> that<00:00:49.980> part

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
comments knifepoint and here's that part

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.850 
comments knifepoint and here's that part
in<00:00:51.149> order<00:00:51.390> to<00:00:51.510> go<00:00:51.600> to<00:00:51.629> be<00:00:51.930> tunnels

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.590 

and<00:00:57.260> here's<00:00:58.260> be<00:00:58.500> tunnels<00:00:59.120> so<00:01:00.120> as<00:01:00.210> you<00:01:00.300> can<00:01:00.450> see

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
and here's be tunnels so as you can see

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.280 
and here's be tunnels so as you can see
it's<00:01:00.780> built<00:01:01.020> pretty<00:01:01.320> much<00:01:01.590> to<00:01:01.890> scale<00:01:02.280> and

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:03.290 
it's built pretty much to scale and

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.900 
it's built pretty much to scale and
here's<00:01:04.290> down<00:01:04.530> here<00:01:04.770> and<00:01:04.949> lower<00:01:05.100> be<00:01:05.339> tunnels

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:07.910 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:11.120 

again<00:01:08.910> that's<00:01:09.240> nine<00:01:09.570> point<00:01:10.020> nobody<00:01:10.650> likes<00:01:10.920> it

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
again that's nine point nobody likes it

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.550 
again that's nine point nobody likes it
and<00:01:11.400> I<00:01:11.670> hear<00:01:11.880> CT<00:01:12.330> spawn<00:01:12.570> again<00:01:12.810> same<00:01:13.290> thing

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
and I hear CT spawn again same thing

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.320 
and I hear CT spawn again same thing
with<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.740> x<00:01:13.979> zone<00:01:14.280> and<00:01:14.700> there's<00:01:14.880> a<00:01:14.970> room<00:01:15.150> in

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
with the x zone and there's a room in

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:24.770 
with the x zone and there's a room in
the<00:01:15.420> back<00:01:15.600> with<00:01:16.170> chests<00:01:22.100> here's<00:01:23.120> a<00:01:24.120> bomb<00:01:24.479> site

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
the back with chests here's a bomb site

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.420

B and you know everything is just like

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.190 
B and you know everything is just like
it<00:01:29.670> is<00:01:29.759> a<00:01:29.790> counter-strike<00:01:30.390> I<00:01:30.570> even<00:01:30.900> try<00:01:31.140> to

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
it is a counter-strike I even try to

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.820 
it is a counter-strike I even try to
build<00:01:31.560> all<00:01:31.830> the<00:01:32.040> typical<00:01:32.430> camp<00:01:32.910> spots<00:01:33.740> so<00:01:34.740> you

build all the typical camp spots so you
know<00:01:35.070> you<00:01:35.130> have<00:01:35.280> behind<00:01:35.729> these<00:01:36.000> boxes<00:01:36.479> here<00:01:36.690> in

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
know you have behind these boxes here in

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.700 
know you have behind these boxes here in
bombsite<00:01:37.590> B<00:01:37.619> and<00:01:38.250> more<00:01:39.150> boxes<00:01:39.600> over<00:01:39.810> here<00:01:39.840> so

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
bombsite B and more boxes over here so

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.730 
bombsite B and more boxes over here so
you<00:01:40.740> can<00:01:41.009> kind<00:01:41.250> of<00:01:41.310> camp<00:01:41.910> be<00:01:42.360> tunnels<00:01:42.810> and<00:01:43.229> as

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
you can kind of camp be tunnels and as

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:44.870 
you can kind of camp be tunnels and as
you<00:01:43.830> can<00:01:43.950> see<00:01:43.979> it's<00:01:44.190> pretty<00:01:44.399> dark<00:01:44.640> and<00:01:44.790> be

you can see it's pretty dark and be

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.510 
you can see it's pretty dark and be
tunnels<00:01:45.240> I<00:01:45.509> wanted<00:01:46.380> to<00:01:46.500> use<00:01:46.619> this<00:01:46.770> very<00:01:47.009> like

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
tunnels I wanted to use this very like

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
tunnels I wanted to use this very like
very<00:01:47.670> little<00:01:48.300> lighting<00:01:49.850> and<00:01:50.850> again<00:01:51.330> just

going<00:01:51.810> thru<00:01:51.990> lower<00:01:52.110> be<00:01:52.410> tunnels<00:01:52.740> to<00:01:52.920> show<00:01:53.130> that

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399
