I'm reading the 3-step once I realize

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.000 
I'm reading the 3-step once I realize
that<00:00:42.180> it's<00:00:42.540> a<00:00:42.660> intermediate<00:00:43.350> route<00:00:43.800> is

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
that it's a intermediate route is

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.799 
that it's a intermediate route is
something<00:00:44.370> over<00:00:44.640> three<00:00:44.910> steps<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.390> five<00:00:45.629> or

something over three steps the five or

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.900 
something over three steps the five or
seven<00:00:46.110> step<00:00:46.260> drop<00:00:46.469> I've<00:00:46.920> got<00:00:47.100> a<00:00:47.129> lock<00:00:47.430> back<00:00:47.730> in

everything look the same alignment and
assignment<00:01:17.159> that<00:01:17.250> is<00:01:17.399> so<00:01:17.670> key<00:01:17.909> that<00:01:18.119> we<00:01:18.180> always

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
assignment that is so key that we always

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.990 
assignment that is so key that we always
get<00:01:18.630> lined<00:01:19.140> up<00:01:19.380> correctly<00:01:19.520> once<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.610> ball<00:01:20.790> is

the shoulder always have a hand up

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.300 
the shoulder always have a hand up
because<00:01:49.900> he<00:01:50.140> does<00:01:50.320> catch<00:01:50.650> it<00:01:50.830> I<00:01:50.950> can<00:01:51.070> make<00:01:51.190> you

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
because he does catch it I can make you

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.460 
because he does catch it I can make you
tap<00:01:51.520> it<00:01:52.270> takes<00:01:52.480> a<00:01:52.570> lot<00:01:52.810> of<00:01:52.840> practice<00:01:53.380> and
