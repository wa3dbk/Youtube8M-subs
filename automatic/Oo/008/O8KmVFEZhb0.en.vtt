00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.400
 Hello my dear, today I'll show you 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:20.800
 again a sweet cake for a baby 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.540
 make party can as you can see the 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.320
 Church already bosom with white of 

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:25.000
 the 1 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.330
 The bosom consists of a chocolate 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.119
 dough and a show cars as well as the 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:33.309
 The bakeware is easy to bake 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:36.250
 only two break I get from ikea 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:38.170
 had and overall I have twice 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.750
 chocolate dough is used for that 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:43.090
 Ample amount then I have me 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:45.910
 white don of a light blue tone 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:47.920
 endangered as you can see and do 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:50.680
 then with the bear paw tool one 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:53.350
 beautiful edge with it all 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:55.510
 make a beautiful top looks and 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:57.579
 cut that right around me 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.950
 to stock up on it 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:02.380
 so that from there on the other 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:04.449
 I'll just take blankets there 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:06.399
 always water moisten that one 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:08.909
 bit and that dissolves the 

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:11.259
 sugar and the whole becomes sticky 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.759
 so we can see because I'm here 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:15.520
 stop with the belly as you can the 

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:17.020
 whole ten and then I suppose for it 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.749
 the larger piece of what I imagined 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:22.509
 have and cut and click 

00:01:19.749 --> 00:01:23.979
 then what is too much about it 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:25.749
 Of course, carefully 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:29.459
 I cut it off here already 

00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:31.569
 I have to live on my cake plate 

00:01:29.459 --> 00:01:33.459
 I'll have the whole thing on the other 

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:36.310
 also done it again and that way 

00:01:33.459 --> 00:01:38.139
 that then the belly but still to see 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.509
 I saw then a motive on it 

00:01:38.139 --> 00:01:41.829
 do 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.329
 but that is the transition between the 

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:47.649
 bottom of the belly a bit more beautiful 

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:50.380
 I now look like a band in the 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:52.329
 white stripes daze that 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:55.090
 bit blue from the hype dots 

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:58.479
 so to speak, put it all in 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:00.459
 rolled out again and long and then 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:03.340
 accordingly tailored to it 

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:05.619
 just looks like as if still 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:08.590
 times such a tank would be between posen 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:10.929
 and belly of the rest of dorfers 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.090
 now with these points I am therefore 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:16.990
 then kneaded one again 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:20.260
 that I can have a nice yes one 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:22.930
 mark out and then have one 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:25.659
 teddy bear biscuit cookie cutter see the 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.960
 Now I have to lie in blue 

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:28.990
 still 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:30.970
 this gouged out and then right 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:32.560
 and top left into the corner of one 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.730
 kickboard made so that you one 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.730
 little bit for beautiful leads 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:44.000
 as you see here prank 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:46.550
 water on top of that from there and 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:52.550
 stick the whole then and cuts 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:54.470
 that is also right here you can see 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.390
 Unfortunately, the motive is not exactly accurate 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.760
 but we have a motive on one of the 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:01.130
 I can link you in 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.110

 here with what more i sing after rising 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:12.800
 You can make it easily by 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:16.730
 Beat her egg white and then 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:19.340

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.840

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.480

 as you can see 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:41.870
 and a little bit more 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:45.350
 I then refine one again 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:47.150
 toothpick reworked and that was 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:49.880

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:51.530
 I hope you liked it and me 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:53.420
