whether it's catching bait whether it's
catching<00:01:44.579> dolphin<00:01:45.119> or<00:01:45.210> sailfish<00:01:45.799> it's<00:01:46.799> a<00:01:46.920> big

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
catching dolphin or sailfish it's a big

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.789 
catching dolphin or sailfish it's a big
difference<00:01:47.670> in<00:01:47.909> what<00:01:48.329> you<00:01:48.540> can<00:01:48.750> end<00:01:49.619> up

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
difference in what you can end up

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.580 
difference in what you can end up
catching<00:01:50.009> yeah<00:01:50.460> because<00:01:51.360> there<00:01:51.930> is<00:01:52.110> there<00:01:52.560> is

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
catching yeah because there is there is

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.740 
catching yeah because there is there is
a<00:01:52.770> pattern<00:01:53.159> there<00:01:53.549> is<00:01:53.579> a<00:01:53.729> reason<00:01:54.210> they<00:01:54.360> do<00:01:54.420> what

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
a pattern there is a reason they do what

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.139 
a pattern there is a reason they do what
they<00:01:54.869> do<00:01:54.930> after<00:01:55.350> trolling<00:01:55.950> baits<00:01:56.189> and<00:01:56.460> chasing

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
they do after trolling baits and chasing

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.510 
they do after trolling baits and chasing
birds<00:01:57.360> for<00:01:57.659> over<00:01:57.899> two<00:01:58.110> hours<00:01:58.189> finally<00:01:59.189> a

birds for over two hours finally a
breakthrough<00:02:00.090> we<00:02:01.020> were<00:02:01.079> talking<00:02:01.500> about<00:02:01.560> big

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
breakthrough we were talking about big

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.760 
breakthrough we were talking about big
pieces<00:02:02.460> in<00:02:02.610> every<00:02:02.969> and<00:02:03.750> you<00:02:03.869> said<00:02:04.110> floating

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
pieces in every and you said floating

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.069 
pieces in every and you said floating
rafts<00:02:05.009> and<00:02:05.369> that<00:02:05.790> sort<00:02:06.090> of<00:02:06.119> thing<00:02:06.329> I<00:02:06.600> think<00:02:06.960> we

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
rafts and that sort of thing I think we

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.020 
rafts and that sort of thing I think we
found<00:02:07.259> one<00:02:07.560> in<00:02:07.710> front<00:02:07.920> of<00:02:07.979> us<00:02:08.129> we<00:02:08.610> got<00:02:08.759> a<00:02:08.789> wrap

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
found one in front of us we got a wrap

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.880 
found one in front of us we got a wrap
we<00:02:09.330> got<00:02:09.479> a<00:02:09.509> big<00:02:09.810> piece<00:02:10.050> of<00:02:10.229> debris<00:02:10.319> it<00:02:10.679> looks

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
we got a big piece of debris it looks

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.280 
we got a big piece of debris it looks
like<00:02:11.099> a<00:02:11.129> raft<00:02:11.430> I<00:02:11.819> don't<00:02:12.239> believe<00:02:12.629> it<00:02:12.900> we've

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
like a raft I don't believe it we've

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.380 
like a raft I don't believe it we've
really<00:02:13.620> found<00:02:13.890> a<00:02:14.220> raft<00:02:14.580> I<00:02:14.790> mean<00:02:15.060> they<00:02:15.270> go

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
really found a raft I mean they go

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.809 
really found a raft I mean they go
