00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:04.740
 but there are those who say that the breakdown of their 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:10.170
 steal the league that stole the league are 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:13.410
 about different know this is two 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:16.530
 virtually tournament is 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.530
 very well 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.750
 america is happening with the moment what 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:25.930
 has shown in every game that is 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:28.000
 playing is on the right foot I think 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:30.699
 that at this moment that's not the best thing is 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.949
 League team but you know that 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:35.110
 the different line also of the league 

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:37.239
 the 8 that enters aspires to look for the 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:40.330
 title and that we are not going to 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:41.800
 leave without dreaming and without thinking that 

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:43.210
 toluca entering the baseline a serious 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.820
 candidate for the title I 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:49.180
 I have a question defensively 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:51.219
 you have changed your equipment 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.440
 suddenly that line of four but 

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:54.430
 hangs with five line 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.989
 that really more degree of the 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.850
 flexibility that you demonstrate you can 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:00.850
 handle players but you have armed 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:03.579
 as you willow some as the case 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:06.940
 of owners due to injury or because you have not 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:09.460
 found your ideal defense to for 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:12.610
 define a defensive scheme of your own 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:15.330
 speaking we changed we came 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.330
 playing company 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.640
 we started a quintal any because 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.909
 we want to have a right side that 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.530
 it's going very well we organized that 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.380
 changing with a line of four and 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.880
 we go the most solid defensively 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.229
 next three in the middle and three points and 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.880
 I think that that will have to be 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.750
 It surprised a little less than expected a 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.700
 toluca online five and up with a 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:43.110
 9 with a half tip at the end we put 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:45.479
 two open with a 9 with sinha in the 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.390
 joint creation thiago that they did 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.460
 very well 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:52.010
 we arrived the pre-season we have 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:55.310
 worked five line out of the 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:57.860
 pp final result based on 100% 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.290
 functioning in what match did we see the 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.350
 toluca what would you like to see always and for 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:03.479
 what 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.970
 Look, I say that people talk a lot 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:09.049
 in the game we play we won 4 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.049
 0 against 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:15.500
 of visit and I really liked the game and 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.180
 I would like players to play 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.600
 with the same determination mission was 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.780
 against morelia 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:23.910
 we always win three games and 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.770
 just that the league at that time is 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:29.360
 because there is something new that we gain 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:32.730
 us in 71 the 40 against querÃ©taro 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:34.470
 but you did not see two teams playing well 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.660
 but against morals and fear and 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.160
 agreement very well because he is very talented 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.110
 toluca is also offered so very well 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.570
 it seems to me that that match and I liked it 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:45.120
 a lot and not because we won but because 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:47.730
 the two teams showed an idea 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.500
 different and in that same tenor pp what is 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.300
 the toluca that you would not like 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.910
 reappear or at least I do not know if 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:56.220
 in a complete game or the 30 minutes of 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:03:02.880
 what party did you like and news 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:05.160
 the parties could appear more or 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.470
 less but the game and a team that 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:13.560
 can aspire to a title can not have 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:15.930
 that foundation for the comment on 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:18.720
 the the good taste of mouth left by the 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:20.580
 Morelia match against a team that 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.010
 it closed very well previous history has been 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:24.569
 ripped off very well that it's about the 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:30.209
 ball that has 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:31.770
 he has talent from minute 1 and 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:34.590
 they were 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:37.410
 two or three times I work on Mars 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:39.060
 business and they end up winning 4-3 if 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:40.200
 I had twelve games without losing morals 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.690
 he does it for you 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.770
 that's why I liked it a lot, not because 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.920
 won but because the two teams 

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:48.780
 It showed a football idea 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:50.100
 important and offensive because because 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.410
 Morelia also made goals for me 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:55.350
 go ahead and we draw and again 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:57.150
 Morelia did not hit us again 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:58.290
 team never lost its calm that what 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.850
 We talk a lot with men who 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:01.350
 work rode the week keep the 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:03.450
 possession of the ball where really 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:05.880
 It can be a goal because no, but we have to 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:08.010
 have the ability to lift it and believe 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:10.160
 in the capacity each in which 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.160
 we're 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:35.090
 he has also scored more goals and also 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:35.090
 it's good
