00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.960
 1 No, he means another 

00:00:13.739 --> 00:00:15.479
 Hello my name is a 2 

00:00:15.479 --> 00:00:18.769
 we have missed two beds so far road chalk 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.050
 you want to create a gift for a friend and Hoffmann to the 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:23.939
 hands 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.109
 I would suggest a scarf what you want to do 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:28.669
 8 is in the plus 

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:31.109
 you need owner wool 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:32.950
 us Mary 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:37.800
 us by that I mean the needles to kneel or otherwise weight 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.140
 the SEC had 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.620
 on the Bird Routers are always on the organizer 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.960
 what you can do with it how much you need for a rough one 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.250
 sweater 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.840
 and also we are no machines Obi 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.700
 that is 10 cm have different types want 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.710
 different machines numbers 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.010
 9 means that 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.390
 and seeks a beginning 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.460
 and then you make the first machines 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.230
 also the canton of Steins two bottles for ten centimeters now called the 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.480
 thread 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:15.240
 such a piece for the stitches Roche makes a loop there 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.940
 that would be the first machine in principle 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:21.460
 the little ones 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.880
 takes the needle 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.280
 and pushes the machine over the needles 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.100
 for the first serve 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.859
 it is probably your own questions 

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:33.010
 the ball stops 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:36.010
 in all other a happy ending 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.460
 No, because they are on top of each other 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.970
 the things in front like an afp reporter 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.970
 and then the first machines will have the survey 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:47.540
 banned the questions of FIFA 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.510
 the loop Brunner 7 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:51.630
 fixed 7 5 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.600
 the questions about the sensitivity and Lithuania the thumb 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.600
 Get the thread and that's a team 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.540
 "It's very important that it is not too tight and it is quite 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.390
 important that it does not loosen up 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:10.070
 the machine is supposed to be around the needle, which smidles it back and forth easily 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:13.219
 can be pushed 

00:02:13.219 --> 00:02:17.049
 in between pull forward at the pigeon house the index finger 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:28.749
 now the stitches are open 

00:02:28.749 --> 00:02:30.469
 then apply the work 

00:02:30.469 --> 00:02:31.599
 kick women 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:34.229
 and 12 if you can wash with leftovers 

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:35.969
 further injured 

00:02:35.969 --> 00:02:38.969
 by Martin Siegel and 9 

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:41.839
 a mesh 

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:45.459
 It is important that it is not that he is his cattle 

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:49.439
 then always stings from us are up one 

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:51.369
 and the thread 

00:02:51.369 --> 00:02:53.309
 make a mesh 

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:56.309
 from the front and the thread and the stitches 

00:02:56.949 --> 00:03:00.790
 so you've already knitted the first row not too tight here again 

00:03:00.789 --> 00:03:03.789
 is nice and easy wizards keep 

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:08.449
 and then you make the remaining fingers on the one point too 

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:11.159
 Â«You always work family friendly 

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:12.519
 the right-handed person 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:15.309
 in his work, however, remains 

00:03:15.309 --> 00:03:17.979
 if we have to wait now first 

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:21.579
 one meter sixty knits say comes the following one sprays one must the machine 

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:24.169
 get rid of the fools again 

00:03:24.169 --> 00:03:26.089
 you want a team 

00:03:26.089 --> 00:03:29.719
 then the next time is and draws the first team over the 

00:03:29.719 --> 00:03:31.689
 second team 

00:03:31.689 --> 00:03:36.509
 the streak the mesh Matti the first machine over the two singles 

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:39.509
 and all that can be done with all the people you are on 

00:03:40.189 --> 00:03:43.069
 just to turn 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:45.569
 and the end of the song 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:49.029
 then looks like this is called the stitch sample 

00:03:49.029 --> 00:03:52.689
 "Here and now" the serve Georgia Tech is clarified 

00:03:52.689 --> 00:03:54.439
 the wiki right 

00:03:54.439 --> 00:03:57.749
 The left was already there 

00:03:57.749 --> 00:04:01.760
 and for such a piece you need an hour and a half to watch TV 

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:05.650
 and if it does not look that bad in the beginning 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:07.519
 knitted on every row 

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:11.669
 it will always thank more relaxed relaxed relex and if you can 

00:04:11.669 --> 00:04:14.099
 at the top is important to Peter 

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:17.159
 then said you need to come when wearing the cap 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:22.009
 van de Flierdt Neighborhood needed I like to visit I like disappointed 

00:04:22.509 --> 00:04:25.129
 and I wish you a lot of fun knitting
