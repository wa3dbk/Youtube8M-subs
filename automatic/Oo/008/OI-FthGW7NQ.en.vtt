megapixel<00:01:53.939> shooter<00:01:54.240> but<00:01:54.899> the<00:01:54.960> good<00:01:55.200> thing<00:01:55.409> is

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
megapixel shooter but the good thing is

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.880 
megapixel shooter but the good thing is
that<00:01:55.680> it<00:01:56.130> can<00:01:56.430> shoot<00:01:56.729> video<00:01:56.939> in<00:01:57.630> 1080p<00:01:58.500> so

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
that it can shoot video in 1080p so

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.740 
that it can shoot video in 1080p so
that's<00:01:59.070> a<00:01:59.159> nice<00:01:59.340> thing<00:01:59.369> and<00:01:59.729> we<00:02:00.270> also<00:02:00.420> have<00:02:00.659> an

that it has a Snapdragon 410 chipset but

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.120 
that it has a Snapdragon 410 chipset but
that's<00:03:03.210> not<00:03:03.630> correct<00:03:03.990> and<00:03:04.440> the<00:03:04.830> screen<00:03:05.100> size

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
that's not correct and the screen size

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.940 
that's not correct and the screen size
is<00:03:05.550> a<00:03:05.610> 4.5<00:03:06.180> inch<00:03:06.480> screen<00:03:07.080> but<00:03:07.290> again<00:03:07.860> the

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
resolution is not that great it's just

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:13.460 
resolution is not that great it's just
800<00:03:09.750> by<00:03:10.050> 480<00:03:10.760> so<00:03:11.760> I'll<00:03:12.240> just<00:03:12.450> keep<00:03:12.720> this<00:03:13.020> and

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
800 by 480 so I'll just keep this and

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.310 
800 by 480 so I'll just keep this and
let's<00:03:13.770> finish<00:03:14.400> and<00:03:14.820> think<00:03:15.450> so<00:03:15.630> we<00:03:15.840> are<00:03:16.080> done

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
let's finish and think so we are done

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:19.010 
let's finish and think so we are done
yes<00:03:16.980> we<00:03:17.220> are<00:03:17.459> booted<00:03:17.940> and<00:03:18.209> we<00:03:18.600> don't<00:03:18.780> get<00:03:18.959> any

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:19.020 
yes we are booted and we don't get any

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:21.140 
yes we are booted and we don't get any
auto<00:03:19.290> brightness<00:03:19.530> sensor<00:03:19.890> as<00:03:20.430> you<00:03:20.610> can<00:03:20.760> see<00:03:20.910> I

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
auto brightness sensor as you can see I

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.000 
auto brightness sensor as you can see I
don't<00:03:21.420> have<00:03:21.630> that<00:03:21.870> so<00:03:22.050> looks<00:03:22.260> like<00:03:22.440> we<00:03:22.890> don't

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
don't have that so looks like we don't

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:24.680 
don't have that so looks like we don't
have<00:03:23.250> any<00:03:23.459> auto<00:03:23.670> brightness<00:03:23.910> so<00:03:24.300> you<00:03:24.360> got<00:03:24.600> to

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
have any auto brightness so you got to

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.410 
have any auto brightness so you got to
manually<00:03:25.170> adjust<00:03:25.890> the<00:03:25.920> brightness<00:03:26.250> on<00:03:26.730> this

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
manually adjust the brightness on this

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.620 
manually adjust the brightness on this
device<00:03:27.770> let's<00:03:28.770> quickly<00:03:29.070> actually<00:03:29.640> look<00:03:30.360> at

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
device let's quickly actually look at

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:32.840 
device let's quickly actually look at
the<00:03:30.959> Conrad<00:03:31.380> version<00:03:31.709> that<00:03:31.860> we<00:03:32.040> get<00:03:32.310> let's<00:03:32.700> go

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
the Conrad version that we get let's go

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:35.930 
the Conrad version that we get let's go
to<00:03:32.940> the<00:03:33.060> settings<00:03:33.570> and<00:03:34.530> if<00:03:34.830> we<00:03:35.010> go<00:03:35.250> to<00:03:35.280> about

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
to the settings and if we go to about

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.870 
to the settings and if we go to about
the<00:03:36.120> device<00:03:37.160> it<00:03:38.160> comes<00:03:38.430> with<00:03:38.580> the<00:03:38.670> Android

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
the device it comes with the Android

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.380 
the device it comes with the Android
version<00:03:39.060> 4.4.4<00:03:39.930> which<00:03:40.560> is<00:03:40.950> KitKat<00:03:41.730> so<00:03:42.180> that's

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
version 4.4.4 which is KitKat so that's

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:46.640 
version 4.4.4 which is KitKat so that's
a<00:03:42.750> nice<00:03:43.080> thing<00:03:43.380> in<00:03:43.530> my<00:03:43.650> opinion<00:03:43.770> and<00:03:45.650> let's

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
a nice thing in my opinion and let's

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.160 
a nice thing in my opinion and let's
look<00:03:46.860> at<00:03:47.010> the<00:03:47.100> storage<00:03:47.400> also<00:03:48.030> we<00:03:48.600> did<00:03:48.780> not<00:03:48.810> add

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170 
look at the storage also we did not add

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:51.680 
look at the storage also we did not add
a<00:03:49.200> micro<00:03:49.650> SD<00:03:49.890> card<00:03:50.130> and<00:03:50.370> out<00:03:50.940> of<00:03:51.060> that<00:03:51.150> 8<00:03:51.420> gigs

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
a micro SD card and out of that 8 gigs

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.350 
a micro SD card and out of that 8 gigs
of<00:03:51.810> internal<00:03:51.989> storage<00:03:52.760> the<00:03:53.760> space<00:03:54.000> that<00:03:54.239> we

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
of internal storage the space that we

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.210 
of internal storage the space that we
have<00:03:54.540> is<00:03:54.720> 5.3<00:03:55.470> gigabytes

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
have is 5.3 gigabytes

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.880 
have is 5.3 gigabytes
we<00:03:56.670> can<00:03:56.820> also<00:03:57.030> add<00:03:57.330> a<00:03:57.360> micro<00:03:57.870> SD<00:03:58.200> card<00:03:58.440> to<00:03:58.530> this

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
we can also add a micro SD card to this

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:01.010 
we can also add a micro SD card to this
device<00:03:59.280> so<00:03:59.520> looks<00:03:59.730> decent<00:04:00.120> I<00:04:00.420> would<00:04:00.600> say<00:04:00.780> and
