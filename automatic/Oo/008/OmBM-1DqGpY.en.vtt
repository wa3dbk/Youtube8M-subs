00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:10.320 

I<00:00:07.900> do<00:00:08.410> think<00:00:08.680> as<00:00:08.769> well<00:00:08.950> using<00:00:09.280> the<00:00:09.580> uppercut

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:10.330 
I do think as well using the uppercut

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:13.670 
I do think as well using the uppercut
for<00:00:10.570> moving<00:00:10.809> targets<00:00:11.350> and<00:00:11.620> the<00:00:12.070> punch<00:00:12.910> combos

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:13.680 
for moving targets and the punch combos

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.170 
for moving targets and the punch combos
distortions<00:00:14.680> for<00:00:15.040> stationary<00:00:15.700> ones<00:00:15.969> are

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:16.180 
distortions for stationary ones are

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:19.400 
distortions for stationary ones are
guaranteed<00:00:16.780> stun<00:00:17.080> ones<00:00:17.350> is<00:00:17.560> the<00:00:18.310> way<00:00:18.460> to<00:00:18.520> go

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
guaranteed stun ones is the way to go

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.689 
guaranteed stun ones is the way to go
because<00:00:20.410> if<00:00:20.529> they<00:00:20.650> do<00:00:20.710> move<00:00:20.980> the<00:00:21.220> uppercut<00:00:21.550> can

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:21.699 
because if they do move the uppercut can

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:24.060 
because if they do move the uppercut can
chase<00:00:21.940> them<00:00:22.410> whereas<00:00:23.410> if<00:00:23.500> the<00:00:23.590> standing<00:00:23.890> still

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:24.070 
chase them whereas if the standing still

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:25.890 
chase them whereas if the standing still
sometimes<00:00:24.250> uppercut<00:00:24.730> can<00:00:24.880> miss<00:00:25.060> them<00:00:25.300> which

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:25.900 
sometimes uppercut can miss them which

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.409 
sometimes uppercut can miss them which
is<00:00:26.019> a<00:00:26.050> little<00:00:26.320> bit<00:00:26.410> of<00:00:26.500> mine<00:00:27.179> but<00:00:28.179> we're<00:00:28.390> just

00:00:28.409 --> 00:00:28.419 
is a little bit of mine but we're just

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:32.230 
is a little bit of mine but we're just
for<00:00:28.720> Sanctus<00:00:29.169> now<00:00:29.410> and<00:00:29.710> Sanctus

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:32.240 
for Sanctus now and Sanctus

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.330 
for Sanctus now and Sanctus
you<00:00:32.870> saw<00:00:33.050> me<00:00:33.230> fighting<00:00:33.440> last<00:00:33.890> time<00:00:34.100> when<00:00:34.250> we

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:34.340 
you saw me fighting last time when we

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.550 
you saw me fighting last time when we
landed<00:00:34.700> that<00:00:34.820> punch<00:00:35.120> so<00:00:35.450> maybe<00:00:35.690> we<00:00:35.840> can<00:00:36.020> land

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:36.560 
landed that punch so maybe we can land

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:37.690 
landed that punch so maybe we can land
another<00:00:36.830> one<00:00:36.980> of<00:00:37.070> those<00:00:37.130> punches<00:00:37.400> heard

that<00:04:21.370> explosion<00:04:21.970> when<00:04:22.120> your<00:04:22.240> class<00:04:22.449> is<00:04:22.720> so

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:23.590 
that explosion when your class is so

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:25.500 
that explosion when your class is so
tight<00:04:23.979> you<00:04:24.370> must<00:04:24.820> have<00:04:24.970> to<00:04:25.090> be<00:04:25.120> on<00:04:25.360> those

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:41.900 
we're on but the best difficulty in the

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:44.050 
we're on but the best difficulty in the
world<00:04:42.110> and<00:04:42.469> there's<00:04:42.620> only<00:04:42.710> two<00:04:42.979> dudes<00:04:43.249> because

00:04:59.029 --> 00:04:59.039 

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:02.749 

and<00:04:59.580> they<00:04:59.669> don't<00:05:00.680> there's<00:05:01.680> not<00:05:01.800> no<00:05:01.979> I<00:05:02.279> find

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:04.730 
and they don't there's not no I find
this<00:05:02.819> really<00:05:03.089> boring<00:05:03.210> actually<00:05:03.529> but<00:05:04.529> I<00:05:04.559> think

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:04.740 
this really boring actually but I think

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:08.389 
this really boring actually but I think
if<00:05:04.830> you<00:05:04.919> beat<00:05:05.659> 30<00:05:06.659> kills<00:05:07.099> you<00:05:08.099> can<00:05:08.249> get

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:08.399 
if you beat 30 kills you can get

00:05:08.399 --> 00:05:10.159 
if you beat 30 kills you can get
alternate<00:05:08.849> colors<00:05:09.119> because<00:05:09.479> I've<00:05:09.599> got<00:05:09.749> an

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:10.169 
alternate colors because I've got an

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:13.850 
alternate colors because I've got an

threshold but no damage in Sanctus is

00:05:28.199 --> 00:05:29.450 
threshold but no damage in Sanctus is
something<00:05:28.589> that<00:05:28.740> I'm<00:05:28.830> not<00:05:28.860> very<00:05:29.009> good<00:05:29.339> at

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:29.460 
something that I'm not very good at

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:32.420 
something that I'm not very good at
doing<00:05:29.550> better<00:05:30.360> at<00:05:30.539> doing<00:05:30.719> it<00:05:30.839> with<00:05:30.960> a<00:05:31.129> Nero<00:05:32.129> but

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:32.430 
doing better at doing it with a Nero but

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:34.489 
doing better at doing it with a Nero but
not<00:05:32.550> so<00:05:32.699> much<00:05:32.819> with<00:05:33.029> Virgil<00:05:33.539> even<00:05:34.289> though<00:05:34.379> I<00:05:34.409> do

00:05:34.489 --> 00:05:34.499 
not so much with Virgil even though I do

00:05:34.499 --> 00:05:36.889 
not so much with Virgil even though I do
think<00:05:34.559> Virgil<00:05:34.889> is<00:05:35.479> insanely<00:05:36.479> powerful

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:36.899 
think Virgil is insanely powerful

00:05:36.899 --> 00:05:38.420 
think Virgil is insanely powerful
against<00:05:37.439> a<00:05:37.499> character<00:05:37.919> because<00:05:38.189> of<00:05:38.309> how

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:38.430 
against a character because of how

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:40.399 
against a character because of how
quickly<00:05:38.819> you<00:05:39.360> can<00:05:39.389> cover<00:05:39.749> the<00:05:39.899> distance<00:05:40.020> to

00:05:40.399 --> 00:05:40.409 
quickly you can cover the distance to

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:43.489 
quickly you can cover the distance to
him<00:05:40.529> if<00:05:40.979> the<00:05:41.879> Buster<00:05:42.270> had<00:05:42.419> the<00:05:42.539> range<00:05:42.809> that

00:05:43.489 --> 00:05:43.499 
him if the Buster had the range that

00:05:43.499 --> 00:05:46.040 
him if the Buster had the range that
Virgil's<00:05:43.949> Buster<00:05:44.309> has<00:05:44.490> it<00:05:44.819> would<00:05:45.360> be<00:05:45.509> godlike

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:46.050 
Virgil's Buster has it would be godlike

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:48.709 
Virgil's Buster has it would be godlike
but<00:05:46.830> that<00:05:47.520> was<00:05:47.669> a<00:05:47.699> balance<00:05:48.059> conceit<00:05:48.360> we<00:05:48.449> put<00:05:48.629> in

00:05:48.709 --> 00:05:48.719 
but that was a balance conceit we put in

00:05:48.719 --> 00:05:49.999 
but that was a balance conceit we put in
to<00:05:48.839> make<00:05:49.020> sure<00:05:49.229> that<00:05:49.319> you<00:05:49.409> couldn't<00:05:49.710> do<00:05:49.830> what
