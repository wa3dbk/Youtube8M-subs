00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:18.800
 My name is Héctor Rodríguez I am the owner 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.580
 of the team 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.580
 USA 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:32.989
 first and we will qualify this 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.910
 for the online qualifiers that 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:36.370
 they needed this place a lot and win 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:39.469
 many points on the web 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:41.719
 unfortunately it is camper tablet not 

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:43.340
 I was 17 years old 

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:46.100
 to qualify our way 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:47.240
 we need 18 years then that's us 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.090
 left in a position that nothing else 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:53.590
 we could qualify in mlg in dallas 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.590
 and that's what we did 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:03.090
 in our team we also have 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:05.339
 you two players who go to school 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.880
 and we have a player who just 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:14.580
 finish high school or high school 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:17.070
 of high school and are the colleges have 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:21.210
 done last year decided to leave the 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:24.810
 school to concentrate on the juventus 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:27.900
 and be professional players from around the 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:30.930
 day how your job is to change 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:33.960
 has decided to stop taking a year 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.000
 where he does not go to school to try 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.479
 do something with that and we're going to focus 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.479
 in that 

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:58.079
 I think this Spanish players 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:02:00.569
 this obviously play very well 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:02.310
 they were nothing about impressive to 

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:03.450
 play against many teams and they 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.640
 we win many teams is 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:09.090
 incredibly they played well the only thing that 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.560
 I see that what they are going is actually 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.690
 not have the opportunity to practice 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.700
 this with teams of their own level 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.760
 they always play this with the competition 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:20.190
 they have there in europe and I say that 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.480
 if they come to play clear that if they have 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.130
 the opportunity to practice with 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.299
 players and teams this Americans this 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.299
 will get to that super easy level 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.870
 and something else 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:40.459
 before that I suggest or 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:42.810
 obviously Spain is a country with good 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:45.450
 east gaming community 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:48.270
 and I think that if they start to put effort 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.680
 to make this your videos on youtube to 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:53.160
 make streams dedicated to 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:56.430
 obviously your country can grow to taxis 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:59.580
 or a professional job before and 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:01.769
 he started doing this video if they have a 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.269
 very very successful career at that time 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:06.380
 and this is something that everyone can do 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:09.660
 to a base is the commitment they put 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:13.590
 ajax and bayern followed to what he said is given to me 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:16.080
 is that optimistic but not necessarily 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:19.620
 is is one the other is to optimize that is a 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:21.000
 perfect example that you can do what 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.610
 You can kill yourself at a certain time 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.069
 you can make your videos in that time and 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:28.769
 let's say 12 to 6 you start doing your 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:30.750
 livestream and then from 6 to 10 you put on 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:32.130
 practicing with your team is a job 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.959
 what you have to do all day like this 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:38.030
 like everyone and that's why I have a commitment 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:38.030
 to be going to have this good result 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:49.340
 thank you very much for having me here 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:51.350
 unfortunately we could not explain 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.720
 first place but I promise we're going 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:56.120
 to treat your own as soon as possible 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:59.020
 possible to return the latter is where 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.020
 we are next
