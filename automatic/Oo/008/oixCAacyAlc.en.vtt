 commitment to their games and can very well 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:47.600

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.840
 My magic balls seemed like I can not know 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:46.379
 why was that good we go 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:48.629
 I think I made the villa iway the village 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:55.160
 that is the village of the ranchito with great 

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:55.160
 llama and de faus his house from here 

00:02:55.939 --> 00:03:03.049
 as a portal is playing a portal 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.049
 a store 

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:06.520
 d 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.340
 and 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.900
 and here and here they give me a sword that more 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.950
 that nothing of the beginning not at the beginning of 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.900
 game 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:16.510
 later I think we have to go to 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.460
 look for those who is our teacher who 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:21.300
 is more advanced and then they kill you 

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:23.980
 wey and they give you the unlocked world not 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:26.200
 everything is very good I liked it as 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.030
 I tell them the graphics look great on 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.610
 12 I like the municipality pinche as 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.070
 look good bastard 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:33.410
 this law comes well gaming the game of 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:35.540
 Bank 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:37.160
 here here is good in the inventory 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:42.850
 all your things here, nothing more 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:42.850
 I have a sword on the map 

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:50.610
 Well, they are like the missions that 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.610
 you have to do 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:55.569
 good teacher and another thing that showed 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.519
 much is this culture controls 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:58.900
 very few let configure one hundred 

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:02.260
 hundred controls and as you see here 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:05.319
 simply let you move what is 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:08.560
 looked if you did not like it and tested something 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:11.230
 you modify them and you do not have to eat 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:13.959
 I say is and of missions about the beginning 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:15.940
 only a few tracks are killed but we are 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:20.040
 listening to the touches of my fingers 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:20.040
 but when when I play this guy d 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:25.360
 when I play this guy or do I review 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:28.630
 of games I like more to put what is 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:32.789
 without and without hearing aids because they are heard 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:32.789
 better the audio from very low 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:36.750
 Minecraft 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:43.580
 and good in parkour here here if I am 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.590
 good 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:47.090
 and now we have to go to bring 15 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:49.039
 that is here thrown 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:52.219
 good and unlock as a mission 

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:53.900
 an achievement more than anything good I do 

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:55.759
 I say achievement I do not know how they are true but 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:58.440
 I say that before they come to me 

00:04:55.759 --> 00:05:03.860
 put here you're wrong 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:03.860
 in 2006 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:10.950
 be fifteen old man lying with here 

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:14.270
 early here should be 

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:14.270
 and here 

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:21.930
 and then the boss comes out who really 

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:25.490
 we have to kill the master here gives us 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:25.490
 like a power 

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:33.880
 and good is like magic is not like a guy 

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:36.880
 shovel and I think that's what they're called 

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:36.880
 wizards 

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:47.440
 what counts 

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:58.330
 with power to kill 

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:06.730
 tell them final goodbye but as 

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:09.050
 they wanted the graphic is very very funny 

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:11.240
 right now and after this like that way 

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:14.270
 they take him home after he 

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:15.760
 good to cinnamon after you see it 

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:19.390
 River 

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:20.830
 and everyone is unlocked so that 

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:23.980
 start unlocking all the others 

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:25.840
 the other maps and things like that or the rest 

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:27.130
 roads not because they are not maps in the 

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:30.250
 there are only more roads that 

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:32.590
 block and that is what we say after 

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:36.120
 to study already has everything all 

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:38.220
 unblock the vera to 

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:40.490
 bad and do not work as I get the rest 

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:40.490
 from here 

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:43.230
 okay 

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:48.510
 and so I told myself this is a portal 

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:50.370
 then I have the whole map 

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:52.020
 unlocked to start playing if 

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:54.180
 They know English will do very well in a 

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:54.570
 game if you do not know it like me or not what 

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:56.280
 you know 

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:59.340
 maybe some things are going to have to 

00:06:56.280 --> 00:07:02.400
 be using the translator because I've 

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:08.390
 let's say if you leave it with your face 

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:08.390
 but no but good I liked it a lot 

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:23.410
 they do not die in one fell swoop and more 

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:25.670
 here is the other bastard more 

00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:28.110
 verb 

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:38.840
 for me 

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:44.780
 this is the totally free video on the 

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:48.110
 that promises a lot although I'll see if it 's 

00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:48.110
 head 

00:07:53.810 --> 00:08:02.390
 and see you in the next video up 

00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:02.390
 the next 

00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:07.330
 see you
