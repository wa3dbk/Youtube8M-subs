00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:08.099
 welcome everyone this release will be about 

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:10.889
 famous movie where the bear is catching up 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:14.190
 A lot of cyclists on the Internet copies 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:17.160
 broken about fake or not and today 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.869
 I found this video again in my native 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:23.060
 led the forum where it was filed as not 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:25.680
 fake here I want to collect the kern and 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:28.050
 put a fat point that this video is not 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:32.130
 the real one is so obvious 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:34.290
 moments but which all the same people will inspect 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.790
 there googled in on other forums 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:41.879
 dispute for example the obvious point is that 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:43.490
 brought the bear to fall and the orcs light 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.340
 glare white 

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:48.470
 But at the same time it is clear that the sun does not have light 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.540
 around him scattered such highlights to be 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:51.800
 should not 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.990
 it's not about that, it can still 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.780
 write off on so filmed so the light fell 

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:59.300
 tanks once worked there is another 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.380
 moment here at the very end 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:04.620
 well first for rushes 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:07.260
 eyes that bear here is more red than 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:10.320
 the first scenes are more gray here 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.900
 brown but this is also such a moment 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.750
 you can challenge but that can not be challenged 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.409
 give you show 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:20.710
 so according to the script bear 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:22.840
 the mil spec runs off then 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.980
 turns back see bears 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:28.890
 no and there goes about business 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:31.740
 here we go the moment when the cyclist 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.400
 for clarity, I turn up 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.400
 contrast 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.770
 half of inside my per branch card 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.200
 here is on a bush about 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.220
 the cyclist and the leaf are also dark 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.850
 on this thread 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.680
 to make it clear that this leaflet is on 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:53.610
 their rare I push it is clear that he 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:56.119
 moves along with the branch relatively 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.520
 thats all in distant trees that is 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:02.880
 the source belongs to this thread 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:04.310
 it is clearly seen here now 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.299
 remember this leaflet 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.399
 remember his form what he 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:11.870
 oblong stretched down to the ground and 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:15.120
 has a thick bottom at the bottom 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:17.280
 more black spot and now we 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.140
 rewind to the stage where we run away 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.540
 bear bear 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:24.060
 very well poisoned regarding 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.160
 tree at first I was thinking about this one 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.530
 the moment that there is a little muzzle here 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.190
 overlaps the tree but also difficult 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.870
 dig down 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.000
 may be really perfect 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:37.470
 coincided that here clearly face lay straight 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:40.230
 the contour of the tree and how can it not cant from 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.750
 weed but boxing so we look at 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.970
 this leaf 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:48.390
 look he is now clearly above 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:50.850
 bear and it seems like you can write off that 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:53.400
 everything is more or less ok 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:55.819
 until the bear begins to run away expert 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:58.040
 observe frame by frame 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:00.079
 and we watch as a bear to us our 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.680
 chakra head and chew half of it 

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:02.780
 leaflet 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.700
 that is, a bear that is clearly 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:07.790
 overlap half of this sheet 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:12.280
 This sheet is clearly visible here 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:14.880
 blocked here he opened blocked 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.880
 is open 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:20.240
 this moment cannot be explained not 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:22.970
 lighting features not features 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:25.310
 shooting the camera but I'm not talking about 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:27.470
 what at this moment if it falls 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:30.110
 such coverage to publishes what is under it 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:31.700
 there must be a shadow more serious than there 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:35.000
 they threw some server here 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:37.340
 parsing on I pay attributed no less than that 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.410
 the question is already such secondary but here is 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:42.920
 here it is perry sheet overlap 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:46.700
 which are clearly closer to the operator 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:49.550
 this moment cannot be explained anymore 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:50.990
 there is nothing here such things installation video 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:54.620
 Nevertheless, this work is awesome 

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:56.960
 qualitative she is very cool and in 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:59.830
 overall luck by the author in further success 

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:59.830
 is happy
