our story begins here with Knuckles take
him<00:01:19.310> apart<00:01:19.430> okay<00:01:20.420> so<00:01:20.479> here's<00:01:20.899> the<00:01:20.960> head<00:01:21.350> you

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
him apart okay so here's the head you

him apart okay so here's the head you
can<00:01:22.070> see<00:01:22.100> I<00:01:22.250> drawn<00:01:22.520> a<00:01:22.550> few<00:01:22.759> guidelines<00:01:23.060> for

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
can see I drawn a few guidelines for

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.770 
can see I drawn a few guidelines for
where<00:01:24.050> his<00:01:24.800> uh<00:01:24.940> slots<00:01:25.940> are<00:01:26.149> supposed<00:01:26.479> to<00:01:26.570> go

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
where his uh slots are supposed to go

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.590 
where his uh slots are supposed to go
and<00:01:27.050> then<00:01:28.009> I<00:01:28.130> built<00:01:28.520> up<00:01:28.759> the<00:01:28.789> roboticize

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 
and then I built up the roboticize

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.380 
and then I built up the roboticize
master<00:01:30.170> pieces<00:01:30.590> which<00:01:30.910> involved<00:01:31.910> cutting<00:01:32.240> off

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
master pieces which involved cutting off

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.900 
master pieces which involved cutting off
his<00:01:32.600> nose<00:01:32.930> and<00:01:33.440> sculpting<00:01:34.340> on<00:01:34.460> the<00:01:34.610> Roboto

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:34.910 
his nose and sculpting on the Roboto

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:37.900 
his nose and sculpting on the Roboto
size<00:01:35.119> master<00:01:35.420> faceplate<00:01:36.229> and<00:01:36.440> then<00:01:37.340> on<00:01:37.610> the

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:37.910 
size master faceplate and then on the

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:40.840 
size master faceplate and then on the
top<00:01:38.119> of<00:01:38.330> the<00:01:38.420> head<00:01:38.830> he<00:01:39.830> doesn't<00:01:39.950> so<00:01:40.430> much<00:01:40.490> wear

guy red again because my red paint

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:55.600 
guy red again because my red paint
doesn't<00:01:54.140> quite<00:01:54.380> match<00:01:54.649> the<00:01:54.679> red<00:01:55.099> the<00:01:55.280> knuckles

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
modded the legs I started out by cutting

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.979 
modded the legs I started out by cutting
all<00:02:05.149> these<00:02:05.360> hard<00:02:05.720> angles<00:02:06.319> into<00:02:06.500> his<00:02:06.740> feet<00:02:07.989> look

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:08.989 
all these hard angles into his feet look

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:11.470 
all these hard angles into his feet look
on<00:02:09.140> the<00:02:09.259> left<00:02:09.470> foot<00:02:09.709> there<00:02:10.009> it<00:02:10.670> was<00:02:10.789> a<00:02:10.819> bubble

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
on the left foot there it was a bubble

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.290 
on the left foot there it was a bubble
when<00:02:12.230> I<00:02:12.260> cut<00:02:12.709> the<00:02:12.920> excess<00:02:13.459> material<00:02:13.640> off<00:02:14.090> his

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 
when I cut the excess material off his

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.750 
when I cut the excess material off his
foot<00:02:14.480> I<00:02:14.540> reveal<00:02:14.959> about<00:02:15.110> bubble<00:02:15.770> I<00:02:16.040> didn't<00:02:16.670> know

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
foot I reveal about bubble I didn't know

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.460 
foot I reveal about bubble I didn't know
that<00:02:16.940> there<00:02:17.030> were<00:02:17.120> bubbles<00:02:17.540> inside<00:02:18.110> this<00:02:18.260> by

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
that there were bubbles inside this by

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.670 
that there were bubbles inside this by
sec<00:02:18.709> I<00:02:18.830> thought<00:02:18.980> it<00:02:19.099> was<00:02:19.190> solid<00:02:19.670> okay<00:02:20.620> okay<00:02:21.620> so

the others tool is more like there's a
straight<00:02:37.610> edge<00:02:37.819> to<00:02:37.849> it<00:02:38.330> you<00:02:38.660> know<00:02:40.030> anybody<00:02:41.030> who

notice<00:02:43.550> that<00:02:43.730> knuckles<00:02:44.450> man<00:02:44.660> seemed<00:02:45.140> to<00:02:45.290> be

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
notice that knuckles man seemed to be

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.110 
notice that knuckles man seemed to be
kind<00:02:45.770> of<00:02:45.980> a<00:02:46.040> little<00:02:46.220> bit<00:02:46.370> of<00:02:46.400> an<00:02:46.550> exception

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
kind of a little bit of an exception

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.210 
kind of a little bit of an exception
then<00:02:47.840> again<00:02:48.110> I<00:02:48.260> guess<00:02:48.410> it's<00:02:48.620> sort<00:02:48.830> of<00:02:48.860> supposed

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
then again I guess it's sort of supposed

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.390 
then again I guess it's sort of supposed
to<00:02:49.370> look<00:02:49.520> like<00:02:49.580> the<00:02:50.360> big<00:02:51.140> clodhoppers<00:02:52.130> that<00:02:52.280> he

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
to look like the big clodhoppers that he

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.620 
to look like the big clodhoppers that he
wears<00:02:52.580> all<00:02:52.760> the<00:02:52.820> time

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
wears all the time

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:55.650 
wears all the time
because<00:02:53.810> you<00:02:53.900> know<00:02:53.960> he<00:02:54.080> has<00:02:54.200> much<00:02:54.740> bigger

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
because you know he has much bigger

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.790 
because you know he has much bigger
squarish<00:02:56.660> feet<00:02:56.990> compared<00:02:57.500> to<00:02:57.590> the<00:02:57.680> other

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:57.800 
squarish feet compared to the other

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.150 
squarish feet compared to the other
characters<00:02:58.070> the<00:02:58.870> arms<00:02:59.870> are<00:03:00.080> a<00:03:00.110> simpler<00:03:00.620> mod<00:03:00.860> I

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
characters the arms are a simpler mod I

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.310 
characters the arms are a simpler mod I
just<00:03:01.640> had<00:03:01.790> to<00:03:01.940> build<00:03:02.240> up<00:03:02.450> the<00:03:02.630> glove<00:03:02.870> cuffs<00:03:03.170> to

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:03.320 
just had to build up the glove cuffs to

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:06.100 
just had to build up the glove cuffs to
go<00:03:03.470> closer<00:03:03.740> to<00:03:03.980> the<00:03:04.100> elbow<00:03:04.520> and<00:03:04.790> then<00:03:05.690> drawn

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 
go closer to the elbow and then drawn

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:09.400 
go closer to the elbow and then drawn
those<00:03:06.410> lines<00:03:06.740> on<00:03:07.100> his<00:03:07.190> knuckles<00:03:07.610> cuz<00:03:07.970> I<00:03:08.840> don't

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
those lines on his knuckles cuz I don't

know<00:03:09.500> like<00:03:09.920> I<00:03:10.160> guess<00:03:10.520> it<00:03:10.610> was<00:03:10.730> supposed<00:03:11.000> to

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:15.830 
segmented I don't know I guess just to

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:17.400 
segmented I don't know I guess just to
make<00:03:15.950> them<00:03:16.100> look<00:03:16.130> less<00:03:16.430> like<00:03:16.460> organic<00:03:16.940> gloves

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410
