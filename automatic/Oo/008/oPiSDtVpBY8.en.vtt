00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320 
it's making that noise sometimes the

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.229 
it's making that noise sometimes the
camera<00:02:17.650> does<00:02:17.800> I'm<00:02:17.950> really<00:02:18.160> weird<00:02:18.370> know<00:02:18.670> things

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
camera does I'm really weird know things

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:24.660 
camera does I'm really weird know things
I<00:02:19.540> don't<00:02:19.570> know<00:02:20.519> why<00:02:21.519> it<00:02:21.580> does<00:02:21.940> this<00:02:23.670> there's

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
I don't know why it does this there's

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:25.979 
I don't know why it does this there's
nothing<00:02:24.940> I<00:02:25.000> can<00:02:25.150> do<00:02:25.239> to<00:02:25.360> prove<00:02:25.540> to<00:02:25.600> you<00:02:25.750> this<00:02:25.870> is

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:25.989 
nothing I can do to prove to you this is

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:28.050 
nothing I can do to prove to you this is
real<00:02:26.220> well<00:02:27.220> first<00:02:27.430> I<00:02:27.519> can<00:02:27.580> use<00:02:27.760> the<00:02:27.850> keyboard

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
real well first I can use the keyboard

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.330 
real well first I can use the keyboard
moving<00:02:28.810> with<00:02:29.050> the<00:02:29.170> keyboard<00:02:29.560> is<00:02:29.709> extremely

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
moving with the keyboard is extremely

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.400 
moving with the keyboard is extremely
laggy<00:02:30.550> so<00:02:30.850> I<00:02:31.269> really<00:02:31.630> don't<00:02:31.810> recommend<00:02:32.080> using

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
laggy so I really don't recommend using

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:35.550 
laggy so I really don't recommend using
it<00:02:32.590> but<00:02:33.459> you<00:02:33.580> can<00:02:33.760> use<00:02:33.880> the<00:02:34.000> WASD<00:02:34.450> keys<00:02:35.080> and<00:02:35.380> you

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
it but you can use the WASD keys and you

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.590 
it but you can use the WASD keys and you
will<00:02:35.769> eventually<00:02:36.010> move<00:02:36.489> very<00:02:37.180> slowly

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.680 

do<00:02:40.600> you<00:02:40.660> see<00:02:40.840> I'm<00:02:40.989> walking<00:02:42.180> so<00:02:43.180> I<00:02:43.209> just<00:02:43.450> record

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
do you see I'm walking so I just record

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:45.710 
do you see I'm walking so I just record
what<00:02:43.959> I<00:02:43.989> really<00:02:44.290> recommend<00:02:44.470> is<00:02:44.860> just

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
what I really recommend is just

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.600 
what I really recommend is just
unselecting<00:02:46.720> any<00:02:46.840> gear<00:02:47.140> you<00:02:47.260> have<00:02:47.290> and<00:02:47.890> using

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
unselecting any gear you have and using

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:53.460 
unselecting any gear you have and using
the<00:02:50.010> regular<00:02:51.010> mouse<00:02:51.370> to<00:02:51.670> click<00:02:51.880> and<00:02:52.150> move<00:02:52.470> oops

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
the regular mouse to click and move oops

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:58.020 
the regular mouse to click and move oops
how<00:02:53.950> did<00:02:54.070> I<00:02:54.130> split<00:02:54.400> this<00:02:56.250> well<00:02:57.250> whatever<00:02:57.640> you

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
how did I split this well whatever you

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:03.630 
how did I split this well whatever you
do<00:02:58.320> you<00:02:59.320> get<00:02:59.440> the<00:02:59.560> point<00:03:02.130> so<00:03:03.130> another<00:03:03.489> thing

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
do you get the point so another thing

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.310 
do you get the point so another thing
