shots<00:05:06.020> there<00:05:06.260> I<00:05:06.320> think<00:05:06.560> overall<00:05:06.889> did<00:05:07.490> fairly

00:05:07.659 --> 00:05:07.669 
shots there I think overall did fairly

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:10.390 
shots there I think overall did fairly
well<00:05:08.289> but<00:05:09.289> it's<00:05:09.590> hard<00:05:09.770> to<00:05:09.830> dodge<00:05:10.039> them<00:05:10.250> all

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:10.400
