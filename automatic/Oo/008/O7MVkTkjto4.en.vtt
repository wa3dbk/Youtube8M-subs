00:00:05.429 --> 00:00:05.439 
hello this will be a tutorial on solving

00:00:05.439 --> 00:00:07.349 
hello this will be a tutorial on solving
the<00:00:05.710> three<00:00:05.920> by<00:00:06.069> three<00:00:06.310> edges<00:00:06.640> blindfolded

00:00:07.349 --> 00:00:07.359 
the three by three edges blindfolded

00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:10.230 
the three by three edges blindfolded
using<00:00:07.930> the<00:00:08.080> turbo<00:00:08.290> method<00:00:08.889> it's<00:00:09.610> quite<00:00:09.910> finger

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:10.240 
using the turbo method it's quite finger

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:11.970 
using the turbo method it's quite finger
trick<00:00:10.420> friendly<00:00:10.780> and<00:00:10.990> pretty<00:00:11.289> efficient<00:00:11.830> too

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:11.980 
trick friendly and pretty efficient too

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:14.490 
trick friendly and pretty efficient too
in<00:00:12.190> my<00:00:13.000> opinion<00:00:13.449> it's<00:00:13.629> a<00:00:13.719> good<00:00:13.900> stepping<00:00:14.170> stone

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:14.500 
in my opinion it's a good stepping stone

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.410 
in my opinion it's a good stepping stone
towards<00:00:14.830> moving<00:00:15.190> on<00:00:15.340> to<00:00:15.520> a<00:00:15.549> more<00:00:15.820> advanced

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:16.420 
towards moving on to a more advanced

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:18.990 
towards moving on to a more advanced
speed<00:00:16.779> optimized<00:00:17.230> approach<00:00:17.619> the<00:00:18.580> reason<00:00:18.880> I

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:19.000 
speed optimized approach the reason I

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.060 
speed optimized approach the reason I
say<00:00:19.210> this<00:00:19.240> is<00:00:19.480> because<00:00:20.109> there's<00:00:20.470> a<00:00:20.560> lot<00:00:20.769> of<00:00:20.919> age

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:21.070 
say this is because there's a lot of age

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:23.489 
say this is because there's a lot of age
cycles<00:00:21.669> where<00:00:21.820> turbo<00:00:22.150> is<00:00:22.449> actually<00:00:23.019> the

00:00:23.489 --> 00:00:23.499 
cycles where turbo is actually the

00:00:23.499 --> 00:00:26.279 
cycles where turbo is actually the
fastest<00:00:24.070> solution<00:00:24.630> so<00:00:25.630> if<00:00:25.749> you<00:00:25.900> decide<00:00:26.259> to

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:26.289 
fastest solution so if you decide to

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:29.009 
fastest solution so if you decide to

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:29.019 
line the speed optimized algorithms you

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:31.050 
line the speed optimized algorithms you
will<00:00:29.140> discover<00:00:29.589> turbo<00:00:30.159> has<00:00:30.339> given<00:00:30.640> you<00:00:30.730> a<00:00:30.759> head

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:31.060 
will discover turbo has given you a head

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:31.589 
will discover turbo has given you a head

and what applies to any case is if you

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:35.790 
and what applies to any case is if you
can't<00:00:34.390> think<00:00:34.630> of<00:00:34.810> the<00:00:34.990> speed<00:00:35.290> optimal

can't think of the speed optimal
solution<00:00:36.730> you<00:00:36.880> can<00:00:37.510> just<00:00:37.690> use<00:00:37.810> turbo<00:00:38.170> to<00:00:38.260> solve

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:38.530

it<00:00:38.680> and<00:00:38.860> it<00:00:38.950> really<00:00:39.250> won't<00:00:39.490> add<00:00:39.700> a<00:00:39.730> great<00:00:40.030> deal

targets<00:02:09.399> are<00:02:09.550> set<00:02:09.670> up<00:02:09.849> as<00:02:10.060> long<00:02:10.899> as<00:02:10.929> they're<00:02:11.530> in

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
targets are set up as long as they're in

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.130 
targets are set up as long as they're in
the<00:02:11.739> vicinity<00:02:12.040> of<00:02:12.459> these<00:02:13.090> two<00:02:13.420> blank<00:02:13.720> edges

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
the vicinity of these two blank edges

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:15.540 
the vicinity of these two blank edges
you're<00:02:14.590> going<00:02:14.830> to<00:02:14.950> be<00:02:15.040> fine

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
you're going to be fine

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.510 
you're going to be fine
once<00:02:16.360> you<00:02:16.480> have<00:02:16.600> the<00:02:16.780> two<00:02:16.960> targets<00:02:17.230> set<00:02:17.650> up<00:02:17.830> you

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
once you have the two targets set up you

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.430 
once you have the two targets set up you
must<00:02:18.700> use<00:02:18.940> one<00:02:19.150> of<00:02:19.270> eight<00:02:19.480> algorithms<00:02:20.230> to

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
must use one of eight algorithms to

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.440 
must use one of eight algorithms to
solve<00:02:20.650> the<00:02:21.010> case<00:02:21.190> then<00:02:21.820> of<00:02:21.970> course<00:02:22.180> you<00:02:22.300> need

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
solve the case then of course you need

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.120 
solve the case then of course you need
to<00:02:22.480> undo<00:02:22.810> the<00:02:22.960> setup<00:02:23.290> moves<00:02:23.590> which<00:02:23.890> you<00:02:23.980> made

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
to undo the setup moves which you made

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.060 
to undo the setup moves which you made
at<00:02:24.220> the<00:02:24.310> start<00:02:24.610> so<00:02:25.450> turbo<00:02:26.170> uses<00:02:26.470> LL<00:02:26.920> to

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.070 
at the start so turbo uses LL to

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:29.280 
at the start so turbo uses LL to
essentially<00:02:27.490> solve<00:02:27.760> the<00:02:28.060> edges<00:02:28.420> using<00:02:28.630> u<00:02:29.050> pubs

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
essentially solve the edges using u pubs

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.260 
essentially solve the edges using u pubs
without<00:02:30.010> having<00:02:30.370> to<00:02:30.520> stress<00:02:30.850> over<00:02:31.030> the

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
without having to stress over the

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:35.250 
without having to stress over the
orientation<00:02:33.060> now<00:02:34.060> I'll<00:02:34.300> show<00:02:34.540> you<00:02:34.600> show<00:02:35.080> you<00:02:35.110> a

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
orientation now I'll show you show you a

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.500 
orientation now I'll show you show you a
very<00:02:35.650> simple<00:02:35.890> example<00:02:36.130> to<00:02:36.640> give<00:02:37.000> you<00:02:37.090> an<00:02:37.180> idea

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
very simple example to give you an idea

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:43.650 
very simple example to give you an idea
of<00:02:37.720> what<00:02:38.080> it's<00:02:38.230> all<00:02:38.350> about<00:02:38.380> now<00:02:42.330> the<00:02:43.330> very

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
of what it's all about now the very

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.540 
of what it's all about now the very
first<00:02:43.930> thing<00:02:44.230> we<00:02:44.530> need<00:02:44.800> to<00:02:44.830> determine<00:02:45.190> is

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550 
first thing we need to determine is

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:48.450 
first thing we need to determine is
which<00:02:46.090> pieces<00:02:46.360> need<00:02:46.660> to<00:02:46.690> be<00:02:46.780> cycled<00:02:47.460> obviously

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:48.460 
which pieces need to be cycled obviously

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:52.530 
which pieces need to be cycled obviously
in<00:02:48.810> this<00:02:49.810> example<00:02:50.200> we<00:02:50.500> have<00:02:50.530> u<00:02:51.160> f2<00:02:51.670> Bo

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
in this example we have u f2 Bo

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:57.900 
in this example we have u f2 Bo
-<00:02:53.140> you<00:02:53.320> are<00:02:55.500> then<00:02:56.530> we<00:02:56.830> must<00:02:57.040> set<00:02:57.400> the<00:02:57.520> targets

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
- you are then we must set the targets

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.380 
- you are then we must set the targets
into<00:02:58.150> the<00:02:58.360> EULA<00:02:58.750> on<00:02:58.960> each<00:02:59.380> side<00:02:59.740> of<00:02:59.920> the<00:02:59.980> buffer

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
into the EULA on each side of the buffer

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:04.290 
into the EULA on each side of the buffer
now<00:03:01.390> you<00:03:02.080> are<00:03:02.290> obviously<00:03:03.250> already<00:03:03.550> occupies

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:04.300 
now you are obviously already occupies

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:09.630 
now you are obviously already occupies
one<00:03:04.600> of<00:03:05.080> these<00:03:05.230> four<00:03:05.710> spots<00:03:06.070> as<00:03:06.780> for<00:03:07.780> BL<00:03:08.640> look

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
one of these four spots as for BL look

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.320 
one of these four spots as for BL look
what<00:03:09.820> happens<00:03:10.180> when<00:03:10.570> I<00:03:10.600> do<00:03:10.720> an<00:03:10.930> L<00:03:11.110> move<00:03:12.330> the

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:13.330 
what happens when I do an L move the

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:18.900 
what happens when I do an L move the
cycle<00:03:13.750> now<00:03:13.870> becomes<00:03:14.260> u<00:03:15.250> f2<00:03:15.820> u<00:03:16.480> l2<00:03:16.960> you<00:03:17.740> are<00:03:17.920> this

I'm<00:03:25.180> now<00:03:25.570> going<00:03:25.780> to<00:03:25.900> finish<00:03:26.230> this<00:03:26.560> cycle<00:03:27.010> by

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:27.489 
I'm now going to finish this cycle by

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:31.440 
I'm now going to finish this cycle by
and<00:03:27.640> doing<00:03:27.910> the<00:03:28.150> setup<00:03:28.390> move<00:03:29.670> thus<00:03:30.670> finishing

and doing the setup move thus finishing

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.949 
and doing the setup move thus finishing
the<00:03:31.780> conjugate<00:03:33.330> when<00:03:34.330> you're<00:03:34.480> ready<00:03:34.660> you<00:03:34.840> can

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 
the conjugate when you're ready you can

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:37.199 
the conjugate when you're ready you can
proceed<00:03:35.320> to<00:03:35.350> part<00:03:35.680> two<00:03:35.920> where<00:03:36.489> I'll<00:03:36.670> go<00:03:37.030> over

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:37.209 
proceed to part two where I'll go over

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:38.970 
proceed to part two where I'll go over
the<00:03:37.420> algorithms<00:03:38.020> which<00:03:38.320> are<00:03:38.410> very<00:03:38.650> easy<00:03:38.830> to
