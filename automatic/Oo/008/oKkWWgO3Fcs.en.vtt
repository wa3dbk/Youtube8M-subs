should be as soon as it's up get out the
next<00:00:47.790> thing<00:00:48.030> you<00:00:48.150> need<00:00:48.300> to<00:00:48.360> think<00:00:48.450> about<00:00:48.720> is

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
next thing you need to think about is

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.640 
next thing you need to think about is
your<00:00:49.530> toilet<00:00:50.030> every<00:00:51.030> flush<00:00:51.390> can<00:00:52.140> take<00:00:52.410> as<00:00:52.620> many

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:52.650 
your toilet every flush can take as many

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:55.550 
your toilet every flush can take as many
as<00:00:53.190> five<00:00:53.640> gallons<00:00:54.300> of<00:00:54.450> water<00:00:54.630> it's<00:00:54.990> a<00:00:55.079> lot<00:00:55.290> of

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:55.560 
as five gallons of water it's a lot of

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.370 
as five gallons of water it's a lot of
water<00:00:55.800> so<00:00:56.550> either<00:00:56.820> buy<00:00:57.510> low-flow<00:00:57.960> toilet

00:00:58.370 --> 00:00:58.380 
water so either buy low-flow toilet

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:01.220 
water so either buy low-flow toilet
which<00:00:58.590> can<00:00:58.770> be<00:00:58.860> very<00:00:59.040> expensive<00:00:59.370> or<00:01:00.050> fill<00:01:01.050> your

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230

toilet<00:01:01.530> with<00:01:01.620> rocks<00:01:01.829> sounds<00:01:02.760> a<00:01:02.790> little<00:01:02.970> weird

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
toilet with rocks sounds a little weird

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.299 
toilet with rocks sounds a little weird
I<00:01:03.360> know<00:01:03.390> but<00:01:03.570> if<00:01:04.019> you<00:01:04.409> fill<00:01:04.710> your<00:01:04.860> toilet<00:01:05.220> of

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
rocks or something that's substantial

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.440 
rocks or something that's substantial
you're<00:01:07.470> actually<00:01:07.649> trying<00:01:08.250> to<00:01:08.580> minimize<00:01:09.150> the

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
you're actually trying to minimize the

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.420 
you're actually trying to minimize the
amount<00:01:09.690> of<00:01:09.900> water<00:01:10.170> that<00:01:10.380> goes<00:01:11.010> through<00:01:11.310> your

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
amount of water that goes through your

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.010 
amount of water that goes through your
kind<00:01:11.610> of<00:01:11.700> you're<00:01:11.820> tricking<00:01:12.330> your<00:01:12.450> toilet<00:01:12.900> to

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
kind of you're tricking your toilet to

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.050 
kind of you're tricking your toilet to
think<00:01:13.260> that<00:01:13.470> it's<00:01:13.890> full<00:01:14.250> when<00:01:14.760> it's<00:01:14.909> really

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
think that it's full when it's really

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.760 
think that it's full when it's really
not<00:01:15.270> see<00:01:15.540> you<00:01:15.600> just<00:01:15.870> use<00:01:16.140> a<00:01:16.170> really<00:01:16.500> fighting

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
not see you just use a really fighting

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.590 
not see you just use a really fighting
milk<00:01:17.370> container<00:01:17.909> you<00:01:18.120> can<00:01:18.150> also<00:01:18.360> use<00:01:18.479> a

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
milk container you can also use a

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.690 
milk container you can also use a
plastic<00:01:18.810> bottle<00:01:19.140> if<00:01:19.409> you<00:01:19.549> accidentally<00:01:20.549> used

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
plastic bottle if you accidentally used

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:21.920 
plastic bottle if you accidentally used
a<00:01:20.820> plastic<00:01:21.000> bottle<00:01:21.360> it's<00:01:21.600> good<00:01:21.750> way<00:01:21.870> to

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
a plastic bottle it's good way to

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.469 
a plastic bottle it's good way to
recycle<00:01:22.260> it<00:01:22.530> fill<00:01:23.070> it<00:01:23.190> with<00:01:23.220> rocks<00:01:23.940> which<00:01:24.330> is

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
recycle it fill it with rocks which is

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.210 
recycle it fill it with rocks which is
really<00:01:24.659> just<00:01:24.870> for<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.200> weight<00:01:25.380> and<00:01:25.650> then<00:01:26.010> put

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
really just for the weight and then put

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.190 
really just for the weight and then put
it<00:01:26.310> in<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.520> cistern<00:01:26.940> takes<00:01:27.630> up<00:01:27.780> a<00:01:27.870> little<00:01:28.080> bit

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
it in the cistern takes up a little bit

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.270 
it in the cistern takes up a little bit
more<00:01:28.350> water<00:01:28.560> and<00:01:28.710> then<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:28.979> flesh<00:01:29.250> is

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
more water and then the flesh is

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.219 
more water and then the flesh is
minimized<00:01:29.850> to<00:01:30.240> about<00:01:30.450> two<00:01:30.659> gallons<00:01:30.780> of<00:01:31.049> water

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
minimized to about two gallons of water

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.410 
minimized to about two gallons of water
so<00:01:31.799> it's<00:01:32.040> a<00:01:32.130> really<00:01:32.370> easy<00:01:32.490> thing<00:01:32.970> just<00:01:33.210> make

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
so it's a really easy thing just make

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.240 
so it's a really easy thing just make
sure<00:01:33.570> that<00:01:33.600> you<00:01:33.750> don't<00:01:33.869> put<00:01:34.080> too<00:01:34.799> many<00:01:34.979> rocks

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250
