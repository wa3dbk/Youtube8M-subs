00:00:00.819 --> 00:00:04.350
 hello how welcome are you to computer types and beyond 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.350
 atomic essay carlos olvera 

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:12.519
 this time I have prepared a small life 

00:00:15.739 --> 00:00:19.590
 that shows the internal structure of hard drives, well 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:24.420
 the hard drives 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.010
 personal one of the nanin storage devices 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.750
 therefore in the world of computers in general 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.670
 whether it's the desktop pc type 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:41.580
 also in laptop equipment etcetera since if we remember is where it is stored 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:43.160
 The operating system 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.510
 which is nothing more or nothing less 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.060
 that the set of programs that allow to prepare the computer 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.740
 so that the user can use it interacting with her also this that 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:57.740
 all the information and data that are 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.150
 In certain processes it is very important to know how it works 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.830
 since a large percentage of the main streets that present the 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:07.830
 computers 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.980
 come from this storage device it should be mentioned that the 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:15.830
 internal structure of hard drives that similar in most cases 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:20.580
 it can change according to the brand to the capacity of the hard drive but 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.070
 practically the structure is the same and asked that you will observe 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.290
 port for educational purposes 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:29.790
 and the images and the recording 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.090
 they were taken from hard drives that showed some failure 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.060
 it is advisable not to open your hard drive in any case - that 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.700
 this no longer serves eight functions since the smallest particle of dust would leave 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.159
 unusable your disc there are advanced techniques of manipulation of discs 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:54.729
 hard especially in an area known as computer forensics where by 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:58.179
 extreme cases it becomes necessary to recover 

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:00.280
 the information or the data 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.420
 that such handling techniques were stored can be carried out already 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.729
 be physically replacing some of the components 

00:02:09.329 --> 00:02:14.739
 oo in other cases using specialized programs for the 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:17.099
 recovery this as we said 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:19.479
 only in extreme cases 

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:22.040
 of information retrieval 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.549
 on another occasion 

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:26.859
 I will demonstrate as much as its more thoroughly about the subject 

00:02:26.859 --> 00:02:29.859
 related to computer 

00:02:31.539 --> 00:02:32.379
 forensic 

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:34.739
 the physical structure of a hard disk 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:38.439
 It is composed mainly of the following parts 

00:02:41.669 --> 00:02:46.569
 a high-strength cabinet that is not in most cases aluminum or 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:47.749
 solid metal 

00:02:47.749 --> 00:02:50.749
 closed to the void also against 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:57.239
 We have an electronic control circuit card that includes a 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:58.120
 Interface 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.850
 with the hill computer a chip used as cache memory we counted 

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:05.849
 with the horns 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:10.239
 1 ovalle or your hard drives 

00:03:12.369 --> 00:03:13.249
 known 

00:03:13.249 --> 00:03:17.549
 like porcelain or glass metal plates and that coated 

00:03:20.339 --> 00:03:24.189
 after a thin magnetic film a block of arms 

00:03:24.189 --> 00:03:27.189
 and in each hug in 

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:32.339
 the tip a read and write head 

00:03:32.339 --> 00:03:35.339
 preamplifiers with food stocks 

00:03:37.869 --> 00:03:42.809
 electrical management in case of hard disks hyde ata and it's cooking and in 

00:03:42.809 --> 00:03:44.869
 the case of hard drives of the cto 

00:03:44.869 --> 00:03:48.159
 this connection is integrated into the same cable to communicate 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:54.320
 we also have a bus connection 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:57.320
 a configuration block 

00:03:58.869 --> 00:04:00.259
 deion pesos 

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:03.929
 a bag that contains gel to prevent moisture 

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:07.980
 internal 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:11.760
 of the disc and good all this fixed and screwed 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:18.989
 moment that we turn on our computer the hard drive enter 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:21.329
 function in a known process 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:25.340
 as the system start the coils come into operation 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:28.340
 making the axes move 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.830
 the central axis that is where the plates are mounted 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:36.830
 can still rotate 

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:41.280
 Speed ​​of 7200 Naomi 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.280
 ten thousand 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:46.460
 15 thousand 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:51.470
 revolutions per minute another of the axes that is the one that holds that the block 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:56.560
 arms where they were found we said that at the end the reading heads and 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:01.280
 writing when starting the hard drive the block of arms is 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:06.380
 resting on one of the ends and when entering functions the block begins to 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:08.480
 move from the outside 

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:09.789
 dishes 

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:13.909
 so to the internal part looking for the required information the block 

00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:18.639
 another two moves in a uniform way that is to say all at the same time back 

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:20.680
 reading and writing heads 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:25.430
 they never touch the surface of the disk they are still at a distance of three 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:28.760
 millions and more than a millimeter reading and writing 

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:33.280
 It is carried out by magnetism from the head and by the whole arm 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:36.199
 if you find a small filament that in turn 

00:05:36.199 --> 00:05:40.620
 p is connected to an amplifier that communicates with the circuit boards 

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:45.570
 where is the connection the time bus cable in some cases 

00:05:48.939 --> 00:05:54.009
 can be of type iv suitable equipment or scotland hard drive towards the 

00:05:56.819 --> 00:06:02.059
 motherboard next to this connector is the power connection 

00:06:04.819 --> 00:06:07.750
 jon tellería between these two is found 

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:12.270
 a set of yonkers that are manipulated when necessary, which 

00:06:15.029 --> 00:06:19.839
 fraction themes of a hard drive cook of units of small or you look good 

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:27.370
 I hope you have found this video useful where we are 30 large 

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:32.000
 traits how is the internal functioning of the same already in other deliveries 

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.380
 later criteria showing 

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:38.580
 other concepts that has to do with hard drives as is 

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:42.880
 connect more than one disk how the llomparts are manipulated 

00:06:42.879 --> 00:06:43.819
 we mentioned 

00:06:43.819 --> 00:06:48.849
 inside the video and is that I invite you to lose that of the next delivery yes
