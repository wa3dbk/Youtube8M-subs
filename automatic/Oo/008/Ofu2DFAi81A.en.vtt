00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
then you get to the when and when they

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.980 
then you get to the when and when they
put<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.290> hoppers<00:01:16.650> hit<00:01:16.890> and<00:01:17.280> you're<00:01:17.520> like<00:01:17.670> oh

what is that don't know so long story

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.609 
what is that don't know so long story
short<00:01:21.030> it's<00:01:21.390> good<00:01:21.570> for<00:01:21.780> like<00:01:21.810> full<00:01:22.290> auto

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619

basically when you watch those tutorials

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.350 
basically when you watch those tutorials
whenever<00:01:25.500> you<00:01:25.680> see<00:01:25.950> one<00:01:25.979> that<00:01:26.400> says<00:01:26.670> full<00:01:27.030> auto

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
whenever you see one that says full auto

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.890 
whenever you see one that says full auto
you<00:01:28.080> know<00:01:28.259> really<00:01:29.000> hopper<00:01:30.000> was<00:01:30.180> probably

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
you know really hopper was probably

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.960 
you know really hopper was probably
involved<00:01:31.590> you<00:01:31.710> know<00:01:31.860> most<00:01:32.189> of<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.430> time<00:01:32.610> don't

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
involved you know most of the time don't

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.230 
involved you know most of the time don't
don't<00:01:33.390> quote<00:01:33.630> me<00:01:33.810> on<00:01:33.840> it<00:01:34.340> but<00:01:35.340> so<00:01:35.820> basically

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
don't quote me on it but so basically

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.749 
don't quote me on it but so basically
hoppers<00:01:36.720> they<00:01:36.900> just<00:01:37.079> move<00:01:37.290> items<00:01:37.680> from<00:01:38.340> one<00:01:38.579> to

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
hoppers they just move items from one to

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.069 
hoppers they just move items from one to
the<00:01:38.850> other<00:01:38.880> they<00:01:39.210> have<00:01:39.360> an<00:01:39.479> inventory<00:01:39.750> of

that's<00:02:03.630> going<00:02:03.930> to<00:02:03.990> be<00:02:04.079> using<00:02:04.409> a<00:02:04.500> hopper<00:02:04.829> so<00:02:05.009> are

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
that's going to be using a hopper so are

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:09.109 
that's going to be using a hopper so are
we<00:02:05.729> gonna<00:02:05.969> get<00:02:06.240> hoppers<00:02:06.719> I<00:02:07.439> don't<00:02:08.250> know<00:02:08.369> I<00:02:08.759> can

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
we gonna get hoppers I don't know I can

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.699 
we gonna get hoppers I don't know I can
make<00:02:09.239> videos<00:02:09.569> all<00:02:09.780> day<00:02:09.959> about<00:02:10.110> what<00:02:10.379> I<00:02:10.410> think

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
make videos all day about what I think

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.950 
make videos all day about what I think
we're<00:02:10.860> gonna<00:02:10.950> get<00:02:11.190> into<00:02:11.370> u-17<00:02:12.120> but

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
we're gonna get into u-17 but

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.390 
we're gonna get into u-17 but
I'm<00:02:12.990> gonna<00:02:13.080> have<00:02:13.290> to<00:02:13.380> go<00:02:13.530> ahead<00:02:13.650> and<00:02:13.950> say<00:02:14.160> I

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
I'm gonna have to go ahead and say I

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.880 
I'm gonna have to go ahead and say I
don't<00:02:14.970> think<00:02:15.300> we're<00:02:15.510> gonna<00:02:15.570> get<00:02:15.810> into<00:02:16.020> you<00:02:16.170> 17

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
don't think we're gonna get into you 17

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.440 
don't think we're gonna get into you 17
we're<00:02:17.100> probably<00:02:17.490> gonna<00:02:17.730> get<00:02:17.970> it<00:02:18.090> down<00:02:18.270> the

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
we're probably gonna get it down the

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:19.970 
we're probably gonna get it down the
road<00:02:18.600> that<00:02:18.870> you<00:02:19.140> have<00:02:19.260> to<00:02:19.380> look<00:02:19.530> at<00:02:19.740> it<00:02:19.860> that's

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
road that you have to look at it that's

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.340 
road that you have to look at it that's
a<00:02:20.160> it's<00:02:20.760> a<00:02:20.910> real<00:02:21.090> big<00:02:21.300> change<00:02:21.600> in<00:02:21.810> the<00:02:21.960> I<00:02:22.170> guess

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
a it's a real big change in the I guess

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:23.750 
a it's a real big change in the I guess
in<00:02:22.500> the<00:02:22.590> programming<00:02:22.980> and<00:02:23.220> stuff<00:02:23.430> when<00:02:23.640> you

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
in the programming and stuff when you

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.330 
in the programming and stuff when you
start<00:02:24.090> moving<00:02:24.450> items<00:02:24.990> and<00:02:25.410> and<00:02:25.560> doing<00:02:26.190> all

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
start moving items and and doing all

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.800 
start moving items and and doing all
that<00:02:26.520> you<00:02:26.730> know<00:02:26.850> hopefully<00:02:27.330> maybe<00:02:27.480> they<00:02:27.660> have

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
that you know hopefully maybe they have

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.570 
that you know hopefully maybe they have
it<00:02:27.930> in<00:02:28.020> the<00:02:28.110> ps4<00:02:28.380> edition<00:02:28.920> when<00:02:29.040> it<00:02:29.160> comes<00:02:29.370> out

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
it in the ps4 edition when it comes out

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.120 
it in the ps4 edition when it comes out
and<00:02:29.610> that's<00:02:29.880> not<00:02:30.030> much<00:02:30.270> of<00:02:30.390> a<00:02:30.480> problem<00:02:30.930> but<00:02:31.130> but

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
and that's not much of a problem but but

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.220 
and that's not much of a problem but but
there<00:02:32.610> you<00:02:32.730> go<00:02:32.910> guys<00:02:33.210> anybody<00:02:33.840> who<00:02:33.930> didn't

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
there you go guys anybody who didn't

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:35.930 
there you go guys anybody who didn't
know<00:02:34.350> what<00:02:34.380> hoppers<00:02:34.830> are<00:02:35.010> hoppers<00:02:35.400> or<00:02:35.550> things

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
know what hoppers are hoppers or things

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.330 
know what hoppers are hoppers or things
that<00:02:36.150> move<00:02:36.360> things<00:02:36.630> item<00:02:37.290> items<00:02:37.770> into<00:02:38.100> storage

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
that move things item items into storage

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.100 
that move things item items into storage
so<00:02:38.580> like<00:02:38.760> you<00:02:38.910> could<00:02:39.060> put<00:02:39.270> it<00:02:39.390> into<00:02:39.510> a<00:02:39.690> chest

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
so like you could put it into a chest

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.950 
so like you could put it into a chest
into<00:02:40.710> a<00:02:41.070> minecart<00:02:41.820> with<00:02:42.120> a<00:02:42.150> chest<00:02:42.540> you<00:02:42.810> could

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:42.960 
into a minecart with a chest you could

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.620 
into a minecart with a chest you could
put<00:02:43.200> things<00:02:43.500> into<00:02:44.390> anything<00:02:45.390> with<00:02:45.540> the

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
put things into anything with the

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:50.900 
put things into anything with the
storage<00:02:45.990> even<00:02:46.220> for<00:02:47.220> it<00:02:47.370> in<00:02:47.580> essence<00:02:48.740> no<00:02:49.740> I<00:02:50.460> keep

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
storage even for it in essence no I keep

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.580 
storage even for it in essence no I keep
forgetting<00:02:51.330> the<00:02:51.390> name<00:02:51.570> of<00:02:51.720> them<00:02:51.810> you<00:02:52.440> could

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
forgetting the name of them you could

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.410 
forgetting the name of them you could
you<00:02:52.860> could<00:02:53.100> basically<00:02:53.340> anything<00:02:54.120> that<00:02:54.270> holds

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
you could basically anything that holds

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.450 
you could basically anything that holds
items<00:02:54.900> where<00:02:55.290> you<00:02:55.410> can<00:02:55.590> put<00:02:55.920> items<00:02:56.340> by

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:56.460 
items where you can put items by

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:58.760 
items where you can put items by
pressing<00:02:56.820> X<00:02:57.030> it<00:02:57.360> can<00:02:57.660> go<00:02:57.780> in<00:02:57.930> there<00:02:58.200> and<00:02:58.230> into

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770 
pressing X it can go in there and into

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:01.430 
pressing X it can go in there and into
that<00:02:58.920> container<00:02:59.340> so<00:02:59.930> like<00:03:00.930> I<00:03:01.050> said<00:03:01.260> hopefully

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
that container so like I said hopefully

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.620 
that container so like I said hopefully
we'll<00:03:01.860> get<00:03:01.980> we'll<00:03:02.730> get<00:03:02.850> some<00:03:03.090> soon<00:03:03.300> and

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
we'll get we'll get some soon and

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.810 
we'll get we'll get some soon and
because<00:03:04.230> those<00:03:04.500> are<00:03:04.680> really<00:03:04.950> a<00:03:05.040> key<00:03:05.340> element

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
because those are really a key element

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.700 
because those are really a key element
for<00:03:05.850> growing<00:03:06.240> when<00:03:06.600> it<00:03:06.720> comes<00:03:06.930> to<00:03:07.080> doing<00:03:07.350> big

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:07.710 
for growing when it comes to doing big

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:10.790 
for growing when it comes to doing big
tutorials<00:03:08.490> and<00:03:08.850> and<00:03:08.970> doing<00:03:09.570> big<00:03:09.870> full-auto

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
tutorials and and doing big full-auto

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.770 
tutorials and and doing big full-auto
farms<00:03:11.430> and<00:03:11.610> stuff<00:03:11.850> like<00:03:12.030> that<00:03:12.270> not<00:03:12.540> having

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
farms and stuff like that not having

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.960 
farms and stuff like that not having
hoppers<00:03:13.230> is<00:03:13.380> a<00:03:13.740> key<00:03:14.040> ingredient<00:03:14.190> that's<00:03:14.730> kind

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
hoppers is a key ingredient that's kind

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.750 
hoppers is a key ingredient that's kind
of<00:03:15.060> slowing<00:03:15.420> us<00:03:15.540> down<00:03:15.570> from<00:03:16.020> getting<00:03:16.290> that<00:03:16.760> so

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
of slowing us down from getting that so

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.490 
of slowing us down from getting that so
there<00:03:18.180> you<00:03:18.270> go<00:03:18.420> if<00:03:18.630> you<00:03:18.810> like<00:03:18.930> the<00:03:19.110> video<00:03:19.350> if

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
there you go if you like the video if

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:20.780 
there you go if you like the video if
you<00:03:19.560> found<00:03:19.800> it<00:03:19.950> informative<00:03:20.100> we<00:03:20.610> got

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
you found it informative we got

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.190 
you found it informative we got

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
something to say leave it down in the
