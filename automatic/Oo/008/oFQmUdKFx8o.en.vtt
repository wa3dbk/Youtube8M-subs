00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.030
 hello to all so today we get 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.730
 find for a new video so 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.870
 given gaga profile then this is the 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.910
 second I'm doing on my channel 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.010
 why since I saw a lot of 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.290
 people who were testing dec with 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.000
 cosmo maps the beaconer I'm not 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.060
 not why not create my own version 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.470
 with the extension cards so 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.340
 here we will start right away 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:25.410
 so first of all three guys so 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.699
 advantageous in a single copy but 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.740
 I told myself as and when 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.390
 time it was better to play it at 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:35.280
 you if I wanted to make myself a pure 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:38.280
 gallagher here are three magicians 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.750
 so that's the dec base card 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.360
 that's basically what 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.890
 operate and then if we have magician and 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.530
 fixed on the ground we can do tenit 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:50.670
 we want from our extranet 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:52.649
 here are two clerks so if we against 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.730
 for example a magician so we do 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.199
 the effect of the rivers so we can 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.719
 special summon another nation 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.969
 control a gain so we have the boc have 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.010
 effect wizard we go pass me 2x there 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.870
 with both indications for example 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.650
 so it's 100 but hey I think that 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:10.799
 two is enough then two Caesar 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.150
 guigard and embodied thus Caesar its effect 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.520
 so we can not attack if we 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.960
 control by our media and once not 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.299
 all one can convict amending the site 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.290
 in our graveyard kg levels and all 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.970
 the monsters gaga on the ground tu 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.860
 win the monster level 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.650
 so that allows health indicates if enough 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.570
 easily respect there so that makes us a 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.400
 little bit of defense and considering that he has 2002 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.869
 defense and who animate him at cabba for 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:35.400
 the surplus 4 it can be useful 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:37.170
 after three or four hours so saw 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:41.340
 we play a lot of magic in stockings 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:44.909
 the game without any worry two tomatoes 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.920
 mystic so saw when I so if she 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.079
 is fart ben we will seek self magician 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:54.509
 girl or 48 hours if we have 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:56.440
 need them for guide so in case 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.920
 we would not have much in there 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:02.800
 so sometimes it will pay a max and so that 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.630
 it's the little ludec pickaxe engine and 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:08.800
 then sometimes it can do more 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:09.790
 at a lot of cards 2 works so this 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.230
 which is strong is that it can change 

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:13.300
 its level so for example if we do 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.460
 its effect that we change its level we have 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:18.130
 magicians are at bompas the magician at 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:20.140
 level of work having finished xeed you 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.970
 that's it's strong and to finish with 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.860
 the lies throats lengths in front 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.360
 Timothée case and I see the Corsican is 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.550
 very strong sometimes it can save 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:30.010
 parts so that's it that makes us a 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:33.730
 total of 20 monster then we will spend 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:35.320
 magic then 3 gallega therefore sells it 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.810
 it's a swarm on a guy 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:39.520
 and if the monster that is equipped this 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.680
 card is used as material 6 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.480
 points vocation of love July 6 all 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.850
 excess on a field wins 300 attacks 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:50.470
 in addition so it's pretty strong it's a 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:51.820
 little bonus e2 galère so that if we 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.380
 when we actually got a map on 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:57.850
 the field their breasts on the ground 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:59.650
 here is a gaga pickaxe so times it's 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:01.570
 enough so the facts we ban 3 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:05.860
 we spoil many cemeteries and we 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:06.730
 card deck is pretty strong a 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:08.380
 reinforcement of the army 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:11.680
 so with that we are going to look for ourselves 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:14.110
 clerk garnd house and ar rahman 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.060
 control so what is strong with seven 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:18.730
 neighborhoods one can take control 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.920
 of an eleven the opponent and so down after 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.150
 we can make unique side with the manga 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.340
 opponents and for example if we have it 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:27.489
 magician one copy of my opponent 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:31.060
 and then here is x directly so that's 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:32.920
 strong a secret arsenal so for those 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.269
 who do not know the facts 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.160
 send a card from the top note day co 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:37.870
 cemetery and we will add a map 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.000
 magical equipment since his dec 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.620
 cemetery to our hand we can not 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.470
 normally invoke or lay this turn 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.460
 so it's up to these forces for example 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.950
 have nothing 

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:51.190
 we add inga revenge since noting 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:55.020
 than at the cemetery another me then 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:57.510
 two typhoons one spear a violent storm 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:59.650
 a darcos and harry board 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.930
 so this title all for the magics so 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:04.090
 it makes us 15 years so everything is 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:07.510
 to finish with the traps so the 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:11.740
 traps pretty basic warning dom-tom 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:14.890
 tribute strongly defended by his new 

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:15.280
 five traps in all be a check of 40 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:18.220
 cards 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:18.570
 now we'll go to the extra 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:22.480
 Dec 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:24.010
 so we have a mess mess so 

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:28.510
 that they invoke quite easily with 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:31.720
 Clerk of the fortnight but enough 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:32.890
 leyme went to leviathan yesterday so that 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.400
 it was for monsters in two and 

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:40.870
 three balls in the ranks card beads 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:44.050
 Shock Master Utopia Cowboys Here and For 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:44.790
 finish with the ranks 5 6 7 and 8 matches 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:50.080
 but too much trouble 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:52.170
 volkan north pull at this big eye the 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:55.810
 concerts two best friends we are 

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:58.420
