00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.179
 hayley be welcome to a new video 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:04.859
 tutorial on this occasion is to say what 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:06.720
 says the title so we started and very 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.940
 well as you can see I have a mouse 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.429
 which contains two additional buttons on 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.440
 button 3 and button 4 so very well 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.759
 we are going to configure the and very well for 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.640
 this we need from the application 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.020
 called x mouse button that we can not 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.539
 download from the description of this 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.490
 video on your official page the only thing that 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.680
 we should do is give the last 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.449
 version and will automatically start the 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.859
 download so very well once 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.689
 finished the download what are we going to 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.590
 do will be to run the application as 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:36.440
 next administrator I accept 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:39.809
 next now here we can select 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:42.140
 if we had previously this program 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.309
 the configuration that we had 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:47.610
 preset plus we can 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:50.160
 erase the chs the settings or be the 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:53.160
 configuration of this program if you 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.110
 we had before and I did not have any of 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.210
 these two so I'll leave you just like 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.520
 are now we give the next and 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.559
 We wait for the installation to finish 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.390
 now we mark this popcorn and if 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.970
 we want you to automatically start the 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.590
 program and that's how I give it finish and 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.320
 this page will open and automatically 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.750
 in the lower right part will open 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.270
 the programming I'm going to do is give you 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.820
 double click and very well the first thing that 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.650
 we will change the English language 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.680
 to Spanish 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.660
 espanyol accept apply to close and 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.210
 we must restart the application so that 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:30.180
 the language is now established the 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.030
 route of this program is this position 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.730
 high resolution program files 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:38.790
 enterprise here in this folder we open 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:42.570
 this as an administrator and if we go back to 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:46.970
 the lower right corner we will give 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.970
 notice that the program is open 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.620
 and that is also in Spanish very well 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.510
 this program works by layers every 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:56.510
 layer can be configured in a way 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:59.240
 different and you can create a shortcut to 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:01.100
 each layer filled to configuration then 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:04.820
 we go to quick keys and we can 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:08.420
 do that to switch from layer 1 to the 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:11.180
 layer 2 there is a shortcut and so on 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:13.730
 yes then let's focus on one 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.800
 single layer to explain and each time 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.050
 that you press a key of your 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:21.500
 mouse in this case I'm going to press the 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:24.170
 button 4 as you can see this part is 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.989
 Place a different color indicating 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:29.030
 that what they should configure would be this 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:32.330
 part if then let's say that I want 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:34.520
 externarle to this button instead of 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.860
 which is predetermined that in my case 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:39.620
 with this modes what it does is recharge 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:41.930
 the pages that now the panel 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.730
 control without then I would simply have 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.070
 to do that, give him to apply and 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:48.020
 when I hit that key automatically 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:50.830
 better I will open the control panel 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:52.780
 If then 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:55.480
 they are very observant they will have realized 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.850
 that here there are only actions of 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:01.150
 windows then what happens if I want 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:03.700
 assign for example instead of a 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:06.880
 specific command of windows a single 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:10.300
 key yes as is the case that I just 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:12.970
 I want it to be the 100 control key to 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:16.690
 a game then what we should do 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:20.050
 is to go down and go to simulated keys not 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:22.720
 defined we open it and here we must 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:25.270
 select with the key to choose this 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.190
 should be done in brackets as they are 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:31.209
 in all these examples what we should 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:33.030
 do is copy and paste and also 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:35.590
 select how you want it to be 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:38.110
 pressed like this on this occasion I'm going to 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:41.140
 use the third what he does is 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:44.260
 that while you are pressing that button 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:46.540
 basically switch to control without that 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:49.959
 would be everything I would give or that I would give 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:52.030
 apply and already that way I could play 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:54.400
 so let's try it in a game 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:57.310
 and very well I set the mode of this 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:04:00.069
 way because by using this shortcut in 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:02.200
 the mouse saved me having to come 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:05.200
 here and upload the skill or have to 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:07.450
 use the control tool plus the 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:09.400
 sing skill in this way this is 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:11.800
 it's much faster and if I'm in a 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.900
 confrontation 1 versus 1 will give me one 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:15.819
 great advantage then it works so 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:17.889
 what I do is press that button that 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:20.680
 was button 4 and then I selected the 

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:22.840
 skill that I wanted to climb and in this 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.970
 case is the one as you can see it was uploaded and 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:26.800
 because nothing else in this way works in 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:29.350
 all the games and you can 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.790
 set to your liking and then I hope that 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:34.200
 this videotutorials has served them 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:34.200
 have liked and until next time
