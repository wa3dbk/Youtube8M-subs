00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:06.210
 tell us the finished trailer like that 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:11.849
 the x tractor is a 50 quintals trailer 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:15.179
 of tare and 37 thousand euros it is a 6 liters 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:17.010
 events for 2 50 wide with the sun 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.800
 we have pulled aluminum shores 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.230
 off this machine from rayo and let's say 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:26.099
 of 140 quintals at the same identical 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:29.789
 logically frame has already been tried 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:31.560
 on the various resistances and we have brought 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.120
 practically only one more ace 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.680
 now we have led to the 200 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.030
 quintals as an advantage we have we have 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.739
 we call a tare machine 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:44.010
 overall 50 quintals with a capacity 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:46.289
 total useful 150 since we have one 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.020
 of the machines plus injuries on the market 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.480
 plus the circus request of 105 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.260
 his load unknown 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:57.079
 known certainly not the small one 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:59.000
 but here is the clarification decorates the 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:03.109
 italian machine dr 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.850
 come maulo see with me s'angelo look 

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:07.939
 because he wants changed zechariah 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:12.110
 yes, because we were still upset 

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:14.990
 37 thousand the first had hair before 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:19.009
 37 thousand euros a capella now after the 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:21.289
 view of frost price that is able to see if I 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:24.009
 industrial the possibility of mounting 

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:27.710
 both dual mode system with the 

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:29.210
 front system with the piston that gives us 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.340
 the steering angle in both forward and backward 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.830
 with the question then two connections on 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.560
 shooting or the electronic system that 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:38.390
 it can be mounted that he automatically yes 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.649
 can decide whether to have it blocked then 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.229
 while walking in front of a certain one 

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:44.569
 speed you can block or when 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:46.940
 it also goes into reverse and what it does follow 

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:49.610
 the tractor card automatically 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:51.500
 without you man deciding how to pack 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.619
 he automatically defensively defended him 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.750
 axles you hear at see tells us no 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:58.700
 that there is no arrive what part is one 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.009
 what done we say that on the price of 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.470
 37 thousand euros normal so we have the 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:04.780
 machine with two laps responds the 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.690
 pump 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:10.030
 independent and air braking 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:11.080
 logically the two socialists bystanders 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.459
 forward backward locking in 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.690
 then reverse when a true between 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:15.730
 gear locks from under the tractor 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.500
 hydraulic and hydraulic to the trailer 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.480
 and leaves behind fixed and instead this 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:22.180
 system months amadu almunia the dual mode 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.880
 with the system it is practically assembled 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:29.080
 a second piston in front of where 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:31.630
 the latter shall we go a second piston 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.980
 here with a plate then on the hook 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:36.130
 of the tractor will be hooked on 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:39.600
 trailer pull from the tractor plus plus a 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:42.600
 another trip the piston that random 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.600
 stretching 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:49.100
 liquidara broken no because of heaven 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.260
 sparky you shouldn't know what the fact says 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:59.960
 that if not the cleanest constitution e 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:03:03.200
 that this system is the choice is more 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:05.180
 clean and that we know that there is the bomb of 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.890
 graduation hydraulic motor creation a 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:08.930
 Raul pump held the services of the 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:11.090
 trailer practically having everything 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.410
 the oil therefore does not change with 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.360
 we the strangers on tractors 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:17.360
 then now with the rear changes like 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:20.980
 gift where oils are also worth 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:22.450
 always better to have his tones 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.280
 has attached to the 22-month hook 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:27.380
 distributors 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.880
 and he automatically 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:32.240
 Missed 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:33.500
 so how to send 42 to make 

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:34.940
 art motor travel engine 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.550
 clothes 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:49.510
 two are of the pawns from the in 

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:52.910
 this case is done when sandra da 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:04:00.120
 chivasso you look like the low mauro a 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:04:01.500
 moment why don't you put my hours 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:05.090
 logical 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.090
 it can also be done with the electronic system 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:13.200
 it seems to me to mean comfortable on everything yes 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:14.880
 because I no longer have just once 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.760
 no it is always a question of always one 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:20.270
 question of money and still mount one 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:24.180
 one vote electronic control unit 

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:26.670
 I tell the truth the life marcaccini 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:29.640
 marcacci answer this morchio if 

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:31.080
 the best this soon miss milano mi 

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:33.960
 unbalance this and trailers or more 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:38.910
 so clever we have here that 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:41.460
 it's twice what double is enough 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:44.270
 than that of Noval also being more 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:48.150
 light 15 m yes but I have a doubt 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:51.390
 wait then i can load it 150 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:53.220
 Guindani, however, are not brick 200 

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:56.160
 so I go out of range but I don't 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:05:06.480
 concerns the structure is law 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:10.310
 Marcaccini deputy holding but to make them 

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:10.310
 welded Marcaccini and from hard 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:25.200
 they finished great big will buy it 

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:31.560
 that's enough
