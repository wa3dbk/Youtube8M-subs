you throw at them afterwards it's

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.110 
you throw at them afterwards it's
useless

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
useless

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.030 
useless
so<00:00:39.210> you<00:00:39.300> want<00:00:39.420> to<00:00:39.480> keep<00:00:39.570> that<00:00:39.690> in<00:00:39.840> mind<00:00:40.110> when

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
so you want to keep that in mind when

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.799 
so you want to keep that in mind when
you're<00:00:41.219> going<00:00:41.430> to<00:00:41.579> be<00:00:41.700> picking<00:00:41.910> your<00:00:42.270> focus

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
you're going to be picking your focus

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.459 
you're going to be picking your focus
the<00:00:43.230> weapon<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:44.160> Rings<00:00:44.430> and<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:45.059> necklace

00:00:45.459 --> 00:00:45.469 
the weapon the Rings and the necklace

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:50.930 
the weapon the Rings and the necklace
what<00:00:46.469> I<00:00:46.590> suggest<00:00:47.340> is<00:00:48.980> focus<00:00:49.980> on<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.250> focus<00:00:50.640> if

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
what I suggest is focus on the focus if

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.500 
what I suggest is focus on the focus if
you<00:00:51.180> might<00:00:51.469> and<00:00:52.469> just<00:00:53.039> buff<00:00:53.579> all<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:54.090> critical

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
you might and just buff all the critical

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.860 
you might and just buff all the critical
hit<00:00:54.750> damage<00:00:55.699> right<00:00:56.699> away<00:00:57.030> on<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.239> focus<00:00:57.629> so

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
hit damage right away on the focus so

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.049 
hit damage right away on the focus so
that<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:58.649> rest<00:00:58.890> of<00:00:59.039> your<00:00:59.160> items<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.670> weapon

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
that the rest of your items the weapon

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.139 
that the rest of your items the weapon
the<00:01:00.239> rings<00:01:00.420> of<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.629> necklaces<00:01:01.460> can<00:01:02.460> focus<00:01:02.850> on

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
the rings of the necklaces can focus on

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.719 
the rings of the necklaces can focus on
other<00:01:03.300> items<00:01:03.809> like<00:01:04.080> attack<00:01:04.439> speed<00:01:04.860> critical

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
other items like attack speed critical

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.010 
other items like attack speed critical
hits<00:01:06.270> chance<00:01:07.110> or<00:01:07.979> maybe<00:01:08.520> roll<00:01:09.180> a<00:01:09.210> socket<00:01:09.570> and

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
this focus I already have really high

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.899 
this focus I already have really high
means<00:01:50.790> that<00:01:51.049> 745<00:01:52.049> intelligence<00:01:52.619> so<00:01:53.159> I<00:01:53.189> rolled

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
means that 745 intelligence so I rolled

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.240 
means that 745 intelligence so I rolled
one<00:01:54.600> of<00:01:54.689> the<00:01:54.780> other<00:01:54.899> stats<00:01:55.259> into<00:01:55.590> critical<00:01:56.100> hit

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
one of the other stats into critical hit

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.240 
one of the other stats into critical hit
damage<00:01:56.280> I<00:01:56.909> got<00:01:57.450> up<00:01:57.540> to<00:01:57.659> 99<00:01:58.020> percent<00:01:58.049> so<00:01:59.040> now<00:01:59.189> we

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
damage I got up to 99 percent so now we

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.730 
damage I got up to 99 percent so now we
are<00:01:59.790> pretty<00:02:00.210> much<00:02:00.360> capped<00:02:00.869> at<00:02:01.170> critical<00:02:01.590> hit

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740

are pretty much capped at critical hit
damage<00:02:01.770> that<00:02:02.579> means<00:02:02.759> that<00:02:02.909> I<00:02:03.030> don't<00:02:03.180> have<00:02:03.329> to

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
damage that means that I don't have to

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.030 
damage that means that I don't have to
worry<00:02:03.600> about<00:02:03.659> critical<00:02:04.229> eye<00:02:04.350> damage<00:02:04.590> when<00:02:05.009> I

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
worry about critical eye damage when I

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.340 
worry about critical eye damage when I

better<00:02:18.210> what<00:02:19.170> you<00:02:19.320> want<00:02:19.470> is<00:02:19.710> high<00:02:19.980> means<00:02:20.250> that

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
better what you want is high means that

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.300 
better what you want is high means that
I<00:02:20.760> have<00:02:20.910> 11:25<00:02:21.300> I<00:02:22.230> believe<00:02:22.920> that's<00:02:23.190> the

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
I have 11:25 I believe that's the

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:24.980 
I have 11:25 I believe that's the
highest<00:02:23.580> I<00:02:23.880> just<00:02:24.030> got<00:02:24.150> really<00:02:24.300> lucky<00:02:24.570> on<00:02:24.750> that

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
highest I just got really lucky on that

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:27.500 
highest I just got really lucky on that
damn<00:02:25.800> percent<00:02:26.310> damages<00:02:26.820> really<00:02:27.090> good<00:02:27.300> or

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
damn percent damages really good or

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.110 
damn percent damages really good or
attack<00:02:27.960> speed<00:02:28.290> is<00:02:28.470> also<00:02:28.830> really<00:02:29.580> good<00:02:29.820> and

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
attack speed is also really good and

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.330 
attack speed is also really good and
which<00:02:31.050> one<00:02:31.290> to<00:02:31.320> do<00:02:31.590> is<00:02:31.740> you<00:02:31.830> want<00:02:31.980> to<00:02:32.040> roll<00:02:32.310> a

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
which one to do is you want to roll a

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.390 
which one to do is you want to roll a
socket<00:02:32.760> and<00:02:33.150> put<00:02:33.870> damage<00:02:34.440> in<00:02:34.620> there<00:02:34.800> okay

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
socket and put damage in there okay

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.430 
socket and put damage in there okay
again<00:02:35.730> critical<00:02:36.120> hit<00:02:36.390> damage<00:02:36.420> it's<00:02:37.110> useless

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
again critical hit damage it's useless

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.470 
again critical hit damage it's useless
at<00:02:37.680> this<00:02:37.710> point<00:02:38.130> so<00:02:38.700> there's<00:02:38.880> no<00:02:39.060> reason<00:02:39.450> to

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
at this point so there's no reason to

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.570 
at this point so there's no reason to
put<00:02:39.690> an<00:02:39.780> emerald<00:02:40.140> in<00:02:40.290> there<00:02:40.470> so<00:02:41.040> just<00:02:41.310> throw<00:02:41.550> a

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
put an emerald in there so just throw a

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:42.440 
put an emerald in there so just throw a
right<00:02:41.850> Jim

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
right Jim

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.140 
right Jim
I<00:02:42.480> have<00:02:42.840> 270<00:02:43.740> damage<00:02:44.100> that<00:02:44.580> boosts<00:02:44.970> it<00:02:45.030> up

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
I have 270 damage that boosts it up

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.140 
I have 270 damage that boosts it up
quite<00:02:45.390> nicely<00:02:46.160> after<00:02:47.160> that<00:02:47.640> we're<00:02:47.880> gonna<00:02:47.940> go

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
quite nicely after that we're gonna go

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.590 
quite nicely after that we're gonna go
for<00:02:48.330> the<00:02:48.360> neck<00:02:49.430> for<00:02:50.430> the<00:02:50.580> neck<00:02:50.760> piece<00:02:51.060> which

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
for the neck for the neck piece which

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.760 
for the neck for the neck piece which
you<00:02:51.750> want<00:02:52.050> to<00:02:52.170> have<00:02:52.470> is<00:02:53.090> damage<00:02:54.770> intelligence

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 
you want to have is damage intelligence

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:00.320 
you want to have is damage intelligence
or<00:02:56.070> main<00:02:56.490> stack<00:02:57.050> critical<00:02:58.050> hit<00:02:58.290> chance<00:02:59.330> or

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
or main stack critical hit chance or

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.470 
or main stack critical hit chance or
attack<00:03:00.960> power<00:03:01.320> and<00:03:01.880> you<00:03:02.880> want<00:03:03.120> to<00:03:03.270> roll<00:03:03.450> a

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
attack power and you want to roll a

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.990 
attack power and you want to roll a
socket<00:03:04.110> okay<00:03:04.590> I've<00:03:05.040> tested<00:03:05.400> these<00:03:05.520> things<00:03:05.790> out

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
socket okay I've tested these things out

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.870 
socket okay I've tested these things out
and<00:03:06.380> socket<00:03:07.380> is<00:03:07.530> by<00:03:07.890> far<00:03:08.190> the<00:03:08.400> best<00:03:08.610> thing<00:03:08.700> you

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
and socket is by far the best thing you

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.900 
and socket is by far the best thing you
can<00:03:09.030> do<00:03:09.150> on<00:03:09.420> either<00:03:09.690> the<00:03:10.110> fingers<00:03:10.590> or<00:03:11.430> the<00:03:11.700> neck

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
can do on either the fingers or the neck

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.300 
can do on either the fingers or the neck
so<00:03:12.420> you<00:03:12.480> wanna<00:03:12.720> roll<00:03:12.870> the<00:03:12.900> socket<00:03:13.380> throw<00:03:13.950> a<00:03:13.980> gem

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
so you wanna roll the socket throw a gem

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.060 
so you wanna roll the socket throw a gem
in<00:03:14.520> there<00:03:14.760> and<00:03:14.970> boom<00:03:15.600> it's<00:03:16.260> as<00:03:16.680> good<00:03:16.830> as<00:03:16.980> it

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
in there and boom it's as good as it

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:18.110 
in there and boom it's as good as it
gets

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
gets

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.949 
gets
after<00:03:18.780> that<00:03:18.959> I<00:03:19.350> have<00:03:19.620> another<00:03:19.890> ring<00:03:20.660> same<00:03:21.660> deal

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
after that I have another ring same deal

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:25.850 
after that I have another ring same deal
you<00:03:22.200> want<00:03:22.530> damage<00:03:23.130> main<00:03:23.880> stack<00:03:24.500> attack<00:03:25.500> speed

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
you want damage main stack attack speed

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:30.320 
you want damage main stack attack speed
critical<00:03:26.459> hit<00:03:26.640> chance<00:03:27.739> and<00:03:28.739> a<00:03:28.950> socket<00:03:29.400> so<00:03:29.820> this

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.330 
critical hit chance and a socket so this

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.960 
critical hit chance and a socket so this
one<00:03:30.480> just<00:03:30.510> happens<00:03:30.989> to<00:03:31.080> have<00:03:31.170> attack<00:03:31.560> speed<00:03:31.970> so

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
one just happens to have attack speed so

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:39.949 
one just happens to have attack speed so
I<00:03:33.420> rewrote<00:03:34.020> my<00:03:34.440> for<00:03:35.040> stat<00:03:35.310> into<00:03:37.670> into<00:03:38.670> a<00:03:38.959> socket

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
I rewrote my for stat into into a socket

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:42.500 
I rewrote my for stat into into a socket
and<00:03:40.350> put<00:03:40.620> a<00:03:40.650> gem<00:03:40.890> in<00:03:41.040> there<00:03:41.160> and<00:03:41.400> that<00:03:42.330> worked

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
and put a gem in there and that worked

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:45.860 
and put a gem in there and that worked
out<00:03:42.690> really<00:03:42.900> well<00:03:43.020> I<00:03:43.410> did<00:03:43.830> some<00:03:44.070> testing<00:03:44.610> and<00:03:44.870> I

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
out really well I did some testing and I

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:48.080 
out really well I did some testing and I
did<00:03:46.200> find<00:03:46.500> out<00:03:46.650> that<00:03:46.980> your<00:03:47.340> main<00:03:47.580> stack<00:03:47.880> is

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
did find out that your main stack is

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.199 
did find out that your main stack is
actually<00:03:48.480> worth<00:03:48.750> more<00:03:49.110> then<00:03:50.100> critical<00:03:50.580> hit

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
actually worth more then critical hit

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:54.830 
actually worth more then critical hit
chance<00:03:51.920> or<00:03:52.920> attack<00:03:53.340> speed<00:03:53.640> so<00:03:54.330> no<00:03:54.450> matter<00:03:54.630> how

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
chance or attack speed so no matter how

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.870 
chance or attack speed so no matter how
high<00:03:55.050> the<00:03:55.110> critical<00:03:55.680> hit<00:03:55.860> chances<00:03:56.489> no<00:03:56.730> matter

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
high the critical hit chances no matter

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.710 
high the critical hit chances no matter
how<00:03:57.060> high<00:03:57.300> the<00:03:57.739> the<00:03:58.739> attack<00:03:59.220> speed<00:03:59.430> is<00:03:59.720> regrow

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
how high the the attack speed is regrow

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.110 
how high the the attack speed is regrow
that<00:04:00.780> into<00:04:01.410> a<00:04:01.440> socket<00:04:01.800> and<00:04:02.160> throw<00:04:02.670> a<00:04:02.700> gem<00:04:02.970> in

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
that into a socket and throw a gem in

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.160 
that into a socket and throw a gem in
there<00:04:03.239> it'll<00:04:03.570> be<00:04:03.660> better<00:04:04.280> then<00:04:05.280> after<00:04:05.790> that<00:04:06.170> we

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
there it'll be better then after that we

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:10.090 
there it'll be better then after that we
have<00:04:07.320> the<00:04:07.350> other<00:04:07.560> ring<00:04:08.180> this<00:04:09.180> one<00:04:09.390> I<00:04:09.600> was

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:10.100 
have the other ring this one I was

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:12.949 
have the other ring this one I was
unable<00:04:11.100> to<00:04:11.160> reroll<00:04:12.090> the<00:04:12.360> critical<00:04:12.720> hit<00:04:12.930> chance
