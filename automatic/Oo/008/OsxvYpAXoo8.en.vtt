00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:15.580 
of 56 7 at 33 Hertz so we're gonna keep
testing<00:05:13.790> here<00:05:14.270> and<00:05:14.990> we'll<00:05:15.290> get<00:05:15.380> right<00:05:15.530> back

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:15.590 
testing here and we'll get right back

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:17.920 
testing here and we'll get right back
with<00:05:15.919> you<00:05:16.010> I'm<00:05:16.070> gonna<00:05:16.160> try<00:05:16.370> on<00:05:16.520> the<00:05:16.580> kick<00:05:16.930> open

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:17.930 
with you I'm gonna try on the kick open

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:21.450 
with you I'm gonna try on the kick open
it<00:05:18.020> for<00:05:18.110> a<00:05:18.139> 59<00:05:18.970> well<00:05:19.970> I<00:05:20.000> got<00:05:20.240> to<00:05:20.360> say<00:05:20.510> something

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:21.460 
it for a 59 well I got to say something

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:23.590 
it for a 59 well I got to say something
my<00:05:22.460> voltage<00:05:22.760> that<00:05:22.880> stuff's<00:05:23.120> holding<00:05:23.449> up<00:05:23.510> a

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:23.600 
my voltage that stuff's holding up a

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:24.820 
my voltage that stuff's holding up a
little<00:05:23.750> bit<00:05:23.900> better<00:05:24.050> with<00:05:24.229> the<00:05:24.260> excess<00:05:24.620> power

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:24.830 
little bit better with the excess power

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:26.620 
little bit better with the excess power
in<00:05:25.130> there<00:05:25.340> I<00:05:25.550> know<00:05:26.090> that<00:05:26.180> that's<00:05:26.449> going<00:05:26.570> to

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:26.630 
in there I know that that's going to

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:27.820 
in there I know that that's going to
make<00:05:26.780> a<00:05:26.810> big<00:05:27.020> difference<00:05:27.169> you<00:05:27.440> know<00:05:27.590> when<00:05:27.740> it

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:27.830 
make a big difference you know when it

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:32.200 
make a big difference you know when it
comes<00:05:27.979> down<00:05:28.160> to<00:05:28.220> the<00:05:28.430> to<00:05:29.150> the<00:05:29.290> Full<00:05:30.290> Tilt<00:05:31.210> power

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:32.210 
comes down to the to the Full Tilt power

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:34.360 
comes down to the to the Full Tilt power
this<00:05:32.540> thing<00:05:32.800> went<00:05:33.800> back<00:05:33.949> through<00:05:34.160> and<00:05:34.250> said

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:52.010 
stack like an outlaw style down in the

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:55.719 
stack like an outlaw style down in the
kick<00:05:52.190> so<00:05:53.120> I<00:05:53.150> have<00:05:53.389> gained<00:05:53.860> half<00:05:54.860> a<00:05:55.040> decibel<00:05:55.220> by

00:05:55.719 --> 00:05:55.729 
kick so I have gained half a decibel by

00:05:55.729 --> 00:05:57.400 
kick so I have gained half a decibel by
doing<00:05:56.030> the<00:05:56.120> dynamap<00:05:56.570> battery<00:05:57.110> swapping

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:57.410 
doing the dynamap battery swapping

00:05:57.410 --> 00:05:59.260 
doing the dynamap battery swapping
everything<00:05:57.770> else<00:05:57.919> just<00:05:58.580> cost<00:05:58.850> me<00:05:59.000> an<00:05:59.090> arm<00:05:59.150> and

00:05:59.260 --> 00:05:59.270 
everything else just cost me an arm and

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:01.810 
everything else just cost me an arm and
a<00:05:59.360> leg<00:05:59.389> to<00:05:59.630> do<00:05:59.720> it<00:05:59.810> all<00:05:59.960> but<00:06:00.200> I'm<00:06:01.039> in<00:06:01.190> fifty<00:06:01.639> nine

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:01.820 
a leg to do it all but I'm in fifty nine

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:04.629 
a leg to do it all but I'm in fifty nine
and<00:06:02.060> one<00:06:02.240> decimal<00:06:02.570> way<00:06:02.750> from<00:06:02.930> the<00:06:02.990> 160<00:06:03.590> I<00:06:03.770> am

00:06:04.629 --> 00:06:04.639 
and one decimal way from the 160 I am

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:06.860 
and one decimal way from the 160 I am
I'm<00:06:05.090> happy<00:06:05.419> as<00:06:05.479> hell

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:06.870 
I'm happy as hell

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:08.450 
I'm happy as hell
anyways<00:06:07.710> like<00:06:07.830> I<00:06:07.889> said<00:06:08.010> I'm<00:06:08.070> gonna<00:06:08.190> continue

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:08.460 
anyways like I said I'm gonna continue

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:10.310 
anyways like I said I'm gonna continue
to<00:06:08.610> test<00:06:08.880> I<00:06:09.210> think<00:06:09.660> that's<00:06:09.810> my<00:06:09.930> frequency

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:10.320 
to test I think that's my frequency

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:14.120 
to test I think that's my frequency
pretty<00:06:10.620> much<00:06:10.830> but<00:06:11.550> there<00:06:11.760> it<00:06:11.850> is<00:06:11.880> the<00:06:12.450> 59<00:06:13.130> get

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:14.130 
pretty much but there it is the 59 get

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:17.210 
pretty much but there it is the 59 get
that<00:06:14.280> on<00:06:14.460> film<00:06:15.260> same<00:06:16.260> set<00:06:16.440> up<00:06:16.530> I've<00:06:16.680> had<00:06:16.710> six

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:17.220 
that on film same set up I've had six

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:21.230 
that on film same set up I've had six
SMD<00:06:17.669> 18s<00:06:18.240> and<00:06:18.440> now<00:06:19.440> like<00:06:19.620> I<00:06:19.740> said<00:06:19.800> we<00:06:20.250> went<00:06:21.060> back

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:21.240 
SMD 18s and now like I said we went back

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:26.570 
SMD 18s and now like I said we went back
through<00:06:21.800> burning<00:06:22.800> the<00:06:22.950> XS<00:06:23.870> and<00:06:25.460> speakers<00:06:26.460> are

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:26.580 
through burning the XS and speakers are

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:28.730 
through burning the XS and speakers are
still<00:06:26.730> ice-cold<00:06:27.210> after<00:06:27.960> resetting<00:06:28.320> things<00:06:28.650> I

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:28.740 
still ice-cold after resetting things I

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:31.430 
still ice-cold after resetting things I
actually<00:06:28.830> turned<00:06:29.160> my<00:06:29.280> amplifiers<00:06:29.700> down<00:06:30.440> after

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:31.440 
actually turned my amplifiers down after

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:34.430 
actually turned my amplifiers down after
resetting<00:06:32.150> redoing<00:06:33.150> this<00:06:33.389> here<00:06:33.630> I<00:06:33.660> had

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:34.440 
resetting redoing this here I had

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:35.420 
resetting redoing this here I had
actually<00:06:34.710> turn<00:06:34.830> them<00:06:34.919> down<00:06:34.980> a<00:06:35.100> few<00:06:35.310> notches

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:35.430 
actually turn them down a few notches

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:37.580 
actually turn them down a few notches
and<00:06:36.270> you<00:06:36.870> know<00:06:36.960> they<00:06:37.050> were<00:06:37.139> starting<00:06:37.380> to<00:06:37.410> clip

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:37.590 
and you know they were starting to clip

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:38.770 
and you know they were starting to clip
a<00:06:37.620> little<00:06:37.710> bit<00:06:37.950> and<00:06:38.040> it<00:06:38.100> was<00:06:38.190> costing<00:06:38.370> me<00:06:38.580> so

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:38.780 
a little bit and it was costing me so

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:41.960 
a little bit and it was costing me so
there<00:06:39.780> it<00:06:39.870> is<00:06:39.990> the<00:06:40.740> 159<00:06:41.220> and<00:06:41.610> we'll<00:06:41.790> keep

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:41.970 
there it is the 159 and we'll keep

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:43.580 
there it is the 159 and we'll keep
taping<00:06:42.240> I'm<00:06:42.510> going<00:06:42.630> to<00:06:42.690> keep<00:06:42.840> on<00:06:42.990> testing<00:06:43.260> if<00:06:43.500> I

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:43.590 
taping I'm going to keep on testing if I

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:44.870 
taping I'm going to keep on testing if I
do<00:06:43.650> better<00:06:43.919> I'll<00:06:44.160> definitely<00:06:44.580> put<00:06:44.729> it<00:06:44.790> up

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:44.880 
do better I'll definitely put it up

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:46.670 
do better I'll definitely put it up
where<00:06:45.419> all<00:06:45.510> the<00:06:45.600> cops<00:06:45.840> haven't<00:06:46.200> showed<00:06:46.350> yet

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:46.680 
where all the cops haven't showed yet

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:48.350

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:50.480 
and I got a couple of these songs we got
this<00:06:48.510> down<00:06:48.720> on<00:06:48.840> the<00:06:48.900> kick<00:06:49.080> again<00:06:49.400> we're<00:06:50.400> gonna

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:50.490 
this down on the kick again we're gonna

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:51.830 
this down on the kick again we're gonna
see<00:06:50.669> what<00:06:50.760> this<00:06:50.880> bad<00:06:51.030> boy<00:06:51.210> will<00:06:51.360> do<00:06:51.479> howl<00:06:51.600> music
