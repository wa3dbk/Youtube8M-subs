00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
about cooking whole grains whole grains

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.120 
about cooking whole grains whole grains
cooked<00:00:09.450> just<00:00:09.809> the<00:00:09.990> way<00:00:10.139> you<00:00:10.200> would<00:00:10.559> cook<00:00:10.769> pasta

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
cooked just the way you would cook pasta

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.459 
cooked just the way you would cook pasta
or<00:00:11.700> white<00:00:11.940> rice<00:00:12.240> they<00:00:12.630> just<00:00:12.900> take<00:00:13.200> a<00:00:13.230> little

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
or white rice they just take a little

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.460 
or white rice they just take a little
longer<00:00:14.000> pasta<00:00:15.000> and<00:00:15.269> white<00:00:15.509> rice<00:00:15.750> are<00:00:16.020> made<00:00:16.260> out

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
longer pasta and white rice are made out

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.310 
longer pasta and white rice are made out
of<00:00:16.500> flour<00:00:17.039> or<00:00:17.430> grains<00:00:18.330> that<00:00:18.510> have<00:00:18.660> been<00:00:18.990> milled

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
of flour or grains that have been milled

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.310 
of flour or grains that have been milled
so<00:00:19.710> they<00:00:19.859> cook<00:00:20.130> quickly<00:00:20.510> whole<00:00:21.510> grains<00:00:21.930> are

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
so they cook quickly whole grains are

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.500 
so they cook quickly whole grains are
like<00:00:22.470> little<00:00:22.710> pellets<00:00:23.310> little<00:00:23.730> rocks<00:00:24.060> and

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
like little pellets little rocks and

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.120 
like little pellets little rocks and
they<00:00:24.630> take<00:00:24.869> a<00:00:24.900> long<00:00:25.140> time<00:00:25.410> to<00:00:25.470> cook<00:00:25.769> but<00:00:25.980> the

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
they take a long time to cook but the

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.609 
they take a long time to cook but the
process<00:00:26.400> is<00:00:26.670> just<00:00:27.150> the<00:00:27.300> same<00:00:27.539> you<00:00:28.109> put<00:00:28.439> your

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
process is just the same you put your

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:35.110 
process is just the same you put your
brains<00:00:29.039> into<00:00:29.730> a<00:00:29.760> pot<00:00:30.150> and<00:00:30.480> you<00:00:31.230> add<00:00:31.439> some<00:00:31.859> water

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:35.120 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.850 

in<00:00:36.120> this<00:00:36.270> case<00:00:36.630> I'm<00:00:36.899> cooking<00:00:37.260> a<00:00:37.350> pound<00:00:37.649> of

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
in this case I'm cooking a pound of

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.530 
in this case I'm cooking a pound of
whole<00:00:38.070> grains<00:00:38.430> which<00:00:38.760> is<00:00:38.940> two<00:00:39.180> and<00:00:39.300> a<00:00:39.360> half

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
whole grains which is two and a half

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.200 
whole grains which is two and a half
cups<00:00:39.570> and<00:00:40.170> I've<00:00:40.559> put<00:00:40.829> in<00:00:41.010> six<00:00:41.399> cups<00:00:41.700> of<00:00:41.910> water

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
cups and I've put in six cups of water

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.360 
cups and I've put in six cups of water
and<00:00:42.450> that's<00:00:42.570> pretty<00:00:42.870> standard<00:00:43.350> but<00:00:44.100> if<00:00:44.219> you

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
and that's pretty standard but if you

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.790 
and that's pretty standard but if you
have<00:00:44.670> more<00:00:45.120> water<00:00:45.480> you<00:00:45.719> just<00:00:45.750> drain<00:00:46.320> it<00:00:46.350> off<00:00:46.590> at

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
have more water you just drain it off at

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.130 
have more water you just drain it off at
the<00:00:46.920> end<00:00:47.100> as<00:00:47.430> you<00:00:47.640> would<00:00:47.820> drain<00:00:48.090> pasta<00:00:48.390> it

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
the end as you would drain pasta it

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.200 
the end as you would drain pasta it
doesn't<00:00:49.500> have<00:00:49.649> to<00:00:49.829> be<00:00:49.860> perfectly<00:00:50.460> absorbed

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
doesn't have to be perfectly absorbed

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.910 
doesn't have to be perfectly absorbed
the<00:00:51.329> way<00:00:51.480> you<00:00:51.539> may<00:00:51.809> be<00:00:51.870> used<00:00:52.170> to<00:00:52.260> cooking<00:00:52.559> white

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
the way you may be used to cooking white

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.049 
the way you may be used to cooking white
rice<00:00:53.190> now<00:00:53.879> I'm<00:00:54.149> going<00:00:54.329> to<00:00:54.420> also<00:00:54.600> add<00:00:55.020> a<00:00:56.059> little

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
rice now I'm going to also add a little

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.599 
rice now I'm going to also add a little
bit<00:00:57.300> of<00:00:57.360> bullion<00:00:57.980> just<00:00:58.980> to<00:00:59.100> add<00:00:59.129> a<00:00:59.280> little

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.549 
bit of bullion just to add a little
flavor<00:00:59.940> boost<00:01:00.300> you<00:01:00.539> don't<00:01:00.690> have<00:01:00.989> to<00:01:01.199> do<00:01:01.350> this

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
flavor boost you don't have to do this

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.429 
flavor boost you don't have to do this
but<00:01:01.829> if<00:01:01.949> you're<00:01:02.070> not<00:01:02.280> putting<00:01:02.640> bullion

00:01:03.429 --> 00:01:03.439 
but if you're not putting bullion

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:06.080 
but if you're not putting bullion
granules<00:01:04.439> or<00:01:04.680> cubes<00:01:05.100> or<00:01:05.400> paste<00:01:05.670> into<00:01:05.939> your

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
granules or cubes or paste into your

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.270 
granules or cubes or paste into your
water<00:01:06.420> put<00:01:06.930> in<00:01:07.049> a<00:01:07.170> little<00:01:07.350> bit<00:01:07.560> of<00:01:07.590> salt<00:01:07.979> it

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
water put in a little bit of salt it

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.420 
water put in a little bit of salt it
keeps<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:08.729> grains<00:01:09.000> from<00:01:09.330> tasting<00:01:09.810> flat<00:01:10.430> then

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
keeps the grains from tasting flat then

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:12.740 
keeps the grains from tasting flat then
you're<00:01:11.640> going<00:01:11.760> to<00:01:11.850> bring<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.240> water<00:01:12.420> to<00:01:12.570> a

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
you're going to bring the water to a

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.020 
you're going to bring the water to a
boil<00:01:14.060> and<00:01:15.060> then<00:01:16.490> you're<00:01:17.490> going<00:01:17.640> to<00:01:17.759> put<00:01:17.909> the

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
boil and then you're going to put the

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.460 
boil and then you're going to put the
lid<00:01:18.270> on<00:01:19.850> when<00:01:20.850> it<00:01:21.000> boils<00:01:21.270> you<00:01:21.840> turn<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.290> heat

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
lid on when it boils you turn the heat

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.920 
lid on when it boils you turn the heat
down<00:01:22.500> to<00:01:22.740> a<00:01:23.009> simmer<00:01:23.430> and<00:01:23.670> then<00:01:23.759> you<00:01:24.600> let<00:01:24.780> the

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
down to a simmer and then you let the

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.380 
down to a simmer and then you let the
grains<00:01:25.170> cook<00:01:25.650> for<00:01:26.040> about<00:01:26.130> 60<00:01:26.850> minutes<00:01:27.180> or

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
grains cook for about 60 minutes or

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.440 
grains cook for about 60 minutes or
until<00:01:27.420> they<00:01:27.960> are<00:01:27.990> soft<00:01:28.189> but<00:01:29.189> not<00:01:29.220> mushy<00:01:29.759> it's

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
until they are soft but not mushy it's

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.450 
until they are soft but not mushy it's
not<00:01:30.659> a<00:01:30.689> real<00:01:31.020> precise<00:01:31.619> amount<00:01:32.070> of<00:01:32.189> time

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
not a real precise amount of time

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.060 
not a real precise amount of time
because<00:01:32.759> some<00:01:33.210> grains<00:01:33.450> take<00:01:33.750> longer<00:01:34.140> and<00:01:34.500> some

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
because some grains take longer and some

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.280 
because some grains take longer and some
grains<00:01:35.310> take<00:01:35.610> a<00:01:35.640> little<00:01:35.939> less<00:01:36.150> but<00:01:36.630> generally

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
grains take a little less but generally

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.530 
grains take a little less but generally
about<00:01:37.619> an<00:01:37.829> hour<00:01:38.040> is<00:01:38.430> what<00:01:38.700> you<00:01:38.880> can<00:01:39.060> expect

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
about an hour is what you can expect

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.840 
about an hour is what you can expect
pasta<00:01:40.530> remember<00:01:41.009> takes<00:01:41.250> about<00:01:41.490> 10<00:01:41.820> minutes

white rice takes about 20 minutes so

white rice takes about 20 minutes so
these<00:01:45.119> whole<00:01:45.479> grains<00:01:45.810> do<00:01:46.170> take<00:01:46.439> significantly

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
these whole grains do take significantly

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.940 
these whole grains do take significantly
longer<00:01:47.600> but<00:01:48.600> when<00:01:49.079> they're<00:01:49.290> nice<00:01:49.470> and<00:01:49.710> chewy

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
longer but when they're nice and chewy

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.580 
longer but when they're nice and chewy
but<00:01:50.340> soft<00:01:50.759> they're<00:01:51.450> done<00:01:51.750> they're<00:01:52.229> ready<00:01:52.500> for

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
you to eat at that point you just drain

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.050 
you to eat at that point you just drain
off<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:54.990> water<00:01:55.140> and<00:01:55.680> they're<00:01:56.159> ready<00:01:56.399> to<00:01:56.520> serve
