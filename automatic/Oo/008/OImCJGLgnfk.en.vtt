00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
one of these before so hopefully it

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.040 
one of these before so hopefully it
turns<00:00:16.529> out<00:00:16.770> alright<00:00:16.949> but<00:00:17.460> if<00:00:17.910> you<00:00:18.539> can<00:00:18.869> hear

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
swab so sick brand and everything but

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.140 
swab so sick brand and everything but
this<00:02:49.440> one<00:02:49.650> is<00:02:49.769> in<00:02:49.800> the<00:02:50.040> ocean<00:02:50.519> breeze<00:02:50.790> and

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
this one is in the ocean breeze and

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.449 
this one is in the ocean breeze and
they're<00:02:51.959> in<00:02:52.110> same<00:02:52.350> price<00:02:52.680> but<00:02:52.950> this<00:02:53.130> one<00:02:53.370> is

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
they're in same price but this one is

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:55.729 
they're in same price but this one is
actually<00:02:53.700> this<00:02:54.570> new<00:02:54.840> one<00:02:55.019> is<00:02:55.050> actually<00:02:55.320> bigger

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
actually this new one is actually bigger

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:57.560 
actually this new one is actually bigger
so<00:02:56.040> I<00:02:56.310> think<00:02:56.640> it's<00:02:56.880> a<00:02:56.940> better<00:02:57.120> deal<00:02:57.360> obviously

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
so I think it's a better deal obviously

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.449 
so I think it's a better deal obviously
to<00:02:57.989> get<00:02:58.080> the<00:02:58.200> one<00:02:58.320> with<00:02:58.440> more<00:02:58.620> body<00:02:58.800> wash<00:02:59.100> in<00:02:59.370> it

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
to get the one with more body wash in it

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:01.490 
to get the one with more body wash in it
so<00:03:00.060> this<00:03:00.420> one<00:03:00.600> actually<00:03:00.690> smell<00:03:01.080> really<00:03:01.260> good

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500
