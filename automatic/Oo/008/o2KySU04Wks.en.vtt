00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:05.980
 hello very good to everyone in this video os 

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:09.200
 I'm going to do a detailed radio of 

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:14.349
 hs 980 license 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:14.349
 and let's start by opening the lid 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:22.420
 Well, we have already opened the lid here 

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:26.050
 we have the lid that is a normal lid 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:29.050
 let's remove it and well here we have the 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:31.390
 2500 milliamp battery that is 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:35.680
 Super good 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:37.780
 it is durable according to the data of the mobile 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.480
 because it lasts 5 hours if you use it 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:43.149
 constantly but good I'm going to 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.920
 tell you my practice that has been so 

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:47.970
 has lasted a whole day using 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.970
 a lot of time 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:53.690
 It's good if we do not use it long 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:57.100
 Well you can be two days well here 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:59.800
 we have the slot of the micro sd 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:02.079
 and here we have two hard ones for the 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.969
 micros and that one of two 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:05.930
 I am using one and used two and 

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:07.600
 it also works well 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:11.070
 of the 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.070
 and there we are going to return the afternoon 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:20.560
 here we have the 8 megapixel camera 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:22.630
 that now you will see images of the phone 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.899
 like that 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:27.930
 with 8 megapixels here is the flash and 

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:30.430
 here at the bottom we have 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:33.070
 the main speaker that is why 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:36.159
 we will listen to music here on this side 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:38.770
 we have two buttons or three of 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:41.710
 lock and shutdown and volume upload 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:43.540
 and lower down here because we have as 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:46.900
 you can see 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:49.750
 the telephone microphone in this part 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:52.420
 there is nothing good here 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:55.910
 this is the part of the screen there is 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:59.970
 the screen is big enough 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:03.870
 55 inch 2 megapixel camera 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:06.120
 races are more I think it puts practice 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:07.870
 you press but also the sensor 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:10.450
 lights 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:13.980
 and the speaker we'll talk to 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.980
 phone with which we will listen 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:19.730
 Well, we have already done mobile fado 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:22.670
 well as you can see then this is the 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:26.150
 screen the phone that has a 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:29.780
 quad-core processor of 25 is one of the 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:31.340
 fastest phones currently of the 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.580
 market in how can you see it is 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:37.390
 fast fluid pretty 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.390
 it's not me 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:45.740
 let's go to settings 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.480
 and we go to phone information well 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:49.460
 as many you asked me in the in the 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.620
 comments asking me if you could 

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:54.420
 update the terminal I say yes 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:57.480
 that can be updated but 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:59.640
 we are going to give the update will give us 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.620
 review the new version will review it and 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.200
 will tell us if we can download the one 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.970
 almost always is that if we will give 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:09.220
 download it will be more or less like 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:11.590
 five megabytes an update 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.910
 We will give you the best update there is 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.830
 update several times 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:17.480
 when improving each update does not change 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:20.130
 nothing but you have to give it many times 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.990
 until you update 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:23.380
 software version versions of 

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:28.170
 hardware 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:30.520
 Android version 4.2.1 what is 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.340
 It can 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:35.030
 to update 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.030
 is to live 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:45.470
 we are going to 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.470
 to storage 

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:52.860
 Well here is the storage to see 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:56.130
 in the internal memory it is 4 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:59.850
 gb is little too little that's the bad thing about 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:03.030
 this terminal but there are four exact 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:05.580
 because to use so we 're going to 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:09.150
 use us we only have 175 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:11.940
 although we can already extend this with the 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:15.000
 sd card and be able to put the gigas that 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:17.769
 we want with the sd card I already have 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.620
 two gigas then we are not 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:22.920
 there I have more than enough but the bad is the 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.980
 internal but good 

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:27.980
 all right 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:31.460
 let's go to the camera as I said 8 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:34.640
 megapixels and the photos that take these 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:37.840
 photos I miss them with my camera you can 

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:37.840
 see if it looks super good 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.889
 we can fold 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:51.860
 in landscape 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:57.540
 let's bring everything we want and 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:05:00.110
 it looks good just as good the quality changes 

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:00.110
 but I'ts not bad 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:07.460
 novella 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:07.460
 in the hisense box and one 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:15.160
 some have asked me also for 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:18.220
 the volume of the phone if jump if it is 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:22.320
 low as it is good I will show you the 

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:22.320
 volume is quite high 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:25.500
 even 

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:45.730
 good as you have seen then it is high to 

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:47.350
 the best you hear it a 

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:49.690
 little bit lower than reality but 

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:51.820
 because it's a recording is high even 

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:53.560
 when we wear headphones because we 

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:55.450
 they warn that we have the volume 

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:57.640
 quite high and if we raise it a little 

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:59.970
 more then it can be harmful to our 

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:59.970
 ears 

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:11.210
 as I have seen then 

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:14.840
 we as a memory for you 

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:16.250
 I said we have 4 GB of memory 

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:20.280
 internal memory of which we can 

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:23.070
 use only about 75 plus or minus 

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:26.720
 and we have the vanquish memory of a giga 

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:30.200
 on the screen 

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:32.710
 is a 720 navas screen has a 

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:35.150
 720 resolution 

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:38.120
 a wants 

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:40.450
 As you can see I suppose you will see well 

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:40.450
 well 

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:49.280
 and the camera has a resolution of 

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:51.680
 1080p is full hd who has that has 

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:54.650
 a big inconvenience but it also has 

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:57.590
 good parts as the photos are 

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:59.200
 very good as you have seen 

00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:02.940
 but 

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:05.880
 occupies enough space at the time 

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:09.480
 Photo storage and 

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:13.120
 videos a photo can get you to use 2 

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:16.830
 megas and that's enough for a photo 

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:20.350
 doing about 100 photos you can remove 

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:23.350
 enough memory 

00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:25.360
 and the videos is already pretty with five 

00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:29.310
 minutes of video then you can remove us 

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:31.560
 500 megabytes and even one turn is 

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:33.870
 For my part, that's one thing that has 

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:35.850
 that correct this was all many 

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:39.150
 Thanks for watching give the like 

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:40.760
 if you liked sharing it to grow 

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:43.310
 plus 

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:45.890

00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:47.480

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:52.070
 I answer immediately as soon as possible 

00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:55.060

00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:55.060
 goodbye video
