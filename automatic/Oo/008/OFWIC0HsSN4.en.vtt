inside of geo vision 8.3 it's called

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.020 
inside of geo vision 8.3 it's called
digital<00:00:12.690> matrix<00:00:12.929> and<00:00:13.559> it<00:00:14.160> is<00:00:14.190> for<00:00:14.610> multiple

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
digital matrix and it is for multiple

digital matrix and it is for multiple
monitor<00:00:15.510> displays<00:00:16.580> basically<00:00:17.580> you<00:00:17.759> can<00:00:17.970> treat

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
monitor displays basically you can treat

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.960 
monitor displays basically you can treat
your<00:00:18.840> other<00:00:19.230> monitor<00:00:19.770> as<00:00:19.950> a<00:00:20.009> spot<00:00:20.460> monitor

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:25.020 
without having a combo card okay this

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.660 
without having a combo card okay this
works<00:00:25.199> really<00:00:25.470> good<00:00:25.710> for<00:00:26.070> people<00:00:26.970> that<00:00:27.359> have<00:00:27.750> a

up<00:00:43.230> by<00:00:43.379> geo<00:00:43.590> vision<00:00:43.969> so<00:00:44.969> let's<00:00:45.090> go<00:00:45.270> ahead<00:00:45.329> and

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
up by geo vision so let's go ahead and

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:53.380 
up by geo vision so let's go ahead and
log<00:00:45.780> in<00:00:46.129> and<00:00:47.629> see<00:00:49.730> digital<00:00:50.730> matrix<00:00:51.530> cell

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.390 
log in and see digital matrix cell

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.910 
log in and see digital matrix cell
inside<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.450> digital<00:00:54.719> matrix<00:00:55.140> we<00:00:55.559> would<00:00:55.680> go<00:00:55.860> to

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
inside the digital matrix we would go to

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.090 
inside the digital matrix we would go to
the<00:00:56.280> hammer<00:00:56.489> and<00:00:56.670> a<00:00:56.730> screwdriver<00:00:56.969> icon<00:00:57.600> and

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.100 
the hammer and a screwdriver icon and

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.040 
the hammer and a screwdriver icon and
then<00:00:59.100> we<00:00:59.309> would<00:00:59.430> locate<00:00:59.850> accessories<00:01:00.690> and

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
then we would locate accessories and

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.920 
then we would locate accessories and
you'll<00:01:01.800> see<00:01:02.129> Digital<00:01:02.760> matrix<00:01:02.940> settings<00:01:03.629> right

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
you'll see Digital matrix settings right

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.639 
you'll see Digital matrix settings right
here<00:01:04.850> now<00:01:05.850> I'm<00:01:05.940> not<00:01:06.119> too<00:01:06.330> familiar<00:01:06.509> with<00:01:06.810> the

00:01:07.639 --> 00:01:07.649 
here now I'm not too familiar with the

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:10.700 
here now I'm not too familiar with the
whole<00:01:07.860> setup<00:01:08.220> but<00:01:08.780> I'll<00:01:09.780> figure<00:01:10.049> it<00:01:10.200> out<00:01:10.380> here

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
whole setup but I'll figure it out here

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.060 
whole setup but I'll figure it out here
so<00:01:11.070> let's<00:01:11.189> go<00:01:11.430> to<00:01:11.490> display<00:01:12.150> two<00:01:12.680> or<00:01:13.680> whichever

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
so let's go to display two or whichever

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.429 
so let's go to display two or whichever
display<00:01:14.580> you<00:01:14.640> want<00:01:14.939> to<00:01:15.210> display<00:01:15.720> it<00:01:15.960> on<00:01:16.020> if<00:01:16.320> you

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
display you want to display it on if you

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.469 
display you want to display it on if you
have<00:01:16.530> four<00:01:16.890> if<00:01:17.070> I've<00:01:17.250> displace<00:01:17.760> you'll<00:01:18.090> choose

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
have four if I've displace you'll choose

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.300 
have four if I've displace you'll choose
which<00:01:18.689> one<00:01:18.869> you<00:01:19.020> want<00:01:19.049> it<00:01:19.290> on<00:01:19.409> then<00:01:20.070> you<00:01:20.130> got<00:01:20.280> a

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
which one you want it on then you got a

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.490 
which one you want it on then you got a
display<00:01:20.549> two<00:01:20.670> I'm<00:01:21.299> gonna<00:01:21.630> click<00:01:21.840> activate

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
display two I'm gonna click activate

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.730 
display two I'm gonna click activate
next<00:01:22.890> to<00:01:22.979> there<00:01:23.130> and<00:01:23.659> then<00:01:24.659> I'm<00:01:25.020> gonna<00:01:25.290> only

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
next to there and then I'm gonna only

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.350 
next to there and then I'm gonna only
have<00:01:25.920> two<00:01:26.100> cameras<00:01:26.490> on<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.729> system<00:01:27.150> so<00:01:27.299> I'm

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
have two cameras on the system so I'm

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.760 
have two cameras on the system so I'm
just<00:01:27.509> gonna<00:01:27.659> make<00:01:27.840> sure<00:01:28.110> that<00:01:28.320> there's<00:01:28.590> two

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
just gonna make sure that there's two

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.149 
just gonna make sure that there's two
check<00:01:28.979> marks<00:01:29.009> there<00:01:29.540> that<00:01:30.540> you<00:01:30.630> can<00:01:30.950> have<00:01:31.950> to

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
check marks there that you can have to

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.069 
check marks there that you can have to
default<00:01:32.520> to<00:01:32.580> fission<00:01:32.850> all<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:33.240> way<00:01:33.329> up<00:01:33.420> to<00:01:33.570> 16

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
default to fission all the way up to 16

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.429 
default to fission all the way up to 16
here<00:01:34.790> and<00:01:35.790> then<00:01:35.909> you<00:01:36.090> can<00:01:36.210> just<00:01:36.420> drag<00:01:36.659> which

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
here and then you can just drag which

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:44.090 
here and then you can just drag which
camera<00:01:38.070> you<00:01:38.250> want<00:01:38.670> where<00:01:42.320> let's<00:01:43.320> see<00:01:43.619> let's
