00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:06.320
 Introduction to digital camera 

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:11.060
 Let's learn number 5 white balance 

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:14.870
 We are mostly looking at reflections from the plateau 

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:19.289
 Light sources are sunlight and artificial light 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:22.140
 The sun is reddish when viewed near the horizon 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:25.700
 At this time the color temperature will be lower 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:29.520
 It becomes bluish as the sun rises 

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:35.760
 This time I will be young 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:39.320
 The built-in white balance of the digital camera takes on a color that is influenced by the level of objectionability, and is infinitely white 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:45.180
 Says that of yesterday closer to 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:50.880
 Auto White Balance works as close to white as possible under any circumstances 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:54.450
 For example, in this table , Colt with auto white balance under the condition of light bulb 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:01:00.570
 Take the redness will change to thin red 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:01:02.570
 Thin face 3 to take a very bluish in the auto white balance under the conditions of the fine weather of the shade 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:10.020
 Or will be behind 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:14.020
 However, the auto white balance is a safe way but sometimes it does not come to mind 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.490
 The same setting retort as the condition 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:23.300
 It will be white 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:29.390
 In this figure, it will become infinitely white when it matches the mention mark of the camera under the condition of consecutive holidays 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:33.020
 In the same way as under the conditions of fine weather and when taking pictures with the symbol of the fine weather mode sun 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:40.159
 White is behind 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:41.950
 White is being affected by the color and take in the same Shotenko shade at all under the conditions of the same as latency shadow 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:46.240
 Will be behind 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:49.650
 These are presets and set in advance to the camera 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:53.460
 It is due to using colors 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:54.020
 However, the contents to be explained from now on will be different 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:02:01.310
 Hmm 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:02:03.210
 For example, the main white color of fluorescent light is about 5000 Kelvin , but it will become blue when taken at the research concentration 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:09.899
 I will 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:13.520
 High Donpen mode cool white fluorescent light conditions under the National College of Technology Kelvin Even though objection degree than that of the 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:17.600
 Reddish when taken at about 6000 Kelvin 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:22.520
 Bluish That training less objection degree than the current situation 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:27.350
 The bird will increase to red more than the current situation 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:32.510
 Please take a look at the following 3 pictures of the sunrise using this phenomenon 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:36.630
 The first shot was taken with a white balance boat 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:41.340
 This picture was taken in the established white balance 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:42.680
 The redness can be increased more than the ord white balance which has taken the long hair 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:47.940
 Don 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:54.330
 The third shot was taken in Tonpen mode approximately 6000 Kelvin 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:56.990
 I think that you can see that redness will increase if you make London higher than the current situation 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:03:00.020
 Let's take a look at the landscape this time 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:05.530
 It was almost in a strong mode condition 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:10.230
 It is an image taken with the white balance in bulb mode 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:13.290
 This is an image taken in fine weather mode 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:13.710
 This was taken in ton pen mode 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.290
 Hmm 

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:21.670
 You can see that it is slightly reddish 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:25.540
 Next, let's look at the images taken under fluorescent light conditions 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:31.959
 Let's look in order with low degree of controversy 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:32.880
 So that still looks white is white dish better to the setting of the same conditions do not become a perfectly 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:40.350
 is 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:46.590
 You can change the color to the addition of correction in a more about the earth soft this image 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:51.050
 With a compact digital camera, you can set while viewing the color in real time 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:55.520
 Target white and take the setting that looks white 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:59.360
 You can adjust the delivery with a slightly higher grade camera 

00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:03.980
 Noon white fluorescent light condition at about 5000 Kelvin 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:06.520
 White is whiter by 5000 Cherubini the white balance of the camera 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:12.200
 Will be expressed 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:18.079
 Let's together try to consciousness other colors of color and white balance If you come across can afford 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:21.739
 Rather, for example, flowers and faces the dark than Akasasa gray point 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:26.190
 Comparison will be lean by the substance to under 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:28.180
 Let's try the white balance conscious of the color next 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:32.580
 It's fine little by little 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:32.580
 Let's proceed with your own case
