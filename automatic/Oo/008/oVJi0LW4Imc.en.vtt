palaces that there are a lot of maps to
work<00:01:12.600> with<00:01:12.869> on<00:01:13.140> top<00:01:13.560> of<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:14.220> satin<00:01:14.820> shades<00:01:15.030> and

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
work with on top of the satin shades and

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.270 
work with on top of the satin shades and
the<00:01:15.210> shimmer<00:01:15.420> shades<00:01:15.600> which<00:01:16.080> makes<00:01:16.439> a<00:01:16.710> palette
