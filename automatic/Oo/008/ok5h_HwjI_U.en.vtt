00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.370
 I propose you a peanut cooking recipe so it is only I 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:12.779
 am risking becoming 

00:00:12.779 --> 00:00:14.359
 initially 

00:00:14.359 --> 00:00:17.070
 superb very much liked this recipe 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.310
 you will have to find the brand name 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:20.939
 symbol of continuation 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.499
 attoub the magnitude of the impact without drama 2-the brown sugar 

00:00:24.499 --> 00:00:27.499
 from 50 grams of flour with its big stage 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:31.769
 we love them about 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.769
 the peanut butter so you find that in some supermarkets 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:37.150
 while karim benzema 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:38.970
 afp also 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:41.930
 % one teaspoon of baking powder 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:44.010
 a good teaspoon 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.010
 weary of war if you have tried to look too closely 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:49.980
 so first step 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.980
 but logic the butter 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.570
 so of course it's not only from the north this time they agree 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.570
 but 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.190
 so without a serious doctor 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.780
 bagram 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.780
 peanut butter 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:19.730
 and then 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:23.230
 talk about sugar so I'm already starting alain I like this club 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.060
 two hours 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:33.980
 the door and sugar deal 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.720
 hahaha 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.030
 toulouges 66 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:48.530
 it's a sixteen film preparation is arguably the most luxurious strong 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.780
 not sure that's enough 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.780
 for the comfort of your pass 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.720
 so without waiting too much 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.720
 mix imposed 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.950
 stanford 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.309
 and then reinstate renault 

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:10.959
 same sex so the flour 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:13.959
 but on the one hand 7th a pinch of salt 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:23.749
 the old schumi 15 

00:02:23.749 --> 00:02:25.469
 a tea spoon 

00:02:25.469 --> 00:02:28.469
 and he tells me carbonate hello there 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:31.689
 it is 

00:02:31.689 --> 00:02:34.019
 in pharmacies 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:37.019
 supermarket 

00:02:41.679 --> 00:02:44.679
 staff 

00:02:48.999 --> 00:02:51.569
 I mixed with a husband it will be better 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:54.569
 at this stage 

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:17.509
 so we need all this 

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:19.299
 and then we will train in football 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:22.299
 and cook them 5 then very quickly ten minutes or so 

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:25.399
 on the radio 

00:03:25.399 --> 00:03:27.899
 190 degrees 

00:03:27.899 --> 00:03:30.869
 if you use if you have a convection oven it's a little bit 

00:03:30.869 --> 00:03:32.179
 less 

00:03:32.179 --> 00:03:35.179
 160 to 180 degrees 

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:37.299
 other games 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:40.279
 finished the dough and I find you to prepare son calls and that's it 

00:03:40.279 --> 00:03:43.649
 but we can think of the title we need to have balls of dough 

00:03:43.649 --> 00:03:46.420
 Oiled in a ball for the second cycle 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:48.899
 in space on a plate 

00:03:48.899 --> 00:03:50.039
 that goes to the oven 

00:03:50.039 --> 00:03:52.859
 so be either nonstick or with paper e 

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:55.859
 small cooking 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:00.250
 these famous woman and me tip I'm a little afraid of the words + ethic + to you from 

00:04:00.249 --> 00:04:01.259
 see 

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:04.659
 if you have peanuts this attack in put a sweet jacouti 

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:07.659
 folder 

00:04:17.879 --> 00:04:20.879
 or we will have two batches 

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:28.199
 good I know how to make his entry on this plate 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:48.400
 when we are because cookies are a type 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.409
 growing more cautious 

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:51.529
 to rotate 

00:04:51.529 --> 00:04:53.990
 stranded so I put five kids 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:56.990
 for ten minutes 

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:05.279
 just now that nicollin result after so ten minutes of 

00:05:05.279 --> 00:05:06.629
 baking 

00:05:06.629 --> 00:05:09.629
 - a lot of physics without notice 

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:15.860
 Of course 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:18.860
 ericsson a little 

00:05:22.449 --> 00:05:25.449
 Yes they are 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:31.080
 we are going to let them cool so on on the man 

00:05:32.099 --> 00:05:35.099
 on the financing plan 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:39.789
 and then everything is fine keep them in a hermetic box 

00:05:39.789 --> 00:05:43.039
 they are certainly a few days first jump while keeping their flight 

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:46.000
 that's what the daily ribs asserts
