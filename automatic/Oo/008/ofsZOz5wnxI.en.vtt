00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:06.690
 Hi everyone of the world rubber market 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:08.930
 This theme is 

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:13.830
 Here is the position to hit the serve 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.970
 About the location where the impact of the serve 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:22.819
 I would like to explain this to some beginners 

00:00:22.819 --> 00:00:26.599
 What is the question, but how is serve? 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:28.229
 By the way, I say 

00:00:28.229 --> 00:00:29.979
 People who don't know where to hit 

00:00:29.979 --> 00:00:33.100
 I'm out there and hit where 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.120
 Place that it is easy to give a good serve according to one's desire 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.430
 I tried to think a little, so the impact of serving 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.000
 If you have not been aware of the location before 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.580
 I think that it is good to have you refer to 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:50.080
 Let's make two points for the impact 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:55.770
 First of all I would like to explain 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.250
 If you are holding it sideways like this when you put it out 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.770
 I think it's almost all I have to do 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.320
 As it is hard to put change of lateral rotation 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.119
 If you are not conscious, hold it sideways as much as possible 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:10.719
 Please try to make an impact on it 

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:12.790
 I would like to explain the position 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:18.380
 I'm ready to raise the toss of serve 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.790
 Where do you impact first when you raise the toss 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:25.650
 It is a place but this is an impact in front of the body 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.659
 Please make sure you are actually in front of your body 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.139
 Here is here serve 

00:01:32.139 --> 00:01:37.209
 Please try to put out if this is too late 

00:01:37.209 --> 00:01:40.179
 It is hard to apply the rotation that the speed of the swing does not ride 

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:41.179
 It will be said 

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:52.359
 After all if you get stuck behind you as you think 

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:55.409
 I can not firmly apply the force to the ball 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:02.679
 It is when you raise the toss when you put out the reverse 

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:10.890
 This is also difficult to rotate 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.500
 For example, when issuing a lower rotation service 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.340
 I think I'll take the bottom of the ball 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:23.950
 It becomes how to put it out like this has gone before and pushed out 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.990
 I've been there before and can't break 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:30.090
 It's hard to get the bottom down, so in front of the body firmly 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.030
 Various rotation can be hung by putting out 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.110
 It will be easy to apply power 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.110
 Of course this is the same for long serve 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:43.250
 It's better than getting stuck in front or behind 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:49.250
 Play out strongly in front of the body 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.640
 Is the easiest to put in force 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:57.290
 The second point is a little bit the ball 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.440
 Please be aware that it attracts 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:01.980
 What does this mean? 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:07.280
 Raise the toss and basically straight toss 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.070
 I have to raise it, but when I raise my toss 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:14.920
 If the point to hit from the body is far 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.770
 It's hard to change 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:19.800
 I can, for example, turn sideways 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:25.730
 Because when you put up the racket, it won't rub well 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.500
 If you see the top player's game 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.720
 We understand immediately but almost all players 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.820
 At the point that attracted the ball to the body 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:37.250
 Good luck to say that I put out near the body 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:40.810
 Traceability of the angle of the racket by putting it out here 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:44.070
 Because you can do so, you can 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:45.070
 I can attach it 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:04:03.630
 If you are conscious of these two impact points 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:07.340
 If you do not do it please try it now 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:10.890
 It is said that we make score rate and chance in serve 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:14.500
 I think it will be a lot easier than now 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.100
 I want you to be conscious of doing serve practice 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:17.970
 Thank you very much
