00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:04.320
 this is the debate that they did not want 

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:06.530
 You saw 

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:09.990
 but we have also failed people 

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:12.660
 also during this period, the 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.150
 first we wanted to fight and many 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.610
 practices were copied by our 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.860
 governments and our party what yes 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:21.090
 It makes me weird to have to come to 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:23.189
 defend the party governments 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.410
 national action in our house and before 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.089
 a panista that the truth if it is done to me 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.220
 very weird but I do it with a lot of love and 

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:31.380
 With great pride I am convinced of 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.840
 that we govern better than the pri so 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.840
 things when the country strengthened and the 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:41.190
 bread was weakened were those the moments 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:43.649
 where people started to lose their 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:47.039
 backup because we were not fulfilling 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:49.020
 with this mission to dismantle the pri a 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:52.770
 this culture and many of the practices 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:55.289
 we incorporated them and strengthened the pri and 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.690
 to authoritarianism the governments of the bread 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.920
 there were no discretionary assignments 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.780
 like the ones you defend through 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.879
 the moches in the party governments 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.430
 national action had budgets 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.380
 based on results and there were mostly 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.690
 results of job creation and 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:14.130
 economic growth 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:17.820
 I do not feel proud of the government 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:22.620
 govern with the pri in 2013 we grew 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:26.310
 by 35 percent the votes and the 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:30.060
 governed population we went from 9 to 12 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:32.430
 million and a half inhabitants in the 14 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.620
 states that we govern in these 14 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.020
 states where there were elections I think 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:38.850
 what is important to do a little and do 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.230
 well the accounts of what happened to him 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.410
 electorally to the action party 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:45.410
 national in the last three years the 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:48.060
 which were your responsibility liked 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:50.630
 look in terms of governed population 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.260
 by states 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:57.010
 we governed 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:58.909
 26 million Mexicans in 2010 and 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:00.950
 today they are 17 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:03.979
 population governed at the municipal level 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.770
 were 30 and today are 24 we governed the 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:08.709
 presidency of the moyano republic 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:12.590
 we had six governorships and nothing else 5 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:17.030
 we had about 500 74 municipalities and 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:20.690
 nothing more 446 143 federal deputies in 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:22.160
 2010 today nothing more 114 52 senators today 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.780
 nothing more 38 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.190
 that is to say that you use the criterion that 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.379
 use if you do the accounts well by 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.700
 course and you do not make happy accounts then 

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:31.790
 the national action party has come 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:34.969
 shrinking under your leadership 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:38.090
 in these 40 days of campaign Juan Manuel 

00:02:34.969 --> 00:02:40.969
 and your servants have visited more 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:43.280
 municipal steering committees that the 

00:02:40.969 --> 00:02:46.040
 that your leadership liked in these 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:50.180
 last three years years if we make a 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:52.400
 serious self-criticism we can recognize that 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:55.879
 many de facto powers many 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:58.819
 monopolies many governors are more 

00:02:55.879 --> 00:03:01.519
 authoritarians who before have more 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:03.109
 resources are more despots 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:06.709
 Well, look at me as the PAN would give me 

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:08.780
 much enthusiasm that as well as hand you 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:10.370
 You are here among the PAN members 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.959
 you were to manipulate the PRI 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.209
 well it's too much to ask you 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:17.569
 you take refuge much that the popular insurance that 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:20.450
 it's good but what I say is let's go 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:23.629
 to see what are the practices of the pri 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:25.730
 that were dismantled and which were not 

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:28.220
 We could make friends and I do 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:31.430
 a double speech here in the house of the 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:33.849
 PAN as if we are very substantial if 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:37.519
 we say we want to dismantle the pri 

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:38.220
 but outside we say that peÃ±a yes 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:41.700
 fulfill 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:44.070
 what rock captivated us that rock was covered 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:46.980
 of glory and so many other things that have 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:49.410
 hurt the PAN we can not 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:51.570
 allow us to be proud of the 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:53.790
 achievements of other political forces when 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:56.040
 we have a lot to offer and 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:58.560
 we also have a past and a history 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:02.100
 of which we must feel very 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:04.800
 proud I ask you for your trust, friend 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:07.590
