manufacturing<00:01:48.770> principles<00:01:49.039> so<00:01:49.939> that<00:01:49.970> we<00:01:50.329> can

00:01:50.559 --> 00:01:50.569 
manufacturing principles so that we can

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:52.630 
manufacturing principles so that we can
actually<00:01:51.229> safely<00:01:51.920> administer<00:01:52.069> it<00:01:52.490> to<00:01:52.549> a

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.190 
organ that is available for transplant
is<00:04:50.460> suitable<00:04:50.880> for<00:04:51.030> transplant<00:04:51.630> some<00:04:51.930> of<00:04:52.080> those

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:52.200 
is suitable for transplant some of those

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:56.270 
is suitable for transplant some of those
could<00:04:52.620> be<00:04:52.650> used<00:04:52.880> for<00:04:54.169> making<00:04:55.169> a<00:04:55.560> suspension<00:04:56.070> of

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 
could be used for making a suspension of

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:57.830 
could be used for making a suspension of
the<00:04:56.430> cells<00:04:56.700> that<00:04:56.940> are<00:04:57.000> important<00:04:57.570> in<00:04:57.660> that

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:57.840 
the cells that are important in that

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.290 
the cells that are important in that
organ<00:04:58.200> and<00:04:58.349> that's<00:04:58.530> really<00:04:59.160> the<00:04:59.370> next<00:04:59.760> step

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:00.300 
organ and that's really the next step

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:03.830 
organ and that's really the next step
and<00:05:01.260> it<00:05:01.590> also<00:05:01.830> would<00:05:02.190> allow<00:05:02.490> that<00:05:02.550> if<00:05:03.360> we<00:05:03.599> could

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:03.840 
and it also would allow that if we could

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:06.940 
and it also would allow that if we could
grow<00:05:03.990> these<00:05:04.320> things<00:05:04.650> up<00:05:04.860> or<00:05:05.190> if<00:05:05.580> we<00:05:05.789> could

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:06.950 
grow these things up or if we could

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:10.760 
grow these things up or if we could
split<00:05:07.950> an<00:05:08.250> organ<00:05:08.940> because<00:05:09.419> we<00:05:10.200> had<00:05:10.349> the<00:05:10.590> small

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:10.770 
split an organ because we had the small

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:13.490 
split an organ because we had the small
recipient<00:05:11.580> or<00:05:11.820> in<00:05:12.419> other<00:05:12.630> ways<00:05:12.870> to<00:05:13.200> manipulate

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:13.500 
recipient or in other ways to manipulate

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:17.210 
recipient or in other ways to manipulate
things<00:05:14.120> it<00:05:15.120> it<00:05:15.690> allows<00:05:16.169> us<00:05:16.470> to<00:05:16.590> take<00:05:16.800> that<00:05:17.010> next

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:17.220 
things it it allows us to take that next

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:20.360 
things it it allows us to take that next
step<00:05:17.780> when<00:05:18.780> it<00:05:18.810> comes<00:05:19.110> to<00:05:19.289> the<00:05:19.380> future<00:05:19.770> the

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:20.370 
step when it comes to the future the

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:21.550 
step when it comes to the future the
sky's<00:05:20.700> the<00:05:20.729> limit

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:21.560 
sky's the limit

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.779 
sky's the limit
hopefully<00:05:22.560> in<00:05:22.710> the<00:05:22.770> future<00:05:22.860> we'll<00:05:23.340> be<00:05:23.490> able<00:05:23.639> to

00:05:23.779 --> 00:05:23.789 
hopefully in the future we'll be able to

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:27.589 
hopefully in the future we'll be able to
do<00:05:24.510> more<00:05:25.110> new<00:05:25.410> things<00:05:25.740> I<00:05:26.039> think<00:05:26.669> the<00:05:26.940> standard

00:05:27.589 --> 00:05:27.599 
do more new things I think the standard

00:05:27.599 --> 00:05:29.990 
do more new things I think the standard
products<00:05:28.139> that<00:05:28.380> we've<00:05:28.560> been<00:05:29.280> making<00:05:29.520> for<00:05:29.760> a

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:30.000 
products that we've been making for a

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.870 
products that we've been making for a
long<00:05:30.240> time<00:05:30.479> are<00:05:31.039> very<00:05:32.039> helpful<00:05:32.520> for<00:05:32.760> many

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:32.880 
long time are very helpful for many

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:35.150 
long time are very helpful for many
patients<00:05:33.180> but<00:05:34.080> that's<00:05:34.440> not<00:05:34.680> really<00:05:35.039> the

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:35.160 
patients but that's not really the

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.850 
patients but that's not really the
future<00:05:35.340> of<00:05:35.639> transplantation<00:05:36.330> or<00:05:36.810> of<00:05:37.320> immune

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:37.860 
future of transplantation or of immune

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:40.370 
future of transplantation or of immune
therapies<00:05:38.460> and<00:05:38.700> I<00:05:39.120> see<00:05:39.780> that<00:05:39.990> there<00:05:40.139> will<00:05:40.229> be<00:05:40.260> a

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:40.380 
therapies and I see that there will be a

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:42.649 
therapies and I see that there will be a
lot<00:05:41.070> more<00:05:41.099> diseases<00:05:41.910> that<00:05:42.060> could<00:05:42.270> be<00:05:42.419> treated

00:05:42.649 --> 00:05:42.659 
lot more diseases that could be treated

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:45.050 
lot more diseases that could be treated
with<00:05:43.099> products<00:05:44.099> or<00:05:44.190> vaccine

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:45.060 
with products or vaccine

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:47.150 
with products or vaccine
could<00:05:45.180> be<00:05:45.300> manufactured<00:05:45.810> here<00:05:46.260> and<00:05:46.919> I<00:05:47.100> think

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:47.160 
could be manufactured here and I think

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:50.720 
could be manufactured here and I think
it's<00:05:47.430> pretty<00:05:48.000> much<00:05:48.060> limitless
