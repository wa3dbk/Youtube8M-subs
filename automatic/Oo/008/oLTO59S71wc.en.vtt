00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:04.319
 for preliminary cost calculation 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.370
 your future ok he can 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.040
 take advantage of our online 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:11.580
 calculator for a start consider what 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.710
 we will consider it a window or door or 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.740
 balcony blocks 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:21.689
 Well, for example, take the calculation of plastic on 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:25.920
 the top of the window itself can 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:27.990
 will see his configuration we need 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.140
 will be with you to determine the type of plastic 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.820
 windows ie single door or 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.430
 double window will 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:42.030
 or maybe tricuspid choose 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:44.219
 the options of interest are examples

 take a double window with a swivel and 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:51.449
 tilt flap after that 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:56.789
 we need to determine the approximate dimensions 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:01:00.629
 windows width and height of the product for this 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:05.420
 moving the sliders you can 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.420
 get the required size 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:16.740
 after determining the approximate dimensions 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:18.810
 choose with you a window system type 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.530
 kaleva company profiles are enough 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.270
 a large number of them 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.850
 various directions of profile systems 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:32.659
 for preliminary calculation you can take 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:34.830
 profile if you design glass package 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:37.710
 double-glazed windows are single-chamber and 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:39.600
 two-chamber and including noise protection 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.640
 that is, with special glasses more often 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.690
 just for apartments put two-chamber 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.690
 three glass panes 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:51.990

 accessories set 

00:01:56.789 --> 00:02:00.890
 then with locking points or hidden 

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:03.810
 lying hardware 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:07.459
 more detail can be clarified in

 decorating that is not to make them simple 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:16.079
 white and make for example 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.200
 laminated on valuable breed

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:35.270
 the window makes white handles but you can 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:37.420

 as white as I said before but also 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:16.780
 laminated on one side as well 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:19.270
