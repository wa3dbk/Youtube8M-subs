here<00:06:08.290> we<00:06:09.100> have<00:06:09.220> mounted<00:06:09.520> a<00:06:09.580> simple<00:06:10.000> pointer<00:06:10.330> on

00:06:10.439 --> 00:06:10.449 
here we have mounted a simple pointer on

00:06:10.449 --> 00:06:12.450 
here we have mounted a simple pointer on
the<00:06:10.479> tank<00:06:10.840> to<00:06:11.320> illustrate<00:06:11.830> counter-steering

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:12.460 
the tank to illustrate counter-steering

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:15.060 
the tank to illustrate counter-steering
let's<00:06:13.180> take<00:06:13.389> it<00:06:13.510> for<00:06:13.660> a<00:06:13.690> ride<00:06:13.930> let's<00:06:14.770> see<00:06:14.949> what

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:15.070 
let's take it for a ride let's see what

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:25.080 
let's take it for a ride let's see what
happens

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:25.090 

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:27.370 

see<00:06:26.090> how<00:06:26.270> the<00:06:26.330> pointer<00:06:26.780> shows<00:06:27.020> the<00:06:27.170> bars

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:27.380 
see how the pointer shows the bars

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:29.200 
see how the pointer shows the bars
moving<00:06:27.680> first<00:06:28.070> to<00:06:28.280> the<00:06:28.400> left<00:06:28.550> and<00:06:28.850> then<00:06:29.180> right

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:29.210 
moving first to the left and then right

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:30.850 
moving first to the left and then right
and<00:06:29.720> vice-versa

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:30.860 
and vice-versa

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:34.180 
and vice-versa
this<00:06:31.760> is<00:06:32.020> countersteering<00:06:33.200> it's<00:06:33.650> the<00:06:33.890> only

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:34.190 
this is countersteering it's the only

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:39.439 
this is countersteering it's the only
way<00:06:34.490> to<00:06:34.790> accurately<00:06:35.300> steer<00:06:35.630> a<00:06:35.840> motorcycle

00:06:39.439 --> 00:06:39.449 

00:06:39.449 --> 00:06:42.799 

it<00:06:39.900> really<00:06:40.499> is<00:06:40.710> simple<00:06:41.300> just<00:06:42.300> press<00:06:42.599> on<00:06:42.749> the

it really is simple just press on the

00:06:42.809 --> 00:06:44.989 
it really is simple just press on the
bath<00:06:43.080> and<00:06:43.439> the<00:06:43.590> bike<00:06:43.740> responds<00:06:44.309> instantly

00:06:44.989 --> 00:06:44.999 
bath and the bike responds instantly

00:06:44.999 --> 00:06:47.929 
bath and the bike responds instantly
that's<00:06:45.900> all<00:06:46.080> you<00:06:46.199> do<00:06:46.349> and<00:06:46.529> it<00:06:46.979> works<00:06:47.219> overtime
