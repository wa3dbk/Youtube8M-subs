00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:12.090
 Aa and O 'la Olla, hi hi, I know 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.440
 What am I doing on youtube and topic? 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.109
 that I'll talk about what people 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:19.170
 they think when they watch me a life 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:21.390
 Today's issue is crisis 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.699
 that you have never had a 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.859
 existential crisis in your life in the 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.480
 holy of sight have you repeated that no 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.980
 functioning a normal human being who 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.929
 people are doing on earth what is the 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.559
 Our function for where we are going to see 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:36.420
 where do we have 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:38.910
 I think the big factor of the crisis 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.700
 existential is that we really are the 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:46.230
 The moment we leave and we 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:49.200
 begins to look from the outside and not 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:52.260
 when we start to repair what the 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:58.109
 others think we confuse 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:01:01.079
 People no longer know what they are and I know more 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:03.780
 I know that the existential crisis can be 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.760
 something that may be cool in your life did 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.340
 every positive side you have a crisis 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.650
 can end up reviewing and looking for 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:15.900
 new concepts and improving and 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:17.909
