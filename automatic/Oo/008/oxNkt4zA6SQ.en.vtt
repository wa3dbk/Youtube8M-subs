pets I used to have lizards and lizards
really<00:02:22.110> sucked<00:02:22.379> because<00:02:22.560> they're<00:02:23.519> very<00:02:23.790> mean

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
really sucked because they're very mean

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.059 
really sucked because they're very mean
and<00:02:24.209> they<00:02:24.540> tend<00:02:24.810> to<00:02:24.930> only<00:02:25.049> like<00:02:25.349> one<00:02:25.560> person<00:02:25.950> at

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
and they tend to only like one person at

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:30.289 
and they tend to only like one person at
a<00:02:26.129> time<00:02:26.269> so<00:02:27.980> mm<00:02:28.980> just<00:02:29.340> not<00:02:29.549> the<00:02:29.760> greatest<00:02:29.970> pet

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:30.299 
a time so mm just not the greatest pet

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:31.670 
a time so mm just not the greatest pet
you<00:02:30.450> know<00:02:30.540> really<00:02:30.750> high-maintenance<00:02:30.959> and<00:02:31.530> you

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
you know really high-maintenance and you

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:32.960 
you know really high-maintenance and you
don't<00:02:31.830> really<00:02:31.950> get<00:02:32.129> to<00:02:32.190> do<00:02:32.370> anything<00:02:32.640> with

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
don't really get to do anything with

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.670 
don't really get to do anything with
them<00:02:33.090> and<00:02:33.269> I<00:02:33.299> kind<00:02:33.540> of<00:02:33.629> like<00:02:33.780> to<00:02:33.959> play<00:02:34.440> around

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
them and I kind of like to play around

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.380 
them and I kind of like to play around
with<00:02:34.890> my<00:02:35.069> fuzzy<00:02:35.430> little<00:02:35.459> critters<00:02:35.970> and<00:02:36.150> stuff

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
with my fuzzy little critters and stuff

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.780 
with my fuzzy little critters and stuff
so<00:02:36.599> I<00:02:36.890> guess<00:02:37.890> that's<00:02:38.099> all<00:02:38.250> I<00:02:38.280> really<00:02:38.489> have<00:02:38.640> to

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
so I guess that's all I really have to

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.319 
so I guess that's all I really have to
say<00:02:39.150> about<00:02:39.540> snuggle<00:02:40.230> foods<00:02:40.500> here<00:02:41.000> say<00:02:42.000> hi<00:02:42.299> or
