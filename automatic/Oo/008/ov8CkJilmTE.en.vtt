 hello everywhere drugged and good 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:26.440
 welcome to the new video in fifa and 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.820

 this video and comment on anything and 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:39.910
 nothing more and good now yes we are already with 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:41.320
 today's video as you know this mini 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:44.110
 series that I'm bringing the best 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:46.330
 possible team of this time it touches therefore that 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:49.660
 the best possible team in my opinion 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:51.010
 which is important in the bbva league and 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:53.080
 Well, that's my opinion, so 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.150
 do not expect everyone to agree with me but 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:58.030
 well in my opinion this is the team 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:59.540
 perfect of the bea the most expensive the 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.270
 perfect 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:05.480
 training that we would use would be the 4-4-1-1 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:07.760
 a formation that I have used very well 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:10.400
 very little but well I think that the grape 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.170
 for the perfect team this would be and 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.370
 good in the first place the goal I 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.440
 I think that here there is no doubt 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:16.670
 courtois worship everyone by terrace 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:21.229
 the best of the game look at what 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:23.960
 statistics 87 92 90 89 good porterazo 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:25.310
 and I think there's no doubt then that 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.380
 more average does it seem to me that you are 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.210
 chairs that does not go well at all so that 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.759
 here there is no doubt it would be short to all 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:34.400
 in his version of clear athletic no 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:37.550
 chelsea because he does not have the tots and also 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:39.020
 well it would not be the bv and nothing then 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.690
 we would go to the sides that by 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:44.540
 left we would have filipe luis in his 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:46.490
 version of the athletic as courtois that 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:48.140
 it's a very, very good side and then 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.780
 also other options would be better 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.580
 marcelo marcelo and fuego jordi alba 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.380
 even the normal but good team 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.720
 it would have to be spectacular like that with 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.759
 many blue many colors and I think 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.259
 that we would put philipp and that is also 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:01.660
 what I tell you is very very good to look at 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:04.400
 what statistics and I think here 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:07.050
 there would be little doubt also and then by the 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:09.900
 right lateral here yes there is no doubt 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:11.850
 would be alves dani alves tots that 

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:13.620
 it's not a good year either but good as 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:16.440
 in the previous one yes he did it because he had 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.120
 his totti and here is dani alves totti 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:22.080
 that you see has some very technical 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:25.200
 good that maybe it was better in the fifa 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:27.570
 of extreme but good is lateral and good 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.360
 he has a very good defense of 86 good 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:31.920
 one of the best sides of the game 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.630
 dani alves totti and we would go to the 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.820
 two centrals that would be both of 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.130
 madrid more than anything because they are fast 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:40.680
 pp that reaches almost 80 and then 90 and 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.810
 87 that is, some very 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.970
 good those of pepe very good defense 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.819
 height height everything is going well 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.069
 Quick 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:51.019
 very good pp and then bouquets then the 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:53.079
 probably the best central game 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:55.879
 and the tot is very very good and 

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:59.719
 practically good almost reaches 90 in 

00:02:55.879 --> 00:03:02.359
 rhythm then 94 in head-butt in 92 of 

00:02:59.719 --> 00:03:04.609
 defense also takes it out good dribble 

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:06.109
 very complete very complete central 

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:08.239
 that is probably the best in the game 

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:10.849
 so here did not help either the doubt 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:14.150
 it can be maybe between pp and holding 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:15.859
 godin that I have here here my 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.200
 some players that I will teach them later 

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:19.730
 but well we would finish the defense and 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:23.090
 we would go to the middle of the field where 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:25.819
 they would be good is the version 44 11 you see 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:30.139
 that is a bit strange with a playmaker 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:31.879
 two bands two midfielders and good 

00:03:30.139 --> 00:03:34.160
 the two midfielders and they would wish xavi 

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:37.490
 iniesta its version totti 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:39.350
 the average 295 and good very good xavi 

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:41.780
 that is not quite fast but good 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:44.060
 pulls well but the best good in the cifa 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.740
 is that it is not going well xavi in my 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.750
 opinion because it is slow does not pull well not 

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:49.670
 it has strength but good yes that is true 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.990
 that has an incredible pass good dribble 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:53.570
 a ball control is very agile 

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:56.510
 incredible and I think it good to be 

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:58.790
 I would put totti here xavi hernandez 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:01.400
 also defends well and good here I 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:05.120
 I think there would be little doubt also and 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:07.880
 then xavi and iniesta sorry though good 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:12.500
 better than xavi even 80 and 80 in rhythm 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:14.810
 and pass in rhythm and throw forgiveness 97 and 97 in 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.640
 incredible regatta pass and statistics 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:18.620
 of iniesta also also defends 

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:20.180
 fairly good and good 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:23.080
 we would have two touches in the middle of the 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:25.760
 field and now yes we would go to the 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:27.320
 mediapunta that I would put to neymar that 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.150
 neymar has better versions I think 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:32.150
 has even two better versions that 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:34.880
 these what happens that in another position or 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:36.680
 be that in this position the most this is 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:39.200
 the best neymar that you already know that the 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:41.000
 normal version has 84 but good this 

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:42.530
 it's 88 and it's pretty much better 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.910
 there is no mark to me it seems the third 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:46.460
 best player of the last cinema is 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:49.310
 great with 93 in good rhythm there what 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:50.690
 You see five and five in good dribbles 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:53.150
 five stars surrender and five in 

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:55.360
 bad leg that only has neymar and one 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:58.010
 I think it was more like a girl and I think it was 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:59.180
 good and neymar that is amazing in my 

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:01.550
 opinion I say that it is one of the 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:03.830
 third best players the third 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:06.080
 best player of ultimate team and already 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:08.720
 we would go to the best that would be the 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:10.250
 bands with ronaldo Christian that my 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:13.960
 opinion is the best front of the game 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:18.470
 there you see the top ticket 98 at pace 97 of 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:21.470
 shot 37 of pass 98 of dribble and 95 of 

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:23.150
 headshot plus 5 between arts and 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:25.240
 good Christian that surely is the 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:27.800
 better or better game player 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:29.450
 if someone can win you it 's only 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:31.669
 ibrahimovic but good the Christian is 

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:33.080
 one beast then on the other band for 

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:34.130
 the right band would have been another 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:38.180
 beast 

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:41.030
 that's good with 96 of 95 rhythm of shot 91 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:44.360
 92 80 82 very complete and as you see then 

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:46.400
 is another beast very fast strong has 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:47.630
 all dancing surely the most player 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:49.730
 complete of the game 

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:51.500
 and here I think there would be no doubt and 

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:54.350
 then we would go to the center forward 

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:57.260
 that would be month and toti a success uncle month 

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:58.850
 and the one that also has 98 on average that 

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:01.760
 is the international hands of more the 

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:03.830
 green but good I have caught this good 

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:05.740
 97 well there you are seeing the 

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:07.780
 statistics to the left 

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:11.860
 incredible statistics with 99 

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:14.740
 delivered from 97 96 92 good again you 

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:17.139
 I loved yes and nothing this would be the eleven holder 

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:18.789
 and then here I have put some 

00:06:17.139 --> 00:06:21.430
 players who could also be like 

00:06:18.789 --> 00:06:24.009
 diego alves and godín that already said to you that 

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:26.080
 if you do not put app this one can also 

00:06:24.009 --> 00:06:29.169
 be well the one that has to be yes or 

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:30.699
 yes of branches then juanfran that one to me 

00:06:29.169 --> 00:06:33.430
 I even think it seems better to me 

00:06:30.699 --> 00:06:34.720
 alberto ti but good to see this you me 

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:35.919
 I think it should be put to see but 

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:38.940
 good juanfran I tell you that it is very 

00:06:35.919 --> 00:06:41.500
 good 88 and 90 has defense and rhythm 

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:43.840
 very good juanfran then I would be modric 

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:46.270
 that my opinion is better than xavi but 

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:48.849
 good as xavi this you then I 

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:51.340
 I would prefer but good modric see that 

00:06:48.849 --> 00:06:53.889
 good is an incredible midfielder 

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:56.979
 then it would be diego costa a killer that 

00:06:53.889 --> 00:06:59.259
 It is also very good but it would not be 

00:06:56.979 --> 00:07:01.659
 because there is month and toti and 

00:06:59.259 --> 00:07:03.550
 then it would be benzema that good has 

00:07:01.659 --> 00:07:05.050
 a version by the Christian band 

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:07.240
 ronaldo by the left band so that 

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:09.380
 I should not be a starter but good 

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:11.450
 very interesting option over 

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:13.880
 and nothing this would be a team my team 

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:15.530
 perfect of the bbva league and I do not know 

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:18.110
 tell me what do you think that 

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:20.540
 change and that is what players would put that 

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:23.200
 anything and nothing a greeting and up 

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:23.200
 the next video
