00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:05.100
 hello friends how are they like 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:07.109
 promised in the previous video today they 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.530
 I'm going to show you how you can change the 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:13.620
 color to your keyboard good we're going to 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:16.109
 direct to the tul apk and let's look 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.660
 our keyboard that as many 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:21.780
 we know it is inside kuzbass 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.570
 apt in the first folder 

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:26.610
 what we are going to do is compile 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.910
 our keyboard we are going to touch it and you 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:32.430
 we are going to give in that compile all once 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.640
 that is finished, this will be created 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:38.120
 folder we left and we go to the rod 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.120
 explorer 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:48.829
 good once here we are going to 

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:52.020
 put in res 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:55.380
 and we will look for values 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:57.720
 we go to styles we have it 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:01.800
 pressed and we give in the option of 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:05.690
 open in text editor what we are going to 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.690
 change is from this number here 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:13.220
 and as I said in the previous video 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:15.650
 can see the color code in 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:19.700
 the palette of photoshop or using the 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:21.790
 photo editor good to be able to give 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:26.740
 any example let's put 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:26.740
 yellow that are four axes 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:32.850
 2 and 20 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.560
 when they have finished putting their color 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.450
 they will give you save and leave 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.790
 as you see in the bottom part if we 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:42.810
 there is a backup but if they did the 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:46.710
 things well we will not need 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:49.049
 now what we just changed is for 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:52.259
 change the color to the letters there as 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:56.189
 can see now to change what is 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:59.340
 the leds the feedback that are the letters 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:02.670
 that stand out we'll have to get in here 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.830
 in colors and likewise we are going to 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:08.670
 give in opening a text editor and 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:12.739
 let's change I'm here the penultimate 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:15.269
 color ok then we have it pressed 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:18.450
 and we can put the color that 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:20.690
 we want, I'm going to put it like the 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.690
 other 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:38.659
 well once finished they give it in save 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.659
 and go out and delete this 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:47.770
 well once we've done this we 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:51.550
 let's direct again to the freckle 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:55.540
 tool let's touch this and demonstrate in 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:58.540
 recompiling this process may take a 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:01.100
 Approximately one and a half to two minutes is a 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:05.260
 bit slow 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:08.690
 now when you are going to replace 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:11.390
 your keyboard before doing them 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:13.760
 I recommend doing a baco since when 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:17.000
 you replace and restart in the 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:20.690
 cell will force them to close if 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:25.010
 that's where your cow comes in 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:31.090
 action they install it and ready you will notice that 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:33.790
 your keyboard is normal and in return and so 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.650
 that would be the recommendation to me has 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:37.930
 happened several times that's why I 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:41.819
 I tell them to make a backup and if it gives them 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.819
 force closing nothing else install it 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:19.750
 and 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:19.750
 the 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.370
 two 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:28.530
 one 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:59.250
 all 

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:34.430
 it looks like it's going to end 

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:34.430
 so delay 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:41.940
 of good 

00:05:47.289 --> 00:05:52.899
 well it's finished well once this 

00:05:51.039 --> 00:05:55.419
 procedure has finished again 

00:05:52.899 --> 00:05:57.729
 are going to be directed to the root explorer and 

00:05:55.419 --> 00:06:00.719
 they have to go back to where they 

00:05:57.729 --> 00:06:00.719
 find the keyboard 

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:07.410
 well as they realize we are created this 

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:10.220
 file what we are going to do is 

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:14.150
 re name 

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:14.150
 put him yes 

00:06:17.359 --> 00:06:22.109
 once renamed this what are we going to 

00:06:19.649 --> 00:06:24.329
 do is get inside the keyboard 

00:06:22.109 --> 00:06:27.419
 that we have decompressed inside 

00:06:24.329 --> 00:06:29.950
 original and we are going to copy this that is 

00:06:27.419 --> 00:06:31.930
 obviously the signature 

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:34.950
 once this is done we will extract 

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:34.950
 our keyboard 

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:43.020
 and it is already 

00:06:40.569 --> 00:06:47.930
 what we said here 

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:50.960
 and this is where we paste this 

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:53.259
 although I think it was already signed but 

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:53.259
 good 

00:06:53.409 --> 00:06:57.119
 we can delete this 

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:18.440
 good 

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:18.440
 let's rename 

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:24.410
 our zip 

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:24.410
 let's copy it 

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:31.480
 and b-20 you already know where you should go like to 

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:34.980
 pepe and here we paste 

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:34.980
 let's rename what 

00:07:39.249 --> 00:07:45.940
 well only Latin should remain 

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:47.689
 and point 

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:50.389
 to sin 

00:07:47.689 --> 00:07:53.199
 once renamed you should give it 

00:07:50.389 --> 00:07:53.199
 the permits 

00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:57.889
 and they must replace it 

00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:04.280
 and that would be all friends and as I said 

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:06.770
 at the time that you restart in the 

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:08.630
 cellular and you are forcing closure must 

00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:10.610
 install your backup 

00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:12.770
 well that would be all friends I hope that 

00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:15.400
 the video you liked we see you in 

00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:15.400
 the next video 

00:08:17.249 --> 00:08:19.909
 and good bye
