 it's time for the recipe and we're 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.950
 if you are to prepare some reading taquitos 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:59.640

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.330

 we would like 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.820
 a main course of the block thinks that I like challenges and then then I 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.360
 They send what difficult things we should do but today we go 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.720
 to make a strong dish with lettuce that they would see that is rich cow is 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.530

 amos add our sesame oil 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.910
 many I like to use sesame oil when I go to enjoy the lugo 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:35.420
 because it finally has a much higher temperature than the other types of 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.420
 oil but good at home if you do not have a game you can also use any 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.490
 skillet 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:46.119

 let's add the garlic 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.420
 and we have to be very fast because as they are strong in temperature 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.540
 we do not want anything to do 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:08.110
 that me because finally it was the current bitter 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.209
 this preparation 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:15.229

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:34.399

00:02:34.399 --> 00:02:35.619
 let's go to 

00:02:35.619 --> 00:02:38.719

00:02:55.089 --> 00:02:57.039
 sanz to that added 

00:02:57.039 --> 00:02:59.739
 they do not talk like 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:01.839
 number of clients 

00:03:01.839 --> 00:03:05.539
 that will give me a different favor 

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:08.190
 already from the oyster sauce 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:12.750
 the hikes you can get in any supermarket that sells the 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.340
 Chinese specialty notes found up to the supermarket where I'm going 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:22.409
 always by the way there is always have it then a very very common sauce 

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:25.409
 what we can start to think 

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:30.590
 search in your self service 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:33.930
 certified products with the seal mexico quality 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:42.609
 still be missing if you remember that always 

00:03:43.119 --> 00:03:48.159
 very very important that we do not serve raw chicken but that the chicken has what is 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:50.219
 will present him 

00:03:50.219 --> 00:03:53.219
 table already fully possible 

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:55.889
 a little 

00:03:55.889 --> 00:03:58.889
 and while I'm going to teach them previously 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:00.790
 us here 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:03.389
 we already have the lettuce 

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:05.289
 i the lettuce 

00:04:05.289 --> 00:04:07.079
 What we did was 

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:10.179
 love a common romaine lettuce 

00:04:10.179 --> 00:04:12.069
 a meek jaroussky 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:16.479
 we are going to be a few taquitos with these sheets then very important in the 

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:20.579
 sheets are complete so that we can make the taquitos 

00:04:21.999 --> 00:04:24.999
 and only use of the service 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:27.620
 gestation 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:29.930
 during these products does not have 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:31.559
 a type of damage 

00:04:31.559 --> 00:04:34.610
 Free high school planes have been watered with drinking water 

00:04:35.439 --> 00:04:37.889
 confessed in a timely manner 

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:40.889
 being the best arasti 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:49.370
 we are going to add the sauce that he expressed 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:54.090
 will be the bosses 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:57.090
 all the sauce 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.180
 We add him 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:04.789
 the chile de árbol and there I leave it 

00:05:04.789 --> 00:05:07.789
 at your choice how much we want 

00:05:08.289 --> 00:05:09.550
 and good if I wanted 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:12.680
 you have to accept it and that this is the point where I would not serve 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:15.979
 lie in the kitchen 

00:05:15.979 --> 00:05:20.940
 use what is the matrix in appears sar and then that makes a sauce 

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:22.309
 much thicker 

00:05:22.309 --> 00:05:25.279
 here I have a little water 

00:05:25.279 --> 00:05:29.569
 and it's going to incorporate the apple with the water before because we do not want it to 

00:05:29.569 --> 00:05:31.960
 make any kind of lumps 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:34.499
 is already fully incorporated 

00:05:34.499 --> 00:05:36.110
 and nothing else adds 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:37.199
 in the end 

00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:38.560
 and this is going to be that 

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:41.620
 our sauce 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:44.219
 efe is more is 

00:05:44.219 --> 00:05:49.419
 Well now nelly ask why you do not read added to the jewelry 

00:05:50.249 --> 00:05:54.599
 nor salty so I prefer not to add more but that I leave it to the 

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:57.999
 all the cook that steve trash from the pool 

00:05:57.999 --> 00:06:00.430
 and if you like a little bit more about abortion 

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:04.630
 You can also add a little more salt to our steps 

00:06:05.759 --> 00:06:07.249
 let's go here 

00:06:07.249 --> 00:06:08.680
 Jorge 

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:12.139
 our plate 

00:06:12.139 --> 00:06:13.719
 of presentation 

00:06:13.719 --> 00:06:15.650
 i the idea 

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:17.509
 is that we are going to take 

00:06:17.509 --> 00:06:19.629
 one of these lettuces 

00:06:19.629 --> 00:06:22.610
 with the help of a spoon 

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:24.559
 we can fill 

00:06:24.559 --> 00:06:26.229
 these taxi drivers that Luis 

00:06:26.229 --> 00:06:29.229
 it is important to be careful because yes this 

00:06:30.349 --> 00:06:32.659
 in three months it is also clear 

00:06:32.659 --> 00:06:35.029
 but see how nice 

00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:36.650
 we can do here 

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:39.650
 a taquito jean pierre dick kooy 

00:06:44.259 --> 00:06:46.159
 if there is a taquito 

00:06:46.159 --> 00:06:49.159
 busts ministers according to 

00:06:52.009 --> 00:06:57.659
 box and many restaurants where it serves in the chicken mix but leaves out 

00:06:58.969 --> 00:07:02.089
 with the lettuce so everyone can make their taquito 

00:07:02.089 --> 00:07:05.540
 but I do like this option because finally 

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:10.690
 of him so we can have a taquito that this hotter than 

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:14.440
 common that then I do not love the idea of ​​lettuce difference 

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:34.780
 they are our 

00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:37.399
 cultivate here 

00:07:37.399 --> 00:07:40.399
 we can not put this appointment 

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:44.889
 the three nights 

00:07:44.889 --> 00:07:47.919
