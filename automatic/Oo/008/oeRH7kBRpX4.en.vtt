talk<00:00:17.010> about<00:00:17.279> the<00:00:17.490> physical<00:00:17.970> things<00:00:18.269> I<00:00:18.480> have

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
talk about the physical things I have

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.600 
talk about the physical things I have
made<00:00:18.779> change<00:00:19.080> to<00:00:19.289> it<00:00:19.439> so<00:00:20.070> as<00:00:20.250> you<00:00:20.430> can<00:00:20.550> see

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:20.610 
made change to it so as you can see

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:23.540 
made change to it so as you can see
these<00:00:20.970> things<00:00:21.210> are<00:00:21.590> protection<00:00:22.590> so<00:00:23.160> when<00:00:23.430> it

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
these things are protection so when it

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.279 
these things are protection so when it
falls<00:00:23.760> it<00:00:24.119> doesn't<00:00:24.449> it<00:00:24.720> doesn't<00:00:25.080> hit<00:00:25.170> the

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
falls it doesn't it doesn't hit the

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.980 
falls it doesn't it doesn't hit the
switch<00:00:25.530> and<00:00:25.770> then<00:00:25.949> power<00:00:26.190> off<00:00:26.400> okay<00:00:27.029> so<00:00:27.779> that's

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
switch and then power off okay so that's

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.080 
switch and then power off okay so that's
one<00:00:28.199> and<00:00:28.440> I<00:00:28.949> also<00:00:29.039> made<00:00:29.310> a<00:00:29.340> bit<00:00:29.550> of<00:00:29.640> cushion<00:00:30.000> is

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
one and I also made a bit of cushion is

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.930 
one and I also made a bit of cushion is
here<00:00:30.330> so<00:00:30.869> that<00:00:31.050> when<00:00:31.470> it<00:00:31.619> goes<00:00:32.279> down<00:00:32.550> it<00:00:32.759> does

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
here so that when it goes down it does

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.970 
here so that when it goes down it does
not<00:00:33.149> hit<00:00:33.539> the<00:00:33.600> server<00:00:33.989> so<00:00:34.320> it<00:00:34.410> can't<00:00:34.620> protect

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
not hit the server so it can't protect

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.169 
not hit the server so it can't protect
the<00:00:35.699> robot<00:00:36.440> so<00:00:37.440> this<00:00:37.589> is<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:37.979> type<00:00:38.370> C<00:00:38.699> robot

00:00:39.169 --> 00:00:39.179 
the robot so this is the type C robot

00:00:39.179 --> 00:00:42.590 
the robot so this is the type C robot
with<00:00:39.449> the<00:00:39.800> gripper<00:00:40.800> and<00:00:41.129> you<00:00:41.940> notice<00:00:42.300> I<00:00:42.539> put

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
with the gripper and you notice I put

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.719 
with the gripper and you notice I put
some<00:00:43.170> screws<00:00:43.589> here<00:00:43.829> so<00:00:44.039> it<00:00:44.159> can<00:00:44.280> help<00:00:44.460> you<00:00:44.579> to

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:44.729 
some screws here so it can help you to

00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:47.930 
some screws here so it can help you to
grab<00:00:44.999> something<00:00:45.420> more<00:00:45.719> tightly<00:00:46.729> and<00:00:47.729> that's

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
grab something more tightly and that's

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.599 
grab something more tightly and that's
updated<00:00:48.239> effective<00:00:48.960> I'll<00:00:49.949> put<00:00:50.159> in<00:00:50.249> the<00:00:50.339> extra

00:00:50.599 --> 00:00:50.609 
updated effective I'll put in the extra

00:00:50.609 --> 00:00:53.419 
updated effective I'll put in the extra
big<00:00:50.879> battery<00:00:51.269> so<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.199> battery<00:00:52.589> it's<00:00:53.129> pretty

00:00:53.419 --> 00:00:53.429 
big battery so the battery it's pretty

00:00:53.429 --> 00:00:55.520 
big battery so the battery it's pretty
big<00:00:53.579> so<00:00:53.850> first<00:00:54.629> of<00:00:54.780> all<00:00:54.899> when<00:00:55.109> you<00:00:55.199> turn<00:00:55.379> it<00:00:55.440> on

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
big so first of all when you turn it on

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.829 
big so first of all when you turn it on
I've<00:00:55.829> got<00:00:56.039> this<00:00:56.190> function<00:00:56.760> here<00:00:56.940> which<00:00:57.539> will

00:00:57.829 --> 00:00:57.839 
I've got this function here which will

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:00.529 
I've got this function here which will
help<00:00:58.079> we've<00:00:58.620> got<00:00:58.769> a<00:00:58.799> gyroscope<00:00:59.539> and

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
help we've got a gyroscope and

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.759 
help we've got a gyroscope and
everything<00:01:01.379> helps<00:01:01.769> the<00:01:01.949> robot<00:01:02.459> from

00:01:03.759 --> 00:01:03.769 
everything helps the robot from

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:07.070 
everything helps the robot from
balancing<00:01:04.769> so<00:01:05.190> if<00:01:05.339> I<00:01:05.489> I've<00:01:06.330> got<00:01:06.540> control<00:01:06.750> you

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
balancing so if I I've got control you

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.590 
balancing so if I I've got control you
could<00:01:07.260> press<00:01:08.010> this<00:01:08.160> switch<00:01:08.280> to<00:01:09.000> turn<00:01:09.180> it<00:01:09.210> off

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
could press this switch to turn it off

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.070 
could press this switch to turn it off
so<00:01:10.310> normally<00:01:11.310> if<00:01:11.340> you<00:01:11.490> do<00:01:11.670> that<00:01:11.940> it<00:01:12.810> will<00:01:12.870> fall

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
so normally if you do that it will fall

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.330 
so normally if you do that it will fall
down<00:01:13.230> you<00:01:14.100> can<00:01:14.220> see<00:01:14.540> so<00:01:15.540> for<00:01:15.960> down<00:01:16.110> if<00:01:17.040> I<00:01:17.130> turn

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
down you can see so for down if I turn

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.640 
down you can see so for down if I turn
it<00:01:17.430> on<00:01:19.550> it<00:01:20.550> will<00:01:20.610> not<00:01:20.790> fall<00:01:21.150> down<00:01:21.270> and<00:01:22.260> the

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
it on it will not fall down and the

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.110 
it on it will not fall down and the
advantage<00:01:22.980> of<00:01:23.130> doing<00:01:23.220> this<00:01:23.370> is<00:01:23.640> when<00:01:23.850> you<00:01:23.940> go

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:24.120 
advantage of doing this is when you go

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.900 
advantage of doing this is when you go
into<00:01:24.150> a<00:01:24.600> new<00:01:24.960> environment<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.770> floor<00:01:26.610> may<00:01:26.760> not

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:26.910 
into a new environment the floor may not

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:28.700 
into a new environment the floor may not
be<00:01:27.030> flat<00:01:27.330> and<00:01:27.570> that<00:01:27.750> really<00:01:27.990> helps<00:01:28.320> you<00:01:28.440> to

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
be flat and that really helps you to

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.210 
be flat and that really helps you to
prevent<00:01:29.250> it<00:01:29.340> from<00:01:29.370> falling<00:01:29.670> down<00:01:31.040> okay<00:01:32.040> if<00:01:32.130> I

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
prevent it from falling down okay if I

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:40.550 
prevent it from falling down okay if I
do<00:01:32.430> this<00:01:35.060> out<00:01:38.180> so<00:01:39.180> what<00:01:39.360> I<00:01:39.390> do<00:01:39.570> is<00:01:39.720> like<00:01:39.900> if<00:01:40.050> I<00:01:40.170> do

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
do this out so what I do is like if I do

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:55.340 
do this out so what I do is like if I do
I<00:01:40.590> -<00:01:43.820> so<00:01:44.820> if<00:01:45.090> someone<00:01:45.150> hits<00:01:45.570> it

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:02.459 

and<00:01:56.350> what<00:01:56.500> else<00:01:56.649> we<00:01:56.799> can<00:01:56.950> do<00:01:57.159> is<00:01:57.369> I<00:02:01.110> cut<00:02:02.110> us<00:02:02.229> off

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:02.469 
and what else we can do is I cut us off

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:03.630 
and what else we can do is I cut us off
okay

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
okay

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:31.309 
okay
let's<00:02:03.850> say<00:02:03.969> fall<00:02:04.179> down<00:02:04.390> I<00:02:04.659> press<00:02:05.560> the<00:02:05.679> switch

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:35.100 

press<00:02:32.319> this<00:02:32.500> we<00:02:33.130> turn<00:02:33.340> left<00:02:33.959> and<00:02:34.959> I<00:02:35.079> just

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
press this we turn left and I just

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:40.170 
press this we turn left and I just
princess<00:02:36.040> ships<00:02:36.819> all<00:02:37.000> right<00:02:38.099> okay<00:02:39.180> actually

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180

quite quick okay

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:47.640 
quite quick okay
and<00:02:43.799> I<00:02:44.799> also<00:02:45.459> got<00:02:45.819> spill<00:02:46.269> mode<00:02:46.540> so<00:02:47.319> I've<00:02:47.440> got

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
and I also got spill mode so I've got

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.470 
and I also got spill mode so I've got
the<00:02:47.769> right<00:02:47.980> mode<00:02:48.250> so<00:02:48.549> if<00:02:48.670> I<00:02:48.730> press<00:02:48.910> this<00:02:49.239> and

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480

right it turned to the right mode and

00:02:51.849 --> 00:03:05.780 
right it turned to the right mode and
then<00:02:52.599> this<00:02:52.780> will<00:02:53.049> have<00:02:53.370> different<00:02:54.370> effects<00:02:54.790> so

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.000 

now<00:03:06.790> this<00:03:07.090> is<00:03:07.540> effective<00:03:08.200> but<00:03:08.440> they<00:03:08.560> also<00:03:08.739> got

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
now this is effective but they also got

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:10.410 
now this is effective but they also got
his<00:03:09.130> disadvantage<00:03:09.430> I<00:03:09.940> should<00:03:10.180> make<00:03:10.299> this

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
his disadvantage I should make this

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.500 
his disadvantage I should make this
quicker<00:03:10.690> so<00:03:11.470> that<00:03:11.500> one<00:03:12.430> of<00:03:12.459> the<00:03:12.670> I<00:03:13.030> actually

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
quicker so that one of the I actually

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.250 
quicker so that one of the I actually
took<00:03:14.470> had<00:03:15.160> to<00:03:15.459> knock<00:03:16.000> down<00:03:16.269> of<00:03:16.750> the<00:03:16.900> opponent

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
took had to knock down of the opponent

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.920 
took had to knock down of the opponent
using<00:03:17.470> this<00:03:17.620> action<00:03:18.370> but<00:03:19.150> with<00:03:19.540> the<00:03:19.690> bigger

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
using this action but with the bigger

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.740 
using this action but with the bigger
robot<00:03:20.319> when<00:03:20.980> I<00:03:21.010> missed<00:03:21.280> the<00:03:22.239> other<00:03:22.359> robot

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
robot when I missed the other robot

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:24.030 
robot when I missed the other robot
actually<00:03:22.900> attacked<00:03:23.350> me<00:03:23.530> while<00:03:23.709> I<00:03:23.769> was<00:03:23.889> doing

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
actually attacked me while I was doing

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.580 
actually attacked me while I was doing
that<00:03:24.190> action<00:03:24.579> so<00:03:24.609> it's<00:03:24.790> not<00:03:24.880> very<00:03:25.090> good<00:03:25.590> and

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
that action so it's not very good and

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.340 
that action so it's not very good and
this<00:03:26.769> is<00:03:27.269> so<00:03:28.269> this<00:03:28.299> is<00:03:28.450> when<00:03:28.690> someone<00:03:28.959> texts

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:29.350 
this is so this is when someone texts

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:30.690 
this is so this is when someone texts
you<00:03:29.440> you<00:03:29.560> grab<00:03:29.799> onto<00:03:30.040> it<00:03:30.220> and<00:03:30.310> then<00:03:30.400> you<00:03:30.489> flip

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
you you grab onto it and then you flip

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:38.220 
you you grab onto it and then you flip
it<00:03:30.850> down<00:03:31.000> so<00:03:31.840> fort<00:03:32.200> mode

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:48.700 

selection<00:03:39.230> and<00:03:40.130> I<00:03:40.370> have<00:03:40.550> the<00:03:40.640> back<00:03:41.060> mode<00:03:47.710> okay

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:48.710 
selection and I have the back mode okay

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:53.260 
selection and I have the back mode okay
so<00:03:51.130> actually<00:03:52.130> the<00:03:52.370> same<00:03:52.550> time<00:03:52.760> very<00:03:52.790> quickly

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:53.270 
so actually the same time very quickly

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:59.140 
so actually the same time very quickly
very<00:03:56.140> quickly
