00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:05.819
 platoon well the surprise for a title 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.680
 such a new ip was great 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.929
 from nintendo and not a recycling of the usual ones 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.139
 known but above all a shooter game 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.849
 with different mechanics the platoon 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.220
 in fact the goal will not be just that 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.650
 to pardon to inking the enemies 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.570
 but fill in as many ink 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.189
 possible points on the map to get 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.170
 domination and therefore victory over 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.490
 our opponent 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:28.470
 although the game has been very popular 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.449
 right from the start aroused some 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.610
 criticism as nintendo believes of 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.200
 having generated a new kind of game e 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.780
 therefore not comparable to a sphere 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.520
 all normal yet we remember ways 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.649
 similar in bomberman with the mode 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.629
 color domain or mode 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.550
 graffiti of tony hawk's pro skater in 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.829
 which dominated the skatepark by coloring the 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.719
 objects on which you pass despite 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.670
 the cartoonish and very colorful appearance 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.739
 for obvious reasons splat 1 hides a 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.210
 frantic game and full action given 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.949
 that the term shooter will be 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.680
 actually guessed we should 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.239
 shoot everything not forgetting that in 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.980
 almost all modes the goal is 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.539
 just that not just to succeed at 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.920
 win also to adopt strategies 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.930
 different from those we are 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.030
 used to how many characters i 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.010
 so-called inkling boy is in clinker 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.780
 they will have the chance to transform themselves 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.369
 in squid and dip in the ink 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.850
 of the color belonging to its own 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.140
 team 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.970
 in this way we can recharge 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.009
 the ink to shoot will become 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.750
 invisible to the opponent we will speed up 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.070
 our movement but above all 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.049
 It would be able to reach points 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.280
 of the map otherwise unattainable 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.229
 since the movement we can 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.729
 performing will not only be flat but also 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.619
 vertical so it wo n't be a problem 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.750
 reach high points or hardly 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.939
 present in the game are present 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.439
 single player and multiplayer modes 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:40.380
 the latter will generally be 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:42.240
 made up of challenges 44 and with pleasure 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.860
 from the first matches you can 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.390
 to account that actually 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.860
 strategies to be adopted to bring the 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.780
 own team to victory not 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.950
 belong to other shooters like 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.990
 for example, worrying about 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.240
 color conditions of the factor map 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.740
 main and secondly try to 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.000
 cut off connections to opponents 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.009
 that could easily be done 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.719
 our ranks need just one 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.100
 color stripe noted and the 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.240
 match could suffer quick 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.829
 change 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.140
 it must be said however that despite a 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:09.539
 fresh and very pleasant gameplay 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.250
 the big n is still a bit young in the 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:14.980
 delicate relationship between the offer 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:18.010
 competitive as he said at 3 is the side 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.960
 online indeed a serious lack that 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.760
 takes away many asp points from the tour e 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:23.080
 the absence of a voice chat from 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.070
 extreme importance in a game of 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.540
 gender 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:27.190
 we hope that in the future we return to the 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.800
 issue with some updates that 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.480
 we always consider it necessary to talk about 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.860
 several updates are coming 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.900
 especially in the coming weeks 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.220
 as far as objects are concerned 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.959
 by playing online we could increase 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.000
 the experience in our character e 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:41.470
 do it as you level up together 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.420
 at the level we can also earn 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.250
 money for our portfolio through 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.050
 which we can buy new clothes 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.130
 or weapons, or better yet, to improve 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:49.870
 weapons in our possession 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:51.610
 clothes will not only give us a touch 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.350
 aesthetic to differentiate themselves from others 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:55.239
 players but will serve to give us gods 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:56.950
 special tastes such as damage 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:58.660
 higher in the phoenix ink 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:01.360
 more ink in our reserve 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:03.250
 higher speed range of the weapon or even 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.300
 shorter respawn times going 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.010
 forward with the level of your own 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.480
 character we will always get approaches 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.250
 new to the game as each 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.690
 character will be customized based 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:12.459
 to the needs of the player 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.500
 yet we should be stupid to get used to 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:15.820
 use different sets and different weapons 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.870
 since each level can be 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:19.299
 played best with the right 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.620
 equipment although a splat is 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:22.660
 born essentially to be played 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:25.060
 offline mode in multiplayer too 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:26.650
 does its part despite the slow e 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.090
 simple start that could do it 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.220
 see it as a great tutorial 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.290
 proceeding with history , things are 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:34.150
 they will do more and more complex even if the 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:34.989
 degree of difficulty will never be too much 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.730
 high 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:38.410
 nevertheless many will be found 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:40.870
 interesting new ideas that will make 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:42.519
 splat 1 a very special game 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.320
 even the same boss fight that there 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:46.360
 we will find ourselves facing will not be gods 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:48.459
 simple shoots shoots but some of them 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:50.799
 will require a minimum of strategy for 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:52.840
 effectively pass the level for 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:54.970
 splat un have been made tra nivo 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.980
 the klinges of both sexes and the call 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:58.989
 macaroon though their price 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:01.030
 at present it is practically the 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:02.500
 double a friend of super smash it 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:04.930
 talk about 30 euros 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:07.090
 the NFC figurines will give us access to 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:08.950
 dedicated friend missions but it will be 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:10.390
 of missions particularly equal to 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:12.549
 those provided in offline mode 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:14.350
 simple with the difference we can 

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:16.419
 customize weapons or somehow 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:18.940
 we will be able to face them differently 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:19.570
 the real strength of platoon lies in the 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:21.540
 aesthetics 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:23.160
 starting from the fulcrum of splat 1 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:24.510
 for everything up to the 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.970
 musical and aesthetic style of each 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:28.740
 character the feeling given is unique 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:30.570
 seems to be in Tokyo 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:32.340
 where all in unison decide to 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:33.930
 kill yourself with ink strokes the 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:35.460
 same platoon main square is 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:37.560
 directly inspired by the neighborhood of 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:40.020
 shibuya in japan with its stripes 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:42.120
 white pass of many people shops 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:44.640
 illuminated boards and other details 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:46.530
 finally concluding with neckline 

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:48.480
 nintendo I bring a new ip and for the 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:49.290
 first time dedicated mainly to 

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:50.730
 multiplayer 

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:52.080
 although there is still a lot to do 

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:53.760
 mainly improve a 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:56.310
 better balance of weapons and the 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:57.720
 lack of essential audio chat though 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:59.910
 we want to make platoon a game more 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:01.530
 at present mature remains very much 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:03.510
 fun due to its playful nature and 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:05.490
 casinara but at present it is 

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:07.140
 impossible to sketch strategies of 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:08.760
 group unless there is a tacit 

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:11.280
 agreement between teammates 

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:13.530
 the maps are not very many and unfortunately 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:14.580
 will become repetitive in the long run but 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:16.800
 fortunately they were announced 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:18.570
 lots of free dlc coming to 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:20.490
 very short and therefore with much 

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:22.110
 probability there will be the possibility of 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:24.270
 vary the game further and 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:26.850
 make it always different and one of the 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:28.470
 goals that nintendo are stability every 

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:30.330
 mode present in the game will be 

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:31.230
 nice to play both online and in 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.910
 single 

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:35.070
 none fortunately prevails 

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:37.200
 on the other we will have different modes of 

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:39.030
 game regarding online visas 

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:41.280
 tetra simple match and others instead 

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:43.170
 classified with appropriate methods 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:45.180
 we will have a sort of king of the hill 

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:47.550
 then inking the dot of 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:49.440
 interest or control of the tower where 

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:50.730
 we will have to take and escort one 

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:54.150
 tower in the center of the map 

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:55.680
 towards the base of the enemy platoon shows 

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:57.090
 a style of play different from the schemes 

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:59.010
 third shooter classics 

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:00.900
 person but still needs some 

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:03.180
 update regarding bat 

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:04.920
 weapon balance contents e 

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:06.889
 above all a solution to make up for 

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:08.870
 the absence of an online voice chat 

00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:11.270
 for today by france and marco it is 

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:15.219
 we will meet again at the next video 

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:15.219
 hello and remember everyone
