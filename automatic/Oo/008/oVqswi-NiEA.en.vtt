00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:41.080 
for not practical purposes but some of

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.620 
for not practical purposes but some of
its<00:03:41.230> just<00:03:41.320> because<00:03:41.590> I<00:03:41.620> like<00:03:41.980> you<00:03:42.700> know<00:03:42.820> it<00:03:43.120> it

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
aesthetics but it's always got a really

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:50.250 
aesthetics but it's always got a really
match<00:03:48.580> up<00:03:48.820> with<00:03:49.000> whatever<00:03:49.540> theme<00:03:49.780> it<00:03:49.930> is<00:03:49.959> and
