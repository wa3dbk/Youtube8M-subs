00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.580
 good as many know and I do not know what we do not get the result 

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:08.029
 of power to plan the folder in tax 2 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:10.039
 many times it is useful 

00:00:10.039 --> 00:00:14.400
 or some of us like to have some folder we use a lot because we open 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.279
 often 

00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:18.869
 went mad 2012 to get faster access to it 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.640
 this time he is demonstrating a small chip to be able to do it without 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.909
 no problem what is attacked 

00:00:26.909 --> 00:00:31.109
 pretending to be an exe file that will simply give us a route 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:34.970
 happened he does not quote the folder of my documents 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:39.260
 or to any folder x that we want 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.560
 let's create a new folder called folders 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.120
 when marcelo mosset 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.290
 in my case I want to do things just let's access it and 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:50.500
 we go 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.450
 dictates the toolbar by clicking the pan 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.790
 and the folder options tools 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:59.230
 to the option see 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:02.690
 and from this option we will go to anger 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:07.000
 down to where it says to hide the exemptions of goat fascism of assets 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.140
 well-known pilots are unmarked we have accepted oak and dental caries 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.050
 and once we're just going to click right again 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:19.120
 and we are going to create a new text document 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:22.820
 to forgiveness let's go then with the name the aterpe techniques I want it to be the 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.790
 jail you download 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:27.590
 we hope to double 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.050
 po downloads 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:31.380
 and we want it good will be to change it 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.140
 the file exemption 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:34.880
 which by default 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.510
 point that exists 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:42.310
 we will change it corp the extension point exists or is the executable 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:46.210
 two days and that they do not look for the essential one we will give in itself 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:51.090
 and once done that will put an exe file with any kind of facts 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.370
 co 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:55.370
 commands that I'm happy some 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.209
 what I love doing now is clear this team c 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.970
 we will cross the satiety 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:06.140
 and it will not have any functionality 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.539
 but all of you late 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:13.169
 interest rates are known dollar leading properties 

00:02:13.779 --> 00:02:17.889
 in the exit to your own from Baghdad and now we will go to the folder that 

00:02:17.889 --> 00:02:19.839
 defect we want we were given 

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:21.429
 from the covers 

00:02:21.429 --> 00:02:23.279
 we will be in my house and mission 

00:02:23.279 --> 00:02:24.749
 discharge 

00:02:24.749 --> 00:02:26.289
 we give properties 

00:02:26.289 --> 00:02:29.449
 that themselves to the location part 

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:31.379
 and we are going to take the route 

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:33.179
 Access to the folder 

00:02:33.179 --> 00:02:35.649
 that is, c gonzÃ¡lez 

00:02:35.649 --> 00:02:37.799
 i everything else 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:39.399
 it looks like 

00:02:39.399 --> 00:02:42.399
 well once taken by how to do that fate 

00:02:42.929 --> 00:02:47.229
 of the direct access of the unusable lecce that teconsa is not priced 

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:51.419
 the destination we are going to paste what is the location of the donato folder 

00:02:51.419 --> 00:02:52.299
 downloads 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:56.179
 i in that area let's hit a mind 

00:02:56.179 --> 00:03:01.689
 we're going to execute as per your topics this standard maximized or minimized and a 

00:03:01.689 --> 00:03:05.359
 Once this is done we are going to change the parish a bit by changing the icon 

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:06.709
 one more pleasant 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:09.709
 p finished in our wish to sell and two images 

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:14.319
 the any other goat and with my case I will 

00:03:15.089 --> 00:03:18.429
 put a customized file 

00:03:18.429 --> 00:03:21.569
 from a folder what a lesson format tico 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:25.129
 we went 

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:27.039
 the captain oscar 

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:30.039
 percent deaths 

00:03:35.169 --> 00:03:38.359
 - Whatever we do, the Democrats are going 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:44.649
 doing that we already have what it looks like on the cover and with the file path 

00:03:44.649 --> 00:03:48.909
 or of folders that we add a shattered country on the coast 

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:50.569
 hundreds this sword 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:54.120
 two debates that in my case is the one that will determine for this folder 

00:03:55.449 --> 00:04:00.099
 this is the simplest way to anchor the folder what the tattoo fabric of the 

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:01.609
 cervin sheep 

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:04.609
 and well I hope you showed them this little windows ce lie 

00:04:05.429 --> 00:04:08.539
 and we're going up to next percent virtue
