00:00:19.919 --> 00:00:19.929 
with the JVC cameras seems a little

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:23.609 
with the JVC cameras seems a little
limited<00:00:20.470> compared<00:00:20.919> to<00:00:21.179> Sony's<00:00:22.439> version<00:00:23.439> which

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:27.160 
is already a version 2.7 so I would

can overwrite that and use the Sony

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:48.960 
can overwrite that and use the Sony
version<00:01:47.530> if<00:01:47.650> you'd<00:01:47.830> like<00:01:47.980> but<00:01:48.610> for<00:01:48.760> the<00:01:48.850> moment

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:48.970 
version if you'd like but for the moment

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:51.870 
version if you'd like but for the moment
I'm<00:01:49.180> going<00:01:49.330> to<00:01:49.420> leave<00:01:49.600> the<00:01:49.750> JVC<00:01:50.200> version<00:01:50.880> and

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
I'm going to leave the JVC version and

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.030 
I'm going to leave the JVC version and
they<00:01:52.150> should<00:01:52.330> both<00:01:52.450> work<00:01:52.780> either<00:01:53.050> way<00:01:53.290> I

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:54.040 
they should both work either way I

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.180 
they should both work either way I
assume<00:01:54.580> since<00:01:55.180> both<00:01:55.990> cameras<00:01:56.470> record<00:01:56.920> all<00:01:57.160> of

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:57.190 
assume since both cameras record all of

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:58.800 
assume since both cameras record all of
the<00:01:57.400> same<00:01:57.580> formats<00:01:58.090> that<00:01:58.390> it<00:01:58.510> won't<00:01:58.660> make<00:01:58.750> a

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
the same formats that it won't make a

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.250 
the same formats that it won't make a
difference<00:01:58.900> but<00:01:59.890> I<00:02:00.460> would<00:02:01.300> for<00:02:01.900> the<00:02:01.960> moment

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:02.260 
difference but I would for the moment

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.560 
difference but I would for the moment
I'm<00:02:02.350> just<00:02:02.380> going<00:02:02.800> to<00:02:02.860> deselect<00:02:03.520> that<00:02:03.790> and

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
I'm just going to deselect that and

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.810 
I'm just going to deselect that and
that's<00:02:05.140> in<00:02:05.350> the<00:02:05.470> custom<00:02:05.980> install<00:02:06.280> and<00:02:06.670> now<00:02:06.760> I

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:06.820 
that's in the custom install and now I

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:15.600 
that's in the custom install and now I
can<00:02:07.030> say<00:02:07.240> install<00:02:13.560> great<00:02:14.560> when<00:02:15.040> that's<00:02:15.220> done

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
can say install great when that's done

codecs<00:02:41.140> are<00:02:41.380> are<00:02:41.620> installed<00:02:42.810> so<00:02:43.810> we'll<00:02:43.900> just

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:44.020 
codecs are are installed so we'll just

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:49.290 
codecs are are installed so we'll just
click<00:02:44.230> OK<00:02:45.239> ok<00:02:46.239> so<00:02:47.050> now<00:02:47.320> Sony<00:02:48.280> software<00:02:48.970> has

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:49.300 
click OK ok so now Sony software has

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:52.350 
click OK ok so now Sony software has
automatically<00:02:50.170> read<00:02:51.010> the<00:02:51.340> card<00:02:51.640> that<00:02:52.060> is

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
automatically read the card that is

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:57.150 
automatically read the card that is
installed<00:02:53.230> and<00:02:55.440> it's<00:02:56.440> a<00:02:56.530> much<00:02:56.680> simpler

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
installed and it's a much simpler

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.699 
installed and it's a much simpler
looking<00:02:57.340> interface<00:02:57.970> let's<00:02:58.750> just<00:02:58.989> expand<00:02:59.530> it

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
looking interface let's just expand it

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:04.620 
looking interface let's just expand it
full<00:02:59.950> size<00:03:00.160> here<00:03:00.930> so<00:03:01.930> now<00:03:02.860> as<00:03:03.280> we<00:03:03.390> click<00:03:04.390> on

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:04.630 
full size here so now as we click on

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:09.650 
full size here so now as we click on
these<00:03:04.840> clips<00:03:07.110> we<00:03:08.110> can<00:03:08.380> see<00:03:08.620> all<00:03:08.860> of<00:03:08.890> this

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
these clips we can see all of this

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:17.610 
these clips we can see all of this
metadata<00:03:10.660> over<00:03:11.080> here<00:03:14.400> and<00:03:15.540> we<00:03:16.540> can<00:03:16.660> change<00:03:16.930> the

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
metadata over here and we can change the

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.130 
metadata over here and we can change the
names<00:03:18.400> of<00:03:18.730> these<00:03:18.850> clips<00:03:19.239> so<00:03:19.510> essentially<00:03:20.019> we

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
names of these clips so essentially we

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.979 
names of these clips so essentially we
can<00:03:20.610> log<00:03:21.610> them<00:03:21.820> we<00:03:21.940> have<00:03:22.030> full<00:03:22.510> logging

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989 
can log them we have full logging

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:26.790 
can log them we have full logging
abilities<00:03:23.860> here<00:03:24.220> as<00:03:24.400> well<00:03:25.410> this<00:03:26.410> is<00:03:26.590> just

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:26.800 
abilities here as well this is just

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.130 
abilities here as well this is just
really<00:03:26.950> great<00:03:27.160> it's<00:03:27.459> a<00:03:27.730> huge<00:03:28.450> step<00:03:28.720> up<00:03:28.930> from

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.140 
really great it's a huge step up from

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:32.070 
really great it's a huge step up from
the<00:03:29.230> clip<00:03:29.980> manager<00:03:30.430> that<00:03:30.610> ships<00:03:30.880> with<00:03:31.209> the<00:03:31.239> JVC

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:32.080 
the clip manager that ships with the JVC

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:37.110 
the clip manager that ships with the JVC
cameras<00:03:32.580> and<00:03:34.050> of<00:03:35.050> course<00:03:35.290> we<00:03:35.560> can<00:03:35.739> also<00:03:36.120> wrap

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
cameras and of course we can also wrap

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.050 
cameras and of course we can also wrap
all<00:03:37.540> of<00:03:37.900> these<00:03:38.019> MP<00:03:38.380> fours<00:03:38.680> into<00:03:39.579> QuickTime

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 
all of these MP fours into QuickTime

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.390 
all of these MP fours into QuickTime
so<00:03:41.390> that<00:03:41.630> instead<00:03:42.560> of<00:03:42.680> using<00:03:42.860> the<00:03:43.069> log<00:03:43.250> and

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 
so that instead of using the log and

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.550 
so that instead of using the log and
transfer<00:03:43.630> utility<00:03:44.630> in<00:03:44.690> Final<00:03:44.990> Cut<00:03:45.050> Pro<00:03:45.170> if

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:50.300 
shot some stuff on mp4 well you can wrap

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:53.050 
shot some stuff on mp4 well you can wrap
them<00:03:50.540> in<00:03:50.660> this<00:03:50.840> in<00:03:51.410> this<00:03:51.620> free<00:03:51.800> program<00:03:52.060> so
