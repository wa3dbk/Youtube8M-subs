00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.700
 Hi guys, I'm in the video today, I'm going 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.470
 show my areas again I know that 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.219
 Are you tired of seeing hours and such? 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:14.790
 but I'll show here normally use 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.470
 of the jump lane but was with 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.609
 too lazy to party here then I 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.180
 I did it elsewhere. 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:24.240
 usually use a dressage track 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:27.800
 There are some people strolling, I stay. 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:34.190
 taking a walk with some horses 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:39.030
 here is a clue discovered 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:43.110
 totally discovered even for fear of 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:45.210
 start to rain women but anyway good 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.219
 the work now here the main base 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:55.440
 of the areas is that one day left all 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:57.410
 horses get it out of here and put an end to 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:01.609
 all horses 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:03.449
 here I put all the leggings 

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:06.830
 all networks 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:10.080
 I need to buy the exact medicine 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:12.180
 here all the cells and here I do not have 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.760
 name of each of the horses the day I 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.549
 I bought and race because I only lose that 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:20.330
 big bank note inside know each other 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.020
 If I lose that book, I'll kill myself. 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:26.549
 bonn 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:29.430
 This is where the cello they are here. 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.560
 waiting for the date to arrive here have these 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:36.030
 two having broken paw 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:37.409
 unfortunately I leave them here or 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.600
 separate stable 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:44.479
 look here're a mess but I'll 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:46.920
 show me where I keep everything 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:51.060
 just bought a stock I think 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:53.520
 things are too much to learn the doll in the 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.950
 horse and how to decorate the mane of 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.260
 of the net at the time of the attack 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:01.020
 and in those early 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.640
 It's just the good thing I keep here. 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.790
 All I know is that it's messy but I 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.890
 I was too lazy to store here 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.960
 if I may be right, I mean 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:13.770
 carrot 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:16.520
 anyway whatever you want it to 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:25.530
 spread at the time of the attack 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:29.610
 Ok, come on, I've got the pickets. 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:35.090
 I only let out a few horses because I made the 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:39.720
 racetrack here today for laziness 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:41.250

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:47.960
