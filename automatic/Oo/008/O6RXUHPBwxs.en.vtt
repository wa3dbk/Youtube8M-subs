you<00:01:19.920> can<00:01:20.040> either<00:01:20.190> use<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.550> depth<00:01:20.940> of<00:01:21.000> field

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210

lens down the aperture you've just said
and<00:01:31.579> you<00:01:31.670> need<00:01:31.820> to<00:01:31.909> carefully<00:01:32.119> check<00:01:32.509> the

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
find that the viewfinder gets pretty

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.380 
find that the viewfinder gets pretty
dark<00:01:39.229> so<00:01:40.100> it<00:01:40.220> can<00:01:40.340> be<00:01:40.490> difficult<00:01:40.580> to<00:01:41.000> clearly

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
see whether they're sharp or not so it's

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.359 
see whether they're sharp or not so it's
often<00:01:45.110> much<00:01:45.320> easier<00:01:45.710> to<00:01:45.830> see<00:01:45.979> the<00:01:46.100> effect

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369 
often much easier to see the effect

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:48.310 
often much easier to see the effect
using<00:01:46.729> live<00:01:47.030> view<00:01:47.390> rather<00:01:47.990> than<00:01:48.140> the
