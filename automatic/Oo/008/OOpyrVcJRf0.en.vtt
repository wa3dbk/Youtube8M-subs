00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:11.309
 smartphones android with two chips as 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.860
 practically any model of the line 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:16.560
 optimus l2 of lg have become quite 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.270
 common then how about 3 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.100
 if the user wants if the cell with 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.170
 three or more chips would have to run to 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.000
 very basic models at that time 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.140
 in which we did not even worry about the 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.529
 operating system of our 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.480
 smartphones great 042 fills this 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.700
 niche market bringing the android 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.760
 relatively good space for 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.200
 three chips and support for digital television 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.420
 It's okay that the result is not there so 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.610
 The model has a basic face that has 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.440
 12mm thick is one of the 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.930
 androids we saw out there 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.059
 and this combined with the screen 3.8 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.250
 inches and zoom has a model with good 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.960
 ergonomics and with only one hand is 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.809
 possible to touch all points of the 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:58.710
 display the screen by the way is not the best with 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:00.690
 320 480 resolution and ips technology 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.859
 but for the basic model it does not 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.780
 disappoint 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.970
 the settings are the same as the 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.490
 optimus alive 52 model a little more 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.610
 advanced lg processor mediatek 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:16.560
 single core of 1ghz 512 megabytes of 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:18.030
 ram and gpu powervr rs gx 531 for 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.740
 who is accustomed to using only 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.750
 one application at a time 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.700
 a rarity these days he 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.950
 showed little gagging and even rolling 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.090
 games a bit more advanced but this one 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.750
 not the model for those who like 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.579
 multitasking with only one core and 512 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.650
 megabytes of ram memory to switch from 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:37.020
 applications is a little time consuming as it was 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:40.409
 the rear camera is the 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.659
 of the optimus l 3 2 with only 3.2 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:45.149
 megapixels capable of recording videos with 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.770
 quality is enough for a 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.680
 basic experience and for photos of the 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.240
 and there is no front - facing camera . 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.240
 rest he has what is expected of a 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:58.890
 basic model the r4 2 has gps with 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:00.630
 gps bluetooth 3.0 radio fm 4 gb of 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.070
 internal memory of which only 2 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.799
 gigabytes are available for the 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:07.079
 and even supporting three chips is 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:09.720
 possible to have only a 3g network 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:11.340
 optimus l 4 2 can be found by 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.660
 about 500 reais 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.590
 It's a worthwhile investment. 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.209
 only 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.129
 do you make a point of support and three 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:18.900
 chips and digital television 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:20.129
 if you do the same value is 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.290
 you can find models with 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:25.230
 specifications a little better as 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.250
 optimus l 5 2 that only supports two 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.140
 chips 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.180
