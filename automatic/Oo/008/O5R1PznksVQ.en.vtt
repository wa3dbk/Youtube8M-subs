my system at all since the last time I
didn't<00:05:27.090> work<00:05:27.240> but<00:05:28.230> I'm<00:05:28.380> thinking<00:05:28.980> I<00:05:29.310> don't

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:29.550 
didn't work but I'm thinking I don't

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:31.850 
didn't work but I'm thinking I don't
know<00:05:29.640> sometimes<00:05:30.540> I<00:05:30.840> have<00:05:30.870> programs<00:05:31.590> in<00:05:31.770> the

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:31.860 
know sometimes I have programs in the

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:35.660 
know sometimes I have programs in the
past<00:05:32.100> that<00:05:33.000> they<00:05:33.330> didn't<00:05:34.230> work<00:05:34.410> and<00:05:35.100> then<00:05:35.490> they

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:35.670 
past that they didn't work and then they

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:43.460 
past that they didn't work and then they
worked<00:05:36.410> when<00:05:37.410> I<00:05:37.440> am<00:05:39.950> when<00:05:40.950> I<00:05:42.230> you<00:05:43.230> know<00:05:43.260> I<00:05:43.380> just

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:43.470 
worked when I am when I you know I just

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:46.370 
worked when I am when I you know I just
left<00:05:43.770> it<00:05:43.919> really<00:05:44.160> so<00:05:45.150> here<00:05:45.330> is<00:05:45.540> very<00:05:45.870> fun<00:05:46.169> dance

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:46.380 
left it really so here is very fun dance

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:50.770 
left it really so here is very fun dance
I'm<00:05:47.390> back<00:05:48.650> it's<00:05:49.650> pretty<00:05:49.950> happy

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:50.780 
I'm back it's pretty happy

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:54.170 
I'm back it's pretty happy
definitely<00:05:51.830> ghost<00:05:52.830> film<00:05:53.460> or<00:05:53.610> technology

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:54.180 
definitely ghost film or technology

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:55.700 
definitely ghost film or technology
whatever<00:05:54.419> that<00:05:54.630> means<00:05:54.870> I<00:05:55.110> guess<00:05:55.260> it<00:05:55.410> cools

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:55.710 
whatever that means I guess it cools

00:05:55.710 --> 00:06:02.719 
whatever that means I guess it cools
better<00:05:55.950> and<00:05:56.460> it<00:05:57.330> has<00:05:57.480> to<00:05:58.470> DVI<00:05:59.100> and<00:06:01.610> money<00:06:02.610> is

00:06:02.719 --> 00:06:02.729 
better and it has to DVI and money is

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:05.090 
better and it has to DVI and money is
your<00:06:03.030> mind<00:06:03.240> another<00:06:03.810> one<00:06:04.050> I<00:06:04.080> thought<00:06:04.260> was<00:06:04.800> was

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:05.100

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:12.540 
on a display port and it's a double oh I

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:16.940 
on a display port and it's a double oh I
didn't<00:06:13.140> know<00:06:13.229> that<00:06:13.260> it's<00:06:14.220> a<00:06:14.340> double<00:06:14.900> slot<00:06:15.950> one

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:16.950 
didn't know that it's a double slot one

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:19.070 
didn't know that it's a double slot one
so<00:06:17.160> yeah<00:06:17.280> there<00:06:17.490> we<00:06:17.580> go<00:06:17.610> guys<00:06:17.850> is<00:06:18.180> the<00:06:18.630> unboxing
