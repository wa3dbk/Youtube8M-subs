sometimes<00:00:14.460> so<00:00:14.940> that's<00:00:15.719> why<00:00:15.900> I<00:00:15.929> kind<00:00:16.260> of

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
sometimes so that's why I kind of

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.410 
sometimes so that's why I kind of
switched<00:00:16.560> to<00:00:16.710> the<00:00:16.800> kitchen<00:00:17.190> so<00:00:17.940> even<00:00:18.390> though

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
switched to the kitchen so even though

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:19.939 
switched to the kitchen so even though
