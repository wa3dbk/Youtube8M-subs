video<00:00:06.120> as<00:00:06.390> I<00:00:06.480> said<00:00:06.750> before<00:00:06.779> we'll<00:00:07.440> be<00:00:07.589> creating

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
video as I said before we'll be creating

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.169 
video as I said before we'll be creating
a<00:00:08.010> nuts<00:00:08.309> and<00:00:08.460> not<00:00:09.269> holes<00:00:09.540> and<00:00:09.900> both<00:00:10.380> for<00:00:10.800> our

00:00:11.169 --> 00:00:11.179 
a nuts and not holes and both for our

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:15.919 
a nuts and not holes and both for our
them<00:00:12.179> so<00:00:13.610> let's<00:00:14.610> just<00:00:14.639> exit<00:00:15.150> go<00:00:15.509> to<00:00:15.570> the<00:00:15.750> top

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
them so let's just exit go to the top

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.950 
them so let's just exit go to the top
view<00:00:16.260> and<00:00:16.940> we're<00:00:17.940> going<00:00:18.119> to<00:00:18.150> begin<00:00:18.330> by

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
view and we're going to begin by

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.679 
view and we're going to begin by
creating<00:00:19.020> a<00:00:21.289> little<00:00:22.430> edges<00:00:23.430> meet<00:00:23.609> me<00:00:24.420> click<00:00:24.600> on

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
creating a little edges meet me click on

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.920 
creating a little edges meet me click on
that<00:00:24.980> are<00:00:25.980> now<00:00:26.220> cylinder<00:00:26.910> just<00:00:27.630> create<00:00:27.900> a

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
that are now cylinder just create a

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.730 
that are now cylinder just create a
little<00:00:28.289> cylinder<00:00:28.800> here<00:00:29.039> and<00:00:30.320> die<00:00:31.320> just<00:00:31.560> move

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
little cylinder here and die just move

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:38.450 
little cylinder here and die just move
that<00:00:31.920> up<00:00:35.270> something<00:00:36.270> like<00:00:36.300> so

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
that up something like so

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.260 
that up something like so
and<00:00:38.809> the<00:00:39.809> one<00:00:40.469> hit<00:00:40.649> alt<00:00:40.920> Q<00:00:41.219> for<00:00:41.460> isolation<00:00:41.940> mode

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
and the one hit alt Q for isolation mode

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.990 
and the one hit alt Q for isolation mode
just<00:00:42.690> clicked<00:00:43.050> said<00:00:43.469> to<00:00:43.800> zoom<00:00:43.980> that<00:00:44.190> in<00:00:44.430> want

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
just clicked said to zoom that in want

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.750 
just clicked said to zoom that in want
to<00:00:45.180> or<00:00:45.300> not<00:00:45.420> and<00:00:45.769> it's<00:00:46.769> actually<00:00:47.100> way<00:00:47.430> too<00:00:47.489> much

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
to or not and it's actually way too much

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.430 
to or not and it's actually way too much
geometry<00:00:48.269> so<00:00:48.600> just<00:00:49.470> do<00:00:49.620> that<00:00:49.850> and<00:00:51.379> go<00:00:52.379> to

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
geometry so just do that and go to

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.500 
geometry so just do that and go to
editable<00:00:52.829> poly<00:00:54.050> this<00:00:55.050> will<00:00:55.290> be<00:00:55.440> too<00:00:55.710> high<00:00:55.949> so

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510 
editable poly this will be too high so

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:03.110 
editable poly this will be too high so
need<00:00:57.510> to<00:00:57.540> scroll<00:00:58.530> oops<00:00:59.510> so<00:01:00.510> do<00:01:00.720> that<00:01:02.000> bring<00:01:03.000> it

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
need to scroll oops so do that bring it

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.190 
need to scroll oops so do that bring it
down<00:01:03.920> and<00:01:04.920> that<00:01:05.190> was<00:01:05.519> a<00:01:05.700> wrong<00:01:06.060> thing<00:01:06.119> to<00:01:06.390> do<00:01:06.930> so

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
down and that was a wrong thing to do so

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.080 
down and that was a wrong thing to do so
I<00:01:07.229> want<00:01:07.470> to<00:01:07.530> go<00:01:07.619> back<00:01:07.649> to<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:08.070> forms<00:01:08.340> just

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
I want to go back to the forms just

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.710 
I want to go back to the forms just
click<00:01:09.300> said<00:01:10.460> and

slide it up
something<00:01:39.670> like<00:01:39.820> so<00:01:40.000> and<00:01:40.810> the<00:01:41.760> rig<00:01:42.760> that

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:42.970 
something like so and the rig that

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:46.340 
something like so and the rig that
connect<00:01:43.600> in<00:01:43.900> the<00:01:43.990> middle<00:01:44.320> and<00:01:44.470> zero<00:01:45.250> slide<00:01:45.940> and

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
connect in the middle and zero slide and

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.930 
connect in the middle and zero slide and
just<00:01:47.350> whole<00:01:47.830> control<00:01:48.190> go<00:01:48.340> to<00:01:48.400> the<00:01:48.550> polygon

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:48.940 
just whole control go to the polygon

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:54.630 
just whole control go to the polygon
mode<00:01:49.090> and<00:01:50.310> scale<00:01:51.310> it<00:01:51.340> in<00:01:52.890> actually<00:01:53.890> no<00:01:54.310> con

skeleton<00:01:55.150> yet<00:01:55.330> we<00:01:55.840> have<00:01:55.960> chamfered<00:01:56.500> it<00:01:56.620> yet<00:01:56.830> so

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:57.370 
skeleton yet we have chamfered it yet so

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:04.070 
skeleton yet we have chamfered it yet so
loop<00:01:58.650> jumper<00:02:00.060> why<00:02:01.060> too<00:02:01.120> much
