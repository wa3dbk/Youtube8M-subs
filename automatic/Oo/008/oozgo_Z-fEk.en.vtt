00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
electronically minim bitched rich man

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:29.590 
electronically minim bitched rich man
there<00:01:23.610> is<00:01:24.200> there<00:01:25.200> is

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:35.200 

do<00:01:30.290> it<00:01:30.440> anyway<00:01:31.100> I<00:01:31.310> use<00:01:31.550> this<00:01:31.870> program<00:01:34.150> so<00:01:35.150> you

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210 
do it anyway I use this program so you

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.860 
do it anyway I use this program so you
can<00:01:35.659> do<00:01:35.750> some<00:01:35.960> next<00:01:36.200> book<00:01:36.320> just<00:01:36.470> go<00:01:36.680> to<00:01:37.750> this<00:01:38.750> he

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:38.870 
can do some next book just go to this he

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:45.190 
can do some next book just go to this he
here<00:01:39.110> program<00:01:40.120> stop<00:01:41.120> working<00:01:41.420> now<00:01:44.200> this

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 
here program stop working now this

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.120 
here program stop working now this
program<00:01:45.409> is<00:01:45.590> called<00:01:45.890> motion<00:01:46.490> motion<00:01:47.330> enjoy

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
program is called motion motion enjoy

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.450 
program is called motion motion enjoy
now<00:01:49.130> what<00:01:49.280> this<00:01:49.460> does<00:01:49.520> is<00:01:50.530> it<00:01:51.530> allows<00:01:51.590> the<00:01:52.190> the

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 
now what this does is it allows the the

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:56.080 
now what this does is it allows the the
ps3<00:01:52.880> controller<00:01:53.270> this<00:01:54.259> one<00:01:54.440> here<00:01:54.680> to<00:01:55.670> emulate

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
ps3 controller this one here to emulate

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.020 
ps3 controller this one here to emulate
as<00:01:56.270> an<00:01:56.390> Xbox<00:01:56.990> controller<00:01:57.610> and<00:01:58.610> that<00:01:58.729> can<00:01:58.880> be<00:01:59.000> a

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
as an Xbox controller and that can be a

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.930 
as an Xbox controller and that can be a
pain<00:01:59.210> setup<00:01:59.690> so<00:02:00.020> just<00:02:00.410> follow<00:02:01.400> a<00:02:01.460> guy<00:02:01.640> online

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:01.940 
pain setup so just follow a guy online

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:07.240 
pain setup so just follow a guy online
or<00:02:02.360> something<00:02:03.100> but<00:02:04.660> you<00:02:05.660> know<00:02:05.920> it<00:02:06.920> basically

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
or something but you know it basically

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.279 
or something but you know it basically
emulates<00:02:07.550> it<00:02:07.910> as<00:02:08.060> an<00:02:08.179> Xbox<00:02:08.450> controller<00:02:08.690> as<00:02:09.200> you

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
emulates it as an Xbox controller as you

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:12.010 
emulates it as an Xbox controller as you
can<00:02:09.410> see<00:02:09.530> there<00:02:09.739> X<00:02:10.070> sympathy<00:02:10.550> for<00:02:10.729> Xbox<00:02:11.239> 360

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
can see there X sympathy for Xbox 360

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:13.660 
can see there X sympathy for Xbox 360
controller<00:02:12.320> emulator<00:02:12.680> so<00:02:13.190> this<00:02:13.310> makes<00:02:13.550> the

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
controller emulator so this makes the

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.360 
controller emulator so this makes the
ps3<00:02:14.030> controller<00:02:14.060> work<00:02:14.630> for<00:02:14.930> games<00:02:15.620> that<00:02:15.860> make

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
ps3 controller work for games that make

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:21.070 
ps3 controller work for games that make
use<00:02:16.550> of<00:02:16.580> the<00:02:16.880> Xbox<00:02:17.239> 360<00:02:17.690> controller<00:02:17.720> and<00:02:20.080> then

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
use of the Xbox 360 controller and then

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.509 
use of the Xbox 360 controller and then
you<00:02:21.170> probably<00:02:21.290> wondering<00:02:21.830> right<00:02:22.070> so<00:02:22.340> now<00:02:22.489> I

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:22.519 
you probably wondering right so now I

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:24.670 
you probably wondering right so now I
have<00:02:22.730> an<00:02:22.850> Xbox<00:02:23.209> 360<00:02:23.390> controller<00:02:23.690> what<00:02:24.440> do<00:02:24.560> I<00:02:24.620> do

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
have an Xbox 360 controller what do I do

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:25.360 
have an Xbox 360 controller what do I do
next

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
next

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.080 
next
well<00:02:26.300> I<00:02:26.540> use<00:02:26.660> a<00:02:26.780> program<00:02:27.320> that<00:02:27.709> assigns<00:02:28.160> keys

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
well I use a program that assigns keys

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.449 
well I use a program that assigns keys
on<00:02:29.690> the<00:02:30.500> the<00:02:30.860> keyboard<00:02:31.280> and<00:02:31.519> mouse<00:02:32.290> movements

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
on the the keyboard and mouse movements

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:36.580 
on the the keyboard and mouse movements
to<00:02:34.459> buttons<00:02:35.150> and<00:02:35.510> movements<00:02:36.170> on<00:02:36.260> the<00:02:36.380> joypad

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
to buttons and movements on the joypad

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.740 
to buttons and movements on the joypad
itself<00:02:37.280> and<00:02:38.170> I<00:02:39.170> use<00:02:39.470> a<00:02:39.500> program<00:02:39.799> called<00:02:40.750> called

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
itself and I use a program called called
