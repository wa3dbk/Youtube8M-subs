Norman is dying in Marc Webb's franchise

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.580 
Norman is dying in Marc Webb's franchise
but<00:02:49.670> we<00:02:49.850> can<00:02:50.000> assume<00:02:50.390> that<00:02:50.420> Richards<00:02:51.020> super

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
but we can assume that Richards super

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.290 
but we can assume that Richards super
spiders<00:02:52.070> were<00:02:52.430> something<00:02:52.910> that<00:02:52.940> could

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:53.300 
spiders were something that could

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.930 
spiders were something that could
develop<00:02:53.480> a<00:02:53.840> cure<00:02:54.170> for<00:02:54.410> Norman<00:02:54.800> years<00:02:55.400> ago

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
develop a cure for Norman years ago

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:57.970 
develop a cure for Norman years ago
therefore<00:02:56.660> Richard<00:02:56.959> Parker<00:02:57.350> decided<00:02:57.770> to

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
therefore Richard Parker decided to

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.760 
therefore Richard Parker decided to
disappear<00:02:58.430> and<00:02:59.000> he<00:02:59.510> left<00:02:59.660> his<00:02:59.930> spiders<00:03:00.470> which

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:00.770 
disappear and he left his spiders which

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:03.010 
disappear and he left his spiders which
currently<00:03:01.280> serve<00:03:01.610> only<00:03:01.880> one<00:03:02.270> purpose<00:03:02.600> at

from a selling in the spiders room but
eventually<00:03:26.510> this<00:03:27.050> scene<00:03:27.410> was<00:03:27.620> changed<00:03:27.650> and
