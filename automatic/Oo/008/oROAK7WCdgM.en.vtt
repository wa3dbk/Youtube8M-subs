00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.819
 vegas films presents the band venture 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.290
 I was lowered what is if she is not 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.069
 so exactly where you ask me and the questions 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.069
 you answer yourself 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:14.759
 Yes 

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:21.700
 Something surprising was me 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:23.230
 most of the have now not so good 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.880
 That was just a little more out of the eye 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:26.770
 falls and I do not have any holidays 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:29.230
 would very much like to be in monogamous because so 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:33.060
 looks computer and if anyone knows 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:33.060
 where sometimes still got it tells me 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.850
 problem with it may not be so expensive 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.170
 a ring-chain and they must have the 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.060
 such a button or can moor 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:42.280
 namely, then it falls out of my eye 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:47.430
 that would be awesome, that's it 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:47.430
 not so cool what i am doing when 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:52.290
 So I had one 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:55.410
 snake pit but fear but I have 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:56.940
 so much n24 watched throughout the day and 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.260
 then I beat the whole day 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.030
 seen and then I was not scared 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.100
 I've tried more before that 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.330
 with spiders did not work 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.330
 I now have even more us 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.869
 it is this one and I am ashamed 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.869
 not a bit 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:20.270
 in a trifle is happening too 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.950
 only if my ipod battery is all airport 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.500
 Battery say five times in a row 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:27.560
 evacuated 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:30.470
 ok ipod batteries empty and we are neighbors 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.780
 and it comes in completely now 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.190
 ran is completely exhausted 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:39.280
 just managed to settle down 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:39.280
 that is, sweat and you are 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:49.400
 I'm nervous, I'm doing a 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:51.470
 zappelphilipp and resembled stress 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.270
 rash was really bad 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.759
 You can tell from that if I'm watching 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.830
 has stress and because I'm a bit 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:00.050
 stress I have this statement 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:01.909
 I do not want to be that close or 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:05.420
 do you want to see it here but she wanted it that way 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:06.950
 that is he in his full splendor that 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.569
 is a bit so a few bring 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:12.860
 the mood indicates when the rash 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:15.560
 that stress was not nice but I thought 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.709
 yes that should know what could do 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.709
 I only 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.390
 actually very central 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:29.049
 my very first stuffed animal you know 

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:30.519
 yes many from July and so were the goods 

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:36.480
 not that was not the very first 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:36.480
 papa what was my first kuscheltier 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.829
 I was 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:49.599
 first three times about how starbucks and 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:55.590
 the nespresso always made easy 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:55.590
 Rosen Dienst and I have no idea 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:03.780
 your room on young Miss I say 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.159
 always so even if you are just him 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:08.040
 got to know that one of the first 

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:10.640
 things that would otherwise not well I 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.640
 not many friends 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:17.070
 who cares about it 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:28.000
 does one count cleanly no I 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.970
 do not know but of course not 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.340
 stupid one of my first videos even 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:37.230
 The first video uploaded was called 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:46.870
 in sciacca had a trained karate 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:48.310
 It was said and it looks like I show 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:51.180
 not me from the best side today 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:51.180
 this feeling 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:04:00.950
 it's all a matter of taste pizza 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:04.010
 good food ice cream very good that it 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:05.540
 that is to my definition 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:07.640
 Bad food is what I eat at all 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:09.380
 do not eat I'm not good either 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:12.709
 model in things nutrition merkel 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:16.970
 could say yes now bad 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:19.790
 food is generally here and so pizza 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:23.630
 I would never look at life 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:26.080
 them guilty that I wanted my 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:26.080
 absolutely delicious 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:31.319
 is not a catchy phrase now 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:32.879
 but if someone says what I do 

00:04:31.319 --> 00:04:34.379
 should and I do not want to do that 

00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:36.990
 For example, the room on the 

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:41.940
 I never sink in the 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:43.949
 in the thomas therefore never it never 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:45.720
 it gets louder when a teacher 

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:48.500
 you ask for the box row with the 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:52.220
 You can never shed the hall to 10 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:52.220
 in no good notes 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:58.880
 really really really as here 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:05:01.400
 At the moment this is beautiful 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:04.100
 short it puts my eyes in front 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:10.730
 when I sleep and this wonderful 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:13.790
 klose probably was in did in the doing 

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:14.480
 I do not even say riots like that 

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:15.950
 often on 

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:22.720
 certainly not if you do not have a monopoly 

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:28.310
 that was nice that was it 

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:31.910
 nice but enough of the words did wait 

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:33.830
 what was that quote for a couple of 

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:37.690
 many of you will know it 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:37.690
 attention and the next time
