ahead and show you the okay Colin this
is<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.270> play<00:01:24.600> it's<00:01:24.900> just<00:01:25.080> like<00:01:25.140> a<00:01:25.400> soap<00:01:26.400> like<00:01:26.700> a

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
is the play it's just like a soap like a

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.469 
is the play it's just like a soap like a
silver<00:01:27.210> mirrored<00:01:27.689> plate<00:01:27.990> then<00:01:28.619> this<00:01:28.890> one<00:01:29.159> is

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479 
silver mirrored plate then this one is

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:31.520 
silver mirrored plate then this one is
white<00:01:30.479> and<00:01:30.750> it<00:01:30.869> has<00:01:31.020> these<00:01:31.170> little<00:01:31.320> holes

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
white and it has these little holes

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.289 
white and it has these little holes
where<00:01:31.770> I<00:01:31.799> guess<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.159> lights<00:01:32.369> on<00:01:32.549> stir<00:01:32.790> you

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
where I guess the lights on stir you

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:34.700 
where I guess the lights on stir you
can't<00:01:33.540> see<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:33.840> light<00:01:33.990> but<00:01:34.140> I<00:01:34.200> think<00:01:34.409> once<00:01:34.560> it

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
can't see the light but I think once it

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.440 
can't see the light but I think once it
closes<00:01:34.920> down<00:01:35.159> on<00:01:35.369> your<00:01:35.520> hair<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.939> light<00:01:36.150> is<00:01:36.420> on

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
closes down on your hair the light is on

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:42.499 
closes down on your hair the light is on
and<00:01:37.850> so<00:01:38.850> I'm<00:01:39.060> going<00:01:39.180> to<00:01:39.210> turn<00:01:39.329> it<00:01:39.450> on<00:01:41.240> it<00:01:42.240> goes

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
and so I'm going to turn it on it goes

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.960 
and so I'm going to turn it on it goes
up<00:01:42.689> to<00:01:42.810> 450<00:01:43.799> degrees<00:01:43.829> and<00:01:44.250> I<00:01:44.280> think<00:01:44.490> as<00:01:44.610> low<00:01:44.820> as

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
up to 450 degrees and I think as low as

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.330 
up to 450 degrees and I think as low as
to<00:01:45.299> 80<00:01:45.659> and<00:01:46.320> this<00:01:46.470> is<00:01:46.590> what<00:01:46.740> it<00:01:46.770> looks<00:01:46.920> like<00:01:47.100> and

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
to 80 and this is what it looks like and

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.969 
to 80 and this is what it looks like and
then<00:01:47.549> it<00:01:47.670> counts<00:01:47.909> up<00:01:50.060> to<00:01:51.409> 450<00:01:52.409> which<00:01:52.649> is<00:01:52.829> the

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
then it counts up to 450 which is the

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.249 
then it counts up to 450 which is the
high<00:01:53.070> setting<00:01:53.340> right<00:01:53.579> now<00:01:53.640> I<00:01:53.970> don't<00:01:54.869> have<00:01:55.110> to

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
high setting right now I don't have to

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.280 
high setting right now I don't have to
use<00:01:55.380> it<00:01:55.409> but<00:01:55.560> ok<00:01:55.950> first<00:01:56.159> off<00:01:56.280> it's<00:01:57.229> it's<00:01:58.229> like

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
use it but ok first off it's it's like

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.260 
use it but ok first off it's it's like
flashing<00:01:58.979> and<00:01:59.159> when<00:01:59.280> it's<00:01:59.399> done<00:01:59.490> it's<00:01:59.790> not<00:01:59.969> it

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
doesn't flash anymore so that lets you

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.770

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:55.690 
because my hair never feels healthy

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:57.240 
because my hair never feels healthy
never<00:04:55.930> feels<00:04:56.169> soft<00:04:56.530> or<00:04:56.830> anything<00:04:57.070> like<00:04:57.130> that
