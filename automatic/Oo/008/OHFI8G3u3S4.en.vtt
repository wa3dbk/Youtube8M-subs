00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.630
 Welcome to one more because 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:12.120

 of survivor for those who like it 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:21.720
 the independent wild card developer 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:25.289
 studio announced being will come back me aig 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.480
 a survival dinosaur game 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.810
 in an open world with the players 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:33.600
 can fight for each of the spaces 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.809
 among the most ferocious creatures ever 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.520
 they walked on the ground that even the game is 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:44.629
 in development for playstation 4 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:47.250
 xbox one pc mac and linux arc survival 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:50.340
 involvent will launch its access 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:53.190
 anticipated on steam on June 2 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:56.879
 That same month next month you 're already going 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:01:00.059
 able to play it in early access with 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:02.730
 technology has expanded in design for arc 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:06.630
 take on the genre bent over with a 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:08.970
 unique take between a few quotes 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.250
 things I noticed here already exist in 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.950
 some games and you will see the 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.310
 players wake us up and starving 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:20.100
 on the beach of a mysterious island called 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:23.400
 aek not so original so even when 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.530
 if compared to ranch prelates 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.600
 Who plays rost to whoever saw it here? 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.759
 my channel and elsewhere 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.579
 blush also when the player starts it 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.979
 wake up naked I do not know if hungry or not 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:37.259
 will see the rope naked on an island in a 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.060
 beach somewhere and it's very 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.759
 interestingly they said that the original 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.079
 it's not original that part at last let's go 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.509
 continue because the game has 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.500
 originality yes a little more to 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.729
 front 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:52.200
 in the game they must hunt to harvest 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:55.110
 crafts and so on galley 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:58.110
 research technology build shelters 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:01.040
 to protect against hot days 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:05.070
 cold nights weather systems 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:08.369
 dangerous and potential wildlife 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:11.580
 dangerous enemies players can use 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:13.950
 strategies and tactics to tame 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:16.740
 many dinosaurs and other 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.940
 primitive creatures that roam in his 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:20.480
 location 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:24.840
 ecosystems persist in every land 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:26.760
 sea and even underground 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.040
 This is interesting too, nice. 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:32.550
 build strengths of your 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:35.400
 character and gain items skills and 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:37.560
 pet creatures and 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.960
 start a tribe with hundreds of others 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.300
 players to survive the tribes 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:45.900
 rivals that try to dominate and finally 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:49.590
 discover the true purpose of arc 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:52.320
 the game promises more than 60 dinosaurs 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.370
 I'm talking about early access 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.760
 Let's see if they will put more 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:58.770
 after and other prehistoric animals 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:02.070
 including a gigantic creature without a 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:05.970
 scale never seen before in videos 500 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:08.880
 was with the squad to have the tactile on 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:12.060
 the snow-capped mountains that are cool 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:14.430
 I saw the image of the strange is that 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:17.790
 you also see that it goes deep and 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:21.870
 also saw a picture of the character is 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:24.810
 the player on top of the toll and the time 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:26.850
 rises with a gigantic train ready 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.250
 the targets of enemy bases 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:32.970
 or perceived by the companies of a 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:36.320
 furious and xvii Hexxeh here no longer have 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:38.489
 that rock wolf at t rex galera 

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:39.390
 brontosaurus is connected in what people 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:42.420
 is talking 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:44.010
 they are heavy animals the players will 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.830
 learn quickly that dinosaurs 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:50.100
 are not the only dangerous creatures of the 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:52.980
 other island players are organizing 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:55.950
 rebel tribes to accumulate resources 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:58.800
 experiences and building villages and 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:01.590
 cities along the map with technology 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:04.200
 which comes from the primitive stone age at 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:06.510
 was modern electro-motorized between 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:08.940
 others who will fight to destroy 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:10.170
 anything that is seen as a 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:14.780
 threat 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:18.390
 arc will launch in early 2016 on bs-4
