around in the tank and won't get eaten
by<00:02:02.550> the<00:02:02.610> Predators<00:02:03.030> so<00:02:03.570> what<00:02:03.660> I<00:02:03.720> have<00:02:03.840> to<00:02:03.929> do<00:02:04.050> is

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
by the Predators so what I have to do is

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.389 
by the Predators so what I have to do is
find<00:02:04.440> some<00:02:04.619> fish<00:02:04.800> with<00:02:04.979> built-in<00:02:05.280> defense

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
find some fish with built-in defense

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.279 
find some fish with built-in defense
mechanisms<00:02:06.179> so<00:02:06.690> they<00:02:06.810> can<00:02:06.929> hold<00:02:07.080> their<00:02:07.229> own

00:02:07.279 --> 00:02:07.289 
mechanisms so they can hold their own

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:09.290 
mechanisms so they can hold their own
against<00:02:07.710> a<00:02:07.770> couple<00:02:07.950> predators<00:02:08.429> this<00:02:08.940> is<00:02:09.270> a

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
against a couple predators this is a

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.920 
against a couple predators this is a
cool<00:02:09.660> fish<00:02:09.899> but<00:02:10.110> it's<00:02:10.920> called<00:02:11.160> a<00:02:11.280> soap<00:02:11.550> fish

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
cool fish but it's called a soap fish

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.559 
cool fish but it's called a soap fish
they<00:02:12.930> actually<00:02:13.290> secrete<00:02:13.710> a<00:02:13.920> really<00:02:14.569> toxic

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
they actually secrete a really toxic

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:19.059 
they actually secrete a really toxic
mucus<00:02:16.260> that<00:02:16.530> deters<00:02:17.430> would-be<00:02:18.060> predators

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:19.069 
mucus that deters would-be predators

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:21.500 
mucus that deters would-be predators
foxface<00:02:20.069> rabbitfish<00:02:20.130> they<00:02:20.970> have<00:02:21.090> a<00:02:21.120> really

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
foxface rabbitfish they have a really

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.330 
foxface rabbitfish they have a really
cool<00:02:21.930> characteristic<00:02:22.710> they're<00:02:22.980> actually

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
cool characteristic they're actually

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.640 
cool characteristic they're actually
venomous<00:02:23.730> so<00:02:24.360> they<00:02:24.480> have<00:02:24.630> venomous<00:02:25.230> dorsal

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
venomous so they have venomous dorsal

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.350 
venomous so they have venomous dorsal
spines<00:02:25.950> and<00:02:26.640> they're<00:02:26.880> a<00:02:26.910> yellow<00:02:27.210> and<00:02:27.300> black

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360

stay<00:02:30.000> away<00:02:30.240> and<00:02:30.450> that<00:02:30.660> he<00:02:30.780> tells<00:02:30.960> them<00:02:31.170> then

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
stay away and that he tells them then

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:32.990 
stay away and that he tells them then
these<00:02:31.650> are<00:02:31.710> venomous<00:02:32.190> fish<00:02:32.370> I<00:02:32.550> really<00:02:32.819> need

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
these are venomous fish I really need

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.450 
these are venomous fish I really need
them<00:02:33.200> because<00:02:34.200> of<00:02:34.560> the<00:02:34.710> Fox<00:02:35.069> faces

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:35.460 
them because of the Fox faces

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:37.250 
them because of the Fox faces
characteristics<00:02:36.270> I<00:02:36.450> think<00:02:36.900> it<00:02:37.020> would<00:02:37.110> be<00:02:37.230> a

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
characteristics I think it would be a

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.620 
characteristics I think it would be a
prime<00:02:37.620> candidate<00:02:38.040> for<00:02:38.190> a<00:02:38.340> non<00:02:38.700> predator<00:02:39.240> in

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
prime candidate for a non predator in

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.760 
prime candidate for a non predator in
the<00:02:39.870> predator<00:02:40.200> tank

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:41.770 
the predator tank

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:44.320 
the predator tank
these<00:02:42.770> are<00:02:42.860> some<00:02:43.010> good<00:02:43.190> options<00:02:43.250> but<00:02:44.000> I'm<00:02:44.090> not

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 
these are some good options but I'm not
