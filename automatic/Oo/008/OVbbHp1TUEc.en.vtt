00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
files we use the play MIDI funk

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.660 
files we use the play MIDI funk
with<00:02:27.870> the<00:02:28.319> MIDI<00:02:28.560> file<00:02:28.890> as<00:02:29.249> the<00:02:29.280> first

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
with the MIDI file as the first

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.550 
with the MIDI file as the first
parameter<00:02:29.909> and<00:02:30.390> whether<00:02:30.870> it<00:02:31.049> loops<00:02:31.230> are<00:02:31.409> not

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
parameter and whether it loops are not

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.309 
parameter and whether it loops are not
as<00:02:31.769> the<00:02:32.099> second<00:02:32.430> parameter<00:02:32.519> if<00:02:33.389> you<00:02:34.019> want<00:02:34.230> to

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
as the second parameter if you want to

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:36.709 
as the second parameter if you want to
stop<00:02:34.590> a<00:02:34.620> sample<00:02:35.159> that's<00:02:35.310> playing<00:02:35.730> use<00:02:36.510> the

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:36.719 
stop a sample that's playing use the

00:02:36.719 --> 00:02:39.470 
stop a sample that's playing use the
stop<00:02:36.930> sample<00:02:37.409> function<00:02:37.829> the<00:02:38.760> only<00:02:38.999> parameter

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
stop sample function the only parameter

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.429 
stop sample function the only parameter
here<00:02:39.780> is<00:02:39.989> the<00:02:40.200> name<00:02:40.349> of<00:02:40.379> your<00:02:40.650> sample<00:02:41.209> for<00:02:42.209> MIDI

00:02:42.429 --> 00:02:42.439 
here is the name of your sample for MIDI

00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:45.770 
here is the name of your sample for MIDI
well<00:02:43.439> I<00:02:43.980> don't<00:02:44.400> see<00:02:44.609> a<00:02:44.639> stop<00:02:45.060> function<00:02:45.599> in<00:02:45.689> the

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
well I don't see a stop function in the

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:46.610 
well I don't see a stop function in the
quick<00:02:45.959> reference

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
quick reference

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.330 
quick reference
so<00:02:46.950> I<00:02:47.579> guess<00:02:48.209> turn<00:02:48.810> the<00:02:49.049> MIDI<00:02:49.290> sound<00:02:49.590> down<00:02:49.920> when

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
so I guess turn the MIDI sound down when

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.000 
so I guess turn the MIDI sound down when
you<00:02:50.430> don't<00:02:50.579> want<00:02:50.849> it<00:02:50.969> anymore<00:02:51.650> to<00:02:52.650> set<00:02:52.859> the

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
you don't want it anymore to set the

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.649 
you don't want it anymore to set the
volume<00:02:53.129> of<00:02:53.430> each<00:02:53.579> use<00:02:54.120> the<00:02:54.269> set<00:02:54.450> volume

00:02:54.649 --> 00:02:54.659 
volume of each use the set volume

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:57.170 
volume of each use the set volume
function<00:02:55.260> the<00:02:56.189> first<00:02:56.430> parameter<00:02:56.609> is<00:02:56.909> the

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
function the first parameter is the

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:58.909 
function the first parameter is the
sample<00:02:57.540> volume<00:02:57.689> and<00:02:58.079> the<00:02:58.290> second<00:02:58.620> one<00:02:58.709> is<00:02:58.829> the

00:02:58.909 --> 00:02:58.919 
sample volume and the second one is the

00:02:58.919 --> 00:03:02.479 
sample volume and the second one is the
MIDI<00:02:59.099> volume<00:02:59.840> now<00:03:00.840> for<00:03:01.230> both<00:03:01.349> of<00:03:01.590> these<00:03:01.709> you'll

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
MIDI volume now for both of these you'll

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:04.220 
MIDI volume now for both of these you'll
want<00:03:02.669> to<00:03:02.730> destroy<00:03:03.180> them<00:03:03.450> when<00:03:03.840> you're<00:03:03.989> done

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
want to destroy them when you're done

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:04.819 
want to destroy them when you're done
with<00:03:04.439> them

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:04.829 
with them

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:07.689 
with them
so<00:03:05.579> destroy<00:03:06.030> a<00:03:06.060> sample<00:03:06.569> and<00:03:06.780> destroy<00:03:07.260> MIDI

00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:07.699 
so destroy a sample and destroy MIDI

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:10.490 
so destroy a sample and destroy MIDI
both<00:03:08.699> of<00:03:08.969> the<00:03:09.060> parameters<00:03:09.569> of<00:03:09.599> the<00:03:10.019> sample<00:03:10.409> are

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
both of the parameters of the sample are

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.830 
both of the parameters of the sample are
ready<00:03:10.709> you're<00:03:10.919> using<00:03:11.129> it's<00:03:12.120> pretty<00:03:12.449> similar

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
ready you're using it's pretty similar

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.490 
ready you're using it's pretty similar
to<00:03:12.900> bitmaps<00:03:13.760> all<00:03:14.760> right<00:03:14.969> the<00:03:15.810> next<00:03:15.930> video<00:03:16.349> is

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
to bitmaps all right the next video is

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.920 
to bitmaps all right the next video is
going<00:03:16.560> to<00:03:16.769> cover<00:03:16.859> outputting<00:03:17.579> text<00:03:17.969> both<00:03:18.780> of

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
going to cover outputting text both of

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:20.479 
going to cover outputting text both of
these<00:03:19.049> are<00:03:19.230> really<00:03:19.379> short<00:03:19.709> videos<00:03:20.040> but<00:03:20.459> I

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
these are really short videos but I

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:22.670 
these are really short videos but I
prefer<00:03:20.849> to<00:03:20.969> keep<00:03:21.090> them<00:03:21.269> that<00:03:21.299> way<00:03:21.480> this<00:03:22.469> way

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
prefer to keep them that way this way

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.709 
prefer to keep them that way this way
they're<00:03:23.129> easier<00:03:23.549> to<00:03:23.609> find<00:03:23.879> for<00:03:23.969> reference<00:03:24.449> and

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:24.719 
they're easier to find for reference and

00:03:24.719 --> 00:03:26.599 
they're easier to find for reference and
also<00:03:25.199> because<00:03:25.469> some<00:03:25.680> of<00:03:25.709> the<00:03:25.859> SDL<00:03:26.280> for<00:03:26.549> the

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:26.609 
also because some of the SDL for the

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:29.030 
also because some of the SDL for the
same<00:03:26.790> topics<00:03:27.239> is<00:03:27.389> more<00:03:27.599> complicated<00:03:28.040> so

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
same topics is more complicated so

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.909 
same topics is more complicated so
really<00:03:29.340> those<00:03:29.489> need<00:03:29.760> their<00:03:29.939> own<00:03:29.969> videos

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:30.919 
really those need their own videos

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:34.610 
really those need their own videos
anyway<00:03:31.919> as<00:03:32.129> a<00:03:32.699> note<00:03:33.030> I'm<00:03:33.389> kind<00:03:33.930> of<00:03:33.989> young<00:03:34.229> so<00:03:34.590> I

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
anyway as a note I'm kind of young so I

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.439 
anyway as a note I'm kind of young so I
really<00:03:34.949> only<00:03:34.979> know<00:03:35.340> Jackson's<00:03:35.879> music<00:03:36.030> through

00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:36.449 
really only know Jackson's music through

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:39.259 
really only know Jackson's music through
Weird<00:03:36.750> Al<00:03:36.959> and<00:03:37.199> Alien<00:03:37.590> Ant<00:03:37.769> Farm<00:03:38.030> but<00:03:39.030> it's

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:39.269 
Weird Al and Alien Ant Farm but it's

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:40.929 
Weird Al and Alien Ant Farm but it's
pretty<00:03:39.540> sad<00:03:39.750> to<00:03:39.780> hear<00:03:40.019> what<00:03:40.169> anyone<00:03:40.409> dies

00:03:40.929 --> 00:03:40.939 
pretty sad to hear what anyone dies

00:03:40.939 --> 00:03:43.610 
pretty sad to hear what anyone dies
everyone<00:03:41.939> else<00:03:42.120> take<00:03:42.629> care<00:03:42.659> and<00:03:43.290> I'll<00:03:43.409> see<00:03:43.530> you

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
everyone else take care and I'll see you

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.009 
everyone else take care and I'll see you
next<00:03:43.680> time
