first<00:00:39.030> part<00:00:39.450> of<00:00:39.660> my<00:00:39.780> peeking<00:00:40.140> face<00:00:40.379> of<00:00:40.649> squat

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
first part of my peeking face of squat

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.330 
first part of my peeking face of squat
so<00:00:41.190> a<00:00:41.399> total<00:00:41.850> of<00:00:42.059> eight<00:00:42.239> sets<00:00:42.690> with<00:00:43.350> three<00:00:44.010> reps

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
so a total of eight sets with three reps

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.819 
so a total of eight sets with three reps
each<00:00:44.579> and<00:00:45.030> each<00:00:45.090> set<00:00:45.390> using<00:00:45.930> ninety<00:00:46.680> percent

each and each set using ninety percent

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.830 
each and each set using ninety percent
then<00:00:47.219> dropping<00:00:47.550> it<00:00:47.760> down<00:00:47.789> to<00:00:48.239> around<00:00:48.329> eighty

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
then dropping it down to around eighty

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.690 
then dropping it down to around eighty
percent<00:00:49.020> now<00:00:49.739> today<00:00:49.950> initially<00:00:50.280> called<00:00:50.460> for

percent now today initially called for
490<00:00:51.239> and<00:00:51.329> normally<00:00:51.600> I<00:00:51.629> probably<00:00:51.809> wouldn't

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
490 and normally I probably wouldn't

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.510 
490 and normally I probably wouldn't
mess<00:00:52.230> with<00:00:52.260> this<00:00:52.440> on<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:52.710> peaking<00:00:53.010> cycle<00:00:53.370> but

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
mess with this on the peaking cycle but

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.729 
mess with this on the peaking cycle but

honestly when the weight spread out
further<00:01:03.840> it<00:01:04.140> just<00:01:04.379> looks<00:01:04.799> and<00:01:04.979> feels<00:01:05.220> heavier

that I was able to move the weight and I
knew<00:01:35.250> that<00:01:35.490> this<00:01:35.610> should<00:01:35.850> feel<00:01:36.000> heavy<00:01:36.240> because

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479

film<00:01:45.090> I<00:01:45.299> was<00:01:45.659> happy<00:01:45.810> that<00:01:46.020> I<00:01:46.049> was<00:01:46.170> able<00:01:46.229> to<00:01:46.380> get

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
film I was happy that I was able to get

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.560 
film I was happy that I was able to get
all<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:46.920> work<00:01:47.070> done<00:01:47.130> overall<00:01:47.820> so<00:01:48.360> this<00:01:48.450> is<00:01:48.509> the

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
all the work done overall so this is the

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.270 
all the work done overall so this is the
first<00:01:48.780> time<00:01:48.930> for<00:01:49.259> me<00:01:49.290> running<00:01:49.740> this<00:01:49.860> piquing

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
first time for me running this piquing

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.800 
first time for me running this piquing
phase<00:01:50.520> and<00:01:50.729> it's<00:01:50.820> really<00:01:51.060> based<00:01:51.329> roughly

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
phase and it's really based roughly

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.780 
phase and it's really based roughly
around<00:01:51.930> the<00:01:52.320> peaking<00:01:53.040> for<00:01:53.250> powerlifting

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
around the peaking for powerlifting

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
couple of months back and i'll be sure

below<00:01:58.590> however<00:01:59.490> we<00:01:59.670> made<00:01:59.939> some<00:02:00.180> slight

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
below however we made some slight

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:01.969 
below however we made some slight
changes<00:02:00.450> one<00:02:01.320> of<00:02:01.409> the<00:02:01.469> things<00:02:01.530> we<00:02:01.710> didn't

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
changes one of the things we didn't

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.499 
changes one of the things we didn't
change<00:02:02.189> however<00:02:02.430> was<00:02:02.729> the<00:02:02.759> layout<00:02:03.119> of<00:02:03.180> it<00:02:03.390> and

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
change however was the layout of it and

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:04.850 
change however was the layout of it and
i<00:02:03.540> think<00:02:03.570> going<00:02:03.930> forward<00:02:04.049> that<00:02:04.500> might<00:02:04.680> be

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
i think going forward that might be

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.770 
i think going forward that might be
something<00:02:05.040> i'll<00:02:05.399> look<00:02:05.549> into<00:02:05.729> only<00:02:06.509> because

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
something i'll look into only because

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.419 
something i'll look into only because
again<00:02:07.020> i<00:02:07.140> typically<00:02:07.439> squat<00:02:07.829> towards<00:02:08.129> the<00:02:08.250> end

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
again i typically squat towards the end

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.400 
again i typically squat towards the end
of<00:02:08.550> the<00:02:08.670> week<00:02:08.849> and<00:02:09.060> this<00:02:09.479> piquing<00:02:09.899> face<00:02:10.110> starts

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
of the week and this piquing face starts

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.660 
of the week and this piquing face starts
with<00:02:10.530> a<00:02:10.560> squat<00:02:10.860> day<00:02:11.129> and

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
with a squat day and

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.760 
with a squat day and
deadlifts<00:02:12.180> at<00:02:12.330> the<00:02:12.510> end<00:02:12.750> and<00:02:13.110> I<00:02:13.470> think<00:02:13.530> going

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
deadlifts at the end and I think going

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.230 
deadlifts at the end and I think going
forward<00:02:13.890> well<00:02:14.280> probably<00:02:14.459> do<00:02:14.640> is<00:02:14.760> flip<00:02:15.000> flop

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
forward well probably do is flip flop

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.970 
forward well probably do is flip flop
those<00:02:15.480> around<00:02:15.780> I<00:02:16.050> just<00:02:16.260> didn't<00:02:16.620> for<00:02:16.800> this

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
those around I just didn't for this

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.620 
those around I just didn't for this
particular<00:02:17.489> day<00:02:17.670> only<00:02:17.910> because<00:02:18.239> as<00:02:18.420> you<00:02:18.599> know

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
particular day only because as you know

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.570 
particular day only because as you know
tomorrow<00:02:19.470> I'm<00:02:19.650> leaving<00:02:19.680> for<00:02:20.069> Kansas<00:02:20.430> City

tomorrow I'm leaving for Kansas City

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.490 
tomorrow I'm leaving for Kansas City

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
which gives me my bench day on Wednesday

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.290 
which gives me my bench day on Wednesday
and<00:02:22.920> I'll<00:02:23.160> be<00:02:23.280> traveling<00:02:23.670> all<00:02:23.790> day<00:02:23.819> Friday<00:02:24.180> so

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
and I'll be traveling all day Friday so

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:25.640 
and I'll be traveling all day Friday so
won't<00:02:24.480> be<00:02:24.569> able<00:02:24.690> to<00:02:24.780> lift<00:02:24.959> so<00:02:25.080> I'm<00:02:25.170> going<00:02:25.410> to<00:02:25.530> do

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
won't be able to lift so I'm going to do

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.830 
won't be able to lift so I'm going to do
deadlifts<00:02:26.099> on<00:02:26.310> Thursday<00:02:27.030> and<00:02:27.209> it's<00:02:27.660> just

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
deadlifts on Thursday and it's just

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.000 
deadlifts on Thursday and it's just
easier<00:02:28.170> for<00:02:28.200> me<00:02:28.410> traveling<00:02:28.830> and<00:02:28.950> doing

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
easier for me traveling and doing

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.410 
easier for me traveling and doing
deadlifts<00:02:29.459> rather<00:02:29.760> than<00:02:29.910> traveling<00:02:30.120> and

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
deadlifts rather than traveling and

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:31.640 
deadlifts rather than traveling and
doing<00:02:30.480> squats<00:02:30.930> because<00:02:31.110> I<00:02:31.230> don't<00:02:31.380> have<00:02:31.500> to

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
doing squats because I don't have to

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.170 
doing squats because I don't have to
worry<00:02:31.830> about<00:02:32.010> bringing<00:02:32.310> my<00:02:32.580> shoes<00:02:32.819> my<00:02:33.120> knee

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
worry about bringing my shoes my knee

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.030 
worry about bringing my shoes my knee

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
sleeves things of that nature can just

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.350 
sleeves things of that nature can just
really<00:02:35.220> bring<00:02:35.370> my<00:02:35.489> belt<00:02:35.790> and<00:02:35.940> the<00:02:36.090> shoes<00:02:36.330> that

percent followed by four sets of three
at<00:03:18.150> eighty<00:03:18.359> percent<00:03:18.570> so<00:03:19.049> you're<00:03:19.170> watching<00:03:19.290> my

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
at eighty percent so you're watching my

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.410 
at eighty percent so you're watching my
eighty<00:03:19.739> percent<00:03:19.950> right<00:03:20.370> here<00:03:20.549> which<00:03:20.700> is<00:03:20.820> 435

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
eighty percent right here which is 435

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.810 
eighty percent right here which is 435
and<00:03:21.690> i<00:03:22.230> really<00:03:22.590> like<00:03:22.799> filming<00:03:23.160> from<00:03:23.310> this<00:03:23.549> side

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
and i really like filming from this side

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:25.069 
and i really like filming from this side
angle<00:03:24.180> this<00:03:24.269> is<00:03:24.420> where<00:03:24.570> a<00:03:24.600> judge<00:03:24.900> would

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:25.079 
angle this is where a judge would

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:26.960 
angle this is where a judge would
typically<00:03:25.440> be<00:03:25.560> seated<00:03:26.010> and<00:03:26.100> i<00:03:26.190> think<00:03:26.459> going

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
typically be seated and i think going

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:28.699 
typically be seated and i think going
forward<00:03:27.090> it<00:03:27.510> would<00:03:27.600> really<00:03:27.810> help<00:03:28.019> my<00:03:28.200> ego<00:03:28.530> if<00:03:28.650> I

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
forward it would really help my ego if I

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:30.410 
forward it would really help my ego if I
just<00:03:28.890> filmed<00:03:29.130> all<00:03:29.340> sets<00:03:29.640> like<00:03:29.790> this<00:03:29.850> just

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
just filmed all sets like this just

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:31.789 
just filmed all sets like this just
because<00:03:30.660> as<00:03:30.780> you<00:03:30.900> can<00:03:30.930> see<00:03:31.079> when<00:03:31.410> I<00:03:31.440> move<00:03:31.650> the

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799 
because as you can see when I move the

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:33.110 
because as you can see when I move the
camera<00:03:32.040> around<00:03:32.130> sometimes<00:03:32.760> it's<00:03:32.910> hard<00:03:33.090> to

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
camera around sometimes it's hard to

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.640 
camera around sometimes it's hard to
tell<00:03:33.329> from<00:03:33.450> hitting<00:03:33.660> depth<00:03:33.959> but<00:03:34.380> from<00:03:34.530> the

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
tell from hitting depth but from the

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.410 
tell from hitting depth but from the
side<00:03:34.829> view<00:03:34.859> in<00:03:35.130> my<00:03:35.280> opinion<00:03:35.670> there's<00:03:36.000> no<00:03:36.180> real

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
side view in my opinion there's no real

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.390 
side view in my opinion there's no real
doubt<00:03:36.630> so<00:03:36.900> really<00:03:37.380> happy<00:03:37.680> with<00:03:37.799> that<00:03:37.980> now

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
doubt so really happy with that now

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.710 
doubt so really happy with that now
another<00:03:38.579> thing<00:03:38.700> this<00:03:38.910> piquing<00:03:39.269> cycle<00:03:39.600> is

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
another thing this piquing cycle is

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.390 
another thing this piquing cycle is
going<00:03:39.900> to<00:03:40.019> allow<00:03:40.260> me<00:03:40.380> to<00:03:40.410> do<00:03:40.650> both<00:03:40.859> this<00:03:41.160> week

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
going to allow me to do both this week

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.849 
going to allow me to do both this week
and<00:03:41.609> next<00:03:41.640> week<00:03:42.090> is<00:03:42.390> really<00:03:42.450> allow<00:03:42.959> me<00:03:43.170> to<00:03:43.380> get

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:43.859 
and next week is really allow me to get

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:45.710 
and next week is really allow me to get
a<00:03:43.890> good<00:03:44.070> feel<00:03:44.310> of<00:03:44.459> where<00:03:44.670> my<00:03:44.820> opener<00:03:45.299> should<00:03:45.540> be

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
a good feel of where my opener should be

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.840 
a good feel of where my opener should be
so<00:03:46.230> the<00:03:46.350> wait<00:03:46.530> you<00:03:46.620> saw<00:03:46.799> ninety<00:03:47.190> percent<00:03:47.310> is

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:47.850 
so the wait you saw ninety percent is

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:50.479 
so the wait you saw ninety percent is
for<00:03:48.180> me<00:03:48.390> my<00:03:48.750> baseline<00:03:49.470> opener<00:03:50.010> meaning<00:03:50.310> that

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
for me my baseline opener meaning that

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:52.250 
for me my baseline opener meaning that
all<00:03:50.730> things<00:03:51.359> considered<00:03:51.870> if<00:03:51.959> I<00:03:52.019> don't<00:03:52.170> really

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
all things considered if I don't really

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:53.870 
all things considered if I don't really
feel<00:03:52.380> great<00:03:52.769> this<00:03:52.950> is<00:03:53.130> still<00:03:53.310> something<00:03:53.579> I

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
feel great this is still something I

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.580 
feel great this is still something I
should<00:03:54.060> be<00:03:54.180> able<00:03:54.299> to<00:03:54.510> do<00:03:54.720> now<00:03:55.200> typically

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
should be able to do now typically

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.259 
should be able to do now typically
speaking<00:03:55.920> what<00:03:56.310> I<00:03:56.340> say<00:03:56.609> is<00:03:56.790> you<00:03:57.180> know

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:57.269 
speaking what I say is you know

00:03:57.269 --> 00:03:58.789 
speaking what I say is you know
something<00:03:57.569> you<00:03:57.630> can<00:03:57.780> hit<00:03:57.900> for<00:03:58.140> an<00:03:58.230> easy<00:03:58.470> triple

00:03:58.789 --> 00:03:58.799 
something you can hit for an easy triple

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:00.110 
something you can hit for an easy triple
and<00:03:59.040> even<00:03:59.220> though<00:03:59.310> those<00:03:59.430> triples<00:03:59.850> didn't

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
and even though those triples didn't

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.900 
and even though those triples didn't
look<00:04:00.269> easy<00:04:00.569> for<00:04:01.230> me<00:04:01.350> today<00:04:01.560> hitting<00:04:02.430> four<00:04:02.670> sets

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
look easy for me today hitting four sets

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:04.250 
look easy for me today hitting four sets
of<00:04:03.060> three<00:04:03.359> that<00:04:03.540> kind<00:04:03.720> of<00:04:03.780> really<00:04:03.989> boost<00:04:04.170> my

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
of three that kind of really boost my

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:05.780 
of three that kind of really boost my
confidence<00:04:04.500> says<00:04:04.920> this<00:04:05.069> is<00:04:05.220> a<00:04:05.250> wait<00:04:05.459> I<00:04:05.489> should

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
confidence says this is a wait I should

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:07.430 
confidence says this is a wait I should
be<00:04:05.880> able<00:04:05.970> to<00:04:06.120> do<00:04:06.239> just<00:04:06.269> for<00:04:06.660> one<00:04:06.870> single<00:04:07.109> rep

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
be able to do just for one single rep

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.229 
be able to do just for one single rep
and<00:04:07.650> then<00:04:08.069> next<00:04:08.430> week<00:04:08.700> when<00:04:08.910> the<00:04:08.940> peaking

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
and then next week when the peaking

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:10.910 
and then next week when the peaking
cycle<00:04:09.630> when<00:04:09.780> the<00:04:09.900> weights<00:04:10.109> ramped<00:04:10.440> up<00:04:10.590> some

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920 
cycle when the weights ramped up some

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.620 
cycle when the weights ramped up some
that'll<00:04:11.459> give<00:04:11.639> me<00:04:11.790> kind<00:04:11.970> of<00:04:12.120> what<00:04:12.239> I<00:04:12.269> consider

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:12.630 
that'll give me kind of what I consider

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:15.229 
that'll give me kind of what I consider
my<00:04:12.810> top<00:04:13.079> line<00:04:13.380> opener<00:04:14.310> if<00:04:14.519> I<00:04:14.670> need<00:04:14.880> to<00:04:14.970> be<00:04:15.090> or

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 
my top line opener if I need to be or

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:17.270 
my top line opener if I need to be or
even<00:04:15.510> potentially<00:04:15.959> my<00:04:16.109> second<00:04:16.650> attempt<00:04:17.070> so

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
even potentially my second attempt so

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.009 
even potentially my second attempt so
I'm<00:04:17.430> really<00:04:17.609> glad<00:04:17.760> to<00:04:18.000> have<00:04:18.120> this<00:04:18.329> in<00:04:18.570> place<00:04:18.600> as

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:19.019 
I'm really glad to have this in place as

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:21.229 
I'm really glad to have this in place as
before<00:04:19.470> I<00:04:19.979> would<00:04:20.220> just<00:04:20.250> do<00:04:20.519> my<00:04:20.640> programming

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
before I would just do my programming

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:22.909 
before I would just do my programming
and<00:04:21.330> go<00:04:21.450> into<00:04:21.659> a<00:04:21.690> meat<00:04:21.959> and<00:04:22.169> kind<00:04:22.380> of<00:04:22.440> just<00:04:22.590> area

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919 
and go into a meat and kind of just area

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:24.020 
and go into a meat and kind of just area
well<00:04:23.010> this<00:04:23.130> is<00:04:23.250> what<00:04:23.430> I<00:04:23.460> think<00:04:23.669> my<00:04:23.760> what

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
well this is what I think my what

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:25.700 
well this is what I think my what
max's<00:04:24.510> let<00:04:25.020> me<00:04:25.080> kind<00:04:25.200> of<00:04:25.320> base<00:04:25.500> it<00:04:25.650> around

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:25.710 
max's let me kind of base it around

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:27.680 
max's let me kind of base it around
there<00:04:26.100> and<00:04:26.460> I<00:04:26.610> think<00:04:26.790> that's<00:04:26.940> played<00:04:27.270> into

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
there and I think that's played into

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:29.120 
there and I think that's played into
some<00:04:27.960> of<00:04:28.080> the<00:04:28.200> reasons<00:04:28.350> why<00:04:28.650> I<00:04:28.680> haven't<00:04:28.950> been

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.130 
some of the reasons why I haven't been

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:31.040 
some of the reasons why I haven't been
able<00:04:29.310> to<00:04:29.520> necessarily<00:04:29.670> put<00:04:30.330> a<00:04:30.510> nine<00:04:30.810> out<00:04:31.020> of

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
able to necessarily put a nine out of

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:32.960 
able to necessarily put a nine out of
nine<00:04:31.170> meet<00:04:31.590> together<00:04:31.770> I'm<00:04:32.160> not<00:04:32.310> saying<00:04:32.550> I<00:04:32.760> will

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.970 
nine meet together I'm not saying I will

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:34.280 
nine meet together I'm not saying I will
I<00:04:33.120> don't<00:04:33.270> want<00:04:33.389> to<00:04:33.450> give<00:04:33.570> myself<00:04:33.720> any<00:04:34.080> bad

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:34.290 
I don't want to give myself any bad

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:36.710 
I don't want to give myself any bad
karma<00:04:34.770> or<00:04:34.889> bad<00:04:35.040> juju<00:04:35.460> so<00:04:35.610> to<00:04:35.669> say<00:04:35.910> but<00:04:36.630> I'd

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720 
karma or bad juju so to say but I'd

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.440 
karma or bad juju so to say but I'd
really<00:04:37.139> like<00:04:37.380> to<00:04:37.440> hit<00:04:38.010> nine<00:04:38.310> at<00:04:38.490> a<00:04:38.520> nine<00:04:38.820> even

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:39.450 
really like to hit nine at a nine even

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:41.060 
really like to hit nine at a nine even
if<00:04:39.570> it's<00:04:39.720> at<00:04:39.870> the<00:04:39.900> cost<00:04:40.230> of<00:04:40.410> potentially

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:41.070 
if it's at the cost of potentially

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:43.490 
if it's at the cost of potentially
leaving<00:04:41.490> a<00:04:41.700> little<00:04:41.970> bit<00:04:42.120> on<00:04:42.300> the<00:04:42.450> platform<00:04:42.960> but

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:43.500 
leaving a little bit on the platform but

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:44.720 
leaving a little bit on the platform but
we'll<00:04:43.620> really<00:04:43.830> see<00:04:44.100> because<00:04:44.250> I<00:04:44.400> really<00:04:44.580> want

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:44.730 
we'll really see because I really want

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:47.480 
we'll really see because I really want
to<00:04:44.790> put<00:04:44.910> together<00:04:45.030> that<00:04:45.270> good<00:04:45.480> solid<00:04:46.320> meat<00:04:46.860> but

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:47.490 
to put together that good solid meat but

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:48.950 
to put together that good solid meat but
that<00:04:47.760> was<00:04:47.850> the<00:04:47.910> workout<00:04:48.150> so<00:04:48.300> just<00:04:48.450> ate<00:04:48.570> working

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 
that was the workout so just ate working

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.150 
that was the workout so just ate working
sets<00:04:49.200> it<00:04:49.350> actually<00:04:49.590> took<00:04:49.740> me<00:04:49.889> quite<00:04:50.010> a<00:04:50.100> while

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.160 
sets it actually took me quite a while

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:51.590 
sets it actually took me quite a while
just<00:04:50.490> because<00:04:50.760> the<00:04:50.850> weight<00:04:51.000> was<00:04:51.120> heavy<00:04:51.270> and<00:04:51.450> I

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:51.600 
just because the weight was heavy and I

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.600
