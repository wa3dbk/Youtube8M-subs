the old pet safe wireless system and it
was<00:00:36.480> supposed<00:00:36.809> to<00:00:36.899> be<00:00:37.050> easy<00:00:37.290> all<00:00:37.680> you<00:00:37.739> have<00:00:37.920> to

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
was supposed to be easy all you have to

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:39.950 
was supposed to be easy all you have to
do<00:00:38.250> is<00:00:38.370> switch<00:00:38.640> it<00:00:38.820> on<00:00:38.940> and<00:00:39.510> you're<00:00:39.690> ready<00:00:39.870> to

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
do is switch it on and you're ready to

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.650 
do is switch it on and you're ready to
go<00:00:40.110> now<00:00:40.770> don't<00:00:40.920> get<00:00:41.070> me<00:00:41.160> wrong<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.579> idea<00:00:41.660> was

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
go now don't get me wrong the idea was

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.830 
go now don't get me wrong the idea was
good<00:00:43.550> implementation<00:00:44.550> was<00:00:44.730> not<00:00:44.969> now<00:00:45.629> here's

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
good implementation was not now here's

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.529 
good implementation was not now here's

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
station looks a lot like a wireless

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.260 
station looks a lot like a wireless
router<00:00:55.590> or<00:00:56.010> if<00:00:56.340> you're<00:00:56.489> old<00:00:56.640> enough<00:00:56.730> your

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
router or if you're old enough your

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
first cell phone it also has these two

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.150 
first cell phone it also has these two
tall<00:01:00.390> antennas<00:01:00.960> but<00:01:01.350> it's<00:01:01.500> pretty<00:01:01.800> compact

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
tall antennas but it's pretty compact

needless<00:01:03.149> to<00:01:03.300> say<00:01:03.329> it's<00:01:03.809> much<00:01:04.080> smaller<00:01:04.379> than

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
needless to say it's much smaller than

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.910 
needless to say it's much smaller than

system<00:01:08.310> I<00:01:08.549> know<00:01:08.880> what<00:01:09.150> you're<00:01:09.299> thinking<00:01:09.720> and

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
system I know what you're thinking and

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.960 
system I know what you're thinking and
no<00:01:10.170> this<00:01:10.500> does<00:01:10.740> not<00:01:10.770> also<00:01:11.189> make<00:01:11.580> julienne

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
no this does not also make julienne

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.560 
no this does not also make julienne
fries<00:01:12.950> now<00:01:13.950> let<00:01:14.670> me<00:01:14.790> show<00:01:15.000> you<00:01:15.060> how<00:01:15.330> this

with<00:01:56.159> walls<00:01:56.430> and<00:01:56.549> trees<00:01:56.880> so<00:01:57.600> basically<00:01:57.990> if<00:01:58.380> it

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
with walls and trees so basically if it

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.950 
with walls and trees so basically if it
exists<00:01:59.100> it<00:01:59.250> could<00:01:59.640> pose<00:01:59.969> a<00:02:00.030> problem<00:02:00.180> to<00:02:00.810> this

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
exists it could pose a problem to this

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.679 
exists it could pose a problem to this
system<00:02:01.469> and<00:02:01.790> sometimes<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:03.060> signal<00:02:03.299> will

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
system and sometimes the signal will

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.499 
system and sometimes the signal will
drop<00:02:03.960> completely<00:02:04.290> out<00:02:04.790> even<00:02:05.790> when<00:02:06.090> the<00:02:06.270> caller

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
drop completely out even when the caller

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.660 
drop completely out even when the caller
is<00:02:06.780> sitting<00:02:07.140> right<00:02:07.380> beside<00:02:07.619> the<00:02:07.950> base<00:02:08.160> station

when<00:02:09.300> this<00:02:09.509> happened

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
when this happened

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.010 
when this happened
your<00:02:10.530> dog<00:02:10.770> is<00:02:11.040> completely<00:02:11.280> left<00:02:12.020> uncontained

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
your dog is completely left uncontained

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.590 
your dog is completely left uncontained

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600

at<00:02:15.840> the<00:02:16.200> base<00:02:16.380> station<00:02:16.920> so<00:02:17.730> if<00:02:17.850> you<00:02:18.030> live<00:02:18.240> in<00:02:18.270> a

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
a flat yard this system will probably

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.160 
a flat yard this system will probably
work<00:02:23.880> out<00:02:24.090> pretty<00:02:24.360> good<00:02:24.630> for<00:02:24.870> you

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
work out pretty good for you

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.980 
work out pretty good for you
problem<00:02:25.950> number<00:02:26.190> two<00:02:26.520> the<00:02:27.030> boundary<00:02:27.450> creates

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
problem number two the boundary creates

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.470 
problem number two the boundary creates
is<00:02:28.230> really<00:02:28.590> vague<00:02:28.860> and<00:02:29.130> can<00:02:29.370> move<00:02:29.670> five<00:02:30.030> to<00:02:30.270> ten

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
is really vague and can move five to ten

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.990 
is really vague and can move five to ten
feet<00:02:30.720> minutes<00:02:31.320> and<00:02:31.500> minutes<00:02:31.770> that<00:02:32.550> makes<00:02:32.820> it

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
feet minutes and minutes that makes it

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.240 
feet minutes and minutes that makes it
very<00:02:33.210> difficult<00:02:33.510> to<00:02:33.810> train<00:02:34.200> the<00:02:34.380> dog<00:02:34.590> because

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
very difficult to train the dog because

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.330 
very difficult to train the dog because
it<00:02:35.430> receives<00:02:35.940> the<00:02:36.150> correction<00:02:36.660> unpredictably

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
it receives the correction unpredictably

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.490 
it receives the correction unpredictably
also<00:02:38.340> the<00:02:38.820> correction<00:02:39.330> ends<00:02:39.870> unpredictably

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
also the correction ends unpredictably

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.890 
also the correction ends unpredictably
so<00:02:41.160> what<00:02:41.340> often<00:02:41.550> happens<00:02:42.090> is<00:02:42.270> that<00:02:42.630> dog

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
so what often happens is that dog

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.320 
so what often happens is that dog
receives<00:02:43.380> the<00:02:43.500> correction<00:02:44.100> too<00:02:44.400> late<00:02:44.670> but

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
receives the correction too late but

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.480 
receives the correction too late but
continues<00:02:45.930> to<00:02:46.110> receive<00:02:46.560> the<00:02:46.710> correction<00:02:47.190> even

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:47.490 
continues to receive the correction even

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:49.370 
continues to receive the correction even
when<00:02:47.670> they<00:02:47.790> do<00:02:47.850> the<00:02:48.090> right<00:02:48.240> thing<00:02:48.600> and<00:02:48.840> comes

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
when they do the right thing and comes

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.980 
when they do the right thing and comes
back<00:02:49.650> inside<00:02:49.860> the<00:02:50.280> boundary<00:02:50.810> problem<00:02:51.810> number
