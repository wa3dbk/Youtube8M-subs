00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
actually because it took 11 days for it

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.420 
actually because it took 11 days for it
to<00:00:47.730> get<00:00:47.910> from<00:00:48.270> there<00:00:48.690> to<00:00:48.719> here<00:00:49.200> which<00:00:49.980> I<00:00:50.250> mean

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
to get from there to here which I mean

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.240 
to get from there to here which I mean
even<00:00:50.789> snail<00:00:51.059> may<00:00:51.239> also<00:00:51.360> be<00:00:51.629> quicker<00:00:51.870> than<00:00:51.930> that

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.250 
even snail may also be quicker than that

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.600 
even snail may also be quicker than that
but<00:00:53.250> you<00:00:53.789> know<00:00:53.820> I<00:00:54.149> got<00:00:54.480> my<00:00:54.510> animals<00:00:55.250> only<00:00:56.250> two

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
Church to Turk matticus which is often

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.429 
Church to Turk matticus which is often
because<00:02:01.729> that<00:02:01.880> brings<00:02:02.360> our<00:02:02.539> total<00:02:02.570> torque

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:03.439 
because that brings our total torque

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:05.740 
because that brings our total torque
amanda<00:02:03.710> gets<00:02:03.860> up<00:02:04.070> to<00:02:04.219> 4<00:02:04.549> which<00:02:04.909> is<00:02:05.119> for<00:02:05.509> more

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750

down to what we're keeping except for a
few<00:02:15.200> select<00:02:15.590> animals<00:02:16.069> that<00:02:16.280> we're<00:02:16.370> going<00:02:16.459> to

00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:16.519 
few select animals that we're going to

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:19.170 
few select animals that we're going to
grow<00:02:16.730> up<00:02:16.760> to<00:02:16.910> you<00:02:17.239> what<00:02:17.390> they<00:02:17.510> look<00:02:17.540> like<00:02:17.980> so

that they've had kind of stressful

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:04.240 
that they've had kind of stressful
journey<00:03:03.140> so<00:03:03.500> we<00:03:03.590> don't<00:03:03.769> want<00:03:03.890> stretch<00:03:04.130> them

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
journey so we don't want stretch them

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.020 
journey so we don't want stretch them
out<00:03:04.340> even<00:03:04.790> more<00:03:04.840> I<00:03:05.840> am<00:03:06.590> going<00:03:07.190> to<00:03:07.489> start<00:03:07.850> making

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
out even more I am going to start making

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.860 
out even more I am going to start making
the<00:03:08.359> genetics<00:03:09.130> videos<00:03:10.130> just<00:03:10.579> so<00:03:10.850> people<00:03:11.510> can

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
the genetics videos just so people can

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.710 
the genetics videos just so people can
understand<00:03:12.319> what<00:03:12.680> reconnect<00:03:13.579> genetics<00:03:14.329> go

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
understand what reconnect genetics go

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.379 
understand what reconnect genetics go
into<00:03:15.019> the<00:03:15.139> stuff<00:03:15.700> so<00:03:16.700> everybody<00:03:17.030> knows<00:03:17.090> what

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:17.389 
into the stuff so everybody knows what

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:19.569 
into the stuff so everybody knows what
it's<00:03:17.510> nice<00:03:17.660> tune<00:03:17.900> is<00:03:18.200> which<00:03:18.620> if<00:03:18.829> you<00:03:18.950> go<00:03:19.160> here

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:19.579 
it's nice tune is which if you go here

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:21.520 
it's nice tune is which if you go here
and<00:03:19.819> under<00:03:20.359> a<00:03:20.389> rock<00:03:20.630> or<00:03:20.840> something<00:03:20.900> for<00:03:21.500> a

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
and under a rock or something for a

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:26.830 
and under a rock or something for a
while<00:03:21.940> and<00:03:22.940> then<00:03:24.250> we<00:03:25.250> will<00:03:25.519> go<00:03:25.579> through<00:03:25.840> talk

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
while and then we will go through talk

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.319 
while and then we will go through talk
about<00:03:27.139> all<00:03:27.889> the<00:03:28.010> genetic<00:03:28.190> combinations<00:03:29.000> how

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:29.329 
about all the genetic combinations how

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:31.620 
about all the genetic combinations how
you<00:03:29.389> get<00:03:29.690> them<00:03:29.900> what<00:03:30.319> the<00:03:30.440> percentages<00:03:30.980> are

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:31.630 
you get them what the percentages are

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:33.879 
you get them what the percentages are
we're<00:03:32.630> going<00:03:32.720> to<00:03:32.810> start<00:03:33.019> off<00:03:33.170> a<00:03:33.230> real<00:03:33.470> simple

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:33.889 
we're going to start off a real simple

00:03:33.889 --> 00:03:38.349 
we're going to start off a real simple
with<00:03:34.420> dominant<00:03:35.420> and<00:03:35.690> recessive<00:03:37.180> watch<00:03:38.180> on

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:38.359 
with dominant and recessive watch on

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:41.080 
with dominant and recessive watch on
codominant<00:03:39.139> will<00:03:39.650> go<00:03:39.799> with<00:03:40.010> line<00:03:40.489> bread<00:03:40.760> stuff

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
codominant will go with line bread stuff

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.539 
codominant will go with line bread stuff
then<00:03:41.480> we'll<00:03:41.660> go<00:03:41.780> with<00:03:42.079> like<00:03:42.380> double<00:03:43.250> triple

00:03:43.539 --> 00:03:43.549 
then we'll go with like double triple

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:46.539 
then we'll go with like double triple
quadruple<00:03:44.540> recessives<00:03:45.530> which<00:03:45.859> yes<00:03:46.220> they're

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:46.549 
quadruple recessives which yes they're

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:49.240 
quadruple recessives which yes they're
large<00:03:46.790> what<00:03:47.030> your<00:03:47.180> jewelry<00:03:47.540> sent<00:03:47.750> us<00:03:48.220> which<00:03:49.220> is

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 
large what your jewelry sent us which is

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:51.129 
large what your jewelry sent us which is
like<00:03:49.670> you<00:03:49.819> know<00:03:49.850> one<00:03:50.180> out<00:03:50.329> of<00:03:50.450> a<00:03:50.569> hundred<00:03:50.750> and

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:51.139 
like you know one out of a hundred and

00:03:51.139 --> 00:03:53.450 
like you know one out of a hundred and
something<00:03:51.519> 200<00:03:52.519> functions

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:53.460 
something 200 functions

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:55.670 
something 200 functions
it's<00:03:53.970> one<00:03:54.240> of<00:03:54.330> those<00:03:54.390> high<00:03:54.660> numbers<00:03:55.200> that<00:03:55.440> you

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
it's one of those high numbers that you

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.630 
it's one of those high numbers that you
know<00:03:55.890> you<00:03:56.400> gotta<00:03:56.640> step<00:03:56.970> in<00:03:57.120> poop<00:03:57.360> to<00:03:57.600> get<00:03:58.640> the

00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640 
know you gotta step in poop to get the

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.820 
know you gotta step in poop to get the
other<00:03:59.760> things<00:04:00.150> that<00:04:00.360> are<00:04:00.450> going<00:04:00.660> on<00:04:00.900> is<00:04:01.380> pretty
