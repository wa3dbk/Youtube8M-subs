00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 not having passed the threads we have 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.970
 to keep in mind here is the change of 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:09.030
 needles because it will work with a thread 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:11.639
 46 and this needle is a needle 110 of 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.840
 much thicker then I go back to 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.260
 place it I do something very important 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.789
 when we put the needle that the bar 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:20.810
 Need needle in the highest 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:23.920
 we entered here 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:23.920
 take into account 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:32.510
 we press people with their hands here 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:34.310
 soft go and when you see that it's okay in 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:36.880
 half the hole then yes 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:36.880
 we squeeze 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:41.200
 keep in mind that when we use 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:44.370
 screwdriver to tighten what 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:47.380
 we hold firm and we turn towards the 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.790
 part of the outside be very careful that 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:51.730
 sometimes we force him on I can not 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:53.130
 sing and we can not cut certain that 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:56.560
 this is very important 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:58.690
 ok then now I'm inside to 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.910
 threading the needle but here has another 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:03.010
 hole I want you to look good the 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:05.309
 camera out there should enter the thread 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:08.310
 also in the hour of the nebrada 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:13.399
 very important and split the cow in 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.399
 tip do not forget and there in the brahmos 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:20.620
 ok live here I realize that it is very 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:25.270
 color very well placed now we enter 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:28.780
 here and I hold and under 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:30.579
 And now Now 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.219
 we get to look with very important look and 

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:34.869
 it came out so that the thread from below very 

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:37.719
 important I want to do it again 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:39.290
 because I want to do it without the 

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:43.130
 teeth here 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:43.130
 I'm going to remove it again 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.960
 I'm going to remove it again 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:02:00.060
 these are exercises that we owe from 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.060
 see and do very calmly 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:06.460
 ok we put back here 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:09.420
 I put back here he 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.420
 yes 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.970
 and we enter it here 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.060
 It's very important 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.940
 okay 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.850
 then look look what I 'm going to do 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:28.430
 without the lid so that he looks like 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.670
 maneuver the free alpha thread I already hold 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:33.450
 here 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:37.420
 I have them here inside he produces there is a 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:40.200
 turn watch turns and the thread salt 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:43.500
 and he moves them away and then pulls them out with his hand 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.720
 and that you ready the machine to start 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.400
 sew give me a picture of those from 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.300
 exercises that they have them that they have 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:53.230
 repeat 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:55.400
 not on grid paper paper 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:59.439
 give once 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.439
 this one from someone for the portfolio does not 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:10.650
 well then here in this something very 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:11.910
 important both from within that 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.910
 I go in the corner 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:17.840
 I hold the thread here and inside in all the 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:20.060
 corner where I will enter to locate 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.550
 and in the whole corner when I 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:24.010
 I entered since I must have high vacancies 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:28.360
 raiting 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:31.620
 and I hold it there first understand 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:34.730
 the thread just enter the needle and 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:38.450
 I ended up entering the needle 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:42.230
 in age in that little part now 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:45.620
 I hold the shoot high and took it towards 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:48.290
 here and the floor of that is very important 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:51.800
 now if I'm just going to start 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:54.129
 here I can make it a suit or an auction to 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.129
 hand 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:59.410
 here and then if I come, I will learn 

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:03.860
 machine 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:06.700
 and we're going to take this quote part 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:06.700
 very soft 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:16.840
 when I got here to the corner I'm 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:19.090
 telling you to try shots of 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:21.310
 slave the needle something very important 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:23.130
 when I go to make a turn must be left 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:27.130
 the needle pinned to be able to lift and 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:29.970
 achieve the right turn you 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:29.970
 it is very important 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:41.250
 when I arrive here where I 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:43.410
 I need to stop if I do not want to do the 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:46.230
 hand finish that is the most illogical of 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:48.930
 this lever illuminates pallet table 

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:51.990
 This lever is responsible for making 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:54.090
 the retracement of the speech or here when and 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:56.550
 when I have her down between her 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:58.860
 automatically reverse me when I the 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:01.009
 luck goes forward from aa3 me 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:04.550
 he made the auction 

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:08.080
 and we are going to do an exercise here 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:11.029
 so that he captures it very well the machine is 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:12.309
 very important from the thread and 

00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:15.020
 you guys if you want to have some 

00:05:12.309 --> 00:05:17.779
 excellent sewing kits should break it 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:20.180
 here very close what is it that we 

00:05:17.779 --> 00:05:21.889
 help helps us that trainers do not 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:23.719
 have to be entangled with this thread 

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:26.129
 and burst and that we go to bed 

00:05:23.719 --> 00:05:29.270
 from the beginning to cut very well 

00:05:26.129 --> 00:05:29.270
 Yes sir 

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:35.620
 because two centuries is for them to do 

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:40.060
 political loop we will specify in 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:41.729
 board reason for the needle 

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:44.370
 needle 

00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:46.830
 must go with the hole cow and how it 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:49.139
 link the two threads ready I think the 

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:51.629
 question good good ok 

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:53.999
 we already passed what was a stitching of pt 

00:05:51.629 --> 00:05:56.339
 with a shot carry by edge and 

00:05:53.999 --> 00:05:59.210
 I ended up with the right shot you I 

00:05:56.339 --> 00:06:01.069
 to do the same exercise 

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:02.900
 but fork and tacos I will not start 

00:06:01.069 --> 00:06:06.039
 with the auction I'm not going to do it 

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:06.039
 machine then here in this 

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:11.200
 I take one usually a stitch 

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:13.660
 low here 

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:16.440
 immediately illuminates from my cameraman 

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:16.440
 it has to be 

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:22.330
 so I give it the tip and it's here 

00:06:19.849 --> 00:06:22.330
 backward 

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:30.080
 and if I get inside something very important comes 

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:30.080
 that will happen here that they will observe
