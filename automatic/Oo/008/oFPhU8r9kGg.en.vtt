 recommend to use very comfortable 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:34.619
 a thing there are situations when you 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.509

 the tablet is dead they are afraid with what it is 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.780
 it does not even allow you 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:45.299
 track this meniscus once so what was it 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.610
 then I had applications like that 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.740

 In addition to this, this application we can 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.569
 put a different widget which immediately 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:15.709
