00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:09.000
 update of the pokemon ice lock challenge 

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:11.130
 what if I know what the ice logically 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.870
 it is a celebration version of the 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.080
 nasdaq challenge that I thought up 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.179
 have and everyone joins in or leather 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.800
 that would like to do as a display or synonymous 

00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:22.380
 as a playboy 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.449
 still can be video as a video 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:28.349
 answer below below I post 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:31.070
 will accept it automatically as soon as that 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.329
 this challenge includes 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.309
 Let us now come to the rules I will 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.750
 all rules consistently saving have 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.600
 changed pairs have stayed the same 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.129
 and there comes rule 1 at least four 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.140
 Pokemon should be up to the eighth floor 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.940
 be reached so that you do not have summer 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.469
 otherwise you will become one and then you will 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.309
 the technically too easy cures 

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:51.629
 that for the cure 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.579
 you are allowed you completely once a 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.789
 if you invest a shark point for it 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.730
 every time you have a poker center resp 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.620
 batman or nurse like that 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.999
 you may find you get the two points 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:07.170
 and you can accordingly there still 

00:01:02.999 --> 00:01:12.210
 heal so cook &amp; black 2 i have that 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:14.790
 changed from 2 points to 1 5 points there 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.100
 on the routes too many are the like 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.759
 sisters doctors additionally 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.770
 may fall 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.149
 you get the home arena victory 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.360
 additional point that is already think 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:26.189
 to be used clearly in pension there 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.570
 be picked up as a mother when 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:32.070
 the amount is 2000 cups or more 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:34.649
 Story Flicht Division costs no salvation 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.509
 points at Kreisler tells as 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:40.159
 off duty division who then 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:42.899
 new items latscht sacrifices a home point 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:44.759
 So nurse similar goal 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:48.149
 not as a collective agreement that is 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:50.219
 even if you 're in there because they are 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.950
 want to fight against you counts as 

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:55.140
 normal healing in such a cure so 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.109
 you can not shop more than 5000 in the shop 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:01.409
 spend dollars 

00:01:57.109 --> 00:02:04.109
 nemanja shop that applies to items like 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:07.649
 poker balls potions antivenom teams or 

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:09.450
 similar so the arcade in the 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.280
 Pension are not affected 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.570
 the restriction for the pension lies 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.800
 at 7000 poker dollars 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:15.810
 I have inserted this rule 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.370
 in addition, because many have meant 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.240
 could a puncture then over 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.650
 level clearly 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.740
 that's why I have these limited ones 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.750
 now blow it up as soon as the first 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:28.440
 even the first wave holds true 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:31.310
 the pokémon challenge is tele 5 1 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:34.020
 or section 5 of the rules 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:36.120
 only the first one is pokémon what you open 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:38.430
 a new route clinging cave cities 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:43.230
 several encounters may be caught 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:45.270
 as well as the nasdaq change too 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.380
 defeated pokémon is no longer allowed 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.820
 must be used as fast as 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:51.230
 possible to put on a box the 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:53.880
 as for example with abbreviated 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:56.360
 when ten pokemon was defeated it sees 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.360
 challenge lost 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.420
 every pokémon may only have one tm 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.350
 be taught 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.030
 hermsdorf other topics daphne against 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:07.710
 other topics are unlearned or if 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:10.080
 you a new attack of yourself 

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:12.330
 learned about putting it does not matter then 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.190
 the tm is not in there anymore 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:16.650
 Fires are not affected by this 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:18.270
 attack helper count as tm that had to 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:23.030
 I add because there was one 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:25.950
 few ask for such special cases 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:28.520
 responsive pokémon tree horaser 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:31.200
 may be caught e mail 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:34.290
 he should then catch though you then 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:37.380
 seen on this route a pokémon 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:39.120
 have escape pokémon 3q matthias or 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:40.650
 scheine pokémon are allowed only at the first 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.330
 be caught 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:47.400
 what probably pokemon yes somehow 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:50.910
 it is clear that they rarely come of all 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:52.920
 Things whose pokémon is above the above level 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:56.940
 41 may be caught only after the 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:58.920
 top 4 can be used as a gift 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:01.690
 poken and allowed to use swap 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:07.220
 the mpc it is allowed 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:09.349
 so then comes this rule fossils 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:14.330
 or problem a game room 

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:15.830
 Yes, counting is an encounter 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:17.570
 So they fall under the rule of five 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:19.010
 Things in this city already as one 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:21.109
 Cover handled by then 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:24.280
 no foot goal is to develop or 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:24.280
 draw a poker game hall 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:40.889
 ok pokémon allowed only with full coffee 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:43.560
 and then put on the box afterwards 

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:47.790
 are there still the special frank places the 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:51.510
 safari zone is expected to be a total of three 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:55.760
 Pokemon catch after the eighth encounter 

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:58.620
 the rule does not apply approx 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:00.479
 and 5a regular active again the 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:02.760
 means you are allowed eight pokémon and you 

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:05.760
 let them meet and you are allowed three of them 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:07.620
 then catch that you are seen that way 

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:09.720
 only one sure after that's the rule 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:12.810
 Are you for a one-time participation 

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:15.960
 without restrictions at the beetle park 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:18.479
 only applies to gold silver crystal 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:20.550
 no pedestrian zone gives many remakes 

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:21.380
 this is not necessary because the one safari zone 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:24.930
 to have 

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:27.090
 so and now the last rule resp 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:29.610
 in quotation marks are not as nc 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:32.000
 regulates sex as a note wax 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:35.460
 or are logically not allowed 

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.110
 yes , I was meant to be there too 

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:40.050
 and I was told I could 

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:41.580
 could just clone everything on the 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:43.560
 silver gold for example and could be 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:44.820
 make it all very easy that it 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:46.710
 not meaning and purpose of the challenge 

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:51.300
 That's why I have it again at the end 

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:54.180
 be noted if it still ask 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:57.150
 then she could be in the comments 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:59.520
 I will write if possible 

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:01.500
 answer and I would say 

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:03.750
 say goodbye i hope i could 

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:05.310
 the rule would all understand and would be good 

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:07.139
 say, see you next time 

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:10.940
 or in the Eislinger 

00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:10.940
 challenge again until then
