00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.660
 scene for us 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.720
 to me I really am really 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.830
 stressed because I did not know at all 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.860
 what to expect is the first time 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:19.470
 that I do it and suddenly once the 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.979
 start up there I was really if you 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.979
 are really good 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:35.770
 and sparkle and energy for masters 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.770
 class that will lead his team 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.380
 for sure, the quality of the landscapes 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.640
 when you because you come with that 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.690
 you have the Eiffel Tower there right next 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.690
 roof happened is extraordinary 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:16.900
 it's great because the decor the eggs 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:19.290
 and navigate under the eiffel tower it's a 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.290
 crazy thing 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.930
 well I felt good I was not 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.819
 tiring at no time I was tired 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.690
 and suddenly in the end I could give everything 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:28.690
 here 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.540
 the competition 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.189
 in fact the race so starts at the 

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:52.069
 National Library of France and finished 

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:54.790
 on the docks in front of microsoft 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:56.469
 so it was quite logical to 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:59.680
 to become a partner of the event 

00:02:56.469 --> 00:03:02.109
