it's over this way ethernet although of

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.190 
it's over this way ethernet although of
course<00:02:40.220> we<00:02:40.520> got<00:02:40.640> altitude<00:02:40.880> 11n<00:02:41.570> built<00:02:41.870> in<00:02:42.050> as

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
course we got altitude 11n built in as

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:47.080 
course we got altitude 11n built in as
well<00:02:42.730> and<00:02:44.170> then<00:02:45.170> the<00:02:45.350> AV<00:02:45.800> block<00:02:45.920> out<00:02:46.250> this<00:02:46.910> is<00:02:47.060> a

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
well and then the AV block out this is a

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.450 
well and then the AV block out this is a
new<00:02:47.330> power<00:02:47.810> connector<00:02:48.410> compared<00:02:49.310> to<00:02:49.340> the

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:49.460 
new power connector compared to the

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:51.610 
new power connector compared to the
current<00:02:49.580> one<00:02:49.820> which<00:02:50.090> we've<00:02:50.330> got<00:02:50.510> the<00:02:51.080> male<00:02:51.410> end

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
current one which we've got the male end

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.750 
current one which we've got the male end
on<00:02:51.770> this<00:02:51.890> end

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.369 

and<00:02:56.209> then<00:02:56.569> somewhere<00:02:56.900> around<00:02:56.989> here<00:02:57.170> there's

00:02:57.369 --> 00:02:57.379 
and then somewhere around here there's

00:02:57.379 --> 00:03:01.569 
and then somewhere around here there's
the<00:02:57.709> new<00:02:57.830> hard<00:02:58.069> drive<00:03:00.040> have<00:03:01.040> to<00:03:01.189> ask<00:03:01.310> about

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:01.579 
the new hard drive have to ask about

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:03.550 
the new hard drive have to ask about
that<00:03:01.640> there<00:03:02.269> is<00:03:02.390> a<00:03:02.659> way<00:03:02.959> to<00:03:02.989> remove<00:03:03.379> the

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
that there is a way to remove the

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.289 
that there is a way to remove the
current<00:03:03.799> hard<00:03:03.950> drive<00:03:04.220> it's<00:03:04.849> hard<00:03:05.030> to<00:03:05.060> do<00:03:05.180> it

00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:05.299 
current hard drive it's hard to do it

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:12.699 
current hard drive it's hard to do it
elegantly

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:15.830 

now<00:03:13.709> you<00:03:13.950> can<00:03:14.069> see<00:03:14.189> there's<00:03:14.370> a<00:03:14.659> 250<00:03:15.659> gigabyte

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
now you can see there's a 250 gigabyte

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:24.940 
now you can see there's a 250 gigabyte
label<00:03:16.409> on<00:03:16.530> it<00:03:19.010> and<00:03:20.010> then<00:03:20.609> I<00:03:20.879> can<00:03:21.120> just<00:03:21.150> pop<00:03:22.079> it

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:26.899 

how<00:03:25.950> do<00:03:26.010> you<00:03:26.069> feel<00:03:26.219> about<00:03:26.249> transferring<00:03:26.760> data

00:03:26.899 --> 00:03:26.909 
how do you feel about transferring data

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:28.940 
how do you feel about transferring data
from<00:03:27.209> the<00:03:27.299> existing<00:03:27.719> xbox<00:03:28.319> so<00:03:28.620> if<00:03:28.680> you<00:03:28.769> have<00:03:28.859> an

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
from the existing xbox so if you have an

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.910 
from the existing xbox so if you have an
existing<00:03:29.040> console<00:03:29.780> it's<00:03:30.780> the<00:03:30.959> same<00:03:31.200> data

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
existing console it's the same data

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.140 
existing console it's the same data
transfer<00:03:32.310> process<00:03:32.670> that<00:03:32.790> we<00:03:32.849> have<00:03:33.000> today

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
transfer process that we have today

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.270 
transfer process that we have today
actually<00:03:33.389> so<00:03:33.840> you<00:03:34.500> can<00:03:34.650> use<00:03:34.829> the<00:03:35.040> data

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
actually so you can use the data

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.390 
actually so you can use the data
transfer<00:03:35.719> which<00:03:36.719> we<00:03:36.989> are<00:03:37.319> actually<00:03:38.069> going<00:03:38.310> to

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
transfer which we are actually going to

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.640 
transfer which we are actually going to
make<00:03:38.549> a<00:03:38.579> retail<00:03:39.090> product<00:03:39.480> so<00:03:39.959> you<00:03:40.049> can<00:03:40.169> now<00:03:40.260> buy

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
make a retail product so you can now buy

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:44.149 
make a retail product so you can now buy
that<00:03:40.859> for<00:03:41.040> 1995<00:03:41.609> in<00:03:42.540> the<00:03:42.689> US<00:03:42.959> you<00:03:43.680> can<00:03:43.799> also<00:03:43.919> do

00:03:44.149 --> 00:03:44.159 
that for 1995 in the US you can also do

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:46.640

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
like speed changes to the drive is just

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:07.429 
like speed changes to the drive is just
larger<00:04:05.969> there<00:04:06.269> any<00:04:06.419> optimizations<00:04:07.139> you<00:04:07.260> guys

00:04:07.429 --> 00:04:07.439 
larger there any optimizations you guys

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:10.939 
larger there any optimizations you guys
have<00:04:07.650> done<00:04:07.680> as<00:04:08.099> far<00:04:08.310> as<00:04:08.549> part<00:04:09.709> freely<00:04:10.709> that

00:04:10.939 --> 00:04:10.949 
have done as far as part freely that

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:12.439 
have done as far as part freely that
might<00:04:11.159> actually<00:04:11.310> improve<00:04:11.790> my<00:04:11.969> game<00:04:12.030> load

00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:12.449 
might actually improve my game load

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:14.539 
might actually improve my game load
times<00:04:12.659> right<00:04:12.930> now<00:04:13.199> so<00:04:13.620> performance<00:04:14.310> you<00:04:14.459> know

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:14.549 
times right now so performance you know

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:15.649 
times right now so performance you know
the<00:04:14.639> drives<00:04:14.849> are<00:04:15.000> always<00:04:15.180> gonna<00:04:15.269> be<00:04:15.359> going<00:04:15.569> up

00:04:15.649 --> 00:04:15.659 
the drives are always gonna be going up

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:17.449 
the drives are always gonna be going up
in<00:04:15.810> performance<00:04:16.259> but<00:04:16.889> there<00:04:17.039> wasn't<00:04:17.190> you

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
in performance but there wasn't you

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:19.219 
in performance but there wasn't you
there's<00:04:17.849> there's<00:04:18.180> always<00:04:18.419> optimization<00:04:19.079> but

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:19.229 
there's there's always optimization but

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:21.050 
there's there's always optimization but
nothing<00:04:19.500> specific<00:04:19.769> it's<00:04:20.159> not<00:04:20.340> twice<00:04:20.729> as<00:04:20.909> fast

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
nothing specific it's not twice as fast

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.379 
nothing specific it's not twice as fast
or<00:04:21.329> anything<00:04:22.340> alright<00:04:23.340> so<00:04:23.550> get<00:04:23.880> back<00:04:24.000> to<00:04:24.240> the

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:24.389 
or anything alright so get back to the

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:27.499 
or anything alright so get back to the
power<00:04:24.840> brick<00:04:25.080> here<00:04:25.880> which<00:04:26.880> is<00:04:27.030> quite<00:04:27.240> light

00:04:27.499 --> 00:04:27.509 
power brick here which is quite light

00:04:27.509 --> 00:04:30.439 
power brick here which is quite light
now<00:04:27.690> compared<00:04:28.110> to<00:04:28.139> the<00:04:28.349> original<00:04:29.250> one<00:04:29.729> but<00:04:29.909> not

00:04:30.439 --> 00:04:30.449 
now compared to the original one but not

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:33.560 
now compared to the original one but not
really<00:04:30.630> that<00:04:30.810> much<00:04:30.990> smaller<00:04:32.240> still<00:04:33.240> a<00:04:33.270> lights

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:33.570 
really that much smaller still a lights

it is or isn't that the shiny is that
different

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:31.310
