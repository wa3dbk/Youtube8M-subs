 hello nice that you look at one again 

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:05.069
 new video here on an ultimate mine 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.359
 name is now director ie full time and 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.130
 today i'm back with a new one 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.570
 episode of minecraft disease series 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.139
 which of course is finally my series 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.540
 on 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.950
 daily haa dee but that you do now 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.080
 here also occasionally 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.699
 and what I'm going to do today is a little further 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.199
 the hut hagrid 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.330
 as you probably like the title 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.289
 have seen and in this episode we go 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.590
 momentarily 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.880
 working on the pumpkin grunge hedge 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.320
 it because a lot of people have it 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.769
 and of course I don't want you 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.210
 disappoint 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.520
 So what are we going to do? 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:39.059
 small pumpkin thank you here 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:41.670
 today with a scarecrow and 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:46.079
 so big but so little things 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:48.870
 nevertheless what a board dessel from 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.300
 throw despite that we'll just call 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.489
 to make nice video so hopefully 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.989
 the sentence so of course the main entrance 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.000
 so he must introduce you to blah 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.559
 blah blah blah blah that is such a suit you 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
 it goes all the way through 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.000
 Hogwarts possibly and so 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.339
 possibly there is no need and who is not you 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.750
 I can also walk in another direction 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.840
 so we go a little bit 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:13.500
 Here kitty resign as of racing pot 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:16.680
 really true that's completely 100% true 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:19.290
 let me do well for a while 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.150
 so that is the path but here 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.340
 here the natural comes to here 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.320
 is the tank so that what we briefly 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.960
 going to do is make sure that we 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.700
 make a garden indeed 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.810
 and then we actually start with something 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.119
 very simple 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.490
 and that is namely scare bird and 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.439
 actually like my birds colored 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.479
 then we don't want to go to the union in mali 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:44.250
 get hold of god 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:46.590
 he becomes way of that is the head 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.060
 and the ones that have started video 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.149
 so then we go do it now we go now 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.610
 just put something random that way 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.560
 And this is going to be a pumpkin field 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.369
 do a bit random because i do 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.759
 the feeling huh 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:01.590
 so hedge it minutes rest 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.640
 and then very quickly 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.630
 boring out 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.729
 and so of course we want it all 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:10.709
 not so what I'm really going to do is 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:11.430
 throw down a bit of gravel 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.379
 to lay 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.829
 haagse and we are going a bit too 

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:18.239
 run and then we'll have nice later 

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:20.519
 little garden 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:22.829
 to be enveloped and then we can all 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:24.269
 I go to sleep again with peace of mind 

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:26.670
 was on not forgotten boys 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:27.659
 but I didn't want too much at once 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.209
 to do 

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:32.549
 or other for so white long and yes then 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:33.840
 nobody is even watching it but not 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:36.420
 all of them 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:39.629
 because yes it is too long you must own them 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.189
 hide pro and yes that also goes for 

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:43.590
 to happen 

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:45.389
 so that's why I do this for a while 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.980
 extra department you think this is very much 

00:02:45.389 --> 00:02:49.769
 find what on the me also just the what 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.750
 more often a construction video comes online again 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:54.209
 also here on noble that you replace 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:57.060
 just another stuffed animal 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:58.260
 so that should also be a positive 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.439
 crash venture 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.790
 l90 plus pigeon it also became no it 

00:03:01.439 --> 00:03:06.180
 must be something positive i think 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:09.079
 that something more slightly more often construction 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:12.719
 episodes here on a dick coming 

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:14.760
 so related to the makers who 3 

00:03:12.719 --> 00:03:15.720
 series especially why that is 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.120
 of course very easy 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.650
 that means i'm in the mycroft idea 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.449
 series just how can focus on it 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:24.209
 build that in the episode we build 

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:26.040
 and when i find out hey of this is 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:27.540
 just not that big and i still have it 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.239
 just need more time to take it further 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:32.340
 make beautiful then I can just do that 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:34.560
 to do a kiss here on my channel 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:38.400
 and the people who want to sing yes 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:40.379
 who able to see that that is mine 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.930
 the mind behind 

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:44.720
 she doesn't know I have it again 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:48.050
 thoughts 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:49.370
 so this will be a nice garden 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:51.980
 of course coin is everything because I want 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.960
 a little more than just a little one 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:56.540
 place a few blocks and the 

00:03:53.960 --> 00:04:01.340
 so what we are going to do is just a few blocks 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:04.760
 and of course we go with it 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.650
 just do something more than just something 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:09.250
 we have now 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:13.190
 because yes this is a bit very bad 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:16.209
 times and so is times he wants of course 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:20.890
 Also not that this really is the only thing 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:20.890
 that we did tap 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:27.320
 so we still have a kind 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:31.430
 wall to shield it a bit 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:36.820
 say thought is obviously 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:39.800
 down and get the whining doing it here 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:42.070
 look hear what you sir before you we this 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.070
 here 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:54.020
 oh there, and so we want 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:56.780
 than this one 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:05:02.150
 yes bm wall we can still have one 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:07.880
 running through wall wants to look and everything 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:09.910
 do it all right all the way up 

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:13.900
 words 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:16.450
 we still have something like this we are the wall 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:21.640
 your tent a little tidy 

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:22.870
 protected to him elst her group one 

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:25.900
 word god 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:30.730
 so it is to content you 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:33.390
 van haag the extra stuff here and 

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:33.390
 put it there 

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:39.690
 just because of course we can 

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:39.690
 that for a moment 

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:44.680
 because yes it is hedge it and learn 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:46.750
 actually that is oily hair 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:48.250
 home china bodi just has everywhere 

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:50.740
 stuff 

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:52.720
 so it's very easy to put something there 

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:55.840
 and then extra details there 

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:57.850
