would be good too the idea is to combine
this<00:02:44.340> with<00:02:44.940> that<00:02:45.680> but<00:02:46.680> this<00:02:46.920> little<00:02:47.760> thing

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
this with that but this little thing

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.890 
this with that but this little thing
cannot<00:02:48.390> be<00:02:48.450> disturbed<00:02:49.019> right<00:02:50.030> so<00:02:51.030> we<00:02:51.630> want<00:02:51.810> to

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
cannot be disturbed right so we want to

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:58.210 
cannot be disturbed right so we want to
take<00:02:52.320> this<00:02:52.650> yes<00:02:53.220> and<00:02:54.019> add<00:02:55.019> that<00:02:55.200> right<00:02:55.440> right

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
take this yes and add that right right

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.550

now<00:02:59.220> we<00:02:59.280> got<00:02:59.459> to<00:02:59.549> figure<00:02:59.700> out<00:02:59.790> a<00:02:59.910> way<00:03:00.000> to

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
now we got to figure out a way to

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.490 
now we got to figure out a way to
prevent<00:03:01.700> little<00:03:02.700> problems<00:03:03.299> that<00:03:04.110> could<00:03:04.380> occur

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
prevent little problems that could occur

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.440 
prevent little problems that could occur
maybe<00:03:05.100> some<00:03:05.370> rules<00:03:05.549> or<00:03:05.730> something<00:03:05.940> you<00:03:06.390> know

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
maybe some rules or something you know
