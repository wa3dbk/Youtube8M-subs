preview on my most recent project I've
been<00:00:06.160> taking<00:00:06.700> time<00:00:06.880> to<00:00:07.150> film<00:00:07.540> it<00:00:07.720> as<00:00:07.930> I've<00:00:08.109> been

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:08.230 
been taking time to film it as I've been

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:12.169 
been taking time to film it as I've been
going<00:00:09.030> eventually<00:00:10.030> I<00:00:10.059> think<00:00:10.150> I'll<00:00:10.540> load<00:00:11.349> a

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
going eventually I think I'll load a

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.819 
going eventually I think I'll load a
movie<00:00:13.179> file<00:00:13.419> on<00:00:13.719> some<00:00:14.019> kind<00:00:14.230> of<00:00:14.289> web<00:00:14.499> server

00:00:14.819 --> 00:00:14.829 
movie file on some kind of web server

00:00:14.829 --> 00:00:16.890 
movie file on some kind of web server
somewhere<00:00:15.219> so<00:00:15.669> that<00:00:15.700> people<00:00:16.180> can<00:00:16.360> download<00:00:16.510> it

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:16.900 
somewhere so that people can download it

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:18.660 
somewhere so that people can download it
but<00:00:16.990> it's<00:00:17.140> going<00:00:17.230> to<00:00:17.320> be<00:00:17.440> like<00:00:17.620> more<00:00:18.280> than<00:00:18.520> an

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:18.670 
but it's going to be like more than an

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:21.870 
but it's going to be like more than an
hour<00:00:18.880> so<00:00:19.480> I<00:00:19.810> don't<00:00:20.710> know<00:00:20.920> if<00:00:21.040> I<00:00:21.220> would<00:00:21.610> like<00:00:21.760> to

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:21.880 
hour so I don't know if I would like to

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.030 
hour so I don't know if I would like to
want<00:00:22.150> to<00:00:22.270> post<00:00:22.540> that<00:00:22.780> on<00:00:22.990> YouTube<00:00:23.470> directly

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:24.040 
want to post that on YouTube directly

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.310 
want to post that on YouTube directly
but<00:00:24.700> this<00:00:24.970> is<00:00:25.180> what<00:00:25.390> I've<00:00:25.540> been<00:00:25.570> building<00:00:25.810> I'm

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:26.320 
but this is what I've been building I'm

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.900 
but this is what I've been building I'm
still<00:00:26.920> waiting<00:00:27.370> for<00:00:27.400> a<00:00:27.880> part<00:00:28.330> you<00:00:29.260> see<00:00:29.470> this

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
still waiting for a part you see this

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.630 
still waiting for a part you see this
this<00:00:30.910> thing<00:00:31.300> right<00:00:31.660> here<00:00:31.690> is<00:00:32.370> going<00:00:33.370> to<00:00:33.489> be<00:00:33.609> a

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:33.640 
this thing right here is going to be a

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.139 
this thing right here is going to be a
cold<00:00:33.969> frame<00:00:34.480> or<00:00:34.749> a<00:00:34.809> mini<00:00:35.379> greenhouse<00:00:36.070> form<00:00:36.579> for

00:00:37.139 --> 00:00:37.149 
cold frame or a mini greenhouse form for

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:39.959 
cold frame or a mini greenhouse form for
my<00:00:37.390> deck<00:00:37.660> garden<00:00:38.260> and<00:00:38.469> you<00:00:39.399> can<00:00:39.579> see<00:00:39.789> the

00:00:39.959 --> 00:00:39.969 
my deck garden and you can see the

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:42.410 
my deck garden and you can see the
garden<00:00:40.480> out<00:00:40.659> there<00:00:40.899> see<00:00:41.140> the<00:00:41.260> earth<00:00:41.409> boxes

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
garden out there see the earth boxes

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.739 
garden out there see the earth boxes
well<00:00:43.420> anyway<00:00:44.519> the<00:00:45.519> idea<00:00:45.550> is<00:00:46.030> to<00:00:46.239> extend<00:00:46.629> my

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:46.749 
well anyway the idea is to extend my

00:00:46.749 --> 00:00:49.529 
well anyway the idea is to extend my
growing<00:00:47.050> season<00:00:47.679> for<00:00:48.069> most<00:00:48.819> or<00:00:49.179> maybe<00:00:49.359> even

00:00:49.529 --> 00:00:49.539 
growing season for most or maybe even

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:53.040 
growing season for most or maybe even
all<00:00:49.899> of<00:00:49.929> the<00:00:50.230> year<00:00:50.679> and<00:00:50.859> for<00:00:51.819> example<00:00:52.600> I<00:00:52.809> still

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:53.050 
all of the year and for example I still

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:54.930 
all of the year and for example I still
got<00:00:53.170> lettuce<00:00:53.409> out<00:00:53.739> there<00:00:53.979> it<00:00:54.159> sort<00:00:54.370> of<00:00:54.550> stopped

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:54.940 
got lettuce out there it sort of stopped

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:56.939 
got lettuce out there it sort of stopped
growing<00:00:55.569> during<00:00:55.749> the<00:00:55.960> winter<00:00:56.199> and<00:00:56.649> I've<00:00:56.739> got

00:00:56.939 --> 00:00:56.949 
growing during the winter and I've got

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:02.459 
growing during the winter and I've got
chives<00:00:57.309> as<00:00:57.729> well<00:00:58.019> but<00:00:59.489> but<00:01:00.489> basically<00:01:01.260> if<00:01:02.260> I

00:01:02.459 --> 00:01:02.469 
chives as well but but basically if I

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:04.829 
chives as well but but basically if I
can<00:01:02.679> warm<00:01:03.100> them<00:01:03.309> up<00:01:03.519> and<00:01:03.789> give<00:01:04.390> them<00:01:04.420> a<00:01:04.719> better

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:04.839 
can warm them up and give them a better

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:06.450 
can warm them up and give them a better
environment<00:01:05.560> they'll<00:01:05.770> probably<00:01:06.070> start

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:06.460 
environment they'll probably start

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.819 
environment they'll probably start
producing<00:01:06.700> again<00:01:07.180> and<00:01:07.420> I<00:01:08.170> can<00:01:08.350> plant<00:01:08.649> the

00:01:08.819 --> 00:01:08.829 
producing again and I can plant the

00:01:08.829 --> 00:01:10.319 
producing again and I can plant the
other<00:01:08.979> boxes<00:01:09.460> and<00:01:09.640> stuff<00:01:09.880> like<00:01:10.000> that

00:01:10.319 --> 00:01:10.329 
other boxes and stuff like that

00:01:10.329 --> 00:01:13.709 
other boxes and stuff like that
this<00:01:10.450> thing<00:01:10.689> has<00:01:11.500> room<00:01:11.979> for<00:01:12.340> four<00:01:12.700> earth<00:01:13.119> boxes

00:01:13.709 --> 00:01:13.719 
this thing has room for four earth boxes

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:16.740 
this thing has room for four earth boxes
and<00:01:13.869> I<00:01:13.930> made<00:01:14.110> each<00:01:14.460> opening<00:01:15.460> about<00:01:16.090> the<00:01:16.360> earth

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:16.750 
and I made each opening about the earth

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.819 
and I made each opening about the earth
box<00:01:17.110> size<00:01:17.530> and<00:01:18.630> I've<00:01:19.630> articulated<00:01:20.079> it<00:01:20.680> with<00:01:20.799> a

00:01:20.819 --> 00:01:20.829 
box size and I've articulated it with a

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:24.300 
box size and I've articulated it with a
hinge<00:01:21.189> in<00:01:21.399> the<00:01:21.430> back<00:01:21.729> oh<00:01:22.740> but<00:01:23.740> the<00:01:23.860> reason<00:01:24.159> why

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310 
hinge in the back oh but the reason why

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:25.920 
hinge in the back oh but the reason why
it's<00:01:24.460> not<00:01:24.640> out<00:01:24.850> there<00:01:24.880> right<00:01:25.329> now<00:01:25.360> is<00:01:25.719> that

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:25.930 
it's not out there right now is that

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:27.779 
it's not out there right now is that
this<00:01:26.110> plastic<00:01:26.829> here<00:01:27.039> is<00:01:27.159> just<00:01:27.399> grossly

00:01:27.779 --> 00:01:27.789 
this plastic here is just grossly

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:32.550 
this plastic here is just grossly
inadequate<00:01:28.420> for<00:01:29.399> for<00:01:30.399> a<00:01:30.430> cold<00:01:30.880> frame<00:01:31.229> so<00:01:32.229> I

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 
inadequate for for a cold frame so I

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.109 
inadequate for for a cold frame so I
have<00:01:32.799> more<00:01:33.039> on<00:01:33.219> order<00:01:33.549> and<00:01:33.579> should<00:01:33.969> be

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:34.119 
have more on order and should be

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:36.870 
have more on order and should be
delivered<00:01:34.600> in<00:01:34.810> a<00:01:34.899> few<00:01:35.079> days<00:01:35.320> I<00:01:35.670> ordered<00:01:36.670> way

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
delivered in a few days I ordered way

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.240 
delivered in a few days I ordered way
more<00:01:37.299> than<00:01:37.450> I<00:01:37.479> need<00:01:37.750> so<00:01:37.780> I<00:01:38.109> could<00:01:38.409> probably

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.250 
more than I need so I could probably

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.649 
more than I need so I could probably
build<00:01:39.700> a<00:01:39.909> 10<00:01:40.149> by<00:01:40.359> 10<00:01:40.570> greenhouse<00:01:41.109> with<00:01:41.439> it<00:01:41.590> but

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
build a 10 by 10 greenhouse with it but

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.139 
build a 10 by 10 greenhouse with it but
but<00:01:43.659> basically<00:01:44.310> it's<00:01:45.310> really<00:01:45.640> cool<00:01:45.880> to<00:01:46.030> have

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:46.149 
but basically it's really cool to have

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:49.200 
but basically it's really cool to have
extra<00:01:46.630> inventory<00:01:46.929> if<00:01:47.350> you<00:01:47.469> need<00:01:47.679> it<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:49.030> whole

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.210 
extra inventory if you need it the whole

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.830 
extra inventory if you need it the whole
lid<00:01:49.509> as<00:01:49.840> a<00:01:50.289> the<00:01:51.159> lid<00:01:51.340> has<00:01:51.549> a<00:01:51.609> big<00:01:52.000> hinge<00:01:52.390> on<00:01:52.659> it

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 
lid as a the lid has a big hinge on it

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.740 
lid as a the lid has a big hinge on it
and<00:01:53.020> I<00:01:53.590> really<00:01:54.429> scratched<00:01:54.820> my<00:01:55.119> head<00:01:55.149> trying<00:01:55.570> to

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:55.750 
and I really scratched my head trying to

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:57.929 
and I really scratched my head trying to
figure<00:01:55.929> out<00:01:56.170> some<00:01:56.439> way<00:01:56.469> to<00:01:56.649> make<00:01:56.950> a<00:01:56.979> stop<00:01:57.520> to

00:01:57.929 --> 00:01:57.939 
figure out some way to make a stop to

00:01:57.939 --> 00:01:59.999 
figure out some way to make a stop to
support<00:01:58.570> the<00:01:58.749> thing<00:01:58.990> to<00:01:59.499> keep<00:01:59.679> it<00:01:59.829> from

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:00.009 
support the thing to keep it from

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:01.980 
support the thing to keep it from
flipping<00:02:00.249> over<00:02:00.640> if<00:02:00.939> there<00:02:01.119> was<00:02:01.240> a<00:02:01.270> gust<00:02:01.630> of

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 
flipping over if there was a gust of

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.859 
flipping over if there was a gust of
wind<00:02:02.229> and<00:02:02.499> to<00:02:03.399> keep<00:02:03.579> it<00:02:03.789> from<00:02:03.969> falling<00:02:04.329> down<00:02:04.689> on

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:04.869 
wind and to keep it from falling down on

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:07.999 
wind and to keep it from falling down on
my<00:02:05.049> head<00:02:05.700> and<00:02:06.700> I've<00:02:06.999> come<00:02:07.240> up<00:02:07.390> with<00:02:07.420> something

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
my head and I've come up with something

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.149 
my head and I've come up with something
using<00:02:09.009> a<00:02:09.069> piece<00:02:09.280> of<00:02:09.310> laughs<00:02:09.819> which<00:02:10.720> is<00:02:11.159> that's

00:02:12.149 --> 00:02:12.159 
using a piece of laughs which is that's

00:02:12.159 --> 00:02:14.320 
using a piece of laughs which is that's
the<00:02:12.459> old<00:02:12.700> style

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
the old style

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.000 
the old style
would<00:02:15.330> that<00:02:15.630> they<00:02:15.750> used<00:02:16.020> to<00:02:16.170> use<00:02:16.200> a<00:02:16.410> long<00:02:16.770> time

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
would that they used to use a long time

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.020 
would that they used to use a long time
ago<00:02:17.220> for<00:02:17.460> plastering<00:02:18.000> walls<00:02:18.980> well<00:02:19.980> anyway<00:02:20.460> I

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
ago for plastering walls well anyway I

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.170 
ago for plastering walls well anyway I
just<00:02:21.180> cut<00:02:21.720> a<00:02:21.750> little<00:02:22.190> slot<00:02:23.190> in<00:02:23.550> this<00:02:23.820> thing

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
just cut a little slot in this thing

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:29.530 
just cut a little slot in this thing
like<00:02:24.450> so<00:02:25.100> stuck<00:02:26.100> up<00:02:26.130> fender<00:02:26.610> washer<00:02:26.820> here<00:02:27.950> and

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
like so stuck up fender washer here and

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.220 
like so stuck up fender washer here and
it'll<00:02:30.540> keep<00:02:30.870> it<00:02:31.080> from<00:02:31.290> opening<00:02:31.560> out<00:02:32.990> and<00:02:33.990> it'll

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
it'll keep it from opening out and it'll

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.870 
it'll keep it from opening out and it'll
keep<00:02:34.470> it<00:02:34.680> from<00:02:34.980> falling<00:02:35.460> down<00:02:35.820> on<00:02:36.060> my<00:02:36.270> head

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
keep it from falling down on my head

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:43.360 
keep it from falling down on my head
actually<00:02:38.880> mildly<00:02:39.540> proud<00:02:39.900> of<00:02:40.140> this<00:02:40.260> design

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.480 

closes<00:02:44.370> right<00:02:44.550> up<00:02:44.700> like<00:02:44.880> so<00:02:45.320> so<00:02:46.320> anyway<00:02:46.490> the

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:47.490 
closes right up like so so anyway the

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:52.970 
closes right up like so so anyway the
idea<00:02:47.850> is<00:02:48.150> to<00:02:48.810> is<00:02:49.850> to<00:02:50.900> open<00:02:51.900> it<00:02:52.170> up<00:02:52.320> like<00:02:52.530> so<00:02:52.770> if

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
idea is to is to open it up like so if

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.020 
idea is to is to open it up like so if
I'm<00:02:53.130> working<00:02:53.340> on<00:02:53.700> it

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
I'm working on it

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.110 
I'm working on it
then<00:02:54.960> take<00:02:55.920> this<00:02:56.130> little<00:02:56.400> latch<00:02:56.670> right<00:02:57.060> here

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
then take this little latch right here

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.730 
then take this little latch right here
as<00:02:57.930> you<00:02:58.830> can<00:02:59.040> see<00:02:59.310> and<00:03:00.050> open<00:03:01.050> it<00:03:01.140> up<00:03:01.230> like<00:03:01.440> so

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:01.740 
as you can see and open it up like so

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:07.700 
as you can see and open it up like so
then<00:03:02.700> the<00:03:02.880> front<00:03:03.350> flips<00:03:04.350> down<00:03:05.510> and<00:03:06.590> the<00:03:07.590> earth

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:07.710 
then the front flips down and the earth

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:09.950 
then the front flips down and the earth
boxes<00:03:08.280> will<00:03:08.490> be<00:03:08.520> about<00:03:08.790> an<00:03:08.970> inch<00:03:09.180> above<00:03:09.630> this

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:09.960 
boxes will be about an inch above this

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.260 
boxes will be about an inch above this
level<00:03:10.680> and<00:03:11.460> I'll<00:03:11.550> be<00:03:11.700> able<00:03:11.790> to<00:03:11.910> do<00:03:12.120> my

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:12.270 
level and I'll be able to do my

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:14.060 
level and I'll be able to do my
gardening<00:03:12.810> and<00:03:12.960> everything<00:03:13.380> in<00:03:13.560> here<00:03:13.590> and

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
gardening and everything in here and

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:20.330 
gardening and everything in here and
then<00:03:16.760> then<00:03:17.760> basically<00:03:18.500> chop<00:03:19.500> my<00:03:19.710> lettuce<00:03:20.100> and

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
then then basically chop my lettuce and

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.680 
then then basically chop my lettuce and
stuff<00:03:20.640> and<00:03:21.000> make<00:03:21.510> my<00:03:21.750> salads<00:03:23.000> then<00:03:24.000> flip<00:03:24.480> this

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
stuff and make my salads then flip this

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:34.610 
stuff and make my salads then flip this
thing<00:03:24.750> back<00:03:25.230> up<00:03:28.850> the<00:03:29.850> eksu<00:03:31.760> and<00:03:32.960> the<00:03:33.960> idea<00:03:34.560> of

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
thing back up the eksu and the idea of

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.410 
thing back up the eksu and the idea of
the<00:03:34.860> chicken<00:03:35.400> wire<00:03:35.610> is<00:03:35.820> to<00:03:36.000> give<00:03:36.120> it<00:03:36.210> a<00:03:36.270> little

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
the chicken wire is to give it a little

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:41.360 
the chicken wire is to give it a little
bit<00:03:36.630> of<00:03:36.720> structure<00:03:37.110> and<00:03:37.680> -<00:03:38.580> and<00:03:39.950> just<00:03:40.950> encase

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
bit of structure and - and just encase

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.570 
bit of structure and - and just encase
it<00:03:41.400> like<00:03:41.760> it's<00:03:41.970> really<00:03:42.300> super<00:03:42.870> hot<00:03:43.110> in<00:03:43.410> the

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:43.580 
it like it's really super hot in the

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:46.670 
it like it's really super hot in the
summer<00:03:44.580> time<00:03:44.900> I'll<00:03:45.900> be<00:03:46.110> able<00:03:46.200> to<00:03:46.350> take<00:03:46.530> the

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
summer time I'll be able to take the

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.790 
summer time I'll be able to take the
plastic<00:03:46.860> off<00:03:47.310> so<00:03:47.670> that<00:03:47.700> it<00:03:48.320> doesn't<00:03:49.320> cook<00:03:49.530> my

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:49.800 
plastic off so that it doesn't cook my

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:53.660 
plastic off so that it doesn't cook my
deck<00:03:50.670> garden<00:03:51.150> and<00:03:51.330> I<00:03:52.140> also<00:03:52.410> got<00:03:53.040> this<00:03:53.280> nifty

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
deck garden and I also got this nifty

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.840 
deck garden and I also got this nifty
little<00:03:53.910> thing<00:03:54.500> this<00:03:55.500> is<00:03:55.680> a<00:03:55.710> nitrogen<00:03:56.010> cylinder

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 
little thing this is a nitrogen cylinder

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:59.800 
little thing this is a nitrogen cylinder
which<00:03:57.570> is<00:03:57.600> designed<00:03:58.140> to<00:03:58.260> open<00:03:58.470> cold<00:03:59.040> frame<00:03:59.400> or

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
which is designed to open cold frame or

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:03.140 
which is designed to open cold frame or
greenhouses<00:04:00.810> and<00:04:01.230> what<00:04:02.220> I<00:04:02.250> want<00:04:02.520> it<00:04:02.640> to<00:04:02.760> do<00:04:02.940> is

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
greenhouses and what I want it to do is

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:07.190 
greenhouses and what I want it to do is
to<00:04:03.930> like<00:04:04.590> lift<00:04:04.920> lift<00:04:05.850> the<00:04:06.090> the<00:04:06.600> lid<00:04:06.810> just<00:04:06.840> a

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 
to like lift lift the the lid just a

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:11.920 
to like lift lift the the lid just a
little<00:04:07.470> bit<00:04:07.620> like<00:04:07.830> so<00:04:08.130> and<00:04:08.900> and<00:04:09.900> then<00:04:10.890> it<00:04:11.400> will

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:11.930 
little bit like so and and then it will

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:15.370 
little bit like so and and then it will
cause<00:04:12.930> the<00:04:13.290> air<00:04:13.740> to<00:04:13.800> be<00:04:14.160> drawn<00:04:14.490> up<00:04:14.700> through<00:04:15.060> the

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:15.380 
cause the air to be drawn up through the

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.900 
cause the air to be drawn up through the
through<00:04:16.380> the<00:04:16.500> boards<00:04:16.980> underneath<00:04:17.400> the<00:04:17.730> earth

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
through the boards underneath the earth

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:21.170 
through the boards underneath the earth
boxes<00:04:18.420> and<00:04:18.660> then<00:04:19.350> out<00:04:19.530> the<00:04:19.739> top<00:04:20.040> and<00:04:20.580> then<00:04:20.940> that

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
boxes and then out the top and then that

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.020 
boxes and then out the top and then that
should<00:04:21.420> keep<00:04:21.660> my<00:04:21.870> garden<00:04:22.590> from<00:04:22.910> turning<00:04:23.910> out

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
should keep my garden from turning out

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.110 
should keep my garden from turning out
you<00:04:24.510> know<00:04:24.630> half<00:04:24.840> Blanche

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.120 
you know half Blanche

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.140 
you know half Blanche
then<00:04:27.120> we<00:04:27.330> don't<00:04:27.450> need<00:04:27.630> that

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:28.150 
then we don't need that

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.439 
then we don't need that
so<00:04:28.830> that<00:04:29.830> is<00:04:30.160> a<00:04:30.190> work<00:04:30.580> in<00:04:30.760> progress<00:04:30.970> and<00:04:31.360> as

00:04:31.439 --> 00:04:31.449 
so that is a work in progress and as

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:34.040 
so that is a work in progress and as
soon<00:04:31.690> as<00:04:31.840> I<00:04:31.990> get<00:04:32.050> plastic<00:04:33.040> for<00:04:33.280> this<00:04:33.400> thing<00:04:33.669> I

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.050 
soon as I get plastic for this thing I

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:38.070 
soon as I get plastic for this thing I
will<00:04:35.460> put<00:04:36.460> it<00:04:36.580> out<00:04:36.699> into<00:04:37.060> my<00:04:37.180> deck<00:04:37.419> garden<00:04:37.840> and

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.080 
will put it out into my deck garden and

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.379 
will put it out into my deck garden and
implement<00:04:38.650> it<00:04:38.800> and<00:04:39.070> then<00:04:39.639> it<00:04:39.820> will<00:04:40.000> be<00:04:40.120> cool

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:40.389
