great sometimes you win seven or eight
in<00:00:56.340> a<00:00:56.399> row<00:00:56.430> but<00:00:56.789> then<00:00:56.969> you<00:00:57.090> have<00:00:57.210> streaks<00:00:57.539> the

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
in a row but then you have streaks the

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.619 
in a row but then you have streaks the
other<00:00:57.870> way<00:00:58.109> but<00:00:58.879> I'm<00:00:59.879> somewhere<00:01:00.300> around<00:01:00.390> the

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
other way but I'm somewhere around the

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.979 
other way but I'm somewhere around the
sixty<00:01:00.930> percent<00:01:01.079> mark<00:01:01.559> and<00:01:02.180> so<00:01:03.180> I<00:01:03.210> like<00:01:03.750> to<00:01:03.780> play
