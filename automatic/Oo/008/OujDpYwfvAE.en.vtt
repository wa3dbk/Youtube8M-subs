let's<00:00:44.340> have<00:00:44.430> a<00:00:44.460> look<00:00:44.579> at<00:00:44.640> some<00:00:44.730> of<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:44.910> ingame

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
let's have a look at some of the ingame

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.880 
let's have a look at some of the ingame
attributes<00:00:45.629> and<00:00:45.690> as<00:00:45.780> you<00:00:45.840> can<00:00:45.960> see<00:00:45.989> 85

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
attributes and as you can see 85

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.560 
attributes and as you can see 85
finishing<00:00:47.370> yes<00:00:47.670> he<00:00:47.850> can<00:00:48.030> finish<00:00:48.270> could

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
finishing yes he can finish could

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.479 
finishing yes he can finish could
probably<00:00:48.750> do<00:00:48.899> a<00:00:48.930> decent<00:00:49.140> job<00:00:49.320> at<00:00:49.829> left<00:00:50.100> forward

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
probably do a decent job at left forward

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.250 
probably do a decent job at left forward
although<00:00:50.670> his<00:00:51.149> strength<00:00:51.449> in<00:00:51.690> game<00:00:51.899> isn't<00:00:52.199> that

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
although his strength in game isn't that

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.260 
although his strength in game isn't that
great<00:00:52.559> it's<00:00:53.010> cost<00:00:53.250> enough<00:00:53.430> 78<00:00:53.820> actually

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
great it's cost enough 78 actually

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.970 
great it's cost enough 78 actually
wasn't<00:00:54.449> that<00:00:54.600> bad<00:00:54.840> yeah<00:00:55.379> set<00:00:55.710> up<00:00:55.800> a<00:00:55.860> few

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
wasn't that bad yeah set up a few

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.560 
wasn't that bad yeah set up a few
chances<00:00:56.250> which<00:00:56.489> was<00:00:56.640> good<00:00:56.789> to<00:00:56.879> see<00:00:57.030> and<00:00:57.239> his

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
chances which was good to see and his

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:58.970 
chances which was good to see and his
passing<00:00:57.930> in<00:00:58.020> general<00:00:58.350> as<00:00:58.469> you<00:00:58.530> can<00:00:58.680> see<00:00:58.800> not

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
passing in general as you can see not

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.860 
passing in general as you can see not
the<00:00:59.129> best<00:00:59.280> passing<00:00:59.460> stats<00:00:59.760> but<00:01:00.180> am<00:01:00.329> I<00:01:00.359> really

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
the best passing stats but am I really

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.810 
the best passing stats but am I really
didn't<00:01:01.199> find<00:01:01.379> any<00:01:01.590> issues<00:01:01.890> with<00:01:02.280> his<00:01:02.430> passing

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
didn't find any issues with his passing

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.729 
didn't find any issues with his passing
in<00:01:03.000> game<00:01:03.210> or<00:01:03.449> not<00:01:03.629> even<00:01:03.870> on<00:01:03.930> his<00:01:04.049> left<00:01:04.229> foot<00:01:04.379> so

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
in game or not even on his left foot so

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.050 
in game or not even on his left foot so
that<00:01:04.769> might<00:01:05.040> be<00:01:05.070> something<00:01:05.159> to<00:01:05.760> bear<00:01:05.939> in<00:01:05.970> mind

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
that might be something to bear in mind

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.250 
that might be something to bear in mind
if<00:01:06.330> think<00:01:06.540> about<00:01:06.689> picking<00:01:06.930> them<00:01:07.020> up<00:01:07.110> but

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
if think about picking them up but

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.050 
if think about picking them up but
definitely<00:01:07.650> fishy<00:01:07.890> when<00:01:07.979> this<00:01:08.130> guy<00:01:08.310> don't<00:01:08.909> go

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
definitely fishy when this guy don't go

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.700 
definitely fishy when this guy don't go
for<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.240> shot<00:01:09.450> power<00:01:09.630> girl<00:01:10.140> for<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.439> finesse

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
for the shot power girl for the finesse

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.260 
for the shot power girl for the finesse
cuz<00:01:10.920> there<00:01:11.070> as<00:01:11.310> I<00:01:11.340> say<00:01:11.549> got<00:01:11.729> really<00:01:11.970> good<00:01:12.030> care

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
cuz there as I say got really good care

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.330 
cuz there as I say got really good care
good<00:01:12.810> finishing<00:01:13.140> and<00:01:13.500> they<00:01:13.830> can<00:01:13.979> definitely

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
good finishing and they can definitely

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.520 
good finishing and they can definitely
do<00:01:14.430> some<00:01:14.580> damage<00:01:14.610> with<00:01:15.030> that<00:01:15.330> finesse<00:01:15.869> so<00:01:16.350> back

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
do some damage with that finesse so back

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.289 
do some damage with that finesse so back
to<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.740> Pierce<00:01:16.979> as<00:01:17.189> I<00:01:17.280> said<00:01:17.490> didn't<00:01:18.090> feel

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
to the Pierce as I said didn't feel

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.870 
to the Pierce as I said didn't feel
