00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:04.680
 mexico left the French national team on the verge of elimination 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.330
 for closed the men of javier aguirre already only need a point to 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:10.649
 qualify for eighths 

00:00:10.649 --> 00:00:14.389
 the domenech team will need to go thrashing south africa and 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:17.389
 hope that mexico and uruguay do not tie in the last day 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.039
 began the men of javier aguirre pulling the talent of this man of 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:22.819
 ice 

00:00:22.819 --> 00:00:24.470
 giovani dos saints 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.470
 in that play invalidated by out of play and had sent to unemployment 

00:00:28.069 --> 00:00:31.419
 in the minute 2 of match 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:33.960
 both teams had tied in their debut 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.080
 and they had had problems of attack problems to go face to goal 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.320
 risked a lot of france overtaking the lines but it rushed carlos vela 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.370
 amanda neighborhood 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.640
 in the selection of domenech a single change there is no inclusion of maloudá in 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.640
 the eleven titular titi henry is still alternate and anelka 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.000
 the '9' holder 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 more chances for mexico with too many spaces in attack 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:01.950
 the frank ticket had it sent over the crossbar 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:05.260
 dominated the game France but all the chances were against 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.250
 too many spaces for those of javier aguirre 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.860
 the left-handed one of the salcido 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.160
 the left-handed side of the men here was incorporated on the left 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:18.390
 then salcido doing damage to finery that is halfway out 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.220
 gave away when shooting saljic 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.760
 problems that yes for love is 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:27.940
 goal holder 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.710
 beatriz was still deputy 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.159
 we go to the second act enter activity by anelka at rest 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.580
 a shot of mallow 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.930
 he cleared oscar pérez el konex 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.670
 important field and the 54 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:45.670
 the entry in the field of chicharito hernández 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.770
 a great promise of Mexican football expected the fans 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.840
 If it had left the holder at the end it was not like that but it would not take long for 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.090
 ten minutes in showing his good football 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.090
 zero to one is his work in 64 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.770
 Mexico was advancing 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.140
 although we will see it in the 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.940
 repetition in an unregulated position 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.940
 out of play of chicharito 

00:02:14.339 --> 00:02:18.439
 with this goal Mexico was practically planted in the round of 16 

00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:22.809
 still he would go for the second and with this penalty also doubtful 

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:25.299
 abidal on barrier oscar barrier 

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:28.209
 Mexico would achieve its second goal 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:31.519
 we give in the repetition as the defender does not touch the ball but you have before 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:33.659
 of time the young Mexican 

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:37.069
 and it will be the white veteran cuathémoc who will achieve zero to two in the minute 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:40.489
 79 penalty from the eleven meters 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:43.689
 sentencing the Dominican group 

00:02:43.689 --> 00:02:48.229
 He returned lack of punch returned to lack of efficiency from face to goal to the set 

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:49.109
 French 

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:52.109
 mexico took advantage of their chances and won by zero to two 

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:57.700
 at the peter mokaba stadium in polokwane the second day of the group to france 

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:58.669
 on the verge of elimination
