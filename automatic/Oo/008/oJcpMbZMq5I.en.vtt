enemy<00:00:49.110> started<00:00:49.440> to<00:00:49.530> fusing<00:00:49.860> a<00:00:49.920> ball<00:00:50.070> you<00:00:50.340> would

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
enemy started to fusing a ball you would

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.189 
enemy started to fusing a ball you would
hear<00:00:50.670> them<00:00:50.789> opening<00:00:51.210> up<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.360> bomb<00:00:51.629> briefcase
