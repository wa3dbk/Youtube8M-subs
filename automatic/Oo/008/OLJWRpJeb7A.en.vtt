organic<00:02:16.470> team<00:02:17.000> so<00:02:18.000> the<00:02:18.120> experience<00:02:18.630> is

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
organic team so the experience is

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.570 
organic team so the experience is
something<00:02:19.050> that's<00:02:19.200> really<00:02:19.440> key<00:02:19.680> but<00:02:20.310> I<00:02:20.370> think

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
something that's really key but I think

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.910 
something that's really key but I think
another<00:02:20.760> thing<00:02:20.850> is<00:02:21.150> she's<00:02:21.540> really<00:02:21.930> a<00:02:22.110> calm<00:02:22.620> and

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
another thing is she's really a calm and

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.730 
another thing is she's really a calm and
assertive<00:02:22.980> leader<00:02:23.550> and<00:02:23.990> that<00:02:24.990> calmness<00:02:25.320> and

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
assertive leader and that calmness and

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.590 
assertive leader and that calmness and
that<00:02:25.830> assertiveness<00:02:26.280> is<00:02:26.700> something<00:02:27.300> that<00:02:27.450> the

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
that assertiveness is something that the

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.420 
that assertiveness is something that the
people<00:02:27.750> really<00:02:28.110> grabbed<00:02:28.440> onto<00:02:28.680> and<00:02:29.040> followed

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
people really grabbed onto and followed

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.730 
people really grabbed onto and followed
and<00:02:29.700> her<00:02:29.850> leadership<00:02:30.240> is<00:02:30.900> really<00:02:31.140> the<00:02:31.530> primary

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740 
and her leadership is really the primary

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:32.990 
and her leadership is really the primary
thing<00:02:32.130> that's<00:02:32.310> changed<00:02:32.700> how<00:02:32.940> the

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
thing that's changed how the

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.610 
thing that's changed how the
organization<00:02:33.810> runs<00:02:34.020> and<00:02:34.230> regards<00:02:34.560> the

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
distribution one big misconception is

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.820 
distribution one big misconception is
that<00:02:36.870> a<00:02:37.050> manager<00:02:37.470> is<00:02:38.010> someone<00:02:38.340> that<00:02:38.430> oversees

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
activity I think for me for me

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.229 
activity I think for me for me
management<00:02:43.560> is<00:02:43.739> being<00:02:44.040> involved<00:02:44.430> with<00:02:45.060> the

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
management is being involved with the

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:47.540 
management is being involved with the
activity<00:02:45.750> one<00:02:46.530> thing<00:02:46.830> that<00:02:46.950> I<00:02:46.980> try<00:02:47.160> to<00:02:47.190> do<00:02:47.370> is<00:02:47.489> I

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
activity one thing that I try to do is I

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:52.970 
activity one thing that I try to do is I
try<00:02:47.880> to<00:02:49.100> do<00:02:50.100> what<00:02:50.550> I<00:02:50.580> asked<00:02:50.970> folks<00:02:51.630> to<00:02:52.080> do<00:02:52.290> so<00:02:52.769> if

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980

before myself and I have a good idea as

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:00.229 
before myself and I have a good idea as
to<00:02:59.160> how<00:02:59.310> long<00:02:59.370> it<00:02:59.610> will<00:02:59.670> take<00:02:59.730> what<00:03:00.120> your

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
to how long it will take what your

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:01.550 
to how long it will take what your
challenges<00:03:00.720> will<00:03:00.959> be<00:03:00.989> when<00:03:01.320> you're<00:03:01.530> doing

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
challenges will be when you're doing

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.670 
challenges will be when you're doing
that<00:03:01.980> as<00:03:02.130> well<00:03:02.280> if<00:03:02.970> you<00:03:03.239> just<00:03:03.690> assign<00:03:04.320> a<00:03:04.380> task

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
that as well if you just assign a task

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.710 
that as well if you just assign a task
and<00:03:04.980> walk<00:03:05.130> away<00:03:05.280> then<00:03:05.670> you<00:03:06.120> don't<00:03:06.330> you<00:03:06.510> didn't

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
and walk away then you don't you didn't

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.229 
and walk away then you don't you didn't
experience<00:03:07.140> what<00:03:07.590> your<00:03:07.920> team<00:03:08.519> member<00:03:08.820> did<00:03:09.000> and

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
experience what your team member did and

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:10.670 
experience what your team member did and
you<00:03:09.959> don't<00:03:10.140> really<00:03:10.230> gain<00:03:10.440> any<00:03:10.650> knowledge

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
you don't really gain any knowledge

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.470 
you don't really gain any knowledge
you'll<00:03:11.070> do<00:03:11.190> it<00:03:11.280> the<00:03:11.340> same<00:03:11.519> over<00:03:12.000> and<00:03:12.030> over<00:03:12.360> and

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
you'll do it the same over and over and

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.060 
you'll do it the same over and over and
over<00:03:12.540> but<00:03:13.110> if<00:03:13.200> you're<00:03:13.350> involved<00:03:13.620> you'll

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
over but if you're involved you'll

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:16.039 
over but if you're involved you'll
adjust<00:03:14.459> and<00:03:14.610> you'll<00:03:14.700> be<00:03:14.820> faster<00:03:15.150> and<00:03:15.630> they'll

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:16.049 
adjust and you'll be faster and they'll

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:17.630 
adjust and you'll be faster and they'll
fit<00:03:16.380> they'll<00:03:16.560> feel<00:03:16.860> that<00:03:17.040> they're<00:03:17.190> involved

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
fit they'll feel that they're involved

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.009 
fit they'll feel that they're involved
and<00:03:17.760> they'll<00:03:17.910> become<00:03:18.090> faster<00:03:18.690> and<00:03:18.870> they're

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019 
and they'll become faster and they're

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:20.420 
and they'll become faster and they're
you<00:03:19.200> know<00:03:19.230> they're<00:03:19.350> they're<00:03:20.070> more<00:03:20.220> involved

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
you know they're they're more involved

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.520 
you know they're they're more involved
in<00:03:20.700> the<00:03:20.820> output<00:03:21.390> there<00:03:21.780> and<00:03:21.900> more<00:03:22.049> involved<00:03:22.440> in

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
in the output there and more involved in

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.850 
in the output there and more involved in
the<00:03:22.709> outcome<00:03:23.690> being<00:03:24.690> efficient<00:03:25.170> versus<00:03:25.709> being

the outcome being efficient versus being

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:27.620 
the outcome being efficient versus being
effective<00:03:26.370> I<00:03:26.549> think<00:03:26.970> they<00:03:27.060> go<00:03:27.209> hand<00:03:27.239> in<00:03:27.570> hand

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
effective I think they go hand in hand

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:28.729 
effective I think they go hand in hand
honestly<00:03:28.140> I<00:03:28.200> don't<00:03:28.260> think<00:03:28.530> they're<00:03:28.650> in

honestly I don't think they're in

when you are adjusting to a change you

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:30.700 
when you are adjusting to a change you
need<00:06:28.730> to<00:06:28.910> make<00:06:29.120> is<00:06:29.360> making<00:06:30.080> sure<00:06:30.290> that<00:06:30.500> your

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:30.710 
need to make is making sure that your

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:33.070 
need to make is making sure that your
staff<00:06:31.190> is<00:06:31.460> aware<00:06:31.760> of<00:06:31.790> the<00:06:32.030> reason<00:06:32.270> behind<00:06:32.600> it

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:33.080 
staff is aware of the reason behind it

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:35.200

so<00:06:33.650> that<00:06:33.830> way<00:06:33.980> when<00:06:34.130> they<00:06:34.250> go<00:06:34.370> to<00:06:34.400> execute<00:06:35.120> it

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:35.210 
so that way when they go to execute it

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:36.970 
so that way when they go to execute it
they<00:06:35.330> understand<00:06:35.810> the<00:06:35.930> importance<00:06:36.380> behind<00:06:36.620> it

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:36.980 
they understand the importance behind it

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:40.660 
they understand the importance behind it
I<00:06:37.190> really<00:06:38.090> try<00:06:38.330> to<00:06:38.360> empower<00:06:39.290> them<00:06:39.620> to<00:06:40.010> execute

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:40.670 
I really try to empower them to execute

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:42.130 
I really try to empower them to execute
so<00:06:41.150> I<00:06:41.180> need<00:06:41.450> to<00:06:41.540> make<00:06:41.690> sure<00:06:41.750> that<00:06:41.990> they're

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:42.140

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:44.500 
so I need to make sure that they're
trained<00:06:42.470> and<00:06:42.680> that<00:06:42.710> they<00:06:42.890> understand<00:06:43.340> why<00:06:44.120> we

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:44.510 
trained and that they understand why we

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:46.270
