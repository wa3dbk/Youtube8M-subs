00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:08.240
 hey guys what is a fitness here 

00:00:04.089 --> 00:00:10.370
 would be the last video I saw 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:15.589
 girlfriend is still sleeping for a long time 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:18.920
 press was announced for rape five sentences 

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:21.880
 with 90 kilos for those who do not know 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:24.380
 I am regenerating or just curating one 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.929
 shoulder injury could be the last 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.910
 year to one and a half do not press bank 

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:30.640
 due to this shoulder injury now 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.230
 For two weeks I can get back banks 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.450
 and of course , it's all about power 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.030
 to mobilize 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:40.340
 that's why people do not let you 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:43.970
 demotivate that I'm getting more upset 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:45.470
 as you for example so clearly I have 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:48.470
 Two weeks ago, there were also benefits 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:51.310
 still with 70 kilograms were desired 75 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:54.260
 the last 80 and now 90 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:56.060
 For one, that was the 70 kilo one 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:59.630
 completely different technology fresh much less 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:00.860
 the other hand is now the power 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:03.110
 Shoulder injury away that's me 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:06.920
 can be tight again so normal people 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:09.710
 and now if I continue now 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:13.100
 climb because also to 100 105 and 110 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.380
 that's all mass memory that's me 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.340
 there was already the muscles there 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.600
 had to cope with that and 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.190
 could handle that ever 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.590
 that's why the slope is now 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:23.120
 in the short term relatively fast 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.610
 means I will be next week 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.140
 probably not more 90 50 4 x 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.160
 to press 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.430
 anyway, not a week from now 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:33.110
 planherern in three weeks I can 95 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:34.370
 so I can push the three 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.200
 weeks later not to press 100 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:37.310
 then I can press 105 that will 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.900
 now go relatively fast 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.550
 Do not be discouraged that was just 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:44.020
 I have a short update after that 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:46.970
 made on wordpress 6 7 sat and 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:51.340
 to matrices shoulder my friends and 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:54.740
 now I'll take care of her tomorrow 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:56.479
 that has a short update to the next 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.890
 video is good 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:59.890
 keep fit
