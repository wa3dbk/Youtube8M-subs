00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:36.490 

again

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:45.870 

p7

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:08.650 

there<00:01:56.119> you<00:01:56.240> go

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.979 

easily

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:17.869 

and<00:02:13.989> it<00:02:14.560> repeats<00:02:14.890> on<00:02:15.040> so<00:02:15.609> there<00:02:16.450> you<00:02:16.569> have<00:02:16.629> it<00:02:16.780> a

00:02:17.869 --> 00:02:17.879 
and it repeats on so there you have it a

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:20.759 
and it repeats on so there you have it a
few<00:02:18.879> different<00:02:19.269> seventh<00:02:20.019> chords<00:02:20.409> in<00:02:20.530> a<00:02:20.590> few

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:20.769 
few different seventh chords in a few

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:22.440 
few different seventh chords in a few
different<00:02:21.069> places<00:02:21.239> hopefully<00:02:22.239> you're<00:02:22.420> able

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
different places hopefully you're able

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.649 
different places hopefully you're able
to<00:02:22.719> play<00:02:23.590> along<00:02:23.859> and<00:02:24.219> and<00:02:24.579> keep<00:02:25.120> up<00:02:25.329> with<00:02:25.510> that

to play along and and keep up with that

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:27.089 
to play along and and keep up with that
one<00:02:25.840> and<00:02:25.959> hopefully<00:02:26.260> that<00:02:26.409> makes<00:02:26.620> sense<00:02:26.799> to

00:02:27.089 --> 00:02:27.099 
one and hopefully that makes sense to

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:30.030 
one and hopefully that makes sense to
you<00:02:27.220> as<00:02:27.400> to<00:02:28.060> why<00:02:28.750> those<00:02:28.989> 7th<00:02:29.439> chords<00:02:29.890> are

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
you as to why those 7th chords are

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.500 
you as to why those 7th chords are
working<00:02:30.430> there<00:02:30.640> remember<00:02:31.150> they're<00:02:31.269> bridge

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
working there remember they're bridge

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.199 
working there remember they're bridge
chords<00:02:31.989> that<00:02:32.650> sound<00:02:33.010> cool<00:02:33.310> that<00:02:33.909> gets<00:02:34.090> you

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:34.209 
chords that sound cool that gets you

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:37.079 
chords that sound cool that gets you
from<00:02:34.390> one<00:02:34.569> chord<00:02:34.870> to<00:02:34.900> the<00:02:35.019> next
