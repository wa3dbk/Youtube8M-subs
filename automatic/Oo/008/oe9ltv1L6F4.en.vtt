00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
position the best move for black would

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.980 
position the best move for black would
be<00:02:00.390> Knight<00:02:01.110> to<00:02:01.320> f6

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990

instead he was tempted to capture the
bishop<00:02:07.619> and<00:02:07.770> could<00:02:08.009> not<00:02:08.130> resist<00:02:08.369> temptation

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
bishop and could not resist temptation

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.690 
bishop and could not resist temptation
because<00:02:09.539> bishop<00:02:09.869> was<00:02:10.080> for<00:02:10.259> free<00:02:10.410> and<00:02:10.700> now

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
because bishop was for free and now

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.320

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.100 
is not protected so Queen takes the rook

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.940 
is not protected so Queen takes the rook
okay<00:02:23.100> so<00:02:23.840> black<00:02:24.840> has<00:02:25.020> more<00:02:25.290> pieces<00:02:25.560> on<00:02:25.860> the
