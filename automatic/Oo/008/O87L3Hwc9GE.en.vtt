this<00:00:13.740> it<00:00:14.040> took<00:00:14.190> a<00:00:14.280> really<00:00:14.429> long<00:00:14.519> time<00:00:14.670> to<00:00:14.880> make

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
this it took a really long time to make

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.820 
this it took a really long time to make
and<00:00:15.360> it<00:00:15.630> was<00:00:15.780> actually<00:00:16.170> full<00:00:16.350> of<00:00:16.440> a<00:00:16.500> bunch<00:00:16.529> of

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
and it was actually full of a bunch of

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.670 
and it was actually full of a bunch of
errors<00:00:17.039> um<00:00:17.600> so<00:00:18.600> the<00:00:18.750> result<00:00:19.020> wasn't<00:00:19.199> that<00:00:19.439> good

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
errors um so the result wasn't that good

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
great I recommended if you like sci-fi

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.130 
great I recommended if you like sci-fi
shows<00:00:52.579> then<00:00:53.579> I<00:00:53.670> got<00:00:53.820> my<00:00:53.910> craft<00:00:54.180> knife<00:00:54.329> to<00:00:54.870> cut

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
shows then I got my craft knife to cut

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.799 
shows then I got my craft knife to cut
out<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.320> base<00:00:55.649> shape<00:00:56.129> I<00:00:57.090> could<00:00:57.449> have<00:00:57.539> stopped

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
out the base shape I could have stopped

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.270 
out the base shape I could have stopped
there<00:00:58.140> but<00:00:58.170> I<00:00:58.469> wanted<00:00:58.710> to<00:00:58.800> make<00:00:58.920> it<00:00:59.070> a<00:00:59.129> little

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
there but I wanted to make it a little

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.040 
there but I wanted to make it a little
bit<00:00:59.430> more<00:00:59.550> three-dimensional<00:01:00.359> so<00:01:00.750> I<00:01:00.809> cut<00:01:01.020> out

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
bit more three-dimensional so I cut out

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.080 
bit more three-dimensional so I cut out
a<00:01:01.140> bunch<00:01:01.260> of<00:01:01.590> pieces<00:01:02.100> and<00:01:02.520> I<00:01:02.550> glued<00:01:02.789> it<00:01:02.879> over

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
a bunch of pieces and I glued it over

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.729 
a bunch of pieces and I glued it over
the<00:01:03.180> base<00:01:03.420> and<00:01:03.719> kind<00:01:03.930> of<00:01:04.019> gave<00:01:04.170> it<00:01:04.199> like<00:01:04.500> the

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
the base and kind of gave it like the

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.640 
the base and kind of gave it like the
frame<00:01:05.129> um<00:01:05.540> this<00:01:06.540> took<00:01:06.720> a<00:01:06.840> long<00:01:06.960> time<00:01:07.020> since<00:01:07.500> I

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
frame um this took a long time since I

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.020 
frame um this took a long time since I
didn't<00:01:07.920> measure<00:01:08.130> out<00:01:08.400> anything<00:01:08.850> and<00:01:08.970> i

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
didn't measure out anything and i

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.660 
didn't measure out anything and i
eyeballed<00:01:09.689> everything<00:01:09.900> so<00:01:10.860> kind<00:01:11.220> of<00:01:11.340> like<00:01:11.460> had

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
eyeballed everything so kind of like had

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.880 
eyeballed everything so kind of like had
to<00:01:11.850> keep<00:01:12.030> on<00:01:12.210> adjusting<00:01:12.510> it<00:01:13.049> I<00:01:13.229> used<00:01:13.590> a<00:01:13.710> ruler

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
to keep on adjusting it I used a ruler

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:14.899 
to keep on adjusting it I used a ruler
to<00:01:14.010> make<00:01:14.189> sure<00:01:14.340> everything<00:01:14.610> was<00:01:14.700> nice<00:01:14.850> and

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
to make sure everything was nice and

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:37.600 
to make sure everything was nice and
straight

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:43.109 

you

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:43.119 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:45.249 

before<00:01:44.119> I<00:01:44.149> glued<00:01:44.390> it<00:01:44.509> to<00:01:44.600> the<00:01:44.689> base<00:01:44.869> I<00:01:45.049> try<00:01:45.229> to

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:45.259 
before I glued it to the base I try to

00:01:45.259 --> 00:02:15.309 
before I glued it to the base I try to
make<00:01:45.409> sure<00:01:45.560> everything<00:01:45.890> would<00:01:46.009> fit<00:01:46.280> nicely

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:15.319 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:25.100 

you

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.980 

um<00:02:26.070> and<00:02:26.310> then<00:02:26.520> I<00:02:26.730> got<00:02:26.880> a<00:02:26.940> piece<00:02:27.270> of<00:02:27.300> foam<00:02:27.720> board

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990

had<00:02:50.130> it<00:02:50.160> lying<00:02:50.430> around<00:02:50.610> so<00:02:51.300> I<00:02:51.330> don't<00:02:51.600> really

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
had it lying around so I don't really

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.930 
had it lying around so I don't really
know<00:02:51.990> what<00:02:52.230> color<00:02:52.470> it<00:02:52.680> was<00:02:52.709> up<00:02:53.220> but<00:02:53.730> it's

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
know what color it was up but it's

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.850 
know what color it was up but it's
pretty<00:02:54.240> easy<00:02:54.420> to<00:02:54.630> get<00:02:54.900> a<00:02:54.930> nice<00:02:55.110> color<00:02:55.530> it's

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
pretty easy to get a nice color it's

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.430 
pretty easy to get a nice color it's
like<00:02:55.950> a<00:02:55.980> dark<00:02:56.400> navy<00:02:56.730> blue<00:02:57.330> for<00:02:57.690> the<00:02:57.720> TARDIS<00:02:58.200> and

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
like a dark navy blue for the TARDIS and

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.650 
like a dark navy blue for the TARDIS and
I<00:02:59.070> used<00:02:59.340> my<00:02:59.640> finger<00:02:59.700> for<00:03:00.270> most<00:03:00.450> of<00:03:00.570> the

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
I used my finger for most of the

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.170 
I used my finger for most of the
painting<00:03:01.170> just<00:03:01.920> because<00:03:02.160> my<00:03:02.340> finger<00:03:02.940> had<00:03:03.150> a

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
painting just because my finger had a

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.060 
painting just because my finger had a
better<00:03:03.600> stroke<00:03:04.110> than<00:03:04.320> the<00:03:04.410> paintbrush<00:03:04.830> I<00:03:04.950> was

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
better stroke than the paintbrush I was

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:06.650 
better stroke than the paintbrush I was
using<00:03:05.220> a<00:03:05.310> really<00:03:05.430> cheap<00:03:05.730> paint<00:03:06.000> brush<00:03:06.270> just<00:03:06.510> to

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
using a really cheap paint brush just to

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.510 
using a really cheap paint brush just to
get<00:03:06.870> into<00:03:07.110> the<00:03:07.530> nooks<00:03:07.680> and<00:03:07.860> crannies<00:03:08.280> that<00:03:08.310> my

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:08.520 
get into the nooks and crannies that my

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:09.949 
get into the nooks and crannies that my
finger<00:03:08.820> couldn't<00:03:09.120> fit<00:03:09.300> and<00:03:09.450> i<00:03:09.480> smoothed<00:03:09.870> it

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
finger couldn't fit and i smoothed it

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:11.780 
finger couldn't fit and i smoothed it
out<00:03:10.050> with<00:03:10.230> my<00:03:10.320> finger<00:03:10.650> and<00:03:10.800> then<00:03:11.370> I<00:03:11.430> put<00:03:11.700> the

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
out with my finger and then I put the

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:13.220 
out with my finger and then I put the
white<00:03:11.940> paint<00:03:12.209> in<00:03:12.330> the<00:03:12.390> windows<00:03:12.720> I<00:03:12.959> mean<00:03:13.140> this

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
is a really painful part to make I would

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:17.449 
is a really painful part to make I would
have<00:03:16.050> put<00:03:16.200> masking<00:03:16.650> tape<00:03:16.860> but<00:03:17.070> I<00:03:17.130> was<00:03:17.250> afraid

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
have put masking tape but I was afraid

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:19.729 
have put masking tape but I was afraid
of<00:03:17.580> lifting<00:03:18.180> off<00:03:18.330> the<00:03:18.360> tape<00:03:18.810> on<00:03:18.989> any<00:03:19.440> of<00:03:19.590> the

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
of lifting off the tape on any of the

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:22.640 
of lifting off the tape on any of the
blue<00:03:19.950> parts<00:03:20.310> so<00:03:20.670> yeah<00:03:21.600> I<00:03:21.630> had<00:03:22.140> to<00:03:22.170> keep<00:03:22.440> on

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650
