00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 be all very welcome once more 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.000
 to the figs tips 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.040
 I'm neko this is the second episode today 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.090
 we're going to be talking about watering with your 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:14.070
 tp invisible combi his eye q flash and 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.150
 with stern and doing is invulnerable and 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.580
 be able to have transportation 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.380
 quietly with patching is so 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.750
 simple as I did the name what 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.640
 you have to do is activate the r and once 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.670
 done that the next thing we should do 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.800
 is to create the pp to a tower then 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.179
 we will be invisible if we have the boots 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.619
 howard we will have a version 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.350
 very fast for the enemy 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.610
 we have invisible yes but enemy we 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.820
 will detect by the exclamation point 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.610
 that appears above them too 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.860
 they can be used in any way 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.079
 you can directly jump the enemy nor 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.940
 well I finished channeling the phone in 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.770
 towers the yield of ter x will be seen 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.780
 reduced 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.760
 and they saw how it is a little bit more 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.860
 complicated is not difficult at all but a 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.610
 little bit of practice there are two ways to 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.410
 to do one is blasco and the other is a 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:03.120
 plus out there the comply if it's a 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.830
 little bit more complex but much more 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.910
 surprise for the enemy will not have 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.910
 no reaction time 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.700
 now we will pass with our dear 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:14.590
 Pop friend and that is a little bit square 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:17.080
 but very very very open what you have to 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:19.780
 do with this champions is if they come to you 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.520
 to hook between two or three to try 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.650
 throw him the last one even if they do not have 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.390
 no kind of sc what this will do is 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:28.229
 which is calmly you can go without 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.229
 that nobody stores 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.590
 and good people at the end you will have seen 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.750
 a clip that we are finishing recording 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.880
 that a friend was helping me and good 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.290
 that happened so well I hope that you 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.149
 I really liked the video that 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:55.220
 share with your friends give him a like 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:56.869
 and comment that other things we can 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:00.039
 improve a very big hug the 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:00.039
 Atlantic and until next time
