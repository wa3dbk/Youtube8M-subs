keep falling off or I'll leave them in a
fitting<00:01:43.890> room<00:01:43.920> with<00:01:44.579> you<00:01:44.700> guys<00:01:44.850> know<00:01:45.030> I've

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
fitting room with you guys know I've

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.600 
fitting room with you guys know I've
done<00:01:45.390> before<00:01:45.810> so<00:01:46.500> I<00:01:46.890> think<00:01:46.979> this<00:01:47.280> is<00:01:47.430> so

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
done before so I think this is so

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.460 
done before so I think this is so
perfect<00:01:47.640> because<00:01:48.299> you<00:01:48.600> can<00:01:48.750> just<00:01:48.780> loop<00:01:49.110> it<00:01:49.290> on

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
perfect because you can just loop it on

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.399 
perfect because you can just loop it on
and<00:01:49.829> you're<00:01:50.520> good<00:01:50.670> to<00:01:50.700> go<00:01:50.880> so<00:01:51.360> I'm<00:01:51.720> really

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.710 
and you're good to go so I'm really
excited<00:01:52.560> about<00:01:53.009> this<00:01:53.310> this<00:01:53.700> is<00:01:53.880> my<00:01:54.060> first<00:01:54.360> lean

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720
