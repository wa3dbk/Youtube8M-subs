conversation<00:02:41.889> piece<00:02:42.310> you<00:02:42.730> know<00:02:42.819> I<00:02:42.849> guess<00:02:43.060> the

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
conversation piece you know I guess the

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:44.580 
conversation piece you know I guess the
c-3po<00:02:43.689> would<00:02:43.930> probably<00:02:44.230> be<00:02:44.290> the<00:02:44.379> one<00:02:44.439> that

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
c-3po would probably be the one that

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:45.899 
c-3po would probably be the one that
stands<00:02:44.799> out<00:02:44.980> the<00:02:45.069> most<00:02:45.219> of<00:02:45.489> the<00:02:45.639> ones<00:02:45.790> I've

00:02:45.899 --> 00:02:45.909 
stands out the most of the ones I've

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:48.720 
stands out the most of the ones I've
seen<00:02:45.939> because<00:02:46.359> it's<00:02:46.569> completely<00:02:46.840> gold<00:02:47.730> and

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
seen because it's completely gold and

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.240 
seen because it's completely gold and
it's<00:02:48.939> shiny<00:02:49.349> so<00:02:50.349> it<00:02:50.469> may<00:02:50.590> be<00:02:50.620> more<00:02:50.919> apt<00:02:51.129> for

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
it's shiny so it may be more apt for

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.309 
it's shiny so it may be more apt for
fingerprints<00:02:51.819> but<00:02:51.900> definitely<00:02:52.900> it's<00:02:53.049> gold

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:53.319
