I'd<00:00:00.690> like<00:00:00.870> to<00:00:01.020> talk<00:00:01.170> about<00:00:01.350> the<00:00:01.620> use<00:00:01.860> of

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:02.100 
I'd like to talk about the use of

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.930 
I'd like to talk about the use of
metaphor<00:00:03.000> in<00:00:03.210> teaching<00:00:03.570> piano<00:00:03.780> technique

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:04.940 
metaphor in teaching piano technique

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:07.579 
metaphor in teaching piano technique
there<00:00:05.940> was<00:00:06.060> a<00:00:06.089> great<00:00:06.299> teacher<00:00:06.509> at<00:00:06.750> the<00:00:06.930> Moscow

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589

or that and he's sort of kidding around
being<00:00:25.920> superficial<00:00:26.430> what<00:00:26.789> he<00:00:26.880> meant<00:00:27.180> was<00:00:27.529> as

really<00:00:33.510> didn't<00:00:33.719> care<00:00:33.750> about<00:00:33.960> analyzing<00:00:34.829> it

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
really didn't care about analyzing it

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.040 
really didn't care about analyzing it
and<00:00:35.160> certainly<00:00:35.969> we<00:00:36.300> can<00:00:36.450> understand<00:00:36.899> his

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
and certainly we can understand his

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.290 
and certainly we can understand his
point<00:00:37.260> of<00:00:37.380> view<00:00:37.550> and<00:00:38.550> and<00:00:39.530> if<00:00:40.530> you<00:00:41.120> look<00:00:42.120> at

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
point of view and and if you look at

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.090 
point of view and and if you look at
some<00:00:42.570> of<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:42.750> teachers<00:00:42.960> who<00:00:43.350> have<00:00:43.379> analyzed

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
some of the teachers who have analyzed

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.160 
some of the teachers who have analyzed
technique<00:00:44.700> very<00:00:45.210> very<00:00:45.539> thoroughly<00:00:46.050> for

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
technique very very thoroughly for

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.770 
technique very very thoroughly for
example<00:00:46.559> Tobias<00:00:47.039> matei<00:00:47.520> if<00:00:47.940> you've<00:00:48.390> read<00:00:48.600> any

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
example Tobias matei if you've read any

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.410 
example Tobias matei if you've read any
of<00:00:48.870> his<00:00:49.110> many<00:00:49.440> many<00:00:49.680> books<00:00:50.010> you<00:00:50.760> will<00:00:50.940> find<00:00:51.270> a

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
of his many many books you will find a

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.600 
of his many many books you will find a
kind<00:00:51.660> of<00:00:51.920> analysis<00:00:52.920> that<00:00:52.949> leads<00:00:53.280> to<00:00:53.430> paralysis

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
kind of analysis that leads to paralysis

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.450 
kind of analysis that leads to paralysis
there<00:00:54.239> are<00:00:54.300> just<00:00:54.449> too<00:00:54.690> many<00:00:54.719> things<00:00:55.020> that<00:00:55.770> you

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
there are just too many things that you

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.069 
there are just too many things that you
are<00:00:56.610> apparently<00:00:56.940> supposed<00:00:57.480> to<00:00:57.570> be<00:00:57.690> thinking

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
are apparently supposed to be thinking

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.279 
are apparently supposed to be thinking
about<00:00:58.230> when<00:00:59.039> you<00:00:59.129> play<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.460> piano<00:00:59.760> and<00:01:00.329> while

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
about when you play the piano and while

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.740 
about when you play the piano and while
I<00:01:01.320> actually<00:01:01.800> think<00:01:02.460> Matteo<00:01:03.090> was<00:01:03.149> on<00:01:03.420> to<00:01:03.570> some

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
I actually think Matteo was on to some

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.010 
I actually think Matteo was on to some
great<00:01:03.960> stuff<00:01:04.460> I<00:01:05.460> don't<00:01:06.240> like<00:01:06.450> reading<00:01:06.689> him<00:01:06.930> at

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
great stuff I don't like reading him at

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.330 
great stuff I don't like reading him at
all<00:01:07.200> because<00:01:07.500> I<00:01:07.710> don't<00:01:07.740> want<00:01:08.010> to<00:01:08.070> think<00:01:08.220> about

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
all because I don't want to think about

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.859 
all because I don't want to think about
that<00:01:08.640> much<00:01:08.850> stuff<00:01:09.090> when<00:01:09.330> I'm<00:01:09.420> just<00:01:09.570> trying<00:01:09.659> to

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
that much stuff when I'm just trying to

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.550 
that much stuff when I'm just trying to
play<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.140> piano<00:01:10.880> so<00:01:11.880> when<00:01:12.450> I<00:01:12.720> teach<00:01:13.200> what<00:01:13.409> I<00:01:13.439> do

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
play the piano so when I teach what I do

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.620 
play the piano so when I teach what I do
about<00:01:14.100> rotation<00:01:14.880> and<00:01:15.030> so<00:01:15.119> on<00:01:15.270> I'm<00:01:15.390> actually

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
about rotation and so on I'm actually

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.200 
about rotation and so on I'm actually
simplifying<00:01:16.500> things<00:01:16.920> quite<00:01:17.700> a<00:01:17.729> bit<00:01:17.850> the

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
simplifying things quite a bit the

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.140 
simplifying things quite a bit the
reason<00:01:18.420> is<00:01:19.080> I<00:01:19.770> emphasize<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.850> holistic

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
reason is I emphasize the holistic

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.810 
reason is I emphasize the holistic
motion<00:01:21.750> and<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.020> rotation<00:01:22.590> not<00:01:23.250> because<00:01:23.670> it's

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
motion and the rotation not because it's

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.480 
motion and the rotation not because it's
the<00:01:23.909> only<00:01:24.330> element<00:01:24.810> of<00:01:24.960> piano<00:01:25.350> playing<00:01:25.680> but

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
the only element of piano playing but

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.070 
the only element of piano playing but
because<00:01:26.880> it's<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.210> main<00:01:27.420> thing<00:01:27.750> that<00:01:27.780> is

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
because it's the main thing that is

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.679 
because it's the main thing that is
missing<00:01:28.439> from<00:01:28.950> most<00:01:29.790> of<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.119> students<00:01:30.570> I

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
missing from most of the students I

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.980 
missing from most of the students I
encounter<00:01:31.259> most<00:01:31.650> of<00:01:31.920> them<00:01:32.100> play<00:01:32.909> with<00:01:33.689> with

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
encounter most of them play with with

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.810 
encounter most of them play with with
very<00:01:34.159> isolated<00:01:35.159> technique<00:01:35.579> without

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
very isolated technique without

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.530 
very isolated technique without
centering<00:01:36.570> and<00:01:37.640> so<00:01:38.640> what<00:01:38.850> I<00:01:38.880> teach<00:01:39.150> is<00:01:39.329> not<00:01:39.509> a

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
centering and so what I teach is not a

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.450 
centering and so what I teach is not a
complete<00:01:40.140> description<00:01:40.350> of<00:01:41.100> what<00:01:41.340> is

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
complete description of what is

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.660 
complete description of what is
happening<00:01:41.700> physiologically<00:01:42.530> it's<00:01:43.530> an<00:01:43.890> answer

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
happening physiologically it's an answer

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.260 
happening physiologically it's an answer
to<00:01:45.000> what<00:01:45.210> most<00:01:45.540> of<00:01:45.960> my<00:01:46.140> students<00:01:46.649> are<00:01:46.770> actually

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
to what most of my students are actually

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.080 
to what most of my students are actually
missing<00:01:48.270> and<00:01:49.579> really<00:01:50.579> if<00:01:50.670> you<00:01:50.759> think<00:01:50.970> about

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
missing and really if you think about

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.580 
missing and really if you think about
all<00:01:51.299> the<00:01:51.420> neurological<00:01:52.320> and<00:01:52.560> muscular

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
all the neurological and muscular

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.770 
all the neurological and muscular
activity<00:01:53.159> that's<00:01:53.820> going<00:01:54.149> on<00:01:54.270> when<00:01:54.479> you<00:01:54.570> play

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
activity that's going on when you play

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.280 
activity that's going on when you play
you<00:01:55.590> do<00:01:55.740> not<00:01:55.890> want<00:01:56.159> to<00:01:56.219> know<00:01:56.340> all<00:01:56.520> that<00:01:56.640> stuff

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.290 
you do not want to know all that stuff

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.139 
you do not want to know all that stuff
you<00:01:58.290> really<00:01:58.469> don't

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:15.359 
really really great research and now I

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:18.170 
really really great research and now I
want<00:03:16.199> to<00:03:16.260> show<00:03:16.440> you<00:03:16.500> a<00:03:16.620> video<00:03:16.799> I<00:03:16.949> made<00:03:17.489> this<00:03:18.000> is

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
want to show you a video I made this is

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:23.000 
want to show you a video I made this is
some<00:03:18.389> slow-motion<00:03:19.199> of<00:03:19.409> playing<00:03:19.799> and<00:03:22.010> even

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
some slow-motion of playing and even

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.059 
some slow-motion of playing and even
though<00:03:23.129> I<00:03:23.159> talk<00:03:23.489> all<00:03:23.729> the<00:03:23.909> time<00:03:24.090> about<00:03:25.069> using

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:26.069 
though I talk all the time about using

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:28.280 
though I talk all the time about using
gestures<00:03:26.579> and<00:03:26.849> rotation<00:03:27.449> and<00:03:27.750> centering<00:03:28.199> and

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
gestures and rotation and centering and

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.559 
gestures and rotation and centering and
so<00:03:28.409> on<00:03:28.500> to<00:03:28.620> play<00:03:28.769> the<00:03:28.889> notes<00:03:29.069> this<00:03:29.790> video<00:03:30.359> which

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:30.569 
so on to play the notes this video which

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:34.069 
so on to play the notes this video which
is<00:03:30.599> very<00:03:31.169> slow<00:03:31.560> motion<00:03:32.069> will<00:03:32.639> show<00:03:33.030> you<00:03:33.090> the

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:34.079 
is very slow motion will show you the

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:36.979 
is very slow motion will show you the
relationship<00:03:34.260> of<00:03:35.159> actual<00:03:35.909> finger<00:03:36.329> motion<00:03:36.720> to

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
relationship of actual finger motion to

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:40.009 
relationship of actual finger motion to
larger<00:03:37.590> motion<00:03:38.400> it's<00:03:38.579> a<00:03:38.780> selection<00:03:39.780> of<00:03:39.930> a

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019 
larger motion it's a selection of a

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:43.280 
larger motion it's a selection of a
scarlotti<00:03:40.470> Sonata<00:03:41.000> taken<00:03:42.000> at<00:03:42.120> 240<00:03:42.870> frames<00:03:43.049> per

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
second and what I think is instructive

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:50.629 
second and what I think is instructive
here<00:03:46.620> is<00:03:46.769> that<00:03:47.040> yes<00:03:48.019> there<00:03:49.019> is<00:03:49.639> individual

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:50.639 
here is that yes there is individual

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:52.789 
here is that yes there is individual

the<00:04:14.699> individual<00:04:15.389> finger<00:04:15.810> motions<00:04:16.199> giving

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859 
the individual finger motions giving

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:19.550 
the individual finger motions giving
them<00:04:17.039> power<00:04:17.370> I<00:04:17.759> was<00:04:18.630> thinking<00:04:18.959> about<00:04:19.079> how<00:04:19.409> this

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
them power I was thinking about how this

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.969 
them power I was thinking about how this
is<00:04:19.739> like<00:04:19.950> a<00:04:20.190> wave<00:04:20.609> on<00:04:20.969> the<00:04:21.659> beach<00:04:21.810> when<00:04:22.680> you<00:04:22.800> go

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:22.979 
is like a wave on the beach when you go

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:24.830 
is like a wave on the beach when you go
and<00:04:23.130> play<00:04:23.340> in<00:04:23.520> the<00:04:23.610> ocean

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
and play in the ocean

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.330 
and play in the ocean
those<00:04:24.990> waves<00:04:25.290> come<00:04:25.620> up<00:04:25.650> and<00:04:25.980> they're<00:04:26.100> very

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
those waves come up and they're very

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:28.629 
those waves come up and they're very
powerful<00:04:26.639> where<00:04:27.570> does<00:04:27.690> that<00:04:27.720> power<00:04:28.110> come<00:04:28.470> from

00:04:28.629 --> 00:04:28.639 
powerful where does that power come from

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:32.300 
powerful where does that power come from
well<00:04:29.639> obviously<00:04:29.850> this<00:04:30.720> one<00:04:31.080> wave<00:04:31.410> at<00:04:31.919> the<00:04:32.070> very

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
well obviously this one wave at the very

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:34.250 
well obviously this one wave at the very
edge<00:04:32.520> of<00:04:32.760> the<00:04:32.910> ocean<00:04:33.090> that<00:04:33.690> knocks<00:04:33.990> you<00:04:34.139> over

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:34.260 
edge of the ocean that knocks you over

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:38.090 
edge of the ocean that knocks you over
has<00:04:35.250> a<00:04:35.280> lot<00:04:35.669> of<00:04:35.699> power<00:04:36.380> but<00:04:37.380> it's<00:04:37.560> not<00:04:37.620> as

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:38.100 
has a lot of power but it's not as

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:41.360 
has a lot of power but it's not as
though<00:04:38.310> the<00:04:38.490> water<00:04:38.790> within<00:04:39.860> you<00:04:40.860> know<00:04:40.979> just<00:04:41.250> a

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 
though the water within you know just a

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:44.000 
though the water within you know just a
short<00:04:41.639> distance<00:04:41.790> of<00:04:42.180> shore<00:04:42.449> somehow<00:04:43.229> got<00:04:43.979> a

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.010 
short distance of shore somehow got a

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:46.370 
short distance of shore somehow got a
bunch<00:04:44.250> of<00:04:44.400> energy<00:04:44.580> from<00:04:45.150> somewhere<00:04:45.419> and<00:04:45.840> rose

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:46.380 
bunch of energy from somewhere and rose

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:49.460 
bunch of energy from somewhere and rose
into<00:04:46.680> a<00:04:46.860> wave<00:04:47.160> and<00:04:47.460> then<00:04:47.639> smacked<00:04:48.120> you<00:04:48.470> why

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:49.470 
into a wave and then smacked you why

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:52.250 
into a wave and then smacked you why
would<00:04:50.190> a<00:04:50.220> small<00:04:50.639> area<00:04:51.000> of<00:04:51.060> water<00:04:51.419> just<00:04:51.810> have

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:52.260 
would a small area of water just have

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.790 
would a small area of water just have
energy<00:04:52.800> in<00:04:52.979> it<00:04:53.130> that<00:04:53.910> energy<00:04:54.510> came<00:04:54.840> from<00:04:54.870> far

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 
energy in it that energy came from far

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.520 
energy in it that energy came from far
out<00:04:56.010> to<00:04:56.040> sea<00:04:56.310> miles<00:04:57.000> and<00:04:57.330> miles<00:04:57.510> away<00:04:57.750> from

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:58.530 
out to sea miles and miles away from

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:02.390 
out to sea miles and miles away from
wind<00:04:58.800> and<00:04:59.960> wind<00:05:00.960> over<00:05:01.260> many<00:05:01.470> many<00:05:01.710> miles<00:05:01.979> that

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 
wind and wind over many many miles that

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.570 
wind and wind over many many miles that
gradually<00:05:03.680> transfers<00:05:04.680> that<00:05:04.800> energy<00:05:05.220> into<00:05:05.490> the

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:05.580 
gradually transfers that energy into the

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:08.300 
gradually transfers that energy into the
water<00:05:05.820> in<00:05:06.120> wave<00:05:06.389> form<00:05:06.780> so<00:05:07.440> the<00:05:07.590> wave<00:05:07.830> that<00:05:08.070> hits

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:08.310 
water in wave form so the wave that hits

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:12.770 
water in wave form so the wave that hits
you<00:05:08.610> on<00:05:08.820> the<00:05:09.479> shore<00:05:10.070> is<00:05:11.070> water<00:05:12.060> that's<00:05:12.510> right

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:12.780 
you on the shore is water that's right

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:15.440 
you on the shore is water that's right
there<00:05:12.990> by<00:05:13.139> the<00:05:13.200> shore<00:05:13.620> but<00:05:14.520> the<00:05:14.669> energy<00:05:14.850> came

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:15.450 
there by the shore but the energy came

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:18.440 
there by the shore but the energy came
from<00:05:15.510> farther<00:05:16.410> out<00:05:16.770> the<00:05:17.639> water<00:05:17.910> on<00:05:18.120> the<00:05:18.240> shore

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:18.450 
from farther out the water on the shore

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:21.379 
from farther out the water on the shore
does<00:05:18.750> move<00:05:19.139> but<00:05:19.979> it's<00:05:20.130> really<00:05:20.389> transferring

00:05:21.379 --> 00:05:21.389 
does move but it's really transferring

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:23.960 
does move but it's really transferring
energy<00:05:21.600> not<00:05:22.440> finding<00:05:22.919> energy<00:05:23.160> in<00:05:23.639> and<00:05:23.850> of

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:23.970 
energy not finding energy in and of

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:26.930 
energy not finding energy in and of
itself<00:05:24.330> and<00:05:24.840> so<00:05:25.410> likewise<00:05:25.919> the<00:05:26.100> fingers<00:05:26.580> they

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:26.940 
itself and so likewise the fingers they

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:29.570 
itself and so likewise the fingers they
do<00:05:27.000> move<00:05:27.570> but<00:05:28.080> they're<00:05:28.340> transferring<00:05:29.340> energy

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:29.580 
do move but they're transferring energy

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:31.820 
do move but they're transferring energy
that<00:05:30.090> comes<00:05:30.330> from<00:05:30.450> farther<00:05:30.930> up<00:05:31.200> in<00:05:31.500> the

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:31.830 
that comes from farther up in the

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:33.800 
that comes from farther up in the
physiology<00:05:32.340> they're<00:05:32.789> not<00:05:32.940> summoning<00:05:33.630> their

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:33.810 
physiology they're not summoning their

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:36.469 
physiology they're not summoning their
own<00:05:33.990> energy<00:05:34.500> they're<00:05:34.950> really<00:05:35.190> too<00:05:35.370> small<00:05:35.639> to

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:36.479 
own energy they're really too small to

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:37.190 
own energy they're really too small to
do<00:05:36.660> the<00:05:36.780> job

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:37.200 
do the job

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:39.409 
do the job
entirely<00:05:37.860> by<00:05:38.130> themselves<00:05:38.580> so<00:05:38.880> check<00:05:39.090> out<00:05:39.270> this

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:39.419 
entirely by themselves so check out this

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:42.140 
entirely by themselves so check out this
slow<00:05:39.750> motion<00:05:39.960> video<00:05:40.440> and<00:05:40.770> now<00:05:41.250> see<00:05:41.820> what<00:05:42.000> you

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:42.150 
slow motion video and now see what you

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:49.870 
slow motion video and now see what you
think

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:49.880 

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:51.940
