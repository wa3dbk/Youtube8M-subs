okay I'm gonna give you guys little um
demonstration<00:00:03.840> of<00:00:03.929> the<00:00:04.020> electronic<00:00:04.589> pads

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:04.830 
demonstration of the electronic pads

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.360 
demonstration of the electronic pads
because<00:00:05.160> um<00:00:05.640> someone<00:00:06.330> asked<00:00:06.540> about<00:00:06.720> it<00:00:07.080> and<00:00:07.370> I

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
because um someone asked about it and I

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.120 
because um someone asked about it and I
pretty<00:00:09.210> much<00:00:09.300> put<00:00:09.630> the<00:00:09.719> system<00:00:10.110> together<00:00:10.290> um<00:00:10.800> I

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
pretty much put the system together um I

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.459 
pretty much put the system together um I
designed<00:00:11.610> the<00:00:11.759> original<00:00:11.849> pads<00:00:12.389> myself<00:00:13.019> I<00:00:13.259> made

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
designed the original pads myself I made

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.250 
designed the original pads myself I made
them<00:00:13.650> out<00:00:13.799> of<00:00:13.830> a<00:00:14.130> Remo<00:00:14.549> practice<00:00:15.030> pads<00:00:15.299> and<00:00:15.690> I

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
them out of a Remo practice pads and I

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.170 
them out of a Remo practice pads and I
put<00:00:16.500> little<00:00:16.680> piece<00:00:16.920> o<00:00:17.070> transducers<00:00:17.880> in<00:00:18.060> them

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
put little piece o transducers in them

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.230 
put little piece o transducers in them
and<00:00:18.270> wired<00:00:18.510> him<00:00:18.720> up<00:00:18.840> to<00:00:19.770> work<00:00:20.520> his<00:00:20.670> electronic

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
and wired him up to work his electronic

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.670 
and wired him up to work his electronic
drum<00:00:21.480> pads<00:00:21.720> but<00:00:21.930> I<00:00:21.990> was<00:00:22.170> getting<00:00:22.410> too<00:00:22.560> much

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
drum pads but I was getting too much

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.370 
drum pads but I was getting too much
cross<00:00:23.039> talk<00:00:23.400> between<00:00:23.430> the<00:00:24.029> pads<00:00:24.269> so<00:00:25.109> like<00:00:25.260> when

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
cross talk between the pads so like when

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.310 
cross talk between the pads so like when
I<00:00:25.439> hit<00:00:25.710> another<00:00:25.830> pad<00:00:26.310> or<00:00:26.699> like<00:00:27.660> a<00:00:27.689> drum<00:00:28.019> near<00:00:28.260> a

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
I hit another pad or like a drum near a

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.830 
I hit another pad or like a drum near a
pad<00:00:28.619> one<00:00:29.519> of<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:29.670> pads<00:00:29.880> would<00:00:30.060> go<00:00:30.240> off<00:00:30.420> because

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
pad one of the pads would go off because

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.170 
pad one of the pads would go off because
the<00:00:30.960> transducers<00:00:31.619> were<00:00:31.769> too<00:00:31.949> sensitive<00:00:32.399> so<00:00:33.149> I

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
the transducers were too sensitive so I

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.850 
the transducers were too sensitive so I
got<00:00:33.329> these<00:00:33.450> rolling<00:00:33.809> pads<00:00:34.200> they're<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:34.680> best

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
got these rolling pads they're the best

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.290 
got these rolling pads they're the best
I<00:00:35.010> can<00:00:35.070> do<00:00:35.309> right<00:00:35.340> now<00:00:35.550> because<00:00:36.030> I<00:00:36.090> can't

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
I can do right now because I can't

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.410 
I can do right now because I can't
afford<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:37.440> actual<00:00:37.800> mandalo<00:00:38.309> pads<00:00:38.640> but

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
afford the the actual mandalo pads but

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.290 
afford the the actual mandalo pads but
um<00:00:39.629> they<00:00:39.870> work<00:00:40.050> pretty<00:00:40.200> well<00:00:40.350> um<00:00:40.739> I<00:00:41.460> have<00:00:42.120> them

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
um they work pretty well um I have them

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.950 
um they work pretty well um I have them
all<00:00:42.510> running<00:00:42.950> into<00:00:43.950> a<00:00:43.980> role<00:00:44.219> in<00:00:44.399> TMC<00:00:44.820> 6<00:00:45.510> midi

a MIDI signal and sends it into the

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.029 
a MIDI signal and sends it into the
computer<00:00:56.250> and<00:00:56.840> I<00:00:57.840> am<00:00:58.230> I<00:00:58.410> have<00:00:58.680> two<00:00:58.859> different

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
computer and I am I have two different

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.760 
computer and I am I have two different
softwares<00:00:59.760> i've<00:00:59.969> been<00:01:00.120> using<00:01:00.359> i<00:01:00.780> have<00:01:01.289> battery

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
softwares i've been using i have battery

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.390 
softwares i've been using i have battery
too<00:01:02.100> but<00:01:03.059> I<00:01:03.300> i<00:01:03.930> tend<00:01:04.290> to<00:01:04.350> use<00:01:04.409> that<00:01:04.710> more<00:01:05.010> of<00:01:05.220> us

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
too but I i tend to use that more of us

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.789 
too but I i tend to use that more of us
on<00:01:06.030> more<00:01:06.270> of<00:01:06.360> a<00:01:06.450> plugin<00:01:06.689> for<00:01:07.080> recordings

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
on more of a plugin for recordings

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.370 
on more of a plugin for recordings
because<00:01:08.520> my<00:01:08.670> computer<00:01:09.150> doesn't<00:01:09.270> have<00:01:09.510> quite

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
because my computer doesn't have quite

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.410 
because my computer doesn't have quite
the<00:01:10.500> speed<00:01:10.920> to<00:01:11.100> handle<00:01:11.460> it<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.700> way<00:01:11.729> I<00:01:11.880> want<00:01:12.330> it

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
the speed to handle it the way I want it

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.170 
the speed to handle it the way I want it
to<00:01:12.659> so<00:01:13.350> until<00:01:13.590> I<00:01:13.680> get<00:01:13.799> a<00:01:13.830> new<00:01:14.040> computer<00:01:14.189> I've

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
to so until I get a new computer I've

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.940 
to so until I get a new computer I've
umm<00:01:15.479> actually<00:01:15.869> I've<00:01:16.110> got<00:01:16.320> a<00:01:16.350> program<00:01:16.770> called

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
umm actually I've got a program called

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.340 
umm actually I've got a program called
Ram<00:01:17.340> drum<00:01:17.790> which<00:01:18.780> it's<00:01:19.290> a<00:01:19.710> basic<00:01:20.299> trigger

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
Ram drum which it's a basic trigger

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.020 
Ram drum which it's a basic trigger
software<00:01:22.350> it<00:01:22.530> doesn't<00:01:22.860> have<00:01:22.979> any<00:01:23.189> effects<00:01:23.759> on

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
software it doesn't have any effects on

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.940 
software it doesn't have any effects on
it<00:01:24.270> it<00:01:24.360> doesn't<00:01:24.540> do<00:01:24.750> anything<00:01:25.080> crazy<00:01:25.290> so<00:01:25.830> it

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
it it doesn't do anything crazy so it

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.850 
it it doesn't do anything crazy so it
doesn't<00:01:26.250> use<00:01:26.369> a<00:01:26.400> lot<00:01:26.670> of<00:01:26.700> memory<00:01:27.119> I<00:01:27.439> load<00:01:28.439> all

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
doesn't use a lot of memory I load all

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.999 
doesn't use a lot of memory I load all
my<00:01:29.159> samples<00:01:30.090> into<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.540> software<00:01:30.960> as<00:01:31.350> wav

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
my samples into the software as wav

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.490 
my samples into the software as wav
files<00:01:32.400> and<00:01:32.790> assign<00:01:33.540> each<00:01:33.570> one<00:01:33.990> a<00:01:34.020> MIDI<00:01:34.259> note

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.230 
files and assign each one a MIDI note
and<00:01:34.770> each<00:01:35.280> of<00:01:35.430> these<00:01:35.520> pads<00:01:35.820> has<00:01:36.090> the

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
and each of these pads has the

and each of these pads has the
corresponding<00:01:36.930> MIDI<00:01:37.110> note<00:01:37.350> i<00:01:37.619> also<00:01:38.130> have

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
corresponding MIDI note i also have

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.749 
corresponding MIDI note i also have
different<00:01:38.850> banks<00:01:39.360> i<00:01:39.450> can<00:01:39.659> call<00:01:39.869> up<00:01:40.110> on<00:01:40.290> the<00:01:40.860> the

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
different banks i can call up on the the

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.690 
different banks i can call up on the the
processor<00:01:42.329> the<00:01:42.600> midi<00:01:43.320> converter<00:01:43.560> so<00:01:44.490> that<00:01:44.670> i

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
processor the midi converter so that i

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.060 
processor the midi converter so that i
can<00:01:44.840> switch<00:01:45.840> to<00:01:46.079> different<00:01:46.229> sounds<00:01:46.770> just<00:01:46.979> by

so<00:01:58.290> it<00:01:58.409> sounds<00:01:58.740> just<00:01:58.799> like<00:01:59.159> it<00:01:59.399> and<00:01:59.610> I<00:01:59.670> plug

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
so it sounds just like it and I plug

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.250 
so it sounds just like it and I plug
them<00:02:00.090> right<00:02:00.119> in<00:02:00.420> so<00:02:00.659> you

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:04.260 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:42.260 

pretty<00:02:04.950> simple

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:44.760 

so<00:02:43.270> that's<00:02:43.450> pretty<00:02:43.630> much<00:02:43.720> that<00:02:43.990> and<00:02:44.020> I<00:02:44.260> also<00:02:44.290> if

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:44.770 
so that's pretty much that and I also if

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:46.890 
so that's pretty much that and I also if
I<00:02:44.860> switch<00:02:45.160> the<00:02:45.460> if<00:02:45.850> I<00:02:46.000> switch<00:02:46.210> the<00:02:46.360> memory<00:02:46.630> bank

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
I switch the if I switch the memory bank

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.020 
I switch the if I switch the memory bank
I've<00:02:47.110> got<00:02:47.770> the<00:02:48.010> regular<00:02:48.340> tabla<00:02:48.760> for<00:02:48.940> the

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
I've got the regular tabla for the

00:02:49.030 --> 00:03:02.490 
I've got the regular tabla for the
middle<00:02:49.360> of<00:02:49.450> the<00:02:49.510> song<00:03:01.140> so<00:03:02.140> that's<00:03:02.290> pretty<00:03:02.440> much

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
middle of the song so that's pretty much

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:26.120 
middle of the song so that's pretty much
I<00:03:02.650> can<00:03:02.800> also<00:03:02.920> do

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:29.010 

now<00:03:27.130> occasionally<00:03:27.610> they<00:03:27.970> false<00:03:28.270> trigger<00:03:28.660> and

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:29.020 
now occasionally they false trigger and

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:31.560 
now occasionally they false trigger and
it's<00:03:29.440> because<00:03:29.800> I'm<00:03:30.580> hitting<00:03:30.940> the<00:03:31.060> rim<00:03:31.240> and<00:03:31.480> the

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:31.570 
it's because I'm hitting the rim and the

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:33.450 
it's because I'm hitting the rim and the
rim<00:03:31.900> is<00:03:31.930> actually<00:03:32.440> a<00:03:32.470> separate<00:03:32.890> zone<00:03:33.130> so<00:03:33.400> I

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:33.460 
rim is actually a separate zone so I

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:35.730 
rim is actually a separate zone so I
could<00:03:33.640> program<00:03:33.850> the<00:03:34.030> rims<00:03:34.390> of<00:03:34.540> these<00:03:34.720> pads<00:03:35.080> to

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:35.740 
could program the rims of these pads to

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:38.220 
could program the rims of these pads to
do<00:03:35.860> what<00:03:36.010> I<00:03:36.040> want<00:03:36.310> to<00:03:36.580> I<00:03:37.450> just<00:03:37.660> don't<00:03:37.990> have

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
do what I want to I just don't have

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:41.100 
do what I want to I just don't have
enough<00:03:38.710> need<00:03:39.670> for<00:03:40.000> sounds<00:03:40.450> to<00:03:40.570> do<00:03:40.690> that<00:03:40.870> but<00:03:40.990> if

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.110 
enough need for sounds to do that but if

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:43.860 
enough need for sounds to do that but if
I<00:03:41.230> had<00:03:41.470> a<00:03:41.770> song<00:03:42.310> where<00:03:42.580> say<00:03:42.760> I<00:03:42.790> needed<00:03:43.180> 10

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
I had a song where say I needed 10

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:45.780 
I had a song where say I needed 10
different<00:03:44.140> sounds<00:03:44.980> in<00:03:45.040> a<00:03:45.160> song<00:03:45.400> I<00:03:45.640> could

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
different sounds in a song I could

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:47.610 
different sounds in a song I could
program<00:03:46.000> for<00:03:46.480> into<00:03:46.900> the<00:03:46.990> heads<00:03:47.200> of<00:03:47.290> the<00:03:47.350> pads

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
program for into the heads of the pads

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:50.190 
program for into the heads of the pads
and<00:03:47.920> for<00:03:48.550> into<00:03:48.790> the<00:03:48.880> rims<00:03:49.090> as<00:03:49.300> you<00:03:49.390> see<00:03:49.570> when<00:03:50.140> I

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:50.200 
and for into the rims as you see when I

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.170 
and for into the rims as you see when I
hit<00:03:50.350> the<00:03:50.410> rim<00:03:50.740> it<00:03:50.890> doesn't<00:03:51.190> mean<00:03:51.280> to<00:03:51.430> sound<00:03:51.700> but

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
hit the rim it doesn't mean to sound but

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:53.550 
hit the rim it doesn't mean to sound but
if<00:03:52.300> i<00:03:52.390> were<00:03:52.510> to<00:03:52.600> program<00:03:52.930> a<00:03:52.960> sound<00:03:53.230> into<00:03:53.470> the

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
if i were to program a sound into the

00:03:53.560 --> 00:04:09.030 
if i were to program a sound into the
rim<00:03:53.710> I<00:03:53.800> could<00:03:53.980> do<00:03:54.070> 22<00:03:54.850> sounds<00:03:55.060> per<00:03:55.300> pad<00:04:07.890> as<00:04:08.890> you

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 
rim I could do 22 sounds per pad as you

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.280 
rim I could do 22 sounds per pad as you
see<00:04:09.160> there<00:04:09.310> pretty<00:04:09.430> fast<00:04:09.670> too<00:04:09.940> i<00:04:10.090> get<00:04:10.960> all<00:04:11.170> the

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.290 
see there pretty fast too i get all the

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:19.560 
see there pretty fast too i get all the
speed<00:04:11.530> i<00:04:11.560> need<00:04:11.830> out<00:04:11.980> of<00:04:12.010> them<00:04:12.220> um<00:04:18.390> I've<00:04:19.390> also

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
speed i need out of them um I've also

00:04:19.570 --> 00:05:15.040 
speed i need out of them um I've also
got<00:04:19.840> 46<00:04:20.380> and<00:04:20.530> two

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:15.050 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:45.760 

got<00:05:16.050> some<00:05:16.260> keys<00:05:17.240> snare<00:05:18.240> drum<00:05:18.270> samples<00:05:18.990> side

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:45.770 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:48.159 

and<00:05:46.340> I<00:05:46.430> can<00:05:46.610> also<00:05:46.729> trigger<00:05:47.090> longer<00:05:47.629> samples<00:05:48.080> I

00:05:48.159 --> 00:05:48.169 
and I can also trigger longer samples I

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:57.129 
and I can also trigger longer samples I
got<00:05:48.379> a<00:05:48.410> timpani<00:05:48.800> roll<00:05:48.919> right<00:05:49.250> here<00:05:56.020> so<00:05:57.020> it's

00:05:57.129 --> 00:05:57.139 
got a timpani roll right here so it's

00:05:57.139 --> 00:05:58.779 
got a timpani roll right here so it's
pretty<00:05:57.259> much<00:05:57.379> endless<00:05:57.830> some<00:05:58.220> they're<00:05:58.490> not<00:05:58.639> as

00:05:58.779 --> 00:05:58.789 
pretty much endless some they're not as

00:05:58.789 --> 00:06:00.999 
pretty much endless some they're not as
accurate<00:05:59.000> as<00:05:59.330> I'd<00:05:59.509> like<00:05:59.780> but<00:06:00.050> I<00:06:00.229> can't<00:06:00.590> afford

00:06:00.999 --> 00:06:01.009 
accurate as I'd like but I can't afford

00:06:01.009 --> 00:06:02.680 
accurate as I'd like but I can't afford
