00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:06.569
 napoli loses maradona in a few days 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.910
 head and a housewife activity in 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.920
 championship that had lasted for 17 months 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.269
 27th expulsion of alemao per 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.980
 this reaction foul 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.139
 even reiterated with a red card 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.640
 already extracted a reaction certainly not 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.039
 worthy for a protagonist of two 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.660
 World Cup in Naples, therefore, in ten matches 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.460
 prejudiced and referee in the mood for 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.240
 warnings and decisions they make 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.710
 to discuss 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.779
 eight yellow and one red cards 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.519
 extracted over the 90 minutes 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.900
 I believe that the skilled can 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.460
 make a mistake 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.750
 in the same way in the same way 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.149
 wrong one player in the middle of the field 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.100
 someone wants us to understand now 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.110
 tonight I'm curious to see the 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.059
 slow motion because I have the impression that 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.219
 today a demonstration of how you can 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.930
 lose the match 

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:47.629
 at the twenty-fourth careca he is stopped 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.469
 in area for nichi is simulation 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:51.420
 thirty-fifth on the occasion of the first 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.190
 goals Cagliari defense protests 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.350
 Neapolitan for the alleged position in 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.190
 offside of fonseca and rocco to siglare 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.230
 the network 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.210
 the nervous naples is looking for a draw at 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.370
 42nd silence on cross from the right 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.930
 strikes with the defending defender 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.909
 for the referee unintentionally the 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.229
 ball with the arm a few seconds 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.600
 from the end of the first half the Azzurri 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.400
 equalize foul in area on silences 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.250
 referee indicating the diskette 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.080
 careca realizes in the second half the 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.560
 Naples spends but Cagliari is 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.869
 collect at the 68th success 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.420
 swim remained in ten we had to 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.570
 spend treasures of energy 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.799
 to see to recover the immediate 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.900
 disadvantage we have immediately after 

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:31.700
 hand expulsion 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.710
 this behavior was also paying off 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.380
 because we must not forget that on 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.850
 header of silence deflected by the al 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.170
 wrist through born very close to 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:43.520
 advantage and overturning in front 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:45.729
 practically a shot deflected by coradini 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.920
 it is replaced by squares and it has cost 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:50.299
 the goal that decided the game 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.590
 bath attacks and confused at the end for 

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:53.299
 the champions of italy ielpo 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.550
 at the eighty-seventh save the result 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:57.670
 on a shot from mauro and cagliari wins in 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:00.200
 transfer to Naples to Cagliari 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.000
 maybe it's not as nice as today but not 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.479
 it's not as bad as it was 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.479
 past Sunday 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:10.990
 It was twice on the face once 

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:14.860
 and once in the field a lost Naples 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:19.360
 it is a napoli that makes news in Naples 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:21.760
 defeated today I believe that 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:24.880
 so it was a bad day because 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:27.600
 from the beginning cagliari a match 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.400
 without stealing anything I believe that 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.810
 finally as a restart where it wins though 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.819
 there are so many things to review 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.860
 in the aspect the referee here was 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:40.270
 certainly a bit of nervousness on the pitch 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:42.310
 but perhaps also sharpened by certain by some 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:45.069
 attitudes of the referee certainly 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:47.950
 it was not a quiet game 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:50.109
 the naples here are after the expulsion of are 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.450
 been of the moments that has lost a little the 

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:52.870
 head however after returning to the 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.290
 calm 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:59.139
 unfortunately he is the author of the goal of the goal of 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:01.389
 cagliari naturally a goal so a little 

00:02:59.139 --> 00:03:03.519
 discussed according to some and talked about 

00:03:01.389 --> 00:03:05.590
 offside here we are now wanting to tell 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:08.139
 a little this this wants and how 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:10.329
 you were on the field if the goal 

00:03:08.139 --> 00:03:12.400
 according to me it was not offside anyway 

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:13.389
 I don't know why he was in the field not 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.980
 I saw well 

00:03:13.389 --> 00:03:16.510
 the championship is very complicated now 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.519
 because naples already departing with two 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:20.290
 so a policy woman starts with a 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:22.389
 draw and one at home even with 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.129
 a defeat after 17 months of 

00:03:22.389 --> 00:03:26.439
 unbeaten 

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:28.989
 sure it gets complicated yes also because me 

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:30.459
 it seems that for the other wheel of the 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:31.840
 luck turns your way to 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:34.419
 boats both mine and the ski pietro 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.280
 now make the last result 

00:03:34.419 --> 00:03:38.319
 we unfortunately took a crossbar 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.819
 and on the overturning in front we have 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:41.530
 immediately scored on goal 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:43.829
 however, football is also right that 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:43.829
 so be it
