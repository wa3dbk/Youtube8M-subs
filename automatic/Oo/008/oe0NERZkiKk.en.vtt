00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.650 
varying degrees of power and I'll touch
upon<00:00:49.350> that<00:00:49.620> later<00:00:49.829> in<00:00:49.950> the<00:00:50.039> video

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:50.660 
upon that later in the video

upon that later in the video
but<00:00:51.660> it's<00:00:51.960> mostly<00:00:52.410> exclusive<00:00:52.890> to<00:00:53.010> Saiyans<00:00:53.370> the

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
but it's mostly exclusive to Saiyans the

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.910 
but it's mostly exclusive to Saiyans the

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
only exception is sell himself could do

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.680 
only exception is sell himself could do
one<00:00:56.070> but<00:00:56.219> that's<00:00:56.309> because<00:00:56.640> he<00:00:56.730> had<00:00:56.850> say<00:00:57.120> in<00:00:57.180> DNA

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
one but that's because he had say in DNA

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.420 
one but that's because he had say in DNA
and<00:00:57.930> he<00:00:58.379> had<00:00:58.500> a<00:00:58.530> Zheng<00:00:58.800> Kai<00:00:58.980> boost<00:00:59.219> in<00:00:59.340> the
