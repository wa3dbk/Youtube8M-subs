00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:12.910
 two 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:14.080
 but he stopped here in the review of another 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:19.210
 written mod 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:21.670
 and well, that writing as a way 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:24.480
 fti since you have added several functions or 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:28.180
 that I have long and then the function is that 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:31.600
 ÁS when you attack a mod any type of 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:34.470
 so I have several or many mods and 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:37.740
 Well, when you attack 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:39.420
 It makes an effect as we have d 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:41.700
 so thanks to pc and well 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.390
 we started with the others that when 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.700
 we attack components 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.170
 it comes out in red particles that would be in 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:51.050
 reston but in my case they would be blood 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:53.870
 make up an effect when it dies and 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.640
 Well, since we also have the west 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:58.309
 that then pretty much that fuck and like 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:02.629
 can see is an effect and if they want what 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:07.280
 you can go trying on moto bike ok ok ok 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:09.680
 all modes do that that's obvious and 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:14.600
 Well, I do not know why I'm going to have to 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:16.700
 remove it but this one as I said all 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.649
 the modes can do it 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.229
 this we are going to try the new one with the 

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:24.170
 clipper before I shit on everything 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:25.759
 we go with the zombie and then when 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.850
 touch does the same is like 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:33.049
 blood but when it dies it has an effect 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:37.759
 as if I had the plus and a half rare and 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:39.829
 it lasts as long as 5 seconds to die and 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:42.110
 before then he died at once like that 

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:43.969
 we're going to let pickman 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:47.070
 attack it all here because I know they're going 

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:49.020
 to come all ok 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.880
 we attack and as you can see it has a 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.270
 pretty cool effect this model believes 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:57.300
 I obviously and it works for all 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.729
 mods if it works for any type 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:01.800
 it can be the chicken to see if I can 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.610
 expose a sample but I do not have it 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:06.060
 over here why 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:08.099
 a case of a fool 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:11.459
 and then the woman also as you can see 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:12.920
 make pretty particles generate blood 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:16.099
 and all that 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:19.130
 so how can you see that is the 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:21.640
 Indeed they do all mods when 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:23.680
 the ibeyis hate them 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.200
 as you can see all the all do 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.860
 they make that effect pretty cool and the 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.650
 particle I love how you can see 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:34.470
 it works pretty cool 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:37.950
 the very simple subject but I think that at 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:39.900
 add something of a little better yet 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.959
 better things to what you love i khas 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:45.569
 and person I hope you try it because 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:47.489
 the truth does not last long but if it lasts 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:50.650
 something so good about tables and creams 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:53.340
 and I commented until next time 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.340
