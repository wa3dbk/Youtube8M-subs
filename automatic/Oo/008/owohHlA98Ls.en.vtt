how to improve yourself for the next

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:19.380 
how to improve yourself for the next
game<00:00:16.859> obviously<00:00:17.859> we<00:00:18.099> moved<00:00:18.310> to<00:00:18.550> a<00:00:18.880> new<00:00:19.090> part<00:00:19.330> of

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:19.390 
game obviously we moved to a new part of

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:20.820 
game obviously we moved to a new part of
the<00:00:19.449> country<00:00:19.509> new<00:00:20.019> conditions<00:00:20.500> and<00:00:20.619> we<00:00:20.679> need

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:20.830 
the country new conditions and we need

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:22.859 
the country new conditions and we need
to<00:00:20.920> be<00:00:20.980> able<00:00:21.039> to<00:00:21.250> adapt<00:00:21.429> to<00:00:21.460> that<00:00:21.730> so<00:00:21.970> you<00:00:22.779> know

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:22.869 
to be able to adapt to that so you know

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:24.240 
to be able to adapt to that so you know
I<00:00:22.900> think<00:00:22.990> it's<00:00:23.230> just<00:00:23.289> wise<00:00:23.710> had<00:00:24.009> good

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:24.250 
I think it's just wise had good

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:26.489 
I think it's just wise had good
leadership<00:00:24.400> and<00:00:24.939> you<00:00:25.750> know<00:00:25.869> as<00:00:26.019> I<00:00:26.140> say<00:00:26.320> the

00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:26.499 
leadership and you know as I say the

00:00:26.499 --> 00:00:28.079 
leadership and you know as I say the
site<00:00:26.710> has<00:00:26.859> a<00:00:26.890> lot<00:00:27.070> of<00:00:27.220> good<00:00:27.429> references<00:00:27.939> to

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:28.089 
site has a lot of good references to

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:29.640 
site has a lot of good references to
fall<00:00:28.269> back<00:00:28.449> on<00:00:28.630> even<00:00:28.900> though<00:00:29.109> the<00:00:29.259> last<00:00:29.439> four

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:29.650 
fall back on even though the last four

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:31.800 
fall back on even though the last four
days<00:00:29.769> has<00:00:30.730> been<00:00:30.910> really<00:00:31.150> disappointing<00:00:31.689> I

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:31.810 
days has been really disappointing I

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:33.390 
days has been really disappointing I
think<00:00:32.169> that<00:00:32.320> there's<00:00:32.710> enough<00:00:32.890> confidence

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:33.400 
think that there's enough confidence

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.030 
think that there's enough confidence
there<00:00:33.580> to<00:00:33.790> help<00:00:34.630> us<00:00:34.840> in<00:00:35.410> the<00:00:35.530> next<00:00:35.560> game<00:00:35.860> I

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:36.040 
there to help us in the next game I

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.350 
there to help us in the next game I
think<00:00:36.160> we<00:00:36.370> played<00:00:36.460> as<00:00:36.730> good<00:00:36.970> a<00:00:37.000> cricketers

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:37.360 
think we played as good a cricketers

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.720 
think we played as good a cricketers
were<00:00:37.480> played<00:00:37.720> over<00:00:37.840> the<00:00:38.050> past<00:00:38.230> few<00:00:39.160> months

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:39.730 
were played over the past few months

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:41.610 
were played over the past few months
I<00:00:39.790> think<00:00:40.420> batters<00:00:40.900> deserve<00:00:41.230> a<00:00:41.260> lot<00:00:41.410> of<00:00:41.440> credit

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:41.620 
I think batters deserve a lot of credit

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:45.120 
I think batters deserve a lot of credit
and<00:00:41.920> I<00:00:42.010> were<00:00:42.100> to<00:00:42.160> make<00:00:43.470> the<00:00:44.470> runs<00:00:44.650> they<00:00:44.740> did<00:00:45.010> on

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:45.130 
and I were to make the runs they did on

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:46.980 
and I were to make the runs they did on
on<00:00:45.520> quite<00:00:45.760> a<00:00:45.790> tough<00:00:46.060> batting<00:00:46.420> with<00:00:46.540> it<00:00:46.690> and

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:46.990 
on quite a tough batting with it and

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:48.840 
on quite a tough batting with it and
then<00:00:47.650> our<00:00:47.740> execution<00:00:48.280> with<00:00:48.370> the<00:00:48.460> ball<00:00:48.610> and<00:00:48.730> the

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:48.850 
then our execution with the ball and the

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:50.160 
then our execution with the ball and the
second<00:00:49.180> innings<00:00:49.390> especially<00:00:49.810> I<00:00:49.870> thought<00:00:50.050> was

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:50.170 
second innings especially I thought was

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.170 
second innings especially I thought was
was<00:00:50.980> a<00:00:51.010> lot<00:00:51.220> better<00:00:51.400> than<00:00:51.490> the<00:00:51.640> first<00:00:51.760> innings

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:52.180 
was a lot better than the first innings

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:53.880 
was a lot better than the first innings
I<00:00:52.300> think<00:00:52.570> obviously<00:00:52.900> Mitch<00:00:53.320> was<00:00:53.560> was

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:53.890 
I think obviously Mitch was was

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:56.250 
I think obviously Mitch was was
outstanding<00:00:54.250> once<00:00:54.580> again<00:00:54.850> but<00:00:55.120> I<00:00:55.330> think<00:00:56.110> we'll

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:56.260 
outstanding once again but I think we'll

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.100 
outstanding once again but I think we'll
little<00:00:56.650> bit<00:00:56.800> short<00:00:57.220> with<00:00:58.210> the<00:00:58.690> ball<00:00:58.870> in<00:00:58.990> the

00:00:59.100 --> 00:00:59.110 
little bit short with the ball in the

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:00.600 
little bit short with the ball in the
first<00:00:59.320> innings<00:00:59.680> and<00:00:59.890> then<00:01:00.190> I<00:01:00.220> think<00:01:00.520> we

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:00.610 
first innings and then I think we

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:03.060 
first innings and then I think we
executed<00:01:01.210> very<00:01:01.960> well<00:01:02.020> in<00:01:02.260> the<00:01:02.350> second<00:01:02.680> D<00:01:02.800> but

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:03.070 
executed very well in the second D but

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:04.950 
executed very well in the second D but
credit<00:01:04.030> a<00:01:04.150> lot<00:01:04.180> of<00:01:04.360> credit<00:01:04.570> to<00:01:04.690> go<00:01:04.780> to<00:01:04.839> our

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:04.960 
credit a lot of credit to go to our

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.550 
credit a lot of credit to go to our
batters<00:01:05.260> I<00:01:06.180> was<00:01:07.180> quite<00:01:07.360> a<00:01:07.390> nasty<00:01:07.630> wicket<00:01:08.080> to<00:01:08.470> be

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:08.560 
batters I was quite a nasty wicket to be

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.280 
batters I was quite a nasty wicket to be
honest<00:01:08.860> and<00:01:09.070> I<00:01:09.190> hated<00:01:09.580> to<00:01:09.760> see<00:01:09.970> any<00:01:10.750> team<00:01:11.080> have

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:11.290 
honest and I hated to see any team have

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.570 
honest and I hated to see any team have
to<00:01:11.410> bet<00:01:11.560> on<00:01:11.680> that<00:01:11.710> on<00:01:11.950> on<00:01:12.130> day<00:01:12.550> 5<00:01:14.580> so

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:15.580 
to bet on that on on day 5 so

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.460 
to bet on that on on day 5 so
fortunately<00:01:16.030> a<00:01:16.090> nice<00:01:16.240> toss<00:01:16.480> to<00:01:16.659> lose<00:01:16.810> when<00:01:17.290> you

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:17.470 
fortunately a nice toss to lose when you

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:20.550 
fortunately a nice toss to lose when you
can<00:01:18.340> get<00:01:19.120> wickets<00:01:19.420> like<00:01:19.570> that<00:01:19.750> against<00:01:20.200> great

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:20.560 
can get wickets like that against great

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.790 
can get wickets like that against great
opposition<00:01:22.050> you<00:01:23.050> know<00:01:23.140> it's<00:01:23.290> very<00:01:23.350> exciting

I<00:01:34.810> said<00:01:35.500> be<00:01:35.620> really<00:01:35.770> proud<00:01:36.040> at<00:01:36.190> that<00:01:36.220> moment

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
is going to be even tougher than what

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.780 
is going to be even tougher than what
we've<00:03:25.600> just<00:03:25.630> faced<00:03:25.989> so<00:03:26.380> you<00:03:27.130> know<00:03:27.250> for<00:03:27.459> us<00:03:27.579> it's

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
we've just faced so you know for us it's

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:29.280 
we've just faced so you know for us it's
about<00:03:27.910> looking<00:03:28.329> at<00:03:28.450> areas<00:03:28.750> where<00:03:28.959> we<00:03:29.140> can

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
about looking at areas where we can

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.830 
about looking at areas where we can
improve<00:03:29.530> looking<00:03:30.100> at<00:03:30.220> some<00:03:30.400> things<00:03:30.610> we<00:03:30.880> we've

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
improve looking at some things we we've

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.300 
improve looking at some things we we've
seen<00:03:32.110> in<00:03:32.260> the<00:03:32.350> South<00:03:32.500> African<00:03:32.829> teams<00:03:33.070> that<00:03:33.220> we

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
seen in the South African teams that we

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:34.830 
seen in the South African teams that we
can<00:03:33.459> exploit<00:03:33.790> a<00:03:33.850> few<00:03:34.120> weaknesses<00:03:34.329> that<00:03:34.750> we

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
can exploit a few weaknesses that we

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.440 
can exploit a few weaknesses that we
think<00:03:35.019> we<00:03:35.110> might<00:03:35.260> have<00:03:35.410> seen<00:03:36.299> but<00:03:37.299> they're<00:03:37.420> a

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
think we might have seen but they're a

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:38.009 
think we might have seen but they're a
great<00:03:37.600> team

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:38.019 
great team

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:40.890 
great team
and<00:03:38.470> they'll<00:03:39.010> come<00:03:39.190> out<00:03:39.370> you<00:03:39.970> know<00:03:40.090> nice<00:03:40.810> and

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:42.610 
tough and in PE and we'll have to beat

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:44.819 
tough and in PE and we'll have to beat
out<00:03:42.640> this<00:03:42.910> once<00:03:43.150> again<00:03:43.420> well<00:03:43.780> I<00:03:43.810> mean<00:03:44.350> I<00:03:44.440> doubt

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:44.829 
out this once again well I mean I doubt

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:46.770 
out this once again well I mean I doubt
there's<00:03:45.100> much<00:03:45.130> mental<00:03:45.730> scoring<00:03:46.209> we've<00:03:46.420> lost<00:03:46.630> a

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:52.239 
comprehensively but it's important now

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:54.750 
comprehensively but it's important now
that<00:03:52.269> we<00:03:52.959> move<00:03:53.769> away<00:03:53.890> and<00:03:54.160> obviously<00:03:54.489> still<00:03:54.730> a

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
that we move away and obviously still a

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.910 
that we move away and obviously still a
two<00:03:55.360> big<00:03:55.600> Test<00:03:55.870> matches<00:03:56.079> left<00:03:56.320> in<00:03:56.500> the<00:03:56.590> series
