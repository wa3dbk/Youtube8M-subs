00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:06.870
 reminds that tauss counter strike 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:09.929
 plays similar to how quake is live 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:12.269
 but shoot me a storm that tries as 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.160
 purebred multiplayer shooter to the 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.759
 virtues of the great classics 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.759
 to link 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:26.970
 trackmania 2 canyon a standout 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.439
 play nice and what has the whole thing now 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.269
 to do with shoot me a 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.059
 announced some time ago 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.309
 Developer studio madeo to his online 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.860
 platform to increase additional jobs 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.809
 with men followed in april the first 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.030
 extension and trailer of the trackmania 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.690
 There are some things going on 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.149
 recognize 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.610
 already in the main menu should be fans 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.379
 quickly find their way around the rage 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.440
 Here we can do our personal 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.809
 set up a profile 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:57.120
 manage friends lists and of course 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.140
 online for available multiplayer 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.570
 Search matches 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.399
 who wants to can the latter also after 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.879
 sort countries or even cities 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.920
 to let 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.600
 but enough of the main menu we want 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.479
 of course, know what the actual 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.670
 Who has Battlefield or 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.700
 call of duty server calls his home 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:17.670
 the first is a shock before big 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.050
 weapon selection it not next to a kind 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.030
 adhesive Kuhberg 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:23.820
 the only within tunnel system 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.460
 is usable there is still a railgun 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.970
 the only in certain game modes and on 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.800
 special platform is used 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:34.680
 the rest of the time we just shoot with 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:37.080
 a single weapon of energy packages 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.300
 if he is the ballermann, though 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.370
 hold in our hands or around ours 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:43.200
 we have strapped navel 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:46.080
 not because shoot me a waived 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.270
 completely on weapons models sounds 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.700
 but everything is terrible now 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.130
 the rapid game play benefit the 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.680
 schub mania is above all one 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.990
 shooter who is very accessible but from 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.390
 player a quick trigger finger and 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.800
 Neat accuracy calls here 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.930
 it's not about choice of class and 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:06.630
 leveling up also vehicles fell completely 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.170
 but with a playful 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.560
 can 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.030
 a celebration for skill players so 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.670
 Mania offers plenty of variety for this 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.620
 we play the game modes in chost 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.930
 for example in a small arena 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.180
 against a single opponent 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.700
 who the opponent first seven times 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.950
 wins the clou at the 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.760
 thing and increased only limited ammunition 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.100
 to disposal 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.540
 should we have our gracious power 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.340
 we have to mark one 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.350
 get charging points replenishment 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.010
 that was not more tension but 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:40.110
 also for a decent portion of tactics 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:42.930
 the game mode roll also points 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:45.420
 an interesting pinch as soon as we 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.250
 in the team or alone a goal in 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.860
 the middle of the card have taken 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:52.260
 pulls a whirlwind on the and after 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.630
 after the battlefield is reduced on 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.730
 end is fought in the smallest space 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:59.970
 because if we get too close to the storm 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:03.350
 let's go hobbs the iron rule is 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:06.180
 So always stay in motion 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:08.850
 who the game modes are not the developers 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:11.520
 Enough can be his creative 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:13.800
 live out ideas in the integrated editor 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:16.410
 Again, trackmania trailer applies 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:18.540
 will immediately feel at home like 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:21.870
 in the canyon there is also the construction kit 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:23.910
 here in two variants in the simple one 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:26.100
 only the 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.730
 all necessary components for 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.920
 disposal 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.900
 to quickly plug one together 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.450
 but simple battlefields is enough 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.780
 all 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:37.209
 in the complex variant allows jane 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:39.519
 yes then pretty much everything the heart 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:41.200
 desires the whole course requires 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:43.390
 his training period 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.550
 this is what editor knowledgeable one 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:48.519
 variety of components in something 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:50.590
 previous menu available besides the 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:52.750
 possibility to change the time of day 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:57.459
 For example, we can also use plugins 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:04:00.549
 install your own music and insert 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:02.280
 in the so-called mediatrade an intro movie 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:05.650
 and similar tinkering 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:08.500
 By the way, this app is not from us 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:11.019
 for that we can be incredibly good hill 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:14.049
 In the landscape plant this fan 

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:16.209
 creation has been particularly appealing to us 

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:18.280
 located in the middle of the playing field 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:19.090
 on the ball how should it be 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:21.430
 be different 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:23.080
 must be towed into the opponent's goal 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:24.910
 including matching game 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:27.550
 this is already possible in beginnings 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:29.160
 realize how much potential there is in it 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:31.930
 plugged 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:34.389
 untermStrich relapsing mania is a far 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:36.490
 solid multiplayer shooter more weapons 

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:37.539
 and exciting maps we would have then 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:40.000
 but desired 

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:42.100
 the active fans should, however, for 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.690
 supply could provide in the 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:45.690
 Change the future very quickly 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:52.370
 hey
