and I actually asked if I could exchange
it<00:00:13.410> for<00:00:13.440> a<00:00:13.559> CEO<00:00:14.420> because<00:00:15.420> you<00:00:15.509> can<00:00:15.630> exchange

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.220 
like them so I thought I'd give it a try
strung<00:00:30.090> them<00:00:30.179> before<00:00:30.539> and<00:00:30.720> I<00:00:30.779> remember<00:00:30.840> like

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
strung them before and I remember like

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.580 
strung them before and I remember like
