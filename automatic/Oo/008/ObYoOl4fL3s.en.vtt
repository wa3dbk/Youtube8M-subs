warranty repairs on it a few years back
I<00:00:31.830> don't<00:00:31.980> know<00:00:32.070> if<00:00:32.160> they<00:00:32.279> just<00:00:32.489> never<00:00:32.610> put<00:00:32.880> it

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
I don't know if they just never put it

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.979 
I don't know if they just never put it
on<00:00:33.149> but<00:00:33.899> it<00:00:34.110> seems<00:00:34.140> like<00:00:34.530> this<00:00:34.739> is<00:00:34.950> a<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.520> issue

00:00:35.979 --> 00:00:35.989 
on but it seems like this is a the issue

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:40.250 
on but it seems like this is a the issue
that<00:00:36.989> they<00:00:37.170> they<00:00:37.590> were<00:00:38.180> working<00:00:39.180> on<00:00:39.329> so<00:00:39.989> if<00:00:40.170> you

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
that they they were working on so if you

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.770 
that they they were working on so if you
see<00:00:40.530> I<00:00:40.860> noticed<00:00:41.399> this<00:00:41.790> before<00:00:42.480> and<00:00:42.570> I<00:00:42.629> thought

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
see I noticed this before and I thought

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.600 
see I noticed this before and I thought
I<00:00:42.840> just<00:00:42.960> had<00:00:43.200> to<00:00:43.350> tighten<00:00:43.649> that<00:00:43.739> nut<00:00:43.980> up<00:00:44.160> and<00:00:44.370> it

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
I just had to tighten that nut up and it

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.040 
I just had to tighten that nut up and it
would<00:00:44.760> uh<00:00:45.050> it<00:00:46.050> would<00:00:46.250> get<00:00:47.250> this<00:00:47.629> this<00:00:48.629> flush

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
would uh it would get this this flush

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.779 
would uh it would get this this flush
and<00:00:49.289> you<00:00:49.559> spin<00:00:49.800> it<00:00:49.829> straight<00:00:50.190> and<00:00:50.340> true<00:00:50.579> but

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
and you spin it straight and true but

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.660 
and you spin it straight and true but
you<00:00:51.539> notice<00:00:51.960> this<00:00:52.530> whole<00:00:52.920> mounting<00:00:53.399> plate

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
you notice this whole mounting plate

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.720 
you notice this whole mounting plate
right<00:00:53.879> here<00:00:55.010> it<00:00:56.010> uh<00:00:57.739> it<00:00:58.739> moves<00:00:59.039> quite<00:00:59.370> a<00:00:59.430> bit

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
right here it uh it moves quite a bit

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.549 
right here it uh it moves quite a bit
there's<00:00:59.910> a<00:00:59.969> lot<00:01:00.120> of<00:01:00.239> play<00:01:00.480> on<00:01:00.629> there<00:01:03.559> this

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
there's a lot of play on there this

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.020 
there's a lot of play on there this
whole<00:01:04.799> thing<00:01:05.129> I<00:01:05.369> thought<00:01:05.580> it<00:01:05.670> was<00:01:05.760> just<00:01:05.880> this

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
whole thing I thought it was just this

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.719 
whole thing I thought it was just this
mounting<00:01:06.420> plate<00:01:06.450> but<00:01:07.260> it<00:01:07.470> is<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:08.100> spindle<00:01:08.610> and

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
mounting plate but it is the spindle and

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:09.950 
mounting plate but it is the spindle and
the<00:01:08.820> mountain<00:01:09.060> glint<00:01:09.299> and<00:01:09.330> everything

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
the mountain glint and everything

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.460 
the mountain glint and everything
I've<00:01:10.200> never<00:01:10.350> taken<00:01:10.590> this<00:01:10.799> apart<00:01:12.140> you<00:01:13.140> know<00:01:13.229> I'm

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
I've never taken this apart you know I'm

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.950 
I've never taken this apart you know I'm
pretty<00:01:13.650> mechanically<00:01:14.430> inclined<00:01:14.790> but<00:01:15.030> I<00:01:15.090> you

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
pretty mechanically inclined but I you

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.120 
pretty mechanically inclined but I you
know<00:01:15.990> really<00:01:16.290> haven't<00:01:16.530> done<00:01:16.619> a<00:01:16.680> whole<00:01:16.860> lot<00:01:17.040> of

this<00:01:22.320> whole<00:01:22.470> part<00:01:22.650> of<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:22.770> car

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
this whole part of the car

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.899 
this whole part of the car
you<00:01:24.180> know<00:01:24.299> alternator<00:01:24.810> fuel<00:01:25.340> water<00:01:26.340> pumps<00:01:26.790> and

you know alternator fuel water pumps and
stuff<00:01:27.299> like<00:01:27.540> that<00:01:27.720> but<00:01:27.900> I've<00:01:28.020> never<00:01:28.229> had<00:01:28.350> to<00:01:28.470> do

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
stuff like that but I've never had to do

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.359 
stuff like that but I've never had to do
this<00:01:28.740> and<00:01:29.579> I<00:01:29.729> noticed<00:01:30.329> that<00:01:30.570> it's<00:01:31.369> connected

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
this and I noticed that it's connected

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:33.800 
this and I noticed that it's connected
right<00:01:32.579> here<00:01:32.790> it<00:01:33.090> seems<00:01:33.270> like<00:01:33.420> there's<00:01:33.600> a<00:01:33.659> lot

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
right here it seems like there's a lot

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.120 
right here it seems like there's a lot
of<00:01:33.900> play<00:01:34.020> when<00:01:34.170> I<00:01:34.229> tried<00:01:34.409> turning<00:01:34.619> it<00:01:34.920> I

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
of play when I tried turning it I

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.480 
of play when I tried turning it I
noticed<00:01:36.060> that<00:01:36.119> there's<00:01:36.450> either<00:01:37.229> here<00:01:38.189> where

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
noticed that there's either here where

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:44.330 
noticed that there's either here where
articulates<00:01:39.210> there<00:01:39.420> or<00:01:40.040> up<00:01:41.040> there<00:01:43.340> there's

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
articulates there or up there there's

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.730 
articulates there or up there there's
some<00:01:44.579> play<00:01:44.820> going<00:01:45.329> on<00:01:45.600> and<00:01:46.079> I<00:01:46.320> have<00:01:46.409> a<00:01:46.500> feeling

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
some play going on and I have a feeling

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.499 
some play going on and I have a feeling
that<00:01:47.040> it's<00:01:47.159> just<00:01:47.340> this<00:01:47.610> first<00:01:47.850> one<00:01:48.060> right<00:01:48.180> here

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
that it's just this first one right here

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.789 
that it's just this first one right here
so<00:01:49.610> I'm<00:01:50.610> not<00:01:50.670> sure<00:01:50.880> what<00:01:51.750> they<00:01:51.990> they<00:01:52.409> repaired
