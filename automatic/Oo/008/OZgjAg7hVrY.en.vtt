nouns and verbs a great way to do that

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.150 
nouns and verbs a great way to do that
is<00:00:33.809> to<00:00:33.989> make<00:00:34.170> cars<00:00:34.469> and<00:00:34.739> here<00:00:34.860> I've<00:00:34.950> made<00:00:34.980> a

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
is to make cars and here I've made a

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.760 
is to make cars and here I've made a
couple<00:00:35.340> so<00:00:35.760> I<00:00:35.790> have<00:00:36.030> adjectives<00:00:36.630> verb<00:00:37.530> and

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
couple so I have adjectives verb and

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.520 
couple so I have adjectives verb and
noun<00:00:38.010> and<00:00:38.399> you<00:00:38.430> place<00:00:39.059> them<00:00:39.300> down<00:00:39.870> on<00:00:40.290> the

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
noun and you place them down on the

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.090 
noun and you place them down on the
table<00:00:40.920> for<00:00:41.160> them<00:00:41.780> then<00:00:42.800> different<00:00:43.800> colored

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
table for them then different colored

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.340 
table for them then different colored
cards<00:00:44.579> would<00:00:44.820> contain<00:00:45.360> obviously<00:00:46.140> some

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
cards would contain obviously some

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.549 
cards would contain obviously some
adjectives<00:00:46.920> some<00:00:47.190> nouns<00:00:47.430> and<00:00:47.820> some<00:00:48.030> verbs<00:00:48.559> so

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
adjectives some nouns and some verbs so

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.540 
adjectives some nouns and some verbs so
car<00:00:50.250> and<00:00:50.760> lift<00:00:51.210> and<00:00:51.750> blue<00:00:52.320> and<00:00:52.680> all<00:00:52.800> these<00:00:52.980> that

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
car and lift and blue and all these that

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.240 
car and lift and blue and all these that
will<00:00:53.699> help<00:00:53.910> them<00:00:54.120> identify<00:00:55.160> adjectives<00:00:56.160> nouns

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
will help them identify adjectives nouns

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.420 
will help them identify adjectives nouns
and<00:00:56.610> verbs<00:00:56.670> and<00:00:57.090> memory<00:00:57.960> is<00:00:58.050> also<00:00:58.469> a<00:00:58.500> spatial

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
and verbs and memory is also a spatial

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.430 
and verbs and memory is also a spatial
intelligence<00:00:59.850> game<00:01:00.449> so<00:01:00.750> it<00:01:00.840> really<00:01:01.079> helps

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
intelligence game so it really helps

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.799 
intelligence game so it really helps
kids<00:01:01.710> who<00:01:01.980> are<00:01:02.280> working<00:01:03.120> on<00:01:03.359> spatial

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
kids who are working on spatial

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.820 
kids who are working on spatial
intelligence<00:01:04.220> memory<00:01:05.220> recall<00:01:06.170> and<00:01:07.170> then<00:01:07.439> also

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
intelligence memory recall and then also

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.890 
intelligence memory recall and then also
visual<00:01:08.310> kids<00:01:08.580> and<00:01:08.790> kinesthetic<00:01:09.060> kids<00:01:09.540> because

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
visual kids and kinesthetic kids because

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.270 
visual kids and kinesthetic kids because
they<00:01:10.049> can<00:01:10.200> use<00:01:10.380> their<00:01:10.530> hands<00:01:10.770> and<00:01:11.040> they<00:01:11.130> can

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
they can use their hands and they can

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.670 
they can use their hands and they can
visualize<00:01:11.430> what's<00:01:12.119> underneath<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:12.810> card<00:01:13.049> so

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
visualize what's underneath the card so

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.560 
visualize what's underneath the card so
you<00:01:13.740> place<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.159> cards<00:01:14.430> down<00:01:14.670> like<00:01:14.970> any<00:01:15.210> memory

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
you place the cards down like any memory

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.130 
you place the cards down like any memory
game<00:01:15.900> and<00:01:16.310> if<00:01:17.310> a<00:01:17.490> student<00:01:17.759> picks<00:01:18.420> it<00:01:18.600> up<00:01:18.689> and<00:01:18.930> at

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
game and if a student picks it up and at

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.070 
game and if a student picks it up and at
school<00:01:19.500> and<00:01:19.830> then<00:01:20.070> they<00:01:20.220> pick<00:01:20.430> up<00:01:21.080> adjectives

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
school and then they pick up adjectives

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.890 
school and then they pick up adjectives
and<00:01:22.430> they<00:01:23.430> know<00:01:23.610> that<00:01:23.880> school<00:01:24.210> is<00:01:24.390> not<00:01:24.420> an

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
and they know that school is not an

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.600 
and they know that school is not an
adjective<00:01:25.290> right<00:01:25.860> they<00:01:26.070> can<00:01:26.220> put<00:01:26.400> it<00:01:26.490> back

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
adjective right they can put it back

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.600 
adjective right they can put it back
down<00:01:26.880> they<00:01:27.780> could<00:01:27.990> pick<00:01:28.200> up<00:01:28.409> blue<00:01:28.860> oops<00:01:29.310> they

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
down they could pick up blue oops they

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.480 
down they could pick up blue oops they
just<00:01:29.820> saw<00:01:29.939> adjectives<00:01:30.770> so<00:01:31.770> they<00:01:31.890> match<00:01:32.070> blue

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
just saw adjectives so they match blue

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.179 
just saw adjectives so they match blue
to<00:01:32.909> adjectives<00:01:33.450> they<00:01:33.659> can<00:01:34.200> place<00:01:34.409> those<00:01:34.650> over

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
to adjectives they can place those over

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.640 
to adjectives they can place those over
there<00:01:35.479> creating<00:01:36.479> a<00:01:36.540> memory<00:01:36.869> game<00:01:36.930> as<00:01:37.259> I<00:01:37.439> said

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
there creating a memory game as I said

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.340 
there creating a memory game as I said
is<00:01:37.770> a<00:01:37.799> fun<00:01:38.310> way<00:01:38.670> for<00:01:39.119> students<00:01:39.540> to<00:01:39.659> manipulate

is a fun way for students to manipulate

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.499 
is a fun way for students to manipulate

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
studying this week so it could be

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.370 
studying this week so it could be
