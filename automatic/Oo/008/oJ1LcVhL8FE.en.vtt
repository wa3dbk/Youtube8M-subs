I was kind of interested in science at
school<00:00:50.329> and<00:00:50.960> always<00:00:51.109> stuck<00:00:51.350> in<00:00:51.379> my<00:00:51.499> mind<00:00:51.710> that

involved<00:00:57.440> in<00:00:57.649> agricultural<00:00:58.309> sector<00:00:58.699> I'm

00:00:58.979 --> 00:00:58.989 
involved in agricultural sector I'm

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:01.809 
involved in agricultural sector I'm
selling<00:00:59.989> farm<00:01:00.199> fades<00:01:00.469> to<00:01:00.859> farmers<00:01:01.219> my<00:01:01.670> mom

became<00:01:02.359> a<00:01:02.420> teacher<00:01:02.600> but<00:01:03.469> even<00:01:03.679> though<00:01:03.769> she<00:01:03.799> was

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.010 
became a teacher but even though she was

became a teacher but even though she was
from<00:01:04.129> a<00:01:04.159> farming<00:01:04.489> background<00:01:04.520> so<00:01:05.500> I've<00:01:06.500> maybe

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:06.710 
from a farming background so I've maybe

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:08.800 
from a farming background so I've maybe
got<00:01:06.890> a<00:01:06.920> little<00:01:06.980> bit<00:01:07.340> to<00:01:07.430> those<00:01:07.600> whose<00:01:08.600> elements

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810 
got a little bit to those whose elements

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.560 
got a little bit to those whose elements
and<00:01:09.550> form<00:01:10.550> of<00:01:10.610> my<00:01:10.730> decisions<00:01:11.150> of<00:01:11.240> what<00:01:11.360> I<00:01:11.390> was

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
and form of my decisions of what I was

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.800 
and form of my decisions of what I was
going<00:01:11.750> to<00:01:11.870> do<00:01:11.990> I<00:01:12.640> did<00:01:13.640> enjoy<00:01:13.880> school

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 
going to do I did enjoy school

going to do I did enjoy school
I<00:01:14.840> enjoyed<00:01:15.620> the<00:01:15.740> school<00:01:15.920> I<00:01:15.950> was<00:01:16.130> out<00:01:16.250> that<00:01:16.280> was

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:16.700 
I enjoyed the school I was out that was

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.580 
I enjoyed the school I was out that was
probably<00:01:16.910> the<00:01:17.330> reason<00:01:17.780> why<00:01:17.990> I<00:01:18.020> stayed<00:01:18.320> on<00:01:18.350> to

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
probably the reason why I stayed on to

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.030 
probably the reason why I stayed on to
do<00:01:18.710> a<00:01:19.040> levels<00:01:19.640> and<00:01:19.820> I<00:01:20.750> enjoyed<00:01:21.080> it<00:01:21.140> a<00:01:21.320> levels

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:22.040 
do a levels and I enjoyed it a levels

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.920 
do a levels and I enjoyed it a levels
I<00:01:22.070> thought<00:01:22.580> perhaps<00:01:22.910> didn't<00:01:23.450> prepare<00:01:23.750> me<00:01:23.900> for

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:23.930 
I thought perhaps didn't prepare me for

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.020 
I thought perhaps didn't prepare me for
the<00:01:24.110> world<00:01:24.290> of<00:01:24.380> work<00:01:24.820> compared<00:01:25.820> to<00:01:25.910> maybe

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
the world of work compared to maybe

light<00:01:27.710> on<00:01:27.920> the<00:01:28.190> subjects<00:01:28.610> led<00:01:28.790> me<00:01:28.910> onto<00:01:29.150> a

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:29.480 
light on the subjects led me onto a

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:33.520 
light on the subjects led me onto a
fairly<00:01:30.050> academic<00:01:30.560> University<00:01:31.370> course<00:01:32.440> but<00:01:33.440> to

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
fairly academic University course but to

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:35.110 
fairly academic University course but to

get my practical experience I had to be

in<00:01:35.210> the<00:01:35.330> workplace<00:01:35.800> my<00:01:36.800> logic<00:01:37.190> then<00:01:37.370> was<00:01:37.640> that

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
in the workplace my logic then was that

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.450 
in the workplace my logic then was that
everyone<00:01:38.450> has<00:01:38.750> to<00:01:38.900> eat<00:01:39.050> and<00:01:39.560> it's<00:01:40.250> probably

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
everyone has to eat and it's probably

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.310 
everyone has to eat and it's probably
logic<00:01:40.910> that<00:01:41.030> has<00:01:41.150> seen<00:01:41.420> me<00:01:41.750> through<00:01:41.780> my<00:01:42.110> career

logic that has seen me through my career
and<00:01:42.620> even<00:01:43.010> though<00:01:43.430> the<00:01:43.970> students<00:01:44.300> I<00:01:44.510> teach<00:01:45.320> now

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.400 
and even though the students I teach now
it's<00:01:46.880> even<00:01:47.060> more<00:01:47.180> important<00:01:47.660> because<00:01:47.780> of<00:01:48.050> all

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:48.410 
it's even more important because of all
