well this is the triumph

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:14.839 
well this is the triumph
it's<00:00:08.610> a<00:00:09.590> 1961<00:00:11.419> tiger<00:00:12.419> 110<00:00:13.429> it's<00:00:14.429> actually

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
it's a 1961 tiger 110 it's actually

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:21.230 
it's a 1961 tiger 110 it's actually
pretty<00:00:15.450> unique<00:00:15.749> construction<00:00:16.699> model<00:00:20.180> it<00:00:21.180> has

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
pretty unique construction model it has

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.330 
pretty unique construction model it has
the<00:00:21.570> duplex<00:00:21.990> frame<00:00:22.290> it's<00:00:22.530> a<00:00:22.590> very<00:00:22.740> last<00:00:22.920> of<00:00:23.220> the

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
the duplex frame it's a very last of the

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.330 
the duplex frame it's a very last of the
pre<00:00:23.700> unit<00:00:23.970> construction<00:00:24.230> triumphs<00:00:25.340> they

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
pre unit construction triumphs they

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.350 
pre unit construction triumphs they
actually<00:00:26.580> changed<00:00:26.880> to<00:00:26.940> the<00:00:27.060> unit

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:27.360 
actually changed to the unit

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.960 
actually changed to the unit
construction<00:00:27.590> 1962<00:00:28.590> it's<00:00:29.430> actually<00:00:29.730> got<00:00:29.880> the

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
construction 1962 it's actually got the

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.089 
construction 1962 it's actually got the
wrong<00:00:30.150> front<00:00:30.450> forks<00:00:30.810> on<00:00:31.020> I<00:00:31.200> think<00:00:31.950> there<00:00:32.070> are

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
wrong front forks on I think there are

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:40.010 
wrong front forks on I think there are
for<00:00:32.340> a<00:00:33.020> later<00:00:34.020> 60<00:00:34.590> 65<00:00:35.310> 66<00:00:35.910> Daytona<00:00:37.520> and<00:00:39.020> it

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
for a later 60 65 66 Daytona and it

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.690 
for a later 60 65 66 Daytona and it
should<00:00:40.320> have<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:40.590> bathtub<00:00:41.070> over<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:41.550> back

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
should have the bathtub over the back

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.460 
should have the bathtub over the back
wheel<00:00:41.940> actually<00:00:42.210> so<00:00:42.570> it's<00:00:42.720> not<00:00:42.840> very<00:00:43.050> standard

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:43.470 
wheel actually so it's not very standard

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:45.710 
wheel actually so it's not very standard
at<00:00:43.590> all<00:00:43.739> and<00:00:44.610> one<00:00:44.760> of<00:00:44.820> these<00:00:44.940> days<00:00:45.120> I<00:00:45.150> had<00:00:45.600> to

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:45.720 
at all and one of these days I had to

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.780 
at all and one of these days I had to
restoring<00:00:46.079> it<00:00:46.290> I<00:00:46.470> have<00:00:47.310> ridden<00:00:47.550> it<00:00:47.670> I've

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:47.790 
restoring it I have ridden it I've

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:48.920 
restoring it I have ridden it I've
actually<00:00:47.940> done<00:00:48.149> hundred<00:00:48.420> miles<00:00:48.570> an<00:00:48.690> hour<00:00:48.810> on

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
actually done hundred miles an hour on

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.389 
actually done hundred miles an hour on
it<00:00:50.239> used<00:00:51.239> to<00:00:51.300> be<00:00:51.360> quite<00:00:51.450> a<00:00:51.540> nice<00:00:51.690> bag<00:00:52.340> this<00:00:53.340> is

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
it used to be quite a nice bag this is

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.020 
it used to be quite a nice bag this is
my<00:00:53.640> other<00:00:53.730> bike<00:00:53.970> this<00:00:54.120> is<00:00:54.270> a<00:00:54.300> grave<00:00:54.510> Scottish

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.030 
my other bike this is a grave Scottish

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.740 
my other bike this is a grave Scottish
it's<00:00:57.030> also<00:00:57.149> 1961<00:00:59.239> it's<00:01:00.239> actually<00:01:00.540> quite

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
it's also 1961 it's actually quite

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.650 
it's also 1961 it's actually quite
usable<00:01:01.140> condition<00:01:02.059> it<00:01:03.059> could<00:01:03.210> do<00:01:03.360> with<00:01:03.510> a<00:01:03.570> bit

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
usable condition it could do with a bit

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.260 
usable condition it could do with a bit
of<00:01:04.070> smartening<00:01:05.070> up<00:01:05.100> making<00:01:05.489> a<00:01:05.640> bit<00:01:05.759> nicer<00:01:05.909> but

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
of smartening up making a bit nicer but

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:13.680 
of smartening up making a bit nicer but
it's<00:01:06.479> not<00:01:06.990> bad<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.290> bike

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:13.690 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:17.290 

this<00:01:14.690> one's<00:01:14.900> actually<00:01:15.020> 250<00:01:15.770> it's<00:01:16.220> about<00:01:16.880> 250

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:17.300 
this one's actually 250 it's about 250

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.530 
this one's actually 250 it's about 250
videos<00:01:17.540> Indian<00:01:18.400> it<00:01:19.400> should<00:01:19.970> originally<00:01:20.420> have

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:20.540 
videos Indian it should originally have

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.230 
videos Indian it should originally have
had<00:01:20.660> 197<00:01:21.410> but<00:01:21.560> it's<00:01:21.710> actually<00:01:21.980> been<00:01:22.240> changed

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 
had 197 but it's actually been changed

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:29.580 
had 197 but it's actually been changed
at<00:01:23.450> some<00:01:23.600> time<00:01:23.750> it's<00:01:23.960> life<00:01:24.140> before<00:01:24.980> I<00:01:25.010> had<00:01:25.250> it

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:29.590 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.660 

this<00:01:30.590> is<00:01:30.740> the<00:01:30.830> last<00:01:31.040> one<00:01:31.220> this<00:01:31.400> is<00:01:31.460> a<00:01:31.580> little

Honda<00:01:32.000> 70<00:01:32.650> which<00:01:33.650> I<00:01:33.800> was<00:01:33.920> given<00:01:37.210> one<00:01:38.210> day<00:01:38.420> I

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
Honda 70 which I was given one day I

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:39.730 
Honda 70 which I was given one day I
think<00:01:38.600> I'm<00:01:38.750> gonna<00:01:38.960> get<00:01:39.110> it<00:01:39.200> going<00:01:39.229> rub<00:01:39.620> around

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 
think I'm gonna get it going rub around

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.340 
think I'm gonna get it going rub around
the<00:01:39.890> garden<00:01:40.190> on<00:01:40.250> it<00:01:40.990> supposed<00:01:41.990> to<00:01:42.020> be<00:01:42.110> the<00:01:42.200> most

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
the garden on it supposed to be the most

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:44.950 
the garden on it supposed to be the most
reliable<00:01:42.620> motorcycle<00:01:43.280> ever<00:01:43.570> we<00:01:44.570> should<00:01:44.780> say<00:01:44.930> I

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
reliable motorcycle ever we should say I

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:50.770 
reliable motorcycle ever we should say I
don't<00:01:45.170> know<00:01:45.320> what<00:01:45.410> year<00:01:45.619> it<00:01:45.710> is<00:01:45.830> and<00:01:49.660> this<00:01:50.660> is

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
don't know what year it is and this is

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 
my workshop where I miss about making

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.180 
my workshop where I miss about making
bits<00:01:53.780> and<00:01:53.930> pieces<00:01:54.110> for<00:01:54.470> bikes<00:01:54.680> and<00:01:54.920> it's<00:01:55.009> sort

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:55.190 
bits and pieces for bikes and it's sort

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.719 
bits and pieces for bikes and it's sort
of<00:01:55.220> thing<00:01:55.400> a<00:01:55.840> couple<00:01:56.840> of<00:01:56.990> lathes<00:01:57.200> and<00:01:57.729> the

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
of thing a couple of lathes and the

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:06.790 
of thing a couple of lathes and the
older<00:01:59.619> big<00:02:00.619> sore<00:02:00.890> for<00:02:01.040> català<00:02:01.430> material<00:02:05.800> all

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:06.800 
older big sore for català material all

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
older big sore for català material all
together<00:02:06.979> I<00:02:07.160> can<00:02:07.340> do<00:02:07.430> quite<00:02:07.580> a<00:02:07.640> lot<00:02:07.700> of

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:07.820 
together I can do quite a lot of

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.590 
together I can do quite a lot of
engineering<00:02:08.209> in<00:02:08.390> here<00:02:10.060> so<00:02:11.060> that's<00:02:11.209> it<00:02:11.450> that's

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
engineering in here so that's it that's

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.740 
engineering in here so that's it that's
the<00:02:11.780> bikes<00:02:13.090> and<00:02:14.090> of<00:02:14.150> course<00:02:14.360> the<00:02:14.450> other<00:02:14.570> ones

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
the bikes and of course the other ones

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.750 
the bikes and of course the other ones
Dale<00:02:14.930> car<00:02:15.260> which<00:02:15.470> I<00:02:15.620> think<00:02:15.799> you<00:02:15.920> met<00:02:16.070> before

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:25.560 

she's<00:02:19.760> still<00:02:20.000> going<00:02:20.180> strong

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:25.570 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:29.200 

and<00:02:26.570> that's<00:02:26.780> a<00:02:26.870> lot<00:02:27.020> really
