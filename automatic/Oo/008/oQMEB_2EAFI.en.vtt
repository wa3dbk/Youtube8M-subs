00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570 
prices were more I would still go right

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:07.810

up<00:02:05.810> the<00:02:06.110> road<00:02:06.140> from<00:02:06.320> me<00:02:06.740> on<00:02:06.860> route<00:02:07.100> three<00:02:07.460> there

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:07.820 
up the road from me on route three there

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.140 
up the road from me on route three there
is<00:02:08.030> a<00:02:08.270> Acme<00:02:09.170> going<00:02:09.440> in<00:02:09.590> and<00:02:09.830> there's<00:02:10.700> nothing

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
is a Acme going in and there's nothing

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.020 
is a Acme going in and there's nothing
around<00:02:11.270> us<00:02:11.690> except<00:02:12.470> homes<00:02:12.709> so<00:02:13.190> you<00:02:13.850> know<00:02:13.970> you

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
around us except homes so you know you

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:15.790 
around us except homes so you know you
wait<00:02:14.390> for<00:02:14.690> something<00:02:14.900> like<00:02:15.140> that<00:02:15.200> to<00:02:15.380> go<00:02:15.620> in

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
wait for something like that to go in

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.130 
wait for something like that to go in
because<00:02:15.980> you<00:02:16.850> do<00:02:17.030> I<00:02:17.060> mean<00:02:17.390> it's<00:02:17.540> a<00:02:17.660> 10<00:02:17.870> minute

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
because you do I mean it's a 10 minute

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:19.630 
because you do I mean it's a 10 minute
drive<00:02:18.260> for<00:02:18.590> me<00:02:18.709> to<00:02:18.920> get<00:02:19.010> to<00:02:19.070> the<00:02:19.280> grocery<00:02:19.610> store

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
drive for me to get to the grocery store

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.020 
drive for me to get to the grocery store
so<00:02:20.290> another<00:02:21.290> hour<00:02:21.590> and<00:02:21.800> a<00:02:21.860> half<00:02:22.040> inside<00:02:22.489> is<00:02:22.820> not

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
so another hour and a half inside is not

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.670 
so another hour and a half inside is not
convenient<00:02:23.420> for<00:02:23.630> me<00:02:23.870> with<00:02:24.170> the<00:02:24.200> kids<00:02:24.590> but<00:02:25.519> it

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
convenient for me with the kids but it

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.580 
convenient for me with the kids but it
makes<00:02:27.680> it<00:02:27.890> so<00:02:28.310> nice<00:02:28.550> when<00:02:29.209> you<00:02:29.720> have<00:02:29.930> this<00:02:30.260> and

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:01.820 
on it a lot of times when I'm viewing

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:04.540

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 
that I wasn't aware that I probably

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.470 
that I wasn't aware that I probably
should<00:03:06.140> buy<00:03:06.380> so<00:03:07.130> it<00:03:07.160> sort<00:03:07.610> of<00:03:07.670> flags<00:03:07.970> my<00:03:08.240> mind

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
should buy so it sort of flags my mind

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.030 
should buy so it sort of flags my mind
that<00:03:08.720> you<00:03:08.930> know<00:03:09.170> what<00:03:09.350> maybe<00:03:09.530> I<00:03:09.650> better<00:03:09.860> get
