I<00:02:18.150> don't<00:02:18.270> know<00:02:18.330> if<00:02:18.420> Treyarch<00:02:18.810> has<00:02:18.840> a<00:02:19.080> sort<00:02:19.350> of

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
I don't know if Treyarch has a sort of

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.010 
I don't know if Treyarch has a sort of
contract<00:02:19.890> or<00:02:20.130> not<00:02:20.340> where<00:02:21.209> they<00:02:21.360> can<00:02:21.480> only<00:02:21.569> have

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
contract or not where they can only have

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.660 
contract or not where they can only have
the<00:02:22.290> zombies<00:02:22.680> and<00:02:22.860> their<00:02:22.950> games<00:02:23.220> but<00:02:23.430> I<00:02:23.550> know

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
the zombies and their games but I know

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:24.770 
the zombies and their games but I know
they're<00:02:23.910> all<00:02:24.030> kind<00:02:24.270> of<00:02:24.330> owned<00:02:24.480> by<00:02:24.540> the<00:02:24.600> same

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
they're all kind of owned by the same

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.360 
they're all kind of owned by the same
company<00:02:25.200> so<00:02:25.380> it's<00:02:25.530> just<00:02:25.680> I<00:02:25.830> don't<00:02:25.890> know<00:02:26.069> if<00:02:26.220> I

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
think it'd be a better moneymaker for

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.290 
think it'd be a better moneymaker for
them<00:02:28.680> I<00:02:29.100> mean<00:02:29.250> it'd<00:02:29.340> be<00:02:29.459> better<00:02:29.610> for<00:02:29.700> them<00:02:30.030> and

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
them I mean it'd be better for them and

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.390 
them I mean it'd be better for them and
