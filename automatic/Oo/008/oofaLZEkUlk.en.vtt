00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.620
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.710
 new video 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:10.920
 nikon today has the new nikon d 610 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.599
 featured on the nikon d 610 there was 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.519
 already rumored for a long time in the 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.139
 internet and so on and today 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.029
 these just appeared and in this 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.580
 video there is the preview to this 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.350
 camera first we come here again to 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.300
 the general technical data 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.800
 we still have a full frame 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:30.539
 sensor with 24 megapixels a duel 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:33.329
 sd card slot then is in the nikon d 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:36.030
 610 still the 39 point autofocus 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.910
 system something was criticized 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.530
 because the autofocus points quite far in 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.440
 the middle of the picture and not 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.820
 reach to the edge and that's a pity 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.739
 that was not improved 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.070
 then we will continue to have the iso values 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:53.539
 from 50 to 25,600 in the extended area 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:57.329
 the video resolution is still 

00:00:53.539 --> 00:01:00.750
 1920 x 1080p so full hd and the whole 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.680
 is at 30 25 or 24 frames per second 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.960
 possible 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.850
 the seeker has remained the same 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.610
 yes very big and good has just 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.369
 still the 0 7 times magnification 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.900
 at 100 percent field coverage 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:13.590
 In addition , the connections are the same 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.320
 remained 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.590
 There is a microphone connection one 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.869
 headphone jack a usb connection 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:24.509
 an uncompressed hdmi output as well 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:27.479
 a connection for the wifi adapter veu 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:30.299
 1b the body is exactly the same 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:33.000
 as in the Nikon D 600, the display has 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.729
 still 32 inches the buttons have that 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.890
 same layout and otherwise is the 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.079
 body exactly the same as the exact one 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.869
 identical for nikon d 600 except for the 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:45.360
 now the 610 is on top of it now 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.100
 Let's come to the innovations the first 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.920
 and probably most important innovations 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:53.100
 the nikon d 610 is that the jam problem 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.530
 has been resolved as well as the oil problem 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.509
 the nikon d 600 had many cameras 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.610
 just dust and oil on the sensor that it 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.140
 has become more and more and that has the 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.090
 nikon d 600 a pretty bad one 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.439
 reputation is given and the prices are too 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.140
 dropped pretty fast 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:08.369
 at the nikon d 610 is the problem 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.289
 be fixed now 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.270
 and that's really important because 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.380
 it's just annoying when you're dusting and 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.840
 has oil on the sensor 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.100
 you can see that in the pictures 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:20.000
 maybe a very nice picture 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:22.680
 lost then nikon has one 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.270
 series picture mode in the dress mode 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.980
 you can now add three 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.110
 make frames per second 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.810
 The crowd mode is not really 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:34.020
 super quiet but still quieter than that 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:36.210
 normal mode also in this was the 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:39.180
 series picture just increased and indeed was 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:41.790
 that from 55 frames per second to 6 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.890
 frames per second brought what a 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.050
 but small increase may be 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:48.480
 Bring her the little extra one year 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:50.310
 sometimes wrote the white balance system 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.650
 the algorithm has been improved 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.180
 renewed and so on and so on 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.310
 Colors should just become more natural 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.740
 also look a little nice 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.870
 innovation that is useful then has nikon 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:03.000
 even the switching time shortening 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:05.970
 the triggering time or the 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.650
 trigger delay which is also useful 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.360
 because you just maybe one again 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.820
 Picture does not miss if you just got it 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:14.760
 all these were now in principle all 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:16.980
 innovations of the nikon d 610 she is the 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.260
 the 600 were pretty similar but it became 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.120
 but important if small things 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.380
 improves that the dust and oil problem 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.380
 that has probably been fixed 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:26.760
 most important thing about the Nikon D 610 camera 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:30.450
 so no longer the bad image 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:32.850
 The Nikon D 610 has one for 1950 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.110
 preorder euro with the body alone 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:36.210
 and that was in mid-october 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:39.300
 delivered there are also kids with 

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:41.550
 the 24 85 millimeter lens and also 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:42.780
 still with other objective that can 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:43.940
 you then everything on the nikon 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.290
 his look 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:47.490
 the water now again from 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.440
 this video 

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:50.970
 I hope you liked it 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.250
 Write me your opinion for 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:56.660
 nikon d 610 in the comments 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.660
 Until next time
