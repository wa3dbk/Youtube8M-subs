now<00:01:28.869> the<00:01:28.930> brick<00:01:29.170> is<00:01:29.320> a<00:01:29.350> little<00:01:29.680> bit<00:01:29.800> wet<00:01:30.010> from

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
now the brick is a little bit wet from

now the brick is a little bit wet from
air<00:01:30.550> thus<00:01:30.760> our<00:01:31.000> room<00:01:31.270> so<00:01:31.600> you<00:01:31.810> have<00:01:31.960> to<00:01:32.050> be

my<00:02:11.820> nuts<00:02:11.970> are<00:02:12.260> forced<00:02:13.260> skew<00:02:13.590> our<00:02:14.100> force<00:02:14.340> boards

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
my nuts are forced skew our force boards

my nuts are forced skew our force boards
male<00:02:14.790> caught<00:02:15.090> and<00:02:15.360> built<00:02:15.750> and<00:02:16.170> then<00:02:16.260> we<00:02:16.320> just

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
male caught and built and then we just

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.020 
male caught and built and then we just
need<00:02:16.500> to<00:02:16.680> do<00:02:16.770> the<00:02:16.890> same<00:02:17.070> on<00:02:17.310> the<00:02:17.460> opposite<00:02:17.790> side

that<00:02:18.600> would<00:02:19.080> be<00:02:19.170> the<00:02:19.290> force<00:02:19.560> force<00:02:20.160> two<00:02:20.340> coats

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
that would be the force force two coats
