marathon ninja and the second part would
be<00:01:03.619> lightweight<00:01:04.619> now<00:01:05.540> usually<00:01:06.540> I'd<00:01:06.659> use<00:01:06.869> cold

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
be lightweight now usually I'd use cold

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.690 
be lightweight now usually I'd use cold
blooded<00:01:07.350> I've<00:01:07.770> usko<00:01:08.040> blooded<00:01:08.340> for<00:01:08.520> team

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
blooded I've usko blooded for team

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.609 
blooded I've usko blooded for team
deathmatches<00:01:09.740> but<00:01:10.740> I<00:01:11.930> have<00:01:12.930> typically<00:01:13.380> found

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
deathmatches but I have typically found

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.060 
deathmatches but I have typically found
that<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:14.250> UAVs<00:01:14.850> there's<00:01:15.360> not<00:01:15.600> a<00:01:16.020> lot<00:01:16.530> of<00:01:16.560> UAVs

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
that the UAVs there's not a lot of UAVs

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.240 
that the UAVs there's not a lot of UAVs
going<00:01:17.460> on<00:01:17.610> anyway<00:01:18.600> so<00:01:19.110> I<00:01:19.530> might<00:01:19.740> as<00:01:19.950> well<00:01:20.009> use

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
going on anyway so I might as well use

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.760 
going on anyway so I might as well use
lightweight<00:01:20.460> to<00:01:20.670> be<00:01:20.759> a<00:01:20.790> little<00:01:20.939> bit<00:01:21.060> quicker

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
lightweight to be a little bit quicker

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:27.050 
lightweight to be a little bit quicker
and<00:01:23.750> yeah<00:01:24.750> so<00:01:25.080> sit<00:01:25.860> down<00:01:25.890> there's<00:01:26.850> a<00:01:26.909> lot<00:01:26.970> of

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
and yeah so sit down there's a lot of

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.030 
and yeah so sit down there's a lot of
close<00:01:27.270> calls<00:01:27.299> in<00:01:27.750> this<00:01:27.930> I'm<00:01:28.229> actually<00:01:28.650> cool

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040

which<00:02:05.700> i<00:02:05.850> think<00:02:05.909> is<00:02:06.090> pretty<00:02:06.240> funny<00:02:06.619> basically

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
which i think is pretty funny basically

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.290 
which i think is pretty funny basically
by<00:02:07.860> a<00:02:08.160> couple<00:02:08.429> I<00:02:08.670> would<00:02:08.910> have<00:02:09.000> been<00:02:09.090> a<00:02:09.119> couple

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
by a couple I would have been a couple

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.630 
by a couple I would have been a couple
kills<00:02:09.690> short<00:02:10.289> of<00:02:10.440> 25<00:02:10.830> before<00:02:11.760> I<00:02:11.790> won<00:02:12.030> the<00:02:12.120> match

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
kills short of 25 before I won the match

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.050 
kills short of 25 before I won the match
so<00:02:13.930> even<00:02:14.930> if<00:02:15.080> i<00:02:15.260> would<00:02:15.440> have<00:02:15.470> gone<00:02:15.849> without<00:02:16.849> a

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
so even if i would have gone without a

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:18.610 
so even if i would have gone without a
death<00:02:17.300> the<00:02:17.450> entire<00:02:17.720> rest<00:02:17.989> of<00:02:18.050> the<00:02:18.140> match<00:02:18.349> just

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
death the entire rest of the match just

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.490 
death the entire rest of the match just
I<00:02:18.830> want<00:02:18.860> to<00:02:19.069> be<00:02:19.129> able<00:02:19.190> to<00:02:19.340> cut<00:02:19.459> some<00:02:19.610> nuke<00:02:19.790> and

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
I want to be able to cut some nuke and

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.229 
I want to be able to cut some nuke and
you<00:02:21.500> may<00:02:21.620> be<00:02:21.650> saying<00:02:21.890> why<00:02:22.010> don't<00:02:22.400> you<00:02:22.580> you<00:02:23.150> know

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:23.239 
you may be saying why don't you you know

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:24.850 
you may be saying why don't you you know
if<00:02:23.300> a<00:02:23.360> game<00:02:23.510> has<00:02:23.690> 18<00:02:23.989> killstreak<00:02:24.440> why<00:02:24.650> don't

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
if a game has 18 killstreak why don't

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.330 
if a game has 18 killstreak why don't
you<00:02:25.010> upload<00:02:25.370> the<00:02:25.400> whole<00:02:25.550> game<00:02:25.790> sit<00:02:26.510> down<00:02:27.340> the

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
you upload the whole game sit down the

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.610 
you upload the whole game sit down the
reason<00:02:28.670> being<00:02:28.700> is<00:02:29.060> because<00:02:29.090> the<00:02:29.900> game<00:02:30.110> I<00:02:30.379> ended

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
reason being is because the game I ended

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.150 
reason being is because the game I ended
up<00:02:30.709> game<00:02:30.920> 39<00:02:31.430> not<00:02:31.730> a<00:02:31.760> great<00:02:31.970> kdr<00:02:32.450> and<00:02:33.440> I<00:02:33.980> tried

had<00:02:58.370> had<00:02:59.120> I<00:02:59.239> know<00:02:59.750> if<00:02:59.930> someone<00:03:00.290> had<00:03:00.470> a

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
had had I know if someone had a

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:01.420 
had had I know if someone had a
heartbeat<00:03:00.739> sensor<00:03:00.890> wouldn't<00:03:01.220> matter<00:03:01.310> because

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
heartbeat sensor wouldn't matter because

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:06.900 
heartbeat sensor wouldn't matter because
I<00:03:01.579> ninja<00:03:01.940> pro<00:03:02.090> on<00:03:02.980> and<00:03:04.329> anybody<00:03:05.329> can<00:03:05.629> do<00:03:05.780> this

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
I ninja pro on and anybody can do this

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.530 
I ninja pro on and anybody can do this
because<00:03:07.910> literally<00:03:08.299> the<00:03:08.540> class<00:03:08.720> i'm<00:03:08.930> using<00:03:09.349> is

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
because literally the class i'm using is

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.520 
because literally the class i'm using is
that's<00:03:11.540> where<00:03:11.660> I<00:03:11.690> get<00:03:11.780> the<00:03:11.810> EMP<00:03:12.140> the<00:03:12.260> class<00:03:12.410> i'm

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
that's where I get the EMP the class i'm

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:15.400 
that's where I get the EMP the class i'm
using<00:03:12.739> is<00:03:12.829> literally<00:03:13.069> the<00:03:13.239> Recon<00:03:14.239> class<00:03:14.510> i'm

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
using is literally the Recon class i'm

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:17.800 
using is literally the Recon class i'm
not<00:03:15.620> using<00:03:15.860> the<00:03:16.040> Recon<00:03:16.310> class<00:03:16.489> but<00:03:16.730> it<00:03:16.850> has

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810 
not using the Recon class but it has

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.610 
not using the Recon class but it has
virtually<00:03:18.260> identical<00:03:18.350> to<00:03:18.769> the<00:03:18.859> recog<00:03:19.160> class

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
virtually identical to the recog class

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:26.140 
virtually identical to the recog class
yeah<00:03:22.720> so<00:03:24.069> I'm<00:03:25.069> running<00:03:25.370> around<00:03:25.430> get<00:03:26.000> them

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
yeah so I'm running around get them

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.199 
yeah so I'm running around get them
getting<00:03:26.389> them<00:03:26.480> getting<00:03:26.720> them<00:03:27.400> EMP<00:03:28.400> I<00:03:28.670> figure

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
getting them getting them EMP I figure

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:31.150 
getting them getting them EMP I figure
that<00:03:29.510> the<00:03:29.660> EMP<00:03:30.079> is<00:03:30.349> probably<00:03:30.829> one<00:03:31.010> of<00:03:31.040> the

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.160 
that the EMP is probably one of the

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.789 
that the EMP is probably one of the
better<00:03:31.510> better<00:03:32.510> second<00:03:33.139> perks<00:03:33.380> that<00:03:33.530> I<00:03:33.620> could

00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:33.799 
better better second perks that I could

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:36.990 
better better second perks that I could
have<00:03:34.299> just<00:03:35.299> because<00:03:35.599> the<00:03:35.720> enemy<00:03:36.079> is<00:03:36.380> going<00:03:36.769> to

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
have just because the enemy is going to

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.360 
have just because the enemy is going to
have<00:03:38.000> no<00:03:38.299> use<00:03:38.540> of<00:03:38.720> red<00:03:38.900> or<00:03:39.049> anything<00:03:39.079> so<00:03:39.859> I'm

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.370 
have no use of red or anything so I'm

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:42.460 
have no use of red or anything so I'm
not<00:03:40.549> going<00:03:40.700> to<00:03:40.760> have<00:03:40.970> any<00:03:41.480> issue<00:03:41.870> of<00:03:42.230> being

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:42.470 
not going to have any issue of being

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:44.920 
not going to have any issue of being
spotted<00:03:42.859> and<00:03:43.250> so<00:03:43.970> hopefully<00:03:44.450> in<00:03:44.569> the<00:03:44.599> EMP

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 
spotted and so hopefully in the EMP

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:46.690 
spotted and so hopefully in the EMP
actually<00:03:45.200> lasts<00:03:45.380> for<00:03:45.560> a<00:03:45.620> really<00:03:45.829> long<00:03:45.859> time<00:03:46.010> so

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:46.700 
actually lasts for a really long time so

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.539 
actually lasts for a really long time so
my<00:03:47.480> thought<00:03:47.810> processes<00:03:48.290> on<00:03:48.590> it<00:03:48.919> is<00:03:49.099> that<00:03:49.430> if<00:03:49.489> I

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:49.549 
my thought processes on it is that if I

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:51.970 
my thought processes on it is that if I
put<00:03:49.730> up<00:03:49.819> EMP<00:03:50.209> I'm<00:03:50.389> at<00:03:50.510> 15<00:03:50.900> kills<00:03:51.169> and<00:03:51.620> I<00:03:51.680> should

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:51.980 
put up EMP I'm at 15 kills and I should

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:56.349 
put up EMP I'm at 15 kills and I should
be<00:03:52.010> able<00:03:52.250> to<00:03:52.400> get<00:03:52.519> 10<00:03:52.819> kills<00:03:53.950> after<00:03:54.950> that<00:03:55.359> with

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:56.359 
be able to get 10 kills after that with

00:03:56.359 --> 00:03:58.750 
be able to get 10 kills after that with
the<00:03:56.569> enemy's<00:03:57.079> electronics<00:03:57.980> down<00:03:58.130> and<00:03:58.459> that's

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760 
the enemy's electronics down and that's

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.670 
the enemy's electronics down and that's
