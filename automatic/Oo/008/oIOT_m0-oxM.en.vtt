using it in a cosmetic way to rejuvenate
skin<00:00:55.559> so<00:00:56.430> to<00:00:57.000> explain<00:00:57.300> platelets<00:00:57.780> are<00:00:57.870> part<00:00:58.170> of

skin so to explain platelets are part of
the<00:00:58.350> blood<00:00:58.559> and<00:00:58.770> you<00:00:59.340> take<00:00:59.579> those<00:00:59.730> platelets

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
the blood and you take those platelets

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.299 
the blood and you take those platelets
and<00:01:00.359> you<00:01:00.510> mix<00:01:00.719> it<00:01:00.809> with<00:01:00.930> other<00:01:01.109> things<00:01:01.469> no<00:01:02.129> I

the platelets off the platelets have
cytokines<00:01:08.220> in<00:01:08.369> them<00:01:08.520> that<00:01:09.180> our<00:01:09.600> growth

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
cytokines in them that our growth

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.320 
cytokines in them that our growth
factors<00:01:10.409> and<00:01:10.619> they<00:01:10.979> stimulate<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:11.640> stem

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
factors and they stimulate the stem

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.870

skin it rejuvenates it does it make it

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.700 
skin it rejuvenates it does it make it
puffier<00:01:24.030> and<00:01:24.299> better<00:01:24.780> looking<00:01:25.020> or<00:01:25.409> do<00:01:25.619> you

we use some of the pillars is to give
you<00:01:30.509> some<00:01:30.689> volume<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.710> volume<00:01:31.740> doesn't<00:01:32.400> come

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
you some volume the volume doesn't come

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.030 
you some volume the volume doesn't come
from<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:32.850> PRP<00:01:33.150> what<00:01:33.720> you<00:01:34.229> get<00:01:34.439> from<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.710> PRP

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
from the PRP what you get from the PRP

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.319 
from the PRP what you get from the PRP
is<00:01:36.350> texture<00:01:37.350> changes<00:01:37.799> and<00:01:38.100> color<00:01:38.729> changes<00:01:39.210> so
