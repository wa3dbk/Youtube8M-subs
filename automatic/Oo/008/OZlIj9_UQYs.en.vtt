00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
actually perfect for all that except for

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.460 
actually perfect for all that except for
its<00:02:37.100> compact<00:02:37.580> it<00:02:38.420> fits<00:02:38.690> nice<00:02:38.870> and<00:02:38.900> comfortably

ergonomics on this are actually pretty

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.790 
ergonomics on this are actually pretty
decent<00:02:43.610> for<00:02:44.239> thinking<00:02:44.989> this<00:02:45.050> as<00:02:45.200> heavy<00:02:45.410> as<00:02:45.590> it

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:45.800 
decent for thinking this as heavy as it

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.760 
decent for thinking this as heavy as it
says<00:02:46.010> but<00:02:46.970> it's<00:02:47.090> a<00:02:47.209> really<00:02:47.870> heavy<00:02:48.110> knife<00:02:48.410> this

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:48.770 
says but it's a really heavy knife this

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:53.470 
says but it's a really heavy knife this
is<00:02:48.950> probably<00:02:49.250> about<00:02:49.930> I'd<00:02:50.930> have<00:02:51.110> to<00:02:51.230> say<00:02:52.480> let's

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
is probably about I'd have to say let's

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.229 
is probably about I'd have to say let's
see<00:02:53.840> three<00:02:54.530> number<00:02:54.950> like<00:02:55.190> seven<00:02:55.880> ounces

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:56.239 
see three number like seven ounces

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:58.660 
see three number like seven ounces
something<00:02:56.780> like<00:02:56.870> that<00:02:57.080> and<00:02:57.980> it<00:02:58.130> is<00:02:58.280> really

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
something like that and it is really

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:59.080 
something like that and it is really
heavy

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
heavy

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:01.870 
heavy
that's<00:02:59.480> the<00:02:59.690> only<00:02:59.870> downside<00:03:00.380> of<00:03:00.410> this<00:03:00.880> but

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880 
that's the only downside of this but

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.060 
that's the only downside of this but
pocket<00:03:02.600> clip<00:03:02.750> works<00:03:03.050> absolutely<00:03:03.350> perfect

just<00:03:04.280> the<00:03:04.730> right<00:03:04.850> amount<00:03:05.090> of<00:03:05.180> tension<00:03:05.360> but<00:03:05.900> not

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080 
just the right amount of tension but not

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.509 
just the right amount of tension but not
too<00:03:06.260> much<00:03:06.410> so<00:03:06.590> we<00:03:06.709> can't<00:03:06.950> pull<00:03:07.190> it<00:03:07.220> out<00:03:07.340> of<00:03:07.370> your

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:07.519 
too much so we can't pull it out of your

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:11.380 
too much so we can't pull it out of your
pocket<00:03:07.670> easily<00:03:08.410> but<00:03:09.410> uh<00:03:09.880> yeah<00:03:10.880> this<00:03:11.060> is<00:03:11.209> my
