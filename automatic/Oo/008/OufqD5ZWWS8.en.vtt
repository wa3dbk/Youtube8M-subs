00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:14.370
 hello how about youtube friends good today 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.640
 I come with a new versus on demand 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:20.010
 these two subscribers me being sincere 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.050
 with you this versus is very controversial 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.029
 since these beings proved to be very 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.980
 powerful and dominating in the field of 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.290
 battle in addition to its power is very 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.540
 overwhelming capable of destroying universes 

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:33.210
 good this confrontation will be between 

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:35.640
 bills the god of destruction versus 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.070
 omegas enron or as everyone calls it 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.550
 a star dragon with nothing but 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.550
 tell 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:44.700
 Let's start bills the god of the 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.800
 destruction good so far I do not know 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.140
 knows exactly the maximum power of 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.150
 this villain although he has already proved to be 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.760
 much stronger than gotti in state 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:55.650
 super sayayin god i would dare to 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.290
 say that bills is superior to sparrow 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:01.170
 super saiyan god super saiyans and a lot 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:03.090
 More powerful than golden freezer bills is 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.519
 able to split a planet in half 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.030
 very easily destroy a system 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.920
 solar or even a galaxy 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.600
 now bills has proven to be very 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.430
 superior to all the rivals that has 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.380
 had and have a potential almost 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:18.470
 infinite since this one is in 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:21.470
 another dimension completely or mega without 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:23.509
 role this character created by the 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:26.210
 evil spheres is one of the most 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:29.000
 strong of dragon ball gt a star 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:31.070
 proved to be very powerful because he kept 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.740
 a very easy fight against goku and vegeta 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.630
 in super saiyan 4 besides having 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.030
 variety of very useful techniques and 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.160
 devastating and without counting that their 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.740
 destruction capacity is very high 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:45.140
 since or mega without role can destroy a 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:48.050
 galaxy alone with the negative energy that 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.729
 ejected from his body he also stressed that 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:51.440
 he himself proclaimed himself god of the 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:54.229
 destruction by the power that there was 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:56.990
 reached but in this fight who 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:59.300
 would really win this battle really 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.340
 It would be very brutal destroying planets 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:03.470
 very easily but to know who 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:06.470
 would win in this versus we will take 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:08.840
 reference to gotti a super saiyan 4 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:11.630
 as we all know goku in super 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:14.690
 Indian saiyan is superior to 1 q in super 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:17.780
 sayayin 4 now a star had 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:19.550
 superiority with 1 q super saiyan 4 but 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.560
 the thing got a little more complicated 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:24.470
 when he received the power of all 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.540
 his friends or we could say that one 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:29.450
 q in super saiyan 4 full power 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:32.180
 would defeat a star and as we saw 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:35.120
 goku in god state he could not even 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:37.250
 give a decent fight to bills is more the 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:41.090
 same bills says that he is not worthy rival 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:44.300
 of recognizing that its latent ability 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:48.550
 it's pretty impressive but I do not 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:48.550
 I would say it is a rival worthy of me 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:54.069
 making it clear that goku in state 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:56.590
 God is far below him is more 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:59.080
 now that goku reached the super sayayin 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:02.170
 super god sayayin did not even reach 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:04.209
 the power of bills for that reason I think 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.910
 that the winner of this battle would be 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:09.250
 bis since although omegas enron has 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:11.260
 very useful skills alone is strength 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:12.280
 gross and has no knowledge of 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.709
 fighting techniques 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:17.410
 instead bills has very technical 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:20.019
 advanced and from another level apart from that 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:21.989
 bills if you use your 100% power would win 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:25.239
 very easily to this villain 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:28.090
 then to this versus I would give it 60% 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:31.000
 of 40% giving as a winner to bills the 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:33.069
 god of destruction and good friends if 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.440
