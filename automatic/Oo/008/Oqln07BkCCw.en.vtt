00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:17.670
 a fire car a fire horse in a 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:20.039
 whirlwind what would be exactly these 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:24.050
 three elements in the biblical history of 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.050
 Rapture of the prophet Elijah 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:37.769
 here are some curious passages in the 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:40.350
 life of the prophet ancient UFOs 

00:00:37.769 --> 00:00:43.219
 the rapture of the prophet Elijah and 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.219
 other mysteries 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:50.140
 according to the second book of the kings 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:53.590
 of the Bible Elijah was a prophet in the kingdom 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:56.290
 of Samara during the reign of the cable 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:59.770
 19th century before Christ 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:05.710
 he was a defender of the cult of iavé against 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:08.920
 worship God ba bible says that 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:11.350
 he was with Eliseu when a car of 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:14.680
 fire a fire horse 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:17.160
 separated from one another and elias ascended to heaven 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.160
 in a whirlpool 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:23.410
 Elisha was the one who stayed in his place in the 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:27.460
 the conduct of the Israeli people and 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:30.460
 witnessed him and another 50 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:33.400
 men went after them on heaps of 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:37.090
 several for three days without success 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:40.430
 they were never found 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:43.850
 but before that when elias was in the 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:46.550
 fight against the cult of baal to houses network 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:49.340
 Israel at that time sent three 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:51.890
 groups of soldiers to arrest him 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:54.380
 the first two are destroyed with 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:57.290
 fire he calls them from heaven 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:02:00.500
 the third party is spared due to the 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:03.440
 mercy of its leader 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:06.860
 a curious fact occurred a little before 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:09.429
 the redemunho when he took Elias 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:13.280
 Elisha approached the Jordan River 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:15.890
 Elias curled his mantle and struck the water and 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:19.400
 divided and the two crossed in 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:23.080
 dry land like elias separated the waters 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.080
 of a river with its mantle 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.230
 to be taken by the whirlwind his robe 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.930
 dropped down 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:34.280
 Elisha picked up and managed to 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:37.160
 even though they are on the river jordan are 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:40.430
 passages of this nature and are used 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:42.709
 by fires as evidence of the presence in the 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:45.470
 extraterrestrials in the bible 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:47.709
 one of the questions of ufologists is 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:50.330
 with respect to the meaning of the word 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:53.930
 sky 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:56.300
 the argument is that the word heaven in 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.220
 original texts may have three 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:01.870
 meanings 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.870
 the first is the sky the atmosphere 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:09.980
 the second space 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:12.860
 and the third is the abode of God 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:15.470
 in the case of elias some say that the 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:18.260
 translation may indicate that it has been 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:21.350
 to the atmospheric sky and others that 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:23.920
 sky word means space but not the 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:23.920
 Paradise 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:29.230
 another mystery that surrounds 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:32.080
 rapture of elias is that according to 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:35.680
 with the biblical story he would have been 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:37.330
 heaven to heaven without going through the 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.180
 death 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:43.180
 the prophet malachi of if wanted would be 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:46.870
 sent before the coming of the great and 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:48.640
 terrible day of the Lord, that is, that Elijah 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:51.790
 will come back 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:54.490
 some years after they were taken 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:56.800
 king of July or did not receive a 

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:59.260
 a letter from guides that moody's 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:00.580
 hram for not following the path of 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.770
 Mr 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:05.950
 however this fact is still very 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:08.860
 contended that the text did not 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:11.770
 referring to the prophet Elias and others that there 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:14.440
 an error in the chronology of the facts and this 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:18.580
 may have occurred before it was 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:19.989
 brought about by redemption between 

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:21.700
 other passages 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:24.520
 Elias still looks like an episode 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:29.890
 of the New Testament 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:33.070
 the transfiguration of jesus the text says 

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:37.090
 that Jesus gave Peter back and his 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:39.640
 Brother joão to a lot there jesus se 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:42.670
 transfigured before them and your 

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:46.270
 Your contest responds as the sun and its 

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:48.690
 robes became white a light 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:51.820
 It was then that Moses appeared and elias 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:54.970
 Talking to him 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:58.630
 Peter was speaking to Jesus until 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:05:01.960
 appeared in the luminous cloud that covered them and 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:04.680
 From the cloud came out a voice that said this is the 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:06.490
 My beloved son, in which I am well pleased. 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:09.250
 to listen to you 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:11.860
 on hearing this the disciples were left 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:14.970
 with me and jesus asked to be 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:17.260
 get up and not be afraid 

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:21.130
 when they looked again 

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:25.330
 Moses in the process and the cloud had disappeared only 

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:28.120
 was Jesus with the disciples then 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:31.000
 they asked Jesus why the scribes 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:33.970
 They say that Elijah must come first. 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:37.930
 and jesus said he wanted to turn first 

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:41.500
 and restore to all things but in the 

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:44.170
 Truth they have come and done with it 

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:45.670
 everything they wanted as they would with the 

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:48.580
 son of the man 

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:52.120
 the disciples understood that Jesus 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:54.670
 I was talking about joao batista 

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:56.860
 many theories and hypotheses have been 

00:05:54.670 --> 00:06:00.370
 raised about the stories 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:02.980
 involving the prophet Elijah, but the 

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:05.980
 own biblical text leaves no doubts 

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:09.090
 that something different happened in the 

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:09.090
 day of his relegation 

00:06:09.729 --> 00:06:16.210
 and it so happened that by walking and 

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:19.779
 talking about what a fire car a 

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:24.129
 the fire horse separated them from each other and 

00:06:19.779 --> 00:06:29.580
 Elijah went up to heaven in the second redemption 

00:06:24.129 --> 00:06:29.580
