now since they don't make it and it is a

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:24.050 
now since they don't make it and it is a
limited<00:05:21.930> edition<00:05:22.050> so<00:05:22.520> you<00:05:23.520> might<00:05:23.700> be<00:05:23.730> able<00:05:23.940> to

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:24.060

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:26.700 
find it online like I said but it won't

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:32.030 
find it online like I said but it won't
be<00:05:26.910> the<00:05:27.660> price<00:05:28.290> it<00:05:28.620> used<00:05:28.830> to<00:05:28.980> be<00:05:29.160> and<00:05:31.040> this

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:32.040 
be the price it used to be and this

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:38.000 
be the price it used to be and this
little<00:05:33.030> car<00:05:34.760> the<00:05:35.760> cruise<00:05:36.120> board<00:05:36.680> boot<00:05:37.680> and

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:38.010 
little car the cruise board boot and

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:44.450 
little car the cruise board boot and
watch<00:05:39.530> available<00:05:40.530> in<00:05:41.130> limited<00:05:41.520> quantities<00:05:43.460> so

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:44.460 
watch available in limited quantities so

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:48.879 
watch available in limited quantities so
I<00:05:45.180> guess<00:05:45.570> this<00:05:46.290> is<00:05:46.500> a<00:05:46.530> cruise<00:05:46.919> board<00:05:47.270> the<00:05:48.270> boot

00:05:48.879 --> 00:05:48.889 
I guess this is a cruise board the boot

00:05:48.889 --> 00:05:52.360 
I guess this is a cruise board the boot
and<00:05:48.979> the<00:05:49.400> watch<00:05:49.780> they<00:05:50.780> used<00:05:50.990> to<00:05:51.169> sell<00:05:51.469> this<00:05:51.500> all

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:52.370 
and the watch they used to sell this all

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:54.909 
and the watch they used to sell this all
together<00:05:53.169> they<00:05:54.169> don't<00:05:54.349> have<00:05:54.530> it<00:05:54.680> anymore

00:05:54.909 --> 00:05:54.919
