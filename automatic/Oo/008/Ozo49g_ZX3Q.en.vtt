00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.680
 hello everyone fast with you today i would 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.520
 I wanted to show such a mechanism as 

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:07.890
 semi-automatic wheat farm in 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.620
 minecraft that is semi-automatic 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:13.860
 this farm because you have to plant 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.560
 hands but just the same you can collect 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.680
 will be using this mechanism 

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:23.699
 the design is quite simple that is 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:27.859
 pistons repeaters redstone and one lever 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:33.840
 it is very easy to flow water here that is 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:36.590
 that's how it looks like water flows there 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:43.020
 there is to 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:45.629
 once the wheat grew its account yes yes yes well 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:52.560
 and in principle how it works still 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:57.840
 It is just a hopper and put it in, that is, we 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:01:01.500
 at the time, well, first we close these 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.949
 but tell the holes where the water flows from then 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:10.440
 push the lever 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:13.560
 water from the pistons fully collect and even 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:18.350
 and then forgot about the nail can not close 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.350
 there is just a lot of water 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:28.950
 she will flow where she wants in Latin is important 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:32.330
 Well, wait until the whole drains 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.330
 wheat all resources 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.950
 basically rain 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:42.880
 now here we see that 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:45.400
 Nothing gets us there not, in principle, 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:48.490
 it should have been because now 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:52.450
 we close the pistons that is water from 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:54.100
 pistons close open no yet 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:59.310
 open you need to wait until it flows 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:02:02.020
 water can be small bugs 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:05.440
 swiss gets here but principle 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.950
 you can just remove them like this 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.979
 in a way 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:13.350
 Although there is no cleaning I can not I just send 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:18.630
 you can not clean up so here we open 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:23.430
 there will be 4s where the water flows and see how 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:26.250
 all resources resources flow hopper out 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:29.670
 hopper directly already they drain 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:32.090
 the trunk of this mechanism of course could 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.560
 would be perfect but somehow lazy 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.100
 Well, in principle, and all I wanted 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.080
 to show 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.060
 with you was fas leave comments 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:42.390
 subscribe to the channel put likes and 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:44.850
 see you in the new series of mechanisms 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:47.600
 reviews of mechanisms with a review of mods yes to all 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.600
 good luck everyone bye
