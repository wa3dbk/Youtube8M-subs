00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 alaaf and hello get my love too 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:08.099
 Show a new video of me today 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:10.650
 I'll give you a last minute costume for you 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.780
 children you can of course vary 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.820
 I have a little ladybug out 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:18.890
 empty and I'll show you now 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.890
 connection what you need everything for it 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:25.050
 you need one first 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.599
 rubber band in my case it was a 50 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.210
 cm long in black you can of course 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.700
 also take thinner or which in 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.190
 White 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:36.780
 then you need her needle and thread her 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:41.250
 but it can also be with a sewing machine 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:43.590
 of course, make a scissors and you 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.890
 I need one meter of tulle each 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.899
 now have a meter of red and a 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.329
 meter of black tulle taken 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.789
 if you want to make a little bee 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.070
 just swap the red one with one 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.609
 yellow out then there was one more 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:02.129
 small hairband with a happy turn 

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:08.970
 and a black basic top from h &amp; m 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:10.590
 44 eur 99 so we set off as all 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.229
 first of course you have the scope 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.490
 measure your child 50 centimeters 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.619
 are a little big 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.020
 that's why I let it overlap a bit 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:22.560
 so that is a bit more stable and 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:25.500
 Nearby is with several stitches around 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:28.680
 Once you have it firmly 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.780
 did you do then please have a look to 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.990
 if everything is really really stable 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:36.509
 is and then you can already with 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.570
 start cutting the pieces 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:42.170
 I now have 10 cm wide pieces 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.170
 took 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:56.690
 that makes even the best of all 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:59.480
 garbage you have and afterwards because that 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:01.430
 Pieces are a bit too long like 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:03.440
 I can see every one here 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:06.530
 just in the middle once together 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:08.450
 placed and then cut through 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.130
 you have the optimal length but that 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.630
 you have to measure out before 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.360
 I have the Investigator on it 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:16.100
 kept and so you have to not look 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.260
 that the children then over the potty 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.160
 fall over it 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:22.100
 of course that would have to be with the 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:25.220
 make black fabric or or with the 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:28.730
 other color still at home I have 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:30.380
 I took more red than black then 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.940
 I have this stage to help me 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.940
 taken with it the rubber band 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:37.760
 is a bit punished and then I have that 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:41.210
 I then have this fabric in the band 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:44.000
 centered and then a bend 

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:46.340
 and then just the rest 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:50.090
 pulled by it as the pieces 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:52.010
 So you can really see here totally 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.290
 easy and you really need it 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:57.410
 Not much time for that has ten minutes 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:03:00.050
 It took a while to finish it 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:02.780
 Bit tight and set it up like this 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:06.770
 bit and then it makes it easy 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:08.840
 once around and it fills well too 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:10.370
 Here I always have a red and 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.080
 taken a black because it is easy 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:15.200
 So you can always go faster 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:17.090
 take two pieces at a time and so is 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:20.860
 the color pattern definitely something nice 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.860
 as if that makes you all alone 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:36.250
 so now I have remaining red 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.420
 pieces simply distributed in-between 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.790
 because that's a bit too much for me 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:42.879
 was black like now just around 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:44.769
 fumbled a bit red again 

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:47.530
 so that is just a bit more red 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:50.049
 as black and in the end you have to 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:51.519
 look if your leftovers are easy 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:54.129
 cuts off like I do here now 

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:55.780
 that did not have to be accurate 

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:58.239
 that looks really cute if one 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:00.400
 is a bit torn and I have 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:02.319
 Once around, I've done everything 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.970
 the length I like to do today 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:06.129
 and now we're done 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:07.810
 Hope you liked the little video 

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:10.090
 I wish you a lot of fun 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:12.750
 mimic and merry carnival days 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:12.750
 take care
