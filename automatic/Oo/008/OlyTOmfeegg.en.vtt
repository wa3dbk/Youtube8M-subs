00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
on you

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.210 
on you
you<00:03:51.690> have<00:03:51.900> to<00:03:52.050> understand<00:03:52.590> and<00:03:52.890> internalize

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
you have to understand and internalize

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.060 
you have to understand and internalize
and<00:03:53.880> apply<00:03:54.330> what<00:03:55.080> I'm<00:03:55.320> going<00:03:55.680> to<00:03:55.710> teach<00:03:56.010> you

00:03:59.380 --> 00:03:59.390 
and if you do this you will get results

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:02.590 
and if you do this you will get results
not<00:04:00.390> only<00:04:00.690> will<00:04:00.840> you<00:04:00.960> get<00:04:01.170> results<00:04:01.530> you'll

own athletic destiny so my what I really

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:14.870 
own athletic destiny so my what I really
want<00:04:11.370> to<00:04:11.459> do<00:04:11.610> is<00:04:11.910> put<00:04:12.180> you<00:04:12.630> in<00:04:12.900> charge<00:04:13.670> so<00:04:14.670> guys

want to do is put you in charge so guys
if<00:04:15.060> you've<00:04:15.180> owned<00:04:15.660> off<00:04:15.840> from<00:04:16.109> my<00:04:16.200> little<00:04:16.350> story

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
if you've owned off from my little story

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:21.349 
if you've owned off from my little story
dial<00:04:17.640> back<00:04:17.850> in<00:04:18.150> right<00:04:18.359> now<00:04:18.570> so<00:04:19.560> I've<00:04:20.250> told<00:04:21.150> you

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 
dial back in right now so I've told you

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:23.270 
dial back in right now so I've told you
already<00:04:21.510> that<00:04:21.750> you<00:04:21.930> need<00:04:22.140> strength<00:04:22.860> and

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
already that you need strength and

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:24.260 
already that you need strength and
quickness

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
quickness

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:27.490 
quickness
to<00:04:24.720> become<00:04:24.870> explosive<00:04:25.410> and<00:04:25.860> it's<00:04:26.610> more<00:04:26.970> about

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:27.500 
to become explosive and it's more about

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.750 
to become explosive and it's more about
how<00:04:28.040> you<00:04:28.100> do<00:04:28.760> it<00:04:28.940> then<00:04:29.720> what<00:04:29.990> you<00:04:30.230> do<00:04:30.760> so

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:31.760 
how you do it then what you do so

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:34.330 
how you do it then what you do so
increasing<00:04:32.330> strength<00:04:32.780> is<00:04:33.080> really<00:04:33.680> all<00:04:34.010> about

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
increasing strength is really all about

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:37.080 
increasing strength is really all about
tension<00:04:35.210> and<00:04:35.660> high<00:04:36.050> resistance<00:04:36.710> and

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.090 
tension and high resistance and

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:40.090 
tension and high resistance and
increasing<00:04:38.090> quickness<00:04:38.390> is<00:04:38.840> more<00:04:39.680> about<00:04:39.890> your

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:40.100 
increasing quickness is more about your

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:43.390 
increasing quickness is more about your
nervous<00:04:40.700> system<00:04:41.300> activation<00:04:42.160> let<00:04:43.160> me<00:04:43.220> tell

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.400 
nervous system activation let me tell

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.900 
nervous system activation let me tell
you<00:04:43.520> a<00:04:43.550> fact<00:04:44.110> joint<00:04:45.110> angles<00:04:45.770> matter<00:04:46.430> when

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:46.910 
you a fact joint angles matter when

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:48.820 
you a fact joint angles matter when
you're<00:04:47.090> training<00:04:47.390> look<00:04:48.260> at<00:04:48.350> this<00:04:48.440> picture<00:04:48.800> of

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:48.830 
you're training look at this picture of

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:51.940 
you're training look at this picture of
me<00:04:49.100> on<00:04:49.310> the<00:04:49.490> left<00:04:50.050> this<00:04:51.050> is<00:04:51.230> the<00:04:51.380> second<00:04:51.770> time<00:04:51.920> I

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:51.950 
me on the left this is the second time I

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:54.190 
me on the left this is the second time I
did<00:04:52.100> my<00:04:52.370> program<00:04:52.850> I<00:04:53.030> was<00:04:53.180> in<00:04:53.210> my<00:04:53.480> 30s<00:04:53.960> already

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:54.200 
did my program I was in my 30s already

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:57.280 
did my program I was in my 30s already
and<00:04:54.650> I<00:04:55.130> trained<00:04:55.550> this<00:04:55.760> exact<00:04:56.330> joint<00:04:56.840> angle<00:04:57.170> and

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:57.290 
and I trained this exact joint angle and

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:59.290 
and I trained this exact joint angle and
I<00:04:57.350> got<00:04:57.530> results<00:04:57.710> even<00:04:58.250> faster<00:04:58.850> than<00:04:58.880> I<00:04:59.120> when<00:04:59.270> I

00:04:59.290 --> 00:04:59.300 
I got results even faster than I when I

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.540 
I got results even faster than I when I
originally<00:04:59.840> did<00:04:59.990> with<00:05:00.110> my<00:05:00.350> program<00:05:00.890> so

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:01.550 
originally did with my program so

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:04.330 
originally did with my program so
lifting<00:05:02.150> or<00:05:02.419> doing<00:05:02.780> jumping<00:05:03.590> or<00:05:03.740> plyometric

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:04.340 
lifting or doing jumping or plyometric

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:07.390 
lifting or doing jumping or plyometric
practice<00:05:04.820> you've<00:05:05.510> got<00:05:05.870> to<00:05:06.110> use<00:05:06.440> the<00:05:06.980> same

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:07.400 
practice you've got to use the same

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.480 
practice you've got to use the same
joint<00:05:08.060> angles<00:05:08.540> as<00:05:08.780> your<00:05:09.350> sports<00:05:09.800> specific

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:10.490 
joint angles as your sports specific

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:13.510 
joint angles as your sports specific
movement<00:05:11.030> so<00:05:11.870> your<00:05:12.140> rule<00:05:12.410> number<00:05:12.710> four<00:05:13.250> for

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:13.520 
movement so your rule number four for

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:17.380 
movement so your rule number four for
training<00:05:14.260> always<00:05:15.260> train<00:05:15.830> sports<00:05:16.669> specific

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:17.390 
training always train sports specific

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:20.080 
training always train sports specific
joint<00:05:17.810> angles<00:05:18.200> and<00:05:18.410> this<00:05:19.070> applies<00:05:19.460> to<00:05:19.490> the<00:05:19.880> two

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:20.090 
joint angles and this applies to the two

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:22.600 
joint angles and this applies to the two
exercises<00:05:20.450> I<00:05:21.110> gave<00:05:21.350> you<00:05:21.560> back<00:05:21.740> in<00:05:21.950> video<00:05:22.250> one

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:22.610 
exercises I gave you back in video one

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:26.710 
exercises I gave you back in video one
if<00:05:22.880> you<00:05:23.270> remember<00:05:23.720> so<00:05:25.000> for<00:05:26.000> my<00:05:26.150> athletes<00:05:26.540> what

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:26.720 
if you remember so for my athletes what

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:29.560 
if you remember so for my athletes what
I<00:05:26.750> do<00:05:26.870> is<00:05:27.200> I<00:05:27.800> take<00:05:28.010> a<00:05:28.070> video<00:05:28.430> and<00:05:28.730> I<00:05:28.790> pause<00:05:29.150> it<00:05:29.419> at

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:29.570 
I do is I take a video and I pause it at

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:31.630 
I do is I take a video and I pause it at
the<00:05:29.810> exact<00:05:30.350> joint<00:05:30.919> angles<00:05:31.280> that<00:05:31.430> they're

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:31.640 
the exact joint angles that they're

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:34.000 
the exact joint angles that they're
using<00:05:32.030> when<00:05:32.570> they<00:05:32.630> start<00:05:33.260> their<00:05:33.560> vertical

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:34.010 
using when they start their vertical

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:37.719 
using when they start their vertical
leap<00:05:34.240> so<00:05:35.240> if<00:05:35.540> you<00:05:36.050> train<00:05:36.470> or<00:05:36.800> squat<00:05:37.310> in<00:05:37.580> a

00:05:37.719 --> 00:05:37.729 
leap so if you train or squat in a

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:40.659 
leap so if you train or squat in a
different<00:05:38.240> joint<00:05:38.540> angle<00:05:38.900> it's<00:05:39.890> just<00:05:40.370> not

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:40.669 
different joint angle it's just not

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:43.090 
different joint angle it's just not
going<00:05:41.060> to<00:05:41.270> work<00:05:41.540> so<00:05:42.200> look<00:05:42.410> at<00:05:42.500> the<00:05:42.650> two<00:05:42.830> joint

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:43.100 
going to work so look at the two joint

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:46.450 
going to work so look at the two joint
angles<00:05:43.400> here<00:05:44.560> you<00:05:45.560> don't<00:05:45.740> want<00:05:45.860> to<00:05:45.919> lift<00:05:46.190> like

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:46.460 
angles here you don't want to lift like

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:47.350 
angles here you don't want to lift like
a<00:05:46.490> powerlifter

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:47.360 
a powerlifter

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:49.690 
a powerlifter
you<00:05:48.080> want<00:05:48.290> to<00:05:48.350> lift<00:05:48.590> to<00:05:48.770> strengthen<00:05:49.430> your

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:49.700 
you want to lift to strengthen your

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:52.060 
you want to lift to strengthen your
jumping<00:05:50.210> muscles<00:05:50.630> or<00:05:51.050> your<00:05:51.410> strength<00:05:51.740> and

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:52.070 
jumping muscles or your strength and

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:53.800 
jumping muscles or your strength and
activation<00:05:52.700> pattern<00:05:53.060> will<00:05:53.210> simply<00:05:53.570> not

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:53.810 
activation pattern will simply not

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:56.520 
activation pattern will simply not
transfer<00:05:54.710> to<00:05:55.160> the<00:05:55.310> movement<00:05:55.760> you<00:05:55.880> want<00:05:56.030> it<00:05:56.210> to

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:56.530 
transfer to the movement you want it to

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:59.800 
transfer to the movement you want it to
you<00:05:57.530> be<00:05:57.680> training<00:05:58.070> the<00:05:58.280> strength<00:05:58.729> in<00:05:59.030> the

00:05:59.800 --> 00:05:59.810 
you be training the strength in the

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:00.850 
you be training the strength in the
wrong<00:06:00.110> places

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:00.860 
wrong places

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:03.610 
wrong places
so<00:06:01.610> I've<00:06:01.760> seen<00:06:01.970> guys<00:06:02.150> train<00:06:02.600> powerlifting<00:06:03.440> and

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:03.620 
so I've seen guys train powerlifting and

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:06.520 
so I've seen guys train powerlifting and
get<00:06:03.770> super<00:06:04.610> strong<00:06:04.970> and<00:06:05.660> that's<00:06:05.870> great<00:06:06.200> for

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:06.530 
get super strong and that's great for

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:08.680 
get super strong and that's great for
moving<00:06:06.680> heavy<00:06:07.010> weight<00:06:07.280> but<00:06:07.790> it's<00:06:07.910> bad<00:06:08.300> for

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:08.690 
moving heavy weight but it's bad for

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:12.310 
moving heavy weight but it's bad for
jumping<00:06:09.290> higher<00:06:09.500> so<00:06:10.840> because<00:06:11.840> they're<00:06:12.050> not

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:12.320 
jumping higher so because they're not

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:15.460 
jumping higher so because they're not
training<00:06:13.100> proper<00:06:13.700> joint<00:06:13.940> angles<00:06:14.360> it<00:06:14.570> simply

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:15.470 
training proper joint angles it simply

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:18.130 
training proper joint angles it simply
doesn't<00:06:15.710> transfer<00:06:16.400> over<00:06:16.820> so<00:06:17.750> one<00:06:17.990> more

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:18.140 
doesn't transfer over so one more

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:20.650 
doesn't transfer over so one more
training<00:06:18.650> rule<00:06:18.830> before<00:06:19.190> we<00:06:19.430> move<00:06:19.580> on<00:06:19.760> any

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:20.660 
training rule before we move on any

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:23.560 
training rule before we move on any
strength<00:06:21.260> training<00:06:21.590> you<00:06:21.740> do<00:06:22.070> must<00:06:22.790> always<00:06:23.090> be

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:23.570 
strength training you do must always be

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:26.740 
strength training you do must always be
accompanied<00:06:24.169> by<00:06:24.380> sports<00:06:25.370> specific<00:06:26.150> quickness

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:26.750 
accompanied by sports specific quickness

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:30.850 
accompanied by sports specific quickness
training<00:06:27.340> yes<00:06:28.340> in<00:06:28.640> the<00:06:28.970> same<00:06:29.300> session<00:06:29.930> so

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:31.970 
anytime you train

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:34.810 
anytime you train
way<00:06:32.419> to<00:06:32.479> her<00:06:32.780> strength<00:06:33.229> you've<00:06:33.890> got<00:06:34.100> to<00:06:34.220> mix<00:06:34.520> in

way to her strength you've got to mix in

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:36.909 
way to her strength you've got to mix in
a<00:06:35.000> set<00:06:35.300> of<00:06:35.479> plyometric<00:06:36.349> or<00:06:36.530> quickness
