data man I remember when you used to go
for<00:02:32.180> about<00:02:32.270> three<00:02:32.810> three-and-a-half

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
for about three three-and-a-half

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.700 
for about three three-and-a-half
thousand<00:02:33.920> so<00:02:34.880> it<00:02:35.180> not<00:02:35.990> a<00:02:36.020> big<00:02:36.260> fall<00:02:36.470> to<00:02:36.620> be

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:36.710 
thousand so it not a big fall to be

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:38.530 
thousand so it not a big fall to be
honest<00:02:36.980> there's<00:02:37.160> a<00:02:37.220> lot<00:02:37.400> at<00:02:37.670> bigger<00:02:38.000> falls<00:02:38.360> I

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
honest there's a lot at bigger falls I

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.810
