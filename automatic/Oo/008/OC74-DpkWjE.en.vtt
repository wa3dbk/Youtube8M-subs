00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:03.569
This tutorial describes part of the How To called, 

00:00:03.569 --> 00:00:07.670
"Download a large, custom set of records from NCBI."

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:09.789
I'll describe two approaches to download records

00:00:09.789 --> 00:00:11.789
directly from your browser.

00:00:11.789 --> 00:00:13.549
The first approach uses a text query

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:16.349
and the second uses Batch Entrez

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:19.580
with a list of UIDs, or unique identifiers,

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:21.370
such as accession numbers,

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:22.619
gi numbers,

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.890
or gene id's.

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.830
Let's use a text query to find mouse mRNA's

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:30.139
that have the word chemokine

00:00:30.139 --> 00:00:31.539
in the title of the record.

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:37.250
I'll enter mouse[organism] AND chemokine[title] in the Search box.

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:42.150
I could select a specific database, but let's use Entrez's global query.

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.800
Click search.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.840
Since we're looking for mRNAs

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.790
we could pick databases such as Nucleotide,

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:51.850
EST,

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.830
the database of Expressed Sequence Tags,

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:55.530
Gene

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.100
or UniGene.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.330
Let's view the records in Nucleotide.

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:03.739
The tabs represent preset filters

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:06.560
that are applied to all searches in this database.

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.760
You can set different filters by logging in to your My NCBI account.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.360
I'm going to select the RefSeq or Reference Sequence tab

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.500
to get a non-redundant set of sequences.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.950
Clicking the pushpin image on the tab

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:23.850
locks in that search term --

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.010
see how the search term gets added to the query.

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:30.189
Now when I select the mRNA tab,

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:32.519
I have the set of mouse mRNA's from RefSeq

00:01:32.519 --> 00:01:35.119
with chemokine in the title.

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:38.220
Unless I also lock in the mRNA filter,

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.210
the retrieval in the next step

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:42.850
will include any non-mRNA records

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.810
so i'll click on the push pin.

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.279
Use the display menu

00:01:47.279 --> 00:01:49.200
to select the format that you want to download,

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.200
for example, FASTA,

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.540
or a list of gi numbers.

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.200
I'll select FASTA.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.630
Choosing Send to,

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.210
then File

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.369
allows you to save a multi-FASTA file

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:03.369
of all eighty nine records.

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:04.840
If you wanted to display all eighty nine

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.340
on the web page,

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.679
you first would have to set Show to 100

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:11.450
then choose Send to,

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.009
and Text.

00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:16.649
The second approach uses Batch Entrez

00:02:16.649 --> 00:02:19.449
and requires a text file of unique identifiers,

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:21.059
one per line.

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:23.039
You can create such a list from our web pages,

00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:25.039
as just described,

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:28.459
for many, but not all, Entrez databases.

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:30.120
Let's say a colleague sent you a list

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.820
of protein gi numbers

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:34.329
for which you'd like the FASTA sequences.

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:41.329
Go to the Batch Entrez page

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:46.729
and select the correct database,

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:49.969
Protein in this case.

00:02:49.969 --> 00:02:53.329
Browse to your local file of identifiers,

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:57.239
and click Retrieve.

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:00.249
You can then change Display to FASTA,

00:03:00.249 --> 00:03:04.209
and Send To a local file.

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:06.049
If you want to automate retrieval of large

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:08.049
numbers of records,

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:10.579
use the E-Utilities described in this How To.
