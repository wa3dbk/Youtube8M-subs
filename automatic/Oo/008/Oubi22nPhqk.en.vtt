how he can say that he's not ducking

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.970 
how he can say that he's not ducking

mean what that's ducking and as far as

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.770 
mean what that's ducking and as far as
Kell<00:02:27.890> Brook<00:02:28.129> goes<00:02:28.340> I<00:02:28.610> think<00:02:29.269> Kell<00:02:29.480> Brook<00:02:29.660> is

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
Kell Brook goes I think Kell Brook is

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.509 
Kell Brook goes I think Kell Brook is
actually<00:02:30.170> tired<00:02:30.440> of<00:02:30.769> the<00:02:30.860> whole<00:02:30.980> Aamir<00:02:31.280> Khan

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:31.519 
actually tired of the whole Aamir Khan

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:35.320 
actually tired of the whole Aamir Khan
thing<00:02:31.760> right<00:02:31.940> now<00:02:31.970> I<00:02:32.739> think<00:02:33.739> Kell<00:02:33.950> Brook<00:02:34.330> would

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
thing right now I think Kell Brook would

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.300 
thing right now I think Kell Brook would
rather<00:02:35.569> just<00:02:35.840> move<00:02:36.019> on<00:02:36.230> I<00:02:36.470> mean<00:02:36.680> he'd<00:02:37.099> like<00:02:37.280> to

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
rather just move on I mean he'd like to

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.539 
rather just move on I mean he'd like to
fight<00:02:37.610> definitely<00:02:38.470> but<00:02:39.470> at<00:02:40.040> this<00:02:40.190> point<00:02:40.400> he's

00:02:40.539 --> 00:02:40.549 
fight definitely but at this point he's

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:41.830 
fight definitely but at this point he's
thinking<00:02:40.580> you<00:02:40.940> know<00:02:41.090> what<00:02:41.299> I<00:02:41.450> can't<00:02:41.750> be

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
thinking you know what I can't be

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.479 
thinking you know what I can't be
bothered<00:02:42.049> with<00:02:42.260> all<00:02:42.530> these<00:02:42.650> shenanigans<00:02:42.860> let

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:43.489 
bothered with all these shenanigans let

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:45.759 
bothered with all these shenanigans let
me<00:02:43.549> just<00:02:43.700> go<00:02:43.819> fight<00:02:44.060> someone<00:02:44.390> else<00:02:44.569> and<00:02:44.780> carve

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:45.769 
me just go fight someone else and carve

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:47.710 
me just go fight someone else and carve
out<00:02:45.950> my<00:02:45.980> own<00:02:46.250> legacy<00:02:46.519> socon<00:02:47.269> will<00:02:47.480> become

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
out my own legacy socon will become

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.240 
out my own legacy socon will become
irrelevant<00:02:47.930> I<00:02:48.319> think<00:02:48.709> that's<00:02:48.890> what<00:02:49.040> Kell

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
irrelevant I think that's what Kell

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.250 
irrelevant I think that's what Kell
Brook's<00:02:49.489> think<00:02:49.730> it<00:02:49.880> the<00:02:50.390> only<00:02:50.690> person<00:02:51.110> who<00:02:51.230> I

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
Brook's think it the only person who I

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:52.750 
Brook's think it the only person who I
think<00:02:51.380> is<00:02:51.680> desperate<00:02:52.160> for<00:02:52.190> this<00:02:52.400> fight<00:02:52.610> at

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
think is desperate for this fight at

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.240 
think is desperate for this fight at
this<00:02:52.880> point<00:02:53.180> is<00:02:53.360> Eddie<00:02:53.810> Hearn<00:02:54.079> and<00:02:55.010> that's

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
this point is Eddie Hearn and that's

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:56.759 
this point is Eddie Hearn and that's
because<00:02:55.400> Eddie<00:02:55.670> Hearn<00:02:55.849> loves<00:02:56.150> a<00:02:56.269> pound<00:02:56.510> note

00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:56.769 
because Eddie Hearn loves a pound note

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:01.059 
because Eddie Hearn loves a pound note
as<00:02:57.769> he<00:02:58.010> likes<00:02:58.220> to<00:02:58.310> put<00:02:58.579> it<00:02:58.700> that's<00:02:59.480> why<00:03:00.069> because

00:03:01.059 --> 00:03:01.069 
as he likes to put it that's why because

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:02.559 
as he likes to put it that's why because
he<00:03:01.459> knows<00:03:01.730> that<00:03:02.000> that<00:03:02.090> is<00:03:02.239> a<00:03:02.269> massive

00:03:02.559 --> 00:03:02.569 
he knows that that is a massive

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:05.650 
he knows that that is a massive
pay-per-view<00:03:03.349> at<00:03:03.560> Wembley<00:03:04.069> and<00:03:04.660> anyone

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
stands to make a hell of a lot of money

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:08.920 
stands to make a hell of a lot of money
from<00:03:07.340> it<00:03:07.459> that's<00:03:07.849> why<00:03:08.000> he's<00:03:08.299> desperate<00:03:08.900> for

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
from it that's why he's desperate for

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:11.229 
from it that's why he's desperate for
the<00:03:09.110> fight<00:03:09.349> what<00:03:09.980> Kel<00:03:10.250> I<00:03:10.400> mean<00:03:10.549> obviously<00:03:10.730> like
