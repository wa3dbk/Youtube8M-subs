00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:08.980
 Hello dear friends with if you do not 

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:10.870
 feast and today i do a review on not 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:14.200
 such a cheat script on the 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:18.220
 Actually I just donâ€™t know 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:21.220
 haul helping to play shoot and in 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:25.029
 what is its essence in general it allows you us 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:27.489
 speed up the firing of the weapon 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:27.880
 there is here earlier we had what we take 

00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:29.860
 deagle 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:33.070
 start shooting and he shoots pretty 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:35.590
 slowly, that is, here it is again affected 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.420
 on this one if you have a kill or not there too 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:38.710
 the speed is slower well and in general he 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.770
 shoots rather slowly ie we 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:44.200
 we shoot it two times rather slowly in 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:47.170
 today's general clearsky will allow you 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:48.520
 fix this problem and but he will 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.530
 stand much much faster here 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:55.050
 now we make our way find super 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:57.250
 security zone of an abandoned airport and 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.170
 actually check this lego stepnov 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:02.670
 yak but the problem is that i want some 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:05.409
 get here pretty weird so 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:11.170
 can shorter there get on it knows 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:13.479
 type too simple oh we will not 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:16.210
 spend time and so i 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:18.490
 broke into the zone and now find the types 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.409
 let's turn on right now let's be without i'm 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.780
 a package so and then if they start 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:24.179
 I'll merge on I will cut him off quickly 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.850
 rush and where everything 

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:30.880
 didn't understand here so there were three people 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:32.380
 I here answer you there were three 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.929
 bloody man you must have seen 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:39.100
 such on record this for a second project 

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:39.749
 flashed let's go we go in 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.509
 inside 

00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:45.780
 oh guys still gonna start right now 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:45.780
 shooting 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:56.109
 what kind of scientist here about Sarah how fast 

00:01:53.799 --> 00:02:00.549
 shoots just rush wild rush dangerous 

00:01:56.109 --> 00:02:03.219
 Valim here so go for Che 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:06.819
 immortal I don't understand they will 

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:11.730
 generally go out today or not lol 

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:15.880
 oh fuck you 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:19.390
 umm fuck guys guys huge cheater 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:21.310
 cheater dangerous cheater 1 should merge all 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.770
 calls time service to 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.750
 the weapon is over we cut down gm in general 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:28.000
 friends as you see dumplings sewn 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.010
 he kills the boys him fast enough 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.520
 that is, generally Fastov come on cleanly 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:37.660
 blitz ales looks bastard bastard 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:40.810
 even without makeup they play that for me and my own 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:45.550
 I shoot air with no makeup 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:47.320
 watched guys these are curves well i don't know i 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:50.110
 just get a bank I don't want it 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:57.550
 so happy nothing of it 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:03:00.010
 will change in general that's very clear friends 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:01.660
 have you seen a deagle shoot in this one 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.090
 the case that is, he scoops up pretty 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.530
 fast with what the trick is that this 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:07.090
 here's a quick shooting you will have 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.690
 exclusively deagle that is you see it 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:12.460
 plowing 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:14.140
 hard fast and pretty low 

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:15.640
 what do you get to drain anyone 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:17.140
 as soon as possible 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.750
 the problem is that I don't know where 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.760
 I am that some kind of crap very tank 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:24.370
 again this advances to this norm well 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.530
 probably because of the advice of something in 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:29.410
 General guys link I will leave in the description 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:31.090
 come download well and actually 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:33.490
 still worth noting that the cells are so 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.230
 that is, if you are 

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:37.900
 follow admins they are no you 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:40.360
 violations do not calculate because just 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:41.740
 how would you like so fast well how would 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:44.050
 the shooting is actually not visible that she 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:46.150
 so quickly produced can just 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:47.500
 be la clipping lag okay not camp 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.630
 most likely to think so 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:54.490
 so every dragging this species is simply not there 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:54.490
 thank you all bye
