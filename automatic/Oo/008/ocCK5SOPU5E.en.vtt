00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:29.130
 who does not leave in Ghana is a party 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.430
 the stern and gym sport show of each 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.660
 year again in December with 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:36.120
 world class acrobatics 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.219
 rhythmic gymnastics our entire 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.170
 Dutch current or is present 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.850
 so it is quality of it 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.320
 very highest level with 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.790
 entertainment 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.230
 yes I think it is important anyway 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:48.870
 men's gymnastics simply on the cards too 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.370
 and I think quite a lot 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.550
 People in front of us also come for it 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.079
 men's team 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:54.760
 I think it is important that this 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:56.649
 be present and they will find it 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.980
 of course very nice to see us 

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:01.750
 still stand here and our suddenly something 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:03.100
 otherwise show to only gymnastics 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:05.080
 because we are not just doors 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.790
 but can also dance and I think that is 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:10.020
 nice to see that we are not 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.020
 just door the device 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.789
 I find myself a very beautiful act 

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:30.759
 outside of our own turntoppers of course 

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:33.530
 is the show that the Belgian 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:35.060
 Acrogymnasts show beautiful music 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.890
 by michael jackson really a tribute 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.080
 but 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.900
 yes it is right it is frankland it 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:44.150
 is very nicely done 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:45.890
 yes our calligraphy to sabrina is one 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:48.500
 pretty big of the chances of being mine 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:51.530
 never below the main characters 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:53.479
 my concepts and yes we are dancing 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.910
 witcher our thinking leaves a nice story 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:57.979
 is also that you make demands and you 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:59.119
 by foot really the audience dealing in 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:00.890
 the exercise 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:02.840
 as the end come back they would 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.759
 right on fire exactly so nice 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:08.390
 lots to do with it 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:10.429
 yes in the end the story is about it 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.350
 music from the military is true and 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:15.140
 he is a very scary have a number like 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:16.880
 you read the text well and ours 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.620
 dance fit we are also reasonable 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.900
 I think it's aggressive 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.820
 and that is where the audience sits and that 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:26.410
 I think it's cool because that gives you 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:26.410
 extra power to learn everything 

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:40.030
 every day of sport needs it 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.740
 fans i think there will be the current one 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.330
 has a huge fan base 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:45.460
 and a quarter of a million hooves of the 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.770
 sport i don't know how many people have 

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:50.620
 but it is car fans 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:53.080
 countless times bigger and this event 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:55.060
 show again what potential is called 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:57.730
 look on social media watch twitter look 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.380
 Facebook is a sport 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.690
 yes is god at the moment and try 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:03.280
 exploit every possible way 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:07.620
 who are you looking for a note 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.620
 here evers 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:17.210
 Well you can of course on the horizontal bar 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:20.150
 to those who have Michael Jackson 

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:22.280
 jeffrey wammes and epke without land yes so 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:25.010
 what she special for you well it is 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:29.020
 very good at it and we like it very much 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:29.020
 Jeffrey does have a handsome and fun one 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:40.350
 You remotely check your heroes and heroines 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:41.970
 see that is one on television but they 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:44.070
 literally touch them with their abilities 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:47.510
 talk and trace your signature there yes 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:47.510
 that makes it that little bit extra 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.150
 way too fast 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:06.519
 to come here in the Netherlands all in 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:09.400
 Belgium but that's how the public can 

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:10.360
 here or health point spontaneous public and 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.099
 Yes 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:14.860
 its always a lot of blow and all 

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:16.180
 Man learned far and I think 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:18.699
 very few branches of sport 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:20.910
 the netherlands are theirs this way 

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:23.250
 sport in it 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:25.440
 so put it in the light again 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:27.920
 hats off to all those involved 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.920
 involved
