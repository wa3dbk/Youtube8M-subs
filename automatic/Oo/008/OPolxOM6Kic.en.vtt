has become little bit thick

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.309 
has become little bit thick
we<00:01:48.619> don't<00:01:48.830> want<00:01:49.130> to<00:01:49.310> make<00:01:49.429> that<00:01:49.670> way<00:01:49.970> too<00:01:50.319> dry

00:01:51.309 --> 00:01:51.319 
we don't want to make that way too dry

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:53.800 
we don't want to make that way too dry
or<00:01:51.590> we<00:01:51.979> don't<00:01:52.160> want<00:01:52.369> to<00:01:52.520> make<00:01:52.640> it<00:01:52.850> crumbly

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
or we don't want to make it crumbly

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.139 
or we don't want to make it crumbly
there<00:01:54.679> should<00:01:54.920> be<00:01:54.950> a<00:01:55.100> small<00:01:55.369> amount<00:01:55.550> of<00:01:55.910> water

00:01:56.139 --> 00:01:56.149 
there should be a small amount of water

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:59.529 
there should be a small amount of water
in<00:01:56.360> that<00:01:56.390> should<00:01:57.380> be<00:01:57.610> little<00:01:58.610> bit<00:01:58.789> on<00:01:59.060> softer

00:01:59.529 --> 00:01:59.539 
in that should be little bit on softer

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:05.199 
in that should be little bit on softer
side<00:02:01.119> and<00:02:02.979> the<00:02:03.979> next<00:02:04.310> thing<00:02:04.490> that<00:02:04.520> goes<00:02:05.000> in

00:02:05.199 --> 00:02:05.209 
side and the next thing that goes in

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:10.630 
side and the next thing that goes in
here<00:02:05.539> is<00:02:05.690> evaporated<00:02:06.679> milk<00:02:06.709> and<00:02:08.979> add<00:02:09.979> this

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
here is evaporated milk and add this

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:16.510 
here is evaporated milk and add this
milk<00:02:11.090> slowly<00:02:11.420> just<00:02:12.319> little<00:02:12.770> time<00:02:13.130> now<00:02:15.430> this<00:02:16.430> is

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 
milk slowly just little time now this is

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.360 
milk slowly just little time now this is
a<00:02:16.610> type<00:02:16.849> of<00:02:16.880> milk<00:02:17.360> in<00:02:17.630> which<00:02:18.080> water<00:02:18.620> content<00:02:19.190> is

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
a type of milk in which water content is

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.170 
a type of milk in which water content is
removed<00:02:19.970> by<00:02:20.180> 60%<00:02:20.870> from<00:02:21.410> milk<00:02:21.740> by<00:02:22.670> the<00:02:22.700> process

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
removed by 60% from milk by the process

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.330 
removed by 60% from milk by the process
of<00:02:23.270> evaporation

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.020 

and<00:02:27.430> be<00:02:28.390> sure<00:02:28.660> value<00:02:29.230> add<00:02:29.440> milk<00:02:29.770> you<00:02:30.580> continue

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
and be sure value add milk you continue

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:39.240 
and be sure value add milk you continue
to<00:02:31.150> mix<00:02:31.390> it<00:02:31.630> with<00:02:31.900> this<00:02:32.110> coil<00:02:37.739> we<00:02:38.739> don't<00:02:38.980> want

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
to mix it with this coil we don't want
