00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:05.460
 next challenge that we have is the 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.569
 screw of swingarm shaft what 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.940
 we have to do is remove the two 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.930
 screws that are hooked here that 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.390
 the pse removed 

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:14.950
 to remove all the screws and then on 

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:18.280
 this case we are not going to put a gag 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:20.440
 because we have nowhere to support what 

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:22.920
 would be the glass key on the other side with 

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:25.230
 which what I 'm going to do is 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:29.220
 to remove it with a hammer then to 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.690
 to be able to get it out well what I have done is a 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.840
 screw 

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:37.110
 normal or a measuring screw 51 m 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:41.160
 5 and I've put a series on it as you can 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:44.830
 see here of nuts for this 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.070
 it's a tournament with some nuts in a kit 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:49.700
 for example 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:52.460
 is to buy that I would submit like this 5 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:54.800
 sometimes retained by home to 5 and you 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:58.880
 put some nuts then this is going to 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:01.300
 go screwed right here then what 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.300
 screwed 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:08.119
 well what I have done 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.880
 with this is only to create it with a 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:13.579
 sort of point where I'm going to be able 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.649
 hit so that the example is done by 

00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:16.810
 Of course this is done in a very 

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:19.350
 delicate 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.350
 i 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:27.840
 among this they have done only to 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.369
 in 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.710
 and on the other side it should be 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:35.990
 Thank you 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:38.890
 effectively airways 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.890
 like lg 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:46.500
 as the shaft goes hard 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:51.439
 here it looks 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.030
 so now it's a matter of 

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:54.409
 just go hitting it until 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.649
 called 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:56.649
 yes
