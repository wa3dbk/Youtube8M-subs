00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:08.340
 Well today I'm going to show you how to achieve 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:11.580
 fall asleep the ball in the legs and then 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.910
 pass it to sleep not between the heel the 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.910
 leg 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:20.490
 first of all you can do it 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.490
 with dominion in value or so 

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:27.130
 so you end up as you have no insurance 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:27.130
 you throw to his legs 

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:38.460
 then that is beginner always and 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:41.040
 when the ball can be in the air 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.800
 you calculate 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.950
 the fall of the ball and with your legs 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:50.370
 you have to go to get it right if you're 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:53.230
 beginner they took it like that because they 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.720
 you know you would not know how to throw the ball well 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:58.000
 but when you master it only from the 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:01.710
 we go to you and you calculate you made a 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.710
 career would be something like this 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.800
 you have to practice a lot of time and how 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.800
 he loves you better 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.729
 many of my friends 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:22.480
 without domain and your home 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.450
 ah 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.160
 but you already know 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:38.130
 at my feet once you fall asleep 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.560
 you can sleep here higher audio but 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.909
 there will be a little harder to catch 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.130
 because not to be too attached to that 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:47.110
 leg 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.110
 and you will also have a great effort 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:54.180
 and I recommend that you try to sleep 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.830
 this way between the knee and the other 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.990
 knee 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:02:01.310
 You can also put it between below and the 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:04.850
 knee and down the other knee like this 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:08.720
 to perfect kaka you just have to go up 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:11.810
 feel a little that trembles good this 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:14.180
 time this leg if temples turned out the 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.650
 right leg so the value that advanced 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.959
 a little more back 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:21.950
 if you're right tempered the left 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:25.130
 well once you create temples as if 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:27.170
 was doing a world tour and the 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:29.420
 value and it goes up with the heel and the 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:32.200
 lose a little by the leg until 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.200
 I grabbed him haha 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.750
 It would be something like that 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.690
 one is that you have there can be see your 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:48.840
 case you can have there launch it and 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:52.260
 grab it or when you have it or there 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.880
 you can do so later on to follow 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.550
 controlling 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.350
 or if not when you have it there too 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:01.550
 you can throw what you bring or if your legs 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.550
 do something like this 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:10.819
 there is already to your liking 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.819
