few of my secrets today and just those
just<00:00:18.690> why<00:00:18.869> you<00:00:18.900> should<00:00:19.350> get<00:00:19.560> into<00:00:19.859> bananas

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
just why you should get into bananas

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.700 
just why you should get into bananas
because<00:00:20.609> there's<00:00:20.970> such<00:00:21.300> an<00:00:21.449> amazing<00:00:21.869> food<00:00:22.140> all

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
because there's such an amazing food all

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:23.840 
because there's such an amazing food all
right<00:00:22.859> so<00:00:22.980> let's<00:00:23.070> get<00:00:23.250> straight<00:00:23.460> into<00:00:23.580> it

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
right so let's get straight into it

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.610 
right so let's get straight into it
number<00:00:24.750> one<00:00:24.900> is

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:28.620 

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:31.820 

so<00:00:29.160> yellow<00:00:29.700> curve<00:00:30.090> fruit<00:00:30.600> has<00:00:30.930> three

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
so yellow curve fruit has three

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.640 
so yellow curve fruit has three
important<00:00:32.520> factors<00:00:32.970> it<00:00:33.210> has<00:00:33.360> fiber<00:00:33.840> and<00:00:34.230> has

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:34.650 
important factors it has fiber and has

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:37.220 
important factors it has fiber and has
water<00:00:35.160> content<00:00:35.670> and<00:00:35.820> it<00:00:36.210> has<00:00:36.420> sugar<00:00:36.900> content

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
water content and it has sugar content

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.830 
water content and it has sugar content
and<00:00:37.620> all<00:00:38.040> these<00:00:38.280> three<00:00:38.640> things<00:00:38.720> contribute<00:00:39.720> to

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
and all these three things contribute to

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.140 
and all these three things contribute to
you<00:00:39.990> feeling<00:00:40.470> satisfied<00:00:40.740> fight<00:00:41.520> after<00:00:41.910> meal

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:42.150 
you feeling satisfied fight after meal

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.900 
you feeling satisfied fight after meal
so<00:00:42.870> take<00:00:43.110> like<00:00:43.320> a<00:00:43.350> 10<00:00:43.800> banana<00:00:44.160> meal<00:00:44.460> for

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
so take like a 10 banana meal for

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.850 
so take like a 10 banana meal for
instance<00:00:45.270> which<00:00:45.450> I<00:00:45.630> regularly<00:00:46.350> eat<00:00:46.530> and<00:00:46.800> I

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
instance which I regularly eat and I

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.130 
instance which I regularly eat and I
recommend<00:00:47.340> take<00:00:48.030> that<00:00:48.210> tamper<00:00:48.510> data<00:00:48.600> beale<00:00:48.900> it

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
recommend take that tamper data beale it

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.040 
recommend take that tamper data beale it
has<00:00:49.260> about<00:00:49.440> 35<00:00:50.280> grams<00:00:50.700> of<00:00:51.059> fiber<00:00:51.450> in<00:00:51.720> it<00:00:51.750> and

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
has about 35 grams of fiber in it and

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.320 
has about 35 grams of fiber in it and
compare<00:00:52.680> that<00:00:52.710> to<00:00:52.890> a<00:00:53.100> stake<00:00:53.670> of<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.120> same

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:54.330 
compare that to a stake of the same

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:57.440 
compare that to a stake of the same
calorie<00:00:54.750> count<00:00:55.080> and<00:00:55.290> that<00:00:55.320> has<00:00:55.830> about<00:00:56.450> zero

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:57.450 
calorie count and that has about zero

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:00.380 
calorie count and that has about zero
fiber<00:00:57.809> grams<00:00:58.200> as<00:00:58.500> absolutely<00:00:59.340> no<00:00:59.550> fiber<00:00:59.970> and

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
fiber grams as absolutely no fiber and

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.990 
fiber grams as absolutely no fiber and
the<00:01:00.839> water<00:01:01.050> content<00:01:01.290> is<00:01:01.650> low<00:01:01.860> and<00:01:02.129> also<00:01:02.670> the

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
the water content is low and also the

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.030 
the water content is low and also the
sugar<00:01:03.360> content<00:01:03.540> where's<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.320> carbohydrate

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
sugar content where's the carbohydrate

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.400 
sugar content where's the carbohydrate
so<00:01:05.400> these<00:01:05.610> three<00:01:05.910> things<00:01:05.940> are<00:01:06.360> vital<00:01:07.110> if<00:01:07.320> you

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:07.410 
so these three things are vital if you

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:08.960 
so these three things are vital if you
want<00:01:07.530> to<00:01:07.590> keep<00:01:07.710> away<00:01:07.950> from<00:01:07.980> junk<00:01:08.370> food<00:01:08.670> then

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
want to keep away from junk food then

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.480 
want to keep away from junk food then
you<00:01:09.060> have<00:01:09.330> to<00:01:09.570> get<00:01:09.720> fiber<00:01:10.470> water<00:01:11.040> and

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
you have to get fiber water and

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.610 
you have to get fiber water and
carbohydrate<00:01:12.270> content<00:01:12.480> in<00:01:12.870> your<00:01:12.900> foods<00:01:13.290> and

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:13.620 
carbohydrate content in your foods and

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:16.340 
carbohydrate content in your foods and
bananas<00:01:14.250> are<00:01:14.460> fantastic<00:01:15.270> for<00:01:15.300> that<00:01:15.570> okay<00:01:16.230> the

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
bananas are fantastic for that okay the

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.710 
bananas are fantastic for that okay the
fiber<00:01:16.680> it<00:01:17.040> fills<00:01:17.640> it<00:01:17.970> gets<00:01:18.120> bulk<00:01:18.450> to<00:01:18.690> your

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
fiber it fills it gets bulk to your

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.170 
fiber it fills it gets bulk to your
stomach<00:01:19.050> and<00:01:19.409> you<00:01:19.530> call<00:01:19.800> them<00:01:20.010> and<00:01:20.220> then<00:01:20.730> your

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
stomach and you call them and then your

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.610 
stomach and you call them and then your
stomach<00:01:21.390> and<00:01:21.659> colon<00:01:21.780> sends<00:01:22.200> a<00:01:22.260> message<00:01:22.590> to

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:22.620 
stomach and colon sends a message to

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.670 
stomach and colon sends a message to
your<00:01:22.800> brain<00:01:22.860> saying<00:01:23.400> what<00:01:24.060> okay<00:01:24.870> stop<00:01:25.230> we've

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
your brain saying what okay stop we've

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.860 
your brain saying what okay stop we've
had<00:01:25.890> enough<00:01:26.159> food<00:01:26.460> we<00:01:26.909> have<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.360> fiber<00:01:27.630> in

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:27.870 
had enough food we have the fiber in

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:29.899 
had enough food we have the fiber in
there<00:01:28.050> but<00:01:28.380> that<00:01:28.560> coupled<00:01:29.070> with<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.640> water

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
there but that coupled with the water

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.690 
there but that coupled with the water
content<00:01:30.180> which<00:01:30.720> also<00:01:31.200> distends<00:01:32.190> your<00:01:32.310> stomach

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
content which also distends your stomach

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.270 
content which also distends your stomach
wall<00:01:32.970> and<00:01:33.330> sends<00:01:34.050> a<00:01:34.110> signal<00:01:34.260> to<00:01:34.470> your<00:01:34.710> brain<00:01:34.920> to

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
wall and sends a signal to your brain to

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.730 
wall and sends a signal to your brain to
stop<00:01:35.520> eating<00:01:35.940> and<00:01:36.120> the<00:01:36.540> carbohydrates<00:01:37.380> you

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
stop eating and the carbohydrates you

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.160 
stop eating and the carbohydrates you
know<00:01:37.860> you<00:01:38.490> are<00:01:38.790> a<00:01:38.820> sweet<00:01:39.420> tooth<00:01:39.750> you<00:01:40.020> have<00:01:40.140> a

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.620 
know you are a sweet tooth you have a
sweet<00:01:40.500> tooth<00:01:40.740> for<00:01:41.070> a<00:01:41.100> reason<00:01:41.490> so<00:01:41.730> do<00:01:41.790> I<00:01:41.910> when

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
sweet tooth for a reason so do I when

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.960 
sweet tooth for a reason so do I when
naturally<00:01:43.350> attracted<00:01:43.980> to<00:01:44.100> sweet<00:01:44.370> foods<00:01:44.700> we

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
naturally attracted to sweet foods we

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.240 
naturally attracted to sweet foods we
have<00:01:45.180> sugar<00:01:45.990> receptors<00:01:46.650> carbohydrate

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
have sugar receptors carbohydrate

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.250 
have sugar receptors carbohydrate
receptors<00:01:47.670> on<00:01:47.760> our<00:01:47.790> tongue<00:01:48.080> they're<00:01:49.080> the

same time you're not getting a lot of
fats<00:03:49.030> so<00:03:49.750> the<00:03:49.900> low<00:03:50.080> fat<00:03:50.410> fact<00:03:50.740> that<00:03:50.920> does<00:03:51.130> not

fats so the low fat fact that does not

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:14.140 

the<00:04:12.260> next<00:04:12.680> reason<00:04:13.010> why<00:04:13.130> bananas<00:04:13.790> are<00:04:13.970> so

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:14.150 
the next reason why bananas are so

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:16.960 
the next reason why bananas are so
absofruitly<00:04:15.080> awesome<00:04:15.920> for<00:04:16.250> weight<00:04:16.430> loss<00:04:16.670> is

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:16.970 
absofruitly awesome for weight loss is

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:20.260 
absofruitly awesome for weight loss is
because<00:04:17.630> they<00:04:17.870> are<00:04:17.959> full<00:04:18.170> of<00:04:18.260> potassium<00:04:18.590> and<00:04:19.270> I

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:20.270 
because they are full of potassium and I

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:22.360 
because they are full of potassium and I

each other to regulate blood phone so if

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:11.470 
each other to regulate blood phone so if
you're<00:05:09.740> low<00:05:09.950> in<00:05:10.100> potassium<00:05:10.460> then<00:05:11.030> your<00:05:11.210> body

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:11.480 
you're low in potassium then your body

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:12.940 
you're low in potassium then your body
is<00:05:11.780> going<00:05:11.960> to<00:05:12.050> be<00:05:12.140> out<00:05:12.290> of<00:05:12.320> balance<00:05:12.530> any

metabolism<00:05:13.730> is<00:05:13.880> going<00:05:14.150> to<00:05:14.270> be<00:05:14.390> lower<00:05:14.630> so<00:05:14.990> we

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:15.440 
metabolism is going to be lower so we

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.830 
metabolism is going to be lower so we
want<00:05:15.620> a<00:05:15.740> high<00:05:15.980> metabolism<00:05:16.520> so<00:05:17.240> we<00:05:17.360> burn<00:05:17.600> the

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:17.840 
want a high metabolism so we burn the

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:20.140 
want a high metabolism so we burn the
fat<00:05:18.050> that's<00:05:18.560> a<00:05:18.800> goal<00:05:19.010> so<00:05:19.430> you<00:05:19.520> must<00:05:19.820> keep<00:05:20.030> the

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:20.150 
fat that's a goal so you must keep the

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:22.180 
fat that's a goal so you must keep the
potassium<00:05:20.420> high<00:05:20.840> and<00:05:21.140> Bernards<00:05:21.710> fit<00:05:22.010> that
