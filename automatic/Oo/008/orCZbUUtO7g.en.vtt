00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:10.370 
going to screw up dress because of the
land<00:04:08.730> that<00:04:08.970> they<00:04:09.090> throw<00:04:09.360> in<00:04:09.570> the<00:04:09.720> attack<00:04:10.080> and

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:10.380 
land that they throw in the attack and

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.560 
land that they throw in the attack and
taking<00:04:11.280> out<00:04:11.400> one<00:04:11.490> more<00:04:11.700> card<00:04:11.910> for<00:04:12.090> a<00:04:12.120> land<00:04:12.390> in

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:12.570 
taking out one more card for a land in

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:14.330 
taking out one more card for a land in
each<00:04:12.690> pack<00:04:12.960> I<00:04:13.290> could<00:04:13.800> see<00:04:14.040> it<00:04:14.280> being

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
each pack I could see it being

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.310 
each pack I could see it being
understandable<00:04:15.270> for<00:04:15.510> new<00:04:15.600> players<00:04:15.870> but

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
understandable for new players but

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.860 
understandable for new players but
that's<00:04:16.530> why<00:04:16.680> they<00:04:16.830> have<00:04:16.859> started<00:04:17.549> decks<00:04:17.870> sound

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
that's why they have started decks sound

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:20.870 
that's why they have started decks sound
think<00:04:19.109> they<00:04:19.200> should<00:04:19.440> do<00:04:20.100> that<00:04:20.280> if<00:04:20.580> someone's

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
think they should do that if someone's

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.370 
think they should do that if someone's
just<00:04:20.970> going<00:04:21.120> to<00:04:21.180> buy<00:04:21.270> a<00:04:21.299> bunch<00:04:21.660> of<00:04:21.810> packs<00:04:22.049> to

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
just going to buy a bunch of packs to

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.080 
just going to buy a bunch of packs to
start<00:04:22.620> playing<00:04:22.860> that's<00:04:23.370> probably<00:04:23.580> like<00:04:23.910> a

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
start playing that's probably like a

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:26.330 
start playing that's probably like a
really<00:04:24.300> bad<00:04:24.600> idea<00:04:24.890> they<00:04:25.890> should<00:04:26.070> just<00:04:26.190> buy<00:04:26.310> a

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
really bad idea they should just buy a

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:27.950 
really bad idea they should just buy a
theme<00:04:26.670> deck<00:04:26.880> or<00:04:27.090> a<00:04:27.120> starter<00:04:27.540> deck<00:04:27.720> they

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 
theme deck or a starter deck they

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.720 
theme deck or a starter deck they
shouldn't<00:04:28.290> have<00:04:28.380> to<00:04:28.560> put<00:04:29.010> lands<00:04:29.220> in<00:04:29.460> for

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:29.730 
shouldn't have to put lands in for

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:31.550 
shouldn't have to put lands in for
beginning<00:04:30.000> players<00:04:30.210> and<00:04:31.110> it's<00:04:31.260> going<00:04:31.380> to<00:04:31.440> be<00:04:31.530> a

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 
beginning players and it's going to be a

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:32.990 
beginning players and it's going to be a
pain<00:04:31.710> in<00:04:31.800> the<00:04:31.830> ass<00:04:31.980> of<00:04:32.160> draft<00:04:32.460> when<00:04:32.700> people
