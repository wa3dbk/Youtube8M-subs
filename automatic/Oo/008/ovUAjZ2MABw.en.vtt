00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.350
 graphic settings attention 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.290
 featured on video differ from 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.510
 maximum that you too often became 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.210
 use this phrase it's time to change 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.340
 equipment hello everyone with you perfeo 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.139
 club and while you still have not cut down this video 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.910
 To hell I want to say that 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.000
 account with the game was kindly provided 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.250
 in the temporary use of a dude with a nickname 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.910
 white walker country must know their 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.070
 heroes 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.230
 Naturally I could not get around this 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.910
 bread theme like heroes of the storm 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.679
 more I finally managed 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.690
 touch the beautiful and i 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.570
 felt just my duty to do 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:39.570
 video on it and that's when I wrote 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.610
 the script I had stupor about what in 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.620
 This review is telling you already 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.129
 anyway, you know what heroes of the is 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.280
 storm 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.289
 you have seen in any video stream and the 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.239
 the lucky ones who got the invite 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:54.180
 surely you read what thread 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.399
 discussions and controversy analysts koku but 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.760
 that decoction hunt themes appear with 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:02.940
 enviable constancy so i just 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:06.840
 I will say that I liked the game that is not 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:09.420
 I liked it and on this we will disperse the vidos 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.880
 will consist of 90 percent of 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.580
 pure subjectivity that you rather 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.320
 just be uninteresting and still here 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.360
 there will be not very many montage 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.540
 well basically just because i'm very 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:24.479
 a lazy person in the first place 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:27.509
 there are no artifacts in the objects in the hut 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:30.000
 gold is all character development based 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.220
 solely to gain experience instead 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.890
 items washed down the talent system 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.990
 talents are taken every three levels and on 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.460
 the tenth fate awaits us 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.790
 need to take ulta 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:45.180
 1 out of 2 and that's good 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:47.850
 the choice is beautiful great idea i 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.979
 I say without a hint of sarcasm, but more 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.920
 sad because talent and replace 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:55.170
 artifacts are not completely artes through 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.560
 frostmour who is known to be thirsty 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.860
 of blood 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:01.200
 different from dortis through a blizzard 1 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:04.229
 flies into the crowd gives it schm and becomes 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.240
 King 2 flies into the crowd includes 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.940
 blizzards live as long as possible 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.459
 opponent with red them literally in the soul 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.690
 then does not become king because 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.480
 he is all this time to him 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.940
 but the difference between these two 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:21.150
 the arts themselves are not as globally as desired 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.980
 here is leorik with bkb mueller and felt boot 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.750
 this is not the leoric at all 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:28.680
 walks with blink dagger and marcano world 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:30.810
 by the way you will not confuse an input 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.810
 with promise to introduce real leoric 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:36.090
 maybe I give a bad example of not 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:39.560
 I know but the first feeling after three days 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:43.080
 Games such a solution to the problem seems to me 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:45.150
 there is no introduction of artifacts in this game 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.370
 In no case can artifacts be introduced 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.590
 because they will need to somehow get 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:52.020
 or knock out then it is necessary that they 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:54.300
 somewhere were knocked out or buy but then 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:57.750
 Farm will appear this game is not about 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:03:00.420
 farm would like to increase the number 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.850
 talents of the type they learn at first 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:05.400
 level on the second and then every two 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:06.990
 level as it was on those cataclysms 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.900
 more that at first we will still 

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:13.140
 see the same faces and so they though 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:15.690
 would be different by the way talents are 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.790
 repeating for example nazibo can 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:20.100
 explore bribing and instantly poach 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:22.680
 mercenaries have the same talent and 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:25.140
 reimer and it's nice this is the norm 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.959
 and now more on the same 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:30.780
 faces from the master's shoulder every week 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:32.090
 given a choice of seven characters and for noobs 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.560
 generally out of five 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:37.700
 the rest are either for donat or for 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:40.500
 in-game gold and it's kind of bad 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:42.209
 in dota you can take any hero and 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:45.000
 enjoy the game for him how much 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:47.810
 will fit but here again based on 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.970
 positions nubov where are you all heroes 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:53.520
 learn to play at least on these and if you 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:55.890
 no longer a noob something you should have a bunch 

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:58.920
 gold blow to the store for secretly himself or 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:01.350
 who do you like and naturally how 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:03.170
 fucking master of hooks I can't do anything 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:06.000
 don't say local pooja 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:06.900
 a stitch that looks like a butcher from 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.810
 warcraft 3 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:12.120
 this is not the same path they have in common 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:14.130
 just a hook with it here it is pretty 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.620
 castrated he doesn't fly through 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:18.510
 fortress walls don't fly through the building 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.730
 does not cling to allies 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:24.120
 so he clung allies need to be taught 

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:26.970
 separate talent and another hook on wears 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:28.860
 purely symbolic damage only 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:31.800
 an appointment that I noticed at the hook 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:34.500
 this catch up runaway opponents or 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:37.590
 wait in the bushes with the team pull 1 and 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:39.660
 fight on 5 by 4 and with 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:42.960
 team because stitch stupidly nothing 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:45.690
 kill if pooj catches someone this 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:48.210
 someone almost guaranteed this corpse 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:48.720
 hero turns action-rpg survival 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:52.200
 horror 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:54.960
 and the stitch is just plain thick smelly 

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:57.360
 the guy rudiments of control is cool 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.860
 a hero but nothing to do with 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.590
 brutal and severe puja 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:03.600
 Well, now that I am definitely here 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:07.200
 liked it before were controversial 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:09.990
 moments now that's exactly good in 

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:11.250
 there are 5 cards so far 5 but already 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:13.590
 announced the sixth 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:16.590
 Here is a video that I gathered was 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:18.270
 originally the heavenly temple of the diablo or 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:19.760
 something like that i don't know i'm not very 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:22.470
 I understand the diablo universe 

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:25.620
 here we see new types of heroes 

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:27.690
 trawl jaina dude without a portrait this 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:30.180
 there will be an analogue of the mipo that is a hero for 

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:32.060
 starcraft ii raw we have three vikings 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:34.740
 and everyone has their own abilities 

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:37.890
 switch between them microcontrol 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:40.380
 Zadrota's dream so here it is for each map 

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:43.230
 we are waiting for a quest that will allow especially 

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:45.990
 well push here there is a card to control 

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:48.030
 points you need to keep the point above the point 

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:50.850
 below and then in the center one of the heroes 

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:54.240
 can become a dragon knight a knight and 

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:56.580
 dragon is a very angry guy and finally 

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:59.730
 the most important plus because of which i am 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:00.330
 games loved this wild and nonstop 

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:03.780
 action packed 

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:06.000
 you know it's not fun then to ekshon 

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:06.900
 straight nonstop but usually so 

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.750
 happens 

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:12.690
 the parties do not go very long but I 

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:15.690
 it was 30 minutes maximum is not bad either 

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:18.930
 if you win you win it 

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:21.780
 nice but if you are cruelly humiliated 

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:23.310
 it will not be too long and still need 

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:26.130
 say that there is always the possibility 

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:28.260
 turn the game around more than once 

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:28.900
 that we have in all the cracks but then 

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.759
 saber 

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:33.550
 pension show assholes gruel 

00:06:30.759 --> 00:06:35.740
 mother of hopeless situations practically not 

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:38.830
 happens but only if there is no perry format 

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:41.440
 somewhere level is 4 but it needs to get there 

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:42.250
 completely in armless team in general that 

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:44.470
 can say 

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:48.220
 played vigorously dynamic to 

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:51.070
 cheerful merry i still 

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:53.710
 probably merry big tactical 

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:56.020
 delights I did not notice on the other hand 

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:57.310
 screen young she can be said even 

00:06:56.020 --> 00:07:00.009
 not born yet 

00:06:57.310 --> 00:07:01.720
 closed alpha testing all that and 

00:07:00.009 --> 00:07:04.060
 she still has everything ahead 

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:06.400
 in the end when i dota for the first time 

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:09.039
 I saw what a good tactic I thought 

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:11.650
 here there are three possible lines along which 

00:07:09.039 --> 00:07:14.260
 morons some run and not all 

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:16.600
 turned out to be much deeper and similarity i 

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:19.479
 more than sure that will be the same 

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:20.110
 history so look with confidence in 

00:07:19.479 --> 00:07:24.400
 future 

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:28.590
 wait we believe and all that and was with you 

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:28.590
 perfect noob and see you
