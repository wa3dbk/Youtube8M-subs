00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
asking how to do this and so here is the

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.569 
asking how to do this and so here is the
way<00:01:36.509> to<00:01:36.570> do<00:01:36.840> it<00:01:36.869> you<00:01:37.140> can<00:01:37.770> do<00:01:37.890> it<00:01:37.920> in<00:01:38.100> any<00:01:38.310> of<00:01:38.460> the

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
way to do it you can do it in any of the

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.609 
way to do it you can do it in any of the
focus<00:01:39.090> areas<00:01:39.540> and<00:01:39.780> then<00:01:39.900> you<00:01:40.020> just<00:01:40.200> go<00:01:40.350> into

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
focus areas and then you just go into

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.499 
focus areas and then you just go into
the<00:01:40.710> fog<00:01:40.890> area<00:01:41.250> and<00:01:41.430> that's<00:01:41.579> it<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:42.270> only

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
the fog area and that's it the only

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.749 
the fog area and that's it the only
downside<00:01:42.720> is<00:01:43.049> that<00:01:43.290> as<00:01:43.530> soon<00:01:43.649> as<00:01:43.799> you<00:01:43.920> start<00:01:44.280> if

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
downside is that as soon as you start if

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.460 
downside is that as soon as you start if
you<00:01:44.909> don't<00:01:45.090> have<00:01:45.240> it<00:01:45.329> paused<00:01:45.600> then<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.290> fog

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
you don't have it paused then the fog

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.840
