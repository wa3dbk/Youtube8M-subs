prosthesis<00:00:17.400> you're<00:00:18.090> gonna<00:00:18.210> want<00:00:18.510> a<00:00:18.750> very

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
prosthesis you're gonna want a very

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.100 
prosthesis you're gonna want a very
securely<00:00:19.680> fit<00:00:20.070> socket<00:00:20.670> this<00:00:21.570> one<00:00:21.810> in

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:22.110 
securely fit socket this one in

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:24.560 
securely fit socket this one in
particular<00:00:22.259> is<00:00:22.740> the<00:00:22.770> suction<00:00:23.099> socket<00:00:23.699> so<00:00:24.270> it's

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
particular is the suction socket so it's

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.510 
particular is the suction socket so it's
held<00:00:24.750> very<00:00:24.990> securely<00:00:25.410> and<00:00:25.560> minimizes<00:00:26.310> the

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:26.520 
held very securely and minimizes the

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.189 
held very securely and minimizes the
amount<00:00:26.820> of<00:00:27.000> friction<00:00:27.270> and<00:00:27.689> piston<00:00:28.050> ting

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
amount of friction and piston ting

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.640 
amount of friction and piston ting
inside<00:00:28.710> the<00:00:28.890> socket<00:00:29.630> adds<00:00:30.630> a<00:00:30.990> lot<00:00:31.170> of<00:00:31.289> comfort

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
inside the socket adds a lot of comfort

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.369 
inside the socket adds a lot of comfort
but<00:00:32.070> also<00:00:32.250> makes<00:00:32.699> it<00:00:33.150> feel<00:00:33.360> less<00:00:33.840> of<00:00:34.019> a<00:00:34.080> device

00:00:34.369 --> 00:00:34.379 
but also makes it feel less of a device

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:36.619 
but also makes it feel less of a device
and<00:00:35.190> then<00:00:35.340> secondly<00:00:35.670> this<00:00:35.970> is<00:00:36.090> the<00:00:36.210> reflex

00:00:36.619 --> 00:00:36.629 
and then secondly this is the reflex

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:39.620 
and then secondly this is the reflex
shock<00:00:36.960> foot<00:00:37.410> foot<00:00:37.860> and<00:00:37.980> ankle<00:00:38.070> module<00:00:38.760> and<00:00:38.940> it

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:39.630 
shock foot foot and ankle module and it

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:41.720 
shock foot foot and ankle module and it
gives<00:00:39.870> me<00:00:40.050> shock<00:00:40.260> absorption<00:00:40.680> you<00:00:41.430> can<00:00:41.550> see

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
gives me shock absorption you can see

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.520 
gives me shock absorption you can see
that<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.149> shock<00:00:42.360> absorption<00:00:42.690> is<00:00:42.930> I<00:00:43.050> put<00:00:43.320> late

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
that the shock absorption is I put late

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.369 
that the shock absorption is I put late
into<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.040> prosthesis<00:00:44.520> but<00:00:45.210> not<00:00:45.480> rotation<00:00:46.170> I

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
into the prosthesis but not rotation I

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:47.869 
into the prosthesis but not rotation I
want<00:00:46.980> to<00:00:47.040> be<00:00:47.100> able<00:00:47.160> to<00:00:47.250> post<00:00:47.489> on<00:00:47.790> that

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
want to be able to post on that

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.020 
want to be able to post on that
prosthesis<00:00:48.300> and<00:00:48.690> have<00:00:48.870> it<00:00:49.100> solid<00:00:50.100> and<00:00:50.280> fixed

my balance I'm gonna move on to my
running<00:00:56.010> specific<00:00:56.820> prosthesis<00:00:57.270> this<00:00:58.140> is<00:00:58.350> a

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
running specific prosthesis this is a

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.100 
running specific prosthesis this is a
flex<00:00:58.829> run<00:00:59.100> by<00:00:59.399> oser<00:00:59.879> it's<00:01:00.360> obviously<00:01:00.960> designed

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:01.110 
flex run by oser it's obviously designed

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.040 
flex run by oser it's obviously designed
specifically<00:01:01.890> for<00:01:02.039> running<00:01:02.840> typically<00:01:03.840> we'll

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:04.050 
specifically for running typically we'll

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:06.770 
specifically for running typically we'll
put<00:01:04.410> a<00:01:04.649> running<00:01:05.309> sole<00:01:05.580> or<00:01:05.940> some<00:01:06.180> type<00:01:06.750> of

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
put a running sole or some type of

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.260 
put a running sole or some type of
surface<00:01:07.380> on<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.710> toe<00:01:07.920> and<00:01:08.280> you<00:01:08.789> can<00:01:08.910> see<00:01:09.060> that

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
surface on the toe and you can see that

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.450 
surface on the toe and you can see that
there's<00:01:09.420> no<00:01:09.600> heel<00:01:09.930> so<00:01:10.410> it's<00:01:10.560> purely<00:01:10.830> made<00:01:11.100> just

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
there's no heel so it's purely made just

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.850 
there's no heel so it's purely made just
for<00:01:11.580> a<00:01:11.670> running<00:01:12.000> motion<00:01:12.180> and<00:01:12.630> one<00:01:13.470> slight

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
for a running motion and one slight

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.490 
for a running motion and one slight
difference<00:01:14.070> in<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.549> socket<00:01:15.180> here<00:01:15.479> is<00:01:15.659> we<00:01:16.260> put

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
difference in the socket here is we put

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.340 
difference in the socket here is we put
the<00:01:16.650> suction<00:01:16.950> porch<00:01:17.750> external<00:01:18.750> as<00:01:18.900> opposed<00:01:19.229> to

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
the suction porch external as opposed to

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.620 
the suction porch external as opposed to
on<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:19.710> inside<00:01:19.979> and<00:01:20.520> what<00:01:21.030> that<00:01:21.180> does<00:01:21.450> is

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
on the inside and what that does is

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.679 
on the inside and what that does is
allows<00:01:21.930> me<00:01:22.320> to<00:01:22.890> hook<00:01:23.159> to<00:01:23.220> this<00:01:23.729> valve<00:01:24.000> with<00:01:24.659> a

one<00:02:08.890> other<00:02:09.069> interesting<00:02:09.729> part<00:02:10.240> of<00:02:10.479> this<00:02:10.720> is

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:10.990 
one other interesting part of this is

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:14.010 
one other interesting part of this is
that<00:02:11.350> I<00:02:11.650> do<00:02:11.890> like<00:02:12.340> to<00:02:12.370> cut<00:02:12.819> the<00:02:13.090> carbon<00:02:13.810> fiber

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 
that I do like to cut the carbon fiber

that I do like to cut the carbon fiber
frame<00:02:14.530> a<00:02:14.860> little<00:02:15.100> lower<00:02:15.550> in<00:02:15.970> each<00:02:16.209> of<00:02:16.390> the

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
frame a little lower in each of the

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.780 
frame a little lower in each of the
hamstring<00:02:16.930> tendons<00:02:17.410> which<00:02:17.980> when<00:02:18.310> I'm<00:02:18.430> in<00:02:18.580> deep

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790

knee<00:02:19.120> flexion<00:02:19.450> cycling<00:02:20.230> just<00:02:20.709> gives<00:02:20.890> me<00:02:21.010> a

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.069 
knee flexion cycling just gives me a

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:26.130 
knee flexion cycling just gives me a
little<00:02:21.310> more<00:02:21.550> comfortable<00:02:22.560> socket<00:02:23.560> fit<00:02:25.140> one

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
little more comfortable socket fit one

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.350 
little more comfortable socket fit one
final<00:02:26.590> part<00:02:26.830> about<00:02:27.040> this<00:02:27.280> is<00:02:27.580> once<00:02:28.239> again

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
final part about this is once again

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.180 
final part about this is once again
since<00:02:28.750> I'm<00:02:28.900> not<00:02:29.050> using<00:02:29.319> this<00:02:29.590> prosthesis<00:02:29.830> for

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
since I'm not using this prosthesis for

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.490 
since I'm not using this prosthesis for
running<00:02:30.760> or<00:02:30.970> something<00:02:31.150> where<00:02:31.510> comfort<00:02:32.200> is

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
running or something where comfort is

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.800 
running or something where comfort is
more<00:02:32.860> important<00:02:33.370> we<00:02:33.880> did<00:02:34.120> tighten<00:02:34.600> this

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
more important we did tighten this

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.830 
more important we did tighten this
socket<00:02:35.739> up<00:02:35.890> you<00:02:36.130> can<00:02:36.280> see<00:02:36.459> the<00:02:36.760> the<00:02:37.150> definition

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
socket up you can see the the definition

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.070 
socket up you can see the the definition
in<00:02:38.650> the<00:02:38.709> socket<00:02:39.250> and<00:02:39.430> once<00:02:40.209> again<00:02:40.330> just<00:02:40.720> just

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
in the socket and once again just just

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.900 
in the socket and once again just just
to<00:02:41.170> give<00:02:41.290> me<00:02:41.410> a<00:02:41.440> very<00:02:41.680> secure<00:02:42.069> fit<00:02:42.400> and<00:02:42.670> make<00:02:42.790> it

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
to give me a very secure fit and make it

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:45.360 
to give me a very secure fit and make it
feel<00:02:43.120> more<00:02:43.330> as<00:02:43.450> a<00:02:43.630> unit<00:02:44.170> the<00:02:44.650> final<00:02:45.160> thing<00:02:45.340> to

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
feel more as a unit the final thing to

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.479 
feel more as a unit the final thing to
think<00:02:45.850> it's<00:02:45.940> important<00:02:46.300> to<00:02:46.390> point<00:02:46.569> out<00:02:46.750> is
