00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.980
 ok well, that sounded a toast too 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:11.690
 the question is how much is it worth driving here 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:14.019
 such attacks to all teams 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:14.019
 has become 

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:21.280
 soap now we get out there let's say 3-4 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:24.710
 here is the day in a very average 

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:28.369
 but generally it is better in the best of course 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:30.470
 week where in this and the first two days all 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:33.680
 equal to some degree so he himself 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:35.750
 went the tree well because it will go 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:39.470
 all these entropies here 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:41.510
 protection will be removed here that is possible 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:44.570
 Of course faster but for this you need 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:47.629
 there practice went different such as 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:49.290
 he meditated as if he let go 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:53.450
 first video 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:57.390
 I took it like that 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:59.340
 much depends on energy place still 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.710
 times here going back to this place and 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.420
 I will do this kind of filming, we are small 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.070
 circular 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:07.440
 Here from all places where we were this 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.170
 causes the most such positive ones as 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.910
 I would like to convey emotions 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.570
 your emotional state 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:17.400
 yes, that is, I came and never did 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.560
 there was a desire and then right away once 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:23.100
 there was a desire to share 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:26.250
 that is what I felt here 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:30.360
 I came immediately to charge you 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:33.300
 positive that is for a week for example 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.550
 you can come and speak very much again 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.800
 not tense for a wallet that is if 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:40.110
 going to companies for example there even 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:44.250
 not 6, for example, 12 people each 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:49.200
 completely calm yes ducks here even 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:52.830
 how the fly cuddles learn the surface of God 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.330
 Grace in general everything is super in the evening 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:58.020
 probably still nightingale beeches 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:59.360
 but there are 10-12 people like 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:03.380
 going to 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:06.740
 leave here and it turns out that its 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:08.330
 the company that is, in the middle of the week here again 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.120
 what's the use of it 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:14.000
 life of the white sahib what is the advantage 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:17.960
 the fact that you are not tied to this here 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.570
 matrix system then that well even if you 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:22.250
 for example working on some 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:25.070
 high paying job here is an atom 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:27.560
 cut your trial cable over this one 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:31.490
 that's all but you are tough to 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:33.080
 system and it turns out that if there is 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:35.630
 opportunity for example to somewhere 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:37.730
 get out then only on the weekend that is 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:40.489
 again let you go there on Friday 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:44.330
 there may be early there hours 5 yes 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:47.480
 you get up in traffic up to 9 in order to 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:49.340
 get out somewhere simple all means 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.769
 button is selected 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:54.319
 what is waiting for you here when you express on 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:56.060
 Weekend waiting for you a large number 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:03:01.250

 footages yes large amounts of alcohol 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.970

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:14.780
 close as it were very close tight 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:18.049
 communication with people of different backgrounds there if 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:19.730
 there are practically pro and danish layers 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:21.319
 when that is 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:23.659
 because it is not a fact that is actually 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:25.370
 a person can climb both 

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:27.260
 social strata there yes that is 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:30.220
 tormented there making money but when 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:32.640
 this soul remain so 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:39.810
 saying flying we won't talk 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:42.300
 It was cast here so that is , you will have 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:45.400
 wait in general 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:47.440

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:50.020
 a little bit here they caught literally one 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:52.510
 day for us it was enough that the 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:54.910
 It means the family came first 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:57.190

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:10.730
 ass difference here 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:12.010
 that is, the second thing that means we 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:15.459
 heard that is 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:17.870
 Nightingales were beating, and in short 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:18.520
 opens wide the door of this shit 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:21.170
 mazda 

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:21.980
 that's turned on cut one column 

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:24.950
 auto sound 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:26.690
 that is, all this work begins 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:32.420
 to ok-tots-pervertots 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:34.640

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:35.680

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:39.530
 shit song 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:41.900
 that is, here is such a bullshit so yes 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:43.790
 this is not a rest i can say it 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:46.130
 this is a mockery of your own 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:49.640
 psyche because you get like 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:53.840
 here you are trying to get out of this one 

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:55.820
 from the city there you have yes but this city on 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:57.010
 in fact he overtakes you and on 

00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:00.680
 to nature 

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:02.990
 therefore, there is no rest 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:04.169
 I insist that's just at the exit all 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:05.999
 still out 

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:08.099
 as if for the second tray Sergey 

00:05:05.999 --> 00:05:10.400
 technical cycle in 3 because it 

00:05:08.099 --> 00:05:13.040
 Already here quality allows 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:15.020
 make changes in life that is 

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:17.120
 and changes occur to him in 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:18.919
 quantity there lava I yes somehow it 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:21.320
 most there earn more there 

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:23.419
 more ponte no speech just did not 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:26.120
 about pandas and it 's about quality 

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:27.860
 life that is you start to dispose 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:29.810
 your time and you have the opportunity 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:32.720
 for example, rest when everything 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:34.820
 the rest work there, that is, I can 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:37.690
 say here we have chosen among the week before 

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:40.940
 nobody here but us essentially do not have a 

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:44.060
 here and the company is chosen 

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:46.910
 a company of such here but its people 

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:49.180
 there is not a motley board here 

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:51.979
 people who exactly match each other 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:55.639
 not because they work for example there 

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:56.360
 there remstroymontazh abal-gassan review there 

00:05:55.639 --> 00:06:00.470

 worldviews one 

00:06:02.599 --> 00:06:07.280
 worldview is the same ie they 

00:06:04.539 --> 00:06:08.570
 perceive life is one and here 

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:12.800
 it turns out now 

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:14.389
