 brito and we are in a new news 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:16.380
 attention because the advertising itself 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:19.270
 xbox one recognizes that they are behind 

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:21.099

 advertising campaign of xbox mobile is 

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:25.680
 first of all curious since it shows us 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:28.810
 images of your upcoming titles with a 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.420
 really a speech that encourages good 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:33.340
 to resist getting up to return the 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:35.440
 hit in a clear reference to the 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.200
 advantageous position of playstation 4 in 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.309
 the console market Dexia 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.910
 Microsoft has launched this campaign 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:44.710
 of television in the USA that assumes its 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:46.960
 position at a disadvantage compared to the 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:48.489
 another new generation console 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.649
 right now there are 5 million 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:53.079
 approximately in xbox band sold in 

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:56.980
 the world while the sony machine 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:59.710
 almost doubles those figures what is good 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.239
 justifies this type of ads on 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.219
 first announcement of the campaign 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:06.310
 television are called the best games 

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:08.350
 and it has a clear message that it is 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.980
 of a speed taken from the rocky movie 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:13.500
 balboa in which the boxer tried 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:15.300
 for this reason you already know explains the 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.820
 hardness of life the blows you're going to 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:19.890
 receive one as regards the 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.180
 simple sales comparison decision 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.610
 four like that microsoft is 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.050
 receiving many blows currently and 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.870
 the importance of getting up and 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:29.400
 counterattack this monologue is accompanied 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:31.560
 for images of games like halo 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.980
 guards call of duty aldo software funk 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.660
 or sunset overdrive it must be said that the 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:38.130
 second announcement that the campaign was 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:40.350
 feel in the multiplayer mode of the 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.480
 console while the speech also 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.700
 has a double reading speaks of the value 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:47.310
 of people who do not always win 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.770
 but because of being sincere, not like 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.680
 company to be able to look at their faces 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:55.310
 friends and say you have not failed them 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:57.950
 something so that microsoft 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:01.100
 a lot about their e3 policies 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.930
 of the year two years ago but good those 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.500
 they are another separate issue because if not then 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:07.789
 You attack me by telling me that I'm a fanboy 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:11.030
 I'm just commenting on this 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:13.480
 news is clear this announcement is clear 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:16.640
 is this policy that is acquiring 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:19.190
 microsoft like admitting that they are going 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.780
 behind and trying to move forward is like in 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.390
 the new football when you say you're going 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.970
 favorite or you're not going to favorite not the one 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:28.459
 it's humble always, well, like, 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.860
 it seems that it has more to gain than the 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:33.500
 that goes from favorite and really then to 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.870
 Sometimes the one that is covered because it wins not 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:39.350
 that 's how they want to try to do that 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:41.510
 tactics we go more or less so already 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:45.170

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:48.380
 I want you to well understand what 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:50.930
 I do not want to hurt xbox band anymore 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:53.040
 but it is an advertisement that really 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:55.950
 has double reading 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:58.370
 really, it's there, there's also 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:01.049
 know how to take things and know 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:03.629
 identify by being just an advertisement 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:05.879
 of equipment which recognizes that they are going 

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:08.129
 behind playstation 4 and it's like a 

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:10.590
 sort of why they go for tapadillo 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:14.129

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:18.769
