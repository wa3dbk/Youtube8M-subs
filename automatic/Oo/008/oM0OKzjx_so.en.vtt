00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:38.050 
they're called the zip grooves this is

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.440 
they're called the zip grooves this is
more<00:01:38.950> like<00:01:39.100> their<00:01:39.310> gunmetal<00:01:39.730> finish<00:01:39.910> a<00:01:40.210> little

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
more like their gunmetal finish a little

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:41.790 
more like their gunmetal finish a little

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:41.800 
bit darker finish I like the finish

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.530 
bit darker finish I like the finish
because<00:01:42.250> it<00:01:42.370> makes<00:01:42.970> them<00:01:43.120> look<00:01:43.240> a<00:01:43.300> little<00:01:43.390> bit

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:43.540
