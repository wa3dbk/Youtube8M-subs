got
over<00:00:20.189> here<00:00:20.400> the<00:00:21.150> Topanga<00:00:21.599> spring<00:00:22.199> reverb<00:00:22.470> and

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
over here the Topanga spring reverb and

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.330 
over here the Topanga spring reverb and
what<00:00:24.119> we<00:00:24.300> got<00:00:24.449> here<00:00:24.750> is<00:00:24.810> the<00:00:25.680> old<00:00:25.919> Fender

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
what we got here is the old Fender

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.409 
what we got here is the old Fender
spring<00:00:26.970> tube<00:00:27.359> outboard<00:00:27.869> unit<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.919> free<00:00:29.160> knob

00:00:29.409 --> 00:00:29.419 
spring tube outboard unit the free knob

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:32.179 
spring tube outboard unit the free knob
we<00:00:30.419> put<00:00:30.720> that<00:00:30.840> in<00:00:31.020> a<00:00:31.050> small<00:00:31.289> box<00:00:31.529> and<00:00:31.859> we've<00:00:31.949> got

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
we put that in a small box and we've got

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.680 
we put that in a small box and we've got
that<00:00:32.460> spring<00:00:32.879> tube<00:00:33.120> sound

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
that spring tube sound

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.900 
that spring tube sound
we've<00:00:34.500> got<00:00:34.680> mixed<00:00:35.070> well<00:00:35.280> and<00:00:35.309> tone<00:00:35.699> the

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
we've got mixed well and tone the

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.960 
we've got mixed well and tone the
traditional<00:00:36.420> controls<00:00:36.780> you<00:00:37.050> will<00:00:37.140> see<00:00:37.470> on<00:00:37.970> the

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:38.970 
traditional controls you will see on the

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:40.939 
traditional controls you will see on the
outboard<00:00:39.839> unit<00:00:40.110> but<00:00:40.230> we<00:00:40.290> also<00:00:40.440> have<00:00:40.650> a<00:00:40.710> volume

00:00:40.939 --> 00:00:40.949 
outboard unit but we also have a volume

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:43.579 
outboard unit but we also have a volume
control<00:00:41.400> so<00:00:41.640> you<00:00:42.390> can<00:00:42.629> go<00:00:42.720> from<00:00:42.809> unity<00:00:43.290> to<00:00:43.559> a

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:43.589 
control so you can go from unity to a

00:00:43.589 --> 00:00:46.880 
control so you can go from unity to a
really<00:00:43.920> nice<00:00:44.129> discrete<00:00:44.940> transistor<00:00:45.480> boost<00:00:45.890> so

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
really nice discrete transistor boost so

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.220 
really nice discrete transistor boost so
that<00:00:47.010> really<00:00:47.280> adds<00:00:48.089> a<00:00:48.329> lot<00:00:48.360> to<00:00:48.750> what<00:00:48.989> you<00:00:49.110> can

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
that really adds a lot to what you can

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.829 
that really adds a lot to what you can
do<00:00:49.350> with<00:00:49.470> it<00:00:50.030> we'll<00:00:51.030> hear<00:00:51.239> it<00:00:51.300> in<00:00:51.390> a<00:00:51.449> second

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:51.839 
do with it we'll hear it in a second

00:00:51.839 --> 00:00:59.119 
do with it we'll hear it in a second
here<00:00:52.049> but<00:00:53.299> topanga<00:00:54.299> spring<00:00:54.600> reverb

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.139 

and<00:00:59.609> here<00:00:59.820> we<00:01:00.000> have<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.300> Karma<00:01:00.899> suture<00:01:02.149> this

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
and here we have the Karma suture this

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.240 
and here we have the Karma suture this
pedal<00:01:03.690> is<00:01:04.250> hard<00:01:05.250> to<00:01:05.400> explain

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.250 
pedal is hard to explain

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.680 
pedal is hard to explain
most<00:01:08.250> people<00:01:08.490> would<00:01:08.610> first<00:01:09.060> call<00:01:09.270> on<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.479> fuzz

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:09.690 
most people would first call on the fuzz

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:12.740 
most people would first call on the fuzz
pedal<00:01:10.140> it<00:01:10.350> does<00:01:10.590> have<00:01:10.830> a<00:01:10.890> PNP<00:01:11.340> germanium<00:01:12.149> the

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
pedal it does have a PNP germanium the

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.350 
pedal it does have a PNP germanium the
old<00:01:12.869> stock<00:01:13.110> Russian<00:01:13.729> germanium<00:01:14.729> transistor

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
old stock Russian germanium transistor

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.889 
old stock Russian germanium transistor
and<00:01:15.540> an<00:01:15.869> NPN<00:01:17.000> silicon<00:01:18.000> transistor<00:01:18.830> in<00:01:19.830> a<00:01:19.890> pair

00:01:20.889 --> 00:01:20.899 
and an NPN silicon transistor in a pair

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:23.899 
and an NPN silicon transistor in a pair
its<00:01:21.899> thing<00:01:22.259> is<00:01:22.409> it<00:01:22.590> makes<00:01:23.190> even<00:01:23.670> order

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
its thing is it makes even order

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.770 
its thing is it makes even order
harmonics<00:01:25.250> actually<00:01:26.250> this<00:01:26.369> will<00:01:26.520> help<00:01:26.780> if

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
harmonics actually this will help if

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.550 
harmonics actually this will help if
you've<00:01:28.500> heard<00:01:28.740> of<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:29.190> harmonic<00:01:29.729> percolator

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
you've heard of the harmonic percolator

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.090 
you've heard of the harmonic percolator
it's<00:01:31.560> based<00:01:31.920> on<00:01:32.159> that<00:01:32.310> and<00:01:32.640> this<00:01:32.880> is<00:01:33.060> our

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
it's based on that and this is our

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.529 
it's based on that and this is our
extension<00:01:35.100> event<00:01:35.429> I'm<00:01:35.640> pretty<00:01:36.270> big<00:01:36.420> I

00:01:36.529 --> 00:01:36.539 
extension event I'm pretty big I

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:38.960 
extension event I'm pretty big I
basically<00:01:36.899> took<00:01:37.200> that<00:01:37.460> circuit<00:01:38.460> idea<00:01:38.729> ago

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
basically took that circuit idea ago

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.419 
basically took that circuit idea ago
this<00:01:39.090> is<00:01:39.149> really<00:01:39.479> cool<00:01:39.750> I<00:01:40.159> want<00:01:41.159> to<00:01:41.220> see<00:01:41.310> what

00:01:41.419 --> 00:01:41.429 
this is really cool I want to see what

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:43.070 
this is really cool I want to see what
else<00:01:41.550> I<00:01:41.700> can<00:01:41.819> do<00:01:41.970> with<00:01:42.000> it<00:01:42.210> we've<00:01:42.659> added<00:01:42.840> some

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:43.080 
else I can do with it we've added some

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.350 
else I can do with it we've added some
more<00:01:43.200> functionality<00:01:43.890> to<00:01:43.920> it<00:01:44.210> we<00:01:45.210> have<00:01:45.270> a

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
more functionality to it we have a

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.330 
more functionality to it we have a
density<00:01:45.750> knob<00:01:46.020> you<00:01:46.740> can<00:01:46.770> go<00:01:47.009> from<00:01:47.159> really
