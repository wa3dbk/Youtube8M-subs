00:00:00.969 --> 00:00:08.450
 Of Korea 

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:11.570
 There are so many things in that week. 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:16.820
 This song is never easy. 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:19.550
 If you master some of the songs of this song , 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:25.550
 You get to learn techniques. 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:31.729
 And right hand finger and left hand coordination as well as 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:35.500
 How to enjoy, slide, and return to the original code 

00:00:31.729 --> 00:00:37.610
 I have to practice so hard because I can comprehensively do things like this 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:41.710
 I want you to try it. 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.710
 The machine gun ringing pattern 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:50.240
 In the midst of keeping abusive language 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:52.110
 It is an arduous technique that precisely matches the melody you want . 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:58.410
 uh 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:01:01.230
 Suddenly, before you go into practice, listen to this song a lot and of course 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:06.360
 I'd recommend you listen to the original song. 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:07.260
 Uh melody is exactly how hasineunge catch any melody that will be used 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.450
 good 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:19.260
 In fact, other fingering things like that look at this melody line 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:20.580
 Just because melody is so awkward to the instrument, 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:26.280
 Line 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:28.450
 If you think about that assist the main melody melody is rather pyeonhasil 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:34.120
 same 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:36.150
 Let's take a look at the melody line first. 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.150
 2 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:43.749
 Oo 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:47.220
 Oh well 

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:49.220
 5v 2a 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.220
 U 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:59.380
 tee 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:59.380
 Be too late 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:06.979
 Le lead 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.979
 Sound 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.610
 U 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:19.480
 I have a melody line like this. 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:20.500
 Anyway , I always think of this melody line in my head 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:25.570
 You will. 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:31.410
 We will see, once the score before the code itself chord progression itself 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:31.410
 It's easy. For example, let's try to sell it with the code first. 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:49.350
 there was 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:49.350
 Next is all won 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:10.310
 we will be 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:14.180
 Negative things about this but the configuration of the Vegas 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:16.550
 Now, with one mouth and another code, code 1, this one 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:23.140
 When you put it together, it becomes a silver lining. 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:31.020
 Well coming coming 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:31.020
 Thank you. 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.870
 5 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:48.280
 222 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:52.500
 W 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.500
 U 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:04:02.599
 Pulley Iida 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:02.599
 I wrote it. 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:11.220
 Such a break 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:12.690
 He said, I've become connected to the tower reflux and a little bit wrong minutes 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:17.160
 I would definitely gyesil 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:24.210
 Uh, once you look at the tower and try the fast 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:26.750
 Uh, where it would be better gatguyo more importantly, hold the c seed in maencheom 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:26.750
 U 

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:33.300
 222 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:33.300
 And 5'll come back 

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:36.680
 Ah 

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:40.039
 222 

00:04:40.529 --> 00:04:45.819
 Ah 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:47.969
 Do not forget to always remember the melody line. 

00:04:45.819 --> 00:04:47.969
 U 

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:58.670
 Why rat 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:05:06.190
 / b is displayed. 

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:06.190
 When looking back at the code, so it will end up being the opening of the line No. 1 

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:14.580
 Sound pattern slip surface, grasp the finger f son Hull be operate 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:17.969
 Is it difficult? 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:25.189
 With a little finger 

00:05:17.969 --> 00:05:25.189
 Whoa oh please my negative lead 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:27.710
 U 

00:05:29.599 --> 00:05:36.969
 # Give me what is 5 

00:05:37.339 --> 00:05:39.370
 5 

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:48.380
 U 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:56.580
 We can go over if you give us proper vocabulary. 

00:05:53.400 --> 00:06:03.000
 I'll take the explanation . 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:08.070
 In fact, also the equally inflammatory own because I was doing it the same 

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:09.600
 Abyss tackle the melody line instead of just keeping the atmosphere 

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:14.360
 Are exactly 

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:14.360
 Also if you like going to feel such practices Fayetteville
