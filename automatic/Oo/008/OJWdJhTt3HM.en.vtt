I've<00:00:03.909> seen<00:00:04.120> a<00:00:04.149> lot<00:00:04.330> about<00:00:04.630> front<00:00:05.439> license

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:05.830 
I've seen a lot about front license

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:08.330 
I've seen a lot about front license

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
plate zip ties all that stuff wanted to

plate zip ties all that stuff wanted to
show<00:00:09.340> everyone<00:00:09.610> my<00:00:09.910> solution<00:00:10.570> and<00:00:11.220> if<00:00:12.220> there's

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:12.460 
show everyone my solution and if there's

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:14.820 
show everyone my solution and if there's
interest<00:00:12.820> and<00:00:13.090> find<00:00:13.300> out<00:00:13.420> a<00:00:13.450> way<00:00:13.540> to<00:00:13.720> get<00:00:14.710> it

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:14.830 
interest and find out a way to get it

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:17.130 
interest and find out a way to get it
made<00:00:15.010> I<00:00:15.070> guess<00:00:15.190> that<00:00:15.670> everyone<00:00:16.029> can<00:00:16.240> can

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:17.140 
made I guess that everyone can can

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:19.439 
made I guess that everyone can can
leverage<00:00:17.349> it<00:00:17.619> if<00:00:18.039> if<00:00:18.820> that's<00:00:19.000> what<00:00:19.240> you<00:00:19.300> want

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:19.449 
leverage it if if that's what you want

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:20.580 
leverage it if if that's what you want
to<00:00:19.539> go<00:00:19.660> we'll<00:00:19.960> start<00:00:20.170> with<00:00:20.260> the<00:00:20.320> end<00:00:20.470> in<00:00:20.530> mind

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:20.590 
to go we'll start with the end in mind

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:22.380 
to go we'll start with the end in mind
this<00:00:21.430> is<00:00:21.580> what<00:00:21.699> it<00:00:21.789> looks<00:00:21.970> like<00:00:22.090> with<00:00:22.300> the

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:22.390 
this is what it looks like with the

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:24.720 
this is what it looks like with the
plate<00:00:22.630> on<00:00:22.810> ideas<00:00:23.590> not<00:00:23.830> to<00:00:24.010> drive<00:00:24.340> with<00:00:24.520> it<00:00:24.640> on

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:24.730 
plate on ideas not to drive with it on

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:26.580 
plate on ideas not to drive with it on
just<00:00:25.000> put<00:00:25.240> it<00:00:25.300> on<00:00:25.359> to<00:00:25.570> avoid<00:00:25.660> tickets<00:00:26.230> take<00:00:26.470> it

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:26.590 
just put it on to avoid tickets take it

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:38.220 
just put it on to avoid tickets take it
off<00:00:26.730> what's<00:00:27.730> not<00:00:27.910> taking<00:00:28.210> it<00:00:28.270> off

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:38.230 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:41.900 

as<00:00:38.829> you<00:00:39.130> can<00:00:39.340> as<00:00:39.730> you<00:00:39.880> can<00:00:40.059> see<00:00:40.360> it's<00:00:41.110> a<00:00:41.410> pretty

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
as you can as you can see it's a pretty

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.280 
as you can as you can see it's a pretty
non-invasive<00:00:42.910> approach<00:00:43.030> very<00:00:43.660> hard<00:00:43.960> to<00:00:44.110> see

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:44.290 
non-invasive approach very hard to see

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:47.220 
non-invasive approach very hard to see
how<00:00:44.440> the<00:00:44.500> plate<00:00:44.800> actually<00:00:45.010> gets<00:00:45.400> mounted<00:00:46.230> it's

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:47.230 
how the plate actually gets mounted it's

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.460 
how the plate actually gets mounted it's
magnetic<00:00:47.800> so<00:00:48.340> again<00:00:49.120> you<00:00:49.720> want<00:00:49.870> to<00:00:49.989> see<00:00:50.350> the

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:50.470 
magnetic so again you want to see the

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:52.979 
magnetic so again you want to see the
plate<00:00:50.710> this<00:00:51.250> is<00:00:51.430> the<00:00:51.840> mounting<00:00:52.840> mechanism

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:52.989 
plate this is the mounting mechanism

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:56.340 
plate this is the mounting mechanism
it's<00:00:53.800> magnetic<00:00:54.360> on<00:00:55.360> the<00:00:55.510> inside<00:00:55.870> there<00:00:56.170> so

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:56.350 
it's magnetic on the inside there so

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.490 
it's magnetic on the inside there so
just<00:00:56.500> get<00:00:56.680> screwed<00:00:56.980> to<00:00:57.040> the<00:00:57.129> plate<00:00:58.350> magno<00:00:59.350> the

00:00:59.490 --> 00:00:59.500 
just get screwed to the plate magno the

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.220 
just get screwed to the plate magno the
back<00:00:59.680> it's<00:00:59.890> a<00:00:59.980> hitch<00:01:00.100> and<00:01:00.250> receiver<00:01:00.670> concept

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
back it's a hitch and receiver concept

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.930 
back it's a hitch and receiver concept
spent<00:01:02.230> a<00:01:02.440> lot<00:01:02.650> of<00:01:02.680> time<00:01:02.920> figuring<00:01:03.250> out<00:01:03.400> write

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:03.940 
spent a lot of time figuring out write

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.080 
spent a lot of time figuring out write
lines<00:01:04.210> right<00:01:04.540> distance<00:01:04.960> etc<00:01:05.500> but<00:01:06.090> works

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.090 
lines right distance etc but works

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:09.330 
lines right distance etc but works
pretty<00:01:07.300> good<00:01:07.420> for<00:01:07.780> me<00:01:07.900> give<00:01:08.590> a<00:01:08.619> close-up<00:01:09.310> look

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:09.340 
pretty good for me give a close-up look

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.150 
pretty good for me give a close-up look
here<00:01:09.790> and<00:01:09.909> then<00:01:10.500> maybe<00:01:11.500> show<00:01:11.770> you<00:01:11.830> a<00:01:11.950> little

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:12.160 
here and then maybe show you a little

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:13.859 
here and then maybe show you a little
bit<00:01:12.280> about<00:01:12.369> how<00:01:12.759> it<00:01:12.910> kind<00:01:13.180> of<00:01:13.240> installed<00:01:13.600> and

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:13.869 
bit about how it kind of installed and

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:27.910 
bit about how it kind of installed and
what<00:01:14.800> it<00:01:14.920> looks<00:01:15.070> like<00:01:15.220> from<00:01:15.460> there

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:35.280 

still<00:01:28.610> maybe<00:01:28.840> really<00:01:29.840> hard<00:01:30.050> to<00:01:30.200> see<00:01:32.500> but<00:01:33.500> I<00:01:34.000> can

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:35.290 
still maybe really hard to see but I can

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:38.200 
still maybe really hard to see but I can
show<00:01:36.290> you<00:01:36.350> what<00:01:36.590> the<00:01:36.820> install<00:01:37.820> would<00:01:38.030> look

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
show you what the install would look

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.920 
show you what the install would look
like<00:01:38.920> it<00:01:39.920> it's<00:01:40.790> comprised<00:01:41.300> of<00:01:41.540> a<00:01:41.660> couple

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:41.930 
like it it's comprised of a couple

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.280 
like it it's comprised of a couple
pieces<00:01:42.370> something<00:01:43.370> like<00:01:44.020> something<00:01:45.020> like

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:45.290 
pieces something like something like

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:46.789 
pieces something like something like
this

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
this

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.660 
this
and<00:01:47.189> see<00:01:47.400> that<00:01:47.610> there<00:01:48.680> it<00:01:49.680> gets<00:01:49.890> put<00:01:50.280> in<00:01:50.490> behind

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
and see that there it gets put in behind

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.170 
and see that there it gets put in behind
the<00:01:51.030> grill<00:01:51.680> put<00:01:52.680> a<00:01:52.740> little<00:01:52.970> put<00:01:53.970> a<00:01:54.000> little

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
the grill put a little put a little

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.550 
the grill put a little put a little
threadlocker<00:01:54.750> up<00:01:55.229> here<00:01:55.530> on<00:01:55.649> the<00:01:55.740> tip<00:01:55.979> and<00:01:56.220> then

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
threadlocker up here on the tip and then

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.149 
threadlocker up here on the tip and then
assemble<00:01:58.560> this<00:01:58.770> on<00:01:59.070> that<00:02:00.530> use<00:02:01.530> that<00:02:01.770> as<00:02:01.979> kind

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
assemble this on that use that as kind

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.670 
assemble this on that use that as kind
of<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.460> assembly<00:02:03.149> it<00:02:03.390> sits<00:02:03.630> like<00:02:03.720> this<00:02:03.840> I'll

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
of the assembly it sits like this I'll

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:05.719 
of the assembly it sits like this I'll
show<00:02:04.830> you<00:02:04.920> what<00:02:05.009> it<00:02:05.070> looks<00:02:05.220> like<00:02:05.310> on<00:02:05.460> the<00:02:05.580> car

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
show you what it looks like on the car

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.839 
show you what it looks like on the car
in<00:02:05.820> a<00:02:05.880> second<00:02:06.240> and<00:02:06.869> you<00:02:07.860> just<00:02:08.039> you<00:02:08.519> tighten

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
in a second and you just you tighten

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.540 
in a second and you just you tighten
this<00:02:08.970> down<00:02:09.030> keep<00:02:09.720> tightening<00:02:10.099> until<00:02:11.099> you've

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
this down keep tightening until you've

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.850 
this down keep tightening until you've
got<00:02:11.670> a<00:02:11.700> nice<00:02:11.849> flush<00:02:12.300> tight<00:02:12.599> finish<00:02:12.870> let<00:02:13.590> it<00:02:13.709> sit

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
got a nice flush tight finish let it sit

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.070 
got a nice flush tight finish let it sit
overnight<00:02:13.890> for<00:02:14.459> the<00:02:14.489> threadlocker<00:02:15.030> to<00:02:15.300> lock

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
overnight for the threadlocker to lock

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.140 
overnight for the threadlocker to lock
up<00:02:16.319> and<00:02:16.470> take<00:02:16.620> effect<00:02:17.010> then<00:02:17.610> you<00:02:17.730> back<00:02:17.940> this

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
up and take effect then you back this

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.259 
up and take effect then you back this
off<00:02:18.380> spins<00:02:19.380> right<00:02:19.590> out<00:02:19.830> and<00:02:20.640> then<00:02:20.940> you<00:02:21.000> put<00:02:21.090> a

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:21.269 
off spins right out and then you put a

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:25.550 
off spins right out and then you put a
tip<00:02:21.510> in<00:02:22.910> we've<00:02:23.910> got<00:02:24.060> one<00:02:24.239> that<00:02:24.420> that<00:02:24.870> the<00:02:25.290> tips

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
tip in we've got one that that the tips

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.120 
tip in we've got one that that the tips
are<00:02:25.739> kind<00:02:25.920> of<00:02:26.010> long<00:02:26.940> apologize<00:02:27.720> for<00:02:28.019> the<00:02:28.170> kooky

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
are kind of long apologize for the kooky

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:30.740

on that guy and there you have the

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:43.160 
on that guy and there you have the
finished<00:02:40.470> assembly<00:02:40.910> and<00:02:41.910> as<00:02:42.060> I<00:02:42.239> showed<00:02:42.390> this

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
finished assembly and as I showed this

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.710 
finished assembly and as I showed this
is<00:02:43.290> a<00:02:43.319> magnetic<00:02:43.680> guy<00:02:44.010> like<00:02:44.610> this<00:02:44.880> let's<00:02:45.599> get

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
is a magnetic guy like this let's get

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.449 
is a magnetic guy like this let's get
secured<00:02:46.019> to<00:02:46.080> the<00:02:46.170> front<00:02:46.349> of<00:02:46.410> the<00:02:46.470> plate<00:02:46.680> slides

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
secured to the front of the plate slides

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:48.710 
secured to the front of the plate slides
in<00:02:47.700> snaps<00:02:48.269> into<00:02:48.450> place

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
in snaps into place

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.530 
in snaps into place
comes<00:02:49.200> right<00:02:49.380> off<00:02:50.000> magnetic<00:02:51.000> to<00:02:51.120> hold<00:02:51.299> it<00:02:51.420> in

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
comes right off magnetic to hold it in

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.330 
comes right off magnetic to hold it in
and<00:02:51.690> lock<00:02:51.810> it<00:02:51.989> in<00:02:52.109> while<00:02:52.350> you're<00:02:52.470> driving<00:02:52.890> in

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
and lock it in while you're driving in

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.580 
and lock it in while you're driving in
the<00:02:53.579> event<00:02:53.790> you<00:02:53.880> forget<00:02:54.180> to<00:02:54.420> take<00:02:54.810> it<00:02:54.840> out<00:02:55.079> but

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
the event you forget to take it out but

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.680 
the event you forget to take it out but
again<00:02:56.340> the<00:02:56.579> idea<00:02:56.790> is<00:02:56.820> not<00:02:57.000> to<00:02:57.060> drive<00:02:57.359> with<00:02:57.540> it

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
again the idea is not to drive with it

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.990 
again the idea is not to drive with it
on<00:02:57.810> so<00:02:58.590> if<00:02:59.160> you<00:02:59.250> want<00:02:59.280> to<00:02:59.430> see<00:02:59.609> what<00:02:59.760> it<00:02:59.820> looks

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
on so if you want to see what it looks

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.140 
on so if you want to see what it looks
like<00:03:00.209> a<00:03:00.239> little<00:03:00.420> bit<00:03:00.570> more<00:03:01.910> after<00:03:02.910> the

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
like a little bit more after the

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.449 
like a little bit more after the
overnight<00:03:03.540> times<00:03:03.870> you<00:03:04.079> more<00:03:04.890> than<00:03:05.010> happy<00:03:05.310> to

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
overnight times you more than happy to

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:25.220 
overnight times you more than happy to
to<00:03:06.150> show<00:03:06.359> that<00:03:06.570> here

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:26.750 

that's<00:03:25.800> basically<00:03:26.190> what<00:03:26.400> it<00:03:26.489> would<00:03:26.580> look<00:03:26.700> like

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
that's basically what it would look like

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.600 
that's basically what it would look like
after<00:03:27.530> so<00:03:28.530> you<00:03:28.560> install<00:03:28.950> it<00:03:29.160> spin<00:03:29.400> it<00:03:29.430> on

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
after so you install it spin it on

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:31.430 
after so you install it spin it on
tighten<00:03:30.120> it<00:03:30.180> down<00:03:30.209> let<00:03:31.080> it<00:03:31.200> sit<00:03:31.379> overnight

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
tighten it down let it sit overnight

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.759 
tighten it down let it sit overnight
come<00:03:32.280> out<00:03:32.430> this<00:03:32.790> is<00:03:32.910> what<00:03:33.060> it<00:03:33.150> looks<00:03:33.330> like<00:03:33.769> just

a couple other considerations here I'll
put<00:03:55.489> the<00:03:55.519> fleet<00:03:55.730> back<00:03:55.879> on<00:03:56.090> it<00:03:56.180> so<00:03:56.269> let's<00:03:56.450> see

00:03:56.559 --> 00:03:56.569 
put the fleet back on it so let's see

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:03.250 
put the fleet back on it so let's see
how<00:03:56.629> that<00:03:56.719> works<00:04:00.189> right<00:04:01.189> like<00:04:01.340> that<00:04:02.260> you'll

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:03.260 
how that works right like that you'll

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:04.479 
how that works right like that you'll
notice<00:04:03.439> the<00:04:03.590> two<00:04:03.739> camps<00:04:04.040> are<00:04:04.159> on<00:04:04.249> the<00:04:04.340> bottom

notice the two camps are on the bottom

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:06.309 
notice the two camps are on the bottom
of<00:04:04.670> the<00:04:04.760> plate<00:04:04.999> and<00:04:05.540> the<00:04:05.719> winner<00:04:05.930> here<00:04:06.200> in

00:04:06.309 --> 00:04:06.319 
of the plate and the winner here in

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:08.500 
of the plate and the winner here in
Chicago<00:04:06.859> the<00:04:07.219> tips<00:04:07.849> of<00:04:07.999> these<00:04:08.060> guys<00:04:08.299> because

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:48.410 
anyway a couple other things I guess I'd

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:50.560 
anyway a couple other things I guess I'd
say<00:04:48.650> is<00:04:48.800> that<00:04:49.009> you<00:04:49.550> could<00:04:49.729> put<00:04:50.000> those<00:04:50.180> pins

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:50.570 
say is that you could put those pins

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:57.020 
them down in there you could line up

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:00.040 
them down in there you could line up
with<00:04:57.380> like<00:04:58.310> a<00:04:58.340> toll<00:04:58.639> collector<00:04:59.150> I<00:04:59.360> don't<00:04:59.659> use
