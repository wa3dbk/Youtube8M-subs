00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
chance to flip rip and win and I've been

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.980 
chance to flip rip and win and I've been
waiting<00:01:13.650> so<00:01:14.040> long<00:01:14.070> to<00:01:14.640> open<00:01:14.790> this<00:01:15.119> -<00:01:15.420> to<00:01:15.869> know

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
waiting so long to open this - to know

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.140 
waiting so long to open this - to know
if<00:01:16.110> I<00:01:16.200> won<00:01:16.409> or<00:01:16.439> not<00:01:16.729> so<00:01:17.729> flip<00:01:19.610> rip<00:01:20.610> I<00:01:20.880> think<00:01:21.090> I

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
if I won or not so flip rip I think I

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.609 
if I won or not so flip rip I think I
say<00:01:21.299> open<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.540> top<00:01:21.780> I<00:01:21.930> don't<00:01:22.380> think<00:01:22.560> you

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
say open the top I don't think you

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.230 
say open the top I don't think you
actually<00:01:22.710> need<00:01:22.950> to<00:01:23.100> flip<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.340> bottle<00:01:23.790> to<00:01:23.939> open

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
actually need to flip the bottle to open

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.990 
actually need to flip the bottle to open
at<00:01:24.390> me<00:01:24.509> I<00:01:25.220> want<00:01:26.220> to<00:01:26.250> make<00:01:26.340> sure<00:01:26.400> everything<00:01:26.880> the

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
at me I want to make sure everything the

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.340 
at me I want to make sure everything the
bottoms<00:01:27.360> gets<00:01:27.689> makes<00:01:27.960> sense<00:01:29.240> so<00:01:30.240> this<00:01:31.170> is<00:01:31.290> a

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
bottoms gets makes sense so this is a

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.230 
bottoms gets makes sense so this is a
really<00:01:31.530> weird<00:01:31.829> opening<00:01:32.610> at<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:32.759> top<00:01:32.850> here

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
really weird opening at the top here

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.960 
really weird opening at the top here
it's<00:01:33.390> not<00:01:33.540> like<00:01:33.659> a<00:01:33.750> normal<00:01:34.049> twist<00:01:34.320> or<00:01:34.560> anything

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:34.970 
it's not like a normal twist or anything

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.550 
it's not like a normal twist or anything
as<00:01:35.970> you<00:01:36.150> can<00:01:36.299> see<00:01:36.450> it's<00:01:36.600> just<00:01:36.659> pull<00:01:36.960> out

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
as you can see it's just pull out

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.039 
as you can see it's just pull out
I<00:01:37.909> think<00:01:38.909> up<00:01:39.030> I<00:01:39.240> think<00:01:39.360> that's<00:01:39.600> part<00:01:39.900> of<00:01:39.960> the

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
I think up I think that's part of the

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.289 
I think up I think that's part of the
flipping<00:01:40.500> and<00:01:40.650> ripping<00:01:41.009> that<00:01:41.790> is<00:01:41.970> probably

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
flipping and ripping that is probably

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.270 
flipping and ripping that is probably
part<00:01:42.540> of<00:01:42.570> living<00:01:43.020> so<00:01:43.320> I<00:01:43.619> have<00:01:43.920> to<00:01:44.040> kind<00:01:44.220> of

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
part of living so I have to kind of

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:50.929 
part of living so I have to kind of
stick<00:01:44.549> my<00:01:44.850> finger<00:01:45.210> in<00:01:45.540> here<00:01:48.439> rip<00:01:49.439> rip<00:01:50.130> rip<00:01:50.520> and

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
stick my finger in here rip rip rip and

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.679 
stick my finger in here rip rip rip and
then<00:01:51.119> it's<00:01:51.960> ripped

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:53.689 
then it's ripped
