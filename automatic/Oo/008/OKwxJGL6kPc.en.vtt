hi I'm Mike Patrick and this is how to
do<00:00:07.379> a<00:00:07.410> pivot<00:00:07.799> cut<00:00:08.130> it<00:00:08.400> looks<00:00:08.639> like<00:00:08.790> this<00:00:09.000> and

you can do it in both hands like so boom

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:17.689 
you can do it in both hands like so boom
the<00:00:15.750> grip<00:00:16.080> is<00:00:16.350> that<00:00:17.039> you<00:00:17.130> got<00:00:17.310> to<00:00:17.340> get<00:00:17.490> into<00:00:17.609> a

the grip is that you got to get into a
straddle<00:00:18.240> grip<00:00:18.480> a<00:00:18.630> straddle<00:00:19.050> grip<00:00:19.289> means<00:00:19.560> that

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
straddle grip a straddle grip means that

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.519 
straddle grip a straddle grip means that
your<00:00:20.160> index<00:00:21.060> finger<00:00:21.449> and<00:00:21.630> your<00:00:21.779> pinky<00:00:21.930> are<00:00:22.289> on

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
your index finger and your pinky are on

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.259 
your index finger and your pinky are on
the<00:00:22.680> opposite<00:00:23.070> sides<00:00:23.369> of<00:00:23.550> the<00:00:23.670> deck<00:00:23.820> more<00:00:24.150> or

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
the opposite sides of the deck more or

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.000 
the opposite sides of the deck more or
less<00:00:24.449> in<00:00:24.630> the<00:00:24.720> center<00:00:24.930> of<00:00:25.230> each<00:00:25.380> packet<00:00:25.830> and

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
less in the center of each packet and

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.910 
less in the center of each packet and
your<00:00:26.720> middle<00:00:27.720> and<00:00:27.960> ring<00:00:28.109> fingers<00:00:28.470> are<00:00:28.650> on<00:00:28.769> one

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
your middle and ring fingers are on one

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.650 
your middle and ring fingers are on one
edge<00:00:29.039> and<00:00:29.279> your<00:00:29.460> thumb<00:00:29.670> is<00:00:29.849> on<00:00:29.880> the<00:00:30.179> other<00:00:30.269> so

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
edge and your thumb is on the other so

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.130 
edge and your thumb is on the other so
this<00:00:30.810> creates<00:00:31.230> a<00:00:31.439> very<00:00:31.489> very<00:00:32.489> secure<00:00:33.480> grip<00:00:33.930> for

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
this creates a very very secure grip for

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.770 
this creates a very very secure grip for
the<00:00:34.170> cards<00:00:34.620> your<00:00:35.489> thumb<00:00:35.850> is<00:00:36.090> going<00:00:36.270> to<00:00:36.390> come<00:00:36.630> to

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
the cards your thumb is going to come to

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.619 
the cards your thumb is going to come to
the<00:00:36.870> lower<00:00:37.140> left<00:00:37.920> hand<00:00:38.129> corner<00:00:38.250> and<00:00:38.760> break<00:00:39.390> at

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
the lower left hand corner and break at

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:40.970 
the lower left hand corner and break at
about<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:40.079> halfway<00:00:40.320> point

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
about the halfway point

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.049 
about the halfway point
you're<00:00:41.820> then<00:00:42.000> going<00:00:42.210> to<00:00:42.300> stretch<00:00:43.550> these<00:00:44.550> cards

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
you're then going to stretch these cards

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.729 
you're then going to stretch these cards
and<00:00:45.210> you're<00:00:45.600> trying<00:00:45.870> to<00:00:45.960> get<00:00:46.050> your<00:00:46.200> thumb<00:00:46.530> and

and you're trying to get your thumb and

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.220 
and you're trying to get your thumb and
your<00:00:47.520> pinky<00:00:47.910> to<00:00:48.059> be<00:00:48.180> as<00:00:48.270> far<00:00:48.690> away<00:00:48.719> from<00:00:48.960> each

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
your pinky to be as far away from each

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.380 
your pinky to be as far away from each
other<00:00:49.469> as<00:00:49.680> possible<00:00:50.280> and<00:00:50.489> then<00:00:50.969> you<00:00:51.000> simply

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
other as possible and then you simply

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.270 
other as possible and then you simply
bring<00:00:51.629> reverse<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.469> action<00:00:52.590> bringing<00:00:53.160> the

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
bring reverse the action bringing the

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.610 
bring reverse the action bringing the
thumb<00:00:53.489> back<00:00:53.730> and<00:00:54.059> you<00:00:54.629> should<00:00:54.809> end<00:00:54.989> in<00:00:55.379> the

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
thumb back and you should end in the

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.319 
thumb back and you should end in the
same<00:00:55.860> type<00:00:56.160> of<00:00:56.190> position<00:00:56.760> you<00:00:56.850> were<00:00:56.940> to<00:00:57.090> begin

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
same type of position you were to begin

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.990 
same type of position you were to begin
with<00:00:57.710> when<00:00:58.710> you're<00:00:58.829> doing<00:00:59.129> these<00:00:59.280> for<00:00:59.579> speed

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
with when you're doing these for speed

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.760 
with when you're doing these for speed
you're<00:01:00.300> going<00:01:00.539> to<00:01:00.629> try<00:01:00.870> to<00:01:00.899> get<00:01:01.170> your<00:01:01.260> recovery

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
you're going to try to get your recovery

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.640 
you're going to try to get your recovery
time<00:01:01.940> so<00:01:02.940> that<00:01:03.120> you<00:01:03.210> can<00:01:03.390> get<00:01:03.570> this<00:01:03.809> going<00:01:04.350> as

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
time so that you can get this going as

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.890 
time so that you can get this going as
quickly<00:01:05.189> as<00:01:05.430> you<00:01:05.460> can<00:01:05.580> and<00:01:06.000> do<00:01:06.270> as<00:01:06.420> many<00:01:06.630> as<00:01:06.780> you

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
quickly as you can and do as many as you

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.070 
quickly as you can and do as many as you
can<00:01:07.020> in<00:01:07.320> a<00:01:07.380> row<00:01:08.450> that's<00:01:09.450> what<00:01:09.689> makes<00:01:09.840> it<00:01:09.960> look

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
can in a row that's what makes it look

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.660 
can in a row that's what makes it look
less<00:01:10.290> sloppy<00:01:10.590> you<00:01:10.770> can<00:01:10.920> do<00:01:11.010> them<00:01:11.159> in<00:01:11.220> each<00:01:11.369> hand

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
less sloppy you can do them in each hand

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.700 
less sloppy you can do them in each hand
when<00:01:12.000> you're<00:01:12.119> starting<00:01:12.479> and<00:01:12.900> even<00:01:13.439> when<00:01:13.560> I<00:01:13.590> do

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
when you're starting and even when I do

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.859 
when you're starting and even when I do
it<00:01:13.950> in<00:01:14.040> general<00:01:14.280> I<00:01:14.640> usually<00:01:15.270> do<00:01:15.420> it<00:01:15.540> with<00:01:15.659> half

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
it in general I usually do it with half

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.240 
it in general I usually do it with half
the<00:01:16.049> deck<00:01:16.229> because<00:01:16.439> I'm<00:01:16.560> usually<00:01:16.740> doing<00:01:17.159> it

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
the deck because I'm usually doing it

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.590 
the deck because I'm usually doing it
double<00:01:17.580> handed<00:01:17.970> you'll<00:01:18.150> probably<00:01:18.360> have<00:01:18.570> a

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
double handed you'll probably have a

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.080 
double handed you'll probably have a
much<00:01:18.810> easier<00:01:18.990> time<00:01:19.320> if<00:01:19.770> you<00:01:20.189> use<00:01:20.220> fewer<00:01:20.700> cards

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
much easier time if you use fewer cards

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.109 
much easier time if you use fewer cards
and<00:01:21.330> an<00:01:21.420> entire<00:01:21.750> deck<00:01:22.110> at<00:01:22.350> first<00:01:23.009> so<00:01:23.909> once

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
and an entire deck at first so once

as you can go hand flexibility helps you

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.090 
as you can go hand flexibility helps you
greatly<00:01:45.329> in<00:01:45.509> this<00:01:45.780> if<00:01:46.020> you<00:01:46.409> just<00:01:46.560> hold<00:01:46.920> the

cards like this not even practicing them
cut<00:01:48.930> your<00:01:49.350> fingers<00:01:49.860> will<00:01:50.070> eventually<00:01:50.520> get

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
cut your fingers will eventually get

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.639 
cut your fingers will eventually get
much<00:01:50.909> more<00:01:51.119> flexible<00:01:51.810> and<00:01:52.049> you'll<00:01:52.380> have<00:01:52.530> an

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
much more flexible and you'll have an

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.130 
much more flexible and you'll have an
easier<00:01:53.009> time<00:01:53.070> doing<00:01:53.520> it<00:01:53.820> so<00:01:53.939> every<00:01:54.270> time<00:01:54.509> you

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
easier time doing it so every time you

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.649 
easier time doing it so every time you
do<00:01:55.259> like<00:01:55.409> five<00:01:55.680> of<00:01:55.710> them<00:01:56.240> do<00:01:57.240> one<00:01:57.420> where<00:01:57.570> you

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
do like five of them do one where you

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.010 
do like five of them do one where you
hold<00:01:57.930> it<00:01:58.170> and<00:01:58.350> then<00:01:59.159> you<00:01:59.310> you<00:01:59.670> finish<00:02:00.030> it<00:02:00.270> the

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
hold it and then you you finish it the

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.719 
hold it and then you you finish it the
best<00:02:01.229> way<00:02:01.380> of<00:02:01.409> practicing<00:02:02.009> this<00:02:02.130> is<00:02:02.310> if<00:02:02.430> you<00:02:02.520> do

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
best way of practicing this is if you do

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.109 
best way of practicing this is if you do
about<00:02:03.420> when<00:02:04.320> you<00:02:04.439> wake<00:02:04.590> up<00:02:04.909> 10:30<00:02:05.909> in<00:02:06.090> the

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
about when you wake up 10:30 in the

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.440 
about when you wake up 10:30 in the
morning<00:02:06.240> and<00:02:06.689> then<00:02:06.780> 10<00:02:07.110> to<00:02:07.259> 30<00:02:07.500> at<00:02:07.740> night

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
morning and then 10 to 30 at night

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.389 
morning and then 10 to 30 at night
you<00:02:08.509> will<00:02:08.660> eventually<00:02:08.929> get<00:02:09.440> a<00:02:09.500> very<00:02:09.920> clean

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
you will eventually get a very clean

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:15.190 
you will eventually get a very clean
very<00:02:10.429> fast<00:02:11.239> pivot<00:02:11.660> cut<00:02:11.840> you<00:02:12.560> have<00:02:12.709> a<00:02:12.739> great<00:02:12.980> day
