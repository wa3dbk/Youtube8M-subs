00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
they're not as great as some of the

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.600 
they're not as great as some of the
other<00:02:20.989> in<00:02:21.319> box<00:02:21.530> headphones<00:02:21.920> we've<00:02:22.160> seen<00:02:22.370> over

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.890 
the years but inside the box there
really<00:02:24.590> isn't<00:02:25.160> much<00:02:25.370> to<00:02:25.819> get<00:02:25.940> excited<00:02:26.450> over<00:02:26.569> I

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
really isn't much to get excited over I

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.070 
really isn't much to get excited over I
always<00:02:27.739> say<00:02:28.099> that<00:02:28.129> but<00:02:28.510> really<00:02:29.510> all<00:02:29.870> we<00:02:30.050> ever

it's always the same thing the phone

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.070 
it's always the same thing the phone
itself<00:02:36.290> feels<00:02:36.620> really

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:20.740 
megapixel camera that is not optically

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:22.320 
megapixel camera that is not optically
stabilized<00:03:21.250> it's<00:03:21.550> just<00:03:21.730> a<00:03:21.850> standard<00:03:22.150> 8

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:22.330

stabilized it's just a standard 8
megapixel<00:03:22.840> camera<00:03:22.870> and<00:03:23.320> you<00:03:23.890> don't<00:03:23.920> get<00:03:24.250> a<00:03:24.310> 5

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:24.580 
megapixel camera and you don't get a 5

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:26.070

megapixel<00:03:25.120> camera<00:03:25.150> on<00:03:25.360> the<00:03:25.480> front<00:03:25.750> this<00:03:25.900> one

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:26.080 
megapixel camera on the front this one

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.290 
megapixel camera on the front this one
is<00:03:26.260> 1.3<00:03:27.220> megapixels<00:03:27.790> if<00:03:27.910> I<00:03:27.970> remember

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:28.300 
is 1.3 megapixels if I remember

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:32.610 
is 1.3 megapixels if I remember
correctly<00:03:29.280> the<00:03:30.280> display<00:03:30.730> is<00:03:31.020> 4.7<00:03:32.020> inches<00:03:32.410> and

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
correctly the display is 4.7 inches and

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.470 
correctly the display is 4.7 inches and
it's<00:03:32.800> a<00:03:32.920> qHD<00:03:33.340> resolution<00:03:33.580> so<00:03:34.270> you're<00:03:34.390> not

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
it's a qHD resolution so you're not

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.240 
it's a qHD resolution so you're not
getting<00:03:34.810> a<00:03:34.900> very<00:03:35.110> high<00:03:35.350> resolution<00:03:35.620> display

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
getting a very high resolution display

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.760 
getting a very high resolution display
especially<00:03:36.490> not<00:03:36.850> by<00:03:37.030> today's<00:03:37.360> standards<00:03:37.840> but

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:38.770 
especially not by today's standards but

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:40.980 
especially not by today's standards but
as<00:03:39.640> you<00:03:39.760> can<00:03:39.850> see<00:03:39.940> also<00:03:40.180> there's<00:03:40.630> a<00:03:40.690> lot<00:03:40.870> of

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:40.990 
as you can see also there's a lot of

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:42.720 
as you can see also there's a lot of
bezel<00:03:41.230> around<00:03:41.620> the<00:03:41.950> display<00:03:42.160> on<00:03:42.400> this<00:03:42.550> phone

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 
bezel around the display on this phone

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:45.930 
bezel around the display on this phone
so<00:03:42.910> it's<00:03:43.030> clearly<00:03:43.480> not<00:03:43.810> one<00:03:44.800> of<00:03:44.950> HTC's<00:03:45.670> most

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:45.940 
so it's clearly not one of HTC's most

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.240 
so it's clearly not one of HTC's most
high-end<00:03:46.360> handsets<00:03:46.660> this<00:03:46.989> is<00:03:47.140> basically<00:03:48.100> your

high-end handsets this is basically your

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.990 
high-end handsets this is basically your

HTC handset for 2014 and the internals

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.130 
HTC handset for 2014 and the internals
are<00:03:53.140> really<00:03:53.500> an<00:03:53.680> indicator<00:03:54.100> if<00:03:54.250> that<00:03:54.430> is<00:03:54.730> well

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
are really an indicator if that is well

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:57.270 
are really an indicator if that is well
inside<00:03:56.140> you're<00:03:56.320> only<00:03:56.470> going<00:03:56.590> to<00:03:56.650> get<00:03:56.769> one<00:03:57.070> gig

inside you're only going to get one gig

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.000 
inside you're only going to get one gig

of ram eight gigabytes of storage though
you<00:04:00.070> do<00:04:00.310> have<00:04:00.340> that<00:04:00.790> micro<00:04:01.060> SD<00:04:01.330> card<00:04:01.570> slot

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:01.630 
you do have that micro SD card slot

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:04.250 
you do have that micro SD card slot
which<00:04:02.019> supports<00:04:02.410> up<00:04:02.530> to<00:04:02.560> 128<00:04:03.459> gigabytes<00:04:03.580> of

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
which supports up to 128 gigabytes of

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.520 
which supports up to 128 gigabytes of
additional<00:04:05.260> storage<00:04:06.870> it<00:04:07.870> also<00:04:08.019> has<00:04:08.320> a

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 
additional storage it also has a

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.759 
additional storage it also has a
Snapdragon<00:04:09.130> 400<00:04:09.850> SOC<00:04:10.600> and<00:04:10.840> that<00:04:11.560> is<00:04:11.739> a

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:11.769 
Snapdragon 400 SOC and that is a

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:15.210 
Snapdragon 400 SOC and that is a
quad-core<00:04:12.130> CPU<00:04:13.060> clocked<00:04:13.450> at<00:04:13.720> 1.2<00:04:14.470> gigahertz<00:04:14.890> I

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
quad-core CPU clocked at 1.2 gigahertz I

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:18.150 
quad-core CPU clocked at 1.2 gigahertz I
believe<00:04:15.930> so<00:04:16.930> you're<00:04:17.410> getting<00:04:17.650> basically

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.160 
believe so you're getting basically

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.240 
believe so you're getting basically
bottom<00:04:19.150> of<00:04:19.390> the<00:04:19.570> bucket<00:04:19.720> specifications<00:04:20.680> but

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.250 
bottom of the bucket specifications but

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:24.080 
bottom of the bucket specifications but
you're<00:04:21.609> also<00:04:21.760> gonna<00:04:21.940> save<00:04:22.330> and<00:04:23.140> cost<00:04:23.530> as<00:04:23.860> well

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
you're also gonna save and cost as well

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.330 
you're also gonna save and cost as well
so<00:04:25.090> you<00:04:25.990> don't<00:04:26.290> expect<00:04:26.590> too<00:04:26.830> much<00:04:26.979> out<00:04:27.160> of<00:04:27.190> this

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:27.340 
so you don't expect too much out of this

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:29.490 
so you don't expect too much out of this
phone<00:04:27.550> also<00:04:27.790> the<00:04:28.120> battery<00:04:28.390> inside<00:04:28.870> before<00:04:29.320> I

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:29.500 
phone also the battery inside before I

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.370 
phone also the battery inside before I
forget<00:04:29.650> is<00:04:30.570> 2040<00:04:31.570> milliamp<00:04:31.930> hours<00:04:32.169> so<00:04:32.260> that's

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:32.380 
forget is 2040 milliamp hours so that's

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:35.730 
forget is 2040 milliamp hours so that's
2040<00:04:33.190> milliamp<00:04:33.520> hours<00:04:33.900> really<00:04:34.900> not<00:04:35.440> a<00:04:35.470> very

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:35.740 
2040 milliamp hours really not a very

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:37.770 
2040 milliamp hours really not a very
high<00:04:35.919> intense<00:04:36.280> that<00:04:36.490> will<00:04:36.729> we<00:04:37.210> I<00:04:37.240> think<00:04:37.450> we

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:37.780 
high intense that will we I think we

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:39.270 
high intense that will we I think we
have<00:04:37.930> some<00:04:38.110> devices<00:04:38.380> to<00:04:38.620> compare<00:04:38.919> to<00:04:39.070> but

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:39.280 
have some devices to compare to but

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.370 
have some devices to compare to but
really<00:04:40.060> quickly<00:04:40.390> we<00:04:40.479> can<00:04:40.570> do<00:04:40.720> a<00:04:40.750> little<00:04:41.080> size

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:41.380 
really quickly we can do a little size

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:45.000 
really quickly we can do a little size
comparison<00:04:41.729> this<00:04:42.729> is<00:04:42.940> the<00:04:43.060> 5-inch<00:04:43.650> one<00:04:44.650> m8

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:45.010 
comparison this is the 5-inch one m8

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:46.680 
comparison this is the 5-inch one m8
which<00:04:45.310> a<00:04:45.520> lot<00:04:45.700> of<00:04:45.729> people<00:04:45.880> are<00:04:46.120> saying<00:04:46.270> is<00:04:46.479> too

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:46.690 
which a lot of people are saying is too

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:48.900 
which a lot of people are saying is too
big<00:04:46.870> for<00:04:46.900> a<00:04:47.140> 5-inch<00:04:47.500> phone<00:04:47.770> it's<00:04:48.250> really<00:04:48.460> tall

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:48.910 
big for a 5-inch phone it's really tall

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:50.830 
big for a 5-inch phone it's really tall
this<00:04:49.300> one's<00:04:49.479> 4.7

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:50.840 
this one's 4.7

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.870 
this one's 4.7
it's<00:04:51.020> almost<00:04:51.290> the<00:04:51.590> same<00:04:51.770> exact<00:04:52.130> size<00:04:52.280> as<00:04:52.580> the

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:52.880 
it's almost the same exact size as the

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:56.560 
it's almost the same exact size as the
one<00:04:52.910> m8<00:04:53.270> so<00:04:54.040> that's<00:04:55.090> something<00:04:56.090> that<00:04:56.270> many

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:56.570 
one m8 so that's something that many

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:58.930 
one m8 so that's something that many
people<00:04:56.780> will<00:04:57.020> be<00:04:57.139> happy<00:04:57.470> about<00:04:57.560> we<00:04:58.520> also<00:04:58.699> have

00:04:58.930 --> 00:04:58.940 
people will be happy about we also have

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:02.230 
people will be happy about we also have
the<00:04:59.620> Moto<00:05:00.620> X<00:05:00.710> here<00:05:01.100> which<00:05:01.520> is<00:05:01.699> also<00:05:01.850> a<00:05:02.000> very

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:02.240 
the Moto X here which is also a very

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:05.020 
the Moto X here which is also a very
small<00:05:02.330> 4.7<00:05:03.290> inch<00:05:03.410> phone<00:05:03.590> and<00:05:03.889> you<00:05:04.550> can<00:05:04.699> see<00:05:04.850> the

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:05.030 
small 4.7 inch phone and you can see the

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:08.250 
small 4.7 inch phone and you can see the
size<00:05:05.210> difference<00:05:05.240> is<00:05:05.860> pretty<00:05:06.860> substantial<00:05:07.070> so

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:08.260 
size difference is pretty substantial so

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.080 
size difference is pretty substantial so
the<00:05:09.260> build<00:05:09.470> quality<00:05:09.710> and<00:05:10.070> in<00:05:10.580> the<00:05:10.699> hand<00:05:10.880> feel

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:11.090 
the build quality and in the hand feel

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:13.900 
the build quality and in the hand feel
is<00:05:11.470> really<00:05:12.470> not<00:05:12.770> that<00:05:12.830> great<00:05:13.220> so<00:05:13.550> far<00:05:13.729> I<00:05:13.790> mean

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:13.910 
is really not that great so far I mean

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:17.320 
is really not that great so far I mean
it's<00:05:14.470> it<00:05:15.470> feels<00:05:15.500> cheap<00:05:15.919> and<00:05:16.580> that's<00:05:16.699> partly

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:17.330 
it's it feels cheap and that's partly

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:18.969 
it's it feels cheap and that's partly
due<00:05:17.449> to<00:05:17.570> the<00:05:17.840> slick<00:05:18.080> plastic<00:05:18.530> which<00:05:18.650> we're<00:05:18.860> not

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:18.979 
due to the slick plastic which we're not

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:22.409 
due to the slick plastic which we're not
used<00:05:19.310> to<00:05:19.460> seeing<00:05:19.699> typically<00:05:20.210> on<00:05:20.360> HTC<00:05:20.990> phones

00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:22.419 
used to seeing typically on HTC phones

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:26.020 
used to seeing typically on HTC phones
but<00:05:23.419> yeah<00:05:23.570> it<00:05:23.780> looks<00:05:24.139> nice<00:05:24.639> around<00:05:25.639> front

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:26.030 
but yeah it looks nice around front

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:27.820 
but yeah it looks nice around front
where<00:05:26.330> it's<00:05:26.450> matte<00:05:26.750> finish<00:05:27.110> and<00:05:27.260> everything

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:27.830 
where it's matte finish and everything

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:30.490 
where it's matte finish and everything
despite<00:05:28.490> the<00:05:28.669> bezels<00:05:29.030> but<00:05:29.570> the<00:05:29.690> back<00:05:29.840> is<00:05:30.050> very

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:30.500 
despite the bezels but the back is very

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:33.640 
despite the bezels but the back is very
very<00:05:30.800> shiny<00:05:31.190> and<00:05:31.400> glossy<00:05:31.820> and<00:05:32.470> just<00:05:33.470> doesn't

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:33.650 
very shiny and glossy and just doesn't

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:36.610 
very shiny and glossy and just doesn't
feel<00:05:34.010> that<00:05:34.220> great<00:05:34.370> in<00:05:34.580> the<00:05:34.639> hand<00:05:34.790> so<00:05:35.620> we're

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:36.620 
feel that great in the hand so we're

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:38.320 
feel that great in the hand so we're
gonna<00:05:36.770> put<00:05:37.340> this<00:05:37.460> thing<00:05:37.520> to<00:05:37.790> the<00:05:37.880> test<00:05:38.060> we'll

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:38.330 
gonna put this thing to the test we'll

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:39.580 
gonna put this thing to the test we'll
compare<00:05:38.600> it<00:05:38.720> with<00:05:38.750> some<00:05:38.990> phones<00:05:39.229> we'll<00:05:39.440> do<00:05:39.560> a

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:39.590 
compare it with some phones we'll do a

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:41.680 
compare it with some phones we'll do a
full<00:05:39.860> review<00:05:39.979> and<00:05:40.460> maybe<00:05:41.330> some<00:05:41.570> other
