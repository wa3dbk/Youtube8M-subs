00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:53.230 
tint like these where you can try
something<00:02:50.570> like<00:02:50.660> this<00:02:50.870> which<00:02:51.170> is<00:02:51.410> a<00:02:51.770> stain<00:02:52.550> so

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:53.240 
something like this which is a stain so

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:54.850 
something like this which is a stain so
this<00:02:53.450> will<00:02:53.630> basically<00:02:53.840> stay<00:02:54.290> on<00:02:54.440> for<00:02:54.650> a<00:02:54.710> really

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 
this will basically stay on for a really

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.490 
this will basically stay on for a really
long<00:02:55.130> time<00:02:55.190> it's<00:02:56.000> a<00:02:56.180> bit<00:02:56.480> like<00:02:56.930> applying<00:02:57.380> a

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
long time it's a bit like applying a

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.440 
long time it's a bit like applying a
lipstick<00:02:57.950> so<00:02:58.190> you<00:02:58.280> got<00:02:58.460> quite<00:02:58.730> a<00:02:58.760> good<00:02:59.090> amount

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
lipstick so you got quite a good amount

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.420 
lipstick so you got quite a good amount
of<00:02:59.510> coverage<00:02:59.960> on<00:03:00.200> the<00:03:00.350> lips<00:03:00.560> but<00:03:00.800> you're<00:03:01.190> not

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
of coverage on the lips but you're not

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:02.620 
of coverage on the lips but you're not
gonna<00:03:01.610> have<00:03:01.790> to<00:03:01.910> keep<00:03:02.030> topping<00:03:02.240> it<00:03:02.540> up

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:02.630

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:03.730 
gonna have to keep topping it up
throughout<00:03:02.900> the<00:03:03.050> holes<00:03:03.200> next<00:03:03.350> I<00:03:03.560> have<00:03:03.710> some

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:03.740 
throughout the holes next I have some

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:05.470 
throughout the holes next I have some
add-ons<00:03:04.130> now<00:03:04.700> these<00:03:04.880> are<00:03:05.030> things<00:03:05.210> that<00:03:05.420> you

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480
