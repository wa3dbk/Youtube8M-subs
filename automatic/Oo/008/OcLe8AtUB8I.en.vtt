there<00:04:47.590> so<00:04:47.950> I<00:04:47.980> hope<00:04:48.340> you<00:04:48.550> can<00:04:48.760> forgive<00:04:49.300> me<00:04:49.540> I

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:49.720 
there so I hope you can forgive me I

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:53.520 
there so I hope you can forgive me I
wouldn't<00:04:50.350> make<00:04:50.560> a<00:04:50.620> good<00:04:51.300> Mason<00:04:52.300> I<00:04:52.420> guess<00:04:52.660> so

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:53.530 
wouldn't make a good Mason I guess so

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:55.710 
wouldn't make a good Mason I guess so
don't<00:04:53.770> ask<00:04:53.920> me<00:04:54.100> to<00:04:54.220> lay<00:04:54.850> a<00:04:54.880> brick<00:04:55.150> wall<00:04:55.390> any

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:55.720 
don't ask me to lay a brick wall any

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:58.080 
don't ask me to lay a brick wall any
time<00:04:55.990> soon<00:04:56.320> but<00:04:56.620> I<00:04:57.370> think<00:04:57.670> it<00:04:57.790> adds<00:04:57.940> a

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:58.090 
time soon but I think it adds a

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:00.090 
time soon but I think it adds a
character<00:04:58.570> to<00:04:58.720> the<00:04:58.810> cookie<00:04:59.170> so<00:04:59.380> I<00:04:59.410> think<00:04:59.650> we

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:00.100 
character to the cookie so I think we

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:15.300 
character to the cookie so I think we
can<00:05:00.280> live<00:05:00.520> with<00:05:00.700> that

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:15.310 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:17.730
