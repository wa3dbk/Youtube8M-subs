00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:27.940 
into consideration that she was very

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:33.390 
into consideration that she was very
very<00:01:28.240> blonde<00:01:28.630> before<00:01:29.909> and<00:01:31.590> that<00:01:32.590> can<00:01:32.890> lead<00:01:33.100> to

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:33.400 
very blonde before and that can lead to

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.310 
very blonde before and that can lead to
she<00:01:33.909> was<00:01:34.090> very<00:01:34.210> blond<00:01:34.540> before<00:01:34.900> and<00:01:35.170> then

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:35.320 
she was very blond before and then

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.980 
she was very blond before and then
intone<00:01:35.950> over<00:01:36.310> her<00:01:36.460> blond<00:01:36.729> with<00:01:37.360> this<00:01:37.570> darker

very<00:01:40.840> low<00:01:41.140> volume<00:01:41.470> peroxide<00:01:42.299> we're<00:01:43.299> using

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:43.479 
very low volume peroxide we're using

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:46.050 
very low volume peroxide we're using
just<00:01:43.810> 10<00:01:44.080> volume<00:01:44.590> with<00:01:44.770> our<00:01:44.920> liner<00:01:45.159> to<00:01:46.030> make

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
just 10 volume with our liner to make

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.649 
just 10 volume with our liner to make
sure<00:01:46.420> we<00:01:46.780> are<00:01:47.880> taking<00:01:48.880> the<00:01:48.970> integrity<00:01:49.479> of<00:01:49.510> her
