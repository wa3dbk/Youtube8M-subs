00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 After Chemnitz come the reaction February and is about ran and courage 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.740
 have won in 2006 - carried to a fifth place 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:11.389
 and still there 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:14.459
 of victims in MÃ¼nsingen 

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:17.459
 we could see who was the young Badura 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.329
 Jekel white pants dark complexion only noise from Australia 

00:00:25.069 --> 00:00:27.189
 Lecomte achieved victories 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:30.759
 not necessarily working in filigree technician 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.060
 and she left a mix that could beat us 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.120
 to the opening 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.120
 Splendor forced her against Bottrop 

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:51.750
 Werder had at the beginning of his career 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:52.790
 he wanted 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:57.030
 USD and Oceania the stage to get the ticket for the people 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.910
 but then it came a little differently 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.910
 when the Moroccan had it exclusively 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:11.650
 and Ivan z 80 strokes from BayWa Re and sda 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.700
 DotA sweeping show gone 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.700
 as he once 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.680
 is over 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.520
 We had to get stronger so we had to see nature's body so different on July 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.490
 Hostages would have to be merged 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:53.330
 despite this quarterfinal here 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.670
 Presented to Serentschy 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.670
 fell in the goal 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.350
 as the two defend against the reform who buys the most beautiful goals 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.739
 a special charm a favorite of the masses 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:11.739
 Clowns would probably be able to gain in the episode 

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:16.559
 busy with grandiose 

00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:43.919
 I want as a counter good choice over Marions 

00:02:43.919 --> 00:02:47.149
 It looks like Peter Bremer Intel 

00:02:47.149 --> 00:02:49.329
 that this step is the speech 

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:52.329
 plug in 

00:03:17.679 --> 00:03:19.569
 Phil 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:23.079
 she does not sing them they are important 

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:30.409
 until the 1st 

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:06.019
 There is nothing here 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:10.439
 but at that time already very ambitious the press conference he had a relative 

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:13.439
 great miracle 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:19.069
 Constantini in the first round of the tournament 

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:21.180
 Pulz 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.660
 technically safe this concludes better than Bottrop II though 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:28.360
 Low eye 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:29.659
 Market leader 

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:32.680
 Justus Frantz 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.680
 reading is 

00:04:37.819 --> 00:04:40.569
 Anniversary, the three see the same reason 

00:04:40.569 --> 00:04:43.659
 Vienna in Schleiden end but until 7 

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:46.659
 full on a very balanced duel 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:50.199
 Scenes of good possibility 

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:52.419
 But I have villagers 

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:55.419
 loaded 

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:00.240
 Chemnitz 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.240
 Student meeting 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:12.379
 It almost looks like it is 

00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:15.379
 take in a lot in this second round 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:19.819
 she captured Dieter Graumann 

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:22.819
 after almost music is at Ferrari 

00:05:36.279 --> 00:05:38.409
 but in the forward movement 

00:05:38.409 --> 00:05:41.409
 SV Bad Nauheim II strongest 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:48.620
 both did not give anything away Kafka is fighting 

00:05:51.569 --> 00:05:54.569
 a fighting bull the spectators like it 

00:05:57.889 --> 00:06:01.270
 of course it's hard to get Australian titles 

00:06:12.499 --> 00:06:15.499
 Keeper Drobny 

00:06:20.259 --> 00:06:28.080
 this spectacular txtr she is looking for Ferrari cafe 40 euros 

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:29.930
 voluntary 

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:33.840
 until she she she that you
