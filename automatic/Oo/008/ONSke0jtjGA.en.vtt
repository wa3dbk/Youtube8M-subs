00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:07.480 

now<00:00:04.390> we<00:00:05.390> need<00:00:05.509> to<00:00:05.540> make<00:00:05.689> some<00:00:05.840> cross<00:00:06.370> braces<00:00:07.370> on

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:07.490 
now we need to make some cross braces on

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:09.640 
now we need to make some cross braces on
the<00:00:07.580> bottom<00:00:08.080> because<00:00:09.080> we<00:00:09.260> don't<00:00:09.410> want<00:00:09.559> these

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:09.650 
the bottom because we don't want these

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:11.940 
the bottom because we don't want these
legs<00:00:09.980> to<00:00:10.309> eventually<00:00:10.910> get<00:00:11.269> more<00:00:11.509> and<00:00:11.629> out<00:00:11.749> and

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:11.950 
legs to eventually get more and out and

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:14.680 
legs to eventually get more and out and
push<00:00:12.950> it<00:00:13.099> out<00:00:13.160> from<00:00:13.339> underneath<00:00:13.549> you<00:00:13.639> so<00:00:14.599> I'm

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:14.690 
push it out from underneath you so I'm

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:17.050 
push it out from underneath you so I'm
going<00:00:14.749> to<00:00:14.870> copy<00:00:15.379> a<00:00:15.589> leg<00:00:15.829> again<00:00:16.100> or<00:00:16.580> duplicate<00:00:17.030> a

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:17.060 
going to copy a leg again or duplicate a

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:36.209 
going to copy a leg again or duplicate a
leg<00:00:19.000> I'm<00:00:20.000> going<00:00:20.300> to<00:00:20.570> rotate<00:00:21.109> it<00:00:23.230> 90<00:00:24.230> degrees

00:00:36.209 --> 00:00:36.219 

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:46.360 

now<00:00:37.219> let's<00:00:37.489> scale<00:00:37.969> that<00:00:38.210> some<00:00:45.219> something<00:00:46.219> like

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:46.370 
now let's scale that some something like

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:59.880 
now let's scale that some something like
that<00:00:56.859> now<00:00:57.859> I'm<00:00:57.949> going<00:00:58.070> to<00:00:58.160> duplicate<00:00:58.460> that

00:00:59.880 --> 00:00:59.890 
that now I'm going to duplicate that

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:08.590 
that now I'm going to duplicate that
move<00:01:00.890> it<00:01:00.980> to<00:01:01.039> the<00:01:01.129> other<00:01:01.160> side<00:01:07.509> duplicate<00:01:08.509> it

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 
move it to the other side duplicate it

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.120 
move it to the other side duplicate it
one<00:01:08.689> more<00:01:08.780> time<00:01:09.070> rotate<00:01:10.070> it<00:01:11.500> 90<00:01:12.500> degrees<00:01:12.590> in

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 
one more time rotate it 90 degrees in

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:21.580 
one more time rotate it 90 degrees in
the<00:01:13.220> X<00:01:13.460> direction<00:01:19.600> I'm<00:01:20.600> going<00:01:20.780> to<00:01:20.869> scale<00:01:21.350> that

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
the X direction I'm going to scale that

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:26.590 
the X direction I'm going to scale that
so<00:01:22.009> it<00:01:22.189> reaches<00:01:22.729> both<00:01:22.909> both<00:01:23.570> ends<00:01:24.460> and<00:01:25.600> let's

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
so it reaches both both ends and let's

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:35.289 
so it reaches both both ends and let's
scale<00:01:26.930> it<00:01:27.049> this<00:01:27.200> way<00:01:27.350> some<00:01:29.079> up<00:01:32.110> and<00:01:34.299> there's

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:35.299 
scale it this way some up and there's

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:37.420 
scale it this way some up and there's
our<00:01:35.570> chair<00:01:36.350> almost<00:01:36.860> we<00:01:36.979> got<00:01:37.100> one<00:01:37.189> more<00:01:37.250> thing

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:37.430 
our chair almost we got one more thing

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.440 
our chair almost we got one more thing
to<00:01:37.520> do<00:01:38.079> the<00:01:39.079> seat<00:01:39.820> right<00:01:40.820> now<00:01:40.970> it<00:01:41.119> looks<00:01:41.180> a

to do the seat right now it looks a

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:43.569 
to do the seat right now it looks a
little<00:01:41.570> uncomfortable<00:01:42.250> so<00:01:43.250> we're<00:01:43.399> going<00:01:43.460> to

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:43.579 
little uncomfortable so we're going to

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:46.539 
little uncomfortable so we're going to
do<00:01:43.759> a<00:01:43.790> smooth<00:01:44.420> a<00:01:44.810> polygon<00:01:45.530> smooth<00:01:45.890> on<00:01:46.100> this<00:01:46.250> top

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:46.549 
do a smooth a polygon smooth on this top

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:47.920 
do a smooth a polygon smooth on this top
before<00:01:46.759> we<00:01:46.939> do<00:01:47.060> we<00:01:47.180> need<00:01:47.299> to<00:01:47.420> do<00:01:47.600> a<00:01:47.630> couple

edge<00:01:55.189> loop<00:01:57.070> I'm<00:01:58.070> going<00:01:58.250> to<00:01:58.310> put<00:01:58.520> an<00:01:58.610> edge<00:01:58.820> close

00:01:59.679 --> 00:01:59.689 
edge loop I'm going to put an edge close

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:03.819 
edge loop I'm going to put an edge close
to<00:01:59.810> the<00:01:59.930> bottom<00:02:00.259> so<00:02:00.890> it's<00:02:01.070> not<00:02:01.280> a<00:02:02.320> two<00:02:03.320> rounded

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:03.829 
to the bottom so it's not a two rounded

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:06.490 
to the bottom so it's not a two rounded
off<00:02:03.950> on<00:02:04.159> the<00:02:04.250> bottom<00:02:04.990> and<00:02:05.990> I'm<00:02:06.110> going<00:02:06.259> to<00:02:06.320> put

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
an edge at the top but i'm going to put

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:09.850 
an edge at the top but i'm going to put
it<00:02:08.149> down<00:02:08.360> some<00:02:08.690> so<00:02:08.869> we<00:02:08.990> have<00:02:09.110> a<00:02:09.140> better<00:02:09.410> rounded

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
it down some so we have a better rounded

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.940 
it down some so we have a better rounded
edge<00:02:10.039> up<00:02:10.220> there<00:02:10.430> and<00:02:11.170> then<00:02:12.170> i'm<00:02:12.350> going<00:02:12.470> to<00:02:12.560> kind

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
edge up there and then i'm going to kind

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:14.730 
edge up there and then i'm going to kind

I'm going to go back to object mode up
let's<00:02:28.810> do<00:02:28.960> a<00:02:28.990> smooth<00:02:29.350> and<00:02:29.620> we'll<00:02:29.710> go<00:02:29.800> up<00:02:29.920> to<00:02:30.130> my

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 
let's do a smooth and we'll go up to my

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:35.360 
let's do a smooth and we'll go up to my
polygon<00:02:31.300> menu<00:02:31.750> I'm<00:02:32.320> gonna<00:02:32.470> go<00:02:32.560> to<00:02:33.900> mesh<00:02:34.900> and

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
polygon menu I'm gonna go to mesh and

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:40.860 
polygon menu I'm gonna go to mesh and
click<00:02:36.370> on<00:02:36.520> smooth<00:02:39.300> that<00:02:40.300> looks<00:02:40.450> a<00:02:40.540> lot<00:02:40.660> better

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
click on smooth that looks a lot better

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.020 
click on smooth that looks a lot better
it's<00:02:41.110> a<00:02:41.170> lot<00:02:41.320> more<00:02:41.350> comfortable<00:02:41.910> there's<00:02:42.910> one

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
it's a lot more comfortable there's one

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:44.160 
it's a lot more comfortable there's one
more<00:02:43.120> thing<00:02:43.180> we<00:02:43.420> can<00:02:43.570> do<00:02:43.660> we<00:02:43.810> could<00:02:43.930> leave<00:02:44.080> our

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
more thing we can do we could leave our

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:45.600 
more thing we can do we could leave our
chair<00:02:44.350> like<00:02:44.470> that<00:02:44.530> I'm<00:02:45.160> gonna<00:02:45.280> go<00:02:45.400> ahead<00:02:45.520> and

chair like that I'm gonna go ahead and

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.220 
chair like that I'm gonna go ahead and
bevel<00:02:45.970> it<00:02:46.090> so<00:02:46.210> it<00:02:46.270> looks<00:02:46.420> a<00:02:46.510> little<00:02:46.660> better<00:02:46.870> so

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:57.240 
and I'm going to do a bevel edit mesh

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:01.260 
and I'm going to do a bevel edit mesh
devil<00:02:58.830> it's<00:02:59.830> not<00:02:59.980> a<00:03:00.040> very<00:03:00.280> strong<00:03:00.700> bevel<00:03:01.150> so

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:01.270 
devil it's not a very strong bevel so

I'm going to go over to my channel box

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
I'm going to go over to my channel box
under<00:03:03.310> the<00:03:03.340> inputs<00:03:03.730> node<00:03:04.080> and<00:03:05.790> there's<00:03:06.790> our

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
under the inputs node and there's our

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:08.760 
under the inputs node and there's our
offset<00:03:07.540> so<00:03:07.720> I'm<00:03:07.780> going<00:03:07.930> to<00:03:07.960> click<00:03:08.110> on<00:03:08.290> offset

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:08.770 
offset so I'm going to click on offset

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:10.830 
offset so I'm going to click on offset
and<00:03:08.950> just<00:03:09.130> kind<00:03:09.430> of<00:03:09.460> adjust<00:03:09.850> it<00:03:10.000> so<00:03:10.030> it<00:03:10.270> looks<00:03:10.510> a

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
and just kind of adjust it so it looks a

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:16.830 
and just kind of adjust it so it looks a
little<00:03:11.560> better<00:03:12.690> there<00:03:13.690> we<00:03:13.780> go<00:03:15.600> now<00:03:16.600> that

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
little better there we go now that

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.290 
little better there we go now that
finish<00:03:17.080> this<00:03:17.200> off<00:03:17.440> let's<00:03:17.800> create<00:03:18.190> a<00:03:18.400> floor<00:03:19.090> i'm

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:19.300 
finish this off let's create a floor i'm

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.080 
finish this off let's create a floor i'm
going<00:03:19.420> to<00:03:19.510> create<00:03:19.690> a<00:03:19.780> polygon<00:03:20.020> plane<00:03:21.090> scale

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
going to create a polygon plane scale

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:29.580 
going to create a polygon plane scale
that<00:03:22.300> up<00:03:23.580> go<00:03:24.580> into<00:03:24.820> my<00:03:24.970> side<00:03:25.360> view<00:03:28.320> put<00:03:29.320> it<00:03:29.410> down

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
that up go into my side view put it down

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:36.150 
that up go into my side view put it down
where<00:03:29.770> a<00:03:29.800> floor<00:03:30.130> would<00:03:30.400> actually<00:03:30.730> be<00:03:35.160> think

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160 
where a floor would actually be think

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:41.550 
where a floor would actually be think
I'll<00:03:36.360> skeletal<00:03:37.360> bit<00:03:37.450> bigger<00:03:37.720> there<00:03:38.140> we<00:03:38.290> go<00:03:40.560> now

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
I'll skeletal bit bigger there we go now

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.110 
I'll skeletal bit bigger there we go now
you<00:03:41.650> see<00:03:41.980> my<00:03:42.190> screens<00:03:42.610> cutting<00:03:42.970> off<00:03:43.090> my

inches so I'm going to bump that up I'm
just<00:03:59.800> going<00:04:00.010> to<00:04:00.040> put<00:04:00.100> a<00:04:00.280> thousand<00:04:01.230> there<00:04:02.230> we<00:04:02.350> go

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:09.570 

let's<00:04:06.010> create<00:04:06.430> a<00:04:06.520> light<00:04:08.190> so<00:04:09.190> I'll<00:04:09.250> go<00:04:09.430> to<00:04:09.490> my

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:09.580 
let's create a light so I'll go to my

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:12.740 
let's create a light so I'll go to my
rendering<00:04:10.330> tab<00:04:10.720> my<00:04:10.990> shelf<00:04:11.459> will<00:04:12.459> make<00:04:12.700> a

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
rendering tab my shelf will make a

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:20.180 
rendering tab my shelf will make a
spotlight<00:04:16.200> pull<00:04:17.200> that<00:04:17.380> up

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.640 

I'm<00:04:21.180> going<00:04:21.269> to<00:04:21.330> press<00:04:21.510> the<00:04:21.630> letter<00:04:21.750> T<00:04:22.110> on<00:04:22.410> my

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
I'm going to press the letter T on my

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:25.490 
I'm going to press the letter T on my
keyboard<00:04:23.660> that<00:04:24.660> way<00:04:24.810> I<00:04:24.840> can<00:04:24.990> adjust<00:04:25.410> this

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
keyboard that way I can adjust this

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:26.840 
keyboard that way I can adjust this
light<00:04:25.740> better<00:04:26.010> and<00:04:26.220> I<00:04:26.250> can't<00:04:26.490> really<00:04:26.670> see<00:04:26.820> the

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850 
light better and I can't really see the

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:28.070 
light better and I can't really see the
lights<00:04:27.090> doing<00:04:27.420> so<00:04:27.540> I'm<00:04:27.600> going<00:04:27.720> to<00:04:27.750> press<00:04:27.960> the

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.080 
lights doing so I'm going to press the

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:37.910 
lights doing so I'm going to press the
number<00:04:28.440> 7<00:04:29.280> on<00:04:29.400> my<00:04:29.490> keyboard<00:04:29.700> and<00:04:36.710> we<00:04:37.710> got<00:04:37.830> our

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:37.920 
number 7 on my keyboard and we got our

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:47.690 
number 7 on my keyboard and we got our
life<00:04:38.100> backwards<00:04:38.460> actually<00:04:46.100> pull<00:04:47.100> that<00:04:47.310> way<00:04:47.490> up

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:47.700 
life backwards actually pull that way up

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:51.200 
life backwards actually pull that way up
there<00:04:49.190> we'll<00:04:50.190> get<00:04:50.340> a<00:04:50.370> shot<00:04:50.640> from<00:04:50.760> this<00:04:50.970> angle

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:51.210 
there we'll get a shot from this angle

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:53.270 
there we'll get a shot from this angle
so<00:04:51.660> let's<00:04:52.110> pull<00:04:52.350> the<00:04:52.470> light<00:04:52.650> over<00:04:52.680> this<00:04:53.010> way<00:04:53.220> so

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:53.280 
so let's pull the light over this way so

00:04:53.280 --> 00:05:00.530 
so let's pull the light over this way so
it<00:04:53.670> shines<00:04:54.000> when<00:04:54.810> we<00:04:54.900> get<00:04:55.050> less<00:04:55.230> shadows<00:04:59.540> there

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:00.540 
it shines when we get less shadows there

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:02.780 
it shines when we get less shadows there
we<00:05:00.660> go<00:05:00.840> I'm<00:05:01.560> going<00:05:01.710> to<00:05:01.770> go<00:05:01.830> to<00:05:01.980> the<00:05:02.100> attribute

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:02.790 
we go I'm going to go to the attribute

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:04.160 
we go I'm going to go to the attribute
editor<00:05:02.880> for<00:05:03.180> my<00:05:03.330> light<00:05:03.570> just<00:05:03.600> to<00:05:03.990> make<00:05:04.140> a

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:04.170 
editor for my light just to make a

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:06.860 
editor for my light just to make a
couple<00:05:04.620> of<00:05:04.680> changes<00:05:05.090> I'm<00:05:06.090> going<00:05:06.270> to<00:05:06.330> decay

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:06.870 
couple of changes I'm going to decay

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:08.530 
couple of changes I'm going to decay
rate<00:05:07.110> i'm<00:05:07.290> going<00:05:07.320> to<00:05:07.470> change<00:05:07.620> it<00:05:07.770> to<00:05:07.920> linear

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:08.540 
rate i'm going to change it to linear

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:10.640 
rate i'm going to change it to linear
which<00:05:09.540> means<00:05:09.840> I'm<00:05:09.990> gonna<00:05:10.080> have<00:05:10.140> to<00:05:10.260> bump<00:05:10.470> the

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:10.650 
which means I'm gonna have to bump the

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:16.450 
which means I'm gonna have to bump the
intensity<00:05:11.160> up<00:05:11.340> let's<00:05:12.090> try<00:05:12.300> 50<00:05:13.790> let's<00:05:14.790> try<00:05:15.000> 100

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:16.460 
intensity up let's try 50 let's try 100

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:20.780 
intensity up let's try 50 let's try 100
let's<00:05:17.460> try<00:05:17.690> 300<00:05:18.690> there<00:05:18.920> we<00:05:19.920> go<00:05:20.040> that's<00:05:20.310> looking

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:20.790 
let's try 300 there we go that's looking

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:22.430 
let's try 300 there we go that's looking
better<00:05:21.030> probably<00:05:21.900> to<00:05:21.990> go<00:05:22.020> little<00:05:22.200> bit<00:05:22.320> higher

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:22.440 
better probably to go little bit higher

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:27.200 
better probably to go little bit higher
let's<00:05:22.800> try<00:05:22.920> 400<00:05:25.550> I'm<00:05:26.550> going<00:05:26.730> to<00:05:26.790> change<00:05:27.030> the

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:27.210 
let's try 400 I'm going to change the

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:31.810 
let's try 400 I'm going to change the
cone<00:05:27.510> angle<00:05:27.930> so<00:05:28.260> it's<00:05:28.470> a<00:05:28.740> little<00:05:28.919> bigger

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:31.820 

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:38.830 

that's<00:05:32.820> probably<00:05:33.060> good

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:38.840 

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:41.150 

and<00:05:39.840> it<00:05:40.050> should<00:05:40.229> be<00:05:40.259> good<00:05:40.590> maybe<00:05:40.889> I'll<00:05:41.009> add<00:05:41.129> a

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:41.160 
and it should be good maybe I'll add a

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:42.740 
and it should be good maybe I'll add a
little<00:05:41.250> bit<00:05:41.370> of<00:05:41.430> color<00:05:41.669> I'm<00:05:42.419> going<00:05:42.449> to<00:05:42.599> change

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:42.750 
little bit of color I'm going to change

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:44.719 
little bit of color I'm going to change
my<00:05:42.810> light<00:05:43.139> make<00:05:43.710> it<00:05:43.830> a<00:05:43.889> little<00:05:44.009> bit<00:05:44.190> kind<00:05:44.610> of<00:05:44.639> a

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:44.729 
my light make it a little bit kind of a

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:53.990 
my light make it a little bit kind of a
yellowish<00:05:45.030> tint<00:05:45.449> or<00:05:45.629> oranges<00:05:46.379> tint<00:05:52.580> go<00:05:53.580> to<00:05:53.669> my

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:54.000 
yellowish tint or oranges tint go to my
