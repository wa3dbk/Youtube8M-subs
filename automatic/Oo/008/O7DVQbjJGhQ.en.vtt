see<00:01:57.880> that<00:01:58.030> again<00:01:58.060> so<00:01:58.780> you<00:01:58.840> can<00:01:59.020> already<00:01:59.110> see

00:01:59.310 --> 00:01:59.320 
see that again so you can already see

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:00.750

what<00:01:59.410> it<00:01:59.500> does<00:01:59.560> hit<00:01:59.770> it<00:01:59.920> basically<00:02:00.220> stops<00:02:00.580> you

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:00.760 
what it does hit it basically stops you

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.200 
what it does hit it basically stops you
from<00:02:00.790> taking<00:02:01.090> full<00:02:01.330> damage<00:02:01.960> which<00:02:02.710> is<00:02:02.860> awesome

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
from taking full damage which is awesome

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.180 
from taking full damage which is awesome
so<00:02:04.210> as<00:02:04.480> long<00:02:04.900> as<00:02:04.960> you<00:02:05.170> have<00:02:05.350> this<00:02:05.500> on<00:02:05.770> you<00:02:05.980> guys

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:06.190 
so as long as you have this on you guys

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:08.699 
so as long as you have this on you guys
you<00:02:07.030> won't<00:02:07.210> take<00:02:07.420> full<00:02:07.630> damage<00:02:07.990> I<00:02:08.140> thought<00:02:08.440> you

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709 
you won't take full damage I thought you

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:10.589 
you won't take full damage I thought you
could<00:02:08.950> I<00:02:09.369> thought<00:02:09.789> you<00:02:09.879> could<00:02:10.030> jump<00:02:10.330> two

00:02:10.589 --> 00:02:10.599 
could I thought you could jump two

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:13.050 
could I thought you could jump two
blocks<00:02:10.899> higher<00:02:11.260> as<00:02:11.620> well<00:02:11.890> but<00:02:12.550> I<00:02:12.610> guess<00:02:13.030> that's

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
blocks higher as well but I guess that's

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.270 
blocks higher as well but I guess that's
not<00:02:13.540> true<00:02:13.810> because<00:02:14.019> you<00:02:14.890> know<00:02:14.980> I'm<00:02:15.069> just

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
not true because you know I'm just

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.530 
not true because you know I'm just
trying<00:02:15.459> to<00:02:15.519> jump<00:02:15.760> right<00:02:15.910> now<00:02:16.060> and<00:02:16.240> I<00:02:16.300> can<00:02:16.420> only

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
trying to jump right now and I can only

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.170 
trying to jump right now and I can only
jump<00:02:16.780> up<00:02:16.960> one<00:02:17.170> like<00:02:17.440> normal<00:02:18.190> unless<00:02:18.940> there's

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
jump up one like normal unless there's

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.600 
jump up one like normal unless there's
like<00:02:19.300> another<00:02:19.510> condition<00:02:20.290> you<00:02:20.560> need<00:02:20.590> them<00:02:21.040> in

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
like another condition you need them in

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.130 
like another condition you need them in
that<00:02:21.700> could<00:02:21.940> be<00:02:21.970> it<00:02:22.150> but<00:02:22.480> the<00:02:22.960> main<00:02:23.110> thing

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
that could be it but the main thing

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:24.720 
that could be it but the main thing
about<00:02:23.350> this<00:02:23.500> is<00:02:23.560> it's<00:02:23.860> basically<00:02:24.010> like<00:02:24.370> the<00:02:24.430> no

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
over his little feet the way it works is

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:47.670 
over his little feet the way it works is
it<00:02:46.120> will<00:02:46.330> stay<00:02:46.510> on<00:02:46.540> your<00:02:46.750> head<00:02:46.930> until<00:02:47.170> you

I<00:03:47.890> will<00:03:48.820> keep<00:03:49.120> it<00:03:49.269> on<00:03:49.360> my<00:03:49.480> head<00:03:49.660> for<00:03:49.810> as<00:03:49.900> long<00:03:50.019> as

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:50.170 
I will keep it on my head for as long as

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:51.810 
I will keep it on my head for as long as
I<00:03:50.230> possibly<00:03:50.260> can<00:03:50.799> I<00:03:51.070> mean<00:03:51.430> the<00:03:51.489> other<00:03:51.610> thing<00:03:51.670> is

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:51.820 
I possibly can I mean the other thing is

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:53.370 
I possibly can I mean the other thing is
I<00:03:51.940> can't<00:03:52.299> remember<00:03:52.510> any<00:03:52.810> other<00:03:52.959> time<00:03:53.200> that

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:53.380 
I can't remember any other time that

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:55.740 
I can't remember any other time that
we've<00:03:53.470> actually<00:03:53.620> seen<00:03:54.100> one<00:03:54.160> of<00:03:54.430> these<00:03:54.750> aside

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 
we've actually seen one of these aside

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:57.870 
we've actually seen one of these aside
from<00:03:56.019> the<00:03:56.230> one<00:03:56.260> you<00:03:56.739> know<00:03:56.830> directly<00:03:57.489> by<00:03:57.730> my

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:57.880 
from the one you know directly by my

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:01.920 
from the one you know directly by my
house<00:03:58.090> so<00:03:58.480> I'm<00:03:58.810> guessing<00:03:59.290> they're<00:04:00.630> kinda<00:04:01.630> rare

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 
house so I'm guessing they're kinda rare

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:05.729 
house so I'm guessing they're kinda rare
maybe<00:04:03.239> like<00:04:04.239> I'm<00:04:04.480> not<00:04:04.930> sure<00:04:05.200> how<00:04:05.350> rare<00:04:05.590> they

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:05.739 
maybe like I'm not sure how rare they

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:06.720 
maybe like I'm not sure how rare they
are<00:04:05.769> i<00:04:05.920> mean<00:04:06.010> i<00:04:06.160> don't<00:04:06.400> think<00:04:06.580> i've<00:04:06.700> seen

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:06.730 
are i mean i don't think i've seen

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:09.570 
are i mean i don't think i've seen
another<00:04:07.090> one<00:04:07.269> so<00:04:07.630> it's<00:04:08.170> not<00:04:08.410> just<00:04:08.470> like<00:04:09.040> we<00:04:09.400> can

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:09.580 
another one so it's not just like we can

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:12.000 
another one so it's not just like we can
easily<00:04:09.880> get<00:04:10.239> another<00:04:10.360> one<00:04:10.720> if<00:04:10.959> we<00:04:11.320> have<00:04:11.830> this

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
easily get another one if we have this

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:17.039 
easily get another one if we have this
