00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:00.190 
while I did nothing I just stood in the
front<00:03:56.840> room<00:03:57.439> at<00:03:57.650> the<00:03:57.739> window<00:03:58.129> I<00:03:58.780> stared<00:03:59.780> out<00:04:00.140> at

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:00.200 
front room at the window I stared out at

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.770 
front room at the window I stared out at
the<00:04:00.439> falling<00:04:00.950> snow<00:04:01.129> as<00:04:01.549> the<00:04:02.060> light<00:04:02.299> grew

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:02.780 
the falling snow as the light grew

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.850 
the falling snow as the light grew
dimmer<00:04:03.200> and<00:04:03.500> dimmer<00:04:04.900> alone<00:04:05.900> in<00:04:06.260> that<00:04:06.590> house

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:06.860 
dimmer and dimmer alone in that house

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:09.220 
dimmer and dimmer alone in that house
with<00:04:07.220> night<00:04:07.489> coming<00:04:07.690> all<00:04:08.690> I<00:04:08.750> could<00:04:09.200> think

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:09.230 
with night coming all I could think

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:11.380 
with night coming all I could think
about<00:04:09.530> was<00:04:09.860> that<00:04:09.920> moment<00:04:10.579> in<00:04:10.700> the<00:04:10.790> car<00:04:11.060> just

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:11.390 
about was that moment in the car just

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:14.319 
about was that moment in the car just
before<00:04:11.750> I<00:04:11.780> hit<00:04:12.110> the<00:04:12.170> final<00:04:12.650> skid<00:04:13.329> that

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:14.329 
before I hit the final skid that

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:16.870 
before I hit the final skid that
seemingly<00:04:14.989> familiar<00:04:15.890> voice<00:04:16.190> coming<00:04:16.850> through

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 
seemingly familiar voice coming through

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:21.939 
seemingly familiar voice coming through
the<00:04:17.209> static<00:04:17.750> on<00:04:17.930> the<00:04:17.989> radio<00:04:18.109> that<00:04:19.269> song<00:04:20.269> I<00:04:20.949> wait

00:04:21.939 --> 00:04:21.949 
the static on the radio that song I wait

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:26.440 
the static on the radio that song I wait
for<00:04:22.190> you<00:04:22.370> I<00:04:22.699> wait<00:04:23.690> for<00:04:24.289> you
