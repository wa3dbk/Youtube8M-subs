00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.720
 so honda accord new generation i 

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:28.890
 drove this car to a presentation in 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:32.230
 Gelendzhik and then I was her more 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.720
 worst opinion and now I have this car 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:37.570
 You can say I fell in love very nice 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:42.100
 the suspension is very nice and steering 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:44.460
 control is very precise and everything is very 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:48.780
 expectedly everything is predictable 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:51.460
 For example, in comparison with the Camry steering wheel here 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.080
 nicer because on the stone at zero steering wheel 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.930
 some not very clear accounted for so 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:58.299
 look all the time 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.869
 as for the general impression of 

00:00:58.299 --> 00:01:02.530
 salon 

00:00:58.869 --> 00:01:05.140
 well here is one blemish here it is very 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.680
 hard plastic around the center 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.659
 console 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:14.229
 otherwise everything is quite nice and 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:16.750
 second moment which confuses it 4 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:18.939
 display in the car 4 display why 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.770
 I ask why does the display mean 

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:21.640
 it is clear that there is a dashboard 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.579
 one display 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:27.399
 Where can I find fuel consumption and other 

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:29.289
 parameter of the trip but apart from that there is 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:31.380
 central large display 

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:34.259
 inches probably 7 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.909
 there is a touchscreen display on the central 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:39.000
 the console has a display where 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.890
 climate information i have it honestly 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.409
 very angry because I would like to 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.750
 so that the display was smaller and then I would 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:48.780
 not looking for all the necessary information see me 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.159
 emphasize it for the rest that I can 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.770
 say camry is perceived more 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:55.579
 dynamic car I think it's 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.810
 connected with a six-speed automatic 

00:01:55.579 --> 00:02:01.130
 then come in old enough 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:05.790
 automatic 5-speed and, respectively 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:08.759
 acceleration from this is perceived weaker 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:12.330
 quite a lot of space behind 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:14.970
 comfortable and overall here landing on 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:17.790
 this is more important than in the cell and in me 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:20.220
 with the feeling that camry in camry you 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:23.690
 going to work and on the cord you're going with 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.690
 work and rest
