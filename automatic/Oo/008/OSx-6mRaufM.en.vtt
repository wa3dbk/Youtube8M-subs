because<00:08:01.780> like<00:08:02.110> I<00:08:02.259> didn't<00:08:02.470> punch<00:08:02.560> teleport<00:08:03.150> if

00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:04.150 
because like I didn't punch teleport if

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:05.460 
because like I didn't punch teleport if
I<00:08:04.300> didn't<00:08:04.509> kick<00:08:04.630> teleport<00:08:05.080> that<00:08:05.199> want<00:08:05.349> to

I didn't kick teleport that want to
happen<00:08:05.770> but<00:08:05.949> then<00:08:06.099> there's<00:08:06.370> a<00:08:06.460> high<00:08:06.580> chance<00:08:06.610> I

00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:07.060 
happen but then there's a high chance I

00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:10.189 
happen but then there's a high chance I
might<00:08:07.240> overlap<00:08:07.630> oh<00:08:08.130> wait<00:08:09.130> cuz<00:08:09.340> y'all<00:08:09.520> doing<00:08:09.729> a
