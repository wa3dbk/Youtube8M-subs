 24 hours good agreed welcome 

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:15.889
 alicante but you still take us 24 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:17.449
 hours with the coreback but as they have been 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:19.580
 those first moments the first 

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:23.620
 hours as a player of the córdoba 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:25.960
 good the truth that I was happy 

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:29.020
 it has been very easy at first everything 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.790
 has helped and well I will meet a 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:32.440
 Juan's dream soccer xeral and what better 

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:34.330
 that here in the cordoba you are telling me 

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:36.490
 who are very happy that it improves 

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:38.800
 fulfill a dream of Cordoba with a group 

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:40.690
 in which the account will be realizing 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.910
 it's easy to integrate from the beginning 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.100
 it's very important to have that here 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:47.500
 you are also true and of course the 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:49.470
 first moment that everyone arrived 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:53.370
 easy position 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:55.380
 they are at my disposal is very very easy 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.760
 and what is it that convinces you in the end 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:58.980
 Hector to come to Córdoba because 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.820
 There were more offers besides options but 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.610
 what is it that finally convinced you 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:06.540
 to come here because he does not receive a 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:08.790
 Emilio call or anything tell me his 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:13.110
 draft 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:15.720
 Well, I wanted to start a new 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.490
 challenge with something that can prove to me 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.070
 same that I am prepared and what better 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.170
 site here a challenge that you already know what is 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.330
 it is a very ambitious goal very nice 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.280
 it's also not very difficult but the 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.310
 challenge is to try to raise the 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.180
 first division 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:34.690
 but well I think that 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:38.530
 and a lot of effort and sacrifice the team 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:41.080
 but that you will achieve it you are a man of 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:43.360
 right band to a pure end we can 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.220
 speak I do not know how it 's done to 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.920
 players do not usually like that of 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.630
 define yourself but with how you would do it 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.880
 What would you highlight from yourself? 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.119
 you can contribute to the cordoba I think that I 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.800
 I consider myself a very fast player 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:02:00.070
 destabilizing 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:03.250
 enough good enough quality that's 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:05.410
 something that is also putting in 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.240
 practice I like the offensive game them 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:09.520
 like the colorful game protagonism and 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:12.120
 that for your qualities is fundamental 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:15.070
 You have spoken with Oltra who has told you 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.860
 I have not had the time to talk either 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:20.019
 good but good 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:23.330
 I can not talk to him 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:26.640
 I liked his name that close that 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:28.560
 will you trust me 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.140
 that I think he's a player of the 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:34.110
 features that you like 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:36.209
 I will prove that you can count on me and 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.950
 There are many skills as you too 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:39.780
 there are still players to come or for 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.880
 complete that right band but it's already 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.590
 come in these first bars of the 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.670
 preseason there's a lot of competition and 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.069
 In the end it will always be good that 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.870
 reverberate in the group I'm clear against 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:50.080
 more competition there is much better for 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.740
 everyone 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.940
 and whenever we can learn from each other 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:56.860
 that was seen yesterday in the first match 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.750
 friendly preseason to 0 3 on the 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:00.280
 orihuela that we have the attention or as 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.330
 you saw the team because good the first 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.710
 part had quite good in the second 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.420
 it also lowered a little bit the best the 

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:06.040
 rhythm but broadly what do you 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.860
 it seemed the cordoba yesterday that is going to be 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:12.730
 your new team the truth that I 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:15.340
 surprised that they play football a lot 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.930
 and then what I said good we are at 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.239
 beginning and I was quite tired but 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.659
 good the feelings of teams were 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:21.849
 very good 

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:23.440
 you said before it is fulfilled is a dream that 

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:24.879
 you're going to play in its edition was a 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.830
 professional because once 

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:27.970
 expectations have you imagine that you get to 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:30.160
 one site each time when you get to a 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.420
 new site you have expectations of 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.690
 that he expects from the second division this 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:35.870
 year 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:38.110
 but it's just showing me 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:39.970
 same as I am prepared 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:42.800
 and nothing because I want those to fulfill the 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:44.840
 goal that the club has 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:49.190
 well then 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:49.190
 soon you can make the jump 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:54.580
 I hope it is with the cordoba that is a 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:56.980
 little bit far but for that to be true 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:59.230
 you have to row all you have to join all 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:01.240
 and the fans have answered I do not know if 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:04.030
 you know something of the hobby giving but 

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:05.890
 there are more than 15,000 15,500 subscribers that do not 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.870
 it's a tremendous response you know something 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:09.330
 of the hobby that you would say to the fans 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:11.120
 already to finish 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:13.190
 for nothing do 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.379
 that trust us and that they see with 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:19.600
 very excited that we are going to get the 

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:19.600
