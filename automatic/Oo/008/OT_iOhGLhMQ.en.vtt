00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:33.980
 I will quickly teach you what 

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:35.570
 we are going to do here here in this in 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.310
 this mountain we are going to do quickly 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.950
 as you can see here a pyramid that 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:43.640
 tells us clearly clearly tells us 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:45.260
 that here you are going to make a joke 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.970
 is going to be there as you can see in the 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.820
 part of below let's look for a weapon that 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:51.250
 have a lamp to teach them 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.230
 that this one has a 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:56.710
 what this one has good hunger like 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:59.200
 can see in the bottom there is a 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:01.420
 UFO there is an egg and there is a doll with 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:03.160
 a trophy that means that already 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.830
 you completed your 100% and at the time of 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:08.500
 complete your 100% you will be able to do the 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:10.810
 five different interests of ships 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.360
 space there are as you can see there 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:17.170
 five little squares marked that wants 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.700
 say that there are five different ships or 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.460
 UFOs 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:24.490
 on the map there are five different there are two 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:26.920
 that you can see during the day and there are three that 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:30.280
 they look at night there are three that light up and 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.659
 two that do not illuminate like this is that what 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.990
 I'm going to do is that I'm going to be 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:36.670
 bringing many videos of these five of 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.880
 these five spaceships or these 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:42.340
 five UFOs and good gentlemen to do 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:45.189
 the one here we have to have we have to 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:49.659
 wait for 3 o'clock in the morning and 

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:53.229
 that a thunderstorm is falling 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:54.909
 so what I recommend apart 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:56.619
 still after that we have to pass 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:59.890
 to the part of here that clarifies us 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:01.479
 clearly tells us to come back when 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.990
 when we want to make the list of 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:08.140
 let's come back here when we have him 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:10.030
 when we have 100% finished the 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.160
 game here clearly tells us gentlemen 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.950
 so this and this one can not 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:18.580
 do if you do not have 100% finished 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:21.310
 must be 100% finished can not you 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:23.769
 missing nothing must be finished at 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:26.769
 100% as you can see here says 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:29.319
 completed up to 100% must be 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:31.239

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:33.400

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:36.310
 you good quickly what you have 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.860
 what to do is put the storm you have 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.660
 that put the storm as missing a 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:45.640
 hour or so you put the storm 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:48.180
