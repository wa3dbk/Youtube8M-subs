our theme like I said this is the thesis
theme<00:03:22.440> and<00:03:22.710> this<00:03:22.830> is<00:03:22.950> how<00:03:23.100> it<00:03:23.340> inserts<00:03:23.820> the

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
theme and this is how it inserts the

post image your theme made to it a

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.030 
post image your theme made to it a
little<00:03:26.280> bit<00:03:26.430> differently<00:03:27.080> and<00:03:28.080> the<00:03:28.740> final

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
little bit differently and the final

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.560 
little bit differently and the final
thing<00:03:29.160> that<00:03:29.190> we<00:03:29.370> need<00:03:29.550> to<00:03:29.670> do<00:03:29.790> is<00:03:30.000> we<00:03:30.360> need<00:03:30.510> to

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:30.570 
thing that we need to do is we need to

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:34.640 
thing that we need to do is we need to
check<00:03:31.110> on<00:03:31.320> featured<00:03:32.310> as<00:03:32.520> our<00:03:33.450> category<00:03:34.050> and

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
check on featured as our category and

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:38.300 
check on featured as our category and
you<00:03:35.460> can't<00:03:35.730> have<00:03:35.940> more<00:03:36.210> than<00:03:36.270> one<00:03:36.450> category<00:03:37.310> we

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
you can't have more than one category we

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.070 
you can't have more than one category we
can<00:03:38.430> pick<00:03:38.610> green<00:03:38.820> homes<00:03:39.090> for<00:03:39.420> example<00:03:39.870> and

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 
can pick green homes for example and

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:44.290 
can pick green homes for example and
maybe<00:03:40.620> Los<00:03:41.070> Altos<00:03:41.490> as<00:03:41.730> another<00:03:41.970> example<00:03:42.150> and

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:44.300 
maybe Los Altos as another example and

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.400 
maybe Los Altos as another example and
the<00:03:45.300> most<00:03:45.450> important<00:03:45.900> part<00:03:46.020> is<00:03:46.170> to<00:03:46.200> have

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
the most important part is to have

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:48.080 
the most important part is to have
featured<00:03:46.860> because<00:03:47.190> by<00:03:47.400> clicking<00:03:47.790> on<00:03:47.910> that

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
featured because by clicking on that

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:49.670 
featured because by clicking on that
category<00:03:48.450> it<00:03:48.870> automatically<00:03:49.410> tells

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
category it automatically tells

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.430 
category it automatically tells

display a particular number as a maximum
in<00:04:57.139> this<00:04:57.260> case<00:04:57.530> it's<00:04:57.770> five<00:04:58.240> so<00:04:59.240> right<00:04:59.510> now<00:04:59.660> we

00:04:59.710 --> 00:04:59.720 
in this case it's five so right now we

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:03.820 
in this case it's five so right now we
only<00:04:59.840> have<00:05:00.080> four<00:05:01.240> and<00:05:02.380> it'll<00:05:03.380> go<00:05:03.500> right<00:05:03.530> back

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:03.830 
only have four and it'll go right back

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:05.110 
only have four and it'll go right back
to<00:05:03.860> the<00:05:04.070> beginning<00:05:04.130> if<00:05:04.520> there's<00:05:04.729> less<00:05:04.910> than

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:05.120 
to the beginning if there's less than

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:06.640 
to the beginning if there's less than
five<00:05:05.300> but<00:05:05.630> if<00:05:05.720> there's<00:05:05.870> more<00:05:06.050> than<00:05:06.110> five<00:05:06.410> if

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:06.650 
five but if there's more than five if

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:08.950 
five but if there's more than five if
there's<00:05:06.830> six<00:05:07.070> or<00:05:07.220> seven<00:05:07.580> it<00:05:08.210> will<00:05:08.389> stop<00:05:08.720> at

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:08.960 
there's six or seven it will stop at

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:11.409 
there's six or seven it will stop at
number<00:05:09.229> five<00:05:09.440> so<00:05:10.310> this<00:05:10.639> is<00:05:10.789> a<00:05:10.820> very<00:05:11.090> good<00:05:11.240> way

00:05:11.409 --> 00:05:11.419 
number five so this is a very good way

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:14.170 
number five so this is a very good way
to<00:05:11.800> just<00:05:12.800> keep<00:05:12.950> updating<00:05:13.430> content<00:05:13.940> to<00:05:14.090> the
