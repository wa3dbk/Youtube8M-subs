whole reselling aspect you know that is

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.950 
whole reselling aspect you know that is
something<00:01:30.930> in<00:01:31.079> my<00:01:31.200> opinion<00:01:31.470> that<00:01:31.560> has<00:01:31.770> sort<00:01:32.009> of

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960 
something in my opinion that has sort of

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.469 
something in my opinion that has sort of
really<00:01:33.960> changed<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:35.310> way<00:01:35.579> you<00:01:36.030> know<00:01:36.180> people

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
really changed the way you know people

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.450 
really changed the way you know people
view<00:01:36.720> sneakers<00:01:37.140> and<00:01:37.350> shoes<00:01:37.530> and<00:01:37.860> Jordans<00:01:38.280> and

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
view sneakers and shoes and Jordans and

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.960 
view sneakers and shoes and Jordans and
and<00:01:38.640> I<00:01:38.850> guess<00:01:39.000> limited<00:01:39.680> sneakers<00:01:40.820> it's<00:01:41.820> an

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
and I guess limited sneakers it's an

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:48.329 
two and seeing you know where the whole

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:52.520 
two and seeing you know where the whole
reseller<00:03:49.079> thing<00:03:50.420> it<00:03:51.420> was<00:03:51.630> manifested<00:03:52.380> in

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
reseller thing it was manifested in

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.440 
reseller thing it was manifested in
terms<00:03:52.709> of<00:03:52.829> the<00:03:52.920> rarity<00:03:53.280> in<00:03:53.519> terms<00:03:53.700> of<00:03:53.850> the<00:03:54.239> hype

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
terms of the rarity in terms of the hype

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.990 
terms of the rarity in terms of the hype
and<00:03:54.690> then<00:03:55.290> and<00:03:55.890> then<00:03:56.010> taking<00:03:56.250> that<00:03:56.400> aspect<00:03:56.940> and

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
and then and then taking that aspect and

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.729 
and then and then taking that aspect and
applying<00:03:57.299> it<00:03:57.360> to<00:03:57.450> shoes<00:03:57.720> I<00:03:57.989> think<00:03:58.560> there's<00:03:58.680> a

00:03:58.729 --> 00:03:58.739 
applying it to shoes I think there's a

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:01.940 
applying it to shoes I think there's a
lot<00:03:58.920> of<00:03:58.950> lot<00:03:59.430> of<00:03:59.459> similarities<00:04:00.150> and<00:04:00.560> in<00:04:01.560> terms

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
lot of lot of similarities and in terms

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:03.890 
lot of lot of similarities and in terms
of<00:04:02.010> the<00:04:02.100> direction<00:04:02.250> of<00:04:02.670> the<00:04:02.910> whole<00:04:03.090> game<00:04:03.690> right

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
of the direction of the whole game right

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.120 
of the direction of the whole game right
now<00:04:03.930> there<00:04:04.350> can<00:04:04.470> be<00:04:04.530> there's<00:04:04.860> gonna<00:04:04.950> be<00:04:05.040> a

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.130 
now there can be there's gonna be a

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:07.729 
now there can be there's gonna be a
whole<00:04:05.220> lot<00:04:05.280> of<00:04:05.459> changes<00:04:05.970> and<00:04:06.470> that's<00:04:07.470> kind<00:04:07.709> of

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:07.739 
whole lot of changes and that's kind of

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:09.110 
whole lot of changes and that's kind of
my<00:04:07.890> thoughts<00:04:08.130> now<00:04:08.400> this<00:04:08.640> is<00:04:08.730> just<00:04:08.760> straight

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
my thoughts now this is just straight

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:10.789 
my thoughts now this is just straight
off<00:04:09.209> the<00:04:09.239> top<00:04:09.480> of<00:04:09.630> the<00:04:09.690> head<00:04:09.840> no<00:04:10.140> editing<00:04:10.590> of

00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:10.799 
off the top of the head no editing of

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:11.840 
off the top of the head no editing of
that<00:04:10.950> you<00:04:11.100> know<00:04:11.190> I<00:04:11.220> didn't<00:04:11.459> plan<00:04:11.610> any<00:04:11.730> of<00:04:11.790> this

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:11.850 
that you know I didn't plan any of this

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:14.420 
that you know I didn't plan any of this
but<00:04:12.180> that's<00:04:13.079> where<00:04:13.320> I<00:04:13.350> stand<00:04:13.799> right<00:04:14.010> now<00:04:14.190> and<00:04:14.340> I

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
but that's where I stand right now and I

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:15.410 
but that's where I stand right now and I
think<00:04:14.549> it's<00:04:14.670> really<00:04:14.790> important<00:04:15.209> to<00:04:15.239> talk

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420 
think it's really important to talk

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:16.819 
think it's really important to talk
about<00:04:15.600> it<00:04:15.750> now<00:04:15.900> and<00:04:15.930> maybe<00:04:16.260> revisit<00:04:16.590> this
