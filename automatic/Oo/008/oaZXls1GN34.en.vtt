00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.040 
okay I'm about an hour up from

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.400 
okay I'm about an hour up from
bakersville<00:00:05.819> off<00:00:06.060> Interstate<00:00:06.569> 70<00:00:07.080> it's<00:00:07.230> been

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
bakersville off Interstate 70 it's been

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.790 
bakersville off Interstate 70 it's been
all<00:00:07.620> uphill<00:00:08.000> and<00:00:09.019> I<00:00:10.019> got<00:00:10.230> up<00:00:10.410> here<00:00:10.679> without

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
all uphill and I got up here without

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.490 
all uphill and I got up here without
skins<00:00:11.580> without<00:00:11.849> snow<00:00:12.330> shoes<00:00:12.630> without<00:00:12.929> scales

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
skins without snow shoes without scales

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.689 
skins without snow shoes without scales
I<00:00:14.450> did<00:00:15.450> it<00:00:15.570> on<00:00:15.690> my<00:00:15.960> very<00:00:16.560> old<00:00:16.859> Fisher

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
I did it on my very old Fisher

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.790 
I did it on my very old Fisher
backcountry<00:00:18.449> skis<00:00:21.020> 210<00:00:22.020> centimeters<00:00:22.650> in

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
backcountry skis 210 centimeters in

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.990 
backcountry skis 210 centimeters in
length<00:00:22.830> and<00:00:23.189> I<00:00:23.310> did<00:00:23.490> it<00:00:23.609> just<00:00:23.910> with<00:00:24.060> wax<00:00:26.000> these

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
length and I did it just with wax these

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.839 
length and I did it just with wax these
skis<00:00:27.900> I<00:00:28.080> think<00:00:28.320> have<00:00:28.470> about<00:00:28.740> a<00:00:28.769> half<00:00:29.099> a<00:00:29.340> camber

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
skis I think have about a half a camber

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.150 
skis I think have about a half a camber
I<00:00:30.140> believe<00:00:31.140> that's<00:00:31.289> how<00:00:31.439> they<00:00:31.650> measure<00:00:31.859> which

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
I believe that's how they measure which

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.010 
I believe that's how they measure which
isn't<00:00:32.520> much<00:00:32.579> it<00:00:33.000> means<00:00:33.649> right<00:00:34.649> here<00:00:35.840> under<00:00:36.840> my

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
isn't much it means right here under my

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.549 
isn't much it means right here under my
heel<00:00:37.460> it's<00:00:38.460> curved<00:00:39.059> just<00:00:39.660> about<00:00:39.870> above<00:00:40.379> the

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
heel it's curved just about above the

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.200 
heel it's curved just about above the
snow<00:00:40.860> and<00:00:41.480> that's<00:00:42.480> where<00:00:42.690> I<00:00:42.719> apply<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.170> wax

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:44.210 
snow and that's where I apply the wax

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.790 
snow and that's where I apply the wax
this<00:00:45.210> is<00:00:45.360> a<00:00:45.390> clump<00:00:45.719> of<00:00:45.840> snow<00:00:46.200> that's<00:00:46.559> adhering

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
this is a clump of snow that's adhering

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.130 
this is a clump of snow that's adhering
to<00:00:48.920> the<00:00:49.920> wax<00:00:50.100> that<00:00:50.340> have<00:00:50.430> applied<00:00:50.840> just<00:00:51.840> under

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
to the wax that have applied just under

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.279 
to the wax that have applied just under
my<00:00:52.170> feet<00:00:52.590> that<00:00:53.059> way<00:00:54.059> when<00:00:54.449> I<00:00:54.480> need<00:00:54.780> to<00:00:54.899> kick<00:00:55.110> and

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
my feet that way when I need to kick and

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.299 
my feet that way when I need to kick and
glide<00:00:55.320> or<00:00:55.949> power<00:00:56.579> I<00:00:57.620> put<00:00:58.620> pressure<00:00:58.920> on<00:00:59.190> this

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
glide or power I put pressure on this

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.400 
glide or power I put pressure on this
part<00:00:59.550> of<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.730> ski<00:00:59.969> it<00:01:00.120> goes<00:01:00.329> down<00:01:00.600> pushes<00:01:01.289> the

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
part of the ski it goes down pushes the

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.870 
part of the ski it goes down pushes the
wax<00:01:01.620> into<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.219> snow<00:01:02.520> and<00:01:03.439> provides<00:01:04.439> traction

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:04.880 
wax into the snow and provides traction

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:07.609 
wax into the snow and provides traction
so<00:01:05.880> a<00:01:05.909> lot<00:01:06.150> of<00:01:06.180> snow<00:01:06.570> has<00:01:06.810> clumped<00:01:07.260> up<00:01:07.350> under

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
so a lot of snow has clumped up under

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.039 
so a lot of snow has clumped up under
here<00:01:07.770> which<00:01:07.920> is<00:01:08.040> really<00:01:08.250> good<00:01:08.520> for<00:01:08.930> going<00:01:09.930> up

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
here which is really good for going up

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.929 
here which is really good for going up
steep<00:01:10.290> hills<00:01:10.350> like<00:01:10.799> I<00:01:10.920> just<00:01:10.979> came<00:01:11.340> up<00:01:11.580> I'm<00:01:11.850> a

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
steep hills like I just came up I'm a

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.149 
steep hills like I just came up I'm a
little<00:01:11.970> out<00:01:12.180> of<00:01:12.240> breath<00:01:12.540> plus<00:01:13.470> i'm<00:01:13.650> at<00:01:13.830> about

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
little out of breath plus i'm at about

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.170 
little out of breath plus i'm at about
eleven<00:01:14.880> thousand<00:01:15.390> plus<00:01:15.869> feet<00:01:17.000> but<00:01:18.000> you<00:01:18.090> get

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
eleven thousand plus feet but you get

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.940 
eleven thousand plus feet but you get
the<00:01:18.240> idea<00:01:18.360> that<00:01:20.150> kind<00:01:21.150> of<00:01:21.240> wax<00:01:21.540> kick<00:01:22.350> wax<00:01:22.530> just

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
the idea that kind of wax kick wax just

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.850 
the idea that kind of wax kick wax just
right<00:01:23.159> here<00:01:23.960> under<00:01:24.960> this<00:01:25.080> part<00:01:25.380> of<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.560> ski

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
right here under this part of the ski

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.940 
right here under this part of the ski
under<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.430> boot<00:01:26.670> and<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:26.909> binding<00:01:27.420> and<00:01:28.229> the

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
under the boot and the binding and the

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.620 
under the boot and the binding and the
rest<00:01:29.130> of<00:01:29.280> it<00:01:29.400> can<00:01:29.579> be<00:01:29.610> glide<00:01:29.939> wax<00:01:30.329> if<00:01:30.509> you

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
rest of it can be glide wax if you

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.520 
rest of it can be glide wax if you
choose<00:01:30.930> but<00:01:31.170> just<00:01:31.350> a<00:01:31.439> smooth<00:01:31.799> clean<00:01:32.130> surface

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
choose but just a smooth clean surface

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.190 
choose but just a smooth clean surface
so<00:01:34.530> that<00:01:34.560> when<00:01:34.890> you're<00:01:35.009> going<00:01:35.220> downhill<00:01:36.200> your

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
so that when you're going downhill your

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.590 
so that when you're going downhill your
foot<00:01:37.560> isn't<00:01:37.740> pressing<00:01:38.250> pressing<00:01:38.790> rather<00:01:39.210> into

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
foot isn't pressing pressing rather into

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.469 
foot isn't pressing pressing rather into
the<00:01:39.720> snow<00:01:40.020> and<00:01:40.579> even<00:01:41.579> though<00:01:41.700> this<00:01:41.850> is<00:01:42.060> clumped

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
the snow and even though this is clumped

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.149 
the snow and even though this is clumped
up<00:01:42.600> it'll<00:01:42.869> scrape<00:01:43.200> off<00:01:43.470> a<00:01:43.500> little<00:01:43.770> bit<00:01:43.920> as<00:01:44.040> I'm

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
up it'll scrape off a little bit as I'm

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.130 
up it'll scrape off a little bit as I'm
going<00:01:44.310> downhill<00:01:44.520> and<00:01:44.850> this<00:01:45.000> part<00:01:45.270> will

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
going downhill and this part will

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.990 
going downhill and this part will
provide<00:01:46.470> no<00:01:46.710> resistance<00:01:47.250> because<00:01:47.579> again<00:01:47.820> it's

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
provide no resistance because again it's

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.380 
provide no resistance because again it's
half<00:01:48.240> kamerad<00:01:48.720> up<00:01:49.159> and<00:01:50.159> you<00:01:50.310> glide<00:01:50.700> like<00:01:51.090> the

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
half kamerad up and you glide like the

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.139 
half kamerad up and you glide like the
dickens<00:01:51.659> it's<00:01:52.049> a<00:01:52.110> great<00:01:52.350> little<00:01:52.500> system<00:01:53.149> many

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
dickens it's a great little system many

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.550 
dickens it's a great little system many
years<00:01:54.450> old<00:01:54.689> but<00:01:54.840> you<00:01:54.899> have<00:01:55.110> to<00:01:55.229> be<00:01:55.320> able<00:01:55.380> to

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
years old but you have to be able to

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.830 
years old but you have to be able to
select<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:56.340> right<00:01:56.520> wax<00:01:56.909> in<00:01:57.240> this<00:01:57.360> case<00:01:57.600> I'm

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
select the right wax in this case I'm

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.130 
select the right wax in this case I'm
using<00:01:57.869> blue<00:01:58.590> extra<00:01:59.250> it's<00:02:00.149> a<00:02:00.299> combination<00:02:00.659> of

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
using blue extra it's a combination of

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.880 
using blue extra it's a combination of
two<00:02:02.070> different<00:02:02.579> temperatures<00:02:03.450> of<00:02:03.689> wax<00:02:03.960> that

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
two different temperatures of wax that

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.709 
two different temperatures of wax that
works<00:02:05.100> really<00:02:05.369> great<00:02:05.610> here<00:02:06.000> in<00:02:06.030> Colorado

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
works really great here in Colorado

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.779 
works really great here in Colorado
because<00:02:07.020> we've<00:02:07.290> got<00:02:07.409> a<00:02:07.469> very<00:02:07.710> dry<00:02:08.069> champagne

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
because we've got a very dry champagne

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.890 
because we've got a very dry champagne
powder<00:02:09.149> like<00:02:09.539> snow<00:02:09.929> and

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.410 

and<00:02:13.349> it's<00:02:13.530> pretty<00:02:14.040> cold<00:02:14.370> normally<00:02:14.939> especially

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
and it's pretty cold normally especially

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.600

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
at eleven thousand plus feet so blue

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.119 
at eleven thousand plus feet so blue
extra<00:02:17.970> works<00:02:18.209> almost<00:02:18.450> all<00:02:18.810> the<00:02:18.989> time<00:02:19.230> until

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:20.129 
extra works almost all the time until

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:22.009 
extra works almost all the time until
things<00:02:20.640> warm<00:02:20.970> up<00:02:21.180> a<00:02:21.299> month<00:02:21.510> or<00:02:21.659> two<00:02:21.689> from<00:02:21.930> now

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:22.019 
things warm up a month or two from now

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:25.429 
things warm up a month or two from now
it's<00:02:22.319> March<00:02:22.650> as<00:02:22.860> I<00:02:22.980> speak<00:02:23.250> early<00:02:23.670> March<00:02:24.379> so<00:02:25.379> I

00:02:25.429 --> 00:02:25.439 
it's March as I speak early March so I

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:28.309 
it's March as I speak early March so I
hope<00:02:25.590> that<00:02:25.680> comes<00:02:26.159> out<00:02:26.370> clear<00:02:26.989> it's<00:02:27.989> not<00:02:28.049> a<00:02:28.170> lot

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 
hope that comes out clear it's not a lot

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:29.809 
hope that comes out clear it's not a lot
of<00:02:28.439> sunlight<00:02:28.680> out<00:02:29.010> today<00:02:29.280> it's<00:02:29.430> snowing

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819 
of sunlight out today it's snowing

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:34.009 
of sunlight out today it's snowing
lightly<00:02:30.030> but<00:02:30.959> the<00:02:31.049> idea<00:02:31.349> again<00:02:31.829> is<00:02:33.019> gain

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:34.019 
lightly but the idea again is gain

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:36.349 
lightly but the idea again is gain
traction<00:02:34.409> right<00:02:34.920> here<00:02:35.340> and<00:02:35.549> we<00:02:35.790> push<00:02:36.090> down

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:36.359 
traction right here and we push down

00:02:36.359 --> 00:02:38.119 
traction right here and we push down
with<00:02:36.540> our<00:02:36.659> feet<00:02:36.930> as<00:02:37.079> we're<00:02:37.260> shuffling<00:02:37.530> uphill

00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:38.129 
with our feet as we're shuffling uphill

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:47.990 
with our feet as we're shuffling uphill
that's<00:02:39.000> where<00:02:39.209> the<00:02:39.299> traction<00:02:39.780> comes<00:02:40.019> from<00:02:47.000> and

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
that's where the traction comes from and

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.250 
that's where the traction comes from and
that's<00:02:48.030> why<00:02:48.989> I'm<00:02:49.109> going<00:02:49.500> continuing<00:02:50.099> uphill
