00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:29.900 
I started I did three ballets there two

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.720 
I started I did three ballets there two
of<00:00:30.019> them<00:00:30.230> I<00:00:30.529> had<00:00:30.740> already<00:00:30.890> done<00:00:31.220> before

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:31.730 
of them I had already done before

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:33.850 
of them I had already done before
so<00:00:32.029> I<00:00:32.059> was<00:00:32.300> quite<00:00:32.599> quite<00:00:33.170> sure<00:00:33.379> about<00:00:33.530> what<00:00:33.830> I

was doing and I realized that in the
first<00:00:37.820> two<00:00:38.269> which<00:00:38.870> were<00:00:39.410> had<00:00:40.129> already<00:00:40.340> been

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.630 
and I felt that in those days in those
weeks<00:01:07.970> in<00:01:08.240> those<00:01:08.450> months<00:01:09.080> really<00:01:09.500> in<00:01:09.920> st.

Petersburg<00:01:11.180> that<00:01:11.479> I<00:01:12.020> got<00:01:13.000> to<00:01:14.000> get<00:01:14.479> quite<00:01:15.080> deep

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:15.620 
Petersburg that I got to get quite deep

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.610 
Petersburg that I got to get quite deep
and<00:01:15.890> quite<00:01:16.160> quite<00:01:16.490> close<00:01:16.880> in<00:01:17.240> to<00:01:18.050> working<00:01:18.290> with

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:18.620 
and quite quite close in to working with

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:19.560 
and quite quite close in to working with
her

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:19.570 
her

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.700 
her
I<00:01:19.600> think<00:01:20.440> first<00:01:21.160> of<00:01:21.280> all<00:01:21.450> obviously<00:01:22.500> to<00:01:23.500> be<00:01:23.530> a

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:23.710 
I think first of all obviously to be a

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.360 
I think first of all obviously to be a
great<00:01:23.770> a<00:01:24.760> very<00:01:25.030> good<00:01:25.330> dancer<00:01:26.070> you<00:01:27.070> have<00:01:27.100> to

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:27.370 
great a very good dancer you have to

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:29.900 
great a very good dancer you have to
have<00:01:27.490> a<00:01:27.520> particular<00:01:28.230> level<00:01:29.230> of<00:01:29.320> technique

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:29.910 
have a particular level of technique

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:32.460 
have a particular level of technique
because<00:01:30.910> the<00:01:31.060> technique<00:01:31.450> is<00:01:31.570> what<00:01:31.810> makes<00:01:32.290> you

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:32.470 
because the technique is what makes you

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.190 
because the technique is what makes you
free<00:01:32.890> and<00:01:33.220> I<00:01:33.760> think<00:01:33.790> this<00:01:34.150> is<00:01:34.330> the<00:01:34.510> the<00:01:34.810> case<00:01:34.990> of

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 
free and I think this is the the case of

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.150 
free and I think this is the the case of
Dion<00:01:35.710> of<00:01:35.890> it

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:36.160 
Dion of it

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:40.380 
Dion of it
she<00:01:36.550> has<00:01:36.760> this<00:01:36.940> technical<00:01:37.840> freedom<00:01:39.390> which

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:40.390 
she has this technical freedom which

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.410 
she has this technical freedom which
makes<00:01:40.660> her<00:01:40.840> able<00:01:41.710> and<00:01:42.220> makes<00:01:42.940> her<00:01:43.180> I<00:01:43.240> think

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
makes her able and makes her I think

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.230 
makes her able and makes her I think
have<00:01:43.870> the<00:01:43.900> courage<00:01:44.440> yes<00:01:44.890> to<00:01:45.310> try<00:01:45.729> to<00:01:45.790> do<00:01:46.000> very

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
have the courage yes to try to do very

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.530 
have the courage yes to try to do very
different<00:01:46.420> things<00:01:47.400> things<00:01:48.400> which<00:01:48.790> you<00:01:49.240> would

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:49.540 
different things things which you would

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.980 
different things things which you would
not<00:01:49.690> expect<00:01:50.310> her<00:01:51.310> to<00:01:51.370> do<00:01:51.670> and<00:01:52.000> and<00:01:52.300> be<00:01:52.479> able<00:01:52.600> to

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
not expect her to do and and be able to

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:58.710 
not expect her to do and and be able to
I<00:01:55.860> transform<00:01:56.860> herself<00:01:57.460> according<00:01:58.450> to<00:01:58.570> the

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:58.720 
I transform herself according to the

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.810 
I transform herself according to the
role<00:01:58.930> that<00:01:59.140> she's<00:01:59.380> doing<00:01:59.770> and<00:02:00.400> I<00:02:00.490> think<00:02:00.550> this

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:00.820 
role that she's doing and I think this

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.230 
role that she's doing and I think this
is<00:02:00.970> the<00:02:01.119> most<00:02:01.600> important<00:02:02.170> aspect<00:02:02.650> is<00:02:02.860> that<00:02:03.240> the

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 
is the most important aspect is that the

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.370 
is the most important aspect is that the

Petersburg<00:03:40.170> I<00:03:40.440> think<00:03:40.890> there's<00:03:41.070> always<00:03:41.250> been

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:41.550 
Petersburg I think there's always been

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:44.810 
Petersburg I think there's always been
the<00:03:41.730> wish<00:03:41.940> to<00:03:42.840> do<00:03:43.260> something<00:03:43.770> new<00:03:44.040> to<00:03:44.430> create

the wish to do something new to create
something<00:03:45.270> together<00:03:45.810> and<00:03:46.320> I<00:03:46.770> think<00:03:46.830> that<00:03:47.040> this

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
something together and I think that this

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.050 
something together and I think that this
is<00:03:47.610> what<00:03:47.880> the<00:03:48.210> ballet<00:03:48.630> really<00:03:49.230> is<00:03:49.610> in<00:03:50.610> this

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
is what the ballet really is in this

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.650 
is what the ballet really is in this
ballet<00:03:51.470> which<00:03:52.470> is<00:03:52.830> called<00:03:53.340> Chopin<00:03:53.790> dialogue

ballet which is called Chopin dialogue

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:58.310 
ballet which is called Chopin dialogue
because<00:03:55.200> dialogue<00:03:55.770> between<00:03:56.010> two<00:03:56.960> persons<00:03:57.960> men

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:58.320 
because dialogue between two persons men

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.800 
because dialogue between two persons men
and<00:03:58.530> a<00:03:58.620> woman<00:03:58.770> the<00:03:59.670> woman<00:03:59.820> is<00:04:00.270> the<00:04:00.510> elevation

the man is Jeff bodean when we started
the<00:04:07.350> first<00:04:07.530> thing<00:04:07.710> Deanna<00:04:08.430> said<00:04:08.670> is<00:04:08.820> what<00:04:09.150> is

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:09.270 
the first thing Deanna said is what is

the first thing Deanna said is what is
the<00:04:09.420> story<00:04:09.720> I<00:04:10.220> said<00:04:11.220> I<00:04:11.430> don't<00:04:12.330> know<00:04:13.040> you<00:04:14.040> are

the story I said I don't know you are

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:17.660 
the story I said I don't know you are
the<00:04:14.340> story<00:04:14.670> we<00:04:15.600> must<00:04:16.230> make<00:04:16.590> a<00:04:16.920> story<00:04:17.400> together

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:17.670 
the story we must make a story together

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:22.130 
the story we must make a story together
because<00:04:18.330> I<00:04:18.510> think<00:04:18.920> in<00:04:20.390> creation<00:04:21.390> means<00:04:21.570> to

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.140 
because I think in creation means to

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:23.810 
because I think in creation means to
have<00:04:22.710> something<00:04:23.070> which<00:04:23.190> never<00:04:23.430> was<00:04:23.610> there

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
have something which never was there

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:24.530 
have something which never was there
before

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:24.540 
before

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:27.530 
before
this<00:04:25.050> can<00:04:25.320> mean<00:04:25.530> I<00:04:25.830> do<00:04:26.460> a<00:04:26.610> lot<00:04:26.880> of<00:04:27.030> complicated

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540 
this can mean I do a lot of complicated

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.690 
this can mean I do a lot of complicated
steps<00:04:28.020> and<00:04:28.290> they<00:04:28.740> were<00:04:28.800> never<00:04:29.070> there<00:04:29.190> before

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:29.700 
steps and they were never there before

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:32.420 
steps and they were never there before
this<00:04:30.240> particular<00:04:30.720> combination<00:04:31.380> of<00:04:31.800> steps<00:04:32.070> was

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:32.430 
this particular combination of steps was

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:35.060 
this particular combination of steps was
never<00:04:32.700> there<00:04:32.910> before<00:04:32.940> that's<00:04:33.810> one<00:04:34.140> thing<00:04:34.470> the

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.070 
never there before that's one thing the

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:39.110 
never there before that's one thing the
other<00:04:35.100> thing<00:04:35.550> is<00:04:35.960> the<00:04:36.960> emotional<00:04:38.120> climate

within<00:04:39.630> a<00:04:39.870> piece<00:04:40.340> this<00:04:41.340> is<00:04:41.580> very<00:04:41.850> dependent<00:04:42.480> on

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
within a piece this is very dependent on

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:45.350 
within a piece this is very dependent on
what<00:04:43.320> we<00:04:43.470> would<00:04:43.620> call<00:04:43.830> the<00:04:44.010> chemistry<00:04:44.670> between

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.360 
what we would call the chemistry between

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:49.310 
what we would call the chemistry between
