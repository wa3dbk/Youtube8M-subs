00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.880 
I have this pencil sharpener so it has
two<00:01:48.600> holes<00:01:48.780> on<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.079> top<00:01:49.140> so<00:01:49.500> you<00:01:49.530> can<00:01:49.740> fit

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
two holes on the top so you can fit

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.010 
two holes on the top so you can fit
multiple<00:01:50.280> sizes<00:01:50.460> of<00:01:50.670> pencils<00:01:51.060> and<00:01:51.299> then<00:01:51.810> it

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
multiple sizes of pencils and then it

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.149 
multiple sizes of pencils and then it
has<00:01:52.170> a<00:01:52.200> locking<00:01:52.740> mechanism<00:01:52.920> so<00:01:53.490> that<00:01:53.909> way<00:01:54.090> the

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:55.159 
has a locking mechanism so that way the

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:57.160 
has a locking mechanism so that way the
the<00:01:55.219> shavings<00:01:55.999> won't<00:01:56.270> fly<00:01:56.539> out<00:01:56.749> when<00:01:56.869> you<00:01:56.990> go

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
the shavings won't fly out when you go

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.679 
the shavings won't fly out when you go
and<00:01:57.350> pick<00:01:57.469> up<00:01:57.649> the<00:01:57.799> pencil<00:01:58.100> sharpener<00:01:58.569> then<00:01:59.569> I

00:01:59.679 --> 00:01:59.689 
and pick up the pencil sharpener then I

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:01.840 
and pick up the pencil sharpener then I
have<00:01:59.840> two<00:02:00.079> packs<00:02:00.380> of<00:02:00.679> white<00:02:01.039> erasers<00:02:01.429> and<00:02:01.729> I

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
have two packs of white erasers and I

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:03.370 
have two packs of white erasers and I
prefer<00:02:02.210> the<00:02:02.390> white<00:02:02.509> erasers<00:02:02.929> because<00:02:03.109> it

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
prefer the white erasers because it

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.260 
prefer the white erasers because it
doesn't<00:02:03.619> leave<00:02:03.770> like<00:02:03.920> the<00:02:04.039> ugly<00:02:04.340> eraser<00:02:05.000> marks

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
doesn't leave like the ugly eraser marks

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.169 
doesn't leave like the ugly eraser marks
