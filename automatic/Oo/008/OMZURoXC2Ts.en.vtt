00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.750 

I<00:00:13.690> think<00:00:14.690> music<00:00:14.990> is<00:00:15.080> the<00:00:15.230> best<00:00:15.260> way<00:00:15.590> to<00:00:16.520> travel

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:16.760 
I think music is the best way to travel

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:18.250 
I think music is the best way to travel
abroad<00:00:17.000> because<00:00:17.240> you<00:00:17.570> know<00:00:17.660> you<00:00:17.750> can't<00:00:17.990> always

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:18.260 
abroad because you know you can't always

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.470 
abroad because you know you can't always
talk<00:00:18.529> to<00:00:18.680> somebody<00:00:18.890> have<00:00:19.220> a<00:00:19.480> in-depth

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:20.480 
talk to somebody have a in-depth

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:21.999 
talk to somebody have a in-depth
conversation<00:00:21.020> about<00:00:21.110> something<00:00:21.259> but<00:00:21.560> because

00:00:21.999 --> 00:00:22.009 
conversation about something but because

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:24.220 
conversation about something but because
we're<00:00:22.160> musicians<00:00:22.610> we<00:00:23.419> all<00:00:23.570> speak<00:00:23.869> the<00:00:24.110> same

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:24.230 
we're musicians we all speak the same

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:26.200 
we're musicians we all speak the same
language<00:00:24.410> on<00:00:24.950> that<00:00:25.130> front<00:00:25.520> so<00:00:25.759> we<00:00:26.029> have

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:26.210 
language on that front so we have

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:27.249 
language on that front so we have
something<00:00:26.390> we<00:00:26.599> can<00:00:26.630> relate<00:00:26.930> to<00:00:26.990> there's

00:00:27.249 --> 00:00:27.259

to<00:00:43.339> that<00:00:43.489> language<00:00:43.850> but<00:00:44.059> that<00:00:44.180> just<00:00:44.210> makes<00:00:44.540> the

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:44.750 
to that language but that just makes the

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:50.250 
to that language but that just makes the
experience<00:00:44.930> even<00:00:45.290> more<00:00:45.470> unique<00:00:48.400> personally

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:50.260

Band and I'm so into jazz and I got to

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:59.740 
Band and I'm so into jazz and I got to
go<00:00:58.250> onstage<00:00:58.460> and<00:00:58.879> solo<00:00:59.089> with<00:00:59.299> them<00:00:59.449> you<00:00:59.629> know

go onstage and solo with them you know

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:01.390 
go onstage and solo with them you know
that's<00:01:00.260> an<00:01:00.500> experience<00:01:00.739> that<00:01:00.949> I'll<00:01:01.100> never<00:01:01.129> get

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:01.400 
that's an experience that I'll never get

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.649 
that's an experience that I'll never get
again<00:01:01.549> every<00:01:03.699> we<00:01:04.699> would<00:01:04.850> play<00:01:05.089> something<00:01:05.540> and

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:05.659 
again every we would play something and

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:06.429 
again every we would play something and
they<00:01:05.720> would<00:01:05.840> play<00:01:05.960> something<00:01:06.260> and<00:01:06.350> there

00:01:06.429 --> 00:01:06.439 
they would play something and there

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:07.810 
they would play something and there
would<00:01:06.530> just<00:01:06.560> be<00:01:06.710> a<00:01:06.799> connection<00:01:07.100> there<00:01:07.580> that

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:07.820 
would just be a connection there that

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.090 
would just be a connection there that
even<00:01:08.450> if<00:01:08.570> they<00:01:09.020> spoke<00:01:09.290> Chinese<00:01:09.680> and<00:01:09.860> we<00:01:09.920> spoke

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100 
even if they spoke Chinese and we spoke

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.740 
even if they spoke Chinese and we spoke
English<00:01:10.460> and<00:01:10.490> we<00:01:10.670> couldn't<00:01:10.850> communicate<00:01:11.090> at

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:11.750 
English and we couldn't communicate at

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.109 
English and we couldn't communicate at
least<00:01:11.810> we<00:01:12.200> could<00:01:12.320> play<00:01:12.530> through<00:01:12.799> music<00:01:13.159> and<00:01:13.340> we

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:14.119 
least we could play through music and we

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:19.030 
least we could play through music and we
could<00:01:14.299> bond<00:01:14.869> that<00:01:15.170> way

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:19.040 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.320 

my<00:01:20.040> favorite<00:01:20.369> performance<00:01:20.790> was<00:01:20.880> probably<00:01:21.150> the
