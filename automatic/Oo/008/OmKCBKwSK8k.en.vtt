00:00:08.869 --> 00:00:13.579
 now yes lucerito cs4 that offers a capacity and vision of gradients a lot 

00:00:13.579 --> 00:00:16.969
 more robust that allows us a punctual color edition with the 

00:00:16.969 --> 00:00:19.969
 possibility to change its opacity 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.880
 then we are in the sun of hidalgo 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.179
 for a long time we have arrived the present without inspectors without 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:32.110
 However, it was a bit difficult to manage the 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.570
 can generate open to a rectangle by footloose leaving with the kun 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.860
 the filling in white its by January I'm going to change precisely this filling 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.150
 I'm going to tell him from when I change him for being winged 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:48.550
 let's see what is now automatically opening the panel and degraded 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:50.440
 I do not have to go look for it 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.180
 I'm fine in this case a gradient 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.570
 yes a linear d color d what the filling does that white 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:58.539
 a color d 

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:01.770
 by derek is black if my colors are by foz 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.450
 I can see that I can modify them as I used to do by writing here 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.310
 the modification directly on the ramp is being reflected in my 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:11.920
 object 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:17.659
 I first novels this as of this edition I have capacity in 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:19.940
 modify the opacity of my colors 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.280
 this case all selected this state in black I will see that it is 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.090
 selected because his clover top events healed is black 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.110
 i all lower the pension percent bill 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.070
 I am seeing that the acid option in this case must be applied here 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.630
 I was going to modify it, how would it be, I used to do it, in fact I can 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.540
 continue to do what Asia so far with the gradients generate a 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:45.830
 new side here 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:47.310
 anywhere 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.829
 is to make of them sweeping out like this all by selecting 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:56.929
 I can also change the opacity 

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:59.200
 to this other 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.220
 and it is very important originally what we had to do to change a 

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:05.610
 color was necessarily come 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:06.860
 the area of ​​colors 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.270
 i select the color however see automatically in this case by 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:14.950
 example how do I have the option to auto collapse nor did Spaniards already lose k the 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.750
 option to be seeing also the color panel that was a little bit 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.530
 complicated if it is having the different panels open like dragging a 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.429
 color towards the arrival ramp to the hotel headquarters 

00:02:24.429 --> 00:02:27.379
 or what I can follow directly change the color 

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:30.999
 from the color estoc just for example I'm going to change this white I'm going 

00:02:30.999 --> 00:02:35.629
 to double click on this already tomato that mind I have the ability to change 

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:40.079
 of drought and color in seat from colors everything from the cars you can select 

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:44.480
 any other color iata magically are being applied to that stock that I 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:45.759
 have had selected 

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:48.290
 same everything changes from quincho apaidas 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.669
 I do the same with this other color 

00:02:50.669 --> 00:02:55.219
 modified its opacity as I can duplicate for example as always 

00:02:55.219 --> 00:02:57.499
 holding the key 

00:02:57.499 --> 00:03:00.049
 there was an option 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:04.209
 I can drag I can also change this color change the opacity 

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:08.299
 and has much more control directly on the ramp 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:12.909
 could modify the midpoints arrest them if in this case for example 

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:18.419
 is line I can modify where the drought angle is this line 

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:25.129
 the options that have been here since the beginning and sectors are still 

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:28.129
 the question here is that we now have much more control i 

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:33.299
 modify the colors directly on the manipulators the stocs of color and 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:33.900
 its opacity
