just more sensible little walking shoes
and<00:00:57.700> as<00:00:58.630> it<00:00:59.380> just<00:00:59.560> seems<00:00:59.829> these<00:01:00.130> days<00:01:00.190> the

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:00.730 
and as it just seems these days the

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:03.150 
and as it just seems these days the
boots<00:01:01.390> and<00:01:01.780> shoes<00:01:02.170> like<00:01:02.500> this<00:01:02.770> is<00:01:02.980> so

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:03.160 
boots and shoes like this is so

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.100 
boots and shoes like this is so
expensive<00:01:03.460> and<00:01:04.000> it's<00:01:04.089> so<00:01:04.239> hard<00:01:04.420> to<00:01:04.509> find<00:01:04.750> some

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:05.110 
expensive and it's so hard to find some

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:07.740 
expensive and it's so hard to find some
with<00:01:05.290> proper<00:01:05.860> good<00:01:06.130> very<00:01:06.729> solid<00:01:07.240> soles<00:01:07.570> that

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:07.750 
with proper good very solid soles that

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.250 
with proper good very solid soles that
long-distance<00:01:08.530> walking<00:01:09.330> there<00:01:10.330> well<00:01:11.229> I

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:11.260 
long-distance walking there well I

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.620 
long-distance walking there well I
thought<00:01:11.590> I'd<00:01:11.740> rather<00:01:11.950> not<00:01:12.610> spend<00:01:12.880> the<00:01:13.150> fortune

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:13.630 
thought I'd rather not spend the fortune

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.050 
thought I'd rather not spend the fortune
on<00:01:13.780> a<00:01:13.810> pair<00:01:14.080> like<00:01:14.409> ant<00:01:14.680> them<00:01:14.950> previously<00:01:15.190> only

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:16.060 
on a pair like ant them previously only

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.480 
on a pair like ant them previously only
to<00:01:16.330> find<00:01:16.510> them<00:01:16.720> to<00:01:16.840> be<00:01:16.870> that<00:01:17.800> just<00:01:18.070> like

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490 
to find them to be that just like

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:20.219 
to find them to be that just like
anything<00:01:18.790> else<00:01:19.000> off<00:01:19.270> the<00:01:19.390> shelf<00:01:19.630> to<00:01:19.780> be<00:01:19.870> honest

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:20.229 
anything else off the shelf to be honest

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:22.500 
anything else off the shelf to be honest

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
ankle to keep the water out anyway but

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.600 
ankle to keep the water out anyway but

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
that's definitely a benefit obviously

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.410 
that's definitely a benefit obviously
they've<00:03:00.170> they<00:03:01.160> seemed<00:03:01.430> pretty<00:03:01.640> well<00:03:02.150> put

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
they've they seemed pretty well put

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.810 
they've they seemed pretty well put
together<00:03:02.570> a<00:03:03.080> team<00:03:03.500> this<00:03:03.800> part<00:03:04.070> here<00:03:04.310> may<00:03:04.610> be<00:03:04.640> a

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:04.820 
together a team this part here may be a

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:06.070 
together a team this part here may be a
little<00:03:05.090> bit<00:03:05.390> thin

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080 
little bit thin

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.580 
little bit thin
well<00:03:06.620> bit<00:03:06.830> firm<00:03:07.250> deeper<00:03:08.020> hopefully<00:03:09.020> they

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
well bit firm deeper hopefully they

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.260 
well bit firm deeper hopefully they
should<00:03:09.860> last<00:03:10.100> a<00:03:10.340> good<00:03:10.520> few<00:03:10.790> months<00:03:10.820> at<00:03:11.210> the

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:11.270 
should last a good few months at the

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:13.660 
should last a good few months at the
very<00:03:11.390> least<00:03:11.630> they<00:03:12.230> certainly<00:03:13.040> longer<00:03:13.490> than

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670 
very least they certainly longer than

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:16.210 
very least they certainly longer than
those<00:03:13.940> ones<00:03:14.180> there<00:03:14.570> which<00:03:14.960> is<00:03:15.200> I<00:03:15.440> believe<00:03:15.770> that

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
those ones there which is I believe that

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.460 
those ones there which is I believe that
took<00:03:16.820> me<00:03:17.090> less<00:03:17.480> than<00:03:17.540> three<00:03:17.930> months<00:03:18.230> to<00:03:18.320> get<00:03:18.410> to

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
took me less than three months to get to

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:19.900 
took me less than three months to get to
the<00:03:18.650> stage<00:03:18.860> afford<00:03:19.250> through<00:03:19.520> on<00:03:19.640> the<00:03:19.760> back

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910
