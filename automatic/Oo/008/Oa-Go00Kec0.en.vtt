00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:18.860
 Hello everyone today, I whistle Arseny 

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:23.080
 I will tell you once again about someone 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:25.880
 darling and someone is not nike composed pro 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:28.310
 I personally love how the history of these sneakers 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.619
 both their appearance and player for 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:33.020
 whom they were made but if you 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:35.450
 It is interesting to learn more about this 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:38.210
 the legendary model is on my channel 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:40.250
 There is a review for both exploration galaxy and 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.989
 to some others that may you 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.930
 interest 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:46.670
 I invite you to check them on the channel 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:49.600
 Today I have completely red in my hands 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:52.309
 1 branch well, of course, given well 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.590
 present black accents but 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:56.320
 emitter svetaki let's call her 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:58.969
 Red October 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:01.339
 nike continues to say 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:03.530
 suck the fingers from the well 

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:06.230
 past erasure collaboration with 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.720
 I think of course I have 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:10.340
 to this full right but if you donâ€™t 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.909
 like you of course and in the right 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:15.380
 choose to buy these sneakers or not 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:18.320
 skylight to this is borrowed just from 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:20.660
 second or for to the bride in the same 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.850
 but in the same color and can 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:25.880
 say partly why such a stir 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:28.670
 around this model around this release and 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.950
 Russia was not known as only two 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.920
 the store was delivered 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:36.500
 these sneakers and they cost 11,000 rubles 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.710
 Well, by the way they bought them in my for 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.990
 minutes 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:45.130
 foam material but composite at the very 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:48.039
 but it is believed that it is made of 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:52.990
 polyurethane which by the way pours into 

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:54.939
 special forms and then will say 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.979
 formed into such here sneakers 

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:59.049
 here traditionally this material 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:04.179
 present everywhere we observe it with 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:06.640
 all parties in this case still on this 

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:09.459
 but I put some polyurethane such 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:13.690
 square drawing is drawing you 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:16.900
 see well which hints in this 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.370
 case on a kind of carbon but from 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.010
 features of this foam material 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:23.140
 call what he takes with time 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.610
 the shape of our legs and gives comfort 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.860
 but for players 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.480
 because in these sneakers and play more and 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:33.320
 This material provides excellent 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:35.680
 fixing so but here it can be said in 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:39.530
 lacing area present nubuck 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:43.190
 so he can say with imitation scales 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:47.950
 and here it also passes at the heel 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:47.950
 show it from all sides and take a closer look 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:53.360
 plunder this model I did not like 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:55.760
 I said the video on the channel I have other 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:58.780
 there are colors there and everything is there 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:01.280
 said in detail but hinted to you that 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.300
 the entire length of this model is present 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.010
 inner boot 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:05.900
 and here are two such loops for him 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:11.090
 quick and simple 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:13.820
 viewed from the front of the tendon but 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:16.940
 now move on to the sole as always 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:18.830
 in the middle of this model is present 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:22.280
 powerful such a thoroughly carbonic 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:24.170
 plate well and here it prevents 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:27.080
 twisting these sneakers and attached 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:30.010
 responsiveness but now here in front of you and 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:32.750
 drawing this sole 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:35.390
 black such you see islets will name 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:36.709
 their so made of rubber and drawing 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:38.870
 presented in the form of a Christmas tree 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:43.010
 Well, by the way I will say that the soles are not 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:45.650
 glows and here it is still visible 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:47.810
 technology name here you see it 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:49.970
 means that over the entire length and this 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:52.310
 the soles and inside is present air 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:55.700
 balloon which of course is responsible for 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:58.459
 comfort and cushioning from logos 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:01.959
 I'll call a big audible soles here he 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:04.250
 The same plastic logo is already 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:05.920
 present from the outside of this 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:09.080
 models 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:14.239
 he also embroidered with laces here he is small 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:18.410
 and the words found carries are seen on 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:22.400
 so here is a loop behind it, well, under it 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:24.650
 again we see embroidered red services well and 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.150
 I almost forgot to say like 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:29.070
 additional hint of such 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:32.280
 luxury of this model 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:35.760
 these sneakers will see the tips well 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:38.220
 called glad and shoelaces like that 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:40.980
 golden color so I think it looks like 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:43.850
 cool enough well I understand perfectly 

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:46.680
 that there is a matter of taste someone like 

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:49.050
 new colors on the legendary 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:51.060
 models and someone not but for me personally 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:53.400
 it is the dawn of interest itself 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:56.130
 represents otherwise I would not buy it myself 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:57.600
 but generally speaking about the model 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:00.300
 many who have been following my channel for a long time 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:02.070
 aware that the family sneakers opposites 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:04.860
 are among my favorite 

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:08.010
 both for playing and for the street 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:10.340
