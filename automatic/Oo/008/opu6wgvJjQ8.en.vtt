00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.020 
screw and then his 14-karat hand forged
crown<00:01:09.689> which<00:01:10.680> I<00:01:11.040> think<00:01:11.430> really<00:01:11.580> makes<00:01:11.729> a

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
crown which I think really makes a

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.320 
crown which I think really makes a
difference<00:01:12.060> it's<00:01:12.900> a<00:01:13.049> a<00:01:13.760> bigger<00:01:14.760> crown<00:01:15.090> than

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
difference it's a a bigger crown than

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.440 
difference it's a a bigger crown than
your<00:01:15.509> average<00:01:15.890> head<00:01:16.890> crown<00:01:17.580> and<00:01:17.939> it<00:01:18.240> goes

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
your average head crown and it goes

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:19.999 
your average head crown and it goes
deeper<00:01:18.869> into<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:19.170> head<00:01:19.380> joint<00:01:19.680> maybe<00:01:19.890> a

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
deeper into the head joint maybe a

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.609 
deeper into the head joint maybe a
quarter<00:01:20.369> inch<00:01:20.549> or<00:01:20.700> so<00:01:21.140> whereas<00:01:22.140> some<00:01:22.380> just

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
quarter inch or so whereas some just

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.020 
quarter inch or so whereas some just
barely<00:01:22.860> go<00:01:23.189> inside<00:01:25.340> I'm<00:01:26.340> gonna<00:01:26.460> take<00:01:26.670> off<00:01:26.880> the

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
barely go inside I'm gonna take off the

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.289 
barely go inside I'm gonna take off the
crown<00:01:27.330> because<00:01:29.150> it's<00:01:30.150> got<00:01:30.329> a<00:01:30.360> really<00:01:30.600> unique<00:01:30.720> I

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:32.299 
crown because it's got a really unique I

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:35.719 
crown because it's got a really unique I
call<00:01:33.299> it<00:01:33.420> a<00:01:33.479> gold<00:01:33.750> Bell<00:01:34.049> crown<00:01:34.579> because<00:01:35.579> it

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
call it a gold Bell crown because it

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.429 
call it a gold Bell crown because it
rings<00:01:36.380> so<00:01:37.380> if<00:01:37.500> I<00:01:37.619> hold<00:01:37.799> it<00:01:37.979> up<00:01:38.130> here<00:01:39.259> cap<00:01:40.259> it

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
rings so if I hold it up here cap it

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:45.569 
rings so if I hold it up here cap it
lightly<00:01:40.619> with<00:01:40.829> a<00:01:40.890> pencil

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:45.579 

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:47.639 

it's<00:01:46.030> got<00:01:46.150> a<00:01:46.180> real<00:01:46.329> nice<00:01:46.479> ring<00:01:46.750> to<00:01:46.780> it<00:01:46.990> I<00:01:47.259> don't

00:01:47.639 --> 00:01:47.649 
it's got a real nice ring to it I don't

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:49.109 
it's got a real nice ring to it I don't
know<00:01:47.710> if<00:01:47.799> that<00:01:47.950> ring<00:01:48.130> does<00:01:48.399> anything<00:01:48.700> for<00:01:49.000> the

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:49.119 
know if that ring does anything for the

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:52.319 
know if that ring does anything for the
sound<00:01:49.390> but<00:01:49.689> sure<00:01:50.680> it's<00:01:50.829> pretty<00:01:50.979> I<00:01:51.329> think

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:52.329 
sound but sure it's pretty I think

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:55.289 
sound but sure it's pretty I think
because<00:01:53.320> this<00:01:53.470> one<00:01:53.649> is<00:01:53.799> hollowed<00:01:54.159> out<00:01:54.310> inside

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:55.299 
because this one is hollowed out inside

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:59.190 
because this one is hollowed out inside
I<00:01:56.100> think<00:01:57.100> that<00:01:57.250> between<00:01:57.640> the<00:01:57.930> well<00:01:58.930> the<00:01:59.049> air

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
I think that between the well the air

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.260 
I think that between the well the air
space<00:01:59.530> between<00:01:59.950> the<00:02:00.100> top<00:02:00.310> of<00:02:00.340> the<00:02:00.610> stopper<00:02:01.060> and

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
space between the top of the stopper and

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.270 
space between the top of the stopper and
then<00:02:01.810> the<00:02:01.930> inside<00:02:02.259> of<00:02:02.439> this<00:02:02.560> crown<00:02:02.830> perhaps

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
then the inside of this crown perhaps

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.529 
then the inside of this crown perhaps
creates<00:02:03.729> a<00:02:04.110> nice<00:02:05.110> resonance<00:02:05.710> chamber<00:02:06.220> I<00:02:06.539> do

00:02:07.529 --> 00:02:07.539 
creates a nice resonance chamber I do

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:09.630 
creates a nice resonance chamber I do
feel<00:02:07.810> the<00:02:07.990> flute<00:02:08.229> vibrate<00:02:08.739> more<00:02:09.039> than<00:02:09.280> they

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
feel the flute vibrate more than they

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.640 
feel the flute vibrate more than they
used<00:02:09.670> to<00:02:10.000> when<00:02:10.569> I<00:02:10.599> hold<00:02:10.840> it<00:02:10.959> in<00:02:11.050> my<00:02:11.110> hands<00:02:11.560> and

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
used to when I hold it in my hands and

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:12.780 
used to when I hold it in my hands and
play<00:02:11.860> notes<00:02:12.130> it's<00:02:12.370> like<00:02:12.519> the<00:02:12.640> whole

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
play notes it's like the whole

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.940 
play notes it's like the whole
instrument<00:02:13.150> is<00:02:13.480> vibrating<00:02:14.140> in<00:02:14.260> my<00:02:14.290> hands<00:02:14.800> a

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950
