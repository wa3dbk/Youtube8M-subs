so<00:01:34.320> let's<00:01:34.590> see<00:01:35.369> how<00:01:35.490> these<00:01:35.670> go<00:01:36.420> into<00:01:36.780> the

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
so let's see how these go into the

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:53.690 
so let's see how these go into the
pattern<00:01:37.229> I'll<00:01:37.350> try<00:01:37.560> to<00:01:37.619> play<00:01:37.740> slowly

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.100 

so<00:01:54.700> now<00:01:54.940> that<00:01:55.030> we've<00:01:55.210> learned<00:01:55.420> how<00:01:55.630> to<00:01:55.750> do<00:01:55.990> our

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
so now that we've learned how to do our

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:58.200 
so now that we've learned how to do our
pull<00:01:56.290> offs<00:01:56.440> let's<00:01:56.740> see<00:01:56.920> how<00:01:57.100> they<00:01:57.370> work<00:01:57.820> in<00:01:58.060> our

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.210 
pull offs let's see how they work in our

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:00.150 
pull offs let's see how they work in our
three<00:01:58.480> chord<00:01:58.660> groove<00:01:59.050> if<00:01:59.350> you<00:01:59.530> refer<00:01:59.830> to<00:02:00.010> video

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:00.160 
three chord groove if you refer to video

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.430 
three chord groove if you refer to video
one<00:02:00.490> you'll<00:02:00.730> find<00:02:00.760> that<00:02:01.240> those<00:02:01.480> chords<00:02:01.930> are<00:02:02.200> a

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:02.440 
one you'll find that those chords are a

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:07.320 
one you'll find that those chords are a
minor<00:02:03.310> seven<00:02:03.930> D<00:02:04.930> minor<00:02:05.170> seven<00:02:05.850> and<00:02:06.850> E<00:02:07.060> minor

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:07.330 
minor seven D minor seven and E minor

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.410 
minor seven D minor seven and E minor
seven<00:02:08.070> I'll<00:02:09.070> play<00:02:09.310> it<00:02:09.369> slowly<00:02:09.670> and<00:02:10.030> then<00:02:10.390> a

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
seven I'll play it slowly and then a

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:13.170 
seven I'll play it slowly and then a
little<00:02:10.690> faster<00:02:11.130> if<00:02:12.130> I<00:02:12.280> can<00:02:12.460> manage<00:02:12.730> it<00:02:12.850> there

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
little faster if I can manage it there

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.240 
little faster if I can manage it there
may<00:02:13.420> be<00:02:13.450> some<00:02:13.870> improvisation<00:02:14.710> in<00:02:14.860> here<00:02:15.040> since

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
may be some improvisation in here since

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:16.560 
may be some improvisation in here since
I<00:02:15.370> don't<00:02:15.520> play<00:02:15.700> the<00:02:15.850> same<00:02:16.030> way<00:02:16.240> every<00:02:16.540> time

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:16.570 
I don't play the same way every time

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:42.600 
I don't play the same way every time
let's<00:02:17.140> see<00:02:17.320> how<00:02:17.410> it<00:02:17.530> goes<00:02:41.340> something<00:02:42.340> like

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
let's see how it goes something like

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.340 
let's see how it goes something like
that<00:02:42.790> you<00:02:42.970> can<00:02:43.150> make<00:02:43.180> up<00:02:43.300> your<00:02:43.450> own<00:02:43.600> version<00:02:43.690> so
