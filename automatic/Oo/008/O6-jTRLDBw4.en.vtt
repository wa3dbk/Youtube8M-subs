00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
so that's on the bottom next we take

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.060 
so that's on the bottom next we take
your<00:01:11.640> other<00:01:11.820> multi<00:01:12.210> brick<00:01:12.450> and<00:01:13.409> you<00:01:13.439> put<00:01:13.740> it<00:01:13.860> on

your other multi brick and you put it on
the<00:01:14.460> top<00:01:14.670> of<00:01:14.880> it<00:01:15.619> finally<00:01:16.619> you<00:01:17.040> take<00:01:17.240> your

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
the top of it finally you take your

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.289 
the top of it finally you take your
white<00:01:18.540> 1<00:01:19.170> by<00:01:19.320> 1<00:01:19.560> smooth<00:01:20.490> and<00:01:20.790> you<00:01:20.880> put<00:01:21.030> it<00:01:21.150> on

white 1 by 1 smooth and you put it on

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.249 
white 1 by 1 smooth and you put it on
the<00:01:21.479> end<00:01:21.659> so<00:01:22.439> it<00:01:22.560> should<00:01:22.770> look<00:01:22.799> like<00:01:22.979> this<00:01:24.259> next

the end so it should look like this next

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:30.170 
the end so it should look like this next
you<00:01:25.530> take<00:01:25.560> your<00:01:25.920> 4<00:01:26.189> wheels<00:01:26.460> and<00:01:28.759> you<00:01:29.759> put<00:01:30.000> them

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
on like that on the sides so it should

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.179 
on like that on the sides so it should
come<00:01:37.890> out<00:01:38.009> to<00:01:38.790> look<00:01:38.970> like<00:01:39.299> this<00:01:40.100> now<00:01:41.100> the
