goes isn't the world of warcraft one
start<00:04:57.880> at<00:04:57.940> the<00:04:58.030> top<00:04:58.240> and<00:04:58.300> go<00:04:58.600> down<00:04:59.970> this<00:05:00.970> one

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:01.330 
start at the top and go down this one

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:03.870 
start at the top and go down this one
seems<00:05:01.660> weird<00:05:01.990> but<00:05:02.110> oddly<00:05:02.410> enough<00:05:02.740> this<00:05:03.639> way

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:03.880 
seems weird but oddly enough this way

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:06.330 
seems weird but oddly enough this way
probably<00:05:04.210> makes<00:05:04.600> more<00:05:04.810> sense<00:05:05.200> to<00:05:06.010> start<00:05:06.190> at

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:06.340 
probably makes more sense to start at

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:12.870 
probably makes more sense to start at
the<00:05:06.370> bottom<00:05:06.520> and<00:05:06.760> go<00:05:06.910> up<00:05:08.490> doesn't<00:05:09.490> it<00:05:10.410> yes<00:05:11.880> well

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:12.880 
the bottom and go up doesn't it yes well

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:16.740 
the bottom and go up doesn't it yes well
