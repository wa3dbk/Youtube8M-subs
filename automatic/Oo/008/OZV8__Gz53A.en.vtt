even using them at all I'm a little
confused<00:01:43.229> as<00:01:43.439> to<00:01:43.470> why<00:01:43.619> they<00:01:43.799> banned<00:01:44.040> all<00:01:44.220> the

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
confused as to why they banned all the

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.499 
confused as to why they banned all the
assault<00:01:44.640> streaks<00:01:44.909> because<00:01:45.149> they're<00:01:45.270> really

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
assault streaks because they're really

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.260 
assault streaks because they're really
they're<00:01:45.990> really<00:01:46.170> not<00:01:46.290> that<00:01:46.439> good<00:01:46.619> anyway<00:01:47.009> and

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
they're really not that good anyway and

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.999 
they're really not that good anyway and
I<00:01:48.270> really<00:01:48.509> didn't<00:01:48.840> foresee<00:01:49.500> anyone<00:01:49.829> getting

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
I really didn't foresee anyone getting

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.560 
I really didn't foresee anyone getting
up<00:01:50.189> to<00:01:50.280> like<00:01:50.399> a<00:01:50.430> low-key<00:01:50.850> strike<00:01:51.119> or<00:01:51.299> anything

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
up to like a low-key strike or anything

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.960 
up to like a low-key strike or anything
like<00:01:51.600> that<00:01:51.750> so<00:01:52.200> I<00:01:52.610> don't<00:01:53.610> know<00:01:53.670> I<00:01:53.700> guess<00:01:53.850> they

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
like that so I don't know I guess they

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.370 
like that so I don't know I guess they
don't<00:01:54.060> want<00:01:54.240> people<00:01:54.270> spamming<00:01:54.720> satcoms

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
don't want people spamming satcoms

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.440 
don't want people spamming satcoms
everywhere<00:01:55.829> which<00:01:56.130> I<00:01:56.430> guess<00:01:56.640> makes<00:01:56.820> sense<00:01:57.240> so

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
everywhere which I guess makes sense so

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.030 
everywhere which I guess makes sense so
the<00:01:57.930> only<00:01:58.049> thing<00:01:58.140> they<00:01:58.320> can<00:01:58.380> use<00:01:58.799> is

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
the only thing they can use is

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.719 
the only thing they can use is
specialist<00:01:59.579> so<00:02:00.420> if<00:02:01.140> you<00:02:01.229> take<00:02:01.409> a<00:02:01.439> look<00:02:01.729> here

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
specialist so if you take a look here

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.820 
specialist so if you take a look here
you<00:02:03.630> can<00:02:03.780> also<00:02:03.930> see<00:02:04.350> that

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:05.830 
you can also see that

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.020 
you can also see that
they<00:02:06.830> banned<00:02:07.010> a<00:02:07.130> few<00:02:07.280> more<00:02:07.430> things<00:02:07.700> like<00:02:07.940> the

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
they banned a few more things like the

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.870 
they banned a few more things like the
MSBs<00:02:08.569> which<00:02:09.020> we<00:02:09.979> all<00:02:10.130> knew<00:02:10.310> would<00:02:10.459> get<00:02:10.640> banned

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:10.880 
MSBs which we all knew would get banned

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.030 
MSBs which we all knew would get banned
they<00:02:11.870> banned<00:02:12.050> all<00:02:12.230> the<00:02:12.350> marks<00:02:12.560> and<00:02:12.680> rifles

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
they banned all the marks and rifles

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.590 
they banned all the marks and rifles
because<00:02:13.250> they're<00:02:13.430> basically<00:02:13.790> just<00:02:14.060> two<00:02:14.360> shot

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
because they're basically just two shot

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.330 
because they're basically just two shot
kills<00:02:14.870> one<00:02:15.140> shot<00:02:15.319> kills<00:02:15.560> to<00:02:15.680> the<00:02:15.740> head<00:02:15.920> they're

kills one shot kills to the head they're

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.699 
kills one shot kills to the head they're
basically<00:02:16.459> like<00:02:16.760> mobile<00:02:17.720> sniper<00:02:18.260> rifles

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
basically like mobile sniper rifles

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:20.440 
basically like mobile sniper rifles
which<00:02:18.860> are<00:02:19.160> basically<00:02:19.400> just<00:02:19.819> marksman<00:02:20.180> rifles

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
which are basically just marksman rifles

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.000 
which are basically just marksman rifles
anyway<00:02:20.720> because<00:02:20.900> people<00:02:21.290> can<00:02:21.410> so<00:02:21.560> quick<00:02:21.770> scope

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:45.890 
round and then they'll basically the

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:47.259 
round and then they'll basically the
