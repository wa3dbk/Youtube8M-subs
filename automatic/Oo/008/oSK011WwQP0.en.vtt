00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:10.160
 i 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:19.270
 hello today we are going to talk about 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:21.040
 something very important and about this about 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:23.910
 WayÃºu and severe frequent questions 

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:26.010
 on the console 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.450
 with the output of this console a lot 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.020
 many people who have been filled with 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:33.989
 ask your head what if you can do 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:37.230
 coffee with the wii u that serves for something 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.670
 that how strong the control vibrates but 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.350
 good in order to answer all your 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.720
 questions have I made this video where I'm going 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.710
 to answer the most frequently asked questions 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:49.390
 that have been done about the wii 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.390
 then we went 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:57.040
 So far there are two editions of 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:59.380
 pride for our continent euros 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:01.300
 divisions in Europe and in Asia but that 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:04.720
 we are not going to touch it at this moment 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:09.390
 basic edition has a console 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:12.160
 wii and a gamepad 8 gb internal memory 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.650
 a sensor bar that is the same as 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:18.590
 is used in the wii in charge for the 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:20.990
 gamepad and an HDMI cable 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:23.119
 the edition of lux has the same 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.429
 that brings the basic edition only that in 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:28.130
 place of 8 gigabytes memory this account 

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:30.159
 with 32 gigabytes plus it brings 3 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.869
 bases for the gamepad and the console 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:34.789
 includes the game of nintendo land and 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:38.350
 they also include the premium subscription 

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:38.350
 to the nintendo network 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.600
 according to broadcom who were the ones that together 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.610
 with inmates they developed the wii and the 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.110
 gamepad supposedly should 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:53.960
 Support 30 meters when playing 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.420
 however elements like the wind and 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.830
 other wireless connections 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:00.020
 radio frequencies and even the 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:02.720
 walls will make the distance look 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:07.430
 affected so for all this to the 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:09.560
 Actual distance is 8 to 10 meters 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:11.180
 although nintendo claims that the gamepad is 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.250
 compatible with signal amplifiers 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:16.150
 so go with the military and 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.150
 buy an antenna 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.980
 like in all videogames this is going to 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:24.659
 have to depend on the game you are 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.000
 playing but for example some games 

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:30.330
 as nintendo land they will support up 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.830
 5 players on the same console in the 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.750
 same room 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:36.520
 four players using the controls 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.800
 of the wing in any its versions 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:40.840
 although although here you have to take in 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.490
 realize that some games are not going to 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.190
 let use the wii control you get 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:47.290
 the wii motionplus if you do it is a 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:50.460
 past the balls and the fifth 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.460
 control would be the game pack 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:57.260
 To date , no games that 

00:02:55.219 --> 00:02:59.120
 can support 2 gamepads at the same 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.099
 time however nintendo has not yet 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.900
 said that this is not such a possibility 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:04.730
 that maybe in the future play with 2 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:08.109
 gamepads may be a possibility but 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.109
 for now it is impossible 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.569
 All wii games are compatible 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:18.010
 with the wii and obviously the gamepad does not 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:20.260
 it will be able to be used while you play 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.540
 a Wii game and you play so 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:25.000
 identical as you play in your wii and 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.530
 regarding the games of the game cube the 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.329
 console alone will not be able to read 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:29.319
 the games of the wind however so 

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:32.560
 how to go with the super game 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:34.359
 nintendo and the cne if the arcades that 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.879
 had nintendo we are going to put the 

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:38.349
 sale in the virtual store so in 

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:40.269
 a few weeks or months can no longer be 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:42.849
 download our favorite games from 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:45.720
 game cube from the store without having to 

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:45.720
 pay for them again 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:53.910
 if you love those achievements and 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:56.129
 trophies that you think does not tribe and one goes 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:58.470
 to have no trophy system or 

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:59.730
 of achievements since according to attempt it deals with 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:02.190
 avoid the same path you are taking 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:05.280
 the competition so not the wii one goes 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:07.500
 to have an internal system of achievements and 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.420
 trophies however there are going to be some 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:12.130
 games that do have their own system 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:14.830
 of achievements or trophies 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:16.270
 for those who like portal are going to 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:18.550
 feel identified with this since 

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:20.670
 portal has a similar thing inside the 

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:20.670
 game 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:27.530
 so far the attempt has not said anything 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:29.660
 about if they are going to put some application 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:31.730
 some channel inside the widget in which 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:33.590
 you can read dvds or blu rays the 

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:35.540
 wii games are a bluray created 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:37.610
 specifically by nintendo for the 

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:42.700
 console so you can say it's a 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:42.700
 exclusive murray of nintendo 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:49.060
 just like on consoles 

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:51.280
 past some wii games you are going to 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:53.680
 to be able to produce in full hd is 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:55.629
 say to 1080 however also like 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:59.159
 some previous games not all 

00:04:55.629 --> 00:04:59.159
 games will support this resolution 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:06.790
 this is how nintendo gives us the ease of 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:09.430
 be able to transfer some of the data 

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:10.600
 from wii the wii u this will benefit 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:12.760
 closely all the people who 

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:14.800
 they came to buy some game in the 

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:16.570
 online store attempt yet 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:18.370
 what is not going to be able to happen are the 

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:20.320
 files of those games that you bought in 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:23.020
 line is if you get off the 'super 

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:24.820
 mario ' rpg for the nintendo for wii 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:26.830
 the data you have about that game does not 

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:28.990
 they will be able to transfer even if this 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:32.860
 method could fail if your wii 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:35.200
 have a chip or some software installed 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:38.020
 that does not belong nintendo in damn 

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:39.880
 pirates well these are the questions that 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:41.590
