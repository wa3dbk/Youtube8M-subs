00:00:06.129 --> 00:00:11.110
Hi I'm Joe weisenfelder with cars.com we did
a seperate video on the 2012 tesla model s

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:15.840
electric car discussing the general aspects
in driving now we're gonna concentrate on

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:23.390
issues of range, charging times and also some
unintended consequences of features we showed

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.340
in the other video and some of the other quirks
as well.

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.310
there are 3 battery sizes available or soon
to be available for the model s.

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.800
theres 40, 60, 85 kilowatt hour battery.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.980
the larger it is the more it costs and the
ranges start, lets start with this one the

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:45.320
largest battery rated up to 300 miles of range
per charge.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:51.240
the middle one is rated at 230 miles of range
thats the up 2 number and the smallest battery

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:52.380
pack 160.

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:58.440
most of the model s charging can be done with
this mobile charging cord that comes with

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.910
the car now its still a proprietary system
it doesn't use the same connector that most

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:06.700
of the other electric cars use but it is at
least smaller and easier.

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.670
now there are a Number of different attachments
for the other end.

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:18.560
heres the simplest it is for a houshold 110
120 volt outlet attach it like this, you plug

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:26.350
it in you get a green light on your box here
and then you go over to the car plug it in.

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:31.970
once the cord is energized you bring it over
here push the button and it pops open the

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:33.080
charge door which is pretty hidden.

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:39.069
the rest is pretty simple plug it on in first
it goes blue to say im talking to the charge

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:42.460
box and then it turns green and pulsates that
means your charging.

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:48.579
at the same time the green indicator on the
box on the other end shows flow.

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:54.399
this is known as level one charging it delivers
less than 1.5 kilowatts.

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:58.469
the problem is it is practically pointless
for a car like this.

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:04.139
it adds roughly 5 miles of range for every
hour of of charging the next level of charging

00:02:04.139 --> 00:02:09.349
its called level 2 thats the kind you'll find
out in public and if you EV before you probably

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:11.790
have level 2 charging at home.

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.530
that has a different kind of connector but
that has an adapter so the regular pistol

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:21.660
grip you find its call J1772 you put that
in one end and go directly into the charge

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.070
port you don't use that separate cord at all.

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:31.390
what this does is it essentially quadruples
the current you're giving the car about 6.6

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.370
kilowatts and that gives you about 20 miles
of range for every hour of charging.

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:41.260
where tesla really earns its stripes is its
ability to charge even fast even at home we

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:48.100
go back to the cord as before instead of using
the 120 volt plug there are a number of different

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.720
240 bolt plugs you can attach.

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.770
this one happens to be the type that is the
most common on camp grounds and such now this

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:01.110
will provide enough current to the car to
deliver more than 9 kilowatts at a time and

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:06.580
that gives you about 30 31 miles of range
for every hour of charging.

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:11.100
thats faster than any other electric car on
the market unless you go to the quick charging

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.090
systems which i don't think anyones gonna
own at home.

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:18.850
the good thing about this is that with this
provided apparatus is that all you need is

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:23.060
the outlet so you dont need to invest in a
level two unit.

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.670
now this leads us to some of the shortcomings
and unintended consequences.

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:31.990
remember when this door was closed we got
near it with our plug and it popped open because

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:37.510
it knew it was there if you're charging using
a level 2 unit even at home it won't recognize

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:38.510
it.

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:43.500
so you have to pop this thing its not on the
key fob as it is on the chevy volt. thats

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:44.500
annoying.

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:49.370
whats also annoying as you get in to pop it
you cant just reach it you have to get in

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.100
and sit in the seat because the seat sensors
is what tells the car to turn on once the

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:59.030
car turns on you can reach to the center control
panel to that touch screen and unlock it.

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:02.950
then theres the Interesting door handles they
serve a purpose to keep the car sleek and

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:07.430
aero dynamic and they're certainly cool but
they're not very consistent.

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:10.170
sometimes they work sometimes they don't.

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:16.039
theres a good number of not yets in this car.
for example for the backup camera it doesn't

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:20.440
show you the lines for where your fender's
gonna be backing but its coming.

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:26.290
also not here yet any means of setting it
up to pre cool or pre heat the cabin which

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:28.210
pretty much is standard.

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:33.780
and then frustrating the darn butt sensor.
which turns the car off when you get out you

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:37.510
can't even get in the car turn the heater
on turn the heater on and then get out.

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:41.470
because you get out turns the car off stops
heating the car.

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:45.690
butt sensor causes other problems for us for
one thing its kind of a dead man switch.

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:50.100
if you open the door and get out it assumes
you don't know the cars on or maybe its even

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:56.290
in gear and you don't know it as a result,
sometimes i'll be backing up, lean to the

00:04:56.290 --> 00:05:01.810
side, the butt sensor thinks i'm gone and
the car will hit park really hard.

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:07.120
unintended deceleration one of the reasons
that happens is because the car doesn't pre

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:12.530
forward or pre back when its in drive or reverse
its called idol creep so thats a feature thats

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:17.210
coming and when i say its coming its not just
coming on future model S vehicles its coming

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:22.930
to this one and this is one of the big advantages
of this type of car, this type of display

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:27.590
and the lack of physical buttons is they can
change it they can evolve it over time and

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:31.530
these software updates come wirelessly they
come in the middle of the night.

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:34.170
you come out in the morning and all the sudden
you've got new features.

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:39.310
so all of the little things I've been mentioning
that bug me having to lean in and hit that

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:45.300
button and having the charge port not open
a lot of that stuff can be addressed through

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:47.800
software.

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:53.010
initially i thought that the missing feature
and quirks made this essentially an unfinished

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:58.240
car it was annoying to me but after a while
understanding how they can update it things

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:03.520
changed for me not when chevy and nissan came
out with their electric cars and they had

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:07.570
a few things they needed to address everyone
criticized them oh how can you use your owners

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:12.840
as beta testers but it seems like the early
buyers of these cars actually want to be beta

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:18.090
testers they're feeding back to tesla and
they feel like their part of this movement.

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:24.290
a new scrappy company thats just getting started
so i do appreciate what they've done and i

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:33.870
think i do appreciate more what they're trying
to do.
