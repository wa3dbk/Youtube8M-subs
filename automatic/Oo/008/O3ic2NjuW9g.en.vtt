going<00:03:54.090> into<00:03:54.329> the<00:03:54.419> cards<00:03:54.780> when<00:03:54.959> I<00:03:54.989> take<00:03:55.230> the

00:03:55.339 --> 00:03:55.349 
going into the cards when I take the

00:03:55.349 --> 00:04:00.740 
going into the cards when I take the
shot<00:03:56.480> I'm<00:03:57.480> hooked<00:03:57.659> up<00:03:57.780> via<00:03:57.810> USB<00:03:58.349> 3<00:03:59.629> to<00:04:00.629> my

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
shot I'm hooked up via USB 3 to my

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:03.050 
shot I'm hooked up via USB 3 to my
laptop<00:04:00.959> to<00:04:01.349> a<00:04:01.379> program<00:04:01.739> called<00:04:01.879> capture<00:04:02.879> one

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
laptop to a program called capture one

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.899 
laptop to a program called capture one
and<00:04:03.329> so<00:04:04.230> it<00:04:04.980> just<00:04:05.010> allows<00:04:05.250> me<00:04:05.400> to<00:04:05.669> get<00:04:05.790> a<00:04:05.819> better

00:04:05.899 --> 00:04:05.909 
and so it just allows me to get a better

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:09.890 
and so it just allows me to get a better
view<00:04:06.209> of<00:04:06.500> the<00:04:07.790> photograph<00:04:08.790> and<00:04:09.120> also<00:04:09.419> it's

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
view of the photograph and also it's

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:11.390 
view of the photograph and also it's
easier<00:04:10.139> to<00:04:10.230> check<00:04:10.379> light<00:04:10.590> make<00:04:10.829> sure<00:04:10.919> my<00:04:11.040> focus

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
easier to check light make sure my focus

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:12.860 
easier to check light make sure my focus
is<00:04:11.519> on<00:04:11.639> running<00:04:11.969> I<00:04:12.209> don't<00:04:12.480> use<00:04:12.599> a<00:04:12.629> light<00:04:12.840> meter

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870
