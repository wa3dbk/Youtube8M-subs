00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:20.430
 hello everyone and if they eat 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.380
 leaders and let's see here on moon the 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.210
 what is the meaning of the 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.240
 song of matches since it is the song 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.820
 official of shangrilá but that is here 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.680
 in the world and because that song when 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.710
 we activate it and it is here in one 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:37.200
 of computers sounds like this 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.540
 different from what we usually 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.720
 listen to it when we're here in blood 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.720
 the 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.129
 as you are seeing it sounds like a 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.890
 video game with a little machine 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.899
 recreational because it sounds if the song of 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.790
 for idol already and why is that here 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.460
 Oria good wall song 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:58.500
 remember that one for idol is already 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.230
 when you so that you understand 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.210
 it's good when we see an image 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.720
 through an object for example 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:09.420
 we remember something a face a face a 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.759
 Animal whatever through an object 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.640
 as for example through the clouds 

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:17.759
 or through a stone in a stone 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.580
 we see remind us of a face not but 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:23.550
 They tend to be mostly the best because 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:27.030
 things that we remember what 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:29.160
 we have in memory then because the 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.500
 song that of park idol is already in 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:34.940
 shangrila 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:37.610
 because that song means everything 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:40.610
 what that blanket remembers of his game 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:44.030
 of the game he did with mehdi in the 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:47.450
 his room there in at the risk but 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:49.070
 what she said when they were dating 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.470
 from that room when we were in 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:54.590
 origins and we saw it in the cinematic 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:57.970
 he said to eddie calm ed and my father 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:00.830
 he says he has a plan because that plan 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:03.649
 did somehow that we did not 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:06.259
 we know that the game of samantha and edith 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:08.600
 came true when we 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:12.560
 we play here in moon that still not 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:15.280
 we had played neither black ops 2 nor 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:18.530
 we had come to origins here still 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:21.760
 this was the samantha game we 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:24.140
 we were doing his game then 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:27.050
 because you heard the song of 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:29.840
 pareidolia so because this 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:33.080
 it meant that the samantha game 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:35.390
 it was still a game had not been 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:37.319
 become reality and that's why the 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.900
 song of pareidolia is heard 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:43.560
 like a recreational machine like a 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.790
 game because he had not made his 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.459
 game 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:50.609
 it had not come alive but because in 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:54.420
 shangrilá is heard differently 

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:59.200
 because that game in shangrilá 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:03:01.930
 is reality become reality 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:04.000
 and because it becomes reality then 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.430
 because in shangrila when we do the 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.330
 interest an eclipse is formed not the 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:11.630
 Sun eclipse 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:15.500
 because at the time of that eclipse is 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:17.420
 when that game came true as 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:20.180
 we already know 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:23.540
 that's why samantha was telling my father 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:26.270
 he says he has a plan and that plan 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.710
 made reality when that eclipse was 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:30.430
 formed 

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:32.540
 and that 's why he 's an agent of the secret group 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:35.750
 takeo de ence nikolai rostov in 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:38.420
 they were in shangrila at that time 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:40.280
 of the eclipse passed through there but 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:43.180
 we did not see them because they were 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.180
 in another time line 

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:50.410
 the pareidolia came true that 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:52.870
 she saw those memories in her game 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:55.990
 those images that they see she saw in 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:59.230
 his game came true 

00:03:55.990 --> 00:04:03.209
 why here in moon 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:03.209
 that song was a game 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:10.520
 but all that game became real and 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:12.910
 all this happened in the pyramid 

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:15.330
 with her 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:18.090
 it became reality 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:20.109
 at the time that maxis made that 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:22.419
 game became real 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:25.810
 and I repeat why this song is there 

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:29.379
 in shangrila because she from that 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:32.910
 he entered the pyramid he received the punishment 

00:04:29.379 --> 00:04:37.020
 eternal and being in the other dimension 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:39.720
 samantha can see everything there is no time 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:43.290
 there is no space time and she can see 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:46.800
 everything that happens on all the maps in 

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:48.180
 all that was his game and then at 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:52.229
 see him 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:55.169
 it became a reality the ideal couple I hope 

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:57.659
 that you have understood the meaning 

00:04:55.169 --> 00:05:00.090
 of the song of pareidolia in moon la 

00:04:57.659 --> 00:05:04.759
 story that after being a game it 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:04.759
 made reality until the next video
