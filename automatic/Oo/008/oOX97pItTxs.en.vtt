00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:07.049
 flying has always been one of the 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.420
 dreams most valued by the human being 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.010
 but there's been a sport for a long time 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.090
 that leads people to touch 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.090
 literally the clouds 

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:19.590
 an activity that every day charges more 

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:19.590
 strength in our country 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:30.009
 the simplest simplest aircraft that 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:31.869
 has made the dream possible in reality 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:33.790
 of the man to fly paragliding is the 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:35.230
 name of this aircraft that owes its 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:37.390
 name the contraction of the phrase 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:39.010
 parachute dependent and that depends on 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.989
 the currents of the wind to rise 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.879
 and keep flying what compels the 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:44.980
 pilot to study the direction force and 

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:47.290
 behavior of this element before 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:49.720
 start the flight here the most important thing 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:52.090
 it's like it's a great aircraft 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:55.750
 not motorized the wind is ours 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:01:00.100
 our engine our main element 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:03.250
 and we learn micro micro meteorology 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.699
 meteorology to know the give us the 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.260
 clouds 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:07.630
 driving a paraglider is theoretically 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:09.400
 simple but you should practice and take 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:12.100
 the necessary experience for the 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:14.170
 development of this sport be sure of 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.670
 made the tandem jumps are highly 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.380
 requested by tourists who are 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:20.140
 accompanied by experienced pilots 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.939
 as Javier GonzÃ¡lez with more than 11 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.750
 years jumping ensures a quiet flight 

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:24.750
 and relaxed 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:31.630
 the most difficult thing is the takeoff and the 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.490
 landing goes once you're flying 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:36.909
 it is 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:39.369
 something wonderful you forget even of your 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:41.290
 name the flight with paragliding depends on 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:43.450
 two types of air streams first 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:45.490
 the thermal currents that are produced 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.409
 when the air heats up and forms a 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.240
 sort of invisible bubble for another 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:50.920
 side the dynamic currents that are 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.710
 air masses that form a kind of 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.570
 wave when they hit a mountain 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.310
 both are granted to the parapente force 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:58.990
 necessary to rise up to heaven 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.549
 this type of knowledge are 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.649
 shared and put into practice by 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:04.380
 the people who want to become 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:07.649
 pilots in a theoretical-practical course 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.310
 we are governed by a school 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:13.600
 american 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:15.400
 and every beginner bag pilot goes 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:18.430
 rising levels committed hours of 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.950
 flight and qualifies as pilot 1 pilot 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:23.019
 2 pilot 3 until you reach a p 4 and a 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.060
 pilot master some ropes that the pilot 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:27.280
 adjusts or loosens are responsible for 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.989
 directing the wing while traveling about 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.090
 50 kilometers per hour the speed 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:33.489
 maximum that these aircraft develop 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:36.069
 although competition wings can 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:37.540
 go up to 60 and because it's a 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:39.609
 sport that develops on high 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.060
 every pilot must have learned to 

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:42.880
 reaction 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:45.370
 in the face of any incident 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:47.370
 is to take a theoretical course even 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:50.620
 practical to develop the skills 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:53.710
 necessary to master the control of 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:56.140
 ground wing and wing control 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:58.060
 flying really is not any 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.740
 difficulty the practice of paragliding is 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.600
 a sport federated by the series to which 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:03.730
 is governed by the flight association 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.710
 free located in the capital zone 5 and 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.750
 in panajachel sololÃ¡ where pilots 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:09.700
 experienced are those in charge of 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.220
 instruct those who seek to touch the 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:15.070
 sky mainly this sport is 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:17.860
 develops in sololÃ¡ departments but 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:19.960
 we have also we have flight sites 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:22.240
 in the capital city in santa elena 

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:30.220
 barillas in la serra national park 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:31.720
 in palÃ­n the days have already represented 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:33.430
 proudly to our country in the 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.050
 abroad the last time in a 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:36.820
 Mexican championship in mid-January 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:39.340
 but the search for new talents 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:40.030
 continues one of the young promises in 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.490
 this sport 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:44.470
 smith pedro loarca who since the 13 

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:48.100
 years fly paragliding and there seems to be 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:51.210
 born to be on top of the best 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:51.210
 for me there is nothing like 

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:57.750
 sometimes it's scary but 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.760
 over time it is overcome thanks to 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.500
 paragliding more and more people live from 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.540
 close that experience that from a 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.900
 principle was limited to birds by 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.900
 fly
