think<00:01:46.530> it's<00:01:46.649> being<00:01:46.860> honest<00:01:47.220> about<00:01:47.340> what's<00:01:48.119> in

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
think it's being honest about what's in

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.380 
think it's being honest about what's in
the<00:01:48.509> product<00:01:48.930> it<00:01:49.729> advertises<00:01:50.729> the<00:01:50.820> fact<00:01:51.090> that

the product it advertises the fact that

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.460 
the product it advertises the fact that
it<00:01:51.570> is<00:01:51.750> a<00:01:51.990> plant<00:01:52.850> bottle<00:01:53.960> 30%<00:01:54.960> of<00:01:55.079> the<00:01:55.170> bottle

it is a plant bottle 30% of the bottle

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.249 
it is a plant bottle 30% of the bottle
is<00:01:55.619> plant-based<00:01:56.250> and<00:01:56.579> 100%<00:01:57.299> of<00:01:57.719> the<00:01:57.810> bottle<00:01:58.079> is

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.109 
is plant-based and 100% of the bottle is
recyclable<00:01:58.649> so<00:01:59.460> that's<00:01:59.640> good

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
recyclable so that's good

and what I just think is bizarre is the
fact<00:03:29.700> that<00:03:30.030> they're<00:03:30.900> not<00:03:31.110> more<00:03:31.409> upfront<00:03:31.769> about

this if it is something to be like

this if it is something to be like
Gatorade<00:03:35.069> and<00:03:35.280> the<00:03:35.370> fact<00:03:35.549> that<00:03:35.670> this<00:03:35.909> is<00:03:36.060> not

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
Gatorade and the fact that this is not

buy vitamin water or flavored water then

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.220 
buy vitamin water or flavored water then
you<00:04:15.280> expect<00:04:15.730> there<00:04:16.120> to<00:04:16.150> be<00:04:16.360> some<00:04:16.690> additives

you expect there to be some additives

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:20.190

but<00:04:17.440> when<00:04:18.400> I<00:04:18.430> see<00:04:18.850> remineralized<00:04:19.780> water

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:20.200 
but when I see remineralized water

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.590 
but when I see remineralized water
I<00:04:20.320> still<00:04:20.680> don't<00:04:20.860> expect<00:04:21.160> there<00:04:21.340> to<00:04:21.370> be<00:04:21.549> salt<00:04:22.330> I

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:22.600 
I still don't expect there to be salt I

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.900 
I still don't expect there to be salt I
think<00:04:22.630> this<00:04:23.080> is<00:04:23.230> very<00:04:23.440> sneaky<00:04:23.980> I<00:04:24.340> think<00:04:24.700> that

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:24.910 
think this is very sneaky I think that

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:27.480 
think this is very sneaky I think that
they're<00:04:25.090> going<00:04:25.390> after<00:04:25.690> a<00:04:26.260> specific<00:04:27.220> type<00:04:27.370> of

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 
they're going after a specific type of

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.400 
they're going after a specific type of
crowd<00:04:27.700> you<00:04:27.910> know<00:04:27.940> with<00:04:28.300> the<00:04:28.450> green<00:04:28.750> bottle<00:04:29.200> cap

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:29.410 
crowd you know with the green bottle cap

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:32.820 
crowd you know with the green bottle cap
and<00:04:29.740> the<00:04:29.860> plant<00:04:30.160> friendly<00:04:30.700> recyclable<00:04:31.830> bottle

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:32.830 
and the plant friendly recyclable bottle

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:34.170 
and the plant friendly recyclable bottle
I<00:04:33.070> think<00:04:33.340> that<00:04:33.490> they're<00:04:33.640> definitely<00:04:33.760> trying

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:34.180 
I think that they're definitely trying

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:35.430 
I think that they're definitely trying
to<00:04:34.240> go<00:04:34.360> after<00:04:34.480> people<00:04:34.750> who<00:04:35.020> are<00:04:35.170> health

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:35.440 
to go after people who are health

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.500 
to go after people who are health
conscious<00:04:35.710> and<00:04:36.070> who<00:04:36.160> are<00:04:36.280> eco<00:04:36.580> conscious<00:04:36.850> but

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:37.510 
conscious and who are eco conscious but

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:39.480 
conscious and who are eco conscious but
it's<00:04:37.660> is<00:04:37.780> where<00:04:37.930> it's<00:04:38.080> so<00:04:38.410> important<00:04:39.070> to<00:04:39.190> learn

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:39.490 
it's is where it's so important to learn

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:42.120 
it's is where it's so important to learn
how<00:04:39.850> to<00:04:39.880> read<00:04:40.210> labels<00:04:40.450> and<00:04:40.930> to<00:04:41.140> be<00:04:41.350> an<00:04:41.620> informed

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:42.130 
how to read labels and to be an informed

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:44.280 
how to read labels and to be an informed
consumer<00:04:42.490> and<00:04:42.850> to<00:04:43.300> make<00:04:43.540> informed<00:04:44.080> choices

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:44.290 
consumer and to make informed choices

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:47.100 
consumer and to make informed choices
and<00:04:44.980> know<00:04:45.550> that<00:04:45.820> just<00:04:46.060> because<00:04:46.180> it<00:04:46.510> looks<00:04:46.870> good

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.110 
and know that just because it looks good

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:47.700 
and know that just because it looks good
for<00:04:47.350> you

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:47.710 
for you

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:50.160 
for you
doesn't<00:04:48.340> mean<00:04:48.520> it<00:04:48.790> actually<00:04:49.270> is<00:04:49.450> so<00:04:49.990> I<00:04:50.020> think

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:50.170 
doesn't mean it actually is so I think

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:52.260 
doesn't mean it actually is so I think
overall<00:04:50.650> that<00:04:50.980> designing<00:04:51.370> is<00:04:51.610> really<00:04:51.940> taking

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:52.270 
overall that designing is really taking

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:53.880 
overall that designing is really taking
advantage<00:04:52.360> of<00:04:52.750> the<00:04:52.810> fact<00:04:53.080> that<00:04:53.260> people<00:04:53.530> don't

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:53.890 
advantage of the fact that people don't

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:56.490 
advantage of the fact that people don't
tend<00:04:54.250> to<00:04:54.340> read<00:04:54.640> their<00:04:55.210> food<00:04:55.570> labels<00:04:56.020> and<00:04:56.230> the

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:56.500 
tend to read their food labels and the

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:57.810 
tend to read their food labels and the
labels<00:04:56.530> of<00:04:57.010> the<00:04:57.070> product<00:04:57.490> that<00:04:57.580> they're

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:57.820 
labels of the product that they're

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:00.840 
labels of the product that they're
buying<00:04:58.030> and<00:04:58.470> it's<00:04:59.470> taking<00:04:59.980> advantage<00:05:00.370> also<00:05:00.610> of

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:00.850 
buying and it's taking advantage also of

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:03.630 
buying and it's taking advantage also of
people<00:05:01.180> trying<00:05:01.570> to<00:05:01.750> go<00:05:02.590> towards<00:05:03.070> more<00:05:03.310> green

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:03.640 
people trying to go towards more green

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:05.760 
people trying to go towards more green
and<00:05:03.910> healthy<00:05:04.330> products<00:05:04.750> and<00:05:05.020> I<00:05:05.140> just<00:05:05.530> think

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:05.770 
and healthy products and I just think

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:08.400 
and healthy products and I just think
that's<00:05:05.920> a<00:05:06.100> two<00:05:06.310> strikes<00:05:06.870> against<00:05:07.870> it<00:05:07.990> so<00:05:08.230> the

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:08.410 
that's a two strikes against it so the

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:11.159 
that's a two strikes against it so the
