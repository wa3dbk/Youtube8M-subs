00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:57.820 
hooking so we're gonna step swing lift

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.660 
hooking so we're gonna step swing lift
that<00:00:58.329> ends<00:00:58.870> I<00:00:58.960> think<00:00:58.989> was<00:00:59.289> gonna<00:00:59.440> hook<00:00:59.769> running

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:00.670 
that ends I think was gonna hook running

so again standing side the pole call

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:46.740 
so again standing side the pole call
