00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:13.469
 of the flip cob cover of the mobile phone 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:17.039
 samsung galaxy note 2 remembering that the

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.890

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:31.439
 recorded is seven days after the 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:36.149
 our delivery time is 13 business days 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:39.540
 remembering that this cover does not fit the 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:44.760
 cell phone is only for the 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:46.050
 samsung galaxy note two well 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.649
 We're going to work initially. 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.660
 only with black color 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:53.850
 if the next lots passed in other 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:58.469
 colors we'll let you know in that 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:03.690
 ad leave a notice is in the video 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:06.479
 also the front part it comes written 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:09.270
 galaxy note of 2 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.790
 we do not know for sure but it seems to be 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:15.060
 some kind of synthetic fabric 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:20.610
 the back is a plastic is black 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:23.040
 is also smooth with a good paint 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.680
 quality with metallic black 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:33.390
 I do not know if the camera will be able to pick up 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:37.020
 the detail inside it is velvety nor 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:40.890
 where it makes contact with the screen and here a 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:45.530
 important detail is that it does this 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:48.930
 she comes with antenna 1 antenna that is 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:50.189
 responsible for signal antenna signal 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.740
 of the operator 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:57.930
 then give preference to this type of 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:02:01.649
 flip because if you are not master of your 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:05.460
 cell phone will be weak or will not 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:06.329
 lose will ask until fully the signal 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.500
 dependent 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.500
 depending on location 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:18.180
 very hot so this is preferably 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:23.690
