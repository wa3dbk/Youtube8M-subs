you can't put outside websites besides

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.490 
you can't put outside websites besides
youtube<00:00:58.980> on<00:00:59.160> there<00:00:59.309> so<00:01:00.149> we<00:01:00.359> can't<00:01:00.510> do<00:01:00.629> that<00:01:00.750> so

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
youtube on there so we can't do that so

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.640 
youtube on there so we can't do that so
