00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:05.529
 hello friends today the second helicopter 

00:00:03.219 --> 00:00:07.120
 artillado of the big blows if 

00:00:05.529 --> 00:00:09.130
 they want to see the first one I'm going to leave them 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:11.740
 the link in the description of this video 

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:13.559
 but well let's concentrate on this 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:16.000
 vehicle that has a firepower 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.250
 impressive has two modules of 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.920
 weapons on each side that is four in 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:23.380
 total plus most surely have a 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:24.970
 machine gun on the front these 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.430
 modules can be used to 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:29.050
 machine guns or for missiles and we're going to 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:31.030
 see what real- life vehicle what 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:34.089
 they took many say that it is about 

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:36.579
 apache ah-64 however there is more 

00:00:34.089 --> 00:00:39.399
 differences that suggest that you do not know 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:41.350
 it's about apache that is rather about 

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:43.960
 of another vehicle because because it 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:46.210
 they seem very few to say that the 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:49.510
 tire layout the body of the 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:52.359
 helicopter does not resemble anything else 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:54.789
 well it looks like a thousand 25 thousand 25 if 

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:56.649
 It bears a striking resemblance let 

00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:59.079
 with the similarities the first resemblance that 

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:01.300
 have with the 25 is this system of 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:03.249
 suspension for the tires is a 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:05.710
 retractable system is retractable 

00:01:03.249 --> 00:01:07.720
 then when the helicopter takes off 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:11.020
 the tires are hidden and that lid 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:12.670
 in the upper part of the red circle 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.970
 closes and makes the helicopter 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:17.590
 it's totally aerodynamic and now 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.510
 let's see him in real life here 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.730
 we have the same suspension system and 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:23.920
 apart from the cover that is the cover 

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:26.410
 metal that surely closes 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.600
 when the tires are hidden and then 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:31.060
 well let's go with the second likeness 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.280
 the second resemblance is the system of 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:36.700
 escape this exhaust system that has 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.620
 has a way as global is is more 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.470
 well no no no this circle is more 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:43.270
 uncomfortable overall and protrudes from the body 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:45.790
 of the helicopter in real life too 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.830
 protrudes from the body of the helicopter without 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:50.260
 however it makes it less brusque here what 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:52.540
 we already have as it stands out and 7 al seems 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:55.030
 which is an oval shape why not say 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:58.150
 that no no no no seems circle seems the 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:00.790
 oval shape that part that let's say that that 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:02.140
 escape also looks too much and 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:05.259
 this similarity is also impressive 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:07.750
 the shape of these lateral wings when 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:09.820
 start in the fuselage part of the 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.620
 helicopter starting a very way 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:14.140
 wide and they are shrinking they go 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.430
 narrowing as he moves away 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.400
 has appeared is also very 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:20.260
 awesome now we're going to see it in the 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.170
 Real life does not reach to 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:25.300
 appreciate for the part let's say for the 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.830
 take the picture but that's not how it is 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.209
 we will also see it with other 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.010
 photographs that I'm going to put at the end 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:32.380
 of this video so you can see it 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.720
 better and well then let's go with the last 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:37.540
 like this helicopter the last 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.760
 resemblance basically refers to the 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:42.370
 way in which the wing ends up doing 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:45.040
 a 45 degree angle continues towards 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:47.860
 down and well then that let's say it's the 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.989
 seemed more forceful because they see what 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:53.050
 which is the 25 in real life also 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:56.050
 has that structure down at 45 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:58.239
 degrees is totally identical to this 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:01.750
 helicopter almost we can almost secure 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:03.880
 that were based on 25 and really this 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.170
 is the real life helicopter as 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.150
 good friends this was information from 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.530
 second helicopter gunship coming 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.570
 for the big blows they say 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:13.980
 You look like you or looks greetings 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:13.980
 for car more ram goodbye 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.540
 how good 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.450
 if not
