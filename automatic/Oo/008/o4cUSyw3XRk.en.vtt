00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
meteor shower last year it was a dud

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.720 
meteor shower last year it was a dud
because<00:00:48.600> bright<00:00:48.930> moonlight<00:00:49.590> wiped<00:00:50.309> out<00:00:50.520> all

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
because bright moonlight wiped out all

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.389

but<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.210> very<00:00:51.420> brightest<00:00:51.989> of<00:00:52.110> meteors<00:00:52.530> but

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
but the very brightest of meteors but

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:54.770 
but the very brightest of meteors but
this<00:00:53.699> year<00:00:54.059> tada

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
this year tada

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.069 
this year tada
there'll<00:00:55.110> be<00:00:55.199> no<00:00:56.039> moon<00:00:56.340> like<00:00:56.610> to<00:00:56.640> interfere<00:00:57.079> so

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
there'll be no moon like to interfere so

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.170 
there'll be no moon like to interfere so
