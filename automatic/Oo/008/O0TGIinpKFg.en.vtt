00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
surroundings but yeah just keep rolling

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:32.840 
surroundings but yeah just keep rolling
it<00:01:26.850> on<00:01:28.189> and<00:01:29.189> sure<00:01:30.119> enough<00:01:31.340> the<00:01:32.340> stuff<00:01:32.610> will<00:01:32.729> go

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
it on and sure enough the stuff will go

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.480 
it on and sure enough the stuff will go
down<00:01:33.090> and<00:01:33.420> when<00:01:33.689> it's<00:01:33.840> down<00:01:34.049> it<00:01:34.409> is<00:01:34.619> down<00:01:34.950> it<00:01:35.280> is

down and when it's down it is down it is

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.880 
down and when it's down it is down it is
very<00:01:35.700> tough<00:01:35.939> to<00:01:36.060> get<00:01:36.180> off<00:01:36.259> so<00:01:37.259> once<00:01:37.470> you<00:01:37.590> do<00:01:37.710> it

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
handle around to get in some of the

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.260 
handle around to get in some of the
crevices<00:01:42.420> on<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:42.630> luggage<00:01:42.899> area<00:01:44.119> now<00:01:45.119> this

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.880 
you're this is you know kind of a video
if<00:02:00.939> someone's<00:02:01.270> on<00:02:01.329> the<00:02:01.450> tight<00:02:01.630> budget<00:02:01.780> and<00:02:02.140> you

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
if someone's on the tight budget and you

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.469 
if someone's on the tight budget and you
know<00:02:03.509> this<00:02:04.509> works<00:02:04.810> wonders<00:02:06.359> especially<00:02:07.359> with

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479 
know this works wonders especially with

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:09.240 
know this works wonders especially with
the<00:02:07.600> earlier<00:02:07.869> cause<00:02:08.140> with<00:02:08.349> a<00:02:08.379> 36<00:02:08.860> horsepower

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
the earlier cause with a 36 horsepower

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:10.889 
the earlier cause with a 36 horsepower
engines<00:02:09.610> you<00:02:09.729> hardly<00:02:10.000> even<00:02:10.209> hear<00:02:10.450> the<00:02:10.569> engine

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
engines you hardly even hear the engine

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:16.680 
engines you hardly even hear the engine
after<00:02:11.650> it<00:02:11.769> you<00:02:12.250> know<00:02:12.370> when<00:02:12.549> you're<00:02:12.670> driving<00:02:15.690> so

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
after it you know when you're driving so

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.150 
after it you know when you're driving so
again<00:02:16.930> you<00:02:17.140> can<00:02:17.290> start<00:02:17.500> putting<00:02:17.650> it<00:02:17.830> down<00:02:17.950> I

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
again you can start putting it down I

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.890 
again you can start putting it down I
line<00:02:18.400> it<00:02:18.430> up<00:02:18.640> I<00:02:18.879> go<00:02:19.150> basically<00:02:19.480> from<00:02:19.750> either

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
line it up I go basically from either

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:25.020 
line it up I go basically from either
side<00:02:20.170> I<00:02:20.200> alternate<00:02:20.709> sides<00:02:23.459> until<00:02:24.459> I<00:02:24.519> finally

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
side I alternate sides until I finally

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.190 
side I alternate sides until I finally
meet<00:02:25.360> up<00:02:25.390> in<00:02:25.660> the<00:02:25.690> middle<00:02:27.090> roll<00:02:28.090> it<00:02:28.239> on<00:02:28.360> get<00:02:29.170> it

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
meet up in the middle roll it on get it

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.309 
meet up in the middle roll it on get it
on<00:02:29.349> good<00:02:29.590> and<00:02:29.620> tight<00:02:31.079> get<00:02:32.079> in<00:02:32.170> all<00:02:32.290> the

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:32.319 
on good and tight get in all the

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:36.539 
on good and tight get in all the
crevices<00:02:32.650> and<00:02:34.829> these<00:02:35.829> first<00:02:36.010> start<00:02:36.310> off<00:02:36.370> like

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:36.549 
crevices and these first start off like

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:38.520 
crevices and these first start off like
I<00:02:36.579> said<00:02:36.760> by<00:02:36.879> hand<00:02:37.180> and<00:02:37.450> then<00:02:37.569> once<00:02:38.110> you<00:02:38.200> line<00:02:38.379> it

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
I said by hand and then once you line it

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.110 
I said by hand and then once you line it
up<00:02:38.650> then<00:02:39.160> you<00:02:39.190> can<00:02:39.310> start<00:02:39.519> using<00:02:39.670> the<00:02:39.910> roller

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
up then you can start using the roller

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.660 
up then you can start using the roller
to<00:02:40.299> get<00:02:40.810> it<00:02:40.900> down<00:02:41.160> and<00:02:42.160> then<00:02:42.280> once<00:02:42.459> you<00:02:42.519> can<00:02:42.610> see

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
to get it down and then once you can see

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.050 
to get it down and then once you can see
I<00:02:42.819> meet<00:02:43.299> up<00:02:43.329> in<00:02:43.510> the<00:02:43.599> middle<00:02:44.670> the<00:02:45.670> alternate

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
I meet up in the middle the alternate

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.970 
I meet up in the middle the alternate
either<00:02:46.329> side<00:02:46.540> you<00:02:46.569> know<00:02:46.870> just<00:02:47.680> a<00:02:47.769> little

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
either side you know just a little

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.460 
either side you know just a little
easier<00:02:48.129> to<00:02:48.549> get<00:02:48.670> down<00:02:48.879> instead<00:02:49.269> of<00:02:49.359> doing<00:02:50.290> one

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
easier to get down instead of doing one

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:51.839 
easier to get down instead of doing one
side<00:02:50.709> and<00:02:50.859> going<00:02:51.010> all<00:02:51.129> the<00:02:51.190> way<00:02:51.250> across<00:02:51.609> then

00:02:51.839 --> 00:02:51.849 
side and going all the way across then

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:54.509 
side and going all the way across then
you<00:02:51.910> get<00:02:52.030> out<00:02:52.060> to<00:02:52.239> cut<00:02:52.420> it<00:02:52.569> so<00:02:53.190> but<00:02:54.190> that's<00:02:54.310> how

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:54.519 
you get out to cut it so but that's how

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:56.940 
you get out to cut it so but that's how
that<00:02:54.579> looks<00:02:54.760> and<00:02:55.420> this<00:02:55.989> stuff<00:02:56.230> works<00:02:56.470> wonders

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
that looks and this stuff works wonders

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.039 
that looks and this stuff works wonders
it's<00:02:57.099> called<00:02:57.310> quick<00:02:57.549> roof<00:02:57.760> I<00:02:58.030> also<00:02:58.810> have<00:02:58.989> a
