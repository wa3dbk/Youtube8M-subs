everywhere in your body that's essential
for<00:00:57.250> life<00:00:57.550> all<00:00:58.180> the<00:00:58.780> myelin<00:00:59.469> sheaths<00:00:59.950> are<00:01:00.190> the

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:00.309 
for life all the myelin sheaths are the

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:03.090 
for life all the myelin sheaths are the
Schwann<00:01:00.700> cells<00:01:01.180> that<00:01:01.600> surround<00:01:02.199> your<00:01:02.559> nervous

Schwann cells that surround your nervous
system<00:01:03.280> those<00:01:04.119> are<00:01:04.269> all<00:01:04.390> made<00:01:04.570> out<00:01:04.719> of<00:01:04.750> fat

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:05.019 
system those are all made out of fat

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:07.440 
system those are all made out of fat
most<00:01:05.710> of<00:01:05.890> your<00:01:06.039> brain<00:01:06.250> is<00:01:06.490> fat<00:01:06.700> it's<00:01:07.000> a<00:01:07.119> great

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:07.450 
most of your brain is fat it's a great

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:09.719 
most of your brain is fat it's a great
insulator<00:01:08.109> not<00:01:08.679> a<00:01:08.709> great<00:01:08.950> conductor<00:01:09.249> but<00:01:09.700> a

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:09.729 
insulator not a great conductor but a

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:11.550 
insulator not a great conductor but a
great<00:01:10.029> insulator<00:01:10.539> and<00:01:10.810> so<00:01:10.899> we<00:01:10.990> use<00:01:11.170> that<00:01:11.200> to

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.560 
great insulator and so we use that to

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.559 
great insulator and so we use that to
insulate<00:01:12.069> our<00:01:12.219> nervous<00:01:12.459> system<00:01:12.909> and<00:01:13.060> help

00:01:13.559 --> 00:01:13.569 
insulate our nervous system and help

00:01:13.569 --> 00:01:15.840 
insulate our nervous system and help
conduct<00:01:13.990> the<00:01:14.469> nervous<00:01:14.859> system<00:01:15.159> impulses<00:01:15.819> a

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850 
conduct the nervous system impulses a

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.419 
conduct the nervous system impulses a
little<00:01:16.119> bit<00:01:16.270> quicker<00:01:16.509> so<00:01:16.810> fat<00:01:17.709> not<00:01:18.039> always<00:01:18.399> a

00:01:18.419 --> 00:01:18.429 
little bit quicker so fat not always a

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:20.999 
little bit quicker so fat not always a
bad<00:01:18.639> thing<00:01:18.670> but<00:01:19.630> to<00:01:20.079> an<00:01:20.170> excessive<00:01:20.590> degree<00:01:20.619> it

00:01:20.999 --> 00:01:21.009 
bad thing but to an excessive degree it

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:25.260 
bad thing but to an excessive degree it
can<00:01:21.039> be<00:01:21.369> fats<00:01:22.329> density<00:01:23.200> is<00:01:23.429> 0.9<00:01:24.429> kilograms<00:01:25.149> per

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:25.270 
can be fats density is 0.9 kilograms per

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:27.029 
can be fats density is 0.9 kilograms per
liter<00:01:25.689> so<00:01:26.170> when<00:01:26.259> we<00:01:26.319> look<00:01:26.439> at<00:01:26.499> all<00:01:26.709> the<00:01:26.859> fat

00:01:27.029 --> 00:01:27.039 
liter so when we look at all the fat

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:29.039 
liter so when we look at all the fat
tissue<00:01:27.249> together<00:01:27.759> the<00:01:28.270> density<00:01:28.810> of<00:01:28.929> that

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:29.049 
tissue together the density of that

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:31.550 
tissue together the density of that
tissue<00:01:29.319> is<00:01:29.469> point<00:01:30.039> 9<00:01:30.279> kilograms<00:01:30.729> per<00:01:31.029> liter

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
tissue is point 9 kilograms per liter

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.469 
tissue is point 9 kilograms per liter
now<00:01:32.560> if<00:01:32.859> we<00:01:32.979> look<00:01:33.159> at<00:01:33.249> the<00:01:33.369> density<00:01:33.579> of<00:01:34.060> our

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:34.479 
now if we look at the density of our

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:38.370 
now if we look at the density of our
friend<00:01:34.869> the<00:01:34.959> skeleton<00:01:35.439> plus<00:01:36.569> muscle<00:01:37.569> plus<00:01:38.109> all

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:38.380 
friend the skeleton plus muscle plus all

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.949 
friend the skeleton plus muscle plus all
the<00:01:38.619> organs<00:01:38.979> in<00:01:39.130> the<00:01:39.219> body<00:01:39.249> all<00:01:39.669> the<00:01:40.149> fat<00:01:40.599> free

00:01:40.949 --> 00:01:40.959 
the organs in the body all the fat free

00:01:40.959 --> 00:01:42.929 
the organs in the body all the fat free
tissue<00:01:41.229> if<00:01:41.590> we<00:01:41.770> group<00:01:41.950> that<00:01:42.189> all<00:01:42.310> together<00:01:42.459> it

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:42.939 
tissue if we group that all together it

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:45.449 
tissue if we group that all together it
has<00:01:43.389> a<00:01:43.419> density<00:01:43.869> of<00:01:44.169> about<00:01:44.349> one<00:01:44.829> point<00:01:45.130> one

00:01:45.449 --> 00:01:45.459 
has a density of about one point one

00:01:45.459 --> 00:01:48.719 
has a density of about one point one
kilogram<00:01:45.939> per<00:01:46.270> liter<00:01:46.479> so<00:01:47.020> muscle<00:01:47.469> five<00:01:48.189> pounds

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:48.729 
kilogram per liter so muscle five pounds

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:51.479 
kilogram per liter so muscle five pounds
of<00:01:48.789> muscle<00:01:49.239> is<00:01:49.739> more<00:01:50.739> dense<00:01:51.039> and<00:01:51.369> therefore

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:51.489 
of muscle is more dense and therefore

00:01:51.489 --> 00:01:53.849 
of muscle is more dense and therefore
takes<00:01:51.969> up<00:01:52.119> less<00:01:52.299> room<00:01:52.450> than<00:01:53.079> five<00:01:53.380> pounds<00:01:53.619> of

00:01:53.849 --> 00:01:53.859 
takes up less room than five pounds of

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:56.609 
takes up less room than five pounds of
fat<00:01:54.069> you<00:01:54.459> can<00:01:54.609> see<00:01:54.819> how<00:01:55.060> the<00:01:55.869> fat<00:01:56.079> model<00:01:56.499> is

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:56.619 
fat you can see how the fat model is

00:01:56.619 --> 00:01:58.139 
fat you can see how the fat model is
much<00:01:56.770> bigger<00:01:57.039> than<00:01:57.340> the<00:01:57.459> five<00:01:57.669> pounds<00:01:58.060> of

00:01:58.139 --> 00:01:58.149 
much bigger than the five pounds of

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:00.569 
much bigger than the five pounds of
muscle<00:01:58.450> model<00:01:58.810> each<00:01:59.169> one<00:01:59.469> has<00:01:59.739> the<00:01:59.950> same<00:02:00.159> mass

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:00.579 
muscle model each one has the same mass

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:03.929 
muscle model each one has the same mass
but<00:02:01.090> because<00:02:01.899> fat<00:02:02.590> is<00:02:02.619> less<00:02:03.189> dense<00:02:03.489> as<00:02:03.909> a

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:03.939 
but because fat is less dense as a

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:08.219 
but because fat is less dense as a
larger<00:02:04.539> volume<00:02:05.999> so<00:02:06.999> getting<00:02:07.569> back<00:02:07.749> to<00:02:07.899> the<00:02:07.989> fat

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
larger volume so getting back to the fat

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.309 
larger volume so getting back to the fat
that<00:02:08.640> the<00:02:09.640> fact<00:02:09.940> not<00:02:10.450> the<00:02:10.569> fat<00:02:10.780> but<00:02:10.989> the<00:02:11.080> fact

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:11.319 
that the fact not the fat but the fact

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:14.069 
that the fact not the fat but the fact
that<00:02:11.590> muscle<00:02:12.549> is<00:02:12.760> more<00:02:13.060> dense<00:02:13.360> than<00:02:13.569> fat<00:02:13.870> and

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:14.079 
that muscle is more dense than fat and

00:02:14.079 --> 00:02:15.750 
that muscle is more dense than fat and
has<00:02:14.319> a<00:02:14.349> density<00:02:15.040> of<00:02:15.159> 1

it's less dense than water because water

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.309 
it's less dense than water because water

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:24.880 
you start an exercise program where

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:26.820 
you start an exercise program where
you're<00:04:25.150> exercising<00:04:25.630> and<00:04:26.200> especially<00:04:26.530> doing

you're exercising and especially doing
resistance<00:04:27.460> training<00:04:27.639> you<00:04:28.210> might<00:04:28.389> gain<00:04:28.659> five

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:29.180 
resistance training you might gain five

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.689 
resistance training you might gain five
pounds<00:04:29.449> of<00:04:29.539> this<00:04:29.720> in<00:04:29.960> the<00:04:30.860> same<00:04:31.039> time<00:04:31.340> if<00:04:31.610> you

00:04:31.689 --> 00:04:31.699 
pounds of this in the same time if you

00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:33.490 
pounds of this in the same time if you
reduce<00:04:32.000> your<00:04:32.120> calories<00:04:32.180> and<00:04:32.900> do<00:04:33.229> a<00:04:33.259> lot<00:04:33.470> of

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:33.500 
reduce your calories and do a lot of

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:35.469 
reduce your calories and do a lot of
aerobic<00:04:33.979> activity<00:04:34.460> you<00:04:34.759> might<00:04:34.880> lose<00:04:35.150> five

00:04:35.469 --> 00:04:35.479 
aerobic activity you might lose five

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:37.810 
aerobic activity you might lose five
pounds<00:04:35.660> of<00:04:35.840> this<00:04:35.990> so<00:04:36.800> you<00:04:36.889> lose<00:04:37.160> five<00:04:37.460> pounds

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:37.820 
pounds of this so you lose five pounds

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:39.850 
pounds of this so you lose five pounds
of<00:04:37.910> this<00:04:38.030> and<00:04:38.240> gain<00:04:38.870> five<00:04:39.229> pounds<00:04:39.620> of<00:04:39.680> this

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:39.860 
of this and gain five pounds of this

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:42.100 
of this and gain five pounds of this
meaning<00:04:40.699> the<00:04:40.970> scale<00:04:41.240> wouldn't<00:04:41.660> say<00:04:41.780> anything

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:42.110 
meaning the scale wouldn't say anything

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:43.840 
meaning the scale wouldn't say anything
different<00:04:42.470> but<00:04:42.979> if<00:04:43.100> we<00:04:43.190> tested<00:04:43.550> your<00:04:43.639> body

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:43.850 
different but if we tested your body

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:45.730 
different but if we tested your body
composition<00:04:44.270> we<00:04:44.870> can<00:04:44.900> easily<00:04:45.229> tell<00:04:45.710> the

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:45.740 
composition we can easily tell the

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:47.730 
composition we can easily tell the
change<00:04:46.310> in<00:04:46.639> the<00:04:46.789> overall<00:04:46.940> body<00:04:47.330> composition

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:47.740 
change in the overall body composition

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:51.219 
change in the overall body composition
plus<00:04:48.740> this<00:04:49.430> burns<00:04:49.850> calories<00:04:50.240> all<00:04:50.780> the<00:04:50.960> time

00:04:51.219 --> 00:04:51.229 
plus this burns calories all the time

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:54.520 
plus this burns calories all the time
this<00:04:52.039> just<00:04:52.759> lays<00:04:53.030> around<00:04:53.080> so<00:04:54.080> if<00:04:54.199> you<00:04:54.350> have

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:54.530 
this just lays around so if you have

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:56.379 
this just lays around so if you have
more<00:04:54.800> of<00:04:54.949> this<00:04:55.250> you're<00:04:55.820> going<00:04:55.910> to<00:04:55.970> burn<00:04:56.180> more

00:04:56.379 --> 00:04:56.389 
more of this you're going to burn more

00:04:56.389 --> 00:04:58.510 
more of this you're going to burn more
calories<00:04:56.660> all<00:04:57.080> the<00:04:57.199> time<00:04:57.410> where<00:04:57.979> your<00:04:58.160> resting

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:58.520 
calories all the time where your resting

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.600 
calories all the time where your resting
metabolic<00:04:58.699> rate<00:04:59.120> is<00:04:59.539> going<00:04:59.690> to<00:04:59.750> be<00:04:59.870> higher

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:00.610 
metabolic rate is going to be higher

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:02.529 
metabolic rate is going to be higher
next<00:05:01.610> time<00:05:01.759> we're<00:05:02.000> going<00:05:02.090> to<00:05:02.180> look<00:05:02.330> at<00:05:02.449> the

00:05:02.529 --> 00:05:02.539 
next time we're going to look at the

00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:04.810 
next time we're going to look at the
actual<00:05:02.870> technique<00:05:03.500> of<00:05:03.710> underwater<00:05:04.400> Wayne

where we put you the subject the student
in<00:05:08.509> the<00:05:08.810> tank<00:05:09.080> have<00:05:09.740> you<00:05:09.919> blow<00:05:10.190> out<00:05:10.340> all<00:05:10.580> your

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:10.970 
in the tank have you blow out all your

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:13.749 
in the tank have you blow out all your
air<00:05:11.270> as<00:05:11.660> you<00:05:12.139> go<00:05:12.289> underwater<00:05:12.650> and<00:05:13.130> we're<00:05:13.610> going

00:05:13.749 --> 00:05:13.759 
air as you go underwater and we're going

00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:15.939 
air as you go underwater and we're going
to<00:05:13.820> see<00:05:13.970> how<00:05:14.360> much<00:05:14.599> water<00:05:14.900> you<00:05:15.199> displace<00:05:15.650> by

00:05:15.939 --> 00:05:15.949 
to see how much water you displace by

00:05:15.949 --> 00:05:19.300 
to see how much water you displace by
