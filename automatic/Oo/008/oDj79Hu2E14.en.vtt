00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:15.710
 and here you see a selection and a 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:18.410
 preliminary organization of times and 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:21.169
 mancheta styles where is 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:23.689
 selected by organizing them according to 

00:00:21.169 --> 00:00:25.009
 kind of use that way 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:27.380
 these two machetes that they see in a 

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:30.349
 start are those that I consider them 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:33.290
 like machetes of exhibition or machetes 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:35.300
 of extra light use because in reality 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:38.210
 and in most cases they are 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:41.089
 made of a stainless steel and tend 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:43.579
 to be quite fragile the second group 

00:00:41.089 --> 00:00:46.870
 goes from this Latin machete in the 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:50.390
 reference is the potbellied up 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:53.449
 approximately this is panga de acÃ¡ 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.280
 and are the ones in general use are those that 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:57.320
 adjust much more to the definition of what 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.449
 that is a machete the second group goes 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:02.839
 from cuqui to extreme to action 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:05.720
 until the 8th s &amp; p of Ontario and are those of 

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:07.340
 I work semi-heavy and I think that 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.460
 has the qualities of the machetes of 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:12.470
 heavy use but that by its shape and its 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.990
 weight 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:17.540
 for general use like those that are here 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:20.960
 and finally I only have these three 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:25.030
 demonstrating the group and they are the ones with their 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:27.560
 heavy is to say that they are mainly 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.750
 processors 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.570
 even though everything definitely does not 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.579
 I have all the designs available in 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:38.090
 the image I can make a differentiation 

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:40.579
 of the guidelines and the 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.680
 purposes of the macheteros the two 

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:44.750
 first are as I had said before 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:48.080
 they are Latin machetes 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:51.439
 this is the traditional bolus design 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:55.070
 I know there are some manufacturers 

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:57.200
 like me king who markets this design 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:59.720
 like a bolus but it's not really a 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:02.420
 the golo design is this one that is 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:06.350
 camps are the traditional machetes 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:09.739
 Latinos who are thin of one more time 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:12.860
 from a very low rockwell around 53 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:15.519
 is is the general idea of powerful 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:18.560
 which are used to deal with 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:21.260
 very light vegetation the next 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.420
 design is this that is the sugar cane machete 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:27.110
 is of medium length or in this case 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:29.330
 has two hands is a variation that is 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.960
 finds you according to many manufacturers 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:36.110
 for any of these sheets 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:38.060
 mounted on a rather thick sheet 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:41.420
 but thin as I had mentioned 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:44.810
 before and is a machete mainly 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:47.180
 light vegetation shredder as it is 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.280
 the sugar cane the following design and 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:52.459
 I eat it 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:55.640
 they differentiate it because its edge is 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:59.030
 found in the inner part is to say 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:02.270
 it has a concave silo it is also thin 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:04.790
 and the reason for this is that in the 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:07.910
 moment of fanning brings it to the 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:10.790
 inside the branches facilitating the choir 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:13.910
 This machete is the machete panga 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:17.870
 traditional African and the reason for being 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:20.569
 of having a larger volume at the tip 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:23.030
 is necessarily for it to be generated 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:26.030
 this curvature and have a cutter but 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:29.930
 just to give it more weight in the 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:32.840
 point and move the center of gravity more 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:35.950
 into the sheet and give it more 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:39.590
 tracing ability to a machete that 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:42.350
 normally the machete is a cutter 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:44.989
 next you see here is a stop or a 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:47.660
 variation of a pitifully no 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:49.910
 I have one available at hand and it has 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:52.519
 several characteristics the main one is 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:55.140
 that has a large mass towards the tip 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:57.660
 therefore it is a chipper and 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:59.430
 a convex century not a sharpener 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:03.600
 necessarily convinced but yes a sharp 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:06.660
 convex and the handle on a different shaft to 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:08.550
 the sheet what allows to use it for 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:12.120
 do detail work and your machete 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:13.920
 Asian and is the most useful machetes 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.450
 for the kraft bus the following is a 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.609
 machete ontario with guards that is 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:20.370
 basically the same Latin machete but 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:22.620
 this guard has been added which 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:24.210
 is a characteristic that was born in the 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.740
 Army machetes in the second 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:28.050
 world war simply for 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:30.210
 guarantee a with a safe use in a 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:32.940
 group of people when one is 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:35.310
 banking the machete the following is a 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:38.520
 it's a machete that's this cork and the 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:41.220
 same design is repeated in this which is the 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:44.700
 turkey I say has the quality that it has 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:48.180
 the largest mass put and not at the tip 

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:50.760
 but in the middle of the sheet and a twist 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:53.010
 concave with that you get the one that 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:54.900
 have a shredder if it is 

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:57.090
 necessary simply is not 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:59.820
 mainly its function the being 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:01.230
 chipper and having a tip with so 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:03.600
 little mass 

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:05.880
 and the center of gravity so close to 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:08.190
 handle both the same thing happens what 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:10.590
 is achieved is a very easy machete of 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:12.300
 brandish therefore he is machete was 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:14.190
 used in the Second World War 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:16.290
 as a tool and at the same time 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:17.850
 as a weapon in the trenches as 

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:19.980
 you can realize he sma chile 

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:21.630
 it even has its own contra-sharpness 

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:24.540
 for that work the machete that follows 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:27.660
 xunta panga that is a machete of edge 

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:30.780
 long-range straight generally and 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:33.120
 with a tip at 90 degrees very similar to 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:35.580
 s &amp; p 8 in some cases has a large 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:38.400
 dough at the tip simply to carry 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:40.110
 again the weight more towards the sheet and 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:42.270
 turn it into a shredder but this they see 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:44.760
 you on screen in particular is my 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:47.220
 personal machete and is equivalent to a 

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:48.930
 Latin machete in the following is the 

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:51.480
 meets brand new hp is a variation 

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:53.750
 modern of this which is the sucre 

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:56.730
 traditional that I think is a tool 

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:58.950
 purely agricultural that over time to 

00:05:56.730 --> 00:06:00.840
 be used by farmers and as has 

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:03.900
 happened with most of the machetes 

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:06.270
 has earned a fierce reputation as 

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:08.280
 war tool the last two 

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:10.110
 they are machetes puller 

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:11.280
 again the design of the panga in a 

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:13.290
 forged machete 

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:15.690
 this is a machete for coconuts that could 

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:18.030
 be perfectly a Thai thong 

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:20.250
 it simply has the tip rounded 

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:23.850
 to be able to fan the most 

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:28.139
 security and has a large mass in the 

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:31.940
 tip to be able to deliver blows to 

00:06:28.139 --> 00:06:31.940
 same time strong and accurate
