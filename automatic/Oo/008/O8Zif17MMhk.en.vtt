00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.710
 and is by my side graciela franco is 

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:09.490
 because it is the space of how it is used 

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:11.800
 it's like that 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:13.750
 this is how the breqa is used 

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:15.730
 alright well so working 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:18.640
 good very good as always non-stop 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:20.740
 without stopping very well palante very well what 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:23.880
 are you going to do we are going to do cracking 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:26.320
 crackle on glass 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.840
 we usually work on wood 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:31.150
 on paper today we are going to do the 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.379
 cracked on glass because it is one of 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:34.479
 the things that in some of the 

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:36.640
 exhibitions people told me but as 

00:00:34.479 --> 00:00:39.969
 about the video and has people milling and not 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:42.519
 you need nothing look at the process is 

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:44.319
 exactly the same as what we do in 

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:46.090
 other surfaces we will pass the 

00:00:44.319 --> 00:00:49.240
 base varnish 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:51.670
 we will let it dry to take 

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:55.570
 points, actually we did everything with 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:57.550
 this that takes the biting point I 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:00.420
 said it dry and if no point 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:04.030
 mordant that equal equal 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:07.330
 then we give a base to have in 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:10.210
 mind that when we give a finite base 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:12.610
 in craquelure has little depth 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:14.290
 clear when we give a very hard base 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:17.170
 with a lot of quantity the crackle of 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:20.350
 access to our deep forming and what 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:22.210
 that will give the size of the break is the 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:25.330
 amount of freezing crack that would be the 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:27.790
 second component here we gave the first 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:32.979
 hand the base varnish on this side I already 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:36.190
 I have it dry and then let's move on 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:38.680
 the craquelure the craquelure that is the 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:40.390
 second component and in this you have to 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.159
 keep in mind that you do not have to brush 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:45.460
 how much 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:48.509
 we said that the size of the craquelure what 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:51.670
 will give the quantity of products 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:53.409
 then look I use the brush 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.500
 only to accommodate the product 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:57.970
 nothing more 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.430
 and we will apply it 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:02.740
 after this we apply it if you want 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:04.680
 you will accelerate it with a little bit of 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.260
 dryer 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.539
 or with a heat gun but in this 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:11.310
 In case you do not have to let it dry or if you 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.990
 can exercise carles or let it dry 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.080
 this alone 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:18.510
 the theme is here so that it looks like 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:22.530
 krake the others in the heat gun and 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:26.270
 to give this a little bit of warmth and 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.270
 who sits 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:32.070
 and very determined 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:39.880
 because I want to show this 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:43.090
 here is the dry work then a 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:45.820
 way to highlight what you can leave like this or 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.410
 you can highlight with patinas clear because 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:49.300
 in reality that is transparent the 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:52.180
 finished is not true but you with the 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:54.640
 highlight patina the one that breaks 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:59.090
 exact 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:01.340
 and obviously the colors of the pages 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.980
 you have 36 colors of patinas to choose from 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:06.610
 eave that you have variety and for 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:09.349
 Of course everything will be according to the motive 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:11.470
 with which he is working is very 

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:15.100
 fine is very cute 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:17.680
 at work finished white that's 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:20.980
 worked with a paint base that is 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:23.380
 a base the acrylic base of this crack 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:27.130
 that reads with craquelado chiquito and 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:30.280
 Then pass bitumen from Judea to another 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:32.380
 type of finishing other styles and good 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.210
 very good grace that good this is the one of 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:38.040
 cracked eureka to put it on 

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:38.040
 surface in this case that says what 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:43.930
 good anything you want from what 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:46.660
 who has suffered what he wants what 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:50.020
 it means that to work down in 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:51.610
 House of the moment products and 7-6 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:53.230
 then next time we are not seeing how 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:54.700
 us so out of life to be 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:58.860
 thank you to the verb 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.860
 we continue with more arts
