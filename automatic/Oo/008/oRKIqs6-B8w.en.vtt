the<00:01:33.400> seat<00:01:34.120> backing<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:35.650> center<00:01:36.010> part<00:01:36.340> of<00:01:36.490> mine

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 
the seat backing the center part of mine

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.320 
the seat backing the center part of mine
is<00:01:36.970> really<00:01:37.000> thrashed<00:01:38.280> but<00:01:39.280> the<00:01:39.460> the<00:01:39.909> outsides

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:40.330 
is really thrashed but the the outsides

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:41.700 
is really thrashed but the the outsides
are<00:01:40.540> good<00:01:40.720> and<00:01:40.870> they<00:01:40.930> just<00:01:41.080> screw<00:01:41.350> together

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 
are good and they just screw together

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:43.350 
are good and they just screw together
but<00:01:42.190> this<00:01:42.370> one<00:01:42.610> that<00:01:42.700> looks<00:01:42.850> like<00:01:42.940> the<00:01:43.119> center

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 
but this one that looks like the center

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.240 
but this one that looks like the center
side<00:01:43.720> center<00:01:43.750> piece<00:01:44.530> is<00:01:44.560> good<00:01:44.920> and<00:01:45.159> the

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250 
side center piece is good and the

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:46.649 
side center piece is good and the
outsides<00:01:45.640> are<00:01:45.790> kind<00:01:46.000> of<00:01:46.119> bad<00:01:46.270> so<00:01:46.510> I<00:01:46.540> think

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:46.659 
outsides are kind of bad so I think

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:48.480 
outsides are kind of bad so I think
between<00:01:46.990> the<00:01:47.290> two<00:01:47.470> units<00:01:47.770> I<00:01:47.890> can<00:01:48.070> make<00:01:48.220> a<00:01:48.250> good

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.490 
between the two units I can make a good

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:53.130 
between the two units I can make a good
unit<00:01:49.080> my<00:01:50.080> heater<00:01:50.770> pull<00:01:51.280> is<00:01:51.720> bent<00:01:52.720> up<00:01:52.869> and<00:01:52.930> bad

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
unit my heater pull is bent up and bad

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.609 
unit my heater pull is bent up and bad
this<00:01:53.440> one<00:01:53.619> is<00:01:53.740> good<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:55.360> air<00:01:55.510> conditioning<00:01:56.229> or

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:56.619 
this one is good the air conditioning or

00:01:56.619 --> 00:01:58.020 
this one is good the air conditioning or
whatnot<00:01:56.920> air<00:01:57.250> conditioning<00:01:57.640> but<00:01:57.729> heater

stuff and it really looks nasty and

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.360 
stuff and it really looks nasty and
probably<00:03:05.990> be<00:03:06.140> a<00:03:06.170> lot<00:03:06.380> easier<00:03:06.440> to<00:03:06.830> just<00:03:06.860> take

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
probably be a lot easier to just take

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.070 
probably be a lot easier to just take
these<00:03:07.580> off<00:03:07.760> put<00:03:08.060> them<00:03:08.150> on<00:03:08.240> the<00:03:08.360> new<00:03:08.510> car<00:03:08.810> and

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:42.510 
car down and try to get everything that

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:46.600 
car down and try to get everything that
I<00:04:42.630> can<00:04:42.720> possibly<00:04:42.870> get<00:04:43.530> off<00:04:43.740> of<00:04:43.770> it<00:04:44.160> and

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:46.610 
I can possibly get off of it and

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:48.680 
I can possibly get off of it and
possibly<00:04:47.610> use<00:04:47.790> it<00:04:47.940> but<00:04:48.000> I<00:04:48.060> don't<00:04:48.330> think<00:04:48.570> that

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:48.690 
possibly use it but I don't think that

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:50.740 
possibly use it but I don't think that
I'll<00:04:48.780> be<00:04:48.900> using<00:04:48.930> a<00:04:49.260> great<00:04:49.470> deal<00:04:49.650> of<00:04:49.680> body<00:04:49.980> parts

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:05.330 
out if I can perhaps if you need a
fender<00:05:04.290> or<00:05:04.410> something<00:05:04.710> like<00:05:04.800> that<00:05:04.890> we<00:05:05.190> might

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:05.340 
fender or something like that we might

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:06.830 
fender or something like that we might
be<00:05:05.490> able<00:05:05.550> to<00:05:05.670> take<00:05:05.820> a<00:05:05.880> fender<00:05:06.240> off<00:05:06.390> and<00:05:06.630> get<00:05:06.750> it

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:06.840 
be able to take a fender off and get it

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.240 
be able to take a fender off and get it
to<00:05:06.960> you<00:05:07.050> and<00:05:07.200> you<00:05:07.410> know<00:05:07.500> sell<00:05:07.740> it<00:05:07.860> to<00:05:07.980> you<00:05:08.100> and

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:08.250 
to you and you know sell it to you and

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:09.800 
to you and you know sell it to you and
then<00:05:08.340> I<00:05:08.610> could<00:05:09.030> probably<00:05:09.240> use<00:05:09.390> that<00:05:09.630> money

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:09.810 
then I could probably use that money

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:13.640 
then I could probably use that money
towards<00:05:10.050> my<00:05:10.290> project<00:05:10.770> too<00:05:10.980> uh<00:05:12.080> I<00:05:13.080> think<00:05:13.470> that's

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:13.650 
towards my project too uh I think that's

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:15.890 
towards my project too uh I think that's
about<00:05:13.890> all<00:05:13.950> I<00:05:14.070> got<00:05:14.160> today<00:05:14.780> obviously<00:05:15.780> I<00:05:15.810> don't

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:15.900 
about all I got today obviously I don't

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:18.320 
about all I got today obviously I don't
think<00:05:16.140> that<00:05:16.230> mirrors<00:05:16.560> original<00:05:17.150> but<00:05:18.150> I<00:05:18.180> think

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:18.330 
think that mirrors original but I think

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:20.180 
think that mirrors original but I think
that's<00:05:18.450> about<00:05:18.570> all<00:05:18.810> I've<00:05:18.990> got<00:05:19.200> for<00:05:19.230> today<00:05:19.500> do

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:20.190 
that's about all I've got for today do

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:23.030 
that's about all I've got for today do
have<00:05:20.370> some<00:05:20.520> spare<00:05:20.760> seats<00:05:21.060> in<00:05:21.240> here<00:05:21.540> I<00:05:22.040> guess

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:23.040 
have some spare seats in here I guess

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:29.360 
have some spare seats in here I guess
that<00:05:23.250> could<00:05:23.370> be<00:05:23.430> useful<00:05:24.860> anyway<00:05:25.860> I<00:05:28.130> will<00:05:29.130> keep

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:29.370 
that could be useful anyway I will keep

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:32.960 
that could be useful anyway I will keep
