talked about sprint a little bit so if

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.180 
talked about sprint a little bit so if
you<00:00:39.870> combine<00:00:40.050> Promethean<00:00:40.770> vision<00:00:41.070> with

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
you combine Promethean vision with

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.500 
you combine Promethean vision with
sprint<00:00:41.489> and<00:00:41.610> also<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:41.969> ability<00:00:42.059> where<00:00:42.450> you

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
sprint and also the ability where you

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.209 
sprint and also the ability where you
get<00:00:42.600> to<00:00:42.690> hold<00:00:42.840> two<00:00:43.020> weapons<00:00:43.350> you<00:00:44.010> are

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
get to hold two weapons you are

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.010 
get to hold two weapons you are
basically<00:00:44.610> rewarded<00:00:45.180> for<00:00:45.329> being<00:00:45.450> aggressive

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
basically rewarded for being aggressive

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.380 
basically rewarded for being aggressive
in<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.680> past<00:00:46.920> halos<00:00:47.399> you'd<00:00:47.789> be<00:00:47.940> charging

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
in the past halos you'd be charging

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:49.790 
in the past halos you'd be charging
somebody<00:00:48.719> maybe<00:00:48.960> with<00:00:49.200> your<00:00:49.320> sprint<00:00:49.620> maybe

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
whole Promethean vision now of course I

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.830 
whole Promethean vision now of course I
didn't<00:01:26.400> play<00:01:26.520> it<00:01:26.610> but<00:01:26.700> I<00:01:26.759> got<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.000> watch<00:01:27.180> the

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
didn't play it but I got the watch the

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.480 
didn't play it but I got the watch the
one<00:01:28.020> thing<00:01:28.200> I<00:01:28.320> noticed<00:01:28.530> was<00:01:28.770> it's<00:01:29.009> definitely

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
one thing I noticed was it's definitely

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:30.770 
one thing I noticed was it's definitely
gonna<00:01:29.579> be<00:01:29.640> pub<00:01:29.939> friend<00:01:30.240> lands<00:01:30.390> and<00:01:30.689> then

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
gonna be pub friend lands and then

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.240 
gonna be pub friend lands and then
actually<00:01:30.900> I<00:01:31.110> think<00:01:31.229> it'll<00:01:31.530> actually<00:01:31.650> promote

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250

drop all the way down and check snipe
one<00:02:07.200> and<00:02:07.439> then

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
one and then

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.559 
one and then
back<00:02:07.890> up<00:02:08.100> you<00:02:08.459> can<00:02:08.580> just<00:02:08.729> sit<00:02:08.880> there<00:02:09.030> toggle<00:02:09.509> in

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
back up you can just sit there toggle in

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:10.760 
back up you can just sit there toggle in
and<00:02:09.780> I<00:02:09.840> believe<00:02:10.110> you<00:02:10.200> have<00:02:10.229> to<00:02:10.380> wait<00:02:10.560> like<00:02:10.709> a

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
and I believe you have to wait like a

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.140 
and I believe you have to wait like a
split<00:02:11.160> second<00:02:11.490> for<00:02:11.520> it<00:02:11.670> to<00:02:11.730> go<00:02:11.880> through<00:02:12.120> a

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
split second for it to go through a

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.230 
split second for it to go through a
level<00:02:12.510> one<00:02:12.660> to<00:02:13.290> sea<00:02:13.470> level<00:02:13.500> one<00:02:13.890> night<00:02:14.100> so<00:02:14.880> you

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
level one to sea level one night so you

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.670 
level one to sea level one night so you
get<00:02:15.569> to<00:02:15.720> talk<00:02:15.900> with<00:02:16.080> that<00:02:16.200> so<00:02:16.350> you're<00:02:16.560> actually

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
get to talk with that so you're actually

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.320 
get to talk with that so you're actually
going<00:02:16.890> to<00:02:16.980> extra<00:02:17.250> being<00:02:17.550> the<00:02:17.700> dominant<00:02:18.150> which

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
going to extra being the dominant which

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:19.850 
going to extra being the dominant which
is<00:02:18.450> going<00:02:18.540> to<00:02:18.600> help<00:02:18.810> with<00:02:18.990> Matt<00:02:19.170> position<00:02:19.709> when

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
is going to help with Matt position when

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:20.900 
is going to help with Matt position when
you<00:02:19.950> think<00:02:20.100> about<00:02:20.190> it<00:02:20.340> because<00:02:20.640> then<00:02:20.790> your

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
you think about it because then your

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.570 
you think about it because then your
teammates<00:02:21.330> can<00:02:21.959> kind<00:02:22.200> of<00:02:22.260> scurry<00:02:23.160> around<00:02:23.370> the

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
teammates can kind of scurry around the

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.280 
teammates can kind of scurry around the
map<00:02:23.730> entirely<00:02:24.239> and<00:02:24.390> toggling<00:02:24.900> is<00:02:25.020> a<00:02:25.080> great

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
map entirely and toggling is a great

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.020 
map entirely and toggling is a great
point<00:02:25.530> it's<00:02:25.830> like<00:02:25.980> I<00:02:26.160> saw<00:02:26.370> a<00:02:26.400> lot<00:02:26.489> of<00:02:26.640> the<00:02:26.790> noobs

are split spawns I see one guy spawn in
my<00:03:32.160> brain<00:03:32.400> I<00:03:32.430> though<00:03:32.640> we're<00:03:33.239> not<00:03:33.329> blocking<00:03:33.600> any

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
two guys across the map you could

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:39.650 
two guys across the map you could
destroy<00:03:38.459> it<00:03:38.519> for<00:03:38.730> it<00:03:38.790> but<00:03:39.090> for<00:03:39.239> me<00:03:39.329> to<00:03:39.480> envision

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
destroy it for it but for me to envision

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.600 
destroy it for it but for me to envision
I<00:03:39.870> could<00:03:39.989> see<00:03:40.140> a<00:03:40.170> guy's<00:03:40.380> spawn<00:03:40.680> there<00:03:40.890> toggle

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610 
I could see a guy's spawn there toggle

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:43.250 
I could see a guy's spawn there toggle
my<00:03:41.700> promethea<00:03:42.150> vision<00:03:42.480> and<00:03:42.630> then<00:03:42.750> confirm

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
my promethea vision and then confirm

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.650 
my promethea vision and then confirm
that<00:03:43.739> the<00:03:43.860> entire<00:03:44.070> team<00:03:44.370> spawn<00:03:44.670> there<00:03:44.880> are<00:03:45.480> we

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
that the entire team spawn there are we

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.840 
that the entire team spawn there are we
this<00:03:46.079> is<00:03:46.230> good<00:03:46.380> at<00:03:46.530> the<00:03:46.620> split<00:03:46.890> spawns<00:03:47.130> hold<00:03:47.760> up

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:47.850 
this is good at the split spawns hold up

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:49.520 
this is good at the split spawns hold up
sports<00:03:48.329> bonds<00:03:48.570> but<00:03:48.750> now<00:03:48.900> I<00:03:48.930> could<00:03:49.170> be<00:03:49.230> aware<00:03:49.470> of

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
sports bonds but now I could be aware of

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.680 
sports bonds but now I could be aware of
it<00:03:49.769> yeah<00:03:50.489> you<00:03:50.970> could<00:03:51.150> be<00:03:51.299> under<00:03:51.450> something

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
it yeah you could be under something

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.199 
it yeah you could be under something
there<00:03:51.930> you<00:03:52.380> very<00:03:52.799> very<00:03:52.890> well<00:03:53.370> could<00:03:53.640> be<00:03:53.670> now

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
there you very very well could be now

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:56.690 
there you very very well could be now
neck<00:03:54.600> you<00:03:54.750> also<00:03:55.079> liked<00:03:55.290> um<00:03:55.530> the<00:03:56.130> thruster

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
neck you also liked um the thruster

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.940 
neck you also liked um the thruster
direct<00:03:57.090> yeah<00:03:57.480> so<00:03:57.750> initially<00:03:58.140> I<00:03:58.410> thought<00:03:58.739> the

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
direct yeah so initially I thought the

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.039 
direct yeah so initially I thought the
thrusters<00:03:59.430> was<00:03:59.609> going<00:03:59.730> to<00:03:59.790> be<00:03:59.970> a<00:04:00.180> replacement

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:01.049 
thrusters was going to be a replacement

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:03.140 
thrusters was going to be a replacement
for<00:04:01.079> jetpacks<00:04:01.620> and<00:04:01.799> I<00:04:01.890> was<00:04:02.760> completely<00:04:03.030> wrong

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
for jetpacks and I was completely wrong

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.599 
for jetpacks and I was completely wrong
it's<00:04:03.450> a<00:04:03.510> replacement<00:04:03.989> for<00:04:04.019> invade<00:04:04.380> so<00:04:04.920> when

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:05.609 
it's a replacement for invade so when

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:07.630 
it's a replacement for invade so when
you<00:04:05.700> pick<00:04:05.910> up<00:04:05.940> the<00:04:06.120> thrusters<00:04:06.329> I<00:04:06.810> believe<00:04:07.260> you

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:07.640 
you pick up the thrusters I believe you

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.160 
you pick up the thrusters I believe you
use<00:04:07.790> it<00:04:07.910> in<00:04:08.000> midair<00:04:08.240> so<00:04:08.660> it's<00:04:08.840> pretty<00:04:08.960> much

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:09.170 
use it in midair so it's pretty much

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:10.630 
use it in midair so it's pretty much
forever<00:04:09.350> directioner<00:04:09.620> moving<00:04:10.160> it's<00:04:10.310> like<00:04:10.460> a

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:10.640 
forever directioner moving it's like a

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.520 
forever directioner moving it's like a
little<00:04:10.910> boost<00:04:11.180> of<00:04:11.390> energy<00:04:11.510> real<00:04:11.959> quick<00:04:12.230> it's<00:04:12.440> I

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:12.530 
little boost of energy real quick it's I

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:14.380 
little boost of energy real quick it's I
got<00:04:12.709> the<00:04:12.920> second<00:04:13.220> or<00:04:13.310> two<00:04:13.459> you're<00:04:13.730> just<00:04:13.940> fly

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:14.390 
got the second or two you're just fly

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:16.270 
got the second or two you're just fly
across<00:04:14.450> the<00:04:14.690> screen<00:04:14.959> and<00:04:15.200> I<00:04:15.260> think<00:04:16.130> that's

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:16.280 
across the screen and I think that's

ramp or get down a little drop down you

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:36.370 
ramp or get down a little drop down you
have<00:04:35.060> the<00:04:35.240> the<00:04:35.510> thrusters<00:04:35.900> and<00:04:36.080> it's<00:04:36.230> just

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:36.380 
have the the thrusters and it's just

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:38.590 
have the the thrusters and it's just
like<00:04:36.440> a<00:04:36.530> split<00:04:36.919> second<00:04:37.280> get<00:04:37.610> away<00:04:37.850> instead<00:04:38.480> of

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:38.600 
like a split second get away instead of

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.300 
like a split second get away instead of
like<00:04:38.750> the<00:04:38.870> evade<00:04:39.620> which<00:04:39.800> is<00:04:39.919> completely

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:40.310 
like the evade which is completely

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:42.940 
like the evade which is completely
overpowered<00:04:40.940> and<00:04:41.060> I<00:04:41.900> think<00:04:42.530> you<00:04:42.590> could<00:04:42.710> use<00:04:42.830> in

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:42.950 
overpowered and I think you could use in

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:45.400 
overpowered and I think you could use in
the<00:04:43.040> net<00:04:43.190> the<00:04:43.220> air<00:04:43.520> as<00:04:43.850> well<00:04:44.030> so<00:04:44.390> and<00:04:44.990> best<00:04:45.260> man

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:45.410 
the net the air as well so and best man

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:46.750 
the net the air as well so and best man
you<00:04:45.620> said<00:04:45.830> you<00:04:46.070> know<00:04:46.190> this<00:04:46.340> is<00:04:46.370> the<00:04:46.520> game<00:04:46.730> that

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:46.760 
you said you know this is the game that

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:48.130 
you said you know this is the game that
halo<00:04:47.090> reach<00:04:47.360> could<00:04:47.540> have<00:04:47.630> been<00:04:47.810> this<00:04:48.020> is<00:04:48.110> what

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:48.140 
halo reach could have been this is what

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:50.290 
halo reach could have been this is what
this<00:04:48.560> is<00:04:48.620> the<00:04:48.860> better<00:04:49.280> halo<00:04:49.580> reach<00:04:49.880> right<00:04:50.120> and

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:50.300 
this is the better halo reach right and

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.510 
this is the better halo reach right and
the<00:04:50.720> Athene<00:04:51.020> was<00:04:51.470> a<00:04:51.500> cool<00:04:51.740> ability<00:04:52.160> and<00:04:52.430> when

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:52.520 
the Athene was a cool ability and when

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:53.890 
the Athene was a cool ability and when
the<00:04:52.610> game<00:04:52.730> first<00:04:52.760> came<00:04:53.060> out<00:04:53.270> I<00:04:53.330> really<00:04:53.660> liked

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:53.900 
the game first came out I really liked

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:55.990 
the game first came out I really liked
it<00:04:54.020> but<00:04:54.410> it<00:04:54.590> makes<00:04:54.890> your<00:04:55.010> hip<00:04:55.190> box<00:04:55.400> smaller<00:04:55.790> you

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:56.000 
it but it makes your hip box smaller you

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.580 
it but it makes your hip box smaller you
go<00:04:56.030> into<00:04:56.330> this<00:04:56.480> animation<00:04:56.960> where<00:04:57.290> it's<00:04:57.410> harder

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:57.590 
go into this animation where it's harder

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:59.920 
go into this animation where it's harder
to<00:04:57.770> shoot<00:04:58.070> this<00:04:58.460> is<00:04:58.610> the<00:04:58.730> same<00:04:58.970> idea<00:04:59.419> but<00:04:59.630> you

00:04:59.920 --> 00:04:59.930 
to shoot this is the same idea but you

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:01.480 
to shoot this is the same idea but you
can<00:05:00.050> still<00:05:00.230> be<00:05:00.380> shot<00:05:00.620> while<00:05:00.800> doing<00:05:01.010> it<00:05:01.220> now

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:01.490 
can still be shot while doing it now

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:02.800 
can still be shot while doing it now
what<00:05:01.640> I<00:05:01.669> won't<00:05:01.910> really<00:05:02.120> want<00:05:02.330> to<00:05:02.390> see<00:05:02.510> if

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:02.810 
what I won't really want to see if

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:04.420 
what I won't really want to see if
players<00:05:03.080> get<00:05:03.290> good<00:05:03.440> enough<00:05:03.530> so<00:05:04.100> they<00:05:04.220> hid

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:04.430 
players get good enough so they hid

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:06.460 
players get good enough so they hid
their<00:05:04.460> boost<00:05:04.880> and<00:05:05.120> mid<00:05:05.300> boost<00:05:05.540> they<00:05:05.930> noscope

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:06.470 
their boost and mid boost they noscope

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:07.480 
their boost and mid boost they noscope
you<00:05:06.620> because<00:05:06.770> that'll<00:05:06.980> make<00:05:07.070> for<00:05:07.190> some<00:05:07.340> sick

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:07.490

if they actually get those five kills
doesn't<00:05:39.290> that<00:05:39.350> make<00:05:39.500> sense<00:05:39.740> so<00:05:39.919> that's<00:05:40.100> the

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:40.160 
doesn't that make sense so that's the

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:42.310 
doesn't that make sense so that's the
thing<00:05:40.340> they<00:05:40.490> have<00:05:40.669> to<00:05:40.820> get<00:05:40.940> the<00:05:41.030> five<00:05:41.210> kills<00:05:41.570> if

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:42.320 
thing they have to get the five kills if

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:43.630 
thing they have to get the five kills if
you're<00:05:42.500> destroying<00:05:42.919> a<00:05:43.070> team<00:05:43.310> and<00:05:43.550> they

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:43.640 
you're destroying a team and they

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:45.310 
you're destroying a team and they
haven't<00:05:43.970> gotten<00:05:44.090> any<00:05:44.210> kills<00:05:44.570> on<00:05:44.780> you<00:05:44.930> they're

not going to have the ordnance drop in
the<00:05:46.760> first<00:05:46.970> place<00:05:47.120> it's<00:05:47.690> going<00:05:47.900> to<00:05:47.930> be<00:05:48.050> really

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:48.410 
the first place it's going to be really

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:50.920 
the first place it's going to be really
hard<00:05:48.740> for<00:05:49.240> multiple<00:05:50.240> players<00:05:50.479> on<00:05:50.690> the<00:05:50.780> team

hard for multiple players on the team

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:53.140 
hard for multiple players on the team
for<00:05:51.140> someone<00:05:51.680> to<00:05:51.830> not<00:05:52.070> get<00:05:52.280> five<00:05:52.490> times<00:05:52.789> if

for someone to not get five times if
there's<00:05:53.479> no<00:05:53.630> ranking<00:05:53.960> system<00:05:54.380> we're<00:05:54.620> gonna

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:54.740 
there's no ranking system we're gonna

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:56.140 
there's no ranking system we're gonna
see<00:05:54.979> that

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:56.150 
see that

00:05:56.150 --> 00:06:00.330 
see that
and<00:05:56.900> that<00:05:57.680> is<00:05:57.890> something<00:05:58.160> for<00:05:58.490> another<00:05:58.610> topic

this video is abilities the other two
were<00:06:06.680> hologram<00:06:07.370> and<00:06:09.040> drawn<00:06:10.040> a<00:06:10.070> blank<00:06:10.220> here<00:06:10.370> not

the shield reject yet no Sheila the
heart<00:06:13.430> earring<00:06:14.080> so<00:06:15.080> you<00:06:15.140> got<00:06:15.410> a<00:06:15.440> hologram<00:06:16.310> at

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:16.490 
heart earring so you got a hologram at

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:19.030 
heart earring so you got a hologram at
hard<00:06:16.640> line<00:06:16.790> and<00:06:17.090> I<00:06:17.540> use<00:06:17.780> those<00:06:18.020> briefly<00:06:18.440> just

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:19.040 
hard line and I use those briefly just

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:20.770 
hard line and I use those briefly just
felt<00:06:19.310> pretty<00:06:19.520> pointless<00:06:19.850> hologram<00:06:20.360> we<00:06:20.480> saw<00:06:20.660> it

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:20.780 
felt pretty pointless hologram we saw it

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:22.000 
felt pretty pointless hologram we saw it
reach<00:06:20.990> pretty<00:06:21.260> much<00:06:21.380> the<00:06:21.470> same<00:06:21.590> thing<00:06:21.650> and

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:22.010 
reach pretty much the same thing and

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:24.490 
reach pretty much the same thing and
hard<00:06:22.460> line<00:06:22.640> is<00:06:22.760> just<00:06:22.910> a<00:06:22.970> shield<00:06:23.240> and<00:06:23.720> I<00:06:24.170> think

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:24.500 
hard line is just a shield and I think

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:25.990 
hard line is just a shield and I think
you<00:06:24.560> can<00:06:24.710> move<00:06:24.830> around<00:06:25.010> a<00:06:25.250> little<00:06:25.370> bit<00:06:25.610> but<00:06:25.850> it

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:26.000 
you can move around a little bit but it

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.180 
you can move around a little bit but it
you<00:06:26.150> can't<00:06:26.330> shoot<00:06:26.510> just<00:06:26.750> like<00:06:27.710> the<00:06:27.980> riot

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:28.190 
you can't shoot just like the riot

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:31.450 
you can't shoot just like the riot
shield<00:06:28.340> yeah<00:06:28.760> so<00:06:29.060> yeah<00:06:29.240> so<00:06:30.100> you've<00:06:31.100> seen<00:06:31.220> a<00:06:31.280> lot

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:31.460 
shield yeah so yeah so you've seen a lot

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:33.940 
shield yeah so yeah so you've seen a lot
of<00:06:31.490> you<00:06:31.910> know<00:06:32.000> the<00:06:32.300> lot<00:06:32.720> of<00:06:32.840> the<00:06:32.960> speculation

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:33.950 
of you know the lot of the speculation

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:36.070 
of you know the lot of the speculation
was<00:06:34.040> going<00:06:34.340> to<00:06:34.400> be<00:06:34.490> caught<00:06:34.700> yes<00:06:35.540> it<00:06:35.750> is<00:06:35.870> caught

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:36.080 
was going to be caught yes it is caught

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:38.080 
was going to be caught yes it is caught
friendly<00:06:36.470> a<00:06:36.500> little<00:06:36.800> bit<00:06:36.980> you<00:06:37.220> know<00:06:37.280> the<00:06:37.640> you

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:38.090 
friendly a little bit you know the you

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:40.420 
friendly a little bit you know the you
know<00:06:38.210> the<00:06:38.450> warmest<00:06:39.050> drops<00:06:39.290> and<00:06:39.560> the<00:06:40.100> hardline

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:40.430 
know the warmest drops and the hardline

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:41.650 
know the warmest drops and the hardline
shields<00:06:40.700> and<00:06:40.820> other<00:06:40.940> little<00:06:41.120> factors<00:06:41.510> but

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:41.660 
shields and other little factors but

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:43.510 
shields and other little factors but
those<00:06:42.230> two<00:06:42.440> just<00:06:42.770> seemed<00:06:42.950> pretty<00:06:42.980> pointless

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:43.520 
those two just seemed pretty pointless

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:45.250 
those two just seemed pretty pointless
from<00:06:43.730> when<00:06:43.850> i<00:06:43.880> play<00:06:44.090> but<00:06:44.390> yeah<00:06:44.690> the<00:06:44.960> two<00:06:45.110> main

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:45.260 
from when i play but yeah the two main

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:48.280 
from when i play but yeah the two main
ones<00:06:45.380> were<00:06:45.530> thruster<00:06:45.920> and<00:06:46.570> Promethean<00:06:47.570> and

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:48.290 
ones were thruster and Promethean and

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:50.410 
ones were thruster and Promethean and
you<00:06:48.410> know<00:06:48.530> I<00:06:48.560> don't<00:06:48.740> want<00:06:48.950> to<00:06:49.010> totally<00:06:49.420> trash

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:50.420 
you know I don't want to totally trash

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:51.910 
you know I don't want to totally trash
the<00:06:50.840> shield<00:06:51.140> or<00:06:51.320> anything<00:06:51.530> like<00:06:51.560> that<00:06:51.680> i<00:06:51.800> think

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:51.920 
the shield or anything like that i think

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:54.550 
the shield or anything like that i think
for<00:06:52.280> pubs<00:06:52.520> and<00:06:52.820> for<00:06:53.450> those<00:06:53.540> fun<00:06:53.870> game<00:06:54.140> types<00:06:54.410> or

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:54.560

for pubs and for those fun game types or
your<00:06:54.650> writing<00:06:54.920> warthogs<00:06:55.280> and<00:06:55.490> doing<00:06:55.730> the

00:06:57.430 --> 00:06:57.440 
races this shield make it pretty cool

00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:59.230 
races this shield make it pretty cool

competitive<00:07:09.230> from<00:07:09.650> what<00:07:09.770> I've<00:07:09.890> seen<00:07:09.920> is<00:07:10.250> good

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:10.610 
competitive from what I've seen is good

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:12.220 
competitive from what I've seen is good
players<00:07:10.820> playing<00:07:11.030> two<00:07:11.180> doubles<00:07:11.540> and<00:07:11.630> the
