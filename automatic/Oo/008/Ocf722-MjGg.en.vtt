00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:32.119 
that you can actually see this so this

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:34.240 
that you can actually see this so this
this<00:01:32.450> channel<00:01:32.840> right<00:01:32.990> here<00:01:33.320> is<00:01:33.979> actually

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:34.250 
this channel right here is actually

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:39.340 
this channel right here is actually
damaged<00:01:36.759> so<00:01:37.759> as<00:01:38.000> the<00:01:38.479> paper<00:01:38.690> feeds<00:01:39.020> through

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350 
damaged so as the paper feeds through

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.670 
damaged so as the paper feeds through

it's not able to make the full paths and

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.880 
it's not able to make the full paths and
then<00:01:42.890> actually<00:01:43.340> cut<00:01:43.640> so<00:01:44.300> the<00:01:44.899> paper<00:01:45.140> jams<00:01:45.619> and

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890
