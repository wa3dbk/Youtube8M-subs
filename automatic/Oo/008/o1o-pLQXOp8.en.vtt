I'll do it

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.220 
I'll do it
it's<00:01:00.910> actually<00:01:01.180> split<00:01:01.329> into<00:01:01.450> two<00:01:01.690> paragraphs

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:02.230 
it's actually split into two paragraphs

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:03.990 
it's actually split into two paragraphs
and<00:01:02.440> in<00:01:02.620> between<00:01:02.770> the<00:01:03.160> two<00:01:03.190> paragraphs<00:01:03.550> and

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:04.000 
and in between the two paragraphs and

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.760 
and in between the two paragraphs and
you<00:01:04.059> kind<00:01:04.239> of<00:01:04.269> go<00:01:04.449> away<00:01:04.540> into<00:01:04.899> this<00:01:05.079> little<00:01:05.379> bit

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:05.770 
you kind of go away into this little bit

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:07.980 
you kind of go away into this little bit
which<00:01:06.460> is<00:01:06.490> played<00:01:06.729> in<00:01:06.820> the<00:01:06.939> C<00:01:07.119> major<00:01:07.149> chord<00:01:07.420> but

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:07.990 
which is played in the C major chord but

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.499 
which is played in the C major chord but
we<00:01:08.170> pluck<00:01:08.469> it<00:01:08.619> so<00:01:08.979> this<00:01:09.640> is<00:01:09.700> how<00:01:09.820> you<00:01:09.969> play<00:01:10.360> it

00:01:10.499 --> 00:01:10.509 
we pluck it so this is how you play it

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:12.510 
we pluck it so this is how you play it
from<00:01:10.869> the<00:01:11.020> verse<00:01:11.200> leading<00:01:11.979> into<00:01:12.159> that<00:01:12.310> bit

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:12.520 
from the verse leading into that bit

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:26.980 
from the verse leading into that bit
over<00:01:12.820> there

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.930 

so<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.470> course<00:01:28.770> kind<00:01:29.010> of<00:01:29.100> starts<00:01:29.370> off<00:01:29.430> in<00:01:29.670> G

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:29.940 
so the course kind of starts off in G

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.780 
so the course kind of starts off in G
where<00:01:30.390> everybody<00:01:30.900> says<00:01:31.110> chala<00:01:32.040> do<00:01:32.190> it<00:01:32.310> it<00:01:32.640> goes

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
where everybody says chala do it it goes

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.470 
where everybody says chala do it it goes
into<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.150> same<00:01:33.360> chords<00:01:33.720> as<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:34.080> verse<00:01:34.320> so<00:01:34.590> C<00:01:34.920> F

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:35.480 
into the same chords as the verse so C F

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:52.390 
into the same chords as the verse so C F
and<00:01:36.480> a<00:01:36.930> G

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:52.400 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.270 

and<00:01:53.400> that's<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:54.030> course<00:01:54.270> the<00:01:55.170> bridge<00:01:55.740> section

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
and that's the course the bridge section

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.220 
and that's the course the bridge section
for<00:01:56.760> Charlotte<00:01:57.180> do<00:01:57.300> it<00:01:57.420> goes<00:01:57.660> something<00:01:58.200> like

00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:58.230
