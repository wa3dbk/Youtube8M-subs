a little sponge a little wedge i'm going
to<00:02:31.920> try<00:02:32.040> using<00:02:32.250> a<00:02:32.640> wedge<00:02:33.799> remember<00:02:34.799> that<00:02:34.980> the

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:35.609 
to try using a wedge remember that the

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:38.000 
to try using a wedge remember that the
skin<00:02:35.970> under<00:02:36.390> your<00:02:36.420> eye<00:02:36.600> is<00:02:37.079> very<00:02:37.350> delicate<00:02:37.590> so

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
skin under your eye is very delicate so

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.069 
skin under your eye is very delicate so
you<00:02:38.070> want<00:02:38.370> to<00:02:38.430> be<00:02:38.459> soft<00:02:38.910> and<00:02:39.090> gentle<00:02:39.269> with

you want to be soft and gentle with
blending<00:02:40.560> it<00:02:40.650> so<00:02:40.920> just<00:02:41.730> little<00:02:41.880> patches<00:02:44.000> sorry

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
blending it so just little patches sorry

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.230

and just blend

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.840 
and just blend
it'd<00:02:49.870> probably<00:02:50.110> be<00:02:50.260> easier<00:02:50.350> to<00:02:50.920> use<00:02:51.160> your

can<00:02:54.640> help<00:02:55.920> blend<00:02:56.920> it<00:02:57.070> out<00:02:57.960> just<00:02:58.960> gentle<00:03:00.420> and

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
can help blend it out just gentle and

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.030 
can help blend it out just gentle and
then<00:03:01.540> the<00:03:01.630> next<00:03:01.810> step<00:03:02.020> I'm<00:03:02.260> going<00:03:02.320> to<00:03:02.800> apply
