00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
taper so I just take my white thread and

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:57.889 
taper so I just take my white thread and
I<00:01:38.640> build<00:01:38.910> up<00:01:39.090> a<00:01:39.210> little<00:01:39.420> bit<00:01:39.570> of<00:01:39.690> a<00:01:39.780> hump<00:01:39.990> here

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.109 

try<00:01:58.530> to<00:01:58.590> smooth<00:01:58.950> it<00:01:59.070> out<00:01:59.219> so<00:01:59.549> when<00:01:59.640> we<00:01:59.729> wrap<00:01:59.939> our

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
try to smooth it out so when we wrap our

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:06.559 
try to smooth it out so when we wrap our
tubing<00:02:00.479> it<00:02:00.600> doesn't<00:02:01.369> bulk<00:02:02.369> up<00:02:02.579> on<00:02:02.789> us<00:02:05.479> then<00:02:06.479> you

00:02:06.559 --> 00:02:06.569 
tubing it doesn't bulk up on us then you

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:08.150 
tubing it doesn't bulk up on us then you
can<00:02:06.689> take<00:02:06.840> your<00:02:07.020> thread<00:02:07.289> all<00:02:07.500> the<00:02:07.530> way<00:02:07.710> forward

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
to the thorax there we go you can take

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.770 
to the thorax there we go you can take
that<00:02:16.680> tubing<00:02:17.129> and<00:02:17.250> just<00:02:17.489> wrap<00:02:18.030> it<00:02:18.060> over<00:02:18.390> your

see<00:03:18.840> the<00:03:19.049> tip<00:03:19.230> of<00:03:19.349> the<00:03:19.410> feather<00:03:19.620> I<00:03:20.150> just<00:03:21.150> get<00:03:21.329> in

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
see the tip of the feather I just get in

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:25.280 
see the tip of the feather I just get in
there<00:03:21.599> and<00:03:21.780> I<00:03:21.840> can<00:03:21.989> trim<00:03:22.230> out<00:03:22.349> the<00:03:22.500> tip<00:03:24.290> that

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
there and I can trim out the tip that

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.930 
there and I can trim out the tip that
exposes<00:03:25.920> like<00:03:26.069> a<00:03:26.099> V<00:03:28.310> and<00:03:29.310> I'm<00:03:29.519> gonna<00:03:29.700> tie<00:03:29.910> that

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
exposes like a V and I'm gonna tie that

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:39.949 
exposes like a V and I'm gonna tie that
V<00:03:30.329> in<00:03:31.370> each<00:03:32.370> side<00:03:32.730> of<00:03:32.940> the<00:03:33.000> fly<00:03:38.180> just<00:03:39.180> like<00:03:39.299> so<00:03:39.720> I

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
V in each side of the fly just like so I

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:44.599 
V in each side of the fly just like so I
pinch<00:03:40.470> the<00:03:40.980> fibers<00:03:41.459> on<00:03:41.639> each<00:03:41.880> side<00:03:43.310> do<00:03:44.310> a<00:03:44.340> loose

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:44.609 
pinch the fibers on each side do a loose

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:46.670 
pinch the fibers on each side do a loose
wrap<00:03:44.819> around<00:03:45.209> those<00:03:45.359> feathers<00:03:45.810> and<00:03:46.230> then<00:03:46.410> pull

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
wrap around those feathers and then pull

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:54.259 
wrap around those feathers and then pull
tight<00:03:50.900> that's<00:03:51.900> gonna<00:03:52.109> do<00:03:52.319> is<00:03:52.470> make<00:03:52.709> some<00:03:53.269> legs

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269 
tight that's gonna do is make some legs

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:58.009 
tight that's gonna do is make some legs
on<00:03:54.840> each<00:03:54.989> side<00:03:55.230> of<00:03:55.260> the<00:03:55.380> fly<00:03:56.750> and<00:03:57.750> they<00:03:57.870> can

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019 
on each side of the fly and they can

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:01.099 
on each side of the fly and they can
take<00:03:58.169> my<00:03:58.319> thread<00:03:58.560> forward<00:03:59.450> near<00:04:00.450> the<00:04:00.599> eye<00:04:00.630> and

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:01.109 
take my thread forward near the eye and

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:02.629 
take my thread forward near the eye and
I<00:04:01.230> pull<00:04:01.440> tight<00:04:01.680> on<00:04:01.829> the<00:04:01.919> thread<00:04:02.190> and<00:04:02.430> I<00:04:02.489> can

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:02.639 
I pull tight on the thread and I can

00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:04.940 
I pull tight on the thread and I can
actually<00:04:02.880> just<00:04:03.030> break<00:04:03.299> all<00:04:03.510> that<00:04:03.950> Partridge

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
actually just break all that Partridge

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.789 
actually just break all that Partridge
right<00:04:05.160> out<00:04:05.310> of<00:04:05.459> there<00:04:06.349> it's<00:04:07.349> usually<00:04:07.469> the

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:07.799 
right out of there it's usually the

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:09.980 
right out of there it's usually the
cleanest<00:04:08.219> way<00:04:08.370> to<00:04:08.400> do<00:04:08.640> it

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:09.990 
cleanest way to do it

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:12.110 
cleanest way to do it
gonna<00:04:10.710> hold<00:04:10.980> your<00:04:11.160> thread<00:04:11.370> tight<00:04:11.610> that's<00:04:11.910> the

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
gonna hold your thread tight that's the

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:17.300 
gonna hold your thread tight that's the
key<00:04:12.330> tension<00:04:13.080> on<00:04:13.200> the<00:04:13.320> thread<00:04:15.890> now<00:04:16.890> I'm<00:04:17.100> ready

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
key tension on the thread now I'm ready

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:24.320 
key tension on the thread now I'm ready
for<00:04:17.610> the<00:04:18.650> thorax<00:04:19.650> material<00:04:22.940> which<00:04:23.940> will<00:04:24.150> just

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
for the thorax material which will just

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:29.510 
for the thorax material which will just
be<00:04:25.310> strand<00:04:26.310> of<00:04:26.490> ostrich<00:04:28.220> depending<00:04:29.220> on<00:04:29.340> what

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
be strand of ostrich depending on what

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.280 
be strand of ostrich depending on what
color<00:04:29.790> your<00:04:30.210> tie<00:04:30.450> in<00:04:30.510> depends<00:04:30.930> on<00:04:30.990> the<00:04:31.080> color

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:31.290 
color your tie in depends on the color

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:32.480 
color your tie in depends on the color
the<00:04:31.500> ostrich<00:04:31.770> that<00:04:31.890> you're<00:04:32.010> gonna<00:04:32.100> use<00:04:32.190> I'm

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490 
the ostrich that you're gonna use I'm

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:36.860 
the ostrich that you're gonna use I'm
going<00:04:32.610> to<00:04:32.670> use<00:04:32.790> like<00:04:33.060> a<00:04:33.090> tan<00:04:33.510> color<00:04:35.390> but<00:04:36.390> like<00:04:36.780> I

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 
going to use like a tan color but like I

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:38.600 
going to use like a tan color but like I
said<00:04:37.050> you<00:04:37.170> can<00:04:37.320> use<00:04:37.350> olives<00:04:37.890> you<00:04:38.040> can<00:04:38.190> use<00:04:38.340> dark

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610 
said you can use olives you can use dark

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:43.010 
said you can use olives you can use dark
gray<00:04:39.470> can<00:04:40.470> really<00:04:40.820> use<00:04:41.820> whatever<00:04:42.030> color<00:04:42.840> you

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:43.020 
gray can really use whatever color you

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:46.460 
gray can really use whatever color you
don't<00:04:43.230> want<00:04:44.480> I'm<00:04:45.480> just<00:04:45.660> going<00:04:45.780> to<00:04:45.810> tie<00:04:46.020> this<00:04:46.080> in

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.470 
don't want I'm just going to tie this in

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:52.370 
don't want I'm just going to tie this in
so<00:04:47.100> all<00:04:47.220> the<00:04:47.340> fibers<00:04:48.350> face<00:04:49.350> backwards<00:04:51.380> that

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.380 
so all the fibers face backwards that

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:54.620 
so all the fibers face backwards that
way<00:04:52.440> when<00:04:52.710> I<00:04:52.740> wrap<00:04:53.010> it<00:04:53.040> the<00:04:53.910> fibers<00:04:54.360> will<00:04:54.510> lay

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:54.630 
way when I wrap it the fibers will lay

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:58.100 
way when I wrap it the fibers will lay
back<00:04:54.810> on<00:04:55.050> the<00:04:55.140> fly<00:04:56.540> so<00:04:57.540> I<00:04:57.600> just<00:04:57.780> take<00:04:57.930> that

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:58.110 
back on the fly so I just take that

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:02.620 
back on the fly so I just take that
ostrich<00:04:58.320> and<00:04:58.740> I<00:04:58.770> wrap<00:04:58.980> it<00:04:59.010> around<00:04:59.220> the<00:04:59.610> hook

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:02.630 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:07.220 

nice<00:05:03.630> and<00:05:03.870> even<00:05:05.360> once<00:05:06.360> I<00:05:06.480> get<00:05:06.630> up<00:05:06.660> to<00:05:06.990> the<00:05:07.020> eye<00:05:07.140> i

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:07.230 
nice and even once I get up to the eye i

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:12.590 
nice and even once I get up to the eye i
just<00:05:07.650> capture<00:05:08.100> that<00:05:08.250> ostrich<00:05:11.330> again<00:05:12.330> I<00:05:12.450> can

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:12.600 
just capture that ostrich again I can

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:14.090 
just capture that ostrich again I can
use<00:05:12.630> heavy<00:05:12.900> tension<00:05:13.170> on<00:05:13.410> the<00:05:13.500> thread<00:05:13.530> just<00:05:14.010> to

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:14.100 
use heavy tension on the thread just to

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:16.880 
use heavy tension on the thread just to
break<00:05:14.340> out<00:05:14.550> the<00:05:14.820> tip<00:05:15.300> of<00:05:15.450> ostrich<00:05:15.900> there's

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:16.890 
break out the tip of ostrich there's

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:18.740 
break out the tip of ostrich there's
some<00:05:17.190> fuzzies<00:05:17.610> sometimes<00:05:18.060> left<00:05:18.300> and<00:05:18.510> you<00:05:18.570> just

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:18.750 
some fuzzies sometimes left and you just

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:26.210 
some fuzzies sometimes left and you just
trim<00:05:18.960> those<00:05:19.080> fuzzies<00:05:19.530> out

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:26.220 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:35.900 

now<00:05:26.790> you<00:05:26.850> can<00:05:27.210> whip<00:05:27.390> finish<00:05:34.490> that's<00:05:35.490> all<00:05:35.730> there

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:35.910 
now you can whip finish that's all there

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:41.240 
now you can whip finish that's all there
is<00:05:36.060> to<00:05:36.270> a<00:05:37.580> graphic<00:05:38.580> caddis<00:05:39.980> now<00:05:40.980> when<00:05:41.130> this

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:41.250 
is to a graphic caddis now when this

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:44.120 
is to a graphic caddis now when this
flag<00:05:41.430> gets<00:05:41.640> wet<00:05:41.850> all<00:05:42.210> this<00:05:42.570> ostrich<00:05:43.530> will<00:05:43.980> lay

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:44.130 
flag gets wet all this ostrich will lay

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:50.180 
flag gets wet all this ostrich will lay
back<00:05:45.170> just<00:05:46.170> like<00:05:46.380> so<00:05:47.000> giving<00:05:48.000> it<00:05:48.090> a<00:05:48.180> very<00:05:49.190> buggy

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:50.190 
back just like so giving it a very buggy

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:53.420 
back just like so giving it a very buggy
appearance<00:05:51.350> it<00:05:52.350> won't<00:05:52.530> all<00:05:52.680> stand<00:05:53.040> up<00:05:53.250> like

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:53.430 
appearance it won't all stand up like

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:55.460 
appearance it won't all stand up like
that<00:05:53.490> ostrich<00:05:53.910> is<00:05:54.270> actually<00:05:54.630> very<00:05:54.810> soft<00:05:55.110> so

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:55.470 
that ostrich is actually very soft so

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:58.270 
that ostrich is actually very soft so
it'll<00:05:55.680> all<00:05:55.830> kind<00:05:56.100> of<00:05:56.360> little<00:05:57.360> lay<00:05:57.480> back<00:05:57.720> just

00:05:58.270 --> 00:05:58.280 
it'll all kind of little lay back just

00:05:58.280 --> 00:05:59.920 
it'll all kind of little lay back just
like<00:05:59.280> that

00:05:59.920 --> 00:05:59.930 
like that

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:03.790 
like that
give<00:06:00.930> it<00:06:01.050> a<00:06:01.200> very<00:06:01.410> lifelike<00:06:02.160> kind<00:06:02.610> of<00:06:02.670> a<00:06:02.760> pupa

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:03.800 
give it a very lifelike kind of a pupa

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:08.180 
give it a very lifelike kind of a pupa
pupil<00:06:04.800> look<00:06:04.980> to<00:06:05.190> it<00:06:06.470> that's<00:06:07.470> really<00:06:07.860> what<00:06:08.010> this

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:08.190 
pupil look to it that's really what this

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:10.130
