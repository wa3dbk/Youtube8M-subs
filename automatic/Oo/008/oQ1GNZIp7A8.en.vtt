00:00:27.749 --> 00:00:32.359 
going to be teaching you how to make
your<00:00:28.079> own<00:00:28.140> little<00:00:28.730> kind<00:00:29.730> of<00:00:29.909> window<00:00:31.070> soft<00:00:32.070> box

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
your own little kind of window soft box

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.920 
your own little kind of window soft box
type<00:00:32.759> of<00:00:32.970> thing<00:00:33.180> whoa<00:00:35.270> if<00:00:36.270> you<00:00:36.480> don't<00:00:36.660> have<00:00:36.780> the

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
type of thing whoa if you don't have the

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.740 
type of thing whoa if you don't have the
grayscale<00:00:37.440> gorilla<00:00:37.830> light<00:00:38.130> kit<00:00:38.460> then<00:00:38.910> this<00:00:39.570> is

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
grayscale gorilla light kit then this is

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.890 
grayscale gorilla light kit then this is
probably<00:00:39.990> a<00:00:40.410> good<00:00:40.970> alternative<00:00:41.970> to<00:00:42.570> the

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:42.900 
probably a good alternative to the

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:48.290 
probably a good alternative to the
window<00:00:43.200> softbox<00:00:43.770> that<00:00:44.010> he<00:00:44.280> has<00:00:47.090> so<00:00:48.090> you<00:00:48.150> can

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
window softbox that he has so you can

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.350 
window softbox that he has so you can
make<00:00:48.420> some<00:00:48.660> good<00:00:49.010> hdri<00:00:50.010> looking<00:00:50.640> type<00:00:51.150> of

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
make some good hdri looking type of

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:59.600 
make some good hdri looking type of
things<00:00:57.680> so<00:00:58.680> as<00:00:58.800> you<00:00:58.950> can<00:00:59.040> see<00:00:59.250> that<00:00:59.280> little

00:00:59.600 --> 00:00:59.610 
things so as you can see that little

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:02.960 
things so as you can see that little
window<00:01:00.650> softbox<00:01:01.650> like<00:01:02.070> anything<00:01:02.490> right<00:01:02.700> there

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:02.970 
window softbox like anything right there

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:05.749 
window softbox like anything right there
looks<00:01:03.810> pretty<00:01:04.080> nice<00:01:04.350> and<00:01:04.650> reflections<00:01:05.369> so

00:01:05.749 --> 00:01:05.759 
looks pretty nice and reflections so

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:12.529 
looks pretty nice and reflections so
let's<00:01:06.240> let's<00:01:06.810> get<00:01:07.609> right<00:01:08.609> into<00:01:08.670> this<00:01:11.539> alright

00:01:12.529 --> 00:01:12.539 
let's let's get right into this alright

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
to out anti-aliasing geometry best one

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.969 
to out anti-aliasing geometry best one
by<00:01:29.189> one<00:01:29.399> by<00:01:29.549> four<00:01:29.609> by<00:01:29.969> four<00:01:30.380> that<00:01:31.380> should<00:01:31.829> be

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:25.430 
into the corner object go and click on
the<00:03:22.890> color<00:03:23.069> object<00:03:23.340> layer<00:03:23.849> got<00:03:24.750> a<00:03:24.780> mode<00:03:25.079> and

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
the color object layer got a mode and

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.520 
the color object layer got a mode and
make<00:03:25.650> it<00:03:25.769> a<00:03:25.829> grid<00:03:26.069> or<00:03:26.220> grid<00:03:27.000> array<00:03:27.450> and<00:03:27.810> take

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
make it a grid or grid array and take

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:33.080 
make it a grid or grid array and take
down<00:03:28.739> the<00:03:29.190> middle<00:03:29.430> count<00:03:30.150> 21<00:03:30.989> and<00:03:31.849> then<00:03:32.849> these

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
down the middle count 21 and then these

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:39.890 
down the middle count 21 and then these
ones<00:03:33.450> 24<00:03:35.269> and<00:03:36.269> then<00:03:36.450> drag<00:03:36.989> the<00:03:37.200> size<00:03:37.470> up<00:03:38.900> about

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
ones 24 and then drag the size up about

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:55.580 
ones 24 and then drag the size up about
their<00:03:40.549> 682<00:03:41.549> and<00:03:41.940> 682<00:03:51.079> so<00:03:52.079> there<00:03:52.410> we<00:03:52.739> go<00:03:54.590> all

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
their 682 and 682 so there we go all

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.910 
their 682 and 682 so there we go all
right<00:03:56.569> now<00:03:57.569> we're<00:03:58.109> gonna<00:03:58.230> just<00:03:58.560> grab<00:03:58.680> the

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 
right now we're gonna just grab the

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.059 
right now we're gonna just grab the
rotate<00:03:59.280> tool<00:03:59.420> and<00:04:00.420> rotate<00:04:01.019> it<00:04:01.049> a<00:04:01.290> bit<00:04:01.470> kind<00:04:02.040> of

00:04:02.059 --> 00:04:02.069 
rotate tool and rotate it a bit kind of

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:06.830 
rotate tool and rotate it a bit kind of
like<00:04:02.220> to<00:04:02.459> there<00:04:02.989> and<00:04:03.989> we're<00:04:04.829> gonna<00:04:04.980> move<00:04:05.400> it<00:04:05.840> up

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
like to there and we're gonna move it up

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:12.940 
like to there and we're gonna move it up

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:12.950 
and out like that we're going to grab a

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:15.680 
and out like that we're going to grab a
material<00:04:13.950> just<00:04:14.190> check<00:04:14.819> the<00:04:15.000> luminance<00:04:15.359> box

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
material just check the luminance box

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:18.080 
material just check the luminance box
and<00:04:16.049> then<00:04:16.799> we<00:04:16.979> have<00:04:17.099> this<00:04:17.310> really<00:04:17.669> bright

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
and then we have this really bright

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.659 
and then we have this really bright
white<00:04:18.450> material<00:04:19.019> drag<00:04:19.919> it<00:04:20.070> onto<00:04:20.190> the<00:04:20.310> corner

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669 
white material drag it onto the corner

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:26.029 
white material drag it onto the corner
object<00:04:21.150> and<00:04:22.280> render<00:04:23.280> this<00:04:23.370> out<00:04:24.740> and<00:04:25.740> as<00:04:25.860> you

right um alright so now make it look a
little<00:04:55.810> bit<00:04:56.050> better<00:04:56.199> for<00:04:57.130> the<00:04:57.220> softbox<00:04:57.669> to

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:57.970 
little bit better for the softbox to

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:00.510 
little bit better for the softbox to
actually<00:04:58.330> give<00:04:59.139> off<00:04:59.350> some<00:04:59.680> lighting<00:05:00.040> you<00:05:00.370> want

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:00.520 
actually give off some lighting you want

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.670 
actually give off some lighting you want
to<00:05:00.580> put<00:05:00.729> some<00:05:00.970> global<00:05:01.570> illumination<00:05:01.900> on<00:05:02.500> it

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:02.680 
to put some global illumination on it

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:07.680 
to put some global illumination on it
and<00:05:04.500> also<00:05:05.500> maybe<00:05:06.070> some<00:05:06.400> ambient<00:05:06.970> occlusion<00:05:07.240> it

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:07.690 
and also maybe some ambient occlusion it

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:11.820 
and also maybe some ambient occlusion it
doesn't<00:05:08.050> matter<00:05:08.800> if<00:05:09.100> you<00:05:09.250> got<00:05:09.750> one<00:05:10.750> object<00:05:11.560> in

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:11.830 
doesn't matter if you got one object in

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:14.940 
doesn't matter if you got one object in
the<00:05:12.400> scene<00:05:12.669> for<00:05:13.090> ambient<00:05:13.479> occlusion<00:05:13.720> but<00:05:14.350> if

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:14.950 
the scene for ambient occlusion but if

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:17.129 
the scene for ambient occlusion but if
you've<00:05:15.400> got<00:05:15.580> more<00:05:15.820> than<00:05:16.030> one<00:05:16.240> objects<00:05:16.750> that<00:05:16.990> it

00:05:17.129 --> 00:05:17.139 
you've got more than one objects that it

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:19.920 
you've got more than one objects that it
does<00:05:17.350> look<00:05:17.620> pretty<00:05:17.860> nice<00:05:18.690> ambient<00:05:19.690> occlusion

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:19.930 
does look pretty nice ambient occlusion

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:24.870 
does look pretty nice ambient occlusion
is<00:05:20.320> basically<00:05:20.830> a<00:05:20.860> shadowing<00:05:21.340> effect<00:05:23.490> so<00:05:24.490> as

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:24.880 
is basically a shadowing effect so as

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:26.250 
is basically a shadowing effect so as
you<00:05:24.940> can<00:05:25.150> see<00:05:25.360> you<00:05:25.479> got<00:05:25.660> yourself<00:05:25.750> a<00:05:26.110> nice
