00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
these team always battle I think we

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.650 
these team always battle I think we
deserved<00:02:35.580> it<00:02:35.760> especially<00:02:36.090> the<00:02:36.300> last<00:02:36.420> month

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
deserved it especially the last month

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:37.880 
deserved it especially the last month
front<00:02:36.840> half<00:02:37.020> of<00:02:37.140> the<00:02:37.200> season<00:02:37.440> we<00:02:37.620> should<00:02:37.800> have

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
front half of the season we should have

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:38.990 
front half of the season we should have
finished<00:02:37.980> off<00:02:38.220> at<00:02:38.370> Morgan<00:02:38.700> which<00:02:38.820> were<00:02:38.940> at

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
finished off at Morgan which were at

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.670 
finished off at Morgan which were at
this<00:02:39.120> point<00:02:39.390> I<00:02:39.660> think<00:02:40.200> it<00:02:40.440> shows<00:02:40.650> the

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
this point I think it shows the

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.740 
this point I think it shows the
character<00:02:40.980> that<00:02:41.250> we've<00:02:41.430> got<00:02:41.610> still<00:02:42.540> needs

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
character that we've got still needs

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:43.580 
character that we've got still needs
probably<00:02:42.870> have<00:02:43.080> one<00:02:43.200> or<00:02:43.290> two<00:02:43.380> chance

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
probably have one or two chance

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:44.690 
probably have one or two chance
themselves<00:02:44.040> and<00:02:44.160> we're<00:02:44.250> still<00:02:44.400> managed<00:02:44.610> to
