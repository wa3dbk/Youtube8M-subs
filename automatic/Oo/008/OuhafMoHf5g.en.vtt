settings<00:01:36.390> you<00:01:36.510> could<00:01:36.630> change<00:01:36.810> and<00:01:37.110> alter<00:01:37.260> the

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
settings you could change and alter the

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.440 
settings you could change and alter the
height<00:01:37.710> of<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:37.980> car<00:01:38.220> although<00:01:39.000> I<00:01:39.030> just<00:01:39.300> keep

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
height of the car although I just keep

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.970 
height of the car although I just keep
the<00:01:39.540> car<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:39.900> lowest<00:01:40.230> setting<00:01:40.350> at<00:01:40.590> all<00:01:40.710> times

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:40.980 
the car the lowest setting at all times

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:42.920 
the car the lowest setting at all times
and<00:01:41.430> in<00:01:41.790> terms<00:01:42.000> of<00:01:42.120> the<00:01:42.210> stiffness<00:01:42.480> it<00:01:42.810> just

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
and in terms of the stiffness it just

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.530 
and in terms of the stiffness it just
really<00:01:43.080> depends<00:01:43.380> what<00:01:43.530> I'm<00:01:43.620> doing<00:01:44.450> whether<00:01:45.450> or

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
really depends what I'm doing whether or

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.600 
really depends what I'm doing whether or
not<00:01:45.630> I'm<00:01:45.780> just<00:01:45.960> going<00:01:46.080> to<00:01:46.110> be<00:01:46.260> cruising<00:01:46.740> or<00:01:47.070> you

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
not I'm just going to be cruising or you

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.300 
not I'm just going to be cruising or you
know<00:01:47.730> going<00:01:48.360> on<00:01:48.480> a<00:01:48.570> road<00:01:48.720> trip<00:01:48.750> and<00:01:49.310> pretty

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
know going on a road trip and pretty

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.670 
know going on a road trip and pretty
much<00:01:50.430> at<00:01:50.580> this<00:01:50.700> point<00:01:51.030> after<00:01:51.780> I<00:01:52.020> drop<00:01:52.290> my<00:01:52.320> car<00:01:52.650> I

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
much at this point after I drop my car I

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.830 
much at this point after I drop my car I
was<00:01:52.950> looking<00:01:53.220> to<00:01:53.430> modify<00:01:53.970> something<00:01:54.180> else<00:01:54.480> and

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
was looking to modify something else and

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.380 
was looking to modify something else and
I<00:01:55.260> decided<00:01:55.890> to<00:01:56.010> paint<00:01:56.160> the<00:01:56.220> calipers<00:01:56.700> but<00:01:57.090> I

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
I decided to paint the calipers but I

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.750 
I decided to paint the calipers but I
didn't<00:01:57.930> really<00:01:58.110> like<00:01:58.260> it<00:01:58.470> too<00:01:58.650> much<00:01:58.800> it<00:01:59.550> kind

00:01:59.750 --> 00:01:59.760 
didn't really like it too much it kind

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.420 
didn't really like it too much it kind
of<00:01:59.910> helped<00:02:00.300> felt<00:02:00.690> it<00:02:01.080> had<00:02:01.320> this<00:02:01.500> ricey<00:02:02.100> feeling

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
of helped felt it had this ricey feeling

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.090 
of helped felt it had this ricey feeling
to<00:02:02.550> it<00:02:02.700> so<00:02:02.970> I<00:02:03.150> decided<00:02:04.050> to<00:02:04.140> paint<00:02:04.500> it<00:02:04.590> on<00:02:04.710> paint

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
to it so I decided to paint it on paint

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.980 
to it so I decided to paint it on paint
on<00:02:05.220> black<00:02:05.520> I<00:02:05.880> just<00:02:06.330> left<00:02:06.450> the<00:02:06.600> ones<00:02:06.780> in<00:02:06.900> the

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
on black I just left the ones in the

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.040 
on black I just left the ones in the
rear<00:02:07.200> red<00:02:07.920> because<00:02:08.490> it<00:02:08.610> just<00:02:08.760> didn't<00:02:09.090> they

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
rear red because it just didn't they

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.690 
rear red because it just didn't they
didn't<00:02:10.230> look<00:02:10.290> so<00:02:10.470> bad<00:02:10.500> the<00:02:11.250> ones<00:02:11.430> in<00:02:11.520> the<00:02:11.580> front

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
didn't look so bad the ones in the front

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.550 
didn't look so bad the ones in the front
were<00:02:11.880> a<00:02:11.940> little<00:02:12.120> too<00:02:12.330> red<00:02:12.540> for<00:02:12.780> my<00:02:12.900> taste<00:02:13.140> so<00:02:13.350> I

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
were a little too red for my taste so I

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.290 
were a little too red for my taste so I
decided<00:02:13.890> to<00:02:13.980> take<00:02:14.160> them<00:02:14.310> off<00:02:14.460> then<00:02:15.030> eventually

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
decided to take them off then eventually

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:16.940 
decided to take them off then eventually
I<00:02:15.480> saw<00:02:15.660> a<00:02:15.690> video<00:02:15.900> online<00:02:16.110> of<00:02:16.500> how<00:02:16.650> to<00:02:16.710> paint

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
I saw a video online of how to paint

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.890 
I saw a video online of how to paint
here<00:02:17.190> we<00:02:17.400> also<00:02:17.580> I<00:02:17.730> decided<00:02:18.030> to<00:02:18.120> give<00:02:18.270> it<00:02:18.390> a<00:02:18.450> go<00:02:18.630> I

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
here we also I decided to give it a go I

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.020 
here we also I decided to give it a go I
was<00:02:19.320> a<00:02:19.350> little<00:02:19.560> nervous<00:02:19.710> and<00:02:19.950> scared<00:02:20.220> because

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
was a little nervous and scared because

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.330 
was a little nervous and scared because
I'm<00:02:21.240> pretty<00:02:21.420> much<00:02:21.600> ruining<00:02:22.080> my<00:02:22.260> my<00:02:22.770> wheels<00:02:23.010> but

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
I'm pretty much ruining my my wheels but

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:24.590 
I'm pretty much ruining my my wheels but
they<00:02:23.580> actually<00:02:23.940> came<00:02:24.030> out<00:02:24.210> to<00:02:24.330> be<00:02:24.360> really

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
they actually came out to be really

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.020 
they actually came out to be really
beautiful<00:02:24.840> and<00:02:25.290> really<00:02:25.500> nice<00:02:25.680> and<00:02:25.710> it<00:02:26.580> gave<00:02:26.820> my

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
beautiful and really nice and it gave my

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.330 
beautiful and really nice and it gave my
car<00:02:27.270> that<00:02:27.480> unique<00:02:27.900> distinct<00:02:28.470> look<00:02:28.680> then<00:02:28.950> it

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
car that unique distinct look then it

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.510 
car that unique distinct look then it
set<00:02:29.580> it<00:02:29.670> apart<00:02:29.910> from<00:02:30.000> other<00:02:30.270> RSX<00:02:30.870> so<00:02:31.170> I<00:02:31.520> decided

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
set it apart from other RSX so I decided

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.190 
set it apart from other RSX so I decided
to<00:02:32.640> keep<00:02:32.820> it<00:02:33.000> at<00:02:33.180> first<00:02:33.420> the<00:02:33.780> first<00:02:33.930> thing<00:02:34.110> I

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
to keep it at first the first thing I

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.260 
to keep it at first the first thing I
did<00:02:34.260> was<00:02:34.530> you<00:02:35.160> know<00:02:35.250> try<00:02:35.490> out<00:02:35.550> the<00:02:35.790> flat<00:02:36.030> black

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
did was you know try out the flat black

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:38.120 
did was you know try out the flat black
eventually<00:02:36.810> I<00:02:36.840> tried<00:02:37.110> the<00:02:37.230> high<00:02:37.380> gloss<00:02:37.440> and

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
eventually I tried the high gloss and

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:39.850 
eventually I tried the high gloss and
then<00:02:38.580> flat<00:02:38.820> black<00:02:39.090> with<00:02:39.330> high<00:02:39.450> gloss

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
then flat black with high gloss

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.140 
then flat black with high gloss
eventually<00:02:40.860> currently<00:02:41.459> and<00:02:41.700> right<00:02:41.940> now<00:02:42.090> to

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
eventually currently and right now to

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.390 
eventually currently and right now to
this<00:02:42.390> point<00:02:42.630> their<00:02:43.140> high<00:02:43.380> gloss<00:02:43.680> and<00:02:44.160> I<00:02:44.220> like

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
this point their high gloss and I like

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.370 
this point their high gloss and I like
high<00:02:44.580> gloss<00:02:44.790> a<00:02:44.910> lot<00:02:45.120> more<00:02:45.390> a<00:02:45.630> lot<00:02:46.110> of<00:02:46.200> people

disagree with me they're like old
flapper<00:02:47.700> that<00:02:47.850> looks<00:02:48.030> better<00:02:48.180> but<00:02:48.540> you<00:02:48.660> know

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690
