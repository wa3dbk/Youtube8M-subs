 our further nation bantle and that 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:25.820
 today the german nation bundle with the 

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:28.130
 64 in Karben and P2 in 26 German 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.579
 Outfit yes, many have wished 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:33.070
 thanks again to mister long 4 

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:35.690
 your comment did it 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.790
 the m 64 I play today with the 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:40.579
 open standardization of the distance 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:43.010
 run kate max and a precision 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:45.640
 Alternatively, the eu is still coming 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.820
 take over or red dot resp 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.160
 draufpacken 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.739
 both are good and you can do both 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.140
 it's not really that far away 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:55.100
 bad, let's say it like that 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.260
 So there is only for you 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:01.850
 I have it in the gameplay is so active 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:03.859
 played by david p 26 still doing one 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.990
 very good switzerland austria until then 

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:08.270
 then here we come to the clothes that 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:11.360
 the German sausages helm the country on 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:13.700
 glasses german know tiger fight 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.260
 Packages to 41 backpack and the German 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.630
 know the belt 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:19.010
 I would simply recommend this 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.910
 to take German pack 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:24.860
 There are two because of the offered 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:29.150
 if there just look at it come to it 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:31.190
 a 64 n64 is a first hit what 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:33.440
 developed by the company heckler cook 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:37.850
 was power to remove here in game 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:41.480
 and 23 25 on the border there were to 30 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:44.360
 damage and the long range makes you 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:45.740
 but significantly less harm to the 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.480
 long man you can do the things too 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.580
 not consistently that is neff melee 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:51.230
 thought that oracle is the weapon like that 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.910
 even in the gameplay looks very much 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:54.560
 high is so you have really completely 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:56.180
 problems on the long range because one 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.760
 neat damage rauszuhauen but are 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:00.440
 the weapon was very very good had one 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.370
 reverberation time is also relatively chic 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.560
 like I think 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:05.840
 but you really have to say that 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:09.110
 the thing really unbelievably simple 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.729
 only pulls up or it pulls in all 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.260
 directions ie it has a 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:15.200
 Real wobble in it hardly you 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:17.750
 balancing is very difficult too 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.340
 controlling recall but you can do it 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.799
 difficult to balance 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.740
 I do not really enjoy it 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:25.780
 made that here 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:27.190
 really the weapon go there really 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.100
 it's hard to play 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.360
 really really on the mid range 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.620
 it can get the pretty house go 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.140
 so you can get bored with the 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:38.740
 not go though I have a Persian 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:40.030
 I just need that 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:42.070
 just is not the weapon is always 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:45.660
 very restless if you like what i recommend 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:51.640
 would serve as the name is the stock of the 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:53.740
 to reduce the recall time incredibly 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.440
 So if you wanted to do something like that 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:58.210
 the weapon is really calm eads then 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.470
 you take name please , it is then 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:01.720
 I have not released yet 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.520
 for which it means that there is only one 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:07.510
 Gamble a bit so I can get it free 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:09.610
 then I would recommend it on it 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.800
 from a chef company glock that's why 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:14.130
 German is mainly in the 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:16.980
 American space used 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:19.870
 not so in german room 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.310
 that's why your name can i was for 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.900
 work because the many 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.610
 have desired for the German and 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:28.020
 the pizza six years we have her 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:30.760
 already at the stop is just for that 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:33.190
 swiss austrian-german 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:36.910
 gun is on you as many as 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:39.810
 project school used by cooks and 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:44.890
 I do not know where this death came from 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:47.080
 I think that 's the gun walter 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:49.270
 peters it is I believe I can 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:51.790
 but do not be fooled but how little 

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:55.930
 recommend the pack to all those who like 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:57.910
 Let's go and never do something long 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:59.830
 people often los angeles i want 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:02.560
 also want to have firepower 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:04.270
 something is good for them and yes then 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.320
 let's summarize what we as 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:07.450
 we need to have the open one 

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:09.100
 standardization of systems distance up 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:11.980
 The cassette magazine in the precision 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:13.960
 creates on the plate cover as camouflage 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:15.490
 or as clothing 

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:17.260
 to know with the Germans 

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:20.410
 on the country games the books 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:21.790
 camouflage the tiger backpacks and the 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:25.980
 German knowing attacks 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:25.980
 that was the set for this week impression
