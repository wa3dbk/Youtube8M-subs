00:00:14.579 --> 00:00:18.280
 I pressed the door button and 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:18.640
 the door hits pretty hard too 

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:20.860
 made 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.200
 Now the train has gone the driver 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:27.160
 that made with intention 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:29.080
 open that pretty much out normally 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.090
 the evag drivers are everyone 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:33.100
 Close a passenger doors in the 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:34.600
 usually that works but why 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.480
 that sometimes does not work 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.620
 explained us the years from 1 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.269
 why has the in my case the 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.670
 Do not open the door though I'm on the door 

00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:45.069
 Door opener pressed if it could live 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:47.949
 turn around time at the end stops 

00:00:45.069 --> 00:00:50.890
 and sometimes it can happen 

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:51.789
 that due to the traffic situation the doors 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:53.469
 Do not listen anymore 

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:54.789
 but if the driver sees that 

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:56.019
 someone can not come running 

00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:59.109
 just wait a few minutes 

00:00:56.019 --> 00:01:00.639
 no to certain stops can the 

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:01.989
 Driver does not wait when I am at the 

00:01:00.639 --> 00:01:04.750
 stop my contact signal 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:07.150
 answers seem to be meant shortly afterwards 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:07.980
 that instructs me to do the doors 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:10.150
 lock 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:12.790
 and this signal remains only three 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:14.650
 are available within seconds would this contact 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:15.940
 miss the signal until the 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:18.180
 next round usually two to 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:20.620
 three minutes and then this would be 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.120
 build up more and more late 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:24.220
 Of course, I would also like an attachment for 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:26.050
 to ensure the other passengers 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.880
 what does the passenger see if it is 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:29.890
 It is worth pressing the door knob or not 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.780
 you can click on this door knob this 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.760
 green enlightenment is usually seen 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.980
 then the door release still inserted 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:39.220
 extinguish these green lights is the 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:40.870
 door release taken out and it's worth it 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.270
 then no longer for the passenger 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:44.770
 is lead to press when the 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.660
 Allow cooling to open from the outside or 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:49.630
 not the rule is not so with the 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:51.189
 mood of the driver but 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.619
 as soon as the departure is reached 

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:57.140
 would be nice locked also press 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:02:00.240
 So it's time to wait for the next one 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:06.110
 but at least I am sure 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:06.110
 increase time at the haltestelle
