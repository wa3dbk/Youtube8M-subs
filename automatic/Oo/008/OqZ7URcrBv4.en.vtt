00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.090
 trend in bakeries 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:35.190
 yes today is a trend is because this 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:37.290
 target audience has been growing 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:44.120
 Carlos What are the ingredients? 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:55.820
 the ingredients are chocolate gems 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:01:02.370
 egg whites and mousse sugar butter 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:04.350
 rice flour and chemical yeast in the 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.060
 first step we will take the 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.920
 chocolate to melt in the microwave 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.470
 for two minutes 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.420
 it is worth stressing that you have to 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:16.920
 chocolate all kinds of chocolate one 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:19.369
 average power after two minutes is 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.929
 the texture of our chocolate 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:24.899
 after we stopped our chocolate 

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:27.060
 Let's add to our butter and stir 

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:29.849
 well and Carlos does not need to lead to 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.819
 butter or microwave also not because 

00:01:29.849 --> 00:01:34.440
 with the chocolate's own temperature 

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:37.180
 if we take it to the microwave it will 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:39.760
 end up burning our mix 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:42.790
 now we are going to the next step that 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:44.590
 is to beat the egg whites 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:48.100
 now let's hit with a globe beater 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:50.250
 three minutes until you get the clear point 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.250
 in snow 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:04.659
 after the three minutes we will retire here 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:08.530
 Ours our clear in snow 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:10.450
 here is our point after taking the 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.950
 our whites and nevis we'll mix 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:16.840
 the dry ingredients that are our 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:22.660
 yeast 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:25.300
 our sugar our rice flour 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:27.819
 after mixing in the dry we go 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:32.500
 mix our greasy products 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:34.629
 that our gem together with ours with the 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:37.180
 our neutral alloy or and mousse 

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:39.690
 after mixing here we will take the 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:42.459
 our ingredients in the mixer 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:44.739
 in this stage we will mix our 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:47.019
 dry ingredients with the greasy ones 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:48.280
 interspersing in our clear in snow 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:50.910
 remembering that always in speed 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.910
 low 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.390
 and finally to this stage the chocolate 

00:02:56.409 --> 00:03:00.970
 last melted because the chocolate 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:02.620
 because of his temperature he does not 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:05.739
 may be at an elevated temperature 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:08.549
 so that it does not denature and our 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:08.549
 injury 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:16.720
 good this is our point of our mass 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:18.849
 and now we're going to the next 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.160
 the next step that is to take to the oven 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:25.090
 now we're going to get our dough and 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:27.370

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:32.370
