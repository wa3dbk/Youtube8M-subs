00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
material in place so that is kind of a

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:18.170 
material in place so that is kind of a
top<00:03:17.079> that's<00:03:17.470> you<00:03:17.739> know

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180

otherwise because this is gonna fill
with<00:04:29.800> water<00:04:29.950> that's<00:04:30.280> gonna<00:04:30.490> get<00:04:30.669> a<00:04:30.700> bit<00:04:30.850> heavy

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:31.060 
with water that's gonna get a bit heavy

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:34.590 
with water that's gonna get a bit heavy
you<00:04:32.020> just<00:04:32.200> really<00:04:32.590> want<00:04:32.980> it<00:04:33.070> to<00:04:33.310> act<00:04:33.490> as<00:04:33.669> a<00:04:33.730> as<00:04:34.540> a

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:34.600 
you just really want it to act as a as a

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:40.680 
you just really want it to act as a as a
funnel<00:04:35.580> to<00:04:36.580> do<00:04:38.280> and<00:04:39.280> then<00:04:39.490> to<00:04:40.180> attach<00:04:40.300> the

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:40.690 
funnel to do and then to attach the

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:43.920 
funnel to do and then to attach the
roads<00:04:40.900> I'm<00:04:41.260> just<00:04:41.470> taking<00:04:41.830> a<00:04:41.950> you<00:04:42.669> know<00:04:42.790> a<00:04:43.600> bunch

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:43.930 
roads I'm just taking a you know a bunch

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:45.810 
roads I'm just taking a you know a bunch
of<00:04:44.169> the<00:04:44.260> plastic<00:04:44.710> and<00:04:44.860> I'm<00:04:44.919> gonna<00:04:45.520> use<00:04:45.790> a

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:45.820 
of the plastic and I'm gonna use a

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:48.900 
of the plastic and I'm gonna use a
constrictor<00:04:46.480> knot<00:04:46.710> you<00:04:47.710> know<00:04:47.770> I<00:04:48.280> mean<00:04:48.580> you

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:48.910 
constrictor knot you know I mean you

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:50.730 
constrictor knot you know I mean you
could<00:04:49.120> put<00:04:49.300> like<00:04:49.480> a<00:04:49.540> button<00:04:50.110> or<00:04:50.229> something<00:04:50.620> in

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:50.740 
could put like a button or something in

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:51.930 
could put like a button or something in
there<00:04:50.919> which<00:04:51.130> would<00:04:51.280> make<00:04:51.430> it<00:04:51.550> a<00:04:51.610> bit<00:04:51.790> more

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:51.940 
there which would make it a bit more

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:55.230 
there which would make it a bit more
secure<00:04:52.360> but<00:04:53.110> yeah<00:04:53.350> I<00:04:53.590> mean<00:04:53.710> to<00:04:53.830> be<00:04:53.890> honest<00:04:54.240> you

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:55.240 
secure but yeah I mean to be honest you

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:56.580 
secure but yeah I mean to be honest you
could<00:04:55.330> probably<00:04:55.540> get<00:04:55.810> away<00:04:55.930> without<00:04:56.110> doing

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:56.590 
could probably get away without doing

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:59.250 
could probably get away without doing
that<00:04:56.620> so<00:04:57.400> it's<00:04:58.180> four<00:04:58.360> tire<00:04:58.570> constrictor<00:04:59.229> knot

00:04:59.250 --> 00:04:59.260 
that so it's four tire constrictor knot

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:06.930 
that so it's four tire constrictor knot
there<00:05:01.440> so<00:05:03.090> like<00:05:04.090> I<00:05:04.120> could<00:05:04.180> and<00:05:04.510> tight<00:05:05.490> then<00:05:06.490> I'm

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:06.940 
there so like I could and tight then I'm

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:10.580 
there so like I could and tight then I'm
just<00:05:07.060> gonna<00:05:07.210> put<00:05:07.510> it<00:05:07.570> over<00:05:07.750> home<00:05:08.080> Lube<00:05:08.850> yeah

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:10.590 
just gonna put it over home Lube yeah

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:15.390 
just gonna put it over home Lube yeah
like<00:05:11.590> so<00:05:12.240> and<00:05:13.240> I<00:05:13.330> can<00:05:13.510> use<00:05:14.200> that<00:05:14.229> to<00:05:14.650> attach<00:05:14.770> to

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:15.400 
like so and I can use that to attach to
