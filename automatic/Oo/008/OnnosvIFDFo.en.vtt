00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:03.610
 copy american 

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:05.140
 cars in the Soviet Union are not 

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:07.140
 it was shameful the first two are cheaper 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.450
 how to develop your own second 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.720
 At that time, America was dictating to the car 

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.419
 years to the whole world 

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:15.219
 101 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:17.420
 body type rear limousine drive 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:19.439
 engines of 5 point seven 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:20.779
 cubic centimeters and 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:23.509
 90 horsepower transmission 

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:25.720
 four-stage mechanical total 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.880
 8752 cars were assembled 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:34.310
 produced in the USSR from 1930 sixth to 1939 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:36.579
 the car is provided by a retro site 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:37.960
 transport cinema concern 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:38.740
 mosfilm 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:40.390
 you know when you approach him 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:42.550
 it gets scary and all the time in my head 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.570
 the question is spinning like driving it 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.660
 apparently talks about six meters 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.410
 width approximately 2 and height 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.850
 shift growth or even more 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.110
 megalomania of the beginning of the second world war 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.899
 was very popular 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:59.239
 Here the Soviet Union decided that our 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:01.409
 limousine can not be worse than foreign 

00:01:01.409 --> 00:01:04.009
 analogues it is interesting that zis 101 was not 

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:06.310
 one hundred percent specific 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:08.820
 foreign models and at the same time was not 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.799
 domestic development by request 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.170
 the factory named after Stalin and designed it 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.570
 US firm on March 1 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:18.159
 so be careful it will 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:20.270
 very powerful man 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.050
 During the Second World War 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:24.210
 I'm also the most interesting 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.630
 seedlings in the cabin place is no longer the case 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.140
 many only two people and two months 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.530
 sofas and soft wide on can still be 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.360
 legs stretched to reflect on 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.360
 problems and needs of the motherland 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.040
 yes, and overclocking is very much like to say 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.080
 impressive this process is possible 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.189
 describe the words as garey 

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:46.030
 rebounds 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.150
 slowly but inevitably 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.830
 yes and not stuck to such a machine will avoid 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.040
 must respect and fear 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.700
 for what you really are for us 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.640
 money up to smooth running and free 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.320
 the time of the seasonal diseases but 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.400
 even despite the age of speed 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.190
 switches the perfect truth with 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:05.750
 Crunch visibility of course disappoint 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:07.060
 in front of a long nose 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.860
 back endless pocket side mirrors 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.399
 naturally not the one 

00:02:11.399 --> 00:02:13.869
 but again not lordly this business head 

00:02:13.869 --> 00:02:16.059
 circles surrounding microscopic 

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:18.279
 typewriters should have just pages 

00:02:18.279 --> 00:02:20.259
 black crocodile steering wheel spinning on 

00:02:20.259 --> 00:02:20.709
 surprise 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:22.609
 not easy but surely thanks to your 

00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:24.920
 the sizes of annual turns Sechin 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.099
 undignified but not power and radius 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:29.839
 big enough more family man 

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:31.969
 here you have an amplifier true 

00:02:31.969 --> 00:02:34.149
 mechanical brakes but dungu work 

00:02:34.149 --> 00:02:36.089
 black sea left side brakes 

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:37.200
 view right 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.120
 so the car has to catch on 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.849
 road driving but to this fast 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:41.919
 you get used to 

00:02:41.919 --> 00:02:43.619
 it's worth noting that amplifiers 

00:02:43.619 --> 00:02:45.309
 civilian cars appeared 

00:02:45.309 --> 00:02:48.109
 only in the seventies therefore zis 101 

00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:50.029
 Vadim times was just super 

00:02:50.029 --> 00:02:52.169
 advanced car 

00:02:52.169 --> 00:02:54.299
 I know besides positive emotions 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:56.489
 but nothing more experienced despite 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:58.659
 what she is just great 

00:02:58.659 --> 00:02:59.829
 that's basically all
