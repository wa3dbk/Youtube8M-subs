00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
for some reason on the camera we see

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.439 
for some reason on the camera we see
that<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:28.769> headlights<00:00:29.099> of<00:00:29.369> flickering<00:00:30.119> when

that the headlights of flickering when
indeed<00:00:30.869> they're<00:00:31.170> not<00:00:31.380> so<00:00:32.099> it<00:00:32.219> must<00:00:32.430> be<00:00:32.489> the<00:00:32.899> the

blinking<00:01:36.660> now<00:01:37.660> each<00:01:38.590> state<00:01:39.100> that<00:01:39.760> you<00:01:39.880> put<00:01:40.390> the

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:40.510 
blinking now each state that you put the

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:42.420 
blinking now each state that you put the
car<00:01:40.720> in<00:01:40.960> and<00:01:41.110> will<00:01:41.200> stay<00:01:41.410> that<00:01:41.620> way<00:01:41.830> until<00:01:42.160> you

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:42.430 
car in and will stay that way until you

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:48.830 
car in and will stay that way until you

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.710 

now<00:01:49.840> it's<00:01:50.080> gone<00:01:50.230> into<00:01:50.530> automatic<00:01:51.040> mode<00:01:51.720> it

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:52.720 
now it's gone into automatic mode it

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.740 
now it's gone into automatic mode it
will<00:01:52.840> cycle<00:01:53.110> through<00:01:53.500> all<00:01:53.530> the<00:01:53.740> functions

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
will cycle through all the functions

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.990 
will cycle through all the functions
automatically<00:01:55.750> I<00:01:57.990> beams<00:01:58.990> things<00:01:59.410> like<00:01:59.590> that

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
automatically I beams things like that

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.560 
automatically I beams things like that
and<00:02:01.890> when<00:02:02.890> we<00:02:02.920> go<00:02:03.520> into<00:02:03.730> production<00:02:04.000> with<00:02:04.330> this

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
and when we go into production with this

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:08.100 
and when we go into production with this
the<00:02:04.870> time<00:02:05.650> duration<00:02:06.070> between<00:02:06.700> each<00:02:07.110> function

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
the time duration between each function

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.410 
the time duration between each function
it<00:02:08.350> will<00:02:08.619> be<00:02:08.770> longer<00:02:09.100> so<00:02:09.340> you<00:02:09.850> get<00:02:10.000> to<00:02:10.119> enjoy

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
it will be longer so you get to enjoy

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:13.830 
it will be longer so you get to enjoy
the<00:02:10.600> functionality<00:02:11.350> of<00:02:11.500> it<00:02:11.790> and<00:02:12.790> just<00:02:13.360> to<00:02:13.510> show

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
the functionality of it and just to show

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.160 
the functionality of it and just to show
you<00:02:13.900> guys<00:02:14.290> why<00:02:14.790> wait<00:02:15.790> you<00:02:16.210> know<00:02:16.300> looking<00:02:16.930> at<00:02:17.110> it

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
you guys why wait you know looking at it

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:22.290 
you guys why wait you know looking at it
cycling<00:02:17.740> through<00:02:18.870> you<00:02:19.870> can<00:02:20.080> see<00:02:20.970> we<00:02:21.970> went<00:02:22.210> with

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
cycling through you can see we went with

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.630 
cycling through you can see we went with
the<00:02:22.510> Mike<00:02:22.750> with<00:02:23.020> the<00:02:23.050> mini<00:02:23.410> 12-volt<00:02:24.040> batteries

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
the Mike with the mini 12-volt batteries

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.340 
the Mike with the mini 12-volt batteries
you<00:02:24.880> can<00:02:25.030> put<00:02:25.209> this<00:02:25.330> just<00:02:25.540> about<00:02:25.750> anywhere<00:02:26.140> I

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
you can put this just about anywhere I

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:29.640 
you can put this just about anywhere I
put<00:02:27.190> it<00:02:27.280> in<00:02:27.430> the<00:02:27.720> engine<00:02:28.720> compartment<00:02:29.020> because

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
put it in the engine compartment because

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.100 
put it in the engine compartment because
I<00:02:29.770> didn't<00:02:30.190> put<00:02:30.370> the<00:02:30.550> engine<00:02:31.090> in<00:02:31.209> it<00:02:31.360> but

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
I didn't put the engine in it but

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.110 
I didn't put the engine in it but
although<00:02:32.410> I<00:02:32.680> believe<00:02:32.980> there<00:02:33.550> was<00:02:33.670> enough<00:02:33.940> room

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
although I believe there was enough room

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.780 
although I believe there was enough room
to<00:02:34.959> actually<00:02:35.110> put<00:02:35.470> it<00:02:35.560> in<00:02:35.650> the<00:02:35.770> trunk<00:02:36.160> if<00:02:36.640> I

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
to actually put it in the trunk if I

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.760 
to actually put it in the trunk if I
wanted<00:02:37.180> to<00:02:39.209> but<00:02:40.209> depending<00:02:41.170> on<00:02:41.260> which<00:02:41.440> car<00:02:41.739> you

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:41.770 
wanted to but depending on which car you
