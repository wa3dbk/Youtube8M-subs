00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
friends too but realistically why is it

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.500 
friends too but realistically why is it
still<00:00:46.860> a<00:00:46.920> problem<00:00:47.190> why<00:00:47.579> does<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:47.940> tack<00:00:48.149> insert

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
still a problem why does the tack insert

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.900 
still a problem why does the tack insert
still<00:00:48.750> in<00:00:48.899> this<00:00:49.020> damn<00:00:49.230> game<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:50.309> texture<00:00:50.730> I

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
still in this damn game the texture I

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.549 
still in this damn game the texture I
understand<00:00:51.329> has<00:00:51.480> a<00:00:51.600> very<00:00:51.899> strong<00:00:52.260> advantage

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
understand has a very strong advantage

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:53.990 
understand has a very strong advantage
when<00:00:52.860> you're<00:00:52.949> playing<00:00:53.129> in<00:00:53.250> a<00:00:53.340> team-based<00:00:53.730> game

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
when you're playing in a team-based game

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.400 
when you're playing in a team-based game
but<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.270> fact<00:00:54.480> is<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.809> number<00:00:55.050> of<00:00:55.079> teams<00:00:55.289> that

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
but the fact is the number of teams that

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:56.959 
but the fact is the number of teams that
take<00:00:55.590> advantage<00:00:55.710> of<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.160> tack<00:00:56.309> insert<00:00:56.640> versus

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
take advantage of the tack insert versus

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.189 
take advantage of the tack insert versus
number<00:00:57.210> of<00:00:57.390> boosters<00:00:57.809> that<00:00:57.840> take<00:00:58.079> advantage

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
number of boosters that take advantage

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.880 
number of boosters that take advantage
of<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:58.620> tack<00:00:58.800> insert<00:00:59.100> is<00:01:00.140> lopsided<00:01:01.140> at<00:01:01.649> best

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
of the tack insert is lopsided at best

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.070 
of the tack insert is lopsided at best
