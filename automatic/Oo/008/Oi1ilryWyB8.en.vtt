00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.810

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:28.940
 Andermatt lightning for you and this time 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:31.310

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:36.650
 once de niro they have the glitch 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.840
 By the way also shown the first part 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:42.379
 I discovered here but in the second 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:45.620
 you have discovered and happiness again 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:47.829
 already life actually remains as 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:50.420
 First , the ball needs a vest and 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:53.420
 Ammunition box you just throw it 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:55.220
 It is not important to do so here 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.920
 is not important where you are exactly 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:59.840
 just throw something about where to go now 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.810
 I first behind and shows you the 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.850
 first part of the clip one of mine 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:07.280
 subscribers may become one 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.759
 People I am now looking forward to the 3 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.380
 was just faster behind 

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:14.869
 Now it starts immediately 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:18.020
 we can see him right away 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:19.670
 want to look at this one room and there 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.770
 we come in this room when we are 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.690
 we can get in the back later 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:26.720
 through the wall through people the whole 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:29.540
 easy and easy again the first 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.460
 try and you are under the 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.770
 maf 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:35.290
 so it looks like you just have to 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.900
 clean brush twice and then 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:39.580
 since the first rank 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:42.100
 then it could either do it yourself 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.150
 or a buddy of you made 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.880
 do it yourself 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:47.200
 I 've fallen here with a bit of it 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.420
 finally everything overflowed 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.690
 so now we are waiting for the 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.369
 sledges or on which the part of 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:57.520
 Panzer which is not finished yet and 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:02:00.490
 put our ammo box what you 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:03.910
 The beginning missionary event is best 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:05.560
 people less well he puts it down and so 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:08.259
 you can also see that her on 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.729
 Alone makes allow now quite nice 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:14.920
 pretty fast backwards 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:17.820
 fast and now you are waiting here 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:20.920
 the box there comes her behind 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:23.200
 my buddy and in the meantime me in 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.840
 he'll be happy down if we are 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:28.540
 Immediately see two behind me he had 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.300
 just seen there he is about the same 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:35.769
 he will not stand there anymore because he 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:38.230
 other map is coming now 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:40.170
 Ammunition box what about the almost 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:43.239
 finished armor is not pushing 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:45.940
 frogs and even where there has 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:49.450
 seen and too powerful again in the net 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:52.090
 recorded here was not on so now 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:55.000
 Let's wait for my buddy or better 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:57.790
 said my subscribers lived ignite buy 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.489
 list westeroder ammo box as well 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:03.070
 as I plan to start there and you 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:06.120
 Look, she is coming and you are standing 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:08.769
 at the very back of the wall at the very back 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.180
 and then you wait here until they come 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:12.459
 actually only had to be one time 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.720
 push and you're underneath 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:17.480
 you will see it soon 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:19.280
 so now i have the bang of 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.290
 except that they can see the good 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:24.470
 push so 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:27.320
 Roshan and below and it's so easy 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:29.690
 and that's a really awesome average me 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:31.120
 I have to go back to Rocky and get closer 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:33.770
 Thank you for that 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.180
 Nero is now trying to get down here as well 

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:35.750
 come or it's rock i know it 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.990
 not exactly 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:41.360
 and somehow it does not make it small 

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:44.540
 field trial but because there just a weapon 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:47.000
 puts and instead he takes the post 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:49.100
 the weapon on therefore stupid but you 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.410
 can from down there and I impose 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:54.800
 I show there a few positions that 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:56.780
 are actually very nice and it is 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:59.300
 simply a hammer flash and if you
