00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
 hello and welcome dear 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.560
 friends i am the aunt accurate 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.480
 I explain a little bit today 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.160
 what about the game rom 2 was totally 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.990
 I try to give some tips and 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.389
 today it's about the agents again 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.549
 it was already in the last part 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:17.160
 and it is also about the 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.690
 characteristics that characterize one's character 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.720
 can give that is quite a whole 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.920
 important very important ingredient 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.830
 in this game 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.359
 It 's about I'm watching now 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.869
 just the dignitaries 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:32.550
 it is with the dignitaries that the 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.860
 yes the provinces can improve but 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.850
 they all cost the same and you see 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.820
 they all have the same too 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.989
 abilities, however, and that is quite whole 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.510
 important they have different 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.370
 properties have me watching 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.230
 made aware at the very beginning 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.670
 from my cornelia campaigns and indeed 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.440
 if you click on it then look 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.489
 you broughton not even on it 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.289
 you can just go with her 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.870
 mouse over it - five executions 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:57.270
 cost civil administration +3 tax rate 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.260
 breakdown mckenzies remission +3 public 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:03.719
 order local province or class 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:05.489
 province of elazig or here for example +1 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.170
 growth per round +3 public 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.720
 order by characters pan american 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.340
 silvers +3 public places so we 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.960
 have currently parliament knows 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.900
 that would bring +3 here but the 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:19.110
 also brings so +3 or 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.960
 this other here military administration -4% 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.630
 maintenance costs civil administration +3 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.100
 tax rate -2% on construction costs so it is 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.180
 the absolute madness not with theme 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.240
 the aunt with the public order 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.579
 because i mean here i want to be here for 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.829
 to rest 

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:36.509
 yes that's the absolute madness 

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:38.400
 Look at it exactly you can only 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.380
 have a certain number how high the 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.939
 is see you always here in your asks 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.000
 in your fractions possible texts times 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:47.420
 slowly click here in the middle of it 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.829
 and then you see spies here too 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:53.939
 warrior dignitaries 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:54.680
 I give you the tip for my view 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.880
 of the things 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:02:00.360
 It is always very important as early as possible 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.850
 on these dignitaries to tecan with 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.320
 Egypt can be exceptionally the 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.969
 military technology a bit 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.070
 slow down it comes up 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.619
 the group 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.330
 for example it is and it is 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:12.680
 maybe we'll do it now 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.210
 Here this tutorial with pure with them 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.810
 there are these different ones 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:19.700
 technologies military and administration 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.740
 administration he is so for the economy 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.540
 and military is just as much as possible 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:25.700
 getting good troops quickly and that is 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.010
 of course it is natural 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.770
 important that we get good troops 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.180
 But it is also very important that we have one 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:33.890
 good administration, so we have money 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.510
 get entertained by more troops too 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.480
 can 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:42.650
 and in my opinion, it's worth it 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:45.260
 because it is relatively weak at the beginning 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.330
 especially strong on the administration too 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.190
 go because you also with the 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.620
 standard samples pretty much 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:53.630
 Can tear at the beginning 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:56.330
 That's why I like to go up at the beginning 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:59.330
 the administration and bar the first time 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:01.670
 high so the first 12 24 rounds 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.620
 because the administration brings again 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.400
 Bonnie and you see that if you 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.620
 it goes on here 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.510
 For example, if I have these three 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:11.060
 then researched technologies 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:14.840
 I -5% corruption in all provinces 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:18.620
 and that's super super important - 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:21.500
 Corruption means money everywhere 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.790
 every single region i get 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.340
 additional money 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:28.340
 that's great super super 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.299
 interesting well and now I have to 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.739
 Of course, only the others here 

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:33.290
 look at crafts and so on 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:34.940
 Of course it always pays off 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:37.280
 to select the technology tree you want 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:39.049
 also fully explored right when the 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.640
 fully explored you get hold of 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:44.780
 always direct bonus for example here 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:46.670
 +3 food is super cool or here - 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.350
 three construction costs that is not quite 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:50.540
 so cool that's why always ranked earlier 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:52.519
 back with me because you all know 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.840
 public order and food are me 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:55.700
 emphasize both the most important 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.620
 resources in this game public 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:01.100
 Regulation and food are more important 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:02.600
 not okay that's why you can start in the beginning 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:04.010
 neglect the military a bit 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.750
 this looks different if you are 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:06.860
 a campaign against each other then plays 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:07.710
 Do you have a very good balance? 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:10.140
 Find 

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:13.020
 can keep up with her and of course 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:14.610
 one must not forget either 

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:18.210
 Recruitment of a dispute 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:20.310
 that's very important for a competitor 

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:23.480
 are important if you have the contestants early 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:25.770
 in your army will then be the 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:27.210
 very good your experience points in 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:29.760
 raise the army and then you have 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:32.250
 someday or then you have relative 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:35.460
 fast elite troops so far 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:37.200
 that this basic technology can do that 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:39.950
 you can also explore parallel in parallel 

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:42.180
 and I want to scream 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:43.380
 Maybe I'll get the one later 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:45.270
 I think I 'm here at the first 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:46.710
 civilian technologies I am 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:47.820
 a little something I can do today 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:49.860
 By the way, small-scale war with the synergies 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:51.930
 and all their fellows like you 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:53.640
 See it only on the edge 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:57.570
 So it'll be good until next time 

00:04:53.640 --> 00:05:01.740
 these points I wanted to have forgotten it 

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:03.390
 I forgot let 's say her 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:05.070
 have a character of the straight up 

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:09.180
 spooned is then comes here so 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:10.380
 yellow part of the pyramid or manta 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:12.770
 something like that you go to the 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:15.540
 character details and see here 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:18.050
 he got a new craft and 

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:20.910
 that is what happens most often 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:22.260
 happens most frequently that he said he 

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:23.970
 it actually happens more often 

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.770
 that he gets more budget but it 

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:27.420
 happens very often that he is one 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:29.670
 gets extra craft and then 

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:31.260
 again ask yourself what 

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:34.640
 I need to look at this general 

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:36.720
 you the values ​​at 333 still balanced 

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:38.850
 thankfully he heightens the devotion 

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:42.960
 public order he he the 

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:45.290
 authority increases the sphere of influence and 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:47.520
 the 

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:49.410
 I should be the one again 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:51.710
 Forgotten increases the sphere of influence 

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:54.740
 for the battle and the moral of the troops 

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:57.120
 or maybe I want to lizzt those 

00:05:54.740 --> 00:06:00.510
 on additional free crafts 

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:02.340
 and increases the counterintelligence improved 

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:04.730
 under circumstances also the trade so there 

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:06.960
 There are different possibilities 

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:09.390
 I personally like to go to the 

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:12.690
 devotion to country generals and happy to 

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:14.520
 authority at see generalen but that is 

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:17.850
 his personal joke of me and 

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:19.740
 also pays attention to any case it, if 

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:21.570
 you try that as early as possible 

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:24.000
 here to get the high levels so 

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:26.850
 you need two things for the level 

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:29.310
 Four out of four, but you see here 

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:31.170
 already +2 authority gives right now 

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:34.200
 critical +1 authority but if the level 

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:35.510
 take two of them get +2 moral and 

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:39.660
 again authority point and here 

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:40.950
 public order and moral and such 

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:43.020
 it goes up and up 

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:44.400
 pay attention to these characteristics as now 

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:46.080
 from the beginning on but that is 

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:48.000
 really very important that you do that 

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:49.950
 By the way, I would keep it in mind 

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.540
 right here so that's just now 

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:53.420
 testmatch I'm at it right now 

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:56.820
 to conquer this city here 

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:58.200
 look closely at where your troops are 

00:06:56.820 --> 00:07:00.990
 if you place it on the ground 

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:03.060
 placed it's good because then you 

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:04.590
 probably not wear 

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:06.840
 but if you of course here 

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:09.360
 happens to be placed here then it looks 

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:10.800
 here content chances of success euro 15 but 

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:13.020
 I think I want to wear it too 

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:16.560
 have units wear because in the 

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:19.830
 desert is not that cool for mine 

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:21.270
 army necessarily uses this way 

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:22.560
 maybe used as a last note 

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:24.600
 these special skills like 

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:26.480
 violent march to quickly out of the 

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:29.190
 impassable terrain to come out 

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:31.380
 I use fix position if you like 

00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:33.570
 See the enemy forces 

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:35.730
 to come to you use the ambush 

00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:37.889
 if you hide in a forest area 

00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:41.009
 have and used 

00:07:37.889 --> 00:07:44.870
 plunder if you have one unit 

00:07:41.009 --> 00:07:47.430
 you pull back slowly volt and 

00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:48.689
 plunders the opponent's provinces worthwhile
