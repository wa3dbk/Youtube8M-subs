give<00:02:46.780> yourself<00:02:47.080> a<00:02:47.140> little<00:02:47.230> bit<00:02:47.440> of<00:02:47.500> a<00:02:47.650> lip<00:02:47.860> so

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.070 
give yourself a little bit of a lip so

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:49.740 
give yourself a little bit of a lip so
it's<00:02:48.220> easier<00:02:48.550> to<00:02:48.700> grab<00:02:48.880> a<00:02:48.910> hold<00:02:49.180> up<00:02:49.330> so<00:02:49.480> you<00:02:49.570> can

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
it's easier to grab a hold up so you can

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:55.590 
it's easier to grab a hold up so you can
pull<00:02:49.900> off<00:02:52.170> and<00:02:53.640> then<00:02:54.640> you<00:02:54.730> also<00:02:54.910> don't<00:02:55.300> want<00:02:55.540> to

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:55.600 
pull off and then you also don't want to

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.810 
pull off and then you also don't want to
get<00:02:55.750> too<00:02:55.930> close<00:02:56.260> to<00:02:56.560> the<00:02:56.680> eyebrows<00:02:57.040> for<00:02:57.610> guys

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:57.820 
get too close to the eyebrows for guys

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:59.280 
get too close to the eyebrows for guys
you're<00:02:58.000> just<00:02:58.240> getting<00:02:58.510> rid<00:02:58.630> of<00:02:58.750> the<00:02:58.959> stray

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
you're just getting rid of the stray

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.010 
you're just getting rid of the stray
hairs<00:02:59.590> so<00:03:00.490> you're<00:03:01.090> not<00:03:01.240> cutting<00:03:01.660> into<00:03:01.870> the

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:02.020 
hairs so you're not cutting into the

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:03.420 
hairs so you're not cutting into the
eyebrows<00:03:02.380> at<00:03:02.560> all<00:03:02.680> of<00:03:02.800> course<00:03:03.010> unless<00:03:03.160> they

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
eyebrows at all of course unless they

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.699 
eyebrows at all of course unless they
want<00:03:03.670> them<00:03:03.880> but<00:03:04.209> for<00:03:04.360> me<00:03:04.420> since<00:03:05.410> I<00:03:05.530> have<00:03:05.560> to

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
want them but for me since I have to

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:07.620 
want them but for me since I have to
look<00:03:05.830> at<00:03:06.250> him<00:03:06.850> all<00:03:06.970> the<00:03:07.090> time

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630 
look at him all the time

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:10.020 
look at him all the time
I<00:03:07.950> still<00:03:08.950> want<00:03:09.100> him<00:03:09.190> to<00:03:09.250> look<00:03:09.370> very<00:03:09.430> masculine

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
I still want him to look very masculine

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.680 
I still want him to look very masculine
and<00:03:10.420> I<00:03:10.510> do<00:03:10.570> not<00:03:10.780> need<00:03:10.959> this<00:03:11.110> eyebrow<00:03:11.290> shape<00:03:12.690> so

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
and I do not need this eyebrow shape so

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:15.540 
and I do not need this eyebrow shape so
again<00:03:13.959> you<00:03:14.410> start<00:03:14.680> out<00:03:14.830> thinning<00:03:15.220> and<00:03:15.340> at<00:03:15.459> the

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:15.550 
again you start out thinning and at the

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:16.890 
again you start out thinning and at the
end<00:03:15.760> you<00:03:15.940> make<00:03:16.090> it<00:03:16.209> a<00:03:16.269> little<00:03:16.300> bit<00:03:16.570> thicker<00:03:16.750> so

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
end you make it a little bit thicker so

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:27.090 
end you make it a little bit thicker so
you<00:03:17.110> have<00:03:17.350> an<00:03:17.470> easier<00:03:17.800> grasp

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:27.100 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:37.190 

I'm<00:03:27.640> feeling<00:03:28.090> this<00:03:28.690> is<00:03:29.140> going<00:03:29.440> to<00:03:29.710> hurt

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:04:03.510 

that<00:03:38.200> was<00:03:38.470> big

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:03.520 

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:04.890 

it's<00:04:03.970> like<00:04:04.090> you're<00:04:04.210> turning<00:04:04.510> me<00:04:04.600> into<00:04:04.720> an

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:04.900 
it's like you're turning me into an

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.460 
it's like you're turning me into an
avatar<00:04:06.240> okay<00:04:07.240> since<00:04:07.750> we<00:04:07.870> have<00:04:07.960> everything<00:04:08.320> on

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:08.470 
avatar okay since we have everything on

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:12.630 
avatar okay since we have everything on
now<00:04:10.290> it's<00:04:11.290> now<00:04:11.650> hard<00:04:11.920> enough<00:04:12.130> to<00:04:12.310> peel<00:04:12.460> off

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:12.640 
now it's now hard enough to peel off

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.850 
now it's now hard enough to peel off
since<00:04:13.270> it<00:04:13.570> is<00:04:13.690> on<00:04:13.810> the<00:04:13.900> face<00:04:14.110> I<00:04:14.350> prefer<00:04:14.650> hard

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:14.860 
since it is on the face I prefer hard

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:16.650 
since it is on the face I prefer hard
wax<00:04:15.070> you<00:04:15.310> can<00:04:15.370> use<00:04:15.610> soft<00:04:15.820> wax<00:04:16.000> if<00:04:16.150> you<00:04:16.240> like<00:04:16.420> but

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:16.660 
wax you can use soft wax if you like but

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.979 
wax you can use soft wax if you like but
this<00:04:16.960> is<00:04:17.230> much<00:04:17.980> easier<00:04:18.010> and<00:04:18.700> in<00:04:19.240> my<00:04:19.390> opinion<00:04:19.510> a

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:19.989 
this is much easier and in my opinion a

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:24.240 
this is much easier and in my opinion a
lot<00:04:21.750> just<00:04:22.750> it's<00:04:23.050> better<00:04:23.320> for<00:04:23.530> sensitive<00:04:23.950> skin

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250 
lot just it's better for sensitive skin

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:27.420 
lot just it's better for sensitive skin
and<00:04:24.460> he<00:04:25.360> definitely<00:04:25.750> has<00:04:25.870> sensitive<00:04:26.110> skin<00:04:26.430> so

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:27.430 
and he definitely has sensitive skin so

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:28.920 
and he definitely has sensitive skin so
you're<00:04:27.520> gonna<00:04:27.610> pull<00:04:27.820> it<00:04:27.910> up<00:04:28.000> make<00:04:28.720> sure<00:04:28.840> you

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:28.930 
you're gonna pull it up make sure you

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:30.330 
you're gonna pull it up make sure you
have<00:04:29.020> it<00:04:29.110> easy<00:04:29.230> grasp<00:04:29.560> pull<00:04:29.860> the<00:04:29.980> skin<00:04:30.160> tight

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:30.340 
have it easy grasp pull the skin tight

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.570 
have it easy grasp pull the skin tight
pull<00:04:31.060> it<00:04:31.150> down<00:04:31.300> and<00:04:31.830> now<00:04:32.830> comes<00:04:33.160> all<00:04:33.400> the

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:33.580 
pull it down and now comes all the

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:27.110 
eyebrows we're not actually shaping them

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:31.520 
eyebrows we're not actually shaping them
aside<00:05:28.110> from<00:05:28.260> their<00:05:28.440> own<00:05:28.590> natural<00:05:29.130> state<00:05:30.530> so

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:31.530 
aside from their own natural state so

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:33.230 
aside from their own natural state so
you<00:05:31.590> can<00:05:31.800> take<00:05:31.919> your<00:05:32.010> tweezers<00:05:32.220> and<00:05:32.699> pick<00:05:33.120> out

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:33.240 
you can take your tweezers and pick out

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:40.749 
you can take your tweezers and pick out
any<00:05:33.449> strays<00:05:33.750> that<00:05:33.780> there<00:05:34.080> are

00:05:40.749 --> 00:05:40.759 

00:05:40.759 --> 00:05:43.059 

and<00:05:41.150> he<00:05:41.479> just<00:05:41.629> has<00:05:41.779> a<00:05:41.809> few<00:05:42.080> random<00:05:42.349> once<00:05:42.710> the

00:05:43.059 --> 00:05:43.069 
and he just has a few random once the

00:05:43.069 --> 00:05:44.769 
and he just has a few random once the
wax<00:05:43.219> did<00:05:43.610> most<00:05:43.849> of<00:05:43.939> the<00:05:44.059> work<00:05:44.089> but<00:05:44.449> since<00:05:44.599> we

00:05:44.769 --> 00:05:44.779 
wax did most of the work but since we

00:05:44.779 --> 00:05:46.149 
wax did most of the work but since we
don't<00:05:44.930> want<00:05:45.050> to<00:05:45.110> get<00:05:45.199> the<00:05:45.289> wax<00:05:45.439> too<00:05:45.770> close<00:05:46.009> to

00:05:46.149 --> 00:05:46.159 
don't want to get the wax too close to

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:49.570 
don't want to get the wax too close to
the<00:05:46.279> actual<00:05:46.639> eyebrow<00:05:47.710> it's<00:05:48.710> easier<00:05:49.129> to<00:05:49.339> just

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:49.580 
the actual eyebrow it's easier to just

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:51.429 
the actual eyebrow it's easier to just
do<00:05:49.759> the<00:05:50.089> grand<00:05:50.539> scheme<00:05:50.839> of<00:05:50.870> things<00:05:50.990> with<00:05:51.319> the

00:05:51.429 --> 00:05:51.439 
do the grand scheme of things with the

00:05:51.439 --> 00:05:53.019 
do the grand scheme of things with the
wax<00:05:51.650> and<00:05:51.830> then<00:05:51.949> pull<00:05:52.159> out<00:05:52.189> the<00:05:52.309> tiny<00:05:52.610> ones<00:05:52.849> with
