00:00:08.799 --> 00:00:14.450
 Well, that does not warm the soul as the thought of 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:16.610
 the upcoming holiday you have not traveled to 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:19.849

 look for alternatives do not suffer 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:35.629
 in doubt 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:38.150
 Europe at your feet Schengen passport

 It is worth to see at least personally for later 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.820
 don't forget them never try to move in 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:45.820
 cube 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:56.180
 and so you need a Schengen tour plan 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:58.579
 and the route imagine that the route is already 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:00.410
 there is in most cases your road to 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:03.559
 Europe will pass through Belarus 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:05.420
 now you will see your voyage before 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:11.600

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:13.549
 formalities buy green card this 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.530
 compulsory travel insurance 

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:17.659
 by car in Europe 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:21.020
 minimum duration of two weeks 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:23.780
 cost of 30 euros you already have the rights 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:26.300
 international sample look like this 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.780
 about you who can go to 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.640
 europe 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.590
 very many novice cars 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.170
 travelers always ask one and that 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.679
 same question with what rights can go to 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.200
 europe 

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:38.569
 friends with such rights can go 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:41.060
 to europe is international law 

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:45.490
 I cut the sample with no such rights 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.490
 never any problems so look 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:54.840
 do your car kit 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.640

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.620
 rope and child seat 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.830
 I advise you to download the navigator 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:03.990
 updated licensed maps free 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:04.620
 the product can lead you to such poses 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.650
 and trails 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:09.300
 and maybe it is a glitch cosiness license 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:11.730
 program harmin me for example yet 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.770
 never failed with good 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.930
 navigation and no problem will arrive in 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:18.900
 destination from Russia to the west 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:21.390
 leads the European corridor e30 he 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.250
 laid long ago and stuck if some 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.660
 the program sends you from Russia to 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.570
 Europe through Grodno 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.380
 this is not the most reasonable way to remember 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:32.600
 the best 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:34.620
 and direct road to Europe E30 m1 highway 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:37.110
 allowed speed on most 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.420
 plots 120 kilometers per hour not 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:42.570
 exceed more than 10 kilometers 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:45.270
 hr track m1 tightly studded with cameras and 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:47.430
 they really work especially 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:49.860
 be careful on the approach to brest 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.990
 besides canner stand here regularly 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.000
 traffic cops also work fines not 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:56.130
 small speeding over 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.630
 twenty kilometers per hour facilitates 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:02.610
 wallet for $ 35 by the way in Belarus 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:03.090
 radar detectors allowed to reach 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.820
 brest 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:08.100
 attention soon boundaries near the press then 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:11.070
 There are two check points Warsaw bridge 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:13.340
 and at home before the border we refuel 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:16.040
 up to full more such cheap 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:18.030
 petroleum products you will not find anywhere else 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.780
 refuel at green stations 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.959
 Belarusneft 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.200
 here we have the best qualities of fuel 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:26.770
 left 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:29.200
 all morning and 10 already in brest would move 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:31.180
 west towards europe if you 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.580
 nothing stops belarus it in 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:36.300
 principle here from Minsk so sharply pass 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.300
 launch 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:43.150
 Before Brest look at the HPC site . 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:44.650
 state you will have a bike 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:47.140
 approximate idea of 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:48.480
 queues look at home what or 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:51.489
 warsaw bridge 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:53.560
 decided by the way will soon open more 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:57.489
 one checkpoint is big and 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:59.019
 modern when and where i will inform you in 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:01.360
 car travel is only 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:01.959
 one inevitable parking intersection 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:04.150
 boundaries 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:05.920
 heading to europe get ready 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:08.140
 stand for a few hours 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:10.030
 local population is limited leads 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:12.040
 active commercial activity and 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:14.140
 travel plans aborigines in 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.900
 the calculation do not take the border better 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:20.290
 arrive in the afternoon and preferably not 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:22.840
 friday saturday or sunday this 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:25.210
 days on the border sold-out situation among 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.550
 weeks is quite normal intersection 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:30.520
 boundaries of the procedure is inevitable and to this 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:33.220
 need to be ready to stand a little 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:37.680
 but then nothing will stop you 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:37.680
 no further barriers 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:43.710
 so you safely left the former 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:46.139
 Soviet homeland try now 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:48.389
 forget or quality in europe rule 

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:50.759
 it is better not to break 

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:52.949
 wind their own finances every kind of control 

00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:54.569
 Speed ​​works regularly catches 

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:55.620
 violators of the most diverse 

00:04:54.569 --> 00:04:58.169
 in ways 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:01.349
 especially in the settlements there 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:03.210
 allowed 50 kilometers per hour remember 

00:05:01.349 --> 00:05:07.080
 and at least how much can do 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:10.220
 over fast riding 100 dollars when you 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:14.250
 driving by the most important thing is that you should 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:17.460
 turn on the low beam and here it is no longer 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:22.650
 always go off and dipped in 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:26.870
 Poland does not include fog much as possible 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:26.870
 include just another fine 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:37.500
 Here they are expensive in Poland quite a and 

00:05:35.069 --> 00:05:39.569
 nothing in Poland much has changed friends 

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:41.669
 highways and speedways appeared 

00:05:39.569 --> 00:05:44.310
 free road the farther you will be 

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:46.590
 advance into capitalism so much the better and 

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:49.289
 roadbed and views outside the window and 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:52.740
 service but prices will change 

00:05:49.289 --> 00:05:54.949
 Poland is a humane country with all this 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:54.949
 to use 

00:05:56.270 --> 00:06:01.680
 many more beautiful roads and wonderful 

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:04.740
 places that you can visit pack 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:07.350
 want details about this next 

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:10.550
 series is better to see once than half a year 

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:12.390
 rummaging through the net you get your 

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:15.590
 autotravel plug 

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:15.590
 see you later
