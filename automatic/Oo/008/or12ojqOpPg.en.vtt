00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580 
hi this is sy Porter with figure drawing

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.950 
hi this is sy Porter with figure drawing
tips<00:00:06.540> and<00:00:06.870> tutorials<00:00:07.940> so<00:00:08.940> let's<00:00:09.570> go<00:00:09.690> ahead<00:00:09.719> and

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
tips and tutorials so let's go ahead and

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.499 
tips and tutorials so let's go ahead and
start<00:00:10.260> drawing<00:00:10.469> a<00:00:10.650> figure<00:00:10.830> here<00:00:11.400> i'm<00:00:12.269> going<00:00:12.420> to

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
start drawing a figure here i'm going to

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.169 
start drawing a figure here i'm going to
start<00:00:12.780> not<00:00:13.320> with<00:00:13.349> posed<00:00:13.920> figures<00:00:14.309> but<00:00:14.880> just

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
start not with posed figures but just

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.880 
start not with posed figures but just
standing<00:00:15.990> figure<00:00:16.379> so<00:00:16.710> i<00:00:17.130> can<00:00:17.789> demonstrate

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:18.890 
standing figure so i can demonstrate

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:23.570 
standing figure so i can demonstrate
some<00:00:19.890> of<00:00:20.039> the<00:00:20.449> basic<00:00:22.580> proportional

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
some of the basic proportional

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.550 
some of the basic proportional
measurements<00:00:24.359> and<00:00:25.010> we<00:00:26.010> covered<00:00:27.410> working<00:00:28.410> up

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
measurements and we covered working up

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.330 
measurements and we covered working up
the<00:00:29.720> lower<00:00:30.720> half<00:00:31.019> of<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.320> figure<00:00:31.830> and<00:00:32.040> another

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
the lower half of the figure and another

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:43.760 
the lower half of the figure and another
one<00:00:32.640> here<00:00:33.980> okay<00:00:34.980> and<00:00:37.190> so<00:00:39.530> here's<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:42.770> chest

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
one here okay and so here's the chest

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:49.590 
one here okay and so here's the chest
barrel

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:49.600 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:55.770 

ok<00:00:50.879> so<00:00:51.879> i<00:00:53.190> covered<00:00:54.190> the<00:00:54.519> shoulders<00:00:55.449> a<00:00:55.480> little

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:55.780 
ok so i covered the shoulders a little

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:02.189 
ok so i covered the shoulders a little
bit<00:00:56.140> the<00:00:56.739> way<00:00:56.920> they're<00:00:57.579> very<00:00:58.019> movable<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.930> top

00:01:02.189 --> 00:01:02.199 
bit the way they're very movable the top

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:06.180 
bit the way they're very movable the top
arc<00:01:02.589> of<00:01:02.829> the<00:01:02.859> chest<00:01:03.280> barrel<00:01:04.180> is<00:01:04.950> more<00:01:05.950> of<00:01:06.100> a

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:06.190 
arc of the chest barrel is more of a

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:12.539 
arc of the chest barrel is more of a
constant<00:01:06.909> and<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:11.140> shoulders<00:01:11.710> I'm<00:01:12.430> just

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:12.549 
constant and the shoulders I'm just

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:14.029 
constant and the shoulders I'm just
going<00:01:12.729> to<00:01:12.759> throw<00:01:12.850> them<00:01:13.149> back<00:01:13.330> a<00:01:13.360> little<00:01:13.630> bit

00:01:14.029 --> 00:01:14.039 
going to throw them back a little bit

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:17.719 
going to throw them back a little bit
i'm<00:01:15.039> going<00:01:15.220> to<00:01:15.280> have<00:01:15.460> them<00:01:15.759> they're<00:01:16.060> rotating

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
i'm going to have them they're rotating

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:23.279 
i'm going to have them they're rotating
not<00:01:18.729> rotating<00:01:19.390> they're<00:01:19.710> following<00:01:20.710> the<00:01:22.289> arc

00:01:23.279 --> 00:01:23.289 
not rotating they're following the arc

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:25.649 
not rotating they're following the arc
back<00:01:23.679> behind<00:01:24.009> the<00:01:24.550> chest<00:01:24.880> barrel<00:01:25.330> a<00:01:25.600> little

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:25.659 
back behind the chest barrel a little

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:33.210 
back behind the chest barrel a little
bit<00:01:28.890> or<00:01:29.890> it<00:01:30.250> could<00:01:30.399> be<00:01:30.429> a<00:01:30.960> female<00:01:31.960> figure<00:01:32.440> you

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:33.220 
bit or it could be a female figure you

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.109 
bit or it could be a female figure you
know<00:01:34.080> shoulders<00:01:35.080> are<00:01:35.369> smaller<00:01:36.369> than<00:01:36.759> a<00:01:36.819> male

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:37.119 
know shoulders are smaller than a male

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:41.550 
know shoulders are smaller than a male
figure<00:01:37.990> and<00:01:39.539> okay<00:01:40.539> so<00:01:40.600> you<00:01:40.810> have<00:01:41.020> your<00:01:41.080> chest

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
figure and okay so you have your chest

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.779 
figure and okay so you have your chest
barrel<00:01:42.009> here<00:01:42.429> and<00:01:43.470> like<00:01:44.470> with<00:01:45.220> your<00:01:45.399> elbow

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:56.229 
elbow in and just see how it rests a

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:00.319 
elbow in and just see how it rests a
little<00:01:56.500> bit<00:01:56.680> below<00:01:57.219> the<00:01:57.850> ribs<00:01:58.180> here<00:01:59.189> so

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
little bit below the ribs here so

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.149 
little bit below the ribs here so
that'll<00:02:01.329> be<00:02:01.450> the<00:02:01.600> length<00:02:01.810> of<00:02:02.079> this<00:02:02.289> arm<00:02:02.590> here

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:03.159 
that'll be the length of this arm here

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:14.759 
that'll be the length of this arm here
and<00:02:04.469> the<00:02:05.469> i<00:02:06.689> call<00:02:07.689> it<00:02:07.719> the<00:02:07.840> lower<00:02:08.170> arm<00:02:12.390> the<00:02:13.769> this

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:14.769 
and the i call it the lower arm the this

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:16.770 
and the i call it the lower arm the this
disarm<00:02:15.459> this<00:02:15.790> length<00:02:16.090> right<00:02:16.209> here<00:02:16.390> is<00:02:16.750> a

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
disarm this length right here is a

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.229 
disarm this length right here is a
little<00:02:17.019> bit<00:02:17.230> shorter<00:02:17.709> from<00:02:18.519> the<00:02:18.640> anchor<00:02:19.000> point

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
little bit shorter from the anchor point

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:22.680 
little bit shorter from the anchor point
here<00:02:19.930> to<00:02:20.290> here<00:02:21.030> deltoids<00:02:22.030> always<00:02:22.359> kind<00:02:22.600> of

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
here to here deltoids always kind of

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.949 
here to here deltoids always kind of
ride<00:02:22.900> more<00:02:23.200> on<00:02:23.350> top<00:02:23.650> of<00:02:23.709> where<00:02:24.450> the<00:02:25.450> arm<00:02:25.690> is

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
ride more on top of where the arm is

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:32.460 
ride more on top of where the arm is
anchored<00:02:27.660> to<00:02:28.660> its<00:02:29.140> point<00:02:29.829> of<00:02:30.100> of<00:02:31.380> you<00:02:32.380> know

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
anchored to its point of of you know

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.140 
anchored to its point of of you know
here's<00:02:32.769> the<00:02:32.920> clavicle<00:02:33.459> here<00:02:34.380> collarbones

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
here's the clavicle here collarbones

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.210 
here's the clavicle here collarbones
think<00:02:37.150> of<00:02:37.269> them<00:02:37.390> as<00:02:37.450> little<00:02:37.930> arms<00:02:38.530> connected

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
think of them as little arms connected

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.150 
think of them as little arms connected
to<00:02:39.370> the<00:02:39.459> clavicle<00:02:40.120> so<00:02:40.660> the<00:02:40.959> anchor<00:02:41.230> point<00:02:41.470> here

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
to the clavicle so the anchor point here

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.559 
to the clavicle so the anchor point here
rides<00:02:43.260> wherever<00:02:44.260> these<00:02:44.790> collarbones<00:02:45.790> move<00:02:46.239> so

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:46.569 
rides wherever these collarbones move so

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:48.210 
rides wherever these collarbones move so
if<00:02:46.660> the<00:02:46.750> color<00:02:46.959> bones<00:02:47.290> move<00:02:47.590> up<00:02:47.769> here<00:02:47.950> this

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
if the color bones move up here this

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:51.979 
if the color bones move up here this
anchor<00:02:48.670> point<00:02:48.940> for<00:02:49.060> the<00:02:49.239> arm<00:02:49.590> moves<00:02:50.590> with<00:02:50.890> it

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
anchor point for the arm moves with it

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:57.810 
anchor point for the arm moves with it
so<00:02:53.160> here's<00:02:54.160> the<00:02:54.340> elbow<00:02:54.730> out<00:02:54.940> here<00:02:55.450> and<00:02:56.820> you

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:57.820 
so here's the elbow out here and you

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:01.820 
so here's the elbow out here and you
know<00:02:57.940> hands<00:02:59.280> when<00:03:00.280> I<00:03:00.370> start<00:03:00.669> out

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
know hands when I start out

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:05.350 
know hands when I start out
I<00:03:01.940> really<00:03:03.050> try<00:03:04.050> not<00:03:04.260> to<00:03:04.410> be<00:03:04.530> too<00:03:04.560> concerned

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 
I really try not to be too concerned

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:10.010 
I really try not to be too concerned
good<00:03:06.360> example<00:03:06.810> the<00:03:07.530> hands<00:03:08.130> I<00:03:08.370> don't<00:03:08.820> I<00:03:09.120> start

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:10.020 
good example the hands I don't I start

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:13.390 
good example the hands I don't I start
out<00:03:10.200> with<00:03:10.320> just<00:03:10.380> a<00:03:10.650> very<00:03:10.950> you<00:03:11.460> know<00:03:11.520> blob<00:03:12.030> shape

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
out with just a very you know blob shape

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.430 
out with just a very you know blob shape
can<00:03:14.400> always<00:03:14.730> you<00:03:15.420> know<00:03:15.540> think<00:03:16.020> a<00:03:16.140> little<00:03:16.260> bit

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
can always you know think a little bit

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:22.430 
can always you know think a little bit
more<00:03:16.650> about<00:03:16.710> how<00:03:20.150> how<00:03:21.150> that<00:03:21.660> will<00:03:21.810> take<00:03:22.050> shape

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
more about how how that will take shape

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:27.710 
more about how how that will take shape
is<00:03:22.710> it<00:03:22.740> as<00:03:23.670> it<00:03:24.510> goes<00:03:25.370> alone<00:03:26.370> and<00:03:27.300> you<00:03:27.390> can<00:03:27.540> see

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
is it as it goes alone and you can see

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.780 
is it as it goes alone and you can see
the<00:03:27.840> length<00:03:28.110> here<00:03:28.500> I'll<00:03:29.130> show<00:03:29.190> you<00:03:29.430> how<00:03:29.610> all

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
the length here I'll show you how all

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.720 
the length here I'll show you how all
these<00:03:29.940> lengths<00:03:30.300> are<00:03:30.420> going<00:03:30.540> to<00:03:30.600> change<00:03:31.730> this

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
these lengths are going to change this

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.150 
these lengths are going to change this
arm<00:03:33.000> is<00:03:33.060> receding<00:03:33.510> in<00:03:33.780> space<00:03:34.140> so<00:03:34.590> for<00:03:35.040> this

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
arm is receding in space so for this

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.640 
arm is receding in space so for this
point<00:03:36.150> at<00:03:36.420> this<00:03:36.450> point<00:03:36.720> I<00:03:37.140> make<00:03:37.320> it<00:03:37.470> much

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
point at this point I make it much

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.390 
point at this point I make it much
shorter<00:03:38.220> than<00:03:38.640> it<00:03:38.670> is<00:03:39.030> here<00:03:39.060> and<00:03:40.010> but<00:03:41.010> this

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
shorter than it is here and but this

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.500 
shorter than it is here and but this
this<00:03:42.060> here<00:03:43.520> okay<00:03:44.520> here's<00:03:44.880> your<00:03:45.060> I<00:03:45.090> we're

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
this here okay here's your I we're

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:46.880 
this here okay here's your I we're
looking<00:03:45.780> at<00:03:45.900> it<00:03:45.990> from<00:03:46.080> the<00:03:46.230> side<00:03:46.410> think<00:03:46.740> of<00:03:46.830> it

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
looking at it from the side think of it

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:50.330 
looking at it from the side think of it
as<00:03:46.980> a<00:03:47.010> camera<00:03:47.850> okay<00:03:48.560> when<00:03:49.560> you<00:03:49.680> have<00:03:49.890> a<00:03:49.920> length

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
as a camera okay when you have a length

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:55.210 
as a camera okay when you have a length
that<00:03:50.760> would<00:03:51.390> be<00:03:51.600> you<00:03:52.050> know<00:03:52.200> an<00:03:52.500> arm<00:03:52.800> length

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:57.890 

perpendicular<00:03:56.220> to<00:03:57.030> the<00:03:57.120> camera<00:03:57.600> it's<00:03:57.750> going

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
perpendicular to the camera it's going

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.110 
perpendicular to the camera it's going
to<00:03:57.959> stay<00:03:58.230> the<00:03:58.380> same<00:03:58.620> length<00:03:58.980> but<00:03:59.250> when<00:03:59.640> it<00:03:59.820> goes

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
to stay the same length but when it goes

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:05.000 
to stay the same length but when it goes
back<00:04:00.720> in<00:04:01.050> space<00:04:01.650> it<00:04:01.950> gets<00:04:02.340> shorter<00:04:03.470> so<00:04:04.470> and

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 
back in space it gets shorter so and

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.280 
back in space it gets shorter so and
then<00:04:05.580> and<00:04:05.850> when<00:04:05.970> it<00:04:06.090> goes<00:04:06.269> forward<00:04:06.660> in<00:04:06.930> space

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
then and when it goes forward in space

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.790 
then and when it goes forward in space
it<00:04:07.560> gets<00:04:07.769> short<00:04:08.100> it<00:04:08.430> gets<00:04:08.700> shorter<00:04:09.180> see<00:04:09.450> this

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:09.800 
it gets short it gets shorter see this

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:15.400 
it gets short it gets shorter see this
see<00:04:10.800> this<00:04:10.980> curve<00:04:11.430> here<00:04:12.410> so<00:04:13.410> this<00:04:14.160> here<00:04:14.519> is<00:04:14.640> a

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:15.410 
see this curve here so this here is a

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:19.909 
see this curve here so this here is a
perpendicular<00:04:17.269> to<00:04:18.269> the<00:04:18.390> view<00:04:18.750> so<00:04:19.350> it<00:04:19.590> stays

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 
perpendicular to the view so it stays

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:23.180 
perpendicular to the view so it stays
roughly<00:04:20.989> the<00:04:21.989> same<00:04:22.230> length<00:04:22.590> and<00:04:22.860> this<00:04:22.980> is<00:04:23.160> a

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
roughly the same length and this is a

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.840 
roughly the same length and this is a
little<00:04:23.520> shorter<00:04:23.910> because<00:04:24.060> it's<00:04:24.300> a<00:04:24.390> little<00:04:24.720> bit

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:25.850 
little shorter because it's a little bit

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:35.780 
little shorter because it's a little bit
at<00:04:26.850> angle<00:04:27.919> to<00:04:28.919> the<00:04:29.070> view<00:04:30.650> so<00:04:34.130> and<00:04:35.130> I<00:04:35.280> discussed

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:35.790 
at angle to the view so and I discussed

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:39.590 
at angle to the view so and I discussed
the<00:04:36.000> neck<00:04:36.240> before<00:04:36.600> and<00:04:37.430> the<00:04:38.430> central<00:04:38.820> axis<00:04:39.570> of

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 
the neck before and the central axis of

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.320 
the neck before and the central axis of
the<00:04:40.560> head<00:04:40.830> now<00:04:41.100> once<00:04:41.310> I<00:04:41.460> the<00:04:41.910> head<00:04:42.150> I'll

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330 
the head now once I the head I'll

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.090 
the head now once I the head I'll
probably<00:04:42.540> end<00:04:42.780> up<00:04:42.900> spending<00:04:43.169> as<00:04:43.440> much<00:04:43.470> time<00:04:43.680> on

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:44.100 
probably end up spending as much time on

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:46.969 
probably end up spending as much time on
the<00:04:44.400> head<00:04:44.640> as<00:04:44.940> I<00:04:45.510> do<00:04:45.660> the<00:04:45.960> rest<00:04:46.200> of<00:04:46.380> the<00:04:46.500> body<00:04:46.710> if

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:46.979 
the head as I do the rest of the body if

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:50.420 
the head as I do the rest of the body if
not<00:04:47.190> more<00:04:47.840> if<00:04:48.840> I<00:04:49.020> if<00:04:49.350> I<00:04:49.500> continue<00:04:50.100> to<00:04:50.190> make

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.430 
not more if I if I continue to make

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:52.670 
not more if I if I continue to make
these<00:04:50.700> it'll<00:04:51.150> probably<00:04:51.390> all<00:04:51.690> be<00:04:51.990> about<00:04:52.260> face

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:52.680 
these it'll probably all be about face

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:57.110 
these it'll probably all be about face
and<00:04:53.070> expression<00:04:53.850> and<00:04:54.300> and<00:04:55.490> skull<00:04:56.490> structure

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.120 
and expression and and skull structure

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.590 
and expression and and skull structure
and<00:04:58.100> it<00:04:59.100> just<00:04:59.370> happens<00:04:59.820> to<00:04:59.970> be<00:05:00.000> the<00:05:00.210> part<00:05:00.479> of

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:00.600 
and it just happens to be the part of

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.920 
and it just happens to be the part of
the<00:05:00.690> body<00:05:00.870> I<00:05:01.020> focus<00:05:01.650> on<00:05:01.830> a<00:05:02.190> lot<00:05:03.060> more<00:05:03.419> than<00:05:03.750> the

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:03.930 
the body I focus on a lot more than the

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:07.070 
the body I focus on a lot more than the
rest<00:05:04.140> of<00:05:04.350> it<00:05:04.530> there's<00:05:05.310> a<00:05:05.400> lot<00:05:05.700> there<00:05:06.080> it's

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.080 
rest of it there's a lot there it's

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.740 
rest of it there's a lot there it's
actually<00:05:07.500> the<00:05:08.040> one<00:05:08.250> part<00:05:08.610> where<00:05:08.880> it's<00:05:09.090> handy

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:09.750 
actually the one part where it's handy

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:12.700 
actually the one part where it's handy
to<00:05:09.780> know<00:05:09.930> a<00:05:10.140> lot<00:05:10.410> of<00:05:10.440> muscles<00:05:11.010> and<00:05:11.340> stuff

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:12.710 
to know a lot of muscles and stuff

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:19.540 
to know a lot of muscles and stuff
so<00:05:14.890> you<00:05:15.890> know<00:05:16.040> these<00:05:16.580> feet<00:05:17.000> here<00:05:17.860> here<00:05:18.860> is<00:05:19.160> this

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:19.550 
so you know these feet here here is this

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:24.540 
so you know these feet here here is this
is<00:05:19.760> a<00:05:19.790> basic<00:05:20.920> mapping<00:05:21.920> out<00:05:22.070> a<00:05:22.280> basic<00:05:22.760> figure

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:24.550 
is a basic mapping out a basic figure

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:28.810 
is a basic mapping out a basic figure
just<00:05:25.550> a<00:05:25.670> standing<00:05:26.120> position<00:05:26.270> and<00:05:27.640> the<00:05:28.640> reason

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:28.820 
just a standing position and the reason

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:33.160 
just a standing position and the reason
I'm<00:05:29.030> making<00:05:29.180> these<00:05:30.340> tutorials<00:05:31.340> is<00:05:31.940> I<00:05:32.390> really

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:33.170 
I'm making these tutorials is I really

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:36.910 
I'm making these tutorials is I really
would<00:05:33.770> like<00:05:33.980> to<00:05:34.220> bring<00:05:35.150> traffic<00:05:35.540> to<00:05:35.920> the

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:36.920 
would like to bring traffic to the

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:40.530 
would like to bring traffic to the
website<00:05:36.950> that<00:05:37.580> features<00:05:37.610> my<00:05:38.300> animation<00:05:39.100> work

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:40.540 
website that features my animation work

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:46.030 
website that features my animation work
so<00:05:43.510> I'm<00:05:44.510> a<00:05:44.570> little<00:05:44.870> like<00:05:45.020> channel<00:05:45.470> nine<00:05:45.710> but

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:46.040 
so I'm a little like channel nine but

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:49.840 
so I'm a little like channel nine but
I'm<00:05:46.160> not<00:05:46.460> asking<00:05:47.210> for<00:05:47.480> money<00:05:48.220> I'll<00:05:49.220> take<00:05:49.550> it<00:05:49.730> if

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:49.850 
I'm not asking for money I'll take it if

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:54.490 
I'm not asking for money I'll take it if
you<00:05:49.970> give<00:05:50.120> it<00:05:50.270> to<00:05:50.300> me<00:05:50.480> but<00:05:51.020> uh<00:05:53.200> what<00:05:54.200> I<00:05:54.230> would

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:54.500 
you give it to me but uh what I would

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:58.300 
you give it to me but uh what I would
