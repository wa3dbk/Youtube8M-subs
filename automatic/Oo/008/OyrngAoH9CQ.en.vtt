thermostat we first need to hold our
finger<00:00:37.050> down<00:00:37.200> let's<00:00:37.410> set<00:00:37.559> button<00:00:37.770> for<00:00:38.010> five

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
finger down let's set button for five

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.260 
finger down let's set button for five
seconds<00:00:40.430> the<00:00:41.430> first<00:00:41.579> setting<00:00:41.969> is<00:00:42.090> for<00:00:42.120> the

actual temperature in the tank we can

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.069 
actual temperature in the tank we can
move<00:00:44.879> this<00:00:45.000> up<00:00:45.149> or<00:00:45.329> down<00:00:45.510> with<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.690> arrows

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
move this up or down with the arrows

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.430 
move this up or down with the arrows
I've<00:00:46.950> set<00:00:47.219> it<00:00:47.340> at<00:00:47.430> 30<00:00:47.719> next<00:00:48.719> is<00:00:48.899> our<00:00:49.020> night<00:00:49.200> time

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
I've set it at 30 next is our night time

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.200 
I've set it at 30 next is our night time
temperature<00:00:52.250> and<00:00:53.250> next<00:00:53.579> is<00:00:53.699> our<00:00:53.850> temperature

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
temperature and next is our temperature

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.420 
temperature and next is our temperature
divergence<00:00:54.870> this<00:00:55.469> is<00:00:55.620> how<00:00:55.770> far<00:00:56.010> we<00:00:56.190> want<00:00:56.370> the

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
divergence this is how far we want the

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.220 
divergence this is how far we want the
temperature<00:00:56.610> to<00:00:56.820> go<00:00:56.879> up<00:00:57.120> or<00:00:57.270> down<00:00:57.300> to<00:00:58.140> the

it at 3 degrees and the temps at 30 it

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.450 
it at 3 degrees and the temps at 30 it
will<00:01:03.600> go<00:01:03.719> off<00:01:03.870> at<00:01:04.019> 33<00:01:04.559> and<00:01:04.710> then<00:01:05.070> back<00:01:05.250> on<00:01:05.430> again

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
will go off at 33 and then back on again

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.679 
will go off at 33 and then back on again

number<00:01:12.510> two<00:01:12.840> I've<00:01:13.590> set<00:01:13.860> it<00:01:13.890> for<00:01:14.070> 7:00<00:01:14.369> on<00:01:14.520> and

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
number two I've set it for 7:00 on and

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.330 
number two I've set it for 7:00 on and
now<00:01:16.020> I'm<00:01:16.110> setting<00:01:16.470> it<00:01:16.590> for<00:01:16.770> seven<00:01:16.830> o'clock<00:01:17.159> at

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
now I'm setting it for seven o'clock at

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.630 
now I'm setting it for seven o'clock at
night<00:01:17.490> for<00:01:17.729> off<00:01:18.680> you<00:01:19.680> can<00:01:19.830> set<00:01:20.040> two<00:01:20.220> separate

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
night for off you can set two separate

light settings for morning tonight

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.810 
light settings for morning tonight
pretty<00:01:22.470> pointless<00:01:22.890> so<00:01:23.130> I<00:01:23.159> leave<00:01:23.400> that<00:01:23.430> setting

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
pretty pointless so I leave that setting

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:24.730 
pretty pointless so I leave that setting
at<00:01:24.000> zero

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
at zero

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.210

now<00:01:32.770> let's<00:01:33.009> set<00:01:33.130> our<00:01:33.280> daytime<00:01:33.700> range<00:01:34.030> so<00:01:34.869> from

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:35.079 
now let's set our daytime range so from

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:36.929 
now let's set our daytime range so from
7:00<00:01:35.380> in<00:01:35.439> the<00:01:35.499> morning<00:01:35.710> till<00:01:36.490> 9:00<00:01:36.729> at<00:01:36.880> night

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:36.939

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:39.029 
7:00 in the morning till 9:00 at night
the<00:01:37.630> temperature<00:01:38.049> will<00:01:38.170> go<00:01:38.200> to<00:01:38.350> 30<00:01:38.619> degrees

00:01:39.029 --> 00:01:39.039 
the temperature will go to 30 degrees

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:41.910 
the temperature will go to 30 degrees
and<00:01:39.280> then<00:01:40.149> automatically<00:01:40.929> from<00:01:41.289> 9<00:01:41.469> o'clock<00:01:41.770> at

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 
and then automatically from 9 o'clock at

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.919 
and then automatically from 9 o'clock at
night<00:01:41.950> will<00:01:42.460> then<00:01:42.609> drop<00:01:42.789> down<00:01:42.850> to<00:01:43.149> 24<00:01:43.600> degrees

00:01:45.919 --> 00:01:45.929 

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:48.179 

our<00:01:46.929> line<00:01:47.140> will<00:01:47.289> go<00:01:47.439> on<00:01:47.560> at<00:01:47.649> one<00:01:47.799> extra<00:01:48.100> degree

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:48.189 
our line will go on at one extra degree

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:51.569 
our line will go on at one extra degree
so<00:01:49.060> if<00:01:49.450> it<00:01:49.600> reaches<00:01:49.959> 26<00:01:50.409> or<00:01:50.619> below<00:01:50.859> or<00:01:51.039> go<00:01:51.189> on<00:01:51.369> or

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:51.579 
so if it reaches 26 or below or go on or

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:54.690 
so if it reaches 26 or below or go on or
34<00:01:52.359> above<00:01:52.659> we<00:01:53.590> can<00:01:53.619> have<00:01:53.829> the<00:01:53.950> alarm<00:01:54.219> on<00:01:54.369> or<00:01:54.549> off

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
34 above we can have the alarm on or off
