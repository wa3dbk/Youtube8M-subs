sewing<00:00:50.719> needle<00:00:51.079> to<00:00:51.440> poke<00:00:51.680> into<00:00:51.890> the<00:00:52.070> cone<00:00:52.309> and

00:00:52.599 --> 00:00:52.609 
sewing needle to poke into the cone and

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:54.700 
sewing needle to poke into the cone and
then<00:00:52.910> pull<00:00:53.210> the<00:00:53.359> dent<00:00:53.570> out<00:00:53.750> it's<00:00:54.320> a<00:00:54.379> good<00:00:54.559> way

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:54.710 
then pull the dent out it's a good way

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:56.349 
then pull the dent out it's a good way
to<00:00:54.769> go<00:00:55.010> if<00:00:55.160> you<00:00:55.280> have<00:00:55.370> multiple<00:00:55.879> dents<00:00:56.210> because

00:00:56.349 --> 00:00:56.359 
to go if you have multiple dents because

00:00:56.359 --> 00:00:57.790 
to go if you have multiple dents because
you<00:00:56.510> can<00:00:56.660> kind<00:00:56.870> of<00:00:56.930> address<00:00:57.170> them<00:00:57.469> all<00:00:57.620> with

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:57.800 
you can kind of address them all with

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.130 
you can kind of address them all with
one<00:00:58.039> little<00:00:58.190> point<00:00:58.519> of<00:00:58.609> entry<00:00:58.879> the<00:00:59.629> bad<00:00:59.870> news

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.140 
one little point of entry the bad news

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:01.419 
one little point of entry the bad news
is<00:01:00.320> that<00:01:00.440> you've<00:01:00.620> got<00:01:00.829> a<00:01:00.859> hole<00:01:01.129> in<00:01:01.340> your

00:01:01.419 --> 00:01:01.429 
is that you've got a hole in your

00:01:01.429 --> 00:01:03.729 
is that you've got a hole in your
speaker<00:01:01.879> now<00:01:02.030> and<00:01:02.359> possibly<00:01:03.230> more<00:01:03.469> if<00:01:03.620> you're

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:03.739 
speaker now and possibly more if you're

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:06.010 
speaker now and possibly more if you're
not<00:01:03.890> careful<00:01:04.299> sonically<00:01:05.299> a<00:01:05.390> few<00:01:05.630> holes<00:01:05.869> in

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.020 
not careful sonically a few holes in

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:07.149 
not careful sonically a few holes in
your<00:01:06.080> dust<00:01:06.320> cap<00:01:06.560> really<00:01:06.860> aren't<00:01:06.979> going<00:01:07.100> to

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:07.159 
your dust cap really aren't going to

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:08.950 
your dust cap really aren't going to
make<00:01:07.280> a<00:01:07.310> difference<00:01:07.759> but<00:01:08.420> it<00:01:08.570> doesn't<00:01:08.869> look

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:08.960 
make a difference but it doesn't look

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.899 
make a difference but it doesn't look
that<00:01:08.990> great<00:01:09.320> so<00:01:10.130> here's<00:01:10.369> my<00:01:10.520> favorite

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:10.909 
that great so here's my favorite

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:12.100 
that great so here's my favorite
technique<00:01:11.270> and<00:01:11.450> I've<00:01:11.540> used<00:01:11.720> this<00:01:11.869> one<00:01:12.049> a

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
technique and I've used this one a

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.649 
technique and I've used this one a
couple<00:01:12.200> times<00:01:12.680> with<00:01:12.920> great<00:01:13.130> results<00:01:13.700> you<00:01:14.450> take

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:14.659 
couple times with great results you take

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:17.289 
couple times with great results you take
a<00:01:14.689> q-tip<00:01:15.070> chop<00:01:16.070> off<00:01:16.280> the<00:01:16.430> top<00:01:16.460> of<00:01:16.759> it<00:01:16.880> Midway<00:01:17.090> so

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:17.299 
a q-tip chop off the top of it Midway so

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:19.359 
a q-tip chop off the top of it Midway so
that<00:01:17.659> it's<00:01:17.780> nice<00:01:17.930> and<00:01:17.960> flat<00:01:18.170> then<00:01:18.829> apply<00:01:19.100> a<00:01:19.130> few

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:19.369 
that it's nice and flat then apply a few

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:21.429 
that it's nice and flat then apply a few
dabs<00:01:19.579> of<00:01:19.790> super<00:01:20.090> glue<00:01:20.240> to<00:01:20.270> the<00:01:20.540> tip<00:01:20.750> let<00:01:21.320> it

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:21.439 
dabs of super glue to the tip let it

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:23.410 
dabs of super glue to the tip let it
soak<00:01:21.619> in<00:01:21.829> for<00:01:21.860> a<00:01:22.070> few<00:01:22.250> seconds<00:01:22.729> and<00:01:22.850> hold<00:01:23.150> it<00:01:23.299> on

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
soak in for a few seconds and hold it on

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.240 
soak in for a few seconds and hold it on
the<00:01:23.630> dent<00:01:23.869> until<00:01:24.259> it<00:01:24.350> can<00:01:24.470> stand<00:01:24.710> up<00:01:24.920> without

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250 
the dent until it can stand up without

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.490 
the dent until it can stand up without
your<00:01:25.430> help<00:01:25.750> now<00:01:26.750> you<00:01:26.840> want<00:01:26.990> the<00:01:27.110> glue<00:01:27.229> to<00:01:27.380> be

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
your help now you want the glue to be

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.350 
your help now you want the glue to be
dry<00:01:27.770> enough<00:01:28.040> to<00:01:28.100> withstand<00:01:28.340> a<00:01:28.640> good<00:01:28.820> tug<00:01:29.090> but

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 
dry enough to withstand a good tug but

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.359 
dry enough to withstand a good tug but
