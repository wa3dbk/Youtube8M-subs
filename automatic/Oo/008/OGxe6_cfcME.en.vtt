00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580 
to be doing a quick tutorial on the

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.309 
to be doing a quick tutorial on the
inversion<00:00:06.000> method<00:00:06.420> I<00:00:06.720> mentioned<00:00:07.080> in<00:00:07.170> my<00:00:07.200> last

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
inversion method I mentioned in my last

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.669 
inversion method I mentioned in my last
video<00:00:07.830> that<00:00:08.639> I<00:00:08.730> wanted<00:00:09.000> to<00:00:09.059> see<00:00:09.389> how<00:00:10.349> long<00:00:10.410> my

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
video that I wanted to see how long my

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.759 
video that I wanted to see how long my
hair<00:00:10.889> would<00:00:11.370> grow<00:00:11.750> within<00:00:12.750> a<00:00:12.900> week<00:00:13.139> during<00:00:13.590> the

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
hair would grow within a week during the

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.029 
hair would grow within a week during the
inversion<00:00:14.370> method<00:00:14.750> so<00:00:15.750> what<00:00:16.320> I<00:00:16.350> decided<00:00:16.710> to<00:00:16.830> do

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
inversion method so what I decided to do

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.450 
inversion method so what I decided to do
because<00:00:17.250> I<00:00:17.490> don't<00:00:17.550> have<00:00:17.850> like<00:00:18.029> an<00:00:18.150> actual

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:19.460 
because I don't have like an actual

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.099 
because I don't have like an actual
shirt<00:00:20.460> that<00:00:20.670> has<00:00:20.820> like<00:00:21.029> the<00:00:21.060> lines<00:00:21.480> on<00:00:21.750> it<00:00:21.900> for

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
shirt that has like the lines on it for

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.080 
shirt that has like the lines on it for
the<00:00:22.260> inches<00:00:22.560> of<00:00:22.680> hair<00:00:22.890> I<00:00:22.920> decided<00:00:23.580> to<00:00:23.789> use<00:00:23.939> a

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
the inches of hair I decided to use a

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.730 
the inches of hair I decided to use a
structure<00:00:24.660> because<00:00:25.050> I'm<00:00:25.140> like<00:00:25.289> that's<00:00:25.470> a<00:00:25.619> good

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
structure because I'm like that's a good

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:26.330 
structure because I'm like that's a good
idea

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340

longest part of my hair to kind of see

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.260 
longest part of my hair to kind of see
where<00:00:39.809> it<00:00:39.899> is<00:00:39.930> now<00:00:40.440> and<00:00:40.860> then<00:00:41.100> seven<00:00:41.879> days<00:00:42.030> from

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
where it is now and then seven days from

where it is now and then seven days from
today<00:00:42.480> I'm<00:00:42.899> going<00:00:43.110> to<00:00:43.170> measure<00:00:43.320> it<00:00:43.559> to<00:00:43.680> see<00:00:43.710> how

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
today I'm going to measure it to see how

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.279 
today I'm going to measure it to see how
many<00:00:44.340> inches<00:00:44.489> I<00:00:44.760> get<00:00:45.030> if<00:00:45.210> I<00:00:45.360> get<00:00:45.420> any<00:00:45.780> on<00:00:46.079> the

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
many inches I get if I get any on the

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.060 
many inches I get if I get any on the
version<00:00:47.039> method<00:00:47.670> it's<00:00:48.360> kind<00:00:48.809> of<00:00:48.930> crazy<00:00:49.710> when<00:00:50.010> I

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
version method it's kind of crazy when I

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.430 
version method it's kind of crazy when I
see<00:00:50.129> no<00:00:50.399> use<00:00:50.640> whoo<00:00:50.789> I'm<00:00:50.910> like<00:00:51.059> okay<00:00:51.510> like<00:00:51.809> this

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
see no use whoo I'm like okay like this

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.799 
see no use whoo I'm like okay like this
is<00:00:52.530> crazy<00:00:52.739> but<00:00:53.100> a<00:00:53.489> lot<00:00:53.640> of<00:00:53.670> people<00:00:53.760> had<00:00:54.539> great

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
is crazy but a lot of people had great

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.799 
is crazy but a lot of people had great
results<00:00:55.350> from<00:00:55.500> it<00:00:55.710> so<00:00:55.980> I<00:00:56.670> guess<00:00:57.239> it's<00:00:57.449> worth<00:00:57.600> to

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
results from it so I guess it's worth to

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.860 
results from it so I guess it's worth to
try<00:00:58.070> only<00:00:59.070> thing<00:00:59.250> that<00:00:59.370> you<00:00:59.489> need<00:00:59.670> is<00:00:59.730> oil<00:01:00.449> the

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
try only thing that you need is oil the

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.810 
try only thing that you need is oil the
best<00:01:01.079> one<00:01:01.289> that<00:01:01.440> they<00:01:01.559> say<00:01:01.800> to<00:01:01.829> use<00:01:02.219> is<00:01:02.520> out<00:01:02.789> of

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
best one that they say to use is out of

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.390 
best one that they say to use is out of

everyone's gonna see okay so I'm going
to<00:02:11.580> take<00:02:11.760> this<00:02:12.000> side<00:02:12.270> because<00:02:12.750> I<00:02:12.810> think<00:02:12.870> this

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
to take this side because I think this

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.199 
to take this side because I think this
side<00:02:13.410> is<00:02:14.130> the<00:02:14.970> longest<00:02:15.420> side<00:02:15.600> I<00:02:16.400> mean<00:02:17.400> they're

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
side is the longest side I mean they're

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.300 
side is the longest side I mean they're
both<00:02:18.360> pretty<00:02:18.630> much<00:02:18.870> even<00:02:19.350> and<00:02:19.590> I'm<00:02:19.770> gonna<00:02:19.950> I'm

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
both pretty much even and I'm gonna I'm

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.010 
both pretty much even and I'm gonna I'm
gonna<00:02:20.370> put<00:02:20.610> this<00:02:20.700> same<00:02:20.970> exact<00:02:21.390> shirt<00:02:21.569> back<00:02:21.810> on

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
gonna put this same exact shirt back on

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:27.100 
gonna put this same exact shirt back on
just<00:02:22.620> to<00:02:22.800> see<00:02:23.010> exactly<00:02:23.220> where<00:02:24.770> my<00:02:25.770> length<00:02:26.100> is

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
just to see exactly where my length is

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.610 
just to see exactly where my length is
so<00:02:28.110> it's<00:02:29.100> right<00:02:29.489> a<00:02:29.819> little<00:02:30.330> bit<00:02:30.989> I<00:02:31.290> would<00:02:31.410> say

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
so it's right a little bit I would say

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:37.300 
so it's right a little bit I would say
below<00:02:32.690> this<00:02:33.690> mine<00:02:34.610> so<00:02:35.610> if<00:02:36.120> everyone<00:02:36.720> can<00:02:36.870> see

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
below this mine so if everyone can see

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.699 
below this mine so if everyone can see
so<00:02:38.310> from<00:02:38.519> my<00:02:38.670> shoulder<00:02:39.269> we're<00:02:39.810> counting<00:02:40.320> one

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
so from my shoulder we're counting one

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:48.380 
so from my shoulder we're counting one
two<00:02:42.769> three<00:02:43.910> four<00:02:45.410> five<00:02:46.640> stripes<00:02:47.640> down<00:02:47.940> and

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
two three four five stripes down and

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.990 
two three four five stripes down and
it's<00:02:48.930> on<00:02:49.140> the<00:02:49.290> line<00:02:49.530> almost<00:02:50.070> touching<00:02:50.820> this

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
it's on the line almost touching this

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.920 
it's on the line almost touching this
one<00:02:51.060> so<00:02:52.100> that's<00:02:53.100> that<00:02:53.430> and<00:02:53.790> then<00:02:54.150> I'll<00:02:54.660> just<00:02:54.840> do

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:13.700 
instead of going seven days I kind of

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:24.940 
this video to get the result and I'm so
excited<00:04:22.580> to<00:04:22.970> say<00:04:23.270> that<00:04:23.300> the<00:04:24.139> inversion<00:04:24.530> method

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:24.950 
excited to say that the inversion method

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:29.290 
excited to say that the inversion method
definitely<00:04:25.850> works<00:04:26.620> so<00:04:27.620> I<00:04:28.190> don't<00:04:28.700> want<00:04:28.820> to<00:04:28.910> let

definitely works so I don't want to let
you<00:04:29.419> guys<00:04:29.510> know<00:04:29.900> that<00:04:29.930> with<00:04:30.680> the<00:04:30.800> inversion

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:31.220 
you guys know that with the inversion

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:33.640 
you guys know that with the inversion
method<00:04:31.340> you're<00:04:31.970> supposed<00:04:32.300> to<00:04:32.360> get<00:04:32.570> what<00:04:33.500> an

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:33.650 
method you're supposed to get what an

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:38.590 
method you're supposed to get what an
inch<00:04:33.919> of<00:04:34.490> growth<00:04:34.910> and<00:04:36.160> you<00:04:37.160> don't<00:04:37.760> you<00:04:38.419> don't

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:38.600

want<00:04:38.720> to<00:04:38.780> overdo<00:04:39.229> with<00:04:39.260> the<00:04:39.500> process<00:04:39.979> so<00:04:40.430> they

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:40.790 
want to overdo with the process so they

things a try

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.129 
things a try
at<00:04:55.639> least<00:04:55.850> one<00:04:56.000> time<00:04:56.210> for<00:04:56.360> myself<00:04:56.750> and<00:04:56.900> I'm<00:04:56.960> so

at least one time for myself and I'm so

00:04:57.139 --> 00:04:58.420 
at least one time for myself and I'm so
glad<00:04:57.290> that<00:04:57.380> I<00:04:57.530> did<00:04:57.740> this<00:04:57.770> but<00:04:57.950> I<00:04:58.130> thought<00:04:58.280> it's

00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:58.430 
glad that I did this but I thought it's

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:00.610 
glad that I did this but I thought it's
kind<00:04:58.610> of<00:04:58.669> silly<00:04:58.880> but<00:04:59.180> it<00:04:59.690> actually<00:05:00.080> works<00:05:00.229> so

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:00.620 
kind of silly but it actually works so

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:04.450 
kind of silly but it actually works so
in<00:05:01.460> the<00:05:01.550> previous<00:05:01.729> video<00:05:02.290> my<00:05:03.290> idea<00:05:03.770> I<00:05:04.070> put<00:05:04.370> back

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:04.460 
in the previous video my idea I put back

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:07.180 
in the previous video my idea I put back
on<00:05:04.610> the<00:05:04.669> same<00:05:04.820> shirt<00:05:05.090> and<00:05:05.300> I<00:05:06.260> count<00:05:06.950> it<00:05:07.040> down

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:07.190 
on the same shirt and I count it down

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:09.100 
on the same shirt and I count it down
five<00:05:07.639> strikes<00:05:08.060> for<00:05:08.300> my<00:05:08.419> shoulder<00:05:08.810> so<00:05:08.960> there's

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:09.110 
five strikes for my shoulder so there's

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:13.990 
five strikes for my shoulder so there's
one<00:05:09.350> two<00:05:09.950> three<00:05:10.389> four<00:05:11.800> five<00:05:12.800> this<00:05:13.190> is<00:05:13.880> the

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:14.000 
one two three four five this is the

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.909 
one two three four five this is the
fifth<00:05:14.300> strike<00:05:14.600> and<00:05:14.930> then<00:05:15.110> I'm<00:05:15.200> gonna<00:05:15.350> go<00:05:15.530> over

00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:15.919 
fifth strike and then I'm gonna go over

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:17.230 
fifth strike and then I'm gonna go over
here<00:05:16.100> because<00:05:16.310> this<00:05:16.760> would<00:05:16.880> be<00:05:16.910> the<00:05:17.030> fifth

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:17.240 
here because this would be the fifth

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:19.450 
here because this would be the fifth
strike<00:05:17.539> and<00:05:17.810> then<00:05:18.320> it<00:05:18.530> was<00:05:18.680> just<00:05:19.130> touching

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:19.460 
strike and then it was just touching

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:21.820 
strike and then it was just touching
this<00:05:20.000> line<00:05:20.360> like<00:05:20.570> barely<00:05:21.050> touching<00:05:21.410> this<00:05:21.560> line

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:21.830 
this line like barely touching this line

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:25.420 
this line like barely touching this line
when<00:05:22.820> I<00:05:22.850> did<00:05:23.240> it<00:05:23.389> previously<00:05:23.630> a<00:05:24.289> week<00:05:24.530> ago<00:05:24.770> so

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:25.430 
when I did it previously a week ago so

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:27.400 
when I did it previously a week ago so
let<00:05:25.940> me<00:05:26.060> show<00:05:26.389> you<00:05:26.419> guys<00:05:26.539> under<00:05:26.900> straining

let me show you guys under straining

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:30.610 
let me show you guys under straining

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:37.400 
length difference and look it's better

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:43.779 
length difference and look it's better
being<00:05:37.789> right<00:05:38.270> along<00:05:38.690> the<00:05:38.840> line<00:05:42.250> it<00:05:43.250> was<00:05:43.460> at<00:05:43.669> the

00:05:43.779 --> 00:05:43.789 
being right along the line it was at the

00:05:43.789 --> 00:05:45.810 
being right along the line it was at the
top<00:05:44.060> of<00:05:44.090> this<00:05:44.450> line

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:45.820 
top of this line

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:49.240 
top of this line
mostly<00:05:46.820> it<00:05:47.780> was<00:05:47.960> at<00:05:48.169> the<00:05:48.289> top<00:05:48.590> of<00:05:48.620> this<00:05:48.919> Laura

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:49.250 
mostly it was at the top of this Laura

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:52.810 
mostly it was at the top of this Laura
guys<00:05:49.550> like<00:05:49.940> right<00:05:50.240> here<00:05:50.780> and<00:05:51.530> so<00:05:52.460> I've

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:52.820 
guys like right here and so I've

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:54.550 
guys like right here and so I've
definitely<00:05:53.090> got<00:05:53.419> another<00:05:53.660> about<00:05:54.200> inch

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:54.560 
definitely got another about inch

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:58.900 
definitely got another about inch
because<00:05:55.030> now<00:05:56.030> it<00:05:56.650> surpassed<00:05:57.650> the<00:05:58.220> line<00:05:58.460> that<00:05:58.789> I

00:05:58.900 --> 00:05:58.910 
because now it surpassed the line that I

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:02.320 
because now it surpassed the line that I
was<00:05:59.060> on<00:05:59.470> and<00:06:00.470> it's<00:06:00.830> almost<00:06:01.160> down<00:06:01.490> to<00:06:01.820> a<00:06:01.940> whole

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:02.330 
was on and it's almost down to a whole

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:04.029 
was on and it's almost down to a whole
nother<00:06:02.539> life<00:06:02.750> so<00:06:03.050> that's<00:06:03.229> definitely<00:06:03.500> an<00:06:03.830> inch

00:06:04.029 --> 00:06:04.039 
nother life so that's definitely an inch

00:06:04.039 --> 00:06:04.600 
nother life so that's definitely an inch
of

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:04.610 
of

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:07.659 
of
growth<00:06:04.970> and<00:06:05.539> so<00:06:06.080> I'm<00:06:06.349> so<00:06:06.500> excited<00:06:06.530> about<00:06:07.129> that

00:06:07.659 --> 00:06:07.669 
growth and so I'm so excited about that

00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:11.020 
growth and so I'm so excited about that
and<00:06:07.810> I'm<00:06:08.810> going<00:06:09.229> to<00:06:09.379> definitely<00:06:10.310> continue<00:06:10.580> to
