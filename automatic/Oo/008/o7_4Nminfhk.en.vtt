 even myself at the party 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.530
 here is goliath it's just a bastard and me 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.840
 seems like one of the best arcade games i 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:13.200
 skated very high very beautifully 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.030
 ok but at the same time 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.980
 but it is very cool for me 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:19.349
 better crust park and all now when the stage 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.250

 sickening me don't usually rock me but 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:52.950
 after some rocker I needed 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:55.870
 small respite to recover 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:57.790
 wallaby we were struck by the lack of tourists 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.480
 It feels like this park is Dutch 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:03.230
 hid purely for themselves 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.230
 [music] 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:09.430
 we are only an amusement park 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.739
 extra charge one of these 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:13.599
 skydiver we ventured to visit three 

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:15.400
 the bravest of us have attached a friend 

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:17.229
 friend and raised high in the air above 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.150
 the swamp of our field of vision was no longer 

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:21.340
 just the park seems the whole neighborhood a 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:23.440
 then we just let down, we 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:25.479
 surged mad speed with clear 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.930
 feeling that the cable broke and we all 

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:28.090
 will die 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:29.620
 if it weren't for Rusik’s laughter , I’m probably gone 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:31.720
 would daze further we just 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:33.400
 rocked side to side and although it 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.560
 it was very high and we all this time 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.810
 just came to their senses after the fall 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:39.789
 this is a very cool feeling unreal 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:41.620
 adrenaline rush fortunately I didn't see 

00:04:39.789 --> 00:04:43.780
 how would anyone jump for me otherwise 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:45.250
 just did not fall off to do it but 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:47.050
 just been on such an open 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:49.210
 I still have a thing 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:51.479
 whose 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:51.479
 here 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:56.570
 now i'm ready to cover with a parachute to me 

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:58.670
 it seems already all and no attraction 

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:02.120
 I won't scare them like this park 

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:10.100
 this one but it was worth it it was very 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:15.950
 cool just guys at work here 

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:18.410
 think a bit with the onset of darkness 

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:21.050
 the park is inhabited by a variety of monsters and 

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:23.420
 known kill horror films they 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:25.310
 quietly sneak up looking right in 

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:28.690
 eyes and if I feel fear in you 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:28.690
 keep chasing 

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:32.049
 [music] 

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:37.990
 the park is divided into thematic zones and 

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:38.560
 most of all I remember the zone game 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:40.690
 ower 

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:43.330
 where the dead heroes of the game were walking 

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:46.810
 Mario from other games 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:46.810

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:05.860
 sugar shards beautiful but not scary 

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:07.780
