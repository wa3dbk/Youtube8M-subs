00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:35.750 
salt at this point because salt helps to

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:38.350 
salt at this point because salt helps to
cook<00:04:36.020> the<00:04:36.260> onions<00:04:36.710> in<00:04:36.890> Tomatoes<00:04:37.370> faster<00:04:38.090> than

their<00:04:38.600> actual<00:04:38.780> cooking<00:04:39.200> time<00:04:39.530> so<00:04:40.220> I'm<00:04:40.340> going

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:40.520 
their actual cooking time so I'm going

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:42.640

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:42.650 
to let it cook for another 1 minute and

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:49.330 
to let it cook for another 1 minute and
I'm<00:04:42.740> going<00:04:42.950> to<00:04:43.010> cover<00:04:43.280> it<00:04:47.620> so<00:04:48.620> I<00:04:48.650> am<00:04:49.040> going<00:04:49.220> to

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:49.340 
I'm going to cover it so I am going to

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:51.310 
I'm going to cover it so I am going to
cover<00:04:49.580> it<00:04:49.850> with<00:04:50.030> the<00:04:50.150> lid<00:04:50.180> for<00:04:50.630> another<00:04:50.960> 1

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:51.320 
cover it with the lid for another 1

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:58.470 
cover it with the lid for another 1
minute<00:04:51.350> and<00:04:52.310> I'm<00:04:52.730> going<00:04:52.910> to<00:04:53.060> check<00:04:53.270> it<00:04:53.450> again

00:04:58.470 --> 00:04:58.480 

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:01.480 

so<00:04:59.480> you<00:04:59.540> can<00:04:59.780> see<00:04:59.960> after<00:05:00.140> one<00:05:00.530> minute<00:05:00.830> the<00:05:01.190> food

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:01.490 
so you can see after one minute the food

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:04.090 
so you can see after one minute the food
starts<00:05:01.940> leaving<00:05:02.150> the<00:05:02.540> oil<00:05:02.840> so<00:05:03.620> that<00:05:03.650> means

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:04.100 
starts leaving the oil so that means

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:06.910 
starts leaving the oil so that means
it's<00:05:04.250> starting<00:05:04.670> cooking<00:05:05.330> so<00:05:05.870> at<00:05:06.080> this<00:05:06.290> point<00:05:06.590> I

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:50.680 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:54.480 

so<00:05:51.680> after<00:05:52.039> five<00:05:52.280> minutes<00:05:52.400> you<00:05:52.909> can<00:05:53.120> see<00:05:53.360> that

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:54.490 
so after five minutes you can see that

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:57.640 
so after five minutes you can see that
the<00:05:55.490> gravy<00:05:55.759> has<00:05:55.879> started<00:05:56.060> leaving<00:05:56.689> some<00:05:57.110> oil

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:57.650 
the gravy has started leaving some oil

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:00.820 
the gravy has started leaving some oil
and<00:05:58.060> the<00:05:59.060> water<00:05:59.360> content<00:05:59.750> has<00:06:00.199> increased

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:00.830 
and the water content has increased

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:02.709 
and the water content has increased
little<00:06:01.280> bit<00:06:01.460> because<00:06:01.669> it<00:06:02.090> leaves<00:06:02.360> a<00:06:02.539> lot<00:06:02.689> of

00:06:02.709 --> 00:06:02.719 
little bit because it leaves a lot of

00:06:02.719 --> 00:06:06.010 
little bit because it leaves a lot of
water<00:06:03.110> from<00:06:03.469> the<00:06:03.889> tomatoes<00:06:04.819> so<00:06:05.090> you<00:06:05.419> can<00:06:05.689> mash

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:06.020 
water from the tomatoes so you can mash

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:10.300 
water from the tomatoes so you can mash
this<00:06:06.379> gravy<00:06:06.889> at<00:06:07.189> this<00:06:07.430> point<00:06:08.740> not<00:06:09.740> too<00:06:10.069> much

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:10.310 
this gravy at this point not too much

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:12.999 
this gravy at this point not too much
but<00:06:10.610> slightly<00:06:10.969> so<00:06:11.870> that<00:06:12.139> all<00:06:12.349> the<00:06:12.530> tomatoes

00:06:12.999 --> 00:06:13.009 
but slightly so that all the tomatoes

00:06:13.009 --> 00:06:16.330 
but slightly so that all the tomatoes
are<00:06:13.219> nicely<00:06:13.490> mashed<00:06:14.120> thick<00:06:14.960> and<00:06:15.289> all<00:06:16.099> the

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:16.340 
are nicely mashed thick and all the

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:18.459 
are nicely mashed thick and all the
taste<00:06:16.610> of<00:06:16.849> the<00:06:17.030> tomatoes<00:06:17.539> and<00:06:17.569> the<00:06:17.960> mushrooms

00:06:18.459 --> 00:06:18.469 
taste of the tomatoes and the mushrooms

00:06:18.469 --> 00:06:21.520 
taste of the tomatoes and the mushrooms
are<00:06:18.710> inside<00:06:19.280> the<00:06:19.550> gravy<00:06:19.909> and<00:06:20.330> it<00:06:20.780> becomes<00:06:21.199> more

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:21.530 
are inside the gravy and it becomes more

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:25.990 
are inside the gravy and it becomes more
thick<00:06:22.210> so<00:06:23.210> at<00:06:23.870> this<00:06:24.830> point<00:06:25.159> I'm<00:06:25.490> just<00:06:25.520> going<00:06:25.849> to

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:26.000 
thick so at this point I'm just going to

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:33.749 
thick so at this point I'm just going to
add<00:06:26.210> 1/2<00:06:26.960> cup<00:06:26.990> of<00:06:27.439> water<00:06:29.949> just<00:06:30.949> 1/2<00:06:31.219> cup<00:06:31.580> and

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:37.750 
salt since I have already added the 1/2

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:41.260 
salt since I have already added the 1/2
tablespoon<00:06:38.750> of<00:06:38.990> salt<00:06:39.409> at<00:06:39.770> starting<00:06:40.580> so<00:06:41.180> I'm

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:41.270 
tablespoon of salt at starting so I'm

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:43.600

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:43.610 
going to add only little bit you can

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:50.879 
going to add only little bit you can
adjust<00:06:44.060> as<00:06:44.270> per<00:06:44.569> your<00:06:44.750> taste<00:06:44.779> and<00:06:46.210> mix<00:06:47.210> it<00:06:49.300> and
