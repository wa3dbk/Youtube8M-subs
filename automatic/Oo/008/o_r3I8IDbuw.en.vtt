exercise and its really good for you at
the<00:01:02.100> time<00:01:02.309> but<00:01:02.789> it's<00:01:03.149> hard<00:01:03.329> to<00:01:03.480> believe<00:01:03.570> that

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
the time but it's hard to believe that

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.390 
the time but it's hard to believe that
because<00:01:03.989> you're<00:01:04.199> actually<00:01:04.350> in<00:01:04.589> pain<00:01:04.860> so<00:01:05.159> you
