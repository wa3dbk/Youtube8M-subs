for the kill

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.120 
for the kill
I<00:02:25.750> thought<00:02:26.080> I<00:02:26.110> had<00:02:26.260> thirty<00:02:26.440> seconds<00:02:26.860> left<00:02:27.010> I

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
I thought I had thirty seconds left I

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:28.500 
I thought I had thirty seconds left I
should<00:02:27.340> have<00:02:27.430> had<00:02:27.550> thirty<00:02:27.790> seconds<00:02:28.150> left<00:02:28.360> but

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
should have had thirty seconds left but

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:29.640 
should have had thirty seconds left but
since<00:02:28.750> he<00:02:28.810> was<00:02:28.930> going<00:02:29.170> towards<00:02:29.410> the<00:02:29.500> end<00:02:29.620> of

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
since he was going towards the end of

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.890 
since he was going towards the end of
the<00:02:29.740> day<00:02:29.920> they<00:02:30.459> actually<00:02:30.760> cut<00:02:31.030> the<00:02:31.180> round<00:02:31.360> down

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
the day they actually cut the round down

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.140 
the day they actually cut the round down
to<00:02:31.959> 90<00:02:32.530> seconds<00:02:32.950> which<00:02:33.100> was<00:02:33.280> unfortunate<00:02:33.940> for

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
to 90 seconds which was unfortunate for

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.120
