00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.230
 about doctor oscar navarrete I will explain what is the revascularization 

00:00:05.229 --> 00:00:06.710
 points 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:10.410
 is an endodontic treatment for girls that boys who are between 7 and 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:11.490
 15 years old 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.519
 and that they are in the stage of the seen dentition 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.020
 that are giving teeth and that their permanent sevens are in the stage of 

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:19.029
 maturation 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:23.460
 is a new concept that applies the advances of tissue engineering to the 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.099
 regeneration of the complex occupies dentin 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.539
 Many cases have been reported where the capacity of the centers is demonstrated 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:31.840
 immature permanent infected 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.260
 to regenerate your own tissue blame 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.260
 allowing you to continue your development towards maturity 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.480
 traditionally when an immature tooth infected is sacrificed 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.920
 development of their countries and the goal of their treatment of the created a kind 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.380
 calcified barrier 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:51.770
 against which the conduits could be dreamed this treatment is known 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.650
 as apex implication with calcium hydroxide whose disadvantage is the 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.290
 extension of the procedure over time plus the roots remain 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:01.570
 weakened by not being able to develop 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:02.800
 nor its length 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.180
 nor its thickness 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.810
 more recently the apec supplication has been made common with addition of you 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:10.000
 mineral oxide 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.270
 or in it 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.290
 which consists in the instrumentation of the ducts of the immature tooth and 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.910
 its immediate obturation with in etea this of course shortens the time 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:23.570
 of treatment but still leaving the problem of the six bodyguards and 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:25.660
 weakened 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:29.180
 starting from the cases of abuse in of good without mature if these are 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:34.000
 Sensual inserts violated in the shortest possible time you can check that the 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.170
 revascularization blame favors the development of the length of the roots 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.710
 along with the thickening of its century-old walls 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.650
 that if it were possible to create such an environment 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:49.420
 Regeneration of cases of HIV may also occur over the 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.700
 infected even if they have fiscal or access injuries because they still exist 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.100
 remains of pulp tissue and the hegewisch sheath 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.520
 that remain alive 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.479
 currently it has been shown that the removal of tissue per span act 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.330
 stimulates tissue regeneration blame inside the ducts of the 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.289
 roots of the cincinnati euros 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.249
 which allows its development to continue 

00:02:13.249 --> 00:02:18.109
 the walls of holm oaks thicken the length of the roots increases 

00:02:18.109 --> 00:02:22.019
 they heal the lesions but apical and the open apices close 

00:02:22.929 --> 00:02:26.150
 this new way of thinking about the situation 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.349
 expand the horizons of endodontics and engineering 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:33.209
 so as a construction professional 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:36.760
 I recognize the invaluable contribution of bridges and implants 

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:40.979
 but my priority with respect to the welfare of patients is the 

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:45.439
 preservation of your natural teeth and I hope that the day will arrive very soon 

00:02:45.439 --> 00:02:49.839
 that natural teeth that can not be preserved are replaced with 

00:02:49.839 --> 00:02:55.469
 teeth and impious developed meanwhile the revascularization portar is in 

00:02:55.469 --> 00:02:59.959
 this time the best option for your children to keep their teeth and 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:02.019
 that these mature and together with them
