00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:05.810
 you have to lose bands like they are here 

00:00:03.259 --> 00:00:07.790
 yes, but well, today 

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:10.730
 I will comment on how to put your 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:13.209
 own tone of calls and messages in your 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:15.440
 cell phone with android then let's start 

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:18.020
 The first thing we have to do is go to 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:20.660
 applications find the folder that says 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:24.680
 my documents files there you can 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:28.400
 enter and go to the folder that says all 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:30.650
 the files and you can see we enter and 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:33.650
 we entered what would be the memory 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:37.550
 internal of the cell phone in this case is the 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:40.850
 first because it 's a base there is and 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:42.950
 we look for a folder that is called 5 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:46.100
 here you can see that it is the first 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:48.290
 then we give him there and here in that 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:51.530
 folder we make a folder again 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:54.510
 new that is called average then for 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:57.020
 that we press here 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:00.680
 we put new folder 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:03.170
 and there we put the middle word because 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.620
 half 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.760
 for your good very well 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:10.910
 and a half 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:13.940
 we give ok already created the folder 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:17.060
 we entered and in this same folder 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:20.210
 we put another black folder that 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:23.680
 it's called notifications in Spanish and 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.680
 would be notifications 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.550
 [Music] 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.180
 God 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:38.920
 with that in the end because if you do not have to 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.480
 that letter notification what can be 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:45.320
 see let's accept 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:47.060
 there it is if you do not have those letters like that 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:50.510
 as it is if it is not well written is not going 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:54.250
 to work good and good here is that 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:58.250
 you can see and we enter here in this 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:02:00.200
 this is where we are going to insert the music 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:03.230
 or the tone we want to use to 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.520
 both messages and for calls in 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:06.930
 this case then I will try 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.200
 I have three to one that I have in the 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.200
 bluetooth 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:17.140
 that is going to listen to listen good 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:20.280
 so 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.280
 then I will give them 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.180
 copy 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:28.540
 cooper here the folder without folder 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:32.400
 and here in the media folder 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.400
 notification here we are going to paste 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.750
 paste here 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.750
 there is 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.750
 okay 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:46.450
 and hey everything is ready now let's go 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.120
 go to what would be the configuration both 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.340
 of the call as for the message 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.700
 so 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.739
 what are they 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.989
 so let's start with the 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:59.260
 messages then here is in the 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:04.819
 message folder been seen here 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:08.540
 configuration and search all do not see the 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:12.319
 tone all everything all everything all all everything 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:15.410
 everything all all everything in this message is 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:18.319
 activation notification select all 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:21.300
 not here yes yes there you can see we give 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:26.290
 center and we search 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:28.659
 here it is there you can observe previous 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.549
 when it is put into account it is already 

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:33.400
 working everything I have not what 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:36.640
 let's adapt and you 're ready 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:39.549
 for the tone of messages and the same 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:41.349
 way to make calls so that 

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:45.450
 the call comes to us, let the 

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:45.450
 phone we go to the configuration 

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:50.569
 it's wrong 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:54.799
 and again 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:57.660
 phone for the configuration is this 

00:03:54.799 --> 00:04:00.120
 mother and then you see 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:02.620
 call settings and even what 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:05.769
 last guess what should be 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:05.769
 ring tone 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:11.640
 and there it is 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:13.530
 and we look for it and when you can 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:16.530
 give account is already working only 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:18.810
 we are going to accept and ready we have the 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:22.049
 call tone that one wants from the 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:24.660
 simple easy and fast way I hope 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:28.280
 that you liked the video and even 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:28.280
