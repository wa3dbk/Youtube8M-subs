00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.939
 that sighs 2 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.160
 it's hard

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:45.790
 we scored quality is not bad and I 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.950
 think that there was concentrated we knew 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:51.610
 who was going to lose 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:53.319

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:25.000

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:48.280
 yeah satisfied that for matches to 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:50.680
 home with them that win 8-0 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:55.010
 after 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:56.990
 the requirement of efficiency in the btp y 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:58.550
 to have more so I also have one is 

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:00.380
 able to do better but it's a 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:01.130
 rehearsal match the preparation was 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:03.500
 very short 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:04.890
 the holidays also just after the giro 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:08.240

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:09.470
 ambition this label we know that 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:11.270
 I had a fantastic season 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:12.770
 season behind the balloon no you have 

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:13.800
 filled with water 

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:15.500
 ap the boys 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:17.239
 seventh consecutive 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:18.769
 when we are competitors and 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:20.299
 competitors there are always 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:22.040
 objectives to reach and evacuate 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:23.720

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:26.630
 of champion of France to fetch 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:28.970
 to match the boys then we went 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:30.770
 also a lot of trips with a club 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:32.360
 who won three times consecutively 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:33.350
 the league of champions so we also 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.880
 want to do 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:36.220
 when we think about all this you say we 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:38.570
 still has some nice challenges to take up 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:40.160
 given away for the slagging 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:41.810
