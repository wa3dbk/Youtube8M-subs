by all this old Sony action cam s10 I

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.629 
by all this old Sony action cam s10 I
have<00:00:11.040> that<00:00:11.280> IR<00:00:11.849> filter<00:00:12.330> removed<00:00:12.719> out<00:00:12.929> of<00:00:13.110> this

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:13.639 
have that IR filter removed out of this

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:16.039 
have that IR filter removed out of this
ultimately<00:00:14.639> this<00:00:14.969> is<00:00:15.030> what<00:00:15.360> this<00:00:15.540> test<00:00:15.839> is

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
ultimately this is what this test is

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.859 
ultimately this is what this test is
gonna<00:00:16.230> be<00:00:16.560> but<00:00:17.369> here<00:00:17.520> we<00:00:17.640> have<00:00:17.760> the<00:00:18.060> new<00:00:18.270> action

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
cam the s100 beat so I'm going to strap

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.830 
cam the s100 beat so I'm going to strap
that<00:00:22.109> on<00:00:22.289> the<00:00:22.380> right<00:00:22.560> side<00:00:22.830> of<00:00:22.949> my<00:00:22.980> head<00:00:23.100> and

at<00:01:00.170> 720<00:01:01.340> at<00:01:02.340> 30<00:01:02.699> frames<00:01:02.969> a<00:01:03.329> second<00:01:03.809> so<00:01:04.170> let's

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
at 720 at 30 frames a second so let's

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.250 
at 720 at 30 frames a second so let's
see<00:01:05.070> how<00:01:05.220> they<00:01:05.430> stack<00:01:05.489> up<00:01:06.000> and<00:01:06.299> just<00:01:06.810> how<00:01:06.960> good

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
s10 with the IR filter removed you just

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.390 
s10 with the IR filter removed you just
compare<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.110> quality<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.740> way<00:01:28.770> it<00:01:28.979> is<00:01:29.130> now

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:31.400 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:37.280 

I'm<00:01:32.400> gonna<00:01:32.549> go<00:01:32.759> ahead<00:01:32.880> and<00:01:33.619> turn<00:01:34.619> this<00:01:36.290> IR

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
I'm gonna go ahead and turn this IR

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:42.109 
I'm gonna go ahead and turn this IR
light<00:01:37.590> on<00:01:37.799> I<00:01:38.780> have<00:01:39.780> a<00:01:39.810> doomed<00:01:40.320> all<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:40.920> way<00:01:41.119> out

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
light on I have a doomed all the way out

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.789 
light on I have a doomed all the way out
so<00:01:42.570> it<00:01:42.659> should<00:01:42.840> be<00:01:42.990> broad<00:01:45.290> go<00:01:46.290> ahead<00:01:46.439> and<00:01:46.590> shut

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
so it should be broad go ahead and shut

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.560 
so it should be broad go ahead and shut

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:09.070 

and<00:02:00.490> as<00:02:00.640> you<00:02:00.790> can<00:02:00.970> see<00:02:02.280> pretty<00:02:03.280> nice

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.810 

now<00:02:10.080> I'm<00:02:10.259> going<00:02:10.470> to<00:02:10.590> go<00:02:10.979> ahead<00:02:11.070> and<00:02:11.340> zoom<00:02:11.550> that

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:11.820 
now I'm going to go ahead and zoom that

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:18.160 
now I'm going to go ahead and zoom that
out<00:02:12.230> this<00:02:14.660> deeper<00:02:15.660> spot<00:02:15.930> of<00:02:16.170> this<00:02:16.350> stream

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
out this deeper spot of this stream

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:26.800 
out this deeper spot of this stream
you're<00:02:19.170> talking<00:02:19.560> about<00:02:19.830> 60<00:02:20.220> 70<00:02:20.580> feet<00:02:20.970> away

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.070 

again<00:02:27.810> Pines<00:02:28.430> up<00:02:29.430> there<00:02:29.790> just<00:02:30.030> to<00:02:30.180> the<00:02:30.390> left<00:02:30.900> of

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
again Pines up there just to the left of

again Pines up there just to the left of
the<00:02:31.170> moon<00:02:32.600> probably<00:02:33.600> about<00:02:33.750> 150<00:02:34.530> feet

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.420 

I<00:02:44.180> got<00:02:44.870> this<00:02:45.050> enough<00:02:45.379> light<00:02:45.680> what<00:02:45.980> that<00:02:46.190> red

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
I got this enough light what that red

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.800 
I got this enough light what that red
light<00:02:46.640> on<00:02:46.670> to<00:02:47.209> see<00:02:47.420> what<00:02:47.599> I'm<00:02:47.720> doing<00:02:49.810> going

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
light on to see what I'm doing going

00:02:50.810 --> 00:03:06.670 
light on to see what I'm doing going
across<00:02:51.200> this<00:02:51.560> thing<00:03:01.690> it's<00:03:02.690> pretty<00:03:02.959> nice<00:03:05.680> I'm

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
across this thing it's pretty nice I'm

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.940 
across this thing it's pretty nice I'm
