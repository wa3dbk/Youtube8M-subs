00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.880
 you can light the junction 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.140
 and give a highlight on the database that he actually 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.190

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.300

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:50.980
 We become here in this bush not 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.620

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:55.390
 you will not need to do anything 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:58.620

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:01.030
 bushes can be done will be lt 6 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.280
 the four were lighted in principle for this 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:06.310
 second tank is enough for 3 needed 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:17.710

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:20.400

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.770
 here's a little bit distanced so as to be able to evaluate 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.659
 the whole situation is going on here 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.729
 by the way the place is very comfortable with the left 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:39.329
 hand you will not find unless 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:47.189
 only if the plates are in front of you too 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:51.110

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.110

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.880
 drying without masking is not a bush 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:13.480
 help is nice but not so 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:13.480
