 the margin of error is two points 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.200
 percentages for more or less 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.180
 the president dilma rousseff who had 36 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.879
 percent in previous research 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.579
 the candidate is still at the same 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.440
 deceased Eduardo Campos had 8% 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.649
 there born here should replace him 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:49.559
 starts the race with 21% of intentions 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:52.699
 of voting and aviation snows that had 21% 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:56.190

00:00:52.699 --> 00:01:00.000
 pastor everaldo do ps continues with the 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.980
 3% as an aerial marina and the other

 eight candidates who compete with the 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.720
 president dilma rousseff sum now 46 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.060
 percent of the vote 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.490
 this result removes the possibility of 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.320
 the election to be decided in the first round 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.600
 research shows that in a possible 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:19.259

 the president dilma rousseff would have 43%

 but considering the margin of error to 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.009
 situation is evaluated as a tie 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:32.100
 technician because dilma could have two 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:35.640
 points higher hardness and marina - in this 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.650
 if both would draw with 45 points 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.659
 already in the second round simulation with the 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:43.590
