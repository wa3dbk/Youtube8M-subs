00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:47.660 
tactically the game is pretty easy for

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:49.780 
tactically the game is pretty easy for
the<00:04:47.720> first<00:04:47.930> like<00:04:48.260> five<00:04:48.560> missions<00:04:48.980> or<00:04:49.160> so<00:04:49.460> and

the first like five missions or so and
it's<00:04:50.570> more<00:04:50.720> of<00:04:50.840> like<00:04:50.870> a<00:04:50.990> tutorial<00:04:51.590> I<00:04:51.800> guess<00:04:51.980> to

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:52.130 
it's more of like a tutorial I guess to

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:53.470 
it's more of like a tutorial I guess to
warm<00:04:52.310> you<00:04:52.430> up<00:04:52.490> for<00:04:52.640> the<00:04:52.730> rest<00:04:52.760> of<00:04:52.970> the<00:04:53.060> game<00:04:53.270> but

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:53.480 
warm you up for the rest of the game but

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:55.810 
warm you up for the rest of the game but
as<00:04:53.810> you<00:04:54.080> progress<00:04:54.290> through<00:04:54.560> the<00:04:55.190> the<00:04:55.460> levels

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:55.820 
as you progress through the the levels

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:57.430 
as you progress through the the levels
it<00:04:56.210> does<00:04:56.480> actually<00:04:56.600> get<00:04:56.900> quite<00:04:57.110> challenging

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:57.440 
it does actually get quite challenging

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.350 
it does actually get quite challenging
you<00:04:57.770> can't<00:04:58.010> just<00:04:58.220> run<00:04:58.820> around<00:04:58.910> blasting

00:04:59.350 --> 00:04:59.360 
you can't just run around blasting

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.300 
you can't just run around blasting
anything<00:04:59.900> you've<00:05:00.020> gotta<00:05:00.200> use<00:05:00.440> your<00:05:00.470> mobility

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:01.310 
anything you've gotta use your mobility

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:03.740 
take cover because it does get quite

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:04.930 
take cover because it does get quite
tough<00:05:04.130> towards<00:05:04.520> the<00:05:04.610> end<00:05:04.730> of<00:05:04.820> the<00:05:04.910> game

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:04.940 
tough towards the end of the game

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:07.360 
tough towards the end of the game
there's<00:05:05.630> also<00:05:05.810> like<00:05:06.080> a<00:05:06.110> three<00:05:06.470> star<00:05:06.800> system

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:07.370 
there's also like a three star system

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:09.160 
there's also like a three star system
for<00:05:07.670> each<00:05:07.730> level<00:05:08.210> so<00:05:08.420> these<00:05:08.600> are<00:05:08.810> like<00:05:08.960> your

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:09.170 
for each level so these are like your

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:11.530 
for each level so these are like your
points<00:05:09.620> and<00:05:09.830> obviously<00:05:10.580> if<00:05:11.120> you<00:05:11.330> want<00:05:11.480> to

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:11.540 
points and obviously if you want to

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:13.240 
points and obviously if you want to
finish<00:05:11.690> the<00:05:11.930> game<00:05:12.110> you<00:05:12.620> got<00:05:12.740> to<00:05:12.770> try<00:05:13.010> and<00:05:13.160> get

the<00:05:13.370> three<00:05:13.610> stars<00:05:13.880> on<00:05:14.030> all<00:05:14.150> the<00:05:14.300> levels<00:05:14.480> so

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:15.050 
the three stars on all the levels so

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:17.200 
the three stars on all the levels so
there's<00:05:15.650> some<00:05:15.770> replayability<00:05:16.280> definitely<00:05:17.000> in

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:17.210 
there's some replayability definitely in

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:19.600 
there's some replayability definitely in
that<00:05:17.390> respect<00:05:17.810> you<00:05:18.410> can<00:05:18.560> also<00:05:18.680> add<00:05:18.950> skulls<00:05:19.400> to

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:19.610 
that respect you can also add skulls to

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:21.340 
that respect you can also add skulls to
each<00:05:19.730> level<00:05:20.090> before<00:05:20.270> you<00:05:20.540> play<00:05:20.750> just<00:05:21.020> like<00:05:21.080> in

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:25.840 
the normal Halo games so the scores add
a<00:05:23.990> new<00:05:24.320> challenge<00:05:24.860> to<00:05:25.070> the<00:05:25.100> game<00:05:25.400> make<00:05:25.640> it<00:05:25.790> a

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:25.850 
a new challenge to the game make it a

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:28.060 
a new challenge to the game make it a
lot<00:05:25.970> harder<00:05:26.000> and<00:05:26.600> that<00:05:27.440> just<00:05:27.650> gives<00:05:27.770> it<00:05:27.890> a<00:05:27.980> bit

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:28.070 
lot harder and that just gives it a bit

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:30.250 
lot harder and that just gives it a bit
of<00:05:28.190> replayability<00:05:28.790> I<00:05:29.240> guess<00:05:29.510> you<00:05:30.140> get

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:30.260 
of replayability I guess you get

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:31.570 
of replayability I guess you get
achievements<00:05:30.380> as<00:05:30.950> well<00:05:31.100> so<00:05:31.400> the

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:31.580 
achievements as well so the

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:33.910 
achievements as well so the
completionist<00:05:32.210> amongst<00:05:32.870> us<00:05:32.990> we<00:05:33.530> want<00:05:33.710> to<00:05:33.800> make

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:33.920 
completionist amongst us we want to make

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:35.170 
completionist amongst us we want to make
sure<00:05:33.950> that<00:05:34.100> they've<00:05:34.370> got<00:05:34.610> all<00:05:34.730> those<00:05:34.880> in<00:05:35.090> the

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:35.180 
sure that they've got all those in the

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:37.390 
sure that they've got all those in the
bag<00:05:35.360> I<00:05:35.600> guess<00:05:35.960> if<00:05:36.140> you've<00:05:36.320> got<00:05:36.590> a<00:05:36.620> tablet<00:05:37.100> and

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:37.400 
bag I guess if you've got a tablet and

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:38.620 
bag I guess if you've got a tablet and
you<00:05:37.430> going<00:05:37.700> on<00:05:37.790> like<00:05:37.910> a<00:05:37.940> long<00:05:38.210> train<00:05:38.600> journey

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:38.630 
you going on like a long train journey

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:40.870 
you going on like a long train journey
or<00:05:39.140> a<00:05:39.170> long<00:05:39.350> flight<00:05:39.650> you<00:05:40.190> can<00:05:40.340> pick<00:05:40.490> this<00:05:40.640> game

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:40.880 
or a long flight you can pick this game

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:42.700 
or a long flight you can pick this game
up<00:05:40.940> and<00:05:41.240> it<00:05:41.330> would<00:05:41.480> provide<00:05:41.840> you<00:05:42.050> with<00:05:42.200> that<00:05:42.320> a

up and it would provide you with that a

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:45.310
