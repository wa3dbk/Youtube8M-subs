00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.989

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:47.870
 Europe is very underwear very underwear 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.870

00:00:50.210 --> 00:01:04.400
 when a block did not like the gesture 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:41.440
 memory and justice today are fulfilled 35 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:44.380
 years of a historical event since a 30 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.610
 April 1977, mothers gathered together 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.130
 For the first time in May Square 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:49.720
 looking for your children, let's hear a touch 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:53.220
 of the hebe de bonafini talk with 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:55.230
 Victor Hugo and a big hug 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.330
 the truth that we are so happy that 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:02:00.600
 We can believe and your day of happiness 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:03.030
 before starting with horror because 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.650
 We are here because of the horror and the pain 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.540
 Sometimes when these things happen I left 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:08.940
 with cristian when he died 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.530
 then there are moments not hours but 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.960
 moments when I was happy again 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.480
 I again had a little bit of happiness and 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.980
 now we much more not much more 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.140
 because we got good we the 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.390
 jail for the murderers but the laws 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.580
 is all that for what was fought 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.260
 so many amazing years is not that sometimes 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.820
 I get lost in the volume of the 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.740
 information in the follow-up 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:31.740

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:34.260
 that permanently attend all this 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:36.120
 pages and pages every day and news 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.700
 that excite to think that it is 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.830
 finally every day work is done 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.690
 justice and every day that is changing 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.620
 a little bit everything and that is also 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:47.890
 important because one 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:49.450
 murderer does not have to take those things 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:52.890
 to have hope to have strength 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.890

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:58.830

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.930
 affecting Spain where you look and 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:03.210

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:06.330
 can reject this monument to the 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:08.340
