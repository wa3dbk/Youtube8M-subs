00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:12.240
 which plant can the 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:15.419
 in a pot yes believe it or not but 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.730
 almost every plant can be in a pot or 

00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:22.140
 put in a container and a birthday fixed 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:26.189
 plants trees shrubs tub plants 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.660
 flower bulbs pink you name it you want 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.640
 there some examples of embas by the way 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.750
 then you can take a look at plant in container 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.520
 dot nl 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.770
 then you will all see ready-made suits 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.780
 so already filled with plants and you can 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.969
 also just order and just for it 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.030
 at home so check plant in 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:44.670
 baking point nl and birthday we know duel 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.780
 just call them lobelia's petunias 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.550
 but on 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.930
 you also need perennials 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:53.039
 plants 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:56.640
 for example this pelvis 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:58.320
 look beautiful flower beautiful leaf angry that 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.670
 characteristic of the perennial that it often 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.789
 in the winter 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:05.400
 but dies every year again and again 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.650
 beautiful comes back a very beautiful one 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.990
 perennial is, for example, this 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.630
 and that is the agapanthus and fields 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.620
 African Lily really a picture 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.930
 then you have one then different 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:19.620
 shrub species 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:21.750
 for example the maple and you put it here 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:25.020
 another nice lip so that in the end 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:28.410
 grows into a fairly beautiful large 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.000
 tree eventually all plants 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:32.430
 those in a pot are a bit small 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.410
 Then just keep the same kind 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.660
 in the open ground that could 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:39.690
 dealing with them through rooting space 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:42.150
 or the size of the pot 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:43.920
 large shrubs and trees really do have 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.850
 need a container of roughly 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.380
 70 by 70 by 70 centimeters type rig 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.330
 those roots that just need to feel good 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:55.260
 can anchor even though 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:57.120
 storms and thus to prevent 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.800
 same bit of money for pink fair 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.660
 said because they want very deeply 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:03.390
 the set of carrots that are not even such 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:06.630
 tray no just grab some higher trays 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.860
 and sit there then you have roses well then 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.430
 you a lot then 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:13.620
 winter green species for example 

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:17.430
 the boxwood 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:20.370
 we have the shrub hedera 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:23.129
 and for example low pines all 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.700
 conifers can in principle also be in one 

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:26.849
 pot it 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:29.310
 please also win what larger pot knows 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:32.489
 well that evergreen plants during the 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:34.260
 always evaporate some water in the winter 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:36.989
 if it is not freezing 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.310
 they continue to grow a little 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:39.690
 and evaporate 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.970
 so you have to in the winter months 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:45.230
 keep an eye on that also during 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:47.579
 winter is not freezing some extra water 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:50.069
 then of course you have a very big one 

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:53.519
 group of tub plants 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:57.690
 think of oleanders on palms 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:03:01.200
 to olive to function jacket 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:02.730
 in short, choose what you like 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.709
 and you do not have enough inspiration yet 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:08.209
 just look at plants in baking point 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:08.209
 en you will arrive late
