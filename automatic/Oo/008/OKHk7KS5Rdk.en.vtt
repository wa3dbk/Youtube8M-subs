00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:14.150
 Hi, I'm an Argentine selection of a 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.830
 little bit with the ball not 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.810
 they are very necessary in a match but 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:20.150
 so they look great for the 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:21.679
 heating there are several steps to 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.499
 can lift the ball there are people who 

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:26.150
 raise with the stick down there are people 

00:00:24.499 --> 00:00:27.949
 lift back is evidence the 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:31.279
 two ways the easiest way is 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:33.620
 throwing the ball back and then 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:37.329
 we already have the ball up a several 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.329
 practicing points 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:43.210
 at the moment we are going to work 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.630
 last basic the ball up 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:54.570
 to be able to lift the ball from 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.110
 from here we have a lot of movement 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.110
 he wake up 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:07.110
 or we can find in the degree 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.290
 which it is a bit higher than their own 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.180
 fence from side to side were written 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:15.030
 remember that it was hardly raised 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.710
 much easier I have it here tried 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.900
 promote many bodies so that the 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.440
 ball that always stores and here intense 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.150
 be much more difficult movements 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:26.700
 but they are not so easy it's not so easy 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.399
 but it would be good if we start 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:32.430
 to then deliver the ball in 

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:34.590
 the success many options of power 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.840
 do the important thing in this that you can 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:41.509
 serving the party is like lifting it 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.509
 when there are three movements 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:46.210
 this is in front of a goalkeepers 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:53.150
 to be able to define and reach 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:55.010
 forward the cut are those who practice 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:57.170
 in many cases it is useful for us 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:59.320
 but so it's very nice to leave the 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.320
 public 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.799
 and 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.489
 yes no 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.330
 and
