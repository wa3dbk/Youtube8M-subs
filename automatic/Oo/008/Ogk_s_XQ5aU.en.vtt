00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
like that and create lines evenly I'm

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.240 
like that and create lines evenly I'm
another<00:00:42.450> good<00:00:42.930> way<00:00:43.079> to<00:00:43.140> do<00:00:43.379> it<00:00:43.410> is<00:00:43.680> if<00:00:43.860> you<00:00:44.070> try

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
hold it to the side like that helps you

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.729 
hold it to the side like that helps you
create<00:00:53.250> different<00:00:53.820> different<00:00:54.590> effects<00:00:55.590> in

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
call it they you can hold it like this

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.480 
call it they you can hold it like this
and<00:01:03.539> you<00:01:03.629> can<00:01:04.040> create<00:01:05.040> that<00:01:05.220> wave<00:01:07.490> without

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
and you can create that wave without

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.030 
and you can create that wave without
using<00:01:08.939> a<00:01:09.000> stencil<00:01:09.270> of<00:01:09.720> course<00:01:10.470> you<00:01:10.590> can<00:01:10.770> use

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
using a stencil of course you can use

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.730 
using a stencil of course you can use
the<00:01:11.189> stencil<00:01:11.430> undo<00:01:11.939> that<00:01:12.119> and<00:01:12.409> when<00:01:13.409> you<00:01:13.530> use

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
the stencil undo that and when you use

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.429 
the stencil undo that and when you use
stencils<00:01:14.360> you<00:01:15.360> just<00:01:15.570> you<00:01:15.930> just<00:01:15.990> hold<00:01:16.290> them

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
stencils you just you just hold them

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.530 
stencils you just you just hold them
straight<00:01:16.619> against<00:01:17.130> it<00:01:17.220> like<00:01:17.369> that<00:01:17.580> and<00:01:18.060> just

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
straight against it like that and just

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.760 
straight against it like that and just
try<00:01:18.750> to<00:01:18.810> keep<00:01:19.020> it<00:01:19.200> flat<00:01:21.409> and<00:01:22.409> go<00:01:22.530> right<00:01:22.740> up

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
try to keep it flat and go right up

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.950 
try to keep it flat and go right up
against<00:01:23.220> it<00:01:23.369> you<00:01:24.240> can<00:01:24.420> cut<00:01:24.630> these<00:01:24.780> in

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
against it you can cut these in

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.630 
against it you can cut these in
different<00:01:25.049> angles<00:01:25.409> like<00:01:26.040> if<00:01:26.250> I<00:01:26.369> was<00:01:26.490> just

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
different angles like if I was just

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.380 
different angles like if I was just
going<00:01:26.790> to<00:01:26.820> do<00:01:26.970> a<00:01:27.000> rip<00:01:27.270> effect<00:01:28.909> and<00:01:29.909> you<00:01:30.119> just

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
going to do a rip effect and you just

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.300 
going to do a rip effect and you just
that<00:01:31.200> will<00:01:31.320> give<00:01:31.470> you<00:01:31.560> texture<00:01:33.799> and<00:01:34.799> if<00:01:35.130> you

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
that will give you texture and if you

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.969 
that will give you texture and if you
didn't<00:01:35.549> want<00:01:35.579> to<00:01:35.880> have<00:01:36.090> it<00:01:36.270> all<00:01:36.680> once<00:01:37.680> again

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
didn't want to have it all once again

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.249 
didn't want to have it all once again
you'll<00:01:38.189> hold<00:01:38.340> it<00:01:38.490> hold<00:01:39.000> airbrush<00:01:39.479> flat<00:01:40.020> like

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
you'll hold it hold airbrush flat like

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:45.710 
you'll hold it hold airbrush flat like
that<00:01:41.180> and<00:01:42.590> if<00:01:43.590> you<00:01:43.799> stroke<00:01:44.159> it<00:01:44.340> out<00:01:44.520> like<00:01:44.790> if

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
that and if you stroke it out like if

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:52.930 
that and if you stroke it out like if
you<00:01:45.899> stroke<00:01:46.200> out<00:01:46.470> with<00:01:46.710> it

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:52.940 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.960 

that<00:01:53.940> gives<00:01:54.150> you<00:01:54.270> a<00:01:54.330> certain<00:01:54.600> effect<00:01:54.900> to<00:01:55.550> so<00:01:56.550> if

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:56.970 
that gives you a certain effect to so if

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:59.680 
that gives you a certain effect to so if
you<00:01:57.390> if<00:01:57.660> you<00:01:57.780> notice<00:01:58.080> I'm<00:01:58.200> going<00:01:58.380> like<00:01:58.650> that

00:01:59.680 --> 00:01:59.690 
you if you notice I'm going like that

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:02.870 
you if you notice I'm going like that
that<00:02:00.690> helps<00:02:00.990> it<00:02:01.140> so<00:02:01.890> for<00:02:02.070> example<00:02:02.460> if<00:02:02.520> I<00:02:02.610> want

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
that helps it so for example if I want

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.850 
that helps it so for example if I want
to<00:02:02.970> have<00:02:03.120> another<00:02:03.870> Peck<00:02:04.170> like<00:02:04.380> that<00:02:06.860> you

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
to have another Peck like that you

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.440 
to have another Peck like that you
notice<00:02:08.190> that<00:02:08.340> it's<00:02:08.580> small<00:02:08.910> on<00:02:09.090> one<00:02:09.300> side<00:02:11.450> and

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
notice that it's small on one side and

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:19.370 
notice that it's small on one side and
bigger<00:02:12.690> on<00:02:12.840> the<00:02:12.900> other<00:02:18.110> gives<00:02:19.110> it<00:02:19.260> as

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
bigger on the other gives it as

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.590 
bigger on the other gives it as
