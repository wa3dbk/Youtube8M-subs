00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:40.190 
tape I think that this means this is a

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:43.719 
tape I think that this means this is a
clue<00:01:40.520> to<00:01:40.910> the<00:01:41.240> next<00:01:41.420> DLC<00:01:41.899> batch<00:01:42.380> coming<00:01:43.220> from

clue to the next DLC batch coming from

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:45.609 
clue to the next DLC batch coming from
Treyarch<00:01:44.270> this<00:01:44.479> means<00:01:44.690> that<00:01:44.929> either<00:01:45.349> there's

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:45.619 
Treyarch this means that either there's

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:46.960 
Treyarch this means that either there's
going<00:01:45.709> to<00:01:45.770> be<00:01:45.830> a<00:01:45.920> roll<00:01:46.099> of<00:01:46.220> tape<00:01:46.369> that's<00:01:46.610> an

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970 
going to be a roll of tape that's an
