00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.879
 very good are numbers that you are seeing 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.589
 we are at the sony stand and today 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:06.589
 we know the sony xperia all 

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:20.040
 very good when numbers are here 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.710
 as serving with the new z 2 that 

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:24.270
 just presented we are going to think 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.130
 watching the design a little bit the design 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:28.220
 as it is to appreciate is quite enough 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.090
 similar to previous versions 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:33.720
 not to say that it is practically 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.970
 identical would have a configuration of 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.680
 buttons very similar that here in the 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.840
 side part we will appreciate that 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.320
 we have here the card slots 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:45.220
 microsd right next to the lid button 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.440
 of ignition 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:48.610
 right next to us we have the buttons 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.340
 raise and lower volume that in my opinion 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:52.660
 they have put them too close and just 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.160
 the bottom part we found a button 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.660
 specific to the camera that in my 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.430
 opinion is always always a point to 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.350
 favor and that very few brands have in 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.850
 account the phone is single-body 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.800
 days later like their previous 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.990
 It is resistant to water and dust has 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.570
 a 5.2-inch screen in a 

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:09.670
 Full resolution HD to 1080 is capable of 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:12.340
 recording videos in 4k on your own is a 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:14.290
 stand dragon 801 which is a quad core that 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.310
 work 2,13 2 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:17.560
 all this is accompanied by a 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.600
 3 gigabyte ram memory and its memory 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.790
 of internal storage would be 16 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.700
 gigas your battery is 3200 milliamps 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:28.830
 its rear camera of 20.7 megapixels and 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.830
 its front camera is 2 megapixels 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.100
 Well I hope you liked it 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.840
 remember that all our networks 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:47.159

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.159
