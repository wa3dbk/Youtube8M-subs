can see it shows you the the current

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:22.970 
can see it shows you the the current
date<00:00:20.699> and<00:00:20.730> the<00:00:20.999> current<00:00:21.300> time<00:00:21.570> as<00:00:21.990> well<00:00:22.619> as<00:00:22.800> the

phase<00:00:23.310> of<00:00:23.519> the<00:00:23.609> Moon<00:00:23.820> with<00:00:24.119> a<00:00:24.150> nice<00:00:24.529> graphic

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
phase of the Moon with a nice graphic

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.290 
phase of the Moon with a nice graphic
representation<00:00:26.489> that<00:00:26.609> was<00:00:26.759> actually<00:00:27.029> created

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
representation that was actually created

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.599 
representation that was actually created
by<00:00:27.539> NASA<00:00:27.779> satellites<00:00:28.529> you<00:00:29.279> can<00:00:29.310> see<00:00:29.519> the

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
by NASA satellites you can see the

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.309 
by NASA satellites you can see the
percent<00:00:29.939> illuminated<00:00:30.509> and<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:30.810> and<00:00:31.019> the

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:31.319 
percent illuminated and the and the

00:00:31.319 --> 00:00:33.020 
percent illuminated and the and the
accurate<00:00:31.890> distance<00:00:32.310> to<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:32.669> moon<00:00:32.700> and<00:00:32.970> you

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
accurate distance to the moon and you

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.729 
accurate distance to the moon and you
can<00:00:33.149> see<00:00:33.329> that<00:00:33.510> number<00:00:33.750> is<00:00:33.840> actually<00:00:34.170> changing

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
can see that number is actually changing

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.400 
can see that number is actually changing
over<00:00:34.950> time<00:00:35.160> how<00:00:36.030> old<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.269> Moon<00:00:36.449> is<00:00:36.629> and<00:00:37.170> when

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
over time how old the Moon is and when

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.950 
over time how old the Moon is and when
it<00:00:37.530> rises<00:00:37.769> in<00:00:38.219> sets<00:00:38.550> in<00:00:38.789> your<00:00:39.120> location<00:00:39.809> we

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
it rises in sets in your location we

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.380 
it rises in sets in your location we
actually<00:00:40.289> detect<00:00:40.620> that<00:00:40.739> with<00:00:40.800> GPS<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:42.030> cool

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
actually detect that with GPS the cool

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:43.970 
actually detect that with GPS the cool
thing<00:00:42.719> about<00:00:42.870> this<00:00:43.140> is<00:00:43.559> you<00:00:43.679> can<00:00:43.800> actually

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
thing about this is you can actually

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.479 
thing about this is you can actually
drag<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:45.030> moon<00:00:45.269> back<00:00:45.660> and<00:00:45.870> forth<00:00:46.230> and<00:00:47.219> you<00:00:47.340> can

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
drag the moon back and forth and you can

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.189 
drag the moon back and forth and you can
see<00:00:47.699> the<00:00:47.850> dates<00:00:48.149> and<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.719> other<00:00:48.839> information

00:00:49.189 --> 00:00:49.199 
see the dates and the other information

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:52.490 
see the dates and the other information
changes<00:00:50.129> dynamically<00:00:50.850> as<00:00:51.179> you<00:00:51.989> move<00:00:52.199> forward

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
changes dynamically as you move forward

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.400 
changes dynamically as you move forward
you<00:00:52.890> can<00:00:53.820> also<00:00:53.969> pick<00:00:54.329> a<00:00:54.359> very<00:00:54.660> specific<00:00:54.899> date

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
you can also pick a very specific date

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.939 
you can also pick a very specific date
if<00:00:55.710> you<00:00:55.829> want<00:00:56.010> to<00:00:56.070> pick<00:00:56.219> a<00:00:56.249> date<00:00:56.519> here<00:00:57.170> right<00:00:58.170> in

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
if you want to pick a date here right in

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.020 
if you want to pick a date here right in
the<00:00:59.160> future<00:00:59.600> you<00:01:00.600> can<00:01:00.719> pick<00:01:00.870> that<00:01:01.019> date<00:01:02.030> and

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
the future you can pick that date and

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.509 
the future you can pick that date and
it'll<00:01:03.210> change<00:01:03.239> that<00:01:03.870> time<00:01:04.170> and<00:01:04.409> date<00:01:04.559> you<00:01:05.339> can

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
it'll change that time and date you can

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.700 
it'll change that time and date you can
also<00:01:06.590> go<00:01:07.590> to<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:07.800> next<00:01:08.130> full<00:01:08.340> moon<00:01:08.370> or<00:01:09.590> you<00:01:10.590> can

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
also go to the next full moon or you can

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.420 
also go to the next full moon or you can
also<00:01:10.860> go<00:01:11.100> to<00:01:11.160> the<00:01:11.340> next<00:01:11.520> new<00:01:11.730> moon

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:13.430 
also go to the next new moon

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.490 
also go to the next new moon
if<00:01:14.430> you<00:01:14.520> see<00:01:14.640> we<00:01:14.730> got<00:01:14.820> this<00:01:14.910> cool<00:01:15.500> totally

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
if you see we got this cool totally

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.220 
if you see we got this cool totally
unscientific<00:01:17.190> star<00:01:18.150> background<00:01:18.810> going<00:01:19.080> on

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:19.230 
unscientific star background going on

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:21.770 
unscientific star background going on
here<00:01:19.640> it<00:01:20.640> just<00:01:20.850> looks<00:01:21.000> cool<00:01:21.210> we<00:01:21.510> know<00:01:21.630> that

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
here it just looks cool we know that

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.270 
here it just looks cool we know that
it's<00:01:21.900> not<00:01:21.960> scientific<00:01:22.740> so<00:01:22.800> you<00:01:22.860> can<00:01:23.010> turn<00:01:23.130> that

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
it's not scientific so you can turn that

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.280 
it's not scientific so you can turn that
off<00:01:23.340> in<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.760> settings<00:01:24.060> if<00:01:24.150> you<00:01:24.180> want<00:01:24.570> we<00:01:25.140> also

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
off in the settings if you want we also

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.840 
off in the settings if you want we also
detect<00:01:25.740> if<00:01:25.950> you're<00:01:26.130> in<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.340> northern<00:01:26.580> or

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
detect if you're in the northern or

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.910 
detect if you're in the northern or
southern<00:01:26.880> hemisphere<00:01:27.660> and<00:01:27.900> so<00:01:28.530> we'll<00:01:28.680> put<00:01:28.710> the

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
southern hemisphere and so we'll put the

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.880 
southern hemisphere and so we'll put the
moon<00:01:29.070> in<00:01:29.190> the<00:01:29.250> proper<00:01:29.610> orientation<00:01:29.850> for<00:01:30.540> you

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
moon in the proper orientation for you

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.940 
moon in the proper orientation for you
and<00:01:32.720> then<00:01:33.720> you<00:01:33.810> can<00:01:33.960> also<00:01:34.170> if<00:01:34.410> you<00:01:34.440> want<00:01:34.530> you

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
and then you can also if you want you

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.250 
and then you can also if you want you
can<00:01:35.100> publish<00:01:35.370> out<00:01:35.760> your<00:01:36.540> images<00:01:36.930> of<00:01:37.050> the<00:01:37.110> moon

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:37.260 
can publish out your images of the moon

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.590 
can publish out your images of the moon
you<00:01:37.950> can<00:01:38.070> put<00:01:38.190> them<00:01:38.310> into<00:01:38.460> Google+<00:01:38.940> into
