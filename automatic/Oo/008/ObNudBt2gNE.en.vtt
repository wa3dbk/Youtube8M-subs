except it's just a little bit smaller so

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:25.849 
except it's just a little bit smaller so
we're<00:00:24.720> looking<00:00:24.810> at<00:00:25.109> a<00:00:25.140> similar<00:00:25.410> game<00:00:25.590> ain't<00:00:25.769> no

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
we're looking at a similar game ain't no

2.5 gigahertz we have a 2600 milliamp

2.5 gigahertz we have a 2600 milliamp
hour<00:00:37.110> battery<00:00:37.140> which<00:00:37.649> is<00:00:37.770> actually<00:00:38.070> pretty

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
hour battery which is actually pretty

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.660 
hour battery which is actually pretty
good<00:00:38.670> it's<00:00:39.090> also<00:00:39.300> IP<00:00:40.079> rated<00:00:40.739> so<00:00:41.309> if<00:00:41.430> we<00:00:41.550> go

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
good it's also IP rated so if we go

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.790 
good it's also IP rated so if we go
around<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.059> side<00:00:42.300> here<00:00:42.719> you<00:00:43.110> can<00:00:43.260> see<00:00:43.440> that<00:00:43.469> it

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
around the side here you can see that it

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.709 
around the side here you can see that it
does<00:00:43.980> have<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.309> flaps<00:00:44.640> I<00:00:44.969> do<00:00:45.270> have<00:00:45.600> the

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
does have the flaps I do have the

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.020 
does have the flaps I do have the
waterproofing<00:00:46.649> and<00:00:47.280> one<00:00:47.700> of<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:47.879> biggest

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
waterproofing and one of the biggest

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.660 
waterproofing and one of the biggest
differences<00:00:48.629> is<00:00:48.930> that<00:00:49.170> this<00:00:49.320> is<00:00:49.379> not<00:00:49.680> metal<00:00:50.100> so

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
differences is that this is not metal so

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.580 
differences is that this is not metal so
when<00:00:50.820> we<00:00:50.910> kind<00:00:51.120> of<00:00:51.210> look<00:00:51.480> at<00:00:51.690> this<00:00:52.199> around<00:00:52.500> it

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
when we kind of look at this around it

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.799 
when we kind of look at this around it
for<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:52.829> translucent<00:00:53.520> plastic<00:00:53.809> which

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
for the translucent plastic which

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.380 
for the translucent plastic which
actually<00:00:55.289> kind<00:00:55.680> of<00:00:55.770> gives<00:00:55.949> it<00:00:56.070> a<00:00:56.360> like<00:00:57.360> a

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
actually kind of gives it a like a

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.389 
actually kind of gives it a like a
spacey<00:00:57.870> kind<00:00:58.199> of<00:00:58.260> feel<00:00:58.440> like<00:00:58.559> I<00:00:58.770> kind<00:00:59.070> of<00:00:59.190> dig

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
spacey kind of feel like I kind of dig

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.150 
spacey kind of feel like I kind of dig
it<00:00:59.520> but<00:00:59.670> it<00:00:59.760> definitely<00:00:59.910> doesn't<00:01:00.239> have<00:01:00.539> that<00:01:00.780> a

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:01.160 
it but it definitely doesn't have that a

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.970 
it but it definitely doesn't have that a
premium<00:01:02.160> aluminum

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:03.980 
premium aluminum

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:08.660 
premium aluminum
chassis<00:01:04.980> that<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.510> z3<00:01:06.510> has<00:01:06.920> on<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.070> rear<00:01:08.280> here

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
chassis that the z3 has on the rear here

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.600 
chassis that the z3 has on the rear here
we<00:01:08.880> have<00:01:09.060> a<00:01:09.090> 20<00:01:09.480> megapixel<00:01:10.130> camera<00:01:11.130> on<00:01:11.340> the

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
we have a 20 megapixel camera on the

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.649 
we have a 20 megapixel camera on the
front<00:01:11.910> we<00:01:12.180> are<00:01:12.330> looking<00:01:12.750> at

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:14.659 
front we are looking at

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:18.279 
front we are looking at
I<00:01:14.689> think<00:01:15.560> it's<00:01:15.679> just<00:01:15.829> a<00:01:15.890> two<00:01:16.070> mega<00:01:16.280> pn2<00:01:16.990> so<00:01:17.990> when

00:01:18.279 --> 00:01:18.289 
I think it's just a two mega pn2 so when

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:20.380 
I think it's just a two mega pn2 so when
it<00:01:18.380> comes<00:01:18.560> to<00:01:18.770> wait<00:01:19.009> it's<00:01:19.310> incredibly<00:01:20.060> light

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
it comes to wait it's incredibly light

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.709 
it comes to wait it's incredibly light
we're<00:01:20.659> looking<00:01:20.929> at<00:01:21.460> 129<00:01:22.460> grams<00:01:22.939> and<00:01:23.299> in<00:01:23.450> terms

00:01:23.709 --> 00:01:23.719 
we're looking at 129 grams and in terms

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:26.649 
we're looking at 129 grams and in terms
of<00:01:23.899> thickness<00:01:24.590> this<00:01:25.520> is<00:01:25.759> eight<00:01:26.090> point<00:01:26.390> six

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:26.659 
of thickness this is eight point six

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:29.410 
of thickness this is eight point six
millimeters<00:01:27.319> so<00:01:27.709> it<00:01:28.340> has<00:01:28.490> the<00:01:28.670> very<00:01:28.819> classic

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
millimeters so it has the very classic

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:30.880 
millimeters so it has the very classic

halfway<00:01:31.039> down<00:01:31.459> there's<00:01:32.149> a<00:01:32.240> volume<00:01:32.659> rocker

00:01:32.889 --> 00:01:32.899 
halfway down there's a volume rocker
