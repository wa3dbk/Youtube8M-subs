00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:07.740
 so hello everybody hope to remember this one 

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:10.800
 a small hybrid battery I her 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:19.699
 I finish a little bit now I will show that she 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:19.699
 maybe the sun is shining bright morning 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:30.740
 9 and now we will test for measurements 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.740
 power means elements on this battery 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:38.760
 19 by 52 millimeters to the smallest 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:43.050
 which they are in theory give current 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:47.239
 200 milliamps per hour see how much 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:51.210
 battery it gives such 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:54.570
 short circuit minus common just 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.730
 there it was inconvenient for me to crawl and here 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:05.840
 look out gave possible here 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:09.810
 please 600 milliamps 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:14.960
 which is very cool i will increase 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:21.119
 solar power three times 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:23.869
 but let's not three in two for example yes they 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:26.100
 in my there 280 milli-amp in my 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:30.150
 must produce short current 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:32.780
 short circuit please 600 milliamps 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:38.600
 charge current will be half ampere stable 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:44.759
 that is, we got the panel 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:47.360
 how many of you are 1205 in general as it were 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:52.770
 smallest in size 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:55.460
 the panel is like a hand roughly 2 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.460
 with a half arm 

00:01:55.969 --> 00:02:05.700
 how did I achieve this in general with 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:12.239
 one battery here it comes main 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:16.680
 current here it is h800 70 milliamps cool it 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:20.550
 which little socket is not small 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:27.810
 a battery of four elements but it 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:32.700
 are i already standing it turns out the amount of 800 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:35.150
 milliamp for some reason but at the exit of 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.150
 throttle 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:46.590
 already falling but at the end of the wire 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.760
 Here is such a story 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:03:05.420
 by voltage we look at voltage 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:10.370
 then 19 8 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:10.370
 small four-cell battery 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:31.100
 gives us 0 57 cartoon big-big 19 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:35.520
 8 and at the output we have 19 his hehe 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:37.610
 fairy tales do not have any here again show 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:40.739
 at the exit 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:44.510
 solar current short 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:53.310
 circuit 600 milliampere 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:58.340
 now maybe show battery battery 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:04:03.650
 four elements and 36 elements 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:03.650
 all in one at the window closes the case 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:22.360
 This battery was made to feed 

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:25.290
 I'll show you a little bit of fishing 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.290
 talking about family 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:40.310
 to feed 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:44.020
 This assembly is a radiator from 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:45.880
 some old one can't even say 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:48.229
 processor 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:51.289
 fellow work computer firm and 

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:55.810
 Generally there is enough trash there 10 

00:04:51.289 --> 00:05:02.710
 watt led that's how i missed 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:07.630
 here is the driver power for 1 amp and 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:11.150
 on the other end of the wire set 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:13.550
 dc si down converter for 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:15.470
 then yes it to but about 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:18.320
 raise we don't need tension 

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:24.979
 battery so 12 volts do for 

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:26.990
 so that the voltage coming on 

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:29.570
 LED could reduce the example to 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:31.820
 9th so that he is not very bright light 

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:35.449
 I squeezed the battery less 

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:38.750
 at first not very sure about this one 

00:05:35.449 --> 00:05:41.060
 solar battery and how to think 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:43.729
 how much is enough for me 7 1 

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:46.669
 battery killed me was enough for 7 

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:49.570
 hours 7 hours it is well, roughly two 

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:52.070
 spend evenings 

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:54.500
 well for three hours on average if 

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:57.260
 battery is maximally charged ie 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:59.449
 and here now in this performance I 

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:01.729
 spent testing mood got along with 

00:05:59.449 --> 00:06:04.849
 half volt basically shines very 

00:06:01.729 --> 00:06:06.979
 tolerably sees everything everything is visible everything is good not 

00:06:04.849 --> 00:06:07.940
 I can say how many cops 

00:06:06.979 --> 00:06:12.080
 dedication 

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:15.099
 but generally did not like the work 

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:20.090
 the radiator is practically not heated 

00:06:15.099 --> 00:06:25.220
 here is a thermo tape so old 

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:29.419
 bespereboynika took here in general as it were in 

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:33.229
 This performance I have worked 28 

00:06:29.419 --> 00:06:35.479
 hours I can not say that I am continuously 

00:06:33.229 --> 00:06:38.229
 watched all the time so as not to overheat 

00:06:35.479 --> 00:06:41.790
 cooler but it did not happen 

00:06:38.229 --> 00:06:46.790
 work all super beautiful chic 

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:51.240
 here and there will be such a battery pack 

00:06:46.790 --> 00:07:03.530
 battery and LED so if now 

00:06:51.240 --> 00:07:03.530
 I will demonstrate how he is essentially plus and minus 

00:07:12.449 --> 00:07:17.639
 now the sun is bright so there is something 

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:31.770
 how it all works will be difficult 

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:31.770
 shines he can see what shines 

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:44.320
 Thank you all for your attention the most important thing 

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:48.280
 tell in general that miracles do not happen 

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:51.310
 and happens with a little trick we 

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:55.740
 have increased 8 solar panels twice 

00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:58.780
 Exactly twice as planned 

00:07:55.740 --> 00:08:01.900
 so that at least 30 to 40 percent was 

00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:04.620
 I think more will be good for everyone 

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:04.620
 thank you all bye
