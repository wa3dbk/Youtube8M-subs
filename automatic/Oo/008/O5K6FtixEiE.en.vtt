that they walked back and forth through

00:06:27.399 --> 00:06:27.409 
for the worst they covered some ground

00:06:27.409 --> 00:06:30.350 
for the worst they covered some ground
we<00:06:28.409> do<00:06:28.530> a<00:06:28.560> lot<00:06:28.830> of<00:06:28.860> training<00:06:29.430> and<00:06:29.580> certainly

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:30.360 
we do a lot of training and certainly

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:32.779 
we do a lot of training and certainly
you<00:06:31.259> hope<00:06:31.409> you<00:06:31.530> never<00:06:31.650> have<00:06:31.770> to<00:06:32.009> use<00:06:32.190> most<00:06:32.520> of

00:06:32.779 --> 00:06:32.789 
you hope you never have to use most of

00:06:32.789 --> 00:06:34.700 
you hope you never have to use most of
it<00:06:32.940> but<00:06:33.419> unfortunately<00:06:33.599> there's<00:06:34.169> times<00:06:34.440> when

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:34.710 
it but unfortunately there's times when

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:36.439 
it but unfortunately there's times when
we<00:06:34.860> use<00:06:35.039> it<00:06:35.280> and<00:06:35.460> so<00:06:35.669> we<00:06:35.789> want<00:06:35.940> to<00:06:36.000> be<00:06:36.090> prepared

00:06:36.439 --> 00:06:36.449 
we use it and so we want to be prepared

00:06:36.449 --> 00:06:39.920 
we use it and so we want to be prepared
in<00:06:36.599> this<00:06:36.750> same<00:06:36.960> situation<00:06:37.849> because<00:06:38.849> it<00:06:39.599> is<00:06:39.750> an

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:39.930 
in this same situation because it is an

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:41.330 
in this same situation because it is an
important<00:06:40.379> part<00:06:40.500> of<00:06:40.650> Texas<00:06:40.949> homeland

important part of Texas homeland
security<00:06:41.909> I<00:06:42.889> think<00:06:43.889> that<00:06:44.430> people<00:06:44.729> can<00:06:44.969> realize

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:45.360 
security I think that people can realize

that they do have people that are
