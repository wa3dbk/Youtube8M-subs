00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:09.489 
little bit difficult to turn so it's

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:11.369 
little bit difficult to turn so it's
gonna<00:04:09.670> take<00:04:09.940> some<00:04:10.000> muscle<00:04:10.480> that's<00:04:10.840> gonna<00:04:11.140> take

00:04:11.369 --> 00:04:11.379 
gonna take some muscle that's gonna take

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:14.009 
gonna take some muscle that's gonna take
some<00:04:11.410> energy<00:04:11.700> so<00:04:12.700> with<00:04:13.329> all<00:04:13.510> that<00:04:13.720> energy<00:04:13.989> you

00:04:14.009 --> 00:04:14.019 
some energy so with all that energy you

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:16.440 
some energy so with all that energy you
still<00:04:14.470> have<00:04:14.860> the<00:04:15.430> 8<00:04:15.610> inch<00:04:15.640> tires<00:04:16.150> that<00:04:16.329> are

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:19.930 
terrain which makes the maneuverability

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:22.890 
terrain which makes the maneuverability
over<00:04:20.410> different<00:04:20.680> train<00:04:20.889> ok<00:04:21.850> but<00:04:22.389> still<00:04:22.690> is
