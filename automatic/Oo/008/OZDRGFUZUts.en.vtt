00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:06.650
 Hi, guys and girls, how are you? 

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:08.930
 here it says 700 in a new video and this 

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:11.210
 video is a tutorial check 

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:13.700
 I have done above 5 minutes ago more 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:15.320
 or less and in which you are going to check 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:19.340
 how they connect the earth that is the one 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:21.350
 I make them a 9300 I'm going to release the I'm going to 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:23.900
 release it with this code that is the one 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:26.420
 You see if you do not notice you can go to the 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:29.510
 previous video and check what is this 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:31.550
 what is this code and well I tell you with 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:33.979
 this wave that is a company I'm going to 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.569
 free it with this code to be able to 

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:38.510
 use it with any card 

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:41.269
 any operator as it is done well 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:44.020
 for this we have to go to the 

00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:47.000
 options of our mobile 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:49.690
 in this case 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.059
 here in the options the spanner 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:53.649
 and you have to advanced options in 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:55.660
 this case of mine how is a system 

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:57.970
 operative so more current would be a 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:01.850
 device 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:03.430
 and coarse system configuration 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.140
 OK 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.060
 and here finally you have to go into 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.500
 cards and this is the option to which 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.440
 you have to enter cards without finding 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.390
 this option cards 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:15.010
 once you are here you have to 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:18.870
 type the following combination of 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:18.870
 keys m 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.280
 of if he had introduced it well we 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.159
 would have to appear this window that you 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:30.250
 I just showed ok once beach is 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:32.850
 introduced you have to enter another 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:39.070
 new combination that is the following 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:42.280
 mtv2 high and then disappears from 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:46.289
 enter you have to put this write 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.289
 code me what is 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:52.100
 then we would have to include 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.659
 this code 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:57.420
 I'm going to spin it here for what 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:02:00.649
 so you can see how good the following is 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.649
 or are you going to see what is this 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:08.160
 the code is unique for each 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:14.680
 for each blackberry and here as you can see 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:19.240
 I have introduced is the same 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.240
 then it will be given to the intro 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:27.670
 code accepted right now I have my 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.290
 released blackberry good as you know 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.150

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.790
 finished i have my blackberry totally 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.710

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:39.520
 minutes he looked very blackberry with 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.350
 the previous tutorial which is what 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.540
 I'll leave it here up or down in 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:45.220
