00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:53.260 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.360 

and<00:00:53.399> I<00:00:54.399> probably<00:00:55.030> won't<00:00:55.269> record<00:00:55.780> all<00:00:56.230> the

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
and I probably won't record all the

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.060 
and I probably won't record all the
explosion<00:00:57.370> parts<00:00:58.120> because<00:00:58.629> i'm<00:00:59.589> sure<00:00:59.890> my

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:00.070 
explosion parts because i'm sure my

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:01.319 
explosion parts because i'm sure my
computer<00:01:00.489> is<00:01:00.579> going<00:01:00.640> to<00:01:00.760> start<00:01:00.909> lagging

00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:01.329 
computer is going to start lagging

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:03.779 
computer is going to start lagging
because<00:01:01.449> look<00:01:01.750> how<00:01:01.809> much<00:01:01.989> T&amp;T<00:01:02.409> this<00:01:02.649> is<00:01:02.859> this

00:01:03.779 --> 00:01:03.789 
because look how much T&amp;T this is this

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:07.620 
because look how much T&amp;T this is this
is<00:01:03.969> massive<00:01:05.520> so<00:01:06.520> which<00:01:06.700> house<00:01:06.970> we<00:01:07.299> want<00:01:07.509> to

the sky is falling the world has come to
an<00:02:24.300> end<00:02:24.390> anyways

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:32.570 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:37.970 

more<00:02:33.570> I<00:02:34.790> mean<00:02:35.790> I'm<00:02:35.940> surprised<00:02:36.650> you<00:02:37.650> can<00:02:37.770> tell

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
more I mean I'm surprised you can tell

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.150 
more I mean I'm surprised you can tell
I've<00:02:38.100> fog<00:02:38.340> on<00:02:38.580> pretty<00:02:38.850> pretty<00:02:39.690> high<00:02:39.930> I<00:02:40.290> wanted

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
I've fog on pretty pretty high I wanted

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.650 
I've fog on pretty pretty high I wanted
to<00:02:41.220> keep<00:02:41.310> the<00:02:41.460> frame<00:02:41.640> rate<00:02:41.820> at<00:02:41.970> least<00:02:42.120> somewhat

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
to keep the frame rate at least somewhat

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:52.220 
to keep the frame rate at least somewhat
decent<00:02:50.210> when<00:02:51.210> I<00:02:51.240> was<00:02:51.390> she<00:02:51.570> into<00:02:51.810> this<00:02:51.930> is<00:02:52.110> I

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
decent when I was she into this is I

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:58.340 
decent when I was she into this is I
really<00:02:52.380> don't<00:02:52.620> know<00:02:54.830> but<00:02:55.830> it<00:02:56.010> took<00:02:56.190> forever<00:02:57.350> to

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
really don't know but it took forever to

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:10.910 
really don't know but it took forever to
place<00:02:59.720> forever

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.420 

so<00:03:11.920> look<00:03:12.010> at<00:03:12.100> a<00:03:12.130> sky<00:03:12.580> view<00:03:13.560> above<00:03:14.560> see<00:03:15.190> how<00:03:15.280> it

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
so look at a sky view above see how it

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:20.290 
so look at a sky view above see how it
looks

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:20.300 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.690 

so<00:03:20.930> what<00:03:21.080> happens<00:03:21.470> is<00:03:21.620> the<00:03:21.770> fire<00:03:21.950> spreads<00:03:22.460> and

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
so what happens is the fire spreads and

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.610 
so what happens is the fire spreads and
catches<00:03:23.000> the<00:03:23.180> other<00:03:23.270> TNT<00:03:23.810> and<00:03:23.960> fire<00:03:24.290> and<00:03:24.470> they

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620 
catches the other TNT and fire and they

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:26.500 
catches the other TNT and fire and they
fall<00:03:24.890> and<00:03:25.160> then<00:03:25.250> that<00:03:25.430> catches<00:03:25.730> the<00:03:25.850> other<00:03:25.970> TNT

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
fall and then that catches the other TNT

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:30.400 
fall and then that catches the other TNT
and<00:03:26.630> fire<00:03:26.990> then<00:03:27.350> it<00:03:27.530> falls<00:03:28.450> but<00:03:29.450> this<00:03:29.630> balance

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
and fire then it falls but this balance

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:33.880 
and fire then it falls but this balance
can<00:03:30.650> be<00:03:30.820> disrupted<00:03:31.820> if<00:03:32.000> a<00:03:32.720> TNT<00:03:33.230> catches<00:03:33.740> on

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:33.890 
can be disrupted if a TNT catches on

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:36.910 
can be disrupted if a TNT catches on
fire<00:03:34.070> too<00:03:34.370> fast<00:03:34.700> and<00:03:35.000> it<00:03:35.060> explodes<00:03:35.800> then<00:03:36.800> this

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:36.920 
fire too fast and it explodes then this

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.370 
fire too fast and it explodes then this
whole<00:03:37.130> wall<00:03:37.400> will<00:03:37.820> explode<00:03:38.270> in<00:03:38.540> the<00:03:38.990> game<00:03:39.230> will

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:39.380 
whole wall will explode in the game will

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:42.370 
whole wall will explode in the game will
