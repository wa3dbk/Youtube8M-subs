 discover in this tutorial how 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.640
 apply the adhesive lipstick e 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.640
 make the make up or cabinato 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.530
 spread the special glue on the lips 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.320
 that we find in the packaging of ours 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.240
 sticky lipstick we pay attention to 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.720
 spread it over the entire surface of the 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.430
 our lips and without drooling we wait 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.390
 two minutes until we see it 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.740
 white glue becomes transparent 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.359
 we take our adhesive sheet and it 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.660
 we lay on our lips from the 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.790
 non-colored part we begin to spread 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.860
 well the sheet by pressing on the lips in 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.350
 so that it adheres well and moves 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.000
 completely on the mouth 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.890
 we hold firm with a finger an act of the 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.289
 adhesive sheet while with the other hand 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.090
 we tear it vigorously and if one 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.950
 once the sheet is removed we still have 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.579
 adhesive residue around the 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.110
 mouth 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:57.270
 we can correct them by trying to 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:59.010
 take them away with a sponge we take 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.020
 a soft brush and a lilac eye shadow 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.210

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:07.320

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:09.180

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.740
 fuchs and with a flat brush it 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.869
 we apply on the external corner of the 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:18.090
 movable eyelid blending towards the 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:19.229

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.630
