screen<00:02:44.129> and<00:02:44.400> number<00:02:44.640> 20<00:02:44.909> screen<00:02:45.209> I'm<00:02:46.079> gonna

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260

a<00:02:49.140> little<00:02:49.230> better<00:02:49.530> by<00:02:49.709> size<00:02:50.010> that<00:02:50.400> makes<00:02:50.579> it

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
a little better by size that makes it

00:02:50.730 --> 00:03:09.229 
a little better by size that makes it
easier<00:02:50.970> pan<00:02:51.209> out<00:03:07.609> as<00:03:08.609> you<00:03:08.790> can<00:03:08.909> see<00:03:09.060> I've<00:03:09.150> got

the<00:03:09.329> screen<00:03:09.599> stacked<00:03:10.019> here<00:03:10.290> it<00:03:11.069> just<00:03:11.280> makes<00:03:11.819> it

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
the screen stacked here it just makes it

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:23.050 
the screen stacked here it just makes it
easier<00:03:12.269> to<00:03:12.329> do<00:03:12.450> everything<00:03:12.690> in<00:03:12.959> one<00:03:12.989> step<00:03:13.409> the

classified into +8 h20 and everything

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:06.560 
classified into +8 h20 and everything
the<00:04:03.700> bucket<00:04:04.000> is<00:04:04.090> March<00:04:04.360> 20<00:04:04.810> the<00:04:04.990> next<00:04:05.530> step

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:06.570 
the bucket is March 20 the next step

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:09.660 
the bucket is March 20 the next step
pan<00:04:07.570> them<00:04:07.720> all<00:04:07.810> out<00:04:08.220> all<00:04:09.220> right

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
next step is to add pan it

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.770 
next step is to add pan it
I<00:04:13.840> even<00:04:14.290> though<00:04:14.410> this<00:04:14.470> is<00:04:14.650> a<00:04:14.680> big<00:04:14.860> stuff<00:04:15.780> came

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:51.310 
let's now go on to the plus 20s go

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:52.380 
let's now go on to the plus 20s go
through<00:04:51.460> that<00:04:51.550> a<00:04:51.610> little<00:04:51.670> bit<00:04:51.910> slower<00:04:52.210> because

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:52.390 
through that a little bit slower because

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:54.720 
through that a little bit slower because
there<00:04:52.720> is<00:04:53.590> a<00:04:53.620> chance<00:04:53.890> of<00:04:54.100> something<00:04:54.310> being<00:04:54.610> in

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:54.730
