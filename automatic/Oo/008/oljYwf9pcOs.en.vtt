00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
if you best-case scenario you try to

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.520 
if you best-case scenario you try to
reverse<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:41.969> position<00:00:42.420> and<00:00:42.780> get<00:00:42.930> on<00:00:43.020> his<00:00:43.230> six

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.110 
reverse the position and get on his six
but<00:00:44.010> it's<00:00:44.190> not<00:00:44.309> the<00:00:44.399> easiest<00:00:44.579> thing<00:00:44.670> to<00:00:44.760> do<00:00:44.969> we

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
but it's not the easiest thing to do we

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.100 
but it's not the easiest thing to do we
see<00:00:45.300> right<00:00:45.420> here<00:00:45.480> I<00:00:45.570> take<00:00:45.719> a<00:00:45.750> hit<00:00:45.930> from<00:00:45.989> a

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
see right here I take a hit from a

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.650 
see right here I take a hit from a
missile<00:00:46.440> but<00:00:46.890> I<00:00:47.489> think<00:00:48.149> you<00:00:48.210> could<00:00:48.300> take<00:00:48.450> up

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
missile but I think you could take up

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.910 
missile but I think you could take up
two<00:00:48.960> or<00:00:49.170> three<00:00:49.379> hits<00:00:49.559> my<00:00:50.489> missiles<00:00:50.910> and<00:00:51.920> still

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
two or three hits my missiles and still

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.729 
two or three hits my missiles and still
be<00:00:53.039> alright<00:00:53.480> your<00:00:54.480> flying<00:00:55.230> is<00:00:55.379> kind<00:00:55.680> of

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
be alright your flying is kind of

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:56.779 
be alright your flying is kind of
hindered<00:00:56.039> a<00:00:56.100> little<00:00:56.340> bit<00:00:56.430> when<00:00:56.550> you're<00:00:56.610> down

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.599 
hindered a little bit when you're down
below<00:00:57.030> 50%<00:00:57.329> but<00:00:58.140> it<00:00:58.500> does<00:00:58.710> recover<00:00:59.129> if<00:00:59.430> you

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
below 50% but it does recover if you

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.729 
below 50% but it does recover if you
don't<00:00:59.820> take<00:01:00.180> any<00:01:00.390> more<00:01:00.539> damage<00:01:00.840> and<00:01:01.170> you<00:01:01.530> can

slowing<00:01:21.960> down<00:01:22.140> it<00:01:22.470> allowed<00:01:22.680> him<00:01:22.860> to<00:01:23.009> overshoot

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
slowing down it allowed him to overshoot

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.609 
slowing down it allowed him to overshoot
me<00:01:23.850> and<00:01:24.060> by<00:01:24.479> overshooting<00:01:24.990> me<00:01:25.110> it<00:01:25.229> puts<00:01:25.439> me

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
me and by overshooting me it puts me

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.530 
me and by overshooting me it puts me
right<00:01:25.650> in<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.220> driver's<00:01:26.549> seat<00:01:26.580> on<00:01:26.850> his<00:01:27.030> six

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
right in the driver's seat on his six

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.690 
right in the driver's seat on his six
and<00:01:27.840> that's<00:01:28.740> right<00:01:29.070> where<00:01:29.189> you<00:01:29.280> want<00:01:29.430> to<00:01:29.490> be<00:01:29.579> as

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
and that's right where you want to be as

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.200 
and that's right where you want to be as
a<00:01:31.280> jet<00:01:32.280> fighter<00:01:32.490> you<00:01:32.700> want<00:01:32.820> to<00:01:32.909> be<00:01:32.970> on<00:01:33.090> your

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
a jet fighter you want to be on your

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.690 
a jet fighter you want to be on your
enemies<00:01:33.509> 6<00:01:33.840> at<00:01:34.020> all<00:01:34.140> times<00:01:34.500> and<00:01:34.860> that's<00:01:35.400> really

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
enemies 6 at all times and that's really

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.270 
enemies 6 at all times and that's really
what<00:01:35.880> it<00:01:35.970> allowed<00:01:36.150> me<00:01:36.299> to<00:01:36.329> do<00:01:36.479> by<00:01:36.630> slowing<00:01:36.990> down

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
what it allowed me to do by slowing down

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.980 
what it allowed me to do by slowing down
it<00:01:38.280> allows<00:01:38.549> me<00:01:38.729> to<00:01:38.790> take<00:01:38.850> these<00:01:39.000> sharper<00:01:39.600> turns

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
it allows me to take these sharper turns

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.069 
it allows me to take these sharper turns
and<00:01:40.350> like<00:01:40.829> he'll<00:01:41.640> overshoot<00:01:42.270> he's<00:01:42.720> running

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
and like he'll overshoot he's running

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.260 
and like he'll overshoot he's running
his<00:01:43.170> thrusters<00:01:43.560> right<00:01:43.710> here<00:01:43.920> and<00:01:44.149> kind<00:01:45.149> of<00:01:45.180> a

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
his thrusters right here and kind of a

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.910 
his thrusters right here and kind of a
rookie<00:01:45.420> mistake<00:01:45.659> but<00:01:46.110> you<00:01:46.259> see<00:01:46.409> a<00:01:46.439> lot<00:01:46.649> of<00:01:46.680> that

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
rookie mistake but you see a lot of that

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.969 
rookie mistake but you see a lot of that
online<00:01:47.100> you<00:01:47.729> see<00:01:47.909> here<00:01:48.060> I<00:01:48.090> switched<00:01:48.450> over<00:01:48.600> to<00:01:48.979> I

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
online you see here I switched over to I

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.889 
online you see here I switched over to I
switched<00:01:50.610> over<00:01:50.670> to<00:01:50.820> heat-seeking<00:01:51.090> missiles<00:01:51.720> I

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
switched over to heat-seeking missiles I

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.380 
switched over to heat-seeking missiles I
get<00:01:52.649> the<00:01:52.770> two<00:01:53.100> hits<00:01:53.310> right<00:01:53.490> there<00:01:53.790> I<00:01:54.000> almost

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
get the two hits right there I almost

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.359 
get the two hits right there I almost
find<00:01:54.810> a<00:01:55.110> jet<00:01:55.470> ramming<00:01:55.710> that<00:01:55.829> guy<00:01:55.950> another

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
find a jet ramming that guy another

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:57.800 
find a jet ramming that guy another
thing<00:01:56.520> you<00:01:56.610> guys<00:01:56.670> want<00:01:56.880> to<00:01:56.939> do<00:01:57.030> is<00:01:57.180> don't<00:01:57.390> just

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
thing you guys want to do is don't just

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.260 
thing you guys want to do is don't just
rely<00:01:58.140> on<00:01:58.170> your<00:01:58.799> air-to-air<00:01:59.520> missiles<00:02:00.030> I<00:02:00.210> know

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
rely on your air-to-air missiles I know

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.789 
rely on your air-to-air missiles I know
that's<00:02:00.630> a<00:02:00.689> huge<00:02:00.899> tendency<00:02:01.409> to<00:02:01.560> do<00:02:01.649> want

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
that's a huge tendency to do want

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.260 
that's a huge tendency to do want
everybody<00:02:02.310> to<00:02:02.399> get<00:02:02.460> in<00:02:02.549> the<00:02:02.610> jet<00:02:02.759> I<00:02:02.790> think<00:02:03.030> to

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
everybody to get in the jet I think to

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.999 
everybody to get in the jet I think to
lock-on<00:02:03.659> missiles<00:02:03.990> is<00:02:04.320> what<00:02:04.500> they<00:02:04.619> need<00:02:04.649> to<00:02:04.860> do

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
lock-on missiles is what they need to do

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.160 
lock-on missiles is what they need to do
but<00:02:05.579> definitely<00:02:06.479> need<00:02:06.570> to<00:02:06.659> finish<00:02:06.810> people<00:02:07.079> off

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
but definitely need to finish people off

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.600 
but definitely need to finish people off
with<00:02:07.350> your<00:02:07.500> with<00:02:07.740> your<00:02:07.860> machine<00:02:07.979> gun<00:02:08.399> with

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
with your with your machine gun with

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.369 
with your with your machine gun with
your<00:02:08.819> gonna<00:02:09.330> see<00:02:09.539> if<00:02:09.660> he<00:02:09.780> bails<00:02:10.020> out<00:02:10.200> right

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
your gonna see if he bails out right

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.920 
your gonna see if he bails out right
there<00:02:10.530> he<00:02:10.739> knows<00:02:10.920> he<00:02:11.190> is<00:02:11.220> finish

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
there he knows he is finish

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.990 
there he knows he is finish
but<00:02:13.410> basically<00:02:14.070> it's<00:02:14.220> all<00:02:14.370> it<00:02:14.520> takes<00:02:14.730> to<00:02:14.850> get<00:02:14.940> a

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
but basically it's all it takes to get a

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.820 
but basically it's all it takes to get a
kill<00:02:15.270> it's<00:02:15.690> really<00:02:15.930> cool<00:02:16.170> another<00:02:16.620> thing<00:02:16.770> you

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
kill it's really cool another thing you

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.260 
kill it's really cool another thing you
just<00:02:16.860> want<00:02:16.980> to<00:02:17.130> do<00:02:17.250> is<00:02:17.400> you<00:02:17.490> see<00:02:17.700> out<00:02:17.970> here<00:02:18.000> or

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
just want to do is you see out here or

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:19.910 
just want to do is you see out here or
that<00:02:18.360> after<00:02:19.080> I<00:02:19.110> get<00:02:19.230> this<00:02:19.350> kill<00:02:19.560> I<00:02:19.680> take<00:02:19.830> this

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
that after I get this kill I take this

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.480 
that after I get this kill I take this
long<00:02:20.340> kind<00:02:20.820> of<00:02:21.030> boring<00:02:21.840> run<00:02:22.500> out<00:02:22.800> to<00:02:23.340> mill

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
long kind of boring run out to mill

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:25.250 
long kind of boring run out to mill
nowhere<00:02:23.940> that's<00:02:24.480> how<00:02:24.600> you<00:02:24.660> set<00:02:24.870> yourself<00:02:24.960> up

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
nowhere that's how you set yourself up

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.260 
nowhere that's how you set yourself up
for<00:02:25.320> the<00:02:25.530> longest<00:02:25.980> hack<00:02:26.220> runs<00:02:26.520> since<00:02:27.090> you<00:02:27.150> see

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
for the longest hack runs since you see

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:28.880 
for the longest hack runs since you see
here<00:02:27.480> I'm<00:02:27.600> just<00:02:27.780> kind<00:02:27.930> of<00:02:28.050> wandering<00:02:28.620> off<00:02:28.800> in

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
here I'm just kind of wandering off in

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.140 
here I'm just kind of wandering off in
the<00:02:28.950> distance<00:02:29.100> so<00:02:29.550> I<00:02:29.610> can<00:02:29.760> line<00:02:29.970> this

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
the distance so I can line this

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.580 
the distance so I can line this
helicopter<00:02:30.660> up<00:02:30.750> and<00:02:30.930> I<00:02:30.960> see<00:02:31.140> it<00:02:31.200> on<00:02:31.260> my<00:02:31.350> radar

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
helicopter up and I see it on my radar

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.010 
helicopter up and I see it on my radar
and<00:02:31.830> now<00:02:32.160> I<00:02:32.190> have<00:02:32.430> enough<00:02:32.610> time<00:02:32.940> to<00:02:33.600> line<00:02:33.840> this

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
and now I have enough time to line this

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:35.900 
and now I have enough time to line this
helicopter<00:02:34.320> up<00:02:34.590> for<00:02:34.830> a<00:02:34.860> strafe<00:02:35.340> run<00:02:35.640> and

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
helicopter up for a strafe run and

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.670 
helicopter up for a strafe run and
that's<00:02:36.450> how<00:02:36.690> you<00:02:36.750> do<00:02:36.960> that<00:02:37.140> you<00:02:37.230> take<00:02:37.350> a<00:02:37.380> long

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
that's how you do that you take a long

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.200 
that's how you do that you take a long
run<00:02:37.950> you<00:02:38.130> kind<00:02:38.310> of<00:02:38.340> turn<00:02:38.520> around<00:02:38.550> we<00:02:39.000> kind<00:02:39.150> of

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.210 
run you kind of turn around we kind of

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.090 
run you kind of turn around we kind of
go<00:02:39.270> slowly<00:02:39.570> you<00:02:40.200> can<00:02:40.350> line<00:02:40.530> these<00:02:40.650> shots<00:02:40.950> up

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
go slowly you can line these shots up

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:42.440 
go slowly you can line these shots up
very<00:02:41.340> easily<00:02:41.520> and<00:02:41.790> you're<00:02:41.910> taking<00:02:42.360> these

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
very easily and you're taking these

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.720 
very easily and you're taking these
things<00:02:42.630> down<00:02:42.780> with<00:02:43.380> ease<00:02:43.710> not<00:02:43.980> a<00:02:44.040> problem<00:02:44.610> as

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
things down with ease not a problem as

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:45.650 
things down with ease not a problem as
you<00:02:44.760> start<00:02:45.030> there<00:02:45.210> I<00:02:45.240> dropped<00:02:45.570> that

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
you start there I dropped that

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.620 
you start there I dropped that
helicopter<00:02:46.260> know<00:02:46.740> how<00:02:46.830> to<00:02:46.890> problem<00:02:47.540> you<00:02:48.540> know

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
helicopter know how to problem you know
