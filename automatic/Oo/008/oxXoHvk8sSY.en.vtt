00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.419
 asked me what that is, if I'm the one 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.560

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:35.280
 could imagine 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:37.500

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.510

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.519
 Of course Katyn is the third part 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.739

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:57.840
 yes has been ordered from switzerland 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:01.109
 is a small special edition I know 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.219
 not if you know her like that at all 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.410
 I once pointed out by random 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.390
 I really liked it 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:07.980
 and that's why I became then 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.630
 this edition decided 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:12.120
 yes and I'll just show you 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.790
 because as I said I have yet 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:17.250
 not boxed and shown to you somehow 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.440
 I do not know anything about it yet 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:24.480
 Come and I would like to see you guys 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:26.490
 let's show you a lot of fun, yes and that 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:28.260
 is also the good thing about what it is 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:32.700
 act and what the band saw here 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:34.260
 this is my private collection and 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.750
 we can see here and read 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:39.330
 we have here predator 12 and presenter 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.670
 three of course in this action 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:43.770
 contain 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:46.350
 The outer packaging is of course something 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.060
 very reasonably priced and we have 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.190
 between viewport and with the 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.750
 Of course, the view window is the credita 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:54.060
 mask included 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.490
 I accessed at that time because of me 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.190
 this edition was really cool and because 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:03.210
 that really in the low cost 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:05.280
 Variation was with this design and then 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.920
 of course in this cool outfit 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.670
 or with the bright design was not 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.150
 really cool 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:14.430
 So I found or I think she sees 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.290
 just really cool and really cool 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.860
 makes something in any case 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.940
 of the page 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.190
 Of course we can meet again here 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.650
 for data collection that we have 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.810
 of course the ultimate or ultimate 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:28.240
 hunter edition then we have of course 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:31.180
 here the uncut version of 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:33.370
 Predator 2 and of course the FKS 18 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:36.970
 version of the third part and the 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:40.690
 recent part predators back again 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.980
 briefly explained that we completely again 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.959
 uncut version stands 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.970
 uncut version uncut 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:48.400
 I would just say 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:49.290
 I'll just open up and 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.540
 Show you the version 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:54.220
 if you have the complete packaging 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.520
 find it around like one 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.660
 student damages from silly ones 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:00.220
 leaflet for advertising the crash 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:02.739
 quit a little bit because I am well 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.959
 the edition ship was cut here 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:07.120
 is again explicitly on the alien 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:09.010
 editions on the new led landfill 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.510
 then it came out with the alien corner 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.400
 they are already ready in my 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.770
 possess and with this relief 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.450
 slipcase where all the anthology movies of 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:16.840
 alien are in it and so on and so on 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:18.850
 on 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.880
 here is again listed senses 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:24.190
 ethical pointed out to me there's also 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.799
 from predators this in the Jewish 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:28.780
 believe that here also the dvd edition 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:30.760
 still with such an extended cut but has 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.739
 me next to already because here this 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.810
 extended version was not on blu ray 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:36.400
 the mix bit so annoyed yes then 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:39.010
 Of course you have the one here 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.970
 leaflets from predators and there 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.920
 we can also go directly to the 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:43.600
 technical data go as you can see 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:47.590
 we can have the uncut here 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:49.959
 with 107 minutes and a 5.1 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:52.570
 dts hd master audio track in german 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:54.340
 of course subtitles and of course each one 

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:56.440
 amount of bonus material as you can see 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:59.170
 which I am really very cool 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:00.610
 find halo between at predator 2 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:01.120
 of course, the uncut 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:03.840
 version 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:07.269
 here we have 108 minutes also one 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:10.330
 english and german soundtrack in 5.1 

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:13.810
 dts in English, however, in hd master 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:17.019
 audio dts at predators the youngest 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:19.959
 project from the predator series we have 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:24.280
 here a run of 107 minutes but 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:27.970
 also a 5.1 dts 5.1 5.1 dts german 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:28.990
 soundtrack and an English dts hd master 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:30.430
 audio track 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:31.840
 So here you have 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:33.220
 also a bit of bonus material here 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:35.020
 but not like the ultimate 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:37.510
 hunter edition the ultimate hunter 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:38.500
 Of course, I still have an edition separately 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:40.530
 on blu ray 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:43.000
 I bought them with the result but 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:45.970
 I thought that was a really great one 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.570
 alternative to all three parts in possession 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:50.590
 to have 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:53.170
 the mask itself is from a very 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:54.400
 Stable plastic molded looks 

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:58.060
 maybe not really detail 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:05:00.280
 true to detail but still on everyone 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:04.630
 Be a watcher and be on everyone 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:06.550
 case cool and looks from behind 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:09.040
 So they are all three discs 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:11.080
 in it and it's really just about it 

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:12.520
 so that one sees from the front and from 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:14.110
 front looks the reality 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.180
 yes, if you open the times 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:18.940
 however, we made it relatively simple 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:22.990
 Of course we have Predator 1 die 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:24.990
 ultimate ultimate hunter edition fsk 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:29.260
 16 uncut 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:32.670
 then here we have the predator 2 and 

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:36.820
 course on the left side predators 

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:38.770
 fsk 18 and more or less what that 

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:41.350
 Actually, but I have to 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:43.300
 to say honestly as I said I believe 

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:46.480
 Not everyone has this edition 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:48.870
 and yes that was the unboxing and that 

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:51.520
 I give back in the studio 

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:53.590
 yes then I'm back again and 

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:56.200
 that was my unboxing to prey data 

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:57.940
 collection and I hope you have it 

00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:00.520
 I like to say thumbs up 

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:02.500
 for what I now in the end for the 

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:05.500
 I no longer have paid for the box 

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:07.630
 believe in the 7 340 euro interest as I said 

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:08.980
 all three parts in it and I can do this 

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:10.870
 box in any case only warmly 

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:12.280
 recommend and clear thumbs up and 

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:14.560
 Clear purchase decisions when the 

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:16.270
 possibility has this box times 

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:18.760
 dust off or still get 

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:21.070
 I grant you that, and I know 

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:22.960
 not if it is this box at all yet 

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:25.240
 there and no idea 

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:29.199
 definitely 

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:31.300
 in that sense, that was it from me and 

00:06:29.199 --> 00:06:35.130
 you something and stay healthy euro 

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:35.130
 Andy's movies look good
