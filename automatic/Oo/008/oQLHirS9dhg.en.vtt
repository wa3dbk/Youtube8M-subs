nothing now the boost kicks in

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.249 
nothing now the boost kicks in
it's<00:01:50.759> nothing<00:01:51.390> like<00:01:51.689> a<00:01:51.719> naturally<00:01:52.229> aspirated

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
it's nothing like a naturally aspirated

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.160 
it's nothing like a naturally aspirated
car<00:01:53.130> it<00:01:53.369> can<00:01:53.640> be<00:01:53.789> fun<00:01:54.060> feeling<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.719> boost<00:01:54.930> kick

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.080 
car it can be fun feeling the boost kick
in<00:01:55.350> I'll<00:01:55.530> agree<00:01:55.829> with<00:01:56.039> that<00:01:56.189> but<00:01:56.850> if<00:01:56.969> you're

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
in I'll agree with that but if you're

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.149 
in I'll agree with that but if you're
