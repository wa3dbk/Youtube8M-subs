in<00:01:27.400> few<00:01:27.729> seconds<00:01:28.240> so<00:01:28.780> the<00:01:28.900> first<00:01:29.080> strategy<00:01:29.380> is

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:29.680 
in few seconds so the first strategy is

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.859 
in few seconds so the first strategy is
the<00:01:29.890> easiest<00:01:30.280> one<00:01:30.640> and<00:01:30.850> most<00:01:31.030> people<00:01:31.450> use<00:01:31.659> it

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:31.869 
the easiest one and most people use it

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:34.380 
the easiest one and most people use it
you<00:01:32.140> simply<00:01:32.320> flee<00:01:32.860> from<00:01:33.159> the<00:01:33.580> bottle<00:01:33.970> so<00:01:34.360> you

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:34.390 
you simply flee from the bottle so you

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.929 
you simply flee from the bottle so you
teleport<00:01:34.930> outside<00:01:35.320> with<00:01:35.590> your<00:01:35.680> g<00:01:35.920> GS<00:01:36.250> and<00:01:36.490> you

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:36.939 
teleport outside with your g GS and you

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:38.609 
teleport outside with your g GS and you
wait<00:01:37.119> until<00:01:37.299> the<00:01:37.630> skillet<00:01:37.990> and<00:01:38.020> disappear

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:38.619 
wait until the skillet and disappear

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:42.359 
wait until the skillet and disappear
before<00:01:38.799> entering<00:01:39.280> the<00:01:39.460> room<00:01:39.790> once<00:01:40.180> again<00:01:41.369> ok

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:42.369 
before entering the room once again ok

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:43.710 
before entering the room once again ok
so<00:01:42.430> now<00:01:42.670> let's<00:01:42.700> talk<00:01:43.030> about<00:01:43.119> the<00:01:43.270> second

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:43.720 
so now let's talk about the second

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.170 
so now let's talk about the second
strategy<00:01:43.990> to<00:01:44.409> DD<00:01:44.710> spot<00:01:45.100> so<00:01:45.579> it's<00:01:45.729> the<00:01:45.850> most

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:46.180 
strategy to DD spot so it's the most

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.090 
strategy to DD spot so it's the most
efficient<00:01:46.720> one<00:01:46.930> but<00:01:47.259> it's<00:01:47.409> also<00:01:47.710> the<00:01:48.070> most

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
efficient one but it's also the most

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.280 
efficient one but it's also the most
dangerous<00:01:48.790> one<00:01:49.149> so<00:01:49.600> first<00:01:49.899> of<00:01:49.990> all<00:01:50.049> they<00:01:50.170> will

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:50.290 
dangerous one so first of all they will

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:51.899 
dangerous one so first of all they will
be<00:01:50.470> a<00:01:50.500> tank<00:01:50.860> that<00:01:50.979> will<00:01:51.100> be<00:01:51.250> protected<00:01:51.460> from

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:51.909 
be a tank that will be protected from

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:53.880 
be a tank that will be protected from
Mellie<00:01:52.240> you<00:01:52.540> can<00:01:52.720> also<00:01:52.869> use<00:01:53.049> thermal<00:01:53.560> and

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
Mellie you can also use thermal and

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.670 
Mellie you can also use thermal and
leech<00:01:54.070> defense<00:01:54.729> if<00:01:55.180> you<00:01:55.329> really<00:01:55.630> want<00:01:55.840> and<00:01:56.079> it

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:56.680 
leech defense if you really want and it

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.039 
leech defense if you really want and it
for<00:01:57.070> other<00:01:57.220> players<00:01:57.549> will<00:01:57.909> be<00:01:58.090> using<00:01:58.299> range<00:01:58.810> or

00:01:59.039 --> 00:01:59.049 
for other players will be using range or

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:01.109 
for other players will be using range or
magic<00:01:59.710> so<00:02:00.159> the<00:02:00.280> goal<00:02:00.430> of<00:02:00.549> the<00:02:00.670> tank<00:02:00.939> is<00:02:01.090> to

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:01.119 
magic so the goal of the tank is to

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:04.050 
magic so the goal of the tank is to
protect<00:02:01.689> the<00:02:01.840> range<00:02:02.140> and<00:02:02.380> mages<00:02:03.340> and<00:02:03.520> a<00:02:03.909> goal

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
protect the range and mages and a goal

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:05.880 
protect the range and mages and a goal
of<00:02:04.180> the<00:02:04.299> range<00:02:04.540> and<00:02:04.630> the<00:02:04.750> mages<00:02:05.110> is<00:02:05.290> to<00:02:05.439> damage

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
of the range and the mages is to damage

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.219 
of the range and the mages is to damage
the<00:02:06.130> box<00:02:06.369> it's<00:02:07.030> very<00:02:07.210> important<00:02:07.719> that<00:02:07.750> all<00:02:08.049> the

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
the box it's very important that all the

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.199 
the box it's very important that all the
range<00:02:08.470> and<00:02:08.619> mages<00:02:09.130> or<00:02:09.250> located<00:02:09.640> in<00:02:09.759> the<00:02:09.880> same

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 
range and mages or located in the same

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:12.030 
range and mages or located in the same
spot<00:02:10.390> like<00:02:10.780> I<00:02:10.899> shown<00:02:11.110> a<00:02:11.260> picture<00:02:11.470> it's<00:02:11.920> also

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
spot like I shown a picture it's also

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.490 
spot like I shown a picture it's also
important<00:02:12.610> that<00:02:12.640> the<00:02:12.820> tank<00:02:13.090> is<00:02:13.239> right<00:02:13.540> yeah<00:02:13.959> so

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
important that the tank is right yeah so

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.199 
important that the tank is right yeah so
as<00:02:14.590> you<00:02:14.650> can<00:02:14.770> see<00:02:14.950> is<00:02:15.129> blocking<00:02:15.580> the<00:02:15.610> skeletons

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209 
as you can see is blocking the skeletons

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:18.210 
as you can see is blocking the skeletons
and<00:02:16.390> only<00:02:16.900> two<00:02:17.200> of<00:02:17.230> them<00:02:17.530> can<00:02:17.770> attack<00:02:18.069> the

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
and only two of them can attack the

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.640 
and only two of them can attack the
tanker

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
tanker

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.710 
tanker
the<00:02:18.799> same<00:02:19.069> time<00:02:19.250> so<00:02:19.730> he<00:02:19.790> doesn't<00:02:19.970> lose<00:02:20.390> that

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
the same time so he doesn't lose that

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:26.319 
the same time so he doesn't lose that
much<00:02:21.019> shelf<00:02:24.370> okay<00:02:25.370> so<00:02:25.610> first<00:02:25.819> of<00:02:26.000> all<00:02:26.060> enter

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:26.329 
much shelf okay so first of all enter

00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:28.059 
much shelf okay so first of all enter
the<00:02:26.360> bathroom<00:02:26.930> and<00:02:27.049> then<00:02:27.170> use<00:02:27.379> hurt<00:02:27.799> spell

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:28.069 
the bathroom and then use hurt spell

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:30.309 
the bathroom and then use hurt spell
tuition<00:02:28.640> I<00:02:28.819> know<00:02:29.180> that<00:02:29.329> rain<00:02:29.510> is<00:02:29.540> faster<00:02:30.110> but

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:30.319 
tuition I know that rain is faster but

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:32.770 
tuition I know that rain is faster but
anyway<00:02:30.650> hurt<00:02:30.829> spell<00:02:31.069> or<00:02:31.250> good<00:02:31.459> too<00:02:31.790> so<00:02:32.390> keep<00:02:32.569> at

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
anyway hurt spell or good too so keep at

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.690 
anyway hurt spell or good too so keep at
handling<00:02:33.140> the<00:02:33.349> bus<00:02:33.500> and<00:02:33.739> eventually<00:02:34.280> the<00:02:34.459> tank

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
handling the bus and eventually the tank

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.569 
handling the bus and eventually the tank
will<00:02:34.879> come<00:02:35.120> and<00:02:35.269> say<00:02:35.510> DD<00:02:35.810> so<00:02:36.500> everybody<00:02:37.310> will

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:37.579 
will come and say DD so everybody will

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:39.670 
will come and say DD so everybody will
go<00:02:37.790> in<00:02:37.879> the<00:02:38.000> same<00:02:38.269> spot<00:02:38.450> right<00:02:38.780> there<00:02:38.810> so<00:02:39.560> it's

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
go in the same spot right there so it's

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.160 
go in the same spot right there so it's
very<00:02:39.769> important<00:02:40.340> you<00:02:40.400> must<00:02:40.700> be<00:02:41.329> at<00:02:41.510> that<00:02:41.810> spot

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
very important you must be at that spot

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:43.990 
very important you must be at that spot
if<00:02:42.319> you<00:02:42.409> go<00:02:42.650> away<00:02:42.739> all<00:02:43.069> the<00:02:43.280> strategy<00:02:43.760> will<00:02:43.879> be

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
if you go away all the strategy will be

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.270 
if you go away all the strategy will be
all<00:02:44.209> messed<00:02:44.540> up<00:02:44.689> so<00:02:45.349> eventually<00:02:45.620> will<00:02:46.010> summon

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
all messed up so eventually will summon

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.699 
all messed up so eventually will summon
5<00:02:46.670> skeletons<00:02:47.180> and<00:02:47.420> you<00:02:48.170> simply<00:02:48.439> keep

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
5 skeletons and you simply keep

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:50.949 
5 skeletons and you simply keep
attacking<00:02:49.040> the<00:02:49.310> bus<00:02:49.459> the<00:02:49.819> strategy<00:02:50.090> all<00:02:50.629> them

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
attacking the bus the strategy all them

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:53.770 
attacking the bus the strategy all them
work<00:02:51.530> will<00:02:51.739> be<00:02:51.889> for<00:02:52.129> the<00:02:52.190> tanker<00:02:52.909> so<00:02:53.389> we'll<00:02:53.540> try

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
work will be for the tanker so we'll try

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.920 
work will be for the tanker so we'll try
to<00:02:53.840> attack<00:02:54.409> the<00:02:55.060> skeletons<00:02:56.060> in<00:02:56.269> order<00:02:56.540> to<00:02:56.780> get

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
to attack the skeletons in order to get

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.559 
to attack the skeletons in order to get
their<00:02:57.079> attention<00:02:57.230> so<00:02:58.010> you<00:02:58.069> don't<00:02:58.519> get<00:02:58.700> hit<00:02:58.909> but

00:02:59.559 --> 00:02:59.569 
their attention so you don't get hit but

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:01.300 
their attention so you don't get hit but
you<00:02:59.870> will<00:02:59.989> get<00:03:00.139> hit<00:03:00.319> a<00:03:00.349> little<00:03:00.650> bit<00:03:00.889> so<00:03:01.220> you

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
you will get hit a little bit so you

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.190 
you will get hit a little bit so you
will<00:03:01.430> need<00:03:01.579> a<00:03:01.609> little<00:03:01.909> bit<00:03:02.090> of<00:03:02.120> food<00:03:02.480> so

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
will need a little bit of food so

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.690 
will need a little bit of food so
eventually<00:03:03.439> will<00:03:03.859> someone<00:03:04.189> even<00:03:04.400> more

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
eventually will someone even more

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.270 
eventually will someone even more
skeletons<00:03:05.359> but<00:03:05.930> anyway<00:03:06.349> when<00:03:06.620> if<00:03:06.889> there<00:03:07.159> are

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
skeletons but anyway when if there are

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.190 
skeletons but anyway when if there are
many<00:03:07.579> students<00:03:08.150> only<00:03:08.299> two<00:03:08.750> of<00:03:08.870> them<00:03:09.019> can

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
many students only two of them can

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.530 
many students only two of them can
attack<00:03:09.470> tank<00:03:10.189> at<00:03:10.310> the<00:03:10.430> same<00:03:10.700> time<00:03:10.909> so<00:03:11.420> it

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
attack tank at the same time so it

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.929 
attack tank at the same time so it
doesn't<00:03:11.810> really<00:03:11.959> matter<00:03:12.310> so<00:03:13.310> simply<00:03:13.790> keep

00:03:13.929 --> 00:03:13.939 
doesn't really matter so simply keep

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:15.789 
doesn't really matter so simply keep
attacking<00:03:14.239> the<00:03:14.510> bus<00:03:14.659> while<00:03:15.200> staying<00:03:15.530> at<00:03:15.709> the

00:03:15.789 --> 00:03:15.799 
attacking the bus while staying at the

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:17.500 
attacking the bus while staying at the
same<00:03:16.069> spot<00:03:16.220> and<00:03:16.489> eventually<00:03:16.760> the<00:03:17.060> bus<00:03:17.329> won't

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
same spot and eventually the bus won't

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:23.380 
same spot and eventually the bus won't
die

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:23.390 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:25.330 

ok<00:03:24.140> so<00:03:24.200> now<00:03:24.410> we'll<00:03:24.680> talk<00:03:24.890> about<00:03:25.040> the<00:03:25.310> first

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
ok so now we'll talk about the first

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.150 
ok so now we'll talk about the first
well<00:03:26.090> the<00:03:26.630> easiest<00:03:26.660> strategy<00:03:27.650> but<00:03:27.770> it's<00:03:27.950> also

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.160 
well the easiest strategy but it's also

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.070 
well the easiest strategy but it's also
the<00:03:28.490> slowest<00:03:28.850> one<00:03:28.970> so<00:03:29.390> when<00:03:29.630> is<00:03:29.750> someone<00:03:29.959> a

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.080 
the slowest one so when is someone a

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.140 
the slowest one so when is someone a
skeleton<00:03:30.740> you<00:03:30.830> simply<00:03:31.130> teleport<00:03:31.580> away<00:03:31.730> with

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
skeleton you simply teleport away with

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.040 
skeleton you simply teleport away with
here<00:03:32.390> ggs<00:03:33.080> or<00:03:33.520> gate<00:03:34.520> now<00:03:35.420> you<00:03:35.480> will<00:03:35.690> wait<00:03:35.870> until

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:36.050 
here ggs or gate now you will wait until

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:38.020 
here ggs or gate now you will wait until
the<00:03:36.380> minion<00:03:36.709> disappear<00:03:37.190> and<00:03:37.340> then<00:03:37.520> you<00:03:37.730> go

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
the minion disappear and then you go

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:39.490 
the minion disappear and then you go
back<00:03:38.060> inside<00:03:38.390> the<00:03:38.750> bathroom<00:03:38.959> and<00:03:39.290> keep

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500 
back inside the bathroom and keep

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.970 
back inside the bathroom and keep
attacking<00:03:39.860> the<00:03:40.160> box<00:03:41.470> so<00:03:42.470> as<00:03:42.530> soon<00:03:42.680> as<00:03:42.800> is

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:42.980 
attacking the box so as soon as is

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:44.770 
attacking the box so as soon as is
someone<00:03:43.459> another<00:03:43.760> minion<00:03:44.060> the<00:03:44.330> teleport

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
someone another minion the teleport

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:47.680 
someone another minion the teleport
outside<00:03:45.260> and<00:03:45.620> you<00:03:46.340> wait<00:03:46.520> until<00:03:46.670> the<00:03:47.060> minion<00:03:47.390> go

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690
