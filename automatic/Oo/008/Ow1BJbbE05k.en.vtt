00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.700
 also the samsung galaxy s 5 kr gesten 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:07.620
 namely just with the palm of your hand 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:09.900
 scroll scroll or otherwise 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:13.099
 Something we turn on shows you 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.099
 another short break 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:27.000
 Soja Gesten you want to know what that is 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.340
 not to be confused with he view that is 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.189
 Another tips and tricks he gestures 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.930
 means as much as you know 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.360
 maybe from galaxy note that one 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.040
 simply by gestures the device 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.650
 can control accordingly 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.230
 in the galaxy s 5 it is certain 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:44.430
 apps are limited and you have to go accordingly 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.040
 also activate first 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.140
 we just go to that 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.700
 Do not be surprised if settings at 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.710
 me a little bit different looks the 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:56.879
 you can under settings 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.649
 change accordingly 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.140
 So I like the ones here 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:05.670
 register view and there we find 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:08.960
 under control another menu item 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.729
 which is called movement and gestures 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:15.240
 and find movements and gestures 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:17.399
 we've made so he needs the 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.959
 We turn now just one and 

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:20.429
 in the moment where we turn it on 

00:01:18.959 --> 00:01:22.289
 we still have a bit of choice there 

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:25.410
 down the apps and applications 

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:26.640
 So choose the ones he's using 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:28.530
 should work 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.899
 and that's exactly what we do to her 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.910
 look at the nice lady we go 

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:35.099
 assuming that it means one 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:37.470
 shows what's up high right 

00:01:35.099 --> 00:01:39.899
 left yes the problem now synonymous out times 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:43.440
 by simply using a browser 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:46.020
 open and have here now to wonder 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.729
 the samsung side and you see the 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.530
 possibility would exist now that 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.030
 we scroll down a bit and 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.429
 that's exactly what he does as well 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.709
 back everything clear and the whole thing 

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:57.479
 works only by gesture that is 

00:01:55.709 --> 00:02:02.190
 even the whole secret behind 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:03.660
 the first or he roars so who 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:06.119
 needs something you ask now 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:08.700
 probably now two options 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:11.610
 either you are pretty greasy 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.680
 finger because you like to eat sweets 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.700
 and constantly chocolate on the fingers off 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:20.849
 and not on the display or want 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:22.770
 are otherwise dirty yes could too 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:24.750
 be a fitter and tidy 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.890
 smear under the fingers have been there 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.550
 Of course, that's not the way it is 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:31.230
 drawn yes and otherwise the boards 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.000
