00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
I'm sure whether it's Sanjay whether

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.840 
I'm sure whether it's Sanjay whether
it's<00:01:22.049> Shahrukh<00:01:22.439> whether<00:01:22.680> it's<00:01:22.860> Salman<00:01:23.280> any<00:01:23.580> of

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
about the comparison but if they're not

about the comparison but if they're not
drinking<00:01:28.950> I<00:01:29.130> think<00:01:29.729> these<00:01:29.880> fights<00:01:30.240> are<00:01:30.479> really

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
drinking I think these fights are really

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.870 
drinking I think these fights are really
avoidable<00:01:31.290> so<00:01:31.950> what's<00:01:32.130> your<00:01:32.280> advice<00:01:32.400> to<00:01:32.579> them

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
avoidable so what's your advice to them

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.390 
avoidable so what's your advice to them
if<00:01:33.750> they<00:01:33.930> should<00:01:34.079> either<00:01:34.290> stay<00:01:34.560> sober<00:01:34.799> if<00:01:35.189> they

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
if they should either stay sober if they

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.069 
if they should either stay sober if they
want<00:01:35.579> to<00:01:35.670> fight<00:01:35.850> or<00:01:36.150> if<00:01:36.780> they're<00:01:36.990> drinking

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
want to fight or if they're drinking

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.590 
want to fight or if they're drinking
then<00:01:37.409> do<00:01:37.590> not<00:01:37.740> fight<00:01:38.040> but<00:01:38.579> semi<00:01:38.850> Salman<00:01:39.270> or

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
then do not fight but semi Salman or

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.359 
then do not fight but semi Salman or
Sanjay<00:01:39.900> that<00:01:40.079> they<00:01:40.259> seem<00:01:40.470> to<00:01:40.500> be<00:01:40.710> enjoying<00:01:41.070> all

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
Sanjay that they seem to be enjoying all
