00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
is pretty high in order to really create

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.150 
is pretty high in order to really create
a<00:00:29.730> new<00:00:29.939> category<00:00:30.179> of<00:00:30.510> devices<00:00:31.050> those<00:00:31.800> devices

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
smartphone otherwise it has no reason

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.940 
smartphone otherwise it has no reason
for<00:01:26.580> being<00:01:27.290> now<00:01:28.670> some<00:01:29.670> people<00:01:29.850> have<00:01:30.210> thought

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
for being now some people have thought

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.450 
for being now some people have thought
that<00:01:31.950> that's<00:01:32.130> a<00:01:32.250> netbook<00:01:33.650> the<00:01:34.650> problem<00:01:35.220> is

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
that that's a netbook the problem is

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:42.800 
that that's a netbook the problem is
netbooks<00:01:36.240> aren't<00:01:36.509> better<00:01:36.720> at<00:01:37.020> anything<00:01:39.140> they

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.859 

they're<00:01:43.439> slow<00:01:44.090> they<00:01:45.090> have<00:01:45.270> low<00:01:45.540> quality

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
they're slow they have low quality

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.350 
they're slow they have low quality
displays<00:01:46.500> and<00:01:46.890> they<00:01:47.280> run<00:01:47.490> clunky<00:01:47.909> old<00:01:47.939> pc

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
displays and they run clunky old pc

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.679 
displays and they run clunky old pc
software<00:01:48.899> so<00:01:49.909> they're<00:01:50.909> not<00:01:51.060> better<00:01:51.390> than<00:01:51.630> a

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
software so they're not better than a

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.779 
software so they're not better than a
laptop<00:01:52.049> at<00:01:52.500> anything<00:01:52.920> they're<00:01:53.070> just<00:01:53.100> cheaper

00:01:53.779 --> 00:01:53.789 
laptop at anything they're just cheaper

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:57.139 
laptop at anything they're just cheaper
they're<00:01:54.270> just<00:01:54.539> cheap<00:01:54.899> laptops<00:01:55.770> and<00:01:56.070> we<00:01:57.000> don't

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
they're just cheap laptops and we don't

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.549 
they're just cheap laptops and we don't
think<00:01:57.539> if<00:01:58.229> they're<00:01:58.439> a<00:01:58.470> third<00:01:58.770> category<00:01:58.979> device
