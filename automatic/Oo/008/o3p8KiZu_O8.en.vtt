00:00:53.069 --> 00:00:53.079 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:56.650 

then<00:00:54.079> you<00:00:54.230> place<00:00:54.680> the<00:00:54.800> device<00:00:54.950> anywhere<00:00:55.660> at

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:56.660 
then you place the device anywhere at

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.100 
then you place the device anywhere at
the<00:00:56.840> any<00:00:57.110> orientation<00:00:57.649> on<00:00:57.950> a<00:00:57.980> pad<00:00:58.250> and<00:00:58.930> it<00:00:59.930> will

the any orientation on a pad and it will

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:03.580 
the any orientation on a pad and it will
receive<00:01:00.440> power<00:01:00.680> and<00:01:01.840> that's<00:01:02.840> full<00:01:03.230> charge

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:03.590 
receive power and that's full charge

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:07.149 
receive power and that's full charge
this<00:01:04.010> is<00:01:04.190> no<00:01:04.369> trickle<00:01:04.850> charge<00:01:05.979> this<00:01:06.979> is

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:07.159 
this is no trickle charge this is

a pan and it receives power what you see
here<00:01:29.660> and<00:01:29.869> those<00:01:30.350> two<00:01:30.530> devices<00:01:30.800> that<00:01:31.190> we

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 
here and those two devices that we

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.630 
here and those two devices that we
enabled<00:01:31.700> here<00:01:32.030> is<00:01:32.149> what<00:01:32.810> we<00:01:32.840> call<00:01:33.110> skins<00:01:33.619> or<00:01:34.160> a
