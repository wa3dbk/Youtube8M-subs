amazon<00:01:01.079> theory<00:01:01.410> but<00:01:02.160> if<00:01:02.760> you<00:01:03.000> have<00:01:03.180> those<00:01:03.420> meet

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
amazon theory but if you have those meet

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.920 
amazon theory but if you have those meet
those<00:01:04.280> you<00:01:05.280> will<00:01:05.489> be<00:01:05.640> farming<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.330> duo<00:01:06.540> that's

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
those you will be farming the duo that's

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.380 
those you will be farming the duo that's
the<00:01:07.110> easiest<00:01:07.409> way<00:01:07.619> to<00:01:07.680> get<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:08.010> marks<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:09.180> duo

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
the easiest way to get the marks the duo

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.000 
the easiest way to get the marks the duo
usually<00:01:09.930> gives<00:01:10.140> you<00:01:10.260> three<00:01:10.560> I<00:01:10.590> heard

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
usually gives you three I heard

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.620 
usually gives you three I heard
sometimes<00:01:11.400> it<00:01:11.580> gives<00:01:11.670> you<00:01:11.850> two<00:01:12.090> but<00:01:12.330> most<00:01:12.510> of

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
sometimes it gives you two but most of

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.539 
sometimes it gives you two but most of
the<00:01:12.689> time<00:01:12.869> I<00:01:13.080> found<00:01:13.650> that<00:01:13.799> I<00:01:13.920> get<00:01:14.100> three<00:01:14.280> marks

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
the time I found that I get three marks

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.670 
the time I found that I get three marks
of<00:01:14.729> fury<00:01:15.000> out<00:01:15.270> of<00:01:15.479> it<00:01:15.600> and<00:01:15.780> it<00:01:15.900> costs<00:01:16.200> 12<00:01:16.470> to

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
of fury out of it and it costs 12 to

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.410 
of fury out of it and it costs 12 to
replay<00:01:17.100> so<00:01:18.530> that's<00:01:19.530> 24<00:01:20.189> replay<00:01:21.030> beyond<00:01:21.240> just

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
replay so that's 24 replay beyond just

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.320 
replay so that's 24 replay beyond just
46<00:01:21.869> marks<00:01:22.140> in<00:01:22.290> theory<00:01:22.530> and<00:01:22.970> six<00:01:23.970> marks<00:01:24.240> in

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
46 marks in theory and six marks in

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.820 
46 marks in theory and six marks in
theory<00:01:24.570> is<00:01:24.689> how<00:01:24.869> much<00:01:24.990> that<00:01:25.259> alert<00:01:25.470> give<00:01:25.650> see

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
theory is how much that alert give see

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.370 
theory is how much that alert give see
the<00:01:26.009> alert<00:01:26.220> also<00:01:26.640> takes<00:01:26.880> a<00:01:27.180> pretty<00:01:27.869> long<00:01:28.049> time

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
the alert also takes a pretty long time

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.039 
the alert also takes a pretty long time
the<00:01:28.799> ant<00:01:29.009> and<00:01:29.280> everything<00:01:30.060> you<00:01:30.479> can<00:01:30.630> skip<00:01:30.900> them

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
the ant and everything you can skip them

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.719 
the ant and everything you can skip them
if<00:01:31.170> you<00:01:31.320> guys<00:01:31.500> all<00:01:31.799> can<00:01:32.009> fly<00:01:32.220> and<00:01:32.280> stuff<00:01:32.610> like

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
if you guys all can fly and stuff like

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.819 
if you guys all can fly and stuff like
that<00:01:32.790> but<00:01:33.150> they<00:01:33.600> have<00:01:33.780> a<00:01:33.810> lot<00:01:33.990> of<00:01:34.020> health<00:01:34.290> so<00:01:34.680> do

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
that but they have a lot of health so do

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.289 
that but they have a lot of health so do
the<00:01:34.950> bosses<00:01:35.369> so<00:01:35.549> it<00:01:35.640> really<00:01:35.820> takes<00:01:36.090> a<00:01:36.150> long

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
the bosses so it really takes a long

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:37.960 
the bosses so it really takes a long
time<00:01:36.329> to<00:01:36.540> get<00:01:36.720> through<00:01:36.869> those<00:01:37.020> alerts<00:01:37.350> and

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:37.970 
time to get through those alerts and

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:40.880 
time to get through those alerts and
it's<00:01:38.970> kind<00:01:39.390> of<00:01:39.570> boring<00:01:39.810> annoying<00:01:40.380> a<00:01:40.590> little

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
it's kind of boring annoying a little

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.100 
it's kind of boring annoying a little
bit<00:01:41.240> depending<00:01:42.240> on<00:01:42.329> what<00:01:42.479> setup<00:01:42.720> you're<00:01:42.930> going

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
bit depending on what setup you're going

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.480 
bit depending on what setup you're going
with<00:01:43.290> you<00:01:43.439> can<00:01:43.619> go<00:01:43.740> with<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.040> self-healing

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
with you can go with the self-healing

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
all the time but most of the time from

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.589 
all the time but most of the time from
what<00:02:55.019> I've<00:02:55.139> seen<00:02:55.200> but<00:02:55.819> they're<00:02:56.819> all<00:02:57.120> the<00:02:57.420> time

00:02:57.589 --> 00:02:57.599 
what I've seen but they're all the time

00:02:57.599 --> 00:02:59.030 
what I've seen but they're all the time
they're<00:02:58.170> pretty<00:02:58.319> skilled<00:02:58.739> I<00:02:58.859> mean

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
they're pretty skilled I mean

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.500 
they're pretty skilled I mean
everybody's<00:02:59.459> over<00:02:59.609> a<00:02:59.730> bunch<00:02:59.909> of<00:03:00.000> combat<00:03:00.359> ready

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
everybody's over a bunch of combat ready

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.080 
everybody's over a bunch of combat ready
so<00:03:01.079> they're<00:03:01.530> not<00:03:01.980> noobs<00:03:02.430> or<00:03:02.730> anything<00:03:03.060> like

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
so they're not noobs or anything like

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:04.729 
so they're not noobs or anything like
that<00:03:03.209> so<00:03:03.870> most<00:03:04.079> players<00:03:04.200> know<00:03:04.500> what<00:03:04.620> they're

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
that so most players know what they're

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:06.559 
that so most players know what they're
doing<00:03:05.040> but<00:03:05.280> one<00:03:05.730> of<00:03:05.849> them<00:03:05.939> definitely<00:03:06.150> has<00:03:06.450> to

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:06.569
