wings have a monster like that can

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.290 
wings have a monster like that can
really<00:00:34.469> shut<00:00:34.739> them<00:00:34.920> down<00:00:35.100> what<00:00:35.760> consecrated

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
really shut them down what consecrated

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.229 
really shut them down what consecrated
light<00:00:36.480> is<00:00:36.660> it's<00:00:36.989> a<00:00:37.140> 0-0<00:00:37.590> light<00:00:38.100> monster<00:00:38.610> that

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
light is it's a 0-0 light monster that

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.380 
light is it's a 0-0 light monster that
will<00:00:40.010> make<00:00:41.010> it<00:00:41.100> so<00:00:41.219> you<00:00:41.309> can<00:00:41.460> no<00:00:41.550> longer<00:00:41.790> attack

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
will make it so you can no longer attack

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.360 
will make it so you can no longer attack
with<00:00:42.600> your<00:00:42.750> black<00:00:43.440> winged<00:00:43.620> monsters<00:00:44.040> and<00:00:44.250> you

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
with your black winged monsters and you

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.260 
with your black winged monsters and you
can<00:00:44.489> no<00:00:44.610> longer<00:00:44.879> summon<00:00:45.329> any<00:00:45.450> so<00:00:46.910> it<00:00:47.910> really

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
can no longer summon any so it really

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.750 
can no longer summon any so it really
slows<00:00:48.660> down<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:49.079> pace<00:00:49.230> of<00:00:49.379> your<00:00:49.500> deck<00:00:49.649> and<00:00:49.829> you

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
slows down the pace of your deck and you

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.490 
slows down the pace of your deck and you
really<00:00:51.270> can't<00:00:51.510> do<00:00:51.660> a<00:00:51.690> whole<00:00:51.870> lot<00:00:51.930> until<00:00:52.230> you

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
really can't do a whole lot until you

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.520 
really can't do a whole lot until you
get<00:00:52.620> that<00:00:52.710> off<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.039> board<00:00:53.329> so<00:00:54.329> you<00:00:54.750> really

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
get that off the board so you really

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:56.810 
get that off the board so you really
need<00:00:55.620> to<00:00:55.739> have<00:00:55.860> an<00:00:55.980> answer<00:00:56.250> for<00:00:56.280> that<00:00:56.460> in<00:00:56.699> your

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
need to have an answer for that in your

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.700 
need to have an answer for that in your
sideboard<00:00:57.329> and<00:00:57.600> or<00:00:57.960> your<00:00:58.109> main<00:00:58.260> board<00:00:58.500> and

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
sideboard and or your main board and

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.610 
sideboard and or your main board and
just<00:00:59.039> have<00:00:59.190> a<00:00:59.750> game<00:01:00.750> plan<00:01:00.780> for<00:01:01.199> when<00:01:01.350> you<00:01:01.440> see

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
just have a game plan for when you see

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.529 
just have a game plan for when you see
that<00:01:01.829> because<00:01:02.100> it<00:01:02.250> can<00:01:02.730> be<00:01:02.850> a<00:01:02.879> very<00:01:02.910> hard<00:01:03.300> card

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
that because it can be a very hard card

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.090 
that because it can be a very hard card
to<00:01:03.600> deal<00:01:03.750> with<00:01:03.930> if<00:01:04.080> you<00:01:04.199> don't<00:01:04.350> have<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:04.799> right
