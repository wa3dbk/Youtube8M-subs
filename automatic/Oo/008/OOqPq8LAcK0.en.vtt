00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.759
 rule is the most important part of the 

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:17.830
 Orchid survival everybody 

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:20.710
 teaches you to water an orchid 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:22.960
 once a week and people take the 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:24.970
 plant leads until a faucet opens the 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.290
 tap in voice wire though antÃ³nio 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:28.420
 pea that this pot 

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:31.180
 This is not a cool thing to do. 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:35.140
 with the orchid it gets very soggy 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:38.200
 and rots her roots and if this 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:40.390
 happens because the vessel will hold a lot of 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:42.640
 water as I said to the roots of urc 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:45.280
 of nature are always exposed 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.079
 so you have a concept of how 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.400
 to water an orchid when the 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:50.530
 old doctor nowadays depends to 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.600
 take two liters of water per day 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:54.670
 if you store these two liters all over 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.230
 day and take 14 on Sunday will not 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.570
 solve rather than do good to the 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:00.670
 health will do much harm to so do 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:03.850
 same thing with your plant water with 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:06.250
 little water several times a week 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:09.220
 in summer until almost every day depends on the 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:12.550
 environment and in winter once or twice 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:14.950
 with little water what happens to know 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:18.790
 if you have to water your orchid not you 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:20.020
 will pay attention to the clothes on the clothesline or 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.210
 on the towel in the bathroom 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:24.280
 If I 'm drying fast, it's because the 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.680
 air is dry is it hot you can 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.869
 charge your plant if you happen to have 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.520
 taking time to dry 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:31.930
 this towel is because it has enough 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.330
 humidity in the air 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:35.680
 It's taking time to dry and then you do not 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.049
 need to carry your plant because it 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.600
 will be able to absorb this unit the 

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:42.159
 own air is the most important 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.770
 time you water your 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:46.330
 plants die leaves her drops 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:49.150
 a little in the pot 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.960
 This causes the plant to hydrate 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.119
 complete 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:56.740
 it's no use just regal vase the leaves 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:59.920
 become dry and especially you 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:03.280
 remember that for the plant to know what the 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.990
 spring summer autumn winter is not the 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:09.539
 cold or the heat that does it with 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:11.739
 plant but it 's summer it rains a lot 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.900
 winter does not rain 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:15.879
 so in the summer water more to plan 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.470
 because it dries faster and because 

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:20.620
 She needs to know to know that it's summer. 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:23.170
 in winter you reduce this rule but not 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.640
 is to cut the rule of the plant is to reduce 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.079
 amount of water 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.840
 You have to remember that in winter there is no 

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:30.640
 but it rains every night has its serene and 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.659
 that's what I wanted to survive will be 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.430
 of the night 

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:36.489
 this makes the plant understand that 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.470
 time of year to kill and it then she 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:41.439
 It will take a lot of people to buy 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:44.109
 because days like drugs and no more 

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:46.420
 flower or as an athlete no longer gives the reason 

00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:48.069
 because the plant does not know the difference 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.379
 There will not be summer autumn winter she only 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:52.510
 gets addicted and in the case of drug that 

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:54.099
 mount in the middle of the bulb 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.120
 it looks like the plant that has a lot of 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:57.609
 little world 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:00.069
 hence it usually happens over 

00:02:57.609 --> 00:03:01.569
 rules in winter she needs to pass 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:03.340
 for a period of stress during the 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:05.049
 winter to understand that it is winter 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.099
 so it will give strength to your time 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:08.920
 certain 

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:11.500
 okay but the most important is to have a sense 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.689
 this rule and if you are in doubt 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:16.120
 that watering the plant is not putting your finger 

00:03:13.689 --> 00:03:19.000
 on the substrate placed from a substrate 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:21.040
 is dry gives a slight rule put the 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.199
 finger on substrate is wet do not negate 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:26.829
 your plant at the time that kills the most 

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:29.290
 Orchid is Reveillon and Carnival because 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:32.260
 people decide to travel take to 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.849
 orchid soaks she arranges a bowl 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.379
 to fill with water inside the 

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:37.209
 plant when the plant when you come back 

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:40.510
 the plant is looking like a 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:41.919
 one salad braised in fully dish 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:43.359
 melted and could only be a plant 

00:03:41.919 --> 00:03:45.519
 due to excess water 

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:48.400
 if you are going to travel at that time rule in 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:50.560
 Your plan will travel enjoy and when 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.959
 come back you slowly reveal again 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:56.159
 returning the traditional rule gradually 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:56.159
 not to stress the plant
