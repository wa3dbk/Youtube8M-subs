it's safe to flip it back over whatever
many<00:01:49.640> moisture<00:01:50.090> is<00:01:50.300> still<00:01:50.570> there<00:01:51.040> you're

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:52.040 
many moisture is still there you're

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.350 
many moisture is still there you're
going<00:01:52.130> to<00:01:52.190> take<00:01:52.340> some<00:01:52.400> rice<00:01:52.760> and<00:01:53.090> you're<00:01:53.210> just

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:53.360 
going to take some rice and you're just

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.810 
going to take some rice and you're just
going<00:01:53.540> to<00:01:53.570> kind<00:01:53.750> of<00:01:54.130> gently<00:01:55.130> disperse<00:01:55.580> it

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 
going to kind of gently disperse it

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.520 
going to kind of gently disperse it
around<00:01:56.060> your<00:01:56.300> keyboard<00:01:56.780> which<00:01:56.990> you<00:01:57.290> got<00:01:57.409> it

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
around your keyboard which you got it

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.260 
around your keyboard which you got it
like<00:01:57.620> I<00:01:57.740> said<00:01:57.800> gently<00:01:58.220> because<00:01:58.970> you<00:01:59.060> don't

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
like I said gently because you don't

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:00.580 
like I said gently because you don't
want<00:01:59.450> all<00:01:59.659> of<00:01:59.720> it<00:01:59.960> to<00:02:00.020> get<00:02:00.229> inside<00:02:00.470> the

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
want all of it to get inside the

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.950 
want all of it to get inside the
crevices<00:02:01.010> mine<00:02:01.580> is<00:02:01.790> my<00:02:02.180> keyboards<00:02:02.510> protruded

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
crevices mine is my keyboards protruded

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.660 
crevices mine is my keyboards protruded
so<00:02:03.530> I<00:02:03.560> don't<00:02:03.830> really<00:02:04.010> have<00:02:04.159> to<00:02:04.310> worry<00:02:04.520> about

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
so I don't really have to worry about

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:05.950 
so I don't really have to worry about
rice<00:02:05.000> getting<00:02:05.300> in<00:02:05.390> there<00:02:05.510> but<00:02:05.659> if<00:02:05.750> you<00:02:05.840> guys

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 
rice getting in there but if you guys

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.199 
rice getting in there but if you guys
have<00:02:06.200> different<00:02:06.350> kind<00:02:06.620> of<00:02:06.680> keyboards<00:02:07.130> you<00:02:08.060> may

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.209 
have different kind of keyboards you may

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:10.899 
have different kind of keyboards you may
not<00:02:08.389> want<00:02:08.539> to<00:02:08.599> use<00:02:08.689> that<00:02:08.810> option<00:02:09.170> so<00:02:09.909> you're

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:10.909 
not want to use that option so you're

00:02:10.909 --> 00:02:14.670 
not want to use that option so you're
just<00:02:10.969> going<00:02:11.120> to<00:02:11.209> go<00:02:11.269> ahead<00:02:11.329> and<00:02:11.480> put<00:02:11.599> it<00:02:11.689> there

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.320 

this<00:02:15.680> this<00:02:16.100> is<00:02:16.280> rare<00:02:16.520> I<00:02:16.550> mean<00:02:16.670> sometimes<00:02:17.150> it's

this this is rare I mean sometimes it's

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.080 
this this is rare I mean sometimes it's
you<00:02:17.600> know<00:02:17.750> you<00:02:18.500> have<00:02:18.860> a<00:02:18.890> window<00:02:19.280> of<00:02:19.310> maybe<00:02:19.819> two

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
you know you have a window of maybe two

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:21.970 
you know you have a window of maybe two

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
going through it water is a very good

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.080 
going through it water is a very good
conductor<00:02:42.110> and<00:02:42.500> it<00:02:43.069> damages<00:02:43.550> lanes<00:02:43.790> and

conductor and it damages lanes and

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:45.340 
conductor and it damages lanes and
that's<00:02:44.209> when<00:02:44.360> things<00:02:44.480> get<00:02:44.690> short-circuited

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
that's when things get short-circuited

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:49.180 
that's when things get short-circuited
so<00:02:46.040> we're<00:02:46.580> going<00:02:46.670> to<00:02:46.730> go<00:02:46.910> over<00:02:46.940> what<00:02:47.630> to<00:02:47.750> do<00:02:48.190> in

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
so we're going to go over what to do in

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:50.920 
so we're going to go over what to do in
this<00:02:49.310> event<00:02:49.610> usually<00:02:50.060> you're<00:02:50.390> you<00:02:50.540> know<00:02:50.660> on<00:02:50.690> a

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
this event usually you're you know on a

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:52.870 
this event usually you're you know on a

laptop your CMOS batteries inside your

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.070 
laptop your CMOS batteries inside your
computer<00:02:53.090> you<00:02:53.269> don't<00:02:53.420> have<00:02:53.660> the<00:02:53.750> option<00:02:53.900> to

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
computer you don't have the option to

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.970 
computer you don't have the option to
take<00:02:54.200> it<00:02:54.320> apart<00:02:54.560> unless<00:02:54.709> you're<00:02:54.950> very

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
take it apart unless you're very

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.770 
take it apart unless you're very
experienced<00:02:55.640> so<00:02:56.150> we're<00:02:56.360> going<00:02:56.450> to<00:02:56.540> go<00:02:56.630> the

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
experienced so we're going to go the

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:57.370 
experienced so we're going to go the
other<00:02:56.810> way<00:02:57.019> around

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
other way around

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.850 
other way around
you're<00:02:58.280> going<00:02:58.400> to<00:02:58.489> grab<00:02:59.680> you're<00:03:00.680> going<00:03:00.800> to

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
you're going to grab you're going to

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:02.500 
you're going to grab you're going to
grab<00:03:01.010> a<00:03:01.040> microfiber<00:03:01.400> cloth<00:03:01.790> and<00:03:02.120> this<00:03:02.209> is<00:03:02.360> just

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
grab a microfiber cloth and this is just

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:03.759 
grab a microfiber cloth and this is just
because<00:03:02.720> it<00:03:02.750> gets<00:03:03.019> all<00:03:03.140> of<00:03:03.200> the<00:03:03.380> other<00:03:03.410> fine

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:03.769 
because it gets all of the other fine

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:06.250 
because it gets all of the other fine
particles<00:03:04.280> and<00:03:05.120> you're<00:03:05.660> just<00:03:05.780> going<00:03:05.900> to<00:03:05.959> sit

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
particles and you're just going to sit

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.650 
particles and you're just going to sit
here<00:03:06.650> and<00:03:06.920> just<00:03:07.130> take<00:03:07.489> it<00:03:07.700> and<00:03:07.940> wipe<00:03:08.330> your

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
here and just take it and wipe your

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:10.360 
here and just take it and wipe your
keyboard<00:03:09.080> kind<00:03:09.380> of<00:03:09.470> in<00:03:09.560> circular<00:03:09.860> motions

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
keyboard kind of in circular motions

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:11.800 
keyboard kind of in circular motions
I<00:03:10.400> mean<00:03:10.790> don't<00:03:10.940> go<00:03:11.030> too<00:03:11.090> rough<00:03:11.420> because<00:03:11.690> you'll

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
I mean don't go too rough because you'll

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:13.720 
I mean don't go too rough because you'll
destroy<00:03:12.110> the<00:03:12.140> keys<00:03:12.410> would<00:03:12.680> just<00:03:13.370> enough<00:03:13.610> so

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
destroy the keys would just enough so

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:14.710 
destroy the keys would just enough so
you<00:03:13.760> can<00:03:13.940> feel<00:03:14.120> that<00:03:14.150> it's<00:03:14.390> getting<00:03:14.540> inside

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
you can feel that it's getting inside

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:19.240 
you can feel that it's getting inside
the<00:03:14.959> keys<00:03:15.760> so<00:03:16.760> once<00:03:17.030> you<00:03:17.209> do<00:03:17.390> that<00:03:18.250> you're

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
the keys so once you do that you're

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:20.410 
the keys so once you do that you're
going<00:03:19.370> to<00:03:19.400> take<00:03:19.610> your<00:03:19.820> bottle<00:03:20.090> here<00:03:20.269> you're

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
going to take your bottle here you're

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:21.550 
going to take your bottle here you're
going<00:03:20.510> to<00:03:20.570> spray<00:03:20.780> some<00:03:20.989> of<00:03:21.019> this<00:03:21.200> Elly's

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
going to spray some of this Elly's

water<00:05:04.610> on<00:05:04.730> is<00:05:04.910> it<00:05:05.030> permanently<00:05:05.360> broken<00:05:05.510> the

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:05.780 
water on is it permanently broken the

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:07.840 
water on is it permanently broken the
answer<00:05:05.990> is<00:05:06.110> yes<00:05:06.260> unfortunately<00:05:06.980> as<00:05:07.490> I<00:05:07.670> said

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:07.850 
answer is yes unfortunately as I said

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:10.090 
answer is yes unfortunately as I said
water<00:05:08.090> is<00:05:08.210> an<00:05:08.330> excellent<00:05:08.450> conductor<00:05:08.720> so<00:05:09.710> the

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:10.100 
water is an excellent conductor so the

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:12.040 
water is an excellent conductor so the
electricity<00:05:10.730> the<00:05:10.910> electrons<00:05:11.330> will<00:05:11.600> transfer

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:12.050 
electricity the electrons will transfer

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:14.560 
electricity the electrons will transfer
over<00:05:12.080> into<00:05:12.350> the<00:05:12.650> water<00:05:12.860> which<00:05:13.580> may<00:05:13.820> be<00:05:13.880> on<00:05:14.150> one

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:14.570 
over into the water which may be on one

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:18.650 
those two lanes meet it causes

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:19.960 
those two lanes meet it causes
