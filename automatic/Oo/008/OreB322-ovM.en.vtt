00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:16.500
 the asteroid belt or belt 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.930
 asteroids 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.000
 is a region of the solar system that possesses 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.859
 a large concentration of asteroids 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.260
 some of these celestial bodies 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.160
 have several hundred kilometers of 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.320
 diameter 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.689
 the asteroid belt is between the 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.270
 the orbit of the planet Mars and the 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.910
 planet jupiter the waist of asteroids 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.430
 sometimes called the main waistline 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.260
 to distinguish with other regions 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.239
 of the solar system where there are 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.120
 steroid concentrations as per 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.100
 example the felt of kuip the total mass 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.129
 of the asteroid waist is 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.829
 approximately 4% of the mass of our moon 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:56.510
 being that the dwarf planet ceres disaster 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:58.890
 eyes pallas vesta and guide all together 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:01.140
 account for approximately half of 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.420
 total mass of the asteroid belt 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.670
 the first element of the waist 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.860
 asteroids to be discovered was series 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.140
 discovered in 1801 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.540
 at that time series was classified with 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.430
 the planet in the following years 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.080
 other celestial objects were 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.799
 discovered in the same region the system 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.350
 solar 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:22.979
 such as pallas or 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:25.080
 straw and iga party among others 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:28.590
 some time later these objects will become 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.869
 have asteroid classification and 2006 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.270
 or asteroid ceres 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.700
 classified with the planet we do not know 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.530
 today that the probability of a probe 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:41.150
 which passes in this region a solar system 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:43.380
 to hit with asteroid is too small 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:45.750
 thanks to site astronomy dot 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.950
 co which withdrew the text and made the
