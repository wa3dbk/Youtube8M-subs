on<00:02:23.220> the<00:02:23.370> box<00:02:24.260> and<00:02:25.260> think<00:02:25.950> I<00:02:26.610> think<00:02:26.910> that<00:02:27.120> the

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
on the box and think I think that the

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:28.850 
on the box and think I think that the
first<00:02:27.420> time<00:02:27.690> you<00:02:27.870> play<00:02:28.050> dominion<00:02:28.349> you<00:02:28.709> know

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
first time you play dominion you know

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.979 
first time you play dominion you know
exactly<00:02:29.400> what<00:02:29.550> you're<00:02:29.670> doing<00:02:29.700> I<00:02:30.180> think<00:02:30.750> pretty

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
exactly what you're doing I think pretty

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:33.170 
exactly what you're doing I think pretty
close<00:02:31.290> this<00:02:32.010> one<00:02:32.220> you<00:02:32.340> don't<00:02:32.370> I<00:02:32.760> mean<00:02:33.030> you're

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
close this one you don't I mean you're

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.600 
close this one you don't I mean you're
basically<00:02:33.299> just<00:02:33.599> rolling<00:02:34.110> the<00:02:34.140> dice<00:02:34.349> and

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
basically just rolling the dice and

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.710 
basically just rolling the dice and
whatever<00:02:35.610> your<00:02:35.760> high<00:02:35.879> number<00:02:36.180> is<00:02:36.299> grab<00:02:36.599> your

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
whatever your high number is grab your

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.920 
whatever your high number is grab your
stuff<00:02:36.959> for<00:02:37.290> me<00:02:37.379> and<00:02:37.620> hope<00:02:38.580> that<00:02:38.940> that<00:02:39.269> whatever

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
stuff for me and hope that that whatever

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.979

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
that thing is comes out because you have

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:44.720 
that thing is comes out because you have
a<00:02:43.019> one<00:02:43.290> in<00:02:43.319> three<00:02:43.440> chance<00:02:43.709> it<00:02:44.280> looks<00:02:44.459> like<00:02:44.700> a

to do this she knows already that she
has<00:03:56.099> two<00:03:56.219> Buchanan's<00:03:56.730> what<00:03:57.180> here<00:03:57.750> I<00:03:57.959> said<00:03:58.469> it

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650

in<00:03:58.859> front<00:03:59.040> of<00:03:59.189> cigs<00:03:59.489> died<00:04:00.799> and<00:04:01.799> i<00:04:02.010> can<00:04:02.250> put<00:04:03.060> them

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
in front of cigs died and i can put them

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:04.789 
in front of cigs died and i can put them
together<00:04:03.450> so<00:04:04.019> you<00:04:04.109> sound<00:04:04.319> a<00:04:04.379> little<00:04:04.500> bit<00:04:04.680> like

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799 
together so you sound a little bit like

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:06.319 
together so you sound a little bit like
the<00:04:04.950> end<00:04:05.129> that<00:04:05.310> you<00:04:05.430> kind<00:04:05.609> of<00:04:05.640> roll<00:04:05.790> dice<00:04:06.030> and

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:06.329 
the end that you kind of roll dice and

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:11.839 
the end that you kind of roll dice and
just<00:04:06.480> do<00:04:06.569> it<00:04:08.719> is<00:04:09.719> true<00:04:10.140> that<00:04:10.530> is<00:04:11.010> true<00:04:11.370> I<00:04:11.549> would

00:04:11.839 --> 00:04:11.849 
just do it is true that is true I would

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:13.580 
just do it is true that is true I would
say<00:04:12.090> one<00:04:12.329> of<00:04:12.359> the<00:04:12.510> problems<00:04:12.959> is<00:04:13.079> some<00:04:13.349> of<00:04:13.469> the

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
say one of the problems is some of the

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.159 
say one of the problems is some of the
numbers<00:04:13.799> on<00:04:14.069> the<00:04:14.189> dice<00:04:14.370> are<00:04:14.780> awfully<00:04:15.780> small<00:04:16.109> to

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169 
numbers on the dice are awfully small to

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:18.110 
numbers on the dice are awfully small to
try<00:04:16.620> and<00:04:16.799> meet<00:04:16.889> what's<00:04:17.160> going<00:04:17.489> on<00:04:17.639> at<00:04:17.850> times

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
try and meet what's going on at times

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.550 
try and meet what's going on at times
and<00:04:18.810> that<00:04:18.930> can<00:04:19.079> be<00:04:19.109> a<00:04:19.229> little<00:04:19.350> frustrating

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
and that can be a little frustrating

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.069 
and that can be a little frustrating
with<00:04:20.039> this<00:04:20.220> game<00:04:20.509> now<00:04:21.509> it<00:04:21.600> doesn't<00:04:21.840> help<00:04:21.900> with

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:22.079 
with this game now it doesn't help with

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:23.840 
with this game now it doesn't help with
my<00:04:22.199> camera<00:04:22.470> is<00:04:22.680> not<00:04:22.710> focusing<00:04:23.370> on<00:04:23.460> the<00:04:23.580> number

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:23.850 
my camera is not focusing on the number

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:25.100 
my camera is not focusing on the number
but<00:04:24.030> that's<00:04:24.570> probably<00:04:24.780> been<00:04:24.960> the<00:04:24.990> most

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110 
but that's probably been the most

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:27.710 
but that's probably been the most
consistent<00:04:25.320> problem<00:04:26.060> I'm<00:04:27.060> enjoying<00:04:27.509> it

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
consistent problem I'm enjoying it

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.330 
consistent problem I'm enjoying it
though<00:04:27.900> I'm<00:04:28.139> enjoying<00:04:28.500> what's<00:04:28.740> going<00:04:29.009> on<00:04:29.160> I'm

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
though I'm enjoying what's going on I'm

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:30.950 
though I'm enjoying what's going on I'm
starting<00:04:29.669> to<00:04:29.699> figure<00:04:30.180> things<00:04:30.449> out<00:04:30.660> a<00:04:30.720> little

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:30.960 
starting to figure things out a little

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.080 
starting to figure things out a little
bit<00:04:31.139> more<00:04:31.380> so<00:04:31.860> I'll<00:04:32.039> be<00:04:32.190> curious<00:04:32.340> i<00:04:32.639> serve<00:04:32.910> I

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.090 
bit more so I'll be curious i serve I

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:34.490 
bit more so I'll be curious i serve I
like<00:04:33.270> it<00:04:33.419> more<00:04:33.570> than<00:04:33.630> Dominion<00:04:34.139> but<00:04:34.289> I<00:04:34.320> never

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.500 
like it more than Dominion but I never

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:35.749 
like it more than Dominion but I never
really<00:04:34.800> liked<00:04:34.889> Dominion<00:04:35.310> so<00:04:35.460> that's<00:04:35.639> nice

00:04:35.749 --> 00:04:35.759 
really liked Dominion so that's nice

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:38.839 
really liked Dominion so that's nice
lobar<00:04:36.360> timing<00:04:36.990> but<00:04:37.470> anyway<00:04:37.800> that's<00:04:38.220> poor<00:04:38.639> ears

00:04:38.839 --> 00:04:38.849 
lobar timing but anyway that's poor ears

00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:41.509 
lobar timing but anyway that's poor ears
take<00:04:39.270> two
