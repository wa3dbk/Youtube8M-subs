as<00:05:05.270> long<00:05:05.419> as<00:05:05.570> usual<00:05:05.900> so<00:05:06.650> that's<00:05:07.159> why<00:05:07.340> this<00:05:07.400> is<00:05:07.580> a

00:05:07.689 --> 00:05:07.699 
as long as usual so that's why this is a

00:05:07.699 --> 00:05:10.409 
as long as usual so that's why this is a
kind<00:05:08.030> of<00:05:08.150> sort<00:05:08.419> of<00:05:08.539> not<00:05:08.599> really<00:05:08.840> asking<00:05:09.320> video

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:15.219 
um yeah I've decided to break it up now
I<00:05:13.159> kind<00:05:13.460> of<00:05:13.550> do<00:05:13.699> it<00:05:13.849> slowly<00:05:14.150> hopefully<00:05:15.050> that'll

00:05:15.219 --> 00:05:15.229

ease the pain and last but certainly not

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:20.350
