00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
take out and the sea no problem there's

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.770 
take out and the sea no problem there's
something<00:02:58.040> like<00:02:59.320> seven<00:03:00.320> look<00:03:00.500> no<00:03:01.600> blue<00:03:02.600> on

there that j22 to that you can see

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.550 
there that j22 to that you can see
wouldn't<00:03:05.660> be<00:03:05.720> able<00:03:05.840> to<00:03:05.930> take<00:03:06.080> that<00:03:06.110> out<00:03:06.260> into

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
wouldn't be able to take that out into

it<00:03:07.880> wouldn't<00:03:08.120> be<00:03:08.239> advisable<00:03:08.480> anyway<00:03:10.450> so<00:03:11.450> once

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
it wouldn't be advisable anyway so once

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:14.050 
it wouldn't be advisable anyway so once

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850 
the freshwater and what you do find is

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:22.080 
the freshwater and what you do find is
well<00:03:20.030> sometimes<00:03:20.540> that<00:03:20.660> when<00:03:20.930> there's<00:03:21.200> been

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
well sometimes that when there's been

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:25.540 
unnaturally high tides and the salts
come<00:03:24.769> right<00:03:25.070> in

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:25.550 
come right in

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:28.690 
come right in
land<00:03:26.200> it<00:03:27.200> does<00:03:27.470> kill<00:03:27.920> a<00:03:27.950> lot<00:03:28.220> of<00:03:28.340> the<00:03:28.430> fish

in and things you can go out one and

00:05:41.159 --> 00:05:43.010 
in and things you can go out one and
these<00:05:41.729> are<00:05:41.909> some<00:05:42.060> other<00:05:42.089> high<00:05:42.389> boots<00:05:42.689> just

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:43.020

00:05:47.699 --> 00:05:49.670 
here coming up there you go walk out
here<00:05:47.939> so<00:05:48.150> you<00:05:48.240> can<00:05:48.389> see<00:05:48.599> hopefully<00:05:49.289> this<00:05:49.529> won't
