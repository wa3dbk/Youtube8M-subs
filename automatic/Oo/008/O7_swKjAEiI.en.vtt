 hello youtube users but says the title the other day I was criticized what 

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:16.200
 means this a person that I know in real life complained because of 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:20.250
 image the messenger used to an anime character and not a picture of someone from the 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.779
 real life told me that I was in very good physical condition that was very cute and 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.500
 I do not lie to them because he told me that is to stop watching anime because it would be a 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.060
 pity that a young man like me was wrong then she told me a couple of things and 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.930
 Through this video I come to respond because that person sees my videos 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:41.190
 to start she tells me that I'm an idiot because she used a picture of a 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.350
 anime character 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.210
 then I see that she uses a picture of a model so I tell them that it is 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.889
 the same thing because that model is not her and the one in my picture is not me either 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.880
 she can use a photo that is not hers only because it is human 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.160
 I really do not see much difference 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.040
 Then she tells me that she leaves her house and that she has a social life 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.440
 which I answer that I have friends I had many girlfriends and she knows it because it was 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.680
 one of them I also go dancing and I go out with my friends but now I 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.930
 says that scott leaves something 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.940
 I tell her that it is the same and more I do more things because she is going to buy 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:21.190
 clothes to spend the street to buy six bonuses instead I'm going to buy 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:25.160
 things that me mexico and holiday makers sing but people with very good 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:30.030
 costly different characters but interviews and plunder chats ap games 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.930
 in group and other activities 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:33.370
 so if they tell me 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:36.320
 irak continues a taco festival I go to the festival 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.260
 another thing is that she says is that the girl is for less 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.560
 those little cartoons are five-year-old fans 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.220
 It caught my attention because I know as long as they go to 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.690
 she murders massacres 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.410
 is fucked up among other things which can be seen in adult novels 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:56.260
 so if she thinks that the children authors ham 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.830
 wrong because they do not have patience to present themselves as I do 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:03.930
 things because when I decided that to that novel called almost angels ucla 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.360
 criticism after being all seasons 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.420
 it's not like I saw two chapters and I said it was a shit if all the chapters 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.120
 of all seasons and after seeing bulls almost angels leciÃ±ena 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.179
 review 

00:02:15.179 --> 00:02:19.329
 she says that the tacos imitate the characters and that's why we dress up 

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:23.659
 as stupid and we seem retarded then he informed him that not all of us 

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:27.759
 we disguise in addition it is much healthier to do things the law of abortion than to imitate 

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:31.979
 or want to look like a model and therefore not eat sergi only to be 

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:35.189
 hours and hours in the gym eating energy bars 

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:39.419
 doubt my appearance and thousands of other problems suffered by models like this 

00:02:39.419 --> 00:02:43.250
 I do not know if I'm right you do not have it, but the league only one thing
