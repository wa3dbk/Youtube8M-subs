00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.130 
hatching right here and on this one it's
right<00:00:20.970> there<00:00:21.210> I<00:00:21.449> don't<00:00:21.689> know<00:00:21.750> if<00:00:21.840> you<00:00:21.900> can<00:00:21.990> see

right there I don't know if you can see

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.500 
right there I don't know if you can see
that<00:00:22.289> in<00:00:22.380> the<00:00:22.439> video<00:00:22.740> but<00:00:23.090> they're<00:00:24.090> easy<00:00:24.300> to

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
that in the video but they're easy to

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.960 
that in the video but they're easy to
spot<00:00:24.750> so<00:00:25.740> I'm<00:00:26.099> going<00:00:26.250> to<00:00:26.310> go<00:00:26.430> ahead<00:00:26.550> and<00:00:26.789> put

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
spot so I'm going to go ahead and put

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.300 
spot so I'm going to go ahead and put
those<00:00:27.119> in<00:00:27.390> put<00:00:27.599> the<00:00:27.720> starter<00:00:28.019> in<00:00:28.170> and<00:00:28.410> see<00:00:29.220> if

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
those in put the starter in and see if

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.370 
those in put the starter in and see if
maybe<00:00:29.460> I<00:00:29.640> can<00:00:29.760> get<00:00:29.910> it<00:00:30.000> to<00:00:30.179> a<00:00:30.210> crank<00:00:31.019> for<00:00:31.230> more

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
maybe I can get it to a crank for more

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.370 
maybe I can get it to a crank for more
than<00:00:31.500> a<00:00:31.529> half<00:00:31.800> a<00:00:32.009> second<00:00:32.899> well<00:00:33.899> everything's

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
than a half a second well everything's

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:35.180 
than a half a second well everything's
back<00:00:34.620> together

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
back together

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.940 
back together
starters<00:00:36.120> bolted<00:00:36.600> in<00:00:36.750> with<00:00:37.230> whole<00:00:37.440> bolts<00:00:37.800> this

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
starters bolted in with whole bolts this

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.270 
starters bolted in with whole bolts this
time<00:00:38.660> gas<00:00:39.660> tanks<00:00:40.050> mounted<00:00:40.200> shouldn't<00:00:41.190> go

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
time gas tanks mounted shouldn't go

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.970 
time gas tanks mounted shouldn't go
anywhere<00:00:41.460> brake<00:00:42.450> lines<00:00:42.690> are<00:00:42.899> snipped<00:00:43.170> off<00:00:43.320> you

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
anywhere brake lines are snipped off you

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.700 
anywhere brake lines are snipped off you
know<00:00:44.040> and<00:00:44.129> pinched<00:00:44.460> off<00:00:44.719> so<00:00:45.719> uh<00:00:45.750> I<00:00:46.170> think<00:00:46.620> we'll

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
know and pinched off so uh I think we'll

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.970 
know and pinched off so uh I think we'll
put<00:00:46.860> a<00:00:46.920> battery<00:00:47.100> in<00:00:47.250> it<00:00:47.399> and<00:00:47.520> try<00:00:47.670> it

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:48.980 
put a battery in it and try it

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.410 
put a battery in it and try it
well<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.190> endo<00:00:50.460> machine<00:00:50.820> should<00:00:51.030> be<00:00:51.090> ready<00:00:51.329> to

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
well the endo machine should be ready to

00:00:51.420 --> 00:01:32.830 
well the endo machine should be ready to
go<00:00:51.480> let's<00:00:52.230> try<00:00:52.440> it

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.270
