clear<00:00:50.880> duct<00:00:51.090> tape<00:00:51.270> over<00:00:51.420> and<00:00:51.600> run<00:00:51.900> it<00:00:52.020> up<00:00:52.140> here

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
clear duct tape over and run it up here

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.250 
clear duct tape over and run it up here
up<00:00:52.830> top<00:00:53.180> so<00:00:54.180> my<00:00:54.330> receiver<00:00:54.690> was<00:00:54.900> still<00:00:55.110> getting

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
up top so my receiver was still getting

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.200 
up top so my receiver was still getting
signal<00:00:55.710> even<00:00:56.100> though<00:00:56.220> I<00:00:56.250> was<00:00:56.490> submerged<00:00:57.060> in

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
signal even though I was submerged in

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.130 
signal even though I was submerged in
the<00:00:57.270> water<00:00:57.300> and<00:00:57.690> like<00:00:58.470> I<00:00:58.500> said<00:00:58.740> like<00:00:59.010> this<00:01:00.140> open

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
the water and like I said like this open

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.570 
the water and like I said like this open
diff<00:01:01.290> machine<00:01:01.650> would<00:01:01.890> have<00:01:02.040> been<00:01:02.130> able<00:01:02.280> to<00:01:02.460> do

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:02.580 
diff machine would have been able to do

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:06.380 
diff machine would have been able to do
that<00:01:03.199> because<00:01:04.580> it<00:01:05.580> would<00:01:05.760> have<00:01:05.850> got<00:01:05.970> bound<00:01:06.180> up

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
that because it would have got bound up

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.350 
that because it would have got bound up
too<00:01:06.540> easy<00:01:06.750> you<00:01:07.500> would<00:01:07.620> have<00:01:07.710> had<00:01:08.090> two<00:01:09.090> wheels

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
too easy you would have had two wheels

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.000 
too easy you would have had two wheels
hundred<00:01:09.780> percent<00:01:10.110> directions<00:01:10.530> head<00:01:10.740> of<00:01:10.830> four

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
hundred percent directions head of four

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.570 
hundred percent directions head of four
wheels<00:01:11.600> or<00:01:12.600> something<00:01:13.110> y'all<00:01:13.950> might<00:01:14.280> have

thicker<00:01:15.030> diff<00:01:15.330> falls<00:01:15.540> out<00:01:15.810> there<00:01:15.960> and

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
thicker diff falls out there and

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.280 
thicker diff falls out there and
everything<00:01:16.460> but<00:01:17.460> uh<00:01:17.600> for<00:01:18.600> what<00:01:18.630> I<00:01:18.810> do<00:01:18.870> lock
