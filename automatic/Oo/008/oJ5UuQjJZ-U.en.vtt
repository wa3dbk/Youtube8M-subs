00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.630 
you like it you can either match it one
on<00:01:35.520> one<00:01:35.549> or<00:01:36.030> you<00:01:36.720> can<00:01:36.780> do<00:01:37.110> one<00:01:37.560> part<00:01:37.950> less<00:01:38.400> so

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
on one or you can do one part less so

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.550 
on one or you can do one part less so
that<00:01:38.670> would<00:01:38.909> be<00:01:39.030> two<00:01:39.450> parts<00:01:39.780> cleanser<00:01:40.350> and

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
that would be two parts cleanser and

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.499 
that would be two parts cleanser and
then<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:40.979> one<00:01:41.130> part<00:01:41.400> limes<00:01:41.640> stimulating<00:01:42.360> and

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
then the one part limes stimulating and

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:43.910 
then the one part limes stimulating and
this<00:01:42.930> will<00:01:43.110> just<00:01:43.290> give<00:01:43.409> you<00:01:43.500> just<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.799> edge
