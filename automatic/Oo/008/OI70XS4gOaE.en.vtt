over the batsman's hit the screen a

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.380 
over the batsman's hit the screen a

the screen like umpire then caused it
but<00:00:32.189> I<00:00:32.399> think<00:00:32.460> that<00:00:32.640> was<00:00:32.850> a<00:00:32.880> mistake

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
but I think that was a mistake

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.330 
but I think that was a mistake
and<00:00:33.660> as<00:00:34.110> we<00:00:34.380> have<00:00:34.500> seen<00:00:34.739> on<00:00:34.920> so<00:00:35.070> many<00:00:35.130> occasions

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
and as we have seen on so many occasions

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.700 
and as we have seen on so many occasions
that<00:00:35.880> batsmen<00:00:36.390> have<00:00:36.510> been<00:00:36.690> out<00:00:36.930> and<00:00:37.200> the

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
that batsmen have been out and the

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.470 
that batsmen have been out and the
umpire<00:00:37.920> had<00:00:38.309> referred<00:00:38.670> it<00:00:38.820> upstairs<00:00:39.210> as<00:00:39.360> if

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
umpire had referred it upstairs as if

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.720 
umpire had referred it upstairs as if
it's<00:00:39.660> a<00:00:39.750> no<00:00:39.930> ball<00:00:40.170> or<00:00:40.440> not<00:00:40.469> not<00:00:41.100> no<00:00:41.460> one<00:00:41.610> has

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
it's a no ball or not not no one has

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.340 
it's a no ball or not not no one has
asked<00:00:42.059> him<00:00:42.180> to<00:00:42.210> do<00:00:42.450> that<00:00:42.600> he<00:00:42.809> has<00:00:42.899> referred<00:00:43.200> it

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
asked him to do that he has referred it

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.900 
asked him to do that he has referred it
because<00:00:43.590> you<00:00:43.710> think<00:00:43.890> it<00:00:44.010> might<00:00:44.280> be<00:00:44.309> unknowable

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
because you think it might be unknowable

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.420 
because you think it might be unknowable
when<00:00:45.570> things<00:00:46.020> like<00:00:46.200> that<00:00:46.260> happen<00:00:46.469> the

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
when things like that happen the

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.729 
when things like that happen the
fielding<00:00:47.850> team<00:00:47.910> should<00:00:48.360> have<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:49.050> right<00:00:49.289> to

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
fielding team should have the right to

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.770 
fielding team should have the right to
see<00:00:49.950> and<00:00:50.250> I<00:00:50.760> would<00:00:50.820> like<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.149> third<00:00:51.329> umpire<00:00:51.480> to

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
see and I would like the third umpire to

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.360 
see and I would like the third umpire to
have<00:00:51.899> a<00:00:51.930> look<00:00:52.140> at<00:00:52.230> that<00:00:52.350> I<00:00:52.559> do<00:00:52.620> not<00:00:53.039> think<00:00:53.250> that

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
have a look at that I do not think that

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.610 
have a look at that I do not think that

um<00:01:29.850> well<00:01:30.210> I<00:01:30.240> think<00:01:30.450> as<00:01:30.810> a<00:01:30.840> batsman<00:01:31.110> you<00:01:31.650> know

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
um well I think as a batsman you know

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.499 
um well I think as a batsman you know
you're<00:01:32.100> you're<00:01:32.520> reacting<00:01:32.670> to<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.119> ball<00:01:33.270> and<00:01:33.450> a

you're you're reacting to the ball and a

split-second so you know you Rohit
Sharma<00:01:36.600> was<00:01:36.750> obviously<00:01:37.079> trying<00:01:37.829> to

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
bad luck to the umpire well it's the

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.920 
bad luck to the umpire well it's the
wrong<00:02:15.830> decision<00:02:16.180> and<00:02:17.180> when<00:02:17.570> you<00:02:17.660> have<00:02:17.780> the

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
wrong decision and when you have the

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.360 
wrong decision and when you have the
option<00:02:18.260> of<00:02:18.320> actually<00:02:18.680> going<00:02:18.770> up<00:02:19.010> and<00:02:19.160> checking

option of actually going up and checking

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.850 
option of actually going up and checking
especially<00:02:19.910> then<00:02:20.150> well<00:02:20.870> when<00:02:21.230> Rohit<00:02:21.530> Sharma<00:02:21.830> I

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
especially then well when Rohit Sharma I

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.500 
especially then well when Rohit Sharma I
did<00:02:22.040> probably<00:02:22.340> thought<00:02:22.460> it<00:02:22.580> was<00:02:22.700> six<00:02:22.910> anyway

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
did probably thought it was six anyway

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.950 
did probably thought it was six anyway
though<00:02:23.660> I<00:02:24.280> need<00:02:25.280> already<00:02:25.580> made<00:02:25.760> the<00:02:25.880> call<00:02:26.030> it's

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:26.960 
though I need already made the call it's

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.840 
though I need already made the call it's
still<00:02:27.140> an<00:02:27.260> option<00:02:27.410> to<00:02:27.650> go<00:02:27.770> up<00:02:27.890> and<00:02:28.100> check<00:02:28.250> and

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:28.850 
still an option to go up and check and

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:30.490 
still an option to go up and check and
those<00:02:29.180> decisions<00:02:29.450> are<00:02:29.780> allowed<00:02:29.930> who<00:02:30.080> can<00:02:30.320> go

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
those decisions are allowed who can go

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.680 
those decisions are allowed who can go
up<00:02:30.620> and<00:02:30.770> check<00:02:30.920> those<00:02:31.070> decisions<00:02:31.580> so<00:02:31.640> very<00:02:32.390> I

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
up and check those decisions so very I

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:34.630 
up and check those decisions so very I
think<00:02:32.840> Bangladesh<00:02:33.290> will<00:02:33.440> feel<00:02:33.620> very<00:02:34.190> hot<00:02:34.430> done

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
think Bangladesh will feel very hot done

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.810 
think Bangladesh will feel very hot done
by<00:02:34.790> there<00:02:34.970> because<00:02:35.270> from<00:02:35.870> 90<00:02:36.260> to<00:02:36.350> 137<00:02:37.130> and<00:02:37.700> he

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:37.820 
by there because from 90 to 137 and he

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:39.370 
by there because from 90 to 137 and he
scored<00:02:38.060> those<00:02:38.210> runs<00:02:38.450> very<00:02:38.630> very<00:02:38.810> quickly<00:02:39.080> just

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
scored those runs very very quickly just

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.500 
scored those runs very very quickly just
got<00:02:39.560> another<00:02:39.800> partnership<00:02:40.370> going<00:02:40.490> and<00:02:40.760> filled

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
got another partnership going and filled

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:43.090 
got another partnership going and filled
up<00:02:41.630> probably<00:02:41.900> won't<00:02:42.020> have<00:02:42.140> got<00:02:42.320> to<00:02:42.470> stay<00:02:42.950> on<00:02:42.980> it

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.100 
up probably won't have got to stay on it

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:44.860 
up probably won't have got to stay on it
if<00:02:43.310> that<00:02:43.970> decision<00:02:44.390> would<00:02:44.510> have<00:02:44.540> been<00:02:44.720> changed
