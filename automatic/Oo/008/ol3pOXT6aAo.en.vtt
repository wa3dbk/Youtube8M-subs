00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
into the chamber I have the ceramic

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.889 
into the chamber I have the ceramic
piece<00:00:58.770> that<00:00:59.010> they<00:00:59.100> gave<00:00:59.340> me<00:00:59.579> or<00:00:59.899> automatically

with<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.199> piece<00:01:01.440> and<00:01:01.680> then<00:01:02.489> I<00:01:03.619> modified<00:01:04.619> a

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
with the piece and then I modified a

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.929 
with the piece and then I modified a
bowl<00:01:05.070> and<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.640> existing<00:01:06.119> wire<00:01:06.540> so<00:01:07.530> that<00:01:07.560> way

00:01:07.929 --> 00:01:07.939 
bowl and the existing wire so that way

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:12.170 
bowl and the existing wire so that way
there'd<00:01:08.939> go<00:01:09.150> into<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.479> chamber<00:01:09.900> and<00:01:11.060> from<00:01:12.060> the

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
there'd go into the chamber and from the

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.240 
there'd go into the chamber and from the
modifications<00:01:12.840> it<00:01:13.080> would<00:01:13.200> spark<00:01:13.530> only<00:01:14.070> at<00:01:14.130> the

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
modifications it would spark only at the

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.870 
modifications it would spark only at the
tip<00:01:14.460> of<00:01:14.490> it<00:01:14.729> all<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.119> time<00:01:15.500> otherwise<00:01:16.880> you

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
tip of it all the time otherwise you

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.490 
tip of it all the time otherwise you
might<00:01:18.030> see<00:01:19.220> go<00:01:20.220> off<00:01:20.430> towards<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:20.939> edge<00:01:21.210> it's

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
might see go off towards the edge it's

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.920 
might see go off towards the edge it's
sides<00:01:22.920> that's<00:01:23.760> not<00:01:23.940> that<00:01:24.090> good<00:01:24.530> so<00:01:26.210> to<00:01:27.210> hold

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930
