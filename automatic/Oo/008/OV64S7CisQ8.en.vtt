made<00:01:44.950> a<00:01:44.980> bit<00:01:45.160> of<00:01:45.190> a<00:01:45.310> mistake<00:01:45.850> of<00:01:46.330> this<00:01:46.480> already

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.630 
made a bit of a mistake of this already

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:48.570 
made a bit of a mistake of this already
I'd<00:01:47.320> only<00:01:47.470> use<00:01:47.710> the<00:01:47.830> hand<00:01:47.980> brake<00:01:48.190> too<00:01:48.370> much

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:48.580 
I'd only use the hand brake too much

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:50.220 
I'd only use the hand brake too much
because<00:01:48.760> I<00:01:48.880> know<00:01:48.940> using<00:01:49.570> the<00:01:49.630> hand<00:01:49.840> brake<00:01:50.050> is

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:50.230 
because I know using the hand brake is

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:53.040 
because I know using the hand brake is
bad<00:01:50.940> it's<00:01:51.940> already<00:01:52.060> use<00:01:52.330> it<00:01:52.450> too<00:01:52.630> much<00:01:52.660> it's

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.050 
bad it's already use it too much it's

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.830 
bad it's already use it too much it's
bad<00:01:53.260> so<00:01:53.950> i<00:01:54.220> might<00:01:54.430> even<00:01:54.460> advantage<00:01:54.970> in<00:01:55.180> over

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840
