Hyundai<00:00:26.519> is<00:00:26.640> traditionally<00:00:27.330> strong<00:00:27.630> and<00:00:28.260> it

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
Hyundai is traditionally strong and it

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.540 
Hyundai is traditionally strong and it
is<00:00:28.500> definitely<00:00:28.650> more<00:00:28.980> global<00:00:29.340> than<00:00:29.490> the

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
is definitely more global than the

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.759 
is definitely more global than the
previous<00:00:29.880> generation<00:00:29.910> so<00:00:30.689> we're<00:00:30.900> going<00:00:31.529> to<00:00:31.679> be

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
previous generation so we're going to be

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.920 
previous generation so we're going to be
selling<00:00:31.980> for<00:00:32.309> Europe<00:00:32.550> for<00:00:32.700> the<00:00:32.759> first<00:00:32.969> time<00:00:33.149> so

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
selling for Europe for the first time so

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.080 
selling for Europe for the first time so
that's<00:00:34.230> actually<00:00:34.559> very<00:00:34.770> big<00:00:35.130> news<00:00:35.309> for<00:00:35.520> us<00:00:35.610> so

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
that's actually very big news for us so

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.930 
that's actually very big news for us so
and<00:00:36.840> I<00:00:37.410> think<00:00:37.440> you<00:00:37.890> see<00:00:38.070> that<00:00:38.100> poly<00:00:38.460> in<00:00:38.610> some<00:00:38.790> of
