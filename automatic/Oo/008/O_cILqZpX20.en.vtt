threes<00:01:59.790> I<00:02:00.000> could<00:02:00.149> have<00:02:00.240> had<00:02:00.390> more<00:02:00.750> I<00:02:01.079> could

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
threes I could have had more I could

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.530 
threes I could have had more I could
have<00:02:01.710> had<00:02:01.799> a<00:02:01.829> lot<00:02:02.040> less<00:02:02.310> I<00:02:02.640> barely<00:02:03.270> had<00:02:03.509> enough

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
have had a lot less I barely had enough

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.609 
have had a lot less I barely had enough
fours<00:02:04.110> and<00:02:04.500> I<00:02:04.680> had<00:02:04.890> enough<00:02:05.399> fives<00:02:05.930> so<00:02:06.930> looking

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
fours and I had enough fives so looking

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.290 
fours and I had enough fives so looking
at<00:02:07.740> this<00:02:07.920> graph<00:02:08.129> what<00:02:08.729> I<00:02:08.759> would<00:02:09.060> immediately

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
at this graph what I would immediately

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.370 
at this graph what I would immediately
think<00:02:09.750> to<00:02:09.899> myself

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
think to myself

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.890 
think to myself
health<00:02:10.500> is<00:02:10.920> I've<00:02:11.520> got<00:02:11.880> to<00:02:11.910> look<00:02:12.510> I've<00:02:12.690> got

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
health is I've got to look I've got

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.850 
health is I've got to look I've got
seven<00:02:13.320> ones<00:02:13.950> and<00:02:14.490> I<00:02:14.670> can<00:02:14.880> only<00:02:15.120> have<00:02:15.740> three<00:02:16.740> or

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
seven ones and I can only have three or

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.120 
seven ones and I can only have three or
four<00:02:17.190> so<00:02:17.910> I've<00:02:18.060> got<00:02:18.330> to<00:02:18.360> take<00:02:19.170> some<00:02:19.380> of<00:02:19.560> my<00:02:19.830> ones

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
four so I've got to take some of my ones

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.150 
four so I've got to take some of my ones
and<00:02:20.490> make<00:02:20.790> them<00:02:21.030> twos<00:02:21.360> and<00:02:21.870> probably<00:02:22.860> what<00:02:23.070> I'm

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
and make them twos and probably what I'm

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.900 
and make them twos and probably what I'm
going<00:02:23.310> to<00:02:23.340> do<00:02:23.520> is<00:02:23.820> move<00:02:24.600> three<00:02:25.290> of<00:02:25.530> my<00:02:25.980> ones

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
going to do is move three of my ones

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.020 
going to do is move three of my ones
over<00:02:27.720> to<00:02:27.930> tues<00:02:28.170> and<00:02:28.650> that<00:02:29.220> will<00:02:29.400> keep<00:02:29.580> me<00:02:29.640> in

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
over to tues and that will keep me in

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.960 
over to tues and that will keep me in
compliance<00:02:30.690> with<00:02:30.930> one's<00:02:31.320> and<00:02:31.680> with<00:02:32.190> tues<00:02:32.520> and

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
compliance with one's and with tues and

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.330 
compliance with one's and with tues and
I<00:02:33.420> will<00:02:33.570> be<00:02:33.690> done<00:02:33.870> very<00:02:34.290> very<00:02:34.350> quickly<00:02:34.530> it<00:02:35.130> may

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
I will be done very very quickly it may

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.300 
I will be done very very quickly it may
be<00:02:35.400> that<00:02:35.580> I<00:02:35.760> also<00:02:35.970> move<00:02:36.300> a<00:02:36.390> 2<00:02:36.540> over<00:02:36.840> 2<00:02:37.050> a<00:02:37.080> 3<00:02:37.310> that

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
be that I also move a 2 over 2 a 3 that

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.390 
be that I also move a 2 over 2 a 3 that
would<00:02:38.490> work<00:02:38.700> in<00:02:38.910> this<00:02:39.030> particular<00:02:39.300> case<00:02:39.830> I<00:02:40.830> may

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
would work in this particular case I may

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.950 
would work in this particular case I may
even<00:02:41.490> rethink<00:02:41.940> some<00:02:42.090> my<00:02:42.210> other<00:02:42.360> answers<00:02:42.750> but

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:42.960 
even rethink some my other answers but

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:46.190 
even rethink some my other answers but
in<00:02:43.110> terms<00:02:43.350> of<00:02:43.590> following<00:02:44.160> the<00:02:44.340> bell<00:02:44.970> curve<00:02:45.200> in

in terms of following the bell curve in

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 
what is more and less important for this

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:53.420 
what is more and less important for this
particular<00:02:51.780> job<00:02:52.020> in<00:02:52.350> this<00:02:52.860> case<00:02:53.100> what<00:02:53.340> I'm

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
particular job in this case what I'm

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:54.920 
particular job in this case what I'm
going<00:02:53.550> to<00:02:53.610> be<00:02:53.670> most<00:02:53.910> concerned<00:02:54.150> about<00:02:54.450> is

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
going to be most concerned about is

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.510 
going to be most concerned about is
taking<00:02:55.140> a<00:02:55.350> look<00:02:55.500> at<00:02:55.590> all<00:02:55.680> my<00:02:55.710> ones<00:02:56.100> and<00:02:56.370> ask

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
taking a look at all my ones and ask

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.190 
taking a look at all my ones and ask
myself<00:02:56.760> could<00:02:57.360> I<00:02:57.480> not<00:02:57.600> make<00:02:57.840> some<00:02:58.020> of<00:02:58.110> them

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
myself could I not make some of them

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:03.320 
myself could I not make some of them
tues<00:02:58.500> so<00:02:59.280> that<00:02:59.430> I<00:02:59.460> could<00:02:59.550> be<00:02:59.910> within<00:03:00.330> tolerance
