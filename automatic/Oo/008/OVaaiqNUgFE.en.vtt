much has changed so let's do the

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.300 
much has changed so let's do the
comparison<00:02:59.579> between<00:03:00.090> this<00:03:00.600> and<00:03:01.500> the

comparison between this and the

toys-r-us build a figure right away you

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.910 
toys-r-us build a figure right away you
can<00:03:05.310> notice<00:03:05.880> that<00:03:06.569> what<00:03:06.930> I<00:03:06.959> mentioned<00:03:07.650> about

can notice that what I mentioned about

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.650 
can notice that what I mentioned about
the<00:03:08.100> hair<00:03:08.370> that<00:03:08.640> sticks<00:03:09.030> out<00:03:09.359> the<00:03:09.420> most

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660 
the hair that sticks out the most

probably with the new head and the backs

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:29.870 
probably with the new head and the backs
are<00:03:28.829> totally<00:03:29.280> different

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
are totally different

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:35.390 
are totally different
this<00:03:30.359> one<00:03:30.600> has<00:03:30.840> red<00:03:32.060> black<00:03:33.230> no<00:03:34.370> nothing<00:03:35.370> just

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
this one has red black no nothing just

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.090 
this one has red black no nothing just
flames<00:03:36.030> that's<00:03:36.930> really<00:03:37.380> cool<00:03:37.680> because<00:03:37.859> they

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
flames that's really cool because they

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.009 
flames that's really cool because they
are<00:03:38.130> very<00:03:38.760> different<00:03:39.030> I<00:03:39.329> wasn't<00:03:39.780> going<00:03:39.930> to

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019 
are very different I wasn't going to

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:41.960 
are very different I wasn't going to
pick<00:03:40.319> up<00:03:40.500> this<00:03:40.680> one<00:03:40.739> because<00:03:41.519> I<00:03:41.639> thought<00:03:41.790> they

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
pick up this one because I thought they

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:43.849 
pick up this one because I thought they
were<00:03:42.030> relatively<00:03:42.569> the<00:03:42.780> same<00:03:42.989> but<00:03:43.440> they<00:03:43.650> are

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:43.859 
were relatively the same but they are

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:47.599 
were relatively the same but they are
more<00:03:44.850> different<00:03:45.420> than<00:03:45.630> the<00:03:46.380> John<00:03:46.680> Cena<00:03:47.010> a<00:03:47.340> week

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:47.609 
more different than the John Cena a week

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:51.729 
more different than the John Cena a week
from<00:03:47.880> the<00:03:48.000> set<00:03:49.250> do<00:03:50.250> I<00:03:50.280> think<00:03:50.579> it's<00:03:50.730> a<00:03:50.970> necessary

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:51.739 
from the set do I think it's a necessary

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:54.140 
from the set do I think it's a necessary
upgrade<00:03:52.739> if<00:03:52.889> you<00:03:53.040> already<00:03:53.519> have<00:03:53.819> the

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
upgrade if you already have the

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.690 
upgrade if you already have the
toys-r-us<00:03:55.079> build<00:03:55.440> a<00:03:55.560> figure<00:03:55.709> not<00:03:56.280> really

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
toys-r-us build a figure not really

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.690 
toys-r-us build a figure not really
unless<00:03:57.000> you<00:03:57.180> get<00:03:57.329> a<00:03:57.389> cheap<00:03:58.459> loose<00:03:59.459> or

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
unless you get a cheap loose or

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.990 
unless you get a cheap loose or
something<00:04:00.180> because<00:04:01.280> it's<00:04:02.280> it's<00:04:02.669> basically

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
something because it's it's basically

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.340 
something because it's it's basically
the<00:04:03.479> same<00:04:04.040> unless<00:04:05.040> you<00:04:05.220> love<00:04:05.609> the

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:06.350 
the same unless you love the

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:07.960 
the same unless you love the
design<00:04:06.800> enough<00:04:07.160> that<00:04:07.400> he's<00:04:07.580> wearing<00:04:07.730> it's

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:07.970 
design enough that he's wearing it's

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:09.880 
design enough that he's wearing it's
really<00:04:08.330> cool<00:04:08.540> but<00:04:09.110> I<00:04:09.140> might<00:04:09.440> personally

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:09.890 
really cool but I might personally

with this because I never got one that
has<00:04:55.670> the<00:04:56.210> correct<00:04:56.630> tonality<00:04:57.230> between<00:04:57.920> the<00:04:58.160> two

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:00.830 
and it's not the worst head skin it's

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:03.460 
and it's not the worst head skin it's
just<00:05:01.040> not<00:05:01.370> very<00:05:01.600> accurate<00:05:02.600> to<00:05:02.630> contemporary
