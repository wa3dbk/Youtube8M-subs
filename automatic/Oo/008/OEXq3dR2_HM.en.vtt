in<00:02:59.440> there<00:02:59.650> right<00:03:00.040> there<00:03:00.280> it's<00:03:00.790> all<00:03:01.030> good<00:03:01.300> to<00:03:01.480> go

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
in there right there it's all good to go

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.210 
in there right there it's all good to go
and<00:03:01.900> it's<00:03:02.019> basically<00:03:02.200> like<00:03:02.560> you<00:03:02.769> can<00:03:02.950> sort<00:03:03.100> of

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
and it's basically like you can sort of

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.009 
and it's basically like you can sort of
mark<00:03:03.489> all<00:03:03.670> these<00:03:04.120> different<00:03:04.360> worlds<00:03:04.690> because

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:05.019 
mark all these different worlds because

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:07.920 
mark all these different worlds because
trove<00:03:05.410> isn't<00:03:05.830> just<00:03:06.160> one<00:03:06.820> world<00:03:07.420> it's<00:03:07.750> actually

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
trove isn't just one world it's actually

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.770 
trove isn't just one world it's actually
many<00:03:08.440> instanced<00:03:09.220> worlds<00:03:09.730> together<00:03:09.910> you<00:03:10.690> have

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
many instanced worlds together you have

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.300 
many instanced worlds together you have
a<00:03:10.870> hub<00:03:11.110> world<00:03:11.530> and<00:03:11.800> then<00:03:11.890> you<00:03:11.950> have<00:03:12.070> all<00:03:12.100> these

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
a hub world and then you have all these

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.310 
a hub world and then you have all these
different<00:03:12.519> kinds<00:03:12.940> of<00:03:13.060> zones<00:03:13.810> and<00:03:14.140> there's

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:14.320 
different kinds of zones and there's

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:15.660 
different kinds of zones and there's
lots<00:03:14.470> of<00:03:14.530> different<00:03:14.800> biomes<00:03:15.130> within<00:03:15.459> these

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
lots of different biomes within these

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.789 
lots of different biomes within these
zones<00:03:15.850> so<00:03:16.450> it<00:03:16.810> just<00:03:17.320> works<00:03:17.470> really<00:03:17.650> well

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:17.799 
zones so it just works really well

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:19.500 
zones so it just works really well
normally<00:03:18.400> minecraft<00:03:18.700> is<00:03:18.790> just<00:03:18.940> one<00:03:19.090> big<00:03:19.120> world

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
normally minecraft is just one big world

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:21.360 
normally minecraft is just one big world
that's<00:03:19.750> really<00:03:20.140> laggy<00:03:20.440> and<00:03:20.769> at<00:03:21.040> the<00:03:21.130> same<00:03:21.310> time

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
that's really laggy and at the same time

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:23.009 
that's really laggy and at the same time
even<00:03:21.850> though<00:03:21.910> it<00:03:22.000> is<00:03:22.060> one<00:03:22.209> big<00:03:22.390> world<00:03:22.600> all<00:03:22.870> the

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:23.019 
even though it is one big world all the

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:24.509 
even though it is one big world all the
different<00:03:23.290> servers<00:03:23.680> are<00:03:23.829> split<00:03:24.130> up<00:03:24.280> and

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:24.519 
different servers are split up and

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:25.470 
different servers are split up and
sometimes<00:03:24.790> it's<00:03:24.940> difficult<00:03:24.970> to<00:03:25.329> get<00:03:25.450> into

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
sometimes it's difficult to get into

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.360 
sometimes it's difficult to get into
these<00:03:25.840> servers<00:03:26.160> sometimes<00:03:27.160> you<00:03:27.280> need

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
these servers sometimes you need

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:28.979 
these servers sometimes you need
passwords<00:03:27.940> sometimes<00:03:28.540> there's<00:03:28.780> just<00:03:28.810> too

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:28.989 
passwords sometimes there's just too

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:30.569 
passwords sometimes there's just too
many<00:03:29.079> people<00:03:29.200> lots<00:03:30.010> and<00:03:30.130> lots<00:03:30.250> of<00:03:30.310> different

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:30.579 
many people lots and lots of different

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:32.250 
many people lots and lots of different
rules<00:03:30.670> but<00:03:30.940> in<00:03:31.030> this<00:03:31.120> game<00:03:31.239> I<00:03:31.540> really<00:03:32.019> like<00:03:32.140> the

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 
rules but in this game I really like the

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.130 
rules but in this game I really like the
MMO<00:03:32.650> approach<00:03:32.950> to<00:03:33.250> it<00:03:33.430> where<00:03:33.640> it<00:03:33.880> is<00:03:33.940> a<00:03:34.150> MMO<00:03:34.959> it

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 
MMO approach to it where it is a MMO it

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:36.780 
MMO approach to it where it is a MMO it
is<00:03:35.260> a<00:03:35.290> massively<00:03:35.769> multiplayer<00:03:36.070> online<00:03:36.250> game

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
is a massively multiplayer online game

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.479 
is a massively multiplayer online game
but<00:03:37.000> it's<00:03:37.209> separated<00:03:37.810> and<00:03:38.500> I<00:03:38.680> really<00:03:39.220> enjoy

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:39.489 
but it's separated and I really enjoy

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:43.020 
but it's separated and I really enjoy
that<00:03:39.840> so<00:03:40.840> trove<00:03:41.320> what<00:03:41.709> can<00:03:41.920> you<00:03:42.100> do<00:03:42.400> well<00:03:42.940> you

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
that so trove what can you do well you

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.509 
that so trove what can you do well you
can<00:03:43.180> craft<00:03:43.420> things<00:03:43.750> I<00:03:44.049> guess<00:03:44.320> but<00:03:44.860> what<00:03:45.280> makes

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:45.519 
can craft things I guess but what makes

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:46.380 
can craft things I guess but what makes
it<00:03:45.640> really<00:03:45.790> cool<00:03:46.000> is<00:03:46.060> that<00:03:46.090> can<00:03:46.269> actually

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:46.390 
it really cool is that can actually

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:47.850 
it really cool is that can actually
craft<00:03:46.720> items<00:03:47.019> that<00:03:47.110> other<00:03:47.230> people<00:03:47.470> can<00:03:47.590> use

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:47.860 
craft items that other people can use

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:50.160 
craft items that other people can use
you<00:03:48.610> can<00:03:48.820> make<00:03:49.030> your<00:03:49.120> cornerstone<00:03:49.630> which<00:03:50.049> is

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:50.170 
you can make your cornerstone which is

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:51.630 
you can make your cornerstone which is
sort<00:03:50.320> of<00:03:50.350> your<00:03:50.500> home<00:03:50.680> base<00:03:50.920> like<00:03:51.220> I<00:03:51.340> said<00:03:51.519> you

and basically you're just gonna have a
good<00:04:21.760> time<00:04:21.820> but<00:04:22.240> that<00:04:22.330> doesn't<00:04:22.630> mean<00:04:22.750> it's<00:04:22.780> a

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.020 
good time but that doesn't mean it's a

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:24.700 
good time but that doesn't mean it's a
casual<00:04:23.440> experience<00:04:24.010> like<00:04:24.130> I<00:04:24.250> said

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:24.710 
casual experience like I said

have<00:04:45.440> kind<00:04:45.620> of<00:04:45.740> skin<00:04:46.009> so<00:04:46.220> if<00:04:46.310> you<00:04:46.370> have<00:04:46.490> a

graphics I know you're already thinking

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:06.879 
graphics I know you're already thinking
that's<00:05:05.449> actually<00:05:05.780> pretty<00:05:05.930> cool<00:05:06.169> at<00:05:06.440> first<00:05:06.740> I

00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:06.889 
that's actually pretty cool at first I

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:08.860

was<00:05:06.979> a<00:05:07.039> little<00:05:07.070> bit<00:05:07.340> thrown<00:05:07.490> off<00:05:07.699> I<00:05:07.940> didn't

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:08.870 
was a little bit thrown off I didn't

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:10.300 
was a little bit thrown off I didn't
know<00:05:08.900> how<00:05:09.199> I<00:05:09.229> would<00:05:09.440> like<00:05:09.680> it<00:05:09.830> but<00:05:09.979> it<00:05:10.130> actually

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:10.310 
know how I would like it but it actually

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:12.520 
know how I would like it but it actually
runs<00:05:10.669> really<00:05:10.970> really<00:05:11.330> well<00:05:11.539> it<00:05:11.810> is<00:05:12.259> cell

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:12.530 
runs really really well it is cell

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:14.620 
runs really really well it is cell
shaded<00:05:12.979> and<00:05:13.070> at<00:05:13.639> the<00:05:13.789> same<00:05:13.970> time<00:05:14.030> even<00:05:14.539> though

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:14.630 
shaded and at the same time even though

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:16.390 
shaded and at the same time even though
it<00:05:14.750> is<00:05:14.780> blocky<00:05:15.139> it<00:05:15.380> still<00:05:15.590> just<00:05:15.620> looks<00:05:16.190> and

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:16.400 
it is blocky it still just looks and

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:17.770 
it is blocky it still just looks and
feels<00:05:16.610> really<00:05:16.880> good<00:05:17.060> with<00:05:17.210> the<00:05:17.240> physics<00:05:17.690> and

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:17.780 
feels really good with the physics and

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:19.540 
feels really good with the physics and
the<00:05:17.870> lighting<00:05:18.139> the<00:05:18.349> post-processing<00:05:19.009> even<00:05:19.430> on

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:19.550 
the lighting the post-processing even on

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:22.270 
the lighting the post-processing even on
low<00:05:19.849> and<00:05:20.150> high<00:05:20.900> in<00:05:21.169> between<00:05:21.530> all<00:05:21.949> the<00:05:22.099> graphics

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:22.280 
low and high in between all the graphics

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:23.770 
low and high in between all the graphics
it<00:05:22.610> just<00:05:22.880> seems<00:05:23.300> really<00:05:23.479> nice<00:05:23.720> and

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:23.780 
it just seems really nice and

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:25.659 
it just seems really nice and
Atmospheric<00:05:24.470> you're<00:05:24.889> not<00:05:25.069> ever<00:05:25.220> gonna<00:05:25.370> be

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:25.669 
Atmospheric you're not ever gonna be

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:27.370 
Atmospheric you're not ever gonna be
like<00:05:25.849> all<00:05:26.060> the<00:05:26.180> scream<00:05:26.449> looks<00:05:26.659> ugly<00:05:27.139> unless

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:27.380 
like all the scream looks ugly unless

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:29.320 
like all the scream looks ugly unless
you<00:05:27.530> just<00:05:27.650> absolutely<00:05:28.340> hate<00:05:28.430> the<00:05:28.789> blocky<00:05:29.030> art

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:29.330 
you just absolutely hate the blocky art

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:32.200 
you just absolutely hate the blocky art
style<00:05:29.599> because<00:05:29.870> unlike<00:05:30.530> minecraft<00:05:31.210> there's

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:32.210 
style because unlike minecraft there's

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:33.969 
style because unlike minecraft there's
lots<00:05:32.570> and<00:05:32.870> lots<00:05:33.050> of<00:05:33.169> blocks<00:05:33.440> you<00:05:33.650> don't<00:05:33.800> just

00:05:33.969 --> 00:05:33.979 
lots and lots of blocks you don't just

00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:36.129 
lots and lots of blocks you don't just
have<00:05:34.099> one<00:05:34.340> size<00:05:34.639> of<00:05:34.849> blocks<00:05:35.060> so<00:05:35.360> sometimes<00:05:35.900> I

00:05:36.129 --> 00:05:36.139 
have one size of blocks so sometimes I

00:05:36.139 --> 00:05:37.659 
have one size of blocks so sometimes I
guess<00:05:36.349> you<00:05:36.770> can<00:05:36.889> think<00:05:36.949> about<00:05:37.070> it<00:05:37.250> it<00:05:37.340> seems<00:05:37.550> a

00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:37.669 
guess you can think about it it seems a

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:39.520 
guess you can think about it it seems a
little<00:05:37.820> bit<00:05:37.940> chaotic<00:05:38.180> I<00:05:38.690> mean<00:05:39.139> if<00:05:39.229> you<00:05:39.320> look<00:05:39.440> at

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:39.530 
little bit chaotic I mean if you look at

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:40.659 
little bit chaotic I mean if you look at
the<00:05:39.620> Knights<00:05:39.860> armor<00:05:40.250> and<00:05:40.340> everything<00:05:40.580> you

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:40.669 
the Knights armor and everything you

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:42.070 
the Knights armor and everything you
just<00:05:40.820> it's<00:05:41.210> just<00:05:41.270> one<00:05:41.449> of<00:05:41.479> those<00:05:41.570> art<00:05:41.780> styles

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:42.080 
just it's just one of those art styles

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:43.990 
just it's just one of those art styles
like<00:05:42.320> when<00:05:42.469> you<00:05:42.560> first<00:05:42.740> met<00:05:43.219> minecraft<00:05:43.759> right

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:44.000 
like when you first met minecraft right

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.670 
like when you first met minecraft right
you<00:05:44.150> probably<00:05:44.389> thought<00:05:44.599> I<00:05:44.780> don't<00:05:45.500> know<00:05:45.590> about

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:45.680 
you probably thought I don't know about

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:46.959 
you probably thought I don't know about
this<00:05:45.860> art<00:05:46.039> style<00:05:46.280> but<00:05:46.400> then<00:05:46.490> you<00:05:46.580> grow<00:05:46.789> and

00:05:46.959 --> 00:05:46.969 
this art style but then you grow and

00:05:46.969 --> 00:05:48.100 
this art style but then you grow and
love<00:05:47.120> it<00:05:47.270> and<00:05:47.389> you<00:05:47.479> find<00:05:47.690> that<00:05:47.810> has<00:05:47.960> a<00:05:47.990> lot<00:05:48.080> of

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:48.110
