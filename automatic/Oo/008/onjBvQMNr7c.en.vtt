got to say this is a very interesting

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.490 
got to say this is a very interesting
watch<00:00:26.800> and<00:00:27.190> I've<00:00:27.340> been<00:00:27.610> a<00:00:27.640> huge<00:00:28.180> cartier<00:00:29.110> fan

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:29.500

watch and I've been a huge cartier fan

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:34.120 
and one thing about Cartier is that what

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:35.850 
and one thing about Cartier is that what
they<00:00:34.330> tend<00:00:34.720> to<00:00:34.930> do<00:00:35.110> is<00:00:35.320> they're<00:00:35.559> a<00:00:35.590> very

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:35.860 
they tend to do is they're a very

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.030 
they tend to do is they're a very
traditional<00:00:36.720> company<00:00:37.720> but<00:00:38.500> they're<00:00:38.739> always

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:39.040 
traditional company but they're always

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.110 
traditional company but they're always
at<00:00:39.460> the<00:00:39.610> cutting<00:00:40.090> edge<00:00:40.330> of<00:00:40.570> design<00:00:41.080> now<00:00:42.120> the

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:43.120 
at the cutting edge of design now the

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.240 
at the cutting edge of design now the
downside<00:00:43.420> of<00:00:43.930> that<00:00:43.960> is<00:00:44.140> is<00:00:44.500> that<00:00:44.710> some<00:00:45.070> of

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:45.250 
downside of that is is that some of

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.880 
downside of that is is that some of
their<00:00:45.460> cartier<00:00:46.390> pieces<00:00:46.960> they<00:00:47.199> keep<00:00:47.530> for<00:00:47.830> a

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:47.890 
their cartier pieces they keep for a

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.430 
their cartier pieces they keep for a
couple<00:00:48.280> of<00:00:48.339> seasons<00:00:48.640> and<00:00:49.239> then<00:00:49.540> they<00:00:49.750> ditch

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:50.440 
couple of seasons and then they ditch

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.960 
couple of seasons and then they ditch
for<00:00:51.280> example<00:00:51.879> the<00:00:52.360> cartier<00:00:53.199> Santos<00:00:54.100> it's<00:00:54.640> now

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:54.970 
for example the cartier Santos it's now

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:57.329 
for example the cartier Santos it's now
become<00:00:55.449> the<00:00:55.600> Santos<00:00:56.049> 100<00:00:56.830> whereas<00:00:57.190> the

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:57.339 
become the Santos 100 whereas the

00:00:57.339 --> 00:01:00.539 
become the Santos 100 whereas the
traditional<00:00:57.570> Santos<00:00:58.570> is<00:00:58.870> no<00:00:59.799> longer<00:01:00.070> to<00:01:00.370> be

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:00.549 
traditional Santos is no longer to be

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:05.760 
traditional Santos is no longer to be
seen<00:01:00.580> and<00:01:02.699> that's<00:01:03.699> the<00:01:04.089> downside<00:01:04.780> of<00:01:05.199> this<00:01:05.530> is

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:05.770 
seen and that's the downside of this is

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.910 
seen and that's the downside of this is
is<00:01:05.950> that<00:01:05.979> on<00:01:06.549> the<00:01:06.700> second-hand<00:01:07.299> market<00:01:07.920> they

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:08.920 
is that on the second-hand market they

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.460 
is that on the second-hand market they
can<00:01:09.190> be<00:01:09.340> very<00:01:09.729> savage<00:01:10.479> that<00:01:10.840> the<00:01:11.080> the

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:11.470 
can be very savage that the the

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:14.160 
can be very savage that the the
retention<00:01:12.010> of<00:01:12.400> value<00:01:12.820> can<00:01:13.030> be<00:01:13.180> quite<00:01:13.510> savage

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 
retention of value can be quite savage

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.520 
retention of value can be quite savage
and<00:01:14.790> even<00:01:15.790> the<00:01:16.000> traditional<00:01:16.210> stead<00:01:17.020> like<00:01:17.350> the

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:17.530 
and even the traditional stead like the

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.280 
and even the traditional stead like the

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:27.240 
no longer available and it's also
savaged<00:01:23.310> but<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:25.750> other<00:01:25.900> side<00:01:26.200> is<00:01:26.410> is<00:01:26.650> Cartier

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:36.010 
cutting edge and I got to say when I saw

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:40.710 
cutting edge and I got to say when I saw
the<00:01:36.280> ball<00:01:36.640> on<00:01:36.850> blue<00:01:37.180> I<00:01:37.950> was<00:01:38.950> just<00:01:39.250> amazed<00:01:39.720> the

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:40.720 
the ball on blue I was just amazed the

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:45.140 
the ball on blue I was just amazed the
way<00:01:40.930> they<00:01:41.290> moved<00:01:41.860> the<00:01:42.160> winding<00:01:42.730> crown<00:01:43.320> into

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:45.150 
way they moved the winding crown into

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:49.260 
way they moved the winding crown into
away<00:01:46.150> from<00:01:46.480> the<00:01:46.630> traditional<00:01:47.350> spot<00:01:47.770> and<00:01:48.270> how

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
away from the traditional spot and how

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.630 
away from the traditional spot and how
they<00:01:49.510> did<00:01:49.780> it<00:01:49.960> I<00:01:50.080> just<00:01:50.170> thought<00:01:50.710> was<00:01:50.950> amazing

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 
they did it I just thought was amazing

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.200 
they did it I just thought was amazing
and<00:01:52.170> I<00:01:53.170> think<00:01:53.770> I<00:01:53.890> think<00:01:54.070> that<00:01:54.130> ball<00:01:54.370> on<00:01:54.430> blue<00:01:54.940> is

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.210 
and I think I think that ball on blue is

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.520 
and I think I think that ball on blue is
just<00:01:55.780> a<00:01:56.370> beautiful<00:01:57.370> piece<00:01:58.120> and<00:01:58.450> I<00:01:58.990> don't<00:01:59.470> even

and<00:02:18.030> you<00:02:19.030> know<00:02:19.439> the<00:02:20.439> criticism<00:02:21.129> of<00:02:21.250> it<00:02:21.459> is

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:21.609 
and you know the criticism of it is

00:02:21.609 --> 00:02:23.670 
and you know the criticism of it is
there<00:02:21.849> expensive<00:02:22.540> even<00:02:22.840> on<00:02:23.079> the<00:02:23.200> secondary

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
there expensive even on the secondary

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.420 
there expensive even on the secondary
market<00:02:23.769> they're<00:02:24.430> very<00:02:24.670> expensive<00:02:25.090> and<00:02:26.430> I

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
market they're very expensive and I

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.770 
market they're very expensive and I
think<00:02:28.299> you<00:02:28.480> might<00:02:28.719> if<00:02:28.930> you<00:02:29.109> bought<00:02:29.409> bought<00:02:30.010> one

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
think you might if you bought bought one

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.960 
think you might if you bought bought one
they<00:02:31.780> may<00:02:32.049> not<00:02:32.260> retain<00:02:32.739> value<00:02:33.280> in<00:02:33.549> the<00:02:33.790> long

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
they may not retain value in the long

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.140 
they may not retain value in the long
run<00:02:34.359> but<00:02:34.959> who<00:02:35.260> cares<00:02:35.620> as<00:02:36.129> long<00:02:36.609> as<00:02:36.760> you<00:02:36.939> enjoy

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
run but who cares as long as you enjoy

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.920 
run but who cares as long as you enjoy
