00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:10.990
 Hello, how are you, Miguel Angel? 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:12.580
 rosemary and in this video tutorial you 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:14.019
 I will talk about the features 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:17.410
 novelties that the system has 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:19.960
 operative windows 8 first of all you 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:21.490
 will show is a new dynamic menu for 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.830
 we are heading towards the 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:27.099
 lower right and we select the 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:29.470
 start option in here you can see 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:31.119
 with the new dynamic menu that is counted 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:32.830
 that is not the typical menu we had 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:35.640
 had in previous versions of 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:38.019
 microsoft windows we can see here 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.800
 calendar mail application and 

00:00:38.019 --> 00:00:43.600
 contacts photos among others a point 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.940
 important here in these applications is 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.460
 for example the mail application in 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:50.800
 this application you can have of 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.989
 synchronized way is to say in a single 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.719
 item all your email accounts 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:01:00.789
 electronic does not matter if they are accounts 

00:00:55.719 --> 00:01:02.379
 yahoo hotmail email among others for 

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:05.560
 contacts like you can synchronize 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:07.270
 accounts or social networks in which 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.160
 you can visualize in this same 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:12.130
 application the different contacts with 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:13.720
 What accounts do you have with the store? 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.520
 Applications 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:19.830
 you can not enter and download 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:22.110
 Some applications have a cost 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:25.410
 and to your decision what are the 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.420
 who want to select good here 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:29.340
 we take the opportunity to also say that 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.650
 you do not have the typical little cross 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.740
 to close the windows in windows 8 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:37.020
 for this we have to direct our 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.450
 mouse towards the top center 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.850
 here for example we give a click and 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.250
 we drag towards the bottom in 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.860
 the corner let go and we 're ready 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.990
 we return to the desk 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.340
 another of the options that you have good 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.350
 we go here to the bottom 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.210
 equal right we come to 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.690
 configuration 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.490
 change pc settings and we have 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:01.530
 several options among them we have 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.990
 can customize first 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.790
 change our lock screen 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.050
 our account image or password 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.620
 of image 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:12.660
 another thing is accounts I currently have 

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:15.420
 a local account which is called in tc 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.550
 if I wanted to synchronize an account 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.700
 microsoft on this computer would have to give 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:22.680
 in connecting a microsoft account 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.780
 then write your mail 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:28.660
 electronic that you have registered 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.560
 with microsoft and your password with the 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:33.440
 what accesses 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:36.140
 finally you would click on next and 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.849
 the data would be validated if your data 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:41.569
 are validated your account will 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:43.130
 synchronized and then we're going to 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:45.470
 come back here to our menu to 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:47.360
 then here we would not have the 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.860
 name that we had originally but 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.709
 that our account would be changed 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.450
 Microsoft would put the name as is 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:55.430
 we have it registered in the 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:58.510
 electronic mail that 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.510
 we have given high 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.900
 well here we can go back to 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:02.900
 desk 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:09.020
 other options that we have here equal in 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:12.050
 configuration is being able to see information 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:14.060
 from the pc we click and we can see 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:16.240
 processor features the 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:19.500
 RAM installed the system type 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:22.050

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.050
 other things 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:31.240
 we are going to close here to enter the 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:33.790
 control panel as we had it 

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:35.430
 in previous operating systems we 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:37.930
 we head towards the bottom 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:40.540
 we wait out the menu 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.670
 configuration and here we have the 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.709
 control panel 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:46.959
 in it we can uninstall a program 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:51.209

 I hope and make the most of each one 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:34.440
 of them in general I advise you that 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:37.770
 use account synchronization 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:40.139
 to not walk entering a page to 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:43.169
 another page all better in one application 

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:44.650
