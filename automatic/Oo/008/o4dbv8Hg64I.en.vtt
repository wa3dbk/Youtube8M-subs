Rancho<00:02:40.820> by<00:02:40.970> any<00:02:41.150> stretch<00:02:41.360> of<00:02:41.450> the<00:02:41.570> imagination

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
Rancho by any stretch of the imagination

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.920 
Rancho by any stretch of the imagination
but<00:02:42.290> certainly<00:02:43.100> one<00:02:43.370> were<00:02:43.750> encouraging<00:02:44.750> some

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
but certainly one were encouraging some

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:46.560 
but certainly one were encouraging some
of<00:02:45.020> the<00:02:45.080> other<00:02:45.200> elements<00:02:45.650> in<00:02:45.740> the<00:02:45.830> deck

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:46.570 
of the other elements in the deck

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:50.740 
of the other elements in the deck
therefore<00:02:47.570> sylvan<00:02:47.960> carey<00:02:47.990> did<00:02:49.450> probably<00:02:50.450> one

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
therefore sylvan carey did probably one

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.960 
therefore sylvan carey did probably one
of<00:02:50.780> the<00:02:50.900> better<00:02:51.080> two<00:02:51.440> drops<00:02:51.800> in<00:02:52.070> in<00:02:52.370> the<00:02:52.490> deck<00:02:52.700> I

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
of the better two drops in in the deck I

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.270 
of the better two drops in in the deck I
think<00:02:53.450> there<00:02:53.630> is<00:02:53.660> it<00:02:53.960> like<00:02:54.170> the<00:02:54.380> only<00:02:54.560> two<00:02:54.950> drop

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
think there is it like the only two drop

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.040 
think there is it like the only two drop
in<00:02:55.550> the<00:02:55.580> deck<00:02:55.820> apart<00:02:56.150> from<00:02:56.360> well<00:02:56.600> you'll<00:02:56.870> see

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.050 
in the deck apart from well you'll see

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:00.550 
in the deck apart from well you'll see
what<00:02:57.170> that<00:02:57.350> means<00:02:57.590> later<00:02:58.540> but<00:02:59.540> it's<00:02:59.780> very<00:03:00.170> good

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
what that means later but it's very good

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.920 
what that means later but it's very good

but the one for body is only relevant
the<00:03:32.600> world<00:03:32.900> of<00:03:33.050> the<00:03:33.170> whole<00:03:33.350> code<00:03:33.590> helps<00:03:33.890> you

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:34.160 
the world of the whole code helps you

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.990 
the world of the whole code helps you
put<00:03:34.489> more<00:03:34.790> counties<00:03:35.209> on<00:03:35.390> your<00:03:35.540> licka<00:03:35.750> tours

lexicon<00:03:38.000> goes<00:03:38.120> well<00:03:38.300> with<00:03:38.450> mana<00:03:38.690> blue<00:03:39.020> so<00:03:39.890> you

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
lexicon goes well with mana blue so you

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:42.520 
lexicon goes well with mana blue so you
can<00:03:40.190> add<00:03:40.400> more<00:03:41.060> counters<00:03:41.510> on<00:03:41.660> it<00:03:41.810> basically

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
can add more counters on it basically

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:44.410 
can add more counters on it basically
this<00:03:42.769> is<00:03:42.830> like<00:03:43.070> a<00:03:43.100> boil<00:03:43.489> as<00:03:43.880> well<00:03:44.120> as<00:03:44.209> Luca

you're going to be slowly ramping and

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:03.700 
you're going to be slowly ramping and
just<00:05:02.060> holding<00:05:02.419> the<00:05:02.479> game<00:05:02.660> down<00:05:02.900> you<00:05:03.350> can<00:05:03.560> get

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:03.710 
just holding the game down you can get

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:05.439 
just holding the game down you can get
there<00:05:03.889> pretty<00:05:04.070> reliably<00:05:04.760> and<00:05:04.970> if<00:05:05.150> you<00:05:05.270> have

00:05:05.439 --> 00:05:05.449 
there pretty reliably and if you have

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:07.510 
there pretty reliably and if you have
both<00:05:05.660> of<00:05:05.690> them<00:05:05.900> out<00:05:06.080> Stronach<00:05:07.070> present<00:05:07.370> here

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:07.520 
both of them out Stronach present here

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:09.610 
both of them out Stronach present here
also<00:05:07.729> copies<00:05:08.389> the<00:05:08.539> triggered<00:05:08.930> ability<00:05:09.380> from

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:09.620 
also copies the triggered ability from

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:12.159 
also copies the triggered ability from
Jace<00:05:10.160> so<00:05:10.699> the<00:05:10.820> +1<00:05:11.060> Jace<00:05:11.539> maintain<00:05:11.990> get

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:12.169 
Jace so the +1 Jace maintain get

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:51.710 
the trigger you have to be loyal to

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:54.490 
the trigger you have to be loyal to
whole<00:05:51.979> clay<00:05:52.220> so<00:05:52.580> it<00:05:53.150> would<00:05:53.330> for<00:05:53.930> each<00:05:54.020> counter

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:54.500 
whole clay so it would for each counter

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:55.990 
whole clay so it would for each counter
put<00:05:54.830> another<00:05:55.130> one<00:05:55.310> of<00:05:55.430> those<00:05:55.490> titles<00:05:55.789> black

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:56.000

the<00:06:04.669> way<00:06:04.760> this<00:06:04.820> works<00:06:04.940> is<00:06:05.360> your<00:06:06.229> sonic

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:06.710 
the way this works is your sonic

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:08.050 
the way this works is your sonic
resonator<00:06:07.010> will<00:06:07.250> come<00:06:07.370> off<00:06:07.460> the<00:06:07.580> stack<00:06:07.760> first

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:08.060 
resonator will come off the stack first

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:10.210 
resonator will come off the stack first
and<00:06:08.330> your<00:06:08.990> search<00:06:09.260> leftovers<00:06:09.770> will<00:06:09.949> get<00:06:10.070> any

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:10.220 
and your search leftovers will get any

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:11.890 
and your search leftovers will get any
other<00:06:10.430> counter<00:06:10.820> that<00:06:11.120> will<00:06:11.270> put<00:06:11.449> it<00:06:11.539> at<00:06:11.630> two

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:11.900 
other counter that will put it at two

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:13.960 
other counter that will put it at two
counters<00:06:12.380> then<00:06:12.889> it<00:06:13.190> will<00:06:13.280> check<00:06:13.520> this<00:06:13.669> as<00:06:13.820> oh

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:13.970 
counters then it will check this as oh

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:15.370 
counters then it will check this as oh
you<00:06:14.180> don't<00:06:14.330> have<00:06:14.419> five<00:06:14.659> towers<00:06:14.900> you<00:06:15.080> don't<00:06:15.260> win

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:15.380 
you don't have five towers you don't win

the<00:06:15.470> game<00:06:16.060> million<00:06:17.060> of<00:06:17.180> oil<00:06:17.419> he'll<00:06:18.080> double<00:06:18.470> it

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:18.590 
the game million of oil he'll double it

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:20.770 
the game million of oil he'll double it
so<00:06:19.190> you<00:06:19.250> go<00:06:19.430> from<00:06:19.550> two<00:06:19.789> colors<00:06:20.120> to<00:06:20.240> 4<00:06:20.449> counters

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:20.780 
so you go from two colors to 4 counters

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:22.960 
so you go from two colors to 4 counters
and<00:06:21.080> then<00:06:21.860> your<00:06:22.039> family<00:06:22.460> trigger<00:06:22.729> will

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:22.970 
and then your family trigger will

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:25.180 
and then your family trigger will
resolve<00:06:23.419> you'll<00:06:23.930> get<00:06:24.139> the<00:06:24.229> fifth<00:06:24.530> counter<00:06:25.010> and

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:25.190 
resolve you'll get the fifth counter and

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:28.149 
resolve you'll get the fifth counter and
you'll<00:06:25.370> win<00:06:25.610> the<00:06:25.760> game<00:06:25.940> um<00:06:26.770> of<00:06:27.770> course<00:06:27.830> is
