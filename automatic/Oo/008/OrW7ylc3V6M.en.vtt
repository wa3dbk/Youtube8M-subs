 taking advantage of the family and for the year 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.200

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.540
 living still has a contract of one more 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.060
 year waiting to see how to solve 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.160
 amon we have been following since that 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.580
 appearance of the great ramon in the athletic 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.800
 that her meteoric rise from here to here 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.019
 what happened 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.769
 Ramón had great opportunities to 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:34.680
 suddenly did not get back by turning and the tape 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.969
 that you remember that time of cock of 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.610
 corinthians of those great 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.829
 opportunities and the ramon that is today 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.000
 a lot of things happened very new or 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.320
 things when you talk happened a lot 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.450
 fast managed to press the athletic 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.340
 16 years because it was soon sold to 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.020
 Russia but today we feel more 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.180
 mature at age 26 now enjoy and 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.469
 guest teacher appeared again was 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.360
 important, happy, I'm happy, and my 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.039
 My family's most important son is 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.969
 take care of them but not so much looking for a 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.120
 club to play 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:02.850
 what do you think you did that could 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.530
 have done differently rare here King 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.630
 should have done this way have some 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.180
 thing that you come back and want to do 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.560
 different said it's still new 26 years 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.820
 I think an early age when 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.590
 begins to have a living condition for 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.299
 do things if they start to have a 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.100
 a lot of friends who are not really 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.750
 true friends, I could only change 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.280
 as the young man making the exchange more 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.530
 friendships I had that really did not 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.210
 It was friendship for me at that moment by 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.860
 group that only argued that the ramon was 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.080
 on meteoric rise 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.000
 This was started very early in the 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.159
 same product to make new friends the 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.380
 what happened but I hope god willing 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.960
 I'm going to make a 2011 better to come back one 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.979
 little better and has confidence even though 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.840
 he rafael 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.630
 suddenly can come back can burst 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.399
 again it's new even 26 years ago 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.689
 of little age things always very much 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.939
 fast in the three biggest clubs in Brazil 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:50.100
 the classic with the Flemish I think it has 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:53.210
 talent do not forget not now take care of me 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.210
 and look around 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:02:00.200
 because it is but friendship is sawn 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:02.830
 in short the career move you have in the book 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.910
 of the polycarp dog self-motivation 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:07.220
 understand that the error allows you to 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:09.350
 redirects your path is important 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:12.170
 But it has to be fast, right? 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:16.160
 I've played with ramon has proposed 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:18.140
 belgium is olé 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.290
 I appreciate the opportunity, too. 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:23.660
 talking about arguing but there is one 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:26.390
 missions we as coach is motivated 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.790
 enough athlete focus is 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.770
 of goals and objectives will be that the ramon 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.959
 is focused on football will be that ramon 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:35.630
 have this identification by the magazine 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:38.300
 is yes but then the more you have to 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:39.500
 you think this is part of the 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:42.770
 coach 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:44.450
 motivation this orientation of the 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:46.850
 psychologist who do you think is more 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:49.550
 important in this process is everyone is 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:51.470
 everybody and mainly he the toledo 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:54.530
 he needs to understand that change 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:56.390
 perhaps for him it would be the 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.820
 his best action at the moment because he 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:00.590
 26 years old has a lot of potential is 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:02.989
 that I say the athlete has to have a 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:05.450
 balance between the mind the right body 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:08.120
 so he can get inside 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:11.150
 field and perform its function which is 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.860
 playing football I was watching is yesterday a 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.390
 documentary about the champion palm trees 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:18.440
 of 93 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:20.720
 the bay of the team right dosinho and edmundo 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.100
 so we listened to pressure on that team 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.440
 until the final game 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:26.239
 then what the player needs most and 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.769
 This balance you're talking to 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:29.390
 endure these great moments of 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:31.549
 tension they spend almost 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:34.010
 daily in bank and mainly 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:36.410
 he has seen with these good habits since 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:38.209
 the basis on talent work this on the basis 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:40.940
 so it already has a structure 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:44.269
 to reach the professional and power up 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:46.610
 is to work with new ones better the basis today 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:49.160
 né athletic cruise america is 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:50.900
 focusing on this is interested in this 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.030
 structure for that athletic cruise 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:56.360
 five do a good job at the 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:58.190
 base is a psychologist and I very much believe 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:00.590
 work that cult a job 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:02.420
 complement the work of the psychologist, 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:04.819
 It is a support coach 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:07.069
 to really let these athletes 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:08.359
 solved extra-field problems and 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:10.400
 able to act more calmly 

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:12.499
 more ramon running so why is it 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:16.940
 did the interview by just us but he did not 

00:04:12.499 --> 00:04:18.650
 is the only example is not one of the events 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:21.019
 now I wanted to register here 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:23.150
 one of the big signings 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:25.940
 America and this year was in the 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:28.610
 the evandro that is with the supervisor is a 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:31.280
 big face that is changing america is 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:35.810
 treating 10-year-olds from 11 2 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:37.970
 of due caution and the black boy 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:39.560
 Are you assuming America there? 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:42.199
 Evandro has to stay 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:45.169
 he sees the alexandre would do but he does not 

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:47.360
 Gotta leave because he left I believe 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:49.490
 much in the work you are doing and 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.780
 For God's sake , it does not change the focus of 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:52.580
 basis now that we are in a 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:55.759
 very cool way you, for example 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:57.800
 how cold the enderson moreira said that the 

00:04:55.759 --> 00:05:00.770
 most viewed player after neymar 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:03.770
 on base was branch you would get a career 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:06.080
 of the map manage for sure I think it is 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:07.729
 a good opportunity is a good boy is the 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:10.340
 boy there new age was the city until 

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:12.139

 want to understand a little bit of this 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:18.530
 methodology to be able to help is not 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:19.070
 It would be a huge pleasure to help 

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:21.080
 ramon 

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:23.360

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:27.650

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:40.849

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:44.030
 missing players there who're
