00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:07.170
 the staff then we will continue 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.599
 to the video I recorded yesterday about the 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.300
 confection of the powerful pieces for lakes 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.820
 marine and freshwater aquariums as 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.520
 I spoke to spend 24 hours the stones and 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:20.580
 practically already dried is not ideal the 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.020
 ideal is already 48 hours to dry well in a 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.480
 Dry weather, right? 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.160
 remembering that salt retains much water 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.689
 so the stone is completely full 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.349
 of coarse salt and it will retain enough 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.179
 Water 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.830
 but the result is the one I said 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.570
 now the next step 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.430
 so it means that you made the 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.190
 Her sand bed underneath it she will not 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.030
 catch understand then it gets much better 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.570
 easy 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:46.020
 there legal work 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:49.860
 she is ready is completely 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:54.329
 ready now that they will dive 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:57.059
 this stone in the water will leave steep 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.739
 in the water to get out the coarse salt or 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.170
 which Italy can put directly 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.120
 in which the then this is a this is another 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.070
 I did great so it's not over yet. 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.820
 falling and underneath she is already at 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.710
 door 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:16.740
 She's already out of the stone. 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:19.290
 the other was completely dry 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.090
 I told you how it 's going down, it's logical. 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.909
 this roll that I put rogÃ©rio 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.950
 will have paper towel just remove it 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.020
 He takes a small knife and the knife had or 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.200
 will not hold the water lies dipped 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.340
 a bucket mute the sound it 0 then 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.460
 stones 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:38.189
 if you come to her here on the other side in 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.500
 The topic that we did not have two 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:44.909
 You touch a hole here on this side and another. 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:46.860
 Touch a stone there, you're ready to 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.020
 who will put in freshwater aquarium 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.850
 remembering it is dipped in a tank 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.149
 inside a bucket for a month a month and 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:58.200
 bit of that right introduction here by 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:02:00.950
 under it as I said it was another 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:04.079
 part before what one can play looks 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:06.600
 left right paper how are you going to stay 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:09.660
 put the animals if you put them in a 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.150
 court that looks cool will get toquinho 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:15.630
 ready 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:18.540
 right the other you turning her here 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.910
 It has one more a role that you can 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:25.980
 strip him 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:27.750
 Care you make sure you just hold it. 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:32.250
 water he leaves the stone 1 billion is more 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:33.209
 easy you withdraw more toquinha the 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.830
 fish 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:37.230
 This is the other so let's go here. 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:43.320
 I worked the horse so I would not change if 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:48.630
 you do this system right here in the 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:50.040
 floor and on the lower floor so 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.830
 boring down 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:55.940
 It takes up even the same sand 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.940
 more 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:01.709
 note the coarse salt it here the crystal of 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:05.580
 coarse salt 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:07.170
 everything lent to her frustrated in her then 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:11.220
 It's coarse salt that's here will melt. 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:13.110
 everything is poison will dissolve and where 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:17.370
 Is the coarse salt going to leave? 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:19.890
 pores through which will get to the AIPA 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:21.900
 biology needed stone 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.880
 so you can do this with 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:28.190
 scrambled instead of putting a cardboard 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:28.190
 to do with the bladder 

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:44.190
 His father's right ufpe 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.840
 the hole that was left for the exchange of 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:48.030
 fish you want to make a 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.920
 effect the ornament 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:57.810
 sometimes the person can get it here 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:04:00.030
 on this turn here the case places the plant 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:06.930
 The little plant in here is going to be born. 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:13.290
 there the assembly that is already accustomed in 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:14.990
 on top of the other, a little 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:16.760
 play like this 

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:19.520
 we got the new package the paper 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:21.800
 and it looks cool 

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:24.980
 the perfect stone had not proclaimed 

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:28.220
 the son and tried to break that 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:29.660
 another thing they are not a hard and 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:32.270
 knocked down on the ground she's gonna break 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:33.770
 but there in the aquarium these things do not 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:34.520
 have problems you can mount one on top of the 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:37.730
 other 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:44.000
 in case who is from here can take the 

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:45.320
 mount this one up and it will make the 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.990
 decoration you want 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:55.280
 the aquarium is both water and water 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:56.690
 Sweet is very common I do what I 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:57.560
 I do not have aquarium 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:00.860
 marine 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:03.860
 But I already went by the block store everything is 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:06.230
 do in dressers I use a lot of staff 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:07.310
 I will order with you that will reach 4 

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:09.080
 marine 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:11.330
 so is it folks saw as was 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.950
 I know you wanted me to show you the 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:13.970
 step-by-step video of how to do 

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:16.880
 stones 

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:20.110
 I did so I hope you put the 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:23.840
 hand it in the dough and show it to him 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:26.090
 You can ride whatever you want. 

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:28.040
 so put your hand on the mass and staff 

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:30.230
 Make the stones that are worth it 

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:31.910
 very beautiful and suddenly you can 

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:33.590
 until I make a buck there doing the 

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:38.900
 stones and are sent to the 

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:40.610
 aquariums the lake and other others 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:43.460
 things that you think are useful and 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:47.390
 leave as I said this can decorate lakes 

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:50.120
 can make planting is putting plants 

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:52.220
 flowers eat well getting beautiful is a 

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:54.980
 work well well is not difficult to do 

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:58.940
 material is not expensive 

00:05:54.980 --> 00:06:00.620
 if you can not find the sand thigh 

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:02.260
 can do with sand and 

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:06.650
 thick construction material and I said 

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:10.160
 That's when the work gets really cool and 

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:11.480
 now how it is with the sun does not 

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:13.340
 will appear the pores 

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:15.350
 then it will melt will stay the whole 

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:16.970
 by works that already have pores here some 

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:19.820
 here where you play some 

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:21.710
 pebbles and saves when it suddenly left 

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:23.510
 here is going to be ball show 

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:25.270
 I'll show you a little more watercolor 

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:28.410
 So you can see how the 

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:28.410
 the jobs 

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:34.000
 It was then worth it that the salt 

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:39.280
 The final job will be exactly that. 

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:41.650
 From here, the stones are already in the 

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:43.810
 my aquarium not the ones I did in 

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:46.630
 home from now just the three more 

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:49.750
 are the old ones I made for her to 

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:54.000
 porosity there the gills where the 

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:59.020
 sun or where it had salt it comes out all are 

00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:03.610

 for that the spectacle that is watching 

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:34.450
 this is the result outside the hour that 

00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:36.490
