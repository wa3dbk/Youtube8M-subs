00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.640 

especially<00:02:23.760> since<00:02:24.060> this<00:02:24.270> is<00:02:24.510> reclaimed<00:02:25.380> land

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650

especially since this is reclaimed land
without<00:02:25.890> I'm<00:02:26.190> on<00:02:26.370> right<00:02:26.550> now<00:02:26.580> this<00:02:26.850> used<00:02:27.030> to<00:02:27.120> be

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
without I'm on right now this used to be

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.770 
without I'm on right now this used to be
part<00:02:27.450> of<00:02:27.510> Tokyo<00:02:27.900> Bay<00:02:28.790> and<00:02:29.790> they<00:02:30.330> created<00:02:30.720> this

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
part of Tokyo Bay and they created this

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.440 
part of Tokyo Bay and they created this
land<00:02:31.050> by<00:02:31.230> throwing<00:02:32.010> landfill<00:02:32.850> and<00:02:33.060> mountains

rocks<00:02:34.440> out<00:02:34.800> here<00:02:35.810> and<00:02:36.810> so<00:02:37.110> we<00:02:37.950> this<00:02:38.580> land<00:02:38.880> could

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:39.240 
rocks out here and so we this land could

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:46.610 
rocks out here and so we this land could
just<00:02:39.740> go<00:02:40.740> potentially<00:02:41.340> I<00:02:41.490> don't<00:02:41.730> know<00:02:45.500> quite<00:02:46.500> a
