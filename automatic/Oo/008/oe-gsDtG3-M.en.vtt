00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:02.900
 group starts 

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:05.900
 about no less positive 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:09.919
 in beautiful 

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:12.299
 altu there too 

00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:14.619
 letters are beautiful 

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:17.619
 cool even what hope because 

00:00:18.259 --> 00:00:21.259
 you will be cool in your hands 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:24.699
 but then begins the typical step by step 

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:26.919
 strategy 

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:29.759
 with a very mediocre drive 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:32.219
 landmarks of people who deliberately do not know 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:33.600
 when 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.740
 I have in my memory there 

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:37.540
 graphics 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:39.129
 decent fun was 

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:41.360
 why go there 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.260
 it is not clear at all 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.270
 still overlooked 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.580
 builders pasha was glad it was clear 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.280
 why did not appear 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.520
 computers were words and everything is real 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.720
 time it was impossible to cheat 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.720
 so we did pasha oglu 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.350
 fst Russia money 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.850
 but why did they live up to our time 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:02.290
 I do people 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:04.570
 who play it I really don't understand 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:06.850
 a match that likes to scream that author 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.800
 tommy found 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.540
 the bell 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.090
 but typical strategies 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.700
 your new 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.190
 if earlier there are some moves and 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:22.050
 to put 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:24.790
 damage 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:27.810
 generally honestly full 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.970
 will still watch 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.650
 generally not interested in the garden 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.650
 and a pass game 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.020
 weak very fame 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.600
 with the European Union, the unknowns 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.600
 horseradish texture 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.869
 although in all the games held 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:49.270
 decently 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:50.970
 even if very close approaching 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.270
 then he doesn't care 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.630
 texture and detail is very 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.630
 cool here even 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.600
 confectionery that one of the most secret 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.600
 and can bring a bet 

00:02:11.789 --> 00:02:12.560
 in a statement 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:13.810
 by the way that in the most modern 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.699
 technology 

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:19.699
 so it is in these six months from moving 

00:02:20.719 --> 00:02:22.849
 I have played for the first time 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:25.409
 look it was my first car with 

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:26.899
 parents 

00:02:26.899 --> 00:02:28.869
 but wondered when 

00:02:28.869 --> 00:02:31.869
 that is where to go what steps 

00:02:34.919 --> 00:02:37.919
 here I want to live with me 

00:02:43.249 --> 00:02:45.579
 what we get is not available 

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:47.889
 run out 

00:02:47.889 --> 00:02:51.230
 the menu of the game which it icons there are you 

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:53.879
 there is also a percentage of such 

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:55.919
 style but at the same time 

00:02:55.919 --> 00:02:57.589
 besides such 

00:02:57.589 --> 00:03:00.069
 perhaps for weak styling want 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:03.379
 first of all wanted 

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:06.379
 but what kind of parties actually 

00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:11.639
 in general, I have 

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:14.429
 never played emirates play 

00:03:14.429 --> 00:03:17.429
 it is a pity that analogues 

00:03:21.039 --> 00:03:22.119
 I have some
