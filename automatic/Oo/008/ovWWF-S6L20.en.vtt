that you do a little bit like a tiny
amount<00:02:58.610> of<00:02:58.850> time<00:02:58.970> after<00:02:59.120> you<00:02:59.299> do<00:02:59.420> it<00:02:59.450> but<00:02:59.840> once

amount of time after you do it but once

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:01.780 
amount of time after you do it but once
she's<00:03:00.170> separated<00:03:00.680> she<00:03:00.920> gets<00:03:01.190> like<00:03:01.310> computer

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
she's separated she gets like computer

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:03.190 
she's separated she gets like computer
like<00:03:02.150> she<00:03:02.480> gets<00:03:02.630> controlled<00:03:02.930> by<00:03:02.989> the<00:03:03.049> computer

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
like she gets controlled by the computer

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.080 
like she gets controlled by the computer
and<00:03:03.620> she<00:03:04.010> does<00:03:04.160> some<00:03:04.310> pretty<00:03:04.489> dumb<00:03:04.790> things

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
and she does some pretty dumb things

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.330 
and she does some pretty dumb things
most<00:03:05.360> of<00:03:05.480> the<00:03:05.540> time<00:03:05.750> so<00:03:06.320> a<00:03:06.350> lot<00:03:06.769> of<00:03:06.799> a<00:03:07.100> lot<00:03:07.250> of

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
most of the time so a lot of a lot of

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.220 
most of the time so a lot of a lot of
characters<00:03:08.150> and<00:03:08.390> players<00:03:08.600> strategy<00:03:09.080> is<00:03:09.200> to

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
characters and players strategy is to

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.170 
characters and players strategy is to
separate<00:03:09.739> the<00:03:09.890> two<00:03:10.070> and<00:03:10.280> then<00:03:10.370> kill<00:03:10.670> Nana<00:03:10.910> wall

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
separate the two and then kill Nana wall

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:12.850 
separate the two and then kill Nana wall
she's<00:03:11.390> not<00:03:11.989> being<00:03:12.170> controlled<00:03:12.560> by<00:03:12.590> the<00:03:12.680> player

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 
she's not being controlled by the player

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:14.949 
she's not being controlled by the player
