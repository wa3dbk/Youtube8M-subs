shouldn't have worried well first start
this<00:00:37.050> thing<00:00:37.290> is<00:00:37.410> gonna<00:00:37.590> be<00:00:37.829> flying<00:00:38.280> along

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
this thing is gonna be flying along

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.990 
this thing is gonna be flying along
quite<00:00:39.329> a<00:00:39.360> steady<00:00:39.960> pace<00:00:40.350> or<00:00:40.620> run<00:00:40.739> about<00:00:41.000> 17,000

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
quite a steady pace or run about 17,000

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.360 
quite a steady pace or run about 17,000
miles<00:00:42.210> an<00:00:42.329> hour<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:43.079> fortunately<00:00:43.530> is<00:00:43.800> gonna

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
miles an hour the fortunately is gonna

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.850 
miles an hour the fortunately is gonna
make<00:00:44.579> a<00:00:44.610> closer<00:00:45.059> approach<00:00:45.510> them<00:00:45.809> to<00:00:45.960> 17,000

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
make a closer approach them to 17,000

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.350 
make a closer approach them to 17,000
miles<00:00:47.039> I<00:00:47.250> thought<00:00:47.460> that<00:00:47.640> seems<00:00:47.910> pretty<00:00:48.090> far

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
miles I thought that seems pretty far

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.000 
miles I thought that seems pretty far
away<00:00:48.539> well<00:00:48.960> if<00:00:49.079> you<00:00:49.170> imagine<00:00:49.379> like<00:00:49.680> a<00:00:49.710> golf

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
away well if you imagine like a golf

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.970 
away well if you imagine like a golf
course<00:00:50.219> and<00:00:50.579> you<00:00:51.180> shot<00:00:51.570> your<00:00:51.930> ball<00:00:52.649> across

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
course and you shot your ball across

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.799 
course and you shot your ball across
there<00:00:53.370> to<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.670> green<00:00:53.910> and<00:00:54.180> it<00:00:54.270> landed<00:00:54.570> next<00:00:54.660> to

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
there to the green and it landed next to

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.479 
there to the green and it landed next to
the<00:00:54.899> hole<00:00:55.079> it<00:00:55.500> would<00:00:55.620> literally<00:00:55.920> be<00:00:56.129> skipping

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
the hole it would literally be skipping

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.520 
the hole it would literally be skipping
off<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:57.059> edge<00:00:57.180> of<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.449> hole<00:00:57.629> so<00:00:58.020> it's<00:00:58.170> closed

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
off the edge of the hole so it's closed

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.099 
off the edge of the hole so it's closed
on<00:00:58.829> cosmological<00:00:59.640> oh<00:00:59.699> but<00:01:00.570> for<00:01:00.719> us<00:01:00.840> personally

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
on cosmological oh but for us personally

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.380 
on cosmological oh but for us personally
we're<00:01:01.620> fine<00:01:01.800> it's<00:01:02.100> not<00:01:02.250> gonna<00:01:02.370> hit<00:01:02.520> it<00:01:02.699> but<00:01:03.270> it

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
we're fine it's not gonna hit it but it

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.060 
we're fine it's not gonna hit it but it
is<00:01:03.480> really<00:01:03.870> really<00:01:04.229> close<00:01:04.439> to<00:01:04.470> this<00:01:04.680> a<00:01:04.739> bit<00:01:04.979> of

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
is really really close to this a bit of

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.920 
is really really close to this a bit of
a<00:01:05.129> rough<00:01:05.339> remind<00:01:05.729> you<00:01:05.909> about<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.299> cosmos<00:01:06.659> that

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
a rough remind you about the cosmos that

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.590 
a rough remind you about the cosmos that
we're<00:01:07.049> not<00:01:07.140> alone<00:01:07.380> yeah<00:01:07.740> so<00:01:08.189> how<00:01:09.119> can<00:01:09.180> it<00:01:09.479> get

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
we're not alone yeah so how can it get

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.149 
we're not alone yeah so how can it get
so<00:01:09.810> close<00:01:10.049> doesn't<00:01:10.350> our<00:01:10.500> gravity<00:01:10.920> want<00:01:11.100> to

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
so close doesn't our gravity want to

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.800 
so close doesn't our gravity want to
like<00:01:11.280> grab<00:01:11.820> it<00:01:12.060> and<00:01:12.180> pull<00:01:12.390> it<00:01:12.510> in

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
like grab it and pull it in

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.390 
like grab it and pull it in
yeah<00:01:13.110> that's<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.470> kind<00:01:13.680> of<00:01:13.740> cool<00:01:13.890> thing<00:01:13.950> cuz

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
yeah that's the kind of cool thing cuz

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.490 
yeah that's the kind of cool thing cuz
this<00:01:14.580> this<00:01:15.060> object<00:01:15.270> whistle<00:01:15.900> but<00:01:16.140> it's<00:01:16.259> a<00:01:16.320> bad

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
this this object whistle but it's a bad

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.280 
this this object whistle but it's a bad
lot<00:01:16.830> a<00:01:17.189> hundred<00:01:17.610> and<00:01:17.790> thirty<00:01:18.119> thousand<00:01:19.020> tons

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
lot a hundred and thirty thousand tons

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.950 
lot a hundred and thirty thousand tons
larger<00:01:20.250> than<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.430> largest<00:01:20.729> cruise<00:01:21.090> liner<00:01:21.390> so

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
larger than the largest cruise liner so

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.160 
larger than the largest cruise liner so
it's<00:01:22.170> a<00:01:22.229> heavy<00:01:22.409> lump<00:01:23.130> of<00:01:23.340> rock<00:01:24.119> we<00:01:24.540> assumed<00:01:24.900> it

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
it's a heavy lump of rock we assumed it

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.630 
it's a heavy lump of rock we assumed it
could<00:01:25.200> be<00:01:25.500> metal<00:01:25.860> it<00:01:26.100> could<00:01:26.250> be<00:01:26.400> loosely

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
could be metal it could be loosely

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.850 
could be metal it could be loosely
packed<00:01:26.970> but<00:01:27.780> it's<00:01:28.229> actually<00:01:28.560> going<00:01:28.650> to<00:01:28.710> come

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
packed but it's actually going to come

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.380 
packed but it's actually going to come
so<00:01:29.040> close<00:01:29.310> to<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:29.759> Earth's<00:01:30.030> gravitational

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
so close to the Earth's gravitational

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.140 
so close to the Earth's gravitational
well<00:01:30.780> it's<00:01:31.049> gonna<00:01:31.259> be<00:01:31.670> slingshotted<00:01:32.670> away

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
well it's gonna be slingshotted away

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.929 
well it's gonna be slingshotted away
okay<00:01:33.570> and<00:01:33.780> we're<00:01:34.079> altering<00:01:34.439> its<00:01:34.710> orbit<00:01:35.250> so<00:01:35.670> is

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
okay and we're altering its orbit so is

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.630 
okay and we're altering its orbit so is
it<00:01:36.119> they're<00:01:36.659> gonna<00:01:36.780> come<00:01:37.020> back<00:01:37.200> okay<00:01:37.979> it's<00:01:38.520> not

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
it they're gonna come back okay it's not

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.030 
it they're gonna come back okay it's not
gonna<00:01:38.729> come<00:01:39.000> back<00:01:39.030> soon<00:01:39.840> but<00:01:40.409> they<00:01:40.560> will<00:01:40.799> come

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
gonna come back soon but they will come

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.770 
gonna come back soon but they will come
back<00:01:41.189> around<00:01:41.430> about<00:01:41.759> three<00:01:42.119> decades<00:01:42.570> they

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
back around about three decades they

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.350 
back around about three decades they
recognize<00:01:43.549> is<00:01:44.549> this<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:44.880> is<00:01:45.060> this<00:01:45.180> the

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
recognize is this the is this the

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.179 
recognize is this the is this the
nearest<00:01:45.659> myth<00:01:45.899> that<00:01:46.200> we<00:01:46.320> have<00:01:46.500> on<00:01:46.799> record

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
nearest myth that we have on record

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.450 
nearest myth that we have on record
certainly<00:01:48.000> in<00:01:48.119> recent<00:01:48.149> years<00:01:48.630> yeah<00:01:48.990> cuz<00:01:49.460> of

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
certainly in recent years yeah cuz of

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.120 
certainly in recent years yeah cuz of
course<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:50.880> asteroid<00:01:51.720> hunters<00:01:51.869> and<00:01:52.500> asteroid

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
course the asteroid hunters and asteroid

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.649 
course the asteroid hunters and asteroid
hunting<00:01:53.520> programs<00:01:53.970> are<00:01:54.180> kind<00:01:54.360> of<00:01:54.420> in<00:01:54.509> their

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
hunting programs are kind of in their

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.719 
hunting programs are kind of in their
infancy<00:01:54.930> so<00:01:55.710> certainly<00:01:56.070> in<00:01:56.159> the<00:01:56.219> last<00:01:56.460> few

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
infancy so certainly in the last few

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.850 
infancy so certainly in the last few
decades<00:01:56.909> this<00:01:57.420> is<00:01:57.600> the<00:01:57.719> closest<00:01:58.350> near<00:01:58.619> miss<00:01:58.829> of

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
decades this is the closest near miss of

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.830 
decades this is the closest near miss of
something<00:01:59.399> this<00:01:59.549> size<00:01:59.759> and<00:02:00.240> the<00:02:00.479> earth<00:02:00.570> gets

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
something this size and the earth gets

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.859 
something this size and the earth gets
hit<00:02:00.930> daily<00:02:01.649> by<00:02:02.040> small<00:02:02.490> piece<00:02:03.119> pieces<00:02:03.750> of

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
hit daily by small piece pieces of

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:04.459 
hit daily by small piece pieces of
asteroid

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
asteroid

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.410 
asteroid
I<00:02:04.500> hear<00:02:04.740> it's<00:02:04.860> gonna<00:02:04.979> pass<00:02:05.250> inside<00:02:05.969> of<00:02:06.299> our

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
I hear it's gonna pass inside of our

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.059 
I hear it's gonna pass inside of our
communication<00:02:07.110> satellites<00:02:07.649> is<00:02:07.890> there<00:02:08.039> a

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
communication satellites is there a

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.130 
communication satellites is there a
chance<00:02:08.280> it<00:02:08.369> could<00:02:08.429> hit<00:02:08.670> one<00:02:08.729> is<00:02:09.179> it<00:02:09.479> possible

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
chance it could hit one is it possible

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.699 
chance it could hit one is it possible
yeah

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:11.709 
yeah

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:13.319 
yeah
there's<00:02:12.189> no<00:02:12.310> there's<00:02:12.519> no<00:02:12.640> chance<00:02:12.939> it's<00:02:13.239> gonna

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:13.329 
there's no there's no chance it's gonna

00:02:13.329 --> 00:02:15.420 
there's no there's no chance it's gonna
hit<00:02:13.569> Earth<00:02:13.719> but<00:02:14.290> it<00:02:14.409> could<00:02:14.590> knock<00:02:14.859> out<00:02:15.040> your<00:02:15.189> TV

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
hit Earth but it could knock out your TV

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.839 
hit Earth but it could knock out your TV
but<00:02:15.849> the<00:02:16.359> likelihood<00:02:16.870> of<00:02:16.989> this<00:02:17.109> happening<00:02:17.170> is

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:17.849 
but the likelihood of this happening is

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:22.110 
but the likelihood of this happening is
extremely<00:02:18.849> slim<00:02:19.209> okay<00:02:19.870> so<00:02:20.760> since<00:02:21.760> it's<00:02:22.000> not

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
extremely slim okay so since it's not

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.610 
extremely slim okay so since it's not
gonna<00:02:22.239> hit<00:02:22.420> us<00:02:22.599> and<00:02:22.810> it's<00:02:23.049> not<00:02:23.170> gonna<00:02:23.290> take<00:02:23.500> out

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
gonna hit us and it's not gonna take out

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:24.809 
gonna hit us and it's not gonna take out
our<00:02:23.739> television<00:02:24.219> what<00:02:24.370> are<00:02:24.430> we<00:02:24.519> doing<00:02:24.700> well

this is the cool thing I mean once you
get<00:02:26.290> over<00:02:26.409> the<00:02:26.530> terrifying<00:02:27.189> aspect<00:02:27.790> that

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
get over the terrifying aspect that

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.940 
get over the terrifying aspect that
there<00:02:28.180> are<00:02:28.359> big<00:02:28.659> huge<00:02:29.019> space<00:02:29.409> rocks<00:02:29.680> out<00:02:29.920> there

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
there are big huge space rocks out there

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:39.489 
environment and it's gonna come so close

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:41.309 
environment and it's gonna come so close
that<00:02:40.000> we're<00:02:40.180> gonna<00:02:40.329> be<00:02:40.480> able<00:02:40.629> to<00:02:40.719> see<00:02:40.959> it<00:02:41.079> with

that we're gonna be able to see it with

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:44.879 
that we're gonna be able to see it with
moderate<00:02:42.280> sized<00:02:42.549> telescope<00:02:43.329> or<00:02:43.569> a<00:02:43.799> just<00:02:44.799> a

basic pair of binoculars over Indonesia

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.259 
basic pair of binoculars over Indonesia
is<00:02:47.650> actually<00:02:48.159> that<00:02:48.310> from<00:02:48.489> the<00:02:48.609> closest<00:02:49.060> point

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:49.269 
is actually that from the closest point

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:50.550 
is actually that from the closest point
where<00:02:49.540> it's<00:02:49.629> going<00:02:49.750> to<00:02:49.810> pass<00:02:49.989> over<00:02:50.169> so<00:02:50.470> the

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
where it's going to pass over so the

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:51.629 
where it's going to pass over so the
best<00:02:50.739> point<00:02:50.980> if<00:02:51.069> you<00:02:51.129> want<00:02:51.280> to<00:02:51.340> see<00:02:51.459> this<00:02:51.549> thing

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:51.639 
best point if you want to see this thing

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:52.679 
best point if you want to see this thing
its<00:02:52.120> Indonesia

the scientists professional astronomers
they're<00:02:55.659> actually<00:02:56.049> getting<00:02:56.859> their<00:02:57.040> radio

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
they're actually getting their radio

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.610 
they're actually getting their radio
antenna<00:02:58.180> they're<00:02:58.540> gonna<00:02:58.659> they're<00:02:59.109> gonna<00:02:59.230> fire

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
antenna they're gonna they're gonna fire

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.280 
antenna they're gonna they're gonna fire
some<00:03:00.030> radio<00:03:01.030> waves<00:03:01.239> I<00:03:01.389> think<00:03:01.599> pinning<00:03:01.900> it<00:03:02.049> back

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
some radio waves I think pinning it back

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:03.990 
some radio waves I think pinning it back
and<00:03:02.590> they're<00:03:02.739> gonna<00:03:02.829> be<00:03:03.010> patchy<00:03:03.159> see<00:03:03.579> the

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
and they're gonna be patchy see the

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.629 
and they're gonna be patchy see the
surface<00:03:04.269> composition<00:03:04.689> of<00:03:05.290> this<00:03:05.560> asteroid<00:03:06.219> and

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:06.639 
surface composition of this asteroid and

00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:08.309 
surface composition of this asteroid and
it's<00:03:06.760> gonna<00:03:06.849> be<00:03:07.030> a<00:03:07.060> great<00:03:07.510> opportunity<00:03:07.689> see

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:08.319 
it's gonna be a great opportunity see

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:10.679 
it's gonna be a great opportunity see
see<00:03:08.560> something<00:03:09.159> this<00:03:09.400> size<00:03:09.669> they've<00:03:10.359> done<00:03:10.569> it

00:03:10.679 --> 00:03:10.689 
see something this size they've done it
