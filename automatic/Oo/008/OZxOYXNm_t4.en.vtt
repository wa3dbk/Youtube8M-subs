00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:01.720 
electrical connectors we have to worry

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:02.880 
electrical connectors we have to worry
about<00:04:01.959> we<00:04:02.110> want<00:04:02.230> to<00:04:02.290> make<00:04:02.380> sure<00:04:02.410> our<00:04:02.590> steering

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:02.890 
about we want to make sure our steering

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:07.250 
about we want to make sure our steering
calls<00:04:03.100> all<00:04:03.280> the<00:04:03.370> way<00:04:03.459> down<00:04:03.640> and<00:04:04.090> then<00:04:05.050> just

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
calls all the way down and then just

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.440 
calls all the way down and then just
gently<00:04:08.260> slide<00:04:08.709> it<00:04:09.700> gets<00:04:09.880> caught<00:04:10.120> up<00:04:10.270> right

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:10.450 
gently slide it gets caught up right

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:12.180 
gently slide it gets caught up right
here<00:04:10.870> you<00:04:10.990> got<00:04:11.080> to<00:04:11.200> kind<00:04:11.350> of<00:04:11.410> slide<00:04:11.740> this<00:04:11.950> out

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.190 
here you got to kind of slide this out

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:18.140 
here you got to kind of slide this out
and<00:04:12.580> then<00:04:13.450> lift<00:04:13.690> up<00:04:13.930> my<00:04:14.200> back<00:04:15.000> and<00:04:16.530> now<00:04:17.530> we<00:04:17.590> have

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
and then lift up my back and now we have

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:21.060 
and then lift up my back and now we have
this<00:04:19.150> wiring<00:04:19.540> is<00:04:19.870> on<00:04:20.290> the<00:04:20.620> back<00:04:20.799> of<00:04:21.010> the

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.070 
this wiring is on the back of the

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:22.260 
this wiring is on the back of the
cigarette<00:04:21.430> lighter<00:04:21.459> you<00:04:21.820> just<00:04:21.970> reach<00:04:22.150> around

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 
cigarette lighter you just reach around

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.450 
cigarette lighter you just reach around
you'll<00:04:22.570> actually<00:04:22.720> feel<00:04:23.080> a<00:04:23.110> little<00:04:23.290> a<00:04:23.620> little

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.460 
you'll actually feel a little a little

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:26.120 
you'll actually feel a little a little
lever<00:04:24.640> you<00:04:24.790> can<00:04:24.940> push<00:04:25.090> down<00:04:25.120> on<00:04:25.330> right<00:04:25.870> there

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
lever you can push down on right there

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:29.550 
lever you can push down on right there
push<00:04:27.130> down<00:04:27.340> on<00:04:27.460> that<00:04:27.580> and<00:04:27.700> pull<00:04:27.910> out<00:04:28.470> so<00:04:29.470> I'll

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560 
push down on that and pull out so I'll

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.010 
push down on that and pull out so I'll
show<00:04:29.710> that<00:04:29.830> one<00:04:29.950> more<00:04:30.040> time<00:04:30.160> right<00:04:30.850> there<00:04:31.090> just

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.020 
show that one more time right there just

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.470 
show that one more time right there just
push<00:04:32.290> down<00:04:32.320> right<00:04:32.800> there<00:04:33.070> and<00:04:33.340> it<00:04:34.240> will<00:04:34.330> pull

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:34.480 
push down right there and it will pull

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:36.450 
push down right there and it will pull
right<00:04:34.600> out<00:04:34.800> and<00:04:35.800> we're<00:04:35.950> going<00:04:36.070> to<00:04:36.100> gently

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:36.460 
right out and we're going to gently

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:40.470 
right out and we're going to gently
going<00:04:36.820> to<00:04:36.940> turn<00:04:37.150> this<00:04:37.300> around<00:04:39.210> so<00:04:40.210> we<00:04:40.330> can<00:04:40.390> get

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:40.480 
going to turn this around so we can get

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:58.980 
going to turn this around so we can get
to<00:04:40.540> the<00:04:40.720> other<00:04:40.750> connectors

00:04:58.980 --> 00:04:58.990 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:00.870 

so<00:04:59.470> that's<00:04:59.650> what<00:04:59.800> they<00:04:59.889> look<00:05:00.100> like<00:05:00.130> you<00:05:00.639> don't

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:00.880 
so that's what they look like you don't

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:02.279 
so that's what they look like you don't
have<00:05:00.970> to<00:05:01.120> necessarily<00:05:01.240> twist<00:05:01.780> it<00:05:01.900> around<00:05:02.139> but

00:05:02.279 --> 00:05:02.289 
have to necessarily twist it around but

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:10.250 
pop it up like that some of them won't

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:11.890 
pop it up like that some of them won't
have<00:05:10.580> this<00:05:10.879> switch<00:05:11.150> some<00:05:11.449> of<00:05:11.569> them<00:05:11.690> will

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:11.900 
have this switch some of them will

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:14.490 
have this switch some of them will
depend<00:05:12.259> on<00:05:12.349> us<00:05:12.500> too<00:05:12.650> if<00:05:12.800> it<00:05:12.919> has<00:05:13.160> CNG<00:05:13.639> or<00:05:13.669> not

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:18.550 
okay set that aside and then this piece

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:21.500 
okay set that aside and then this piece
is<00:05:19.550> now<00:05:19.789> removed

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:21.510

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:24.750 
okay now we got left to do is just take

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:38.530 
okay now we got left to do is just take
these<00:05:24.930> two<00:05:25.170> screws<00:05:25.530> out<00:05:25.770> right<00:05:26.010> here

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:38.540 

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:40.660 

and<00:05:38.630> the<00:05:39.200> instrument<00:05:39.560> cluster<00:05:39.650> slides<00:05:40.430> up

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:40.670 
and the instrument cluster slides up

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:43.890 
and the instrument cluster slides up
these<00:05:41.600> two<00:05:41.780> little<00:05:42.020> grooves<00:05:42.260> and<00:05:43.160> it's<00:05:43.640> out

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:43.900 
these two little grooves and it's out

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:46.090 
these two little grooves and it's out
now<00:05:44.900> what<00:05:45.080> I<00:05:45.110> wanted<00:05:45.380> to<00:05:45.470> show<00:05:45.680> you<00:05:45.710> on<00:05:45.950> this

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:46.100 
now what I wanted to show you on this

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:48.130 
now what I wanted to show you on this
cluster<00:05:46.550> is<00:05:46.640> you<00:05:46.790> can<00:05:46.970> see<00:05:47.180> that<00:05:47.480> the<00:05:47.600> gauges

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:48.140 
cluster is you can see that the gauges

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:51.820 
cluster is you can see that the gauges
are<00:05:48.440> not<00:05:49.220> functioning<00:05:49.790> properly<00:05:50.500> we<00:05:51.500> have<00:05:51.590> a

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:51.830 
are not functioning properly we have a

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:53.200 
are not functioning properly we have a
temperature<00:05:52.160> gauge<00:05:52.430> that's<00:05:52.790> not<00:05:52.940> functioning

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:53.210 
temperature gauge that's not functioning

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:55.000 
temperature gauge that's not functioning
so<00:05:53.870> that's<00:05:54.140> why<00:05:54.260> we're<00:05:54.410> taking<00:05:54.680> this<00:05:54.800> one<00:05:54.950> out

so that's why we're taking this one out

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:57.520 
so that's why we're taking this one out
we're<00:05:55.790> going<00:05:55.940> to<00:05:56.000> replace<00:05:56.270> all<00:05:57.020> the<00:05:57.320> gauges
