00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.780 

compress<00:02:46.340> the<00:02:46.720> piston<00:02:47.720> back<00:02:48.140> into<00:02:48.620> the

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
compress the piston back into the

00:02:48.790 --> 00:03:06.640 
compress the piston back into the
caliper<00:02:50.620> use<00:02:51.620> a<00:02:51.650> old<00:02:52.519> brake<00:02:52.820> pad<00:02:53.140> like<00:02:54.140> this<00:03:05.650> C

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
caliper use a old brake pad like this C

and then you just cook you came back on
you<00:03:22.330> bolted<00:03:23.909> bolted<00:03:24.909> back<00:03:25.120> this<00:03:25.780> is<00:03:26.019> your<00:03:26.640> then

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640 
you bolted bolted back this is your then

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:38.839 
you bolted bolted back this is your then
you<00:03:27.790> censor<00:03:28.330> the<00:03:28.569> great<00:03:28.810> sensor<00:03:33.840> right<00:03:34.840> here

00:03:38.839 --> 00:03:38.849 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:51.449 

just<00:03:39.849> pop<00:03:40.180> it<00:03:40.390> out<00:03:40.510> from<00:03:40.780> here<00:03:48.299> and<00:03:49.299> you<00:03:50.459> Fitz

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:51.459 
just pop it out from here and you Fitz

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:53.670 
just pop it out from here and you Fitz
on<00:03:51.700> the<00:03:51.730> break<00:03:52.090> like<00:03:52.810> this<00:03:53.049> you<00:03:53.230> just<00:03:53.379> take<00:03:53.620> it

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 
on the break like this you just take it

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:58.020 
on the break like this you just take it
off<00:03:53.950> from<00:03:54.069> here<00:03:54.660> and<00:03:55.660> put<00:03:55.900> it<00:03:56.019> on<00:03:56.170> back<00:03:57.030> then
