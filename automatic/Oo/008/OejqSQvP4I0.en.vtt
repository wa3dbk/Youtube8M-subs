00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
terms were back in 2009 but we're going

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.819 
terms were back in 2009 but we're going
to<00:01:53.700> look<00:01:53.820> forward<00:01:54.090> to<00:01:54.350> 2013<00:01:55.350> since<00:01:55.619> that's

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
to look forward to 2013 since that's

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.249 
to look forward to 2013 since that's
where<00:01:56.100> we're<00:01:56.670> at<00:01:56.700> and<00:01:57.149> if<00:01:57.479> you<00:01:57.630> go<00:01:57.810> back<00:01:58.049> and

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
where we're at and if you go back and

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.440 
where we're at and if you go back and
you<00:01:58.350> just<00:01:58.560> look<00:01:58.710> at<00:01:58.829> August<00:01:59.310> you<00:01:59.880> do<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.210> same

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
you just look at August you do the same

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.950 
you just look at August you do the same
search<00:02:01.490> you'll<00:02:02.490> see<00:02:02.700> that<00:02:02.909> resale<00:02:03.540> isn't

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
search you'll see that resale isn't

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.649 
search you'll see that resale isn't
there<00:02:04.200> so<00:02:04.649> this<00:02:05.009> is<00:02:05.340> brand<00:02:05.790> new<00:02:05.909> wording<00:02:06.329> that

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
there so this is brand new wording that

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.559 
there so this is brand new wording that
was<00:02:06.930> added<00:02:07.469> apparently<00:02:08.340> here<00:02:08.700> in<00:02:08.910> November

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
was added apparently here in November

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.720 
was added apparently here in November
with<00:02:10.140> the<00:02:10.289> launch<00:02:10.500> of<00:02:10.770> the<00:02:11.280> PlayStation<00:02:11.400> 4<00:02:11.879> and

with the launch of the PlayStation 4 and

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.670 
with the launch of the PlayStation 4 and
also<00:02:13.120> saw<00:02:13.330> some<00:02:13.540> people<00:02:13.750> who<00:02:13.900> said<00:02:14.170> that<00:02:14.410> it

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
also saw some people who said that it

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.500 
also saw some people who said that it
probably<00:02:14.890> if<00:02:15.250> you<00:02:15.370> go<00:02:15.520> over<00:02:15.819> and<00:02:15.940> you<00:02:16.030> look<00:02:16.270> at

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
probably if you go over and you look at

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.720 
probably if you go over and you look at
the<00:02:16.750> Xbox's<00:02:17.470> Terms<00:02:17.709> of<00:02:17.920> Service<00:02:17.980> or<00:02:18.430> whatever

the Xbox's Terms of Service or whatever

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:20.759 
the Xbox's Terms of Service or whatever
that<00:02:19.239> you'll<00:02:19.390> find<00:02:19.690> the<00:02:19.870> same<00:02:20.050> type<00:02:20.290> wording

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:20.769 
that you'll find the same type wording

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:23.610 
that you'll find the same type wording
but<00:02:21.310> I<00:02:21.340> went<00:02:21.819> and<00:02:22.000> I<00:02:22.090> looked<00:02:22.330> at<00:02:22.660> Nintendo<00:02:23.319> and

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.880 
but I went and I looked at Nintendo and
I<00:02:23.769> looked<00:02:24.069> at<00:02:24.220> Microsoft<00:02:24.849> and<00:02:25.620> you<00:02:26.620> know<00:02:26.709> maybe

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
I looked at Microsoft and you know maybe

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:28.710 
I looked at Microsoft and you know maybe
I<00:02:27.010> didn't<00:02:27.400> find<00:02:27.670> it<00:02:27.849> right<00:02:28.030> maybe<00:02:28.209> they<00:02:28.420> didn't

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
I didn't find it right maybe they didn't

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.080 
I didn't find it right maybe they didn't
word<00:02:29.080> it<00:02:29.260> exactly<00:02:29.680> the<00:02:29.860> same<00:02:30.069> but<00:02:30.610> I<00:02:30.640> couldn't

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
word it exactly the same but I couldn't

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.479 
word it exactly the same but I couldn't
find<00:02:31.239> anything<00:02:31.720> about<00:02:32.170> not<00:02:32.830> being<00:02:33.160> able<00:02:33.340> to

some<00:03:02.440> protection<00:03:02.860> that<00:03:03.010> apparently<00:03:03.370> they

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:03.489 
some protection that apparently they

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:05.550 
some protection that apparently they
didn't<00:03:03.790> need<00:03:03.940> this<00:03:04.450> current<00:03:04.900> generation<00:03:04.959> but

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
didn't need this current generation but

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.370 
didn't need this current generation but
also<00:03:06.069> let's<00:03:06.640> note<00:03:06.880> that<00:03:06.910> the<00:03:07.630> same<00:03:07.840> technology

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
also let's note that the same technology

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.069 
also let's note that the same technology
is<00:03:08.530> in<00:03:08.709> place<00:03:08.739> for<00:03:09.250> both<00:03:09.910> the<00:03:10.269> Xbox<00:03:10.810> and

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:11.079 
is in place for both the Xbox and

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:13.110 
is in place for both the Xbox and
Playstation<00:03:12.010> if<00:03:12.250> they<00:03:12.489> want<00:03:12.760> to<00:03:12.970> limit

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
Playstation if they want to limit

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.699 
Playstation if they want to limit
second-hand<00:03:13.900> sales<00:03:14.459> both<00:03:15.459> could<00:03:16.030> do<00:03:16.209> it<00:03:16.390> today

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
second-hand sales both could do it today

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:19.020 
second-hand sales both could do it today
but<00:03:17.709> I<00:03:17.739> don't<00:03:17.889> think<00:03:18.340> that's<00:03:18.549> going<00:03:18.730> to<00:03:18.819> happen

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
but I don't think that's going to happen

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.720 
but I don't think that's going to happen
publishers<00:03:19.989> on<00:03:20.200> the<00:03:20.290> other<00:03:20.440> hand<00:03:20.739> they<00:03:21.700> have

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
publishers on the other hand they have

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.270 
publishers on the other hand they have
that<00:03:22.239> capability<00:03:22.660> and<00:03:22.959> both<00:03:23.560> Microsoft<00:03:23.950> and

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
that capability and both Microsoft and

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.410 
that capability and both Microsoft and
Sony<00:03:24.579> have<00:03:24.670> said<00:03:24.940> that<00:03:25.060> they're<00:03:25.180> going<00:03:25.299> to

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
Sony have said that they're going to

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.059 
Sony have said that they're going to
leave<00:03:25.540> it<00:03:25.660> up<00:03:25.720> to<00:03:25.870> publishers<00:03:26.290> and<00:03:26.500> sign<00:03:26.799> and

00:03:27.059 --> 00:03:27.069 
leave it up to publishers and sign and

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:29.160 
leave it up to publishers and sign and
so<00:03:27.760> if<00:03:28.030> one<00:03:28.269> of<00:03:28.299> them<00:03:28.480> wants<00:03:28.630> to<00:03:28.780> flip<00:03:28.989> the

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:29.170 
so if one of them wants to flip the

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.530 
so if one of them wants to flip the
switch<00:03:29.380> on<00:03:29.680> their<00:03:30.400> particular<00:03:30.700> game<00:03:31.090> then

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
switch on their particular game then

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.990 
switch on their particular game then
they<00:03:31.989> have<00:03:32.260> that<00:03:32.440> right<00:03:32.650> to<00:03:32.829> do<00:03:32.980> so<00:03:33.220> hopefully

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
they have that right to do so hopefully

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.940
