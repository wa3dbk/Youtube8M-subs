I<00:04:27.530> want<00:04:27.890> to<00:04:28.010> give<00:04:28.130> you<00:04:28.250> a<00:04:28.340> few<00:04:28.640> small<00:04:29.330> tips<00:04:30.020> and

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:30.260 
I want to give you a few small tips and

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.650 
I want to give you a few small tips and
tricks<00:04:30.530> that<00:04:30.800> I<00:04:31.430> have<00:04:31.610> picked<00:04:31.820> up<00:04:32.060> true

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:32.660 
tricks that I have picked up true

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:35.260 
tricks that I have picked up true
playing<00:04:32.960> this<00:04:33.140> game<00:04:33.410> and<00:04:33.770> especially<00:04:34.270> about

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:35.270 
playing this game and especially about

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:38.260 
playing this game and especially about
anti-tank<00:04:36.020> mines<00:04:36.290> no<00:04:37.070> anti-tank<00:04:37.730> mines<00:04:37.940> are

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:38.270 
anti-tank mines no anti-tank mines are

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:40.780 
anti-tank mines no anti-tank mines are
the<00:04:38.810> best<00:04:39.110> thing<00:04:39.560> you<00:04:39.770> could<00:04:39.920> possibly<00:04:39.950> have

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:40.790 
the best thing you could possibly have

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:42.880 
the best thing you could possibly have
because<00:04:41.510> they<00:04:41.750> don't<00:04:41.960> disappear<00:04:42.440> when<00:04:42.620> you<00:04:42.710> do

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:42.890 
because they don't disappear when you do

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:44.470 
because they don't disappear when you do
so<00:04:43.520> when<00:04:43.610> you're<00:04:43.730> placing<00:04:43.880> an<00:04:44.120> anti-tank

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:44.480 
so when you're placing an anti-tank

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.660 
so when you're placing an anti-tank
going<00:04:44.750> like<00:04:44.930> here<00:04:45.170> make<00:04:45.740> sure<00:04:45.770> you<00:04:46.130> place<00:04:46.400> it

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:46.670 
going like here make sure you place it

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:49.930 
going like here make sure you place it
in<00:04:46.820> the<00:04:46.910> shadows<00:04:47.720> and<00:04:48.050> possibly<00:04:49.040> if<00:04:49.370> there<00:04:49.820> is

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:49.940 
in the shadows and possibly if there is

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:51.400 
in the shadows and possibly if there is
one<00:04:50.150> place<00:04:50.420> it<00:04:50.600> at<00:04:50.690> the<00:04:50.720> junction<00:04:51.140> are<00:04:51.230> two

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:51.410 
one place it at the junction are two

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:53.380 
one place it at the junction are two
roads<00:04:51.710> so<00:04:52.460> no<00:04:52.610> matter<00:04:52.670> which<00:04:52.910> way<00:04:52.940> the<00:04:53.090> tank

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:53.390 
roads so no matter which way the tank

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:55.480 
roads so no matter which way the tank
cause<00:04:53.600> it's<00:04:53.630> going<00:04:54.200> to<00:04:54.320> blow<00:04:54.530> up<00:04:54.710> and<00:04:54.920> as<00:04:55.340> you

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:55.490 
cause it's going to blow up and as you

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:58.330 
cause it's going to blow up and as you
can<00:04:55.640> see<00:04:55.670> there<00:04:56.030> bang<00:04:56.390> tank<00:04:57.200> blows<00:04:57.800> up<00:04:58.040> kills

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:58.340 
can see there bang tank blows up kills

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:02.110 
can see there bang tank blows up kills
two<00:04:58.670> of<00:04:58.790> them<00:04:58.940> and<00:04:59.150> possibly<00:04:59.810> saves<00:05:00.670> 10<00:05:01.670> ladies

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:02.120 
two of them and possibly saves 10 ladies

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.150 
two of them and possibly saves 10 ladies

on my team no comment apparent just a
second<00:05:04.520> is<00:05:04.580> probably<00:05:05.030> the<00:05:05.270> best<00:05:05.660> example<00:05:05.930> I

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:06.650 
second is probably the best example I

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:09.520 
second is probably the best example I
will<00:05:07.040> ever<00:05:07.340> capture<00:05:07.970> on<00:05:08.090> camera<00:05:08.120> of<00:05:08.780> what<00:05:09.410> you

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:09.530 
will ever capture on camera of what you

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:11.380 
will ever capture on camera of what you
have<00:05:09.920> to<00:05:10.160> keep<00:05:10.370> a<00:05:10.490> strong<00:05:10.760> front<00:05:11.120> line

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:11.390 
have to keep a strong front line

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:13.930 
have to keep a strong front line
especially<00:05:12.110> in<00:05:12.470> games<00:05:12.680> like<00:05:13.010> this<00:05:13.220> the

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:13.940 
especially in games like this the

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:15.850 
especially in games like this the
example<00:05:14.300> I<00:05:14.540> used<00:05:14.780> before<00:05:15.020> I<00:05:15.230> think<00:05:15.500> was<00:05:15.650> two

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:15.860 
example I used before I think was two

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:18.040 
example I used before I think was two
medics<00:05:16.280> and<00:05:16.520> engineer<00:05:17.120> and<00:05:17.419> maybe<00:05:17.660> something

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:18.050 
medics and engineer and maybe something

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:20.770 
medics and engineer and maybe something
else<00:05:18.230> and<00:05:18.530> this<00:05:19.160> is<00:05:19.430> exactly<00:05:19.610> what<00:05:20.210> I<00:05:20.240> got<00:05:20.480> here

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:20.780 
else and this is exactly what I got here

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:24.070 
else and this is exactly what I got here
but<00:05:21.680> these<00:05:22.280> weren't<00:05:22.550> actually<00:05:22.790> my<00:05:23.360> personal

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:24.080 
but these weren't actually my personal

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:25.930 
but these weren't actually my personal
squad<00:05:24.350> members<00:05:24.770> as<00:05:25.040> you<00:05:25.190> can<00:05:25.310> see<00:05:25.520> i<00:05:25.550> do<00:05:25.730> not

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:25.940 
squad members as you can see i do not

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:28.690 
squad members as you can see i do not
have<00:05:26.090> a<00:05:26.120> squad<00:05:26.440> but<00:05:27.440> they<00:05:27.620> had<00:05:27.890> the<00:05:28.100> idea<00:05:28.250> and

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:28.700 
have a squad but they had the idea and

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:30.000 
have a squad but they had the idea and
they<00:05:28.790> knew<00:05:28.970> what<00:05:29.120> they<00:05:29.150> have<00:05:29.390> to<00:05:29.480> do<00:05:29.630> and

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:30.010 
they knew what they have to do and

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:33.400 
they knew what they have to do and
despite<00:05:31.010> not<00:05:31.340> being<00:05:31.400> able<00:05:31.669> to<00:05:31.850> communicate<00:05:32.410> we
