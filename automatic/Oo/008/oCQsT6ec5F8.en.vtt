00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:14.610
 welcome to wils hair creations 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.250
 today i want you one 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:20.699
 creation show what member it is one 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:23.039
 kind in bad and then with the shape of 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.200
 from menu an 8 finds a bit 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:29.220
 difficult to explain 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:31.200
 I will probably start with one 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.309
 ribbon 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:36.930
 now I have a transparent rubber band 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:41.270
 and elastic cloth to pick their 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.270
 with her so I fixed him 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:58.680
 This way, you'll see a beautiful int after 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.680
 its possession 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.550
 go pick two with her 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.540
 client also lizzie on the outside 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:15.750
 like a 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:15.750
 for clarity, hit the bottom 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:22.140
 I will go over the others there too 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.140
 underneath 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:28.560
 and then I go over it again really like 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.560
 a figure 8 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:35.950
 no, I am taking it at the moment 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:39.060
 picking her get on the right 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.060
 so I at the outer pub 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.170
 I therefore also wrap the ribbon around it 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.700
 so he passed underneath 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:07.000
 I'm here mean thereby 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:11.560
 over and then I want him from us 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:14.560
 this side do is I go that way 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:20.470
 work and I only take it from 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:21.910
 here I grab her you can handle him too 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:25.050
 do both sides but then you just have 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.050
 again the total for tracks 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:36.580
 to the through over it 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:40.920
 with that I go over simple 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:44.970
 with a pick I put the panache here 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.970
 the ribbon is underneath abi 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.810
 I actually go on to here 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.810
 about 

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:05.930
 well now i got it all the way through 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:07.460
 Braided this out and got it here 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:11.170
 put in a rubber band 

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:11.170
 well then you can see that this is loose 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:16.090
 so what about a i just grab the 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.090
 rest of the hair 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:26.770
 I would like this a little tighter there 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:26.770
 just a very nice one 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:37.000
 knot of what i like is that you say 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:37.000
 but that turns the roll 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:46.900
 on your very nice creation 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:50.670
 just a little bit different and you can give him one 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.670
 bit of updating with the can 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:01.570
 you can use this button if necessary 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:01.570
 little bit with pins
