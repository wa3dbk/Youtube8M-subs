this is a quick video explaining how I

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:06.340 
this is a quick video explaining how I
built<00:00:03.379> my<00:00:03.439> homemade<00:00:04.100> whole<00:00:04.550> house<00:00:04.759> fan<00:00:05.350> you

built my homemade whole house fan you
can<00:00:06.529> see<00:00:06.770> I've<00:00:07.069> built<00:00:07.669> it<00:00:07.819> in<00:00:07.970> my<00:00:08.120> attic<00:00:08.510> access

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:08.720 
can see I've built it in my attic access

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:11.080 
can see I've built it in my attic access
door<00:00:09.320> I've<00:00:09.740> actually<00:00:09.950> made<00:00:10.250> a<00:00:10.310> new<00:00:10.610> door<00:00:10.910> out

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:11.090 
door I've actually made a new door out

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:14.320 
door I've actually made a new door out
of<00:00:11.180> half<00:00:11.660> inch<00:00:11.900> plywood<00:00:12.700> I've<00:00:13.700> cut<00:00:13.910> it<00:00:14.030> to<00:00:14.150> size

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:14.330 
of half inch plywood I've cut it to size

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:17.320 
of half inch plywood I've cut it to size
to<00:00:14.630> fit<00:00:14.840> this<00:00:15.110> 28<00:00:15.620> by<00:00:15.830> 28<00:00:15.890> inch<00:00:16.669> opening

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:17.330 
to fit this 28 by 28 inch opening

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:20.980 
to fit this 28 by 28 inch opening
I've<00:00:17.929> also<00:00:18.400> purchased<00:00:19.400> a<00:00:19.580> fan<00:00:20.089> from<00:00:20.390> Walmart<00:00:20.839> a

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:20.990 
I've also purchased a fan from Walmart a

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:22.720 
I've also purchased a fan from Walmart a
circular<00:00:21.380> fan<00:00:21.679> that<00:00:21.919> would<00:00:22.039> normally<00:00:22.160> be<00:00:22.429> used

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:22.730 
circular fan that would normally be used

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:23.380 
circular fan that would normally be used
on<00:00:22.910> the<00:00:23.029> floor

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:23.390 
on the floor

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.779 
on the floor
it<00:00:23.689> came<00:00:23.960> with<00:00:24.109> a<00:00:24.140> stand<00:00:24.529> it's<00:00:25.160> a<00:00:25.310> 20<00:00:25.640> inch

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:25.789 
it came with a stand it's a 20 inch

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:28.060 
it came with a stand it's a 20 inch
diameter<00:00:26.419> fan<00:00:26.720> so<00:00:27.050> that's<00:00:27.230> referring<00:00:27.619> to<00:00:27.740> the

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:28.070 
diameter fan so that's referring to the

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:30.550 
diameter fan so that's referring to the
blade<00:00:28.460> diameter<00:00:29.150> and<00:00:29.329> so<00:00:29.779> the<00:00:29.810> fan<00:00:30.079> itself<00:00:30.380> is

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:30.560 
blade diameter and so the fan itself is

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.520 
blade diameter and so the fan itself is
a<00:00:30.589> little<00:00:30.800> bit<00:00:30.919> bigger<00:00:31.130> maybe<00:00:31.570> 22<00:00:32.570> or<00:00:32.780> 23<00:00:33.350> inch

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:33.530 
a little bit bigger maybe 22 or 23 inch

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.370 
a little bit bigger maybe 22 or 23 inch
diameter<00:00:34.430> and<00:00:34.640> so<00:00:35.240> the<00:00:35.420> idea<00:00:35.720> behind<00:00:35.900> a<00:00:36.200> whole

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:36.380 
diameter and so the idea behind a whole

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:40.330 
diameter and so the idea behind a whole
house<00:00:36.590> fan<00:00:36.920> has<00:00:37.430> a<00:00:37.460> few<00:00:38.300> benefits<00:00:39.190> first<00:00:40.190> of

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:40.340 
house fan has a few benefits first of

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.490 
house fan has a few benefits first of

heating up that attic air all day that

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.630 
heating up that attic air all day that
hot<00:01:02.390> air<00:01:02.770> temperature<00:01:03.770> transfers<00:01:04.369> into<00:01:04.519> your

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:04.640 
hot air temperature transfers into your

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.270 
hot air temperature transfers into your
house<00:01:04.820> and<00:01:05.119> makes<00:01:05.299> the<00:01:05.479> upstairs<00:01:05.840> level<00:01:06.280> very

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
house and makes the upstairs level very

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.149 
house and makes the upstairs level very
hot<00:01:07.579> and<00:01:07.850> usually<00:01:08.570> it's<00:01:08.719> about<00:01:08.929> 10<00:01:09.619> or<00:01:09.799> 15

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:10.159 
hot and usually it's about 10 or 15

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:11.950 
hot and usually it's about 10 or 15
degrees<00:01:10.280> hotter<00:01:10.759> than<00:01:10.939> the<00:01:11.179> main<00:01:11.359> floor<00:01:11.689> and

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 
degrees hotter than the main floor and

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.020 
degrees hotter than the main floor and
so<00:01:12.409> you<00:01:12.469> can<00:01:12.679> turn<00:01:12.920> this<00:01:13.100> on<00:01:13.310> during<00:01:13.700> the<00:01:13.789> day

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.030 
so you can turn this on during the day

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.169 
so you can turn this on during the day
to<00:01:14.359> help<00:01:14.450> keep<00:01:14.749> the<00:01:14.960> air<00:01:14.990> moving<00:01:15.409> around<00:01:15.619> and

00:01:16.169 --> 00:01:16.179 
to help keep the air moving around and

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:19.029 
to help keep the air moving around and
help<00:01:17.179> keep<00:01:17.509> the<00:01:17.840> air<00:01:17.869> upstairs<00:01:18.469> a<00:01:18.560> little<00:01:18.920> bit

00:01:19.029 --> 00:01:19.039 
help keep the air upstairs a little bit

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:21.910 
help keep the air upstairs a little bit
cooler<00:01:19.280> so<00:01:20.149> this<00:01:20.659> fan<00:01:20.990> that<00:01:21.200> I<00:01:21.229> purchased<00:01:21.770> has

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
cooler so this fan that I purchased has

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:22.870 
cooler so this fan that I purchased has
three<00:01:22.399> speeds

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 
three speeds

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.090 
three speeds
luckily<00:01:23.659> the<00:01:23.990> knob<00:01:24.140> is<00:01:24.289> on<00:01:24.409> the<00:01:24.499> back<00:01:24.679> so<00:01:24.950> it's

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
luckily the knob is on the back so it's

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.559 
luckily the knob is on the back so it's
easy<00:01:25.340> to<00:01:25.520> grab<00:01:27.340> what<00:01:28.340> I've<00:01:28.429> done<00:01:28.609> here<00:01:28.969> is<00:01:29.119> I

00:01:29.559 --> 00:01:29.569 
easy to grab what I've done here is I

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:31.690 
easy to grab what I've done here is I
plugged<00:01:29.960> it<00:01:30.139> into<00:01:30.469> an<00:01:30.619> adapter<00:01:31.159> that<00:01:31.189> I<00:01:31.369> used

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
plugged it into an adapter that I used

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.010 
plugged it into an adapter that I used
to<00:01:32.420> thread<00:01:32.780> into<00:01:33.049> my<00:01:33.229> lightbulb<00:01:33.979> socket

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
to thread into my lightbulb socket

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.629 
to thread into my lightbulb socket
that's<00:01:36.020> because<00:01:36.319> I<00:01:36.409> don't<00:01:36.590> have<00:01:36.799> a<00:01:36.829> plug-in

00:01:37.629 --> 00:01:37.639 
that's because I don't have a plug-in

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:41.020 
that's because I don't have a plug-in
socket<00:01:38.210> in<00:01:38.329> the<00:01:38.450> attic<00:01:39.399> so<00:01:40.399> here's<00:01:40.639> the<00:01:40.819> whole

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
socket in the attic so here's the whole

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.580 
socket in the attic so here's the whole
door<00:01:41.389> take<00:01:42.049> a<00:01:42.079> note<00:01:43.479> and<00:01:44.479> it's<00:01:44.959> a<00:01:45.049> five<00:01:45.319> blade

fan<00:01:45.950> and<00:01:46.670> it's<00:01:46.819> got<00:01:46.939> the<00:01:47.090> knob<00:01:47.240> here<00:01:47.600> on<00:01:47.719> the

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
fan and it's got the knob here on the

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.760 
fan and it's got the knob here on the

comes out of the back too which is nice

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:55.480 
comes out of the back too which is nice
I've<00:01:53.630> just<00:01:54.289> zip<00:01:54.530> tied<00:01:54.740> it<00:01:54.950> to<00:01:55.159> the<00:01:55.340> actual

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
I've just zip tied it to the actual

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.239 
I've just zip tied it to the actual
frame<00:01:56.060> itself<00:01:56.590> just<00:01:57.590> so<00:01:57.709> the<00:01:57.799> cord<00:01:58.069> doesn't

00:01:58.239 --> 00:01:58.249 
frame itself just so the cord doesn't

00:01:58.249 --> 00:02:00.249 
frame itself just so the cord doesn't
hang<00:01:58.520> down<00:01:58.549> both<00:01:59.420> of<00:01:59.569> those<00:01:59.630> have<00:01:59.779> tied<00:01:59.990> up<00:02:00.109> the

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:00.259 
hang down both of those have tied up the

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:02.289 
hang down both of those have tied up the
excess<00:02:00.619> cord<00:02:00.920> to<00:02:01.130> stop<00:02:01.340> it<00:02:01.520> from<00:02:01.639> hitting

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:02.299 
excess cord to stop it from hitting

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:05.469 
excess cord to stop it from hitting
people<00:02:02.689> in<00:02:02.779> the<00:02:02.869> head<00:02:03.670> flip<00:02:04.670> it<00:02:04.819> around<00:02:04.909> you

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
people in the head flip it around you

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:07.510 
people in the head flip it around you
can<00:02:05.689> see<00:02:05.869> the<00:02:06.020> backside<00:02:06.409> of<00:02:06.619> it<00:02:06.679> there's<00:02:07.429> a

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
can see the backside of it there's a

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.219 
can see the backside of it there's a
feather<00:02:07.789> actually<00:02:08.270> from<00:02:08.450> the<00:02:08.599> attic<00:02:08.899> I<00:02:09.019> didn't

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
feather actually from the attic I didn't

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:10.110 
feather actually from the attic I didn't
see<00:02:09.319> that<00:02:09.439> before

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:10.120 
see that before

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:13.449 
see that before
it<00:02:11.120> looks<00:02:11.299> like<00:02:11.480> it's<00:02:11.659> about<00:02:11.890> four<00:02:12.890> or<00:02:13.189> five

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
it looks like it's about four or five

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:15.460 
it looks like it's about four or five
inches<00:02:13.700> deep<00:02:14.150> but<00:02:14.720> that's<00:02:14.930> on<00:02:15.170> the<00:02:15.260> other<00:02:15.379> side

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
inches deep but that's on the other side

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:16.630 
inches deep but that's on the other side
of<00:02:15.709> the<00:02:15.799> Attic<00:02:16.069> so<00:02:16.099> that<00:02:16.250> doesn't<00:02:16.430> really

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
of the Attic so that doesn't really

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.740 
of the Attic so that doesn't really
matter<00:02:16.879> the<00:02:17.750> area<00:02:17.989> inside<00:02:18.439> the<00:02:18.620> house

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
matter the area inside the house

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.780 
matter the area inside the house
protrudes<00:02:20.750> very<00:02:21.409> little<00:02:21.799> from<00:02:22.430> the<00:02:22.580> door

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
protrudes very little from the door

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.910 
protrudes very little from the door
itself<00:02:23.180> so<00:02:23.870> there's<00:02:24.110> no<00:02:24.230> issue<00:02:24.409> of<00:02:24.560> hitting

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
itself so there's no issue of hitting

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.920 
itself so there's no issue of hitting
your<00:02:25.010> head<00:02:25.189> on<00:02:25.340> it<00:02:25.370> or<00:02:25.610> anything<00:02:25.849> this<00:02:26.689> is<00:02:26.750> a

sunbeam model fan believe this was about

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.610 
sunbeam model fan believe this was about

of<00:03:08.420> fans<00:03:08.629> have<00:03:08.870> a<00:03:08.930> sort<00:03:09.349> of<00:03:09.409> irregular<00:03:10.010> plastic

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
of fans have a sort of irregular plastic

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.170 
of fans have a sort of irregular plastic
molded<00:03:11.510> shape<00:03:11.870> and<00:03:12.579> so<00:03:13.579> you'll<00:03:13.760> want<00:03:13.939> to<00:03:14.000> find

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
molded shape and so you'll want to find

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.209 
molded shape and so you'll want to find
something<00:03:14.480> that's<00:03:14.780> flat<00:03:15.110> so<00:03:15.469> you<00:03:15.560> can<00:03:15.739> easily

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:16.219 
something that's flat so you can easily

00:03:16.219 --> 00:03:19.630 
something that's flat so you can easily
mount<00:03:16.400> it<00:03:16.670> to<00:03:16.790> something<00:03:18.129> if<00:03:19.129> you're<00:03:19.340> looking

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
mount it to something if you're looking

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.199 
mount it to something if you're looking
to<00:03:19.790> build<00:03:20.000> your<00:03:20.180> own<00:03:20.239> whole<00:03:21.049> house<00:03:21.260> fan<00:03:21.590> I

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.209 
to build your own whole house fan I

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:25.569 
to build your own whole house fan I
recommend<00:03:23.209> buying<00:03:23.450> a<00:03:23.860> wireless<00:03:24.860> temperature

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:25.579 
recommend buying a wireless temperature

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:28.119 
recommend buying a wireless temperature
sensor<00:03:26.090> and<00:03:26.810> that's<00:03:27.140> what<00:03:27.319> this<00:03:27.439> is<00:03:27.500> here<00:03:27.950> and

00:03:28.119 --> 00:03:28.129 
sensor and that's what this is here and

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:30.580 
sensor and that's what this is here and
so<00:03:28.909> I've<00:03:29.060> actually<00:03:29.239> bought<00:03:29.599> a<00:03:29.900> few<00:03:30.170> sets<00:03:30.409> of

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
so I've actually bought a few sets of

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.500 
so I've actually bought a few sets of
these<00:03:30.739> and<00:03:30.769> so<00:03:31.189> they<00:03:31.340> all<00:03:31.459> sort<00:03:32.030> of<00:03:32.150> work<00:03:32.329> in

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
these and so they all sort of work in

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:34.780 
these and so they all sort of work in
tandem<00:03:32.750> and<00:03:33.140> can<00:03:33.379> read<00:03:33.709> each<00:03:33.950> other<00:03:34.250> so<00:03:34.549> I<00:03:34.579> have

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
tandem and can read each other so I have

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:35.890 
tandem and can read each other so I have
a<00:03:34.819> few<00:03:35.060> different<00:03:35.359> temperatures<00:03:35.719> that<00:03:35.840> are

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
a few different temperatures that are

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.500 
a few different temperatures that are
scrolling<00:03:36.290> on<00:03:36.620> the<00:03:36.799> bottom<00:03:37.250> number<00:03:37.400> the<00:03:38.329> top

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 
scrolling on the bottom number the top

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:40.630 
scrolling on the bottom number the top
number<00:03:38.870> is<00:03:39.019> the<00:03:39.230> temperature<00:03:39.980> of<00:03:40.099> where<00:03:40.459> the

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:40.640 
number is the temperature of where the

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.459 
number is the temperature of where the
display<00:03:41.000> itself<00:03:41.390> is<00:03:41.540> located<00:03:41.659> so<00:03:42.170> in<00:03:42.290> this

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:42.469 
display itself is located so in this
