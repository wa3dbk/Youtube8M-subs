seen a lot of goals I'm here to explain
why<00:00:21.420> for<00:00:21.990> me<00:00:22.140> the<00:00:22.470> big<00:00:22.710> issue<00:00:22.980> is<00:00:23.160> formations

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
why for me the big issue is formations

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.000 
why for me the big issue is formations
we're<00:00:24.300> seeing<00:00:24.539> a<00:00:24.689> depth<00:00:25.080> and<00:00:25.260> breadth<00:00:25.590> of<00:00:25.830> them

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
we're seeing a depth and breadth of them

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.880 
we're seeing a depth and breadth of them
that<00:00:26.250> simply<00:00:26.550> didn't<00:00:27.000> exist<00:00:27.090> in<00:00:27.660> 2010<00:00:28.199> 2010

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
that simply didn't exist in 2010 2010

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.640 
that simply didn't exist in 2010 2010
was<00:00:29.070> about<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:29.369> tika<00:00:29.670> taka<00:00:29.880> and<00:00:30.029> 4-2-3-1<00:00:30.900> both

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
was about the tika taka and 4-2-3-1 both

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.590 
was about the tika taka and 4-2-3-1 both
designed<00:00:32.130> to<00:00:32.309> control<00:00:32.579> the<00:00:32.700> game<00:00:33.000> this<00:00:33.540> time

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
designed to control the game this time

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.970 
designed to control the game this time
through<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.290> chest<00:00:34.500> pieces<00:00:34.770> have<00:00:34.890> been

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
through the chest pieces have been

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.650 
through the chest pieces have been
arranged<00:00:35.399> a<00:00:35.489> little<00:00:35.820> bit<00:00:36.000> differently<00:00:36.420> I

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
arranged a little bit differently I

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.750 
arranged a little bit differently I
think<00:00:37.020> it<00:00:37.110> means<00:00:37.260> more<00:00:37.440> transition<00:00:38.100> more<00:00:38.460> open

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
think it means more transition more open

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.510 
think it means more transition more open
play<00:00:38.969> more<00:00:39.480> goals<00:00:39.719> more<00:00:40.410> fun<00:00:40.680> let's<00:00:41.280> break

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
play more goals more fun let's break

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.540 
play more goals more fun let's break
down<00:00:41.550> why<00:00:41.940> that<00:00:42.870> 4-2-3-1<00:00:43.559> that<00:00:43.980> was<00:00:44.219> so

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
down why that 4-2-3-1 that was so

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.760 
down why that 4-2-3-1 that was so
popular<00:00:44.850> does<00:00:45.390> still<00:00:45.660> exist<00:00:45.809> I<00:00:46.260> think<00:00:46.649> it's

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
popular does still exist I think it's

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.979 
popular does still exist I think it's
probably<00:00:47.039> still<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:47.820> predominant<00:00:48.000> formation

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
probably still the predominant formation

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.439 
probably still the predominant formation
for<00:00:49.230> teams<00:00:49.500> in<00:00:49.739> this<00:00:50.309> World<00:00:50.550> Cup<00:00:50.760> but<00:00:51.149> it's<00:00:51.300> not

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
for teams in this World Cup but it's not

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.240 
for teams in this World Cup but it's not
as<00:00:51.629> dominant<00:00:52.110> because<00:00:52.559> it's<00:00:52.829> shown<00:00:53.070> its

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
as dominant because it's shown its

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.729 
as dominant because it's shown its
limitations<00:00:53.850> namely<00:00:54.840> teams<00:00:55.260> are<00:00:55.410> better<00:00:55.530> at

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
limitations namely teams are better at

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.920 
limitations namely teams are better at
disrupting<00:00:56.010> it<00:00:56.520> now<00:00:56.670> they're<00:00:57.149> prepared<00:00:57.600> to<00:00:57.660> go

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
disrupting it now they're prepared to go

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.599 
disrupting it now they're prepared to go

game<00:01:52.710> is<00:01:52.860> a<00:01:52.890> big<00:01:53.130> reason<00:01:53.340> why<00:01:53.490> and<00:01:54.000> the<00:01:54.240> reason

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
game is a big reason why and the reason

game is a big reason why and the reason
is<00:01:54.600> because<00:01:54.689> they<00:01:54.960> have<00:01:55.140> one<00:01:55.409> too<00:01:55.680> few<00:01:56.070> central

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
is because they have one too few central
