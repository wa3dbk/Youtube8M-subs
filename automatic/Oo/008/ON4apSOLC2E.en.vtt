00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:11.560
 hello, modest Flavors from the kitchen armful loves 

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:16.080
 we are used to doing more religious days in this section 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.680
 we have a nice donut recipe 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.280
 We're going to share the description of "Oil Lamp Prickly" 

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:24.280
 but let's take a look at the ingredients 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.160
 1 pack age yeast 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.160
 half a pack of butter (125 grams) 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.680
 2 eggs 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.320
 1 tea cup of warm water 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.320
 1 teacup of oil 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.040
 1 cup of yogurt 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.680
 1 teaspoon mahlep 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.440
 1 teaspoon salt 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.160
 and as much flour as possible 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.400
 For the above; 1 cup of sesame 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.960
 half cup powdered sugar 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.640
 half water cup water 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.520
 and 1 tablespoon of black cumin 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.880
 Now that we've learned the necessary materials for the oil lamp, 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:39.320
 we have 1 package (sold in 42 grams) 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:45.760
 add water on it and melt it with fingertips 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:57.120
 1 cup of tea on top ... 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:05.840
 and add the butter we soften at room temperature 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.040
 and a little more mixing 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.040
 we have 2 eggs for this recipe 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.600
 we use one completely 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.680
 we will use one white 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.280
 yellowish 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.640
 before mixing a little more salt ... 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.240
 and mahlep 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.800
 material must be in this description 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:44.160
 we're mixing with some more fingertips 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:51.440
 until we get a dough of medium hardness. 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.360
 we can start to knead by adding a little flour 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.160
 slowly became our dough 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.760
 This recipe is made by our modest Taste ... 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.760
 You can also find it on page 243. 

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:16.960
 our dough was just fine 

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:19.960
 now we'll cover it 

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:24.440
 and we'll take it to a warm place for at least 1 hour 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.440
 1 hour later 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.640
 it was dough of oil lamp 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.640
 let's open it 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.080
 We'll have some flour now 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:43.280
 and let it knead up and down 

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:49.360
 we tell you to remove 18 pieces in our book 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.040
 18 tracks 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.120
 18 pieces of cloth ready 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.440
 There are 2 methods of making pretzels 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:07.440
 first 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.440
 let's do it first 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.520
 this is not a method of giving good results 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:17.520
 very clear shape 

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:20.520
 combining two ends 

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:23.520
 The other method is also flattening before ... 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:29.440
 then we're expanding our fingers 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:33.040
 with this method the bagels become more uniform 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:36.040
 oil lamps don't get too big 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:39.040
 its enough for this diameter 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.400
 we also shaped our last face 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.000
 these pretzels should wait in the tray for half an hour 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
 we want to make half with sesame 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.320
 half water cups for hot water ... 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:01.640
 Add half a glass of powdered sugar 

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:05.080
 and mix until the sugar melts 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:10.120
 sugar melt 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:14.400
 sesame in the waiting period we will make bagels ... 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.400
 dip into this mix 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:26.320
 then we find thirst for a flat plate 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:32.800
 sugar can be used instead of molasses 

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:45.560
 the rest will be simple 

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:48.560
 so let's wait 15 minutes 

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:50.640
 then proceed to operations 

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:53.640
 15 minutes later 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:58.200
 We waited for 15 minutes, the bagels took the yeast 

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:01.200
 Let's prepare the others now 

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:05.320
 If you remember, we separated the egg yolk 

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:08.920
 First of all, the egg yolks on them 

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:21.920
 After the egg, we leave the black cumin on it. 

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:26.120
 black pepper panacea 

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:32.160
 You know from our Prophet's (sas) come from the learn 

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:42.120
 we have heated this intermediate furnace at 210 degrees 

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:46.000
 We are now baking and baking until golden brown 

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:49.840
 15 minutes later 

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:53.640
 candle-bags 

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:56.840
 we can serve now 

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:05.280
 Modest Flavors in this part of the kitchen ... 

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:07.880
 We shared the description of "Oil Lamp Prickly" 

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:12.520
 no more need to wait for blessed days to eat oil lamp 

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:16.080
 Try, remember us, goodbye ...
