00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
and as you can see I was parked going

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.310 
and as you can see I was parked going
through<00:00:30.119> microsoft<00:00:30.570> points<00:00:30.869> here<00:00:30.990> trying<00:00:31.289> to

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
through microsoft points here trying to

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.229 
through microsoft points here trying to
get<00:00:31.470> as<00:00:31.590> anything<00:00:31.980> I<00:00:32.250> could<00:00:32.489> I<00:00:32.640> started<00:00:33.149> off

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
get as anything I could I started off

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:34.639 
get as anything I could I started off
with<00:00:33.329> silver<00:00:33.660> packs<00:00:33.840> then<00:00:34.020> moved<00:00:34.200> on<00:00:34.350> to<00:00:34.380> gold

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
with silver packs then moved on to gold

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.229 
with silver packs then moved on to gold
ones<00:00:34.829> obviously<00:00:34.950> cuz<00:00:35.340> it<00:00:35.430> so<00:00:35.579> basically<00:00:35.760> full

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
ones obviously cuz it so basically full

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.389 
ones obviously cuz it so basically full
silver<00:00:36.930> and<00:00:37.140> a<00:00:37.230> bronze<00:00:37.260> a<00:00:37.649> team<00:00:37.890> of<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.190> week

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
silver and a bronze a team of the week

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:39.619 
silver and a bronze a team of the week
so<00:00:38.640> I<00:00:38.670> thought<00:00:38.910> maybe<00:00:39.000> if<00:00:39.270> I<00:00:39.360> could<00:00:39.510> put

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
so I thought maybe if I could put

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:40.760 
so I thought maybe if I could put
anything<00:00:39.809> and<00:00:40.050> there<00:00:40.140> was<00:00:40.230> no<00:00:40.410> team<00:00:40.590> of<00:00:40.710> the

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
anything and there was no team of the

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.650 
anything and there was no team of the
seasons<00:00:41.129> so<00:00:41.309> I<00:00:41.520> thought<00:00:42.000> perhaps<00:00:42.180> it's<00:00:42.510> still

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
seasons so I thought perhaps it's still

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:43.700 
seasons so I thought perhaps it's still
a<00:00:42.690> chance<00:00:42.960> because<00:00:43.110> I've<00:00:43.260> pulled<00:00:43.440> a<00:00:43.530> couple

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
a chance because I've pulled a couple

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.860 
a chance because I've pulled a couple
team<00:00:44.070> of<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.219> season<00:00:44.550> Silver's<00:00:44.969> in<00:00:45.360> a<00:00:45.600> gold

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
team of the season Silver's in a gold

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.150 
team of the season Silver's in a gold
pack<00:00:46.110> so<00:00:46.289> I<00:00:46.350> thought<00:00:46.530> I'll<00:00:46.680> end<00:00:46.860> up<00:00:46.980> just

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
pack so I thought I'll end up just

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.860 
pack so I thought I'll end up just
switching<00:00:47.520> to<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:47.700> gold<00:00:47.910> anyway<00:00:48.210> and<00:00:48.450> I<00:00:48.660> did

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
switching to the gold anyway and I did

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.600 
switching to the gold anyway and I did
actually<00:00:48.989> pull<00:00:49.379> some<00:00:49.590> all<00:00:49.800> right<00:00:50.070> players<00:00:50.399> now

the<00:01:55.290> things<00:01:55.500> stopping<00:01:55.890> like<00:01:56.009> HDMI<00:01:56.579> working<00:01:57.030> is

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
the things stopping like HDMI working is

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.840 
the things stopping like HDMI working is
the<00:01:57.360> hdmi<00:01:58.040> CP<00:01:59.040> I<00:01:59.280> believe<00:01:59.610> it's<00:01:59.790> called

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
the hdmi CP I believe it's called

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.209 
the hdmi CP I believe it's called
copyright<00:02:00.420> protection<00:02:00.899> maybe<00:02:01.110> CPI<00:02:01.560> something

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
copyright protection maybe CPI something

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:03.679 
copyright protection maybe CPI something
like<00:02:02.340> that<00:02:02.490> and<00:02:02.670> basically<00:02:03.060> it<00:02:03.360> stops<00:02:03.570> you

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
like that and basically it stops you

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:04.819 
like that and basically it stops you
from<00:02:03.719> being<00:02:03.869> able<00:02:04.140> to<00:02:04.259> use<00:02:04.350> certain<00:02:04.530> things

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
from being able to use certain things

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.830 
from being able to use certain things
like<00:02:05.009> recording<00:02:05.399> netflix<00:02:05.759> on<00:02:05.909> the<00:02:05.939> xbox<00:02:06.030> but

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
like recording netflix on the xbox but

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.540 
like recording netflix on the xbox but
the<00:02:07.020> thing<00:02:07.200> is<00:02:07.229> the<00:02:07.409> ps3<00:02:07.590> has<00:02:08.099> it<00:02:08.250> over

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
the thing is the ps3 has it over

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.729 
the thing is the ps3 has it over
everything<00:02:09.030> so<00:02:09.239> surely<00:02:09.599> as<00:02:09.750> long<00:02:10.200> as<00:02:10.319> the<00:02:10.410> xbox

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
everything so surely as long as the xbox

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.290 
everything so surely as long as the xbox
is<00:02:10.860> smart<00:02:11.160> enough<00:02:11.190> to<00:02:11.459> have<00:02:11.640> the<00:02:11.760> CP<00:02:12.180> or

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
is smart enough to have the CP or

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.490 
is smart enough to have the CP or
whatever<00:02:12.569> is<00:02:12.750> just

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
whatever is just

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.830 
whatever is just
