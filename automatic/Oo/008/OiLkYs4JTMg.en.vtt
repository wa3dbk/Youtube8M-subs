00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400 
okay here's my riddle I've just removed

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.330 
okay here's my riddle I've just removed
the<00:00:05.609> the<00:00:06.600> cupholder<00:00:07.140> play<00:00:07.319> is<00:00:08.040> really

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
the the cupholder play is really

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:09.049 
the the cupholder play is really
difficult

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
difficult

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.770 
difficult
I'd<00:00:09.240> start<00:00:09.630> this<00:00:10.620> in<00:00:10.830> first<00:00:11.300> because<00:00:12.300> if<00:00:12.660> you

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
I'd start this in first because if you

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.030 
I'd start this in first because if you
show<00:00:12.960> any<00:00:13.019> damage<00:00:13.380> to<00:00:13.440> this<00:00:13.500> end<00:00:13.710> it<00:00:13.799> will<00:00:13.889> show

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
show any damage to this end it will show

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.000 
show any damage to this end it will show
a<00:00:14.280> lot<00:00:14.940> easier<00:00:15.299> and<00:00:15.929> they<00:00:16.350> were<00:00:16.410> really<00:00:16.710> really

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
a lot easier and they were really really

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.420 
a lot easier and they were really really
tight<00:00:17.340> and<00:00:17.490> I<00:00:17.730> did<00:00:18.180> it<00:00:18.300> by<00:00:18.390> hand<00:00:18.949> but<00:00:19.949> I've

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
tight and I did it by hand but I've

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.900 
tight and I did it by hand but I've
knocked<00:00:20.670> my<00:00:20.880> finger<00:00:21.150> opening<00:00:21.510> in<00:00:21.720> the<00:00:21.810> process

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:22.910

and it all the whole thing will come on
dead<00:00:52.920> easy<00:00:54.559> as<00:00:55.559> those<00:00:55.739> what<00:00:56.010> cast<00:00:56.250> it<00:00:56.430> clips

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
dead easy as those what cast it clips

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:03.470 
dead easy as those what cast it clips
all<00:00:56.879> along<00:01:00.379> and<00:01:01.379> there<00:01:01.530> it<00:01:01.649> is<00:01:01.910> same<00:01:02.910> system<00:01:03.359> is

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
all along and there it is same system is

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.679 
all along and there it is same system is
the<00:01:03.600> front<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:04.229> top<00:01:04.439> screw<00:01:05.240> just<00:01:06.240> to<00:01:06.420> remove

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
the front the top screw just to remove

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:28.670 
the front the top screw just to remove
it<00:01:07.790> let's<00:01:08.790> just<00:01:08.909> quickly<00:01:09.180> do<00:01:09.420> that

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.960 

generative<00:01:29.680> is<00:01:29.860> a<00:01:29.890> bit<00:01:30.130> of<00:01:30.220> a<00:01:30.280> bonding<00:01:30.790> with

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:30.970 
generative is a bit of a bonding with

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:36.720 
generative is a bit of a bonding with
these<00:01:31.090> plates<00:01:31.450> onto<00:01:32.050> the<00:01:32.700> onto<00:01:33.700> the<00:01:33.880> panel<00:01:35.730> on

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:36.730 
these plates onto the onto the panel on

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:38.100 
these plates onto the onto the panel on
the<00:01:36.850> front<00:01:37.000> I<00:01:37.240> used<00:01:37.390> a<00:01:37.510> screwdriver<00:01:37.720> the

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.110 
the front I used a screwdriver the

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.350 
the front I used a screwdriver the
creases<00:01:38.550> are<00:01:39.550> really<00:01:39.790> going<00:01:39.940> to<00:01:40.000> make<00:01:40.150> much

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:40.360 
creases are really going to make much

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:48.080 
creases are really going to make much
difference<00:01:44.010> just<00:01:45.010> use<00:01:45.160> the<00:01:45.280> screw<00:01:45.520> off<00:01:45.880> is

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
difference just use the screw off is

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.570 
difference just use the screw off is
literally<00:01:49.090> 100<00:01:49.590> and<00:01:50.590> there<00:01:50.740> we<00:01:50.830> go<00:01:51.010> a<00:01:51.130> measly

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:51.580 
literally 100 and there we go a measly

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:56.160 
literally 100 and there we go a measly
magnet<00:01:52.210> which<00:01:52.990> is<00:01:53.020> going<00:01:53.260> to<00:01:53.320> go<00:01:53.470> soon<00:01:53.820> um<00:01:55.170> you

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170 
magnet which is going to go soon um you

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:57.270 
magnet which is going to go soon um you
can<00:01:56.320> get<00:01:56.440> the<00:01:56.500> light<00:01:56.650> in<00:01:56.860> there<00:01:56.980> but<00:01:57.160> that

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
can get the light in there but that

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:06.210 
can get the light in there but that
panel<00:01:59.100> is<00:02:00.100> the<00:02:00.250> outside<00:02:00.610> skin<00:02:03.060> that's<00:02:04.060> it
