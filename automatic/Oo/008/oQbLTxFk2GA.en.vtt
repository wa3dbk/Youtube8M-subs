count<00:03:01.989> it<00:03:02.140> out<00:03:03.569> now<00:03:04.569> position<00:03:05.200> and<00:03:05.709> hip<00:03:06.310> drop

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:11.430 

we<00:03:09.400> got<00:03:09.670> it<00:03:10.180> I<00:03:10.210> can<00:03:10.930> render<00:03:11.080> the<00:03:11.200> same

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
we got it I can render the same

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.140 
we got it I can render the same
everything<00:03:11.950> from<00:03:12.160> the<00:03:12.280> top<00:03:12.460> now<00:03:12.730> you<00:03:12.820> know<00:03:12.970> the

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
everything from the top now you know the

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.950 
everything from the top now you know the
moves<00:03:13.390> really<00:03:14.200> start<00:03:14.560> to<00:03:14.710> work<00:03:14.890> it

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:15.960 
moves really start to work it

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:18.980 
moves really start to work it
remember<00:03:16.960> protected<00:03:17.500> back<00:03:17.710> don't<00:03:18.160> bounce

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:18.990 
remember protected back don't bounce

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:27.710 
remember protected back don't bounce
how<00:03:19.990> about<00:03:20.140> front<00:03:20.470> back<00:03:20.650> back

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:33.220 

and<00:03:28.650> again<00:03:28.920> down<00:03:30.320> have<00:03:31.320> a<00:03:31.350> slight<00:03:31.740> lean<00:03:32.010> back

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
and again down have a slight lean back

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:36.860 
and again down have a slight lean back
let's<00:03:34.230> take<00:03:34.470> this<00:03:34.590> into<00:03:34.860> a<00:03:34.890> vertical<00:03:35.130> 8<00:03:35.870> so

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
let's take this into a vertical 8 so

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:42.150 
let's take this into a vertical 8 so
it's<00:03:38.720> side-side-side

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.160 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.800 

start<00:03:42.760> to<00:03:42.850> maneuver<00:03:43.150> yourself<00:03:43.270> to<00:03:43.630> the<00:03:43.720> other

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
start to maneuver yourself to the other

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:45.330 
start to maneuver yourself to the other
side<00:03:44.110> we're<00:03:44.320> at<00:03:44.410> another<00:03:44.500> hip<00:03:44.830> drops<00:03:45.100> on<00:03:45.250> the

side we're at another hip drops on the
other<00:03:45.460> side<00:03:45.760> count<00:03:46.510> it<00:03:46.660> out

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:49.830
