00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:09.050
 pleased that we are in 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:11.570
 this techno click delivery a small 

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:14.059
 chip in the eye can return the 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:16.910
 view of blind people we are talking 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:18.770
 of a device capable of returning the 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:21.320
 vision to patients suffering from blindness 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:23.960
 by degenerating the retina through 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.730
 of neuronal stimuli approximately 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.770
 about 6 million people worldwide 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.510
 suffer from blindness as a result of 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:31.010
 degeneration of the retina is a 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:34.280
 disease they suffer above all 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:37.160
 people over 60 years a company 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:39.020
 Israeli that is called bio retina started 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.180
 to develop that chip that is known 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:43.910
 as a nano retina because of how small it is 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:46.070
 it was in 2009 and after several years of 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.899
 research especially in mice already 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.430
 They are ready and that's the novelty and 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:51.710
 which we share in this installment 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.960
 of techno click because it's ready to 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.090
 be placed on human the chip 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.370
 miraculous they call it is the size of a 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:01.340
 rice grain is implanted in the retina 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:03.620
 and imitates its function by transmitting signals 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.730
 visuals through electrical impulses 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:08.330
 that stimulate neurons 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:10.530
 this will generate image in the brain 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.170
 unfortunately the chip does not work for 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.820
 those people who have suffered 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.680
 blindness getting another type of 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.910
 eye disease other than the one 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.100
 have to do with the retina the 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:22.530
 retinal degeneration the operation is 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.290
 very simple and can be achieved in less 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.330
 of half an hour have published the company 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:31.470
 bio retina which is a joint venture 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:33.420
 from essex la texas at usa raymond 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.250
 medical which is an Israeli company that 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.570
 Invests in innovation in the field of 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.670
 medical instruments and they have 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.530
 developed that concept that you 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.510
 they were watching on the screen and it's what 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.100
 that we have said in this week of how 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:47.430
 the technology is applied to various 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.590
 fields including medicine we saw the 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.600
 Pacemaker theme these days now 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.850
 we are seeing the subject of the retina in 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.400
 the eye and it is not discarded and it's a bit of 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.710
 technological futurology that in a few years 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.390
 we could have the bionic man that 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.990
 that has been seen in movies and that of 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:06.810
 somehow we can have that simile or 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.350
 organ development processes 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.030
 humans 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.610
 remember that we talked about 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.950
 I live printers printers that achieved 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.450
 print organs is to say that in a 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.300
 future not so far we will be 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.950
 printing heart liver kidneys and the 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:23.069
 life expectancy at birth is going to 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:26.100
 lengthen significantly looks strange 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:28.260
 It looks incredible but it is already possible with 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.569
 this type of issues that in each delivery 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.010
 of techno clip we deal with you 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:34.590
 linked to the development of 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.480
 technology in the field of medicine you 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.580
 we are going to send this video through 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.040
 our twitter account that is at 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.870

 continue reporting in this broadcast 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:52.970
 Stellar telenoticias to a
