00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
is really easy here's the map location

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.889 
is really easy here's the map location
in<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.090> central<00:00:30.480> expanse<00:00:30.949> and<00:00:32.510> what<00:00:33.510> I<00:00:33.540> do<00:00:33.660> is

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
in the central expanse and what I do is

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.799 
in the central expanse and what I do is
I<00:00:34.020> start<00:00:34.079> out<00:00:34.649> at<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:35.070> safe<00:00:36.030> station<00:00:36.600> over

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
I start out at the safe station over

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:43.040 
I start out at the safe station over
here<00:00:36.840> and<00:00:37.910> I'll<00:00:38.910> just<00:00:38.969> show<00:00:39.210> you<00:00:39.239> my<00:00:39.510> setup<00:00:42.050> you

disaster<00:00:52.320> and<00:00:52.469> that's<00:00:52.590> what<00:00:52.739> we're<00:00:52.920> gonna

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
disaster and that's what we're gonna

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.740 
disaster and that's what we're gonna
fill<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.520> these<00:00:54.449> chain<00:00:55.079> guys<00:00:55.320> up<00:00:55.590> with<00:00:56.750> rapid

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
fill the these chain guys up with rapid

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.080 
fill the these chain guys up with rapid
growth<00:00:58.050> which<00:00:58.559> you'll<00:00:58.800> use<00:00:58.829> to<00:00:59.100> just<00:00:59.910> put

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
growth which you'll use to just put

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.229 
growth which you'll use to just put
haste<00:01:00.359> on<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.989> entire<00:01:01.260> party<00:01:01.710> and

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239 
haste on the entire party and

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:05.719 
haste on the entire party and
infiltration<00:01:03.239> which<00:01:03.930> will<00:01:04.400> put<00:01:05.400> a<00:01:05.430> lot<00:01:05.580> of

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
infiltration which will put a lot of

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.730 
infiltration which will put a lot of
nice<00:01:06.119> status<00:01:06.600> ailments<00:01:07.229> on<00:01:07.350> them<00:01:07.500> to<00:01:07.619> make

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
nice status ailments on them to make

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:14.030 
nice status ailments on them to make
this<00:01:07.920> much<00:01:08.220> quicker<00:01:09.590> one<00:01:10.590> thing<00:01:12.770> real<00:01:13.770> quick

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
this much quicker one thing real quick

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.580 
this much quicker one thing real quick
is<00:01:14.220> with<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.640> this<00:01:15.630> method<00:01:16.140> is<00:01:16.350> I<00:01:16.740> think<00:01:17.220> the

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
is with the this method is I think the

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.649 
is with the this method is I think the
best<00:01:19.590> way<00:01:19.860> to<00:01:19.890> get<00:01:20.790> pretty<00:01:21.150> much<00:01:21.270> everything

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
best way to get pretty much everything

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:22.820 
best way to get pretty much everything
you<00:01:21.750> need<00:01:21.780> in<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.080> game<00:01:22.259> especially<00:01:22.409> if<00:01:22.770> you

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
you need in the game especially if you

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.100 
you need in the game especially if you
go<00:01:22.950> home<00:01:23.070> for<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.280> treasure<00:01:23.549> hunter<00:01:24.110> trophy

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
go home for the treasure hunter trophy

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.260 
go home for the treasure hunter trophy

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
you can see trap as a hedron's already

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.910 
you can see trap as a hedron's already
got<00:01:27.390> eight<00:01:27.509> of<00:01:27.689> them<00:01:27.810> so<00:01:28.020> it's<00:01:28.880> you<00:01:29.880> know<00:01:30.030> I

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
have to do that it's just gonna waste

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.429 
have to do that it's just gonna waste
kill<00:01:41.210> so<00:01:42.210> what<00:01:42.810> we're<00:01:42.899> gonna<00:01:42.990> do<00:01:43.200> we're<00:01:43.380> gonna

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
kill so what we're gonna do we're gonna

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:48.889 
kill so what we're gonna do we're gonna
start<00:01:43.920> out<00:01:44.130> with<00:01:46.460> rapid<00:01:47.460> growth<00:01:47.600> just<00:01:48.600> to<00:01:48.780> get

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
start out with rapid growth just to get

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.840 
start out with rapid growth just to get
haste<00:01:49.170> on<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:49.500> entire<00:01:49.770> party<00:01:50.189> so<00:01:50.610> we<00:01:50.700> don't

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
haste on the entire party so we don't

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.210 
haste on the entire party so we don't
have<00:01:50.939> to<00:01:51.060> use<00:01:51.180> any<00:01:51.360> shrouds<00:01:51.780> or<00:01:52.020> anything

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
have to use any shrouds or anything

00:01:53.220 --> 00:02:01.480 
have to use any shrouds or anything
and<00:01:54.220> we're<00:01:54.400> just<00:01:54.460> gonna<00:01:54.610> run<00:01:54.880> right<00:01:55.390> into

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.830 

so<00:02:02.490> again<00:02:02.670> first<00:02:02.970> thing<00:02:03.060> you<00:02:03.240> want<00:02:03.390> to<00:02:03.420> do<00:02:03.540> just

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
so again first thing you want to do just

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.260 
so again first thing you want to do just
make<00:02:04.260> sure<00:02:04.410> the<00:02:04.560> whole<00:02:04.710> party<00:02:05.190> has<00:02:05.370> haste<00:02:07.070> and

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:08.270 
make sure the whole party has haste and

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:10.910 
make sure the whole party has haste and
then<00:02:09.270> you<00:02:09.570> can<00:02:09.720> immediately<00:02:10.290> switch<00:02:10.619> over<00:02:10.890> to

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
then you can immediately switch over to

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.220 
then you can immediately switch over to
infiltration<00:02:11.640> just<00:02:12.000> to<00:02:12.090> get<00:02:12.240> that<00:02:12.420> ready<00:02:13.170> to

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
infiltration just to get that ready to

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:23.360 
infiltration just to get that ready to
go<00:02:13.350> and<00:02:14.300> then<00:02:15.300> we're<00:02:15.510> just<00:02:15.540> gonna<00:02:15.840> summon

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.039 

again<00:02:24.370> this<00:02:24.580> is<00:02:24.760> the<00:02:24.790> easy<00:02:25.090> method<00:02:25.599> of<00:02:25.629> taking

00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:26.049 
again this is the easy method of taking

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:40.340 
again this is the easy method of taking
a<00:02:26.110> man<00:02:26.260> you<00:02:27.209> meet<00:02:28.209> him<00:02:28.360> pretty<00:02:28.569> quickly

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.520 

so<00:02:41.350> now<00:02:41.500> what<00:02:41.650> we<00:02:41.710> want<00:02:41.890> to<00:02:41.980> do<00:02:42.100> is<00:02:42.280> just<00:02:42.490> get

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530

so once you got the chin gauge up to

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.640 
so once you got the chin gauge up to
about<00:03:42.550> 999<00:03:43.550> you<00:03:43.790> can<00:03:43.910> switch<00:03:44.209> to<00:03:44.239> Cerebrus<00:03:45.080> so

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650 
about 999 you can switch to Cerebrus so

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:49.339 
about 999 you can switch to Cerebrus so
though<00:03:45.770> all<00:03:45.980> these<00:03:46.190> commandos<00:03:46.700> have

and<00:03:50.349> this<00:03:51.129> is<00:03:51.310> gonna<00:03:51.489> beat<00:03:52.030> him<00:03:52.150> up<00:03:52.239> pretty

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.450 
and this is gonna beat him up pretty

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:53.250 
and this is gonna beat him up pretty
good

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260

00:07:27.319 --> 00:07:29.799 
them 20 times for each ultimate weapon 6
ultimate<00:07:27.800> weapons<00:07:28.159> so<00:07:28.490> that's<00:07:29.240> the<00:07:29.449> reason

00:07:29.799 --> 00:07:29.809 
ultimate weapons so that's the reason

00:07:29.809 --> 00:07:33.069 
ultimate weapons so that's the reason
why<00:07:29.959> this<00:07:30.019> easy<00:07:30.619> method<00:07:31.419> with<00:07:32.419> the<00:07:32.569> summon<00:07:32.959> is

00:07:33.069 --> 00:07:33.079 
why this easy method with the summon is
