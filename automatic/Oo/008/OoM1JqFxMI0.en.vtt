gigabyte radeon r9 270 and here she is
check<00:00:33.960> her<00:00:34.079> out<00:00:34.140> that's<00:00:34.469> a<00:00:34.590> thermaltake<00:00:34.980> core

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
check her out that's a thermaltake core

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:41.209 
check her out that's a thermaltake core
x9<00:00:36.120> case<00:00:36.450> it<00:00:37.290> is<00:00:37.710> freaking<00:00:38.129> gigantic<00:00:38.610> I<00:00:40.219> know

or for 120 but basically I rigged it up
a<00:01:57.869> little<00:01:58.020> bit<00:01:58.140> so<00:01:58.770> that<00:01:58.799> these<00:01:59.189> four<00:01:59.549> would

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
a little bit so that these four would

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.980 
a little bit so that these four would
fit<00:01:59.939> just<00:02:00.149> for<00:02:00.390> looks<00:02:02.240> yeah<00:02:03.240> these<00:02:03.450> are<00:02:03.509> the

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
fit just for looks yeah these are the

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.620 
fit just for looks yeah these are the
hydraulic<00:02:04.710> bearing<00:02:05.000> so<00:02:06.000> they're<00:02:06.149> extremely

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
hydraulic bearing so they're extremely

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.699 
hydraulic bearing so they're extremely
quiet<00:02:07.550> it<00:02:08.550> actually<00:02:08.910> puts<00:02:09.090> out<00:02:09.270> 73<00:02:10.110> point<00:02:10.349> 18

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
quiet it actually puts out 73 point 18

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:17.470 
quiet it actually puts out 73 point 18
CFM<00:02:11.370> and<00:02:11.879> it<00:02:12.180> only<00:02:12.270> puts<00:02:12.569> out<00:02:12.720> 80<00:02:13.200> decibels
