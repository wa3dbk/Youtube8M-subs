then I'll explain the glitch and how to

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.779 
then I'll explain the glitch and how to
build<00:00:19.050> one<00:00:19.140> of<00:00:19.260> these<00:00:19.320> for<00:00:19.560> yourself<00:00:19.650> so<00:00:20.430> what

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
build one of these for yourself so what

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.609 
build one of these for yourself so what
you're<00:00:20.939> gonna<00:00:21.029> want<00:00:21.300> to<00:00:21.330> do<00:00:21.539> is<00:00:21.750> toss<00:00:22.109> an<00:00:22.320> item

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
into this block like so and then pull

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.570 
into this block like so and then pull
this<00:00:25.109> lever<00:00:25.470> now<00:00:25.830> whenever<00:00:26.070> you<00:00:26.189> do<00:00:26.279> that<00:00:26.310> as

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
this lever now whenever you do that as

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.029 
this lever now whenever you do that as
you<00:00:26.730> can<00:00:26.849> tell<00:00:27.000> the<00:00:27.150> item<00:00:27.449> goes<00:00:27.599> sky-high<00:00:28.050> way

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
you can tell the item goes sky-high way

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.070 
you can tell the item goes sky-high way
way<00:00:29.429> up<00:00:29.640> there<00:00:29.910> and<00:00:30.090> then<00:00:30.420> you<00:00:30.510> can<00:00:30.660> pick<00:00:30.869> it<00:00:30.900> up

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
items from a really low place to a

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.000 
items from a really low place to a
really<00:00:39.420> high<00:00:39.570> place<00:00:39.870> now<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:40.440> way<00:00:40.739> that<00:00:40.920> this

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
really high place now the way that this

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.889 
really high place now the way that this
works<00:00:41.280> is<00:00:41.460> this<00:00:41.550> is<00:00:41.610> actually<00:00:41.910> a<00:00:42.180> glitch<00:00:42.660> in

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
works is this is actually a glitch in

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.810 
works is this is actually a glitch in
which<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.469> item<00:00:43.890> is<00:00:44.040> trying<00:00:44.309> to<00:00:44.399> find<00:00:44.640> the

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
which the item is trying to find the

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.029 
which the item is trying to find the
nearest<00:00:45.149> way<00:00:45.570> out<00:00:45.870> of<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.170> blocks<00:00:46.469> if<00:00:46.920> you

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
nearest way out of the blocks if you

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.430 
nearest way out of the blocks if you
were<00:00:47.129> to<00:00:47.250> surround<00:00:47.610> it<00:00:47.730> by<00:00:47.910> blocks<00:00:48.300> what<00:00:49.289> it's

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
were to surround it by blocks what it's

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.380 
were to surround it by blocks what it's
actually<00:00:49.530> doing<00:00:49.770> is<00:00:50.280> it<00:00:50.430> slipping<00:00:50.910> in<00:00:51.090> between

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
actually doing is it slipping in between

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.330 
actually doing is it slipping in between
the<00:00:51.510> barriers<00:00:51.930> and<00:00:52.140> trying<00:00:52.620> to<00:00:52.770> get<00:00:52.920> out<00:00:53.100> it's

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
the barriers and trying to get out it's

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.130 
the barriers and trying to get out it's
trying<00:00:53.550> to<00:00:53.640> get<00:00:53.760> anywhere<00:00:54.480> that<00:00:54.690> it<00:00:54.809> can<00:00:54.960> go

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
trying to get anywhere that it can go

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.260 
trying to get anywhere that it can go
where<00:00:55.590> it's<00:00:55.739> not<00:00:55.949> inside<00:00:56.460> of<00:00:56.640> a<00:00:56.699> block<00:00:56.969> and

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
where it's not inside of a block and

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.420 
where it's not inside of a block and
that's<00:00:57.840> how<00:00:58.050> this<00:00:58.199> thing<00:00:58.260> actually<00:00:58.559> works<00:00:58.949> so

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
that's how this thing actually works so

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.590 
that's how this thing actually works so
I'm<00:00:59.730> gonna<00:00:59.850> show<00:01:00.000> you<00:01:00.030> guys<00:01:00.180> how<00:01:00.270> you<00:01:00.390> can

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
I'm gonna show you guys how you can

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:01.790 
I'm gonna show you guys how you can
quickly<00:01:00.750> make<00:01:01.109> one<00:01:01.289> which<00:01:01.440> it's<00:01:01.620> not

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
quickly make one which it's not

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.139 
quickly make one which it's not
complicated<00:01:02.399> you<00:01:02.520> can<00:01:02.670> see<00:01:02.820> just<00:01:02.969> by<00:01:03.059> looking

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
complicated you can see just by looking

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.000 
complicated you can see just by looking
at<00:01:03.539> it<00:01:03.690> but<00:01:03.899> what<00:01:04.290> you're<00:01:04.379> gonna<00:01:04.500> want<00:01:04.739> to<00:01:04.860> do

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
is go ahead and put two Pistons just

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.780 
is go ahead and put two Pistons just
like<00:01:06.990> this<00:01:07.170> then<00:01:07.799> two<00:01:08.159> pieces<00:01:08.490> of<00:01:08.520> redstone

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
like this then two pieces of redstone

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.149 
like this then two pieces of redstone
and<00:01:09.270> then<00:01:09.720> a<00:01:09.900> lever<00:01:10.260> and<00:01:10.530> you<00:01:10.590> don't<00:01:10.890> have<00:01:11.010> to

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
and then a lever and you don't have to

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.530 
and then a lever and you don't have to
use<00:01:11.280> glass<00:01:11.520> you<00:01:11.700> can<00:01:11.820> use<00:01:11.880> whatever<00:01:12.150> you<00:01:12.299> want

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
have one two three then on this side

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.960 
have one two three then on this side
you're<00:01:22.080> gonna<00:01:22.170> have<00:01:22.290> one<00:01:22.470> two<00:01:23.009> three<00:01:23.280> and

but you can make this thing as

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.050 
but you can make this thing as
absolutely<00:01:40.770> as<00:01:40.979> big<00:01:41.159> as<00:01:41.250> you<00:01:41.369> want<00:01:41.549> you<00:01:41.700> go<00:01:41.820> all

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
absolutely as big as you want you go all

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.910 
absolutely as big as you want you go all
the<00:01:42.180> way<00:01:42.270> to<00:01:42.329> the<00:01:42.479> sky<00:01:42.689> barrier<00:01:43.079> you<00:01:43.530> can<00:01:43.710> do

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
the way to the sky barrier you can do

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.440 
the way to the sky barrier you can do
some<00:01:44.070> really<00:01:44.460> crazy<00:01:44.610> stuff<00:01:44.790> with<00:01:45.119> this<00:01:45.270> I

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
some really crazy stuff with this I

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.510 
some really crazy stuff with this I
think<00:01:45.689> you<00:01:45.750> could<00:01:45.899> even<00:01:46.020> maybe<00:01:46.409> do<00:01:47.189> this<00:01:47.340> like

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
think you could even maybe do this like

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.980 
think you could even maybe do this like
in<00:01:47.640> weird<00:01:47.880> direction<00:01:48.090> and<00:01:48.570> stuff<00:01:48.689> like<00:01:48.810> that

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
in weird direction and stuff like that

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.440 
in weird direction and stuff like that
too<00:01:49.170> but<00:01:49.740> for<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.369> purpose<00:01:50.729> of<00:01:50.880> this<00:01:51.090> this<00:01:51.390> is

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
too but for the purpose of this this is

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.630 
too but for the purpose of this this is
just<00:01:51.869> a<00:01:52.020> straight<00:01:52.320> up<00:01:52.560> and<00:01:52.770> down<00:01:52.799> elevator<00:01:53.100> and

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
just a straight up and down elevator and

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:54.950 
just a straight up and down elevator and
whenever<00:01:53.759> I<00:01:53.909> pull<00:01:54.329> this<00:01:54.450> lever<00:01:54.509> right<00:01:54.810> here

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
whenever I pull this lever right here

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.690 
whenever I pull this lever right here
