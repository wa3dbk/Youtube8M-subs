00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
just seeing if there's any instructions

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.869 
just seeing if there's any instructions
before<00:00:38.550> I<00:00:38.730> start<00:00:39.120> no<00:00:39.600> I<00:00:40.170> haven't<00:00:41.010> put<00:00:41.370> a<00:00:41.399> skin

before I start no I haven't put a skin
on<00:00:42.149> my<00:00:43.219> nano<00:00:44.219> before<00:00:44.700> so<00:00:45.510> I'm<00:00:45.600> a<00:00:45.629> little<00:00:46.350> bit

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
on my nano before so I'm a little bit

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.260 
on my nano before so I'm a little bit
worried<00:00:46.890> about<00:00:47.160> it<00:00:47.550> um<00:00:49.489> but<00:00:50.489> let's<00:00:50.760> just<00:00:50.879> go

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
worried about it um but let's just go

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.979 
worried about it um but let's just go
for<00:00:51.510> it<00:00:51.570> can't<00:00:51.960> be<00:00:52.079> that<00:00:52.110> hard<00:00:52.500> can<00:00:52.920> it<00:00:52.949> really

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:53.989 
for it can't be that hard can it really

00:00:53.989 --> 00:01:00.650 
for it can't be that hard can it really
site<00:00:58.129> and<00:00:59.129> I'm<00:00:59.370> not<00:00:59.550> sure<00:00:59.820> I've<00:01:00.120> not<00:01:00.300> put<00:01:00.510> one

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
site and I'm not sure I've not put one

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.000 
site and I'm not sure I've not put one
of<00:01:00.780> these<00:01:00.870> on<00:01:00.930> before<00:01:01.350> so<00:01:01.710> I'm<00:01:01.800> not<00:01:01.949> sure

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
of these on before so I'm not sure

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.000 
of these on before so I'm not sure
whether<00:01:02.370> they<00:01:02.520> just<00:01:02.940> meet<00:01:03.239> totally<00:01:04.140> you<00:01:04.860> know

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
whether they just meet totally you know

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.530 
whether they just meet totally you know
one<00:01:05.339> edge<00:01:05.489> to<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:05.880> other<00:01:05.909> edge<00:01:06.210> so<00:01:06.420> it's

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
one edge to the other edge so it's

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.359 
one edge to the other edge so it's
really<00:01:06.840> important<00:01:07.439> I<00:01:07.530> would<00:01:07.650> imagine<00:01:08.070> that

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
really important I would imagine that

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.940 
really important I would imagine that
you<00:01:08.640> get<00:01:08.820> it<00:01:08.970> perfect<00:01:12.170> which<00:01:13.170> doesn't<00:01:13.680> bode

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
you get it perfect which doesn't bode

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:38.149 
you get it perfect which doesn't bode
well<00:01:13.979> for<00:01:14.310> me<00:01:14.700> then

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:47.730 

that<00:01:39.159> is<00:01:39.400> looking<00:01:39.880> fairly<00:01:40.420> good<00:01:46.440> they<00:01:47.440> want<00:01:47.680> to

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740 
that is looking fairly good they want to

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.010 
that is looking fairly good they want to
go<00:01:47.890> too<00:01:47.950> much<00:01:48.430> further<00:01:48.820> until<00:01:49.479> I've<00:01:49.659> looked<00:01:49.899> a

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
go too much further until I've looked a

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.070 
go too much further until I've looked a
bit<00:01:50.050> further<00:01:50.380> right<00:01:51.060> so<00:01:52.060> there's<00:01:52.810> nothing

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.080 
bit further right so there's nothing

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.960 
bit further right so there's nothing
showing<00:01:53.950> around<00:01:54.280> the<00:01:54.759> screen<00:01:55.259> there's<00:01:56.259> a<00:01:56.470> tiny

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:56.970 
showing around the screen there's a tiny

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.080 
showing around the screen there's a tiny
sliver<00:01:57.970> of<00:01:58.299> road<00:01:58.750> up<00:01:59.020> here<00:01:59.080> and<00:01:59.799> a<00:02:00.549> little<00:02:00.790> bit

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
sliver of road up here and a little bit

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.930 
sliver of road up here and a little bit
bigger<00:02:01.390> sliver<00:02:01.840> of<00:02:01.990> red<00:02:02.399> but<00:02:03.399> it's<00:02:03.580> fairly

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:03.940 
bigger sliver of red but it's fairly

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.570 
bigger sliver of red but it's fairly
even<00:02:04.539> all<00:02:04.690> around<00:02:04.960> sighs<00:02:05.410> I'm<00:02:05.830> just<00:02:06.220> going<00:02:06.490> to

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:06.580 
even all around sighs I'm just going to

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:22.650 
even all around sighs I'm just going to
go<00:02:06.880> for<00:02:07.869> it<00:02:08.880> just<00:02:10.890> do<00:02:11.890> it

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.690 

it's<00:02:23.410> quiet

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
it's quiet

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.930 
it's quiet
hard<00:02:26.390> to<00:02:26.780> know<00:02:26.810> that<00:02:27.230> you're<00:02:27.349> pressing<00:02:27.830> it<00:02:28.760> all

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
hard to know that you're pressing it all

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:38.229 
hard to know that you're pressing it all
around<00:02:29.270> properly<00:02:33.069> okay<00:02:34.989> so<00:02:35.989> that's<00:02:36.890> the<00:02:37.819> front

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:38.239 
around properly okay so that's the front

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:44.589 
around properly okay so that's the front
and<00:02:38.540> a<00:02:38.629> little<00:02:39.019> bit<00:02:39.170> done<00:02:43.150> he's<00:02:44.150> supposed<00:02:44.480> to

and a little bit done he's supposed to

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:46.330 
and a little bit done he's supposed to
do<00:02:44.810> that<00:02:44.989> way<00:02:45.230> but<00:02:45.290> work<00:02:46.010> quite<00:02:46.310> well

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340

quite<00:02:49.340> a<00:02:49.400> bit<00:02:49.550> of<00:02:50.120> overlap<00:02:50.660> here<00:02:52.390> say<00:02:55.239> the<00:02:56.239> join

00:02:56.619 --> 00:02:56.629 
quite a bit of overlap here say the join

00:02:56.629 --> 00:02:59.710 
quite a bit of overlap here say the join
is<00:02:57.110> just<00:02:57.890> on<00:02:58.280> this<00:02:58.489> edge<00:02:58.760> here<00:02:58.790> I'm<00:02:59.239> running<00:02:59.599> my

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.000 
finger up the join there and that's gone
in<00:03:02.510> quite<00:03:02.720> a<00:03:02.750> nice<00:03:02.900> nothing<00:03:03.140> that<00:03:03.500> looks<00:03:03.650> quite

bit<00:03:44.810> on<00:03:44.959> a<00:03:47.170> picture<00:03:48.170> to

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.979 

should<00:03:56.069> I<00:03:56.220> have<00:03:56.340> left<00:03:56.550> that<00:03:56.760> little<00:03:56.940> Ramon<00:03:57.540> no

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 
should I have left that little Ramon no

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:02.270 
should I have left that little Ramon no
probably<00:03:58.379> not<00:03:58.560> this<00:03:59.340> is<00:03:59.610> line<00:04:00.299> up<00:04:00.330> a<00:04:01.280> little

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
probably not this is line up a little

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.690 
probably not this is line up a little
gap<00:04:02.640> now<00:04:03.890> think<00:04:04.890> I<00:04:05.040> should<00:04:05.250> have<00:04:05.370> left<00:04:05.580> that

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
gap now think I should have left that

00:04:05.700 --> 00:05:16.910 
gap now think I should have left that
whole<00:04:06.030> thing<00:04:06.360> on<00:04:06.480> and<00:04:06.659> just<00:04:06.840> done<00:04:07.049> it<00:04:07.170> as<00:04:07.290> warm

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:16.920 

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:21.900 

so<00:05:17.920> there<00:05:18.160> we<00:05:18.340> go<00:05:18.370> guys<00:05:19.980> exploding<00:05:20.980> dog<00:05:21.310> is<00:05:21.580> on

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:21.910 
so there we go guys exploding dog is on

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:25.260 
so there we go guys exploding dog is on
I'm<00:05:22.690> sort<00:05:23.320> of<00:05:23.500> debating<00:05:24.250> whether<00:05:25.000> i<00:05:25.120> should

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:25.270 
I'm sort of debating whether i should

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:27.480 
I'm sort of debating whether i should
have<00:05:25.600> left<00:05:25.840> the<00:05:26.050> two<00:05:26.260> little<00:05:26.500> circles<00:05:26.950> that

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:27.490 
have left the two little circles that

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:33.390 
have left the two little circles that
are<00:05:27.550> now<00:05:28.680> on<00:05:29.680> here<00:05:32.010> whether<00:05:33.010> i<00:05:33.130> should<00:05:33.220> have

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:33.400 
are now on here whether i should have

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:36.600 
are now on here whether i should have
left<00:05:33.580> these<00:05:33.820> circles<00:05:35.010> then<00:05:36.010> just<00:05:36.280> put<00:05:36.520> the

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:36.610 
left these circles then just put the

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:39.510 
left these circles then just put the
whole<00:05:36.820> thing<00:05:36.850> on<00:05:37.300> as<00:05:37.690> one<00:05:38.110> be<00:05:38.830> so<00:05:39.190> nice<00:05:39.490> if

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:39.520 
whole thing on as one be so nice if

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:42.180 
whole thing on as one be so nice if
someone<00:05:39.940> could<00:05:40.210> tell<00:05:40.420> me<00:05:40.480> that<00:05:40.750> but<00:05:41.470> I<00:05:41.650> really

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:42.190 
someone could tell me that but I really

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:44.790 
someone could tell me that but I really
like<00:05:42.370> it<00:05:42.700> I<00:05:42.910> think<00:05:43.570> the<00:05:43.690> robot<00:05:44.170> on<00:05:44.290> the<00:05:44.410> back<00:05:44.620> is

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:44.800 
like it I think the robot on the back is

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:48.510 
like it I think the robot on the back is
really<00:05:45.130> cool<00:05:45.610> I<00:05:45.670> love<00:05:46.120> him<00:05:46.740> and<00:05:47.740> the<00:05:48.220> little

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:48.520 
really cool I love him and the little

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:50.400 
really cool I love him and the little
dog<00:05:48.670> yapping<00:05:48.970> at<00:05:49.210> him<00:05:49.390> I<00:05:49.570> quite<00:05:49.900> like<00:05:50.080> the<00:05:50.230> fact

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:50.410 
dog yapping at him I quite like the fact

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:52.280 
dog yapping at him I quite like the fact
it<00:05:50.620> looks<00:05:50.800> like<00:05:51.010> two<00:05:51.310> totally<00:05:51.970> different

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:52.290 
it looks like two totally different

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:55.500 
it looks like two totally different
covers<00:05:53.760> because<00:05:54.760> you<00:05:55.030> don't<00:05:55.210> know<00:05:55.330> what's

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:55.510 
covers because you don't know what's

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:57.060 
covers because you don't know what's
going<00:05:55.750> to<00:05:55.810> be<00:05:55.960> on<00:05:56.050> the<00:05:56.110> back<00:05:56.230> until<00:05:56.410> you<00:05:56.680> turn

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:57.070 
going to be on the back until you turn

00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:00.390 
going to be on the back until you turn
it<00:05:57.250> over<00:05:57.400> this<00:05:58.330> seam<00:05:58.810> here<00:05:59.260> is<00:05:59.470> an<00:05:59.710> annoying<00:06:00.010> at

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:00.400 
it over this seam here is an annoying at

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:04.260 
it over this seam here is an annoying at
all<00:06:00.430> you<00:06:00.880> really<00:06:01.390> don't<00:06:01.660> feel<00:06:02.050> it<00:06:02.910> and<00:06:03.910> it<00:06:04.090> goes

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:04.270 
all you really don't feel it and it goes

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:07.500 
all you really don't feel it and it goes
right<00:06:04.630> up<00:06:04.930> to<00:06:04.960> the<00:06:05.290> edge<00:06:06.180> so<00:06:07.180> you'll<00:06:07.330> have<00:06:07.480> a

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:07.510 
right up to the edge so you'll have a

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:11.990 
right up to the edge so you'll have a
good<00:06:07.810> cover<00:06:08.110> it<00:06:08.380> is<00:06:08.560> just<00:06:09.100> a<00:06:09.340> tad<00:06:09.820> short<00:06:10.300> here

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:12.000 
good cover it is just a tad short here

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.510 
good cover it is just a tad short here
but<00:06:13.000> I'm<00:06:13.450> really<00:06:14.350> really<00:06:14.590> like<00:06:14.920> this<00:06:14.950> I'd<00:06:15.250> love

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:15.520 
but I'm really really like this I'd love

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:17.400 
but I'm really really like this I'd love
to<00:06:15.670> get<00:06:15.790> a<00:06:15.850> couple<00:06:16.150> more<00:06:16.300> design<00:06:16.780> someone<00:06:17.230> no

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:17.410 
to get a couple more design someone no

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:20.130 
to get a couple more design someone no
no<00:06:17.560> actually<00:06:18.010> and<00:06:18.880> just<00:06:19.210> have<00:06:19.810> a<00:06:19.840> few

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:20.140 
no actually and just have a few

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:21.960 
no actually and just have a few
different<00:06:20.530> ones<00:06:20.620> I<00:06:20.800> like<00:06:21.040> the<00:06:21.070> red<00:06:21.490> I<00:06:21.520> picked

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:21.970 
different ones I like the red I picked

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:24.950 
different ones I like the red I picked
the<00:06:22.120> red<00:06:22.330> because<00:06:23.260> I<00:06:23.410> think<00:06:23.470> it<00:06:23.740> looks<00:06:23.920> great

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:24.960 
the red because I think it looks great

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:27.930 
the red because I think it looks great
and<00:06:25.960> will<00:06:26.320> match<00:06:26.560> my<00:06:26.590> red<00:06:27.160> iphone<00:06:27.340> it<00:06:27.730> means

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:27.940 
and will match my red iphone it means

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:31.640 
and will match my red iphone it means
that's<00:06:28.180> not<00:06:28.390> too<00:06:28.660> obvious<00:06:29.110> so<00:06:30.030> definitely<00:06:31.030> go

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:31.650 
that's not too obvious so definitely go

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:35.130 
that's not too obvious so definitely go
to<00:06:32.650> music<00:06:33.160> skins<00:06:33.760> they've<00:06:34.090> got<00:06:34.360> tons<00:06:34.750> of

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:35.140 
to music skins they've got tons of

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:37.770 
to music skins they've got tons of
designs<00:06:35.560> not<00:06:35.890> just<00:06:36.160> for<00:06:36.310> the<00:06:36.430> nano<00:06:36.670> 4g<00:06:37.360> but<00:06:37.600> for

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:37.780 
designs not just for the nano 4g but for

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:39.990 
designs not just for the nano 4g but for
everything<00:06:38.140> you<00:06:38.410> can<00:06:38.590> think<00:06:38.620> of<00:06:39.130> and<00:06:39.340> lots<00:06:39.790> and

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:40.000 
everything you can think of and lots and

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.870 
everything you can think of and lots and
lots<00:06:40.120> of<00:06:40.420> different<00:06:40.840> designs<00:06:41.340> so<00:06:42.340> go<00:06:42.700> and

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:42.880 
lots of different designs so go and

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:45.630 
lots of different designs so go and
check<00:06:42.970> them<00:06:43.330> out<00:06:43.740> and<00:06:44.740> i'm<00:06:44.920> really<00:06:45.190> impressed

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:45.640 
check them out and i'm really impressed

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:48.230 
check them out and i'm really impressed
with<00:06:45.910> this<00:06:46.060> it<00:06:46.420> was<00:06:46.540> really<00:06:47.080> easy<00:06:47.230> to<00:06:47.830> put<00:06:48.190> on

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:48.240 
with this it was really easy to put on

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:50.850 
with this it was really easy to put on
you<00:06:49.240> know<00:06:49.360> if<00:06:49.510> I<00:06:49.660> can<00:06:49.960> put<00:06:50.140> on<00:06:50.260> this<00:06:50.410> skin<00:06:50.680> like

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:50.860

that then anyone can i am the i set the

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:56.940 
that then anyone can i am the i set the

baseline for putting on skins to be

00:06:56.950 --> 00:07:01.380 
baseline for putting on skins to be
honest<00:06:57.270> so<00:06:59.250> definitely<00:07:00.250> check<00:07:00.340> them<00:07:00.790> out<00:07:00.940> try

anyone who's in the know let me know
about<00:07:05.070> the<00:07:05.370> little<00:07:05.490> circles<00:07:06.150> on<00:07:06.330> whether<00:07:06.510> i

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:06.600 
about the little circles on whether i

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:08.560 
about the little circles on whether i
should<00:07:06.720> have<00:07:06.960> just<00:07:06.990> put<00:07:07.350> it<00:07:07.470> on<00:07:07.590> all<00:07:07.889> as<00:07:08.190> one

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:08.570 
should have just put it on all as one

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:11.570
