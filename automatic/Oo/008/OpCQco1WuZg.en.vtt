00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:39.770 
notes four with the hands two with the
feet<00:01:29.670> and<00:01:35.840> then<00:01:37.460> he<00:01:38.460> just<00:01:38.640> puts<00:01:39.329> that<00:01:39.450> over<00:01:39.689> the

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
feet and then he just puts that over the

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.950 
feet and then he just puts that over the
Tom's<00:01:40.020> he's<00:01:40.409> doing<00:01:40.740> like<00:01:40.890> a<00:01:41.509> one<00:01:42.509> note<00:01:42.659> on<00:01:42.720> the

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
Tom's he's doing like a one note on the

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:43.520 
Tom's he's doing like a one note on the
snare

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
snare

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.819 
snare
one<00:01:44.369> on<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.640> rack<00:01:44.869> two<00:01:45.869> on<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.110> floor<00:01:46.290> tom<00:01:46.530> and

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
one on the rack two on the floor tom and

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:58.330 
one on the rack two on the floor tom and
then<00:01:47.670> two<00:01:47.820> of<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:48.000> bass<00:01:48.149> drums<00:01:48.420> so<00:01:48.630> it's

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:07.580 

so<00:01:59.340> he<00:01:59.430> does<00:01:59.550> that<00:01:59.580> four<00:01:59.880> times<00:02:06.290> so<00:02:07.290> that's<00:02:07.380> the

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
so he does that four times so that's the

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:13.370 
so he does that four times so that's the
very<00:02:07.830> very<00:02:08.069> opening<00:02:08.550> of<00:02:08.700> that<00:02:09.119> lick<00:02:12.380> second

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
very very opening of that lick second

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.540 
very very opening of that lick second
half<00:02:13.620> goes<00:02:13.950> like<00:02:14.250> this<00:02:15.739> it's<00:02:16.739> just<00:02:16.950> two<00:02:17.220> notes

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
half goes like this it's just two notes

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.800 
half goes like this it's just two notes
with<00:02:17.819> the<00:02:17.910> hands<00:02:18.300> and<00:02:19.290> two<00:02:19.590> of<00:02:19.709> the<00:02:19.800> feet

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
with the hands and two of the feet

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:28.310 
with the hands and two of the feet
does<00:02:21.810> it<00:02:21.989> three<00:02:22.170> times<00:02:25.910> and<00:02:26.910> then<00:02:26.989> he<00:02:27.989> finishes

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
does it three times and then he finishes

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.590 
does it three times and then he finishes
it<00:02:28.530> off<00:02:28.730> with<00:02:29.730> the<00:02:29.910> same<00:02:30.090> thing<00:02:30.330> we<00:02:30.420> did<00:02:30.570> before

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600
