default<00:00:29.270> you<00:00:29.480> have<00:00:29.630> a<00:00:29.660> task<00:00:30.050> bar<00:00:30.410> usually<00:00:30.619> most

00:00:30.909 --> 00:00:30.919 
default you have a task bar usually most

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:32.589

people<00:00:31.009> have<00:00:31.369> that<00:00:31.579> at<00:00:31.700> the<00:00:31.759> bottom<00:00:32.119> but<00:00:32.419> did

00:00:32.589 --> 00:00:32.599 
people have that at the bottom but did

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:34.690 
people have that at the bottom but did
you<00:00:32.689> know<00:00:32.870> that<00:00:32.899> you<00:00:33.200> can<00:00:33.350> have<00:00:33.700> multiple

you know that you can have multiple
application<00:00:35.570> bars<00:00:35.809> I<00:00:36.050> thought<00:00:36.500> this<00:00:36.649> was<00:00:36.800> only

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:37.070 
application bars I thought this was only

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.190 
application bars I thought this was only
something<00:00:37.250> you<00:00:37.460> could<00:00:37.640> do<00:00:37.760> in<00:00:37.910> Linux<00:00:38.239> but

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:39.200 
something you could do in Linux but

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.600 
something you could do in Linux but
evidently<00:00:39.469> you<00:00:39.649> can<00:00:39.860> do<00:00:39.950> it<00:00:40.070> in<00:00:40.160> windows<00:00:40.309> too

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:40.610 
evidently you can do it in windows too

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:42.369 
evidently you can do it in windows too
and<00:00:40.730> I'll<00:00:40.789> show<00:00:40.910> you<00:00:40.940> how<00:00:41.059> to<00:00:41.120> do<00:00:41.300> it<00:00:41.329> the<00:00:42.170> first

and do view large icons and then I'm
going<00:01:45.890> to<00:01:46.240> size<00:01:47.240> it<00:01:47.480> up<00:01:47.860> and<00:01:48.910> that's<00:01:49.910> it

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:51.040 
going to size it up and that's it

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:52.990 
going to size it up and that's it
unfortunately<00:01:52.040> it<00:01:52.130> does<00:01:52.280> not<00:01:52.400> follow<00:01:52.670> the

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
unfortunately it does not follow the

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.240 
unfortunately it does not follow the
theme<00:01:53.360> so<00:01:53.990> I<00:01:54.020> have<00:01:54.260> the<00:01:54.410> zoom<00:01:54.740> think<00:01:55.010> it's

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 
theme so I have the zoom think it's

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:56.800 
theme so I have the zoom think it's

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:27.320 
there's another way of doing this which

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:28.690 
there's another way of doing this which
is<00:02:27.410> a<00:02:27.440> little<00:02:27.650> tricky<00:02:27.920> but<00:02:28.280> it<00:02:28.340> can<00:02:28.550> be<00:02:28.670> done

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
is a little tricky but it can be done

let me just close this first what you

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:34.930 
let me just close this first what you
can<00:02:33.470> do<00:02:33.620> is<00:02:33.860> that<00:02:34.040> you<00:02:34.160> can<00:02:34.280> actually<00:02:34.310> take<00:02:34.700> any

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
can do is that you can actually take any

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.890 
can do is that you can actually take any
folder<00:02:35.570> that<00:02:36.050> is<00:02:36.080> on<00:02:36.500> the<00:02:36.890> desktop<00:02:37.190> and<00:02:37.900> make

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
folder that is on the desktop and make

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.340 
folder that is on the desktop and make
it<00:02:39.020> into<00:02:39.200> a<00:02:39.410> toolbar<00:02:40.130> for<00:02:41.000> example<00:02:41.360> I<00:02:41.450> have<00:02:41.480> one

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350

forgot to mention that these are

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:19.660 
forgot to mention that these are
stackable<00:06:15.100> so<00:06:16.100> if<00:06:16.490> I<00:06:16.790> do<00:06:17.320> test<00:06:18.320> folder<00:06:18.620> do<00:06:19.460> that

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:19.670 
stackable so if I do test folder do that

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:24.250 
stackable so if I do test folder do that
and<00:06:21.760> let<00:06:22.760> me<00:06:22.850> just<00:06:22.880> drag<00:06:23.240> this<00:06:23.420> one<00:06:23.660> to<00:06:24.140> the
