Classic<00:00:07.089> Collection<00:00:07.260> it's<00:00:08.260> pretty<00:00:08.740> easy<00:00:08.980> but

00:00:09.539 --> 00:00:09.549 
Classic Collection it's pretty easy but

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:19.350 
Classic Collection it's pretty easy but
it<00:00:09.900> will<00:00:10.900> require<00:00:11.559> a<00:00:11.830> few<00:00:12.129> things<00:00:17.220> okay<00:00:18.360> all

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:19.360 
it will require a few things okay all

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:29.710 
it will require a few things okay all
right<00:00:19.540> that<00:00:19.840> was<00:00:19.930> it<00:00:20.050> okay

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:29.720 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.860 

so<00:00:31.189> normally<00:00:32.189> this<00:00:32.460> is<00:00:32.700> impossible<00:00:33.090> during

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
so normally this is impossible during

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.410 
so normally this is impossible during
like<00:00:34.590> when<00:00:34.890> I<00:00:36.020> might<00:00:37.020> have<00:00:37.110> got<00:00:37.940> okay<00:00:38.940> normally

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
like when I might have got okay normally

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.710 
like when I might have got okay normally
this<00:00:40.020> isn't<00:00:40.350> possible<00:00:40.710> because<00:00:41.420> the<00:00:42.420> so<00:00:42.629> I

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:42.720 
this isn't possible because the so I

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.960 
this isn't possible because the so I
knew<00:00:43.020> like<00:00:43.470> the<00:00:43.650> start<00:00:43.920> button<00:00:44.100> is<00:00:44.430> disabled

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:44.970 
knew like the start button is disabled

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:49.460 
knew like the start button is disabled
during<00:00:45.150> gameplay<00:00:46.040> but<00:00:47.540> like<00:00:48.540> if<00:00:48.750> you<00:00:48.989> if

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:49.470 
during gameplay but like if you if

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:51.439 
during gameplay but like if you if
you're<00:00:49.710> willing<00:00:49.860> to<00:00:50.129> lose<00:00:50.370> it<00:00:50.580> like<00:00:51.210> some

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
you're willing to lose it like some

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.660 
you're willing to lose it like some
lives<00:00:51.769> you<00:00:52.769> can<00:00:53.010> use<00:00:53.400> the<00:00:53.580> bug<00:00:53.760> mode<00:00:53.970> like<00:00:55.670> like

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
lives you can use the bug mode like like

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.450 
lives you can use the bug mode like like
for<00:00:57.269> starters<00:00:57.660> I'm<00:00:57.870> going<00:00:58.080> to<00:00:58.140> use<00:00:58.460> knuckles

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
for starters I'm going to use knuckles

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.200 
for starters I'm going to use knuckles
in<00:00:59.790> Angel<00:01:00.300> Island<00:01:00.420> Act<00:01:00.900> one<00:01:01.379> to<00:01:02.250> enable<00:01:02.610> level

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
in Angel Island Act one to enable level

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.010 
in Angel Island Act one to enable level
select<00:01:03.479> because<00:01:04.909> if<00:01:05.909> I<00:01:06.090> was<00:01:06.210> an<00:01:06.330> Excel<00:01:06.720> selects

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
select because if I was an Excel selects

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.580 
select because if I was an Excel selects
not<00:01:07.520> enabled<00:01:08.520> debug<00:01:09.360> mode<00:01:09.570> I<00:01:09.810> can<00:01:09.900> tap<00:01:10.260> can't

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
not enabled debug mode I can tap can't

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.780 
not enabled debug mode I can tap can't
activate<00:01:12.830> yeah<00:01:13.830> so<00:01:14.010> I'm<00:01:14.130> using<00:01:14.340> knuckles

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
activate yeah so I'm using knuckles

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.250 
activate yeah so I'm using knuckles
because<00:01:14.909> it's<00:01:15.450> really<00:01:15.750> fast

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:16.260 
because it's really fast

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.810 
because it's really fast
I<00:01:16.470> guess<00:01:17.070> much<00:01:17.250> faster<00:01:17.700> than<00:01:19.369> start<00:01:20.369> I'm<00:01:20.549> like

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
I guess much faster than start I'm like

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.690 
I guess much faster than start I'm like
doing<00:01:21.270> this<00:01:21.420> with<00:01:21.720> Sonic<00:01:22.500> or<00:01:22.830> well<00:01:23.400> I<00:01:23.490> could

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
doing this with Sonic or well I could

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.330 
doing this with Sonic or well I could
use<00:01:23.729> whatever<00:01:25.070> so<00:01:26.070> you<00:01:26.130> just<00:01:26.280> got<00:01:26.520> a<00:01:26.549> a<00:01:28.340> puddin

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
use whatever so you just got a a puddin

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:38.740 
use whatever so you just got a a puddin
level<00:01:29.729> select<00:01:29.970> code<00:01:30.330> and<00:01:31.640> like<00:01:32.640> three<00:01:33.060> times

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:50.219 

doing<00:01:39.750> that

the first time is tails you can wear any
other<00:03:56.720> character<00:03:57.230> you<00:03:57.830> can<00:03:58.750> just<00:03:59.750> die<00:03:59.960> and

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:00.200 
other character you can just die and

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.800 
other character you can just die and
then<00:04:00.290> hold<00:04:00.500> a<00:04:00.730> until<00:04:01.730> the<00:04:01.880> level<00:04:02.360> starts<00:04:02.420> again

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810 
then hold a until the level starts again

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:04.450 
then hold a until the level starts again
and<00:04:03.020> use<00:04:03.200> the<00:04:03.320> black<00:04:03.440> mode<00:04:03.650> if<00:04:03.830> you<00:04:03.890> might<00:04:04.070> want

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:04.460 
and use the black mode if you might want

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:05.860 
and use the black mode if you might want
to<00:04:04.490> use<00:04:04.610> in<00:04:04.730> a<00:04:04.820> different<00:04:05.150> level<00:04:05.300> you<00:04:05.600> got<00:04:05.750> to

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870 
to use in a different level you got to

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:06.640 
to use in a different level you got to
do<00:04:05.960> what<00:04:06.140> I<00:04:06.170> just<00:04:06.230> did

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.650
