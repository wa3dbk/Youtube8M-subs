00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:07.090
 good evening I will train now 

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:12.430
 a little bit for youtube and how it burns itself 

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:15.369
 I'll tell you about this little toy 

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:19.759
 I use 1 day 

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:23.749
 there are pros and cons tell 

00:00:19.759 --> 00:00:27.019
 First, about the minuses the battery holds 

00:00:23.749 --> 00:00:30.859
 just one day though nothing in it 

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:32.719
 without opening anything I still use what 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:37.390
 I’m a little bit unhappy that when I 

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:40.550
 I charge this little hole at night 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:45.079
 blue rows I already sealed it 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:47.960
 tape it shines so that illuminates 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:50.899
 it’s a pity the whole room until dawn 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:55.250
 and it is impossible to turn it over because 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:58.699
 it hinders again yes here so close 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:03.559
 the hole is impossible to take tape spun 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:06.079
 because it stands beside the bed yes it is 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:11.299
 the first minus that I do not like this 

00:01:06.079 --> 00:01:13.400
 garbage here's a little bulb left 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:16.130
 small-small is much smaller 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:19.520
 only it was visible so the tape closed 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:22.100
 this is the first thing the second thing is a little bit 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.100
 podbivaet here it charged like which 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:27.259
 mounted below 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:30.399
 such a hand i am. which you should open 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:33.079
 her and she all the time for 

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:34.250
 snaps so don't know how much 

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:37.990
 how much 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:47.350
 it will be enough to latch all the time 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:47.350
 this is a minus minus also now I will show 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:53.430
 minus also also that here 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:02:00.500
 web browser which you are here 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:02:03.979
 I downloaded them on the phone 21 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:11.730
 2 here is such an opera mini 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:14.220
 both rudely shit why yes very 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:22.340
 just why because like so 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:25.530
 looks with with all in one porridge nothing 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:34.860
 nothing is clear and nothing opens 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:42.150
 that's how it works that doesn't even 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:45.030
 opens it can't open anything here 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:49.830
 such a web browser can read news 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:54.380
 Photos can not see sosi yes it is 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:55.700
 minus and this mini opera also works 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:59.970
 also 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:03.630
 also nonsense full letters read 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:06.290
 nothing more can be done normally 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:10.530
 go somewhere to see something 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:19.799
 this can not be done navigation works 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:23.850
 normal navigation works fine 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:31.560
 ok right now it starts there she is looking for me 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:37.489
 type yes it is a minus and ok let her 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:37.489
 there is looking for a calculator downloaded 

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:47.210
 here it works well you can style with 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:53.390
 This phone handle 

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:56.030
 play music and so on here it is 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:58.070
 also works fine i like it 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:06.620
 the only one could have more options 

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:10.910
 hours put here on what we are here 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:16.000
 stopped yes oh these are the clock options 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:16.000
 what is possible to install 

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:25.550
 I chose this because the weather is here 

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:26.540
 here time here if something happens 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:28.760
 message or what 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:33.430
 and put here how much this little bit 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:38.150
 steps this is also nonsense no need not counting 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:42.010
 that's what else this all the time appears 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:49.310
 for some reason also considers steps 

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:53.180
 thinks okay it's so pluses now about 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:54.100
 pros pros such that I put here 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:57.670
 sim card 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:05:01.040
 2 phones that I took yesterday 

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:04.670
 really it all works even when 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:06.950
 my connected bluetooth phone is my 

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:10.430
 samsung with it anyway sim card 

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:17.210
 works about all calls come to this 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:20.540
 number on this one is shorter on the clock yes here 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:21.230
 i like it plus what else what 

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:24.320
 still 

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:26.800
 Well, it's probably for now and all that I hurt 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:31.130
 per day 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:32.990
 what I noticed during the day yes you can charter 

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:36.950
 set quieter but no one bother 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:39.640
 will not call and so on well 

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:39.640
 okay, all rushed
