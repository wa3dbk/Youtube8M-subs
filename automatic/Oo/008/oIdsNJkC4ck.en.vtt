and<00:04:06.540> there's<00:04:06.720> always<00:04:06.930> this<00:04:07.260> slight<00:04:07.680> very<00:04:08.040> slow

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:08.609 
and there's always this slight very slow

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:11.240

sense<00:04:08.970> of<00:04:09.150> morphing<00:04:09.750> in<00:04:10.079> the<00:04:10.709> light<00:04:10.889> and<00:04:11.129> I

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250

00:04:39.619 --> 00:04:39.629 
intense yellow on these walls and then

00:04:39.629 --> 00:04:41.270 
intense yellow on these walls and then
it<00:04:39.780> was<00:04:39.900> like<00:04:40.050> sort<00:04:40.169> of<00:04:40.289> normal<00:04:40.620> daylight<00:04:40.979> and

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:01.440 
Fiola but um it's an instrument that has

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:04.790 
Fiola but um it's an instrument that has
a<00:05:01.530> very<00:05:01.830> personal<00:05:02.009> connection<00:05:02.250> to<00:05:02.669> and<00:05:03.800> that's

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800 
a very personal connection to and that's

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:09.350 
a very personal connection to and that's
sort<00:05:05.009> of<00:05:05.129> how<00:05:05.340> the<00:05:05.400> idea<00:05:05.849> of<00:05:07.219> like<00:05:08.360> exploring

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360 
sort of how the idea of like exploring

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.020 
sort of how the idea of like exploring
the<00:05:09.509> rocking<00:05:10.080> between<00:05:10.650> open<00:05:10.979> strings<00:05:11.310> and<00:05:11.580> and

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:12.030 
the rocking between open strings and and

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:14.540 
the rocking between open strings and and
I<00:05:12.539> think<00:05:13.229> a<00:05:13.259> lot<00:05:13.409> about<00:05:13.530> physical<00:05:14.009> motions<00:05:14.370> and

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:14.550 
I think a lot about physical motions and

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:16.909 
I think a lot about physical motions and
I<00:05:14.610> love<00:05:14.819> this<00:05:14.940> idea<00:05:15.090> of<00:05:15.449> starting<00:05:15.780> these<00:05:16.110> very

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:16.919 
I love this idea of starting these very

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:20.059 
I love this idea of starting these very
very<00:05:17.280> soft<00:05:17.639> almost<00:05:18.120> non-existent<00:05:18.960> sounds<00:05:19.319> and

00:05:20.059 --> 00:05:20.069 
very soft almost non-existent sounds and

00:05:20.069 --> 00:05:21.830 
very soft almost non-existent sounds and
gradually<00:05:20.639> start<00:05:20.879> rocking<00:05:21.240> between<00:05:21.690> the

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:21.840 
gradually start rocking between the

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:23.869 
gradually start rocking between the
strings<00:05:22.169> until<00:05:22.650> the<00:05:22.830> rocking<00:05:23.430> motion<00:05:23.460> bit

00:05:23.869 --> 00:05:23.879 
strings until the rocking motion bit

00:05:23.879 --> 00:05:27.290 
strings until the rocking motion bit
wilder<00:05:24.270> and<00:05:24.300> wilder<00:05:24.750> and<00:05:24.870> one<00:05:24.990> other<00:05:25.080> and<00:05:26.300> sort

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:27.300 
wilder and wilder and one other and sort

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:29.779 
wilder and wilder and one other and sort
of<00:05:27.360> the<00:05:27.479> way<00:05:27.930> that<00:05:28.710> the<00:05:28.889> arm<00:05:29.129> moves<00:05:29.460> it's<00:05:29.669> like

00:05:29.779 --> 00:05:29.789 
of the way that the arm moves it's like

00:05:29.789 --> 00:05:31.580 
of the way that the arm moves it's like
a<00:05:29.819> metaphor<00:05:30.330> for<00:05:30.539> me

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:31.590 
a metaphor for me

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:33.640 
a metaphor for me
like<00:05:31.830> patterns

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:33.650 
like patterns

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:37.990 
like patterns
Anjali<00:05:35.620> worked<00:05:36.620> out<00:05:36.800> a<00:05:36.830> solo<00:05:37.100> viola<00:05:37.400> version

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:38.000 
Anjali worked out a solo viola version

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.180 
Anjali worked out a solo viola version
of<00:05:38.120> this<00:05:38.240> piece<00:05:38.479> and<00:05:38.900> then<00:05:39.500> I<00:05:39.590> wrote<00:05:39.740> a<00:05:39.770> trio

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:40.190 
of this piece and then I wrote a trio

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:43.350 
of this piece and then I wrote a trio
version<00:05:40.699> of<00:05:40.820> it<00:05:40.970> for<00:05:41.320> violin<00:05:42.320> viola<00:05:42.500> cello

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:43.360 
version of it for violin viola cello

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:44.740 
version of it for violin viola cello
hybrid

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:44.750 
hybrid

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:47.500 
hybrid
cello<00:05:45.020> version<00:05:45.560> of<00:05:45.710> it<00:05:46.270> because<00:05:47.270> it's

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:47.510 
cello version of it because it's

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:50.890 
cello version of it because it's
material<00:05:48.050> that<00:05:48.290> is<00:05:48.470> very<00:05:49.419> comes<00:05:50.419> directly<00:05:50.810> out

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:50.900 
material that is very comes directly out

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:52.659 
material that is very comes directly out
of<00:05:51.050> the<00:05:51.320> way<00:05:51.500> that<00:05:51.830> string<00:05:52.130> instruments<00:05:52.580> are

00:05:52.659 --> 00:05:52.669 
of the way that string instruments are

00:05:52.669 --> 00:05:55.900 
of the way that string instruments are
built<00:05:53.389> and<00:05:53.660> how<00:05:54.470> the<00:05:54.530> open<00:05:54.919> strings<00:05:55.280> work<00:05:55.580> and

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:55.910 
built and how the open strings work and

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:59.740 
built and how the open strings work and
so<00:05:57.310> it's<00:05:58.310> very<00:05:58.430> easy<00:05:58.550> to<00:05:58.790> translate<00:05:59.300> it<00:05:59.449> to<00:05:59.510> any

00:05:59.740 --> 00:05:59.750 
so it's very easy to translate it to any

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:01.629 
so it's very easy to translate it to any
stringed<00:06:00.139> instrument<00:06:00.620> I<00:06:00.830> haven't<00:06:01.460> tried<00:06:01.580> for

00:06:01.629 --> 00:06:01.639
