00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.978
 So people! I'm going to make some jokes here from Minecraft. 

00:00:02.023 --> 00:00:04.183
 You'll love! It's very good! 

00:00:05.008 --> 00:00:07.769
 After all, people are not born liking Minecraft, right? 

00:00:07.679 --> 00:00:10.047
 This is behavioral. 

00:00:15.248 --> 00:00:19.808
 I'll go next time. I'll tell you one like this: 

00:00:19.882 --> 00:00:23.129
 A Creeper had no ass. It was farting and exploding. 

00:00:24.543 --> 00:00:26.047
 Oh, that's very good. 

00:00:27.275 --> 00:00:30.923
 No reason why? Because cu is round, and Minecraft is all square. 

00:00:33.377 --> 00:00:39.449
 Do you know which is the coolest command in Minecraft? It is Alt + F4. 

00:00:42.221 --> 00:00:43.958
 Why close the window. 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:46.630
 Zoei! 

00:00:48.528 --> 00:00:53.992
 So the Minecraft Chives dog is called Bloquinho. 

00:00:56.336 --> 00:00:57.688
 There's one more here, very good. 

00:00:59.929 --> 00:01:05.281
 "I'm a fuck! I found a diamond in Minecraft!" When you find a woman, let me know! 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.779
 It is getting better! Will have more. 

00:01:13.433 --> 00:01:19.146
 Here, Ã“: BBB and Minecraft have players who interact with each other and are confined. 

00:01:20.035 --> 00:01:23.260
 In the second case it is because the mother does not let her leave the house. 

00:01:25.972 --> 00:01:32.286
 He does not leave home and such. You can not, and such. Because it's new. 

00:01:33.741 --> 00:01:36.277
 You do not understand, the joke is very evolved. 

00:01:37.306 --> 00:01:40.938
 I'll tell you a joke about Minecraft here: Minecraft. 

00:01:47.728 --> 00:01:50.016
 Wait, but look, the Craft family is good. 

00:01:50.824 --> 00:01:56.689
 There's Starcraft, Warcraft ... There's always a black sheep in the family. 

00:02:02.985 --> 00:02:04.417
 Then I'll tell you one more. 

00:02:05.279 --> 00:02:09.056
 This one is intelligent, of etymology. 

00:02:11.416 --> 00:02:15.072
 "Mine" is mine, right? "Mine", from the English, "mine". 

00:02:15.116 --> 00:02:17.548
 And "craft"? "Life is not interesting." 

00:02:18.198 --> 00:02:21.215
 It's "my life is not interesting". 

00:02:28.797 --> 00:02:32.125
 It was over, that was it. Excuse.
