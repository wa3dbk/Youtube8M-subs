them<00:00:30.480> I've<00:00:30.689> shown<00:00:30.929> and<00:00:31.460> then<00:00:32.460> jump<00:00:32.730> up<00:00:32.910> and

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
them I've shown and then jump up and

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.470 
them I've shown and then jump up and
fire<00:00:33.329> the<00:00:33.510> cake<00:00:33.770> using<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:35.010> X<00:00:35.160> button<00:00:35.480> into

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
the equation insights when you're

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.040 
the equation insights when you're
jumping<00:00:40.620> off<00:00:40.920> from<00:00:41.360> throwing<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.450> cake<00:00:42.719> you

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
jumping off from throwing the cake you

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.569 
jumping off from throwing the cake you
must<00:00:43.290> make<00:00:43.469> sure<00:00:43.500> you're<00:00:43.829> in<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.040> air<00:00:44.309> and

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
must make sure you're in the air and

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.910 
must make sure you're in the air and
jump<00:00:44.910> before<00:00:45.390> you<00:00:45.480> throw<00:00:45.690> it<00:00:45.840> like<00:00:46.680> there

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
jump before you throw it like there

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.920 
jump before you throw it like there
you'll<00:00:47.129> see<00:00:47.309> it<00:00:47.430> won't<00:00:47.579> hit<00:00:47.850> until<00:00:48.059> you<00:00:48.600> at<00:00:48.750> the

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
you'll see it won't hit until you at the

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.350 
you'll see it won't hit until you at the
peak<00:00:49.260> of<00:00:49.379> your<00:00:49.469> jump<00:00:49.879> so<00:00:50.879> you<00:00:50.969> have<00:00:51.090> to<00:00:51.210> make

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
peak of your jump so you have to make

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.510 
peak of your jump so you have to make
sure<00:00:51.539> you've<00:00:51.719> jumped<00:00:52.050> fully<00:00:52.469> and<00:00:52.710> then<00:00:53.340> you

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
sure you've jumped fully and then you

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.939 
sure you've jumped fully and then you
throw<00:00:53.699> it<00:00:53.820> when<00:00:53.969> you're<00:00:54.120> up<00:00:54.210> in<00:00:54.360> there<00:00:56.930> so<00:00:57.949> it's

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
throw it when you're up in there so it's

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.860 
throw it when you're up in there so it's
free<00:00:59.190> time<00:00:59.460> just<00:00:59.879> to<00:00:59.969> throw<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.270> cake<00:01:00.480> into

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
free time just to throw the cake into

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.170 
free time just to throw the cake into
the<00:01:01.260> equation<00:01:01.829> inside<00:01:02.190> to<00:01:02.399> destroy<00:01:02.730> it<00:01:02.910> on<00:01:03.059> the

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
the equation inside to destroy it on the

the equation inside to destroy it on the
first<00:01:03.390> level<00:01:03.710> not<00:01:04.710> complete<00:01:04.979> destroy<00:01:05.369> it<00:01:05.549> but

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
first level not complete destroy it but

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.780 
first level not complete destroy it but
destroy<00:01:06.030> it<00:01:06.150> on<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.330> first<00:01:06.540> level<00:01:07.460> as<00:01:08.460> shown

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
destroy it on the first level as shown

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.270 
destroy it on the first level as shown
the<00:01:09.510> creation<00:01:09.930> will<00:01:10.110> move<00:01:10.560> up<00:01:10.680> to<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:10.890> second

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
the creation will move up to the second

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.010 
the creation will move up to the second
level<00:01:11.310> and<00:01:11.729> you'll<00:01:12.180> get<00:01:12.360> into<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.600> elevator

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
level and you'll get into the elevator

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.580 
level and you'll get into the elevator
and<00:01:13.380> go<00:01:14.390> inside<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.450> elevator<00:01:15.720> make<00:01:16.140> sure<00:01:16.380> you

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
and go inside the elevator make sure you

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.170 
and go inside the elevator make sure you
always<00:01:16.770> get<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.130> free<00:01:17.310> times<00:01:17.580> by<00:01:17.970> moving

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
always get the free times by moving

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.730 
always get the free times by moving
quickly<00:01:18.479> from<00:01:18.720> left<00:01:18.930> to<00:01:19.020> right<00:01:19.229> to<00:01:19.470> get<00:01:19.619> all

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
quickly from left to right to get all

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.800 
quickly from left to right to get all
the<00:01:19.860> points<00:01:20.250> if<00:01:20.610> you<00:01:21.180> want<00:01:21.360> to<00:01:21.450> make<00:01:21.570> sure<00:01:21.600> you

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
the points if you want to make sure you

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.399 
the points if you want to make sure you
get<00:01:21.930> that<00:01:22.080> high<00:01:22.229> score<00:01:22.530> on<00:01:23.900> the<00:01:24.900> second<00:01:25.290> level

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
get that high score on the second level

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.460 
get that high score on the second level
here<00:01:25.740> you'll<00:01:26.460> see<00:01:26.670> a<00:01:26.700> series<00:01:27.180> of<00:01:27.229> purple<00:01:28.229> balls

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
here you'll see a series of purple balls

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.770 
here you'll see a series of purple balls
with<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.130> creation<00:01:29.369> fires<00:01:29.790> up<00:01:30.659> in<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:31.079> air<00:01:32.780> so

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
with the creation fires up in the air so

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.120 
with the creation fires up in the air so
when<00:01:33.930> you<00:01:34.049> first<00:01:34.290> learn<00:01:34.590> you<00:01:34.799> want<00:01:34.890> to<00:01:34.979> make

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
when you first learn you want to make

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.670 
when you first learn you want to make
sure<00:01:35.250> you<00:01:35.430> get<00:01:35.549> as<00:01:35.670> far<00:01:35.850> forward<00:01:36.090> as<00:01:36.270> you<00:01:36.329> can

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:36.680 
sure you get as far forward as you can

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.310 
sure you get as far forward as you can
in<00:01:37.680> order<00:01:37.920> to<00:01:38.189> make<00:01:38.340> sure<00:01:38.729> that<00:01:39.390> you<00:01:39.540> can<00:01:39.780> do

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
in order to make sure that you can do

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.940 
in order to make sure that you can do
that<00:01:40.560> I've<00:01:41.220> shown

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.790 

one<00:01:44.930> once<00:01:45.930> you've<00:01:46.140> done<00:01:46.260> that<00:01:46.320> you'll<00:01:46.620> have<00:01:46.740> to

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:46.800 
one once you've done that you'll have to

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.520 
one once you've done that you'll have to
wait<00:01:47.070> for<00:01:47.400> the<00:01:47.460> next<00:01:47.610> row<00:01:48.570> palpable<00:01:49.110> to<00:01:49.260> go<00:01:49.380> by

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
wait for the next row palpable to go by

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.980 
wait for the next row palpable to go by
hogging<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.340> cake<00:01:50.580> dispenser<00:01:51.240> and<00:01:51.420> then

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
hogging the cake dispenser and then

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.690 
hogging the cake dispenser and then
moving<00:01:52.320> forward<00:01:52.740> to<00:01:53.190> make<00:01:53.220> sure<00:01:53.490> you<00:01:53.610> avoid

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
moving forward to make sure you avoid

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.480 
moving forward to make sure you avoid
the<00:01:53.970> next<00:01:54.270> round<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:55.110> purple<00:01:55.409> balls<00:01:55.619> and

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
the next round the purple balls and

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.640 
the next round the purple balls and
wants<00:01:56.729> the<00:01:56.820> creation<00:01:57.150> comes<00:01:57.360> back<00:01:57.510> down<00:01:57.720> and

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:58.650 
wants the creation comes back down and

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:00.620
