 this is a turn which is not only not 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:38.930
 you lose speed but even I increase 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.930
 I'll show you now 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:03.250
 Now I will show you a couple of simple 

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:06.520
 preparatory exercises which 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:09.820
 help you to easily step over one 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:11.650
 video to others and believe what you

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:18.280
 turning for our first get on 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:20.649
 management will need a side already on 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:24.729
 the belt and the belly of me here is a tree 

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:27.340
 and remember to turn on the treasure we 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:31.600
 did such a torsion from support to 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:35.200
 days now we will improve it we 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.220
 add a little twist 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.190
 stepping over 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:44.159
 externally foot internal see first 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:47.259
 go shoulders and then right foot decide it 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:51.009
 very important moment we first transfer 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:56.319
 body weight to the center of rotation and then 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:58.600
 walk with rejoice on that all 

00:01:56.319 --> 00:02:00.330
 time to twist a large body such 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.670
 side of the turn 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:05.760
 note i put the videos not 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:09.020
 parallel and each time transferring a new 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.020
 I 'm starting to turn Beona 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.410
 see, I didn't even try at all 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:21.650
 repel but in principle I already have 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:23.750
 went movement Pavarotti tilt case 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.880
 if you ca nâ€™t scare right away 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.220
 asphalt you can always find yourself 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:31.730
 spacious lawn me you carpet for 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:35.950
 of your very first attempts now I'm 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.950
 also describe to you my mistake 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:45.070
 look from this leg position 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:46.360
 call the tram and just sometimes 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:48.460
 I want to at first try 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.470
 chewing put your feet just in 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:52.240
 tram 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:56.710
 man forget to tilt stepping over 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:59.620
 I can also go to the center of the turn 

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:03.630
 the error is called pacing from the heel here 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:06.040
 the problem is that the straight leg is brought in 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:09.340
 step foot is not bent at the knee 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:11.950
 and the video can not stand on all four 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.960
 the wheels are obtained as the first concerns 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:16.810
 asphalt and heel of course there 

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:18.100
 insecurely unstable you yourself can 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:21.370
 feel that something is wrong here 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:23.940
 Now I will show you again 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:26.040
 the right way to do it and 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:28.690
 I will list all your steps 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:31.590
 movement and we will begin with the local 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:35.849
 bend your knees 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:39.090
 shoulders side of your turn try 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:42.480
 and the shoulders ahead of you feet first 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:45.569
 start to fall a bit right away 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.610
 catch yourself in the lesson 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:50.269
 then stepping over will be very 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:50.269
 naturally 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:59.400
 in the next issue I will tell you about 

00:03:56.159 --> 00:04:01.680
 the new stage of mastering the rotation by cutting 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:04.049
 when we turn to her debts 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:06.000
 speed disturbance as well as he will 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:08.430
 interesting to those people who have a holiday already 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.459
 can do something but would like to do it 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:13.790
 more efficiently meet through 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:13.790
