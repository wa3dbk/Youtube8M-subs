00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
it's that simple again since it's

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.819 
it's that simple again since it's
designed<00:00:52.260> for<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:53.390> iPhone<00:00:54.390> it<00:00:54.930> has<00:00:55.440> easy

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
designed for the iPhone it has easy

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.940 
designed for the iPhone it has easy
access<00:00:56.160> to<00:00:56.700> all<00:00:57.090> your<00:00:57.120> controls<00:00:57.750> snaps<00:00:58.710> on

00:00:58.940 --> 00:00:58.950 
access to all your controls snaps on

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:02.889 
access to all your controls snaps on
easily<00:00:59.340> but<00:00:59.550> it<00:00:59.670> doesn't<00:01:00.000> come<00:01:00.210> off<00:01:00.239> easily<00:01:00.780> so

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:02.899 
easily but it doesn't come off easily so

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:06.590 
easily but it doesn't come off easily so
trying<00:01:03.899> to<00:01:04.199> pry<00:01:05.159> it<00:01:05.219> open<00:01:05.459> you<00:01:05.819> got<00:01:05.939> to<00:01:06.090> work<00:01:06.389> at

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
trying to pry it open you got to work at

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.120 
trying to pry it open you got to work at
it<00:01:06.780> quite<00:01:06.990> a<00:01:07.049> bit<00:01:07.340> to<00:01:08.340> really<00:01:08.869> get<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:10.130> phone

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
it quite a bit to really get the phone

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.069 
it quite a bit to really get the phone
out<00:01:13.609> and<00:01:14.609> I<00:01:14.729> guess<00:01:14.880> that's<00:01:15.030> why<00:01:15.299> there's<00:01:15.840> an

00:01:16.069 --> 00:01:16.079 
out and I guess that's why there's an

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:18.949 
out and I guess that's why there's an
opening<00:01:16.920> up<00:01:17.130> here<00:01:17.420> so<00:01:18.420> that<00:01:18.450> it<00:01:18.689> makes<00:01:18.810> it

00:01:18.949 --> 00:01:18.959 
opening up here so that it makes it

00:01:18.959 --> 00:01:22.940 
opening up here so that it makes it
easier<00:01:19.409> to<00:01:20.270> pull<00:01:21.270> out<00:01:21.450> when<00:01:21.749> you<00:01:21.929> need<00:01:22.259> to<00:01:22.289> just

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
easier to pull out when you need to just

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.419 
easier to pull out when you need to just
like<00:01:23.069> that<00:01:23.310> and<00:01:24.149> again<00:01:24.770> you<00:01:25.770> could<00:01:25.889> swap<00:01:26.219> it

00:01:26.419 --> 00:01:26.429 
like that and again you could swap it

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:31.359 
like that and again you could swap it
out<00:01:26.549> with<00:01:26.789> a<00:01:27.029> different<00:01:28.729> case<00:01:29.729> as<00:01:30.060> you<00:01:30.539> need<00:01:30.779> to

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:31.369 
out with a different case as you need to

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:38.269 
out with a different case as you need to
very<00:01:32.369> easily<00:01:34.130> but<00:01:35.130> it<00:01:35.490> really<00:01:35.849> is<00:01:36.920> gonna<00:01:37.920> take

00:01:38.269 --> 00:01:38.279 
very easily but it really is gonna take

00:01:38.279 --> 00:01:40.879 
very easily but it really is gonna take
a<00:01:38.459> little<00:01:38.670> bit<00:01:38.880> of<00:01:38.939> effort<00:01:39.329> to<00:01:39.479> to<00:01:39.810> really<00:01:40.319> pull

00:01:40.879 --> 00:01:40.889 
a little bit of effort to to really pull

00:01:40.889 --> 00:01:47.419 
a little bit of effort to to really pull
it<00:01:41.039> open<00:01:41.249> and<00:01:43.399> it's<00:01:44.399> a<00:01:44.459> little<00:01:44.579> hard<00:01:44.969> so<00:01:46.429> it's

00:01:47.419 --> 00:01:47.429 
it open and it's a little hard so it's

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:49.339 
it open and it's a little hard so it's
not<00:01:47.639> gonna<00:01:47.789> fall<00:01:48.029> off<00:01:48.299> that<00:01:48.329> basically<00:01:49.139> that's

00:01:49.339 --> 00:01:49.349 
not gonna fall off that basically that's

00:01:49.349 --> 00:01:50.480 
not gonna fall off that basically that's
what<00:01:49.469> I'm<00:01:49.560> just<00:01:49.770> trying<00:01:49.979> to<00:01:50.009> say<00:01:50.159> you're<00:01:50.340> not
