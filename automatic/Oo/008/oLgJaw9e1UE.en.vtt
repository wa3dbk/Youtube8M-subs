00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:44.440
 accordingly, the signal begins to 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:46.870
 yell starting from the drawdown level to 4 here 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.600

 laret arrow anyway here 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.989
 probably the most suitable mode for 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:54.300
 Moscow but very well what they did 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:57.250

 eats once and then the maximum 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.930
 maximum response sensitivity to 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:10.150
