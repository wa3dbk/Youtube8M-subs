00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:35.860 
talking about it as well

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.820 
talking about it as well
mr.<00:01:36.460> taco<00:01:36.820> also<00:01:37.150> says<00:01:37.450> that<00:01:37.659> the<00:01:37.750> asm1<00:01:38.260> gear<00:01:38.619> is

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:38.830 
mr. taco also says that the asm1 gear is

mr. taco also says that the asm1 gear is
a<00:01:38.860> legendary<00:01:39.340> weapon<00:01:39.549> that<00:01:39.760> has<00:01:39.880> +3<00:01:40.510> range<00:01:40.810> -<00:01:41.350> -

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
a legendary weapon that has +3 range - -

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.039 
a legendary weapon that has +3 range - -
and<00:01:41.740> clip<00:01:41.920> size<00:01:42.159> and<00:01:42.580> that<00:01:43.360> seems<00:01:43.689> really

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:44.049 
and clip size and that seems really

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:45.990 
and clip size and that seems really
awesome<00:01:44.500> because<00:01:44.590> +3<00:01:45.250> range<00:01:45.460> might<00:01:45.729> not<00:01:45.850> seem

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.000 
awesome because +3 range might not seem

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.730 
awesome because +3 range might not seem
like<00:01:46.030> too<00:01:46.299> much<00:01:46.450> but<00:01:46.720> think<00:01:47.260> about<00:01:47.439> this<00:01:47.560> with

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740 
like too much but think about this with

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.710 
like too much but think about this with
advanced<00:01:48.070> rifling<00:01:48.520> we'll<00:01:48.640> make<00:01:48.760> that<00:01:48.939> +5

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:49.720 
advanced rifling we'll make that +5

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.840 
advanced rifling we'll make that +5
range<00:01:50.260> that's<00:01:50.830> absurd<00:01:51.310> and<00:01:51.549> that<00:01:51.670> means

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850 
range that's absurd and that means

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:53.399 
range that's absurd and that means
you'll<00:01:52.060> be<00:01:52.090> pretty<00:01:52.479> much<00:01:52.630> having<00:01:52.960> a<00:01:53.049> damage

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:53.409 
you'll be pretty much having a damage

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:55.140 
you'll be pretty much having a damage

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:55.150 
boost and that would for sure make this

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:57.510 
boost and that would for sure make this
