 [music] 

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:13.880
 Hello everyone today I want to express my 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:20.779
 opinion on the account open dota 2 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:24.210
 I just did not have time to do it 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:26.519
 Of course the biggest drawback of dota 2 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.340
 this is when you enter this game and she 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:32.460
 it becomes a real addiction for you 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:36.630
 o for an adult who has 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:40.230
 work family time is very very 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.910
 strongly Jesus but of course when you are a student 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.960
 or schoolboy you are not so 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:51.539
 important and at this age everything seems to me 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:55.940
 that just all the time is infinite but when 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:01:00.570
 you are 40 years old and you are left to yourself 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:04.260
 do you understand that the phrase time cannot be money 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:06.750
 has a cult status chart is obtained 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:10.020
 so for one party here from vag goes 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:12.930
 the second is for the second and third quarter 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:17.130
 desire for example to sit and and bedtime 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:21.380
 up to half an hour who is on it most 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:25.909
 cases probably always delayed 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:28.909
 guys and more hours is n't it yes and 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:31.820
 of course you can't quit the party 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:34.310
 otherwise the game will punish you for it 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:36.110
 priority of course and for the eternal 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.789
 staying in this game were just 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:43.659
 just losing your real friends 

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:48.979
 yes now every friend is also playing on 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:52.130
 this is no real communication and by the way 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:54.229
 the appearance of the character and the meaning of the game to me 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:57.530
 just very much influence the psyche 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:02:00.979
 it develops some kind of aggression and 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.970
 the desire to constantly kill means what else 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:05.979
 hero panel 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:09.319
 hero panel generally gives a lot 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:12.110
 information on the character skills icons 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:14.110
 heroes my recharge and the fact that 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:20.150
 something like that 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:22.989
 oh my god oh my god however practically 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:27.519
 indistinguishable and the parameters of the hero 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:30.920
 attack defense agility strength and intelligence and 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:33.910
 27 stupid windows on both sides 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:37.549
 character icons indicate 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:41.299
 flaws panel and yet this lack 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:42.000
 mana strip have enemy characters so 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:45.330
 what else 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.810
 so this game is she monotonous goal 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:52.069
 the game does not change at all 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:55.359
 same card same design 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:59.150
 same characters in general nothing 

00:02:55.359 --> 00:03:03.499
 attracting still lack means or 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:06.620
 by faith it is almost impossible because of them 

00:03:03.499 --> 00:03:08.840
 play a normal game a lot of mistakes 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.159
 enrollment world and waffles therefore 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.549
 have to endure 

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:15.859
 if a person leaves the game then continue 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:18.530
 play it in many cases just 

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:21.590
 it makes no sense because to such players 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:23.989
 if labor is some kind of contempt in this game 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:27.139
 no quick finish possible 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:31.579
 if you can see that the team can not pull out 

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:34.159
 the machine game allies are weak they can't 

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:36.469
 confront your opponent it would be nice 

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:40.510
 was write some kind of appropriate 

00:03:36.469 --> 00:03:43.579
 the team that was finishing the game yet 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:46.579
 lack of dota 2 is brilliant 

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:50.049
 monetization is probably just lazy and not 

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:53.290
 admired you buy your things 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:55.500
 favorite hero who actually 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:57.850
 [music] 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:01.030
 direct do not affect the game 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:05.470
 no one forces you to shop 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:08.250
 up disturbed unobtrusive but somehow 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:11.770
 way sooner or later anyway 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:14.800
 you bring your money here first 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:17.950
 turn it works psychology well and 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:20.380
 of course the principles of network marketing 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:23.920
 your friends are bragging about new color 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:26.350
 and the rest envy him what you already 

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:31.390
 why can't you spend some 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:34.300
 basics 20 bucks on paste of course 

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:37.080
 I can and sooner or later everything to this 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.080
 is coming 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:46.520
 stupid 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:51.150
 standard social education 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:53.150
 speaks in you i will raise my own 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:56.580
 children on dota2 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:05:01.260
 I read this answer on one of 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:05.000
 forums a person who did not like them 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:08.010
 dota2 and preferred self development 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:13.340
 it is worth thinking about who 

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:15.180
 stupid standard social education 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:17.990
 dota 2 game 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:21.570
 This is for those who want to start. 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:26.210
 degrade lowering people after all 

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:29.669
 such conditions are very difficult to stay 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:32.490
 mannered and cultured man the 

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:34.190
 most you limit yourself from the real 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:37.520
 of the world 

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:41.789
 lose a month or even years of life 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:45.180
 sitting out in some kind of stupid game 

00:05:41.789 --> 00:05:49.229
 Basically, I said everything I wanted to wish. 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:52.320
 those who start the village continue to move 

00:05:49.229 --> 00:05:58.680

00:05:52.320 --> 00:06:02.669

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:06.960
 kira night farther even i wont 

00:06:02.669 --> 00:06:11.300
 say what to do but decide 

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:11.300
