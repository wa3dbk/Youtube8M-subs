meeting<00:02:00.570> must<00:02:00.840> have<00:02:01.079> gone<00:02:01.610> something<00:02:02.610> like

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
meeting must have gone something like

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.510 
meeting must have gone something like
that<00:02:03.000> maybe<00:02:03.719> with<00:02:04.170> less<00:02:04.469> effeminate<00:02:05.040> American

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
that maybe with less effeminate American

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.479 
that maybe with less effeminate American
accents<00:02:06.000> but<00:02:06.060> but<00:02:06.479> pretty<00:02:06.750> much<00:02:07.129> but<00:02:08.129> for<00:02:08.160> all

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
accents but but pretty much but for all

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.729 
accents but but pretty much but for all
the<00:02:08.670> lack<00:02:08.970> of<00:02:09.000> diversity<00:02:09.360> in<00:02:09.959> grinding<00:02:10.500> uh<00:02:10.619> see

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
the lack of diversity in grinding uh see

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.340 
the lack of diversity in grinding uh see
it's<00:02:10.950> not<00:02:11.280> that<00:02:11.670> quest<00:02:12.090> per<00:02:12.510> se

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
it's not that quest per se

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.730 
it's not that quest per se
which<00:02:13.770> is<00:02:14.010> upset<00:02:14.430> me<00:02:14.610> the<00:02:14.640> most<00:02:15.110> it's<00:02:16.110> the<00:02:16.410> very

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
which is upset me the most it's the very

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:20.060 
which is upset me the most it's the very
first<00:02:16.890> one<00:02:17.570> that<00:02:18.570> you<00:02:18.720> got<00:02:19.080> when<00:02:19.470> you<00:02:19.530> arrived

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
first one that you got when you arrived

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:22.790 
first one that you got when you arrived
here<00:02:20.100> and<00:02:20.550> it<00:02:20.640> was<00:02:20.760> to<00:02:20.940> find<00:02:21.240> the<00:02:21.480> anomaly<00:02:22.020> you

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
here and it was to find the anomaly you

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.640 
here and it was to find the anomaly you
get<00:02:22.950> this<00:02:23.040> action<00:02:23.280> button<00:02:23.880> on<00:02:24.000> your<00:02:24.150> screen

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
get this action button on your screen

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.280 
get this action button on your screen
the<00:02:25.650> action<00:02:26.100> button<00:02:26.280> fills<00:02:26.910> up<00:02:27.300> the<00:02:27.480> closer<00:02:27.900> to

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
the action button fills up the closer to

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.650 
the action button fills up the closer to
the<00:02:28.440> anomaly<00:02:28.890> you<00:02:29.040> get<00:02:29.280> until<00:02:30.240> you<00:02:30.450> eventually

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
the anomaly you get until you eventually

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.050 
the anomaly you get until you eventually
find<00:02:31.260> it<00:02:31.530> but<00:02:32.130> because<00:02:32.250> I've<00:02:32.550> done<00:02:32.730> all<00:02:32.850> these

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
find it but because I've done all these

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.090 
find it but because I've done all these
quests<00:02:33.570> multiple<00:02:34.320> times<00:02:34.530> I<00:02:34.680> must<00:02:34.860> have<00:02:34.950> been

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
quests multiple times I must have been

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.240 
quests multiple times I must have been
in<00:02:35.160> this<00:02:35.340> ruin<00:02:35.760> what<00:02:36.300> 10<00:02:36.780> or<00:02:37.020> 12<00:02:37.350> times<00:02:37.800> now

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
in this ruin what 10 or 12 times now

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.180 
in this ruin what 10 or 12 times now
with<00:02:38.940> both<00:02:39.180> the<00:02:39.420> elite's<00:02:39.690> and<00:02:39.960> the<00:02:40.020> horde<00:02:40.260> the

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
with both the elite's and the horde the

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.590 
with both the elite's and the horde the
anomaly<00:02:41.790> is<00:02:42.000> in<00:02:42.360> the<00:02:42.540> same<00:02:42.900> spot<00:02:43.380> every<00:02:44.600> single

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
anomaly is in the same spot every single

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.860 
anomaly is in the same spot every single
time<00:02:46.230> and<00:02:46.650> I<00:02:47.490> thought<00:02:47.850> because<00:02:48.210> of<00:02:48.570> the<00:02:48.690> way

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
time and I thought because of the way

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.540 
time and I thought because of the way
that<00:02:49.080> that<00:02:49.230> question<00:02:49.680> was<00:02:49.770> developed<00:02:50.280> it<00:02:50.430> was

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
that that question was developed it was

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:53.390 
that that question was developed it was
a<00:02:50.580> wonderful<00:02:51.210> opportunity<00:02:51.540> for<00:02:52.230> Blizzard<00:02:53.220> to

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
a wonderful opportunity for Blizzard to

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.810 
a wonderful opportunity for Blizzard to
stick<00:02:53.760> this<00:02:53.970> anomaly<00:02:54.510> around<00:02:55.050> the<00:02:55.260> place

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820 
stick this anomaly around the place

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:58.460 
stick this anomaly around the place
because<00:02:56.820> that<00:02:56.940> would<00:02:57.060> also<00:02:57.240> expedite<00:02:58.050> running

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
because that would also expedite running

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.010 
because that would also expedite running
into<00:02:58.830> the<00:02:58.920> mobs<00:02:59.130> that<00:02:59.220> you<00:02:59.430> needed<00:02:59.760> to<00:02:59.790> kill<00:03:00.120> to

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:01.020 
into the mobs that you needed to kill to

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:03.650 
into the mobs that you needed to kill to
loot<00:03:01.230> or<00:03:01.500> maybe<00:03:02.070> not<00:03:02.460> loot<00:03:02.760> if<00:03:03.030> your<00:03:03.180> Alliance

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
loot or maybe not loot if your Alliance

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.190 
loot or maybe not loot if your Alliance
cuz<00:03:04.050> that's<00:03:04.530> completely<00:03:05.310> different<00:03:05.990> so<00:03:06.990> yeah

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
cuz that's completely different so yeah

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.140 
cuz that's completely different so yeah
that's<00:03:07.470> the<00:03:07.680> one<00:03:07.830> witches<00:03:08.280> is<00:03:08.520> pretty<00:03:08.940> much

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
that's the one witches is pretty much

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.930 
that's the one witches is pretty much
upset<00:03:09.600> me<00:03:09.750> the<00:03:09.780> most<00:03:09.900> and<00:03:10.290> and<00:03:11.130> speaking<00:03:11.850> of

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
upset me the most and and speaking of

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.750 
upset me the most and and speaking of
which<00:03:12.000> I<00:03:12.360> mean<00:03:12.510> patch<00:03:12.810> 5.1<00:03:13.530> is<00:03:13.800> is<00:03:14.040> literally

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
which I mean patch 5.1 is is literally

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.750 
which I mean patch 5.1 is is literally
two<00:03:15.120> weeks<00:03:15.450> maximum<00:03:16.080> away<00:03:16.500> I<00:03:16.830> doubt<00:03:17.520> it's

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
two weeks maximum away I doubt it's

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.480 
two weeks maximum away I doubt it's
going<00:03:17.910> to<00:03:18.000> come<00:03:18.090> out<00:03:18.210> this<00:03:18.420> reset<00:03:19.160> good<00:03:20.160> chance

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:20.490 
going to come out this reset good chance

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:23.330 
going to come out this reset good chance
of<00:03:20.640> it<00:03:20.730> coming<00:03:20.790> out<00:03:21.120> next<00:03:21.420> reset<00:03:22.100> but<00:03:23.100> if<00:03:23.220> it

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
of it coming out next reset but if it

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.430 
of it coming out next reset but if it
doesn't<00:03:23.730> come<00:03:23.850> out<00:03:23.970> then<00:03:24.390> then<00:03:24.750> they're<00:03:24.930> very

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
doesn't come out then then they're very

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.800 
doesn't come out then then they're very
very<00:03:25.920> very<00:03:26.310> likely<00:03:26.670> the<00:03:26.970> reset<00:03:27.300> after<00:03:27.450> that

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
very very likely the reset after that

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.380 
very very likely the reset after that
even<00:03:28.740> the<00:03:28.830> Blues<00:03:29.070> have<00:03:29.280> hinted<00:03:29.640> that<00:03:29.700> it's

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
even the Blues have hinted that it's

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:32.840 
even the Blues have hinted that it's
going<00:03:30.540> to<00:03:30.600> drop<00:03:30.810> at<00:03:30.990> any<00:03:31.110> single<00:03:31.470> time<00:03:31.860> but

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
going to drop at any single time but

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:35.990 
going to drop at any single time but
there's<00:03:33.030> just<00:03:33.300> such<00:03:33.570> a<00:03:33.600> lack<00:03:34.290> of<00:03:34.790> content<00:03:35.790> in

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
there's just such a lack of content in

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.110 
there's just such a lack of content in
patch<00:03:36.210> 5.1<00:03:36.980> it<00:03:37.980> asked<00:03:38.130> to<00:03:38.280> round<00:03:38.460> it<00:03:38.730> all<00:03:38.790> up

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
patch 5.1 it asked to round it all up

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.230 
patch 5.1 it asked to round it all up
now<00:03:39.450> we've<00:03:39.870> got<00:03:40.080> a<00:03:40.350> few<00:03:41.160> extra<00:03:41.340> pet<00:03:41.790> battle

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:42.240 
now we've got a few extra pet battle

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.360 
now we've got a few extra pet battle
bosses<00:03:42.630> if<00:03:42.810> you<00:03:43.230> do<00:03:43.410> pet<00:03:43.680> battles<00:03:44.100> I

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
bosses if you do pet battles I

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.930 
bosses if you do pet battles I
personally<00:03:45.060> don't<00:03:45.380> doesn't<00:03:46.380> interest<00:03:46.740> me<00:03:46.940> we

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
personally don't doesn't interest me we

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.600 
personally don't doesn't interest me we
also<00:03:48.120> have<00:03:48.300> a<00:03:48.870> few<00:03:49.200> extra<00:03:49.320> scenarios<00:03:50.220> with

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:50.610 
also have a few extra scenarios with

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:55.280 
also have a few extra scenarios with
varying<00:03:51.090> degrees<00:03:51.120> of<00:03:51.980> fun<00:03:52.980> and<00:03:53.690> also<00:03:54.690> because

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
varying degrees of fun and also because

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.580 
varying degrees of fun and also because
their<00:03:55.470> faction<00:03:55.980> specific<00:03:56.700> you<00:03:57.540> can<00:03:57.720> only<00:03:57.870> do<00:03:58.230> I

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
their faction specific you can only do I

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.710 
their faction specific you can only do I
think<00:03:58.830> three<00:03:59.430> out<00:03:59.730> of<00:03:59.790> the<00:04:00.090> five<00:04:00.300> that<00:04:00.570> it's

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
think three out of the five that it's

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:05.510 
think three out of the five that it's
going<00:04:00.900> to<00:04:00.990> release<00:04:01.320> maximum<00:04:02.190> and<00:04:02.990> then<00:04:04.520> we

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:05.520 
going to release maximum and then we

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:08.720 
going to release maximum and then we
have<00:04:05.820> these<00:04:06.330> of<00:04:06.570> course<00:04:06.840> and<00:04:07.140> also<00:04:08.040> the
