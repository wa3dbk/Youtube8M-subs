00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
screen protector and I'm not sure I

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:36.740 
screen protector and I'm not sure I
guess<00:00:35.430> is<00:00:35.579> what<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:35.940> screen<00:00:36.270> protector<00:00:36.630> of

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
guess is what the screen protector of

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.319 
guess is what the screen protector of
application<00:00:37.290> kids<00:00:37.700> or<00:00:38.700> maybe<00:00:38.879> to<00:00:39.090> some

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329

third-party<00:00:39.750> screen<00:00:40.469> protector<00:00:41.180> but<00:00:42.180> I<00:00:42.480> guess

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
third-party screen protector but I guess

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.190

so<00:04:18.800> I'm<00:04:18.830> kind<00:04:18.980> of<00:04:19.280> screwed<00:04:19.520> and<00:04:20.060> I<00:04:20.600> will<00:04:20.750> need

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840 
so I'm kind of screwed and I will need

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:23.860 
so I'm kind of screwed and I will need

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:23.870 
to find an English manual so I'll do

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:29.080 
to find an English manual so I'll do
that<00:04:23.990> later<00:04:24.050> on<00:04:26.170> so<00:04:27.170> on<00:04:27.710> to<00:04:28.610> the<00:04:28.700> unit<00:04:29.000> itself

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.090 
that later on so on to the unit itself

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:37.000 
that later on so on to the unit itself
oh<00:04:30.070> god<00:04:31.070> there<00:04:31.670> we<00:04:31.790> go<00:04:32.060> this<00:04:32.270> is<00:04:32.300> the<00:04:32.600> unit<00:04:36.010> it's

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.010 
oh god there we go this is the unit it's

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:39.940 
oh god there we go this is the unit it's
wrapped<00:04:37.520> in<00:04:37.820> a<00:04:38.210> plastic<00:04:38.450> film<00:04:39.260> not<00:04:39.650> too<00:04:39.800> sure

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:39.950 
wrapped in a plastic film not too sure

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:43.080 
wrapped in a plastic film not too sure
you<00:04:40.070> see<00:04:40.250> the<00:04:40.370> film<00:04:40.670> itself<00:04:41.320> around<00:04:42.320> the<00:04:42.530> base

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:43.090 
you see the film itself around the base

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:46.030 
you see the film itself around the base
and<00:04:44.090> all<00:04:44.300> the<00:04:44.510> way<00:04:44.660> to<00:04:44.720> the<00:04:45.020> top<00:04:45.380> of<00:04:45.410> the<00:04:45.740> cover

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:46.040 
and all the way to the top of the cover

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:47.860 
and all the way to the top of the cover
here<00:04:46.280> so<00:04:46.490> I<00:04:46.520> guess<00:04:46.820> this<00:04:47.000> will<00:04:47.060> have<00:04:47.210> to<00:04:47.360> do<00:04:47.630> for

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:47.870 
here so I guess this will have to do for

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.610 
here so I guess this will have to do for
a<00:04:48.320> time<00:04:48.530> before<00:04:48.920> I<00:04:49.100> put<00:04:49.310> on<00:04:49.400> the<00:04:49.520> case<00:04:49.760> itself

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:50.620 
a time before I put on the case itself

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:52.780 
a time before I put on the case itself
and<00:04:51.620> yeah<00:04:51.770> you<00:04:51.830> know<00:04:51.950> what<00:04:52.160> this<00:04:52.280> is<00:04:52.340> actually

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:52.790 
and yeah you know what this is actually

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:54.850 
and yeah you know what this is actually
pretty<00:04:53.030> light<00:04:53.330> I'm<00:04:53.570> surprised<00:04:54.080> it's<00:04:54.530> very

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:54.860 
pretty light I'm surprised it's very

00:04:54.860 --> 00:05:00.520 
pretty light I'm surprised it's very
light<00:04:56.320> so<00:04:57.320> this<00:04:57.770> is<00:04:57.980> it<00:04:59.110> see<00:05:00.110> that's<00:05:00.320> right

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:00.530 
light so this is it see that's right

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:05.620 
light so this is it see that's right
here<00:05:01.780> it's<00:05:02.780> kind<00:05:02.960> of<00:05:03.050> like<00:05:03.110> an<00:05:03.260> iPod<00:05:03.680> I<00:05:04.630> don't

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:05.630

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:11.310 
have samsung p2 which is a black one so
let's<00:05:08.360> set<00:05:08.540> a<00:05:08.600> try<00:05:08.810> a<00:05:08.840> different<00:05:09.200> flavor<00:05:09.470> and

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:11.320 
let's set a try a different flavor and
