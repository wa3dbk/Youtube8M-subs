00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:34.340 
to keep in mind that at the time I was

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.160 
to keep in mind that at the time I was
playing<00:00:34.609> I<00:00:34.940> totally<00:00:35.570> forgot<00:00:35.840> about<00:00:35.899> the

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:36.170 
playing I totally forgot about the

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:37.750 
playing I totally forgot about the
counter<00:00:36.470> system<00:00:36.800> so<00:00:37.100> it's<00:00:37.250> kind<00:00:37.520> of<00:00:37.579> my<00:00:37.700> fault

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:37.760 
counter system so it's kind of my fault

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.819 
counter system so it's kind of my fault
feeling<00:00:38.390> this<00:00:38.480> way<00:00:38.630> towards<00:00:38.809> it<00:00:39.170> but<00:00:39.470> even<00:00:39.739> if

00:00:39.819 --> 00:00:39.829 
feeling this way towards it but even if

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:41.290 
feeling this way towards it but even if
I<00:00:39.950> somehow<00:00:40.220> remember<00:00:40.670> to<00:00:40.790> do<00:00:40.910> it<00:00:41.059> there's

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:41.300 
I somehow remember to do it there's

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.090 
I somehow remember to do it there's
still<00:00:41.570> a<00:00:41.600> chance<00:00:41.690> that<00:00:42.170> I<00:00:42.320> could<00:00:42.440> fail<00:00:42.800> and

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:43.100 
still a chance that I could fail and

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.040 
still a chance that I could fail and
give<00:00:43.399> the<00:00:43.579> opponent<00:00:44.059> that<00:00:44.239> opportunity<00:00:44.870> to

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:45.050 
give the opponent that opportunity to

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.170 
give the opponent that opportunity to
use<00:00:45.320> the<00:00:45.530> team<00:00:45.739> ultimate<00:00:46.130> jutsu<00:00:46.489> now<00:00:46.880> before<00:00:47.030> I

00:01:22.059 --> 00:01:22.069 
coming this week so the actual

00:01:22.069 --> 00:01:24.609 
coming this week so the actual
counter-attack<00:01:22.759> is<00:01:22.880> good<00:01:23.299> but<00:01:23.749> the<00:01:24.139> part<00:01:24.439> i

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:24.619 
counter-attack is good but the part i

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:26.739 
counter-attack is good but the part i
dislike<00:01:25.009> about<00:01:25.159> it<00:01:25.459> is<00:01:25.579> how<00:01:25.969> it<00:01:26.240> breaks<00:01:26.509> your

00:01:26.739 --> 00:01:26.749 
dislike about it is how it breaks your

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:28.629 
dislike about it is how it breaks your
opponent's<00:01:27.259> guard<00:01:27.529> in<00:01:27.799> my<00:01:28.099> opinion<00:01:28.399> i<00:01:28.609> think

00:01:28.629 --> 00:01:28.639 
opponent's guard in my opinion i think

00:01:28.639 --> 00:01:30.940 
opponent's guard in my opinion i think
the<00:01:28.939> punishment<00:01:29.119> is<00:01:29.479> way<00:01:29.659> too<00:01:29.719> severe<00:01:30.259> just<00:01:30.770> to

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
the punishment is way too severe just to

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:32.620 
the punishment is way too severe just to
do<00:01:31.039> a<00:01:31.069> counter-attack<00:01:31.729> it<00:01:31.939> should<00:01:32.299> be<00:01:32.329> more

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
do a counter-attack it should be more

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.809 
do a counter-attack it should be more
like<00:01:32.689> a<00:01:32.869> push<00:01:33.409> back<00:01:33.709> or<00:01:33.950> something<00:01:34.219> now<00:01:34.789> i

00:01:34.809 --> 00:01:34.819

00:01:36.099 --> 00:01:36.109 
don't want to say it does it every

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:37.659 
don't want to say it does it every
single<00:01:36.259> time<00:01:36.380> because<00:01:36.889> i've<00:01:37.099> only<00:01:37.279> tried<00:01:37.579> it

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:37.669 
single time because i've only tried it

00:01:37.669 --> 00:01:40.300 
single time because i've only tried it
like<00:01:37.969> three<00:01:38.209> times<00:01:38.299> and<00:01:38.899> all<00:01:39.380> three<00:01:39.770> times<00:01:40.039> it

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
like three times and all three times it

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.699 
like three times and all three times it

have just been lucky i really doubt it

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:46.330

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
though now for what i like about this

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.969 
though now for what i like about this
game<00:01:46.639> let's<00:01:47.179> start<00:01:47.509> off<00:01:47.630> with<00:01:47.929> verse<00:01:48.439> supports

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 
game let's start off with verse supports

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:51.159 
game let's start off with verse supports
back<00:01:49.399> a<00:01:49.429> few<00:01:49.669> weeks<00:01:49.849> ago<00:01:49.999> there<00:01:50.599> was<00:01:50.719> a<00:01:50.779> room<00:01:50.989> of

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:51.169 
back a few weeks ago there was a room of

00:01:51.169 --> 00:01:52.989 
back a few weeks ago there was a room of
that<00:01:51.319> the<00:01:51.529> supports<00:01:51.979> were<00:01:52.340> way<00:01:52.759> more

00:01:52.989 --> 00:01:52.999 
that the supports were way more

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:55.089 
that the supports were way more
vulnerable<00:01:53.539> to<00:01:53.959> attacks<00:01:54.349> and<00:01:54.590> i<00:01:54.770> can<00:01:54.950> now

00:01:55.089 --> 00:01:55.099 
vulnerable to attacks and i can now

00:01:55.099 --> 00:01:56.889 
vulnerable to attacks and i can now
confirm<00:01:55.549> that<00:01:55.759> is<00:01:55.909> true<00:01:56.179> which<00:01:56.450> is<00:01:56.599> a<00:01:56.630> plus

00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:56.899 
confirm that is true which is a plus

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:58.539 
confirm that is true which is a plus
because<00:01:57.139> the<00:01:57.380> supports<00:01:57.799> take<00:01:57.950> damage<00:01:58.159> from

00:01:58.539 --> 00:01:58.549 
because the supports take damage from

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:00.519 
because the supports take damage from
the<00:01:58.759> smallest<00:01:59.299> things<00:01:59.599> like<00:01:59.840> a<00:02:00.049> regular

00:02:00.519 --> 00:02:00.529 
the smallest things like a regular

00:02:00.529 --> 00:02:02.559 
the smallest things like a regular
chakra<00:02:01.039> desh<00:02:01.249> so<00:02:01.700> I<00:02:01.729> don't<00:02:01.969> think<00:02:02.299> guard

00:02:02.559 --> 00:02:02.569 
chakra desh so I don't think guard

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:04.510 
chakra desh so I don't think guard
supports<00:02:03.079> are<00:02:03.319> going<00:02:03.649> to<00:02:03.739> be<00:02:03.829> a<00:02:03.859> problem<00:02:04.099> for

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
supports are going to be a problem for

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.549 
supports are going to be a problem for
storm<00:02:04.880> revolution<00:02:04.999> alright<00:02:05.809> so<00:02:05.989> the<00:02:06.109> next<00:02:06.139> new

thing<00:02:06.590> but<00:02:06.979> I<00:02:07.009> like<00:02:07.189> about<00:02:07.369> this<00:02:07.489> game<00:02:07.849> is<00:02:07.999> that

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
thing but I like about this game is that

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.540 
thing but I like about this game is that
you<00:02:08.450> can<00:02:08.780> continue<00:02:09.140> your<00:02:09.319> combo<00:02:09.830> after<00:02:10.399> doing

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
you can continue your combo after doing

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.850 
you can continue your combo after doing
a<00:02:10.670> ninja<00:02:11.030> move<00:02:11.209> now<00:02:11.629> I'm<00:02:11.989> not<00:02:12.290> gonna<00:02:12.469> lie<00:02:12.560> I

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
never got a chance to do it myself but

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.330 
never got a chance to do it myself but
I've<00:02:14.689> seen<00:02:14.959> the<00:02:15.140> opponents<00:02:15.650> do<00:02:15.799> it<00:02:15.920> to<00:02:16.159> me

more flashy with our combos which was
really<00:02:43.670> needed<00:02:44.090> because<00:02:44.240> back<00:02:44.750> in<00:02:44.780> storm<00:02:45.170> free

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
what the hell did I just do and that's

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:57.730 
what the hell did I just do and that's
exactly<00:02:56.210> how<00:02:56.630> I<00:02:56.660> felt<00:02:56.960> because<00:02:57.140> he<00:02:57.560> does<00:02:57.710> a

exactly how I felt because he does a

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:00.310 
exactly how I felt because he does a
canoe<00:02:58.100> and<00:02:58.370> almost<00:02:58.820> nothing<00:02:59.150> happens<00:02:59.630> but

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:00.320 
canoe and almost nothing happens but

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.490 
canoe and almost nothing happens but
