00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.469
 something different that you can not 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.230
 Think you're going to a sushi restaurant?

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.770
 we feel satisfied with this love 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.300
 the first thing I'll ask is that 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.390
 you asked if you can not 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:01.260

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.070
 thing that is not cruel face that will be 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:09.610

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.110
 karubi ex queen of cow 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:19.180
 My time has come, I have not seen 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:21.640
 hysteria who brought was the attendant 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:24.610
 let's continue the search so the a 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:27.790

 of corn pork can get dressed up 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:36.550
 that defines this small 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:39.280
 Let's take a side and also have the 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:41.770
 The policy is this one to come and if there

 death here is the work 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:49.710
 I took also has potato but do not think 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.710
 There's a lot going on late. 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:57.390
 the next wine thinks it's cured 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:03.780
 the chicken meat in also and the way 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.789
 Whatever pod shock mere bahia 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.259
 I think the rest is dessert at 

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:09.720
 people will leave for after some 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:11.730
 Last orders arrived all the dishes 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.940
 what we asked shows the dishes 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:17.489
 show and show the kers and scenes of the 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.920
 pirates who asked if you can see there 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:26.549
 that we have no raw fish 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:31.680
 no being of its kind and now let's 

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:34.170
 I have lunch that I can not cook 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:39.060
 more eat already ate mound already changed to 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:41.660
 belly full but there is still food and 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.660
 now 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:49.249
 the cooperative and the ball like this 

00:02:44.719 --> 00:02:51.249
 here is a little fan 

00:02:49.249 --> 00:02:53.180
 so that's the flavor she always has 

00:02:51.249 --> 00:02:55.939
 liked 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.139
 we finished we finally got to eat 

00:02:55.939 --> 00:02:59.840
 everything you asked for 

00:02:57.139 --> 00:03:02.840
 the logan was standing the last menu 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:05.090
 piece of peanut peanut smell 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.819
 because he was no longer able to stand 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:09.769
 Nothing, no water, I can not take it anymore. 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:11.299
 so let's call the attendant and see 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:15.109
 how much are we going to have to pay the amount 

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:18.169
 of our lunch today in sushi without appearing 

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:20.989
 because of 2,181 yen 

00:03:18.169 --> 00:03:23.510
 was about 60 reais but remembering 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:26.840
 and then many dishes that we asked for 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:29.780
 as the fried chicken is the lÃ¡men and the coca 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:32.299
 glue do not cost 100 yen is not 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:34.609
 welcoming was a slightly more expensive dish 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:37.159
 in our opinion so if you want 

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:38.989
 eat a food other than raw fish 

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:41.540
 Of course it pays more in a 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:43.849
 non-sushi restaurant 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:45.859
 It will be tastier and probably 

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:47.689
 It will come cheaper, but if you do not 

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:49.819
 eat raw fish that accompany your friend 

00:03:47.689 --> 00:03:52.159
 your who wants a lot in a restaurant 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:53.959
 sushi you can go that will have these 

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:56.269
 other options for you of course not 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:58.459
 going to be is this lunch wonder or 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:04:00.560
 dinner but gives you to satisfy a 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:02.359
 Little is not so bad, it's not going to be. 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.189
 have only raw fish this is the first time 

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:05.750
 that we ate like that in the truth 

00:04:04.189 --> 00:04:06.470
 because when we go to the restaurant 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:08.120
 sushi 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:09.439
 I like to eat raw fish so I 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:11.180
 I go in the sushi restaurant it was 

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:13.189
 interesting to make this kind of request 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.900
 To show you and we asked. 

00:04:13.189 --> 00:04:16.909
 others will not eat you all that not 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.949
 and you saw that we did not eat 

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:20.930
 dessert had no dessert 

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:23.000
 this time because it does not give in to eat 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:25.009
 I really wanted to eat the ice cream there but 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.719
 I was not giving it up, it did not work 

00:04:25.009 --> 00:04:29.000
 some people also asked to hear 

00:04:26.719 --> 00:04:30.500
 there the comments on that you finish 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.180
 forgetting to get the little dish that is 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.840
 Come what may, he gave one more 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:35.150
 return 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:36.800
 I do not know how many turns he gives if you 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:39.440
 do not take the plate because we never 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.789
 Stop picking up one more turn I got 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:43.159
 sure he gives because I've come 

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:45.169
 to pass one more time, same time as I think 

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:46.759
 that another table forgot to pick up some 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:49.340
 people asked about the machine 

00:04:46.759 --> 00:04:51.289
 box when we went to pay her 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:52.930
 no sushi if she counted change 

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:55.360
 automatically yes to more 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:56.919
 Tomato counts the change I think 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:59.289
 they mark the value of how much you are 

00:04:56.919 --> 00:05:01.570
 paying and then the machine sees how much 

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:04.180
 which must be charged and only touches the 

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:05.889
 I automatically switch to us 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:07.600
 Another thing they also recommended is about 

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:09.610
 that flag where fitch put the 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:11.320
 Money on top to pay is anyway 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:13.020
 here in Japan works any other 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:16.449
 establishment until today that we will 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:18.400
 supermarket restaurants and other 

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:20.740
 things like that there is that tray you 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:22.479
 put money on the person you can 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:25.449

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:27.580

00:05:29.349 --> 00:05:32.860

 I'll show you how to give it is only here. 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:41.639
 across the street in the background he is 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:41.639

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:46.479

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:48.400
 japanese shopping that will pass in 

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:51.580

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:58.419
 I can not film in supermarket 

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:00.190
 So goodbye in the videos that fly in 

00:05:58.419 --> 00:06:02.500
 Tuesday the vod videos the people 

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:04.060
 Usually tackles random issues today. 

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:05.949
 we chose some comments from 

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:07.000
 You guys in the video that we did running. 

00:06:05.949 --> 00:06:08.260

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:15.430
 We hope you enjoyed the 

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:17.590

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:19.510
 almost forgetting to warn you already 

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:21.159
 We often have comments in you 

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:22.900
 asking us to come back with that 

00:06:21.159 --> 00:06:24.190
 that we had exactly one 

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:26.380
 but those videos that we 

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:28.530
 answer some of your questions 

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:29.569
 so we decided to create the hashtag 

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:31.759
 jan25 

00:06:29.569 --> 00:06:33.589
 He answers and you can send your 

00:06:31.759 --> 00:06:35.809
 question to us is very important that 

00:06:33.589 --> 00:06:37.969
 you write right to hashtag because 

00:06:35.809 --> 00:06:40.249
 It's easy for us to look for your 

00:06:37.969 --> 00:06:42.020
 questions if you type wrong or 

00:06:40.249 --> 00:06:43.069
 change the lyrics we will not find 

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:44.779
