 Hello dear friends today to you 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:09.000
 tell you how to change the air filter in 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:11.840
 car kia rio 2009 so 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.840
 open the hood 

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:27.350
 why the filter is mounted on four 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:27.350
 for metal plugs this is 1 2 3 and 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.119
 here 4 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:40.140
 so we take snaps 4 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:40.140
 metal plugs 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:50.350
 it snaps off quite easily after 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:54.070
 how we have emphasized stubs you can 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.070
 lift the filter housing 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:06.430
 removed the filter housing by 2 0 left or 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.430
 right so as not to interfere 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.960
 we get a new filter 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:27.130
 get old filter see that filter 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.130
 dirty 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:34.810
 and paste it just like it was 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:34.810
 new air filter 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:39.200
 insert it tightly so that no 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.810
 rezinochki nowhere 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.980
 on the sides do not stick out if they stick out 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:49.690
 then the filter housing will not sit tight and 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:53.920
 the latches do not snap properly 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:53.920
 close the filter housing 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:02:07.450
 insert it tightly and snap it 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:07.450
 metal latches 1 2 3 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:17.210
 4 everything is quite simple and convenient 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:20.240
 so next time you will 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:23.680
 you can change yourself 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:27.230
 and do not pay in the service money for the replacement 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:30.260
