enrichment for the Bears here at San
Diego<00:00:39.170> is<00:00:39.559> a<00:00:39.620> way<00:00:39.920> to<00:00:39.980> provide<00:00:40.339> some<00:00:40.399> kind<00:00:40.789> of

Diego is a way to provide some kind of
stimulation<00:00:41.449> for<00:00:41.809> them<00:00:41.960> our<00:00:42.319> polar<00:00:42.559> bears<00:00:42.859> are

00:00:43.029 --> 00:00:43.039 
stimulation for them our polar bears are

00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:45.610 
stimulation for them our polar bears are
very<00:00:43.280> intelligent<00:00:43.609> animals<00:00:44.329> and<00:00:44.629> live<00:00:45.379> in<00:00:45.530> a

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620 
very intelligent animals and live in a

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.259 
very intelligent animals and live in a
very<00:00:45.829> harsh<00:00:46.129> environment<00:00:46.190> where<00:00:46.909> they<00:00:47.089> would

00:00:47.259 --> 00:00:47.269 
very harsh environment where they would

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:49.869 
very harsh environment where they would
need<00:00:47.420> to<00:00:47.659> use<00:00:47.690> lots<00:00:48.079> of<00:00:48.229> creativity<00:00:48.739> so<00:00:49.670> here

00:00:49.869 --> 00:00:49.879 
need to use lots of creativity so here

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:52.239 
need to use lots of creativity so here
at<00:00:49.940> the<00:00:50.030> San<00:00:50.239> Diego<00:00:50.269> Zoo<00:00:50.629> we<00:00:51.109> try<00:00:51.350> to<00:00:51.409> mimic

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:52.249 
at the San Diego Zoo we try to mimic

00:00:52.249 --> 00:00:54.279 
at the San Diego Zoo we try to mimic
that<00:00:52.670> type<00:00:52.940> of<00:00:52.969> behavior<00:00:53.629> by<00:00:53.899> providing

00:00:54.279 --> 00:00:54.289 
that type of behavior by providing

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:56.439 
that type of behavior by providing
different<00:00:54.559> types<00:00:54.769> of<00:00:55.100> enrichment<00:00:55.399> today<00:00:56.239> we

00:00:56.439 --> 00:00:56.449 
different types of enrichment today we

00:00:56.449 --> 00:00:58.840 
different types of enrichment today we
had<00:00:56.659> our<00:00:56.690> burlap<00:00:57.170> buddies<00:00:57.620> volunteer<00:00:58.309> and<00:00:58.639> it

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850 
had our burlap buddies volunteer and it

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:00.639 
had our burlap buddies volunteer and it
seems<00:00:59.089> like<00:00:59.299> Co<00:00:59.510> Luke<00:00:59.659> decided<00:01:00.049> that<00:01:00.319> he<00:01:00.499> would

00:01:00.639 --> 00:01:00.649 
seems like Co Luke decided that he would

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:02.860 
seems like Co Luke decided that he would
just<00:01:00.829> rather<00:01:01.039> cuddle<00:01:01.429> a<00:01:01.639> nap<00:01:01.850> with<00:01:02.120> them<00:01:02.329> so

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:02.870 
just rather cuddle a nap with them so

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.350 
just rather cuddle a nap with them so
Chinook<00:01:03.739> looked<00:01:03.979> around<00:01:04.250> checked<00:01:04.670> out<00:01:05.180> the

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 
Chinook looked around checked out the

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.539 
Chinook looked around checked out the
burlap<00:01:05.690> buddies<00:01:06.140> they<00:01:06.530> both<00:01:06.740> had<00:01:06.979> a<00:01:07.010> good<00:01:07.250> roll

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:07.549 
burlap buddies they both had a good roll

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:09.700 
burlap buddies they both had a good roll
in<00:01:07.729> rub<00:01:07.940> which<00:01:08.180> is<00:01:08.390> very<00:01:08.630> natural<00:01:08.840> behavior<00:01:09.590> of

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 
in rub which is very natural behavior of

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:11.679 
in rub which is very natural behavior of
the<00:01:09.829> Bears<00:01:10.070> and<00:01:10.369> then<00:01:10.939> they<00:01:11.090> both<00:01:11.270> settled

00:01:11.679 --> 00:01:11.689 
the Bears and then they both settled

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:25.330 
the Bears and then they both settled
down<00:01:11.840> to<00:01:12.170> have<00:01:12.320> their<00:01:12.500> morning<00:01:12.649> naps

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.040 

here<00:01:26.340> at<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.520> San<00:01:26.730> Diego<00:01:26.760> Zoo<00:01:27.150> were<00:01:27.510> fortunate

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:28.050 
here at the San Diego Zoo were fortunate

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:29.690 
here at the San Diego Zoo were fortunate
to<00:01:28.200> have<00:01:28.320> five<00:01:28.680> of<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:28.980> eight<00:01:29.130> bear<00:01:29.400> species

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
to have five of the eight bear species

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.940 
to have five of the eight bear species
represented<00:01:30.600> and<00:01:30.750> with<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.410> help<00:01:31.620> of<00:01:31.740> bear

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
represented and with the help of bear

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.500 
represented and with the help of bear
awareness<00:01:32.400> days<00:01:32.640> we<00:01:32.880> hope<00:01:33.030> to<00:01:33.210> provide

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:33.510 
awareness days we hope to provide

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:35.600 
awareness days we hope to provide
valuable<00:01:33.930> information<00:01:34.380> about<00:01:34.830> each<00:01:35.310> of<00:01:35.490> the

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
valuable information about each of the

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.240 
valuable information about each of the
species<00:01:35.850> not<00:01:36.690> only<00:01:36.750> about<00:01:37.350> what's<00:01:37.710> important

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
species not only about what's important

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.580 
species not only about what's important
to<00:01:38.430> the<00:01:38.580> species<00:01:39.060> in<00:01:39.300> the<00:01:39.450> wild<00:01:39.840> but<00:01:40.200> what<00:01:40.380> we

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
to the species in the wild but what we

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.250 
to the species in the wild but what we
can<00:01:40.830> do<00:01:41.040> as<00:01:41.280> members<00:01:41.970> of<00:01:42.120> the<00:01:42.240> public<00:01:42.630> to<00:01:43.080> help

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:43.260 
can do as members of the public to help

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:47.000 
can do as members of the public to help
make<00:01:43.650> them<00:01:43.860> live<00:01:44.070> longer<00:01:44.430> in<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.820> wild<00:01:46.010> some

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:47.010 
make them live longer in the wild some

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:48.770 
make them live longer in the wild some
of<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.190> things<00:01:47.430> we<00:01:47.670> can<00:01:47.880> do<00:01:48.030> to<00:01:48.210> help<00:01:48.360> save<00:01:48.720> the

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
of the things we can do to help save the

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.350 
of the things we can do to help save the
environment<00:01:49.560> are<00:01:49.740> things<00:01:50.130> like<00:01:50.400> recycling

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
environment are things like recycling

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.530 
environment are things like recycling
and<00:01:51.930> trash<00:01:51.960> control<00:01:52.950> we<00:01:53.700> also<00:01:53.910> can<00:01:54.270> look<00:01:54.300> at

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
and trash control we also can look at

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.810 
and trash control we also can look at
using<00:01:54.750> more<00:01:55.110> energy-efficient<00:01:56.070> appliances

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
using more energy-efficient appliances

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.640 
using more energy-efficient appliances
but<00:01:57.330> the<00:01:57.450> biggest<00:01:57.660> thing<00:01:57.990> is<00:01:58.140> lowering<00:01:58.440> our

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:58.650 
but the biggest thing is lowering our

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:00.800 
but the biggest thing is lowering our
co2<00:01:59.040> emissions<00:01:59.729> that<00:02:00.060> seems<00:02:00.360> to<00:02:00.509> be<00:02:00.570> the

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
co2 emissions that seems to be the

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.900 
co2 emissions that seems to be the
leading<00:02:01.020> contributing<00:02:01.770> factor<00:02:02.160> to<00:02:02.790> the

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:02.910 
leading contributing factor to the

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:06.800 
leading contributing factor to the
accelerated<00:02:03.600> rate<00:02:03.750> of<00:02:03.990> the<00:02:04.170> climate<00:02:04.560> change
