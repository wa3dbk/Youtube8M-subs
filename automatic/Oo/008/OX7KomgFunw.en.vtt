00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.559
 how does the go go so it's very 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.710
 simple you go back on the go you 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:21.590
 on the site tmz.com and would like in 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:23.670
 dawn dawn then give our room 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:28.830
 then you choose the pope that you 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:33.870
 so I want it to be the easter bit and 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:40.430
 I downloaded them here you go 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:40.430
 think over what is that really 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.980
 yeah 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:48.120
 it ends up downloading right click 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:54.190
 then extract the files 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:57.340
 ok so we need an error and that's it 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:59.680
 give this file this is the file there is 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:01.989
 all the server files then 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:04.059
 you choose a server start on cries 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:09.340
 to gig gic to that the dead to rent our 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:15.729
 servers so I take the light back 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:20.009
 for the lulz guiglo and bah y'a more 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:20.009
 to throw is finished it's very simple 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.800
 here 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:27.350
 it starts 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.200
 no we are waiting 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:51.960
 techteam good 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:59.950
 that's long it's a long time to start 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:03.450
 a good list service it's not 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:07.050
 extremely go away go seconds 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.050
 it depends on the pc 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:22.880
 so it's same interface that minecraft 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:25.240
 good sense minecraft leaves me to 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.240
 is the 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.519
 so that's when once you see 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.349
 gives is to say that the server is 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:38.000
 on is ready to welcome people 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:41.180
 so if you want to look like people 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.860
 you have to live at the port and this game does not 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.629
 explain it I will not explain to you 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.569
 if you can not open at the port 

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:49.400
 you are using hamachi and I am 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:53.540
 said I will not explain 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:55.940
 no longer exhale yes says raid 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:59.659
 not so seoul and the work 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:02.780
 interiors that's stop and server ip 

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:04.310
 it's just your sword 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.769
 you write while stop to close it 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.440
 seven years after that you go and see 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:13.129
 you had no file 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:15.230
 so we also need the e software 

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:16.060
 our no more + or change them from 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:18.170
 files 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.640
 once installed you make a click 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:23.540
 right chips and tell him the most notes 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:26.000
 more so the ccxr the properties is in 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:29.000
 big this is all this swell of 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.799
 generator server information 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.900
 sun setting i do not know then exercised 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:35.750
 tip if you start the group nether 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.739
 lifted the same it's the name of the file 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:39.290
 with the map 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:40.639
 so it's worth it to touch the 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:42.680
 bullet corrects I do not know then 

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:44.959
 flights and for I advise you to the 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:48.620
 let in folk know not you touch 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:52.819
 that's not that either that no 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:58.389
 more than that for a machine that or 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:04:02.889
 did not touch that npcc for the villagers 

00:03:58.389 --> 00:04:05.090
 have been listed to make a list that 

00:04:02.889 --> 00:04:07.160
 who will go who can enter that server 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:09.349
 open weighed only to inscribe the names 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:11.419
 in the whitelist file that I'm showing 

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:14.239
 after Spain no harm so 

00:04:11.419 --> 00:04:15.470
 this kid is easy to find that the 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:18.380
 pigs at all young or unprofitable 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:21.540
 in his touch not yet when you 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:22.980
 want textures not that 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:24.720
 this morning they do not know you want 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:28.410
 you do what you want we have a 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:29.880
 fashion too it's for these talks that 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:33.930
 the minecraft problem boys can 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:36.000
 come on you put falls and the version 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:38.940
 ready to fly but I advise you 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:42.450
 put it in the pvp it is possible if we 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:44.400
 can kill attacks and legends 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:46.410
 server or not so I advise you 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:50.430
 to put in falls off or when you 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:52.740
 the difficulties are either 0 1 2 or 3 0 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:56.220
 it's peaceful one is it he does it's 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:57.900
 normal is hard gay fashion goes out of fashion 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:59.430
 bascons with his server so I you 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:02.550
 let you put be creative 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:04.890
 selected on the services and 0 and credit 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:07.530
 it's a max player as you want 

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:12.780
 it's but not since their answer when 

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:16.440
 same time at most spam stearns it gets 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:19.350
 live alone view distance is the soul 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:21.690
 of protection when we do not pose very 

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:26.520
 useful general structure this is for the 

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:31.620
 and dungeons the villages and it's on a 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:32.820
 protection that's not too much and the word 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:35.510
 this is the description of the server 

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:35.510
 shame and what you want 

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:38.370
 once you put all this 

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:41.070
 that you want you were this little 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:43.920
 disk is there to record and you 

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:45.540
 then allows the whitelist file that 

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:45.990
 that's it's something that clubs 

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:47.880
 their note 

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:49.530
 that you put the names of the players 

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:53.460
 that you want for example me then 

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:54.990
 Max wanted that style that 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:57.450
 nicknames of the people you want them to 

00:05:54.990 --> 00:06:00.030
 come on the server is not 

00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:03.920
 recorded server that's all the 

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:05.640
 server logs in order to touch too much 

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:07.170
 only if you want to see there 

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:08.620
 ya thing but it's that she has a hole is 

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:11.410
 in 

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:12.900
 then hop that's to say people 

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:14.979
 that they have all the commands 

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:18.520
 so I would advise of your 

00:06:14.979 --> 00:06:21.220
 time pseudo you do not touch 

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:25.320
 frankly that you do not touch here 

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:25.320
 were the names of the banned people 

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:33.130
 and he raises many of the people 

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:35.949
 banished peace mode saas and that's for 

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:36.940
 these you do not touch too much only if 

00:06:35.949 --> 00:06:38.290
 you wanted to reject monks but 

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:42.250
 you will explain that in a neighbor 

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:46.180
 free tutorial you do not touch I was 

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:51.039
 baby traced the map still soft that's it 

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:54.270
 I do not know too much and config we fix 

00:06:51.039 --> 00:06:59.680
 and the configuration to configure everything 

00:06:54.270 --> 00:07:03.449
 new fashion for example with notorious 

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:06.370
 the more you can configure all 

00:07:03.449 --> 00:07:10.570
 all modes and night 

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:13.090
 our guest is configured so voila 

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:15.340
 it was rather fast enough on how 

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:18.729
 creates to seraph the beast cseries app 

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:22.590
 leave a gem and a + for two next 

00:07:18.729 --> 00:07:22.590
 titles yale go bye bye
