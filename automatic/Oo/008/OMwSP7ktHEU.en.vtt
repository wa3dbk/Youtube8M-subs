and this is a more tulip shape so this

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.880 
and this is a more tulip shape so this
as<00:01:14.939> we<00:01:15.150> refer<00:01:15.540> to<00:01:15.630> it<00:01:15.750> as<00:01:15.840> a<00:01:15.869> burgundy<00:01:16.380> glass<00:01:16.590> or

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
would be more in the tulip shape briefly

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.100 
would be more in the tulip shape briefly
explain<00:01:24.000> why<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.299> shape<00:01:24.630> of<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:24.930> glass

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
explain why the shape of the glass

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.510 
explain why the shape of the glass
matters<00:01:25.710> this<00:01:25.799> is<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:25.979> shape<00:01:26.189> of<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.340> glass

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
matters this is the shape of the glass

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.340 
matters this is the shape of the glass
matters<00:01:27.000> for<00:01:27.150> two<00:01:27.330> reasons<00:01:27.780> in<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:27.990> olfactory

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
matters for two reasons in the olfactory

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:29.990 
matters for two reasons in the olfactory
so<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:29.040> nose<00:01:29.250> which<00:01:29.549> is<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:29.820> major

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
so the nose which is the major

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.190 
so the nose which is the major
perception<00:01:30.630> which<00:01:30.750> you<00:01:30.840> get<00:01:30.960> when<00:01:31.110> you're

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
perception which you get when you're

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.380 
perception which you get when you're

what why did I juice glasses it does it

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.469 
what why did I juice glasses it does it
really<00:01:53.130> it's<00:01:53.640> not<00:01:53.790> going<00:01:53.970> to<00:01:54.060> certainly<00:01:54.329> not

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
really it's not going to certainly not

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
this group came from Target by the way

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.150 
this group came from Target by the way
this<00:02:09.209> is<00:02:09.539> target<00:02:09.899> Larry<00:02:10.349> Bell<00:02:10.560> glasses<00:02:11.039> these

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
this is target Larry Bell glasses these

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.640 
this is target Larry Bell glasses these
are<00:02:11.280> a<00:02:11.310> little<00:02:11.459> bit<00:02:11.640> more<00:02:11.670> expensive<00:02:12.270> in<00:02:12.360> the

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
are a little bit more expensive in the

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.319 
are a little bit more expensive in the
into<00:02:12.890> $15<00:02:13.430> and<00:02:13.549> you<00:02:13.610> were<00:02:13.700> taught<00:02:13.909> a<00:02:13.939> champagne

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:14.329 
into $15 and you were taught a champagne

00:02:14.329 --> 00:02:15.699 
into $15 and you were taught a champagne
or<00:02:14.420> sparkling<00:02:14.780> I<00:02:14.959> certainly<00:02:15.260> would<00:02:15.500> look<00:02:15.620> how

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
or sparkling I certainly would look how

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:17.199 
or sparkling I certainly would look how
beautiful<00:02:16.129> that<00:02:16.159> looks<00:02:16.280> and<00:02:16.640> also<00:02:16.849> really

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 
beautiful that looks and also really

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:19.179 
beautiful that looks and also really
very<00:02:17.810> sexy<00:02:18.230> way<00:02:18.349> to<00:02:18.409> do<00:02:18.560> so<00:02:18.680> the<00:02:18.769> idea<00:02:19.040> the

00:02:19.179 --> 00:02:19.189 
very sexy way to do so the idea the

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:20.920 
very sexy way to do so the idea the
flute<00:02:19.459> is<00:02:19.640> kind<00:02:19.849> of<00:02:19.879> passing<00:02:20.239> I<00:02:20.450> think<00:02:20.750> so<00:02:20.900> I

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
flute is kind of passing I think so I

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:22.569 
flute is kind of passing I think so I
think<00:02:21.379> that<00:02:21.500> these<00:02:21.650> wines<00:02:21.920> allow<00:02:22.220> the<00:02:22.280> wines

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:22.579 
think that these wines allow the wines

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:24.100 
think that these wines allow the wines
to<00:02:22.790> be<00:02:22.909> more<00:02:23.090> expressive<00:02:23.360> but<00:02:23.689> a<00:02:23.780> little<00:02:23.989> bit

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
to be more expressive but a little bit

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.229 
to be more expressive but a little bit
easier<00:02:24.500> to<00:02:24.560> drink<00:02:24.860> also<00:02:25.370> decanters<00:02:26.000> are

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:26.239 
easier to drink also decanters are

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:28.390 
easier to drink also decanters are
another<00:02:26.689> fun<00:02:27.019> way<00:02:27.230> of<00:02:27.260> increasing<00:02:27.680> is<00:02:28.189> the

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
another fun way of increasing is the

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.429 
another fun way of increasing is the
candor<00:02:28.760> simply<00:02:29.120> just<00:02:29.269> a<00:02:29.390> presentation<00:02:30.140> device

00:02:30.429 --> 00:02:30.439 
candor simply just a presentation device

00:02:30.439 --> 00:02:32.589 
candor simply just a presentation device
or<00:02:30.709> does<00:02:30.920> that<00:02:30.950> improve<00:02:31.459> the<00:02:31.579> flavor<00:02:31.730> to

00:02:32.589 --> 00:02:32.599 
or does that improve the flavor to

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:33.849 
or does that improve the flavor to
things<00:02:32.840> under<00:02:33.079> candidates<00:02:33.439> decanters

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:33.859 
things under candidates decanters

00:02:33.859 --> 00:02:35.890 
things under candidates decanters
traditionally<00:02:34.430> to<00:02:34.579> decant<00:02:35.000> old<00:02:35.359> wines<00:02:35.629> to

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
traditionally to decant old wines to

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.630 
traditionally to decant old wines to
separate<00:02:36.349> the<00:02:36.500> sediment<00:02:36.980> from<00:02:37.040> the<00:02:37.280> wine<00:02:37.400> but

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
separate the sediment from the wine but

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.099 
separate the sediment from the wine but
these<00:02:37.819> days<00:02:38.030> where<00:02:38.269> wines<00:02:38.480> are<00:02:38.689> young<00:02:38.900> and

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:39.109 
these days where wines are young and

00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:41.170 
these days where wines are young and
fruity<00:02:39.409> also<00:02:40.010> we<00:02:40.129> pour<00:02:40.400> it<00:02:40.489> out<00:02:40.609> in<00:02:40.730> decanter

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
fruity also we pour it out in decanter

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.030 
fruity also we pour it out in decanter
because<00:02:41.450> it<00:02:41.569> allows<00:02:41.750> the<00:02:41.900> wine<00:02:42.049> to<00:02:42.200> breathe<00:02:42.409> to

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
because it allows the wine to breathe to

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.009 
because it allows the wine to breathe to
come<00:02:43.519> out<00:02:43.730> more<00:02:44.000> and<00:02:44.239> to<00:02:44.299> you<00:02:44.720> know<00:02:44.810> it's<00:02:44.959> a

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
nice presentation again this is not

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.149 
nice presentation again this is not
something<00:02:46.400> that<00:02:46.730> has<00:02:47.060> to<00:02:47.090> break<00:02:47.629> the<00:02:47.659> bank

00:02:48.149 --> 00:02:48.159
