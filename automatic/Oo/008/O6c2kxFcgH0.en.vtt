00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:56.770 
harder to play their normal one because

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.040 
harder to play their normal one because

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
very small hands and probably a smaller

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.309 
very small hands and probably a smaller
mouth<00:02:02.259> to<00:02:03.100> kind<00:02:03.429> of<00:02:03.750> save<00:02:04.750> yourself<00:02:05.170> from

00:02:05.309 --> 00:02:05.319 
mouth to kind of save yourself from

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:08.130 
mouth to kind of save yourself from
playing<00:02:05.649> chords<00:02:06.250> on<00:02:06.369> it<00:02:06.520> because<00:02:06.910> it<00:02:07.119> you<00:02:07.929> try

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
playing chords on it because it you try

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:09.690
