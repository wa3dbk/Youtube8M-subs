course<00:01:44.240> it's<00:01:44.420> not<00:01:44.630> only<00:01:44.960> performance<00:01:45.410> we're

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
course it's not only performance we're

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.930 
course it's not only performance we're
after<00:01:45.710> it's<00:01:46.400> looks<00:01:48.369> alright<00:01:49.369> we've<00:01:49.550> got<00:01:49.580> the

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
stock brake system off and we're ready

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.620 
stock brake system off and we're ready
to<00:01:51.650> install<00:01:51.920> the<00:01:52.160> bear<00:01:52.520> Xtreme<00:01:53.030> plus<00:01:53.330> brake

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
to install the bear Xtreme plus brake

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.660 
to install the bear Xtreme plus brake
system<00:01:54.020> right<00:01:54.710> away<00:01:54.920> I've<00:01:55.070> noticed<00:01:55.430> quite<00:01:55.580> a

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
system right away I've noticed quite a

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.490 
system right away I've noticed quite a
few<00:01:55.759> differences<00:01:56.360> it's<00:01:56.840> really<00:01:57.229> going<00:01:57.350> to<00:01:57.410> be

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
few differences it's really going to be

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.260 
few differences it's really going to be
beneficial<00:01:57.649> in<00:01:58.220> decreasing<00:01:58.670> our<00:01:58.790> stopping

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
beneficial in decreasing our stopping

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.359 
beneficial in decreasing our stopping
time<00:01:59.450> as<00:01:59.720> you<00:02:00.170> can<00:02:00.320> see<00:02:00.500> with<00:02:00.710> the<00:02:00.800> stock<00:02:01.070> rotor

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:01.369 
time as you can see with the stock rotor

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:04.150 
time as you can see with the stock rotor
it's<00:02:02.030> a<00:02:02.180> pretty<00:02:02.450> decent<00:02:02.720> size<00:02:02.990> especially<00:02:03.740> for

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:04.160 
it's a pretty decent size especially for

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.340 
it's a pretty decent size especially for
stock<00:02:04.399> but<00:02:05.060> with<00:02:05.180> the<00:02:05.300> bear<00:02:05.570> you<00:02:05.600> have<00:02:05.869> much

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
stock but with the bear you have much

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.800 
stock but with the bear you have much
more<00:02:06.680> mass<00:02:06.950> more<00:02:07.340> mass<00:02:08.000> means<00:02:08.570> better

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
more mass more mass means better

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:10.780 
more mass more mass means better

in preparing the brake system is to

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.640 
in preparing the brake system is to
season<00:04:20.640> the<00:04:20.880> rotors<00:04:21.239> and<00:04:21.359> then<00:04:21.810> get<00:04:22.229> the<00:04:22.410> pads

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
season the rotors and then get the pads

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.710 
season the rotors and then get the pads
which<00:04:23.190> helps<00:04:23.460> burn<00:04:23.669> off<00:04:23.850> the<00:04:24.000> machining<00:04:24.450> oils

which helps burn off the machining oils

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.540 
which helps burn off the machining oils
and<00:04:24.900> establish<00:04:25.320> a<00:04:25.440> wear<00:04:25.650> pattern<00:04:26.010> between<00:04:26.310> the

without heavy use of the brakes then we

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:40.640 
without heavy use of the brakes then we
performed<00:04:39.000> a<00:04:39.060> series<00:04:39.419> of<00:04:39.450> stops<00:04:39.840> followed<00:04:40.530> by

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
pads to cool the process was easy but it

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:46.969 
pads to cool the process was easy but it
took<00:04:45.390> about<00:04:45.510> a<00:04:45.630> week<00:04:45.750> to<00:04:45.900> perform<00:04:46.110> before<00:04:46.860> we

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:46.979
