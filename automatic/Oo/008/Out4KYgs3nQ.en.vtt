00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:47.739 
of transfers you're making there but it

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:49.949 
of transfers you're making there but it
also<00:02:47.890> makes<00:02:48.160> it<00:02:48.310> so<00:02:48.459> you<00:02:48.520> can<00:02:48.760> hold<00:02:49.270> more<00:02:49.600> data

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
also makes it so you can hold more data

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:51.750 
also makes it so you can hold more data
on<00:02:50.110> these<00:02:50.470> cards<00:02:51.010> and<00:02:51.100> make<00:02:51.280> them<00:02:51.430> more<00:02:51.520> cat

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
on these cards and make them more cat

let's<00:03:00.310> see<00:03:00.489> if<00:03:00.580> we<00:03:00.700> can't<00:03:00.910> figure<00:03:01.090> with<00:03:01.360> a

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
let's see if we can't figure with a

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
let's see if we can't figure with a
break<00:03:01.840> in<00:03:01.870> this<00:03:02.110> one<00:03:02.290> I'm<00:03:02.350> talking<00:03:02.530> to<00:03:02.800> you<00:03:02.940> and

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
break in this one I'm talking to you and

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:07.710 
break in this one I'm talking to you and
to<00:03:05.410> give<00:03:05.440> you<00:03:05.590> an<00:03:05.680> example<00:03:06.010> the<00:03:06.940> Microsoft

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
to give you an example the Microsoft

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.320 
to give you an example the Microsoft
Surface<00:03:08.290> just<00:03:08.800> came<00:03:09.010> out<00:03:09.190> the<00:03:09.820> microsoft

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:10.330 
Surface just came out the microsoft

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:13.320 
Surface just came out the microsoft
surface<00:03:10.660> is<00:03:11.140> bound<00:03:12.010> with<00:03:12.190> this<00:03:12.340> technology<00:03:12.700> of

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:13.330 
surface is bound with this technology of

able to use these on your microsoft
surfaces<00:03:22.900> that's<00:03:23.110> what<00:03:23.290> you're<00:03:23.380> taking<00:03:23.620> doing

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:23.860 
surfaces that's what you're taking doing

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:26.910 
surfaces that's what you're taking doing
is<00:03:24.040> it<00:03:24.670> amazing<00:03:25.120> they<00:03:25.450> can<00:03:25.630> fit<00:03:25.840> 64<00:03:26.440> gigabytes

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
is it amazing they can fit 64 gigabytes

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.940 
is it amazing they can fit 64 gigabytes
into<00:03:27.549> that<00:03:27.730> little<00:03:27.850> thing<00:03:28.380> when<00:03:29.380> i<00:03:29.410> started

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
into that little thing when i started

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:32.520 
into that little thing when i started
computing<00:03:30.430> people<00:03:30.820> you<00:03:31.660> bought<00:03:31.900> a<00:03:31.930> brick<00:03:32.260> and

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
computing people you bought a brick and

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:36.330 
computing people you bought a brick and
it<00:03:32.650> was<00:03:32.739> 300<00:03:33.640> megabytes<00:03:34.600> not<00:03:34.989> gigabytes<00:03:35.470> so

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
it was 300 megabytes not gigabytes so

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:37.650 
it was 300 megabytes not gigabytes so
we're<00:03:36.820> going<00:03:36.910> to<00:03:37.000> just<00:03:37.150> going<00:03:37.269> to<00:03:37.360> test<00:03:37.540> this

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.660 
we're going to just going to test this

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:38.940 
we're going to just going to test this
out<00:03:37.840> for<00:03:38.080> a<00:03:38.140> couple<00:03:38.320> days<00:03:38.500> we're<00:03:38.769> going<00:03:38.860> to
