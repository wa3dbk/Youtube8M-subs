yeah this interest in on this airplane

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:24.360 
yeah this interest in on this airplane
here<00:00:22.570> they<00:00:23.080> actually<00:00:23.470> see<00:00:23.920> it's<00:00:24.070> got<00:00:24.220> the

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:24.370

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:26.640 
here they actually see it's got the
little<00:00:24.580> things<00:00:24.790> for<00:00:24.970> the<00:00:25.030> compass<00:00:25.650> adjustment

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:26.650 
little things for the compass adjustment

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:28.350 
little things for the compass adjustment
and<00:00:26.830> then<00:00:26.950> the<00:00:27.130> data<00:00:27.700> plate<00:00:28.030> and<00:00:28.180> when<00:00:28.300> you

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:28.360 
and then the data plate and when you

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:29.850 
and then the data plate and when you
fold<00:00:28.660> them<00:00:28.840> back<00:00:28.900> that's<00:00:29.260> where<00:00:29.500> we<00:00:29.590> have<00:00:29.710> the

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:29.860 
fold them back that's where we have the

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:32.250 
fold them back that's where we have the
radio<00:00:30.220> and<00:00:30.370> the<00:00:30.430> transponder<00:00:31.270> so<00:00:31.780> we<00:00:31.900> try<00:00:32.110> and

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:32.260 
radio and the transponder so we try and

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:33.900 
radio and the transponder so we try and
hide<00:00:32.470> everything<00:00:33.130> if<00:00:33.250> it's<00:00:33.430> not<00:00:33.610> original

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:33.910 
hide everything if it's not original

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:36.110 
hide everything if it's not original
they<00:00:34.330> didn't<00:00:34.540> have<00:00:34.630> radios<00:00:35.080> back<00:00:35.380> then<00:00:35.650> so

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
they didn't have radios back then so

00:00:36.120 --> 00:02:16.540

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
annual on it fixed a lot of little

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.750 
annual on it fixed a lot of little
things<00:03:12.930> we've<00:03:13.650> got<00:03:13.739> a<00:03:13.799> little<00:03:13.980> fabric<00:03:14.219> problem

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
things we've got a little fabric problem

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.909 
things we've got a little fabric problem
we<00:03:14.849> won't<00:03:15.000> need<00:03:15.269> to<00:03:15.389> touch<00:03:15.599> up<00:03:15.900> but<00:03:16.620> I<00:03:16.859> just

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:16.919 
we won't need to touch up but I just

00:03:16.919 --> 00:03:19.220 
we won't need to touch up but I just
taxing<00:03:17.549> it<00:03:17.669> around<00:03:17.969> kind<00:03:18.659> of<00:03:18.719> got<00:03:18.840> the<00:03:18.930> feel<00:03:19.200> of

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
taxing it around kind of got the feel of

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:20.690 
taxing it around kind of got the feel of
being<00:03:19.560> back<00:03:19.739> in<00:03:19.889> the<00:03:19.980> airplane<00:03:20.340> again<00:03:20.519> I

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
being back in the airplane again I

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.550 
being back in the airplane again I
needed<00:03:21.090> to<00:03:21.180> adjust<00:03:21.510> the<00:03:22.139> that<00:03:22.169> we've

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
needed to adjust the that we've

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.699 
needed to adjust the that we've
since<00:03:23.189> uh<00:03:23.489> got<00:03:24.419> some<00:03:24.599> new<00:03:24.750> parachutes<00:03:25.439> and<00:03:25.680> I

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
since uh got some new parachutes and I

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:27.379 
since uh got some new parachutes and I
needed<00:03:25.919> a<00:03:26.069> little<00:03:26.280> bit<00:03:26.370> of<00:03:26.430> a<00:03:26.549> lumbar<00:03:26.879> support

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:27.389 
needed a little bit of a lumbar support

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:30.409 
needed a little bit of a lumbar support
so<00:03:27.629> anyway<00:03:28.379> we're<00:03:28.729> kind<00:03:29.729> of<00:03:29.790> getting<00:03:30.000> ready<00:03:30.150> to

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:30.419 
so anyway we're kind of getting ready to

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:32.569 
so anyway we're kind of getting ready to
potentially<00:03:31.049> get<00:03:31.139> it<00:03:31.290> flying<00:03:31.470> again<00:03:31.680> so<00:03:32.099> I'm

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:32.579 
potentially get it flying again so I'm

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:42.070 
potentially get it flying again so I'm
looking<00:03:32.849> forward<00:03:33.090> to<00:03:33.299> it

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:42.080 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.140 

you
