00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
we started sort of north normal recycled

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.240 
we started sort of north normal recycled
batteries<00:01:43.990> that<00:01:44.470> you<00:01:44.560> buy<00:01:44.710> in<00:01:44.770> a<00:01:44.890> supermarket

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250 
batteries that you buy in a supermarket

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.020 
batteries that you buy in a supermarket
or<00:01:45.670> something<00:01:45.880> like<00:01:45.970> that<00:01:46.110> and<00:01:47.670> you<00:01:48.670> can<00:01:48.880> take

or something like that and you can take

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.690 
or something like that and you can take
both<00:01:49.240> a<00:01:49.510> a<00:01:49.600> size<00:01:50.050> as<00:01:50.350> well<00:01:50.500> as<00:01:50.560> the<00:01:50.700> triple-a

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
both a a size as well as the triple-a

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.560 
both a a size as well as the triple-a
the<00:01:51.730> very<00:01:52.060> small<00:01:52.270> ones<00:01:52.860> and<00:01:53.880> until<00:01:54.880> you<00:01:55.390> see

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:55.570 
the very small ones and until you see

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:57.600 
the very small ones and until you see
that<00:01:55.720> this<00:01:56.110> opens<00:01:56.500> up<00:01:56.620> and<00:01:56.920> you<00:01:56.950> have<00:01:57.310> two

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 
that this opens up and you have two

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:59.730 
that this opens up and you have two
connectors<00:01:58.060> and<00:01:58.390> you<00:01:59.170> sort<00:01:59.320> of<00:01:59.380> it<00:01:59.500> just<00:01:59.590> has

00:01:59.730 --> 00:01:59.740 
connectors and you sort of it just has

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.390 
connectors and you sort of it just has
to<00:01:59.860> be<00:02:00.120> careful<00:02:01.120> with<00:02:01.240> this<00:02:01.360> one<00:02:02.190> to<00:02:03.190> line<00:02:03.370> it

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:03.400 
to be careful with this one to line it

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:12.170 
to be careful with this one to line it
up<00:02:03.580> correctly<00:02:04.320> so<00:02:05.320> eventually<00:02:06.160> go<00:02:06.400> them<00:02:06.580> their

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.949 

second<00:02:13.180> battery<00:02:13.390> like<00:02:13.540> that<00:02:14.010> you<00:02:15.010> know<00:02:15.959> plug

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:16.959 
second battery like that you know plug

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:21.420 
second battery like that you know plug
it<00:02:17.080> in<00:02:18.270> you<00:02:19.270> can<00:02:19.450> see<00:02:19.690> with<00:02:19.870> the<00:02:19.990> mother<00:02:20.430> and

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
it in you can see with the mother and

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.720 
it in you can see with the mother and
see<00:02:21.580> on<00:02:21.670> the<00:02:21.760> display<00:02:21.940> over<00:02:22.390> there<00:02:22.540> and

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
see on the display over there and

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.430 
see on the display over there and
basically<00:02:24.730> you<00:02:25.480> know<00:02:25.510> what<00:02:25.690> I<00:02:25.900> thought<00:02:26.140> it

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
basically you know what I thought it

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.260 
basically you know what I thought it
showed<00:02:26.680> that<00:02:26.740> the<00:02:27.280> right<00:02:27.490> battery<00:02:27.820> both

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
showed that the right battery both

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.330 
showed that the right battery both
batteries<00:02:28.600> in<00:02:28.720> fact<00:02:28.900> have<00:02:29.080> between<00:02:29.709> Finch<00:02:30.130> are

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
batteries in fact have between Finch are

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.240 
batteries in fact have between Finch are
German<00:02:31.260> or<00:02:32.260> the<00:02:32.530> one<00:02:32.620> on<00:02:32.709> the<00:02:32.770> left<00:02:32.950> has<00:02:33.040> moved

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
German or the one on the left has moved

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.760 
German or the one on the left has moved
up<00:02:33.340> to<00:02:33.430> 25<00:02:33.760> seems<00:02:34.090> so<00:02:34.240> it's<00:02:34.630> also<00:02:34.780> a<00:02:35.230> nice

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:35.770 
up to 25 seems so it's also a nice

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:38.880 
up to 25 seems so it's also a nice
device<00:02:36.040> mode<00:02:37.290> indicates<00:02:38.290> to<00:02:38.440> you<00:02:38.590> how<00:02:38.769> much

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
device mode indicates to you how much

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.090 
device mode indicates to you how much
charge<00:02:39.220> is<00:02:39.430> this<00:02:39.959> is<00:02:40.959> in<00:02:41.170> the<00:02:41.200> battery<00:02:41.530> so<00:02:41.739> you

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
charge is this is in the battery so you

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:43.280 
charge is this is in the battery so you
know<00:02:42.310> if<00:02:42.400> you<00:02:42.489> have<00:02:42.580> a<00:02:42.640> couple<00:02:42.820> of<00:02:42.970> entries

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
know if you have a couple of entries

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.009 
know if you have a couple of entries
you're<00:02:44.290> not<00:02:44.410> sure<00:02:44.560> which<00:02:44.739> one<00:02:44.800> is<00:02:45.160> is<00:02:46.019> for

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:47.019 
you're not sure which one is is for

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:48.870 
you're not sure which one is is for
which<00:02:47.200> one<00:02:47.350> has<00:02:47.470> been<00:02:47.620> used<00:02:47.860> and<00:02:48.550> you<00:02:48.670> just

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
which one has been used and you just

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.570 
which one has been used and you just
plug<00:02:49.030> them<00:02:49.150> in<00:02:49.300> it'll<00:02:49.600> tell<00:02:49.810> you<00:02:49.959> and<00:02:50.400> so<00:02:51.400> yeah

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
plug them in it'll tell you and so yeah

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.430 
plug them in it'll tell you and so yeah
and<00:02:51.610> as<00:02:52.180> you<00:02:52.269> can<00:02:52.390> see<00:02:52.450> it<00:02:52.959> automatically

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
and as you can see it automatically

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.640 
and as you can see it automatically
detects<00:02:54.070> and<00:02:54.840> that<00:02:55.840> these<00:02:55.959> batches<00:02:56.260> in<00:02:56.410> and

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
detects and that these batches in and

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.490 
detects and that these batches in and
begins<00:02:57.010> charging<00:02:57.220> them

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
begins charging them

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.700 
begins charging them
okay<00:02:59.220> so<00:02:59.600> that's<00:03:00.600> some<00:03:00.900> sort<00:03:01.350> of<00:03:01.410> pin<00:03:01.560> like

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:01.710 
okay so that's some sort of pin like

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:03.290 
okay so that's some sort of pin like
that<00:03:01.860> reason<00:03:02.220> as<00:03:02.310> I<00:03:02.400> said<00:03:02.580> it<00:03:02.670> takes<00:03:02.790> a<00:03:02.940> a<00:03:02.970> as

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
that reason as I said it takes a a as

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.570 
that reason as I said it takes a a as
well<00:03:03.480> as<00:03:03.570> the<00:03:03.750> smaller<00:03:04.170> one<00:03:04.350> fillets<00:03:04.830> also<00:03:05.310> 15

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
well as the smaller one fillets also 15

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.950 
well as the smaller one fillets also 15
yeah<00:03:07.670> okay<00:03:08.670> okay

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:09.960 
yeah okay okay

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.170 
yeah okay okay
so<00:03:10.260> mobile<00:03:10.950> phone<00:03:11.160> something<00:03:11.550> at<00:03:11.640> you<00:03:11.700> pretty

so mobile phone something at you pretty

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.370 
so mobile phone something at you pretty
much<00:03:13.550> everyone's<00:03:14.550> gonna<00:03:14.670> want<00:03:14.910> to<00:03:14.970> charge<00:03:15.380> at

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
much everyone's gonna want to charge at

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.470 
much everyone's gonna want to charge at
some<00:03:16.560> time<00:03:16.770> and<00:03:17.550> you<00:03:17.970> do<00:03:18.090> have<00:03:18.150> to<00:03:18.240> take<00:03:18.390> the

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
some time and you do have to take the

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:23.690 
some time and you do have to take the
battery<00:03:18.750> out<00:03:20.810> thing<00:03:21.810> and<00:03:22.680> then<00:03:23.160> I<00:03:23.370> don't<00:03:23.670> know

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
battery out thing and then I don't know

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.760 
battery out thing and then I don't know
if<00:03:23.790> you<00:03:23.880> can<00:03:24.000> see<00:03:24.720> ya<00:03:25.140> got<00:03:25.410> these<00:03:25.500> two<00:03:25.680> little

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:25.770 
if you can see ya got these two little

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:33.680 
if you can see ya got these two little
pins<00:03:26.070> down<00:03:26.280> here<00:03:27.770> and<00:03:30.890> these<00:03:31.970> so<00:03:32.970> basically

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
pins down here and these so basically

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.900 
pins down here and these so basically
the<00:03:34.260> idea<00:03:34.290> of<00:03:34.680> either<00:03:34.800> what<00:03:35.459> you<00:03:35.490> do<00:03:35.700> is<00:03:35.790> you

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
the idea of either what you do is you

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:41.270 
the idea of either what you do is you
just<00:03:35.940> to<00:03:36.560> put<00:03:37.560> the<00:03:37.680> battery<00:03:38.959> in<00:03:39.959> there<00:03:40.380> and

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
just to put the battery in there and

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.430 
just to put the battery in there and
then<00:03:41.670> this<00:03:42.180> thing<00:03:42.390> comes<00:03:42.570> with<00:03:42.720> it<00:03:42.870> and<00:03:43.110> lift<00:03:43.320> a

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
then this thing comes with it and lift a

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:48.020 
then this thing comes with it and lift a
little<00:03:44.240> stylus<00:03:45.240> but<00:03:46.250> into<00:03:47.250> the<00:03:47.370> side<00:03:47.850> of<00:03:47.880> the

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
little stylus but into the side of the

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:49.940 
little stylus but into the side of the
device<00:03:48.270> by<00:03:48.450> there<00:03:48.600> what<00:03:49.410> you<00:03:49.530> do<00:03:49.680> is<00:03:49.800> you<00:03:49.920> just

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
device by there what you do is you just

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.380 
device by there what you do is you just
line<00:03:50.310> up<00:03:50.570> these<00:03:51.570> pins

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:53.390 
line up these pins

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:56.020 
line up these pins
closer<00:03:54.050> closer<00:03:54.590> you<00:03:54.800> can<00:03:54.890> see<00:03:54.950> none<00:03:55.790> of<00:03:55.940> these

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030 
closer closer you can see none of these

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:58.660 
closer closer you can see none of these
fans<00:03:56.330> over<00:03:56.510> here<00:03:56.920> with<00:03:57.920> the<00:03:58.010> plus<00:03:58.220> and<00:03:58.250> minus

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:58.670 
fans over here with the plus and minus

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:04.560 
fans over here with the plus and minus
signs<00:03:58.700> on<00:03:59.120> the<00:03:59.240> back<00:03:59.660> see<00:03:59.810> over<00:03:59.960> there<00:04:03.220> see

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:04.570 
signs on the back see over there see

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:07.240 
signs on the back see over there see
okay<00:04:05.570> and<00:04:06.080> then<00:04:06.200> you<00:04:06.290> just<00:04:06.470> twist<00:04:06.650> the<00:04:06.920> battery

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.250 
okay and then you just twist the battery

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:10.860 
okay and then you just twist the battery
up<00:04:07.750> as<00:04:08.750> you<00:04:08.870> can<00:04:09.020> see<00:04:09.200> it<00:04:09.860> automatically

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:10.870 
up as you can see it automatically

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:15.180 
up as you can see it automatically
detects<00:04:11.870> that<00:04:13.300> the<00:04:14.300> battery<00:04:14.570> is<00:04:14.600> there<00:04:14.810> and

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:15.190 
detects that the battery is there and

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:17.650 
detects that the battery is there and
tells<00:04:16.190> me<00:04:16.280> that<00:04:16.400> the<00:04:16.519> 24<00:04:16.910> percent<00:04:17.209> charge<00:04:17.420> left

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:17.660 
tells me that the 24 percent charge left

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:20.259 
tells me that the 24 percent charge left
in<00:04:17.780> it<00:04:17.870> and<00:04:18.370> as<00:04:19.370> with<00:04:19.609> the<00:04:19.730> pen<00:04:20.030> like<00:04:20.150> that

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:20.269 
in it and as with the pen like that

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:22.390 
in it and as with the pen like that
means<00:04:20.480> it's<00:04:20.750> not<00:04:20.989> just<00:04:21.049> starting<00:04:21.620> to<00:04:21.859> charge

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
means it's not just starting to charge

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.659 
means it's not just starting to charge
the<00:04:22.910> battery<00:04:24.010> fantastic<00:04:25.010> so<00:04:25.190> you<00:04:25.460> know<00:04:25.550> that's

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:25.669 
the battery fantastic so you know that's

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:27.760 
the battery fantastic so you know that's
really<00:04:25.970> easy<00:04:26.090> it<00:04:26.540> also<00:04:26.770> automatically

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:27.770 
really easy it also automatically

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:31.420 
really easy it also automatically
detects<00:04:28.100> what<00:04:28.370> the<00:04:28.970> amount<00:04:29.210> of<00:04:30.430> efficiently

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:31.430 
detects what the amount of efficiently

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:32.409 
detects what the amount of efficiently
the<00:04:31.490> amount<00:04:31.700> of<00:04:31.730> current<00:04:32.000> or<00:04:32.090> whatever<00:04:32.300> it

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:32.419 
the amount of current or whatever it

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:35.710 
the amount of current or whatever it
needs<00:04:32.540> to<00:04:33.910> charge<00:04:34.910> the<00:04:35.030> battery<00:04:35.300> collected

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:35.720 
needs to charge the battery collected

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.590 
needs to charge the battery collected
correctly<00:04:36.310> okay<00:04:37.310> so<00:04:37.370> let's<00:04:38.150> try<00:04:38.330> another

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:38.600 
correctly okay so let's try another

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:41.409 
correctly okay so let's try another
thing<00:04:38.919> actually<00:04:39.919> for<00:04:40.280> my<00:04:40.400> camera<00:04:41.030> and<00:04:41.330> then

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:41.419 
thing actually for my camera and then

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:43.180 
thing actually for my camera and then
the<00:04:41.450> actual<00:04:41.720> camera<00:04:42.020> that's<00:04:42.140> filming<00:04:43.100> this

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:43.190 
the actual camera that's filming this

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:49.530 
the actual camera that's filming this
video<00:04:45.310> so<00:04:46.310> this<00:04:46.700> is<00:04:46.910> the<00:04:47.000> usual<00:04:47.150> charger

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:49.540 
video so this is the usual charger

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:54.010 
video so this is the usual charger
here's<00:04:50.540> the<00:04:50.630> battery<00:04:51.400> again<00:04:52.400> and<00:04:53.300> slightly

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:54.020 
here's the battery again and slightly

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:58.630 
here's the battery again and slightly
different<00:04:54.410> and<00:04:54.560> then<00:04:54.650> that<00:04:54.830> the<00:04:55.330> the<00:04:57.640> charging

00:04:58.630 --> 00:04:58.640 
different and then that the the charging

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:00.040 
different and then that the the charging
plates<00:04:58.850> like<00:04:58.970> that<00:04:59.150> they're<00:04:59.780> not<00:04:59.900> really

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:00.050 
plates like that they're not really

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:02.950 
plates like that they're not really
visible<00:05:00.380> they're<00:05:00.620> sort<00:05:01.100> of<00:05:01.870> inside<00:05:02.870> these

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:02.960 
visible they're sort of inside these

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:06.219 
visible they're sort of inside these
little<00:05:03.760> hidden<00:05:04.760> hidden<00:05:05.120> things<00:05:05.390> so<00:05:05.810> it's

00:05:06.219 --> 00:05:06.229 
little hidden hidden things so it's

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:12.659 
little hidden hidden things so it's
exactly<00:05:06.590> the<00:05:06.740> same<00:05:06.890> thing<00:05:06.950> I<00:05:09.880> just<00:05:10.880> need<00:05:11.240> to

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:12.669 
exactly the same thing I just need to

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:16.120 
exactly the same thing I just need to
put<00:05:13.669> the<00:05:13.760> battery<00:05:14.030> in<00:05:14.120> like<00:05:14.270> this<00:05:14.419> again<00:05:15.130> use

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:16.130 
put the battery in like this again use

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:18.290
