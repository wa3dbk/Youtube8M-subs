hey guys what's up it's monkeys monkey
so<00:00:02.310> I<00:00:02.340> had<00:00:02.939> an<00:00:03.090> idea<00:00:03.210> to<00:00:03.929> do<00:00:04.080> some<00:00:04.290> DPS<00:00:04.740> testing

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
so I had an idea to do some DPS testing

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.430 
so I had an idea to do some DPS testing
with<00:00:05.790> the<00:00:05.940> three<00:00:06.150> combat<00:00:06.480> styles<00:00:06.870> and<00:00:07.200> see

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
with the three combat styles and see

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.740 
with the three combat styles and see
which<00:00:07.649> is<00:00:07.680> the<00:00:07.859> best<00:00:08.160> for<00:00:08.340> DPS<00:00:08.730> there<00:00:09.660> have

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
which is the best for DPS there have

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.209 
which is the best for DPS there have
been<00:00:09.809> a<00:00:09.870> ton<00:00:10.080> of<00:00:10.139> arguments<00:00:10.650> over<00:00:10.769> this<00:00:10.950> ever

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
been a ton of arguments over this ever

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:12.770 
been a ton of arguments over this ever
since<00:00:11.460> the<00:00:11.610> evolution<00:00:12.030> of<00:00:12.120> combat<00:00:12.300> came<00:00:12.630> out

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
since the evolution of combat came out

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.350 
since the evolution of combat came out
most<00:00:13.380> people's<00:00:13.740> opinion<00:00:13.860> seems<00:00:14.490> to<00:00:14.610> be<00:00:14.759> that

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
most people's opinion seems to be that

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.779 
most people's opinion seems to be that
drag<00:00:16.170> ores<00:00:16.410> are<00:00:16.529> the<00:00:16.680> best<00:00:16.859> dps<00:00:17.310> unless<00:00:17.609> you

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
drag ores are the best dps unless you

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.400 
drag ores are the best dps unless you
have<00:00:17.910> seismics<00:00:18.449> most<00:00:18.750> people<00:00:19.050> do<00:00:19.140> not<00:00:19.260> have

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
have seismics most people do not have

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.950 
have seismics most people do not have
seismics<00:00:20.010> I<00:00:20.100> do<00:00:20.430> not<00:00:20.760> have<00:00:20.880> seismics<00:00:21.420> so<00:00:21.689> I<00:00:21.720> was

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
seismics I do not have seismics so I was

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.769 
seismics I do not have seismics so I was
not<00:00:22.109> able<00:00:22.260> to<00:00:22.410> test<00:00:22.710> them<00:00:23.390> however<00:00:24.390> for<00:00:24.660> my

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
not able to test them however for my

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.410 
not able to test them however for my
testing<00:00:25.289> I<00:00:25.590> imagine<00:00:26.400> seismics<00:00:26.910> would<00:00:27.150> be<00:00:27.300> the

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
testing I imagine seismics would be the

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.480 
testing I imagine seismics would be the
best<00:00:27.599> dps<00:00:28.050> if<00:00:28.230> I<00:00:28.320> ever<00:00:28.470> get<00:00:28.740> myself<00:00:28.949> a<00:00:29.250> pair<00:00:29.429> of

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
best dps if I ever get myself a pair of

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.569 
best dps if I ever get myself a pair of
them<00:00:29.730> I<00:00:29.849> will<00:00:30.029> test<00:00:30.300> for<00:00:30.570> you<00:00:30.769> but<00:00:31.769> if<00:00:32.189> you<00:00:32.430> are

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
them I will test for you but if you are

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.400 
them I will test for you but if you are

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
my tests you might not get the exact

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.709 
my tests you might not get the exact
same<00:00:59.969> results<00:01:00.539> so<00:01:01.170> yeah<00:01:01.949> try<00:01:02.280> not<00:01:02.309> to<00:01:02.719> state

testing these against kbd which has

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.770 
testing these against kbd which has
pretty<00:01:10.920> low<00:01:11.130> life<00:01:11.369> points<00:01:11.880> but<00:01:12.150> he<00:01:12.390> does<00:01:12.630> have

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
pretty low life points but he does have

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.980 
pretty low life points but he does have
enough<00:01:13.020> life<00:01:13.200> points<00:01:13.530> to<00:01:13.650> get<00:01:13.830> up<00:01:14.040> to<00:01:14.460> a<00:01:14.990> altima

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
enough life points to get up to a altima

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.499 
enough life points to get up to a altima
bility<00:01:16.320> and<00:01:16.470> use<00:01:16.650> a<00:01:16.680> fair<00:01:17.009> few<00:01:17.189> I<00:01:17.430> also<00:01:18.270> did

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
bility and use a fair few I also did

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.690 
bility and use a fair few I also did
some<00:01:18.540> testing<00:01:19.020> between<00:01:19.500> ultimate<00:01:20.070> abilities

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
some testing between ultimate abilities

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.670 
some testing between ultimate abilities
versus<00:01:21.090> using<00:01:21.360> using<00:01:21.869> thresholds<00:01:22.409> and<00:01:22.500> kind

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
versus using using thresholds and kind

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.530 
versus using using thresholds and kind
of<00:01:22.740> lower<00:01:22.950> hit<00:01:23.159> point<00:01:23.369> bosses<00:01:23.729> so<00:01:24.060> this<00:01:24.390> might

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
of lower hit point bosses so this might

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.240 
of lower hit point bosses so this might
be<00:01:24.659> useful<00:01:24.810> information<00:01:25.080> to<00:01:25.470> use<00:01:25.560> it<00:01:25.710> like<00:01:25.799> QbD

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
be useful information to use it like QbD

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.340 
be useful information to use it like QbD
or<00:01:26.430> bosses<00:01:26.670> where<00:01:27.119> you<00:01:27.570> could<00:01:27.810> either<00:01:27.960> use<00:01:28.080> an

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
or bosses where you could either use an

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.160 
or bosses where you could either use an
ultimate<00:01:28.710> or<00:01:28.890> thresholds<00:01:29.549> most<00:01:29.820> of<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:29.970> time

ultimate or thresholds most of the time

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.230 
ultimate or thresholds most of the time
but<00:01:31.170> anyway<00:01:31.560> I<00:01:31.799> do<00:01:32.340> gotta<00:01:32.579> say<00:01:32.790> that<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.030> idea

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
but anyway I do gotta say that the idea

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.319 
but anyway I do gotta say that the idea
of<00:01:33.630> testing<00:01:33.810> this<00:01:34.049> out<00:01:34.170> at<00:01:34.350> QB<00:01:34.680> kbd<00:01:35.579> was<00:01:36.119> kind

probably<00:01:41.880> doubt<00:01:42.390> he<00:01:42.630> even<00:01:42.659> knows<00:01:42.960> who<00:01:43.259> I<00:01:43.350> am

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
probably doubt he even knows who I am

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.530 
probably doubt he even knows who I am
but<00:01:44.159> I<00:01:44.220> was<00:01:44.340> just<00:01:44.490> watching<00:01:44.790> one<00:01:45.390> of<00:01:45.420> his

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
but I was just watching one of his

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.569 
but I was just watching one of his
testing<00:01:46.500> videos<00:01:46.799> and<00:01:47.040> that's<00:01:47.100> where<00:01:47.369> I<00:01:47.399> got

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
testing videos and that's where I got

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.210 
testing videos and that's where I got
the<00:01:47.729> idea<00:01:48.090> to<00:01:48.329> make<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.810> Q<00:01:48.990> beat<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.439> testing

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
the idea to make the Q beat the testing

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.280 
the idea to make the Q beat the testing
out<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.430> KBD<00:01:50.909> so<00:01:51.509> of<00:01:51.750> course<00:01:51.899> I<00:01:52.079> have<00:01:52.170> to

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
out the KBD so of course I have to

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.170 
out the KBD so of course I have to
credit<00:01:52.380> him<00:01:52.649> for<00:01:52.680> that<00:01:52.920> but<00:01:53.159> anyway<00:01:53.490> we're

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
credit him for that but anyway we're

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.389 
credit him for that but anyway we're
gonna<00:01:54.240> move<00:01:54.659> on<00:01:54.930> into<00:01:55.320> the<00:01:55.560> video<00:01:55.829> and<00:01:56.130> show

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
gonna move on into the video and show

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.510 
gonna move on into the video and show
you<00:01:56.460> guys<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.670> results<00:01:56.939> that<00:01:57.299> I<00:01:57.329> got<00:01:57.509> and<00:01:57.840> yeah

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
you guys the results that I got and yeah

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.889 
you guys the results that I got and yeah
some<00:01:59.520> of<00:01:59.640> you<00:01:59.729> may<00:01:59.909> be<00:01:59.939> surprised<00:02:00.540> with<00:02:00.719> how

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
some of you may be surprised with how

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:01.880 
some of you may be surprised with how
this<00:02:01.079> turned<00:02:01.140> out

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
this turned out

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.950 
this turned out
I'll<00:02:02.310> just<00:02:02.579> give<00:02:02.790> a<00:02:02.820> hint<00:02:03.030> here<00:02:03.270> and<00:02:03.390> say<00:02:03.540> melee

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
I'll just give a hint here and say melee

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.810 
I'll just give a hint here and say melee
might<00:02:04.200> not<00:02:04.380> dominate<00:02:04.950> as<00:02:05.070> much<00:02:05.310> as<00:02:05.490> you<00:02:05.610> guys

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
might not dominate as much as you guys

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.499 
might not dominate as much as you guys
think<00:02:07.429> okay<00:02:08.429> so<00:02:08.459> now<00:02:08.729> we're<00:02:08.910> getting<00:02:09.030> into<00:02:09.270> the

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
think okay so now we're getting into the

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.229 
think okay so now we're getting into the
KBT<00:02:10.050> kills<00:02:10.319> themselves<00:02:10.890> I<00:02:11.160> start<00:02:12.090> off<00:02:12.209> with

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
KBT kills themselves I start off with

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.760 
KBT kills themselves I start off with
magic<00:02:12.690> because<00:02:12.989> as<00:02:13.170> you<00:02:13.319> may<00:02:13.470> have

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
magic because as you may have

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.540 
magic because as you may have
it<00:02:14.010> was<00:02:14.130> the<00:02:14.280> slowest<00:02:14.820> but<00:02:15.150> not<00:02:15.570> by<00:02:15.780> much<00:02:15.990> so

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
it was the slowest but not by much so

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.890 
it was the slowest but not by much so
melee<00:02:17.550> and<00:02:17.700> range<00:02:17.970> with<00:02:18.270> the<00:02:18.390> level<00:02:18.630> 90

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
melee and range with the level 90

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.690 
melee and range with the level 90
weapons<00:02:19.230> were<00:02:19.380> faster<00:02:19.920> than<00:02:19.950> chaotic<00:02:20.430> staff

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
weapons were faster than chaotic staff

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.730 
weapons were faster than chaotic staff
but<00:02:20.940> only<00:02:21.150> by<00:02:21.450> a<00:02:21.480> couple<00:02:21.750> seconds<00:02:22.320> which<00:02:22.500> kind

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
but only by a couple seconds which kind

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.170 
but only by a couple seconds which kind
of<00:02:22.800> surprised<00:02:23.160> me<00:02:23.310> because<00:02:23.400> chaotic<00:02:23.880> stuff<00:02:24.060> is

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
of surprised me because chaotic stuff is

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:25.250 
of surprised me because chaotic stuff is
pretty<00:02:24.570> darn<00:02:24.870> good

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
pretty darn good

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.410 
pretty darn good
I<00:02:25.290> didn't<00:02:25.980> already<00:02:26.190> know<00:02:26.400> that<00:02:26.790> magic<00:02:27.090> is

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
I didn't already know that magic is

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.870 
I didn't already know that magic is
better<00:02:27.660> DPS<00:02:28.200> than<00:02:28.590> range<00:02:29.190> in<00:02:29.400> mage<00:02:29.580> of<00:02:29.760> the

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
better DPS than range in mage of the

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.790 
better DPS than range in mage of the
same<00:02:30.090> tier<00:02:30.360> I<00:02:30.540> think<00:02:31.080> that's<00:02:31.230> pretty<00:02:31.410> commonly

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
same tier I think that's pretty commonly

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.320 
same tier I think that's pretty commonly
known<00:02:31.980> knowledge<00:02:32.370> but<00:02:32.700> still<00:02:32.910> I<00:02:32.940> didn't<00:02:33.240> know

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
known knowledge but still I didn't know

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.590 
known knowledge but still I didn't know
he<00:02:33.510> was<00:02:33.660> nearly<00:02:34.140> as<00:02:34.470> good<00:02:34.710> as<00:02:35.420> ascensions<00:02:36.420> and

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
he was nearly as good as ascensions and

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.120 
he was nearly as good as ascensions and
drag<00:02:36.750> ores<00:02:36.960> so<00:02:37.200> that<00:02:37.410> was<00:02:37.590> kind<00:02:37.800> of<00:02:37.860> shocking

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
drag ores so that was kind of shocking

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:39.530 
drag ores so that was kind of shocking
essentially<00:02:38.670> the<00:02:38.760> drivers<00:02:39.060> are<00:02:39.180> still<00:02:39.330> better

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
essentially the drivers are still better

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.900 
essentially the drivers are still better
just<00:02:39.840> not<00:02:40.050> by<00:02:40.170> a<00:02:40.200> lot<00:02:40.380> but<00:02:40.560> anyway<00:02:41.460> one<00:02:41.700> thing<00:02:41.850> I

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
just not by a lot but anyway one thing I

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.090 
just not by a lot but anyway one thing I
do<00:02:41.970> got<00:02:42.180> to<00:02:42.210> say<00:02:42.450> is<00:02:42.660> sunshine<00:02:43.470> and<00:02:43.710> death

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
do got to say is sunshine and death

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:45.560 
do got to say is sunshine and death
swiftness<00:02:44.430> did<00:02:44.610> not<00:02:44.730> work<00:02:44.910> very<00:02:44.940> well<00:02:45.180> here

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
swiftness did not work very well here

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.930 
swiftness did not work very well here
those<00:02:46.020> abilities<00:02:46.320> last<00:02:46.710> for<00:02:47.100> 10<00:02:47.640> seconds

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
those abilities last for 10 seconds

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.610 
those abilities last for 10 seconds
longer<00:02:48.120> in<00:02:48.240> the<00:02:48.300> search<00:02:48.510> for<00:02:49.080> a<00:02:49.140> melee<00:02:49.470> for

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
longer in the search for a melee for

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:50.780 
longer in the search for a melee for
example<00:02:50.100> but<00:02:50.220> they<00:02:50.310> don't<00:02:50.460> give<00:02:50.580> as<00:02:50.670> much

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
example but they don't give as much

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.820 
example but they don't give as much
bonus<00:02:51.150> to<00:02:51.240> give<00:02:51.390> 50%<00:02:51.750> extra<00:02:52.290> damage<00:02:52.440> instead

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
bonus to give 50% extra damage instead

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.100 
bonus to give 50% extra damage instead
of<00:02:53.040> a<00:02:53.070> hundred<00:02:53.520> percent<00:02:53.610> extra<00:02:53.940> damage<00:02:54.420> so

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
of a hundred percent extra damage so

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:56.720 
of a hundred percent extra damage so
yeah<00:02:55.710> they<00:02:55.890> aren't<00:02:56.070> quite<00:02:56.250> as<00:02:56.400> good<00:02:56.550> here

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
yeah they aren't quite as good here

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.520 
yeah they aren't quite as good here
mostly<00:02:57.060> just<00:02:57.180> because<00:02:57.510> you<00:02:57.900> can't<00:02:58.170> take<00:02:58.350> full

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
mostly just because you can't take full

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.890 
mostly just because you can't take full
advantage<00:02:58.950> of<00:02:59.130> the<00:02:59.370> the<00:02:59.700> Sun<00:02:59.910> sunshine<00:03:00.780> or

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
advantage of the the Sun sunshine or

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.690 
advantage of the the Sun sunshine or
death<00:03:01.080> swiftness<00:03:01.410> because<00:03:01.620> KBD<00:03:02.070> dies<00:03:02.280> about

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
death swiftness because KBD dies about

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.000 
death swiftness because KBD dies about
15<00:03:03.480> to<00:03:03.600> 20<00:03:03.840> seconds<00:03:04.140> after<00:03:04.320> you<00:03:04.530> activate<00:03:04.980> your

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
15 to 20 seconds after you activate your

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.280 
15 to 20 seconds after you activate your
ultimate<00:03:05.520> so<00:03:05.670> you<00:03:05.790> can't<00:03:06.150> really<00:03:06.540> take<00:03:06.960> full

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
ultimate so you can't really take full

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.260 
ultimate so you can't really take full
effect<00:03:07.800> of<00:03:07.920> the<00:03:07.980> sunshine<00:03:08.490> and<00:03:08.760> def<00:03:08.880> swiftness

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:09.270 
effect of the sunshine and def swiftness

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:11.060 
effect of the sunshine and def swiftness
so<00:03:09.780> I<00:03:09.810> will<00:03:10.020> have<00:03:10.170> to<00:03:10.320> test<00:03:10.560> this<00:03:10.740> on<00:03:10.950> different

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.070 
so I will have to test this on different

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:13.730 
so I will have to test this on different
bosses<00:03:11.670> with<00:03:12.030> the<00:03:12.120> same<00:03:12.360> sort<00:03:13.050> of<00:03:13.140> style<00:03:13.380> if

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:13.740 
bosses with the same sort of style if

bosses or what monsters you would like

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.460 
bosses or what monsters you would like
to<00:03:17.820> see<00:03:18.030> tests<00:03:18.420> on<00:03:18.510> and<00:03:18.720> what<00:03:18.900> those<00:03:19.050> tests

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
to see tests on and what those tests

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.290 
to see tests on and what those tests
would<00:03:19.590> be<00:03:19.710> like<00:03:19.950> if<00:03:20.100> you<00:03:20.130> wanted<00:03:20.490> to<00:03:20.670> see

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:21.300 
would be like if you wanted to see

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.480 
would be like if you wanted to see
ascensions<00:03:21.750> versus<00:03:22.080> drag<00:03:22.350> ores<00:03:22.590> or<00:03:22.980> dragon

ascensions versus drag ores or dragon

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:25.220 
ascensions versus drag ores or dragon

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
wars vs chaotic staff on a certain

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.040 
wars vs chaotic staff on a certain
monster<00:03:25.550> I<00:03:26.550> mean<00:03:27.120> obviously<00:03:27.240> I<00:03:27.570> can't<00:03:27.840> test

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.050 
monster I mean obviously I can't test

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:29.570 
monster I mean obviously I can't test
seismics<00:03:28.590> but<00:03:28.710> I<00:03:28.740> can<00:03:28.950> test<00:03:29.160> just<00:03:29.400> about

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.580 
seismics but I can test just about

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:32.570 
seismics but I can test just about
anything<00:03:29.880> else<00:03:30.380> so<00:03:31.380> yeah<00:03:31.980> that<00:03:32.190> we're<00:03:32.400> going

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.580 
anything else so yeah that we're going

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.610 
anything else so yeah that we're going
to<00:03:32.670> the<00:03:32.910> magic<00:03:33.210> threshold<00:03:33.390> now<00:03:33.780> which<00:03:33.930> was<00:03:34.140> 40

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
to the magic threshold now which was 40

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.310 
to the magic threshold now which was 40
seconds<00:03:35.150> the<00:03:36.150> magic<00:03:36.600> I<00:03:36.720> do<00:03:36.810> have<00:03:37.050> all<00:03:37.200> the

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:37.320 
seconds the magic I do have all the

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.080 
seconds the magic I do have all the
times<00:03:37.560> up<00:03:37.740> on<00:03:37.860> the<00:03:37.980> screen<00:03:38.250> the<00:03:38.490> magic

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
times up on the screen the magic

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.560 
times up on the screen the magic
sunshine<00:03:39.390> was<00:03:39.840> 43<00:03:40.410> seconds<00:03:40.860> so<00:03:41.820> the<00:03:42.090> magic<00:03:42.270> was

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:42.570 
sunshine was 43 seconds so the magic was

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:44.660 
sunshine was 43 seconds so the magic was
sunshine<00:03:42.780> was<00:03:43.140> the<00:03:43.260> slowest<00:03:43.740> out<00:03:43.980> of<00:03:44.160> all<00:03:44.430> the

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
sunshine was the slowest out of all the

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:46.310 
sunshine was the slowest out of all the
kills<00:03:44.880> which<00:03:45.150> I<00:03:45.300> kind<00:03:45.540> of<00:03:45.600> expected<00:03:46.080> it<00:03:46.230> would

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:46.320 
kills which I kind of expected it would

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.530 
kills which I kind of expected it would
be<00:03:46.530> but<00:03:47.250> it<00:03:47.340> was<00:03:47.430> almost<00:03:47.640> exactly<00:03:48.360> the<00:03:48.510> same

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
be but it was almost exactly the same

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.600 
be but it was almost exactly the same
speed<00:03:49.020> as<00:03:49.200> range<00:03:49.830> with<00:03:50.010> ascensions<00:03:50.460> with

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:50.610 
speed as range with ascensions with

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:52.280 
speed as range with ascensions with
death<00:03:50.820> swiftness<00:03:51.270> so<00:03:51.540> that<00:03:52.020> was<00:03:52.110> a<00:03:52.140> bit

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
death swiftness so that was a bit

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.080 
death swiftness so that was a bit
interesting<00:03:52.740> the<00:03:53.160> neck<00:03:53.340> next<00:03:53.610> we<00:03:53.730> go<00:03:53.880> into

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
interesting the neck next we go into

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:58.820 
interesting the neck next we go into
melee<00:03:54.560> so<00:03:55.560> melee<00:03:56.070> was<00:03:56.250> zerk<00:03:56.840> activated<00:03:57.840> was<00:03:58.050> 38

00:03:58.820 --> 00:03:58.830 
melee so melee was zerk activated was 38

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:01.190 
melee so melee was zerk activated was 38
second<00:03:59.280> kill<00:03:59.430> with<00:04:00.060> the<00:04:00.180> melee<00:04:00.480> ones<00:04:00.900> I<00:04:01.050> did

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
second kill with the melee ones I did

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.570 
second kill with the melee ones I did
several<00:04:01.440> kills<00:04:01.800> for<00:04:02.040> the<00:04:02.130> magic<00:04:02.400> and<00:04:02.520> ranged

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:02.580 
several kills for the magic and ranged

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:04.100 
several kills for the magic and ranged
only<00:04:02.910> can<00:04:03.030> did<00:04:03.180> two<00:04:03.360> kills<00:04:03.630> for<00:04:03.840> each<00:04:03.900> style

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.110 
only can did two kills for each style

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:06.590 
only can did two kills for each style
and<00:04:04.440> with<00:04:05.010> the<00:04:05.130> melee<00:04:05.460> like<00:04:05.850> zerk<00:04:06.090> I<00:04:06.270> did<00:04:06.420> about

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:06.600 
and with the melee like zerk I did about

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.090 
and with the melee like zerk I did about
10<00:04:06.870> kills<00:04:07.110> with<00:04:07.260> it<00:04:07.380> and<00:04:07.470> they're<00:04:07.560> all<00:04:07.590> like

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:08.100 
10 kills with it and they're all like

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.190 
10 kills with it and they're all like
exactly<00:04:08.670> the<00:04:08.820> same<00:04:08.970> speed<00:04:09.240> they<00:04:09.390> are<00:04:09.420> all<00:04:09.660> 32

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
exactly the same speed they are all 32

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.290 
exactly the same speed they are all 32
eight<00:04:10.410> seconds<00:04:10.920> and<00:04:10.980> one<00:04:11.160> was<00:04:11.340> 39<00:04:11.760> seconds<00:04:12.180> so

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:12.300 
eight seconds and one was 39 seconds so

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:13.850 
eight seconds and one was 39 seconds so
I<00:04:12.330> thought<00:04:12.600> there's<00:04:12.959> no<00:04:13.020> point<00:04:13.140> in<00:04:13.530> testing

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:13.860 
I thought there's no point in testing

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:15.080 
I thought there's no point in testing
these<00:04:13.980> over<00:04:14.220> and<00:04:14.340> over<00:04:14.430> again<00:04:14.610> if<00:04:14.850> they're<00:04:14.970> all

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
these over and over again if they're all

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:17.180 
these over and over again if they're all
going<00:04:15.240> to<00:04:15.300> be<00:04:15.420> the<00:04:15.510> same<00:04:15.690> speed<00:04:15.990> so<00:04:16.920> for<00:04:17.100> all

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
going to be the same speed so for all

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:19.120 
going to be the same speed so for all
the<00:04:17.340> range<00:04:17.549> in<00:04:17.730> magic<00:04:18.060> kills<00:04:18.239> I<00:04:18.420> only<00:04:18.600> did<00:04:18.900> two

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130 
the range in magic kills I only did two

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:22.310 
the range in magic kills I only did two
to<00:04:20.130> KBD<00:04:20.670> kills<00:04:20.940> per<00:04:21.330> style<00:04:21.840> so<00:04:21.960> I<00:04:22.020> did<00:04:22.169> two

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
to KBD kills per style so I did two

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:23.780 
to KBD kills per style so I did two
kills<00:04:22.560> with<00:04:22.710> thresholds<00:04:23.160> and<00:04:23.250> then<00:04:23.340> two<00:04:23.490> kills

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:23.790 
kills with thresholds and then two kills

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:26.140 
kills with thresholds and then two kills
with<00:04:24.060> death<00:04:24.600> swiftness<00:04:25.050> and

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.150 
with death swiftness and

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:28.310 
with death swiftness and
sunshine<00:04:27.150> and<00:04:27.300> they're<00:04:27.450> all<00:04:27.660> just<00:04:28.020> about<00:04:28.140> the

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.320 
sunshine and they're all just about the

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:29.990 
sunshine and they're all just about the
same<00:04:28.470> speed<00:04:28.680> so<00:04:28.860> that's<00:04:29.010> kind<00:04:29.220> of<00:04:29.280> what<00:04:29.970> I

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
same speed so that's kind of what I

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.360 
same speed so that's kind of what I
calculated<00:04:30.720> this<00:04:30.990> with<00:04:31.230> but<00:04:31.710> yeah<00:04:31.830> melee<00:04:32.220> was

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.370 
calculated this with but yeah melee was

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:33.860 
calculated this with but yeah melee was
zerk<00:04:32.670> was<00:04:33.240> pretty<00:04:33.480> good

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:33.870 
zerk was pretty good

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:35.840 
zerk was pretty good
you<00:04:34.290> still<00:04:34.470> get<00:04:34.590> a<00:04:34.620> few<00:04:34.860> seconds<00:04:35.220> left<00:04:35.460> over<00:04:35.820> of

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:35.850 
you still get a few seconds left over of

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:37.820 
you still get a few seconds left over of
zerk<00:04:36.180> after<00:04:36.510> KVD<00:04:36.930> dies<00:04:37.140> so<00:04:37.380> it's<00:04:37.530> a<00:04:37.590> bit<00:04:37.740> of

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 
zerk after KVD dies so it's a bit of

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:39.770 
zerk after KVD dies so it's a bit of
waste<00:04:38.040> and<00:04:38.430> obviously<00:04:38.910> was<00:04:39.060> using<00:04:39.330> revolution

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
waste and obviously was using revolution

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.290 
waste and obviously was using revolution
for<00:04:39.960> all<00:04:40.080> of<00:04:40.230> these<00:04:40.520> for<00:04:41.520> the<00:04:41.580> basics<00:04:41.940> at<00:04:42.090> least

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300 
for all of these for the basics at least

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:43.850 
for all of these for the basics at least
I<00:04:42.420> was<00:04:42.630> because<00:04:43.140> that<00:04:43.290> just<00:04:43.440> makes<00:04:43.620> it<00:04:43.800> a

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
I was because that just makes it a

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:45.050 
I was because that just makes it a
little<00:04:44.010> bit<00:04:44.160> more<00:04:44.250> fair<00:04:44.550> you<00:04:44.760> know<00:04:44.880> the

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:45.060 
little bit more fair you know the

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:46.850 
little bit more fair you know the
revolution<00:04:45.570> uses<00:04:45.960> the<00:04:46.140> abilities<00:04:46.500> all<00:04:46.680> at<00:04:46.770> the

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:46.860 
revolution uses the abilities all at the

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:48.620 
revolution uses the abilities all at the
same<00:04:47.010> speed<00:04:47.370> so<00:04:47.610> it's<00:04:47.730> gonna<00:04:47.850> be<00:04:48.060> more<00:04:48.240> exact

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:48.630 
same speed so it's gonna be more exact

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:50.210 
same speed so it's gonna be more exact
using<00:04:49.020> that<00:04:49.140> than<00:04:49.380> just<00:04:49.590> spamming<00:04:49.830> with<00:04:50.070> your

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220 
using that than just spamming with your

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:52.580 
using that than just spamming with your
fingers<00:04:50.550> and<00:04:51.360> the<00:04:51.480> next<00:04:51.750> was<00:04:51.930> melee<00:04:52.410> with

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.590 
fingers and the next was melee with

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:54.470 
fingers and the next was melee with
thresholds<00:04:53.190> using<00:04:53.820> assault<00:04:54.120> and<00:04:54.240> destroy

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:54.480 
thresholds using assault and destroy

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:55.340 
thresholds using assault and destroy
obviously<00:04:54.900> because<00:04:55.080> they're<00:04:55.200> the<00:04:55.320> best

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:55.350 
obviously because they're the best

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:58.490 
obviously because they're the best
thresholds<00:04:56.310> for<00:04:56.370> a<00:04:56.520> dual<00:04:56.670> wield<00:04:56.900> for<00:04:57.900> DPS<00:04:58.230> at

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:58.500 
thresholds for a dual wield for DPS at

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.460 
thresholds for a dual wield for DPS at
least<00:04:58.680> and<00:04:58.890> the<00:04:59.520> melee<00:04:59.970> thresholds<00:05:00.510> was<00:05:00.660> a<00:05:00.690> 37

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:01.470 
least and the melee thresholds was a 37

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:04.610 
least and the melee thresholds was a 37
second<00:05:01.920> on<00:05:02.040> average<00:05:02.550> speed<00:05:02.850> kill<00:05:03.440> so<00:05:04.440> that's

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:04.620 
second on average speed kill so that's

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:06.890 
second on average speed kill so that's
one<00:05:05.280> second<00:05:05.730> faster<00:05:06.060> on<00:05:06.120> average<00:05:06.450> than<00:05:06.660> zerk

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:06.900 
one second faster on average than zerk

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:08.930 
one second faster on average than zerk
but<00:05:07.140> again<00:05:07.380> just<00:05:07.620> you<00:05:08.250> know<00:05:08.370> taking<00:05:08.670> the<00:05:08.700> count

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:08.940 
but again just you know taking the count

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:11.240 
but again just you know taking the count
you<00:05:09.030> can't<00:05:09.330> take<00:05:10.140> full<00:05:10.380> advantage<00:05:10.920> of<00:05:11.070> the

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:11.250 
you can't take full advantage of the

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:12.740 
you can't take full advantage of the
zerk<00:05:11.490> and<00:05:11.730> this<00:05:12.030> guy<00:05:12.180> did<00:05:12.360> come<00:05:12.510> in<00:05:12.630> during

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:12.750 
zerk and this guy did come in during

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:14.120 
zerk and this guy did come in during
this<00:05:12.870> kill<00:05:13.080> but<00:05:13.200> he<00:05:13.230> didn't<00:05:13.530> do<00:05:13.590> any<00:05:13.770> damage<00:05:14.100> so

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:14.130 
this kill but he didn't do any damage so

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:16.040 
this kill but he didn't do any damage so
it<00:05:14.340> didn't<00:05:14.550> affect<00:05:14.790> the<00:05:15.480> speed<00:05:15.660> to<00:05:15.780> the<00:05:15.870> kill

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:16.050 
it didn't affect the speed to the kill

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:18.770 
it didn't affect the speed to the kill
at<00:05:16.140> all<00:05:16.260> so<00:05:16.650> that's<00:05:16.710> okay<00:05:17.150> but<00:05:18.150> yeah<00:05:18.360> it<00:05:18.570> does

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:18.780 
at all so that's okay but yeah it does

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:20.660 
at all so that's okay but yeah it does
you<00:05:19.110> don't<00:05:19.320> get<00:05:19.410> full<00:05:19.650> effect<00:05:19.920> at<00:05:20.070> the<00:05:20.160> zerk<00:05:20.340> so

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:20.670 
you don't get full effect at the zerk so

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:21.920 
you don't get full effect at the zerk so
just<00:05:21.090> keep<00:05:21.270> that<00:05:21.450> in<00:05:21.570> mind

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:21.930 
just keep that in mind

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:24.350 
just keep that in mind
zurk<00:05:22.560> might<00:05:22.800> be<00:05:22.920> better<00:05:23.070> if<00:05:23.340> KBT<00:05:23.850> had<00:05:24.000> a<00:05:24.030> little

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:24.360 
zurk might be better if KBT had a little

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:26.240 
zurk might be better if KBT had a little
bit<00:05:24.540> more<00:05:24.570> HP<00:05:24.840> that<00:05:25.260> remains<00:05:25.530> to<00:05:25.710> be<00:05:25.740> seen<00:05:25.830> and

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:26.250 
bit more HP that remains to be seen and

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:28.190 
bit more HP that remains to be seen and
the<00:05:26.730> next<00:05:26.970> was<00:05:27.120> range<00:05:27.390> with<00:05:27.600> death<00:05:27.810> swiftness

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:28.200 
the next was range with death swiftness

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:29.990 
the next was range with death swiftness
so<00:05:28.440> this<00:05:28.590> was<00:05:28.860> again<00:05:29.100> they<00:05:29.460> kind<00:05:29.700> of<00:05:29.790> failed

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:30.000 
so this was again they kind of failed

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.850 
so this was again they kind of failed
just<00:05:30.270> like<00:05:30.420> the<00:05:30.570> sunshine<00:05:30.810> this<00:05:31.260> was<00:05:31.410> 42

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:31.860 
just like the sunshine this was 42

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:36.350 
just like the sunshine this was 42
seconds<00:05:32.520> with<00:05:33.060> ascension<00:05:33.390> crossbows<00:05:35.150> so<00:05:36.150> yeah

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:36.360 
seconds with ascension crossbows so yeah

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:37.970 
seconds with ascension crossbows so yeah
again<00:05:36.720> you<00:05:37.020> can't<00:05:37.260> take<00:05:37.410> full<00:05:37.590> advantage<00:05:37.950> of

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:37.980 
again you can't take full advantage of

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:39.410 
again you can't take full advantage of
the<00:05:38.070> death<00:05:38.220> swiftness<00:05:38.580> so<00:05:38.700> that<00:05:38.850> might<00:05:39.030> be<00:05:39.060> why

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:39.420 
the death swiftness so that might be why

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:42.410 
the death swiftness so that might be why
if<00:05:40.410> KBT<00:05:40.950> had<00:05:41.190> more<00:05:41.400> health<00:05:41.610> like<00:05:41.880> if<00:05:42.060> you<00:05:42.180> could

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:42.420 
if KBT had more health like if you could

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:45.140 
if KBT had more health like if you could
fight<00:05:42.660> him<00:05:42.690> for<00:05:42.900> another<00:05:43.140> 15<00:05:43.560> or<00:05:43.770> 20<00:05:44.730> seconds

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:45.150 
fight him for another 15 or 20 seconds

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:46.370 
fight him for another 15 or 20 seconds
before<00:05:45.510> he<00:05:45.660> died

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:46.380 
before he died

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:48.890 
before he died
death<00:05:46.950> swiftness<00:05:47.400> and<00:05:47.610> sunshine<00:05:48.450> might<00:05:48.630> work

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:48.900 
death swiftness and sunshine might work

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:50.180 
death swiftness and sunshine might work
out<00:05:49.050> to<00:05:49.200> be<00:05:49.290> better<00:05:49.410> because<00:05:49.560> those<00:05:49.890> abilities

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:50.190 
out to be better because those abilities

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:53.300 
out to be better because those abilities
are<00:05:50.520> awesome<00:05:51.060> at<00:05:51.210> armadyl<00:05:51.780> and<00:05:52.650> bosses<00:05:53.130> like

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:53.310 
are awesome at armadyl and bosses like

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:54.950 
are awesome at armadyl and bosses like
that<00:05:53.520> where<00:05:53.760> you<00:05:53.880> can<00:05:54.060> use<00:05:54.240> your<00:05:54.390> thresholds

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:54.960 
that where you can use your thresholds

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:56.480 
that where you can use your thresholds
while<00:05:55.230> you're<00:05:55.560> in<00:05:55.770> sunshine<00:05:56.190> or<00:05:56.340> death

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:56.490 
while you're in sunshine or death

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:57.920 
while you're in sunshine or death
swiftness<00:05:56.850> that<00:05:57.150> those<00:05:57.360> are<00:05:57.510> just<00:05:57.600> crazy

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:57.930 
swiftness that those are just crazy

00:05:57.930 --> 00:05:59.450 
swiftness that those are just crazy
damage<00:05:58.230> so<00:05:58.530> those<00:05:58.650> are<00:05:58.830> really<00:05:59.010> good<00:05:59.220> there

00:05:59.450 --> 00:05:59.460 
damage so those are really good there

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:02.480 
damage so those are really good there
even<00:06:00.120> though<00:06:00.210> death<00:06:00.390> swiftness<00:06:00.810> and<00:06:01.490> rapid

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:02.490 
even though death swiftness and rapid

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:04.370 
even though death swiftness and rapid
fire<00:06:02.670> don't<00:06:02.850> work<00:06:03.060> together<00:06:03.450> very<00:06:03.720> well<00:06:04.080> but

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:04.380 
fire don't work together very well but

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:06.050 
fire don't work together very well but
I'll<00:06:04.560> not<00:06:04.980> talk<00:06:05.220> about<00:06:05.400> that<00:06:05.640> in<00:06:05.790> this<00:06:05.880> video

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:06.060 
I'll not talk about that in this video

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:07.730 
I'll not talk about that in this video
they're<00:06:06.450> kind<00:06:06.660> of<00:06:06.690> broken<00:06:07.110> stove<00:06:07.350> joggers

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:07.740 
they're kind of broken stove joggers

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:09.500 
they're kind of broken stove joggers
still<00:06:07.950> hasn't<00:06:08.280> fixed<00:06:08.430> those<00:06:08.760> two<00:06:09.360> abilities

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:09.510 
still hasn't fixed those two abilities

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:11.570 
still hasn't fixed those two abilities
how<00:06:09.840> they<00:06:09.960> work<00:06:10.110> and<00:06:10.200> the<00:06:10.770> range<00:06:10.980> thresholds

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:11.580 
how they work and the range thresholds

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:13.610 
how they work and the range thresholds
you<00:06:11.640> might<00:06:11.820> be<00:06:11.940> surprised<00:06:12.270> but<00:06:12.570> same<00:06:12.960> speed<00:06:13.380> as

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:13.620 
you might be surprised but same speed as

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:16.940 
you might be surprised but same speed as
Matt<00:06:14.310> melee<00:06:15.030> thresholds<00:06:15.540> so<00:06:15.690> yeah<00:06:16.290> using

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:16.950 
Matt melee thresholds so yeah using

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:20.840 
Matt melee thresholds so yeah using
rapid<00:06:17.580> fire<00:06:17.850> and<00:06:19.070> what<00:06:20.070> was<00:06:20.220> it<00:06:20.400> snapshot

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:20.850 
rapid fire and what was it snapshot

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:23.030 
rapid fire and what was it snapshot
whatever<00:06:21.510> this<00:06:21.810> shot<00:06:22.020> were<00:06:22.140> the<00:06:22.380> ability

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:23.040 
whatever this shot were the ability

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:24.350 
whatever this shot were the ability
where<00:06:23.130> you<00:06:23.220> shot<00:06:23.550> fire<00:06:23.730> two<00:06:23.880> arrows<00:06:23.910> at<00:06:24.210> once

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:24.360 
where you shot fire two arrows at once
