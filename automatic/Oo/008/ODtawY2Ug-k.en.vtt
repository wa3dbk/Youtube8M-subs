it<00:00:25.800> acted<00:00:26.340> like<00:00:26.430> it<00:00:26.580> wasn't<00:00:26.699> charging<00:00:27.150> at<00:00:27.240> all

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
it acted like it wasn't charging at all

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.529 
it acted like it wasn't charging at all
so<00:00:27.930> I<00:00:27.960> put<00:00:28.170> it<00:00:28.260> on<00:00:28.349> another<00:00:28.619> charger<00:00:29.220> and<00:00:29.550> still

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
it was on the charger just completely

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.139 
it was on the charger just completely
unresponsive<00:00:34.410> I<00:00:34.950> also<00:00:35.250> took<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:35.700> battery<00:00:36.090> out

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149

and<00:00:36.510> put<00:00:36.630> it<00:00:36.719> back<00:00:36.750> in<00:00:37.020> a<00:00:37.050> couple<00:00:37.260> times<00:00:37.620> during

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
and put it back in a couple times during

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.380 
and put it back in a couple times during
that<00:00:38.070> during<00:00:38.760> that<00:00:38.790> period<00:00:39.030> of<00:00:39.180> time<00:00:39.270> that

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
that during that period of time that

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.650 
that during that period of time that
didn't<00:00:39.870> help<00:00:41.030> so<00:00:42.030> I<00:00:42.059> started<00:00:42.360> looking<00:00:42.480> around

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
didn't help so I started looking around

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.529 
didn't help so I started looking around
about<00:00:43.200> what<00:00:43.379> to<00:00:43.500> do<00:00:43.680> I<00:00:43.739> also<00:00:44.010> I<00:00:44.370> also<00:00:44.460> tried<00:00:45.059> two

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
about what to do I also I also tried two

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.290 
about what to do I also I also tried two
different<00:00:45.570> batteries<00:00:46.350> in<00:00:46.500> it<00:00:46.620> so<00:00:47.030> it<00:00:48.030> wasn't

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
different batteries in it so it wasn't

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.330 
different batteries in it so it wasn't
that<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:49.050> battery<00:00:49.350> was<00:00:49.469> dead<00:00:49.500> either<00:00:49.890> because

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
that the battery was dead either because

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.799 
that the battery was dead either because
I<00:00:50.430> did<00:00:50.610> try<00:00:50.820> a<00:00:50.850> second<00:00:51.210> battery<00:00:51.480> in<00:00:51.600> it<00:00:51.629> and

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
I did try a second battery in it and

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.689 
I did try a second battery in it and
that<00:00:51.930> behaved<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.530> same<00:00:52.559> way<00:00:52.829> when<00:00:53.039> wouldn't

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
that behaved the same way when wouldn't

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.069 
that behaved the same way when wouldn't
take<00:00:53.789> a<00:00:53.850> charge<00:00:54.090> well<00:00:54.390> I<00:00:54.420> didn't<00:00:54.690> come<00:00:54.780> on<00:00:54.840> when

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
take a charge well I didn't come on when

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.360 
take a charge well I didn't come on when
it<00:00:55.170> was<00:00:55.260> charging<00:00:55.559> wouldn't<00:00:55.920> turn<00:00:56.070> on<00:00:56.190> while

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
it was charging wouldn't turn on while

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:57.619 
it was charging wouldn't turn on while
it<00:00:56.430> was<00:00:56.550> on<00:00:56.640> charger<00:00:57.090> it's<00:00:57.210> just<00:00:57.329> completely

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
it was on charger it's just completely

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.260 
it was on charger it's just completely

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
put the battery back in see if that

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.260 
put the battery back in see if that
works<00:01:45.420> and<00:01:45.750> if<00:01:45.869> that<00:01:46.020> doesn't<00:01:46.350> work<00:01:46.490> then<00:01:47.490> plug

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
works and if that doesn't work then plug

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.069
