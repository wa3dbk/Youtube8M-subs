there's like all these categories math
science<00:01:25.080> data<00:01:25.500> and<00:01:26.400> you<00:01:26.759> basically<00:01:26.939> pick<00:01:27.299> one

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
science data and you basically pick one

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.440 
science data and you basically pick one
say<00:01:28.350> you're<00:01:28.470> in<00:01:28.560> 5th<00:01:28.799> grade<00:01:29.070> whatever<00:01:29.450> and

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
subtracting fractions blah blah blah and

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.660 
subtracting fractions blah blah blah and
basically<00:01:38.900> we're<00:01:39.900> asked<00:01:40.079> to<00:01:40.200> add<00:01:40.380> 4/9<00:01:41.369> and

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
basically we're asked to add 4/9 and

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.569 
basically we're asked to add 4/9 and
1112<00:01:42.479> and<00:01:42.810> to<00:01:43.049> write<00:01:43.259> our<00:01:43.439> answer<00:01:43.470> it<00:01:43.950> you<00:01:44.460> can

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
1112 and to write our answer it you can

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.490 
1112 and to write our answer it you can
watch<00:01:44.700> a<00:01:44.880> cool<00:01:45.270> video<00:01:45.630> on<00:01:45.960> you<00:01:46.170> know<00:01:46.320> go
