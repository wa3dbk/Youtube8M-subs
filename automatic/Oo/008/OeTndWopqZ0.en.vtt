don't want anything to do with it you
know<00:04:05.970> I<00:04:06.150> think<00:04:06.300> they<00:04:06.600> made<00:04:06.780> that<00:04:06.930> game<00:04:07.170> just<00:04:07.470> do

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
know I think they made that game just do

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:09.740 
know I think they made that game just do
it<00:04:07.800> just<00:04:07.950> for<00:04:08.220> the<00:04:08.280> multiplayer<00:04:08.910> pretty<00:04:09.510> much

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
it just for the multiplayer pretty much

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.630 
it just for the multiplayer pretty much
like<00:04:10.560> I<00:04:10.709> don't<00:04:10.770> even<00:04:10.920> think<00:04:11.160> they<00:04:11.310> cared<00:04:11.550> about

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 
like I don't even think they cared about

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:16.610 
like I don't even think they cared about
the<00:04:11.820> story<00:04:12.060> at<00:04:12.209> all<00:04:12.300> and<00:04:14.209> halo<00:04:15.209> ODST<00:04:15.620> was

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
the story at all and halo ODST was

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.920 
the story at all and halo ODST was
pretty<00:04:16.859> good<00:04:17.070> except<00:04:17.640> the<00:04:18.209> story<00:04:18.540> and<00:04:18.750> that

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
pretty good except the story and that

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.080 
pretty good except the story and that
was<00:04:19.739> pretty<00:04:19.950> pointless

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 
was pretty pointless

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:26.810 
was pretty pointless
make<00:04:21.600> a<00:04:21.630> lot<00:04:21.870> of<00:04:21.900> sense<00:04:22.049> and<00:04:25.460> so<00:04:26.460> I'm<00:04:26.610> just

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
make a lot of sense and so I'm just

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:31.490 
make a lot of sense and so I'm just
going<00:04:27.090> over<00:04:27.330> the<00:04:27.449> games<00:04:27.780> here<00:04:29.300> anyways<00:04:30.440> if<00:04:31.440> you
