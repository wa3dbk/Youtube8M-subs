00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.779
 someone full 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:21.109

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.730
 all full or played 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:26.070
 see there are few people need to find where 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:30.330
 much to fight faster by the hour let's 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:33.600

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:36.329

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:40.829
 battlefield let's show who is online 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:43.920

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:46.320
 people run nicknames what here 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.390
 actually many ask how here 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.340
 play again I will remind everyone that it is 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.170
 only for license if you 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.480

00:00:52.170 --> 00:01:00.090
 stove-setter I will write it down later 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:03.090
 description arrange a riot raise a riot 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:06.090
 Well, it's probably all the blocks 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.880
 started attacking the ax well the plan doesn't matter 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:14.689
 shorter pound go nick 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.689
 leave in the description that's actually 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.430
 Well, there come into the arcade in Arcadia there 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.050
 haben sie mode 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.640
 and actually be able to play hide and seek in 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:24.710
 In general, I'll show you all this already. 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.770
 next video you see now 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:33.520
 think and worry 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:33.520
 in 6 place they want to make a rebellion Russian 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:37.610
 one would say hello to crumpled everything 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:40.810
 Equally hardly anyone knows so 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.810
 let's say hello 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:48.230
 hello i will be stupid now someone 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:53.290
 write most likely the battle began 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:56.060
 fine so I have a musical block yes 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:59.300
 so I remember this map honestly progruzutsya 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:01.460
 In the super progruzilos I remember this card and 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:04.940
 it is quite difficult to hide here if 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.740
 honestly you can of course again along 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:09.080
 walls run like I once ran 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.670
 remember in some series iv fell here in 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.450
 let's say a trap I'm just out of it 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.450
 could not get out 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:21.750
 a couple of seconds before the beginning of the devil began the search 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:26.280
 I want to find some here 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:28.050
 single such hole in one block yes 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.750
 or there in 2 well that is not to deep 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:33.590
 yes where could I hide and see everything 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.590
 what happens outside 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.540
 I don't see the ax 

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:44.830
 Well, it's okay to start looking there, here I am 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:49.180
 until I find a place where to hide the cheat 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:52.260
 our little gets killed enough 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.260
 byrenko killed two he 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:59.420
 block iron see jumps on top 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:01.460
 hopped up wants to climb on 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.740
 Here in this one here I in my opinion 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:07.520
 last time was a double see that is 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:10.280
 if i sit here now 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:11.660
 I would have some pots 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.340
 Of course it 's easier to see me here 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:14.690
 It was but I hope that they will pass by 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.520
 and do not notice that I'm in this 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:19.550
 well and I will clearly see 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:21.710
 how can people actually run like this 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:24.950
 actually para-pam-pam bots already and 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:30.370
 Seeker runs it's next to it 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:32.960
 op op op op op ran a sword 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.220
 I would like to win this time 

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:36.800
 win really get more 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:38.900
 tokens see blocks then jumps it 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:41.540
 I can see very well I do not know how you can 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:44.930
 was miss just okay 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:49.130
 there is a rumor you're 8 dude already looking for us 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:51.140
 16 hides but times more than us but he 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:55.880
 see our ranks when quick 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:58.160
 exhausted yes guys to our look 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:01.730
 beatings just generally find one for 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:03.650
 other scary real scary i don't want 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:06.440
 die I want to win to the end 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:09.770
 hold out cool mode but sometimes 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:12.260
 let's say so honest yes boring well 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:15.020
 that is, that's got you well, no one is looking for 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:16.670
 it's boring here but adrenaline right away 

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:18.440
 is added when real close 

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:21.190
 someone passes and especially when they 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:23.360
 seeing you is just awesome 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:25.460
 you get pleasure but when so 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.240
 here you sit and you see no one near 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:29.120
 no one at all 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:32.080
 waiting for yourself for something which is not clear but 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.080
 but you can drink tea 

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:41.020
 tasty you can of course there would be a riot 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:42.760
 arrange all the blocks up to attack the axes 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:45.820
 Cyrus and then the next ax and so 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:48.460
 dah wow you're running right to me aaa 

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:50.500
 see by ran from this cool 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:52.090
 when a month goes by 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:53.700
 it's hard enough to spot another one 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:56.170
 running 

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:58.390
 here but if someone rises right here 

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:59.830
 here it will notice me very easily 

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:01.960
 I hope they will always be there 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:05.470
 to run and actually not to notice 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:07.690
 there is such a god very strongly this 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:11.230
 worth take it look don't notice at all 

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:13.780
 Although this is an obvious one unit that's straight 

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:15.640
 I understand I do not know why they did not see him 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:17.350
 not overclocking the guys climbed to the top 

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:19.330
 there is also very often hiding that is 

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:22.090
 these are places that need to be checked in 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:24.490
 first of all do the mug yes for this 

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:28.060
 map very often here are such blocks 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:30.970
 very noticeable here and you can them as 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:32.680
 would define well and on there on top 

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:35.620
 too often hiding there too can be found 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:38.200
 here is the chip of this card until that 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:40.420
 when you hide outside and ax 

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:42.010
 inside the date everything is fine when the stacks 

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:43.720
 starts running you have to wait for this 

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:45.580
 the moment they all run out and 

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:47.560
 run inside there hide then you 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:50.410
 will not find but it is in 90 percent 

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:52.000
 cases because no one is inside 

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:55.330
 seek will not all will run 

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:58.500
 outside and try to find a nose out they 

00:05:55.330 --> 00:06:02.110
 run when it starts running up know 

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:03.820
 getting scared on mode all the same 

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:06.910
 cool I do not know 

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:09.190
 I play she seems to be bored and sometimes 

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:11.050
 when just wow he block run this 

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:13.729
 both sitting and sitting and if his not 

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:15.589
 will find and will be shocked 

00:06:13.729 --> 00:06:19.129
 that's about savages getting bored sometimes 

00:06:15.589 --> 00:06:20.839
 but mostly always just fun 

00:06:19.129 --> 00:06:24.580
 you get food look he even moves 

00:06:20.839 --> 00:06:24.580
 you don't see him 

00:06:25.059 --> 00:06:31.729
 dog he generally beats the earth well on 

00:06:27.379 --> 00:06:33.289
 oh the same tree if its not in the end 

00:06:31.729 --> 00:06:34.969
 will find i will be just in shock by the way 

00:06:33.289 --> 00:06:36.740
 I wonder how he jumped there and not 

00:06:34.969 --> 00:06:41.419
 I see there is an obvious such ban there 

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:43.969
 okay so started 5 dude hiding 

00:06:41.419 --> 00:06:47.680
 35 seconds left in principle I have for 

00:06:43.969 --> 00:06:49.759
 30 seconds can in the shelf to quite find 

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:51.620
 I would certainly not find this 

00:06:49.759 --> 00:06:52.999
 damn block jumps right and I do not know how 

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:54.889
 it can not be seen but so much 

00:06:52.999 --> 00:06:58.099
 obviously there are so many people running around him 

00:06:54.889 --> 00:07:00.589
 no one has ever noticed a kapets but 

00:06:58.099 --> 00:07:02.509
 he is near but look up as well 

00:07:00.589 --> 00:07:05.529
 one may not understand this block of housing for 

00:07:02.509 --> 00:07:05.529
 Christmas trees but 

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:11.409
 three of us left here's another one i see 

00:07:09.849 --> 00:07:16.659
 one so rudely here two 

00:07:11.409 --> 00:07:19.960
 side by side there is nothing there and we 

00:07:16.659 --> 00:07:22.270
 won over 40 still earned la la 

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:26.560
 la la la la la la la la la 

00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:29.439

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:31.569
 funny funny funny so nothing here 

00:07:29.439 --> 00:07:32.879
 added a new one with no 3000 tokin 

00:07:31.569 --> 00:07:35.710
 I am only one and a half 

00:07:32.879 --> 00:07:38.620
 here on this and all the guys I finish 

00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:39.879
 got used to shoot 1 episode 1 fight 

00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:41.259
 did you like it 

00:07:39.879 --> 00:07:43.150
 play high density all the same 

00:07:41.259 --> 00:07:45.219
 cool well sometimes of course 

00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:47.680
 it turns out and boring battles but sometimes very 

00:07:45.219 --> 00:07:49.419
 such even exciting i think you 

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:51.340

00:07:49.419 --> 00:07:53.699
