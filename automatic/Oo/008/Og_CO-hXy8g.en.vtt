 of the new channel because it 's fresh and good 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.310
 today we are going to make the trap of a 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:41.739
 subscriber who passed me the trap by 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:44.620
 twitter and to this day still not what 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:47.710
 has done nobody and I liked it a lot 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:49.809
 very much in fact it is something automatic 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.460
 that you do not have to do anything and that you're going to 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:53.230
 crush the enemy with a block 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.210
 while you're up touching the 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:58.210
 noses or udders or whatever you have 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.680

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.390
 this fast I will go to attack people 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.590
 first because I want to warm up a bit and 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:05.020
 I hope you support this trap with 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:06.550
 lots of little hands up because this is 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:09.399
 something new that you can do if 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:10.840
 you want to highlight because you can 

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:12.580
 send any photo to twitter and 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.670

 here we are going to look for everyone like 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.780
 very heavy water ok let's do here 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.360
 the trap 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.550
 It's super cool because it 's so cool 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.619

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:31.450
 in tetillas come small what what 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:34.340

 you were in tits and I blow your tits 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.659
 Everything is calm, come on so nothing 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.890
 let's start making the trap what 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:42.200
 first ok now let's do here 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.149
 really already are two traps that already 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.270
 I did but you have not done it merged is 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:49.280
 tag , and lego am Laia summer goodbye 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.929
 Come on, little one, hello to your mom 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.549
 I always say that I hope we lose 

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:54.829
 Regards, your mom, let's get two 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:56.390
 normal pistons that is what we are going to 

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:58.880
 need and we're going to do it here in 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.649
 kassel in the castle first let's go to 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.990
 make the first trap that would be that 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:05.990
 fall with this by placing a piston in 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:08.299
 a side we here the piston will 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.709
 we put a plate on top and in this way 

00:02:08.299 --> 00:02:11.840
 to the person that there is directly by 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:13.880
 here is worth this is a trap that I already made 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.620
 at the time and above I will leave the merger 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.599
 of these two traps is worth the 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.400
 merged separately that is not in 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:21.200
 together that is a the trap that is 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:24.260
 plasta and on the other hand this one here 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.569
 ok the piston would activate and fall 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:29.150
 just here still place wood 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:30.260
 to disguise although it is not necessary and 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.090
 well the person who falls will fall 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.160
 right here now what are we going to do 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:37.970
 put the automatic so that they are crushed 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:40.340
 with a droplet of remains worth we go to 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.840
 let's do the redstone with the block 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:46.430
 that we have it here we place there is a 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:49.550
 droplet as it was worth if we put here 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:51.230
 piston number two and this piston is 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:53.420
 will also activate and crush the 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.590
 person is automatically falling and 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.110
 one crushes it or that is it is 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:00.080
 amazing one kind one example is worth 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.650
 say here they would enter they will fall justly 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.660
 here 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.160
 crushed with the block this is a 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:07.070
 my trap that I did at the time 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.840
 but good ok let's take the and the 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:10.490
 piston well will stay here this the 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.340
 block as such but good I'm going to 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:15.440
 catch a little more wood that I see 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:17.480
 lacked in material minerals and in everything 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.850
 It's worth to see there are still two people or 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.590
 is that I think any impish this 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:22.820
 around here those on the second plate and now 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:25.040
 we make slabs also because you have to 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:27.230
 place them so that people do not get 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.140
 access your castle voucher we place 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:33.770
 here a plate this we cover it 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:35.209
 we put down a slab worth so that 

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:37.220
 collide with the door frame and 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:39.290
 here exactly the same so that it 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:41.930
 are crushed and can not escape 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:43.190
 nothing and we have everything ready 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.270
 very cool the trap I send you a greeting 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:45.560
 from here 

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:47.690
 have a trap that I want 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.760
 teach on twitter can you follow me and 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:52.820
 send what you want, you see that 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:54.350
 activates perfectly and below it goes to 

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:56.960
 crush the player who wants to enter 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:58.700
 Ok then, well, I'm going to take this 

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:00.710
 let's leave it ready and I think that 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:02.540
 It has been very clear to you I always try to 

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:05.060
 be as clear as possible so that 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:07.280
 you learn to make the traps but not 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:08.480
 I always get it worth then it's worth 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.670
 let's go also outside the 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:12.350
 castle and I'm going to camouflage a bit 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:16.430
 this with wood around here and things like that 

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:17.870
 so that the person has more desire to 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:19.970
 enter the trap and not smell 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:22.400
 nothing then here I put blocks 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:23.870
 of wood here the plate that we do not know 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.730
 forget because if it's not going to fall, no no 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:27.620
 no no no no no mum 

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:29.840
 a block is worth tranquility plus mine 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:31.420
 My mother, I have nothing left but me 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:34.400

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:45.440

 I would go very badly to kill him but hey 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:53.930

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:56.090

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:57.680

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:01.160

 diamond with the damn trap good 

00:05:51.009 --> 00:05:54.220
 you can see that the block crushes the 

00:05:52.599 --> 00:05:55.960
 player and it goes very well team but not like that 

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:57.400
 the crushed thing has taken away half of 

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:59.110
