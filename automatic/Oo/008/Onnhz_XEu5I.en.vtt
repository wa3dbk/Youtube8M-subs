00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.389 

okay<00:00:01.290> let's<00:00:01.530> take<00:00:01.650> a<00:00:01.710> look<00:00:01.800> at<00:00:02.070> this<00:00:02.159> there's

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:02.399 
okay let's take a look at this there's

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:05.990 
okay let's take a look at this there's
some<00:00:02.669> video<00:00:02.999> that<00:00:03.060> has<00:00:03.570> emerged<00:00:04.170> of<00:00:04.560> a<00:00:05.000> flight

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
some video that has emerged of a flight

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.930 
some video that has emerged of a flight
coming<00:00:06.360> out<00:00:06.600> of<00:00:06.810> JFK<00:00:07.590> Airport<00:00:08.460> in<00:00:08.519> New<00:00:08.670> York

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
coming out of JFK Airport in New York

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.839 
coming out of JFK Airport in New York
City<00:00:09.269> it's<00:00:09.600> a<00:00:09.809> Virgin<00:00:10.170> Atlantic<00:00:10.640> 747<00:00:11.640> flight

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
City it's a Virgin Atlantic 747 flight

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.270 
City it's a Virgin Atlantic 747 flight
taking<00:00:12.180> off<00:00:12.480> and<00:00:12.809> there<00:00:13.410> appears<00:00:13.769> to<00:00:13.830> be<00:00:13.980> in

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
taking off and there appears to be in

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.460 
taking off and there appears to be in
the<00:00:14.309> video<00:00:14.519> an<00:00:15.000> object<00:00:15.780> flying<00:00:16.080> extremely

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
the video an object flying extremely

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.000 
the video an object flying extremely
close<00:00:17.130> to<00:00:17.340> the<00:00:17.460> plane<00:00:17.699> now<00:00:17.730> there's<00:00:18.150> a<00:00:18.270> lot<00:00:18.600> of

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:19.010 
close to the plane now there's a lot of

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:21.820 
close to the plane now there's a lot of
speculation<00:00:20.010> about<00:00:20.130> what<00:00:20.490> this<00:00:20.730> object<00:00:20.970> is

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:21.830 
speculation about what this object is

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:24.230 
speculation about what this object is
but<00:00:22.830> let's<00:00:23.039> first<00:00:23.430> take<00:00:23.670> a<00:00:23.730> look<00:00:23.940> at<00:00:24.090> it

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
but let's first take a look at it

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.939 
but let's first take a look at it
Elliott<00:00:24.600> and<00:00:24.779> you<00:00:25.289> know<00:00:25.380> just<00:00:25.590> so<00:00:25.680> we<00:00:25.770> can<00:00:25.859> get

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
Elliott and you know just so we can get

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.910 
Elliott and you know just so we can get
an<00:00:26.100> idea<00:00:26.460> of<00:00:26.520> what<00:00:26.939> everybody's<00:00:27.680> referring<00:00:28.680> to

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
an idea of what everybody's referring to

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.319 
an idea of what everybody's referring to
this<00:00:29.070> is<00:00:29.160> a<00:00:29.300> 747<00:00:30.300> on<00:00:30.449> takeoff<00:00:30.960> very<00:00:31.740> large

00:00:32.319 --> 00:00:32.329 
this is a 747 on takeoff very large

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:34.460 
this is a 747 on takeoff very large
airplane<00:00:33.329> and<00:00:33.630> you<00:00:33.750> can<00:00:33.930> see<00:00:34.110> something

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:34.470 
airplane and you can see something

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.610 
airplane and you can see something
moving<00:00:34.710> past<00:00:35.040> it<00:00:36.260> overtaking<00:00:37.260> it<00:00:37.380> going

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
moving past it overtaking it going

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.799 
moving past it overtaking it going
faster<00:00:38.130> than<00:00:38.340> it<00:00:38.579> and<00:00:38.940> you<00:00:39.540> know<00:00:39.630> we'll<00:00:39.780> just

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
faster than it and you know we'll just

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.270 
faster than it and you know we'll just
take<00:00:40.050> another<00:00:40.290> look<00:00:40.590> at<00:00:40.739> it<00:00:40.860> this<00:00:40.950> is<00:00:41.100> going

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
take another look at it this is going

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.950 
take another look at it this is going
past<00:00:41.640> it<00:00:41.790> it's<00:00:41.969> going<00:00:42.210> you<00:00:42.510> can<00:00:42.660> see<00:00:42.870> it

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
past it it's going you can see it

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.760 
past it it's going you can see it
emerging<00:00:43.620> from<00:00:43.770> behind<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:44.250> wing<00:00:45.770> clearly

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
emerging from behind the wing clearly

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.139 
emerging from behind the wing clearly
it's<00:00:46.890> coming<00:00:47.129> from<00:00:47.219> behind<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.640> tail<00:00:47.850> in<00:00:48.030> the

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
it's coming from behind the tail in the

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.170 
it's coming from behind the tail in the
wing<00:00:48.360> going<00:00:48.930> faster<00:00:49.590> than<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:50.520> planes<00:00:50.879> going

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
wing going faster than the planes going

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.680 
wing going faster than the planes going
on<00:00:51.480> takeoff<00:00:51.960> it's<00:00:52.820> exactly<00:00:53.820> parallel<00:00:54.360> to<00:00:54.390> the

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
on takeoff it's exactly parallel to the

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.299 
on takeoff it's exactly parallel to the
plane<00:00:54.930> mm-hmm<00:00:55.680> closer<00:00:56.579> than<00:00:56.850> any<00:00:57.030> other

00:00:58.299 --> 00:00:58.309 
plane mm-hmm closer than any other

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:01.369 
plane mm-hmm closer than any other
authorized<00:00:59.309> flight<00:00:59.789> would<00:01:00.030> be<00:01:00.090> to<00:01:00.840> this<00:01:00.989> plane

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
authorized flight would be to this plane

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.219 
authorized flight would be to this plane
so<00:01:01.949> all<00:01:02.430> right<00:01:02.640> now<00:01:02.789> I<00:01:02.820> know<00:01:02.940> we<00:01:03.239> last<00:01:03.809> week<00:01:04.019> had

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
so all right now I know we last week had

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.919 
so all right now I know we last week had
some<00:01:04.439> footage<00:01:04.709> of<00:01:04.889> some<00:01:05.549> little<00:01:06.450> lights<00:01:06.659> in

00:01:06.919 --> 00:01:06.929 
some footage of some little lights in

00:01:06.929 --> 00:01:10.069 
some footage of some little lights in
the<00:01:07.109> sky<00:01:07.469> in<00:01:07.859> Osaka<00:01:08.700> Japan<00:01:08.850> and<00:01:09.509> you<00:01:09.630> you<00:01:09.959> were

00:01:10.069 --> 00:01:10.079 
the sky in Osaka Japan and you you were

00:01:10.079 --> 00:01:11.719 
the sky in Osaka Japan and you you were
pooh-poohing<00:01:10.619> that<00:01:10.770> okay<00:01:11.009> but<00:01:11.189> this<00:01:11.579> is

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
pooh-poohing that okay but this is

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.219 
pooh-poohing that okay but this is
something<00:01:11.969> I<00:01:12.240> mean<00:01:12.389> that<00:01:12.539> somebody<00:01:12.840> shot<00:01:13.020> this

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
something I mean that somebody shot this

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.599 
something I mean that somebody shot this
on<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.439> ground<00:01:13.649> oh<00:01:13.709> let's<00:01:13.889> say<00:01:14.009> Photoshop

00:01:14.599 --> 00:01:14.609 
on the ground oh let's say Photoshop

00:01:14.609 --> 00:01:16.550 
on the ground oh let's say Photoshop
this<00:01:14.789> here<00:01:15.029> there's<00:01:15.509> something<00:01:15.990> moving<00:01:16.139> past

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
this here there's something moving past

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.209 
this here there's something moving past
you<00:01:16.740> don't<00:01:17.039> play<00:01:17.219> now<00:01:17.819> people<00:01:18.149> have<00:01:18.240> argued

00:01:19.209 --> 00:01:19.219 
you don't play now people have argued

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:21.559 
you don't play now people have argued
maybe<00:01:20.219> it's<00:01:20.429> something<00:01:20.609> close<00:01:20.939> to<00:01:20.969> the<00:01:21.299> camera

00:01:21.559 --> 00:01:21.569 
maybe it's something close to the camera

00:01:21.569 --> 00:01:23.419 
maybe it's something close to the camera
what<00:01:22.349> do<00:01:22.439> you<00:01:22.499> think<00:01:22.649> yeah<00:01:22.859> I<00:01:22.889> was<00:01:23.249> wondering

00:01:23.419 --> 00:01:23.429 
what do you think yeah I was wondering

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:24.620 
what do you think yeah I was wondering
about<00:01:23.609> that<00:01:23.789> I<00:01:23.969> don't<00:01:24.240> know<00:01:24.299> whether<00:01:24.420> it's

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
about that I don't know whether it's

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.149 
about that I don't know whether it's
something<00:01:24.810> close<00:01:25.349> to<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:25.649> camera<00:01:25.979> something

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
something close to the camera something

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.010 
something close to the camera something
on<00:01:26.369> that<00:01:26.520> I<00:01:26.670> mean<00:01:26.819> not<00:01:27.149> on<00:01:27.359> the<00:01:27.539> lens<00:01:27.719> because

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
on that I mean not on the lens because

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.199 
on that I mean not on the lens because
you<00:01:28.109> could<00:01:28.259> be<00:01:28.349> able<00:01:28.409> to<00:01:28.499> see<00:01:28.709> that<00:01:28.889> but<00:01:29.099> I<00:01:29.340> mean

00:01:30.199 --> 00:01:30.209 
you could be able to see that but I mean

00:01:30.209 --> 00:01:32.749 
you could be able to see that but I mean
what<00:01:30.419> otherwise<00:01:31.109> I<00:01:31.289> don't<00:01:31.560> know<00:01:31.740> how<00:01:31.950> what<00:01:32.490> one

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
what otherwise I don't know how what one

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.969 
what otherwise I don't know how what one
would<00:01:33.029> explain<00:01:33.569> that<00:01:33.899> to<00:01:34.139> be<00:01:34.349> and<00:01:34.590> what<00:01:34.829> it

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
would explain that to be and what it

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.980 
would explain that to be and what it
would<00:01:35.159> doing<00:01:35.700> there<00:01:36.329> because<00:01:36.599> it's<00:01:36.749> all<00:01:36.840> well

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
would doing there because it's all well

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.599 
would doing there because it's all well
and<00:01:37.139> good<00:01:37.200> for<00:01:37.319> us<00:01:37.469> to<00:01:37.649> start<00:01:37.889> I<00:01:38.099> mean<00:01:38.219> anything

00:01:38.599 --> 00:01:38.609 
and good for us to start I mean anything

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:40.459 
and good for us to start I mean anything
we're<00:01:38.700> gonna<00:01:38.789> say<00:01:39.029> speculative<00:01:39.749> right<00:01:40.079> but

00:01:40.459 --> 00:01:40.469 
we're gonna say speculative right but

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:43.459 
we're gonna say speculative right but
what<00:01:40.889> is<00:01:41.419> the<00:01:42.419> point<00:01:42.689> of<00:01:42.869> it<00:01:43.109> is<00:01:43.289> it

00:01:43.459 --> 00:01:43.469 
what is the point of it is it

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:45.379 
what is the point of it is it
investigative<00:01:44.310> is<00:01:44.459> that<00:01:44.609> if<00:01:44.789> we<00:01:45.060> go<00:01:45.179> down

00:01:45.379 --> 00:01:45.389 
investigative is that if we go down

00:01:45.389 --> 00:01:46.609 
investigative is that if we go down
there<00:01:45.659> oh<00:01:45.749> well<00:01:45.989> it's<00:01:46.139> an<00:01:46.349> unidentified

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
there oh well it's an unidentified

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.219 
there oh well it's an unidentified
object<00:01:47.219> and<00:01:47.789> is<00:01:47.849> it<00:01:47.939> what<00:01:48.359> does<00:01:48.509> it<00:01:48.689> do<00:01:48.959> you

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
object and is it what does it do you

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.539 
object and is it what does it do you
know<00:01:49.319> what<00:01:49.529> is<00:01:49.679> it<00:01:49.829> doing<00:01:50.039> he's<00:01:50.310> trying<00:01:50.340> to

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
know what is it doing he's trying to

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.039 
know what is it doing he's trying to
communicate<00:01:50.729> with<00:01:51.090> a<00:01:51.239> plane<00:01:51.539> that's<00:01:51.749> taking

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
communicate with a plane that's taking

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.050 
communicate with a plane that's taking
off<00:01:52.200> yeah<00:01:52.469> and<00:01:52.859> initially<00:01:53.489> I<00:01:53.520> had<00:01:53.729> to<00:01:53.849> thought

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
off yeah and initially I had to thought

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.039 
off yeah and initially I had to thought
that<00:01:54.509> it<00:01:54.810> could<00:01:55.139> actually<00:01:55.380> be<00:01:55.649> some<00:01:56.099> sort<00:01:56.399> of

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:57.049 
that it could actually be some sort of

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:00.139 
that it could actually be some sort of
projectile<00:01:58.049> missile<00:01:58.559> coming<00:01:59.249> out<00:01:59.549> the<00:01:59.880> plane

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
projectile missile coming out the plane

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.479 
projectile missile coming out the plane
right<00:02:00.479> and<00:02:00.719> missing<00:02:01.289> it<00:02:01.469> but<00:02:01.829> then<00:02:02.009> it<00:02:02.249> would

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:02.489 
right and missing it but then it would

00:02:02.489 --> 00:02:04.039 
right and missing it but then it would
have<00:02:02.549> landed<00:02:02.939> somewhere<00:02:03.149> and<00:02:03.450> impacted

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
have landed somewhere and impacted

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.049 
have landed somewhere and impacted
somewhere<00:02:04.439> there<00:02:04.590> would<00:02:04.709> have<00:02:04.859> been<00:02:05.039> if<00:02:05.369> not

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:06.059 
somewhere there would have been if not

00:02:06.059 --> 00:02:08.330 
somewhere there would have been if not
an<00:02:06.299> explosion<00:02:07.200> it<00:02:07.409> would<00:02:07.679> have<00:02:07.799> landed

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
an explosion it would have landed

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.429 
an explosion it would have landed
somewhere<00:02:08.640> prior<00:02:09.030> unless<00:02:09.599> it<00:02:09.780> went<00:02:09.989> out<00:02:10.140> into

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:10.439 
somewhere prior unless it went out into

00:02:10.439 --> 00:02:13.200 
somewhere prior unless it went out into
the<00:02:10.560> water<00:02:10.860> which<00:02:11.219> JFK<00:02:11.760> is<00:02:12.030> out

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210 
the water which JFK is out

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:14.970 
the water which JFK is out
next<00:02:13.450> to<00:02:13.510> the<00:02:13.600> water<00:02:13.840> so<00:02:14.080> that's<00:02:14.260> even<00:02:14.650> pasta

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
next to the water so that's even pasta

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.130 
next to the water so that's even pasta
anybody<00:02:15.370> on<00:02:15.490> the<00:02:15.640> plane<00:02:15.910> that<00:02:16.360> as<00:02:16.570> it<00:02:16.720> had<00:02:17.020> they

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
anybody on the plane that as it had they

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:18.390 
anybody on the plane that as it had they
had<00:02:17.290> an<00:02:17.380> opportunity<00:02:17.530> to<00:02:17.830> talk<00:02:17.980> to<00:02:18.100> anybody<00:02:18.250> on

shooting airplanes taking off at JFK and

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.380 
shooting airplanes taking off at JFK and
noticed<00:02:26.230> this<00:02:26.380> in<00:02:26.680> the<00:02:26.860> video<00:02:27.300> is<00:02:28.300> that

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
noticed this in the video is that

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:29.520 
noticed this in the video is that
something<00:02:28.900> the<00:02:28.990> only<00:02:29.080> ask<00:02:29.290> you<00:02:29.380> another

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
something the only ask you another

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.070 
something the only ask you another
question<00:02:30.300> just<00:02:31.300> coming<00:02:31.570> from<00:02:31.660> a<00:02:31.810> just

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
question just coming from a just

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.420 
question just coming from a just
thoroughness<00:02:32.650> point<00:02:33.010> of<00:02:33.100> view<00:02:33.190> rather<00:02:33.310> than

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
thoroughness point of view rather than

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.190 
thoroughness point of view rather than
skeptical<00:02:33.880> is<00:02:34.420> that<00:02:34.600> something<00:02:34.930> that<00:02:34.960> people

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
skeptical is that something that people

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.230 
skeptical is that something that people
do<00:02:35.500> take<00:02:35.830> video<00:02:36.220> footage<00:02:36.610> of<00:02:36.730> planes<00:02:37.000> because

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:37.240 
do take video footage of planes because

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:38.580 
do take video footage of planes because
it<00:02:37.360> does<00:02:37.510> seem<00:02:37.690> a<00:02:37.780> little<00:02:37.810> bit<00:02:38.020> why<00:02:38.260> am<00:02:38.500> i

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
it does seem a little bit why am i

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.920 
it does seem a little bit why am i
taking<00:02:38.770> a<00:02:39.150> question<00:02:40.150> well<00:02:40.270> there's<00:02:40.540> there's<00:02:40.810> a

taking a question well there's there's a
sort<00:02:41.470> of<00:02:41.560> a<00:02:41.710> subculture<00:02:42.400> of<00:02:42.670> people<00:02:42.790> who<00:02:43.210> watch

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
sort of a subculture of people who watch

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.450 
sort of a subculture of people who watch
airplane<00:02:43.960> takeoffs<00:02:44.380> for<00:02:44.650> this<00:02:44.770> exact<00:02:45.340> thing

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:45.460 
airplane takeoffs for this exact thing

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:48.480 
airplane takeoffs for this exact thing
in<00:02:45.910> fact<00:02:46.510> look<00:02:46.900> now<00:02:47.080> TV<00:02:47.470> posted<00:02:47.980> this<00:02:48.070> because

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:48.490 
in fact look now TV posted this because

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:50.840 
in fact look now TV posted this because
they<00:02:49.450> were<00:02:49.630> saying<00:02:49.870> somebody<00:02:50.260> is

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
they were saying somebody is

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:54.750 
they were saying somebody is
specifically<00:02:52.440> shooting<00:02:53.440> planes<00:02:54.040> taking<00:02:54.490> off

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
specifically shooting planes taking off

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.460 
specifically shooting planes taking off
looking<00:02:55.390> for<00:02:55.600> this<00:02:55.750> type<00:02:55.960> of<00:02:55.990> thing<00:02:56.170> because

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
looking for this type of thing because

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.860 
looking for this type of thing because
it's<00:02:56.860> a<00:02:56.950> common<00:02:57.370> occurrence<00:02:57.670> what<00:02:58.420> they<00:02:58.540> refer

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
it's a common occurrence what they refer

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.360 
it's a common occurrence what they refer
to<00:02:58.900> is<00:02:59.190> as<00:03:00.190> you<00:03:00.400> mention<00:03:00.970> an<00:03:01.150> investigative

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
look by some sort of UFO unidentified

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.730 
look by some sort of UFO unidentified
flying<00:03:07.090> object<00:03:07.840> there<00:03:08.290> seems<00:03:08.500> to<00:03:08.560> be<00:03:08.680> a

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:08.740 
flying object there seems to be a

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:13.200 
flying object there seems to be a
pattern<00:03:09.160> of<00:03:11.070> planes<00:03:12.070> being<00:03:12.370> approached<00:03:12.940> in

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:13.210 
pattern of planes being approached in

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:16.800 
pattern of planes being approached in
this<00:03:13.360> way<00:03:13.890> and<00:03:14.890> so<00:03:15.190> yes<00:03:15.880> this<00:03:16.090> is<00:03:16.270> exactly<00:03:16.630> what

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
this way and so yes this is exactly what

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:18.390 
this way and so yes this is exactly what
they<00:03:16.900> were<00:03:16.960> looking<00:03:17.230> for<00:03:17.440> it's<00:03:17.920> moving

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
they were looking for it's moving

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.370 
they were looking for it's moving
rapidly<00:03:18.580> yes<00:03:19.240> for<00:03:19.930> sure

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:20.380 
rapidly yes for sure

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.320 
rapidly yes for sure
whatever<00:03:20.680> it<00:03:20.860> is<00:03:21.040> or<00:03:21.280> it's<00:03:21.670> a<00:03:21.820> very<00:03:22.030> clever

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:22.330 
whatever it is or it's a very clever

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:25.100 
whatever it is or it's a very clever
trick<00:03:22.720> of<00:03:22.870> the<00:03:22.960> trick<00:03:23.950> of<00:03:24.070> the<00:03:24.130> camera<00:03:24.580> right

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
trick of the trick of the camera right

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:27.960 
trick of the trick of the camera right
it<00:03:26.110> could<00:03:26.290> be<00:03:26.470> but<00:03:26.890> it<00:03:26.980> doesn't<00:03:27.310> it's<00:03:27.670> either

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
it could be but it doesn't it's either

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.350 
it could be but it doesn't it's either
photoshopped<00:03:28.930> right<00:03:29.820> because<00:03:30.820> it<00:03:30.970> does

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:31.360 
photoshopped right because it does

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.980 
photoshopped right because it does
appear<00:03:31.690> to<00:03:31.780> go<00:03:31.900> behind<00:03:32.320> the<00:03:32.530> wing<00:03:32.830> so<00:03:33.760> it's<00:03:34.390> I

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:34.990 
appear to go behind the wing so it's I

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:37.170 
appear to go behind the wing so it's I
wouldn't<00:03:35.680> say<00:03:35.890> that<00:03:35.920> it's<00:03:36.310> an<00:03:36.460> insect<00:03:36.910> flying

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
wouldn't say that it's an insect flying

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:38.820 
wouldn't say that it's an insect flying
past<00:03:37.420> the<00:03:37.540> camera<00:03:38.020> right<00:03:38.410> because<00:03:38.710> it

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:38.830 
past the camera right because it

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:40.200 
past the camera right because it
disappears<00:03:39.280> and<00:03:39.430> then<00:03:39.520> reappears<00:03:39.970> right

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:40.210 
disappears and then reappears right

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:42.360 
disappears and then reappears right
that's<00:03:40.510> so<00:03:41.290> it's<00:03:41.560> either<00:03:41.740> it's<00:03:42.040> it's

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
that's so it's either it's it's

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.730 
that's so it's either it's it's
something<00:03:42.850> behind<00:03:43.060> there<00:03:43.570> and<00:03:43.720> it's<00:03:44.530> going

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:44.740 
something behind there and it's going

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:48.030 
something behind there and it's going
faster<00:03:45.340> than<00:03:45.580> that<00:03:45.810> 747<00:03:46.810> is<00:03:46.930> on<00:03:47.170> takeoff<00:03:47.710> right

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
faster than that 747 is on takeoff right

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.270 
faster than that 747 is on takeoff right
and<00:03:48.390> if<00:03:49.390> it's<00:03:49.630> far<00:03:49.900> away<00:03:50.110> it<00:03:50.620> has<00:03:50.770> to<00:03:50.890> be<00:03:51.010> going

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
and if it's far away it has to be going

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.390 
and if it's far away it has to be going
much<00:03:51.580> faster<00:03:51.880> and<00:03:52.360> it<00:03:53.200> wouldn't<00:03:53.620> be<00:03:53.770> closer<00:03:54.070> if

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
much faster and it wouldn't be closer if

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.790 
much faster and it wouldn't be closer if
it<00:03:54.850> were<00:03:55.030> it<00:03:55.810> wouldn't<00:03:55.990> be<00:03:56.140> authorized<00:03:56.590> to<00:03:56.680> be

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:56.800 
it were it wouldn't be authorized to be

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.580 
it were it wouldn't be authorized to be
closer<00:03:57.160> it<00:03:57.910> does<00:03:58.330> appear<00:03:58.750> to<00:03:58.780> and<00:03:59.200> it<00:03:59.260> could<00:03:59.440> be

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590 
closer it does appear to and it could be

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:01.290 
closer it does appear to and it could be
an<00:03:59.740> optical<00:04:00.190> illusion<00:04:00.310> because<00:04:00.880> of<00:04:01.000> the<00:04:01.090> poor

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:01.300 
an optical illusion because of the poor

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:03.570 
an optical illusion because of the poor
quality<00:04:01.330> video<00:04:01.960> it<00:04:02.200> appears<00:04:02.680> to<00:04:02.920> change<00:04:03.340> in

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:03.580 
quality video it appears to change in

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:06.360 
quality video it appears to change in
length<00:04:03.880> as<00:04:04.210> it<00:04:04.350> goes<00:04:05.350> it<00:04:05.650> appears<00:04:05.980> to<00:04:06.130> well

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:06.370 
length as it goes it appears to well

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:08.250 
length as it goes it appears to well
let's<00:04:06.640> take<00:04:06.790> a<00:04:06.820> look<00:04:07.030> at<00:04:07.120> the<00:04:07.180> video<00:04:07.390> again<00:04:07.600> it

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:08.260 
let's take a look at the video again it

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.790 
let's take a look at the video again it
appears<00:04:08.410> as<00:04:08.860> it's<00:04:09.130> going<00:04:09.520> by<00:04:10.410> to<00:04:11.410> actually

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:11.800 
appears as it's going by to actually

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:14.280 
appears as it's going by to actually
elongate<00:04:12.520> and<00:04:12.700> shorten<00:04:13.510> elongate<00:04:14.140> and

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:14.290 
elongate and shorten elongate and

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:16.530 
elongate and shorten elongate and
shortens<00:04:14.770> thing<00:04:15.100> may<00:04:15.700> just<00:04:15.910> be<00:04:16.000> a<00:04:16.030> distortion

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:16.540 
shortens thing may just be a distortion

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:18.750 
shortens thing may just be a distortion
of<00:04:16.630> the<00:04:16.720> speed<00:04:17.020> that<00:04:17.049> it's<00:04:17.320> going<00:04:17.650> right<00:04:18.100> I<00:04:18.130> see

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:18.760 
of the speed that it's going right I see

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:20.610 
of the speed that it's going right I see
the<00:04:18.790> speed<00:04:19.359> it's<00:04:19.540> going<00:04:19.600> out<00:04:19.989> as<00:04:20.140> opposed<00:04:20.440> to

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620 
the speed it's going out as opposed to

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:21.900 
the speed it's going out as opposed to
but<00:04:20.799> you're<00:04:20.950> suggesting<00:04:21.160> maybe<00:04:21.520> that's<00:04:21.730> some

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:21.910 
but you're suggesting maybe that's some

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:23.760 
but you're suggesting maybe that's some
kind<00:04:22.120> of<00:04:22.180> propulsion<00:04:22.450> or<00:04:22.870> whatever<00:04:23.200> my<00:04:23.650> other

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:23.770 
kind of propulsion or whatever my other

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:25.590 
kind of propulsion or whatever my other
gripe<00:04:24.220> with<00:04:24.430> this<00:04:24.610> is<00:04:24.820> if<00:04:24.940> these<00:04:25.120> guys<00:04:25.360> are

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:25.600 
gripe with this is if these guys are

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:26.330 
gripe with this is if these guys are
really<00:04:25.810> looking

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
really looking

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:27.740 
really looking
this<00:04:26.490> type<00:04:26.699> of<00:04:26.850> thing<00:04:27.030> and<00:04:27.150> they<00:04:27.210> really<00:04:27.540> want

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
this type of thing and they really want

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:29.450 
this type of thing and they really want
someone<00:04:27.990> to<00:04:28.080> believe<00:04:28.350> it<00:04:28.470> get<00:04:28.800> a<00:04:28.830> better<00:04:29.040> video

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:29.460 
someone to believe it get a better video

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.400 
someone to believe it get a better video
camera<00:04:29.940> well<00:04:30.449> you<00:04:30.750> know<00:04:30.870> you're<00:04:31.080> saying<00:04:31.260> I

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:31.410 
camera well you know you're saying I

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:32.780 
camera well you know you're saying I
have<00:04:31.500> a<00:04:31.620> good<00:04:31.800> point<00:04:32.010> there<00:04:32.130> but<00:04:32.400> there<00:04:32.580> I'm

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:32.790 
have a good point there but there I'm

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:36.710 
have a good point there but there I'm
sure<00:04:33.000> very<00:04:33.110> zoomed<00:04:34.110> in<00:04:34.290> very<00:04:34.530> far<00:04:35.300> my<00:04:36.300> initial

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720 
sure very zoomed in very far my initial

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.390 
sure very zoomed in very far my initial
reaction<00:04:36.870> was<00:04:37.290> guy<00:04:37.560> that<00:04:37.770> looks<00:04:37.979> like<00:04:38.040> a

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400 
reaction was guy that looks like a

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.790 
reaction was guy that looks like a
missile<00:04:39.120> coming<00:04:39.300> out<00:04:39.600> that<00:04:39.780> plane<00:04:39.990> that<00:04:40.350> mist

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 
missile coming out that plane that mist

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.710 
missile coming out that plane that mist
and<00:04:41.070> if<00:04:41.190> that's<00:04:41.370> the<00:04:41.580> case<00:04:41.820> that's<00:04:42.060> that's

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:42.720 
and if that's the case that's that's

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.710 
and if that's the case that's that's
frightening<00:04:43.110> that's<00:04:43.919> frightening<00:04:44.250> and<00:04:45.240> and

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:45.720 
frightening that's frightening and and

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:47.510 
frightening that's frightening and and
let's<00:04:46.139> hope<00:04:46.440> that's<00:04:46.680> not<00:04:46.949> the<00:04:47.130> case<00:04:47.340> let's

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 
let's hope that's not the case let's

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.520 
let's hope that's not the case let's
hope<00:04:47.669> it's<00:04:47.940> some<00:04:48.449> sort<00:04:48.780> of<00:04:48.870> uh<00:04:49.020> you<00:04:49.500> know
