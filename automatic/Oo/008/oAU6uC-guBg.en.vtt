00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:11.500
 the ingredients to prepare the 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:13.870
 clams a la marinera are some clams 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:15.670
 in this case a local clam of the 

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:18.970
 cristina that goes by the name of 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:22.869
 Half onion lollipop chopped instead 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:26.990
 a little parsley a glass of wine 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:30.350
 white wine and a spoonful of paprika 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:32.740
 with a little oil that is in the 

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:32.740
 skillet 

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:37.690
 the onion is placed 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.410
 until it takes color 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:01:02.260
 when the onion begins to take color 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:04.839
 the spoonful of paprika is added 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:07.530
 only one round because the paprika 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:07.530
 It can burn 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:13.409
 in that case it would bitter and quickly 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:24.070
 as fire and crime 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:34.970
 this clams are very curious because 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.990
 now with the heat they lose this color 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:42.370
 dark they have and they turn color 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:45.730
 reddish as it happens to prawns 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:49.659
 prawns being kosher change color 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:51.850
 you just have to leave them 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:55.240
 that starts at the beat so that little 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:02:00.659
 little souls are opening up to 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:00.659
 help this process can be covered 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.940
 they start to open 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.940
 they move a little 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:32.840
 already put 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.840
 making the sauce like some clams 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:49.380
 and when they are open before 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:49.380
 remove them from the fire 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:53.439
 we are going to put a little 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.519
 of parsley 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.660
 it feels very good 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.790
 and it's that simple 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:19.670
 make a rich dish of clams to the 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:19.670
 marinera when they are all open 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.490
 they are removed from the fire 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:26.670
 and they are served
