 hello internet these lists a 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:08.730
 today I will teach you to 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.290

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.360
 but nevertheless delicious eggs 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.690
 scrambled to locusts no it's not a 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.219
 joke 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.599
 so to prepare the scrambled eggs 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.550
 the criteria you will need from them 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.590
 of course that of herbs 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.119
 provence of oil and of course good 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.769
 crickets well fresh out of the freezer 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.970
 these are juveniles with 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.920
 tiny wings but you can 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.660
 of course use adults with 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.550
 real ones too pay attention 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.420
 nevertheless or get your cricket 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.380
 those were lifted in a 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.880
 laboratory with food 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.559
 biological and chemical free 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.730
 concerning the pathogens of the 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.200
 that can be transmitted from the insect to 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.129
 man and anyway this even if he 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.690
 were there I think they would have 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.190
 badly after going to the fridge and 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.180
 the pan on the other hand if you are 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.250
 allergic to crustaceans 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.570
 I recommend you replace them as soon as possible 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.890
 now by tears first of all 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.969
 peel the locusts by removing the 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.649
 pasta and wings these pieces have 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.850
 no taste and are absolutely indigestible 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.110
 for the little story we found 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.280
 the chimpanzees death from occlusion 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.449
 intestinal because of the paws of 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.020
 locusts that had clung to their 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.969
 digestive tract 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.379
 they were literally farting the 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.190
 bide these little runners so yeah 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.480
 drop the paws 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.530
 if you crush the locusts while 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.000
 you peel do not worry 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.830
 it's absolutely not serious they do not 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.240
 will be no less tasty now 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.380
 fry the locusts in a frying pan 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.970
 with oil Desert is a 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.049
 ingredient that is extremely poor in 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.610
 fat so it's not worse 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.150
 to add a sufficient amount of 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.619
 fat 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.180
 return the locusts until 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.770
 they are well roasted here so 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.939
 there the insects are well finished and at 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.710
 from that moment on it's just a 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.060
 normal recipe to scramble 2nd grade 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.530
 in the pan add the herbs and the 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.920
 salt and stir well until the 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.920
 waters be cooked 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.619

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:41.649
