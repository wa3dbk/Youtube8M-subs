the never in South comic cover which
pretty<00:03:36.230> much<00:03:36.319> makes<00:03:36.620> sense<00:03:36.950> if<00:03:37.130> you<00:03:37.220> look<00:03:37.389> when

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:38.389 
pretty much makes sense if you look when

00:03:38.389 --> 00:03:40.509 
pretty much makes sense if you look when
they're<00:03:38.480> in<00:03:38.599> hardcover<00:03:39.019> they<00:03:40.010> have<00:03:40.160> to<00:03:40.310> roll

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
hits so it makes sense because if there

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.930 
hits so it makes sense because if there
were<00:03:43.849> zombies<00:03:44.290> standing<00:03:45.290> around<00:03:45.560> some<00:03:46.549> rubble

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:49.670 
it again and hopefully save more of them
that's<00:04:48.180> how<00:04:48.330> damaged<00:04:48.690> resilience<00:04:49.140> works<00:04:49.410> it

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 
that's how damaged resilience works it

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.250 
that's how damaged resilience works it
doesn't<00:04:49.860> mean<00:04:50.270> that<00:04:51.270> they're<00:04:51.600> invulnerable

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:52.260 
doesn't mean that they're invulnerable

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.790 
doesn't mean that they're invulnerable
to<00:04:52.860> gunfire<00:04:53.400> or<00:04:53.760> that<00:04:54.600> they<00:04:54.780> get<00:04:55.080> to<00:04:55.110> roll<00:04:55.470> a

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 
to gunfire or that they get to roll a

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.550 
to gunfire or that they get to roll a
softcover<00:04:56.520> a<00:04:56.910> standard<00:04:57.840> just<00:04:58.110> being<00:04:58.290> out<00:04:58.380> in

00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.560 
softcover a standard just being out in

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.890 
softcover a standard just being out in
the<00:04:58.590> open<00:04:58.770> they<00:04:59.310> never<00:04:59.580> ever<00:04:59.970> in<00:05:00.240> softcover

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:00.900 
the open they never ever in softcover

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:04.370 
the open they never ever in softcover
when<00:05:01.770> in<00:05:01.920> hardcover<00:05:02.370> they<00:05:03.180> are<00:05:03.510> really<00:05:03.840> its

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:04.380 
when in hardcover they are really its

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:07.010 
when in hardcover they are really its
class<00:05:04.620> to<00:05:04.770> soft<00:05:05.040> cover<00:05:05.250> and<00:05:06.210> they<00:05:06.390> but<00:05:06.930> the

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:07.020 
class to soft cover and they but the

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:08.780 
class to soft cover and they but the
damage<00:05:07.320> resilience<00:05:07.830> means<00:05:08.070> they<00:05:08.220> do<00:05:08.280> get<00:05:08.610> to

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:08.790 
damage resilience means they do get to

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:10.970 
damage resilience means they do get to
reroll<00:05:09.120> those<00:05:09.660> saves<00:05:10.020> again<00:05:10.410> if<00:05:10.590> they<00:05:10.740> missed

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:10.980 
reroll those saves again if they missed

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:15.440 
reroll those saves again if they missed
them<00:05:11.130> and<00:05:12.410> so<00:05:13.410> that's<00:05:13.530> it<00:05:13.740> really<00:05:13.920> and<00:05:14.450> they're

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:15.450 
them and so that's it really and they're

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:18.620 
them and so that's it really and they're
both<00:05:15.570> really<00:05:15.780> good<00:05:15.900> units<00:05:16.520> if<00:05:17.520> you<00:05:17.910> analyze

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:18.630 
both really good units if you analyze

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:21.650 
both really good units if you analyze
player<00:05:18.960> you'll<00:05:19.500> hate<00:05:19.710> them<00:05:19.970> you<00:05:20.970> have<00:05:21.270> to<00:05:21.420> deal

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:21.660 
player you'll hate them you have to deal

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:23.600 
player you'll hate them you have to deal
with<00:05:21.780> them<00:05:21.930> really<00:05:22.260> really<00:05:22.410> quickly<00:05:22.680> if<00:05:22.980> they

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:23.610 
with them really really quickly if they

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:26.480 
with them really really quickly if they
get<00:05:23.850> close<00:05:24.390> behind<00:05:25.350> enemy<00:05:25.620> lines<00:05:25.770> they<00:05:26.250> start

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:26.490
