since<00:00:33.510> it<00:00:33.690> looks<00:00:33.840> like<00:00:33.930> Bowser<00:00:34.469> loved<00:00:35.010> to

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
since it looks like Bowser loved to

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.950 
since it looks like Bowser loved to

possible since its first days behind the

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.030 
possible since its first days behind the
wheel<00:00:39.090> some<00:00:39.899> additions<00:00:40.290> to<00:00:40.379> this<00:00:40.559> track<00:00:40.860> and

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
wheel some additions to this track and

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.770 
wheel some additions to this track and
make<00:00:41.160> it<00:00:41.280> even<00:00:41.460> faster<00:00:41.760> to<00:00:42.030> go<00:00:42.329> through<00:00:42.600> which

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
make it even faster to go through which

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.380 
make it even faster to go through which
meets<00:00:43.079> even<00:00:43.440> more<00:00:43.649> action<00:00:44.070> now<00:00:44.940> we<00:00:45.000> will<00:00:45.270> be

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
meets even more action now we will be

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:46.880 
meets even more action now we will be
taking<00:00:45.660> a<00:00:45.719> look<00:00:45.840> at<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.020> fastest<00:00:46.469> base<00:00:46.620> trout

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
taking a look at the fastest base trout

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.979 
taking a look at the fastest base trout
and<00:00:47.160> a<00:00:47.250> fastest<00:00:47.700> way<00:00:47.789> to<00:00:47.820> earn<00:00:48.090> ten<00:00:48.329> coins<00:00:48.570> I

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
and a fastest way to earn ten coins I

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.869 
and a fastest way to earn ten coins I
say<00:00:49.530> base<00:00:49.770> because<00:00:50.129> we<00:00:50.250> need<00:00:50.370> to<00:00:50.460> learn<00:00:50.640> well

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
say base because we need to learn well

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.369 
say base because we need to learn well
the<00:00:50.969> fastest<00:00:51.329> way<00:00:51.480> is<00:00:51.510> to<00:00:51.809> complete<00:00:52.110> a<00:00:52.260> lap

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
the fastest way is to complete a lap

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:53.869 
the fastest way is to complete a lap
without<00:00:52.649> having<00:00:52.980> in<00:00:53.070> cards<00:00:53.399> assigned<00:00:53.670> for

way prepare for a drift to the left you

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.710 
way prepare for a drift to the left you
can<00:01:22.680> maintain<00:01:22.979> that<00:01:23.430> same<00:01:23.880> drift<00:01:24.360> while

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
can maintain that same drift while

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.450 
can maintain that same drift while
grabbing<00:01:24.960> two<00:01:25.320> coins<00:01:25.680> and<00:01:25.860> then<00:01:25.950> release<00:01:26.280> it

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
grabbing two coins and then release it

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.910 
grabbing two coins and then release it
right<00:01:26.759> after<00:01:27.060> or<00:01:27.630> you<00:01:27.689> could<00:01:28.170> split<00:01:28.380> it<00:01:28.500> in<00:01:28.740> two

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
right after or you could split it in two

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.060 
right after or you could split it in two
like<00:01:29.130> so<00:01:29.540> head<00:01:30.540> for<00:01:30.780> a<00:01:30.810> straight<00:01:31.170> area<00:01:31.650> leaning
