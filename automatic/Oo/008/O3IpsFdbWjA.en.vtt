00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:05.780
 Hi beauties. 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.469
 Today I want to show you two options. 

00:00:08.469 --> 00:00:09.309
 manicure 

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:11.519
 using water stickers. 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.719
 Nail design with sliders 

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:16.640
 looks very impressive, its easy 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.890
 perform equally beautifully on both 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:21.659
 and most importantly, it does not require 

00:00:21.659 --> 00:00:23.429
 plenty of time 

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:25.569
 and specific skills. 

00:00:25.569 --> 00:00:27.499
 The first option due to its combination 

00:00:27.499 --> 00:00:30.369
 Flowers especially relevant for summer. 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:33.250
 To create it we need: basic 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:34.390
 coating 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:36.640
 coral and yellow lacquer 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.350
 as well as two water decal stickers, 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.750
 made in red tones first put 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.470
 base coat. Then we cover the nail 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:47.770
 ring and middle finger 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:48.730
 yellow 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:51.250
 and all the rest coral shade. 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.410
 As soon as the varnish is completely dry, 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:57.440
 cut off two nail-shaped stickers 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.600
 and lower them into the water tank for ten seconds. 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.450
 Then gently transfer the tweezers 

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:07.130
 peeled off nail sticker 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:08.660
 carefully smooth 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:11.170
 and remove those who have gone beyond the nail 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:12.870
 excess plates 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:15.880
 using nail files or scissors 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.380
 At the end we fix our manicure with a transparent varnish. 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.510
 To create a second design for us 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:21.580
 will need: 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.590
 Two stickers with a pattern made in blue 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:26.180
 tones, brush, 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.590
 as well as blue and white lacquer. 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.670
 We cover with white varnish the nail of the nameless 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.600
 and middle finger 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.870
 the rest is blue. 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:38.400
 Then cut off from the stickers 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.630
 two pieces 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.980
 in the form of repeating the free edge of the nail, 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:46.250
 then put them in the water and glue on 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.050
 nails with white lacquer. 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:50.410
 On the remaining nails draw 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.990
 free edge white lacquer with 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.950
 fine brush. As soon as our design 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.650
 dry out 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:00.340
 its clear varnish. Thus, we 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.850
 we get uncomplicated and yet very 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.120
 original french manicure. 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.340
 I sincerely hope that you learned from this 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.769
 video is something new for yourself. 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:12.400
 Thank you all for watching, bye!
