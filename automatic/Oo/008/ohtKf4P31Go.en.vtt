00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:08.540 

so<00:00:05.970> I<00:00:06.000> posted<00:00:06.360> a<00:00:06.660> video<00:00:06.810> on<00:00:07.320> how<00:00:08.130> good<00:00:08.370> those

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
so I posted a video on how good those

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.310 
so I posted a video on how good those
little<00:00:08.820> space<00:00:09.059> heaters<00:00:09.420> work<00:00:09.690> and<00:00:09.990> somebody

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
little space heaters work and somebody

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.440 
little space heaters work and somebody
gave<00:00:10.650> me<00:00:10.680> a<00:00:10.830> good<00:00:11.040> idea<00:00:12.170> to<00:00:13.170> see<00:00:14.299> actually<00:00:15.299> how

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
gave me a good idea to see actually how

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.510 
gave me a good idea to see actually how
warm<00:00:15.750> they<00:00:15.959> hit<00:00:16.170> because<00:00:16.500> toasty<00:00:17.100> is<00:00:17.160> not<00:00:17.340> an

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
warm they hit because toasty is not an

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.720 
warm they hit because toasty is not an
actual<00:00:17.850> temperature<00:00:18.450> of<00:00:18.480> learning<00:00:19.130> so<00:00:20.130> I'm

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
actual temperature of learning so I'm

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.790 
actual temperature of learning so I'm
gonna<00:00:20.880> go<00:00:21.120> in<00:00:21.270> and<00:00:21.420> and<00:00:21.660> figure<00:00:22.110> that<00:00:22.260> out<00:00:22.320> it's

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
gonna go in and and figure that out it's

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.640 
gonna go in and and figure that out it's
currently<00:00:25.220> 42<00:00:26.220> degrees<00:00:26.700> outside<00:00:27.030> so<00:00:27.660> it's

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
currently 42 degrees outside so it's

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.680 
currently 42 degrees outside so it's
it's<00:00:29.100> not<00:00:29.190> great<00:00:29.550> but<00:00:29.700> it's<00:00:29.850> not<00:00:30.390> a<00:00:30.420> terrible

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:30.690 
it's not great but it's not a terrible

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:31.659 
it's not great but it's not a terrible
terrible

00:00:31.659 --> 00:00:31.669 
terrible

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:35.330 
terrible
so<00:00:32.669> I'm<00:00:32.730> inside<00:00:33.230> and<00:00:34.230> as<00:00:34.410> you<00:00:34.590> can<00:00:34.739> see<00:00:34.980> I<00:00:35.010> keep

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
so I'm inside and as you can see I keep

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.209 
so I'm inside and as you can see I keep
this<00:00:35.550> little<00:00:35.790> thermometer<00:00:36.390> here<00:00:37.050> and<00:00:37.289> it's

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
this little thermometer here and it's

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.200 
this little thermometer here and it's
saying<00:00:38.579> it's<00:00:38.999> 70<00:00:39.629> degrees<00:00:40.019> in<00:00:40.289> here<00:00:40.559> and<00:00:41.460> it's

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
saying it's 70 degrees in here and it's

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.090 
saying it's 70 degrees in here and it's
been<00:00:42.420> there's<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:43.109> there's<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:43.829> heater

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
been there's the there's the heater

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.750 
been there's the there's the heater
there<00:00:44.489> and<00:00:45.289> it's<00:00:46.289> been<00:00:46.589> sitting<00:00:47.010> hanging<00:00:47.640> in

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
there and it's been sitting hanging in

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.939 
there and it's been sitting hanging in
this<00:00:47.909> bag<00:00:48.179> so<00:00:48.510> it's<00:00:48.690> saying<00:00:48.899> it's<00:00:49.170> 70<00:00:49.620> in<00:00:49.710> here

00:00:49.939 --> 00:00:49.949 
this bag so it's saying it's 70 in here

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:53.479 
this bag so it's saying it's 70 in here
it<00:00:50.219> feels<00:00:50.249> that<00:00:50.819> warm<00:00:51.289> but<00:00:52.289> I<00:00:52.589> will<00:00:53.100> leave<00:00:53.249> that

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
it feels that warm but I will leave that

00:00:53.489 --> 00:01:02.209 
it feels that warm but I will leave that
out<00:00:56.390> I<00:00:58.219> guess<00:00:59.219> I'll<00:00:59.940> set<00:01:00.269> it<00:01:00.300> there<00:01:00.829> so<00:01:01.829> it's

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
out I guess I'll set it there so it's

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:07.130 
out I guess I'll set it there so it's
about<00:01:02.550> three<00:01:03.120> feet<00:01:05.120> as<00:01:06.120> I<00:01:06.390> said<00:01:06.659> that<00:01:06.870> says

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
about three feet as I said that says

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.830 
about three feet as I said that says
right<00:01:07.380> about<00:01:07.680> 70<00:01:08.159> degrees<00:01:08.280> and<00:01:09.119> I've<00:01:09.420> had<00:01:09.659> this

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
right about 70 degrees and I've had this

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.959 
right about 70 degrees and I've had this
running<00:01:10.259> in<00:01:10.409> here<00:01:10.829> for<00:01:11.640> about<00:01:12.350> four<00:01:13.350> hours<00:01:13.969> so

00:01:14.959 --> 00:01:14.969 
running in here for about four hours so

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:18.620 
running in here for about four hours so
it's<00:01:15.149> nice<00:01:15.390> and<00:01:15.630> comfortable<00:01:15.899> in<00:01:16.229> here

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.230 

I<00:01:18.689> will<00:01:19.439> leave<00:01:19.649> that<00:01:19.680> set<00:01:20.280> for<00:01:20.789> another<00:01:20.969> hour

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
I will leave that set for another hour

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.999 
I will leave that set for another hour
and<00:01:21.750> I'll<00:01:21.840> come<00:01:22.049> back<00:01:22.170> and<00:01:22.350> see<00:01:22.409> if<00:01:22.590> it<00:01:22.710> warms

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
and I'll come back and see if it warms

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.429 
and I'll come back and see if it warms
it<00:01:23.070> up<00:01:23.189> even<00:01:23.549> further<00:01:23.780> okay<00:01:24.780> I<00:01:24.810> told<00:01:25.170> you<00:01:25.289> it's

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
about 40 to 43 now it's raining but it's

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:33.980 
about 40 to 43 now it's raining but it's
been<00:01:32.520> about<00:01:32.729> an<00:01:32.909> hour<00:01:33.030> and<00:01:33.539> I'm<00:01:33.630> gonna<00:01:33.750> check

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
been about an hour and I'm gonna check

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.130 
been about an hour and I'm gonna check
out<00:01:34.170> how<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.560> temperature<00:01:35.070> is<00:01:35.220> going<00:01:35.399> on<00:01:35.640> this

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
out how the temperature is going on this

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.779 
out how the temperature is going on this
okay<00:01:37.140> I'm<00:01:37.320> inside<00:01:37.530> and<00:01:38.009> when<00:01:38.159> I<00:01:38.189> said<00:01:38.429> before

00:01:38.779 --> 00:01:38.789 
okay I'm inside and when I said before

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:40.249 
okay I'm inside and when I said before
if<00:01:39.000> this<00:01:39.179> has<00:01:39.360> been<00:01:39.509> running<00:01:39.840> for<00:01:40.079> hours

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
if this has been running for hours

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.679 
if this has been running for hours
probably<00:01:41.100> been<00:01:41.250> about<00:01:41.429> five<00:01:41.789> at<00:01:42.240> that<00:01:42.360> point

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
probably been about five at that point

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.529 
probably been about five at that point
so<00:01:43.530> another<00:01:44.039> hour<00:01:44.250> it's<00:01:44.520> been<00:01:44.670> about<00:01:44.909> six<00:01:45.329> and

00:01:45.529 --> 00:01:45.539 
so another hour it's been about six and

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:55.210 
so another hour it's been about six and
I<00:01:45.840> did<00:01:46.049> notice<00:01:46.289> that<00:01:47.130> I<00:01:47.189> didn't<00:01:47.549> close<00:01:47.759> my<00:01:47.819> vent

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:55.220 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.830 

so<00:01:56.220> with<00:01:56.459> the<00:01:56.610> vent<00:01:56.819> now<00:01:57.000> close<00:01:57.360> that<00:01:57.689> will

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
so with the vent now close that will

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.830 
so with the vent now close that will
help<00:01:57.990> keep<00:01:58.709> the<00:01:59.549> cool<00:01:59.849> and<00:02:00.179> you<00:02:00.390> know<00:02:00.509> the<00:02:00.689> hot

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
help keep the cool and you know the hot

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.249 
help keep the cool and you know the hot
air<00:02:01.049> from<00:02:01.200> getting<00:02:01.500> out<00:02:01.770> and<00:02:02.659> the<00:02:03.659> temperature

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
air from getting out and the temperature

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:09.249 
air from getting out and the temperature
has<00:02:05.220> stayed<00:02:06.740> probably<00:02:07.740> going<00:02:07.920> to<00:02:08.220> about

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
has stayed probably going to about

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.460 
has stayed probably going to about
that's<00:02:10.259> close<00:02:10.560> to<00:02:10.590> 80<00:02:11.510> so<00:02:12.510> it's<00:02:13.110> doing<00:02:13.440> quite

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
that's close to 80 so it's doing quite

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.250 
that's close to 80 so it's doing quite
well<00:02:13.739> and<00:02:14.250> that's<00:02:15.090> just<00:02:15.420> one<00:02:15.630> of<00:02:15.660> them<00:02:15.900> going

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
well and that's just one of them going

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.430 
well and that's just one of them going
my<00:02:16.620> bigger<00:02:16.829> one<00:02:17.099> here<00:02:17.690> still<00:02:18.690> in<00:02:18.780> the<00:02:18.840> box

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
my bigger one here still in the box

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.250 
my bigger one here still in the box
I've<00:02:19.650> used<00:02:19.860> it<00:02:20.010> before<00:02:20.810> there's<00:02:21.810> just<00:02:22.079> no<00:02:22.230> need

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
I've used it before there's just no need

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.819 
I've used it before there's just no need
for<00:02:22.470> it<00:02:23.060> so<00:02:24.060> yes<00:02:24.750> youtubers<00:02:25.319> even<00:02:25.590> when<00:02:25.709> it

for it so yes youtubers even when it

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:27.949 
for it so yes youtubers even when it
gets<00:02:25.920> extra<00:02:26.400> cold<00:02:26.609> colder<00:02:27.150> than<00:02:27.329> this<00:02:27.510> you<00:02:27.780> can

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959
