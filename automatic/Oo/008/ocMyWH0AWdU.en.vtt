00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:47.260 
prepared with the powder tool you could

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.140 
prepared with the powder tool you could
also<00:00:47.410> use<00:00:47.680> the<00:00:47.829> anti-static<00:00:48.160> pouch<00:00:48.820> and<00:00:49.060> this

also use the anti-static pouch and this

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:50.790 
also use the anti-static pouch and this
is<00:00:49.300> just<00:00:49.510> to<00:00:49.630> make<00:00:49.780> sure<00:00:49.960> that<00:00:50.230> the<00:00:50.470> embossing

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:50.800 
is just to make sure that the embossing

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.610 
is just to make sure that the embossing
powder<00:00:51.040> which<00:00:52.030> is<00:00:52.210> white<00:00:52.510> is<00:00:52.840> gonna<00:00:53.020> stick<00:00:53.380> to

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:53.620 
powder which is white is gonna stick to

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.069 
powder which is white is gonna stick to
just<00:00:54.340> the<00:00:54.489> image<00:00:54.820> that<00:00:55.060> I've<00:00:55.329> stamped<00:00:55.750> and

00:00:56.069 --> 00:00:56.079 
just the image that I've stamped and

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:57.840 
just the image that I've stamped and
it's<00:00:56.530> a<00:00:56.590> little<00:00:56.800> bit<00:00:56.950> hard<00:00:57.220> to<00:00:57.280> see<00:00:57.370> when

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:57.850 
it's a little bit hard to see when

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:58.889 
it's a little bit hard to see when
you're<00:00:57.940> doing<00:00:58.239> this<00:00:58.329> because<00:00:58.510> I<00:00:58.720> used

00:00:58.889 --> 00:00:58.899 
you're doing this because I used

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:00.479 
you're doing this because I used
Versamark<00:00:59.380> ink<00:00:59.530> and<00:00:59.649> it's<00:00:59.800> a<00:00:59.860> water<00:01:00.070> marking

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:00.489 
Versamark ink and it's a water marking

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:02.400 
Versamark ink and it's a water marking
so<00:01:00.670> it<00:01:00.730> doesn't<00:01:00.970> show<00:01:01.210> up<00:01:01.450> on<00:01:01.750> the<00:01:01.930> paper<00:01:02.110> very

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:02.410 
so it doesn't show up on the paper very

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:05.039 
so it doesn't show up on the paper very
well<00:01:02.620> but<00:01:02.920> I<00:01:03.250> just<00:01:03.670> kind<00:01:04.089> of<00:01:04.239> eyeballed<00:01:04.689> it<00:01:04.869> and

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:05.049

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:06.690 
well but I just kind of eyeballed it and
tilt<00:01:05.289> the<00:01:05.350> paper<00:01:05.679> in<00:01:05.829> the<00:01:05.920> light<00:01:06.130> until<00:01:06.429> I<00:01:06.490> was

of<00:01:42.670> smeared<00:01:43.090> it<00:01:43.179> around<00:01:43.329> played<00:01:43.599> around<00:01:43.749> with

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
of smeared it around played around with

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.749 
of smeared it around played around with
it<00:01:43.959> a<00:01:44.049> little<00:01:44.079> bit<00:01:44.469> more<00:01:44.709> and<00:01:44.950> then<00:01:45.459> I<00:01:45.490> wanted

00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:45.759 
it a little bit more and then I wanted

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:47.010 
it a little bit more and then I wanted
to<00:01:45.819> try<00:01:46.060> something<00:01:46.270> I've<00:01:46.420> never<00:01:46.689> done<00:01:46.990> before

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
to try something I've never done before

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.410 
to try something I've never done before
and<00:01:47.380> that's<00:01:47.469> just<00:01:47.709> to<00:01:47.799> take<00:01:47.979> some<00:01:48.090> salt<00:01:49.090> from

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420

and that's just to take some salt from
the<00:01:49.539> kitchen<00:01:49.959> and<00:01:50.200> I<00:01:50.259> ground<00:01:50.529> it<00:01:50.649> up<00:01:50.740> in<00:01:50.889> my

00:01:50.999 --> 00:01:51.009

salt shaker there and then sprinkled it
on<00:01:53.409> top<00:01:53.709> and<00:01:53.859> I'm<00:01:53.920> gonna<00:01:54.009> let<00:01:54.279> it<00:01:54.310> dry

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 
on top and I'm gonna let it dry

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:56.580 
on top and I'm gonna let it dry
completely<00:01:55.240> and<00:01:55.539> then<00:01:55.630> I'll<00:01:56.049> brush<00:01:56.259> it<00:01:56.319> away

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
off all the dry salt from my watercolor

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.390 
off all the dry salt from my watercolor
piece<00:02:42.660> where<00:02:42.900> I<00:02:42.960> did<00:02:43.140> my<00:02:43.170> Boca<00:02:43.680> dots<00:02:44.010> and<00:02:44.310> I

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.540 
cobalt archival ink because I wanted to
introduce<00:02:55.200> kind<00:02:55.680> of<00:02:55.740> a<00:02:55.830> darker<00:02:56.190> color<00:02:56.220> for

thick glaze of the glossy accents and I

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:19.220 
thick glaze of the glossy accents and I
did<00:04:17.130> have<00:04:17.310> a<00:04:17.340> few<00:04:17.670> tiny<00:04:18.120> air<00:04:18.299> bubbles<00:04:18.330> in<00:04:18.989> there

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:20.479 
did have a few tiny air bubbles in there
but<00:04:19.470> I<00:04:19.500> didn't<00:04:19.859> worry<00:04:19.980> about<00:04:20.040> it<00:04:20.340> too<00:04:20.460> much

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
but I didn't worry about it too much

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:23.870 
but I didn't worry about it too much
because<00:04:21.180> they<00:04:21.330> don't<00:04:21.510> show<00:04:21.750> up<00:04:22.520> too<00:04:23.520> badly<00:04:23.700> if

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 
because they don't show up too badly if

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:24.950 
because they don't show up too badly if
I'd<00:04:23.970> had<00:04:24.090> some<00:04:24.270> big<00:04:24.450> ones<00:04:24.600> that<00:04:24.780> I<00:04:24.810> probably

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
I'd had some big ones that I probably

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.090 
I'd had some big ones that I probably
would've<00:04:25.230> come<00:04:25.350> along<00:04:25.500> with<00:04:25.650> a<00:04:25.680> pin<00:04:25.919> and

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.100 
would've come along with a pin and

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:27.670 
would've come along with a pin and
pricked<00:04:26.340> those<00:04:26.550> but<00:04:26.850> I<00:04:27.030> just<00:04:27.240> thought<00:04:27.390> it

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 
pricked those but I just thought it

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.590 
pricked those but I just thought it
just<00:04:27.949> fine<00:04:28.160> so<00:04:28.340> I<00:04:28.430> left<00:04:28.759> it<00:04:28.940> and<00:04:29.120> let<00:04:29.270> it<00:04:29.300> dry

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:29.600 
just fine so I left it and let it dry

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.689 
just fine so I left it and let it dry
completely<00:04:30.199> and<00:04:30.590> then<00:04:30.800> I<00:04:30.830> added<00:04:31.039> some<00:04:31.669> of
