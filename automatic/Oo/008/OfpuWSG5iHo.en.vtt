but if it comes it comes um for you

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.030 
but if it comes it comes um for you
though<00:01:18.000> three<00:01:18.330> stoppages<00:01:18.930> and<00:01:19.140> three<00:01:19.799> six

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
though three stoppages and three six

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.679 
though three stoppages and three six
fights<00:01:20.250> so<00:01:20.490> far<00:01:20.759> do<00:01:21.299> you<00:01:21.330> think<00:01:21.390> it<00:01:21.540> would<00:01:21.659> be

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
fights so far do you think it would be

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.240 
fights so far do you think it would be
your<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.200> power<00:01:22.380> of<00:01:22.590> your<00:01:22.710> punches<00:01:23.040> that<00:01:23.159> were

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
your the power of your punches that were

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.090 
your the power of your punches that were
probably<00:01:23.490> causing<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:23.850> most<00:01:23.970> problems<00:01:24.060> well

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
probably causing the most problems well

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.380 
probably causing the most problems well
