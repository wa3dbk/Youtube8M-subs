00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:12.870 
with liquid rubber now you put a top on

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:14.810 
with liquid rubber now you put a top on
I<00:06:12.930> answer<00:06:13.320> the<00:06:13.650> top<00:06:13.920> of<00:06:14.040> the<00:06:14.100> lowell<00:06:14.250> goes<00:06:14.580> on

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:14.820 
I answer the top of the lowell goes on

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:17.000 
I answer the top of the lowell goes on
like<00:06:15.300> so<00:06:15.600> and<00:06:15.870> it's<00:06:16.110> weighted<00:06:16.530> to<00:06:16.680> create<00:06:16.980> a

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:17.010 
like so and it's weighted to create a

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:20.000 
like so and it's weighted to create a
pressure<00:06:17.340> on<00:06:17.640> it<00:06:18.080> we<00:06:19.080> have<00:06:19.200> to<00:06:19.320> move<00:06:19.470> very<00:06:19.500> fast

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:20.010 
pressure on it we have to move very fast

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:21.890 
pressure on it we have to move very fast
on<00:06:20.280> something<00:06:20.700> like<00:06:20.850> that<00:06:21.090> because<00:06:21.360> it<00:06:21.690> sets

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:21.900 
on something like that because it sets

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:29.660 
on something like that because it sets
up<00:06:22.080> very<00:06:22.320> rapidly<00:06:27.890> we<00:06:28.890> have<00:06:28.980> now<00:06:29.130> filled<00:06:29.490> the

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:29.670 
up very rapidly we have now filled the

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:31.430 
up very rapidly we have now filled the
molds<00:06:30.150> with<00:06:30.330> the<00:06:30.420> latex<00:06:30.810> they've<00:06:31.080> gone<00:06:31.230> into
