00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.450 
that that was my criteria

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:36.529 
that that was my criteria

so<00:01:37.539> there<00:01:37.689> is<00:01:37.780> no<00:01:38.280> conventional<00:01:39.280> way<00:01:39.429> of

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:39.610 
so there is no conventional way of

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:41.130 
so there is no conventional way of
looking<00:01:40.149> anything<00:01:40.450> other<00:01:40.659> than<00:01:40.810> if<00:01:40.959> it's

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:41.140 
looking anything other than if it's

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.859 
looking anything other than if it's
right<00:01:41.350> or<00:01:41.380> wrong<00:01:41.770> or<00:01:42.039> boring<00:01:43.000> or<00:01:43.119> not<00:01:43.179> or<00:01:43.689> does

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:43.869 
right or wrong or boring or not or does

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:46.559 
right or wrong or boring or not or does
it<00:01:43.990> make<00:01:44.140> sense<00:01:44.319> or<00:01:44.679> does<00:01:45.069> so<00:01:45.850> for<00:01:46.060> me<00:01:46.240> the

00:01:46.559 --> 00:01:46.569 
it make sense or does so for me the

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:48.959 
it make sense or does so for me the
whole<00:01:46.719> idea<00:01:46.959> of<00:01:47.039> holding<00:01:48.039> shots<00:01:48.459> for<00:01:48.609> example

00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:48.969 
whole idea of holding shots for example

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:50.609 
whole idea of holding shots for example
and<00:01:49.209> it's<00:01:49.390> about<00:01:49.630> will<00:01:49.929> it's<00:01:50.170> noble<00:01:50.439> it's

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:50.619 
and it's about will it's noble it's

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:52.859 
and it's about will it's noble it's
about<00:01:50.799> real<00:01:51.009> time<00:01:51.280> in<00:01:51.610> in<00:01:52.270> the<00:01:52.360> movie<00:01:52.689> where
