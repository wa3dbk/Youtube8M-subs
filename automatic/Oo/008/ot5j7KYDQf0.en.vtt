yeah I haven't decided um this is the

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.840 
yeah I haven't decided um this is the
actually<00:02:10.050> I<00:02:10.110> map<00:02:10.500> to<00:02:10.679> the<00:02:10.800> spacebar<00:02:11.460> so<00:02:11.670> it's

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
actually I map to the spacebar so it's

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.510 
actually I map to the spacebar so it's
going<00:02:12.030> to<00:02:12.380> going<00:02:13.380> to<00:02:13.470> pretty<00:02:13.740> much<00:02:13.890> toggle<00:02:14.400> the

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
going to going to pretty much toggle the

going to going to pretty much toggle the
play<00:02:14.760> and<00:02:14.970> pause<00:02:16.580> it<00:02:17.580> actually<00:02:17.850> works<00:02:18.030> really

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
play and pause it actually works really

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.210 
play and pause it actually works really
well<00:02:18.390> because<00:02:18.600> i<00:02:18.720> use<00:02:18.840> it<00:02:18.990> for<00:02:19.020> boxee<00:02:19.560> too<00:02:19.860> and

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
well because i use it for boxee too and

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.470 
well because i use it for boxee too and
it<00:02:21.090> pretty<00:02:21.360> much<00:02:21.450> does<00:02:21.750> the<00:02:21.930> same<00:02:22.170> thing<00:02:23.480> with

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110 
script still runs which is kind of an

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:30.229 
script still runs which is kind of an
issue<00:03:28.380> I<00:03:28.860> don't<00:03:29.670> know<00:03:29.760> if<00:03:29.850> there's<00:03:30.000> a<00:03:30.060> way<00:03:30.209> I

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
issue I don't know if there's a way I

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:33.820 
issue I don't know if there's a way I
can<00:03:30.360> automatically<00:03:31.080> stop<00:03:31.620> that<00:03:31.950> or<00:03:32.190> not

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:33.830 
can automatically stop that or not

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:36.140 
can automatically stop that or not
automatically<00:03:34.830> stopping<00:03:35.400> and<00:03:35.580> closing<00:03:36.060> it

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
automatically stopping and closing it

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.259 
automatically stopping and closing it
would<00:03:36.269> be<00:03:36.390> great<00:03:36.720> um<00:03:36.959> I<00:03:37.910> suppose<00:03:38.910> if<00:03:39.030> I<00:03:39.120> had<00:03:39.239> a

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:39.269 
would be great um I suppose if I had a

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:41.900 
would be great um I suppose if I had a
batch<00:03:39.510> script<00:03:39.900> running<00:03:40.709> instead<00:03:41.310> of<00:03:41.459> just<00:03:41.730> a

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
batch script running instead of just a

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:43.970 
batch script running instead of just a
regular<00:03:42.120> windows<00:03:42.840> shortcut<00:03:43.530> it<00:03:43.650> might<00:03:43.830> work

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
regular windows shortcut it might work

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.430 
regular windows shortcut it might work
better<00:03:44.280> but

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.589 

yeah<00:03:48.440> there's<00:03:48.709> that<00:03:48.849> also<00:03:49.849> like<00:03:50.269> i<00:03:50.360> said<00:03:50.569> i

00:03:50.589 --> 00:03:50.599 
yeah there's that also like i said i

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:52.420 
yeah there's that also like i said i
have<00:03:50.780> it<00:03:50.900> working<00:03:51.049> with<00:03:51.260> boxxy<00:03:51.799> too<00:03:52.010> so<00:03:52.190> i<00:03:52.220> can

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 
have it working with boxxy too so i can

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:55.030 
have it working with boxxy too so i can
just<00:03:52.519> open<00:03:52.819> that<00:03:52.879> up<00:03:53.180> and<00:03:53.209> it<00:03:53.989> basically<00:03:54.500> loads

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
just open that up and it basically loads

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:00.009 
just open that up and it basically loads
the<00:03:55.250> same<00:03:55.459> thing<00:03:58.360> but<00:03:59.360> it<00:03:59.480> works<00:03:59.629> really<00:03:59.870> well

00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:00.019 
the same thing but it works really well

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:03.640 
the same thing but it works really well
and<00:04:00.519> I'm<00:04:01.519> actually<00:04:01.760> really<00:04:02.360> glad<00:04:03.019> that<00:04:03.140> I<00:04:03.470> got

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:03.650 
and I'm actually really glad that I got

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:06.190 
and I'm actually really glad that I got
I<00:04:04.040> decided<00:04:04.489> to<00:04:04.670> use<00:04:04.760> this<00:04:05.060> instead<00:04:05.989> of<00:04:06.110> a

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:06.200 
I decided to use this instead of a

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.640 
I decided to use this instead of a
regular<00:04:06.860> remote<00:04:07.519> it<00:04:08.030> works<00:04:08.360> much<00:04:08.540> better<00:04:08.780> the

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:09.650 
regular remote it works much better the

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:12.509 
regular remote it works much better the
only<00:04:09.829> thing<00:04:10.010> I<00:04:10.129> don't<00:04:10.400> have<00:04:10.610> on<00:04:10.790> this<00:04:10.970> as<00:04:11.239> a
