00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 with the chaux here we are in a game 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.640
 to death something that they suggested to me 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.109
 many and I do not know why the game is 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.910
 How at night I suppose there will be 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.500
 last but good let's give it to you 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.330
 play it in first person mode and as 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.730
 they see it is the massacre in the mansion 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.990
 playboy so let's give him the mask 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.369
 as I feel that bothers me 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.199
 little bit but it does not matter we're going to give it 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.090
 even if it looks a little bit, it does not matter 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.800
 and let me get it right 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.390
 that the game has no weapons 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.150
 unlocked good enough comes 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.680
 good for some little things and we're going to 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.210
 reload us here let's see if we are 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.430
 comes people there comes one we kill it 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.870
 ready and they the first death ok 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.780
 let's kill this we throw ourselves for 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.239
 back and they killed us good I put the 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.190
 game if I'm not wrong it 's 20 or 30 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.379
 deaths and it's by teams so that the 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.149
 thing go a little there more 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.739
 so let's give it up let's try to 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.809
 win the game now we have 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.129
 dead once and ok these are my 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.530
 allies yes yes yes I will go with my 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.120
 allies because if not then it goes wrong and 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.920
 ok this guy I do not even know where he has 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.510
 killed has killed me detections I do not know 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.859
 how it has climbed to the roof we are going to 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.750
 try to win the game so 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.609
 I see there they insurge something that comes to us 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.589
 pretty good and let's go for this 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.070
 part of the map to see if we find a 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.510
 someone else 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.910
 ok i see that here 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.370
 let's see I put myself in third person 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:14.220
 because that way I can go better ok ya 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:15.780
 we kill another let's go around here 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.610
 forget a little run in this way 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.410
 of the third person I do not know I'm not very 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.150
 used to this run with ar as 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:23.220
 that I'm used to something today ok 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.230
 this guy has put the jet I do not know no 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.700
 I think there's a way to kill him and 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:28.140
 we go for this man who is here 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.060
 In fact, I think that's good 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.160
 with the jet I do not know I do not know I do not know 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.870
 Well, it's already killed if I'm not mistaken 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.640
 this man was killed and let's go 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:37.770
 for this young man who is just 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.200
 here we are going to go up to this part and he 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.390
 I do not expect it and I'm not huy 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.770
 go but like fuck they killed them 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.260
 we will see how they were killed and I 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.090
 I explain it but because now we are going to 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:50.550
 give it no matter what I'm going to grab 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.140
 quickly this shirt and with this already 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:53.640
 I'm going to see you quickly 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.510
 he lowered the volume here of this that is 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:59.640
 bothering and let's see 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:01.740
 6-4 things that comes pretty well because 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.630
 we are gaining things keep us like this 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.460
 until the end of the game and that no 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.950
 make us a comeback I want to grab 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.840
 a bazooka to knock down this one that 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.910
 is bothering you so quickly by 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.110
 the bazooka itself does not want to climb 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.850
 here we go 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.040
 the bazooka I know that it is right by 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.770
 here and with the bazooka I'm going to knock down the 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.930
 jet I already have the bazooka let's get 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:24.180
 the bazooka and with the bazooka ok I think 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.740
 this guy called the jet's current I'm not 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.150
 very safe but I think he has already killed the 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:29.040
 jet let's take a little more 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.410
 ammunition and I see that my team's already 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.210
 grabbed something to see what I'm dying 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.770
 I'm dying, I'm dying to see this guy 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:36.840
 it's stopped so let's kill it ok 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:39.090
 he kicked it out of my computer yes i'm sure 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.620
 well let's give it I think a guy 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.630
 is in the helicopter but I do not know how 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.270
 is that it is in the helicopter if it is 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.870
 the helicopter can not shoot 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:47.580
 automatically unless others 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.160
 Subo companions but my partner 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.989
 it's right next to me we're going to go 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.640
 deny us little bit here I see still not 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:55.320
 let's kill him or god have my 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.600
 none do not know how I killed him if that 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:59.489
 the guy had none come on quickly 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.290
 over here because I do not want to be killed and 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:02.520
 I see that nothing else killed me good not me 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.989
 they killed because he had the vest 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.850
 bulletproof we will continue to give you to see 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:07.260
 here is a quick thing that comes to me 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:09.150
 pretty good to recharge me and the 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.590
 doll does not recharge but why because 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.750
 they do not recharge the traps but we are going to 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.520
 give it ok we kill it we recharge 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.900
 quickly and we go with our way 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.670
 in fact I want to put the first mode 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.080
 person since it makes me more comfortable and 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:21.060
 there I see that there is one 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:23.100
 1 but it's quite far and I'm not going to 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.050
 reach I see that an enemy goes in 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:27.090
 helicopter thing we can miss 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:28.920
 quite simply we are going to recharge 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.840
 here we see a man approaching us 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.430
 just here the meaning is the one we 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.080
 to wait for it, I know that this is 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.490
 a bit rural but if I do not do this what 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:38.610
 what happens is that they kill me and they are going to 

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:40.110
 kill no no no but as if we outline 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:42.420
 there's also this guy already killed me three 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:43.920
 several times in a row and I already got the streak 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.990
 see or see you around here I see that there is a 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.970
 insurgents and I take the insurgent me 

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:49.860
 it comes pretty well since my friend 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:51.120
 you can climb the torrentero but not 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.830
 I think my friend wants to put the 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.570
 carter and here I see that there is one what 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:57.120
 we kill, we kill, we kill, we kill 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:58.980
 we go there to see a man approaching by 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:02.459
 that area I will escape because I already have 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:05.010
 as 50 or 30 percent of life and 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:06.600
 man even bring a poop gun me 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:08.910
 I was going to kill let's go here I'm going 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:11.550
 take a little more ammo and go 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:13.890
 to recharge our pistolita ok ready the 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:16.200
 thing is going well let's say 'well come on 13 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:18.359
 8 things that we can still take 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:20.280
 and we're going to take this little person and go 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:22.170
 to take a little more life because if 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.790
 not the men if they are going to kill me now 

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:25.680
 yes I'm ready I saw that my friend 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:28.020
 uploaded to the link emerge 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.789
 so with this I can get on with 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.289
 him and make it a tower but not 

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:32.970
 I want them to blow it up because if they 

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:36.630
 they burst it and they ruined my 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:38.419
 strategy ready ok they did not ruin the 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:40.410
 strategy but I see that here they are all 

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:42.150
 stored to watch I will not run for 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:44.070
 Do not kill me, let's kill this 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.750
 we kill, we kill, we kill, we go 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:48.000
 there to see we are going to recharge quickly 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:50.220
 and now what I want is to kill this 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.080
 I'm going to turn it around so I did not sign up 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:54.180
 I turned him again and he killed me good 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:56.220
 the guy has good aim and see that 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:58.110
 I kill myself four bases and I do not 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:59.669
 I could kill to see 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:01.380
 we appeared in the restaurant behind 

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:03.630
 which is quite good for me 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:05.250
 that here are some pizzerias and things 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:07.740
 that I can grab so they do not break me 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:09.539
 the good mother ok we won I do not know how 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:11.669
 we won I killed a few will know 

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:13.710
 how long are we at the end and spv you 

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:15.509
 killed one thing I wanted to say to 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:17.160

00:05:15.509 --> 00:05:18.570
