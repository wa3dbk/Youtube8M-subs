 every last digital gp proves and this is the 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.170
 smartphone more advanced than lg sells 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.940
 that LG has in the market here in Brazil and 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.340

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:24.090
 5.5-inch wide screen with 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:26.760
 full hd is a quad core one point the 7 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.820
 gigaset without 16 gb of internal memory and 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.710
 nevis and wifi warms me to mirror 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.780
 but he has a little something that all 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.280
 others but were forgotten and lg included 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.620
 product that is a transmitter 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.120
 infrared that transistors the 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.370
 first lets us use a 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.320
 remote control application to 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.969
 control our entire testing room and is 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.280
 This is what I'm going to show you. 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.649
 first I will define here that this 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.680
 room is a special room so I go there 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.329
 and test room personalists will you 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.460
 see that it's super simple 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.890
 I wish I could put another image 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.590
 but I'm going to leave this one right here and there 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.010
 people start to include the equipment only 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:04.350
 TV 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.260
 in the case of our TV reference to a 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:10.049
 then select models from the 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.090
 Panasonic and then we do a test for 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:15.990
 see if this software can command 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:18.000
 tv then press here call and there tv is there 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.290
 blinking you will see that it has already appeared 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.320
 It will already appear 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:27.060
 the tv image of working called 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:29.130
 image we came back here it worked yes there 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.840
 Let 's test the volume of the 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.390
 world command there in the corner there 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.820
 below we also saw that it appeared and 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.380
 Let's go next and there are the entrances and there 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.939
 It will also work already what we already 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.420
 that you are responding to all the 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:44.009
 commands done this, the tv can already be 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.710
 controlled by the appliance 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:49.320
 then it has already been found concluded in here 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.930
 People have the main keyboard but I 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.159
 I want to also put in a tv decoder 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.409
 cable for example 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.780
 so we have a complete list of 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:00.299
 manufacturers here is a tip I give 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.430
 if you are a net subscriber and you 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.680
 do not have here the list goes by manufacturer 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.850
 of the leather that thomson you can see 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.890
 nothing to look for 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.020
 in the specific case of this product has the 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.670
 net also but as we like to 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.230
 challenges 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.330
 when it is even more difficult 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.190
 alvinegro to the current course of running 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:19.069
 very old that we still have here 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:21.680
 So I'll click on a new boat and I'll point 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:25.459
 here below we go here with me you go 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:27.770
 has already switched on the decoder 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:29.720
 already lit and probably the image will 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:33.530
 appear on our tv soon 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:35.840
 Already the tv, let's see cool, then we 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:39.380
 makes the same settings here then boat 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:42.200
 show the new engine button worked yes 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:43.790
 the iacc channel of a command looks on the tv already 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.660
 It's changing, keeping in command here. 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.420
 O 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:50.600
 then the button also worked and the 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:55.489
 good numerical one there happens 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:58.340
 changed so perfect fit I can already 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:03:00.590
 operate such equipment only as 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:03.140
 smartphone of course I could put 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:05.090
 the reef watch dvd and blu ray player 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:08.000
 Projector is an air conditioning finally 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:09.769
 very good list and it's very cool and there 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.510
 it's all simpler 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:13.670
 so here we can change the 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:16.070
 Channel I 'm changing here and I'm going to ask 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:19.820

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:22.400
 change the normal channel and operate and then you 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:23.959

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.609

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:42.320
 This is where you can turn on the 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.970
 to turn the TV on or off everything 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:46.459
 that the person will click here to 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:49.579

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:51.410
 Turn off there ready, you've already hung up. 

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:53.930
