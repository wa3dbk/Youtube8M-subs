00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
I'm gonna go ahead and marinate my

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.089 
I'm gonna go ahead and marinate my
chicken<00:02:32.000> now<00:02:32.780> what<00:02:33.110> I<00:02:33.140> should<00:02:33.470> have<00:02:33.590> done<00:02:33.739> here

00:02:34.089 --> 00:02:34.099 
chicken now what I should have done here

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:36.550 
chicken now what I should have done here
before<00:02:34.549> I<00:02:34.580> added<00:02:35.090> the<00:02:35.209> chicken<00:02:35.629> was<00:02:36.049> added

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
before I added the chicken was added

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.850 
before I added the chicken was added
another<00:02:36.920> teaspoon<00:02:37.370> of<00:02:37.879> ground<00:02:38.120> black<00:02:38.239> pepper

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860

another teaspoon of ground black pepper
the<00:02:39.860> heat<00:02:40.159> in<00:02:40.370> this<00:02:40.549> recipe<00:02:41.090> was<00:02:41.360> absolutely

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
the heat in this recipe was absolutely

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.610 
the heat in this recipe was absolutely
perfect<00:02:42.860> I<00:02:43.040> really<00:02:43.790> enjoyed<00:02:44.180> it<00:02:44.209> but<00:02:45.080> this<00:02:45.319> was

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
perfect I really enjoyed it but this was

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.280 
perfect I really enjoyed it but this was
the<00:02:45.799> only<00:02:46.069> drawback<00:02:46.580> the<00:02:47.209> potatoes<00:02:47.840> ended<00:02:48.170> up

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
the only drawback the potatoes ended up

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.800 
the only drawback the potatoes ended up
with<00:02:48.500> most<00:02:48.769> of<00:02:48.920> the<00:02:49.040> heat<00:02:49.280> and<00:02:49.489> the<00:02:50.420> chicken

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
with most of the heat and the chicken

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.050 
with most of the heat and the chicken
was<00:02:50.860> okay<00:02:51.860> but<00:02:52.220> it<00:02:52.310> could<00:02:52.340> have<00:02:52.580> been<00:02:52.700> a<00:02:52.760> little

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
was okay but it could have been a little

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.990 
was okay but it could have been a little
hotter<00:02:53.299> so<00:02:53.959> I<00:02:54.290> would<00:02:55.129> recommend<00:02:55.310> you<00:02:55.730> add<00:02:55.970> a

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
hotter so I would recommend you add a

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.149 
hotter so I would recommend you add a
little<00:02:56.269> more<00:02:56.390> pepper<00:02:56.870> before<00:02:57.379> you<00:02:57.769> add<00:02:57.950> the

00:02:58.149 --> 00:02:58.159 
little more pepper before you add the

00:02:58.159 --> 00:03:00.369 
little more pepper before you add the
chicken<00:02:58.430> and<00:02:58.760> I'm<00:02:59.750> just<00:02:59.959> gonna<00:03:00.140> let<00:03:00.349> that

00:03:00.369 --> 00:03:00.379 
chicken and I'm just gonna let that

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:02.470 
chicken and I'm just gonna let that
marinate<00:03:01.010> the<00:03:01.250> whole<00:03:01.430> time<00:03:01.700> my<00:03:01.910> potatoes<00:03:02.360> are

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
marinate the whole time my potatoes are

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.869 
marinate the whole time my potatoes are
in<00:03:02.540> the<00:03:02.629> oven<00:03:02.750> now<00:03:03.340> I'll<00:03:04.340> back<00:03:04.549> to<00:03:04.760> the

00:03:04.869 --> 00:03:04.879 
in the oven now I'll back to the

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 
here and then they're ready for the next

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.550 
here and then they're ready for the next
step<00:03:30.579> now<00:03:31.579> I'll<00:03:31.849> just<00:03:31.880> lay<00:03:32.269> my<00:03:32.299> chicken<00:03:32.989> in<00:03:33.169> a

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
step now I'll just lay my chicken in a

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.890 
step now I'll just lay my chicken in a
single<00:03:33.919> layer<00:03:34.099> on<00:03:34.130> top<00:03:34.579> of<00:03:34.639> the<00:03:34.849> potatoes<00:03:35.389> and

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
single layer on top of the potatoes and

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:37.449 
single layer on top of the potatoes and
by<00:03:36.500> the<00:03:36.560> way<00:03:36.799> you<00:03:36.859> could<00:03:37.190> have<00:03:37.280> cut<00:03:37.430> the

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:37.459 
by the way you could have cut the

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:39.190 
by the way you could have cut the
chicken<00:03:37.819> into<00:03:38.120> three-quarter<00:03:38.720> inch<00:03:38.870> pieces

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 
chicken into three-quarter inch pieces

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.920 
chicken into three-quarter inch pieces
that<00:03:39.739> would<00:03:39.919> have<00:03:40.040> worked<00:03:40.190> just<00:03:40.519> as<00:03:40.730> well<00:03:40.930> but

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 
that would have worked just as well but

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:43.680 
that would have worked just as well but
the<00:03:42.079> fingers<00:03:42.440> worked<00:03:42.739> falling<00:03:43.130> from<00:03:43.310> me

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:43.690 
the fingers worked falling from me

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:47.319 
the fingers worked falling from me
fingers<00:03:44.690> or<00:03:44.930> tenders<00:03:45.500> then<00:03:46.489> I'll<00:03:46.639> sprinkle<00:03:46.910> in

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:47.329 
fingers or tenders then I'll sprinkle in

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:50.500 
fingers or tenders then I'll sprinkle in
about<00:03:47.599> 2<00:03:47.840> cups<00:03:48.079> of<00:03:48.349> Fiesta<00:03:48.889> blend<00:03:49.160> cheese<00:03:49.510> then

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:50.510 
about 2 cups of Fiesta blend cheese then

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:53.199 
about 2 cups of Fiesta blend cheese then
I'll<00:03:50.660> top<00:03:50.930> that<00:03:51.200> with<00:03:51.410> the<00:03:51.560> bacon<00:03:51.950> and<00:03:52.340> that

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:53.209 
I'll top that with the bacon and that

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:55.210 
I'll top that with the bacon and that
will<00:03:53.359> go<00:03:53.510> back<00:03:53.660> into<00:03:54.019> the<00:03:54.169> oven<00:03:54.349> at<00:03:54.709> 400

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
will go back into the oven at 400

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:58.680 
will go back into the oven at 400
degrees<00:03:55.609> this<00:03:56.269> time<00:03:56.470> for<00:03:57.470> about<00:03:57.709> 15<00:03:58.220> minutes

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:58.690 
degrees this time for about 15 minutes

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:02.140 
degrees this time for about 15 minutes
and<00:03:59.690> about<00:04:00.019> 15<00:04:00.560> minutes<00:04:00.919> later<00:04:01.190> it's<00:04:01.639> all<00:04:01.880> done

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.150 
and about 15 minutes later it's all done

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:04.629 
and about 15 minutes later it's all done
now<00:04:02.810> I'll<00:04:03.049> just<00:04:03.349> let<00:04:03.500> that<00:04:03.560> rest<00:04:04.040> for<00:04:04.190> about

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:04.639 
now I'll just let that rest for about

00:04:04.639 --> 00:04:08.199 
now I'll just let that rest for about
five<00:04:04.940> minutes<00:04:05.419> and<00:04:06.260> there<00:04:06.980> you<00:04:07.130> go<00:04:07.340> your<00:04:07.849> hot
