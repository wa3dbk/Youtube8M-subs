mean before it had an H which stood for

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.880 
mean before it had an H which stood for
HSPA+<00:02:27.360> which<00:02:27.690> is<00:02:27.840> a<00:02:27.870> slower<00:02:28.140> data<00:02:28.379> speed<00:02:28.680> now

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
HSPA+ which is a slower data speed now

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.309 
HSPA+ which is a slower data speed now
I've<00:02:29.129> got<00:02:29.280> the<00:02:29.400> 4G<00:02:29.760> data<00:02:29.970> so<00:02:30.660> I<00:02:30.690> actually<00:02:31.019> using

I've got the 4G data so I actually using

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:33.410 
I've got the 4G data so I actually using
faster<00:02:32.010> data<00:02:32.190> speeds<00:02:32.459> which<00:02:32.700> is<00:02:32.849> amazing<00:02:33.299> on

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
faster data speeds which is amazing on

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.780 
faster data speeds which is amazing on
