did but this release valve you know we
have<00:01:46.889> pressure<00:01:47.609> if<00:01:47.849> we<00:01:47.939> can<00:01:48.090> just<00:01:48.119> convert<00:01:48.599> it

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:48.719 
have pressure if we can just convert it

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:50.330 
have pressure if we can just convert it
in<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:48.959> point<00:01:49.229> so<00:01:49.469> how<00:01:49.590> we<00:01:49.649> turn<00:01:49.950> out<00:01:50.159> with<00:01:50.279> a

just this release valve that we have of
our<00:02:06.329> pressure<00:02:06.659> and<00:02:07.670> fit<00:02:08.670> by<00:02:08.880> them<00:02:09.380> the<00:02:10.380> fact<00:02:10.709> is

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
our pressure and fit by them the fact is

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.400 
our pressure and fit by them the fact is
to<00:02:11.880> get<00:02:12.090> that<00:02:12.420> you've<00:02:12.720> got<00:02:12.900> to<00:02:12.989> acknowledge
