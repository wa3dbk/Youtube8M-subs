VR<00:00:15.719> folks<00:00:15.990> I<00:00:16.289> know<00:00:16.920> that<00:00:17.369> for<00:00:17.760> me<00:00:17.880> at<00:00:18.000> very

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
VR folks I know that for me at very

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.580 
VR folks I know that for me at very
least<00:00:18.330> when<00:00:18.570> I<00:00:18.660> put<00:00:18.810> on<00:00:18.840> a<00:00:18.930> virtual<00:00:19.350> reality

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
least when I put on a virtual reality

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.109 
least when I put on a virtual reality
headset<00:00:19.859> the<00:00:20.279> first<00:00:20.460> thing<00:00:20.580> I<00:00:20.640> want<00:00:20.789> to<00:00:20.850> do<00:00:20.970> is

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
headset the first thing I want to do is

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:22.970 
headset the first thing I want to do is
grab<00:00:21.420> stuff<00:00:21.720> because<00:00:22.410> you<00:00:22.500> feel<00:00:22.680> like<00:00:22.830> you're

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
grab stuff because you feel like you're

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.109 
grab stuff because you feel like you're
there<00:00:23.220> right<00:00:23.640> like<00:00:23.850> that's<00:00:23.939> the<00:00:24.090> whole

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
there right like that's the whole

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.359 
there right like that's the whole
purpose<00:00:24.539> of<00:00:24.779> virtual<00:00:25.080> reality<00:00:25.500> and<00:00:26.130> the

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
purpose of virtual reality and the

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:27.950 
purpose of virtual reality and the
concept<00:00:26.880> here<00:00:26.970> with<00:00:27.090> nimble<00:00:27.330> sense<00:00:27.510> is<00:00:27.660> trying

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
concept here with nimble sense is trying

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.200 
concept here with nimble sense is trying
to<00:00:28.050> solve<00:00:28.260> that<00:00:28.380> so<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:29.310> camera<00:00:29.580> is<00:00:29.789> actually

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
to solve that so the camera is actually

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.030 
to solve that so the camera is actually
working<00:00:30.390> in<00:00:30.599> conjunction<00:00:30.750> with<00:00:31.080> a<00:00:31.199> laser<00:00:31.650> and

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
working in conjunction with a laser and

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.819 
working in conjunction with a laser and
time-of-flight<00:00:32.550> technology<00:00:33.420> to<00:00:34.020> read<00:00:34.590> my

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
time-of-flight technology to read my

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.979 
time-of-flight technology to read my
hands<00:00:35.340> and<00:00:35.550> read<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.210> world<00:00:36.600> around<00:00:36.840> me

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
hands and read the the world around me

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.959 
hands and read the the world around me
to<00:00:37.200> an<00:00:37.260> extent<00:00:37.559> right<00:00:37.770> so<00:00:37.980> I'm<00:00:38.190> looking<00:00:38.489> down<00:00:38.670> I

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
to an extent right so I'm looking down I

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.970 
to an extent right so I'm looking down I
can<00:00:39.420> see<00:00:39.540> my<00:00:39.690> hands<00:00:40.079> I<00:00:40.230> can<00:00:40.350> see<00:00:40.440> them<00:00:40.590> turning

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
can see my hands I can see them turning

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.950 
can see my hands I can see them turning
you<00:00:41.219> can<00:00:41.340> see<00:00:41.520> my<00:00:41.640> sleeves<00:00:41.969> I<00:00:42.360> can<00:00:42.809> look<00:00:42.899> down

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
you can see my sleeves I can look down

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.560 
you can see my sleeves I can look down
and<00:00:43.110> see<00:00:43.320> my<00:00:43.440> legs<00:00:43.710> this<00:00:44.610> is<00:00:44.670> just<00:00:44.969> a<00:00:45.059> demo<00:00:45.300> kind

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
and see my legs this is just a demo kind

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.510 
and see my legs this is just a demo kind
of<00:00:45.690> demonstrating<00:00:46.289> how<00:00:46.680> this<00:00:46.890> stuff<00:00:47.070> works

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
of demonstrating how this stuff works

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.360 
of demonstrating how this stuff works
it<00:00:47.910> shows<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.570> cloud<00:00:49.379> of<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:49.829> world<00:00:50.039> around

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
it shows the cloud of the world around

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.400 
it shows the cloud of the world around
me<00:00:50.520> so<00:00:50.730> I<00:00:50.760> can<00:00:50.940> see<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.149> desk<00:00:51.390> to<00:00:51.989> an<00:00:52.079> extent

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
me so I can see the desk to an extent

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.369 
me so I can see the desk to an extent
and<00:00:53.280> I<00:00:53.370> can<00:00:53.520> see<00:00:53.760> there's<00:00:54.090> a<00:00:54.180> tripod<00:00:55.020> in<00:00:55.170> front

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
and I can see there's a tripod in front

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.529 
and I can see there's a tripod in front
of<00:00:55.440> me<00:00:55.559> holding<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:56.219> infrared<00:00:57.149> camera<00:00:57.510> that

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
of me holding the infrared camera that

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.619 
of me holding the infrared camera that
actually<00:00:57.719> tracks<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.530> stuff<00:00:59.280> on<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.789> dk2<00:01:00.239> so

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
actually tracks the stuff on the dk2 so

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.020 
actually tracks the stuff on the dk2 so
that<00:01:00.899> there's<00:01:01.079> depth<00:01:01.350> tracking<00:01:01.739> and<00:01:02.550> it's

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
that there's depth tracking and it's

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.109 
that there's depth tracking and it's
it's<00:01:03.780> a<00:01:03.989> whole<00:01:04.379> new<00:01:04.559> project<00:01:05.010> it's<00:01:05.129> a<00:01:05.250> 99<00:01:05.820> bucks

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
it's a whole new project it's a 99 bucks

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.580 
it's a whole new project it's a 99 bucks
and<00:01:06.420> you<00:01:06.510> can<00:01:06.659> back<00:01:06.840> it<00:01:07.020> right<00:01:07.229> now<00:01:07.409> in

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
and you can back it right now in

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.310 
and you can back it right now in
Kickstarter<00:01:08.159> and<00:01:08.820> it's<00:01:09.330> it's<00:01:10.229> very

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
Kickstarter and it's it's very

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.020 
Kickstarter and it's it's very
interesting<00:01:10.619> from<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.250> time<00:01:11.610> we've<00:01:11.760> used<00:01:11.909> it

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
interesting from the time we've used it

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.390 
interesting from the time we've used it
it's<00:01:12.180> still<00:01:12.360> rough<00:01:12.869> it's<00:01:13.409> still<00:01:13.619> prototype

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
it's still rough it's still prototype

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.270 
it's still rough it's still prototype
but<00:01:15.270> you<00:01:15.509> can<00:01:15.750> just<00:01:16.380> see<00:01:16.500> your<00:01:16.650> hands<00:01:17.070> like

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
but you can just see your hands like

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.560 
but you can just see your hands like
right<00:01:17.520> there's<00:01:17.759> a<00:01:17.820> there's<00:01:18.180> a<00:01:18.240> little<00:01:18.360> bit

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
right there's a there's a little bit

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.600 
right there's a there's a little bit
underneath<00:01:19.020> where<00:01:19.560> I<00:01:19.590> can<00:01:19.770> see<00:01:19.979> out<00:01:20.159> from<00:01:20.460> the

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
underneath where I can see out from the

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.850 
underneath where I can see out from the
headset<00:01:20.939> and<00:01:21.119> I<00:01:21.659> can<00:01:21.780> see<00:01:21.960> where<00:01:22.170> my<00:01:22.200> hand<00:01:22.590> and

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
headset and I can see where my hand and

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.460 
headset and I can see where my hand and
my<00:01:23.369> actual<00:01:24.000> human<00:01:24.450> body<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:25.170> virtual

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
my actual human body the virtual

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.800 
my actual human body the virtual
representation<00:01:25.740> versus<00:01:26.400> my<00:01:26.580> real<00:01:26.970> body<00:01:27.150> meet

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
representation versus my real body meet

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.469 
representation versus my real body meet
and<00:01:28.080> it's<00:01:28.470> pretty<00:01:28.950> spot-on<00:01:29.460> there's<00:01:30.299> still

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
and it's pretty spot-on there's still

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.660 
and it's pretty spot-on there's still
some<00:01:30.840> some<00:01:31.229> weirdness<00:01:31.500> I<00:01:31.890> mean<00:01:32.310> it's<00:01:32.460> still<00:01:32.610> a

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
some some weirdness I mean it's still a

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.700 
some some weirdness I mean it's still a
prototype<00:01:32.909> my<00:01:33.600> finger<00:01:33.869> doesn't<00:01:34.200> always<00:01:34.439> look

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
prototype my finger doesn't always look

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.370 
prototype my finger doesn't always look
perfect<00:01:35.040> immediately<00:01:35.909> but<00:01:36.570> it<00:01:36.720> works<00:01:37.259> out

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
perfect immediately but it works out

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.219 
perfect immediately but it works out
pretty<00:01:37.560> quick<00:01:37.920> it's<00:01:38.759> adjusting<00:01:39.420> for<00:01:39.600> it<00:01:39.750> it

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
pretty quick it's adjusting for it it

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.260 
pretty quick it's adjusting for it it
for<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:41.159> world<00:01:41.310> around<00:01:41.460> you<00:01:41.640> every<00:01:41.909> 20

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
for the the world around you every 20

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.569 
for the the world around you every 20
milliseconds<00:01:42.930> so<00:01:43.170> it's<00:01:43.439> working<00:01:44.250> out<00:01:44.399> the

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
milliseconds so it's working out the

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.969 
milliseconds so it's working out the
issues<00:01:45.420> that<00:01:45.450> might<00:01:45.840> crop<00:01:46.200> up<00:01:46.409> from<00:01:46.439> reading

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
issues that might crop up from reading

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.300 
issues that might crop up from reading
your<00:01:47.009> hands<00:01:47.399> pretty<00:01:47.700> quickly<00:01:47.970> and<00:01:48.840> it's<00:01:49.680> the

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
your hands pretty quickly and it's the

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.039 
your hands pretty quickly and it's the
first<00:01:50.549> promising<00:01:51.180> stuff<00:01:51.450> that<00:01:51.600> we've<00:01:51.689> seen<00:01:51.899> in

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
first promising stuff that we've seen in

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.319 
first promising stuff that we've seen in
terms<00:01:52.079> of<00:01:52.350> interaction<00:01:52.890> in<00:01:53.070> VR<00:01:53.399> outside<00:01:54.149> of<00:01:54.270> a

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
terms of interaction in VR outside of a

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.980 
terms of interaction in VR outside of a
controller<00:01:54.780> or<00:01:55.310> standing<00:01:56.310> in<00:01:56.549> a<00:01:56.990> crazy

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
controller or standing in a crazy

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.630 
controller or standing in a crazy
contraption<00:01:58.649> that<00:01:58.680> tracks<00:01:59.070> your<00:01:59.159> whole<00:01:59.399> body

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
contraption that tracks your whole body

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:00.560 
contraption that tracks your whole body
or<00:01:59.909> something<00:02:00.210> like<00:02:00.329> that

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
or something like that

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.719 
or something like that
it's<00:02:01.320> it's<00:02:01.680> kind<00:02:02.040> of<00:02:02.070> similar<00:02:02.280> to<00:02:02.549> something

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
it's it's kind of similar to something

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.749 
it's it's kind of similar to something
like<00:02:03.030> Kinect<00:02:03.659> but<00:02:04.320> obviously<00:02:05.040> a<00:02:05.130> lot<00:02:05.219> smaller

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
like Kinect but obviously a lot smaller

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.859 
like Kinect but obviously a lot smaller
and<00:02:06.090> it<00:02:06.540> bounced<00:02:07.170> right<00:02:07.439> here<00:02:07.619> on<00:02:07.799> the<00:02:08.039> dk2

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
and it bounced right here on the dk2

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:11.330 
and it bounced right here on the dk2
these<00:02:09.869> will<00:02:09.989> be<00:02:10.080> shipping<00:02:10.259> next<00:02:10.679> summer<00:02:11.099> if

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
these will be shipping next summer if

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.670 
these will be shipping next summer if
you<00:02:11.550> back<00:02:11.790> it<00:02:11.819> and<00:02:12.360> you've<00:02:12.569> got<00:02:12.720> another

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
you back it and you've got another

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.339 
you back it and you've got another
or<00:02:13.980> so<00:02:14.220> to<00:02:14.280> go<00:02:14.489> before<00:02:14.760> the<00:02:15.659> Kickstarter<00:02:16.140> is<00:02:16.200> up

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:16.349 
or so to go before the Kickstarter is up

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:17.809 
or so to go before the Kickstarter is up
so<00:02:16.530> you<00:02:16.590> can<00:02:16.799> still<00:02:17.010> get<00:02:17.220> in<00:02:17.340> on<00:02:17.489> it<00:02:17.610> if<00:02:17.730> you're

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
so you can still get in on it if you're

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:19.610 
so you can still get in on it if you're
looking<00:02:18.090> to<00:02:18.269> get<00:02:18.450> yourself<00:02:18.810> a<00:02:18.959> nimble<00:02:19.379> sense

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
looking to get yourself a nimble sense

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.520 
looking to get yourself a nimble sense
from<00:02:20.250> nimble<00:02:20.549> VR<00:02:20.790> we'll<00:02:21.720> hopefully<00:02:22.260> have<00:02:22.409> more

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
from nimble VR we'll hopefully have more

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.679 
from nimble VR we'll hopefully have more
in<00:02:23.340> the<00:02:23.459> next<00:02:23.670> year<00:02:23.849> or<00:02:23.879> so<00:02:24.000> before<00:02:24.299> this<00:02:24.540> thing

00:02:24.679 --> 00:02:24.689 
in the next year or so before this thing

00:02:24.689 --> 00:02:26.809 
in the next year or so before this thing
comes<00:02:24.900> out<00:02:25.079> on<00:02:25.260> the<00:02:25.409> nimble<00:02:25.680> sense<00:02:25.890> at

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
comes out on the nimble sense at

comes out on the nimble sense at
Engadget<00:02:27.420> view<00:02:27.930> maybe<00:02:28.829> we<00:02:28.950> need<00:02:29.099> to<00:02:29.129> change

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
Engadget view maybe we need to change

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.190 
Engadget view maybe we need to change
the<00:02:29.879> firmware<00:02:30.239> and<00:02:30.329> things<00:02:30.510> like<00:02:30.629> that<00:02:30.689> to<00:02:31.049> let

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
the firmware and things like that to let

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.750 
the firmware and things like that to let
them<00:02:31.349> do<00:02:31.500> this<00:02:31.650> better<00:02:31.769> and<00:02:32.069> then<00:02:32.489> obviously

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
them do this better and then obviously

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.670 
them do this better and then obviously
we've<00:02:33.090> got<00:02:33.120> some<00:02:33.510> version<00:02:34.049> 2<00:02:34.170> products<00:02:34.530> and

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
we've got some version 2 products and

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.229 
we've got some version 2 products and
working<00:02:34.920> on<00:02:35.010> in<00:02:35.099> the<00:02:35.159> lab<00:02:35.370> that<00:02:35.670> extend<00:02:36.060> this

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
working on in the lab that extend this

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:39.049 
working on in the lab that extend this
