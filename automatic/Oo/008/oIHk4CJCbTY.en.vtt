00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
going with a new edge and this is you

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.740 
going with a new edge and this is you
know<00:00:35.579> it's<00:00:35.700> got<00:00:35.820> a<00:00:35.850> lot<00:00:36.149> on<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.360> design

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
know it's got a lot on the design

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.299 
know it's got a lot on the design
language<00:00:36.989> the<00:00:37.290> teams<00:00:37.530> working<00:00:37.800> on<00:00:38.070> all<00:00:38.280> the

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
language the teams working on all the

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.580 
language the teams working on all the
cool<00:00:38.579> new<00:00:38.820> technology<00:00:39.540> so<00:00:39.840> it's<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.320> first

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
cool new technology so it's the first

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.530 
cool new technology so it's the first
time<00:00:40.739> we've<00:00:40.800> taken<00:00:41.100> a<00:00:41.250> ground-up<00:00:41.820> change<00:00:42.239> of

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
time we've taken a ground-up change of

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.139 
time we've taken a ground-up change of
the<00:00:42.629> edge<00:00:42.809> so<00:00:43.440> real<00:00:43.770> excited<00:00:44.190> about<00:00:44.340> that<00:00:44.550> ok

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
the edge so real excited about that ok

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.060 
the edge so real excited about that ok
can<00:00:45.629> you<00:00:45.719> tell<00:00:45.930> me<00:00:45.960> about<00:00:46.140> what<00:00:46.620> you<00:00:46.770> guys<00:00:46.890> are

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
can you tell me about what you guys are

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.290 
can you tell me about what you guys are
doing<00:00:47.100> here<00:00:47.430> what's<00:00:47.640> a<00:00:47.730> little<00:00:47.910> bit<00:00:48.000> different

on this and is the power to be the same
yeah<00:00:50.520> one<00:00:50.760> of<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:50.910> things<00:00:51.090> we're<00:00:51.210> really

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
yeah one of the things we're really

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:52.549

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
working on is you look at some of the

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.170 
working on is you look at some of the
cars<00:00:52.890> we've<00:00:53.129> launched<00:00:53.399> recently<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.850> design

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
cars we've launched recently the design

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.150 
cars we've launched recently the design
language<00:00:54.449> for<00:00:54.870> Ford<00:00:55.110> a<00:00:55.350> really<00:00:55.559> strong<00:00:55.800> design

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
language for Ford a really strong design

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.610 
language for Ford a really strong design
like<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.670> face<00:00:56.879> of<00:00:56.910> Ford<00:00:57.360> a<00:00:57.660> lot<00:00:57.809> more<00:00:57.960> agile<00:00:58.469> a

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
like the face of Ford a lot more agile a

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.349 
like the face of Ford a lot more agile a
lot<00:00:58.829> more<00:00:58.980> fresh<00:00:59.250> chicken<00:00:59.520> cars<00:00:59.760> so<00:01:00.270> we're

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
lot more fresh chicken cars so we're

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.090 
lot more fresh chicken cars so we're
really<00:01:00.570> applying<00:01:00.960> that<00:01:01.260> to<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.559> edge<00:01:01.680> yeah

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
really applying that to the edge yeah

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.830 
really applying that to the edge yeah
also<00:01:02.460> got<00:01:02.609> cool<00:01:02.850> technology<00:01:03.420> and<00:01:03.510> this<00:01:03.600> thing

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
also got cool technology and this thing

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.690 
also got cool technology and this thing

real fun and that shows you that the

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.230 
real fun and that shows you that the
EcoBoost<00:01:29.159> engines<00:01:29.549> what<00:01:29.700> we<00:01:29.790> can<00:01:29.939> do<00:01:30.090> with

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
EcoBoost engines what we can do with

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.730 
EcoBoost engines what we can do with
EcoBoost<00:01:30.720> engines<00:01:31.140> because<00:01:31.320> you<00:01:31.470> can<00:01:31.590> make

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
EcoBoost engines because you can make

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.859 
EcoBoost engines because you can make
them<00:01:31.950> to<00:01:32.549> be<00:01:32.700> kind<00:01:33.090> of<00:01:33.150> more<00:01:33.270> efficient<00:01:33.780> and
