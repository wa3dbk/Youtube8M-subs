what<00:00:54.930> I<00:00:54.960> think<00:00:55.530> to<00:00:55.739> be<00:00:55.850> hand<00:00:56.850> checkering<00:00:57.390> done

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:57.800 
what I think to be hand checkering done

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.470 
what I think to be hand checkering done
the<00:00:58.800> reason<00:00:59.190> I<00:00:59.309> say<00:00:59.550> I<00:00:59.579> think<00:00:59.730> it's<00:01:00.030> hand<00:01:00.270> done

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
the reason I say I think it's hand done

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.240 
the reason I say I think it's hand done
is<00:01:00.690> because<00:01:00.870> it<00:01:01.199> is<00:01:01.350> impure<00:01:01.800> there<00:01:02.100> are

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
is because it is impure there are

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.299 
is because it is impure there are
imperfections<00:01:02.910> here<00:01:03.390> and<00:01:03.539> there<00:01:03.690> and<00:01:04.010> on<00:01:05.010> mine

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
imperfections here and there and on mine

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.750 
imperfections here and there and on mine
if<00:01:05.640> you<00:01:06.030> see<00:01:06.299> where<00:01:06.920> the<00:01:07.920> checkering<00:01:08.400> runs

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
if you see where the checkering runs

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.469 
if you see where the checkering runs
through<00:01:09.090> that<00:01:09.270> hole<00:01:09.540> in<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:09.840> lanyard<00:01:10.470> hole

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:11.479 
through that hole in the lanyard hole

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
used one piece of wood kind of a cool

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:47.899 
used one piece of wood kind of a cool
design<00:01:42.869> there<00:01:44.360> one<00:01:45.360> piece<00:01:45.630> of<00:01:45.780> wood<00:01:45.960> and<00:01:46.909> this

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
design there one piece of wood and this

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.109 
design there one piece of wood and this
is<00:01:48.119> a<00:01:48.350> hollow<00:01:49.350> grind

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:50.119 
is a hollow grind

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:53.240 
is a hollow grind
it's<00:01:51.119> very<00:01:51.509> hollow<00:01:51.840> so<00:01:52.200> it's<00:01:52.350> very<00:01:52.500> thin<00:01:52.950> on

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
it's very hollow so it's very thin on

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.959 
it's very hollow so it's very thin on
the<00:01:53.310> edge<00:01:54.350> if<00:01:55.350> you<00:01:55.560> can<00:01:55.740> see<00:01:56.009> how<00:01:56.219> thin<00:01:56.729> that

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
the edge if you can see how thin that

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:02.179 
the edge if you can see how thin that
edge<00:01:57.180> is<00:01:58.130> but<00:01:59.130> that<00:01:59.340> tells<00:01:59.850> you<00:02:00.680> the<00:02:01.680> thinness

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
edge is but that tells you the thinness

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.209 
edge is but that tells you the thinness
of<00:02:02.399> the<00:02:02.759> knife<00:02:03.060> at<00:02:03.390> the<00:02:03.750> edge<00:02:03.930> when<00:02:04.890> you<00:02:05.009> have<00:02:05.189> a

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
of the knife at the edge when you have a

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:08.270 
of the knife at the edge when you have a
very<00:02:05.520> thin<00:02:05.969> edge<00:02:06.210> down<00:02:06.540> here<00:02:06.649> the<00:02:07.649> edge<00:02:07.860> when

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
very thin edge down here the edge when

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.130 
very thin edge down here the edge when
I'm<00:02:08.399> saying<00:02:08.700> the<00:02:08.849> edge<00:02:08.970> the<00:02:09.300> secondary<00:02:09.899> bevel

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
I'm saying the edge the secondary bevel

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.390 
I'm saying the edge the secondary bevel
that<00:02:10.470> you<00:02:10.560> know<00:02:10.649> the<00:02:10.830> part<00:02:11.099> that<00:02:11.280> you<00:02:11.370> can

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
that you know the part that you can

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.020 
that you know the part that you can
actually<00:02:11.940> cut<00:02:12.209> and<00:02:12.420> sharpen

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
actually cut and sharpen

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.620 
actually cut and sharpen
and<00:02:13.120> see<00:02:14.070> if<00:02:15.070> that's<00:02:15.370> very<00:02:15.490> thin<00:02:16.000> then<00:02:16.480> the

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
and see if that's very thin then the

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.230 
and see if that's very thin then the
steel<00:02:16.870> is<00:02:17.020> very<00:02:17.200> thin<00:02:17.500> right<00:02:17.740> there<00:02:18.120> so<00:02:19.120> this

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:19.240 
steel is very thin right there so this

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.510 
steel is very thin right there so this
