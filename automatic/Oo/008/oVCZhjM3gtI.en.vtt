00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
barrels of Woodford together to build a

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.270 
barrels of Woodford together to build a
consistent<00:00:48.059> flavor<00:00:48.239> profile<00:00:48.899> that's<00:00:49.770> because

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
consistent flavor profile that's because

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.240 
consistent flavor profile that's because
no<00:00:50.730> single<00:00:51.090> barrel<00:00:51.719> at<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.620> what<00:00:52.770> reservist

no single barrel at the what reservist
to<00:00:53.399> learn<00:00:53.579> is<00:00:53.850> what<00:00:54.449> reserve<00:00:54.870> by<00:00:55.170> itself

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
to learn is what reserve by itself

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.610 
to learn is what reserve by itself
because<00:00:56.489> barrels<00:00:56.879> are<00:00:57.030> as<00:00:57.149> individual<00:00:57.780> as<00:00:57.930> all

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
because barrels are as individual as all

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.240 
because barrels are as individual as all
of<00:00:58.800> us<00:00:58.949> are<00:00:59.190> so<00:00:59.879> you<00:00:59.969> taste<00:01:00.539> barrels<00:01:01.250> identify

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
of us are so you taste barrels identify

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.640 
of us are so you taste barrels identify
their<00:01:02.550> predominant<00:01:02.879> flavors<00:01:03.600> matching<00:01:04.470> those

confectionery type notes a couple of

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.670 
confectionery type notes a couple of

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.040 
barrels would be very fruity s32 of the
barrels<00:01:37.920> lugar<00:01:38.280> is<00:01:38.460> spice<00:01:38.869> two<00:01:39.869> of<00:01:39.960> the

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:40.050 
barrels lugar is spice two of the

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:41.510 
barrels lugar is spice two of the
barrels<00:01:40.410> will<00:01:40.800> have<00:01:40.920> a<00:01:40.950> lot<00:01:41.190> of<00:01:41.220> wood

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
barrels will have a lot of wood

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.400 
barrels will have a lot of wood
character<00:01:42.060> and<00:01:42.420> two<00:01:42.750> of<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:42.899> barrels<00:01:43.229> will

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:43.410 
character and two of the barrels will

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:45.380 
character and two of the barrels will
exhibit<00:01:43.890> some<00:01:44.160> grain<00:01:44.460> and

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
exhibit some grain and

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.140 
exhibit some grain and
so<00:01:46.320> matching<00:01:47.159> those<00:01:47.310> together<00:01:47.550> would<00:01:48.030> have

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:48.150 
so matching those together would have

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.750 
so matching those together would have
been<00:01:48.300> a<00:01:48.330> batch<00:01:48.720> of<00:01:48.750> wood<00:01:49.140> but<00:01:49.770> we<00:01:49.979> sample<00:01:50.610> those
