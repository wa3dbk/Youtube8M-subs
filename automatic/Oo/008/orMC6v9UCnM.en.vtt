00:01:09.999 --> 00:01:10.009 
thought this was the real successor or

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:11.950 
thought this was the real successor or
the<00:01:10.220> next<00:01:10.520> transformation<00:01:10.909> after<00:01:11.360> Super

the next transformation after Super
Saiyan<00:01:12.140> 3<00:01:12.229> I<00:01:12.759> thought<00:01:13.759> this<00:01:13.909> was<00:01:14.119> going<00:01:14.270> to<00:01:14.450> be

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 
Saiyan 3 I thought this was going to be

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.539 
Saiyan 3 I thought this was going to be
like<00:01:14.780> Akira<00:01:15.259> Toriyama's<00:01:15.829> version<00:01:16.159> of<00:01:16.280> Super

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:16.549 
like Akira Toriyama's version of Super

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:19.419 
like Akira Toriyama's version of Super
Saiyan<00:01:16.759> 4<00:01:17.030> the<00:01:17.539> Canon<00:01:17.929> Super<00:01:18.229> Saiyan<00:01:18.439> 4<00:01:18.679> but

00:01:19.419 --> 00:01:19.429 
Saiyan 4 the Canon Super Saiyan 4 but

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:21.190 
Saiyan 4 the Canon Super Saiyan 4 but
that's<00:01:20.090> not<00:01:20.299> what<00:01:20.450> it<00:01:20.539> turned<00:01:20.719> out<00:01:20.810> to<00:01:20.960> be<00:01:20.990> in

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
that's not what it turned out to be in

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.219 
that's not what it turned out to be in
and<00:01:21.590> let<00:01:21.829> me<00:01:21.920> tell<00:01:22.100> you<00:01:22.219> why<00:01:22.749> the<00:01:23.749> reason<00:01:24.109> this

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:24.229 
and let me tell you why the reason this

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:26.139 
and let me tell you why the reason this
isn't<00:01:24.499> the<00:01:25.100> next<00:01:25.369> transformation<00:01:25.670> after

00:01:26.139 --> 00:01:26.149

Super<00:01:26.390> Saiyan<00:01:26.600> 3<00:01:26.659> is<00:01:26.990> because<00:01:27.640> Goku<00:01:28.640> isn't<00:01:29.060> the

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
Super Saiyan 3 is because Goku isn't the

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.399 
Super Saiyan 3 is because Goku isn't the
first<00:01:29.749> Super<00:01:30.259> Saiyan<00:01:30.439> God<00:01:30.619> Super<00:01:31.960> Saiyan<00:01:32.960> God

but<00:01:37.880> he<00:01:37.999> failed<00:01:38.329> because<00:01:38.539> he<00:01:38.719> ran<00:01:38.960> out<00:01:38.990> of<00:01:39.109> time

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.030 
but he failed because he ran out of time

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.370 
but he failed because he ran out of time
that<00:01:41.030> right<00:01:41.270> there<00:01:41.509> just<00:01:41.539> proves<00:01:42.020> it

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
that right there just proves it

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.219 
that right there just proves it
it<00:01:42.939> proves<00:01:43.939> that<00:01:44.119> this<00:01:44.299> isn't<00:01:44.539> the<00:01:44.719> next<00:01:45.020> Super

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229 
it proves that this isn't the next Super

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:48.039 
it proves that this isn't the next Super
Saiyan<00:01:45.439> transformation<00:01:46.039> because<00:01:46.389> it's<00:01:47.389> just

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:48.049 
Saiyan transformation because it's just

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:51.160

a<00:01:48.139> power<00:01:48.350> boost<00:01:48.679> for<00:01:49.130> the<00:01:49.310> same<00:01:49.520> using<00:01:49.999> it<00:01:50.170> now

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 
a power boost for the same using it now

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:52.539 
a power boost for the same using it now
here's<00:01:52.069> why

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:52.549 
here's why

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:54.580 
here's why
obviously<00:01:53.389> there<00:01:53.600> weren't<00:01:53.840> any<00:01:54.020> Super<00:01:54.380> Saiyan

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
obviously there weren't any Super Saiyan

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.730 
obviously there weren't any Super Saiyan

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
that any sane before him on Planet

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.769 
that any sane before him on Planet
Vegeta<00:02:03.289> would<00:02:03.709> have<00:02:03.920> this<00:02:04.130> type<00:02:04.369> of<00:02:04.399> power

00:02:04.769 --> 00:02:04.779 
Vegeta would have this type of power

00:02:04.779 --> 00:02:07.029 
Vegeta would have this type of power
otherwise<00:02:05.779> they<00:02:06.170> would<00:02:06.319> have<00:02:06.350> survived<00:02:06.740> until

00:02:07.029 --> 00:02:07.039 
otherwise they would have survived until
