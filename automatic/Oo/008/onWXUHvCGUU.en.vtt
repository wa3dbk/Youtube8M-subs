and the beta i went and tried this and

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
you can also see the stopwatch at the

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.160 
you can also see the stopwatch at the
bottom<00:00:21.090> show<00:00:21.240> and<00:00:21.390> how<00:00:21.570> I'm<00:00:21.720> how<00:00:21.869> long<00:00:22.050> the

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
bottom show and how I'm how long the

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.259 
bottom show and how I'm how long the
kills<00:00:22.410> are<00:00:22.529> taken<00:00:22.830> and<00:00:22.949> I<00:00:23.609> tried<00:00:23.880> it<00:00:24.000> and<00:00:24.119> I<00:00:24.180> was

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
kills are taken and I tried it and I was

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:25.880 
kills are taken and I tried it and I was
actually<00:00:24.510> very<00:00:24.720> surprised<00:00:25.410> where<00:00:25.769> these

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
actually very surprised where these

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.160 
actually very surprised where these
supplies<00:00:26.250> i<00:00:26.430> took<00:00:26.670> I'm<00:00:27.330> i<00:00:27.480> was<00:00:27.599> expecting<00:00:27.900> the

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
supplies i took I'm i was expecting the

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.019 
supplies i took I'm i was expecting the
last<00:00:28.380> like<00:00:28.619> easily<00:00:28.980> like<00:00:29.099> 10<00:00:29.369> kills<00:00:29.699> or<00:00:29.880> so

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
last like easily like 10 kills or so

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.910 
last like easily like 10 kills or so
because<00:00:30.630> that's<00:00:30.929> what<00:00:31.140> i<00:00:31.170> would<00:00:31.380> expect<00:00:31.410> to<00:00:31.800> do

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
because that's what i would expect to do

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.139 
because that's what i would expect to do
in<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:32.099> live<00:00:32.250> game<00:00:32.279> probably<00:00:32.700> a<00:00:32.910> lot<00:00:33.120> more

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
in the live game probably a lot more

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.060 
in the live game probably a lot more
with<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.600> inventory<00:00:34.050> i<00:00:34.110> had<00:00:34.290> and<00:00:34.500> i<00:00:34.920> know<00:00:35.040> that

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
with the inventory i had and i know that

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.490 
with the inventory i had and i know that
rock<00:00:35.550> tails<00:00:35.850> are<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:36.360> new<00:00:36.630> thing<00:00:36.989> in<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.290> beta

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
rock tails are the new thing in the beta

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.920 
rock tails are the new thing in the beta
but<00:00:37.890> I<00:00:38.100> did<00:00:38.820> go<00:00:38.969> with<00:00:39.120> bruising<00:00:39.480> and<00:00:39.570> it<00:00:39.780> was

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
but I did go with bruising and it was

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.959 
but I did go with bruising and it was
very<00:00:40.170> difficult<00:00:40.590> to<00:00:40.920> actually<00:00:41.070> kill<00:00:41.489> bandos

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
very difficult to actually kill bandos

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.389 
very difficult to actually kill bandos
as<00:00:42.180> you<00:00:42.270> can<00:00:42.420> see<00:00:42.540> that<00:00:42.690> kill<00:00:42.899> took<00:00:43.140> me<00:00:43.410> quite<00:00:44.280> a

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
as you can see that kill took me quite a

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.540 
as you can see that kill took me quite a
long<00:00:44.579> time<00:00:44.610> and<00:00:45.059> I<00:00:46.020> just<00:00:46.379> I<00:00:46.649> actually<00:00:47.160> like

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
long time and I just I actually like

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.340 
long time and I just I actually like
knew<00:00:47.820> what<00:00:47.969> abilities<00:00:48.420> i<00:00:48.629> was<00:00:48.780> using<00:00:49.020> pretty

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
knew what abilities i was using pretty

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.439 
knew what abilities i was using pretty
much<00:00:49.500> I<00:00:49.710> was<00:00:49.920> just<00:00:50.100> I'm<00:00:50.760> you<00:00:50.940> trying<00:00:51.270> to<00:00:51.329> use

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
much I was just I'm you trying to use

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.540 
much I was just I'm you trying to use
the<00:00:51.480> correct<00:00:51.809> ones<00:00:52.140> and<00:00:52.440> I<00:00:53.190> thought<00:00:53.340> that<00:00:53.399> I

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
the correct ones and I thought that I

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.340 
the correct ones and I thought that I
might<00:00:53.730> just<00:00:53.910> be<00:00:54.030> bad<00:00:54.210> at<00:00:54.329> ability<00:00:54.719> so<00:00:54.960> i<00:00:54.989> tried

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
might just be bad at ability so i tried

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.439 
might just be bad at ability so i tried
to<00:00:55.379> use<00:00:55.500> actually<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.399> momentum<00:00:57.030> ability

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
to use actually the momentum ability

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.799 
to use actually the momentum ability
which<00:00:58.079> is<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.350> one<00:00:58.530> that<00:00:58.710> makes<00:00:58.890> you<00:00:59.100> hit<00:00:59.309> like

00:00:59.799 --> 00:00:59.809 
which is the one that makes you hit like

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:02.540 
which is the one that makes you hit like
constantly<00:01:00.809> without<00:01:01.680> having<00:01:02.070> to<00:01:02.160> use<00:01:02.280> the

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
constantly without having to use the

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.820 
constantly without having to use the
action<00:01:03.270> bar<00:01:03.420> that's<00:01:04.080> why<00:01:04.199> i'm<00:01:04.290> not<00:01:04.320> using<00:01:04.619> the

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
action bar that's why i'm not using the

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.010 
action bar that's why i'm not using the
action<00:01:05.070> bar<00:01:05.189> right<00:01:05.339> now<00:01:05.489> and<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:06.360> result<00:01:06.900> was

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
action bar right now and the result was

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.130 
action bar right now and the result was
almost<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.500> same<00:01:07.710> i<00:01:07.770> got<00:01:08.130> to<00:01:08.430> a<00:01:08.689> we'll<00:01:09.689> see<00:01:09.869> how

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
almost the same i got to a we'll see how

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.570 
almost the same i got to a we'll see how
long<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.439> time<00:01:10.650> was<00:01:10.860> but<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.159> momentum

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
long the time was but the momentum

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.520 
long the time was but the momentum
ability<00:01:12.000> don't<00:01:12.720> really<00:01:12.960> help<00:01:13.049> me<00:01:13.200> that<00:01:13.320> much

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
ability don't really help me that much

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.060 
ability don't really help me that much
so<00:01:13.920> I<00:01:13.950> can<00:01:14.250> pretty<00:01:14.400> much<00:01:14.750> from<00:01:15.750> an<00:01:16.320> analyzing

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
so I can pretty much from an analyzing

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.249 
so I can pretty much from an analyzing
these<00:01:17.220> two<00:01:18.060> kills<00:01:18.360> and<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.780> other<00:01:18.900> one<00:01:19.080> that

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
these two kills and the other one that

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.670 
these two kills and the other one that
is<00:01:19.470> well<00:01:19.710> that<00:01:20.040> bandos<00:01:20.640> is<00:01:21.030> going<00:01:21.509> to<00:01:21.780> be<00:01:22.020> a<00:01:22.259> lot

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
is well that bandos is going to be a lot

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.859 
is well that bandos is going to be a lot
slower<00:01:22.890> and<00:01:23.340> harder<00:01:23.729> to<00:01:23.820> kill<00:01:24.090> unless<00:01:24.390> there

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
slower and harder to kill unless there

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.660 
slower and harder to kill unless there
are<00:01:24.900> some<00:01:25.110> new<00:01:25.229> tactics<00:01:25.740> that<00:01:25.830> I'm<00:01:26.130> just<00:01:26.490> not

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
are some new tactics that I'm just not

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.240 
are some new tactics that I'm just not
aware<00:01:26.820> of<00:01:27.000> yet<00:01:27.270> and<00:01:27.619> it's<00:01:28.619> going<00:01:28.860> to<00:01:28.950> take<00:01:29.040> time

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
aware of yet and it's going to take time

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.899 
aware of yet and it's going to take time
to<00:01:29.430> find<00:01:29.670> them<00:01:29.820> new<00:01:30.000> tactics<00:01:31.700> okay<00:01:32.700> so<00:01:32.790> I'm

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
to find them new tactics okay so I'm

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:33.920 
to find them new tactics okay so I'm
gonna<00:01:33.000> go<00:01:33.119> ahead<00:01:33.150> and<00:01:33.299> move<00:01:33.420> home<00:01:33.570> to<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.780> wife

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
gonna go ahead and move home to the wife

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.030 
gonna go ahead and move home to the wife
gain<00:01:34.799> and<00:01:35.270> vanda<00:01:36.270> skill<00:01:36.570> is<00:01:36.780> actually<00:01:37.680> fairly

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
gain and vanda skill is actually fairly

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.520 
gain and vanda skill is actually fairly
easy<00:01:38.430> in<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.759> live<00:01:38.880> game<00:01:39.229> you'll<00:01:40.229> get<00:01:40.350> to<00:01:40.439> see

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
easy in the live game you'll get to see

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.889 
easy in the live game you'll get to see
the<00:01:40.619> time<00:01:40.860> but<00:01:41.250> compared<00:01:41.700> to<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:41.970> beta<00:01:42.150> this

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
the time but compared to the beta this

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.340 
the time but compared to the beta this
is<00:01:42.960> ten<00:01:43.530> times<00:01:43.560> easier<00:01:43.979> and<00:01:44.430> you<00:01:44.909> can<00:01:45.390> get<00:01:45.600> four

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
is ten times easier and you can get four

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.499 
is ten times easier and you can get four
kills<00:01:46.770> in<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.189> live<00:01:47.399> game<00:01:47.430> compared<00:01:48.210> to<00:01:48.420> the

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
kills in the live game compared to the

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.780 
kills in the live game compared to the
one<00:01:48.720> you'd<00:01:48.869> get<00:01:49.049> in<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.229> beta<00:01:49.579> this<00:01:50.579> does

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
one you'd get in the beta this does

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.399 
one you'd get in the beta this does
bring<00:01:50.820> some<00:01:51.240> concerns<00:01:51.630> to<00:01:51.840> me<00:01:51.960> I'm<00:01:52.079> thinking

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
bring some concerns to me I'm thinking

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.440 
bring some concerns to me I'm thinking
that<00:01:52.590> bandos<00:01:53.549> gear<00:01:53.850> and<00:01:54.000> stuff<00:01:54.180> could

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
that bandos gear and stuff could

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.600 
that bandos gear and stuff could
possibly<00:01:54.899> rise<00:01:55.170> on<00:01:56.009> it<00:01:56.189> because<00:01:56.340> it's<00:01:56.520> going

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
possibly rise on it because it's going

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.899 
possibly rise on it because it's going
to<00:01:56.670> be<00:01:56.759> a<00:01:56.790> lot<00:01:56.909> harder<00:01:57.090> to<00:01:57.299> get<00:01:57.450> it<00:01:58.790> also<00:01:59.790> it's

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
to be a lot harder to get it also it's

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.580 
to be a lot harder to get it also it's
just<00:01:59.939> going<00:02:00.180> to<00:02:00.210> be<00:02:00.270> a<00:02:00.329> lot<00:02:00.540> more<00:02:00.600> fun<00:02:01.079> in<00:02:01.409> my

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
just going to be a lot more fun in my

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.340 
just going to be a lot more fun in my
opinion<00:02:01.950> to<00:02:02.189> boss<00:02:02.840> well<00:02:03.840> I<00:02:03.869> don't<00:02:04.170> know<00:02:04.259> if

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
opinion to boss well I don't know if

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.510 
opinion to boss well I don't know if
it'll<00:02:04.439> be<00:02:04.560> more<00:02:04.710> fun<00:02:04.740> but<00:02:05.100> it's<00:02:05.219> just<00:02:05.340> going<00:02:05.490> to

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
it'll be more fun but it's just going to

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.119 
it'll be more fun but it's just going to
be<00:02:05.579> a<00:02:05.640> lot<00:02:05.790> tougher<00:02:06.000> to<00:02:06.270> do<00:02:06.390> it<00:02:06.920> so<00:02:07.920> a<00:02:07.950> lot<00:02:08.099> of

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
be a lot tougher to do it so a lot of

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:09.139 
be a lot tougher to do it so a lot of
people<00:02:08.280> now<00:02:08.429> are<00:02:08.550> just<00:02:08.729> used<00:02:08.910> to<00:02:09.000> easily

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
people now are just used to easily

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.460 
people now are just used to easily
getting<00:02:09.569> the<00:02:09.629> kill<00:02:09.810> and<00:02:10.020> now<00:02:10.080> in<00:02:10.289> the<00:02:10.349> Bay

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
getting the kill and now in the Bay

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:11.390 
getting the kill and now in the Bay
that's<00:02:10.590> going<00:02:10.679> to<00:02:10.800> take<00:02:10.920> a<00:02:10.979> little<00:02:11.099> bit<00:02:11.280> more

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
that's going to take a little bit more

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.880 
that's going to take a little bit more
time

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
time

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.980 
time
so<00:02:13.890> this<00:02:14.100> was<00:02:14.820> one<00:02:15.120> of<00:02:15.150> the<00:02:15.300> fastest<00:02:15.720> kills<00:02:15.930> I

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
so this was one of the fastest kills I

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.450 
so this was one of the fastest kills I
got<00:02:16.170> so<00:02:16.380> I<00:02:16.410> thought<00:02:16.590> I'd<00:02:16.710> go<00:02:16.890> and<00:02:17.040> show<00:02:17.190> it<00:02:17.340> as

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
got so I thought I'd go and show it as

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:20.780 
got so I thought I'd go and show it as
well<00:02:17.700> I<00:02:18.260> believe<00:02:19.260> it<00:02:19.620> was<00:02:19.680> a<00:02:19.770> 50-second<00:02:20.550> kill

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
well I believe it was a 50-second kill

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.430 
well I believe it was a 50-second kill
and<00:02:21.000> that's<00:02:21.510> just<00:02:21.570> showing<00:02:21.870> you<00:02:22.050> that<00:02:22.110> in<00:02:22.350> the

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
and that's just showing you that in the

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.140 
and that's just showing you that in the
beta<00:02:22.620> that<00:02:22.920> your<00:02:23.190> max<00:02:23.370> kill<00:02:23.670> time<00:02:23.880> was<00:02:24.060> about

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
beta that your max kill time was about

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.330 
beta that your max kill time was about
you<00:02:24.810> would<00:02:24.900> get<00:02:24.990> a<00:02:25.050> kill<00:02:25.350> a<00:02:25.380> fast<00:02:25.890> one<00:02:26.130> in<00:02:26.220> like

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
you would get a kill a fast one in like

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.740 
you would get a kill a fast one in like
three<00:02:26.610> minutes<00:02:26.790> and<00:02:26.970> 20<00:02:27.150> seconds<00:02:27.540> I<00:02:27.630> would

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
three minutes and 20 seconds I would

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.900 
three minutes and 20 seconds I would
average<00:02:27.900> and<00:02:28.290> in<00:02:28.920> the<00:02:28.980> live<00:02:29.160> game<00:02:29.190> you<00:02:29.640> can<00:02:29.790> get

average and in the live game you can get

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.510 
average and in the live game you can get
it<00:02:30.000> in<00:02:30.090> about<00:02:30.300> 50<00:02:30.750> seconds<00:02:31.230> okay<00:02:31.980> so<00:02:32.040> for<00:02:32.430> the
