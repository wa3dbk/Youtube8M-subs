00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
the carburetor but right here when this

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.090 
the carburetor but right here when this

rust<00:04:30.849> on<00:04:30.999> the<00:04:31.089> outside<00:04:31.979> the<00:04:32.979> somebody<00:04:34.080> decided

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:35.080 
rust on the outside the somebody decided

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:36.839 
rust on the outside the somebody decided
they<00:04:35.199> wanted<00:04:35.499> to<00:04:35.559> cut<00:04:35.799> six<00:04:36.069> by<00:04:36.279> nine<00:04:36.309> speakers

00:04:36.839 --> 00:04:36.849 
they wanted to cut six by nine speakers

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:39.179 
they wanted to cut six by nine speakers
in<00:04:37.239> them<00:04:37.389> I<00:04:37.659> don't<00:04:38.439> know<00:04:38.589> why<00:04:38.739> that<00:04:38.949> always

00:04:39.179 --> 00:04:39.189 
in them I don't know why that always

00:04:39.189 --> 00:04:41.399 
in them I don't know why that always
happens<00:04:39.610> on<00:04:39.729> these<00:04:39.879> trucks<00:04:40.179> I've<00:04:41.079> got<00:04:41.259> some

00:04:41.399 --> 00:04:41.409 
happens on these trucks I've got some

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:44.129 
happens on these trucks I've got some
ideas<00:04:41.529> on<00:04:41.919> a<00:04:41.949> patch<00:04:42.189> for<00:04:42.489> that<00:04:42.669> I<00:04:43.059> do<00:04:43.599> have<00:04:44.110> a

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:44.139 
ideas on a patch for that I do have a

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:46.259 
ideas on a patch for that I do have a
little<00:04:44.469> bit<00:04:44.589> of<00:04:44.769> rust<00:04:44.979> right<00:04:45.279> down<00:04:45.489> here<00:04:45.759> this

00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:46.269 
little bit of rust right down here this

00:04:46.269 --> 00:04:48.569 
little bit of rust right down here this
is<00:04:46.449> the<00:04:46.629> passenger<00:04:47.289> side<00:04:47.559> door<00:04:47.829> I<00:04:48.159> don't

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:48.579 
is the passenger side door I don't

00:04:48.579 --> 00:04:52.169 
is the passenger side door I don't
believe<00:04:49.089> the<00:04:49.329> driver<00:04:49.809> side<00:04:50.049> has<00:04:50.349> any<00:04:51.179> steps

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:52.179 
believe the driver side has any steps

00:04:52.179 --> 00:04:54.149 
believe the driver side has any steps
are<00:04:52.389> unbelievably<00:04:53.199> in<00:04:53.349> good<00:04:53.529> condition<00:04:54.009> and

00:04:54.149 --> 00:04:54.159 
are unbelievably in good condition and

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:57.119 
are unbelievably in good condition and
so<00:04:54.309> are<00:04:54.429> the<00:04:54.519> rockers<00:04:54.969> underneath<00:04:55.860> floor<00:04:56.860> pans

00:04:57.119 --> 00:04:57.129 
so are the rockers underneath floor pans

00:04:57.129 --> 00:05:00.389 
so are the rockers underneath floor pans
are<00:04:57.369> in<00:04:57.459> really<00:04:57.610> good<00:04:57.729> shape<00:04:58.949> you<00:04:59.949> can't<00:05:00.189> tell

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:00.399 
are in really good shape you can't tell

00:05:00.399 --> 00:05:03.239 
are in really good shape you can't tell
the<00:05:00.489> transmission<00:05:01.059> tunnel<00:05:01.300> cover<00:05:02.009> has<00:05:03.009> been

00:05:03.239 --> 00:05:03.249 
the transmission tunnel cover has been

00:05:03.249 --> 00:05:05.729 
the transmission tunnel cover has been
cut<00:05:03.639> I<00:05:03.819> believe<00:05:04.119> to<00:05:04.479> put<00:05:04.689> the<00:05:04.839> four-speed<00:05:05.589> in

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:05.739 
cut I believe to put the four-speed in

00:05:05.739 --> 00:05:07.109 
cut I believe to put the four-speed in
because<00:05:06.009> originally<00:05:06.429> this<00:05:06.489> was<00:05:06.550> a<00:05:06.819> three<00:05:07.029> on

00:05:07.109 --> 00:05:07.119 
because originally this was a three on

00:05:07.119 --> 00:05:10.709 
because originally this was a three on
the<00:05:07.149> tree<00:05:08.099> we've<00:05:09.099> got<00:05:09.369> the<00:05:09.610> nasty<00:05:10.239> hole<00:05:10.449> in<00:05:10.629> the

00:05:10.709 --> 00:05:10.719 
the tree we've got the nasty hole in the

00:05:10.719 --> 00:05:13.529 
the tree we've got the nasty hole in the
dash<00:05:10.929> for<00:05:11.349> a<00:05:11.889> radio<00:05:12.189> I'm<00:05:12.819> gonna<00:05:12.969> patch<00:05:13.209> that<00:05:13.479> up

00:05:13.529 --> 00:05:13.539 
dash for a radio I'm gonna patch that up

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:16.199 
dash for a radio I'm gonna patch that up
I<00:05:13.899> think<00:05:14.709> I'll<00:05:14.949> put<00:05:15.189> the<00:05:15.459> radio<00:05:15.879> in<00:05:16.089> the

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:16.209 
I think I'll put the radio in the

00:05:16.209 --> 00:05:18.149 
I think I'll put the radio in the
glovebox<00:05:16.419> but<00:05:17.050> of<00:05:17.319> course<00:05:17.589> there's<00:05:17.860> no<00:05:18.099> you

00:05:18.149 --> 00:05:18.159 
glovebox but of course there's no you

00:05:18.159 --> 00:05:20.669 
glovebox but of course there's no you
can't<00:05:18.489> see<00:05:18.669> it<00:05:18.759> here<00:05:18.909> there's<00:05:19.449> no<00:05:19.719> interior

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:20.679 
can't see it here there's no interior

00:05:20.679 --> 00:05:23.279 
can't see it here there's no interior
and<00:05:20.949> they<00:05:21.009> go<00:05:21.129> bottom<00:05:21.839> you<00:05:22.839> could<00:05:22.959> see<00:05:23.139> the

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:23.289 
and they go bottom you could see the

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:25.169 
and they go bottom you could see the
green<00:05:23.559> that<00:05:24.309> was<00:05:24.429> the<00:05:24.550> original<00:05:24.639> color<00:05:25.029> of<00:05:25.089> the

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:25.179 
green that was the original color of the

00:05:25.179 --> 00:05:27.269 
green that was the original color of the
truck<00:05:25.479> the<00:05:26.349> glass<00:05:26.559> is<00:05:26.769> in<00:05:26.799> pretty<00:05:27.069> good<00:05:27.219> shape

00:05:27.269 --> 00:05:27.279 
truck the glass is in pretty good shape

00:05:27.279 --> 00:05:30.600 
truck the glass is in pretty good shape
I<00:05:27.849> do<00:05:28.539> have<00:05:28.929> one<00:05:29.289> star<00:05:29.799> in<00:05:30.039> the<00:05:30.129> windshield

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:30.610 
I do have one star in the windshield

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:32.549 
I do have one star in the windshield
right<00:05:30.849> there<00:05:31.179> and<00:05:31.539> another<00:05:31.809> one<00:05:32.139> down<00:05:32.169> there<00:05:32.529> I

00:05:32.549 --> 00:05:32.559 
right there and another one down there I

00:05:32.559 --> 00:05:35.219 
right there and another one down there I
think<00:05:32.619> they<00:05:32.919> could<00:05:33.099> be<00:05:33.129> fixed<00:05:33.519> and<00:05:34.449> all<00:05:35.079> the

00:05:35.219 --> 00:05:35.229 
think they could be fixed and all the

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:39.149 
think they could be fixed and all the
rubber<00:05:35.669> gaskets<00:05:36.669> are<00:05:36.999> hard<00:05:37.659> as<00:05:37.779> a<00:05:37.809> rock<00:05:37.899> and<00:05:38.499> I

00:05:39.149 --> 00:05:39.159 
rubber gaskets are hard as a rock and I

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:43.259 
rubber gaskets are hard as a rock and I
have<00:05:39.429> gaps<00:05:39.819> in<00:05:40.179> there<00:05:40.419> as<00:05:41.259> much<00:05:41.289> as<00:05:41.919> a<00:05:42.119> half<00:05:43.119> an

have gaps in there as much as a half an
inch<00:05:43.360> or<00:05:43.599> 3/4<00:05:44.110> of<00:05:44.139> an<00:05:44.259> inch<00:05:44.349> thick<00:05:44.499> all<00:05:45.159> busted

00:05:45.719 --> 00:05:45.729

when<00:06:11.050> I<00:06:11.110> did<00:06:11.349> my<00:06:11.469> test<00:06:11.739> drive<00:06:11.979> that<00:06:12.669> handle<00:06:13.239> is

00:06:13.379 --> 00:06:13.389 
when I did my test drive that handle is

00:06:13.389 --> 00:06:16.290 
when I did my test drive that handle is
off<00:06:13.569> of<00:06:14.009> or<00:06:15.009> this<00:06:15.309> transmissions<00:06:15.969> out<00:06:16.119> of<00:06:16.239> a

00:06:19.829 --> 00:06:19.839 
here the handle actually hits the seat

00:06:19.839 --> 00:06:21.629
