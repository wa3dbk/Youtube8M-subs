a<00:02:05.729> couple<00:02:06.090> of<00:02:06.180> North<00:02:06.360> Korean<00:02:06.750> diplomats<00:02:07.229> can

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
a couple of North Korean diplomats can

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.190 
a couple of North Korean diplomats can
walk<00:02:07.680> into<00:02:07.920> a<00:02:08.039> an<00:02:08.819> independent<00:02:09.509> shop<00:02:09.690> owned<00:02:10.020> in

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
walk into a an independent shop owned in

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.479 
walk into a an independent shop owned in
england<00:02:10.530> and<00:02:10.649> tell<00:02:10.830> the<00:02:10.950> guy<00:02:11.069> to<00:02:11.129> take<00:02:11.340> the

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489

picture now

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.170 
picture now
so<00:02:12.630> I<00:02:12.900> think<00:02:13.020> that<00:02:13.380> that<00:02:14.370> I<00:02:14.550> came<00:02:14.910> up<00:02:15.000> with<00:02:15.120> a

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
so I think that that I came up with a

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:16.640 
so I think that that I came up with a
reason<00:02:15.510> why<00:02:15.630> they<00:02:15.840> did<00:02:16.020> that<00:02:16.050> because<00:02:16.410> that

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
reason why they did that because that

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.920 
reason why they did that because that
seems<00:02:16.860> so<00:02:17.010> mental<00:02:17.489> like<00:02:17.640> who<00:02:18.209> are<00:02:18.330> you<00:02:18.510> to<00:02:18.690> tell

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
seems so mental like who are you to tell

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.839 
seems so mental like who are you to tell
them<00:02:19.020> to<00:02:19.200> take<00:02:19.380> the<00:02:19.500> picture<00:02:19.830> down<00:02:20.010> right<00:02:20.280> but

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849 
them to take the picture down right but

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:22.220 
them to take the picture down right but
we<00:02:20.940> just<00:02:21.180> recently<00:02:21.390> did<00:02:21.630> a<00:02:21.750> story<00:02:21.959> about<00:02:22.080> how

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
we just recently did a story about how

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.170 
we just recently did a story about how
thoroughly<00:02:22.950> North<00:02:23.430> Korea<00:02:23.670> brainwashes

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180

to<00:02:26.340> those<00:02:26.459> North<00:02:26.760> Korean<00:02:27.030> officials<00:02:27.530> but

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
to those North Korean officials but

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.170 
to those North Korean officials but
really<00:02:28.920> believe<00:02:29.160> that<00:02:29.190> kim<00:02:29.489> jeong-hoon

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
really believe that kim jeong-hoon
