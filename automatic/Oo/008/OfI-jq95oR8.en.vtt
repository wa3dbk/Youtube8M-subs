guess<00:00:41.820> you<00:00:41.940> could<00:00:42.030> call<00:00:42.149> it<00:00:42.620> didn't<00:00:43.620> work

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
guess you could call it didn't work

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.040 
guess you could call it didn't work
didn't<00:00:44.250> you<00:00:44.520> can't<00:00:44.760> print<00:00:45.629> to<00:00:45.750> that<00:00:45.899> many

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
didn't you can't print to that many

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.569 
didn't you can't print to that many
printers<00:00:46.379> because<00:00:46.649> it<00:00:46.739> doesn't<00:00:47.190> support<00:00:47.309> it

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
printers because it doesn't support it

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.580 
printers because it doesn't support it
yet<00:00:47.760> you<00:00:48.239> can<00:00:48.300> only<00:00:48.510> print<00:00:48.719> to<00:00:48.899> certain<00:00:49.200> HP

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
yet you can only print to certain HP

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.470 
yet you can only print to certain HP
printers<00:00:50.010> and<00:00:50.760> I<00:00:50.879> think<00:00:51.120> there's<00:00:51.300> some<00:00:51.420> other

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
printers and I think there's some other

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:52.700 
printers and I think there's some other
it<00:00:51.629> maybe<00:00:51.809> there's<00:00:51.930> like<00:00:52.050> to<00:00:52.170> other<00:00:52.350> brands

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
it maybe there's like to other brands

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.830 
it maybe there's like to other brands
that<00:00:52.860> it<00:00:52.920> will<00:00:53.010> print<00:00:53.190> to<00:00:53.370> but<00:00:54.300> most<00:00:54.510> printers

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
that it will print to but most printers

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.779 
that it will print to but most printers
it<00:00:55.050> will<00:00:55.140> not<00:00:55.260> print<00:00:55.469> to<00:00:55.710> even<00:00:56.340> if<00:00:56.460> you<00:00:56.610> are

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
it will not print to even if you are

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.580 
it will not print to even if you are
running<00:00:56.969> it<00:00:57.329> on<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.600> airport<00:00:57.960> Express<00:00:58.320> which

running it on the airport Express which
I've<00:00:58.739> tried<00:00:59.010> it<00:00:59.370> still<00:00:59.609> doesn't<00:00:59.850> recognize<00:01:00.300> it

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
I've tried it still doesn't recognize it

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.740 
I've tried it still doesn't recognize it

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:28.579 
iPhone 4 is now on my Mac and it opened

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:31.420 
iPhone 4 is now on my Mac and it opened
up<00:02:28.640> in<00:02:28.819> preview<00:02:29.269> and<00:02:30.260> this<00:02:30.650> is<00:02:30.829> the<00:02:30.950> same<00:02:31.129> photo

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
up in preview and this is the same photo

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.449 
up in preview and this is the same photo
the<00:02:32.209> same<00:02:32.420> resolution<00:02:32.720> it<00:02:33.260> only<00:02:34.159> took

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:34.459 
the same resolution it only took

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:39.069 
the same resolution it only took
probably<00:02:34.970> three<00:02:35.420> four<00:02:35.629> seconds<00:02:36.700> so<00:02:38.079> that's

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:39.079 
probably three four seconds so that's

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:40.720 
probably three four seconds so that's
one<00:02:39.319> that's<00:02:39.620> one<00:02:39.860> thing<00:02:40.129> you<00:02:40.250> can<00:02:40.310> do<00:02:40.579> with

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
one that's one thing you can do with

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.229 
one that's one thing you can do with
this<00:02:40.879> print<00:02:41.120> topi<00:02:41.420> application<00:02:41.989> is<00:02:43.239> file

this print topi application is file

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:50.740 
this print topi application is file
transferring<00:02:44.870> like<00:02:45.440> photos<00:02:46.299> and<00:02:49.629> so<00:02:50.629> that's

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
transferring like photos and so that's

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.890 
transferring like photos and so that's
pretty<00:02:50.930> cool<00:02:51.700> that's<00:02:52.700> one<00:02:53.000> useful<00:02:53.209> thing<00:02:53.420> and

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
pretty cool that's one useful thing and

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.690 
pretty cool that's one useful thing and
there's<00:02:54.290> many<00:02:54.500> others<00:02:54.799> and<00:02:55.129> printing<00:02:55.640> a

there's many others and printing a

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.970 
there's many others and printing a
document<00:02:55.730> is<00:02:56.299> just<00:02:56.329> as<00:02:56.629> easy<00:02:56.659> so<00:02:57.620> here<00:02:57.859> is<00:02:57.950> a

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
document is just as easy so here is a

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.510 
took a couple steps to get it printing

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:51.369 
took a couple steps to get it printing
and<00:03:48.370> took<00:03:49.370> about<00:03:49.489> three<00:03:49.730> seconds<00:03:50.150> for<00:03:50.389> from
