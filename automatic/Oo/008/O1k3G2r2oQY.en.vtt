that bracket from the top of the door
the<00:01:30.329> ball<00:01:30.570> bearings<00:01:31.229> me<00:01:31.469> everywhere<00:01:32.009> I'm

00:01:32.919 --> 00:01:32.929 
the ball bearings me everywhere I'm

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:36.230 
the ball bearings me everywhere I'm
really<00:01:33.929> confident<00:01:34.439> of<00:01:34.619> that<00:01:34.670> but<00:01:35.670> this<00:01:35.759> Wilson

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
really confident of that but this Wilson

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.300 
really confident of that but this Wilson
don't<00:01:36.509> work<00:01:36.600> anymore<00:01:36.869> so<00:01:37.560> I<00:01:37.799> took<00:01:37.950> it<00:01:38.130> up<00:01:38.250> to

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
don't work anymore so I took it up to

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.120 
don't work anymore so I took it up to
the<00:01:38.460> hardware<00:01:38.909> and<00:01:39.210> I<00:01:40.170> bought<00:01:40.679> this<00:01:40.920> little

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
the hardware and I bought this little

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.199 
the hardware and I bought this little
new<00:01:41.899> bracket<00:01:42.899> with<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.110> Weiland<00:01:44.030> which<00:01:45.030> was

00:01:45.199 --> 00:01:45.209 
new bracket with the Weiland which was

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:47.090 
new bracket with the Weiland which was
very<00:01:45.659> much<00:01:45.929> the<00:01:46.140> same<00:01:46.319> size<00:01:46.590> of<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:46.979> existing

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
very much the same size of the existing

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.569 
very much the same size of the existing
wheel<00:01:47.640> now<00:01:48.390> what<00:01:48.630> I'll<00:01:48.719> probably<00:01:48.929> have<00:01:49.200> to<00:01:49.350> do

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:49.579 
wheel now what I'll probably have to do

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:52.850 
wheel now what I'll probably have to do
is<00:01:50.579> I<00:01:51.179> have<00:01:51.689> to<00:01:51.780> take<00:01:51.929> probably<00:01:52.229> take<00:01:52.469> the<00:01:52.590> bolt

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
is I have to take probably take the bolt

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.459 
is I have to take probably take the bolt
from<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.399> back<00:01:53.549> of<00:01:53.700> this<00:01:53.789> bracket<00:01:54.390> up<00:01:54.630> and<00:01:55.110> put

00:01:55.459 --> 00:01:55.469 
from the back of this bracket up and put

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:57.859 
from the back of this bracket up and put
it<00:01:55.530> on<00:01:55.649> on<00:01:56.219> this<00:01:56.429> old<00:01:56.640> bracket<00:01:57.179> because<00:01:57.600> the

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
it on on this old bracket because the

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.319 
it on on this old bracket because the
new<00:01:58.020> bracket<00:01:58.259> in<00:01:59.099> the<00:01:59.549> L<00:01:59.700> bracket<00:02:00.119> are

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
new bracket in the L bracket are

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.569 
new bracket in the L bracket are
different<00:02:00.810> sizes<00:02:01.170> so<00:02:01.890> we'll<00:02:02.130> do<00:02:02.220> that<00:02:02.280> and

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
different sizes so we'll do that and

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:09.560 
different sizes so we'll do that and
we'll<00:02:02.849> see<00:02:03.479> how<00:02:03.599> that<00:02:03.659> goes

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:09.570 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:12.810 

okay<00:02:10.570> so<00:02:10.630> put<00:02:11.020> the<00:02:11.200> new<00:02:11.380> wheel<00:02:11.620> on<00:02:11.950> the<00:02:12.490> whole

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:12.820 
okay so put the new wheel on the whole

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:15.900 
okay so put the new wheel on the whole
packet<00:02:13.360> and<00:02:13.900> that<00:02:14.830> this<00:02:15.100> whole<00:02:15.310> bracket<00:02:15.550> gets

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
packet and that this whole bracket gets

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.120 
packet and that this whole bracket gets
bolted<00:02:16.360> now<00:02:16.750> to<00:02:16.810> screw<00:02:17.440> it<00:02:17.500> down<00:02:17.650> to<00:02:17.830> the<00:02:17.950> top

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
bolted now to screw it down to the top

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.970 
bolted now to screw it down to the top
of<00:02:18.280> the<00:02:18.460> the<00:02:18.880> door<00:02:19.060> and<00:02:19.740> there's<00:02:20.740> a<00:02:20.830> little

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980

was<00:02:55.480> that<00:02:56.480> this<00:02:56.959> bracket<00:02:57.379> needs<00:02:57.560> to<00:02:57.829> be<00:02:58.209> in

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
was that this bracket needs to be in

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:02.319 
was that this bracket needs to be in
exactly<00:02:59.689> the<00:02:59.900> right<00:03:00.049> position<00:03:00.319> if<00:03:01.099> it's<00:03:01.459> a<00:03:01.670> too

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:02.329 
exactly the right position if it's a too

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:06.819 
exactly the right position if it's a too
far<00:03:03.730> one<00:03:04.730> way<00:03:04.760> that<00:03:05.239> way<00:03:05.480> then<00:03:06.470> your<00:03:06.650> doors

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:06.829 
far one way that way then your doors

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:08.500 
far one way that way then your doors
going<00:03:07.129> to<00:03:07.190> scrape<00:03:07.430> on<00:03:07.670> your<00:03:07.819> frames<00:03:08.090> that<00:03:08.329> goes

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
going to scrape on your frames that goes

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.289 
going to scrape on your frames that goes
through<00:03:08.840> it<00:03:09.079> was<00:03:09.560> too<00:03:09.769> far<00:03:10.010> this<00:03:10.220> way<00:03:10.459> in<00:03:11.150> order

00:03:11.289 --> 00:03:11.299 
through it was too far this way in order

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:16.119 
through it was too far this way in order
to<00:03:11.930> show<00:03:12.140> properly<00:03:12.739> here<00:03:14.829> I'm<00:03:15.829> simply

00:03:16.119 --> 00:03:16.129 
to show properly here I'm simply

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:18.099 
to show properly here I'm simply
particular<00:03:16.640> position<00:03:17.030> and<00:03:17.480> then<00:03:17.780> you<00:03:17.870> have<00:03:17.989> to

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:18.109 
particular position and then you have to

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:20.949 
particular position and then you have to
make<00:03:18.290> that<00:03:18.440> roll<00:03:19.450> with<00:03:20.450> this<00:03:20.540> little<00:03:20.780> bracket

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 
make that roll with this little bracket

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:23.440 
make that roll with this little bracket
helps<00:03:21.349> put<00:03:21.950> a<00:03:22.159> little<00:03:22.489> outside<00:03:22.879> bracket<00:03:23.269> holes

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
helps put a little outside bracket holes

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:25.330 
helps put a little outside bracket holes
but<00:03:24.260> this<00:03:24.379> role<00:03:24.560> has<00:03:24.739> to<00:03:24.859> be<00:03:24.950> as<00:03:25.010> hard<00:03:25.159> as

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
but this role has to be as hard as

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.190 
but this role has to be as hard as
possible<00:03:25.760> so<00:03:26.299> the<00:03:26.540> bottom<00:03:26.870> of<00:03:26.930> the<00:03:26.989> door

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.200 
possible so the bottom of the door

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.920 
possible so the bottom of the door
doesn't<00:03:27.590> scrape<00:03:27.889> on<00:03:28.069> the<00:03:28.159> carpet<00:03:28.540> so<00:03:29.540> there<00:03:29.840> we

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
doesn't scrape on the carpet so there we

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:31.119 
doesn't scrape on the carpet so there we
have<00:03:30.079> it<00:03:30.170> all<00:03:30.319> I<00:03:30.349> got<00:03:30.500> to<00:03:30.590> do<00:03:30.650> is<00:03:30.709> put<00:03:30.859> the<00:03:30.950> trim

00:03:31.119 --> 00:03:31.129 
have it all I got to do is put the trim

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:33.910 
have it all I got to do is put the trim
back<00:03:31.250> on<00:03:31.430> and<00:03:32.049> then<00:03:33.049> it's<00:03:33.230> finished<00:03:33.440> there<00:03:33.829> we

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
back on and then it's finished there we

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:34.240 
back on and then it's finished there we
go

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
go

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:37.720 
go
