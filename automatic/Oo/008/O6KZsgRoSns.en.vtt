itself they've also given filters from
other<00:01:46.649> apps<00:01:46.920> so<00:01:47.189> now<00:01:47.340> apps<00:01:47.579> can<00:01:47.820> interact<00:01:48.210> with

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
other apps so now apps can interact with

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.020 
other apps so now apps can interact with
these<00:01:48.750> apps<00:01:49.020> which<00:01:49.320> is<00:01:49.350> a<00:01:49.470> great<00:01:49.920> addition<00:01:50.220> and

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
these apps which is a great addition and

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.819

we also have the option to create
time-lapse<00:01:53.820> photos<00:01:54.149> so<00:01:54.960> a<00:01:54.990> time-lapse<00:01:55.590> photo

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
time-lapse photos so a time-lapse photo

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.700 
time-lapse photos so a time-lapse photo
is<00:01:56.369> a<00:01:56.759> photo<00:01:57.090> that<00:01:57.420> allows<00:01:57.719> you<00:01:57.990> to<00:01:58.259> take
