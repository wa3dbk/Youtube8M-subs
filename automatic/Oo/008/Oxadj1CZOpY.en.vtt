and<00:00:00.750> it's<00:00:00.930> the<00:00:01.020> same<00:00:01.199> way<00:00:01.350> with<00:00:01.500> dogs<00:00:01.800> for

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:02.040 
and it's the same way with dogs for

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.770 
and it's the same way with dogs for
example<00:00:02.399> the<00:00:02.490> way<00:00:03.090> we<00:00:03.210> have<00:00:03.240> the<00:00:03.419> different

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:03.780 
example the way we have the different

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.130 
example the way we have the different
breeds<00:00:04.049> of<00:00:04.200> dogs<00:00:04.410> are<00:00:04.740> just<00:00:05.040> various<00:00:05.490> traits

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:06.140 
breeds of dogs are just various traits

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:07.760 
breeds of dogs are just various traits
surfacing<00:00:07.140> because<00:00:07.379> you<00:00:07.470> have<00:00:07.589> different

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
surfacing because you have different

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.589 
surfacing because you have different
combinations<00:00:08.580> of<00:00:08.760> genes<00:00:08.820> and<00:00:09.389> so<00:00:09.450> there's

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
combinations of genes and so there's

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:11.209 
combinations of genes and so there's
quite<00:00:09.780> a<00:00:09.870> lot<00:00:10.050> of<00:00:10.200> variation<00:00:10.710> within<00:00:10.889> the<00:00:11.070> dog

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
quite a lot of variation within the dog

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.310 
quite a lot of variation within the dog
kind<00:00:11.519> now<00:00:11.670> they're<00:00:11.790> all<00:00:11.820> just<00:00:12.059> dogs<00:00:12.330> but<00:00:12.599> we

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
kind now they're all just dogs but we

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.049 
kind now they're all just dogs but we
would<00:00:13.440> expect<00:00:13.769> that<00:00:13.889> variation<00:00:14.519> based<00:00:14.670> on<00:00:14.880> how

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
would expect that variation based on how

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:16.970 
would expect that variation based on how
DNA<00:00:15.570> works<00:00:15.780> and<00:00:16.410> based<00:00:16.529> on<00:00:16.650> the<00:00:16.710> different

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
DNA works and based on the different

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.340 
DNA works and based on the different
combinations<00:00:17.580> of<00:00:17.580> DNA<00:00:18.390> and<00:00:18.600> so<00:00:19.020> this<00:00:19.140> is<00:00:19.230> how

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
combinations of DNA and so this is how

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:20.810 
combinations of DNA and so this is how
you<00:00:19.410> get<00:00:19.529> all<00:00:19.680> these<00:00:19.830> different<00:00:20.070> breeds<00:00:20.550> a<00:00:20.670> dog

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
you get all these different breeds a dog

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.130 
you get all these different breeds a dog
and<00:00:21.060> is<00:00:21.150> same<00:00:21.300> way<00:00:21.390> with<00:00:21.480> elephants<00:00:21.960> the<00:00:22.050> way

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
and is same way with elephants the way

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.599 
and is same way with elephants the way
you<00:00:22.199> get<00:00:22.350> the<00:00:22.410> different<00:00:22.710> breeds<00:00:23.189> of<00:00:23.279> elephant

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
you get the different breeds of elephant

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.160 
you get the different breeds of elephant
including<00:00:23.939> kinds<00:00:24.330> that<00:00:24.449> have<00:00:24.539> gone<00:00:24.689> extinct

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
including kinds that have gone extinct

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.820 
including kinds that have gone extinct
like<00:00:25.320> the<00:00:25.470> like<00:00:25.890> the<00:00:25.920> mammoth<00:00:27.680> but<00:00:28.680> here's

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
like the like the mammoth but here's

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.140 
like the like the mammoth but here's
here's<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:29.429> point<00:00:29.609> that<00:00:29.820> I<00:00:29.910> need<00:00:30.029> you<00:00:30.119> to

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
here's the point that I need you to

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.630 
here's the point that I need you to
understand<00:00:30.630> you<00:00:31.410> see<00:00:31.619> an<00:00:31.740> organism<00:00:32.250> like<00:00:32.430> an

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
understand you see an organism like an

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.970 
understand you see an organism like an
amoeba<00:00:32.850> or<00:00:33.239> a<00:00:33.660> bacterium<00:00:34.620> something<00:00:34.890> like

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
amoeba or a bacterium something like

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.490 
amoeba or a bacterium something like
that<00:00:35.130> that<00:00:35.160> has<00:00:35.370> that<00:00:35.610> is<00:00:36.329> simpler<00:00:37.230> than<00:00:37.350> we

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
that that has that is simpler than we

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.110 
that that has that is simpler than we
are<00:00:37.530> and<00:00:37.710> by<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:37.890> way<00:00:38.040> it's<00:00:38.430> not<00:00:38.610> simple<00:00:39.000> a

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
are and by the way it's not simple a

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.610 
are and by the way it's not simple a
bacterium<00:00:39.600> is<00:00:39.719> not<00:00:39.840> simple<00:00:40.200> if<00:00:40.350> you<00:00:40.440> think

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
bacterium is not simple if you think

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.590 
bacterium is not simple if you think
it's<00:00:40.739> simple<00:00:41.010> lets<00:00:41.160> you<00:00:41.340> build<00:00:41.489> one<00:00:41.760> they're

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
it's simple lets you build one they're

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.270 
it's simple lets you build one they're
quite<00:00:42.809> complicated<00:00:43.170> but<00:00:43.829> they're<00:00:43.980> simpler

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
quite complicated but they're simpler

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.440 
quite complicated but they're simpler
than<00:00:44.399> you<00:00:44.550> are<00:00:44.700> they<00:00:44.969> have<00:00:45.149> fewer

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
than you are they have fewer

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.510 
than you are they have fewer
instructions<00:00:46.110> in<00:00:46.260> them<00:00:46.440> because<00:00:47.070> they're<00:00:47.430> not

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
instructions in them because they're not

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.950 
instructions in them because they're not
required<00:00:47.730> to<00:00:48.030> make<00:00:48.210> things<00:00:48.390> like<00:00:48.600> eyeballs

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
required to make things like eyeballs

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.510 
required to make things like eyeballs
and<00:00:49.200> hands<00:00:49.440> and<00:00:49.620> you<00:00:49.680> have<00:00:49.860> those<00:00:50.070> things<00:00:50.370> in

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
and hands and you have those things in

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.670 
and hands and you have those things in
your<00:00:50.610> DNA<00:00:50.789> so<00:00:51.750> if<00:00:51.870> you<00:00:51.960> think<00:00:52.140> about<00:00:52.230> it<00:00:52.379> a

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
your DNA so if you think about it a

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.049 
your DNA so if you think about it a
horse<00:00:53.160> was<00:00:53.370> going<00:00:53.520> to<00:00:53.579> have<00:00:53.730> greater

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
horse was going to have greater

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.819 
horse was going to have greater
instructions<00:00:54.780> more<00:00:54.989> instructions<00:00:55.590> in<00:00:55.710> its

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
instructions more instructions in its

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.670 
instructions more instructions in its
DNA<00:00:56.010> than<00:00:57.000> an<00:00:57.360> amoeba<00:00:57.690> would<00:00:57.899> a<00:00:58.079> single-celled

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
DNA than an amoeba would a single-celled

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.189 
DNA than an amoeba would a single-celled
organism<00:00:59.129> would<00:00:59.250> if<00:00:59.460> evolution<00:01:00.449> is<00:01:00.690> true<00:01:00.750> if

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
organism would if evolution is true if

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.410 
organism would if evolution is true if
we're<00:01:01.379> descended<00:01:01.890> from<00:01:01.980> bacteria<00:01:02.550> that<00:01:03.120> means

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
we're descended from bacteria that means

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.370 
we're descended from bacteria that means
that<00:01:03.600> information<00:01:04.199> has<00:01:04.890> to<00:01:05.280> increase<00:01:06.170> you<00:01:07.170> see

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
that information has to increase you see

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.200 
that information has to increase you see
if<00:01:07.619> we're<00:01:08.159> descended<00:01:08.520> from<00:01:08.580> bacterium<00:01:09.119> and

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
if we're descended from bacterium and

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.640 
if we're descended from bacterium and
they<00:01:09.390> and<00:01:09.630> we<00:01:09.750> have<00:01:09.869> a<00:01:09.900> lot<00:01:10.049> more<00:01:10.140> information

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
they and we have a lot more information

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.320 
they and we have a lot more information
at<00:01:10.770> some<00:01:11.040> point<00:01:11.310> that<00:01:11.520> information<00:01:12.000> had<00:01:12.150> to

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
at some point that information had to

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.450 
at some point that information had to
increase<00:01:12.659> evolution<00:01:13.500> I'll<00:01:14.130> say<00:01:14.280> it<00:01:14.340> one<00:01:14.430> more

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
increase evolution I'll say it one more

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.980 
increase evolution I'll say it one more
time<00:01:14.580> because<00:01:14.939> it's<00:01:15.030> so<00:01:15.119> important<00:01:15.540> evolution

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
time because it's so important evolution

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.380 
time because it's so important evolution
is<00:01:16.049> about<00:01:16.290> an<00:01:16.409> increase<00:01:16.890> in<00:01:17.130> information<00:01:17.909> in

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
is about an increase in information in

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.480 
is about an increase in information in
your<00:01:18.570> DNA<00:01:18.720> now<00:01:19.680> that's<00:01:19.830> very<00:01:20.009> important<00:01:20.430> to

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
your DNA now that's very important to

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.130 
your DNA now that's very important to
understand<00:01:20.939> because<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.390> processes<00:01:21.930> that<00:01:22.020> we

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
understand because the processes that we

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.249 
understand because the processes that we
observe<00:01:22.409> in<00:01:22.560> nature<00:01:22.590> tend<00:01:23.250> to<00:01:23.369> decrease<00:01:23.610> the

00:01:24.249 --> 00:01:24.259 
observe in nature tend to decrease the

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:26.690 
observe in nature tend to decrease the
information<00:01:25.259> in<00:01:25.320> your<00:01:25.350> DNA<00:01:25.560> even<00:01:26.369> once<00:01:26.520> that

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
information in your DNA even once that

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.190 
information in your DNA even once that
evolution<00:01:27.090> is<00:01:27.150> like<00:01:27.360> to<00:01:27.509> say<00:01:27.659> our<00:01:27.750> evolution

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
evolution is like to say our evolution

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.170 
evolution is like to say our evolution
they're<00:01:28.380> really<00:01:28.710> in<00:01:28.890> a<00:01:29.400> way<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:29.700> opposite<00:01:30.119> of

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
they're really in a way the opposite of

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.090 
they're really in a way the opposite of
evolution<00:01:30.659> let<00:01:31.229> me<00:01:31.290> give<00:01:31.409> you<00:01:31.470> one<00:01:31.500> example<00:01:31.650> of

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
evolution let me give you one example of

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.319 
evolution let me give you one example of
that<00:01:32.130> let's<00:01:32.460> talk<00:01:32.579> about<00:01:32.729> natural<00:01:33.299> selection

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
that let's talk about natural selection

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.960 
that let's talk about natural selection
a<00:01:34.049> lot<00:01:34.650> of<00:01:34.680> people<00:01:34.770> use<00:01:35.070> natural<00:01:35.280> selection<00:01:35.880> as

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
a lot of people use natural selection as

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.700 
a lot of people use natural selection as
an<00:01:36.060> example<00:01:36.329> of<00:01:36.509> evolution<00:01:36.990> but<00:01:37.110> really<00:01:37.500> in<00:01:37.650> a

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
an example of evolution but really in a

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.590 
an example of evolution but really in a
way<00:01:37.890> it's<00:01:38.189> the<00:01:38.369> opposite<00:01:38.850> of<00:01:38.939> evolution<00:01:39.420> let

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
way it's the opposite of evolution let

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.420 
way it's the opposite of evolution let
me<00:01:39.659> show<00:01:39.780> you<00:01:39.869> why<00:01:40.020> that<00:01:40.200> why<00:01:40.439> that<00:01:40.590> works<00:01:40.799> so

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
me show you why that why that works so

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.010 
me show you why that why that works so
suppose<00:01:41.670> you<00:01:41.700> had<00:01:41.909> two<00:01:42.060> dogs<00:01:42.270> here<00:01:42.750> and<00:01:42.930> they

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
suppose you had two dogs here and they

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.499 
suppose you had two dogs here and they
have<00:01:43.200> a<00:01:43.229> gene<00:01:43.649> for<00:01:43.920> long<00:01:44.640> fur<00:01:44.939> and<00:01:45.119> a<00:01:45.149> gene<00:01:45.329> for

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
have a gene for long fur and a gene for

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:46.969 
have a gene for long fur and a gene for
short<00:01:45.750> fur<00:01:45.930> and<00:01:46.079> suppose<00:01:46.350> those<00:01:46.530> genes<00:01:46.799> have<00:01:46.950> a

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
short fur and suppose those genes have a

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.649 
short fur and suppose those genes have a
combined<00:01:47.399> effect<00:01:47.700> which<00:01:47.850> some<00:01:48.060> genes<00:01:48.270> do<00:01:48.450> and

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
combined effect which some genes do and

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.450 
combined effect which some genes do and
that<00:01:49.290> would<00:01:49.409> make<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.680> dogs<00:01:49.860> have<00:01:50.070> medium

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
that would make the dogs have medium

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.370 
that would make the dogs have medium
length<00:01:50.640> fur<00:01:51.060> gene<00:01:51.509> for<00:01:51.689> long<00:01:51.810> gene<00:01:51.990> for<00:01:52.170> shorts

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
length fur gene for long gene for shorts

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.660 
length fur gene for long gene for shorts
they<00:01:52.500> have<00:01:52.590> medium<00:01:52.799> length<00:01:52.920> fur<00:01:53.220> now<00:01:53.430> this<00:01:53.549> is

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
they have medium length fur now this is

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.039 
they have medium length fur now this is
of<00:01:53.759> course<00:01:53.790> is<00:01:54.090> all<00:01:54.240> simplified<00:01:54.780> but<00:01:54.930> the

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
of course is all simplified but the

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.630 
of course is all simplified but the
basic<00:01:55.380> genetic<00:01:55.710> principles<00:01:56.130> here<00:01:56.280> are<00:01:56.399> true

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
basic genetic principles here are true

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.700 
basic genetic principles here are true
and<00:01:56.880> so<00:01:57.509> you<00:01:57.600> start<00:01:57.840> with<00:01:57.930> these<00:01:58.020> two<00:01:58.200> dogs<00:01:58.380> and

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
and so you start with these two dogs and

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.649 
and so you start with these two dogs and
they<00:01:59.219> have<00:01:59.399> pups<00:01:59.670> well<00:01:59.909> some<00:02:00.119> pups<00:02:00.329> are<00:02:00.509> going

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
they have pups well some pups are going

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.719 
they have pups well some pups are going
to<00:02:00.719> get<00:02:00.869> the<00:02:01.049> short<00:02:01.290> jean<00:02:01.530> from<00:02:01.920> dad<00:02:02.369> and<00:02:02.670> the

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
to get the short jean from dad and the

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.069 
to get the short jean from dad and the
short<00:02:02.939> jean<00:02:03.180> from<00:02:03.450> mom<00:02:03.630> and<00:02:03.659> they're<00:02:03.899> going<00:02:03.990> to

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
short jean from mom and they're going to

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.139 
short jean from mom and they're going to
end<00:02:04.170> up<00:02:04.200> with<00:02:04.259> short<00:02:04.770> fur<00:02:05.189> some<00:02:05.790> dogs<00:02:06.000> are

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
end up with short fur some dogs are

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.789 
end up with short fur some dogs are
going<00:02:06.299> to<00:02:06.360> get<00:02:06.509> the<00:02:06.659> long<00:02:06.869> gene<00:02:07.140> from<00:02:07.380> dad<00:02:07.590> the

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
going to get the long gene from dad the

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.020 
going to get the long gene from dad the
short<00:02:08.009> jean<00:02:08.250> for<00:02:08.429> Mom<00:02:08.580> they're<00:02:08.759> going<00:02:08.879> to<00:02:08.940> end

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
short jean for Mom they're going to end

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.339 
short jean for Mom they're going to end
up<00:02:09.090> with<00:02:09.149> medium<00:02:09.509> length<00:02:09.660> for<00:02:09.929> the<00:02:10.050> same<00:02:10.229> as

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
up with medium length for the same as

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.229 
up with medium length for the same as
their<00:02:10.470> parents<00:02:10.860> and<00:02:10.979> some<00:02:11.670> dogs<00:02:11.790> will<00:02:12.090> get

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
their parents and some dogs will get

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.580 
their parents and some dogs will get
long<00:02:12.569> gene<00:02:12.780> from<00:02:12.930> dad<00:02:13.110> and<00:02:13.140> long

mom<00:02:13.980> don't<00:02:14.129> end<00:02:14.280> up<00:02:14.400> with<00:02:14.610> long<00:02:14.940> fur<00:02:15.360> now

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
mom don't end up with long fur now

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.570 
mom don't end up with long fur now
suppose<00:02:16.530> that<00:02:16.650> there's<00:02:16.800> an<00:02:16.890> ice<00:02:17.010> age<00:02:17.250> and

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
suppose that there's an ice age and

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.640 
suppose that there's an ice age and
suppose<00:02:18.150> that<00:02:18.180> ice<00:02:18.450> age<00:02:18.660> wipes<00:02:18.959> out<00:02:19.200> the<00:02:19.440> dogs

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
suppose that ice age wipes out the dogs

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:20.930 
suppose that ice age wipes out the dogs
with<00:02:19.890> the<00:02:19.980> short<00:02:20.190> fur<00:02:20.370> and<00:02:20.519> the<00:02:20.580> medium<00:02:20.790> length

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
with the short fur and the medium length

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.520 
with the short fur and the medium length
fur<00:02:21.180> why<00:02:21.420> because<00:02:21.959> they're<00:02:22.140> not<00:02:22.230> as<00:02:22.379> well

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
fur why because they're not as well

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.650 
fur why because they're not as well
insulated<00:02:23.069> against<00:02:23.489> the<00:02:23.580> cold<00:02:23.790> and<00:02:24.060> so<00:02:24.540> the

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
insulated against the cold and so the

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.210 
insulated against the cold and so the
dogs<00:02:24.840> that<00:02:24.989> are<00:02:25.110> better<00:02:25.260> able<00:02:25.319> to<00:02:25.560> survive<00:02:25.860> in

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
dogs that are better able to survive in

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.220 
dogs that are better able to survive in
that<00:02:26.370> cold<00:02:26.670> environment<00:02:27.330> are<00:02:27.480> the<00:02:27.900> dogs<00:02:28.050> that

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
that cold environment are the dogs that

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.140 
that cold environment are the dogs that
have<00:02:28.349> the<00:02:28.440> long<00:02:28.620> fur<00:02:28.860> they<00:02:29.610> go<00:02:29.760> on<00:02:29.940> and

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
have the long fur they go on and

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.089 
have the long fur they go on and
reproduce<00:02:30.629> and<00:02:30.989> pretty<00:02:31.319> soon<00:02:31.530> all<00:02:31.739> the<00:02:31.890> dogs

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099 
reproduce and pretty soon all the dogs

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:34.280 
reproduce and pretty soon all the dogs
have<00:02:32.430> long<00:02:32.730> fur<00:02:33.060> these<00:02:33.330> dogs<00:02:33.660> can't<00:02:33.989> reproduce

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
have long fur these dogs can't reproduce

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:35.930 
have long fur these dogs can't reproduce
because<00:02:34.560> they're<00:02:34.920> dead<00:02:35.099> natural<00:02:35.849> selection

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
because they're dead natural selection

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.670 
because they're dead natural selection
killed<00:02:36.420> them<00:02:36.540> off<00:02:36.660> now<00:02:37.110> this<00:02:37.260> is<00:02:37.379> a<00:02:37.410> great

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
killed them off now this is a great

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.860 
killed them off now this is a great
example<00:02:38.010> of<00:02:38.400> natural<00:02:39.330> selection<00:02:39.420> because

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
example of natural selection because

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.229 
example of natural selection because
these<00:02:40.110> dogs<00:02:40.410> that<00:02:41.220> they've<00:02:41.610> adapted<00:02:41.879> their

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
these dogs that they've adapted their

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:43.339 
these dogs that they've adapted their
environment<00:02:42.629> it's<00:02:42.720> a<00:02:42.750> great<00:02:42.930> example<00:02:43.140> of

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:43.349 
environment it's a great example of

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:45.500 
environment it's a great example of
adaptation<00:02:44.190> you<00:02:44.519> can<00:02:44.640> see<00:02:44.819> why<00:02:44.849> it<00:02:45.000> is<00:02:45.209> that

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
adaptation you can see why it is that

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.870 
adaptation you can see why it is that
the<00:02:45.870> environment<00:02:46.349> got<00:02:46.440> cold<00:02:46.709> the<00:02:46.920> dogs<00:02:47.130> had

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
the environment got cold the dogs had

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.720 
the environment got cold the dogs had
long<00:02:48.060> fur<00:02:48.920> but<00:02:49.920> the<00:02:50.010> information<00:02:50.250> was<00:02:50.579> there

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
long fur but the information was there

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.400 
long fur but the information was there
from<00:02:50.819> the<00:02:50.910> beginning<00:02:51.030> these<00:02:51.569> dogs<00:02:51.900> had<00:02:52.260> the

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
from the beginning these dogs had the

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:53.870 
from the beginning these dogs had the
information<00:02:52.530> in<00:02:53.010> them<00:02:53.160> for<00:02:53.400> that<00:02:53.459> long<00:02:53.640> fur

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
information in them for that long fur

mutations<00:04:29.560> well<00:04:30.100> a<00:04:30.130> mutation<00:04:30.640> basically<00:04:31.090> is<00:04:31.240> a

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 
mutations well a mutation basically is a

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.720 
mutations well a mutation basically is a
copying<00:04:31.780> mistake<00:04:32.110> it's<00:04:32.320> a<00:04:32.440> typo<00:04:32.920> in<00:04:33.130> your<00:04:33.610> DNA

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:33.730 
copying mistake it's a typo in your DNA

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:35.580 
copying mistake it's a typo in your DNA
so<00:04:34.630> one<00:04:34.780> of<00:04:34.810> those<00:04:34.930> little<00:04:35.050> jeans<00:04:35.290> has<00:04:35.440> been

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:35.590 
so one of those little jeans has been

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:37.710 
so one of those little jeans has been
switched<00:04:35.890> and<00:04:36.190> suppose<00:04:36.910> suppose<00:04:37.330> you<00:04:37.600> have<00:04:37.690> a

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:37.720 
switched and suppose suppose you have a

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.020 
switched and suppose suppose you have a
dog<00:04:37.900> with<00:04:38.140> jeans<00:04:38.830> for<00:04:39.100> for<00:04:39.400> normal<00:04:39.700> legs<00:04:39.850> which

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.030 
dog with jeans for for normal legs which

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:41.910 
dog with jeans for for normal legs which
old<00:04:40.210> dogs<00:04:40.390> should<00:04:40.840> have<00:04:41.320> but<00:04:41.740> there's<00:04:41.860> a

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:41.920 
old dogs should have but there's a

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:44.220 
old dogs should have but there's a
mutation<00:04:42.460> a<00:04:42.520> copying<00:04:42.940> mistake<00:04:43.270> and<00:04:43.510> so<00:04:44.080> that

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:44.230 
mutation a copying mistake and so that

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:46.260 
mutation a copying mistake and so that
gene<00:04:44.440> doesn't<00:04:44.620> get<00:04:44.800> copied<00:04:44.950> properly<00:04:45.670> and<00:04:45.880> so

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:46.270 
gene doesn't get copied properly and so

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:48.090 
gene doesn't get copied properly and so
you<00:04:46.360> end<00:04:46.510> up<00:04:46.600> with<00:04:46.660> a<00:04:46.810> dog<00:04:47.260> with<00:04:47.500> short<00:04:47.800> stubby

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:48.100 
you end up with a dog with short stubby

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:50.490 
you end up with a dog with short stubby
little<00:04:48.280> legs<00:04:48.420> because<00:04:49.420> his<00:04:49.870> legs<00:04:50.110> didn't<00:04:50.350> for

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:50.500 
little legs because his legs didn't for

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:51.930 
little legs because his legs didn't for
him<00:04:50.620> quite<00:04:50.800> properly<00:04:51.160> because<00:04:51.280> he's<00:04:51.460> missing

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:51.940 
him quite properly because he's missing

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:53.580 
him quite properly because he's missing
a<00:04:52.000> little<00:04:52.210> bit<00:04:52.300> of<00:04:52.360> information<00:04:52.600> and<00:04:53.080> that's

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:53.590 
a little bit of information and that's

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:55.440 
a little bit of information and that's
that's<00:04:53.800> key<00:04:54.100> to<00:04:54.190> understand<00:04:54.670> mutations<00:04:55.270> are

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:55.450 
that's key to understand mutations are

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:59.190 
that's key to understand mutations are
really<00:04:55.690> a<00:04:55.720> loss<00:04:56.170> of<00:04:56.940> information<00:04:58.050> now<00:04:59.050> if<00:04:59.140> you

00:04:59.190 --> 00:04:59.200 
really a loss of information now if you

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:00.960 
really a loss of information now if you
think<00:04:59.380> about<00:04:59.440> it<00:04:59.590> dogs<00:04:59.950> with<00:05:00.640> lots<00:05:00.880> of

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:00.970 
think about it dogs with lots of

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:02.490 
think about it dogs with lots of
mutations<00:05:01.420> like<00:05:01.600> that<00:05:01.810> would<00:05:02.050> tend<00:05:02.290> to<00:05:02.380> be

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:02.500 
mutations like that would tend to be

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.320 
mutations like that would tend to be
eliminated<00:05:02.770> in<00:05:03.280> nature<00:05:03.670> wouldn't<00:05:03.970> they<00:05:04.030> a<00:05:04.060> dog

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:04.330 
eliminated in nature wouldn't they a dog

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:06.120 
eliminated in nature wouldn't they a dog
with<00:05:04.510> short<00:05:04.720> stubby<00:05:04.930> little<00:05:05.050> legs<00:05:05.170> is<00:05:05.620> more

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:06.130 
with short stubby little legs is more

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:07.860 
with short stubby little legs is more
likely<00:05:06.280> to<00:05:06.370> be<00:05:06.460> killed<00:05:06.970> off<00:05:07.180> because<00:05:07.540> he<00:05:07.630> can't

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:07.870 
likely to be killed off because he can't

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:09.210 
likely to be killed off because he can't
run<00:05:08.020> and<00:05:08.140> catch<00:05:08.260> anything<00:05:08.530> he's<00:05:08.860> more<00:05:09.010> like<00:05:09.130> to

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:09.220 
run and catch anything he's more like to

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:10.620 
run and catch anything he's more like to
be<00:05:09.340> more<00:05:09.760> likely<00:05:09.910> to<00:05:10.030> be<00:05:10.120> picked<00:05:10.300> off<00:05:10.390> himself

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:10.630 
be more likely to be picked off himself

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:12.870 
be more likely to be picked off himself
but<00:05:11.530> if<00:05:11.650> you<00:05:11.740> think<00:05:11.950> about<00:05:12.010> it<00:05:12.250> some<00:05:12.430> people

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:12.880 
but if you think about it some people

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:14.760 
but if you think about it some people
like<00:05:13.360> dogs<00:05:13.690> with<00:05:14.020> short<00:05:14.230> stubby<00:05:14.380> the<00:05:14.560> legs

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:14.770 
like dogs with short stubby the legs

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:15.960 
like dogs with short stubby the legs
because<00:05:14.980> they<00:05:15.070> can't<00:05:15.250> jump<00:05:15.430> up<00:05:15.520> on<00:05:15.670> as<00:05:15.790> much

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:15.970 
because they can't jump up on as much

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:18.570 
because they can't jump up on as much
and<00:05:16.270> so<00:05:16.840> people<00:05:17.080> protect<00:05:17.770> the<00:05:17.950> mutations<00:05:18.430> and

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:18.580 
and so people protect the mutations and

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:20.790 
and so people protect the mutations and
dogs<00:05:18.760> that<00:05:19.090> they<00:05:19.270> like<00:05:19.480> and<00:05:19.780> they<00:05:19.810> take<00:05:20.590> dogs

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:20.800 
dogs that they like and they take dogs

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:21.990 
dogs that they like and they take dogs
with<00:05:21.010> short<00:05:21.190> stubby<00:05:21.370> little<00:05:21.490> legs<00:05:21.610> and

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:22.000 
with short stubby little legs and

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.130 
with short stubby little legs and
encourage<00:05:22.300> them<00:05:22.330> to<00:05:22.510> breed<00:05:22.720> with<00:05:22.870> other<00:05:22.990> dogs

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:23.140 
encourage them to breed with other dogs

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:24.390 
encourage them to breed with other dogs
with<00:05:23.410> short<00:05:23.560> stubby<00:05:23.710> little<00:05:23.830> legs<00:05:23.950> end<00:05:24.220> up<00:05:24.310> at

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:24.400 
with short stubby little legs end up at

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:25.380 
with short stubby little legs end up at
lots<00:05:24.520> of<00:05:24.640> dogs<00:05:24.730> would<00:05:24.970> short<00:05:25.120> stubby<00:05:25.270> little

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:25.390 
lots of dogs would short stubby little

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:27.780 
lots of dogs would short stubby little
legs<00:05:25.510> say<00:05:26.080> that's<00:05:26.350> how<00:05:26.380> it<00:05:26.500> works<00:05:26.680> and<00:05:26.950> there

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:27.790 
legs say that's how it works and there

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:29.160 
legs say that's how it works and there
are<00:05:27.910> other<00:05:28.090> mutations<00:05:28.420> as<00:05:28.720> well<00:05:28.870> of<00:05:29.020> course

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:29.170 
are other mutations as well of course

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:30.480 
are other mutations as well of course
there's<00:05:29.350> a<00:05:29.410> mutation<00:05:29.800> that<00:05:29.860> causes<00:05:29.950> the<00:05:30.310> dog's

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:30.490 
there's a mutation that causes the dog's

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:33.390 
there's a mutation that causes the dog's
snout<00:05:30.700> not<00:05:31.060> to<00:05:31.210> grow<00:05:31.390> properly<00:05:32.020> and<00:05:32.380> so<00:05:32.530> end<00:05:33.310> up

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:33.400 
snout not to grow properly and so end up

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:34.950 
snout not to grow properly and so end up
with<00:05:33.490> a<00:05:33.550> short<00:05:33.760> stubby<00:05:33.940> little<00:05:34.090> snout<00:05:34.390> and<00:05:34.600> the

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:34.960 
with a short stubby little snout and the

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:36.300 
with a short stubby little snout and the
skin<00:05:35.230> was<00:05:35.350> designed<00:05:35.710> to<00:05:35.800> fit<00:05:35.980> the<00:05:36.010> longer

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:36.310 
skin was designed to fit the longer

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:38.010 
skin was designed to fit the longer
snout<00:05:36.520> so<00:05:36.730> the<00:05:36.820> skin<00:05:37.060> hangs<00:05:37.300> off<00:05:37.480> the<00:05:37.630> side<00:05:37.810> if

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:38.020 
snout so the skin hangs off the side if

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:39.240 
snout so the skin hangs off the side if
you<00:05:38.080> don't<00:05:38.230> clean<00:05:38.410> it<00:05:38.440> and<00:05:38.650> get<00:05:38.770> infected<00:05:39.040> and

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:39.250 
you don't clean it and get infected and

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:41.820 
you don't clean it and get infected and
some<00:05:39.910> people<00:05:40.180> like<00:05:40.330> dogs<00:05:40.840> with<00:05:41.080> that<00:05:41.230> mutation

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:41.830 
some people like dogs with that mutation

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:43.550 
some people like dogs with that mutation
and<00:05:42.070> I'm<00:05:42.340> not<00:05:42.490> one<00:05:42.730> of<00:05:42.760> them<00:05:42.970> but<00:05:43.150> in<00:05:43.300> any<00:05:43.390> case

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:43.560 
and I'm not one of them but in any case

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:45.360 
and I'm not one of them but in any case
have<00:05:44.560> you<00:05:44.590> ever<00:05:44.710> thought<00:05:44.800> about<00:05:44.860> for<00:05:45.100> the<00:05:45.190> dogs

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:45.370 
have you ever thought about for the dogs

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:46.470 
have you ever thought about for the dogs
point<00:05:45.580> of<00:05:45.730> view<00:05:45.820> you<00:05:45.910> think<00:05:46.090> he<00:05:46.150> says<00:05:46.300> gee<00:05:46.450> I

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:46.480 
point of view you think he says gee I

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:47.880 
point of view you think he says gee I
love<00:05:46.570> having<00:05:46.990> my<00:05:47.020> nose<00:05:47.140> stuff<00:05:47.560> into<00:05:47.740> my<00:05:47.860> face

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:47.890 
love having my nose stuff into my face

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:53.400 
love having my nose stuff into my face
that's<00:05:48.250> great<00:05:49.290> not<00:05:50.290> at<00:05:50.410> all<00:05:51.630> poodles<00:05:52.630> let's

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:53.410 
that's great not at all poodles let's

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:54.810 
that's great not at all poodles let's
talk<00:05:53.500> about<00:05:53.650> poodles<00:05:54.070> look<00:05:54.580> at<00:05:54.640> all<00:05:54.700> the

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:54.820 
talk about poodles look at all the

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:56.190 
talk about poodles look at all the
different<00:05:54.910> problems<00:05:55.420> that<00:05:55.600> poodles<00:05:55.900> can<00:05:56.050> have

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:56.200 
different problems that poodles can have

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:57.390 
different problems that poodles can have
because<00:05:56.470> of<00:05:56.590> mutations<00:05:57.070> that<00:05:57.130> have<00:05:57.250> been

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:57.400 
because of mutations that have been

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:59.010 
because of mutations that have been
built<00:05:57.610> up<00:05:57.760> in<00:05:57.910> their<00:05:58.030> genome<00:05:58.330> there's<00:05:58.960> a

00:05:59.010 --> 00:05:59.020 
built up in their genome there's a

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:00.870 
built up in their genome there's a
mutation<00:05:59.470> that<00:05:59.500> causes<00:05:59.620> their<00:06:00.070> fur<00:06:00.550> not<00:06:00.760> to

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:00.880 
mutation that causes their fur not to

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:02.550 
mutation that causes their fur not to
stop<00:06:01.090> growing<00:06:01.360> see<00:06:01.570> dogs<00:06:01.750> are<00:06:01.930> supposed<00:06:02.410> to

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:02.560 
stop growing see dogs are supposed to

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:04.320 
stop growing see dogs are supposed to
have<00:06:02.680> further<00:06:02.890> grows<00:06:03.100> so<00:06:03.280> long<00:06:03.490> with<00:06:04.180> poodles

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:04.330 
have further grows so long with poodles

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:06.810 
have further grows so long with poodles
it<00:06:04.600> can<00:06:04.720> grow<00:06:04.870> continually<00:06:05.380> and<00:06:05.680> if<00:06:06.130> you<00:06:06.220> don't

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:06.820 
it can grow continually and if you don't

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:08.400 
it can grow continually and if you don't
trim<00:06:07.510> it<00:06:07.630> they<00:06:07.690> can<00:06:07.810> get<00:06:07.870> in<00:06:07.960> their<00:06:08.050> eyes<00:06:08.170> or

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:08.410 
trim it they can get in their eyes or

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:09.450 
trim it they can get in their eyes or
eyes<00:06:08.500> can<00:06:08.530> get<00:06:08.830> infected<00:06:09.070> they<00:06:09.250> can<00:06:09.370> have

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:09.460 
eyes can get infected they can have

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:10.920 
eyes can get infected they can have
secondary<00:06:09.850> problems<00:06:10.330> because<00:06:10.600> of<00:06:10.750> some<00:06:10.870> of

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:10.930 
secondary problems because of some of

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:11.970 
secondary problems because of some of
these<00:06:11.020> other<00:06:11.200> problems<00:06:11.440> in<00:06:11.710> their<00:06:11.830> DNA

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:11.980 
these other problems in their DNA

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:14.060 
these other problems in their DNA
because<00:06:12.670> of<00:06:12.760> all<00:06:12.880> these<00:06:12.970> mutations<00:06:13.600> you<00:06:13.750> see

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:14.070 
because of all these mutations you see

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:15.900 
because of all these mutations you see
so<00:06:15.070> that's<00:06:15.220> how<00:06:15.310> you<00:06:15.370> get<00:06:15.460> these<00:06:15.580> different

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:15.910 
so that's how you get these different

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:17.310 
so that's how you get these different
breeds<00:06:16.090> of<00:06:16.180> domestic<00:06:16.300> dog<00:06:16.780> just<00:06:17.020> different

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:17.320 
breeds of domestic dog just different

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:19.350 
breeds of domestic dog just different
combinations<00:06:17.770> of<00:06:17.860> genes<00:06:17.920> and<00:06:18.370> mutations

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:19.360 
combinations of genes and mutations

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:23.310 
combinations of genes and mutations
accumulating<00:06:20.320> in<00:06:20.440> the<00:06:20.470> various<00:06:20.770> dog<00:06:20.980> kind<00:06:22.320> but

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:23.320 
accumulating in the various dog kind but

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:25.080 
accumulating in the various dog kind but
it's<00:06:23.440> not<00:06:23.470> evolution<00:06:24.040> because<00:06:24.640> if<00:06:24.820> you<00:06:24.880> start

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:25.090 
it's not evolution because if you start

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:26.580 
it's not evolution because if you start
with<00:06:25.240> these<00:06:25.330> more<00:06:25.540> wild<00:06:25.780> kinds<00:06:26.050> of<00:06:26.140> dogs<00:06:26.290> and

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:26.590 
with these more wild kinds of dogs and

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:28.620 
with these more wild kinds of dogs and
through<00:06:27.460> selective<00:06:28.030> breeding<00:06:28.090> through

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:28.630 
through selective breeding through

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:30.030 
through selective breeding through
natural<00:06:28.960> and<00:06:29.080> artificial<00:06:29.380> selection<00:06:29.740> in<00:06:29.980> the

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:30.040 
natural and artificial selection in the

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:31.350 
natural and artificial selection in the
case<00:06:30.190> of<00:06:30.220> domestic<00:06:30.550> breeds<00:06:30.850> of<00:06:30.910> dogs<00:06:31.090> you<00:06:31.240> get

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:31.360 
case of domestic breeds of dogs you get

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:32.370 
case of domestic breeds of dogs you get
all<00:06:31.450> the<00:06:31.510> way<00:06:31.570> down<00:06:31.690> to<00:06:31.780> the<00:06:31.810> poodle<00:06:32.140> but<00:06:32.290> it's

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:32.380 
all the way down to the poodle but it's

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:34.020 
all the way down to the poodle but it's
not<00:06:32.530> evolution<00:06:33.100> because<00:06:33.250> we<00:06:33.520> haven't<00:06:33.850> gained

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:34.030 
not evolution because we haven't gained

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:35.520 
not evolution because we haven't gained
any<00:06:34.210> information<00:06:34.750> in<00:06:34.840> fact<00:06:35.020> we've<00:06:35.230> lost

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:35.530 
any information in fact we've lost

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:38.180 
any information in fact we've lost
information<00:06:36.400> those<00:06:37.030> mutations<00:06:37.390> reduce

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:38.190 
information those mutations reduce

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:40.080 
information those mutations reduce
information<00:06:39.190> just<00:06:39.670> as<00:06:39.760> natural<00:06:39.910> selection

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:40.090 
information just as natural selection

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:40.959 
information just as natural selection
does<00:06:40.570> they

00:06:40.959 --> 00:06:40.969 
does they

00:06:40.969 --> 00:06:43.389 
does they
information<00:06:41.719> you<00:06:42.439> can<00:06:42.559> think<00:06:42.679> of<00:06:42.799> information

00:06:43.389 --> 00:06:43.399 
information you can think of information

00:06:43.399 --> 00:06:45.759 
information you can think of information
in<00:06:43.549> DNA<00:06:43.669> like<00:06:44.119> jelly<00:06:44.419> beans<00:06:44.659> and<00:06:44.899> so<00:06:45.469> you<00:06:45.559> start

00:06:45.759 --> 00:06:45.769 
in DNA like jelly beans and so you start

00:06:45.769 --> 00:06:46.989 
in DNA like jelly beans and so you start
out<00:06:45.889> with<00:06:46.009> the<00:06:46.069> more<00:06:46.279> wild<00:06:46.519> kinds<00:06:46.789> of<00:06:46.849> dogs

00:06:46.989 --> 00:06:46.999 
out with the more wild kinds of dogs

00:06:46.999 --> 00:06:49.419 
out with the more wild kinds of dogs
that<00:06:47.179> have<00:06:47.389> more<00:06:47.599> information<00:06:48.229> more<00:06:48.429> possible

00:06:49.419 --> 00:06:49.429 
that have more information more possible

00:06:49.429 --> 00:06:51.609 
that have more information more possible
traits<00:06:49.759> and<00:06:50.029> then<00:06:50.659> through<00:06:50.929> inbreeding<00:06:51.439> those

00:06:51.609 --> 00:06:51.619 
traits and then through inbreeding those

00:06:51.619 --> 00:06:53.919 
traits and then through inbreeding those
dogs<00:06:51.889> you<00:06:52.610> can<00:06:52.789> reduce<00:06:53.089> that<00:06:53.269> information<00:06:53.809> and

00:06:53.919 --> 00:06:53.929 
dogs you can reduce that information and

00:06:53.929 --> 00:06:55.329 
dogs you can reduce that information and
through<00:06:54.079> mutations<00:06:54.529> as<00:06:54.649> well<00:06:54.799> and<00:06:55.069> so<00:06:55.189> you<00:06:55.279> get

00:06:55.329 --> 00:06:55.339 
through mutations as well and so you get

00:06:55.339 --> 00:06:56.529 
through mutations as well and so you get
down<00:06:55.459> to<00:06:55.549> the<00:06:55.579> poodle<00:06:55.879> then<00:06:55.999> you<00:06:56.089> have<00:06:56.209> early

00:06:56.529 --> 00:06:56.539 
down to the poodle then you have early

00:06:56.539 --> 00:06:57.519 
down to the poodle then you have early
in<00:06:56.569> the<00:06:56.689> information<00:06:57.079> left<00:06:57.259> you<00:06:57.379> get<00:06:57.499> a

00:06:57.519 --> 00:06:57.529 
in the information left you get a

00:06:57.529 --> 00:07:00.369 
in the information left you get a
biological<00:06:58.219> disaster<00:06:58.579> on<00:06:58.669> your<00:06:58.789> hands<00:06:59.289> but<00:07:00.289> if

00:07:00.369 --> 00:07:00.379 
biological disaster on your hands but if

00:07:00.379 --> 00:07:02.589 
biological disaster on your hands but if
you<00:07:00.469> think<00:07:00.529> about<00:07:00.769> it<00:07:00.999> could<00:07:01.999> you<00:07:02.059> ever<00:07:02.299> turn<00:07:02.569> a

00:07:02.589 --> 00:07:02.599 
you think about it could you ever turn a

00:07:02.599 --> 00:07:04.689 
you think about it could you ever turn a
dog<00:07:02.929> into<00:07:03.469> a<00:07:03.499> cat<00:07:03.829> by<00:07:04.129> this<00:07:04.279> kind<00:07:04.489> of<00:07:04.519> process

00:07:04.689 --> 00:07:04.699 
dog into a cat by this kind of process

00:07:04.699 --> 00:07:07.329 
dog into a cat by this kind of process
by<00:07:05.089> losing<00:07:05.449> information<00:07:05.839> not<00:07:06.829> at<00:07:06.949> all<00:07:07.069> because

00:07:07.329 --> 00:07:07.339 
by losing information not at all because

00:07:07.339 --> 00:07:10.059 
by losing information not at all because
a<00:07:07.729> cat<00:07:07.969> has<00:07:08.209> different<00:07:08.779> information<00:07:09.110> you

00:07:10.059 --> 00:07:10.069 
a cat has different information you

00:07:10.069 --> 00:07:11.679 
a cat has different information you
can't<00:07:10.339> turn<00:07:10.669> one<00:07:10.879> kind<00:07:11.089> of<00:07:11.149> information<00:07:11.329> into

00:07:11.679 --> 00:07:11.689 
can't turn one kind of information into

00:07:11.689 --> 00:07:13.029 
can't turn one kind of information into
another<00:07:11.839> by<00:07:11.989> losing<00:07:12.229> it<00:07:12.469> it<00:07:12.649> doesn't<00:07:12.919> work

00:07:13.029 --> 00:07:13.039 
another by losing it it doesn't work

00:07:13.039 --> 00:07:16.299 
another by losing it it doesn't work
that<00:07:13.069> way<00:07:13.369> so<00:07:14.209> you<00:07:14.269> see<00:07:14.479> evolution<00:07:15.469> can't<00:07:16.069> work

00:07:16.299 --> 00:07:16.309 
that way so you see evolution can't work

00:07:16.309 --> 00:07:18.100 
that way so you see evolution can't work
by<00:07:16.610> natural<00:07:16.969> selection<00:07:16.999> of<00:07:17.449> mutations<00:07:17.929> you

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:18.110 
by natural selection of mutations you

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:19.659 
by natural selection of mutations you
can<00:07:18.229> see<00:07:18.379> that<00:07:18.529> because<00:07:18.799> those<00:07:19.159> processes

00:07:19.659 --> 00:07:19.669 
can see that because those processes

00:07:19.669 --> 00:07:21.669 
can see that because those processes
only<00:07:20.089> reduce<00:07:20.389> information<00:07:21.019> whereas

00:07:21.669 --> 00:07:21.679 
only reduce information whereas

00:07:21.679 --> 00:07:23.229 
only reduce information whereas
evolution<00:07:22.159> is<00:07:22.309> about<00:07:22.819> an<00:07:22.909> increase<00:07:23.209> in
