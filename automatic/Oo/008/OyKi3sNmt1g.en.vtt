00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.180
 one 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.410
 from problems 

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:20.700
 most serious we have had is to be able 

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:23.490
 get the seedlings the way more 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:27.000
 easy that we have found to do it 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:31.040
 to be born is to go through hot water 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:36.420
 one minute in hot water at 80 degrees 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:41.780
 that we are having a birth d 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:47.039
 a 70 80 percent at 45 days sprout 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:50.609
 the week will be the seed comes from five 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:53.649
 centimeters or something else can be and from a 

00:00:50.609 --> 00:00:56.510
 day for another the white dies 

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:59.050
 we get 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:05.399
 herbicides that 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:05.399
 and we are giving here we have 60 plants 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.479
 counting the short 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.090
 making concrete 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.350
 but still seeing it from point of view 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.820
 productive this also serves you as 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.970
 you said in a place that did not come 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:21.830
 absolutely nothing today and one sees and already 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.200
 see the green and on the other hand also 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.790
 provides animal shadow and even at 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:30.500
 animal also sees it as a food 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:35.050
 more no yes yes of course we have this 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.050
 a statistic like I've read 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:42.759
 is another one 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:45.640
 it is doubled where one has 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:47.710
 carob plants on the ground yes 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.670
 can have a cow as you can have 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.180
 for example one and a half 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:55.550
 because the 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:58.520
 the very nutritious chaucha 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:02.570
 good and look for it in the cloud 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:04.789
 very much to continue with this today and 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:07.909
 you are finding the return to the 

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:10.879
 seedlings what is step 27 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:13.370
 good space below first 

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:19.299
 very excited place 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:19.299
 what's up, I think 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:27.500
 and tell young people 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:29.930
 worth worth implementing a 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.780
 template so much 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.830
 last year 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:36.260
 grow up 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:39.070
 and the land is composed 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.070
 very much
