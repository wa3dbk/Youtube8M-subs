00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
that is i put it on one frame and it

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.569 
that is i put it on one frame and it
goes<00:00:49.200> to<00:00:49.379> all<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.559> frames<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:50.399> only

goes to all the frames the only

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.660 
goes to all the frames the only
difference<00:00:50.730> now<00:00:50.969> is<00:00:51.260> when<00:00:52.260> i<00:00:52.289> play<00:00:52.770> this

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670

the defense so again I'm using the
sideline<00:02:25.530> sports<00:02:25.790> program<00:02:26.790> here<00:02:27.120> and<00:02:28.370> I<00:02:30.290> think

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290

it's the best I think it's very very
good<00:02:32.910> you<00:02:33.060> cannot<00:02:33.420> there's<00:02:33.930> no<00:02:34.049> other

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
good you cannot there's no other

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.690 
good you cannot there's no other
programs<00:02:34.590> that<00:02:34.739> i<00:02:34.830> know<00:02:34.890> of<00:02:35.040> that<00:02:35.190> that<00:02:35.610> are

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
programs that i know of that that are

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.750 
programs that i know of that that are
this<00:02:35.879> good<00:02:36.060> that<00:02:36.209> can<00:02:36.330> do<00:02:36.450> animations<00:02:37.049> so

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
this good that can do animations so

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.160 
this good that can do animations so
let's<00:02:38.760> just<00:02:38.970> take<00:02:39.060> a<00:02:39.120> quick<00:02:39.329> look<00:02:39.599> because<00:02:40.049> our

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
let's just take a quick look because our

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:45.710 
let's just take a quick look because our
setup<00:02:42.290> for<00:02:43.610> 52<00:02:44.610> they<00:02:44.849> set<00:02:45.090> up<00:02:45.209> in<00:02:45.299> a<00:02:45.360> little<00:02:45.599> bit

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
setup for 52 they set up in a little bit

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.880 
setup for 52 they set up in a little bit
of<00:02:45.810> a<00:02:45.870> triangle<00:02:46.200> here<00:02:46.530> one<00:02:46.799> is<00:02:48.620> kind<00:02:49.620> of<00:02:49.739> a

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
of a triangle here one is kind of a

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.949 
of a triangle here one is kind of a
looking<00:02:50.549> for<00:02:50.760> that<00:02:50.879> pass<00:02:51.150> over<00:02:51.599> there<00:02:51.750> if<00:02:51.930> you

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
looking for that pass over there if you

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:53.720 
looking for that pass over there if you
can<00:02:52.349> get<00:02:52.620> it<00:02:52.769> they're<00:02:53.069> probably<00:02:53.310> not<00:02:53.519> going<00:02:53.640> to

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
can get it they're probably not going to

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.099 
can get it they're probably not going to
allow<00:02:53.910> that<00:02:53.970> that's<00:02:54.329> why<00:02:54.510> I've<00:02:54.629> come<00:02:54.870> to<00:02:55.019> the

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:55.109 
allow that that's why I've come to the

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:56.599 
allow that that's why I've come to the
next<00:02:55.349> frame<00:02:55.590> he<00:02:55.769> goes<00:02:55.920> straight<00:02:56.160> up<00:02:56.190> to<00:02:56.370> here

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:56.609 
next frame he goes straight up to here

00:02:56.609 --> 00:02:58.759 
next frame he goes straight up to here
I've<00:02:57.090> got<00:02:57.269> the<00:02:57.359> blue<00:02:57.540> marks<00:02:57.870> on<00:02:58.019> here<00:02:58.200> too<00:02:58.410> and

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
I've got the blue marks on here too and

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:01.250 
I've got the blue marks on here too and
then<00:02:59.549> for<00:02:59.819> comes<00:03:00.060> a<00:03:00.150> little<00:03:00.390> bit<00:03:00.510> later<00:03:00.690> so<00:03:00.959> too

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
then for comes a little bit later so too

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.229 
then for comes a little bit later so too
is<00:03:01.319> going<00:03:01.379> to<00:03:01.560> fake<00:03:01.799> and<00:03:02.250> we're<00:03:02.940> going<00:03:03.060> to<00:03:03.120> look

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
is going to fake and we're going to look

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:04.849 
is going to fake and we're going to look
for<00:03:03.299> that<00:03:03.569> they're<00:03:03.989> not<00:03:04.140> usually<00:03:04.349> in<00:03:04.590> to<00:03:04.709> get<00:03:04.799> a

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:04.859 
for that they're not usually in to get a

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:07.550 
for that they're not usually in to get a
pass<00:03:05.129> that<00:03:05.160> little<00:03:05.730> guy<00:03:05.849> there<00:03:06.470> depending<00:03:07.470> how

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
pass that little guy there depending how

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.589 
pass that little guy there depending how
they<00:03:07.739> play<00:03:07.980> for<00:03:08.400> four<00:03:08.849> with<00:03:08.970> the<00:03:09.030> screen<00:03:09.420> on

00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:09.599 
they play for four with the screen on

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:12.110 
they play for four with the screen on
the<00:03:09.810> screener<00:03:10.280> so<00:03:11.280> he's<00:03:11.489> going<00:03:11.670> two<00:03:11.760> fives

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
the screener so he's going two fives

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.490 
the screener so he's going two fives
gonna<00:03:12.329> could<00:03:12.480> come<00:03:12.569> across<00:03:12.870> and<00:03:13.079> then<00:03:13.140> for<00:03:13.440> is

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
gonna could come across and then for is

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.199 
gonna could come across and then for is
going<00:03:13.680> to<00:03:13.739> go<00:03:13.829> straight<00:03:14.220> to<00:03:14.400> the<00:03:14.430> hoop<00:03:14.640> as<00:03:14.910> you

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
going to go straight to the hoop as you

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:19.009 
going to go straight to the hoop as you
can<00:03:15.329> see<00:03:15.829> two<00:03:16.829> fakes<00:03:17.250> goes<00:03:17.609> down<00:03:17.880> four<00:03:18.660> screens

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019 
can see two fakes goes down four screens

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:22.550 
can see two fakes goes down four screens
for<00:03:19.459> 55<00:03:20.459> is<00:03:20.700> going<00:03:20.849> to<00:03:20.970> come<00:03:21.269> to<00:03:21.419> the<00:03:21.510> ball<00:03:21.690> one

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
for 55 is going to come to the ball one

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.650 
for 55 is going to come to the ball one
is<00:03:22.680> going<00:03:22.799> to<00:03:22.889> come<00:03:23.010> over<00:03:23.220> here<00:03:23.419> again<00:03:24.419> you<00:03:24.540> can

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
is going to come over here again you can

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.059 
is going to come over here again you can
modify<00:03:24.900> this<00:03:25.079> however<00:03:25.349> you<00:03:25.560> want<00:03:25.709> to<00:03:25.769> play<00:03:25.950> it

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:26.069 
modify this however you want to play it

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:28.580 
modify this however you want to play it
so<00:03:26.609> first<00:03:26.910> option<00:03:27.269> would<00:03:27.450> be<00:03:27.510> whoever's<00:03:28.470> open

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
so first option would be whoever's open

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.750 
so first option would be whoever's open
first<00:03:29.010> but<00:03:29.190> in<00:03:29.280> this<00:03:29.400> case<00:03:29.900> the<00:03:30.900> screener

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
first but in this case the screener

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.589 
first but in this case the screener
oftentimes<00:03:32.760> is<00:03:32.940> open<00:03:33.209> so<00:03:33.329> we're<00:03:33.419> going<00:03:33.510> to

00:03:33.589 --> 00:03:33.599 
oftentimes is open so we're going to

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:36.080 
oftentimes is open so we're going to
look<00:03:33.690> for<00:03:33.750> that<00:03:34.049> and<00:03:34.489> then<00:03:35.489> the<00:03:35.609> next<00:03:35.760> option

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
look for that and then the next option

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.650 
look for that and then the next option
five<00:03:36.900> or<00:03:37.260> two<00:03:37.530> so<00:03:37.950> two<00:03:38.150> flattens<00:03:39.150> out<00:03:39.299> a<00:03:39.359> lot<00:03:39.569> of

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
five or two so two flattens out a lot of

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.720 
five or two so two flattens out a lot of
times<00:03:39.870> that's<00:03:40.019> a<00:03:40.169> tough<00:03:40.410> pass<00:03:40.650> to<00:03:40.680> defend<00:03:41.310> on

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
times that's a tough pass to defend on

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.699 
times that's a tough pass to defend on
an<00:03:42.419> imbalance<00:03:42.840> especially<00:03:43.290> when<00:03:43.380> these<00:03:43.530> guys

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
an imbalance especially when these guys

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:46.220 
an imbalance especially when these guys
are<00:03:43.859> worried<00:03:44.099> about<00:03:44.220> these<00:03:44.370> two<00:03:45.019> the<00:03:46.019> only

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
are worried about these two the only

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:47.390 
are worried about these two the only
reason<00:03:46.349> I<00:03:46.470> have<00:03:46.560> three<00:03:46.769> balls<00:03:46.919> it's<00:03:47.190> just<00:03:47.310> a

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
reason I have three balls it's just a

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.349 
reason I have three balls it's just a
show<00:03:47.579> where<00:03:48.060> the<00:03:48.150> options<00:03:48.510> are<00:03:48.630> and<00:03:49.019> then<00:03:49.470> last

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:50.359 
show where the options are and then last

00:03:50.359 --> 00:03:53.390 
show where the options are and then last
inside<00:03:51.359> option<00:03:51.720> five<00:03:51.900> and<00:03:52.169> then<00:03:52.290> three<00:03:52.620> so<00:03:53.099> if

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
inside option five and then three so if
