00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
walls this seems to be the easiest way

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.820 
walls this seems to be the easiest way
you're<00:02:58.879> going<00:02:59.000> to<00:02:59.030> jump<00:02:59.330> kind<00:02:59.840> of<00:03:00.080> pull<00:03:00.590> back

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:00.830 
you're going to jump kind of pull back

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:46.370 
you're going to jump kind of pull back
on<00:03:01.069> the<00:03:01.099> stick<00:03:01.430> as<00:03:02.030> you're<00:03:02.180> going<00:03:02.330> down

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:49.630 

crouching<00:03:47.250> works<00:03:47.460> also

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:49.640 
crouching works also

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:54.300 
crouching works also
alright<00:03:50.620> you're<00:03:51.620> going<00:03:51.650> to<00:03:51.770> look<00:03:51.950> straight<00:03:52.280> up

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
alright you're going to look straight up

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:57.550 
alright you're going to look straight up
as<00:03:55.310> seen<00:03:55.610> by<00:03:55.880> the<00:03:55.910> second<00:03:56.420> screen<00:03:56.660> and<00:03:56.870> you<00:03:57.410> can

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560 
as seen by the second screen and you can

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.780 
as seen by the second screen and you can
begin<00:03:57.830> and<00:03:58.130> pick<00:03:58.250> up<00:03:58.400> more<00:03:58.580> health<00:03:58.760> packs<00:04:00.790> try

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
begin and pick up more health packs try

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:05.980 
begin and pick up more health packs try
to<00:04:01.850> stay<00:04:02.090> centered<00:04:02.450> with<00:04:02.569> the<00:04:02.600> floor<00:04:02.930> here<00:04:04.990> and

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:05.990 
to stay centered with the floor here and

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:09.100 
to stay centered with the floor here and
begin<00:04:06.260> dropping<00:04:06.530> packs<00:04:07.310> down<00:04:07.940> again<00:04:08.270> because

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:09.110 
begin dropping packs down again because

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:26.290 
begin dropping packs down again because
you<00:04:09.230> have<00:04:09.260> to<00:04:09.440> go<00:04:09.590> to<00:04:09.800> this<00:04:09.920> floor<00:04:10.160> also

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:26.300 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.610 

obviously<00:04:27.300> easier<00:04:27.630> to<00:04:27.720> do<00:04:27.870> with<00:04:28.050> two<00:04:28.230> people

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
obviously easier to do with two people

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.650 
obviously easier to do with two people
but<00:04:28.770> i'm<00:04:29.580> pretty<00:04:29.730> sure<00:04:29.850> it's<00:04:30.060> possible<00:04:30.420> to<00:04:30.540> do

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:30.660 
but i'm pretty sure it's possible to do

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:40.460 
but i'm pretty sure it's possible to do
it<00:04:30.750> by<00:04:30.840> yourself

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:48.110 

like<00:04:41.070> there's<00:04:41.370> not<00:04:41.610> humming<00:04:41.940> ground

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:48.120 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:05:27.600 

pick<00:04:49.120> up<00:04:49.270> any<00:04:49.450> strays<00:04:49.840> that<00:04:49.870> fall<00:04:50.500> on<00:04:50.650> the<00:04:50.770> pile

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:27.610 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:36.420 

could<00:05:28.180> be<00:05:28.389> enough<00:05:34.469> here<00:05:35.469> I<00:05:35.500> like<00:05:35.740> a<00:05:35.770> Crouch<00:05:36.099> as

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:36.430 
could be enough here I like a Crouch as

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:38.399 
could be enough here I like a Crouch as
I'm<00:05:36.639> landing<00:05:37.060> seems<00:05:37.810> to<00:05:37.900> make<00:05:38.020> me<00:05:38.199> fall

00:05:38.399 --> 00:05:38.409 
I'm landing seems to make me fall

00:05:38.409 --> 00:05:47.139 
I'm landing seems to make me fall
through<00:05:38.620> easier

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:47.149 

00:05:47.149 --> 00:06:02.910 

prepare<00:05:48.149> for<00:05:48.179> fire

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:02.920
