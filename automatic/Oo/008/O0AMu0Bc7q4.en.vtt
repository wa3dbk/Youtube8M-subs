00:00:11.361 --> 00:00:13.361
 I go by the name of Jonzi D

00:00:13.541 --> 00:00:16.640
And I'm the Artistic Director of Breakin' Convention

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.280
And your host.

00:00:18.419 --> 00:00:19.719
We're here at Birmingham

00:00:19.719 --> 00:00:21.039
I have to say that

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:23.539
Whenever we do the Birmingham Hippodrome

00:00:23.598 --> 00:00:25.958
It is no doubt massive!

00:00:39.074 --> 00:00:40.534
MARSO: Yeah, the energy feels...

00:00:41.327 --> 00:00:42.327
NENE: Supportive

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:44.972
Birmingham likes this

00:00:44.972 --> 00:00:46.332
This is what Birmingham is about!

00:00:47.091 --> 00:00:47.965
My name is Ukweli Roach

00:00:48.371 --> 00:00:51.370
I'm a choreographer from BirdGang Dance Company

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.850
And I am touring a piece called Vice

00:01:14.684 --> 00:01:15.684
ANTICS: We've gone with a narrative

00:01:15.923 --> 00:01:19.475
With quite a serious issue that's being addressed

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.280
And we hope that people enjoy it 

00:01:38.817 --> 00:01:41.717
JONZI D: Three words to sum up Breakin' Convention:

00:01:41.956 --> 00:01:42.956
Hype

00:01:42.956 --> 00:01:44.795
Inclusive, and

00:01:44.795 --> 00:01:45.668
Innovative.

00:02:18.106 --> 00:02:19.385
B-GIRL EDDIE: Hi I'm B-Girl Eddie

00:02:19.385 --> 00:02:20.445
B-GIRL TERRA: Hi, this is B-Girl Terra

00:02:20.445 --> 00:02:24.400
TOGETHER: And we are performing at Breakin' Convention 2014!

00:02:36.101 --> 00:02:39.400
LUCA: Anything is possible, as long as we don't create any excuses along the way.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.239
So we tell people: "No Excuses, No Limits."

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:43.979
On behalf of everyone from ILL-Abilities

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:47.699
Breakin' Convention has definitely been the best festival that we've ever participated in.
