there two programs in the Big Ten match

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.549 
there two programs in the Big Ten match
up<00:00:59.520> better<00:00:59.670> than<00:00:59.969> I<00:01:00.449> on<00:01:00.690> Wisconsin<00:01:01.230> in<00:01:01.320> so<00:01:01.440> many

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
up better than I on Wisconsin in so many

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.740 
up better than I on Wisconsin in so many
different<00:01:01.800> ways<00:01:01.980> yeah<00:01:02.399> I've<00:01:02.879> always<00:01:03.120> said<00:01:03.480> and

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
different ways yeah I've always said and

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.119 
different ways yeah I've always said and
it<00:01:03.870> probably<00:01:04.080> is<00:01:04.289> a<00:01:04.320> turn<00:01:04.589> off<00:01:04.619> to<00:01:04.770> some<00:01:05.100> I

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
it probably is a turn off to some I

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.190 
it probably is a turn off to some I
think<00:01:05.460> everything<00:01:05.940> for<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.300> fan<00:01:06.539> bases<00:01:06.810> I

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
think everything for the fan bases I

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.570 
think everything for the fan bases I
think<00:01:07.560> they're<00:01:07.710> much<00:01:07.890> more<00:01:08.100> alike<00:01:08.340> and<00:01:08.490> he

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
think they're much more alike and he

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.550 
think they're much more alike and he
decided<00:01:08.910> to<00:01:09.030> want<00:01:09.210> to<00:01:09.300> admit<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:10.140> way<00:01:10.289> both

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
decided to want to admit the way both

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.469 
decided to want to admit the way both
programs<00:01:11.100> have<00:01:11.310> been<00:01:11.460> built<00:01:11.729> really<00:01:12.000> big<00:01:12.300> into

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
programs have been built really big into

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.660 
programs have been built really big into
the<00:01:12.539> walk-on<00:01:12.990> program<00:01:13.500> built<00:01:13.890> on<00:01:14.100> toughness

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
the walk-on program built on toughness

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.700 
the walk-on program built on toughness
built<00:01:15.000> on<00:01:15.180> substance<00:01:15.810> not<00:01:16.020> so<00:01:16.229> much<00:01:16.470> the

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
built on substance not so much the

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.639 
built on substance not so much the
flashiness<00:01:17.600> you<00:01:18.600> know<00:01:18.690> clearly<00:01:18.960> Iowa's<00:01:19.470> had

the week and that is Melvin Gordon will

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:14.870 
the week and that is Melvin Gordon will
there<00:04:13.290> be<00:04:13.320> more<00:04:13.590> incentive<00:04:14.040> for<00:04:14.250> Melvin<00:04:14.580> who

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 
there be more incentive for Melvin who

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.640 
there be more incentive for Melvin who
verbally<00:04:15.090> committed<00:04:15.690> to<00:04:16.049> the<00:04:16.140> Hawkeyes<00:04:16.500> or

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
verbally committed to the Hawkeyes or

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:17.960 
verbally committed to the Hawkeyes or
more<00:04:16.799> incentive<00:04:17.190> for<00:04:17.280> that<00:04:17.430> defense<00:04:17.640> would

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
more incentive for that defense would

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:20.150 
more incentive for that defense would
like<00:04:18.030> to<00:04:18.150> shut<00:04:18.450> it<00:04:18.540> down<00:04:18.570> and<00:04:19.049> thinking<00:04:19.680> maybe

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 
like to shut it down and thinking maybe

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.130 
like to shut it down and thinking maybe
Melvin<00:04:20.910> at<00:04:21.030> first<00:04:21.269> it<00:04:21.450> might<00:04:21.479> be<00:04:21.780> more<00:04:21.959> the

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.140 
Melvin at first it might be more the

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:24.080 
Melvin at first it might be more the
defense<00:04:22.590> but<00:04:22.770> I'm<00:04:22.860> thinking<00:04:23.460> and<00:04:23.610> Melvin<00:04:23.970> is

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
defense but I'm thinking and Melvin is

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:26.270 
defense but I'm thinking and Melvin is
expecting<00:04:24.690> to<00:04:24.780> hear<00:04:24.960> it<00:04:25.080> a<00:04:25.229> little<00:04:25.620> bit<00:04:25.890> we've

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
expecting to hear it a little bit we've

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:27.830 
expecting to hear it a little bit we've
talked<00:04:26.460> about<00:04:26.610> how<00:04:26.760> close<00:04:27.000> those<00:04:27.150> fans<00:04:27.479> out<00:04:27.720> of

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 
talked about how close those fans out of

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.080 
talked about how close those fans out of
the<00:04:27.900> bench<00:04:28.140> so<00:04:29.040> I<00:04:29.070> imagine<00:04:29.400> those<00:04:29.700> fans<00:04:30.000> who

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.090 
the bench so I imagine those fans who

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:32.990 
the bench so I imagine those fans who
sit<00:04:30.390> close<00:04:30.600> to<00:04:30.780> the<00:04:30.870> bench<00:04:31.080> will<00:04:31.550> offer<00:04:32.550> up<00:04:32.880> a

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
sit close to the bench will offer up a

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000 
sit close to the bench will offer up a
few<00:04:33.150> pleasantries<00:04:33.660> so<00:04:34.020> maybe<00:04:34.229> that'll<00:04:34.500> I

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.010 
few pleasantries so maybe that'll I

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:36.260 
few pleasantries so maybe that'll I
don't<00:04:35.370> know<00:04:35.460> if<00:04:35.520> he<00:04:35.640> needs<00:04:35.910> a<00:04:36.060> lot<00:04:36.240> of

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
don't know if he needs a lot of

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:37.790 
don't know if he needs a lot of
motivation<00:04:36.720> because<00:04:37.110> he's<00:04:37.380> pretty<00:04:37.620> good

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800
