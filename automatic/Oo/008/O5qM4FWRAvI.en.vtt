well<00:01:08.130> up<00:01:08.610> to<00:01:08.939> that<00:01:09.090> one<00:01:09.330> point<00:01:09.600> I<00:01:09.840> think<00:01:10.110> six

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
well up to that one point I think six

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.039 
well up to that one point I think six
two<00:01:10.740> gigahertz<00:01:11.299> so<00:01:12.299> that<00:01:12.540> you'll<00:01:12.720> be<00:01:12.780> able<00:01:12.900> to

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
two gigahertz so that you'll be able to

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.420 
two gigahertz so that you'll be able to
get<00:01:13.200> really<00:01:13.380> good<00:01:13.530> performance<00:01:14.070> out<00:01:14.220> of<00:01:14.250> it

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
get really good performance out of it

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.270 
get really good performance out of it
this<00:01:15.299> is<00:01:15.479> on<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:15.869> latest<00:01:16.170> firmware<00:01:16.680> for<00:01:17.189> the
