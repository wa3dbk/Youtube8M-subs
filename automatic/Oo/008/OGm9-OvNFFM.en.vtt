00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:06.590 

now<00:00:05.580> we<00:00:05.640> thought<00:00:05.940> a<00:00:06.000> lot<00:00:06.120> when<00:00:06.450> we<00:00:06.509> were

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
now we thought a lot when we were

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.690 
now we thought a lot when we were
designing<00:00:06.750> up<00:00:07.230> a<00:00:07.350> watch<00:00:07.529> about<00:00:07.919> how<00:00:08.189> to<00:00:08.250> really

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
designing up a watch about how to really

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.089 
designing up a watch about how to really
reveal<00:00:09.540> all<00:00:09.900> of<00:00:09.929> the<00:00:10.170> great<00:00:10.500> ecosystem<00:00:10.740> of

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
reveal all of the great ecosystem of

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.220 
reveal all of the great ecosystem of
applications<00:00:11.309> on<00:00:11.910> this<00:00:12.059> device<00:00:12.360> and<00:00:13.080> we

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
applications on this device and we

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:14.270 
applications on this device and we
wanted<00:00:13.440> to<00:00:13.530> build<00:00:13.620> it<00:00:13.799> in<00:00:13.889> a<00:00:13.920> way<00:00:13.950> that<00:00:14.040> was

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
wanted to build it in a way that was

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.129 
wanted to build it in a way that was
really<00:00:14.309> easy<00:00:14.639> to<00:00:14.730> find<00:00:15.030> and<00:00:15.299> use<00:00:15.509> so<00:00:16.020> we've

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
really easy to find and use so we've

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:17.870 
really easy to find and use so we've
connected<00:00:16.410> it<00:00:16.619> to<00:00:16.680> the<00:00:16.830> digital<00:00:17.100> crown<00:00:17.369> so<00:00:17.789> if

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
connected it to the digital crown so if

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.279 
connected it to the digital crown so if
I<00:00:17.940> press<00:00:18.090> the<00:00:18.390> digital<00:00:18.510> crown<00:00:18.690> at<00:00:18.990> the<00:00:19.020> top

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.710 
I press the digital crown at the top
here<00:00:19.560> it<00:00:20.430> takes<00:00:20.609> me<00:00:20.760> out<00:00:20.880> to<00:00:21.000> my<00:00:21.090> applications

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
here it takes me out to my applications

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.990 
here it takes me out to my applications
very<00:00:22.109> easy<00:00:22.410> to<00:00:22.619> get<00:00:22.769> out<00:00:22.859> to<00:00:23.010> my<00:00:23.130> apps<00:00:23.310> and<00:00:23.609> I

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.650 
it's going to a little simulated walk
too<00:03:00.720> so<00:03:00.960> you<00:03:01.050> can<00:03:01.080> see<00:03:01.260> how<00:03:01.350> it<00:03:01.470> goes<00:03:01.650> here<00:03:02.660> now

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
too so you can see how it goes here now

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.180 
too so you can see how it goes here now
while<00:03:03.840> you're<00:03:03.990> walking<00:03:04.170> Apple<00:03:04.830> watch<00:03:04.980> will

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
while you're walking Apple watch will

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.040 
while you're walking Apple watch will
give<00:03:05.310> you<00:03:05.430> a<00:03:05.490> taptic<00:03:05.880> feedback<00:03:06.300> on<00:03:06.510> each<00:03:06.660> turn

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
give you a taptic feedback on each turn

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:08.720 
give you a taptic feedback on each turn
so<00:03:07.650> you'll<00:03:07.770> know<00:03:07.890> whether<00:03:08.070> it's<00:03:08.250> time<00:03:08.430> to<00:03:08.580> turn

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
so you'll know whether it's time to turn

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.330 
so you'll know whether it's time to turn
left<00:03:09.000> or<00:03:09.480> to<00:03:09.660> turn<00:03:09.810> right<00:03:10.110> and<00:03:10.380> those<00:03:10.830> feelings

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
left or to turn right and those feelings

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.430 
left or to turn right and those feelings
are<00:03:11.520> different<00:03:11.550> for<00:03:12.210> each<00:03:12.300> direction<00:03:12.570> so<00:03:13.380> you

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
are different for each direction so you

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:14.720 
are different for each direction so you
can<00:03:13.590> actually<00:03:13.710> know<00:03:13.980> without<00:03:14.250> even<00:03:14.460> looking

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
can actually know without even looking

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.160 
can actually know without even looking
at<00:03:14.790> your<00:03:14.940> watch<00:03:15.090> which<00:03:15.420> way<00:03:15.570> to<00:03:15.630> go<00:03:15.840> it's<00:03:16.020> like
