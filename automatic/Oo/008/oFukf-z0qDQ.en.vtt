00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950 
right here we have a 430 scuderia from

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.340 
right here we have a 430 scuderia from
Ferrari<00:01:18.250> it's<00:01:18.610> a<00:01:18.820> 510<00:01:19.540> horsepower<00:01:19.720> it's<00:01:20.229> got

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350 
Ferrari it's a 510 horsepower it's got

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:21.600 
Ferrari it's a 510 horsepower it's got
the<00:01:20.470> engine<00:01:20.590> in<00:01:20.830> the<00:01:20.890> middle<00:01:21.070> of<00:01:21.100> the<00:01:21.159> car<00:01:21.369> has

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:21.610 
the engine in the middle of the car has

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:23.219 
the engine in the middle of the car has
a<00:01:21.640> nice<00:01:21.880> balance<00:01:22.180> probably<00:01:22.960> one<00:01:23.080> of<00:01:23.110> the

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:23.229 
a nice balance probably one of the

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:24.510 
a nice balance probably one of the
quickest<00:01:23.590> shifting<00:01:23.920> cars<00:01:24.130> on<00:01:24.310> the<00:01:24.369> racetrack

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
quickest shifting cars on the racetrack

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.969 
quickest shifting cars on the racetrack
it<00:01:24.909> really<00:01:25.180> gives<00:01:25.330> you<00:01:25.540> that<00:01:25.690> kind<00:01:26.500> of<00:01:26.650> formula

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:26.979 
it really gives you that kind of formula

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:29.190 
it really gives you that kind of formula
one<00:01:27.369> inspired<00:01:27.880> deal<00:01:28.360> with<00:01:28.570> that<00:01:28.720> transmission

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:29.200 
one inspired deal with that transmission

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.139 
one inspired deal with that transmission
and<00:01:29.680> also<00:01:29.979> just<00:01:30.310> everything<00:01:30.759> that's<00:01:30.790> going<00:01:31.060> on

00:01:31.139 --> 00:01:31.149 
and also just everything that's going on

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:32.520 
and also just everything that's going on
it's<00:01:31.360> got<00:01:31.479> the<00:01:31.570> ship<00:01:31.780> lights<00:01:32.020> on<00:01:32.229> the<00:01:32.320> top<00:01:32.470> of

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530 
it's got the ship lights on the top of

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.680 
it's got the ship lights on the top of
the<00:01:32.710> wheel<00:01:32.920> so<00:01:33.790> if<00:01:34.000> they<00:01:34.090> really<00:01:34.270> wanted<00:01:34.570> to

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:34.690 
the wheel so if they really wanted to

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:36.330 
the wheel so if they really wanted to
emulate<00:01:34.899> a<00:01:35.110> Formula<00:01:35.530> One<00:01:35.560> car<00:01:35.740> for<00:01:36.220> the<00:01:36.280> street

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.340 
emulate a Formula One car for the street

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.070 
emulate a Formula One car for the street
what<00:01:36.850> the<00:01:36.970> top<00:01:37.119> speed<00:01:37.360> on<00:01:37.390> this<00:01:37.509> thing<00:01:37.630> top

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.080 
what the top speed on this thing top

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:39.480 
what the top speed on this thing top
speed<00:01:38.350> is<00:01:38.500> a<00:01:38.530> little<00:01:38.770> over<00:01:38.920> 200<00:01:39.070> miles<00:01:39.369> per

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490 
speed is a little over 200 miles per

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:41.010 
speed is a little over 200 miles per
hour<00:01:39.670> at<00:01:39.789> this<00:01:39.970> car<00:01:40.119> but<00:01:40.300> it's<00:01:40.420> all<00:01:40.600> about<00:01:40.630> how

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 
hour at this car but it's all about how

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:42.270 
hour at this car but it's all about how
it<00:01:41.110> gets<00:01:41.200> in<00:01:41.410> and<00:01:41.560> out<00:01:41.590> of<00:01:41.649> the<00:01:41.770> corners<00:01:42.100> and

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.280 
it gets in and out of the corners and

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.010 
it gets in and out of the corners and
how<00:01:42.580> it<00:01:42.729> accelerates<00:01:42.970> in<00:01:43.390> an<00:01:43.600> outer<00:01:43.720> corners

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
how it accelerates in an outer corners

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.930 
how it accelerates in an outer corners
with<00:01:44.140> its<00:01:44.289> balance<00:01:44.679> and<00:01:44.860> you<00:01:45.640> know<00:01:45.729> just

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:45.940 
with its balance and you know just

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:47.520 
with its balance and you know just
mobility<00:01:46.810> of<00:01:46.840> the<00:01:46.929> car<00:01:47.140> so<00:01:47.320> it's<00:01:47.440> very

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
mobility of the car so it's very

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:49.380 
mobility of the car so it's very
possible<00:01:47.649> to<00:01:48.160> today<00:01:48.429> I'm<00:01:48.580> going<00:01:48.789> to<00:01:48.850> go<00:01:48.970> faster

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
possible to today I'm going to go faster

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.330 
possible to today I'm going to go faster
them<00:01:49.570> about<00:01:49.840> definitely<00:01:50.770> I<00:01:50.920> think<00:01:50.979> there's<00:01:51.280> a

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340 
them about definitely I think there's a

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:52.529 
them about definitely I think there's a
big<00:01:51.759> chance<00:01:51.970> that<00:01:52.119> you're<00:01:52.300> going<00:01:52.390> to<00:01:52.450> be

00:01:52.529 --> 00:01:52.539 
big chance that you're going to be

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:54.749 
big chance that you're going to be
