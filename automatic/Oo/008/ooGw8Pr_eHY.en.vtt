in<00:01:55.909> many<00:01:56.119> places<00:01:56.539> where<00:01:56.869> you<00:01:56.929> know<00:01:57.200> kitchen

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:57.439 
in many places where you know kitchen

00:01:57.439 --> 00:01:58.899 
in many places where you know kitchen
stores<00:01:57.679> you're<00:01:57.829> going<00:01:57.859> to<00:01:58.009> find<00:01:58.369> jiggers<00:01:58.700> like

00:01:58.899 --> 00:01:58.909 
stores you're going to find jiggers like

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:00.609 
stores you're going to find jiggers like
this<00:01:59.119> one<00:01:59.509> of<00:01:59.599> the<00:01:59.659> problems<00:01:59.959> you<00:02:00.049> run<00:02:00.169> into<00:02:00.439> is

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:00.619 
this one of the problems you run into is

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:02.469 
this one of the problems you run into is
they're<00:02:00.889> not<00:02:01.099> listed<00:02:01.459> what<00:02:01.759> the<00:02:01.909> measures<00:02:02.270> are

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479 
they're not listed what the measures are

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:04.989 
they're not listed what the measures are
they'll<00:02:02.779> say<00:02:02.929> a<00:02:03.130> jigger<00:02:04.130> and<00:02:04.310> a<00:02:04.399> half<00:02:04.579> a<00:02:04.729> jigger

00:02:04.989 --> 00:02:04.999 
they'll say a jigger and a half a jigger

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:06.639 
they'll say a jigger and a half a jigger
on<00:02:05.119> one<00:02:05.329> side<00:02:05.539> or<00:02:05.689> the<00:02:05.719> other<00:02:05.810> so<00:02:06.289> it's<00:02:06.409> very

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:06.649 
on one side or the other so it's very

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:08.020 
on one side or the other so it's very
important<00:02:07.009> to<00:02:07.069> make<00:02:07.219> sure<00:02:07.249> you<00:02:07.489> buy<00:02:07.639> jiggers

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
important to make sure you buy jiggers

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:09.790 
important to make sure you buy jiggers
that<00:02:08.209> are<00:02:08.300> marked<00:02:08.750> exactly<00:02:09.200> what<00:02:09.679> the

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
that are marked exactly what the

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.160 
that are marked exactly what the
measures<00:02:10.069> are<00:02:10.280> and<00:02:10.940> you<00:02:11.150> may<00:02:11.360> be<00:02:11.420> tested<00:02:12.110> at

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
measures are and you may be tested at

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:13.300 
measures are and you may be tested at
home<00:02:12.290> to<00:02:12.440> make<00:02:12.560> sure<00:02:12.590> they<00:02:12.830> actually<00:02:12.860> get<00:02:13.220> the

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
home to make sure they actually get the

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.790 
home to make sure they actually get the
triggers<00:02:13.610> right<00:02:13.810> the<00:02:14.810> sizes<00:02:15.290> you<00:02:15.320> want<00:02:15.560> to<00:02:15.650> get

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
triggers right the sizes you want to get

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:16.510 
triggers right the sizes you want to get
could

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 
could

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.520 
could
run<00:02:16.670> the<00:02:16.850> gamut<00:02:17.120> everything<00:02:17.450> and<00:02:17.900> you<00:02:17.960> see<00:02:18.290> all

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
run the gamut everything and you see all

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.080 
run the gamut everything and you see all
sorts<00:02:18.560> a<00:02:18.860> different<00:02:18.890> things<00:02:19.250> from<00:02:19.370> one<00:02:19.970> and<00:02:20.060> a

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
sorts a different things from one and a

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:21.730 
sorts a different things from one and a
half<00:02:20.210> on<00:02:20.360> one<00:02:20.390> side<00:02:20.750> to<00:02:20.900> two<00:02:21.110> on<00:02:21.260> the<00:02:21.380> other<00:02:21.560> and

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:21.740 
half on one side to two on the other and

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:24.690 
half on one side to two on the other and
so<00:02:21.860> forth<00:02:21.890> the<00:02:22.730> sizes<00:02:23.150> that<00:02:23.180> I<00:02:23.330> like<00:02:23.630> using<00:02:23.840> are

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
so forth the sizes that I like using are

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:30.790 
so forth the sizes that I like using are
2<00:02:25.700> ounce<00:02:25.880> 1<00:02:26.150> ounce<00:02:26.180> and<00:02:28.060> 3/4<00:02:29.060> 1/2<00:02:29.660> with<00:02:30.560> these

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:30.800 
2 ounce 1 ounce and 3/4 1/2 with these

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.040 
2 ounce 1 ounce and 3/4 1/2 with these
measures<00:02:31.250> you<00:02:31.430> can<00:02:31.460> basically<00:02:31.820> make<00:02:32.300> most

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
measures you can basically make most

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.020 
measures you can basically make most
drinks<00:02:33.680> those<00:02:34.130> give<00:02:34.280> me<00:02:34.310> some<00:02:34.640> that<00:02:34.820> kind<00:02:34.970> of

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
drinks those give me some that kind of

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:36.880 
drinks those give me some that kind of
fuss<00:02:35.210> around<00:02:35.510> this<00:02:36.260> one's<00:02:36.500> going<00:02:36.620> to<00:02:36.650> fuss<00:02:36.830> her

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
fuss around this one's going to fuss her

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
fuss around this one's going to fuss her
a<00:02:36.950> little<00:02:37.070> bit<00:02:37.190> just<00:02:37.340> because<00:02:37.550> I've<00:02:37.670> got<00:02:37.820> to

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
a little bit just because I've got to

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.480 
a little bit just because I've got to
use<00:02:38.000> 2<00:02:38.210> measures<00:02:38.600> rather<00:02:39.200> than<00:02:39.620> the<00:02:40.130> one<00:02:40.310> I'd

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:40.490 
use 2 measures rather than the one I'd

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:41.980 
use 2 measures rather than the one I'd
use<00:02:40.700> for<00:02:40.880> the<00:02:40.940> Ox<00:02:41.090> so<00:02:41.300> let's<00:02:41.540> take<00:02:41.690> a<00:02:41.720> look<00:02:41.840> how

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:41.990 
use for the Ox so let's take a look how

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:44.560 
use for the Ox so let's take a look how
it<00:02:42.020> works<00:02:42.790> so<00:02:43.790> I'm<00:02:43.880> going<00:02:44.000> to<00:02:44.030> use<00:02:44.150> one<00:02:44.450> and<00:02:44.540> a

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:44.570 
it works so I'm going to use one and a

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:52.120 
it works so I'm going to use one and a
half<00:02:44.690> ounces<00:02:44.930> of<00:02:45.200> rye<00:02:45.770> whiskey<00:02:48.820> so<00:02:50.890> just<00:02:51.890> fill

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
half ounces of rye whiskey so just fill

00:02:52.130 --> 00:03:01.270 
half ounces of rye whiskey so just fill
the<00:02:52.280> top<00:02:52.490> and<00:02:52.790> pour<00:02:53.090> one<00:02:53.750> ounce<00:02:57.160> 1/2<00:02:58.160> ounce<00:03:00.280> and

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
the top and pour one ounce 1/2 ounce and

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:06.670 
the top and pour one ounce 1/2 ounce and
we<00:03:01.370> use<00:03:01.490> 3/4<00:03:01.970> ounce<00:03:02.120> of<00:03:02.510> drive<00:03:02.720> with<00:03:05.470> which<00:03:06.470> now

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
we use 3/4 ounce of drive with which now

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:14.350 
we use 3/4 ounce of drive with which now
I<00:03:06.710> have<00:03:06.860> a<00:03:06.920> 3/4<00:03:07.520> on<00:03:07.850> this<00:03:08.240> side<00:03:11.440> and<00:03:13.210> 3/4<00:03:14.210> ounce

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360 
I have a 3/4 on this side and 3/4 ounce

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.560 
I have a 3/4 on this side and 3/4 ounce
of<00:03:14.810> pineapple<00:03:15.440> juice<00:03:16.030> of<00:03:17.030> course<00:03:17.300> you<00:03:17.390> want<00:03:17.510> to

of pineapple juice of course you want to

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:19.150 
of pineapple juice of course you want to
make<00:03:17.690> sure<00:03:17.720> you<00:03:18.020> use<00:03:18.200> the<00:03:18.380> unsweetened

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:25.550 
can which is pineapples kind of rather

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:29.500 
can which is pineapples kind of rather
hard<00:03:25.820> to<00:03:25.910> squeeze<00:03:26.830> now<00:03:27.940> with<00:03:28.940> pineapple<00:03:29.480> juice

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
hard to squeeze now with pineapple juice

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.240 
hard to squeeze now with pineapple juice
since<00:03:30.050> it<00:03:30.170> is<00:03:30.260> an<00:03:30.380> opaque<00:03:30.650> ingredient<00:03:31.190> you

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 
since it is an opaque ingredient you

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:32.320 
since it is an opaque ingredient you
might<00:03:31.400> want<00:03:31.550> to<00:03:31.580> think<00:03:31.760> you<00:03:31.850> want<00:03:32.000> to<00:03:32.090> shake

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:32.330 
might want to think you want to shake

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:34.330 
might want to think you want to shake
this<00:03:32.510> instead<00:03:32.959> of<00:03:33.080> stirring<00:03:33.260> it<00:03:33.470> the<00:03:33.920> problem

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
this instead of stirring it the problem

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.160 
this instead of stirring it the problem
with<00:03:34.430> pineapple<00:03:34.970> juice<00:03:35.000> is<00:03:35.510> the<00:03:35.540> enzymes

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.170 
with pineapple juice is the enzymes

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:38.590 
with pineapple juice is the enzymes
cause<00:03:36.440> it<00:03:36.680> to<00:03:36.860> foam<00:03:37.430> up<00:03:37.730> a<00:03:38.030> little<00:03:38.240> bit<00:03:38.390> more

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:38.600 
cause it to foam up a little bit more

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.480 
cause it to foam up a little bit more
than<00:03:38.870> orange<00:03:39.110> juice<00:03:39.260> or<00:03:39.530> lime<00:03:39.650> juice<00:03:39.680> does<00:03:40.040> so

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:40.490 
than orange juice or lime juice does so

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:42.940 
than orange juice or lime juice does so
I<00:03:40.520> prefer<00:03:40.790> to<00:03:41.060> stir<00:03:41.420> pineapple<00:03:42.080> juice<00:03:42.290> unless

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:42.950 
I prefer to stir pineapple juice unless

00:03:42.950 --> 00:04:10.160 
I prefer to stir pineapple juice unless
you<00:03:43.100> want<00:03:43.280> the<00:03:43.370> phone<00:03:43.520> rather<00:03:43.790> than<00:03:43.910> shake<00:03:44.209> it

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:21.170 

we<00:04:11.170> strain<00:04:11.439> this<00:04:11.560> into<00:04:11.709> our<00:04:11.829> cocktail<00:04:12.310> glass

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.279 

and<00:04:22.180> one<00:04:22.270> of<00:04:22.360> the<00:04:22.419> problems<00:04:22.720> of<00:04:22.780> pineapple

00:04:23.279 --> 00:04:23.289 
and one of the problems of pineapple

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:24.719 
and one of the problems of pineapple
juice<00:04:23.320> is<00:04:23.650> quite<00:04:23.860> often<00:04:24.039> it<00:04:24.370> kind<00:04:24.669> of
