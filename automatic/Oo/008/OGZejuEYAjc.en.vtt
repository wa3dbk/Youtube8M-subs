00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.960
 and we also 

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:06.170
 Y 

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:10.690
 it is difficult for many to forget our 

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:12.760
 first game in videogames 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:13.510
 our first battle our first 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:16.600
 career 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:18.789
 our first that in many different 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:20.760
 types of games and we know it's difficult 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:23.260
 forget because it 's the first time 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.450
 we keep as gods that is against 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:28.030
 strike they killed me as soon as I started in 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:32.020
 e3 pizzo was each grade in the blog and 

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:34.120
 steal 2 affected button every time 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:36.610
 at the peak of them something similar 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:39.820
 how to forget my first departure villa 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:42.010
 auxiliary had no idea and in shit was 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:45.190
 his and therefore no idea what he was doing 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:47.320
 but it was my first champion manny stanton 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.960
 who did not like until today 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:52.360
 it has not play again for the same reason his 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:55.120
 stable I remember that I went to the photo and 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:58.930
 they said that I had to kill and I eat 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:01.210
 town both newbies asked that those 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.949
 opinions and told me those things girls 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:05.290
 that are there that kill themselves senseless 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:07.810
 and I was like something that was not very 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:09.369
 interested in playing with laws of fact 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.040
 when they did to me what were the 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:14.649
 had it as something that I had not 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:17.200
 called for nothing at all attention and 

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:21.170
 I am here today, then like all good 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:24.259
 like all good time as a rookie 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:28.130
 there are four domains novelty the gold and I 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:30.140
 they said does not have as I do not remember if 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.009
 win that game surely if they were 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.210
 bots 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:34.100
 although not so bad that I do not 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.780
 I would be surprised if I had left 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.610
 this activity had so much 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.259
 ignorance of the cobos that neither 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.360
 I did not even know if they had 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:44.270
 skills to the champions is more 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:48.350
 conciliate in the first game and at level 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:50.600
 13 and still did not raise any skill or 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.340
 so I was hitting basic all the 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.060
 machines until you have no wands 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:57.319
 life on these supposed abilities 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.360
 obviously as a small creature 

00:01:57.319 --> 00:02:01.610
 innocent I thought they were medicine cabinets of 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:04.880
 life then when I had little life 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:06.920
 learn logical but I noticed that my life 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:10.630
 it was still intact and nothing was happening 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.630
 Then I asked again 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.880
 how the skills were up 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:19.340
 obviously I did not see them and he told me 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.350
 which is excited out are like 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.880
 four and he started to tighten until 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:24.500
 really that the ability to remove in 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.320
 black and white passed black and white 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:30.130
 or color is really could be used 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:31.990
 they were already available 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:33.910
 in this sense a moment was when 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:36.160
 I understood that was a part of my fear 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:38.020
 second eastern party and I remember 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:41.320
 that hurt me because the only thing 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:45.760
 wanted was to murder and murder in ways 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:48.690
 they told me because I did not pass 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.690
 all day muriel 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:56.140
 the first game with something that 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:57.760
 you have done when you were a manco 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.500
 fuck the subject down here in the 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.900
 comments if you remember how was your 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.250
 first game of any jurisdiction and 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.310
 I say of any game because in it 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.870
 we are going to start expanding 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.550
 talking about the different types of 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:12.840
 games from now on we go to a 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:12.840
 small service to the community 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:28.500
 if you're listening I recommend a lot 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:30.630
 go through the channel 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:33.300
 are some guys who take music from 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:35.670
 snes and transform them to leave all 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:37.590
 these things that are very very cool is 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:40.080
 quite because they have all kinds of 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:42.360
 songs of this kirby going on with 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.260

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.660

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.880
 if you really like these songs and if 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:50.730
 you like to listen to metallized rap like 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:52.530
 League consumption party and tactics that 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:54.500
 I recommend a lot that you are going to take out because 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.790
 obviously the songs that such 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:04:00.410
 very good recommended to one hundred 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.410
