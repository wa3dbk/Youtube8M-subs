00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529 
showing you a redstone thing I've been

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:07.460 
showing you a redstone thing I've been
working<00:00:04.920> on<00:00:05.009> on<00:00:05.819> my<00:00:06.089> new<00:00:06.210> test<00:00:06.480> world<00:00:06.720> all<00:00:07.170> my

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
working on on my new test world all my

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
problem with a mod so I had to delete

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.259 
problem with a mod so I had to delete
everything<00:00:12.750> and<00:00:12.990> lost<00:00:13.200> all<00:00:13.349> my<00:00:13.440> worlds<00:00:14.120> anyway

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
everything and lost all my worlds anyway

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.660 
everything and lost all my worlds anyway
so<00:00:15.770> today<00:00:16.770> I'm<00:00:16.859> gonna<00:00:16.980> be<00:00:17.070> teaching<00:00:17.190> you<00:00:17.369> how

so today I'm gonna be teaching you how

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.939 
so today I'm gonna be teaching you how
to<00:00:17.699> make<00:00:17.850> a<00:00:19.220> light<00:00:20.220> switch<00:00:20.490> like<00:00:20.970> this<00:00:21.000> one

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:21.949 
to make a light switch like this one

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:27.529 
to make a light switch like this one
using<00:00:22.949> glowstone<00:00:24.619> it's<00:00:25.619> pretty<00:00:25.859> compact<00:00:26.539> you

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
using glowstone it's pretty compact you

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.240 
using glowstone it's pretty compact you
know<00:00:27.630> it's<00:00:27.810> easily<00:00:28.080> hidden<00:00:28.349> you<00:00:28.800> can<00:00:28.980> hardly

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
know it's easily hidden you can hardly

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.230 
know it's easily hidden you can hardly
tell<00:00:29.429> that<00:00:29.490> it's<00:00:29.730> up<00:00:29.849> there

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
tell that it's up there

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.410 
tell that it's up there
sheesh<00:00:30.929> one<00:00:31.109> block<00:00:31.289> higher<00:00:31.470> than<00:00:31.679> usual<00:00:32.420> so

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
sheesh one block higher than usual so

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.569 
sheesh one block higher than usual so
it's<00:00:34.050> gonna<00:00:34.200> get<00:00:34.350> started<00:00:34.950> building<00:00:35.190> if<00:00:35.460> you

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
it's gonna get started building if you

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.780 
it's gonna get started building if you
you're<00:00:36.030> gonna<00:00:36.149> need<00:00:36.329> some<00:00:36.660> pistons<00:00:37.790> some

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
you're gonna need some pistons some

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.200 
you're gonna need some pistons some
glass<00:00:40.129> redstone<00:00:41.129> all<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:41.730> things<00:00:41.910> I've<00:00:42.059> got

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
glass redstone all the things I've got

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.380 
glass redstone all the things I've got
on<00:00:42.300> the<00:00:42.360> bottom<00:00:42.480> here<00:00:43.610> so<00:00:44.610> first<00:00:45.090> you<00:00:45.180> need<00:00:45.239> to

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
on the bottom here so first you need to

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.540 
on the bottom here so first you need to
meet<00:00:45.510> this<00:00:45.719> little<00:00:45.960> redstone<00:00:46.379> elevator<00:00:47.219> thing

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
meet this little redstone elevator thing

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.110 
meet this little redstone elevator thing
and<00:00:49.100> to<00:00:50.100> do<00:00:50.219> that<00:00:50.370> I'm<00:00:50.489> gonna<00:00:50.610> put<00:00:50.820> a<00:00:50.850> torch

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
and to do that I'm gonna put a torch

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.680 
and to do that I'm gonna put a torch
here<00:00:51.829> and<00:00:52.829> a<00:00:52.920> block<00:00:53.160> up<00:00:53.309> here<00:00:53.340> I<00:00:53.910> shall<00:00:54.539> leave

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
here and a block up here I shall leave

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.060 
here and a block up here I shall leave
that<00:00:54.840> open<00:00:54.899> so<00:00:55.140> that<00:00:55.170> you<00:00:55.320> can<00:00:55.469> see<00:00:55.800> where<00:00:55.949> it

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
that open so that you can see where it

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.229 
that open so that you can see where it
is<00:00:56.100> and<00:00:56.390> then<00:00:57.390> I'm<00:00:57.960> gonna<00:00:58.079> have<00:00:58.289> a<00:00:58.350> lever<00:00:58.859> here

00:00:59.229 --> 00:00:59.239 
is and then I'm gonna have a lever here

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:01.369 
is and then I'm gonna have a lever here
and<00:01:00.239> cover<00:01:00.780> this<00:01:00.899> up

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
and cover this up

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.799 
and cover this up
I<00:01:01.410> wanna<00:01:02.309> flick<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:02.879> lever<00:01:03.030> that's<00:01:03.449> gonna<00:01:03.600> go

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
I wanna flick the lever that's gonna go

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.580 
I wanna flick the lever that's gonna go
off<00:01:03.840> and<00:01:04.320> allow<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.720> redstone<00:01:06.720> up<00:01:06.810> there<00:01:06.990> too

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
off and allow the redstone up there too

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.109 
off and allow the redstone up there too
outside<00:01:08.369> my<00:01:08.549> shorts<00:01:08.850> nothing

00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:10.119 
outside my shorts nothing

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:12.660 
outside my shorts nothing
when<00:01:10.810> I<00:01:10.869> flip<00:01:11.020> this<00:01:11.109> lever<00:01:11.289> it's<00:01:11.500> gonna<00:01:11.670> look

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:12.670 
when I flip this lever it's gonna look

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:14.160 
when I flip this lever it's gonna look
now<00:01:13.000> the<00:01:13.060> redstone<00:01:13.420> I'll<00:01:13.539> be<00:01:13.630> off<00:01:13.780> and<00:01:14.049> now

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 
now the redstone I'll be off and now

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.679 
now the redstone I'll be off and now
after<00:01:14.259> beyond<00:01:14.530> I<00:01:14.799> now<00:01:15.640> just<00:01:16.090> go<00:01:16.210> up<00:01:16.329> here<00:01:16.509> real

00:01:16.679 --> 00:01:16.689 
after beyond I now just go up here real

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:19.349 
after beyond I now just go up here real
quick<00:01:17.429> I've<00:01:18.429> already<00:01:18.670> got<00:01:18.759> the<00:01:18.850> Pistons<00:01:19.210> and

00:01:19.349 --> 00:01:19.359 
quick I've already got the Pistons and

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:22.529 
quick I've already got the Pistons and
stuff<00:01:19.539> set<00:01:19.750> up<00:01:20.670> so<00:01:21.670> you<00:01:21.759> can<00:01:21.880> see<00:01:22.090> here<00:01:22.329> it<00:01:22.450> is

00:01:22.529 --> 00:01:22.539 
stuff set up so you can see here it is

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:25.440 
stuff set up so you can see here it is
look<00:01:23.280> pop<00:01:24.280> some<00:01:24.490> redstone<00:01:24.670> down<00:01:25.149> and<00:01:25.359> now

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:25.450 
look pop some redstone down and now

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.679 
look pop some redstone down and now
that's<00:01:25.659> receiving<00:01:26.049> power<00:01:27.329> you<00:01:28.329> can<00:01:28.420> get<00:01:28.600> rid

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:28.689 
that's receiving power you can get rid

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:30.090 
that's receiving power you can get rid
of<00:01:28.750> all<00:01:28.869> this<00:01:29.049> so<00:01:29.229> you<00:01:29.289> can<00:01:29.469> see<00:01:29.679> a<00:01:29.709> bit<00:01:29.860> back

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.100 
of all this so you can see a bit back

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.100 
of all this so you can see a bit back
this<00:01:30.429> is<00:01:30.579> just<00:01:30.729> to<00:01:30.789> make<00:01:30.939> it<00:01:30.969> look<00:01:31.329> a<00:01:31.990> little

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:32.110 
this is just to make it look a little

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:35.490 
this is just to make it look a little
bit<00:01:32.380> less<00:01:33.149> so<00:01:34.149> you<00:01:34.240> can<00:01:34.390> so<00:01:34.869> you<00:01:34.899> can't<00:01:35.140> see<00:01:35.350> the

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:35.500 
bit less so you can so you can't see the

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.270 
bit less so you can so you can't see the
circuitry<00:01:36.329> anyway<00:01:37.329> so<00:01:37.390> let's<00:01:38.170> quickly<00:01:38.439> put

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280 
circuitry anyway so let's quickly put

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:40.679 
circuitry anyway so let's quickly put
this<00:01:39.399> up<00:01:39.609> so<00:01:40.090> you<00:01:40.119> need<00:01:40.359> to<00:01:40.450> place<00:01:40.659> your

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:40.689 
this up so you need to place your

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:44.699 
this up so you need to place your
redstone<00:01:41.020> coming<00:01:41.799> towards<00:01:42.130> this<00:01:42.280> and<00:01:43.709> going

00:01:44.699 --> 00:01:44.709 
redstone coming towards this and going

00:01:44.709 --> 00:01:49.620 
redstone coming towards this and going
around<00:01:44.799> here<00:01:45.280> like<00:01:46.890> like<00:01:47.890> so<00:01:48.459> it's<00:01:49.390> got<00:01:49.509> to<00:01:49.569> be

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 
around here like like so it's got to be

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.209 
around here like like so it's got to be
coming<00:01:49.810> directly<00:01:50.079> towards<00:01:50.770> that<00:01:50.890> you<00:01:50.979> can't

00:01:51.209 --> 00:01:51.219 
coming directly towards that you can't

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:55.709 
coming directly towards that you can't
just<00:01:51.429> have<00:01:51.579> it<00:01:51.780> coming<00:01:52.780> like<00:01:54.179> like<00:01:55.179> this<00:01:55.360> on<00:01:55.569> it

00:01:55.709 --> 00:01:55.719 
just have it coming like like this on it

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:57.380 
just have it coming like like this on it
because<00:01:56.049> that<00:01:56.409> won't<00:01:56.530> work<00:01:56.739> it's<00:01:56.979> got<00:01:57.099> to<00:01:57.219> be

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
because that won't work it's got to be

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.639 
because that won't work it's got to be
going<00:01:58.390> straight<00:01:59.140> towards<00:01:59.319> it<00:01:59.679> like<00:02:00.009> that<00:02:00.629> and

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
going straight towards it like that and

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.800 
going straight towards it like that and
now<00:02:02.649> that's<00:02:03.310> unless<00:02:03.939> that<00:02:04.119> done<00:02:04.360> it<00:02:04.689> was

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
now that's unless that done it was
