he's<00:01:54.240> going<00:01:54.360> to<00:01:54.450> try<00:01:54.630> and<00:01:54.660> knock<00:01:54.870> him<00:01:55.050> out<00:01:55.140> and

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:55.410 
he's going to try and knock him out and

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:56.990 
he's going to try and knock him out and
now<00:01:55.470> paki<00:01:56.070> I'll<00:01:56.160> be<00:01:56.280> expecting<00:01:56.550> him<00:01:56.790> to<00:01:56.850> do

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
now paki I'll be expecting him to do

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.900 
now paki I'll be expecting him to do
that<00:01:57.180> and<00:01:57.390> then<00:01:57.720> he'll<00:01:57.900> box<00:01:58.670> maybe<00:01:59.670> he's

00:01:59.900 --> 00:01:59.910 
that and then he'll box maybe he's

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:02.090 
that and then he'll box maybe he's
trading<00:02:00.450> on<00:02:00.600> his<00:02:00.840> on<00:02:01.110> his<00:02:01.170> credibility<00:02:01.950> there

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
trading on his on his credibility there

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.950 
trading on his on his credibility there
but<00:02:02.550> if<00:02:02.670> he's<00:02:02.790> serious<00:02:03.000> about<00:02:03.330> gunning<00:02:03.750> for<00:02:03.930> a

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
but if he's serious about gunning for a

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.450 
but if he's serious about gunning for a
knockout<00:02:04.320> how<00:02:04.680> can<00:02:04.860> it<00:02:04.950> not<00:02:04.979> be<00:02:05.100> a<00:02:05.250> great

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
knockout how can it not be a great

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.260 
knockout how can it not be a great
question<00:02:05.670> what<00:02:06.270> is<00:02:06.390> your<00:02:06.540> prediction<00:02:06.950> I<00:02:08.270> would

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
question what is your prediction I would

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:15.530 
question what is your prediction I would
say<00:02:09.509> that<00:02:09.619> the<00:02:10.619> most<00:02:12.200> likely<00:02:13.200> outcome<00:02:13.410> I<00:02:14.540> think

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
say that the most likely outcome I think

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.810 
say that the most likely outcome I think
would<00:02:15.720> be<00:02:15.870> maybe<00:02:16.830> Bradley<00:02:17.220> this<00:02:17.580> time

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
would be maybe Bradley this time

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:19.160 
would be maybe Bradley this time
actually<00:02:18.060> deserves<00:02:18.600> to<00:02:18.780> win<00:02:18.900> but<00:02:19.050> the

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
actually deserves to win but the

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.040 
actually deserves to win but the
decision<00:02:19.410> goes<00:02:19.709> to<00:02:19.830> pack<00:02:20.040> yeah<00:02:20.900> thank<00:02:21.900> you
