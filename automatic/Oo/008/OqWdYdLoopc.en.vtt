 These two nails are chatted in 12 languages ​​in the same way as 8 dekopin 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:41.610
 In pounding and little finger extended this sound 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:45.630
 I say stick is body conscious and the sound of the meandering floor 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:52.890
 It's I is not made to sound 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:57.240
 I often write out my hand at nail atac when I first get relatively high 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.740
 I I'll be affair coat that say result in the same kind of movement as

 To say the same motion as this if it is pulled pretend say to sweat in no good doing a nail Rutte 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:11.360
 What 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:15.200
 It is not the purpose of freeing to move in the first place this movement swinging yeah 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:20.720
 So operating Nuku also pretend when you go wanna Naylor 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:23.500
 Enter No but you're good anywhere or was a body or was a hole in the body toward the here 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:27.560
 Please have your news straight iron eyes 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:29.300
 Deli I said mute and leave it 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.960
 A street in between 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.960
 Narazu day 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:35.460
 For example in the feeling 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:39.420
 Good 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:42.799
 You will hear a type of noise while playing this 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.799
 In the sense of 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:49.530
 I'm going to put in a 1 of 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:56.750
 Depending on whether the sound after this is extended or cut off 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:56.750
 It has changed a place called or continue pressing whether you release the Well finger 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:02.460
 car 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.460
 Well this is already a song of praise Bleach 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:11.020
 One-shot eyes I am here is that it places to turn off the sound Nde I'm 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:14.230
 Well we are to remain pressing 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:19.830
 Until the next forefinger upstroke 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:19.830
 The leave and you keep off sound it in the next spaced 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:25.300
 By Do I have extended the 1 that 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:28.810
 The finger as soon put the attack sound of 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:32.440
 To extend the sound float a little 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:36.880
 Please don't ask me how to make it float 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:42.160
 There is no choice but to repeat trial and error and learn with your finger and sense 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:43.240
 Anyway firmly remember was hammered to the finger to say Rutte become such behavior 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.290
 I want to receive 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:49.470
 Definitely this one 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:51.620
 That Tteyuu What about running if Te at the time but put Taku 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:57.920
 Often asked 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:03:00.180
 Of course this is a movement that moves straight toward the body as I said before 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:05.040
 It will not be a disadvantage 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:09.989
 It 's a totally different action from this kind of movement like a stroke 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:10.859
 Since So if this kind do in I poised the hand toward the guitar to day make here 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:15.510
 Like this 

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:19.849
 It should be like this The palm should be pointing straight towards the body 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.849
 Do not move almost one of its palm 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:29.150
 Only this is fine I have to do with the Nankai old attachment I have to do the guitar strings from above 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:33.470
 You don't need to stand up to stroke or something like that 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:37.340
 Even though there before and after the play things like turn a little arm 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:40.050
 Basically the position of the back of the palm is fine as it is 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:45.870
 Between this short span 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:48.870
 Let 's snap firmly between short distance and speed up with attack 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:51.180
 Let's look at it from above 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:53.069
 It is a guitarist's eyes, yes 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:57.810
 It is such a thing 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:59.900
 The finger drops straight toward the body 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.810
 Do not swing 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:04.900
 Don't shake 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:08.680
 The position of the hand is not here a 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:13.420
 Let your wrists go a little and accelerate your fingertips 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:16.379
 I hit the body firmly with my little finger and I will put in Aichi a bit lower too 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:16.379
 a Only this 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:26.539
 Of the nail 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:27.860
 Put the hit aimed at the 12 hotels in or say this or say that belly will enter a little familiar 

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:31.580
 But this is already 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:35.710
 It is not only I am in knocked in a team Pu practice 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:42.640
 Even if it is trying to force in a song 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:46.840
 Somewhat blurred that the arm before and after the movement agricultural policy to begin established a movement of Remember When where finger the flow of the song 

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:50.980
 Although there is a basic movement, this is enough 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:53.310
 Don't shake it big, but put it together compactly, quickly and quickly 

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:53.310
 Let's go 

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:56.639
 wh 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:08.290
 me 

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:08.980
 I feel like this, but I have a small hand, but I shake a lot 

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:13.150
 Hmm 

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:18.430
 That's why I said no such thing, but I saw no acclaimed sound guitar play 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:24.910
 When I was there that person had a big hand and I almost carved it here and I felt like it was from the neck 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:27.910
 You will Irasshai for only egg house I Etsu or stroke all of the strings with only this finger 

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:32.380
 It's hard to get to a professor of yeah, though 

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:34.300
 That is, the mail in some of these things is such because large operations when driving a tag 

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:36.169
 Is not necessary at all 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:39.409
 On the spot 

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:42.870
 Firmly in place without moving it prima facie low brain high 

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:48.810
 Of course no power but no good 

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:55.110
 Oita leave the snap small snap of the wrist firmly to speed accelerated up to the fingertips 

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:59.010
 Principles of applying this principle will be the basis of Naylor type 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:06:02.030
 Thank you very much thank you in the comments section to mule Well I had pointed out 

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:02.030
