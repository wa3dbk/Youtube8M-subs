to get them sharpened but with this tool

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.490 
to get them sharpened but with this tool
it<00:00:23.699> is<00:00:23.760> absolutely<00:00:24.330> amazingly<00:00:24.960> easy<00:00:25.320> to

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
it is absolutely amazingly easy to

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.250 
it is absolutely amazingly easy to
sharpen<00:00:25.800> the<00:00:26.039> sharpen<00:00:26.760> a<00:00:26.820> knife<00:00:26.849> on<00:00:27.750> the<00:00:28.019> front

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
sharpen the sharpen a knife on the front

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.070 
sharpen the sharpen a knife on the front
here<00:00:28.500> you've<00:00:29.189> got<00:00:29.460> different<00:00:30.119> angles<00:00:30.900> that

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
here you've got different angles that

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.979 
here you've got different angles that
you<00:00:31.140> can<00:00:31.320> actually<00:00:31.439> set<00:00:31.830> the<00:00:31.859> blade<00:00:32.219> to<00:00:32.989> so

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
you can actually set the blade to so

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.780 
you can actually set the blade to so
when<00:00:34.380> we're<00:00:34.530> using<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:34.800> machete<00:00:35.070> we<00:00:35.489> put<00:00:35.670> on

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
when we're using the machete we put on

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.310 
when we're using the machete we put on
the<00:00:35.880> sharper<00:00:36.239> angle<00:00:36.480> because<00:00:36.719> obviously<00:00:36.870> the

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
the sharper angle because obviously the

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.280 
the sharper angle because obviously the
machetes<00:00:37.980> got<00:00:38.190> less<00:00:38.940> of<00:00:39.120> a<00:00:39.239> feathered<00:00:40.020> point

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
machetes got less of a feathered point

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.990 
machetes got less of a feathered point
so<00:00:40.469> it<00:00:40.530> doesn't<00:00:40.770> blunders<00:00:41.070> quick<00:00:41.280> and<00:00:41.879> then

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
so it doesn't blunders quick and then

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.670 
so it doesn't blunders quick and then
right<00:00:42.180> through<00:00:42.210> to<00:00:42.840> a<00:00:42.899> fishing<00:00:43.260> film<00:00:43.500> building

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
right through to a fishing film building

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
me you can personally flatten the thing

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.090 
me you can personally flatten the thing
right<00:00:46.559> out<00:00:46.910> set<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.090> angle<00:00:48.739> set<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:49.890> pitch

little altar at the side there and
straight<00:00:55.230> away<00:00:55.320> your<00:00:55.469> knife<00:00:55.500> can<00:00:56.399> just<00:00:56.550> get

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
straight away your knife can just get

straight away your knife can just get
pulled<00:00:56.879> through<00:00:57.180> at<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.510> appropriate<00:00:57.899> angle

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
pulled through at the appropriate angle

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.959 
pulled through at the appropriate angle
we'll<00:00:58.829> start<00:00:59.070> with<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.309> outdoor<00:00:59.609> series<00:00:59.969> one

we'll start with the outdoor series one
and<00:01:02.969> it<00:01:03.899> really<00:01:04.140> is<00:01:04.320> just<00:01:04.409> a<00:01:04.559> matter<00:01:06.500> putting

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
and it really is just a matter putting

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.850 
and it really is just a matter putting
it<00:01:07.590> into<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:07.890> Vice<00:01:09.320> setting<00:01:10.320> your<00:01:10.439> angle<00:01:10.710> so

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
it into the Vice setting your angle so

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.160 
it into the Vice setting your angle so
your<00:01:11.010> blades<00:01:11.299> this<00:01:12.299> is<00:01:12.450> sitting<00:01:12.689> Sally<00:01:12.930> for

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
your blades this is sitting Sally for

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.690 
your blades this is sitting Sally for
fairly<00:01:13.470> flat<00:01:13.710> so<00:01:13.920> we<00:01:14.010> need<00:01:14.159> to<00:01:14.220> whip<00:01:14.340> this<00:01:14.460> down

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
fairly flat so we need to whip this down

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:21.360 
fairly flat so we need to whip this down
just<00:01:14.939> a<00:01:15.000> little<00:01:15.030> bit<00:01:15.240> more

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060 
now we've got a about a 17 degree angle

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.850 
now we've got a about a 17 degree angle
on<00:01:26.090> this<00:01:26.270> one<00:01:26.650> we<00:01:27.650> set<00:01:27.920> that<00:01:28.870> all<00:01:29.870> we<00:01:29.990> do<00:01:30.170> is

little bit more on that one we've
actually<00:01:33.680> got<00:01:33.950> two<00:01:34.310> angles<00:01:35.270> on<00:01:35.420> that<00:01:36.280> so<00:01:37.280> and

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:49.400 
take the knife out of the vise once you

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.250 
take the knife out of the vise once you
sit<00:01:49.580> a<00:01:49.610> knife<00:01:49.760> in<00:01:49.940> the<00:01:50.000> vise<00:01:50.180> that<00:01:50.690> gives<00:01:50.990> you

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
to do most of them you have to pull the

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.450 
to do most of them you have to pull the
