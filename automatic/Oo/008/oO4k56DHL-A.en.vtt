00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.550
 i 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:21.320
 Exercise number 40 press inclined on 

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:24.770
 multi power for pectoral then like 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:26.119
 its name indicates inclined press the 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:28.160
 bank is inclined more or less to about 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:30.050
 45 degrees 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.820
 there is no inclination in which it is 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.370
 well and another inclination where you no longer 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.260
 you can work with different 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:39.320
 inclinations of the bank and we'll be 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:41.750
 involving mainly fibers of the 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:44.170
 pectoral at a low height with which 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:46.610
 to give one in general an adequate 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:50.710
 variety to work you can work with 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:50.710
 different inclinations in general 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:59.059
 the guided power machine has this bar 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:00.620
 and you have to take it out for it normally 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:02.629
 and what to do in that turn of the wrist that has 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.489
 seen that she has done in the pressure 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:07.700
 inclined the bar 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:09.910
 when it reaches the body it is at the height of 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:13.880
 the upper part of an electoral ceiling 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:16.100
 between 234 centimeters in which it is 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.690
 good without problems from the top 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:21.020
 up to the little eyebrow of the clavicle 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:22.430
 we try not to go over the 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.070
 clavicle 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:27.680
 the bar does not come to rest in the body 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.330
 when we arrived we went down 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.020
 as always accompanying taking air 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:34.040
 we throw up as always 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.310
 accompanying the movement and without forcing 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.600
 the co2 in giving him a sharp blow at the end 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:42.100
 taking work as we said 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.100
 spinning there leaves up 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.060
 and keeping the elbows away from 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.020
 trunk that bring us closer to the trunk and without 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.590
 exaggerate 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.590
 upwards 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.770
 the next exercise 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:01:59.909
 number 41 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:06.180
 in this exercise we are going to go down in 

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:06.180
 first place a little the bar 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:13.439
 one thing that I recommend you here for 

00:02:10.829 --> 00:02:16.290
 leave hands at the same distance in 

00:02:13.439 --> 00:02:17.790
 both sides is that you go with the slot 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.310
 that you will usually find in 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:23.189
 all the bars and put there the 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:25.200
 places from there when they called 

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:29.470
 the distance that leaves thumbs 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:32.720
 and then I recommend that the thumbs 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:36.220
 for dolls feeling a lot 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.220
 safety thumbs 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:43.760
 in this way two elongated remains is 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.830
 also more very important distance that 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:49.280
 the ship stays in the center of the 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:53.830
 machine when lowering the bar we have it 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.830
 place in the central part of the pectoral 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:05.239
 we realize that here I would be 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:08.099
 too low then we leave the bar 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:10.079
 at that time we check again 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:11.790
 we have two ways to correct it or 

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:13.200
 we lower the body as she has done in 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.180
 that position you are comfortable 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.760
 perfect and if you feel that in that 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.530
 position with the bank you carry all the 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.569
 Bank 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:24.000
 and I would not agree well 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:25.830
 said that when performing the exercise the 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.630
 bar rests on the body arrives 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:29.880
 just about two fingers before taking the 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:32.220
 body just before touching us what 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.780
 We carry up accompanying the 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.120
 movement very well catching to go down 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.220
 pulling up without forcing the games to 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:43.480
 final 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:47.260
 and the next exercise we go over the 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:49.959
 Exercise number 42 with the press of 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:52.360
 clint ado multi to see you can do it 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:53.860
 in various ways in some gyms in 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:55.950
 some clubs are going to find banks 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:58.540
 that are declined is to say that they are 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:00.609
 tilted down 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:02.739
 and in others you will find banks 

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:04.540
 because they can not do it the way 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:08.140
 solve that is putting for example 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:11.190
 some discs just below 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:11.190
 the foot of the bank 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:17.850
 yes 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:20.310
 The way to do this is by placing as you 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:23.550
 he said some discs under the foot of 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:25.230
 bank you have to make sure that you 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:27.870
 is well insured not to run 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:30.840
 no risk in this way the bank will 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:33.330
 would be already declined you can click 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:37.050
 as many discs as you want to search 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:39.810
 different bank declines to 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:41.880
 same as in the exercise of the typical 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:45.180
 backgrounds in parallel or press 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:47.820
 declined on machine I do not recommend either 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:49.020
 do it to the girls according everything 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:51.110
 that is determined and that they look for 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:54.000
 work preferably in the part 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:57.880
 bottom of the breastplate we will leave for 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:01.050
 the guys in this case the bar 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:03.120
 until the body have to 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:07.020
 head towards the bottom of the 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:09.930
 pectoral in this position is very possible 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:13.199
 that the curvature of the lower back 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:16.470
 causes in community that is solved 

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:18.960
 taking the challenges of the bank 

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:22.650
 in the air even to flex 'not the 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:25.229
 knees up in this way from 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:27.300
 from there it would be again to carry 

00:05:25.229 --> 00:05:29.520
 as we said so much for the 40th 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:32.490
 that for the 41 carry a bar 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:34.560
 Directional body accompanying the 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:37.139
 movement exactly the same and without 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:40.280
 block the elbows up taking the go 

00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:40.280
 down giving up 

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:55.600
 and
