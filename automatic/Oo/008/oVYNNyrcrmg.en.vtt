00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:13.099
 in this practice data of the 

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:17.750
 number of hospital beds in Spain 

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:19.430
 from 1993 until 2008 and 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:22.410
 proposes the calculation of the indices 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:25.500
 simple using this series 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:28.980
 first we will calculate the index 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:31.020
 simple using as a base period the 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.360
 first period of the series ie the 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:37.330
 year 93 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:39.390
 to calculate with that simple we should 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:44.410
 divide 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:46.780
 the data of the series in each period / 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:50.590
 the data of the series in the base period 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:53.920
 that is to say in this case the year 93 the series 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:55.690
 is worth 407 as the denominator will remain 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.770
 constant throughout the series we 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:03.620
 we fix with efe 4 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.620
 and finally multiply by 100 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.210
 once the formula for the 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.850
 first value we can copy it by placing 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.680
 the cursor in the lower right corner 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.950
 chopping and dragging for the rest of 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.950
 the Serie 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:22.869
 these simple indices should be interpreted 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:25.659
 always depending on the base period and 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:27.830
 taking the value 100 as a reference 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:31.330
 example 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:33.620
 the data 85 corresponding to the year 2003 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:37.670
 would indicate that the number of beds 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:40.550
 Hospitals in 2003 is 15% 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:45.250
 lower than in the base period 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:45.250
 that is to say in the year 1993 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:52.140
 next we calculate the series 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.780
 index numbers but taking as a period 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:58.190
 basis for example the last period of the 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.190
 series the year 2008 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:04.869
 will be calculated again by dividing the 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:07.860
 value of the series in each period between 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:12.870
 the value of the series in the base period 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:17.280
 year 2008 that we will set with efe 4 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.280
 finally multiply by 100 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:23.700
 calculating the simple inces for the 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:26.390
 first data we can copy 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.430
 for the rest of the series 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.260
 in this case these values ​​should 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:33.920
 interpreted according to the base period 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:36.620
 which is the year 2008 for example this 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:42.260
 value tells us that the number of beds 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:44.660
 Hospitals in the year 1996 is 8.5 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:48.640
 percent higher than the number of beds 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.640
 Hospitals in the year 2008
