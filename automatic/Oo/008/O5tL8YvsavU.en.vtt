00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:05.950
 this part of me I saw it and we're going to 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:08.979
 present one that good we have to 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.900
 give you that context you know that if 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:13.570
 we got to be stopped somewhere 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:17.350
 wrong or we get to do something wrong in 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:19.750
 our vehicle as it can drag 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.159
 take the crane you say exactly 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.140
 You can take the crane 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:25.479
 they drag you to the corralón and 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:29.350
 all this and good that is what happens 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:30.880
 Now that 's the normal part of the 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.229
 part that does not work is that these 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.490
 Lords of the cranes take your 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:37.750
 vehicle with the parking brake applied 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.429
 attention that they are giving me I saw it and 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.939
 let's hear how it is that like this 

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:41.939
 vehicle 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.530
 Good Morning 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.840
 this is a warning to the authorities 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:53.320
 of the df government 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:55.840
 This car is brought dragging from San 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:58.320
 Jerónimo was where I came across 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.990
 this crane 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.150
 we are already at the height of silversmiths I do not 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:06.360
 I know if these areas correspond to these 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:09.479
 between the car to this crane because good 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:13.260
 Well, I think that it does not correspond 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:16.680
 an end and who knows because he will know 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.630
 say what it is that the car does not 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.750
 they bring dragging from there with the 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:24.810
 brake the handbrake already smells like 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.820
 burnt and the tires that you owe 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.430
 put to prevent the cars from 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:31.820
 damage because they are there instead of 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.820
 ornament 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:37.489
 it's a crane 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:40.740
 the complaint that we have with our 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:43.430

 to see how these guys work 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:51.700
 that I think we've all had 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.750
 experiences with them and they are really 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.150
 disgusting 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:58.640
 So, well, I do not want to 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:01.850
 bitter them on Monday 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:04.910
