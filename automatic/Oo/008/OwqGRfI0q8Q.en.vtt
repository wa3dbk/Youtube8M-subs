with<00:01:03.030> these<00:01:03.149> categories<00:01:03.780> can't<00:01:04.080> we<00:01:04.170> get<00:01:04.260> a

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
with these categories can't we get a

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.380 
with these categories can't we get a
real<00:01:04.559> list<00:01:04.890> but<00:01:05.489> I<00:01:05.909> mean<00:01:06.180> what's<00:01:06.299> the

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
real list but I mean what's the

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.520 
real list but I mean what's the
difference<00:01:06.659> between<00:01:06.720> Atari<00:01:07.439> arcade

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
difference between Atari arcade

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.950 
difference between Atari arcade
originals<00:01:08.220> and<00:01:08.460> at<00:01:08.820> home<00:01:08.970> yeah<00:01:09.600> they<00:01:09.780> have

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
originals and at home yeah they have

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.750 
originals and at home yeah they have
this<00:01:10.049> little<00:01:10.200> list<00:01:10.470> here<00:01:10.530> but<00:01:10.860> yeah<00:01:11.100> it's<00:01:11.610> all

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
this little list here but yeah it's all

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.640 
this little list here but yeah it's all
smushed<00:01:12.030> together<00:01:12.150> and<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:12.900> font<00:01:13.170> blends<00:01:13.439> in

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
smushed together and the font blends in

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.679 
smushed together and the font blends in
and<00:01:13.890> you<00:01:14.010> can<00:01:14.159> barely<00:01:14.490> see<00:01:14.880> anything<00:01:15.299> on<00:01:15.570> the

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
and you can barely see anything on the

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.050 
and you can barely see anything on the
screen

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060 
screen

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.789 
screen
why<00:01:18.060> you<00:01:18.119> ask<00:01:18.570> it<00:01:18.659> looks<00:01:18.810> fine<00:01:19.049> now<00:01:19.110> well

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
why you ask it looks fine now well

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.560 
why you ask it looks fine now well
that's<00:01:20.070> because<00:01:20.189> it's<00:01:20.460> usually<00:01:20.670> an<00:01:20.970> array<00:01:21.210> now

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
that's because it's usually an array now

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.690 
that's because it's usually an array now
you<00:01:22.500> may<00:01:22.680> be<00:01:22.710> thinking<00:01:23.009> all<00:01:23.400> right<00:01:23.430> it's<00:01:23.640> just

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
you may be thinking all right it's just

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.940 
you may be thinking all right it's just
a<00:01:23.880> menu<00:01:24.090> it<00:01:24.270> can't<00:01:24.450> be<00:01:24.540> that<00:01:24.570> bad<00:01:25.020> well<00:01:25.439> no<00:01:25.619> it's

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
a menu it can't be that bad well no it's

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.940 
a menu it can't be that bad well no it's
that<00:01:26.250> bad<00:01:27.140> see<00:01:28.140> how<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.320> screen<00:01:28.710> just<00:01:28.860> went

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
that bad see how the screen just went

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.310 
that bad see how the screen just went
black<00:01:29.250> when<00:01:29.400> I<00:01:29.460> went<00:01:29.610> to<00:01:29.640> start<00:01:29.909> that<00:01:30.060> game

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
black when I went to start that game

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.440 
black when I went to start that game
that's<00:01:31.320> because<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:31.799> menu<00:01:32.159> alone<00:01:32.549> crashed<00:01:33.210> on

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
that's because the menu alone crashed on

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.310 
that's because the menu alone crashed on
me<00:01:33.600> on<00:01:34.200> 13<00:01:34.950> separate<00:01:35.579> occasions<00:01:36.180> just<00:01:36.810> when

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320

story<00:01:44.130> but<00:01:44.670> no<00:01:44.820> this<00:01:45.060> menu<00:01:45.360> crashed<00:01:45.720> 13<00:01:46.530> times

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:47.299 
story but no this menu crashed 13 times

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:50.090 
story but no this menu crashed 13 times
power<00:01:48.299> it<00:01:48.659> took<00:01:48.840> to<00:01:48.990> capture<00:01:49.350> this<00:01:49.470> footage<00:01:49.799> I

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
power it took to capture this footage I

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.310 
power it took to capture this footage I
had<00:01:50.430> to<00:01:50.549> reboot<00:01:50.939> that<00:01:51.299> many<00:01:51.570> times<00:01:51.810> because

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
had to reboot that many times because

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.550 
had to reboot that many times because
like<00:01:53.009> this<00:01:53.369> game<00:01:53.640> couldn't<00:01:53.909> handle<00:01:54.299> it<00:01:54.560> and

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560
