00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:09.799
 and a lot of boys want to go here 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:12.680
 be blacks we are back in another 

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:15.260
 episode of clash of clans boys today 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:17.090
 I wanted to revise no trollate no 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.710
 none of what you saw 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:21.140
 come now no impossible challenges because 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:23.630
 these will arrive soon tomorrow 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:26.120
 and the day after tomorrow kids see you today 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:28.369
 which is often understood in garments 

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:30.470
 clan wars and are things they do 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:33.050
 really many cash what he does 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:36.440
 pissed off in call of france well let's see 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:38.899
 together an attack made one or more 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:43.340
 attacks made by one of the leaders 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:46.790
 clan boss of our bob 88 clan that is 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:49.610
 in my opinion it was really impeccable 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:53.450
 but unfortunately the game sometimes 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:57.020
 however, he tends to do everything to get you 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:59.750
 lose then and then we leave immediately 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:01.520
 we live this attack which in my opinion is 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.710
 was really really very nice 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:06.740
 the attack made with wild boars e 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:10.609
 I remember the bobo boars were 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:15.289
 all at the most have gone through 40 

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:19.759
 wild boars and 40 archers 4 care potions 

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:21.259
 a fury and the barbaric ward 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:23.929
 so let's start immediately with 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:27.619
 this attack's castle troops 

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:30.439
 new that he did during the war 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:34.710
 then we immediately see how to positioned 

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:36.960
 the how defenses are positioned we have 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.270
 after it starts with just one 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.310
 wild boar from above and it is done 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.530
 practically explode in less than two 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.300
 second part with the second this is the 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.000
 classic tactic that you use 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:51.290
 normally to let out all the 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.880
 troops of the castle because once 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:56.670
 then eliminated we can then proceed 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.430
 releases the archers continues however to 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:02.790
 release a third boar to do 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.350
 exit all suits completely 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.690
 troops remained alternate castle in fact 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.729
 let's see there are some sgarro some 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:11.550
 archer and especially the main ones that go 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:15.390
 get rid of immediately with the archers a little 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:19.260
 scattered then release thirty or 40 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:22.140
 arch and excuse 40 boars all there 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.720
 immediately makes the first defenses out e 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:27.090
 obviously there is the barbarian king there who 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.820
 he breaks his cock but he slams it 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:32.160
 highly leaves a potion cure one 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:34.980
 fury is the right time for 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.720
 destroy all of Africa 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.950
 the central part of the village defended 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.130
 central of the village 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.740
 here we see the fawn of that stinky yes 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:45.980
 takes one 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:49.610
 a giant bomb instantly and make itself 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:51.530
 out practically 45 wild boars but if they do 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:54.770
 slams another cure potion and goes on 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:57.590
 healthy leap skip one boar not 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:59.750
 it is important to release some archer e 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:02.350
 especially hammers behind that begin 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:05.390
 to blow up the whole village 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:07.790
 outside and in the meantime ours 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:09.950
 wild boar continue to attack one 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:12.500
 stuff that you don't believe in store and barbaric 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:14.750
 which is still standing because logically 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:17.240
 our boars are going to attack 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:20.420
 all defenses and then finally you will go 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:24.140
 sticking to the barbarian king, however, is a nice thing 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:25.670
 fucking problem because he goes to ad 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.890
 knock down all our boar 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:30.800
 meanwhile our troops out of the 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:32.360
 castle are razed to the ground 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:35.690
 pretty much everything left 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:37.700
 but unfortunately a minute remained of what 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:40.670
 then a minute to write down 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:42.770
 we all have only one tower the king 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:46.240
 barbaric that will make us lose a lot 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:49.550
 time and fortunately have remained a 

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:51.560
 maghetto up there is an archer who 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:56.680
 continue to destroy the advance of 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:58.970
 barbarian king below is quiet though 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.560
 logically fury has already been used 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:04.160
 of the barbarian king because we used it 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:08.330
 at the beginning we have destruction 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:10.250
 of the tower at 10 and the tesla that 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:13.730
 practically kills everyone in the 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:15.830
 meanwhile and only a few remain 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:17.870
 archer with some magician with the king 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:20.359
 barbaric opponent who still 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:23.360
 here goes if it finally goes away then 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:27.980
 4 May the 4 5 mag left with which the 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:29.480
 we are 95 percent in jail and missing 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:32.090
 five seconds 

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:36.080
 then now I bomb the bad luck from 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:36.890
 madonna bomb and bovo concludes with 98 for 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.900
 one hundred 

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:41.930
 well something that pisses me off that 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:45.080
 if you do 98 percent , it's two 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:47.090
 stars and three quarters 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:52.580
 ok it can't be one 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:55.340
 stella so I say to the super put 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:59.270
 at least change the meaning of these 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:05:02.630
 stars given three stars chosen percent 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:05.660
 two stars if you logically pass 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:07.940
 maybe 75 percent eighty for 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:09.889
 hundred because it is not even possible for 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:11.870
 who does an attack maybe we see in 

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:14.780
 this time another attack always 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:18.860
 made with bob 88 wild boar that if 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:21.410
 it is at least a 60 percent 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:24.770
 70 percent without even beating down 

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:27.530
 the town hall we are left with a 70 for 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:29.300
 a hundred more then half a lot more 

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:31.790
 by half and we didn't even do it 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:35.720
 so two stars are things they do 

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:37.729
 enough to piss off and how you can 

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:41.300
 see at this very moment the same 

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:43.700
 bovo tactic with fury forces e 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:45.190
 anything else wild boars in the middle that 

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:47.750
 they throw down all the defenses 

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:50.240
 unfortunately, here we have a small one 

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:51.860
 there is also the Reggina difference 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:53.870
 he does not come 

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:56.360
 let's say statue was a big problem 

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:58.879
 why why our monkeys read 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:01.000
 get hit by the queen e 

00:05:58.879 --> 00:06:03.729
 at the same time we have henchmen e 

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.469
 skeletons that break the boxes 

00:06:03.729 --> 00:06:09.050
 meanwhile we have ours 

00:06:06.469 --> 00:06:12.520
 mops on the outside are still jumping 

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:15.740
 wild boar that was not an attack 

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:18.830
 let's say ugly but was unlucky in 

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:20.840
 this case boffo because learned is more 

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:22.819
 of a trap and moreover there was the 

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:25.159
 reggina who gave a lot of trouble 

00:06:22.819 --> 00:06:27.229
 however in the meantime we have re 

00:06:25.159 --> 00:06:30.199
 barbarian who throws down with fury 

00:06:27.229 --> 00:06:32.449
 several things above 

00:06:30.199 --> 00:06:34.400
 ok take another small bomb but not 

00:06:32.449 --> 00:06:37.490
 it's a problem because our barbarians 

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:39.139
 resist throw down practically everything 

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:41.629
 what there is to vote for one of his but 

00:06:39.139 --> 00:06:43.430
 the reggina continues to break the boxes 

00:06:41.629 --> 00:06:45.650
 and the wizards our little ones instead 

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:48.319
 bet on our queen point to 

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:51.199
 thugs the queen goes back down and 

00:06:48.319 --> 00:06:52.340
 continues to annoy the last 

00:06:51.199 --> 00:06:54.889
 archers left 

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:57.379
 then we have to put down the rest but 

00:06:54.889 --> 00:07:02.719
 physically they are few and they are too much 

00:06:57.379 --> 00:07:04.930
 few archers and time is little and the 

00:07:02.719 --> 00:07:07.590
 queen of archers stays there a 

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:14.190
 watch and finish the cone 

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:14.610
 84 85 87 percent per bovo with only one 

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:17.460
 star 

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:20.580
 well guys this episode ends here 

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:23.760
 if you agree with me on the change 

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:25.650
 at least this logic of the three 

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:27.780
 two-star and one-star stars 

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:30.150
 and put a beautiful and below e 

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:31.920
 commented below in the video I will 

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:32.760
 thank you very much for the vision 

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:34.320
 for everyone 

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:36.270
 don't forget to offer yours 

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:38.250
 village below in the comments that in 

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:41.340
 next episode of impossible challenges 

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:43.800
 I will try to make a challenge to make 

00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:47.030
 a possible impossible challenge and a lot 

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:47.030
 desire for all we are
