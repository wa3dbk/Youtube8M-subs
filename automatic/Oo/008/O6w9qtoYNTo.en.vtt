okay<00:00:01.800> there<00:00:02.010> are<00:00:02.040> four<00:00:02.129> efficiencies<00:00:03.060> that

00:00:03.619 --> 00:00:03.629 
okay there are four efficiencies that

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.489 
okay there are four efficiencies that
are<00:00:04.009> important<00:00:05.009> to<00:00:05.720> engine<00:00:06.720> performance<00:00:07.200> the

00:00:07.489 --> 00:00:07.499 
are important to engine performance the

00:00:07.499 --> 00:00:09.289 
are important to engine performance the
first<00:00:07.769> is<00:00:08.099> the<00:00:08.490> indicated<00:00:09.030> thermal

00:00:09.289 --> 00:00:09.299 
first is the indicated thermal

00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:11.360 
first is the indicated thermal
efficiency<00:00:09.870> and<00:00:10.139> this<00:00:10.320> is<00:00:10.500> the<00:00:10.650> efficiency<00:00:11.160> of

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.339 
efficiency and this is the efficiency of
the<00:00:11.580> thermodynamics<00:00:11.879> cycle<00:00:12.750> that<00:00:12.870> the<00:00:13.049> engine

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
the thermodynamics cycle that the engine

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.510 
the thermodynamics cycle that the engine
is<00:00:13.469> operating<00:00:13.650> on<00:00:15.530> so<00:00:16.530> for<00:00:16.710> most<00:00:16.800> recent<00:00:17.310> Jen's

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
that's four-stroke spark ignition

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.270 
that's four-stroke spark ignition
engines<00:00:19.830> there's<00:00:20.130> just<00:00:20.460> one<00:00:20.610> cycle<00:00:22.250> but<00:00:23.250> the

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:23.280 
engines there's just one cycle but the

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.400 
engines there's just one cycle but the
efficiency<00:00:24.000> of<00:00:24.030> the<00:00:24.150> cycle<00:00:24.630> is<00:00:24.750> a<00:00:24.780> function<00:00:25.230> of

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:26.870 
efficiency of the cycle is a function of
engine<00:00:25.770> speed<00:00:26.040> and<00:00:26.190> load<00:00:26.370> and<00:00:26.580> whether<00:00:26.700> or<00:00:26.820> not

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880

you're<00:00:27.060> using<00:00:27.090> boost<00:00:27.570> and<00:00:27.990> bunch<00:00:28.470> of<00:00:28.590> other

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
you're using boost and bunch of other

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.130 
you're using boost and bunch of other
things

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:30.140

second<00:00:31.140> efficiency<00:00:31.740> is<00:00:31.890> the<00:00:32.070> efficiency<00:00:32.520> of

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
second efficiency is the efficiency of

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.880 
second efficiency is the efficiency of
the<00:00:32.820> combustion<00:00:33.210> process<00:00:33.660> so<00:00:34.410> when<00:00:34.650> you<00:00:34.740> buy

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
the combustion process so when you buy

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.640 
the combustion process so when you buy
fuel<00:00:35.310> you're<00:00:35.850> buying<00:00:36.120> chemical<00:00:37.020> energy<00:00:37.140> and

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:37.650 
fuel you're buying chemical energy and

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:40.370 
fuel you're buying chemical energy and
what<00:00:38.250> you<00:00:38.370> need<00:00:38.520> is<00:00:38.640> thermal<00:00:39.030> energy<00:00:39.420> in<00:00:40.170> the

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:40.380 
what you need is thermal energy in the

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:42.050 
what you need is thermal energy in the
combustion<00:00:40.829> chamber<00:00:41.250> and<00:00:41.280> so<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.730> combustion

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:42.060 
combustion chamber and so the combustion

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:44.390 
combustion chamber and so the combustion
process<00:00:42.650> converts<00:00:43.650> chemical<00:00:43.829> energy<00:00:44.100> to

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:44.400 
process converts chemical energy to

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.860 
process converts chemical energy to
thermal<00:00:44.790> energy<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.570> combustion

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
thermal energy and the combustion

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.140 
thermal energy and the combustion
efficiency<00:00:46.110> is<00:00:46.650> simply<00:00:47.040> a<00:00:47.070> measure<00:00:47.550> of<00:00:47.790> how

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:48.150 
efficiency is simply a measure of how

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:50.900 
efficiency is simply a measure of how
efficiently<00:00:48.720> it<00:00:48.810> does<00:00:49.170> that<00:00:49.610> then<00:00:50.610> we<00:00:50.760> have<00:00:50.850> a

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
efficiently it does that then we have a

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.520 
efficiently it does that then we have a
volumetric<00:00:51.329> efficiency<00:00:51.540> and<00:00:52.230> that's<00:00:52.380> the

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
volumetric efficiency and that's the

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.800 
volumetric efficiency and that's the
effectiveness<00:00:53.070> of<00:00:53.399> inducting<00:00:53.910> air<00:00:54.210> into<00:00:54.720> the

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:54.810 
effectiveness of inducting air into the

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:56.840 
effectiveness of inducting air into the
engine<00:00:55.200> and<00:00:55.410> here<00:00:55.530> I'm<00:00:55.649> using<00:00:55.860> effectiveness

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
engine and here I'm using effectiveness

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.299 
engine and here I'm using effectiveness
because<00:00:57.210> as<00:00:57.750> we<00:00:57.899> learn<00:00:58.110> surely<00:00:58.739> volumetric

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
because as we learn surely volumetric

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.049 
because as we learn surely volumetric
efficiency<00:00:59.520> isn't<00:01:00.270> actually<00:01:00.630> and<00:01:00.750> efficiency

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:02.059 
efficiency isn't actually and efficiency

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:04.369 
efficiency isn't actually and efficiency
and<00:01:03.059> then<00:01:03.180> finally<00:01:03.510> we<00:01:03.600> have<00:01:03.720> the<00:01:03.840> mechanical

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
and then finally we have the mechanical

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.379 
and then finally we have the mechanical
efficiency<00:01:04.589> and<00:01:05.159> that's<00:01:05.219> the<00:01:05.489> efficiency<00:01:06.359> of

00:01:06.379 --> 00:01:06.389 
efficiency and that's the efficiency of

00:01:06.389 --> 00:01:09.050 
efficiency and that's the efficiency of
overcoming<00:01:07.229> frictional<00:01:07.909> parasitic<00:01:08.909> and

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
overcoming frictional parasitic and

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.179 
overcoming frictional parasitic and

and<00:04:19.799> so<00:04:21.139> the<00:04:22.139> people<00:04:22.440> who<00:04:22.529> started<00:04:22.919> generating

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 
and so the people who started generating

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.720 
and so the people who started generating
the<00:04:24.570> onboard<00:04:24.930> computer<00:04:25.349> control

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:25.730 
the onboard computer control

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:27.220 
the onboard computer control
systems<00:04:26.180> started<00:04:26.600> off<00:04:26.720> in<00:04:26.840> the<00:04:26.930> English

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:27.230 
systems started off in the English

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:28.780 
systems started off in the English
system<00:04:27.410> of<00:04:27.650> units<00:04:27.980> and<00:04:28.280> now<00:04:28.580> they've

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:28.790 
system of units and now they've

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:30.640 
system of units and now they've
converted<00:04:29.120> over<00:04:29.450> to<00:04:29.660> the<00:04:29.840> SI<00:04:30.140> system<00:04:30.350> of<00:04:30.590> units

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:30.650 
converted over to the SI system of units

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:33.220 
converted over to the SI system of units
that<00:04:31.010> means<00:04:31.400> that<00:04:31.670> the<00:04:31.730> control<00:04:32.090> systems<00:04:32.600> have

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:33.230 
that means that the control systems have

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:36.580 
that means that the control systems have
a<00:04:33.740> lot<00:04:33.920> of<00:04:34.010> legacy<00:04:34.370> units<00:04:35.060> in<00:04:35.240> them<00:04:35.590> so

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.590 
a lot of legacy units in them so

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:38.950 
a lot of legacy units in them so
there'll<00:04:36.770> be<00:04:36.800> English<00:04:37.330> units<00:04:38.330> or<00:04:38.510> American

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 
there'll be English units or American

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.140 
there'll be English units or American
standard<00:04:39.350> units<00:04:39.680> and<00:04:40.040> also<00:04:40.190> SI<00:04:40.610> units<00:04:40.970> and

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:41.150 
standard units and also SI units and

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.690 
standard units and also SI units and
combinations<00:04:41.780> thereof<00:04:42.230> that's<00:04:43.130> okay<00:04:43.550> because

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:43.700 
combinations thereof that's okay because

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:46.360 
combinations thereof that's okay because
EPA<00:04:44.000> likes<00:04:44.540> to<00:04:44.720> use<00:04:44.930> mixed<00:04:45.350> units<00:04:45.680> like<00:04:45.860> grams

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:46.370 
EPA likes to use mixed units like grams

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:49.120 
EPA likes to use mixed units like grams
per<00:04:46.640> mile<00:04:47.440> but<00:04:48.440> just<00:04:48.620> something<00:04:48.860> you<00:04:48.950> need<00:04:49.040> to

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:49.130 
per mile but just something you need to

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:51.550 
per mile but just something you need to
be<00:04:49.220> aware<00:04:49.490> of
