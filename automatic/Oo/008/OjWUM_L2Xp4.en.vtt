00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:33.360 
despite that when we put the phone side
on<00:00:31.149> like<00:00:31.480> this<00:00:31.719> we<00:00:32.079> can<00:00:32.259> see<00:00:32.500> that<00:00:32.649> the<00:00:32.710> iphone

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:40.270 
point nine millimeters thick so we're

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:42.060 
point nine millimeters thick so we're
looking<00:00:40.600> at<00:00:40.750> a<00:00:40.780> device<00:00:41.230> that's<00:00:41.260> very<00:00:41.830> very

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:47.470 
very very lightweight when we look at

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:49.380 
very very lightweight when we look at
the<00:00:47.590> bottom<00:00:47.950> of<00:00:48.040> the<00:00:48.190> phone<00:00:48.370> check<00:00:48.820> out<00:00:49.030> the

that is a very very nimble thin device

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:56.850 
that is a very very nimble thin device
and<00:00:55.390> when<00:00:55.989> we<00:00:56.079> look<00:00:56.260> at<00:00:56.350> the<00:00:56.470> top<00:00:56.650> of<00:00:56.680> the

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:56.860 
and when we look at the top of the

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:58.979 
and when we look at the top of the
device<00:00:57.130> is<00:00:57.430> worth<00:00:58.030> noting<00:00:58.270> that<00:00:58.540> the<00:00:58.750> power

00:00:58.979 --> 00:00:58.989 
device is worth noting that the power

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:01.350 
device is worth noting that the power
button<00:00:59.290> that<00:00:59.800> was<00:01:00.010> on<00:01:00.190> the<00:01:00.310> top<00:01:00.460> of<00:01:00.610> the<00:01:00.670> 5s<00:01:01.090> is

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:01.360 
button that was on the top of the 5s is

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.389 
button that was on the top of the 5s is
no<00:01:01.540> longer<00:01:01.750> on<00:01:01.989> the<00:01:02.110> top<00:01:02.290> of<00:01:02.410> the<00:01:02.470> six<00:01:02.739> that's

00:01:03.389 --> 00:01:03.399 
no longer on the top of the six that's

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:05.399 
no longer on the top of the six that's
been<00:01:03.579> moved<00:01:03.820> around<00:01:03.910> to<00:01:04.210> the<00:01:04.390> top<00:01:04.809> right-hand

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:05.409 
been moved around to the top right-hand

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:11.249 
been moved around to the top right-hand
edge<00:01:06.159> on<00:01:06.640> the<00:01:07.240> right-hand<00:01:07.720> side<00:01:09.810> so<00:01:10.810> when<00:01:11.170> we

00:01:11.249 --> 00:01:11.259 
edge on the right-hand side so when we

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:13.319 
edge on the right-hand side so when we
look<00:01:11.350> at<00:01:11.469> the<00:01:11.560> two<00:01:11.740> devices<00:01:11.920> side-by-side<00:01:12.819> the

00:01:13.319 --> 00:01:13.329 
look at the two devices side-by-side the

00:01:13.329 --> 00:01:16.109 
look at the two devices side-by-side the
iphone<00:01:13.689> 5s<00:01:14.170> in<00:01:14.439> my<00:01:15.039> opinion<00:01:15.340> is<00:01:15.609> it's<00:01:15.880> perhaps

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:16.119 
iphone 5s in my opinion is it's perhaps

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:20.069 
iphone 5s in my opinion is it's perhaps
actually<00:01:16.719> a<00:01:16.990> nicer<00:01:17.889> looking<00:01:18.310> unit<00:01:18.520> and<00:01:18.899> if<00:01:19.899> we

00:01:20.069 --> 00:01:20.079 
actually a nicer looking unit and if we

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:22.080 
actually a nicer looking unit and if we
look<00:01:20.319> at<00:01:20.499> the<00:01:20.619> iphone<00:01:20.920> 6<00:01:21.159> we<00:01:21.399> can<00:01:21.579> see<00:01:21.819> that<00:01:21.999> the

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.090 
look at the iphone 6 we can see that the

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.419 
look at the iphone 6 we can see that the
protruding<00:01:22.719> camera<00:01:22.749> lens<00:01:23.350> is<00:01:23.709> a<00:01:24.009> little<00:01:24.340> bit

00:01:24.419 --> 00:01:24.429 
protruding camera lens is a little bit

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:26.699 
protruding camera lens is a little bit
awkward<00:01:24.579> if<00:01:25.060> you<00:01:25.810> pop<00:01:26.109> that<00:01:26.139> down<00:01:26.289> on<00:01:26.619> the

00:01:26.699 --> 00:01:26.709 
awkward if you pop that down on the

00:01:26.709 --> 00:01:28.889 
awkward if you pop that down on the
table<00:01:26.920> or<00:01:27.189> any<00:01:27.490> flat<00:01:27.789> surface<00:01:27.999> you're<00:01:28.749> going

00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:28.899 
table or any flat surface you're going

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:30.840 
table or any flat surface you're going
to<00:01:28.990> see<00:01:29.139> a<00:01:29.170> little<00:01:29.409> bit<00:01:29.530> of<00:01:29.590> a<00:01:29.709> wobble<00:01:29.859> so

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:30.850 
to see a little bit of a wobble so

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.300 
to see a little bit of a wobble so
really<00:01:31.209> a<00:01:31.389> case<00:01:31.899> is<00:01:32.200> advisable<00:01:32.889> but<00:01:33.159> then

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.310 
really a case is advisable but then

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.340 
really a case is advisable but then
again<00:01:33.429> I<00:01:33.819> suppose<00:01:34.179> if<00:01:34.689> you're<00:01:34.840> going<00:01:35.020> to<00:01:35.109> carry

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 
again I suppose if you're going to carry

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.019 
again I suppose if you're going to carry
around<00:01:35.499> an<00:01:35.859> expensive<00:01:36.399> gadget<00:01:36.729> like<00:01:36.819> that<00:01:36.999> a

00:01:37.019 --> 00:01:37.029 
around an expensive gadget like that a

00:01:37.029 --> 00:01:43.260 
around an expensive gadget like that a
case<00:01:37.389> is<00:01:37.600> a<00:01:37.630> good<00:01:37.899> idea<00:01:38.159> regardless<00:01:42.270> again

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
case is a good idea regardless again

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.269 
case is a good idea regardless again
side<00:01:43.719> by<00:01:43.869> side<00:01:44.139> we<00:01:44.350> can<00:01:44.499> see<00:01:44.529> the<00:01:44.829> obvious

00:01:45.269 --> 00:01:45.279 
side by side we can see the obvious

00:01:45.279 --> 00:01:47.940 
side by side we can see the obvious
difference<00:01:46.149> in<00:01:46.389> handset<00:01:46.929> size<00:01:47.170> and<00:01:47.560> indeed

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
difference in handset size and indeed

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.609 
difference in handset size and indeed
screen<00:01:48.399> size<00:01:48.779> let's<00:01:49.779> fire<00:01:49.990> these<00:01:50.170> phones<00:01:50.439> up

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
screen size let's fire these phones up

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.219 
screen size let's fire these phones up
so<00:01:53.619> again<00:01:53.889> bigger<00:01:54.729> screen<00:01:55.179> you're<00:01:55.869> able<00:01:56.020> to

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:56.229 
so again bigger screen you're able to

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:58.589 
so again bigger screen you're able to
fit<00:01:56.439> more<00:01:56.649> wraps<00:01:57.009> on<00:01:57.279> there<00:01:57.549> you've<00:01:58.389> got

00:01:58.589 --> 00:01:58.599 
fit more wraps on there you've got

00:01:58.599 --> 00:02:01.440 
fit more wraps on there you've got
plenty<00:01:58.929> more<00:01:59.200> room<00:01:59.409> to<00:01:59.590> play<00:01:59.619> with<00:01:59.799> and<00:02:00.450> now

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
plenty more room to play with and now

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:02.969 
plenty more room to play with and now
i'm<00:02:01.659> going<00:02:01.810> to<00:02:01.869> do<00:02:01.959> a<00:02:01.990> little<00:02:02.229> side<00:02:02.560> by<00:02:02.740> side

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:02.979 
i'm going to do a little side by side

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:05.389 
i'm going to do a little side by side
test<00:02:03.310> of<00:02:03.549> switching<00:02:03.969> the<00:02:04.060> phones<00:02:04.299> off

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
test of switching the phones off

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.499 
test of switching the phones off
unfortunately<00:02:06.399> though<00:02:06.609> there's<00:02:06.880> a<00:02:06.939> flaw<00:02:07.329> in

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:07.509 
unfortunately though there's a flaw in

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:09.449 
unfortunately though there's a flaw in
this<00:02:07.659> test<00:02:07.959> we've<00:02:08.229> got<00:02:08.380> two<00:02:08.679> tests<00:02:09.069> happening

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:09.459 
this test we've got two tests happening

simultaneously their picture in picture

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:14.160 
simultaneously their picture in picture
you<00:02:12.069> can't<00:02:12.490> actually<00:02:12.790> see<00:02:13.510> because<00:02:13.840> the

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
you can't actually see because the

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.500 
you can't actually see because the
phone's<00:02:14.470> screen<00:02:14.860> dims<00:02:15.549> so<00:02:16.060> quickly

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
phone's screen dims so quickly

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.050 
phone's screen dims so quickly
immediately<00:02:17.170> you<00:02:17.470> can't<00:02:18.129> see<00:02:18.400> when<00:02:18.610> they<00:02:18.819> cut

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
immediately you can't see when they cut

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.210 
immediately you can't see when they cut
out<00:02:19.269> they<00:02:19.900> both<00:02:20.110> cut<00:02:20.349> out<00:02:20.470> at<00:02:20.620> the<00:02:20.680> same<00:02:20.890> time

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
out they both cut out at the same time

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:22.560 
out they both cut out at the same time
you<00:02:21.430> just<00:02:21.610> have<00:02:21.700> to<00:02:21.760> take<00:02:21.970> my<00:02:22.120> word<00:02:22.150> for<00:02:22.540> that

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:22.570 
you just have to take my word for that

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:25.380 
you just have to take my word for that
and<00:02:22.900> now<00:02:23.710> if<00:02:23.860> we<00:02:23.890> flip<00:02:24.280> the<00:02:24.430> test<00:02:24.670> round<00:02:24.940> and<00:02:25.270> we

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
and now if we flip the test round and we

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.780 
and now if we flip the test round and we
start<00:02:25.690> them<00:02:25.840> both<00:02:26.050> up<00:02:26.260> again<00:02:26.560> again<00:02:27.010> two<00:02:27.310> tests

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
start them both up again again two tests

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.260 
start them both up again again two tests
picture<00:02:28.180> in<00:02:28.330> picture<00:02:28.380> we<00:02:29.380> can<00:02:29.410> see<00:02:29.620> that

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
picture in picture we can see that

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:33.600 
picture in picture we can see that
surprisingly<00:02:31.270> the<00:02:31.840> iphone<00:02:32.200> 5s<00:02:32.740> will<00:02:33.040> actually

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
surprisingly the iphone 5s will actually

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.240 
surprisingly the iphone 5s will actually
start<00:02:33.940> up<00:02:34.210> quicker<00:02:34.660> than<00:02:34.960> the<00:02:35.140> iphone<00:02:35.560> 6<00:02:35.890> and

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
start up quicker than the iphone 6 and

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.000 
start up quicker than the iphone 6 and
that<00:02:36.700> happened<00:02:37.060> in<00:02:37.210> both<00:02:37.480> tests<00:02:38.110> that<00:02:38.830> was<00:02:38.980> a

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
that happened in both tests that was a

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.310 
that happened in both tests that was a
surprise<00:02:39.190> I<00:02:39.730> don't<00:02:40.390> really<00:02:40.780> think<00:02:40.930> anyone's

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:41.320 
surprise I don't really think anyone's

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.410 
surprise I don't really think anyone's
going<00:02:41.470> to<00:02:41.530> lose<00:02:41.740> any<00:02:41.950> sleep<00:02:42.310> over<00:02:42.640> this<00:02:43.090> I

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
going to lose any sleep over this I

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:44.730 
going to lose any sleep over this I
don't<00:02:43.630> think<00:02:43.810> anyone<00:02:44.110> is<00:02:44.200> going<00:02:44.290> to<00:02:44.380> be<00:02:44.500> SAT

don't think anyone is going to be SAT
there<00:02:44.950> sobbing<00:02:45.220> next<00:02:45.610> to<00:02:45.700> a<00:02:45.760> stopwatch<00:02:46.060> but

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
there sobbing next to a stopwatch but

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:50.840 
there sobbing next to a stopwatch but
it's<00:02:47.110> interesting<00:02:47.590> to<00:02:47.950> know<00:02:48.130> nonetheless

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.280 

contrary<00:02:51.850> to<00:02:51.940> this<00:02:52.180> test<00:02:52.480> though<00:02:52.750> I<00:02:52.930> have

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
contrary to this test though I have

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:54.900 
contrary to this test though I have
found<00:02:53.500> that<00:02:53.650> the<00:02:53.800> performance<00:02:54.310> of<00:02:54.400> the<00:02:54.550> iphone

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
found that the performance of the iphone

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:58.410 
found that the performance of the iphone
6<00:02:55.360> is<00:02:56.250> noticeably<00:02:57.250> slicker<00:02:57.730> and<00:02:58.060> more

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
6 is noticeably slicker and more

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.090 
6 is noticeably slicker and more
responsive<00:02:58.630> and<00:02:59.620> more<00:03:00.010> and<00:03:00.370> therefore<00:03:00.750> more

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
responsive and more and therefore more

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:05.940 
responsive and more and therefore more
fun<00:03:03.100> and<00:03:03.400> more<00:03:03.430> kind<00:03:04.209> of<00:03:04.410> productive<00:03:05.410> to<00:03:05.740> use

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
fun and more kind of productive to use

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.790 
fun and more kind of productive to use
than<00:03:06.220> the<00:03:06.250> iphone<00:03:06.640> 5s<00:03:07.260> 5s<00:03:08.260> was<00:03:08.410> great<00:03:08.620> don't
