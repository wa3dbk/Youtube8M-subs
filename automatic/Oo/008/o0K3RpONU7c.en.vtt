the prototype which I'm going to mold
this<00:00:55.860> is<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.070> BOAC<00:00:56.579> Concord<00:00:57.360> right<00:00:57.600> here<00:00:57.840> and

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:00.710 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.860 

it's<00:01:01.710> gonna<00:01:01.829> be<00:01:01.950> powered<00:01:02.280> by<00:01:02.310> two<00:01:02.870> very

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
it's gonna be powered by two very

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:11.290 
it's gonna be powered by two very

retracts

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.090 

I'm<00:01:18.360> sculpting<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:19.080> wings<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.649> best<00:01:19.860> I<00:01:20.040> can

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
I'm sculpting the wings the best I can

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.109 
I'm sculpting the wings the best I can
to<00:01:20.990> match<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.470> actual<00:01:23.039> curvature<00:01:23.520> of<00:01:23.819> the

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
to match the actual curvature of the

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.109 
to match the actual curvature of the
real<00:01:25.250> Conchords<00:01:26.250> wings<00:01:26.490> I<00:01:26.759> don't<00:01:26.910> know<00:01:26.970> if<00:01:27.060> you

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
real Conchords wings I don't know if you

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.660 
real Conchords wings I don't know if you
can<00:01:27.270> see<00:01:27.450> that<00:01:27.600> in<00:01:27.959> these<00:01:28.229> photos<00:01:28.490> in<00:01:29.490> this

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
can see that in these photos in this

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:35.870 
can see that in these photos in this
video<00:01:32.420> but<00:01:33.420> you<00:01:34.069> know<00:01:35.069> basically<00:01:35.459> the<00:01:35.670> wings

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
video but you know basically the wings

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.730 
video but you know basically the wings
are<00:01:36.060> just<00:01:36.090> solid<00:01:36.420> foam<00:01:36.810> i<00:01:37.050> hot-wired<00:01:37.319> the

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
are just solid foam i hot-wired the

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.859 
are just solid foam i hot-wired the
profile<00:01:38.550> of<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.759> airfoil<00:01:39.179> into<00:01:39.569> the<00:01:39.660> wing

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
profile of the airfoil into the wing

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.130 
profile of the airfoil into the wing
then<00:01:40.110> I<00:01:40.200> hot-wired<00:01:40.410> at<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:40.979> leading<00:01:41.280> edge<00:01:41.429> and

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
then I hot-wired at the leading edge and

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.690 
then I hot-wired at the leading edge and
I<00:01:43.140> had<00:01:43.259> to<00:01:43.380> determine<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:43.920> leading<00:01:44.160> edge<00:01:44.340> I

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
I had to determine the leading edge I

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:50.719 
I had to determine the leading edge I
had<00:01:44.880> to<00:01:45.590> determine<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.920> sweep<00:01:47.250> angle<00:01:47.490> and<00:01:49.729> the

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
had to determine the sweep angle and the

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.020 
had to determine the sweep angle and the
incidence<00:01:51.179> of<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.479> wing<00:01:52.459> washout<00:01:53.459> the

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
incidence of the wing washout the

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.910 
incidence of the wing washout the
trailing<00:01:54.509> edge<00:01:54.780> of<00:01:54.990> the<00:01:55.080> leading<00:01:55.259> edge<00:01:55.560> and

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
trailing edge of the leading edge and

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.910 
trailing edge of the leading edge and
it's<00:01:56.550> a<00:01:56.610> very<00:01:56.819> it's<00:01:57.119> a<00:01:57.209> very<00:01:57.390> unique<00:01:57.920> airfoil

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
it's a very it's a very unique airfoil

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.160 
it's a very it's a very unique airfoil
that<00:01:59.190> the<00:01:59.280> concorde<00:01:59.729> has<00:01:59.970> it's<00:02:00.209> a<00:02:00.349> it's<00:02:01.349> a<00:02:01.440> very

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
that the concorde has it's a it's a very

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.020 
that the concorde has it's a it's a very
you<00:02:04.170> know<00:02:04.200> it's<00:02:04.500> it's<00:02:04.709> just<00:02:04.890> it's<00:02:05.220> so<00:02:05.789> it's

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
you know it's it's just it's so it's

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.279 
you know it's it's just it's so it's
very<00:02:06.240> elegant<00:02:06.539> beautiful<00:02:08.869> airfoil<00:02:09.869> to<00:02:10.080> look

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
very elegant beautiful airfoil to look

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.530 
very elegant beautiful airfoil to look
at<00:02:10.500> it's<00:02:11.160> very<00:02:11.250> pleasing<00:02:11.849> to<00:02:11.880> the<00:02:12.030> eye<00:02:12.060> this<00:02:12.240> is

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
at it's very pleasing to the eye this is

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.970 
at it's very pleasing to the eye this is
probably<00:02:13.080> one<00:02:13.290> of<00:02:13.319> the<00:02:13.380> most<00:02:13.590> beautiful

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
probably one of the most beautiful

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:20.030 
probably one of the most beautiful
aircraft<00:02:14.790> ever<00:02:15.360> built<00:02:15.480> the<00:02:15.690> Concorde<00:02:16.260> and<00:02:19.040> but

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
aircraft ever built the Concorde and but

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.250 
aircraft ever built the Concorde and but
yeah<00:02:20.880> I<00:02:20.910> want<00:02:21.239> to<00:02:21.360> have<00:02:21.750> a<00:02:21.890> an<00:02:23.030> authentic

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
yeah I want to have a an authentic

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.770 
yeah I want to have a an authentic
drooping<00:02:25.260> nose

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
drooping nose

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.120 
drooping nose
you<00:02:27.590> know<00:02:27.740> have<00:02:27.920> the<00:02:29.050> forward<00:02:30.050> portion<00:02:30.350> that

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
you know have the forward portion that

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:32.500 
you know have the forward portion that
droops<00:02:31.370> down<00:02:31.580> to<00:02:31.760> the<00:02:31.850> pilots<00:02:32.120> can<00:02:32.240> see<00:02:32.360> that

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
droops down to the pilots can see that

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.650 
droops down to the pilots can see that
runway<00:02:32.780> when<00:02:32.990> she's<00:02:33.170> at<00:02:33.320> our<00:02:33.490> very<00:02:34.490> nose<00:02:35.450> high

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
runway when she's at our very nose high

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.780 
runway when she's at our very nose high
angle<00:02:35.990> of<00:02:36.020> attack<00:02:36.110> for<00:02:36.560> landing<00:02:36.890> when<00:02:37.670> she

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
angle of attack for landing when she

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.880 
angle of attack for landing when she
flares<00:02:38.120> the<00:02:38.570> concorde<00:02:39.050> and<00:02:39.230> the<00:02:39.410> visor<00:02:39.590> comes

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
flares the concorde and the visor comes

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:40.990 
flares the concorde and the visor comes
down<00:02:40.160> so<00:02:40.310> I'm<00:02:40.370> gonna<00:02:40.460> have<00:02:40.610> to<00:02:40.640> have<00:02:40.820> some<00:02:40.970> kind

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
down so I'm gonna have to have some kind

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.410 
down so I'm gonna have to have some kind
of<00:02:41.270> you<00:02:41.630> know<00:02:42.140> the<00:02:42.650> nose<00:02:42.860> will<00:02:43.250> hinge<00:02:43.940> right

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
of you know the nose will hinge right

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:45.880 
of you know the nose will hinge right
there<00:02:44.720> like<00:02:45.080> the<00:02:45.230> real<00:02:45.410> one

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
there like the real one

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.720 
there like the real one
it'll<00:02:46.130> hinge<00:02:46.400> drop<00:02:47.060> and<00:02:47.360> then<00:02:48.080> the<00:02:48.280> visor<00:02:49.280> will

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
it'll hinge drop and then the visor will

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.330 
it'll hinge drop and then the visor will
have<00:02:49.910> to<00:02:50.530> slide<00:02:51.530> down<00:02:51.830> so<00:02:51.980> I'm<00:02:52.040> going<00:02:52.160> to<00:02:52.220> have

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
have to slide down so I'm going to have

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.550 
have to slide down so I'm going to have
the<00:02:52.550> Vipers<00:02:53.000> visor<00:02:53.390> probably<00:02:54.020> sitting<00:02:54.290> on<00:02:54.410> two

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
the Vipers visor probably sitting on two

00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:00.190 
the Vipers visor probably sitting on two
rails<00:02:54.860> or<00:02:55.220> some<00:02:55.400> kind<00:02:55.670> of<00:02:55.870> some<00:02:56.870> type<00:02:57.110> of<00:02:59.200> some

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
rails or some kind of some type of some

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.070 
rails or some kind of some type of some
kind<00:03:00.380> of<00:03:00.410> pulley<00:03:00.680> or<00:03:00.890> something<00:03:01.280> so<00:03:01.760> a

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.080 
kind of pulley or something so a

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.480 
kind of pulley or something so a
separate<00:03:03.080> server<00:03:03.320> will<00:03:03.560> run<00:03:03.770> the<00:03:03.890> visor<00:03:04.100> and

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:04.490 
separate server will run the visor and

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:07.900 
separate server will run the visor and
then<00:03:05.150> one<00:03:05.360> servo<00:03:05.780> will<00:03:06.080> you<00:03:06.770> know<00:03:06.890> make<00:03:07.760> the

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
then one servo will you know make the

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:09.340 
then one servo will you know make the
nose<00:03:08.090> droop<00:03:08.360> and<00:03:08.600> I'm<00:03:08.690> have<00:03:08.900> like<00:03:09.050> a<00:03:09.080> little

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.350 
nose droop and I'm have like a little

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:12.100 
nose droop and I'm have like a little
metal<00:03:09.710> antenna<00:03:10.040> at<00:03:10.340> the<00:03:10.490> tip<00:03:10.700> so<00:03:11.300> the<00:03:11.960> way

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110 
metal antenna at the tip so the way

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.830 
metal antenna at the tip so the way

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 
molded or I'll just make them out of

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:59.680 
molded or I'll just make them out of
balsa<00:03:56.230> that's<00:03:57.230> where<00:03:57.880> that's<00:03:58.880> where<00:03:59.060> we<00:03:59.390> stand

00:03:59.680 --> 00:03:59.690 
balsa that's where that's where we stand

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:02.290 
balsa that's where that's where we stand
right<00:03:59.840> now<00:04:00.020> with<00:04:00.500> the<00:04:00.620> Concorde<00:04:01.300> we're

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:02.300 
right now with the Concorde we're

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:03.970 
right now with the Concorde we're
getting<00:04:02.600> there<00:04:02.780> she<00:04:03.020> is<00:04:03.200> definitely<00:04:03.650> getting

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:03.980 
getting there she is definitely getting

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:07.510 
getting there she is definitely getting
there<00:04:04.250> so<00:04:04.489> I'd<00:04:04.640> say<00:04:04.910> another<00:04:06.070> another<00:04:07.070> couple

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:07.520

maybe another matter I want to say a

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:12.580 
maybe another matter I want to say a
month<00:04:10.550> but<00:04:10.880> that's<00:04:11.060> just<00:04:11.239> not<00:04:11.420> that's<00:04:12.380> just

not doable hopefully maybe another
couple<00:04:14.870> months<00:04:15.500> and<00:04:15.860> then<00:04:16.730> the<00:04:16.850> Pan<00:04:17.030> Am<00:04:17.270> I've

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:17.540 
couple months and then the Pan Am I've

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:19.180 
couple months and then the Pan Am I've
already<00:04:17.870> I<00:04:17.900> have<00:04:18.169> the<00:04:18.290> fuselage<00:04:18.709> section<00:04:19.070> for

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:19.190 
already I have the fuselage section for

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:23.260 
already I have the fuselage section for
the<00:04:19.250> Pan<00:04:19.400> Am<00:04:19.580> made<00:04:20.120> its<00:04:20.900> a<00:04:20.989> fuselage<00:04:21.470> tube<00:04:22.270> tail

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.270 
the Pan Am made its a fuselage tube tail

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:25.530 
the Pan Am made its a fuselage tube tail
but<00:04:23.600> I'm<00:04:23.720> gonna<00:04:23.900> wait<00:04:24.350> till<00:04:24.560> I<00:04:24.650> fiberglass
