00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:07.880
 we present you now a new generation of products a 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:11.939
 kind of small digital terminal with a superb screen 

00:00:11.939 --> 00:00:16.939
 totally connected to the time he did in 3g for 100 th test archos which 

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:20.839
 has just released this little gem which for now exclusivity at sfr 

00:00:20.839 --> 00:00:21.989
 we are lucky 

00:00:21.989 --> 00:00:26.859
 first with us daddy darcos these rotten grow CEO of aar this is 

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:31.960
 with the good day can not blame for hydrogen damn so thank you for 2 us 

00:00:31.959 --> 00:00:35.839
 give these few minutes to introduce us a new product little 

00:00:35.839 --> 00:00:39.069
 nearly 20% and that is very very strong with a beautiful flat screen 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.060
 here it is and who is therefore connected 3g 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:43.290
 is it 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.220
 of truly today the the becoming of this kind of product to be 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:49.640
 all the time connected because at the start 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.600
 archos 7 and ddd products that were not connected the road or 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:53.799
 responsible for 

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:57.349
 music videos et cetera that cost me when we're on the move 

00:00:57.349 --> 00:01:00.019
 there now it is necessary that this product this kind of product that connect all the 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:02.220
 time 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:03.210
 so percent 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.350
 so a year ago the two steps ahead to crash the country the worst 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.320
 who was not logged in 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.640
 and then for two years we have connected products at home 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.910
 to see the wi-fi network 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:18.700
 in the case for many because it means that the product connects 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.000
 directly to internet fai will search its content on the internet 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.800
 p the step 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.500
 the stage that is crossed here today a collection 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.700
 money to banks 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.140
 3 5g the larger project 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.250
 it's a connection beyond 20 megabits per second to first 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.180
 goal megabytes per second and that's really the availability of the internet 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:39.830
 broadband everywhere 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.720
 and it's a revolution similar to that of 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.290
 the dsl a few years ago or intermÃ¨de widely in the house 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.610
 mother 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.460
 so I think in the eyes 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.740
 next year will be a pivotal year between them 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.740
 we already have a lot of our products will be 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.000
 and I'm betting terran 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.980
 this parity in 2005 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:06.260
 most of our products will be connected 3g most 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:08.909
 what can we do before him 

00:02:08.909 --> 00:02:12.849
 freeville november 8 the agreement or will we target wifi and more effective 

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:14.979
 at home 

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:17.749
 what can we do and what can not we do with 

00:02:17.749 --> 00:02:20.749
 this kind of product compared to the pc against the house where they grow 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:24.599
 what I explained the site 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:27.939
 first of all these products intel asus lanparty cuvillier 

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:30.329
 altec of a 

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:33.419
 Processors category of new generation processors 

00:02:33.419 --> 00:02:36.559
 no really there is a very important technological leap 

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:39.729
 these are extremely low-power processors that today have 

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:42.299
 the power of a pc 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:44.889
 hmaidan what was not the case before and it's true that's why it's 

00:02:44.889 --> 00:02:46.629
 was wasting time still web pages 

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:50.099
 display slowly today with this kind of processors will be after this 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:53.480
 that nordic foundation surfing comfort normal for the hour so that 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.980
 enough technological evolution to hope for twenty years because 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.409
 so far with 

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:02.189
 it was something heavy with big paws 

00:03:02.189 --> 00:03:05.359
 alas this new generation of processors and commits suicide no such 

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:06.069
 fault 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:08.449
 at the last generation 

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:10.889
 have a processor trees 

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:13.009
 the processors 

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:15.859
 the processors arm 

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:17.379
 always that the processors arm 

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:19.809
 however barclays in 

00:03:19.809 --> 00:03:22.809
 pro the moment when funds of 4 11% 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:28.469
 the police discovered that more than a quarter of the ddc recognized maryse appliances 

00:03:28.469 --> 00:03:30.190
 mobile to access the site 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:33.499
 practically present that the unprecedented x86 

00:03:33.499 --> 00:03:37.389
 p this product and world premiere and the first integration 

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:40.339
 this new generation of 

00:03:40.339 --> 00:03:42.049
 the shape of the body weapons 

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:43.719
 which cortex arm 

00:03:43.719 --> 00:03:45.909
 and it's still texas 

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:47.309
 clock speed 

00:03:47.309 --> 00:03:48.839
 equivalent 

00:03:48.839 --> 00:03:51.199
 runner about four times more powerful 

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:52.289
 he consumes 

00:03:52.289 --> 00:03:54.519
 and others 

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:57.349
 so we have more power and more autonomy that 

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:00.349
 how much autonomy is there with this kind of products and well it comes 

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:04.449
 in 3g but we arrive practically 4% 

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:07.019
 playing life 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:09.979
 but when video 

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:11.799
 the blood 3 I want 

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:12.999
 Sign out 

00:04:12.999 --> 00:04:14.749
 when we arrive almost six hours 

00:04:14.749 --> 00:04:17.969
 So 30 gigawatts hard disk moore storage capacity 

00:04:17.969 --> 00:04:21.539
 connected so we can go on the internet we can the ticket his hands and 

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:22.440
 he of course 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.740
 and after having access to everything that concerns it, that is to say 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:29.020
 summer waters music downloads videos and so on so that's access 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:30.430
 at all intervals 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:34.580
 and access to all applications at dinners% offered by sfr 

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:39.389
 it's compatible flash will of course by releasing his irons proposes a score 

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:41.759
 chains 

00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:44.759
 so there is a TV bouquet 

00:04:45.849 --> 00:04:46.900
 there is 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:49.810
 multiple safari apps to tell me about fifty 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:52.810
 dedicated applications that are offered 

00:04:53.409 --> 00:04:55.870
 there is an online music store 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:57.610
 permanent access manager 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:01.580
 so here it is really a very very rich offer everywhere with you all 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:02.279
 the weather 

00:05:02.279 --> 00:05:04.879
 she would have crossed do you not fear competition from the 

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:07.879
 mobile TV that will arrive on cell phones soon 

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:11.529
 giving up game but I'm not talking about the competition from TV 

00:05:11.529 --> 00:05:13.550
 mobile by category 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:15.659
 so hosting soon arrive on the scene next 

00:05:15.659 --> 00:05:17.889
 generation darcos those rer b to I am 

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:21.280
 I do not know where the land and payroll and rh depends on what will happen 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:21.740
 in 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:22.610
 la France 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:24.129
 on that side 

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:26.249
 but the TNT 

00:05:26.249 --> 00:05:27.919
 and already on the other 

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:31.219
 we will continue our 

00:05:31.219 --> 00:05:33.929
 because today the problem is the receipt of the TNT as soon as we 

00:05:33.929 --> 00:05:37.330
 get back in a year in a local actually as soon as we move away yes 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:39.419
 a window it works less well yes 

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:40.610
 although 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:43.539
 we've been doing this for years and we're working a lot on 

00:05:43.539 --> 00:05:45.120
 technology 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:48.220
 very specific antenna to receive the TNT in dvb-t 

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:52.909
 when we have a case a little 

00:05:52.909 --> 00:05:55.229
 very important reception 

00:05:55.229 --> 00:05:56.979
 so the tnt progress a lot 

00:05:56.979 --> 00:06:00.729
 but who also also published topics on which we work the 

00:06:00.729 --> 00:06:02.639
 mobile satellite TV 

00:06:02.639 --> 00:06:06.469
 ah yes little idea and vba is already in some Asian countries I 

00:06:06.469 --> 00:06:09.270
 believe nevertheless it does not exist yet on arrival 

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:10.490
 so what 

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:11.930
 but percent 

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:14.159
 workers protest to enlighten 

00:06:14.159 --> 00:06:17.159
 very close to three operators on it so it goes 

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:20.539
 pro memoria see a satellite eneurope 

00:06:20.539 --> 00:06:22.270
 % to this visit 

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:24.610
 such 5:30 

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:27.610
 there were t there were two satellites that are in the process of 

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:30.749
 the trend in the usa so not a costa bet 

00:06:30.749 --> 00:06:33.770
 but the time it means that it must therefore the reference shareholder 

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:36.539
 she will also work with 

00:06:36.539 --> 00:06:39.889
 the other party in the usa 

00:06:39.889 --> 00:06:42.629
 t and then there is his place had said m 

00:06:42.629 --> 00:06:45.069
 a satellite then landed 

00:06:45.069 --> 00:06:47.759
 but that means we can receive mobile TV via satellite 

00:06:47.759 --> 00:06:49.789
 on an innovative product to one everywhere 

00:06:49.789 --> 00:06:51.120
 yes except contout 

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:54.180
 where we see more and l this is it for him this elite 

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:56.389
 except when we were talking about the horizon 

00:06:56.389 --> 00:06:58.860
 it must be said that its competitors in a local to the euro 

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:00.930
 we will not exclude reported altogether 

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:05.199
 but rowing has enlisted Indian in the landlocked there are there are these 

00:07:05.199 --> 00:07:06.949
 they are hybrid systems 

00:07:06.949 --> 00:07:08.249
 or in areas 

00:07:08.249 --> 00:07:12.779
 in urban areas with high buildings liliane urban retransmission 

00:07:12.779 --> 00:07:13.379
 m 

00:07:13.379 --> 00:07:15.899
 wikipedia ebay 

00:07:15.899 --> 00:07:18.300
 p outside in the countryside 

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:19.820
 there is because of this there is a camp 

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:22.069
 we pray the cars 

00:07:22.069 --> 00:07:25.169
 like that it really brings the trouble 

00:07:25.169 --> 00:07:28.169
 and so black cosmos dream 

00:07:29.149 --> 00:07:30.629
 we receive these facts from this year 

00:07:30.629 --> 00:07:33.099
 so for this purpose mobile TV is really we do not care
