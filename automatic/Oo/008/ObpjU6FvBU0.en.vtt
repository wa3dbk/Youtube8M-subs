00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110 
not have tried with the original file so

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:10.300 
not have tried with the original file so
I'm<00:01:09.200> going<00:01:09.350> to<00:01:09.409> take<00:01:09.560> this<00:01:09.710> to<00:01:09.860> a<00:01:09.920> black<00:01:10.100> and

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:16.580 
contrast if I like the way that looks I

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:23.260 
contrast if I like the way that looks I
can<00:01:16.790> create<00:01:17.000> another<00:01:17.210> snapshot

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.730

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:30.660 
what I can do is I can group those

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:32.720 
what I can do is I can group those
settings<00:01:31.020> into<00:01:31.260> a<00:01:31.350> preset<00:01:31.890> and<00:01:32.010> apply<00:01:32.340> them<00:01:32.550> to

settings into a preset and apply them to
other<00:01:32.910> images<00:01:33.530> this<00:01:34.530> is<00:01:34.710> a<00:01:34.740> great<00:01:35.010> tool<00:01:35.220> if<00:01:35.280> you

want to continue and use on other images
in<00:01:39.510> the<00:01:39.600> future<00:01:40.040> another<00:01:41.040> way<00:01:41.190> to<00:01:41.220> utilize

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
in the future another way to utilize

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.969 
in the future another way to utilize
non-destructive<00:01:42.390> editing<00:01:42.450> is<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:43.800> ability

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
non-destructive editing is the ability

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.680 
non-destructive editing is the ability
