me some issues but once it came in
unplugged<00:01:19.200> and<00:01:19.350> I<00:01:19.409> figured<00:01:19.680> all<00:01:19.770> that<00:01:19.830> out

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 
unplugged and I figured all that out

unplugged and I figured all that out
that<00:01:21.060> worked<00:01:21.270> okay<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:22.470> full-size

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
that worked okay the full-size

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.410

be a little loose in the docking station

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.940 
be a little loose in the docking station
but<00:01:29.520> will<00:01:29.610> work<00:01:29.790> just<00:01:29.880> fine<00:01:30.650> what<00:01:31.650> you<00:01:31.770> getting

it<00:02:02.670> really<00:02:02.880> for<00:02:03.479> transferring<00:02:04.020> a

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:05.149 
it really for transferring a

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:08.809 
it really for transferring a
three-and-a-half<00:02:06.149> gigabyte<00:02:06.689> file<00:02:06.990> and<00:02:07.979> as<00:02:08.610> we

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
three-and-a-half gigabyte file and as we

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.570 
three-and-a-half gigabyte file and as we
look<00:02:08.970> at<00:02:09.090> the<00:02:09.209> eSATA<00:02:09.810> speeds<00:02:10.580> eastbound

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
look at the eSATA speeds eastbound

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.880 
look at the eSATA speeds eastbound
speeds<00:02:11.970> were<00:02:12.360> just<00:02:12.750> a<00:02:13.050> little

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
speeds were just a little

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.790 
speeds were just a little
faster<00:02:14.310> and<00:02:14.630> I<00:02:15.630> was<00:02:15.780> surprised<00:02:16.140> I<00:02:16.500> thought<00:02:16.680> the

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
faster and I was surprised I thought the

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.130 
faster and I was surprised I thought the
East's<00:02:17.100> that<00:02:17.250> a<00:02:17.280> file<00:02:18.209> transfer<00:02:18.420> speed<00:02:18.959> would

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
East's that a file transfer speed would

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.070 
East's that a file transfer speed would
be<00:02:19.260> a<00:02:19.290> lot<00:02:19.590> faster<00:02:19.890> but<00:02:20.340> it<00:02:20.459> really<00:02:20.670> wasn't

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
be a lot faster but it really wasn't

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.870 
be a lot faster but it really wasn't
and<00:02:22.440> maybe<00:02:22.650> it's<00:02:22.860> a<00:02:22.950> limitation<00:02:23.310> of<00:02:23.490> the<00:02:23.580> hard

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
and maybe it's a limitation of the hard

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.090 
and maybe it's a limitation of the hard
drive<00:02:24.090> that<00:02:24.120> was<00:02:24.510> in<00:02:24.720> the<00:02:24.870> dock<00:02:25.110> that<00:02:25.740> could<00:02:25.980> be

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
drive that was in the dock that could be

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.790 
drive that was in the dock that could be
a<00:02:26.130> possibility<00:02:26.780> but<00:02:27.780> it<00:02:27.930> came<00:02:28.110> in<00:02:28.380> at<00:02:28.770> just

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
a possibility but it came in at just

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.020 
a possibility but it came in at just
around<00:02:29.610> a<00:02:30.120> minute<00:02:30.450> for<00:02:31.280> total<00:02:32.280> transfer<00:02:32.700> five

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
around a minute for total transfer five

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.970 
around a minute for total transfer five
minutes<00:02:33.510> six<00:02:33.780> seconds<00:02:34.200> I<00:02:34.350> think<00:02:34.410> ends<00:02:34.860> up

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
minutes six seconds I think ends up

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.310 
minutes six seconds I think ends up
being<00:02:35.220> the<00:02:35.370> exact<00:02:35.820> time<00:02:36.150> for<00:02:36.870> anything<00:02:37.080> to

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
being the exact time for anything to

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.890 
being the exact time for anything to
come<00:02:37.380> in<00:02:37.850> now<00:02:38.850> if<00:02:38.940> you<00:02:39.030> look<00:02:39.180> at<00:02:39.270> the<00:02:39.390> buffalo

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
come in now if you look at the buffalo

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
come in now if you look at the buffalo

USB 3.0 external hard drive speed moving
the<00:02:44.040> same<00:02:44.220> file<00:02:44.640> it<00:02:44.970> goes<00:02:45.180> by<00:02:45.540> a<00:02:45.569> lot<00:02:45.870> quicker

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
it comes in under a minute really more

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:52.460 
it comes in under a minute really more
about<00:02:49.350> 50<00:02:49.980> seconds<00:02:50.400> or<00:02:50.489> so<00:02:50.959> now<00:02:51.959> if<00:02:52.140> you<00:02:52.260> look

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
about 50 seconds or so now if you look

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.850 
about 50 seconds or so now if you look
at<00:02:52.560> USB<00:02:53.010> 2.0<00:02:53.820> you'll<00:02:54.480> see<00:02:54.690> that<00:02:54.900> that<00:02:55.110> speed<00:02:55.530> is

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
at USB 2.0 you'll see that that speed is

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.910 
at USB 2.0 you'll see that that speed is
drastically<00:02:56.790> slower<00:02:57.260> moving<00:02:58.260> the<00:02:58.380> same<00:02:58.590> file

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
drastically slower moving the same file

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:04.130 
drastically slower moving the same file
to<00:02:59.220> a<00:02:59.250> USB<00:02:59.570> 2.0<00:03:00.570> enclosure<00:03:01.580> it<00:03:02.580> took<00:03:02.970> I<00:03:03.330> think

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
to a USB 2.0 enclosure it took I think

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.590 
to a USB 2.0 enclosure it took I think
just<00:03:04.650> over<00:03:05.040> 2<00:03:05.430> minutes<00:03:05.459> for<00:03:05.970> that<00:03:06.030> whole<00:03:06.300> file

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
just over 2 minutes for that whole file

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.050 
just over 2 minutes for that whole file
to<00:03:06.840> properly<00:03:07.560> transfer<00:03:07.830> all<00:03:08.370> the<00:03:08.519> way<00:03:08.640> over<00:03:08.850> so

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
to properly transfer all the way over so

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.580 
to properly transfer all the way over so
there's<00:03:09.269> definitely<00:03:09.450> a<00:03:09.720> speed<00:03:10.019> increase<00:03:10.380> as

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
there's definitely a speed increase as

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.890 
there's definitely a speed increase as
you<00:03:10.739> go<00:03:10.860> through<00:03:11.190> some<00:03:12.180> final<00:03:12.510> thoughts<00:03:12.690> on

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900

you go through some final thoughts on
this<00:03:13.050> unit<00:03:13.410> as<00:03:13.530> you<00:03:13.709> need<00:03:13.890> to<00:03:14.010> plug<00:03:14.190> it<00:03:14.310> in
