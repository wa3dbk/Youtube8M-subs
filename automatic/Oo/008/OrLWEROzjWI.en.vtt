caliber training Johnny and I spoke and
we<00:00:42.780> looked<00:00:43.020> around<00:00:43.140> and<00:00:43.559> we<00:00:43.649> saw<00:00:44.100> that<00:00:44.129> there

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
we looked around and we saw that there

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.639 
we looked around and we saw that there
was<00:00:44.730> a<00:00:44.789> lot<00:00:45.030> lacking<00:00:45.510> in<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.750> industry<00:00:46.320> we

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
was a lot lacking in the industry we

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.290 
was a lot lacking in the industry we
made<00:00:46.800> this<00:00:46.950> comment<00:00:47.190> each<00:00:47.460> other<00:00:47.670> someday<00:00:47.969> we

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
made this comment each other someday we

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.590 
made this comment each other someday we
should<00:00:48.510> do<00:00:48.719> a<00:00:48.750> school<00:00:49.340> because<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.969> education

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
should do a school because the education

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.869 
should do a school because the education
was<00:00:51.930> pretty<00:00:52.379> minimal<00:00:52.590> for<00:00:53.100> what<00:00:53.280> we<00:00:53.579> thought

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
was pretty minimal for what we thought

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.200 
was pretty minimal for what we thought
would<00:00:54.360> benefit<00:00:54.899> our<00:00:55.079> industry<00:00:55.800> I<00:00:56.210> suppose

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
would benefit our industry I suppose

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.119 
would benefit our industry I suppose
it's<00:00:57.420> like<00:00:57.600> art<00:00:57.960> there<00:00:58.590> are<00:00:58.680> certain<00:00:59.100> things

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
it's like art there are certain things

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.510 
it's like art there are certain things
you<00:00:59.460> can<00:00:59.550> or<00:00:59.940> can't<00:01:00.149> do<00:01:00.649> if<00:01:01.649> you<00:01:01.800> follow<00:01:02.160> those

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
you can or can't do if you follow those

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.119 
you can or can't do if you follow those
then<00:01:03.149> your<00:01:03.359> creativity<00:01:03.899> can<00:01:04.260> come<00:01:04.470> in<00:01:04.680> and<00:01:04.920> add

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
then your creativity can come in and add

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.030 
then your creativity can come in and add
enhance<00:01:05.760> to<00:01:06.540> your<00:01:06.720> creation<00:01:07.350> as<00:01:07.740> if<00:01:07.920> you

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
cutting anything so it really teaches a
