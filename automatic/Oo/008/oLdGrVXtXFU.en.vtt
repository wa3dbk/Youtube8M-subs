it's gonna throw him off his time
enemies<00:02:35.549> and<00:02:35.819> he's<00:02:36.090> gonna<00:02:36.329> stay<00:02:36.569> on<00:02:36.690> the

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.839 
enemies and he's gonna stay on the
outside<00:02:36.840> and<00:02:37.560> I<00:02:38.040> think<00:02:38.280> the<00:02:38.400> reason<00:02:38.579> why

00:02:38.839 --> 00:02:38.849 
outside and I think the reason why

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:40.250 
outside and I think the reason why
Helios<00:02:39.390> is<00:02:39.540> the<00:02:39.599> trouble<00:02:39.870> has<00:02:39.930> been<00:02:40.079> getting

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 
on the inside that much because guys

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:43.130 
on the inside that much because guys

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
have been using their jab against him

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.509 
have been using their jab against him
and<00:02:44.120> I<00:02:45.650> don't<00:02:46.650> see<00:02:46.829> him<00:02:47.069> getting<00:02:47.280> on<00:02:47.430> the

and I don't see him getting on the
inside<00:02:47.879> so<00:02:48.150> easily<00:02:48.420> against<00:02:48.900> Sergio<00:02:49.260> Martinez

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:49.799
