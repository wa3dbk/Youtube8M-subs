00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:35.030 
take off I'll move the camera though and

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:36.880 
take off I'll move the camera though and
I'll<00:00:35.270> be<00:00:35.390> able<00:00:35.450> to<00:00:35.720> show<00:00:35.989> you<00:00:36.050> i<00:00:36.200> have<00:00:36.530> one<00:00:36.710> now

and i say this is going to be an

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:40.360 
and i say this is going to be an
experiment<00:00:39.350> for<00:00:39.410> me<00:00:39.590> i<00:00:39.620> want<00:00:39.829> to<00:00:39.890> see<00:00:40.040> how<00:00:40.190> well

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:40.370 
experiment for me i want to see how well

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.910 
experiment for me i want to see how well
it<00:00:40.400> performs<00:00:41.140> so<00:00:42.140> i'll<00:00:42.260> just<00:00:42.290> move<00:00:42.649> you<00:00:42.829> then

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:44.920 
it performs so i'll just move you then

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:51.960 
it performs so i'll just move you then
okay<00:00:45.920> so<00:00:46.910> just<00:00:47.329> a<00:00:47.540> stainless<00:00:48.440> steel<00:00:48.470> Califia

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:51.970 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:55.319 

first<00:00:52.970> of<00:00:53.120> all<00:00:53.239> God<00:00:53.510> by<00:00:53.660> 30<00:00:54.140> feet<00:00:54.320> of<00:00:54.920> paracord

00:00:55.319 --> 00:00:55.329 
first of all God by 30 feet of paracord

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:57.340 
first of all God by 30 feet of paracord
so<00:00:56.329> there's<00:00:56.480> actually<00:00:56.570> quite<00:00:56.780> a<00:00:56.930> lot<00:00:57.140> there<00:00:57.320> i

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
so there's actually quite a lot there i

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:58.990 
so there's actually quite a lot there i
might<00:00:57.500> reduce<00:00:57.860> the<00:00:58.040> size<00:00:58.250> of<00:00:58.430> that<00:00:58.460> it's<00:00:58.730> quick

00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.000 
might reduce the size of that it's quick

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.080 
might reduce the size of that it's quick
break<00:00:59.239> as<00:00:59.899> you<00:01:00.140> can<00:01:00.260> see<00:01:00.530> but<00:01:01.040> it<00:01:01.700> may<00:01:01.850> be<00:01:01.910> you

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:02.090 
break as you can see but it may be you

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.179 
break as you can see but it may be you
saw<00:01:02.300> quiz<00:01:02.480> applying<00:01:02.840> ddos<00:01:03.230> this<00:01:03.680> court<00:01:04.070> that

00:01:04.179 --> 00:01:04.189 
saw quiz applying ddos this court that

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:05.830 
saw quiz applying ddos this court that
you'd<00:01:04.309> use<00:01:04.489> regularly<00:01:05.030> and<00:01:05.239> probably<00:01:05.570> come<00:01:05.810> up

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:05.840 
you'd use regularly and probably come up

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.809 
you'd use regularly and probably come up
and<00:01:06.140> need<00:01:06.799> to<00:01:06.920> the<00:01:07.009> place<00:01:07.249> from<00:01:07.369> time<00:01:07.579> to<00:01:07.789> time

00:01:07.809 --> 00:01:07.819 
and need to the place from time to time

00:01:07.819 --> 00:01:11.949 
and need to the place from time to time
but<00:01:08.289> then<00:01:09.289> have<00:01:09.530> this<00:01:09.770> Lansky<00:01:10.569> multi<00:01:11.569> sharpen

00:01:11.949 --> 00:01:11.959 
but then have this Lansky multi sharpen

00:01:11.959 --> 00:01:14.289 
but then have this Lansky multi sharpen
up<00:01:12.020> so<00:01:12.530> it's<00:01:12.679> good<00:01:12.709> for<00:01:13.009> sharpening<00:01:13.399> normal

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:14.299 
up so it's good for sharpening normal

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:16.300 
up so it's good for sharpening normal
plane<00:01:14.450> edged<00:01:14.659> blades<00:01:14.959> servations<00:01:15.859> on<00:01:16.039> here

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
plane edged blades servations on here

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:24.160 
plane edged blades servations on here
and<00:01:16.689> even<00:01:17.689> fish<00:01:18.049> hooks<00:01:18.289> if<00:01:18.469> necessary<00:01:23.020> next<00:01:24.020> I

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 
and even fish hooks if necessary next I

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:29.800 
and even fish hooks if necessary next I
have<00:01:24.380> the<00:01:24.859> Java<00:01:25.869> splice<00:01:28.209> okay<00:01:29.209> so<00:01:29.270> this<00:01:29.479> is<00:01:29.689> the

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
have the Java splice okay so this is the

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:31.179 
have the Java splice okay so this is the
same<00:01:30.020> as<00:01:30.139> the<00:01:30.259> vase<00:01:30.469> apart<00:01:30.889> from<00:01:31.069> the<00:01:31.159> law

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:31.189 
same as the vase apart from the law

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:33.069 
same as the vase apart from the law
they're<00:01:31.549> the<00:01:31.700> only<00:01:31.819> difference<00:01:32.299> is<00:01:32.479> that<00:01:32.539> has

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:33.079 
they're the only difference is that has

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:34.269 
they're the only difference is that has

ma'am<00:01:45.259> I<00:01:45.469> want<00:01:45.649> to<00:01:45.740> get<00:01:45.999> get<00:01:46.999> used<00:01:47.209> to<00:01:47.329> using

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:47.509 
ma'am I want to get get used to using

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:49.629 
ma'am I want to get get used to using
this<00:01:47.749> more<00:01:48.020> in<00:01:48.139> practice<00:01:48.590> with<00:01:48.770> it<00:01:48.829> and<00:01:49.340> it's

00:01:49.629 --> 00:01:49.639 
this more in practice with it and it's

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:51.190 
this more in practice with it and it's
something<00:01:49.789> that<00:01:49.939> I<00:01:50.329> find<00:01:50.719> quite<00:01:50.899> difficult

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
something that I find quite difficult

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.929 
something that I find quite difficult
it's<00:01:51.740> quite<00:01:51.979> hard<00:01:52.099> to<00:01:52.189> keep<00:01:52.369> the<00:01:52.520> shavings<00:01:52.849> in

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:52.939 
it's quite hard to keep the shavings in

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:56.190 
it's quite hard to keep the shavings in
one<00:01:53.119> place<00:01:53.529> so<00:01:54.529> what<00:01:54.679> to<00:01:54.799> practice<00:01:55.219> without

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 
one place so what to practice without

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:01.599 
one place so what to practice without
next<00:01:57.200> I<00:01:57.289> have<00:01:57.439> a<00:01:58.929> photon<00:01:59.929> make<00:02:00.619> for<00:02:00.919> light<00:02:01.279> this

00:02:01.599 --> 00:02:01.609 
next I have a photon make for light this

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:03.879 
next I have a photon make for light this
is<00:02:01.759> a<00:02:01.789> blue<00:02:02.060> one<00:02:02.270> blue<00:02:02.569> LED<00:02:03.049> and<00:02:03.590> it's<00:02:03.709> just

00:02:03.879 --> 00:02:03.889 
is a blue one blue LED and it's just

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:06.459 
is a blue one blue LED and it's just
push<00:02:04.130> on<00:02:04.340> there's<00:02:04.669> no<00:02:04.959> moment<00:02:05.959> at<00:02:06.109> there's<00:02:06.319> no

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:06.469 
push on there's no moment at there's no

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:09.040 
push on there's no moment at there's no
am<00:02:06.849> switch<00:02:07.849> that<00:02:08.090> keeps<00:02:08.360> it<00:02:08.479> permanently<00:02:08.899> on

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
am switch that keeps it permanently on

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.440
