when<00:01:08.990> you<00:01:09.110> hear<00:01:09.530> about<00:01:09.740> it<00:01:09.950> a<00:01:10.070> hundred<00:01:10.880> hundred

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:11.830 
when you hear about it a hundred hundred

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:15.100

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.320 
six hundred and fifty kilo iron and I'm
going<00:01:15.320> to<00:01:15.380> be<00:01:15.560> installed<00:01:16.369> by<00:01:16.580> helicopter<00:01:17.240> you

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:17.330 
going to be installed by helicopter you

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.749 
going to be installed by helicopter you
say<00:01:17.540> a<00:01:18.310> terrible<00:01:19.310> idea

00:01:19.749 --> 00:01:19.759 
say a terrible idea

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:27.010 
say a terrible idea
you<00:01:19.850> know<00:01:24.790> I've<00:01:25.790> used<00:01:26.119> the<00:01:26.300> metaphor<00:01:26.600> before

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
you know I've used the metaphor before

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.749 
you know I've used the metaphor before
but<00:01:27.140> I<00:01:27.229> think<00:01:27.290> this<00:01:27.440> is<00:01:27.649> just<00:01:27.680> a<00:01:28.070> simply<00:01:28.460> a<00:01:28.490> form

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:28.759 
but I think this is just a simply a form

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:30.880 
but I think this is just a simply a form
of<00:01:28.850> acupuncture<00:01:29.450> which<00:01:29.810> reinforces<00:01:30.560> what's

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
of acupuncture which reinforces what's

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.760 
of acupuncture which reinforces what's
already<00:01:31.070> here<00:01:31.580> I<00:01:31.790> think<00:01:32.450> that<00:01:32.479> the<00:01:32.960> mountains

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
already here I think that the mountains

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.080 
already here I think that the mountains
will<00:01:33.950> always<00:01:34.220> stand<00:01:34.550> as<00:01:35.479> them<00:01:36.320> as<00:01:36.530> as<00:01:37.280> the<00:01:37.880> most

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
will always stand as them as as the most

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.440 
will always stand as them as as the most
extraordinary<00:01:39.100> reminder<00:01:40.100> of<00:01:40.280> our<00:01:40.459> place<00:01:41.149> in

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
extraordinary reminder of our place in

00:01:41.450 --> 00:02:45.200 
extraordinary reminder of our place in
time<00:01:41.750> and<00:01:41.959> space

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:45.210 

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:47.270 

you
