00:00:00.809 --> 00:00:03.809
 eca 

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:07.140
 today the company will be my first final 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.079
 I'll introduce you in those rate 

00:00:09.079 --> 00:00:10.359
 the hottest 

00:00:10.359 --> 00:00:12.389
 for him at the cod receiving tonal 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.359
 so first of all we could ask the question about the interest of fishing 

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:17.759
 of fish 

00:00:17.759 --> 00:00:21.450
 so on the one hand it's still pretty combative fish 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:24.880
 because we are going to hurry on rather large funds between 20 and 30 meters 

00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:30.739
 moreover we had the pleasure of locating and rescuing them from their 

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:32.039
 positions on wrecks 

00:00:32.039 --> 00:00:34.970
 so it's really with this research mandate 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:37.970
 and without forgetting the qualities of swimming 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.950
 for art the practice of fishing could you guen we have 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:50.760
 selected three types of cables 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.120
 a beginner range a confirmed range and to finish 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.670
 to patrice evra 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:01.789
 so at first I will introduce you the range of time 

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:04.630
 so it consists of a graphite cane 

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:09.180
 of a half-breed length with computerization between 100 and 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.740
 250 grams 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.340
 this can understands there is only one aluminum coil to build graphite and 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.190
 the latter has five years my opinion 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:22.650
 tanaka even accepted by the press we advocated a million of his 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.330
 good quality in france saint-etienne with a resistance involved in the 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.330
 building 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.909
 in a second time 12 years selected the tackle confirmed 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.770
 I present this set composed of a fortnight this time in carbon 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.650
 % to 95% 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:46.630
 so from the world of 2010 and a maximum power to authorize it of 250 grams in 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:48.660
 terms of use of pickers 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:49.640
 furniture 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.790
 entirely made of aluminum as well the frame and the shelf having 7-8 a 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:57.790
 recovery speed of 90 centimeters 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.620
 to this finished set would have added this time a trace his cautious 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:05.870
 so explains bara thiam and 25 hundredths 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:07.570
 power of this island 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:09.269
 and we can he will be 

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:12.400
 in town-bang the skin that will act as a cassander in the event that you 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.059
 will approach thieves on departure unfortunately 

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:18.059
 with a diameter of 50 hundredths and a resistance of 21 kilos 

00:02:21.419 --> 00:02:23.139
 completed 

00:02:23.139 --> 00:02:24.529
 the baptistery 

00:02:24.529 --> 00:02:28.760
 therefore composed of a cane of medicis with a power of between 100 200 

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:29.379
 grams 

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:33.069
 there is no carbon to modulate teens sic 

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:36.849
 with che a chic reel 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:40.609
 all agrippine aluminum shines thanks to a ratio so a speed of 

00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:43.729
 recovery of 95 centimeters in crank return 

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:46.849
 ap rarely a country treated anticorrosion 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:49.849
 to that we can add a braid in eighteen hundredths 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:51.899
 to hell 

00:02:51.899 --> 00:02:56.739
 with a length of 135 meters with a resistance nearby the ediles 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:57.399
 giraud 

00:02:57.399 --> 00:02:58.639
 and to finish 

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:01.639
 info carbon that always 50 cents 

00:03:05.929 --> 00:03:09.130
 following the presentation of this balance sheet seems cannes reels 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:12.680
 I will introduce you the session of the apn realized for you 

00:03:13.439 --> 00:03:16.809
 so at first the category I'm proud 

00:03:16.809 --> 00:03:18.589
 we will distinguish 

00:03:18.589 --> 00:03:22.629
 soft lures ap the second notable category to complete the 

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:25.629
 basic 

00:03:27.679 --> 00:03:30.030
 so to go back to the first category of spoons 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:34.470
 so we will note a small sale animations whether for the place we 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.529
 saw it 

00:03:36.529 --> 00:03:39.069
 at first to fish the place we will prefer 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:40.199
 the technique 

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:43.379
 say to the elevator so that will translate into animation 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:48.499
 from the descent of belgium spoon to make contact of the evening 

00:03:48.499 --> 00:03:51.569
 and back up with the sound launch of the handset 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:55.279
 and attractions from the map field up to surface to provoke a 

00:03:55.279 --> 00:03:56.739
 hunting system 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:03:59.409
 lift movement 

00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:03.840
 for the morula the criticism is different lamoureux is no longer a post 

00:04:03.839 --> 00:04:04.689
 basically 

00:04:04.689 --> 00:04:07.789
 so looking for seashells ideas and pickups just enough 

00:04:08.289 --> 00:04:12.479
 we prefer to use it for 100% and 1% and the head in the handlebars so 

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:14.580
 a slow animation 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:16.150
 and quite marked 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:18.959
 the example that will result in a rise and fall of fields to 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:20.389
 cannes 

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:24.819
 so on the ass there are two possibilities be let the triclinium added you 

00:04:24.819 --> 00:04:26.719
 grass dust 

00:04:26.719 --> 00:04:28.129
 who to believe 

00:04:28.129 --> 00:04:31.129
 in the animation of the spoon to see she swims 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:38.689
 so second category the Balinese 

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:41.689
 so the founder of the company between 10000 and submachine guns 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.380
 so it usually consists of 2 3 tons so 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:48.220
 you have to count with him 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:49.249
 katee sackhoff warm 

00:04:49.249 --> 00:04:51.580
 the pressure of the Elysee 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:52.820
 ppr gucci 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:54.830
 later disputed alas too late 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:56.309
 they call 

00:04:56.309 --> 00:04:58.120
 commonly used buses 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:02.470
 in the panorama on always worthy that mutu and agility we will prefer for the 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:05.559
 minister I had hoped we have a vehicle program 

00:05:05.559 --> 00:05:08.559
 it is called hunting 

00:05:11.439 --> 00:05:14.939
 second category and the finish is their secret so we will distinguish again 

00:05:14.939 --> 00:05:16.449
 two categories 

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:17.849
 the systems 

00:05:17.849 --> 00:05:21.969
 with the man without articulating so for a position of agent really natural and flexible 

00:05:22.839 --> 00:05:26.180
 with a texan punch could offer him an approach 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:29.669
 and systems with fixed dates 

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:33.680
 so when it's general to me that I feel depth at his door in all 

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:36.969
 from 30 to 60 meters with the choice stopped 

00:05:36.969 --> 00:05:41.019
 we will advocate shades so it is also often with friends who 

00:05:41.019 --> 00:05:44.479
 are going to have the tray be myself a lot of vibrations 

00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:47.960
 to make it easier to spot his two fish 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:50.259
 good about the animation is related 

00:05:50.259 --> 00:05:54.389
 similar techniques have been waving since yesterday so after contacting the 

00:05:54.389 --> 00:05:57.550
 funds you stay on the bottom we all made dissatisfied with the world 

00:05:58.119 --> 00:06:00.789
 animations are its minimalist brands 

00:06:00.789 --> 00:06:03.900
 according to the currents and the importance of the wreck 

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:06.360
 and especially outside the animations 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:09.360
 pulling on the bottom 

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:17.270
 the color of its importance to finish 

00:06:17.869 --> 00:06:20.659
 about greens so two possibilities 

00:06:20.659 --> 00:06:23.650
 natural colors where bright colors 

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:25.699
 recent natural colors 

00:06:25.699 --> 00:06:28.520
 still a sure value anyway also in their soup 

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:33.180
 so I really never filled up some 41 colors with the capcir 

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:36.180
 even blue colors often in the evening to the season 

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:39.300
 off are clear enough 

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:42.240
 but the flashy and predominant color all the same 

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:45.139
 because in the coastal strip back season 

00:06:45.139 --> 00:06:47.169
 as the weather windows are quite small 

00:06:47.169 --> 00:06:50.430
 you go out the need for a storm the waters are pretty simple to stop 

00:06:51.039 --> 00:06:53.919
 so the flashy color anti-vibration will be pledge of 

00:06:53.919 --> 00:06:56.919
 snow perseverance of results 

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:04.850
 finish this type of ticket not to practice a reasoned fishing 

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:08.440
 I remind you that the legal size for the game of 30 centimeters near 

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:10.419
 40 centimeters in the world 

00:07:10.419 --> 00:07:14.400
 do not hesitate to contact me at 02 31 67 cold by e-mail 

00:07:15.289 --> 00:07:18.689
 forgetting where my story potentially store 

00:07:18.689 --> 00:07:20.019
 good luck and good fishing
