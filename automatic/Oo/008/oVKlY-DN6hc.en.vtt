00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:05.299
 On a bright sunny day, it is difficult to do without polarization 

00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:06.349
 light filter. 

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:09.490
 It helps to clear the image of unnecessary glare and saturate 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:12.050
 colors - solving these two tasks will help 

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:15.789
 from any camera and lens much more. 

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:18.420
 Polarizing filter or simply extremely polarized 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.580
 necessary when shooting almost any subjects, more than he 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:23.099
 turns out to be that night. 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:24.939
 The principle of operation is quite simple. 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:27.609
 Screw the filter onto the lens and rotate this ring 

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:29.630
 change the degree of polarization. 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:32.220
 As you can see, the glare from the water disappears - this is what 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.170
 one of his main tasks. 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.180
 The effect of this filter cannot be repeated during post processing, 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.480
 This is the uniqueness of the Polaric. 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.600
 For those who have never encountered the concept 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.010
 Let us explain polarization: polarized light is simply different 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.230
 reflections from any non-metallic surfaces - water, glass 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.380
 and even trees and stones. 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:52.800
 Also note that the polarization 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.920
 filters are of two types - linear and circular. 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.820
 Here, too, everything is simple: the first are suitable for cameras with manual 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.820
 focusing, and the latter are created for the most sought after 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.440
 today SLR autofocus cameras. 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.510
 They cost about the same, but accidentally buying linear 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:09.370
 filter, do not be surprised that your new 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:13.330
 the camera will not be able to focus. 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.510
 Another feature of polarizing filters is the effect on the amount 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:18.280
 light falling on the matrix. 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.030
 You can clearly see that the filter darkens the frame, so that 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.260
 those who photograph in semi-automatic or 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.150
 automatic mode is to set compensation 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.130
 exposure at least one plus. 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.510
 Also, when choosing a filter, it is worth remembering about one more 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:31.510
 features 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:34.170
 On wide-angle lenses, thick filters due to their 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.190
 sizes can cause the photo to darken around the edges 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.229
 frames, finer filters are more expensive, but with them 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.229
 This problem will not occur. 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:44.740
 Best of all polarizing filters manifest themselves 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.800
 when shooting on a bright sunny day, near water or 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:48.800
 in the mountains. 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.260
 See how much richer and more contrast look. 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:52.810
 pictures taken with a polarizer. 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.950
 And here pay attention to the stones, the filter helped to make 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.240
 they are more expressive, the photo has become more 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:00.590
 bulk. 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.119
 The effect of the filter is especially vivid when 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:04.119
 taking pictures of the sky 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:06.950
 Dull, unintelligible colors change and add 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.009
 photos of new colors. 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:10.999
 The situation is repeated with water. 

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:13.780
 By the way, we shot such frames in a bunch of polarization 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.689
 and neutral gray filters. 

00:02:15.689 --> 00:02:18.010
 It is a neutral gray filter that allowed 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.540
 similar results, more about these filters can 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.680
 learn in the appropriate lesson. 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.629
 Polarik, as he should have, removed the glare, and made 

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:26.999
 photos more expressive. 

00:02:26.999 --> 00:02:31.340
 I would also like to draw attention to a very important 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:32.849
 rule of work with the filter. 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:35.450
 It will most effectively extinguish polarized 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.639
 light in the direction perpendicular to the sun. 

00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:40.230
 For example, if the sun is directly above you, the filter will be 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.010
 useful in any direction, but useful at sunset 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.829
 work area will be significantly reduced. 

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:48.310
 Ignorance of this feature leads many beginners. 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.219
 photographers in bewilderment. 

00:02:51.219 --> 00:02:53.799
 Another common mistake is trying to photograph 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:55.269
 panoramas with a polarizer. 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:59.310
 Unevenly removed glare just spoil it. 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.569
 Well, in the end I wanted to remind once again - the light filter, 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:05.329
 lens and camera are just helpers, much more 

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:08.340
 depends on the knowledge of the person pressing the shutter button 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:09.340
 shutter. 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.920
 Experiment and don't forget about the basic rules. 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:12.920
 photography. 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:13.920
 Well, now the contest. 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:14.920
 Throughout the video, we put the numbers - list 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:15.920
 they are all in the order in which they appeared. 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.926
 The winner will receive a pencil for cleaning optics.
