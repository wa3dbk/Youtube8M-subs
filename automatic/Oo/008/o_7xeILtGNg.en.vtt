00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 hi everyone, guys and welcome 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:05.520
 welcome to the ming it on destiny 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.470
 with the house of wolves where today 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.389
 we will go together to see some little ones 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.429
 tip and trick to complete in 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.259
 serenity the new assault that this 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.780
 week is also the night falls 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.640
 that is the thief of shadows probably 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.039
 this is actually the time 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.350
 the easiest assault to complete is 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.779
 in terms of duration because you will put in it 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.490
 really 56 minutes if in terms of 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.199
 difficulty because in the end that 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.150
 that you will have to do throughout 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.430
 the assault will enter a room 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.320
 staying there at the entrance cover yourself kill 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.750
 all and proceed calmly though 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.879
 we will also get to this now beginning 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.530
 this assault is set on the moon 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.790
 more precisely in one of the many 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.160
 enter the underground world 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.590
 of the hive with the small modification 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.360
 in fact in the sky you will see the catch or 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.640
 whatever name this cabbage has 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.379
 boss ship that you will have to face e 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.270
 consequently kill in this 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.829
 assault you will answer here for holes 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.660
 first you have to kill the two 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.820
 shouters that will be placed in front of you 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.590
 at the entrance and of course standing 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.660
 be careful not to be hit by the blows 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.119
 who will follow you sincerely I have not 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.560
 understood the usefulness of these two shouters 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.330
 here because they are pretty easy to 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.280
 kill are the only enemies and 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.350
 objectively speaking they could also 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.520
 don't put them let's say they are there for 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.140
 make a good impression 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.880
 we say so once you are there 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.770
 enter into this dungeon vi 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.479
 it will all seem familiar because if there 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.549
 You will do if it is here that there will be the 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.590
 first mission to the moon and continuing 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.299
 you will also notice that always here yes 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.070
 they will perform the penultimate mice on one 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.030
 moon where the various boxes will be taken 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.770
 gold and so on 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.090
 in any case, don't worry if 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.740
 you should see some broken walls 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.570
 some open walls 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.250
 we say that the fallen have done a little 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.470
 restructuring in any case 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.240
 quietly continued blows first 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.100
 the enemies of the hive later 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.110
 you will arrive in an area that will also bring 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.939
 to the mission of crotta on awakening in 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.680
 you will find that large circular area 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.180
 both a tree and one has fallen 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.009
 they will fight you calmly 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.540
 quietly killed two orcs who 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.430
 the jersey is a major danger 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.689
 hard and then you dedicate yourself to the fallen 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.490
 then continue towards 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.079
 left has gone on up to 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.909
 reach a large room in the 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.619
 rock with a transporter on it 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:07.079
 gravitational lift more than anything else 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:09.259
 for the result it is the same to kill 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:10.640
 calmly all the enemies that churn out 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:12.439
 always stay back because of a certain 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.329
 point will also come the boss to make you 

00:02:12.439 --> 00:02:16.250
 visit the hermitage that will hold this bag 

00:02:14.329 --> 00:02:17.840
 the hot cannon will have what they have 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.299
 introduced as a relic so to speak 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.950
 with this dlc unless there are 

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:23.689
 playing delays won't be such a weapon 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.610
 such harmful as these 

00:02:23.689 --> 00:02:27.440
 weeks in fact there were embers 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.310
 of the bow and went to play one 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.959
 walk 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.120
 the fallen to the electric shields then 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:33.799
 take electric weapons massacred them 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.390
 closed this little parenthesis though 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:37.579
 quietly kill all the 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.200
 friends do damage to the post until 

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:41.030
 do not become immune and will go away 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.280
 with teleport what you will have to 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.930
 do it will follow him of ignorance and it 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.250
 you will follow right up into his 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.319
 great ship 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.720
 brilliant no chasing an enemy inside the 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:52.250
 his cabbage stronghold but saw that we 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.690
 guardians with our spectrum that 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.010
 all of a sudden it became a 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.840
 character from a silent film 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.879
 we continue undeterred for ours 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.829
 road once inside the scenarios vi 

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:02.269
 will seem quite familiar to you 

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:04.340
 however , we would already have several rooms 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:06.829
 seen or otherwise we would have seen rooms 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.599
 like back in cash, and the call of Berne 

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:10.790
 mission of history and continue 

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:12.500
 always using the usual start strategy 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:14.449
 room you cover well for blows i 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.730
 enemies which hit the boss when 

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:18.620
 will appear and continue to a certain extent 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.900
 point where a lot will happen 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:23.299
 a walker will fall from the ceiling 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.980
 of the fallen in this case blue because 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:27.319
 precisely the house to the wolves to this how 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:29.150
 particular color you remember the spider 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:31.010
 the giant tank before seti 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.260
 same thing only with me news is 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:35.000
 Easier to pull down there 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.650
 are many covers both on the left and 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.209
 to the right that in the middle what 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:40.459
 have to do is, as usual, 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:41.989
 beat it by first striking it by doing it 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:43.459
 then fall uncover the core the 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:45.769
 engine I have not yet figured out which of the 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:46.910
 two both and then hit it there but been 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:49.099
 very careful that on the left 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:51.500
 enemies will come with the body body 

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:53.750
 very invisible and will seem not to have 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:55.519
 meaning this sentence very invisible but 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:57.290
 invisibility in the house of wolves 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:59.120
 seems to work much more than in 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:01.639
 house of devils all the families before 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:03.889
 seen if an enemy stands still he runs 

00:04:01.639 --> 00:04:05.720
 meeting I find it much more difficult 

00:04:03.889 --> 00:04:07.040
 to be identified and honestly I can not 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:08.720
 to explain me in the reason 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.430
 however, this is the situation 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.620
 so be careful left by 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:14.359
 invisible enemies in the center on the 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.280
 bulkhead at the bottom of the snipers 

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:18.380
 on the right , new ones will arrive 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:19.430
 bomb stilettos because there was no 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:21.109
 a pecorino the bales 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:23.300
 gold let's also put a bomb on 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:24.620
 on him but it won't be much of a problem though 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:27.169
 you will be careful because anyway 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:29.300
 die once killed with two shots 

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:30.710
 even the walker can move forward 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.389
 quietly because all friends 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:33.770
 present in that area will disappear and 

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:35.419
 simply outcasts will come 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:37.370
 from the center to the door that will open 

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:39.169
 carry on continue arriving in the 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:41.030
 penultimate room and is here on 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:42.770
 situation will be much easier because 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:44.900
 you will have to kill some losers 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:46.400
 him that nothing too complicated 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:48.020
 once again to the boss that will appear 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.150
 new stilettos that this time will have 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:52.099
 under magati apparently in this 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:53.690
 dlc have focused much more 

00:04:52.099 --> 00:04:55.280
 on stilettos but on everything else but 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:56.810
 also eros and they are beautiful to see 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:58.400
 so that's fine with me 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:00.050
 continue along the corridors 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.150
 they will precede the final room where 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:03.710
 you'll have to finally fight tunick 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:05.870
 scarred once you arrive there 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:07.940
 wait until it just appears 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:09.560
 after which you will be free to slaughter it 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:11.660
 massacre it in what probably 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:13.550
 the boss fight is the easiest the whole 

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:15.169
 game because it will die in very few 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:17.210
 second his henchmen will arrive 

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:18.919
 after an hour and with active arms 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:20.389
 that without massacring it net with one 

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:21.590
 disarming ease 

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:23.210
 shoot him all you have 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:24.889
 however it will not be full life because 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:27.590
 the one that you removed prior to 

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:30.050
 contrary to omnibus remains removed not the 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:31.490
 recover and not massacred in the index 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:33.680
 they will come, I think, they are outcasts 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:35.630
 but I can't tell you with stilettos 

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:36.949
 accuracy over time how many 

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:40.010
 they'll come because I've always killed him 

00:05:36.949 --> 00:05:41.599
 20 to 30 seconds light one minute or so 

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:43.430
 so I never had the time 

00:05:41.599 --> 00:05:44.780
 to see all the enemies they should 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:46.520
 to get off I think honestly 

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:47.750
 but also that you will make it with 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:49.610
 just as easy 

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:51.590
 so guys that's all for how much 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:53.449
 regards the thief of shadows or the 

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:55.220
