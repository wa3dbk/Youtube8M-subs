 hello how am I kicker night and this is 

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:08.860
 prism tutorials I'm sorry I could not 

00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:10.660
 upload other videos this week I've been 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:12.669
 has been making this video clip that you 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:14.400
 I leave here is a video of my group 

00:00:12.669 --> 00:00:16.480
 where I play the guitar and such but good 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.640
 after this advertising 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:21.130
 let's see how to rename images in 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:23.320
 lots and change the size 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:25.900
 we started by selecting the all for 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.910
 I spike and drag and to change them 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:30.039
 the name we are going to open to tools and 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:31.990
 change batch name there you have the 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:34.270
 direct access ok we get this 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:35.710
 window where we can change 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:37.420
 various adjustments here we have the ones that 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.880
 we have used predetermined last time 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:42.310
 etcetera here we have the folder where 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:44.020
 is going to be saved we can choose what 

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:46.810
 to change the name of the same folder 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:48.970
 to move it to another folder that I copied 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:51.550
 as I want, I usually leave it in the 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:53.470
 same folder that you have here is the 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:55.270
 name of the file if you click on the 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:57.430
 tab you can choose several I'll take 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:59.970
 text and I'll call it the prism 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:59.970
 tutorials 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.920
 it's worth it down here you can see it's called 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.570
 prism tutorial the jpg but we have 11 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.890
 then files can not be called 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.229
 all the same to differentiate them from 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.030
 some way we're going to give here more and 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.350
 let's add another tab that is for 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:18.229
 example as a sequence number 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:20.090
 and I start from 1 and here below 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:22.189
 you can see that it would be called in 0 0 1 by 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.659
 the next one would be 0 0 2 etc. you can 

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:25.790
 change the digits to make it in this 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:29.149
 case 0 1 as are 11 images os 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:32.600
 I recommend that you put these digits for 

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:34.580
 that go from 0 1 to 11 is worth and here in 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.530
 options we have finally keep the 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.060
 name of the current file this is in case 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.830
 someday we want to see what his name was 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.080
 the image before but good I do not 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:43.560
 I'm really active, we're going to change 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.689
 first name 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.280
 and we already have it from prism tutorials 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:50.560
 01 to 11 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.330
 ok so let's see now how to change 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.640
 format many images at once or 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:58.600
 even the quality and size for it 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.890
 we are going to come to photoshop tools and 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.479
 here you have a series of actions that 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.340
 can do with photoshop from 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:05.680
 bridge such as loading the 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.390
 images as layers combine for hdr 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.220
 good many things but what really 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.530
 I'm interested is this here the 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.330
 Click image processor 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.940
 directly open photoshop and this 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.680
 here we will first choose the 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.540
 folder here in select folder 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.269
 where we want these to be saved 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.489
 copies we give here to the folder that is 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:26.739
 open and we choose the format and or 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:29.560
 I want to save as jpg with quality for 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:31.209
 example of 6 there on the right you can see 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.400
 also what can I resize the 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:34.900
 I can change the size even 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.360
 even in several formats at the same time as 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:40.130
 for example ti flavia save jpg and in 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:42.500
 tiff could also resize 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:44.540
 It is also valid to have here to execute 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.490
 action if you want to give some 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.350
 option that here I leave tutorial that already 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:49.940
 we did to create actions and 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:51.500
 process them in batches for example 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.890
 we could focus all but good 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.319
 I am not going to do it 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:58.990
 and when you have everything, you have already chosen 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:03:01.870
 once here to run 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:04.300
 and in this process we have now achieved 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:08.770
 copies of these images in jpg with low 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:10.210
 quality and in tiff it's worth we already have it and 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:12.040
 here in the same folder because there was 

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:14.830
 chosen the same I have a folder of 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:18.069
 jpg with all the images reform you 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:19.930
 fairies and that of the tiff 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:21.849
 well nothing this has been the tutorial of the 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.709
 week I hope you find it useful on 

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:26.709
 all when you're working with many 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:29.219
 images at once a hug and see you 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:29.219
 in the next
