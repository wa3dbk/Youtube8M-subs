00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:11.420
 Hi Shintaro I'm in today's video, how to fix my lashes with my hair dryer 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:16.520
 I want to deliver on the subject of 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:22.780
 Will bounce to the left and right bangs curly hair bangs is a concern 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:28.600
 I think that there are many who think that they want to make bangs parting in a more straightened state 

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:30.160
 So I say kinda got bangs is floating when the straight perm and hair straightening and 

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:34.570
 There is a sense of discomfort 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:38.570
 If you can do it, I would like to see straight before with the current hair quality 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:46.460
 I would like to see it by all means if you think so 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:48.510
 Is actually hair from side to side chat if Jupiter brat in and make a parting in a state that has been growth in my own hair 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:54.420
 Will it bounced 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:58.100
 So with the above all a hurry and in hours of the morning to would damage the hair even with the iron to say 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:04.040
 No such thing afford to there to the iron 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:06.740
 So today, how to fix bangs easily using a dryer 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:10.840
 I would like to introduce 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:16.860
 a First of all, after the bath is wet 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:20.190
 Apply the dryer to the bangs and make the bangs light up 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:23.050
 At this time, rather than drying to the end 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:28.120
 Keep the version awake 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:31.180
 Why do you say that you first make the bangs light up ? 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:38.370
 If you straighten your hair from the beginning 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:45.030
 That's because the bangs are so embarrassing to the forehead that they become a bit uncomfortable. 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:47.840
 So make your hair straight and let the stop machine float naturally on the bangs first. 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:53.119
 I will give to 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:02:00.590
 I'm going to work on making my bangs straight from here, but before that 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:02:03.630
 If there is an old toment such as a moisturizer it will be several centimeters above from the root to the hair end 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:08.910
 I will put an appropriate amount 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:10.110
 Why do you put this on ? I will hit the hair dryer and straighten my hair 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:17.340
 Because 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:18.740
 To protect the hair with a such as Well in advance moisturizer because it becomes a little because there is no good easy 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.680
 deep 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:26.360
 There is a role called 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:32.160
 It is work to keep straight the bangs of the heart to 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:39.090
 First take in hand together degree handful bangs you want to immediately 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:40.120
 I feel like pouring the hair dryer from the root to the tip of the hair while pulling lightly again and again. 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:45.459
 I will 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:50.950
 At this time, if you pull on the part of the feeling with the feeling that the bangs are inward 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:57.610
 It is difficult to return and last longer than just straightening 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:59.720
 Hair against the Reifu in the state that picked the paper When you rely on the dryer until firmly dry 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:06.710
 I will dye 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:09.430
 This is a cuticle that is on the surface of the hair and closes a fish scale like this and the hair is damaged 

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:15.910
 Because it has the effect of making it difficult 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:22.030
 With the above flow you can straighten your bangs 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:25.600
 I think whether there is individual difference in the effect in the degree of Kiseshita, but rather than drying with a dryer normally 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:30.850
 Before no students can make b 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:35.930
 And if you want to keep this straight bangs as long as possible 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:38.080
 Wearing a super hard hair spray well, bangs 8 days 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:41.600
 It would be good to reserve it 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:48.860
 Just hard spray to harden Gachigachi is 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:53.819
 If you use it too much, it may damage your hair, so today you are clearly stated today 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:58.739
 It is better to use pinpoint on the day you want to 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:04:04.620
 The above is how to straighten the bangs with the design 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:08.310
 However, the method introduced this time is only temporary. 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:11.430
 It's not a fundamental solution 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:17.880

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:21.750
