rifle<00:00:18.380> tried<00:00:19.380> to<00:00:19.470> make<00:00:19.619> this<00:00:19.830> scope

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:23.980 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:25.920 

it<00:00:24.490> doesn't<00:00:24.880> really<00:00:24.970> zoom<00:00:25.330> in<00:00:25.540> or<00:00:25.690> anything

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:25.930 
it doesn't really zoom in or anything

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:32.040 
it doesn't really zoom in or anything
it's<00:00:26.230> kind<00:00:26.800> of<00:00:26.890> a<00:00:27.040> CQB<00:00:27.790> scope<00:00:28.210> and<00:00:29.760> I<00:00:31.020> put<00:00:32.020> a

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:32.050 
it's kind of a CQB scope and I put a

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:38.670 
it's kind of a CQB scope and I put a
little<00:00:32.230> shade<00:00:32.529> here<00:00:34.020> and<00:00:36.510> it<00:00:37.510> aims<00:00:37.690> all<00:00:38.260> right

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:38.680 
little shade here and it aims all right

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.310 
little shade here and it aims all right
if<00:00:39.010> there's<00:00:39.160> light<00:00:39.489> out<00:00:39.700> but<00:00:40.330> it<00:00:40.540> it's<00:00:41.050> kind<00:00:41.260> of

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:41.320 
if there's light out but it it's kind of

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.700 
if there's light out but it it's kind of
dark<00:00:41.530> you<00:00:41.739> got<00:00:41.890> a<00:00:41.920> light<00:00:42.160> here<00:00:43.350> just<00:00:44.350> in<00:00:44.500> case

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:44.710 
dark you got a light here just in case

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:49.470 
dark you got a light here just in case
and<00:00:45.660> this<00:00:46.660> is<00:00:46.750> a<00:00:46.870> shotgun<00:00:47.640> but<00:00:48.640> it<00:00:49.030> goes<00:00:49.239> pretty

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:49.480 
and this is a shotgun but it goes pretty

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.119 
and this is a shotgun but it goes pretty
far<00:00:49.780> and<00:00:49.960> pretty<00:00:50.170> straight<00:00:50.530> so<00:00:50.830> I<00:00:50.890> made<00:00:51.100> it

00:00:51.119 --> 00:00:51.129 
far and pretty straight so I made it

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:53.910 
far and pretty straight so I made it
into<00:00:51.250> a<00:00:51.430> sniper<00:00:51.760> and<00:00:52.540> it's<00:00:53.260> suppressed<00:00:53.650> as

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:53.920 
into a sniper and it's suppressed as

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.200

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:16.330 
pretty much all the features are good we

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.420 
pretty much all the features are good we
got<00:01:16.540> one<00:01:16.960> the<00:01:17.170> red<00:01:17.350> dot<00:01:17.560> sight<00:01:17.890> that<00:01:18.070> they<00:01:18.250> have

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:18.430 
got one the red dot sight that they have

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:21.330 
got one the red dot sight that they have
it's<00:01:19.360> pretty<00:01:20.170> good<00:01:20.380> I<00:01:20.619> don't<00:01:20.860> have<00:01:20.979> batteries

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.340 
it's pretty good I don't have batteries

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.520 
it's pretty good I don't have batteries
for<00:01:21.369> it<00:01:21.640> right<00:01:21.790> now<00:01:21.820> but<00:01:22.299> there's<00:01:22.690> a<00:01:23.110> red<00:01:23.320> dot

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530 
for it right now but there's a red dot

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.899 
for it right now but there's a red dot
there<00:01:23.770> that<00:01:23.799> I<00:01:24.040> made<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:26.799> silencer<00:01:27.460> and<00:01:27.760> the

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:27.909 
there that I made the silencer and the

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:31.260 
there that I made the silencer and the
light<00:01:28.090> of<00:01:28.270> course<00:01:28.539> I<00:01:29.670> had<00:01:30.670> a<00:01:30.700> blue<00:01:31.030> light

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.270 
light of course I had a blue light

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.569 
light of course I had a blue light
though<00:01:31.539> cuz<00:01:32.049> I<00:01:32.469> think<00:01:32.859> that's<00:01:33.250> better<00:01:33.490> for

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:33.579 
though cuz I think that's better for

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:39.480 
though cuz I think that's better for
night<00:01:34.119> battles<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:36.460> clip<00:01:36.700> on<00:01:36.850> the<00:01:36.969> side<00:01:37.000> a<00:01:38.490> day

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490 
night battles the clip on the side a day

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:44.190 
night battles the clip on the side a day
use<00:01:39.759> from<00:01:40.119> a<00:01:40.299> spear<00:01:40.750> clip<00:01:42.899> this<00:01:43.899> is<00:01:44.049> all

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
use from a spear clip this is all

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.599 
use from a spear clip this is all
pump-action<00:01:46.799> so<00:01:47.799> it's<00:01:47.979> not<00:01:48.130> really<00:01:48.460> an

00:01:48.599 --> 00:01:48.609 
pump-action so it's not really an

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:51.569 
pump-action so it's not really an
electric<00:01:49.119> gun<00:01:49.299> but<00:01:49.630> it<00:01:50.619> works<00:01:50.829> pretty<00:01:51.070> good

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:51.579 
electric gun but it works pretty good

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:55.200 
electric gun but it works pretty good
it<00:01:52.420> goes<00:01:52.630> straight<00:01:52.899> but<00:01:53.439> not<00:01:53.740> that<00:01:54.100> far<00:01:54.369> but

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.210 
it goes straight but not that far but

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:58.830 
it goes straight but not that far but
it's<00:01:55.420> a<00:01:55.509> good<00:01:55.659> SMG<00:01:56.609> so<00:01:57.609> those<00:01:58.090> are<00:01:58.210> my<00:01:58.299> two<00:01:58.359> halo

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 
it's a good SMG so those are my two halo

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:04.090 
it's a good SMG so those are my two halo
guns

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100

and<00:02:05.710> here's<00:02:06.710> this<00:02:06.979> strange<00:02:07.550> gun<00:02:07.970> that<00:02:08.570> had

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.710 

that<00:02:12.920> I<00:02:13.220> don't<00:02:13.520> know<00:02:13.640> exactly<00:02:13.790> what<00:02:14.390> to<00:02:14.510> call

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
that I don't know exactly what to call

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:20.199 
that I don't know exactly what to call
it<00:02:17.890> some<00:02:18.890> of<00:02:18.920> my<00:02:19.100> friends<00:02:19.490> say<00:02:19.670> it's<00:02:19.850> as<00:02:19.970> fast

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:20.209

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:25.449 
it some of my friends say it's as fast
well<00:02:21.340> but<00:02:22.340> I<00:02:22.850> don't<00:02:23.630> think<00:02:23.959> it<00:02:24.110> is<00:02:24.260> it's<00:02:25.010> very

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459 
well but I don't think it is it's very

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:33.400 
well but I don't think it is it's very
accurate<00:02:25.780> Pig<00:02:26.780> shells<00:02:30.280> and<00:02:32.080> this<00:02:33.080> thing<00:02:33.290> is

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
accurate Pig shells and this thing is

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:35.860 
accurate Pig shells and this thing is
pretty<00:02:33.590> good<00:02:33.860> has<00:02:34.430> two<00:02:34.910> flashlights<00:02:35.540> on<00:02:35.780> the

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
pretty good has two flashlights on the

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:44.980 
pretty good has two flashlights on the
side

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:44.990 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:47.860 

so<00:02:45.590> he<00:02:46.010> my<00:02:46.370> friend<00:02:46.520> usually<00:02:47.000> uses<00:02:47.390> this<00:02:47.570> for

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
so he my friend usually uses this for

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.550 
so he my friend usually uses this for
