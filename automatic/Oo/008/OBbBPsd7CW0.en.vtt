important to note that those products

whatsoever<00:01:16.280> so<00:01:17.280> it's<00:01:17.430> important<00:01:17.939> that<00:01:18.000> we

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
whatsoever so it's important that we

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.780 
whatsoever so it's important that we
tell<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.600> remote<00:01:18.990> that<00:01:19.979> we're<00:01:20.159> controlling<00:01:20.610> a

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
tell the remote that we're controlling a

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.780 
tell the remote that we're controlling a
TMCC<00:01:21.540> one<00:01:21.750> locomotive<00:01:22.250> instead<00:01:23.250> of<00:01:23.369> a<00:01:23.430> legacy

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.940 
TMCC one locomotive instead of a legacy
engine<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:25.020> reason<00:01:25.380> for<00:01:25.530> that<00:01:25.650> is<00:01:25.920> because

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
engine the reason for that is because

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.490 
engine the reason for that is because
the<00:01:26.400> legacy<00:01:26.580> base<00:01:27.000> actually<00:01:27.360> broadcasts<00:01:28.320> two

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
the legacy base actually broadcasts two

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.460 
the legacy base actually broadcasts two

different signals in legacy control it

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.980 
different signals in legacy control it

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
the train itself which allows you to

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
track train on the track and get it

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.479 
track train on the track and get it

into your cab to legacy remote and tell

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:55.819 
into your cab to legacy remote and tell
it<00:02:54.090> that<00:02:54.299> the<00:02:54.450> control<00:02:54.870> mode<00:02:55.109> or<00:02:55.379> the<00:02:55.500> control

type<00:02:56.099> is<00:02:56.370> cap<00:02:56.819> one<00:02:58.069> the<00:02:59.069> reason<00:02:59.459> for<00:02:59.609> that<00:02:59.669> is

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
type is cap one the reason for that is

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.080 
type is cap one the reason for that is

trackmobile which it does not respond to
doesn't<00:03:08.549> understand<00:03:08.939> and<00:03:09.120> therefore<00:03:09.269> will

the either the legacy base or the TMCC

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:23.559 
the either the legacy base or the TMCC
one<00:03:20.699> command<00:03:21.090> base<00:03:21.500> so<00:03:22.500> before<00:03:22.919> we<00:03:23.069> get<00:03:23.190> this

00:03:23.559 --> 00:03:23.569 
one command base so before we get this

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:25.490 
one command base so before we get this
trackmobile<00:03:24.569> running<00:03:24.959> we<00:03:25.049> need<00:03:25.079> to<00:03:25.260> program

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
trackmobile running we need to program

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:26.080 
trackmobile running we need to program
it

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
it

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.250 
it
typically<00:03:27.090> the<00:03:27.269> trackmobiles<00:03:27.810> don't<00:03:28.079> have

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
typically the trackmobiles don't have

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.289 
typically the trackmobiles don't have
cab<00:03:28.500> numbers<00:03:28.889> on<00:03:29.040> them<00:03:29.280> so<00:03:29.790> you've<00:03:29.970> just<00:03:30.000> got

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 
cab numbers on them so you've just got

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:33.170 
cab numbers on them so you've just got
to<00:03:30.329> make<00:03:30.540> a<00:03:30.599> generic<00:03:31.500> selection<00:03:32.280> for<00:03:33.090> this

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
to make a generic selection for this

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.909 
to make a generic selection for this
instance<00:03:33.599> we're<00:03:33.750> going<00:03:33.870> to<00:03:33.930> choose<00:03:34.109> engine<00:03:34.500> 50

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:34.919 
instance we're going to choose engine 50

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:37.280 
instance we're going to choose engine 50
so<00:03:35.790> what<00:03:35.909> you<00:03:36.030> do<00:03:36.150> is<00:03:36.299> take<00:03:36.479> the<00:03:36.659> track<00:03:36.989> and<00:03:37.169> be

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
so what you do is take the track and be

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.309 
so what you do is take the track and be
off<00:03:37.470> the<00:03:37.620> track<00:03:38.569> locate<00:03:39.569> the<00:03:39.690> program<00:03:40.109> run

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:40.319 
off the track locate the program run

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:42.319 
off the track locate the program run
switch<00:03:40.620> and<00:03:40.889> place<00:03:41.549> it<00:03:41.729> in<00:03:41.819> the<00:03:41.909> program

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:42.329 
switch and place it in the program

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:46.449 
switch and place it in the program
position<00:03:43.310> place<00:03:44.310> it<00:03:44.489> back<00:03:44.609> on<00:03:44.790> the<00:03:44.909> track<00:03:45.180> and

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:46.459 
position place it back on the track and

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:50.569 
position place it back on the track and
apply<00:03:47.459> power<00:03:49.010> now<00:03:50.010> when<00:03:50.190> power<00:03:50.400> is<00:03:50.519> applied

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:50.579 
apply power now when power is applied

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:53.750 
apply power now when power is applied
the<00:03:51.120> interior<00:03:51.659> cab<00:03:51.900> light<00:03:52.169> comes<00:03:52.440> on<00:03:52.650> and<00:03:53.010> the

separately<00:05:54.560> it's<00:05:55.560> a<00:05:55.620> great<00:05:56.010> little<00:05:56.160> model<00:05:56.700> to

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:56.970 
separately it's a great little model to

00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:59.000 
separately it's a great little model to
switch<00:05:57.330> cars<00:05:57.630> around<00:05:57.900> in<00:05:58.169> a<00:05:58.229> small<00:05:58.500> yard

00:05:59.000 --> 00:05:59.010 
switch cars around in a small yard

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:02.690 
switch cars around in a small yard
even<00:05:59.490> a<00:05:59.550> larger<00:05:59.970> yard<00:06:00.320> it<00:06:01.320> is<00:06:01.530> a<00:06:01.560> diecast<00:06:02.130> model

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:02.700 
even a larger yard it is a diecast model

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:05.090 
even a larger yard it is a diecast model
so<00:06:02.940> it<00:06:03.060> is<00:06:03.150> a<00:06:03.330> pretty<00:06:03.690> heavy<00:06:03.960> for<00:06:04.080> its<00:06:04.350> size<00:06:04.440> it

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:05.100 
so it is a pretty heavy for its size it

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:07.570 
so it is a pretty heavy for its size it
doesn't<00:06:05.490> have<00:06:05.580> a<00:06:05.640> lot<00:06:05.850> of<00:06:05.880> brute<00:06:06.210> force<00:06:06.240> to<00:06:06.600> it

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:07.580 
doesn't have a lot of brute force to it

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:10.909 
doesn't have a lot of brute force to it

the<00:06:11.070> model<00:06:11.490> are<00:06:11.940> spaced<00:06:12.270> pretty<00:06:12.600> far<00:06:12.810> apart<00:06:13.140> so

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:13.440 
the model are spaced pretty far apart so

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:16.130 
the model are spaced pretty far apart so
it's<00:06:13.860> designed<00:06:14.250> to<00:06:14.340> get<00:06:14.580> over<00:06:14.850> switches<00:06:15.390> in<00:06:15.630> a
