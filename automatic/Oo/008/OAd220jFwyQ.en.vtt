00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
steel frame using many coiled springs so

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.400 
steel frame using many coiled springs so
here<00:00:40.950> there's<00:00:41.129> little<00:00:41.399> Springs<00:00:41.879> all<00:00:42.570> along

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
here there's little Springs all along

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.610 
here there's little Springs all along
the<00:00:43.590> outside<00:00:43.770> of<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:44.760> trampoline<00:00:45.539> here<00:00:45.840> and

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
the outside of the trampoline here and

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.619 
the outside of the trampoline here and
the<00:00:46.770> people<00:00:47.390> bounce<00:00:48.390> off<00:00:48.750> of<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:49.440> trampoline

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:50.629 
the people bounce off of the trampoline

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:53.630 
the people bounce off of the trampoline
so<00:00:51.629> people<00:00:51.870> bounce<00:00:52.110> on<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:53.010> trampoline<00:00:53.039> or

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
so people bounce on the trampoline or

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.689 
so people bounce on the trampoline or
you<00:00:53.850> can<00:00:54.000> say<00:00:54.120> bounce<00:00:54.390> off<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:54.899> trampoline

00:00:55.689 --> 00:00:55.699 
you can say bounce off the trampoline

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:58.520 
you can say bounce off the trampoline
because<00:00:56.699> you're<00:00:56.910> going<00:00:57.120> on<00:00:57.360> and<00:00:57.660> then<00:00:57.750> off<00:00:57.989> so

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
because you're going on and then off so

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.060 
because you're going on and then off so
you<00:00:58.620> can<00:00:58.710> say<00:00:58.859> people<00:00:59.129> bounce<00:00:59.340> on<00:00:59.699> or<00:01:00.120> off

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070 
you can say people bounce on or off

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.139 
you can say people bounce on or off
trampolines<00:01:02.070> for<00:01:02.190> recreational<00:01:03.030> and

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
trampolines for recreational and

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.750 
trampolines for recreational and
competitive<00:01:03.449> purposes<00:01:04.549> recreational<00:01:05.549> just

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
competitive purposes recreational just

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.850 
competitive purposes recreational just
means<00:01:05.909> for<00:01:06.240> fun<00:01:06.570> like<00:01:07.200> this<00:01:07.380> person<00:01:07.710> is<00:01:07.770> doing

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
means for fun like this person is doing

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.590 
means for fun like this person is doing
it<00:01:08.040> for<00:01:08.070> fun<00:01:08.490> but<00:01:09.240> you<00:01:09.330> could<00:01:09.479> do<00:01:09.570> a

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
it for fun but you could do a

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.710 
it for fun but you could do a
competitive<00:01:10.290> competitive<00:01:10.979> trampoline<00:01:11.490> like

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:11.720 
competitive competitive trampoline like

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.750 
competitive competitive trampoline like
in<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:12.810> Olympics<00:01:13.310> wonder<00:01:14.310> if<00:01:14.369> they<00:01:14.490> have<00:01:14.610> a

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
in the Olympics wonder if they have a

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:20.300 
in the Olympics wonder if they have a
picture<00:01:15.150> here<00:01:18.680> yeah<00:01:19.680> there<00:01:20.040> we<00:01:20.159> go

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
picture here yeah there we go

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.310 
picture here yeah there we go
so<00:01:20.820> here's<00:01:21.000> competitive<00:01:21.659> trampoline<00:01:22.170> they

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
so here's competitive trampoline they

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.590 
so here's competitive trampoline they
jump<00:01:22.560> on<00:01:22.710> here<00:01:22.979> and<00:01:23.159> they<00:01:23.250> start<00:01:23.729> flipping

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
jump on here and they start flipping

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:30.460 
jump on here and they start flipping
around<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:28.009> fabric<00:01:29.009> on<00:01:29.189> which<00:01:29.400> users<00:01:29.790> bounce

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:30.470 
around the fabric on which users bounce

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.499 
around the fabric on which users bounce
commonly<00:01:31.470> known<00:01:31.680> as<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.640> bounce<00:01:32.880> mat<00:01:33.240> or

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
commonly known as the bounce mat or

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.280 
commonly known as the bounce mat or
trampoline<00:01:34.079> bed<00:01:34.320> is<00:01:34.560> not<00:01:34.979> elastic<00:01:35.310> itself

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:36.290 
trampoline bed is not elastic itself

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:39.140 
trampoline bed is not elastic itself
elastic<00:01:37.290> means<00:01:37.470> stretchy<00:01:37.860> like<00:01:38.340> you<00:01:38.790> hit<00:01:39.000> it

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
elastic means stretchy like you hit it

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.770 
elastic means stretchy like you hit it
and<00:01:39.509> it<00:01:40.049> stretches<00:01:40.799> down<00:01:41.369> and<00:01:42.060> then<00:01:42.329> stretches

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
and it stretches down and then stretches

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.670 
and it stretches down and then stretches
back<00:01:43.340> so<00:01:44.340> that's<00:01:44.659> elastic<00:01:45.659> so<00:01:46.439> it's<00:01:46.590> not

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
back so that's elastic so it's not

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.690 
back so that's elastic so it's not
elastic<00:01:47.250> in<00:01:47.369> itself<00:01:47.670> the<00:01:47.939> elasticity<00:01:48.420> is

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
elastic in itself the elasticity is

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:55.270 
elastic in itself the elasticity is
provided<00:01:50.700> by<00:01:51.170> Springs<00:01:52.340> so<00:01:53.340> we<00:01:54.060> say<00:01:54.240> elasticity

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
provided by Springs so we say elasticity

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:01.910 
provided by Springs so we say elasticity
to<00:01:56.780> refer<00:01:57.780> to<00:01:57.810> this<00:01:58.850> being<00:01:59.850> elastic<00:02:00.479> so<00:02:00.920> we

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
to refer to this being elastic so we

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.969 
to refer to this being elastic so we
could<00:02:02.100> say<00:02:02.930> the<00:02:03.930> elasticity<00:02:04.530> of<00:02:04.770> the

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
could say the elasticity of the

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.510 
could say the elasticity of the
trampoline<00:02:05.759> is<00:02:06.090> very<00:02:06.689> high<00:02:06.990> if<00:02:07.380> it<00:02:07.860> has<00:02:08.129> a<00:02:08.160> lot

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
trampoline is very high if it has a lot

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.619 
trampoline is very high if it has a lot
of<00:02:08.550> bounce<00:02:09.030> to<00:02:09.450> it<00:02:10.550> so<00:02:11.550> the<00:02:11.670> elasticity<00:02:12.239> is

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
of bounce to it so the elasticity is

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:13.940 
of bounce to it so the elasticity is
provided<00:02:13.349> by

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
provided by

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.150 
provided by
Springs<00:02:14.459> which<00:02:14.879> connect<00:02:15.510> to<00:02:15.629> the<00:02:15.810> frame<00:02:16.260> this

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
Springs which connect to the frame this

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.089 
Springs which connect to the frame this
is<00:02:17.370> the<00:02:17.400> frame<00:02:17.910> this<00:02:18.239> whole<00:02:18.480> outer<00:02:19.200> part<00:02:19.680> here

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:20.099 
is the frame this whole outer part here

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:23.380 
is the frame this whole outer part here
and<00:02:20.510> the<00:02:21.510> springs<00:02:22.019> what<00:02:22.650> if<00:02:22.739> we<00:02:22.860> have<00:02:22.980> springs

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
and the springs what if we have springs

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:28.640 
and the springs what if we have springs
in<00:02:24.390> the<00:02:25.200> spring<00:02:26.060> these<00:02:27.060> are<00:02:27.269> springs<00:02:27.660> also

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
in the spring these are springs also

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.490 
in the spring these are springs also
known<00:02:29.040> oil<00:02:29.250> Springs<00:02:30.000> see<00:02:30.420> the<00:02:30.540> word<00:02:30.660> coil<00:02:31.140> here

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
known oil Springs see the word coil here

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.199 
known oil Springs see the word coil here
because<00:02:32.220> a<00:02:32.250> coil<00:02:32.640> goes<00:02:32.940> around<00:02:33.300> like<00:02:33.720> that

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
because a coil goes around like that

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:38.030 
because a coil goes around like that
it's<00:02:36.209> a<00:02:36.269> coil<00:02:36.599> spring<00:02:36.720> so<00:02:37.560> here<00:02:37.739> it<00:02:37.830> says<00:02:37.860> a

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
it's a coil spring so here it says a

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.770 
it's a coil spring so here it says a
spring<00:02:38.489> is<00:02:38.730> an<00:02:38.940> elastic<00:02:39.569> object<00:02:40.190> it's<00:02:41.190> elastic

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
spring is an elastic object it's elastic

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.680 
spring is an elastic object it's elastic
because<00:02:42.780> we<00:02:43.530> can<00:02:43.709> stretch<00:02:44.040> it<00:02:44.330> so<00:02:45.330> anything

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
because we can stretch it so anything

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.920 
because we can stretch it so anything
that<00:02:45.720> can<00:02:45.959> be<00:02:46.110> stretched<00:02:46.590> is<00:02:47.030> elastic<00:02:48.030> so<00:02:48.900> a

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
that can be stretched is elastic so a

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.289 
that can be stretched is elastic so a
spring<00:02:49.440> is<00:02:49.650> an<00:02:49.860> elastic<00:02:50.370> object<00:02:50.849> used<00:02:51.120> to

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:51.299 
spring is an elastic object used to

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:54.530 
spring is an elastic object used to
store<00:02:51.690> mechanical<00:02:52.560> energy<00:02:53.329> Springs<00:02:54.329> are

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
store mechanical energy Springs are

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.520 
store mechanical energy Springs are
usually<00:02:55.049> made<00:02:55.260> out<00:02:55.500> of<00:02:55.590> hardened<00:02:56.220> steel<00:02:57.530> small

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
usually made out of hardened steel small

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.759 
usually made out of hardened steel small
Springs<00:02:59.160> can<00:02:59.610> be<00:02:59.819> wound<00:03:00.239> from<00:03:00.900> pre<00:03:01.260> hardened

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:01.769 
Springs can be wound from pre hardened

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
in the yield steel now this is getting

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:11.470 
in the yield steel now this is getting
kind<00:03:07.650> of<00:03:08.540> complicated<00:03:09.540> I<00:03:09.599> think<00:03:09.780> I'll<00:03:09.870> go<00:03:09.989> back

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
kind of complicated I think I'll go back

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:16.160 
kind of complicated I think I'll go back
let's<00:03:12.480> go<00:03:12.690> to<00:03:14.390> early<00:03:15.390> trampoline<00:03:16.140> like

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
let's go to early trampoline like

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.770 
let's go to early trampoline like
devices<00:03:16.890> so<00:03:17.160> this<00:03:17.310> is<00:03:17.459> something<00:03:17.670> that's<00:03:17.910> if

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
devices so this is something that's if

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.660 
devices so this is something that's if
it's<00:03:19.049> similar<00:03:19.350> to<00:03:19.680> a<00:03:19.709> trampoline<00:03:20.010> with<00:03:20.519> a

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
it's similar to a trampoline with a

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:24.050 
it's similar to a trampoline with a
trampoline<00:03:21.180> like<00:03:22.220> so<00:03:23.220> early<00:03:23.250> trampoline<00:03:24.030> like

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
trampoline like so early trampoline like

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.720 
trampoline like so early trampoline like
devices<00:03:24.780> it<00:03:25.440> is<00:03:25.530> said<00:03:25.980> that<00:03:26.010> a<00:03:26.250> kind<00:03:26.519> of

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
devices it is said that a kind of

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.780 
devices it is said that a kind of
trampolining<00:03:27.510> was<00:03:28.440> this<00:03:29.040> is<00:03:29.220> another<00:03:29.459> way<00:03:29.670> of

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
trampolining was this is another way of

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:31.300 
trampolining was this is another way of
saying<00:03:30.000> trampoline<00:03:30.600> like

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
saying trampoline like

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:34.180 
saying trampoline like
trembling<00:03:32.310> like<00:03:32.489> a<00:03:32.700> kind<00:03:33.120> of<00:03:33.329> trampolining

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.190 
trembling like a kind of trampolining

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:37.160 
trembling like a kind of trampolining
that's<00:03:35.190> kind<00:03:35.430> of<00:03:35.489> the<00:03:35.609> same<00:03:35.819> thing<00:03:36.060> it<00:03:36.810> is<00:03:36.959> said

that a kind of trampolining was done by

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:41.569 
that a kind of trampolining was done by
the<00:03:39.299> Inuit<00:03:39.569> people<00:03:40.139> who<00:03:40.380> used<00:03:40.859> to<00:03:40.980> toss<00:03:41.310> each

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
something like the sheet used by firemen

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.940 
something like the sheet used by firemen
to<00:03:47.940> catch<00:03:48.150> people<00:03:48.540> jumping<00:03:49.049> out<00:03:49.200> of<00:03:49.739> burning

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.380 

there's<00:04:07.290> a<00:04:07.379> the<00:04:07.830> Inuit<00:04:08.250> people<00:04:08.280> so<00:04:09.090> they<00:04:09.269> would

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:09.390 
there's a the Inuit people so they would

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:14.750 
there's a the Inuit people so they would
have<00:04:09.980> like<00:04:11.480> here's<00:04:12.480> some<00:04:12.720> fur<00:04:13.200> here<00:04:13.650> and<00:04:14.250> they

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760 
have like here's some fur here and they

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.250 
have like here's some fur here and they
would<00:04:14.909> take<00:04:15.060> this<00:04:15.239> fur<00:04:15.510> they<00:04:15.750> would<00:04:15.870> jump<00:04:16.109> on

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
would take this fur they would jump on

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.890 
would take this fur they would jump on
the<00:04:16.380> fern<00:04:16.620> sheet<00:04:17.250> themselves<00:04:17.699> up<00:04:17.850> apparently

I<00:04:20.810> see<00:04:21.810> the<00:04:21.930> Inuit<00:04:22.260> are<00:04:22.410> group<00:04:22.860> of<00:04:23.090> culturally

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
I see the Inuit are group of culturally

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:26.140 
I see the Inuit are group of culturally
similar<00:04:24.360> indigenous<00:04:25.320> peoples<00:04:25.650> inhabiting

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.150 
similar indigenous peoples inhabiting

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:29.360 
similar indigenous peoples inhabiting
the<00:04:27.150> Arctic<00:04:27.539> regions<00:04:27.900> of<00:04:28.080> Alaska<00:04:28.289> Canada<00:04:29.070> and

that's where they used to well they

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:41.990 
that's where they used to well they
still<00:04:39.030> live<00:04:39.270> there<00:04:39.510> some<00:04:40.199> of<00:04:40.320> them<00:04:41.000> very
