is for a gaming type system now it's
just<00:01:59.610> like<00:02:00.000> a<00:02:00.240> draw<00:02:00.689> program<00:02:01.290> that<00:02:01.560> you<00:02:01.740> would

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
just like a draw program that you would

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.359 
just like a draw program that you would
get<00:02:02.159> with<00:02:02.490> your<00:02:02.880> computer<00:02:03.479> you've<00:02:04.049> got<00:02:04.439> your

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
get with your computer you've got your

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.490 
get with your computer you've got your
area<00:02:05.729> all<00:02:06.000> set<00:02:06.299> up<00:02:06.479> you've<00:02:06.990> got<00:02:07.170> a<00:02:07.200> set<00:02:07.469> of

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
area all set up you've got a set of

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.460 
area all set up you've got a set of
colors<00:02:07.920> on<00:02:08.129> the<00:02:08.280> side<00:02:08.550> and<00:02:08.789> but<00:02:09.720> this<00:02:09.989> one<00:02:10.200> has

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
colors on the side and but this one has

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.229 
colors on the side and but this one has
another<00:02:10.950> option<00:02:11.190> it's<00:02:11.550> all<00:02:11.670> it's<00:02:11.970> called

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
another option it's all it's called

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.940 
another option it's all it's called
layers<00:02:12.540> so<00:02:13.170> you<00:02:13.200> can<00:02:13.440> create<00:02:13.680> some

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
layers so you can create some

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.089 
layers so you can create some
pixels<00:02:14.340> create<00:02:14.910> a<00:02:14.940> new<00:02:15.150> layer<00:02:15.330> put<00:02:15.690> more

00:02:16.089 --> 00:02:16.099 
pixels create a new layer put more

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:19.070 
pixels create a new layer put more
images<00:02:17.099> on<00:02:17.250> top<00:02:17.459> fade<00:02:18.120> them<00:02:18.300> together<00:02:18.569> and

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
images on top fade them together and

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.570 
images on top fade them together and
back<00:02:19.530> and<00:02:19.709> forth<00:02:19.920> this<00:02:20.069> is<00:02:20.190> how<00:02:20.310> it<00:02:20.400> works

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
back and forth this is how it works

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.570 
back and forth this is how it works
we'll<00:02:21.090> just<00:02:21.300> do<00:02:21.420> a<00:02:21.450> simple<00:02:21.959> drawing<00:02:22.200> a<00:02:22.580> nice

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
we'll just do a simple drawing a nice

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.390 
we'll just do a simple drawing a nice
red<00:02:23.940> color<00:02:24.300> here<00:02:24.720> we're<00:02:25.230> gonna<00:02:25.319> increase<00:02:26.250> the

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
red color here we're gonna increase the

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.670 
red color here we're gonna increase the
brush<00:02:27.180> size<00:02:27.239> a<00:02:27.480> little<00:02:27.840> bit<00:02:28.019> and<00:02:28.260> then<00:02:28.620> we'll

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
brush size a little bit and then we'll

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.710 
brush size a little bit and then we'll
just<00:02:28.860> draw<00:02:29.069> a<00:02:29.280> couple<00:02:29.700> lines<00:02:29.879> maybe<00:02:30.150> like<00:02:30.390> a<00:02:30.420> Z

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
just draw a couple lines maybe like a Z

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:31.640 
just draw a couple lines maybe like a Z
or<00:02:30.900> something<00:02:30.930> like<00:02:31.200> that

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
or something like that

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.309 
or something like that
nothing<00:02:32.489> fancy<00:02:32.760> of<00:02:33.209> course<00:02:33.660> and<00:02:33.900> of<00:02:33.989> course<00:02:34.170> if

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
nothing fancy of course and of course if

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:37.280 
nothing fancy of course and of course if
I<00:02:34.440> increase<00:02:34.950> the<00:02:35.040> brush<00:02:35.400> size<00:02:35.459> I<00:02:36.420> can<00:02:36.959> make<00:02:37.140> a

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
I increase the brush size I can make a

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.800 
I increase the brush size I can make a
couple<00:02:37.530> other<00:02:37.830> images<00:02:38.400> right<00:02:38.580> there<00:02:38.849> so<00:02:39.540> there

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
couple other images right there so there

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.410 
couple other images right there so there
I<00:02:39.840> have<00:02:40.019> my<00:02:40.230> first<00:02:40.739> layer<00:02:40.950> with<00:02:41.250> with<00:02:41.880> whatever

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
I have my first layer with with whatever

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.300 
I have my first layer with with whatever
just<00:02:42.870> this<00:02:43.080> little<00:02:43.319> drawing<00:02:43.680> right<00:02:43.860> here<00:02:43.890> I

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
just this little drawing right here I

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.670 
just this little drawing right here I
can<00:02:44.790> then<00:02:45.000> create<00:02:45.180> a<00:02:45.360> new<00:02:45.450> layer<00:02:45.870> and<00:02:46.140> then

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
can then create a new layer and then

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.559 
can then create a new layer and then
let's<00:02:46.920> say<00:02:47.069> I<00:02:47.099> want<00:02:47.430> to<00:02:47.549> do<00:02:47.640> this<00:02:47.819> in<00:02:48.090> this

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569 
let's say I want to do this in this

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:52.430 
let's say I want to do this in this
shade<00:02:49.140> of<00:02:49.170> blue<00:02:49.530> and<00:02:49.769> I<00:02:50.430> want<00:02:50.700> to<00:02:51.060> do<00:02:52.019> the<00:02:52.200> brush

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
shade of blue and I want to do the brush

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.470 
shade of blue and I want to do the brush
of<00:02:52.799> the<00:02:52.829> paintbrush<00:02:53.160> again<00:02:53.579> so<00:02:54.060> I'll<00:02:54.150> just<00:02:54.299> do

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
of the paintbrush again so I'll just do

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.140 
of the paintbrush again so I'll just do
a<00:02:54.720> couple<00:02:54.959> of<00:02:55.110> these<00:02:55.290> like<00:02:55.739> this<00:02:55.980> and<00:02:56.400> that

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
a couple of these like this and that

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:58.640 
a couple of these like this and that
made<00:02:57.360> a<00:02:57.390> small<00:02:57.690> mistake<00:02:57.870> so<00:02:58.260> I'll<00:02:58.349> hit<00:02:58.530> the

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
made a small mistake so I'll hit the

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.280 
made a small mistake so I'll hit the
undo<00:02:59.010> button<00:02:59.040> and<00:02:59.519> the<00:03:00.390> undo<00:03:00.510> button<00:03:00.750> again

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
undo button and the undo button again

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.350 
undo button and the undo button again
and<00:03:01.470> then<00:03:02.160> I'll<00:03:02.280> do<00:03:02.430> this<00:03:02.579> once<00:03:02.819> again<00:03:02.970> and

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
and then I'll do this once again and

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.350 
and then I'll do this once again and
there's<00:03:04.049> my<00:03:04.260> second<00:03:04.920> layer<00:03:05.099> of<00:03:05.310> course<00:03:06.000> I<00:03:06.120> have

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
there's my second layer of course I have

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.750 
there's my second layer of course I have
two<00:03:06.630> images<00:03:06.810> I<00:03:07.140> have<00:03:07.530> the<00:03:07.980> blue<00:03:08.220> color<00:03:08.489> and<00:03:08.670> the

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
two images I have the blue color and the

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.970 
two images I have the blue color and the
red<00:03:08.940> color<00:03:09.120> I<00:03:09.420> can<00:03:09.870> fade<00:03:10.200> out<00:03:10.349> the<00:03:10.530> blue<00:03:10.709> color

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
red color I can fade out the blue color

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.160 
red color I can fade out the blue color
and<00:03:11.220> I<00:03:11.640> can<00:03:11.819> see<00:03:12.090> more<00:03:12.269> of<00:03:12.329> the<00:03:12.390> red<00:03:12.599> color<00:03:12.870> or<00:03:12.959> I

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
and I can see more of the red color or I

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.440 
and I can see more of the red color or I
can<00:03:13.410> fade<00:03:13.680> it<00:03:13.799> back<00:03:14.010> in<00:03:14.280> there<00:03:14.910> are<00:03:15.000> separate

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
can fade it back in there are separate

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.509 
can fade it back in there are separate
layers<00:03:15.780> so<00:03:16.049> I<00:03:16.079> can<00:03:16.319> go<00:03:16.530> back<00:03:16.560> to<00:03:17.040> this<00:03:17.220> layer

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
layers so I can go back to this layer

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:19.849 
layers so I can go back to this layer
the<00:03:18.180> red<00:03:18.389> layer<00:03:18.630> and<00:03:18.900> actually<00:03:19.230> continue<00:03:19.590> to

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:19.859 
the red layer and actually continue to

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:22.250 
the red layer and actually continue to
draw<00:03:20.069> here<00:03:20.459> or<00:03:20.609> even<00:03:21.150> just<00:03:21.660> to<00:03:21.810> remove<00:03:22.139> it

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
draw here or even just to remove it

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.379 
draw here or even just to remove it
altogether<00:03:22.410> there's<00:03:23.250> an<00:03:23.459> eraser<00:03:23.880> tool<00:03:24.090> so<00:03:24.359> I

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:24.389 
altogether there's an eraser tool so I

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:26.270 
altogether there's an eraser tool so I
can<00:03:24.630> even<00:03:24.870> erase<00:03:25.260> some<00:03:25.709> of<00:03:25.739> the<00:03:25.859> lines<00:03:25.889> let's

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
can even erase some of the lines let's

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.400 
can even erase some of the lines let's
make<00:03:26.459> a<00:03:26.489> bigger<00:03:26.760> brush<00:03:27.090> here<00:03:27.329> and<00:03:27.930> I<00:03:27.989> can<00:03:28.200> erase

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
make a bigger brush here and I can erase

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:29.930 
make a bigger brush here and I can erase
some<00:03:28.709> of<00:03:28.739> this<00:03:28.889> stuff<00:03:29.160> as<00:03:29.370> you<00:03:29.459> can<00:03:29.609> see<00:03:29.790> the

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
some of this stuff as you can see the

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.900 
some of this stuff as you can see the
blues<00:03:30.180> not<00:03:30.389> getting<00:03:30.870> erased<00:03:31.380> as<00:03:31.620> the<00:03:32.280> red<00:03:32.489> is

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
blues not getting erased as the red is

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.360 
blues not getting erased as the red is
and<00:03:33.329> then<00:03:33.870> as<00:03:33.989> I<00:03:34.170> create<00:03:34.560> more<00:03:34.769> layers<00:03:35.010> I<00:03:35.340> can

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
and then as I create more layers I can

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.879 
and then as I create more layers I can
create<00:03:36.299> some<00:03:36.540> pretty<00:03:36.720> cool<00:03:37.049> stuff<00:03:37.440> there's

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:37.889 
create some pretty cool stuff there's

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:40.400 
create some pretty cool stuff there's
some<00:03:38.130> art<00:03:38.370> out<00:03:38.579> there<00:03:38.609> used<00:03:39.180> by<00:03:39.540> pic<00:03:40.019> Sakai

and like that I can do that and then

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:39.080 
and like that I can do that and then
zoom<00:04:36.090> it<00:04:36.240> back<00:04:36.390> out<00:04:36.630> and<00:04:36.810> it's<00:04:37.770> it's<00:04:38.520> done<00:04:38.790> and
