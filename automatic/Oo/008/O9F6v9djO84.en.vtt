whatever where they keep it at a certain
amount<00:03:45.690> and<00:03:46.019> you<00:03:46.170> don't<00:03:46.530> ever<00:03:46.650> find<00:03:46.890> a<00:03:46.950> card

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
amount and you don't ever find a card

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.819 
amount and you don't ever find a card
that's<00:03:47.280> less<00:03:47.579> than<00:03:47.610> that<00:03:47.910> so<00:03:48.380> it's<00:03:49.380> just<00:03:49.620> I

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:49.829 
that's less than that so it's just I

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:51.530 
that's less than that so it's just I
don't<00:03:50.220> know<00:03:50.340> it's<00:03:50.400> to<00:03:50.760> me<00:03:50.850> it<00:03:51.030> turns<00:03:51.239> out<00:03:51.360> to<00:03:51.420> be

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.270 
don't know it's to me it turns out to be
it's<00:03:51.840> not<00:03:51.930> very<00:03:52.170> good<00:03:52.410> i<00:03:52.440> think<00:03:52.530> EA<00:03:52.860> is<00:03:53.040> gonna

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
it's not very good i think EA is gonna

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:54.710 
it's not very good i think EA is gonna
start<00:03:53.489> doing<00:03:53.850> something<00:03:54.120> about<00:03:54.299> it<00:03:54.450> actually

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:45.140 
like why guess you could say like they
could<00:04:43.139> find<00:04:43.320> out<00:04:43.470> who<00:04:43.680> who<00:04:44.310> sold<00:04:44.760> you<00:04:44.940> or<00:04:45.060> who

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150 
could find out who who sold you or who

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:46.490 
could find out who who sold you or who
bought<00:04:45.360> the<00:04:45.539> player<00:04:45.780> for<00:04:46.050> how<00:04:46.139> many<00:04:46.320> coins

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500 
bought the player for how many coins

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:47.930 
bought the player for how many coins
they<00:04:46.800> could<00:04:46.919> do<00:04:47.010> a<00:04:47.039> lot<00:04:47.250> of<00:04:47.280> things<00:04:47.490> for<00:04:47.699> it<00:04:47.789> but

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
they could do a lot of things for it but

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:50.420 
they could do a lot of things for it but
um<00:04:48.510> it<00:04:48.810> might<00:04:48.960> fix<00:04:49.260> for<00:04:49.560> at<00:04:49.650> least<00:04:49.740> for<00:04:49.949> fifa<00:04:50.190> 14

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.430 
um it might fix for at least for fifa 14

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:52.310 
um it might fix for at least for fifa 14
where<00:04:50.789> you<00:04:50.910> don't<00:04:51.000> end<00:04:51.300> up<00:04:51.510> against<00:04:51.840> God<00:04:52.020> to<00:04:52.229> us

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.320 
where you don't end up against God to us

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.020 
where you don't end up against God to us
all<00:04:52.500> the<00:04:52.530> time<00:04:52.710> this<00:04:52.949> also<00:04:53.430> I<00:04:53.460> think<00:04:53.580> has<00:04:53.820> to<00:04:53.940> do

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.030 
all the time this also I think has to do

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:55.159 
all the time this also I think has to do
that<00:04:54.180> they<00:04:54.300> don't<00:04:54.449> have<00:04:54.539> the<00:04:54.750> single<00:04:55.050> player

00:04:55.159 --> 00:04:55.169 
that they don't have the single player

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:58.580 
that they don't have the single player
ultimate<00:04:56.010> team<00:04:56.160> in<00:04:56.310> the<00:04:56.400> match<00:04:56.550> so<00:04:57.590> there

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:58.590 
ultimate team in the match so there

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:00.110 
ultimate team in the match so there
could<00:04:58.710> be<00:04:58.740> a<00:04:58.830> chance<00:04:58.889> that<00:04:59.280> maybe<00:04:59.699> it'll<00:05:00.000> go

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120 
could be a chance that maybe it'll go

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.090 
could be a chance that maybe it'll go
back<00:05:00.300> to<00:05:00.419> like<00:05:00.539> fifa<00:05:00.720> 12<00:05:01.020> where<00:05:01.350> you<00:05:01.889> know<00:05:02.010> you

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:02.100 
back to like fifa 12 where you know you

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:03.379 
back to like fifa 12 where you know you
decided<00:05:02.639> you<00:05:02.699> wanted<00:05:02.729> to<00:05:02.940> play<00:05:03.030> a<00:05:03.090> single

00:05:03.379 --> 00:05:03.389 
decided you wanted to play a single

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:05.210 
decided you wanted to play a single
match<00:05:03.720> and<00:05:04.080> you<00:05:04.410> had<00:05:04.560> just<00:05:04.710> like<00:05:04.919> a<00:05:04.949> random
