00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:10.640
 [music] 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:18.420
 strange thing just now I'm starting 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.609
 understand that in the ninety-eighth year 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.850
 when I first came to Geneva 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:26.310
 auto show this car was presented 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:29.220
 to the public for the first time and he was very 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:44.730
 interesting novelty but I did not pay 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:47.270
 attention deu matiz in ninety-third 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:50.520
 year was not even deu 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:53.879
 concept car of fiat 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:56.070
 for some reason fiat he did not need though 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:01:00.090
 they ordered his design to the famous 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:05.270
 atelier italdesign and they somehow 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.270
 form alloys company Daewoo Koreans 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:21.030
 how did this baby get me 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.980
 Uzbek registration is generally long 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.990
 history but today its 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:30.180
 launches joint venture 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:32.729
 jam uzbekiston ie there is some part 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.729
 production Uzbeks localized to 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:38.010
 Fortunately, this is a very small part 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.810
 they make glazing and stamp 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:42.080
 steel wheels 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.460
 but otherwise all the components and assemblies 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:48.330
 supplied by joint ventures 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:51.060
 same Uzbeks and Koreans produced 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:53.640
 at Korean enterprises main nodes 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.860
 and units motor box is all 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.759
 Korean car so count all 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.050
 equally 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.050
 and to mark 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:16.440
 which is remarkable in the lineup mother and 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:18.120
 It is considered in Russia the very first 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:22.080
 budget cars and strictly speaking 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:24.540
 take very often in order to enter 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:27.900
 world of motorists learn to ride on it 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:31.790
 make the first mistakes but nonetheless 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:33.390
 this car has several levels 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.720
 picking here in our case 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:38.460
 grade mx is pretty 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:40.020
 heaped by the standards of 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:43.350
 mirko. 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:46.200
 there are alloy wheels shod in 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:51.060
 tires continental although these are so narrow 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:52.920
 there is an air conditioner and a reaper 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.270
 to and soundproofing i even hear from here 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:03:10.529
 as there are no women cassette 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:03:10.529
 [music] 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:16.819
 over say in none of the test 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:20.300
 cars I was not so close to 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:21.380
 camera lens because here itâ€™s just 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:24.380
 nowhere to go 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:27.470
 the size of this little house on 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:29.930
 the wheels are not impressive but nonetheless 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:33.070
 mother because of are like 5 seater 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:35.989
 car but to be honest of course 

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:41.450
 4-seater here asked me and going 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:42.080
 in detail a man many whether 08 on 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:46.060
 four 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:50.330
 rather than saying that in principle, I am fine 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:52.550
 I can say that the engine displacement is 0.8 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:54.650
 liters for dao matiz 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:58.730
 with its mass and size it is also in 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:04:02.080
 principle is normal 51 horsepower and not 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:04.190
 disperse anyone to kick anything there 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:07.880
 traffic light racing naturally not 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:11.700
 but it will turn out to go in city traffic 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:17.010
 which is the average speed where is studying 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:19.620
 at 910 an hour is the most that is necessary 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:20.610
 it is worth saying daeu matiz automatic 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:23.460
 gear box 

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:27.000
 it is mounted with a motor 0.8 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:29.220
 liter they have another liter motor and 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.380
 1 cylinder we are shorter with the machine you 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:34.440
 don't get in any way because 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:35.910
 Again, small size 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:38.160
 engine compartment 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:39.870
 parties to the transfer of the motor there is not 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:43.700
 fit 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:43.700
 have a small macaque 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:48.009
 [applause] 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:52.629
 [music] 

00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:55.839
 how to stay very modest plastic 

00:04:52.629 --> 00:04:58.979
 front panel plastic front panel 

00:04:55.839 --> 00:05:02.259
 also very modest but decorates her 

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:06.509
 wonderful button labeled a fraction 

00:05:02.259 --> 00:05:10.270
 c is an air conditioner that comes with a motor 

00:05:06.509 --> 00:05:12.270
 0.8 liters capacity 50 1 horsepower 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:18.699
 in set 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:27.300
 Now if you press it immediately immediately 

00:05:18.699 --> 00:05:27.300
 falls on not a dollar and 

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:36.520
 maneuverability Daewoo matiz 

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:39.669
 said many called him whatever you like 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:41.559
 the most common this creep on 

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:46.360
 in fact you are considering him 

00:05:41.559 --> 00:05:48.969
 narrow as the size of dinner he squeezes through 

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:50.619
 in such a gap in traffic jams which is normal 

00:05:48.969 --> 00:05:53.889
 full-size car is just not 

00:05:50.619 --> 00:05:56.100
 dare to call and know how on this 

00:05:53.889 --> 00:05:57.030
 the car can flash plug 

00:05:56.100 --> 00:06:00.110
 forward all 

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:00.110
