00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.280 
we've got the files and now we can do
lots<00:01:42.119> of<00:01:42.240> different<00:01:42.360> things<00:01:42.540> with<00:01:42.840> them<00:01:42.990> we

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
lots of different things with them we

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.510 
lots of different things with them we
also<00:01:43.470> have<00:01:43.560> lots<00:01:43.799> of<00:01:43.950> other<00:01:44.070> neat<00:01:44.280> things<00:01:44.430> we

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
also have lots of other neat things we

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.940 
also have lots of other neat things we
can<00:01:44.640> do<00:01:44.729> with<00:01:44.790> LS<00:01:45.119> for<00:01:45.360> instance<00:01:45.630> LS<00:01:45.899> l<00:01:46.380> will

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
can do with LS for instance LS l will

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.429 
can do with LS for instance LS l will
print<00:01:47.280> a<00:01:47.430> list<00:01:48.090> with<00:01:48.540> all<00:01:48.780> sorts<00:01:48.990> of<00:01:49.140> detail

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
print a list with all sorts of detail

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.789 
print a list with all sorts of detail
information<00:01:49.649> about<00:01:50.130> each<00:01:50.280> file<00:01:50.549> so<00:01:50.930> LOL<00:01:51.930> pipe

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
information about each file so LOL pipe

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:57.740 
information about each file so LOL pipe
it<00:01:52.979> to<00:01:53.189> the<00:01:54.770> text<00:01:55.770> edit<00:01:55.979> and<00:01:56.159> we<00:01:57.119> get<00:01:57.329> something

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
it to the text edit and we get something

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.170 
it to the text edit and we get something
like<00:01:57.990> that<00:01:58.170> which<00:01:58.409> gives<00:01:58.560> you<00:01:58.770> file<00:01:59.340> sizes<00:01:59.670> and

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
like that which gives you file sizes and

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.600 
like that which gives you file sizes and
creation<00:02:00.719> dates<00:02:00.920> so<00:02:01.920> that<00:02:02.040> could<00:02:02.250> be<00:02:02.280> useful

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
creation dates so that could be useful

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.450 
creation dates so that could be useful
now<00:02:03.240> if<00:02:03.390> you<00:02:03.540> need<00:02:03.750> to<00:02:03.930> actually<00:02:04.079> get<00:02:04.619> to<00:02:04.829> a

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
now if you need to actually get to a

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.180 
now if you need to actually get to a
directory<00:02:06.299> that<00:02:06.420> is<00:02:06.930> deep<00:02:07.439> inside<00:02:07.680> your<00:02:08.039> Mac

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
directory that is deep inside your Mac

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.559 
directory that is deep inside your Mac
one<00:02:08.640> of<00:02:08.700> the<00:02:08.759> things<00:02:08.819> you<00:02:08.970> can<00:02:09.090> do<00:02:09.209> is<00:02:09.450> you

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
one of the things you can do is you

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.040 
one of the things you can do is you
could<00:02:09.690> CD<00:02:10.110> and<00:02:10.379> then

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
could CD and then

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:14.420 
could CD and then
drag<00:02:11.200> bike<00:02:11.740> hitting<00:02:12.220> the<00:02:12.340> option<00:02:12.850> key<00:02:13.060> and<00:02:13.320> the

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
drag bike hitting the option key and the

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.400 
drag bike hitting the option key and the
folder<00:02:15.430> icon<00:02:15.610> at<00:02:16.210> the<00:02:16.240> top<00:02:16.600> of<00:02:16.840> a<00:02:16.990> directory

folder icon at the top of a directory

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.050 
folder icon at the top of a directory
listing<00:02:17.710> and<00:02:17.830> pull<00:02:18.250> it<00:02:18.280> in<00:02:18.460> and<00:02:18.640> it<00:02:18.730> will<00:02:18.820> put

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
listing and pull it in and it will put

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.960 
listing and pull it in and it will put
the<00:02:19.180> entire<00:02:19.530> directory<00:02:20.530> path<00:02:20.950> in<00:02:21.250> there<00:02:21.520> so

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
the entire directory path in there so

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.670 
the entire directory path in there so
for<00:02:22.180> instance<00:02:22.210> I'm<00:02:22.690> going<00:02:23.200> to<00:02:23.290> do<00:02:23.410> that<00:02:23.530> now

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
for instance I'm going to do that now

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.040 
for instance I'm going to do that now
with<00:02:23.710> this<00:02:24.460> folder<00:02:24.940> I'm<00:02:25.450> going<00:02:25.690> to<00:02:25.810> go<00:02:26.020> ahead

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
with this folder I'm going to go ahead

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:32.720 
with this folder I'm going to go ahead
and<00:02:26.730> drag<00:02:28.110> this<00:02:29.940> right<00:02:30.940> here<00:02:31.180> like<00:02:31.300> that<00:02:31.540> and

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
and drag this right here like that and

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.130 
and drag this right here like that and
you<00:02:33.730> can<00:02:33.850> see<00:02:34.030> it<00:02:34.180> will<00:02:34.270> add<00:02:34.450> it<00:02:34.480> to<00:02:35.020> the

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
you can see it will add it to the

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.860 
you can see it will add it to the
terminal<00:02:35.470> window<00:02:35.790> there<00:02:36.790> you<00:02:36.970> go<00:02:37.090> so<00:02:37.270> CD<00:02:37.660> and

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
terminal window there you go so CD and

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.360 
terminal window there you go so CD and
I've<00:02:37.930> got<00:02:38.110> a<00:02:38.140> complete<00:02:38.530> path<00:02:38.740> to<00:02:39.250> that

up with it in text edit or another word
processing<00:03:18.160> program<00:03:18.550> and<00:03:18.730> you<00:03:18.880> can<00:03:18.910> print

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
processing program and you can print

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:21.600 
processing program and you can print
from<00:03:19.300> there<00:03:19.830> so<00:03:20.830> there<00:03:20.980> are<00:03:21.010> three<00:03:21.430> ways<00:03:21.550> to

from there so there are three ways to

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:23.460 
from there so there are three ways to
print<00:03:22.030> the<00:03:22.209> files<00:03:22.450> and<00:03:22.660> folders<00:03:22.959> in<00:03:23.140> the
