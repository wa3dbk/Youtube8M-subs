00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:19.439
 you can not free yourself from it 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.840
 not as fully professional with just under 160 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.029
 Play the Bundesliga like you Pirmin 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.010
 schwegler on the account has the games 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:30.390
 are against the ex-club and stay 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:32.489
 especially yes of course already 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.710
 I got a hang of it 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:38.219
 Much of what you might experience in 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.649
 other five can experience janisch with 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:43.680
 descent with re-emergence europe league 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.539
 Quali and just a few things and mit 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.840
 I personally believe in stone too 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.969
 frankfurt attacks station of a career 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.219
 former employer next opponent 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:57.480
 the first reunion with harmony 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:59.640
 from frankfurt the again strengthened all 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.559
 seen that frankfurt its strengths in 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.719
 play with the ball definitely has you 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.210
 let too many chances 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.860
 happened against but they also have 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:12.360
 incredible chances 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:14.340
 Therefore, let's see if the frankfurter 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.909
 switch game for this game or 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.580
 Not 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.960
 I tend not to believe us 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.729
 have no reason to change anything 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.020
 also more with this marsch was also 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:26.280
 won for example in gladbach 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.810
 was at the time was a surprise 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.030
 have defeated dortmund 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.430
 last three wins one point before the 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.250
 tsg with the third best attack of the league 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:38.909
 and the best scorer alex meier 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:41.250
 you know each other, I have them all 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:44.759
 Day he impressed me 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:47.250
 no more than absolute top striker with 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.560
 the statements which I think you far 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.530
 Must look for and if you want to graduate 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.329
 then comes with its inside then 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.909
 you almost have to be an enemy right now 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:59.189
 turn around and look for it right away 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.170
 then because he is almost always in there so 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.880
 beautiful 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:05.939
 whosoever shall pay its troops statements 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.819
 front meyer hit the back 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:10.979
 third-most of the game class of therefore 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.360
 the suspicion is close that is 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.860
 maybe several dead can give 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.610
 but often that is more accurate 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.930
 These games then with few goals to 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.080
 That's why the stage is over 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:24.030
 ever exciting interesting partie 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:27.239
 will certainly expect now I believe 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.080
 that we are now a bit stable 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:30.150
 that's the last three games 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.130
 shown and the team still people 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.709
 drive in more points so that 's fine 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.569
 now it can be a competitive game and we 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:39.299
 We want to transcribe everything that we have before 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:41.310
 a stay ten bundesliga duelle gave 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:43.380
 it already with the harmony of the half 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:46.380
 tsg 3 won the draw 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.670
 consequently, frankfurt won only two 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:53.280
 but continue to expand 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:57.180
 the current series three points very well 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:59.250
 the world class but first look 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.750
 We'll go down and work again 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.730
 again this week to find friday 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:05.120
 and I always give full throttle and 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.260
 then we'll have a friday 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.880
 come down so you probably like in 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.510
 frankfurt itself is not so sure 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.000
 believe 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:14.420
 Pirmin in any case is looking forward to that 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.510
 play against the ex club joy yes 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:20.370
 increased nervousness no signs 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:21.870
 for me personally i can mirror 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:25.470
 I look in the five years 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:28.500
 all have done for the club often 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:30.180
 played with injury with illnesses 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:34.920
 and I'm really hard 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:36.750
 you play through I do not know 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.819
 how it will come as I nehms then 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.200
 show how I think there is 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:43.650
 worse things where you live 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:47.720
 I have to go through there and I would 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.720
 because not complain about it
