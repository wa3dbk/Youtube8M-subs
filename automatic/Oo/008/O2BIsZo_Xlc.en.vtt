fighting off all these zombies but I

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.479 
fighting off all these zombies but I

guess<00:02:24.640> I<00:02:24.760> can't<00:02:24.939> say<00:02:25.030> flawed<00:02:25.269> because<00:02:25.450> it<00:02:25.569> was

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:25.719 
guess I can't say flawed because it was

00:02:25.719 --> 00:02:27.149 
guess I can't say flawed because it was
effective<00:02:26.140> in<00:02:26.260> the<00:02:26.349> end<00:02:26.500> but<00:02:26.680> really<00:02:26.920> I'm

00:02:27.149 --> 00:02:27.159 
effective in the end but really I'm

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:29.699
