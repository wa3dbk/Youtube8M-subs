them while the doughnuts are cooling you

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.510 
them while the doughnuts are cooling you
can<00:01:21.420> make<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.780> glaze<00:01:21.960> so<00:01:22.649> just<00:01:23.070> incorporate

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
can make the glaze so just incorporate

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.450 
can make the glaze so just incorporate
the<00:01:23.640> Nutella<00:01:23.970> and<00:01:24.180> a<00:01:24.360> half<00:01:24.479> and<00:01:24.690> half<00:01:24.810> and<00:01:25.460> just

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
the Nutella and a half and half and just

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:27.980 
the Nutella and a half and half and just
whisk<00:01:26.640> that<00:01:26.820> all<00:01:26.880> together<00:01:27.119> until<00:01:27.360> it<00:01:27.659> forms<00:01:27.899> a

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
whisk that all together until it forms a

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.380 
whisk that all together until it forms a
glaze<00:01:28.429> then<00:01:29.429> dip<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:29.789> doughnuts<00:01:30.090> into<00:01:30.210> the

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
glaze then dip the doughnuts into the

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.480 
glaze then dip the doughnuts into the
glaze<00:01:30.630> and<00:01:30.899> cover<00:01:31.289> them<00:01:31.530> with<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:32.039> sprinkles

glaze and cover them with the sprinkles

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.370 
glaze and cover them with the sprinkles
I<00:01:32.580> recommend<00:01:33.450> actually<00:01:33.630> dipping<00:01:34.080> them<00:01:34.229> with

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380
