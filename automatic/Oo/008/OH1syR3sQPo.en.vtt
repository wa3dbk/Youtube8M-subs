00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
 It has hardly been named in the first weather here » 

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.219
 our direction and the daytime flow movie shows exactly 

00:00:08.219 --> 00:00:11.620
 What happens here comes from the Atlantic 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.060
 deepen here and then slowly but surely morning afternoon morning 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:18.170
 Evening more and more 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:20.380
 Influence on our weather 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:22.589
 wins and what is unique 

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:23.619
 the mountains 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:26.929
 many will experience wind speed quite often 

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:29.169
 one hundred and fifty to 108 

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:30.880
 Bertlich 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.980
 200 km 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:34.230
 per hour 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.700
 on the average chosen we lead but partly later on the 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.700
 Alpine peaks a bit more complicated it is for the lowlands 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.290
 extremely high altitudes are not everywhere one to one in the lowlands 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:52.440
 This succeeds at the deepest north of this vertical impulse transport 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.729
 with the cold front sometimes even chills 

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:59.570
 short thunderstorms with it and there are also so-called blue Brest and then 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:04.910
 Kant adding in this area in the north even in the plains to 350 kilometers per 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:08.190
 Hour club moreover this is Wikia dangerous matter 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.180
 it takes a bit of a general risk from the southwest but also in 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.950
 Baden-württemberg still 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.280
 often also hurricane or gale gusts 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.490
 in the plains no wonder the map of the storm station 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:26.010
 blush partly also Julia that is the highest level so with over 130 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:31.200
 Kilometers per hour to continue tomorrow morning for the last stand easy 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.070
 the general tip 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:34.270
 main emphasis 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:38.770
 the morning winds late afternoon morning and then more and more to the east 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:43.260
 progressive also at night and of course also seen before percent 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.960
 Berlin also with it and that's just at night on Friday 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.720
 problematic then also urbanites do not think that they 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.140
 Have some weather and then there are some flying through the area and somehow avoid 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.670
 go far to drive that was already know the map of today after the 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.640
 Lohner bit talked about the hurricane so tonight 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.429
 because quite often the rain 

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:07.409
 the northwest is no longer the edge of the Alps also gets nothing off the round with the 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.920
 Matter anyway morning morning then percent short weather calming 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.159
 before it starts raining from west to east the system then already 

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:17.279
 Storm or Orcantief 

00:02:17.279 --> 00:02:20.449
 In the afternoon the wind becomes more and more stormy 

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:24.540
 further problematic leaned in the western low mountain ranges it also rains 

00:02:24.539 --> 00:02:28.750
 very strong so smaller rivers streams that are also very nice to Schwerin 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.900
 also partly the middle rivers 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.140
 and then just the cold front comes partly with the showers and thunderstorms and 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.810
 that is the moment of greatest danger with the vertical impulse 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.880
 Transport the temperatures really mild again before the cold front comes 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:47.230
 partly at 15 degrees the wind was still in the run-up to the hurricane 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.350
 southern to southwestern directions but already open city 

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:55.810
 the further prospects the day after Friday pulls the Sturmfeld slowly 

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:59.529
 Direction percent east from but then more problematic when the wind 

00:02:59.529 --> 00:03:04.859
 then on northwest Red then storm surge danger for the North Sea on Saturday always 

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:08.790
 still windy but then overall weather calming so 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.479
 they fit tomorrow 

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:14.279
 Especially in the late afternoon in the evening and in the night on Friday especially on you 

00:03:14.279 --> 00:03:14.800
 on 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.960
 not be anywhere near where something can fly around 

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:21.190
 and for sure just be home and the first nice evening
