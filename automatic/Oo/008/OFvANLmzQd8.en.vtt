00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.920
 Hello 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:19.130
 Greetings to all of us today, we are going to discuss a 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:21.050
 tricky subject a subject that carries heavy 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.480
 a lot of time in the industry of 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:26.720
 video game in general both consoles 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:31.730
 as pc we talk about the controversial issue 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:34.519
 digital or physical something that sure 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:37.220
 the companies are giving them many 

00:00:34.519 --> 00:00:39.379
 headaches today let's talk 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:41.989
 of the advantages and disadvantages that 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:45.920
 supposes this type of formats we are going to 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:48.170
 start with the obvious physical format a 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.239
 format that you carry with us from the 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.760
 dawn of the video game industry 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:55.930
 from birth itself from the 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:59.210
 genesis and that is that the physical format has 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:01.940
 considerable advantages and has some 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:04.610
 disadvantages the great advantages that 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:07.130
 you have is that you have it physically and it is 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:10.280
 that you can feel what your disc has 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:12.619
 you cd you put it you take it off you do not 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.509
 takes up space on your hard drive and is that 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:16.130
 are the great advantages that the 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:18.829
 physical format 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.930
 that does not occupy and as it does not occupy trunk 

00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:24.470
 we can observe it for another type 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:27.380
 of things like photos videos music demos 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:29.960
 and a lot of etceteras that do not 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.990
 they could stop not also the format 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:35.329
 what it offers us is that we are going to 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:38.390
 to be able to throw secondhand a very 

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:40.429
 controversial also that we will touch on 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.710
 other locutions a little later 

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:45.710
 but let's say that this topic in 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:47.960
 concrete is what has made rethink 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:51.020
 to companies to large companies 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:54.349
 to be able to use a system of 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:56.209
 digital distribution to be able to have a 

00:01:54.349 --> 00:01:59.390
 little bit more control this has 

00:01:56.209 --> 00:02:01.280
 also its logic but good you have to 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.950
 look at it from the two points of view not 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:07.849
 one of the big ones but that has the 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:10.069
 physical format is immediacy and is that 

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:12.530
 when you are at home and you feel like it 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:15.290
 played a game and for example are the 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:17.630
 eleven o'clock at night because you're not going to catch 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.640
 back to put the slippers and you're going to 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.500
 go to the shopping center of Marras 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.090
 buy the game in your big 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.700
 surfaces 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.260
 that's what you can not do and you're going to 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.989
 have to wait for the next day to 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.489
 to be able to do it there are many people who 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:33.140
 will say this to me I do not care if I 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:35.780
 I can wait perfectly already but it's 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:39.950
 that there are many people in many users that 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:43.370
 can not expect that they are people by 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.930
 how to say impatient I find myself 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.629
 between one of them because it's not true 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.540
 so well and now we go with the format 

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:52.549
 digital a format that is gone 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:54.500
 implanting little by little and what companies 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:57.560
 like sony microsoft and now nintendo 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:00.380
 very strong bet for all this is a 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:02.060
 control way to see this in good 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:05.989
 sense of the word to have it all 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:08.090
 ordered true jack horse king well the 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:11.209
 digital format takes up space in the 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:13.370
 perfect hard drive is that here the easy thing 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:14.569
 is to criticize how easy it is to look at 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.970
 cons you have this kind of 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:19.970
 distribution takes up space in the 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:23.989
 trunk afterwards we have to 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:26.299
 the prices are still not very are not 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:28.069
 very fair are not very fair 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:29.000
 the respect to the digital format 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:32.780
 what 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:35.300
 all physical we will be able to buy a 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:38.240
 game for not being let's say a price 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:41.780
 20 euros and it turns out that the format 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:44.030
 digital we can acquire it almost by the 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:47.510
 same price there are even times that by 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:49.850
 more and this will say good and what but like this already 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:51.950
 I have it quickly is that it is another 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:53.870
 the great advantages that in the same 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:55.910
 moment in which you crave 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:58.700
 against a game you go to your 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:00.709
 platform your store and they will 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:03.320
 You can download the loan 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:05.900
 opportunity to pay on the spot and do it 

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:08.540
 well through prepaid cards well 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:10.370
 by credit card another topic 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:12.320
 controversial or to the song that I'm pointing at 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:14.209
 bold for the next time the subject of 

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:16.209
 payments by credit card in 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:20.480
 digital distribution platforms 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:20.989
 also the games in digital format that 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:23.990
 night 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:28.340
 I mean they have a capacity 40 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:30.919
 gigas 30 10 that you are going to have to 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:33.200
 download occupying your bandwidth that 

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:34.830
 depending on what people and here in the 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:37.170
 region where we are 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:39.810
 a little bit also in the stone age in 

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:41.520
 this sense and we will delay then what 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:43.650
 we have to take time to download what 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:47.250
 so that of immediacy is a 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:49.140
 little in quotes and we are talking 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:52.230
 of this generation the next generation 

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:55.590
 keep in mind that the ability to 

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:57.600
 the games will grow and grow then 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:00.750
 We're going to need a lot of hard drives 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:02.640
 quite broad in that sense be like 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:05.670
 the last word is the user 

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:09.260
 and the digital download and platforms 

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:10.830
 of digital distribution have just been born 

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:13.410
 practically in the world of 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:15.120
 consoles not like that in the pc world that 

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:17.340
 It takes some time and it starts 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:19.470
 settle this is a trojan horse 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:22.500
 who they have bet strong the 

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:24.600
 companies to do it and that little by little 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:28.350
 is going to end up installing time will tell 

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:31.410
 if in the end the platform will be imposed 

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:33.330
 digital as standard or it will be a 

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:35.790
 complement the physical format that is not going 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:37.350
 to disappear notwithstanding any 

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:38.380
 comment that you want to leave you can 

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:41.020
 leave 

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:45.570
 at the bottom of the video so you already know 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:45.570
 post a greeting and see you next time 

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:51.800
 of everything
