hi there this video is going to walk you
through<00:00:04.040> how<00:00:05.040> to<00:00:05.270> join<00:00:06.270> your<00:00:06.600> Windows<00:00:07.020> 7

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
through how to join your Windows 7

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.450 
through how to join your Windows 7
computer<00:00:08.130> to<00:00:08.550> a<00:00:08.580> domain<00:00:09.860> now<00:00:10.860> the<00:00:10.920> difference

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
computer to a domain now the difference

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.910 
computer to a domain now the difference
between<00:00:11.519> a<00:00:11.849> domain<00:00:12.330> and<00:00:12.599> a<00:00:12.690> workgroup<00:00:12.900> is<00:00:13.320> that

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
between a domain and a workgroup is that

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.730 
between a domain and a workgroup is that
a<00:00:14.130> domain<00:00:14.750> when<00:00:15.750> you're<00:00:15.900> joining<00:00:16.139> a<00:00:16.350> domain

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
a domain when you're joining a domain

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.290 
a domain when you're joining a domain
there<00:00:17.039> needs<00:00:17.220> to<00:00:17.310> be<00:00:17.400> a<00:00:17.550> domain<00:00:18.029> controller

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
there needs to be a domain controller

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.689 
there needs to be a domain controller
and<00:00:18.990> normally<00:00:19.740> that<00:00:19.890> takes<00:00:20.160> place<00:00:20.460> your

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
and normally that takes place your

the domain is happy calm okay so let's

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.149 
the domain is happy calm okay so let's
say<00:01:36.420> that<00:01:36.450> our<00:01:36.840> network<00:01:37.259> administrator<00:01:37.950> has

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
say that our network administrator has

say that our network administrator has
given<00:01:38.520> us<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:39.030> domain<00:01:39.479> of<00:01:39.810> happy<00:01:40.799> calm<00:01:41.490> that's

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
given us the domain of happy calm that's

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.690 
given us the domain of happy calm that's
the<00:01:41.939> domain<00:01:42.570> we<00:01:42.899> want<00:01:43.049> to<00:01:43.170> join<00:01:43.409> when<00:01:44.369> we<00:01:44.520> hit

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
the domain we want to join when we hit

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.490 
the domain we want to join when we hit
ok<00:01:45.149> we're<00:01:45.479> not<00:01:45.570> going<00:01:45.840> to<00:01:45.869> hit<00:01:46.020> OK<00:01:46.320> because

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
ok we're not going to hit OK because

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.990 
ok we're not going to hit OK because
it's<00:01:46.799> not<00:01:46.950> going<00:01:47.070> to<00:01:47.130> do<00:01:47.250> anything<00:01:47.579> but<00:01:47.880> when

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
it's not going to do anything but when

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.080 
it's not going to do anything but when
we<00:01:48.060> hit<00:01:48.360> OK<00:01:48.750> it's<00:01:49.590> probably<00:01:50.220> going<00:01:50.460> to<00:01:50.640> prompt

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
we hit OK it's probably going to prompt

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.410 
we hit OK it's probably going to prompt
us<00:01:51.240> for<00:01:51.479> a<00:01:52.280> username<00:01:53.280> and<00:01:53.549> password<00:01:53.640> that<00:01:54.360> has

order to join this computer to a domain

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:13.590 
order to join this computer to a domain
so<00:02:11.370> I'm<00:02:11.430> going<00:02:11.550> to<00:02:11.580> hit<00:02:11.700> cancel<00:02:12.000> and<00:02:12.500> ok
