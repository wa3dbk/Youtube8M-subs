here for those asking what is the power
shift<00:00:11.380> macro<00:00:11.860> and<00:00:12.040> how<00:00:12.340> do<00:00:12.400> you<00:00:12.910> use<00:00:13.299> it<00:00:14.010> so

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:15.010 
shift macro and how do you use it so

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:16.860 
shift macro and how do you use it so
we're<00:00:15.760> going<00:00:15.850> to<00:00:15.910> go<00:00:16.030> over<00:00:16.180> the<00:00:16.270> power<00:00:16.510> shift

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:16.870 
we're going to go over the power shift

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:18.480 
we're going to go over the power shift
macro<00:00:17.350> today<00:00:17.620> which<00:00:17.800> is<00:00:17.950> essential<00:00:18.460> for

know is how to sum up how to set up a

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.770 
know is how to sum up how to set up a
macro<00:00:29.080> so<00:00:29.260> let's<00:00:29.410> go<00:00:29.500> to<00:00:29.560> macros<00:00:30.040> and<00:00:30.630> we<00:00:31.630> will

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:31.780 
macro so let's go to macros and we will

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:36.389 
macro so let's go to macros and we will
find<00:00:32.610> my<00:00:33.610> power<00:00:33.940> shift<00:00:34.360> macro<00:00:34.890> this<00:00:35.890> macro

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
here will allow you to switch forms as

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.579 
here will allow you to switch forms as
quickly<00:00:48.370> as<00:00:48.579> possible<00:00:48.670> to<00:00:49.359> break<00:00:49.870> snares<00:00:50.319> and

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:50.589 
quickly as possible to break snares and

quickly as possible to break snares and
routes<00:00:50.890> if<00:00:51.579> you're<00:00:51.760> slowed<00:00:52.120> by<00:00:52.359> a<00:00:52.390> frost<00:00:52.780> bolt

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
routes if you're slowed by a frost bolt

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.549 
routes if you're slowed by a frost bolt
things<00:00:54.129> like<00:00:54.339> that<00:00:54.579> this<00:00:55.149> is<00:00:55.449> key<00:00:55.899> to<00:00:56.260> get<00:00:56.379> out

great way to get in and out of that real
quick<00:01:12.399> so<00:01:12.759> let's<00:01:12.790> go<00:01:13.030> into<00:01:13.240> tree<00:01:13.420> form<00:01:13.659> here

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:13.930 
quick so let's go into tree form here

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:16.289 
quick so let's go into tree form here
and<00:01:14.560> I<00:01:14.920> will<00:01:15.040> show<00:01:15.250> you<00:01:15.280> see<00:01:15.700> how<00:01:15.820> that<00:01:15.939> little

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:16.299 
and I will show you see how that little

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:18.179 
and I will show you see how that little
cloud<00:01:16.509> of<00:01:16.659> dust<00:01:16.840> there<00:01:17.170> when<00:01:17.469> you<00:01:17.560> shift<00:01:17.799> forms

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:18.189 
cloud of dust there when you shift forms

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:20.100 
cloud of dust there when you shift forms
as<00:01:18.369> you<00:01:18.399> always<00:01:18.640> do<00:01:18.850> a<00:01:18.880> little<00:01:19.299> puff<00:01:19.750> a<00:01:20.049> little

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.110 
as you always do a little puff a little

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.700 
as you always do a little puff a little
poof<00:01:21.070> when<00:01:21.399> you<00:01:21.430> switch<00:01:21.729> forms<00:01:22.259> let's<00:01:23.259> go<00:01:23.469> into

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:23.710 
poof when you switch forms let's go into

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:25.620 
poof when you switch forms let's go into
tree<00:01:23.890> form<00:01:24.100> with<00:01:24.250> this<00:01:24.430> what<00:01:24.850> this<00:01:25.000> does<00:01:25.329> is

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:25.630 
tree form with this what this does is

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:27.029 
tree form with this what this does is
basically<00:01:25.659> just<00:01:26.229> put<00:01:26.439> you<00:01:26.560> in<00:01:26.710> and<00:01:26.860> out<00:01:26.890> of

00:01:27.029 --> 00:01:27.039 
basically just put you in and out of

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:28.679 
basically just put you in and out of
form<00:01:27.280> really<00:01:27.520> fast<00:01:27.850> as<00:01:28.060> you<00:01:28.149> can<00:01:28.270> see<00:01:28.450> I'm

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:28.689 
form really fast as you can see I'm

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:31.380 
form really fast as you can see I'm
constantly<00:01:29.619> shape-shifting<00:01:30.399> and<00:01:30.579> as<00:01:31.180> you<00:01:31.299> can

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390 
constantly shape-shifting and as you can

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.420 
constantly shape-shifting and as you can
see<00:01:31.570> on<00:01:31.689> my<00:01:31.780> MSB<00:01:32.079> T<00:01:32.469> at<00:01:32.590> the<00:01:32.680> top<00:01:32.890> of<00:01:33.009> my<00:01:33.130> screen

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:33.430 
see on my MSB T at the top of my screen

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:36.300 
see on my MSB T at the top of my screen
here<00:01:33.670> that<00:01:34.320> I'm<00:01:35.320> going<00:01:35.680> in<00:01:35.799> and<00:01:35.920> out<00:01:35.950> of<00:01:36.070> form

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.310 
here that I'm going in and out of form

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.679 
here that I'm going in and out of form
constantly<00:01:38.640> this<00:01:39.640> just<00:01:39.909> allows<00:01:40.149> you<00:01:40.420> to<00:01:40.509> break

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:40.689 
constantly this just allows you to break

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:43.410 
constantly this just allows you to break
roots<00:01:41.020> really<00:01:41.590> quick<00:01:41.829> is<00:01:42.090> what<00:01:43.090> this<00:01:43.270> is

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
roots really quick is what this is

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.929 
roots really quick is what this is
brutes<00:01:43.780> and<00:01:43.960> snares<00:01:44.229> really<00:01:44.619> quick<00:01:44.859> so<00:01:45.700> if<00:01:45.820> you

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:45.939 
brutes and snares really quick so if you

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:48.419 
brutes and snares really quick so if you
guys<00:01:46.030> are<00:01:46.119> looking<00:01:46.450> for<00:01:46.689> a<00:01:46.719> way<00:01:46.930> to<00:01:47.159> have<00:01:48.159> some
