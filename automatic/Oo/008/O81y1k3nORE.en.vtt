going to review a browser called

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.480 
going to review a browser called
stainless<00:00:28.080> steel<00:00:28.800> this<00:00:28.920> is<00:00:29.039> a<00:00:29.070> new<00:00:29.279> browser

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
stainless steel this is a new browser

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.580 
stainless steel this is a new browser
for<00:00:29.910> mac<00:00:29.939> and<00:00:30.090> is<00:00:30.689> not<00:00:31.050> really<00:00:31.320> compatible

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590

with snow leopard yet but does have a
couple<00:00:33.840> new<00:00:34.350> features<00:00:34.790> the<00:00:35.790> flaws<00:00:36.210> that<00:00:36.239> are

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
couple new features the flaws that are

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.510 
couple new features the flaws that are
known<00:00:36.930> are<00:00:37.260> when<00:00:37.500> you<00:00:37.620> minimize<00:00:37.770> it<00:00:38.250> if<00:00:38.399> you

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
known are when you minimize it if you

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.130 
known are when you minimize it if you
have<00:00:38.700> the<00:00:38.790> feature<00:00:39.030> that<00:00:39.270> it<00:00:39.390> minimizes<00:00:39.540> into

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
have the feature that it minimizes into

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.020 
have the feature that it minimizes into
the<00:00:40.230> dock<00:00:40.410> icon<00:00:40.829> it<00:00:41.070> doesn't<00:00:41.399> minimize<00:00:41.550> into

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
the dock icon it doesn't minimize into

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.170 
the dock icon it doesn't minimize into
the<00:00:42.120> dock<00:00:42.270> icon<00:00:42.660> it<00:00:42.840> minimizes<00:00:42.960> over<00:00:43.559> here

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:44.180 
the dock icon it minimizes over here

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.700 
the dock icon it minimizes over here
that's<00:00:45.180> one<00:00:45.329> of<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.450> known<00:00:45.570> features<00:00:45.930> closing

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
that's one of the known features closing

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.610 
that's one of the known features closing
the<00:00:46.739> tab<00:00:47.010> it's<00:00:47.969> a<00:00:48.180> it<00:00:48.270> may<00:00:48.420> take<00:00:48.629> a<00:00:48.660> while<00:00:48.780> which

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
the tab it's a it may take a while which

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.430 
the tab it's a it may take a while which
I<00:00:49.800> haven't<00:00:50.100> had<00:00:50.190> that<00:00:50.219> problem<00:00:50.520> yet<00:00:51.440> booting

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
I haven't had that problem yet booting

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.560 
I haven't had that problem yet booting
up<00:00:52.500> isn't<00:00:52.800> that<00:00:52.890> hard<00:00:53.039> either<00:00:53.219> for<00:00:53.640> me<00:00:53.760> it's

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
up isn't that hard either for me it's

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:55.880 
up isn't that hard either for me it's
pretty<00:00:54.809> simple<00:00:55.020> because<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.500> web<00:00:55.649> browser

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
pretty simple because the web browser

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.520 
pretty simple because the web browser
isn't<00:00:56.160> too<00:00:56.399> bad<00:00:56.550> now<00:00:57.180> here<00:00:57.510> we<00:00:57.629> go<00:00:57.660> here's<00:00:58.469> my

10 seconds now this may confuse people
because<00:01:17.549> it<00:01:17.580> says<00:01:17.880> 10<00:01:18.180> seconds<00:01:18.780> right<00:01:18.960> there

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
because it says 10 seconds right there

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.140

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
but this is really milliseconds because

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.850 
but this is really milliseconds because
this<00:01:21.540> would<00:01:22.020> be<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.259> second<00:01:22.650> area<00:01:23.390> now<00:01:24.390> as<00:01:24.860> far

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
this would be the second area now as far

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.640 
this would be the second area now as far
as<00:01:26.009> loading<00:01:26.280> in<00:01:26.520> time<00:01:26.790> it's<00:01:27.150> pretty<00:01:27.659> good<00:01:27.840> if<00:01:28.080> I

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
as loading in time it's pretty good if I

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.300 
as loading in time it's pretty good if I
go<00:01:28.770> to<00:01:28.829> mini<00:01:29.040> clip<00:01:29.280> and<00:01:29.430> I<00:01:29.490> load<00:01:29.909> a<00:01:29.939> game<00:01:31.310> the

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
flash player is a little bit better than

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.859 
flash player is a little bit better than
anyone<00:01:34.829> before<00:01:35.100> and<00:01:35.490> when<00:01:36.299> you<00:01:36.420> load<00:01:36.600> a<00:01:36.630> page
