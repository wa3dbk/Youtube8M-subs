have it yet well guys today I actually
have<00:00:27.689> a<00:00:27.720> theory<00:00:28.260> about<00:00:28.289> when<00:00:28.800> it's<00:00:28.949> going<00:00:29.070> to

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
have a theory about when it's going to

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.679 
have a theory about when it's going to
come<00:00:29.279> out<00:00:29.460> and<00:00:29.640> that<00:00:29.789> theory<00:00:30.179> is<00:00:30.300> that<00:00:30.330> it<00:00:30.570> will

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
come out and that theory is that it will

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.930 
come out and that theory is that it will
actually<00:00:30.929> be<00:00:31.349> coming<00:00:31.769> out<00:00:31.920> today<00:00:32.219> now<00:00:32.790> before

actually be coming out today now before
you<00:00:33.090> start<00:00:33.210> getting<00:00:33.450> mad<00:00:33.750> and<00:00:33.870> say<00:00:34.020> carnage

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
you start getting mad and say carnage

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.170 
you start getting mad and say carnage
that's<00:00:34.590> a<00:00:34.680> random<00:00:34.980> speculation<00:00:35.640> what<00:00:36.030> are<00:00:36.120> you

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
that's a random speculation what are you

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.370 
that's a random speculation what are you
doing<00:00:36.480> you're<00:00:36.600> just<00:00:36.750> saying<00:00:36.989> random<00:00:37.050> things

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
doing you're just saying random things

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.400 
doing you're just saying random things
well<00:00:38.129> here's<00:00:39.030> why<00:00:39.420> I<00:00:39.450> say<00:00:40.020> this<00:00:40.200> and<00:00:40.350> I

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
well here's why I say this and I

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.560 
well here's why I say this and I
completely<00:00:40.770> overlook<00:00:41.550> this<00:00:41.760> in<00:00:41.969> my<00:00:42.329> last

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
completely overlook this in my last

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.990 
completely overlook this in my last
couple<00:00:42.930> of<00:00:42.960> videos<00:00:43.020> about<00:00:43.500> this<00:00:43.770> but<00:00:44.430> the

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
couple of videos about this but the

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.700 
couple of videos about this but the
biggest<00:00:45.239> thing<00:00:45.570> that<00:00:45.600> I<00:00:45.780> haven't<00:00:46.170> seen<00:00:46.320> anyone

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
biggest thing that I haven't seen anyone

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.760 
biggest thing that I haven't seen anyone
point<00:00:47.160> out<00:00:47.460> yet<00:00:47.789> is<00:00:48.030> that<00:00:48.410> PlayStation<00:00:49.410> stores

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
point out yet is that PlayStation stores

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.790 
point out yet is that PlayStation stores
update<00:00:50.100> on<00:00:50.750> Tuesdays<00:00:51.750> and<00:00:52.050> as<00:00:52.289> a<00:00:52.320> matter<00:00:52.649> of

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
update on Tuesdays and as a matter of

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.279 
update on Tuesdays and as a matter of
fact<00:00:52.890> I<00:00:53.309> think<00:00:53.399> I<00:00:53.969> recall<00:00:54.420> every<00:00:54.930> single

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
fact I think I recall every single

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.130 
fact I think I recall every single
update<00:00:55.710> in<00:00:55.920> North<00:00:56.250> America<00:00:56.910> actually<00:00:57.840> coming

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
update in North America actually coming

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.650 
update in North America actually coming
out<00:00:58.440> when<00:00:58.829> PlayStation<00:00:59.640> stores<00:00:59.910> update<00:01:00.239> I

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
out when PlayStation stores update I

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.330 
out when PlayStation stores update I
know<00:01:00.750> this<00:01:00.989> for<00:01:01.199> certain<00:01:01.230> about<00:01:01.680> certain<00:01:02.039> skin

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
know this for certain about certain skin

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.130 
know this for certain about certain skin
packs<00:01:02.609> and<00:01:02.969> texture<00:01:03.390> packs<00:01:03.629> those<00:01:03.960> have

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
packs and texture packs those have

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.020 
packs and texture packs those have
actually<00:01:04.500> come<00:01:04.650> along<00:01:04.979> with<00:01:05.250> store<00:01:05.549> updates

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
actually come along with store updates

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.210 
actually come along with store updates
so<00:01:06.330> this<00:01:06.540> could<00:01:06.750> very<00:01:06.810> well<00:01:07.260> be<00:01:07.439> what<00:01:08.070> is

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
so this could very well be what is

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.160 
so this could very well be what is
keeping<00:01:08.460> North<00:01:08.880> America<00:01:09.390> from<00:01:09.689> getting<00:01:10.080> the

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
keeping North America from getting the

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.530 
keeping North America from getting the
update<00:01:10.560> and<00:01:10.710> if<00:01:11.159> this<00:01:11.490> is<00:01:11.670> true<00:01:11.970> remember<00:01:12.420> you

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
heard it here first but if it's true

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.030 
heard it here first but if it's true
that<00:01:14.700> means<00:01:14.909> title<00:01:15.479> update<00:01:15.659> 19<00:01:16.320> will<00:01:16.619> be<00:01:16.830> out

today it will be out sometime in the
late<00:01:23.790> afternoon<00:01:24.600> so<00:01:24.930> definitely<00:01:25.170> be<00:01:25.619> looking

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
late afternoon so definitely be looking

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.070 
late afternoon so definitely be looking
forward<00:01:26.369> to<00:01:26.460> that<00:01:26.580> if<00:01:27.030> it<00:01:27.210> is<00:01:27.390> coming<00:01:27.780> out<00:01:27.930> and

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
forward to that if it is coming out and

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.260 
forward to that if it is coming out and
again<00:01:28.439> just<00:01:28.619> remember<00:01:28.799> this<00:01:29.250> is<00:01:29.460> absolutely

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
again just remember this is absolutely

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.179 
again just remember this is absolutely
speculation<00:01:31.110> for<00:01:31.320> all<00:01:31.470> we<00:01:31.680> know<00:01:31.860> they're

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
speculation for all we know they're

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:33.920 
speculation for all we know they're
holding<00:01:32.579> it<00:01:32.640> off<00:01:32.820> for<00:01:33.000> christmas<00:01:33.479> or<00:01:33.720> maybe

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
holding it off for christmas or maybe

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.600 
holding it off for christmas or maybe
even<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.380> day<00:01:34.530> before<00:01:34.560> christmas<00:01:35.340> which<00:01:35.490> is

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
even the day before christmas which is

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.399 
even the day before christmas which is
tomorrow<00:01:36.000> I<00:01:36.270> really<00:01:36.689> just<00:01:36.900> don't<00:01:37.049> know<00:01:37.259> this

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
tomorrow I really just don't know this

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.200 
tomorrow I really just don't know this
is<00:01:37.650> speculation<00:01:37.979> but<00:01:38.400> I<00:01:38.520> wanted<00:01:38.820> to<00:01:38.880> let<00:01:39.090> you

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
is speculation but I wanted to let you

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.600 
is speculation but I wanted to let you
guys<00:01:39.240> know<00:01:39.689> that<00:01:40.170> if<00:01:40.409> it<00:01:40.590> is<00:01:40.740> going<00:01:41.159> to<00:01:41.310> come

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
guys know that if it is going to come

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.330
