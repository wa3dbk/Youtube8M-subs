00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:11.190 
you kind of do it's a little bit fuzzy
but<00:02:08.530> it<00:02:09.310> is<00:02:09.460> totally<00:02:09.759> amazing<00:02:10.570> and<00:02:10.990> worth<00:02:11.140> the

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
but it is totally amazing and worth the

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.100 
but it is totally amazing and worth the
quality<00:02:11.710> the<00:02:12.580> price<00:02:12.790> for<00:02:12.970> the<00:02:13.060> quality<00:02:13.270> now

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
quality the price for the quality now

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.170 
quality the price for the quality now
the<00:02:14.170> other<00:02:14.500> thing<00:02:14.710> is<00:02:15.100> that<00:02:15.190> because<00:02:15.760> it's<00:02:16.090> a

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
the other thing is that because it's a

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.020 
the other thing is that because it's a
lighter<00:02:16.360> print<00:02:16.810> your<00:02:17.740> underwear<00:02:18.400> shows

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
lighter print your underwear shows

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.570 
lighter print your underwear shows
through<00:02:19.420> this<00:02:19.570> but<00:02:19.990> for<00:02:20.680> me<00:02:20.860> I<00:02:21.040> like<00:02:21.340> wearing

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
through this but for me I like wearing

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.310 
through this but for me I like wearing
long<00:02:21.850> tops<00:02:22.120> or<00:02:22.360> dresses<00:02:22.720> with<00:02:22.870> these<00:02:23.020> tights

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.320 
long tops or dresses with these tights

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.610 
long tops or dresses with these tights
so<00:02:23.950> that's<00:02:24.220> not<00:02:24.400> as<00:02:24.580> a<00:02:24.640> big<00:02:25.150> of<00:02:25.300> an<00:02:25.420> issue<00:02:25.600> as<00:02:26.080> it

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
so that's not as a big of an issue as it

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.670 
so that's not as a big of an issue as it
could<00:02:26.980> be<00:02:27.010> but<00:02:27.420> if<00:02:28.420> you<00:02:28.630> plan<00:02:29.200> to<00:02:29.230> wear<00:02:29.470> them

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
could be but if you plan to wear them

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.980 
could be but if you plan to wear them
out<00:02:29.860> without<00:02:30.220> any<00:02:30.520> like<00:02:30.760> long<00:02:31.030> shirt<00:02:31.390> you

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:31.990 
out without any like long shirt you

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:33.840 
out without any like long shirt you
probably<00:02:32.260> just<00:02:32.500> want<00:02:32.620> to<00:02:32.770> go<00:02:32.980> for<00:02:33.280> the<00:02:33.310> darker

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
probably just want to go for the darker

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:37.800 
probably just want to go for the darker
colored<00:02:34.660> tights<00:02:35.250> so<00:02:36.250> those<00:02:36.430> are<00:02:36.459> these<00:02:37.300> ones

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
colored tights so those are these ones

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.150 
colored tights so those are these ones
they<00:02:38.440> also<00:02:38.590> have<00:02:38.980> the<00:02:39.160> other<00:02:39.370> houses<00:02:39.790> too<00:02:40.480> and

they also have the other houses too and

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.040 
they also have the other houses too and

and half of the print but i think i only
got<00:02:56.260> one<00:02:56.500> part<00:02:57.010> of<00:02:57.100> the<00:02:57.190> pattern<00:02:57.370> which<00:02:57.700> is<00:02:57.880> ok

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
got one part of the pattern which is ok

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.840 
got one part of the pattern which is ok
but<00:02:59.320> i<00:02:59.380> was<00:02:59.530> a<00:02:59.560> little<00:02:59.890> bit<00:03:00.190> saddened<00:03:00.519> by<00:03:00.820> that

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:00.850 
but i was a little bit saddened by that

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:03.080 
but i was a little bit saddened by that
once<00:03:01.390> again<00:03:01.690> this<00:03:01.870> is<00:03:02.080> the<00:03:02.110> really<00:03:02.560> light
