00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.980
 around 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:31.420
 the crafter's operation had to be idiomatic 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:33.730
 which gives great art 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:35.680
 there crashed 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.600
 Percent behind 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.790
 Frankfurt was the formal problem it is 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:43.790
 that must also be in the advisory board 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.490
 Duisburg 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:51.490
 Dr 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.630
 if you are already fascinated 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:58.130
 Vareler tester

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:14.580
 Young 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.530
 whether for friendships winzer cultivates 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:19.520
 in the cradle 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.920
 very exciting 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.100
 we are finally celebrating today 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.100
 big events in the history of Koblenz 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:28.900
 first 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:33.700
 30 years ago, Professor Doctor Doctor Leo Navratil founded the Center for 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.530
 Art for therapies 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.490
 a department of the country hospital for psychiatry copying as 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.930
 psychiatric medical department 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.350
 secondly, 25 years ago, this became the object of the living community 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.510
 the artist 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:51.830
 not anymore 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:54.060
 is deactivated to a Bremer 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.340
 and third today is the Governor Erwin PrÃ¶ll 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.670
 In addition, the restoration of the House of Artists opens 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.340
 a milestone that transcends our borders 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.610
 international significance 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.169
 Nasdaq was good news 

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:12.239
 a dealership 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:16.580
 There are many definitions and principles and secrets of art 

00:02:16.579 --> 00:02:20.319
 Fourth, that's what they all need to know about art and culture 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:22.349
 deal with 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:24.719
 and a maxim is 

00:02:24.719 --> 00:02:28.439
 The art is a cut of visible known 

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:31.819
 unknown to the hidden 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:35.369
 Of course this principle also applies to the Gugging artists 

00:02:35.369 --> 00:02:36.699
 no question at all 

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:39.699
 however, for the history of humpback artists 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:43.699
 Zollmann or I'll say it before you have to relax 

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:46.999
 Percent reverse this principle 

00:02:46.999 --> 00:02:49.999
 namely to the ice cream that is there 

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:54.599
 the Gugging artists are unknown from the hidden 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:57.599
 to the visible got d 

00:03:01.809 --> 00:03:03.629
 I miss that 

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:07.809
 a very nice a very nice quote from victims that loves his kids 

00:03:07.809 --> 00:03:11.129
 from the little prince as he says 

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:13.269
 without words Columbia 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:15.639
 Nalbandian 

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:18.409
 that means in German you move now 

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:21.309
 good with the heart 

00:03:21.309 --> 00:03:23.329
 not taken 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:25.189
 and the pictures 

00:03:25.189 --> 00:03:26.429
 the Dow left 

00:03:26.429 --> 00:03:27.409
 Artists 

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:30.229
 it's my heart's formation 

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:31.189
 until 10 

00:03:31.189 --> 00:03:32.389
 take part 

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:35.389
 anyway 

00:03:38.719 --> 00:03:41.059
 he never imagined that 

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:42.989
 Stockholm 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:44.579
 VOX 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:48.789
 it spread like a bombshell among them that was the way it was then 

00:03:48.789 --> 00:03:51.789
 a trend 

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:56.509
 and what could be here now more than now and even more the money 

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:58.439
 and prepare that is 

00:03:58.439 --> 00:04:01.439
 and he is unbelievable the mates of the woman had 

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:08.000
 Kevin Lloyd Webber 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.039
 it was the Welsh for him 

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:13.039
 in Belgium is not just ten percent 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:17.699
 Conditional bondage has something to do with it, we wish 

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:20.709
 I've got her shooting herself meanwhile 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:22.259
 Sci 

00:04:22.259 --> 00:04:26.309
 rented the following companies then you will see how the developers on it 

00:04:26.309 --> 00:04:26.789
 down 

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:29.110
 I was up another morning 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:32.110
 and that's great 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:41.449
 the general public 

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:42.999
 she has 

00:04:42.999 --> 00:04:44.229
 this year 

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:46.430
 to care about something 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:48.729
 The goal is their art 

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:49.580
 in a process
