love<00:00:07.740> this<00:00:07.919> model<00:00:08.610> this<00:00:08.760> analogy<00:00:09.269> and<00:00:09.630> I<00:00:10.019> think

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
love this model this analogy and I think

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.100 
love this model this analogy and I think
it<00:00:10.830> really<00:00:11.010> puts<00:00:11.460> people<00:00:11.910> it<00:00:12.030> helps<00:00:12.269> you<00:00:13.019> know

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
it really puts people it helps you know

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:14.539 
it really puts people it helps you know
them<00:00:13.320> to<00:00:13.410> find<00:00:13.710> a<00:00:13.799> little<00:00:13.889> bit<00:00:14.099> where<00:00:14.280> they<00:00:14.400> are

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
them to find a little bit where they are

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.550 
them to find a little bit where they are
in<00:00:14.670> this<00:00:14.790> pattern<00:00:15.299> and<00:00:15.480> as<00:00:15.630> more<00:00:16.500> information

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
in this pattern and as more information

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.599 
in this pattern and as more information
has<00:00:17.490> come<00:00:17.520> up<00:00:18.060> it<00:00:18.240> just<00:00:18.270> it<00:00:18.720> just<00:00:18.800> really<00:00:19.800> works

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
has come up it just it just really works

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.689 
has come up it just it just really works
really<00:00:20.910> well<00:00:21.029> so<00:00:21.390> here's<00:00:21.840> the<00:00:22.020> basic<00:00:22.170> model

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:22.699 
really well so here's the basic model

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:25.490 
really well so here's the basic model
because<00:00:23.699> bismol<00:00:24.210> was<00:00:24.510> when<00:00:24.930> I<00:00:24.960> first<00:00:25.199> started

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
because bismol was when I first started

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.980 
because bismol was when I first started
the<00:00:25.590> concept<00:00:26.099> was<00:00:26.160> that<00:00:26.340> when<00:00:27.180> we're<00:00:27.359> born<00:00:27.720> we

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
the concept was that when we're born we

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.019 
the concept was that when we're born we
have<00:00:28.109> certain<00:00:28.619> expectations<00:00:28.949> in<00:00:29.519> our<00:00:29.609> life<00:00:29.820> by

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029

by the time when adult or an aged adult

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:06.890 
by the time when adult or an aged adult
we're<00:04:05.489> literally<00:04:05.820> living<00:04:06.239> I'd<00:04:06.450> say<00:04:06.660> in<00:04:06.780> the

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
we're literally living I'd say in the

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:10.040 
we're literally living I'd say in the
closet<00:04:07.560> our<00:04:08.000> possibilities<00:04:09.000> become<00:04:09.450> narrow

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:10.050 
closet our possibilities become narrow

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:11.780 
closet our possibilities become narrow
and<00:04:10.290> they're<00:04:10.500> our<00:04:10.769> focus<00:04:11.190> becomes<00:04:11.459> narrow

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
and they're our focus becomes narrow

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:13.850 
and they're our focus becomes narrow
narrow<00:04:12.150> and<00:04:12.780> what's<00:04:13.050> really<00:04:13.320> fascinating

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:13.860 
narrow and what's really fascinating

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:16.039 
narrow and what's really fascinating
about<00:04:14.340> this<00:04:14.519> is<00:04:14.880> the<00:04:15.030> research<00:04:15.450> that's<00:04:15.720> coming

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
about this is the research that's coming

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:18.380 
about this is the research that's coming
out<00:04:16.260> just<00:04:16.650> every<00:04:17.070> single<00:04:17.459> day<00:04:17.640> on<00:04:17.669> mindfulness

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:18.390 
out just every single day on mindfulness

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:21.020 
out just every single day on mindfulness
on<00:04:18.840> research<00:04:19.260> on<00:04:19.440> the<00:04:19.530> brain<00:04:19.830> and<00:04:20.549> they<00:04:20.700> show

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
on research on the brain and they show

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:24.110 
on research on the brain and they show
dramatically<00:04:21.840> that<00:04:22.320> the<00:04:23.280> neurons<00:04:23.789> that<00:04:23.940> fire

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
dramatically that the neurons that fire

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.400 
dramatically that the neurons that fire
together<00:04:24.690> wire<00:04:25.080> together<00:04:25.590> and<00:04:26.160> if

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:26.410 
together wire together and if

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:28.560 
together wire together and if
we're<00:04:26.530> in<00:04:26.620> a<00:04:26.710> no<00:04:27.070> state<00:04:27.430> a<00:04:27.460> negative<00:04:27.970> state<00:04:28.270> if

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:28.570 
we're in a no state a negative state if

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:31.620 
we're in a no state a negative state if
we're<00:04:28.810> into<00:04:29.200> narrow<00:04:29.650> focused<00:04:30.370> those<00:04:31.210> neurons

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:31.630 
we're into narrow focused those neurons

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:34.710 
we're into narrow focused those neurons
lead<00:04:32.350> us<00:04:32.530> into<00:04:32.800> a<00:04:32.980> rut<00:04:33.280> literally<00:04:33.910> they<00:04:34.300> change

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:34.720 
lead us into a rut literally they change

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.900 
lead us into a rut literally they change
our<00:04:34.900> behavior<00:04:35.500> the<00:04:35.740> limit<00:04:36.160> our<00:04:36.310> behaviors

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:36.910 
our behavior the limit our behaviors

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:39.870 
our behavior the limit our behaviors
they<00:04:37.510> limit<00:04:37.900> our<00:04:38.050> creativity<00:04:38.710> and<00:04:39.280> that's

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:39.880 
they limit our creativity and that's

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:42.540 
they limit our creativity and that's
locked<00:04:40.210> in<00:04:40.420> unless<00:04:41.320> we<00:04:41.530> do<00:04:41.710> something<00:04:41.770> to

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:42.550 
locked in unless we do something to

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:45.330 
locked in unless we do something to
break<00:04:42.790> this<00:04:43.000> pattern
