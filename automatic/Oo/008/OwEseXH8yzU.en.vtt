00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:02.790 
hi I'm Rob Cosman welcome to my shop a

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:04.430 
hi I'm Rob Cosman welcome to my shop a
couple<00:00:03.149> years<00:00:03.480> ago<00:00:03.629> I<00:00:03.750> got<00:00:03.929> together<00:00:04.080> with<00:00:04.319> a

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.440 
couple years ago I got together with a

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.070 
couple years ago I got together with a
company<00:00:04.710> called<00:00:04.859> IBC<00:00:05.400> and<00:00:05.430> we<00:00:05.870> developed<00:00:06.870> a

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
company called IBC and we developed a

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.730 
company called IBC and we developed a
really<00:00:07.649> nice<00:00:08.130> thick<00:00:08.700> blade<00:00:09.599> and<00:00:09.900> back<00:00:10.260> iron

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
really nice thick blade and back iron

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.280 
really nice thick blade and back iron
that<00:00:11.580> would<00:00:11.790> when<00:00:12.150> put<00:00:12.420> in<00:00:12.570> an<00:00:12.690> old<00:00:12.870> stanley

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
that would when put in an old stanley

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:14.480 
that would when put in an old stanley
plane<00:00:13.530> would<00:00:13.799> really<00:00:14.040> improve<00:00:14.370> the

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
plane would really improve the

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.820 
plane would really improve the
performance<00:00:15.000> to<00:00:15.089> where<00:00:15.269> it<00:00:15.750> would<00:00:15.900> perform<00:00:16.410> as

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
performance to where it would perform as

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.370 
performance to where it would perform as
well<00:00:16.859> as<00:00:17.160> a<00:00:17.310> premium<00:00:17.730> plane<00:00:18.060> in<00:00:18.960> fact<00:00:19.170> if<00:00:19.289> you

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
well as a premium plane in fact if you

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.050 
well as a premium plane in fact if you
want<00:00:19.529> to<00:00:19.619> come<00:00:20.340> in<00:00:20.490> here<00:00:20.640> and<00:00:20.730> look<00:00:20.820> have<00:00:21.000> a

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
want to come in here and look have a

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.050 
want to come in here and look have a
look<00:00:21.090> at<00:00:21.300> this<00:00:21.710> compare<00:00:22.710> the<00:00:22.859> two<00:00:23.070> there's<00:00:23.970> a

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
look at this compare the two there's a

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.859 
look at this compare the two there's a
typical<00:00:24.600> stanley<00:00:24.990> number<00:00:25.260> four<00:00:25.500> with<00:00:26.430> the

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:26.869 
typical stanley number four with the

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:29.630 
typical stanley number four with the
original<00:00:27.869> equipment<00:00:28.080> blade<00:00:28.769> and<00:00:29.010> back<00:00:29.189> iron

original equipment blade and back iron

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.280 
original equipment blade and back iron
and<00:00:29.820> then<00:00:30.779> in<00:00:31.109> comparison<00:00:32.160> there's<00:00:32.759> our<00:00:33.290> IBC

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
and then in comparison there's our IBC

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.690 
and then in comparison there's our IBC

this one is 140 sau super thick stable
just<00:00:47.460> absolutely<00:00:47.940> fantastic<00:00:48.120> now<00:00:48.989> here's<00:00:49.710> the

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
just absolutely fantastic now here's the

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.910 
just absolutely fantastic now here's the
problem<00:00:50.039> for<00:00:50.719> some<00:00:51.719> reason<00:00:52.170> a<00:00:52.289> lot<00:00:52.320> of<00:00:52.680> folks

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
problem for some reason a lot of folks

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.580 
problem for some reason a lot of folks
are<00:00:53.280> afraid<00:00:53.520> to<00:00:54.149> put<00:00:54.600> a<00:00:54.629> file<00:00:54.930> to<00:00:55.199> their<00:00:55.320> plane

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
are afraid to put a file to their plane

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:56.900 
are afraid to put a file to their plane
even<00:00:56.129> though<00:00:56.250> it's<00:00:56.399> going<00:00:56.550> to<00:00:56.699> improve

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
even though it's going to improve

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.459 
even though it's going to improve
improve<00:00:57.570> it<00:00:57.750> and<00:00:57.899> make<00:00:58.020> it<00:00:58.050> better

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
improve it and make it better

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.040 
improve it and make it better
and<00:00:59.219> I'm<00:00:59.340> talking<00:00:59.670> about<00:00:59.730> the<00:01:00.000> throat<00:01:00.300> and

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
and I'm talking about the throat and

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.020 
and I'm talking about the throat and
about<00:01:01.320> sixty<00:01:01.949> percent<00:01:02.129> of<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.460> cases<00:01:02.640> you're

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
about sixty percent of the cases you're

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.369 
about sixty percent of the cases you're
going<00:01:03.270> to<00:01:03.390> have<00:01:03.480> to<00:01:03.629> go<00:01:03.750> in<00:01:03.840> and<00:01:04.049> open<00:01:04.140> the

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
going to have to go in and open the

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.170 
going to have to go in and open the
throat<00:01:04.710> up<00:01:04.890> in<00:01:05.309> order<00:01:05.549> to<00:01:05.640> get<00:01:05.790> this<00:01:05.909> extra

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
throat up in order to get this extra

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.440 
throat up in order to get this extra
thick<00:01:06.570> blade<00:01:06.840> to<00:01:07.650> project<00:01:08.150> but<00:01:09.150> there's<00:01:09.330> not

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
thick blade to project but there's not

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.960 
thick blade to project but there's not
there<00:01:09.659> so<00:01:10.100> another<00:01:11.100> reason<00:01:11.520> why<00:01:11.640> you<00:01:11.700> would

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
there so another reason why you would

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.609 
there so another reason why you would
want<00:01:12.000> to<00:01:12.210> do<00:01:12.360> that<00:01:12.540> anyway<00:01:12.960> if<00:01:12.990> you<00:01:13.260> turn<00:01:13.470> the

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
want to do that anyway if you turn the

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.950 
want to do that anyway if you turn the
plane<00:01:13.860> over<00:01:14.100> or<00:01:14.970> actually<00:01:15.270> before<00:01:15.600> we<00:01:15.689> even<00:01:15.840> do

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
plane over or actually before we even do

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.600 
plane over or actually before we even do
that<00:01:16.140> let's<00:01:16.409> take<00:01:16.560> a<00:01:16.590> look<00:01:16.799> and<00:01:16.920> see<00:01:17.159> what<00:01:17.430> this

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
that let's take a look and see what this

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.749 
that let's take a look and see what this
function<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.270> throat<00:01:18.479> actually<00:01:18.720> has<00:01:19.080> in<00:01:19.920> in

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
function the throat actually has in in

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.600 
function the throat actually has in in
stock<00:01:21.119> removal<00:01:21.479> I'm<00:01:22.409> gonna<00:01:22.619> use<00:01:22.860> this<00:01:23.070> chisel

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
stock removal I'm gonna use this chisel

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.830 
stock removal I'm gonna use this chisel
to<00:01:24.450> represent<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.110> blade<00:01:25.350> in<00:01:25.680> a<00:01:25.920> plane<00:01:26.189> and<00:01:26.840> my

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
to represent the blade in a plane and my

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.330 
to represent the blade in a plane and my
square<00:01:28.290> is<00:01:28.619> going<00:01:28.860> to<00:01:28.979> represent<00:01:29.780> this<00:01:30.780> part

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 
square is going to represent this part

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.149 
square is going to represent this part
of<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:33.329> sole<00:01:33.540> of<00:01:33.570> a<00:01:33.780> plane<00:01:34.049> this<00:01:34.470> edge<00:01:34.740> right

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
of the sole of a plane this edge right

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.510 
of the sole of a plane this edge right
here<00:01:35.220> just<00:01:36.210> ahead<00:01:36.450> of<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.659> blade<00:01:37.040> as<00:01:38.040> you<00:01:38.340> move

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
here just ahead of the blade as you move

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.899 
here just ahead of the blade as you move
the<00:01:38.729> two<00:01:38.880> of<00:01:38.970> them<00:01:39.119> closer<00:01:39.360> together<00:01:40.909> that

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
the two of them closer together that

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.240 
the two of them closer together that
part<00:01:42.270> of<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.450> sole<00:01:42.750> acts<00:01:43.170> to<00:01:43.619> support<00:01:44.100> the

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
part of the sole acts to support the

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.999 
part of the sole acts to support the
wood<00:01:44.460> fiber<00:01:44.810> so<00:01:45.810> that<00:01:45.990> as<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.409> blade<00:01:46.710> is

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
wood fiber so that as the blade is

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.639 
wood fiber so that as the blade is
starting<00:01:47.460> to<00:01:47.610> cause<00:01:47.909> it<00:01:48.119> to<00:01:48.149> lift<00:01:48.450> up<00:01:48.720> the<00:01:49.320> sole

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
starting to cause it to lift up the sole

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.440 
starting to cause it to lift up the sole
holds<00:01:50.100> it<00:01:50.189> in<00:01:50.310> place<00:01:50.520> and<00:01:50.759> you're<00:01:50.909> able<00:01:51.060> to<00:01:51.210> cut

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
holds it in place and you're able to cut

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.260 
holds it in place and you're able to cut
it<00:01:51.570> nice<00:01:51.720> and<00:01:51.750> clean<00:01:52.170> without<00:01:52.380> any<00:01:52.680> tear-out

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
it nice and clean without any tear-out

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.480 
it nice and clean without any tear-out
that's<00:01:54.270> the<00:01:54.509> thought<00:01:54.659> anyway<00:01:55.110> well<00:01:55.950> if<00:01:56.250> your

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
that's the thought anyway well if your

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.969 
that's the thought anyway well if your

maybe 115 years but you look at that

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:11.600 
maybe 115 years but you look at that
throat<00:02:07.799> okay<00:02:08.399> see<00:02:09.060> that<00:02:09.239> it's<00:02:10.110> chipped<00:02:10.610> it's

that we're talking about because it's

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:18.640

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
probably not going to touch the wood

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.600 
probably not going to touch the wood

opposed<00:02:22.610> to<00:02:22.820> looking<00:02:23.300> at<00:02:23.630> this<00:02:24.160> plane<00:02:25.160> that

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
opposed to looking at this plane that

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.090 
opposed to looking at this plane that
I've<00:02:25.510> refurbished<00:02:26.510> I've<00:02:27.350> gone<00:02:27.620> in<00:02:27.860> and<00:02:28.010> I

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.100 
I've refurbished I've gone in and I

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:29.950 
I've refurbished I've gone in and I
filed<00:02:28.430> the<00:02:28.610> throat<00:02:28.910> to<00:02:29.180> get<00:02:29.330> it<00:02:29.420> open<00:02:29.690> enough

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:29.960 
filed the throat to get it open enough

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:31.990 
filed the throat to get it open enough
for<00:02:30.260> this<00:02:30.380> blade<00:02:30.620> to<00:02:30.770> project<00:02:31.190> but<00:02:31.700> I've<00:02:31.820> also

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
for this blade to project but I've also

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.330 
for this blade to project but I've also
made<00:02:32.330> it<00:02:32.480> nice<00:02:32.720> and<00:02:32.750> square<00:02:33.500> and<00:02:33.740> straight<00:02:34.310> so

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
made it nice and square and straight so

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.160 
made it nice and square and straight so
that<00:02:34.730> it<00:02:34.820> lines<00:02:35.000> up<00:02:35.270> roommate's<00:02:35.630> up<00:02:35.810> perfectly

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
that it lines up roommate's up perfectly

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:37.210 
that it lines up roommate's up perfectly
with<00:02:36.230> the<00:02:36.380> blade<00:02:36.560> now<00:02:36.710> I<00:02:36.740> don't<00:02:36.860> have<00:02:37.100> it

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
with the blade now I don't have it

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.010 
with the blade now I don't have it
closed<00:02:37.430> up<00:02:37.640> tight<00:02:37.670> that<00:02:38.450> would<00:02:38.600> be<00:02:38.720> a<00:02:38.750> fairly

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.020 
closed up tight that would be a fairly

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.710 
closed up tight that would be a fairly
normal<00:02:39.470> setting<00:02:39.830> if<00:02:40.220> I<00:02:40.430> was<00:02:40.580> using<00:02:41.060> this<00:02:41.480> to

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
normal setting if I was using this to

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.620 
normal setting if I was using this to
work<00:02:42.500> on<00:02:42.680> figured<00:02:43.160> wood<00:02:43.340> I'd<00:02:43.880> have<00:02:44.150> that

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 
work on figured wood I'd have that

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:46.510 
work on figured wood I'd have that
throat<00:02:44.960> open<00:02:45.230> it<00:02:45.290> would<00:02:45.350> be<00:02:45.470> 1/4<00:02:46.070> of<00:02:46.160> that<00:02:46.190> gap

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:46.520 
throat open it would be 1/4 of that gap

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.850 
throat open it would be 1/4 of that gap
but<00:02:47.300> because<00:02:47.660> I've<00:02:47.840> gone<00:02:48.050> in<00:02:48.260> and<00:02:48.410> filed<00:02:48.650> it

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
but because I've gone in and filed it

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:49.900 
but because I've gone in and filed it
and<00:02:48.950> straightened<00:02:49.310> it<00:02:49.370> I<00:02:49.460> would<00:02:49.580> be<00:02:49.700> able<00:02:49.790> to

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910 
and straightened it I would be able to

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:51.190 
and straightened it I would be able to
do<00:02:50.120> that<00:02:50.300> you're<00:02:50.660> not<00:02:50.690> going<00:02:50.810> to<00:02:50.930> be<00:02:51.020> able<00:02:51.080> to

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
do that you're not going to be able to

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.900 
do that you're not going to be able to
do<00:02:51.350> it<00:02:51.440> with<00:02:51.590> some<00:02:51.770> of<00:02:51.830> those<00:02:51.890> first<00:02:52.370> examples

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
do it with some of those first examples

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:54.430 
do it with some of those first examples
we'll<00:02:53.600> look<00:02:53.750> at<00:02:53.870> this<00:02:53.990> one

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
we'll look at this one

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.770 
we'll look at this one
here's<00:02:54.920> another<00:02:55.190> bad<00:02:55.460> example<00:02:55.940> it's<00:02:56.060> just<00:02:56.210> use

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
here's another bad example it's just use

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.320 
here's another bad example it's just use
and<00:02:56.990> abuse<00:02:57.200> is<00:02:57.410> gonna<00:02:57.590> cause<00:02:57.860> that<00:02:58.130> to<00:02:58.310> go<00:02:58.490> be

00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.330 
and abuse is gonna cause that to go be

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:01.060 
and abuse is gonna cause that to go be
less<00:02:59.600> than<00:02:59.870> what<00:03:00.050> you<00:03:00.170> want<00:03:00.410> which<00:03:00.650> is<00:03:00.800> nice

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.070 
less than what you want which is nice

less than what you want which is nice

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:03.740 
and crisp along this line so what do you

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:06.250 
and crisp along this line so what do you
have<00:03:03.830> to<00:03:03.980> do<00:03:04.130> first<00:03:04.850> of<00:03:05.060> all<00:03:05.180> if<00:03:05.840> you're<00:03:06.050> afraid

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
have to do first of all if you're afraid

of working on your own plane you can

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.610 
of working on your own plane you can
usually<00:03:07.940> pick<00:03:08.330> one<00:03:08.480> of<00:03:08.600> these<00:03:08.690> up<00:03:08.750> off<00:03:09.140> eBay

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
usually pick one of these up off eBay

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:12.370 
usually pick one of these up off eBay
for<00:03:10.370> $20<00:03:11.090> or<00:03:11.240> less<00:03:11.270> they're<00:03:11.780> not<00:03:11.960> expensive

well<00:03:28.190> I'll<00:03:28.280> take<00:03:28.520> this<00:03:28.670> off<00:03:28.880> just<00:03:28.910> in<00:03:29.209> case<00:03:29.390> but

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:29.600 
well I'll take this off just in case but

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.960 
well I'll take this off just in case but
I'm<00:03:29.720> gonna<00:03:29.930> bumping<00:03:30.260> into<00:03:30.410> anyway<00:03:30.940> like<00:03:31.940> I

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:34.100 
know I wouldn't I normally do a lot more

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:35.770 
know I wouldn't I normally do a lot more
to<00:03:34.310> the<00:03:34.430> plane<00:03:34.640> before<00:03:34.850> I<00:03:35.030> get<00:03:35.239> to<00:03:35.360> this<00:03:35.480> stage

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
to the plane before I get to this stage

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:37.479 
to the plane before I get to this stage
but<00:03:36.140> I'll<00:03:36.290> just<00:03:36.470> show<00:03:36.650> you<00:03:36.709> how<00:03:36.950> easy<00:03:37.160> it<00:03:37.400> is

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:37.489 
but I'll just show you how easy it is

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:44.820 
but I'll just show you how easy it is
I'm<00:03:38.360> gonna<00:03:38.510> set<00:03:38.810> this<00:03:38.930> in<00:03:39.110> the<00:03:39.200> vise<00:03:42.550> not<00:03:43.550> right

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:44.830 
I'm gonna set this in the vise not right

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:47.170 
I'm gonna set this in the vise not right
hold<00:03:45.830> it<00:03:46.070> but<00:03:46.400> don't<00:03:46.640> clamp<00:03:46.940> it<00:03:47.090> with

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 
hold it but don't clamp it with

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:50.020 
hold it but don't clamp it with
excessive<00:03:47.720> pressure<00:03:47.989> you<00:03:48.200> don't<00:03:48.380> want<00:03:48.530> to<00:03:49.030> you

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.030 
excessive pressure you don't want to you

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:51.460 
excessive pressure you don't want to you
don't<00:03:50.120> want<00:03:50.239> to<00:03:50.420> break<00:03:50.600> it<00:03:50.840> and<00:03:51.080> that's<00:03:51.290> in<00:03:51.440> a

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:51.470 
don't want to break it and that's in a

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:53.500 
don't want to break it and that's in a
metal<00:03:51.830> vise<00:03:52.040> you<00:03:52.280> can<00:03:52.459> snap<00:03:52.730> that<00:03:52.760> casting

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510 
metal vise you can snap that casting

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:54.729 
metal vise you can snap that casting
that's<00:03:53.690> not<00:03:53.840> that<00:03:54.080> strong

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:54.739 
that's not that strong

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:58.060 
that's not that strong

want the last part of the sole to be
touching<00:04:16.160> the<00:04:16.370> wood<00:04:16.519> fiber<00:04:16.730> just<00:04:17.180> ahead<00:04:17.480> of

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:17.510 
touching the wood fiber just ahead of

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:21.789 
touching the wood fiber just ahead of
the<00:04:17.690> blade<00:04:17.900> and<00:04:18.440> when<00:04:18.890> I<00:04:18.980> do<00:04:19.040> this<00:04:19.459> I<00:04:20.799> I'm

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:21.799 
the blade and when I do this I I'm

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:24.219 
the blade and when I do this I I'm
always<00:04:22.100> moving<00:04:22.520> the<00:04:22.729> play<00:04:22.940> this<00:04:23.240> the<00:04:23.600> file

00:04:24.219 --> 00:04:24.229 
always moving the play this the file

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:25.379 
always moving the play this the file
laterally

00:04:25.379 --> 00:04:25.389 
laterally

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:27.779 
laterally
as<00:04:25.479> I<00:04:25.749> file<00:04:26.080> it's<00:04:26.860> best<00:04:27.219> to<00:04:27.310> actually<00:04:27.669> have<00:04:27.759> a

00:04:27.779 --> 00:04:27.789 
as I file it's best to actually have a

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:29.520 
as I file it's best to actually have a
file<00:04:28.060> that<00:04:28.090> has<00:04:28.360> safe<00:04:28.659> edges<00:04:29.080> you'll<00:04:29.259> notice

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:29.530 
file that has safe edges you'll notice

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:31.320 
file that has safe edges you'll notice
that<00:04:29.620> this<00:04:29.800> one<00:04:29.860> ain't<00:04:30.610> gonna<00:04:30.729> grab<00:04:30.999> the<00:04:31.120> file

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.330 
that this one ain't gonna grab the file

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.689 
that this one ain't gonna grab the file
for<00:04:31.569> me<00:04:31.689> that's<00:04:31.840> in<00:04:31.990> my<00:04:32.080> yellow<00:04:32.229> case<00:04:32.699> this

00:04:33.689 --> 00:04:33.699 
for me that's in my yellow case this

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:36.360 
for me that's in my yellow case this
file<00:04:34.300> has<00:04:34.539> teeth<00:04:34.870> on<00:04:35.050> the<00:04:35.110> outside<00:04:35.439> edge<00:04:35.620> on

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.370 
file has teeth on the outside edge on

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:38.489 
file has teeth on the outside edge on
both<00:04:36.580> edges<00:04:36.759> so<00:04:37.029> if<00:04:37.120> you're<00:04:37.240> not<00:04:37.389> careful<00:04:37.629> you

00:04:38.489 --> 00:04:38.499 
both edges so if you're not careful you

00:04:38.499 --> 00:04:40.830 
both edges so if you're not careful you
may<00:04:38.680> end<00:04:38.860> up<00:04:39.009> making<00:04:39.310> the<00:04:39.909> mouth<00:04:40.120> wider<00:04:40.479> this

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:40.840 
may end up making the mouth wider this

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:42.360 
may end up making the mouth wider this
way<00:04:41.080> and<00:04:41.259> we<00:04:41.319> don't<00:04:41.439> need<00:04:41.650> that<00:04:41.889> we<00:04:42.009> just<00:04:42.189> need

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:42.370 
way and we don't need that we just need

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:45.529 
way and we don't need that we just need
it<00:04:42.490> wider<00:04:42.819> in<00:04:43.719> this<00:04:43.900> case<00:04:44.110> up<00:04:44.349> and<00:04:44.560> down<00:04:44.740> so

00:04:45.529 --> 00:04:45.539 
it wider in this case up and down so

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:48.330 
it wider in this case up and down so
okay<00:04:46.539> here's<00:04:46.749> here's<00:04:47.080> a<00:04:47.139> safe<00:04:47.409> file<00:04:47.710> there's

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:48.340 
okay here's here's a safe file there's

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.550 
okay here's here's a safe file there's
no<00:04:48.460> teeth<00:04:48.699> on<00:04:48.879> the<00:04:48.969> Untied<00:04:49.330> edges<00:04:49.659> so<00:04:50.349> I<00:04:50.379> don't

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:50.560 
no teeth on the Untied edges so I don't

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:51.869 
no teeth on the Untied edges so I don't
have<00:04:50.650> to<00:04:50.740> worry<00:04:50.919> about<00:04:51.039> going<00:04:51.249> up<00:04:51.460> against<00:04:51.789> the

00:04:51.869 --> 00:04:51.879 
have to worry about going up against the

00:04:51.879 --> 00:04:54.059 
have to worry about going up against the
side<00:04:52.120> and<00:04:52.300> cutting<00:04:52.629> so<00:04:53.169> what<00:04:53.319> I<00:04:53.349> would<00:04:53.590> do<00:04:53.740> is<00:04:54.009> I

00:04:54.059 --> 00:04:54.069 
side and cutting so what I would do is I

00:04:54.069 --> 00:04:56.249 
side and cutting so what I would do is I
would<00:04:54.249> actually<00:04:54.969> twist<00:04:55.569> the<00:04:55.749> file<00:04:56.020> a<00:04:56.139> little

00:04:56.249 --> 00:04:56.259 
would actually twist the file a little

00:04:56.259 --> 00:04:58.170 
would actually twist the file a little
bit<00:04:56.409> like<00:04:56.650> this<00:04:56.889> bearing<00:04:57.340> down<00:04:57.520> on<00:04:57.580> the<00:04:57.849> inside

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:58.180 
bit like this bearing down on the inside

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:59.550 
bit like this bearing down on the inside
corner<00:04:58.449> did<00:04:58.750> you<00:04:58.840> find<00:04:59.020> that<00:04:59.139> file<00:04:59.349> it's

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560 
corner did you find that file it's

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.369 
corner did you find that file it's
sharper<00:04:59.919> than<00:05:00.009> this<00:05:00.159> one<00:05:00.990> twist<00:05:01.990> a<00:05:02.110> little<00:05:02.139> bit

00:05:02.369 --> 00:05:02.379 
sharper than this one twist a little bit

00:05:02.379 --> 00:05:04.740 
sharper than this one twist a little bit
like<00:05:02.620> that<00:05:02.830> as<00:05:03.069> I<00:05:03.279> file<00:05:03.610> and<00:05:03.969> move<00:05:04.240> laterally

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:04.750 
like that as I file and move laterally

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:06.869 
like that as I file and move laterally
and<00:05:05.080> that<00:05:05.169> causes<00:05:05.770> it<00:05:05.919> to<00:05:06.039> cut<00:05:06.279> down<00:05:06.430> in<00:05:06.639> here<00:05:06.849> a

00:05:06.869 --> 00:05:06.879 
and that causes it to cut down in here a

00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:08.519 
and that causes it to cut down in here a
little<00:05:06.969> bit<00:05:07.120> you<00:05:07.270> want<00:05:07.569> to<00:05:07.659> avoid<00:05:07.930> if<00:05:08.229> you

00:05:08.519 --> 00:05:08.529 
little bit you want to avoid if you

00:05:08.529 --> 00:05:09.809 
little bit you want to avoid if you
don't<00:05:08.830> you<00:05:09.009> may<00:05:09.159> end<00:05:09.279> up<00:05:09.310> with<00:05:09.400> a<00:05:09.490> little<00:05:09.729> bit

00:05:09.809 --> 00:05:09.819 
don't you may end up with a little bit

00:05:09.819 --> 00:05:11.420 
don't you may end up with a little bit
of<00:05:09.879> addition<00:05:10.449> there<00:05:10.629> and<00:05:10.779> I<00:05:10.840> don't<00:05:10.900> want<00:05:11.199> that

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:11.430 
of addition there and I don't want that

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:18.360 
of addition there and I don't want that
so<00:05:12.430> I'm<00:05:13.029> always<00:05:13.210> moving<00:05:13.659> laterally<00:05:14.050> so<00:05:17.370> I

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:18.370
