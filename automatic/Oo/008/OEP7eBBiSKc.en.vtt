00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:06.320
 hello to you investigator and in that 

00:00:03.469 --> 00:00:11.900
 the form said that I will show you how to understate 

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:14.169
 I will sort it out now so I will 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:14.169
 disassembled 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:26.030
 there my worth another aprioristic spare 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:29.900
 wheels that's how I for it is not a pity for me just 

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:35.560
 The video does not load as it may take for 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:41.000
 explain and so shorter first to start 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:45.560
 remove the engine so here I am shorter 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.850
 I say it is easily removed for that here 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:55.280
 drank on enter where 's the wheel passes 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:58.850
 it starts to bite knife rack 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:04.690
 and you can on the other hand also do 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:10.670
 just pull the wheel to take off 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:16.299
 the middle of seregin should be her 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:20.600
 squeeze with pliers eat or hearts 

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:23.900
 some chips and for charging 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:31.240
 understand how pieces and just shoot 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:39.170
 here and so on piece here then you do 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:42.320
 missed will increase shorter here you see here 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:46.010
 this type is surrounded by a guy sign to this 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:48.860
 called this one shot already 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:56.030
 Now put the engine so he does not work 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:02:01.970
 it will be because it is and there is no menu 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:07.400
 It was just like that 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:11.920
 all here less than half bite 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:17.420
 and prepare everything and the straw 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:22.600
 putting on her squeeze and here you can 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:27.700
 it was different to do i did so here 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:27.700
 file saw off and so here 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:36.230
 in short, you understand how to whiten it 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:40.430
 file and see it to be 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:45.020
 evenly wheels me of course barely 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:48.170
 I had a front end there 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:51.080
 raised then i took the knife and started like this 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:54.400
 here's an article here that even lick and 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:03:00.340
 nothing needs just been conducted just she 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:00.340
 the elk sits down and everything and the wheels are spinning 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:09.530
 so here it is understated in principle 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:13.989
 it's okay just another priors I 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:19.250
 another case I then after 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:23.330
 After this video I will show how I did 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:28.580
 lambo doors on it is a super cat i have here 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:34.160
 there are a couple of wheels of such painted here 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:37.600
 one thing of course the truth is broken it became and 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.600
 wheels from this priors 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:45.500
 I now have two priors 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:48.940
 okay one not drive at a time not 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:54.200
 it turned out but I fixed it all 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:59.319
 ok by the way here 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:04:02.900
 Here is the bottom from which I did the second 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:07.670
 modelka and this is another modelka which 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:10.880
 I did not work it by the way this one 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:13.430
 the hatch is filmed this is the prior it is not her 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:16.370
 stung and just then rearranged this one 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:19.900
 I later turned out and then paint 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:22.550
 got off and just swapped 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:32.030
 by the way priors photoshoot these wheels 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:34.210
 big here as it was and by the way I 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:41.810
 I'll tell you now how to saw off 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:46.870
 At first I cut off the knife so then 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:51.040
 we are here a little bit here at the legs broke 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:55.820
 exactly this is better to take a file 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:58.910
 dopili log in copy here when 

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:59.720
 he is not going to have to go here I 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:04.160
 to climb 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:08.620
 and here more than once I got so useful 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:15.200
 here so to me somewhere somewhere from lying around 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:18.200
 So here and so would be, and then 

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:22.130
 start here it turns you here 

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:24.289
 so here she is holding on to you here and then 

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:34.190
 that's it just cut it off 

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:36.440
 and shoot everything like this 

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:39.560
 the next video will show how 

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:41.360
 do lambo doors on this model 

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:46.780
 I have a standard door I am with her more 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:46.780
 I will not do anything here 

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:55.060
