on<00:00:30.359> the<00:00:30.449> pull-up<00:00:30.660> exercise<00:00:31.289> in<00:00:31.500> my<00:00:31.619> opinion

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
on the pull-up exercise in my opinion

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.560 
on the pull-up exercise in my opinion
you<00:00:32.250> can<00:00:32.340> also<00:00:32.489> do<00:00:32.730> Close<00:00:33.059> Grip<00:00:33.239> pull-ups

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
you can also do Close Grip pull-ups

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.080 
you can also do Close Grip pull-ups
however<00:00:34.079> personally<00:00:35.010> I<00:00:35.040> don't<00:00:35.190> really<00:00:35.610> use<00:00:35.880> it

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
however personally I don't really use it

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.090 
however personally I don't really use it
very<00:00:36.239> often<00:00:36.570> and<00:00:37.020> also<00:00:37.320> it<00:00:37.500> put<00:00:37.710> some<00:00:37.739> more

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
very often and also it put some more

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.729 
very often and also it put some more
stress<00:00:38.489> on<00:00:38.670> your<00:00:39.059> wrists<00:00:39.780> especially<00:00:40.379> if<00:00:40.559> you

use a straight bar and with white grip
pull-ups<00:00:44.010> you<00:00:44.280> can<00:00:44.460> often<00:00:44.640> use<00:00:45.090> a<00:00:45.440> specific

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
pull-ups you can often use a specific

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.119 
pull-ups you can often use a specific
bar<00:00:47.010> with<00:00:47.550> these<00:00:48.090> bent<00:00:48.420> ends<00:00:48.719> one<00:00:49.440> of<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.829> best

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
bar with these bent ends one of the best

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.939 
bar with these bent ends one of the best
overall<00:00:50.660> exercises<00:00:51.660> is<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:52.140> deadlift<00:00:52.710> and

overall exercises is the deadlift and

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.760 
overall exercises is the deadlift and
this<00:00:53.430> works<00:00:53.730> out<00:00:53.969> most<00:00:54.390> of<00:00:54.570> your<00:00:54.780> bag<00:00:55.079> meaning

muscle your latissimus dorsi and also it

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.549 
muscle your latissimus dorsi and also it
will<00:01:01.410> cover<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:02.280> lower<00:01:02.760> back<00:01:03.210> including<00:01:04.080> your

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
lot of exercises that are specifically

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.109 
lot of exercises that are specifically
targeting<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.350> trapezius<00:01:10.979> muscle<00:01:11.430> however<00:01:11.790> a

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
targeting the trapezius muscle however a

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.300 
targeting the trapezius muscle however a
lot<00:01:12.479> of<00:01:12.600> rowing<00:01:13.049> exercises<00:01:13.860> will<00:01:14.040> indirectly

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
lot of rowing exercises will indirectly

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.270 
lot of rowing exercises will indirectly
targeted<00:01:15.240> but<00:01:15.720> also<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:16.560> best<00:01:16.740> exercise<00:01:17.250> for

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
targeted but also the best exercise for

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.870 
targeted but also the best exercise for
the<00:01:17.570> trapezius<00:01:18.570> muscle<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.290> truck<00:01:19.680> and<00:01:19.890> there

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
the trapezius muscle the truck and there

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.999 
the trapezius muscle the truck and there
are<00:01:21.030> two<00:01:21.240> variations<00:01:21.600> of<00:01:22.049> this<00:01:22.229> as<00:01:22.530> far<00:01:22.770> as<00:01:22.890> I

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
are two variations of this as far as I

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.340 
are two variations of this as far as I
know<00:01:23.070> one<00:01:23.790> is<00:01:23.939> with<00:01:24.180> a<00:01:24.390> barbell<00:01:24.840> which<00:01:25.200> I

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
know one is with a barbell which I

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.050 
know one is with a barbell which I
demonstrated<00:01:25.920> in<00:01:26.070> this<00:01:26.130> video<00:01:26.310> and<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.939> other

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
demonstrated in this video and the other

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.870 
demonstrated in this video and the other
one<00:01:27.299> is<00:01:27.330> with<00:01:27.810> two<00:01:28.200> dumbbells<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:29.460> technique

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
one is with two dumbbells the technique

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.670 
one is with two dumbbells the technique
is<00:01:30.000> pretty<00:01:30.360> much<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:30.780> same<00:01:31.020> other<00:01:31.320> than<00:01:31.619> that

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
is pretty much the same other than that

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.100 
is pretty much the same other than that
the<00:01:32.250> dumbbells<00:01:32.700> will<00:01:32.970> be<00:01:33.060> held<00:01:33.329> next<00:01:33.479> to<00:01:33.930> your

exercises a lot of people say that doing

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.569 
exercises a lot of people say that doing
pull-ups<00:01:39.930> will<00:01:40.259> increase<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.950> width<00:01:41.220> of<00:01:41.460> your

latissimus dorsi and if you are doing
rows<00:01:44.880> then<00:01:45.240> you<00:01:45.420> will<00:01:45.600> increase<00:01:46.140> the

rows then you will increase the

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.859 
rows then you will increase the

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.980 
one-arm dumbbell row which I demonstrate
right<00:02:04.290> now

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
right now

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.440 
right now
and<00:02:05.079> this<00:02:05.409> is<00:02:05.590> very<00:02:05.799> helpful<00:02:06.520> if<00:02:07.000> you<00:02:07.119> want<00:02:07.329> to

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
and this is very helpful if you want to

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.749 
and this is very helpful if you want to
develop<00:02:07.630> one<00:02:08.500> lab<00:02:08.770> at<00:02:09.069> the<00:02:09.190> time<00:02:09.399> so<00:02:09.610> you<00:02:09.729> can

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
develop one lab at the time so you can

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:11.790 
develop one lab at the time so you can
really<00:02:10.209> concentrate<00:02:10.450> on<00:02:10.869> one<00:02:11.290> side<00:02:11.560> only

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
really concentrate on one side only

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.550 
really concentrate on one side only
rather<00:02:12.310> than<00:02:12.610> on<00:02:12.880> both<00:02:13.239> sides<00:02:13.780> as<00:02:14.080> you<00:02:14.410> would

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
rather than on both sides as you would

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.339 
rather than on both sides as you would
do<00:02:14.709> with<00:02:14.950> a<00:02:15.220> barbell<00:02:15.670> row<00:02:16.030> you<00:02:16.300> can<00:02:16.330> also<00:02:16.810> do<00:02:17.140> to

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:17.349 
do with a barbell row you can also do to

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:19.770 
do with a barbell row you can also do to
bodyweight<00:02:17.950> exercises<00:02:18.489> that<00:02:19.030> are<00:02:19.090> similar<00:02:19.540> to

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
bodyweight exercises that are similar to

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.110 
bodyweight exercises that are similar to
the<00:02:20.200> ones<00:02:20.380> that<00:02:20.560> I<00:02:20.620> already<00:02:20.950> demonstrated<00:02:21.790> the

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
the ones that I already demonstrated the

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.660 
the ones that I already demonstrated the
first<00:02:22.420> one<00:02:22.630> is<00:02:22.840> a<00:02:22.930> body<00:02:23.470> weights<00:02:23.800> row<00:02:24.130> so<00:02:24.430> for

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
first one is a body weights row so for

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.040 
first one is a body weights row so for
this<00:02:24.819> you<00:02:24.970> will<00:02:25.000> need<00:02:25.150> something<00:02:25.810> like<00:02:26.019> a

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
this you will need something like a

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.229 
this you will need something like a
squat<00:02:26.530> rack<00:02:26.860> on<00:02:27.069> which<00:02:27.250> you<00:02:27.370> can<00:02:27.580> place<00:02:27.819> a<00:02:27.849> bar

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 
squat rack on which you can place a bar

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:30.300 
squat rack on which you can place a bar
or<00:02:28.450> even<00:02:29.050> if<00:02:29.140> you're<00:02:29.290> more<00:02:29.590> creative<00:02:29.769> if<00:02:30.190> you

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
or even if you're more creative if you

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.210 
or even if you're more creative if you
can<00:02:30.550> place<00:02:30.940> two<00:02:31.239> chairs<00:02:31.630> I<00:02:31.930> close<00:02:32.920> to<00:02:33.099> each

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
can place two chairs I close to each

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.160 
can place two chairs I close to each
other<00:02:33.400> and<00:02:33.670> then<00:02:33.849> place<00:02:34.150> a<00:02:34.180> bar<00:02:34.480> on<00:02:34.510> top<00:02:34.690> of<00:02:35.019> it

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
other and then place a bar on top of it

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.440
