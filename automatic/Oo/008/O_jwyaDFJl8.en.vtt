00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.040
 hi i'm a princess today we will make out 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.609
 several interesting theories on the game fnaf 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.950
 3 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.690
 although the game has not yet come out but they are already going 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.429
 a lot of rumors and I wanted 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.049
 tell you about your guesses and 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.549
 theories about this game 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.130
 be sure to like friends 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.109
 support my channel every like you 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.810
 I am very happy and now let's 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.880
 let's start with the first theory if you go in now 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.039
 on the official website soon we will see 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.560
 card which will be in the third part of the game 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.990
 and if you download it and lighten it up a little 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.120
 a picture then several tunnels will appear 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.370
 My personal opinion is that this system 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.469
 ventilation which will move 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.809
 new animatronic 

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:41.850
 how do you think friends what is this tunnel 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:45.120
 write your options in the comments under 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.010
 video we continue if you go to 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.379
 page of the game in the incentive we can 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.960
 see several screenshots on one 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.300
 from them we will see that camera 4 is on and 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.300
 you can clearly see where it is white stripes 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.219
 on the sides but what do they mean if 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.710
 we look at another screenshot from the cameras 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.510
 then there are no such strips looking 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.670
 once in the first screenshot, we will see that 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.590
 on the left is that new animatronic 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.659
 This means that the two strips on the sides 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.250
 cameras may alert us and 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.619
 suggest which room is in 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.270
 animatronic also be sure to write in 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.549
 comments your options on this 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.100
 about and let's move on to the final 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.540
 theories go back again to the scott site and 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.119
 see the page code 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.400
 here we can see the inscription com15 and 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.860
 maybe it says that in the game 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.020
 there will be 15 surveillance cameras 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.509
 however, if we look at the screenshot then 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.369
 see that there are only 10 cameras but still 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.259
 then the other five maybe they 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.000
 are vented and so on them 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.250
 switch then you need to click on 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.380
 translucent button that says click 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.210
 although most likely this button is just 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.430
 disable cctv mode 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.280
 write your options in the comments 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.600
 friends and on this let's finish 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.700
 I hope you liked the release 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.619
