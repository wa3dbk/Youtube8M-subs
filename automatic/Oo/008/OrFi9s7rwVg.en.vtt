00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
you know surprisingly it was very

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:40.790 
you know surprisingly it was very
difficult<00:00:39.809> I<00:00:40.200> thought<00:00:40.350> it<00:00:40.440> was<00:00:40.500> gonna<00:00:40.620> be<00:00:40.710> a

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
difficult I thought it was gonna be a

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.619 
difficult I thought it was gonna be a
lot<00:00:40.950> easier<00:00:41.059> because<00:00:42.059> coming<00:00:42.480> in<00:00:42.540> the

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
lot easier because coming in the

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.260 
lot easier because coming in the
offseason<00:00:42.840> I<00:00:43.500> keep<00:00:44.250> my<00:00:44.370> weight<00:00:44.520> around<00:00:44.550> 260

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
offseason I keep my weight around 260

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.900 
offseason I keep my weight around 260
270<00:00:45.930> and<00:00:46.620> come<00:00:47.100> down<00:00:47.340> which<00:00:47.550> is<00:00:47.579> you<00:00:47.879> know

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
270 and come down which is you know

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.959 
270 and come down which is you know
probably<00:00:48.750> struggle<00:00:49.320> but<00:00:49.469> this<00:00:50.370> time<00:00:50.489> around<00:00:50.670> I

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
probably struggle but this time around I

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.270 
probably struggle but this time around I
said<00:00:51.180> you<00:00:51.270> know<00:00:51.390> what<00:00:51.510> I'm<00:00:51.719> gonna<00:00:51.840> say<00:00:51.930> Arlene

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
to 48 to 50 which I did so I said it'd

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.139 
to 48 to 50 which I did so I said it'd
be<00:00:56.070> a<00:00:56.129> lot<00:00:56.309> easier<00:00:56.520> if<00:00:56.820> we're<00:00:56.910> going<00:00:57.000> to<00:00:57.059> meet

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
be a lot easier if we're going to meet

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.200 
be a lot easier if we're going to meet
that<00:00:57.360> weight<00:00:57.780> division<00:00:58.289> and<00:00:59.059> it's<00:01:00.059> been

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
that weight division and it's been

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.990 
that weight division and it's been
extremely<00:01:00.420> chigney<00:01:01.170> difficult<00:01:01.680> but<00:01:02.609> you<00:01:02.879> know
