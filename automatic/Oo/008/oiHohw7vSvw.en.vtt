does mean a lot so day 0 we discussed it
a<00:00:43.079> little<00:00:43.379> bit<00:00:43.710> before<00:00:43.920> but<00:00:44.370> not<00:00:44.520> really<00:00:44.700> in

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
a little bit before but not really in

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.790 
a little bit before but not really in
depth<00:00:45.300> at<00:00:45.480> all<00:00:45.690> and<00:00:45.930> since<00:00:46.379> we<00:00:46.500> did<00:00:46.620> get<00:00:46.739> a

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
depth at all and since we did get a

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.229 
depth at all and since we did get a
little<00:00:46.920> bit<00:00:47.129> more<00:00:47.280> information<00:00:47.520> on<00:00:47.969> it

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
little bit more information on it

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.270 
little bit more information on it
recently<00:00:48.690> I<00:00:48.750> figured<00:00:49.079> why<00:00:49.350> not<00:00:49.379> let's<00:00:49.890> do<00:00:50.070> all

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
recently I figured why not let's do all

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.490 
recently I figured why not let's do all
of<00:00:50.309> this<00:00:50.700> in<00:00:50.940> one<00:00:51.000> giant<00:00:51.660> video<00:00:51.930> for<00:00:52.350> you<00:00:52.469> guys

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
of this in one giant video for you guys

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.619 
of this in one giant video for you guys
so<00:00:53.340> let's<00:00:53.640> just<00:00:53.820> start<00:00:54.030> from<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.239> beginning<00:00:54.329> I

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
so let's just start from the beginning I

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.660 
so let's just start from the beginning I
guess<00:00:54.809> what<00:00:55.110> is<00:00:55.260> day<00:00:55.559> zero<00:00:55.890> it's<00:00:56.160> a<00:00:56.489> promotion

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
guess what is day zero it's a promotion

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.400 
guess what is day zero it's a promotion
announced<00:00:57.480> from<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:57.719> multiplayer<00:00:58.260> reveal

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
which is what is now almost a month ago

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.630 
which is what is now almost a month ago
crazy<00:01:00.899> to<00:01:01.109> think<00:01:01.140> about<00:01:01.379> but<00:01:02.160> anyone<00:01:02.489> who

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
crazy to think about but anyone who

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.310 
crazy to think about but anyone who
pre-ordered<00:01:03.180> advanced<00:01:03.539> warfare<00:01:03.660> would<00:01:04.199> be

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
pre-ordered advanced warfare would be

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.289 
pre-ordered advanced warfare would be
eligible<00:01:04.500> to<00:01:04.830> pick<00:01:05.250> up<00:01:05.400> and<00:01:05.610> play<00:01:05.850> their<00:01:06.060> copy

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
eligible to pick up and play their copy

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.810 
eligible to pick up and play their copy
of<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.630> game<00:01:06.780> a<00:01:06.960> whole<00:01:07.290> day<00:01:07.590> early<00:01:08.130> than<00:01:08.580> those

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
of the game a whole day early than those

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.520 
of the game a whole day early than those
who<00:01:08.970> just<00:01:09.150> buy<00:01:09.330> it<00:01:09.390> on<00:01:09.600> launch<00:01:09.900> day<00:01:09.990> so<00:01:10.170> that's

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
who just buy it on launch day so that's

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.980 
who just buy it on launch day so that's
a<00:01:10.650> massive<00:01:11.010> pre-order<00:01:11.760> incentive<00:01:12.240> that<00:01:12.390> in<00:01:12.840> my

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
a massive pre-order incentive that in my

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.510 
a massive pre-order incentive that in my
mind<00:01:13.200> is<00:01:13.320> absolutely<00:01:13.830> brilliant<00:01:14.010> and<00:01:14.310> I<00:01:14.340> don't

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
mind is absolutely brilliant and I don't

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.090 
mind is absolutely brilliant and I don't
see<00:01:14.760> why<00:01:15.000> a<00:01:15.030> decade-old<00:01:15.810> series<00:01:16.439> is<00:01:16.590> just

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
see why a decade-old series is just

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.399 
see why a decade-old series is just
doing<00:01:17.220> that<00:01:17.400> now<00:01:17.610> honestly<00:01:17.850> so<00:01:18.270> day<00:01:18.810> 0<00:01:19.200> is

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
doing that now honestly so day 0 is

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.499 
doing that now honestly so day 0 is
specific<00:01:20.070> only<00:01:20.250> to<00:01:20.400> retailers<00:01:21.030> wherever<00:01:21.390> you
