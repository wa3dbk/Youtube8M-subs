00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.640
 Y 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:21.080
 ah 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:23.390
 I chose to play the Spanish guitar because 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.070
 it is an instrument that can always 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.869
 you can always have on hand always 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:28.320
 you can grab it and take it to a 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:31.410
 Park 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.930
 it's super cheap if there's something in it 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.989
 can clearly distinguish a good 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:41.420
 guitar of a bad or a mediocre is 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.420
 the type of wood that is used 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.460
 depending on the wood that you put like this 

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:47.620
 you are going to remove the sound is going to tell you 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.969
 one way from another regardless of 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.550
 the construction that does affect 

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:54.010
 also to the sound then the employment of 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:56.320
 that set of woods is what makes 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.710
 then every single guitar and all the 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.710
 guitars 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:08.210
 I've been building guitars since 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:12.740
 14 years I started with my father and my uncle 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.740
 I've been with my life for 40 years 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:18.380
 that was in the year 1972 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:21.880
 to my mother 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.880
 this bet of tucked 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:28.020
 a guitar made to scale as a 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.390
 normal guitar but in small that stops 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.400
 build guitars to start 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:34.050
 traditionally always 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.640
 to start the construction of the 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:38.190
 guitar the first thing to choose 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.650
 is the way the stage is vibrates a lot or 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:43.620
 it has to be that it has a lot that 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:46.500
 vibrate that has a lot of capacity 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:48.690
 of transmitting the sound the handle has 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:52.500
 to be in a way that is hard and that 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:54.240
 is put so that it does not take much weight the 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.610
 fingerboard is ebony which is the way 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.670
 harder than there is the heavier wood 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:02.430
 but it does not matter that it's heavy because its 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.230
 function is the subjection of the style of 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.990
 ropes 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:08.800
 the bottom streams may vary and may 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:12.140
 be of rosewood can be 10 and press 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:14.090
 it can be maple there's a lot of 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:17.170
 woods that can be used for 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.170
 hoops and the background of the guitar 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:24.810
 by varying the wood and the construction 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:27.270
 mariah the sound varies to the touch 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.330
 So that's the big difference 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:32.410
 a guitar 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:35.240
 these guitars vary from guitars 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:38.510
 that are made in the factory 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:40.870
 then sing at furniture level nothing 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:43.550
 more see it and at the same time it's another kind of 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:46.400
 work both inside and outside 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:49.190
 but above all, it is mainly 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:52.070
 sound of a factory guitar and 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:53.000
 make 20 blow guitars in a 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:55.220
 person 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.830
 the delivery detail than 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:00.280
 you have when you get two guitars 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:00.280
 it's the same 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:08.530
 well I start from very child at home 

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:11.530
 since my father was 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.530
 how 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:17.240
 until I got to make my own 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:21.500
 music 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:23.240
 and be a concert player and I also dedicate myself 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.720
 I have a flamenco editorial I have 

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:25.720
 my name 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:32.850
 apparently 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:34.920
 It may seem that this guitar is the same 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:38.180
 that a classical guitar is not the same 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.180
 difference in many things 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:46.360
 Guitar player pretends with a guitar 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:50.200
 flamenco and get a kind of sound 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:51.970
 brighter faster by the way of 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:55.540
 touch that we have that arrives 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:57.930
 very soon that it shoots out that has 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:02.440
 a special brightness and connotations 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:04.530
 that to work basic would not be worth 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:08.850
 all guitars are unique because 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:08.850
 none is the same 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:17.470
 yes I think it takes to catch the 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:22.950
 honey and a guitar because you spend 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:25.170
 hours and hours days months with twitter not 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:28.300
 and in the end you end up talking to her about 

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:31.409
 somehow do you communicate 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:31.409
 communicates with times 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:40.710
 I would like to have a luthier guitar 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:42.920
 but it will come when he learns to touch it 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:42.920
 all right 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:52.580
