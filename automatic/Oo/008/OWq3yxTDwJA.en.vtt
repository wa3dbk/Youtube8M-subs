00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.380
 Dear friends, welcome to 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:04.859
 a new one once in my video 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.450
 channel 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.370
 Today I want you a equipment 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.530
 Do not imagine it for those yet 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.809
 Do not know and the the martens video 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.690
 have seen a little here 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:18.930
 summary what the equipment 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.760
 blackhat can indeed sound is weird 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.590
 Somehow black hat is called 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.420
 translated 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:29.099
 but what can this thing do 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:30.869
 basically standard can with 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.239
 this part of enemy equipment 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.370
 so hedge claims c4 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.050
 everything you find bouncing betis 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.570
 Of course and then you have the 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.070
 possibility to do that now 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.629
 of course no one will place the claim like that 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:48.000
 like here in the video but mostly 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:50.250
 Of course, other things will grab you 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.899
 in addition the engineer one so that 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.430
 Plant engineer can you the equipment 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.129
 through walls and could see it that way 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.510
 better hedge and in the next clip 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.010
 I would like to show you what this 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.770
 everything goes if you can 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.719
 Opponent calls a care package and you 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.189
 are near or even do not have to 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.750
 be near me then show later 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.240
 what else this part for a distance 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:12.810
 has thrown off the cape 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:16.290
 we would have heard the thing 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.790
 we can not do the part of the part though 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.710
 can be captured so-called 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.960
 defuse but it does not help because 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:25.590
 we dusted off the part correctly 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.780
 really fat yes the next 27 sunny 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.210
 let's see what exactly happens when 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.520
 you have a so-called care package fail 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.140
 you will see me 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.750
 Colleague of the flea throws my care 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.210
 package on the roof of this great 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.500
 Of course this happens in the boat 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.360
 hectic ever that somehow 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:46.259
 throws the thing then lands on the 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.610
 roof even then no problem for that 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.979
 black you can have your care package 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.290
 record and that is of course really 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.920
 easy going you have no problems then 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.659
 more 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.880
 Care package to pick just like that 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.189
 the ultra much you do it throws it 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.869
 really complete on the thing on top 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:04.740
 Do not give them the care package anymore 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:06.840
 that now I have the thing for you 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.979
 call the kitsch completely on the 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.210
 thrown the boat 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.830
 so now you will see the following me 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:13.630
 So I've got it and I already have it 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:16.770
 already awesome so there are your fighters 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:18.880
 it never gets lost with the thing 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.590
 In the next clip I would like to go too 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.290
 show what it as a possibility 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:25.030
 There are enemy helicopters for example 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.710
 or july to destroy with the 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.960
 black one needs two black cats around 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:29.500
 for example the stealth helicopters too 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.240
 chop 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.590
 So that means he is not covered 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:34.480
 does not belong to you then only then 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.190
 broken clear one concedes the one or 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.470
 other but if you have the equipment 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.670
 it has and, for example, no rocket 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:43.270
 Of course, launcher is that 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:46.360
 practically there is already the stealth gone 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:49.330
 So really cool thing you have to completely 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.650
 Honestly speaking brings extreme advantage and 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:52.300
 Although a july like for example the 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.130
 can you really hack fix 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:55.840
 There are different graduation series 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.980
 which you can break faster and 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.360
 others not faster 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:01.090
 I'll give you the description 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:03.370
 packed how many blackhat you have, so to speak 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:06.820
 for a kill series or a specific one 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:09.790
 career needs this clip is a 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:11.980
 a little bit bad what of course the team 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.150
 behave when and if you are 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.410
 a team with a bit of you 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.300
 then you can do that 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:17.680
 Of course, with the black would have our 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.840
 if a team made of you in the body 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.670
 graded and told her to pay 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.340
 you did not deserve that belief 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:26.230
 I more then you can hack it 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.090
 of course a nasty bad way around 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:30.820
 heads are tj maxx to covers 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:34.090
 but I do not know if he likes it so much 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:35.680
 if yes in the next clips 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:38.320
 I would like to give you the range 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.210
 extreme range of this so-called blackhat 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:42.490
 Show the thing is really incredible 

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:45.730
 throw care package here in the 

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:47.680
 first clip on the map jet across 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:49.480
 the gang and it comes now also now 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.100
 in the world let's see how far the thing 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.050
 So you can go here now 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:54.730
 actually goes as far back as possible 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:56.410
 and the thing is taken immediately 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:59.020
 you also have no distance 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:00.280
 Delay or something else that is 

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:01.890
 already really cool we have it 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.120
 thought go to another map 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:07.510
 a bit more spacious we are 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:09.220
 here on turbine or terrain and would like 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:12.220
 Show you how crass that 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:13.750
 removal of this device is and as he 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:15.310
 In any case, the theme reindeer 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:17.859
 could take to try to 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:19.870
 I'm really extremely far away 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:21.459
 So that's a huge distance from me 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:23.740
 do not even see the thing anymore 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:26.530
 and zack it taken as it is 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:29.080
 really something from krusty range what 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:31.750
 this part has and you can stop extremely 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:34.150
 For example, get a good care package 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:36.220
 even if you die you can still get up 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:37.630
 another range then his body 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:39.310
 it works because i often have the problem 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:41.340
 I had my care package called 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:43.810
 had to run then had to pick it up 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:46.599
 and that's in free fall, for example 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:47.800
 extremely shitty and that's why I have 

00:04:46.599 --> 00:04:49.810
 thought to take free now, for example 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:51.940
 for all times the blackpad with there can 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:53.259
 you get your body table without that 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:54.610
 an opponent can pick it up, for example 

00:04:53.259 --> 00:04:57.220
 You can also do the camp is easy 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:59.139
 wait until opponents come and 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:01.240
 then accordingly omitted to 

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:02.949
 the thing from a safe distance some 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:05.199
 that's really awesome again 

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:07.509
 range from this part 

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:09.070
 we tried the maximum out times 

00:05:07.509 --> 00:05:11.979
 to find that you can see in the last clip 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:14.710
 you can see that part really 

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:16.570
 on the back of the truck and me 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:19.150
 try to run away as far as possible 

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:21.580
 and that part anyway with the blackout 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:30.340
 to capture yes three times you guess 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:30.759
 what will happen so it can not be no 

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:32.710
 fun 

00:05:30.759 --> 00:05:34.870
 So I just have to go a little closer 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:37.360
 was and also aim at this part 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:39.400
 Apart from that, you really only have to 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:40.509
 I have to aim this thing correctly 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:41.919
 there lie a bit that the 

00:05:40.509 --> 00:05:43.210
 comeback in the visor does not have that 

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:45.580
 symbol but the care package and 

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:46.680
 already on this fat range 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:49.570
 occupied 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:51.130
 not bad Mr. Specht yes I hope 

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:52.840
 you liked the video if you like 

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:53.979
 the video is not yet seen with tomatoes 

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:55.659
 will be glad if you still 

00:05:53.979 --> 00:05:57.580
 a rating is there for the one or 

00:05:55.659 --> 00:05:58.780
 I did not know others yet 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:00.280
 thank you very much for seeing thank you 

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:04.229
 i wish a lot of fun for listening 

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:04.229
 and up to a servus
