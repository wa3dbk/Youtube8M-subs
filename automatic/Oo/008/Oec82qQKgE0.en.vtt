00:00:00.529 --> 00:00:02.760
 how to build the first Moscow station 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.569
 subway how fast moving 

00:00:04.569 --> 00:00:06.020
 train tunnels 

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:08.349
 and why do we need dial phones 

00:00:08.349 --> 00:00:10.740
 answers to these questions but you know if 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.289
 come to the folk museum 

00:00:12.289 --> 00:00:14.759
 history of the Moscow metro 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.240
 it is located in the south lobby 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:18.230
 sports station 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:19.840
 you don't even have to get there 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.640
 to go out she will only rise 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.970
 on the escalator the first place is a sign with 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:26.519
 inscription 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.310
 Our museum Moscow House photos of them 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.809
 in 1967 

00:00:31.809 --> 00:00:34.159
 he was open to the public for 

00:00:34.159 --> 00:00:35.900
 visitors 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:39.080
 with evil he created it was a serpent created but 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.790
 ideas 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:42.280
 veterans metro 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.740
 our on our trade union organization 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:45.790
 to the public 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:48.790
 we were the initiator of this museum 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:53.300
 but the woman general man was not 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:54.070
 deputy head 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:55.830
 subway 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:58.220
 here it is iraq itself 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.110
 together with the Moscow events 1000 dollars 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.110
 By the way that we will have our subway 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:06.980
 Here are collected unique exhibits 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:09.030
 among them are documents 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.650
 photos mock up escalators 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:13.580
 and the momentum will continue 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.040
 which used to be used in 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.080
 Moscow metro museum staff 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.190
 will definitely show you how it works 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:21.780
 traffic lights switch to 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.030
 the display shows the speed of movement 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.860
 virtual search me even watch 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.180
 show the exact time 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.380
 I always wanted to go to the present 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:31.530
 driver's cab 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.520
 Moscow Metro Museum my 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.520
 the dream is finally me and the power itself 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.310
 Now the market will become more modern 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:40.280
 equipment 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.110
 we expect it to be very 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:43.330
 not so easy 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:47.010
 in the Moscow metro opened in 1935 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:48.700
 But this could happen much 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:49.860
 earlier 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.110
 late nineteenth century Russian and 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.120
 foreign entrepreneurs 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.270
 began to offer various options 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.340
 construction of underground roads 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.880
 even detailed plans have been preserved but 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.320
 for many reasons, because of this project 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:03.630
 stage 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.790
 in the very first project about ckk off-street 

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:08.479
 Moscow transport system 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.959
 it's 1807 sleep and year 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:13.760
 at the turn of 19 thousand around May 19th of the twentieth 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.920
 centuries appears at once a 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.310
 projects and they were all rejected 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.319
 eyes city duma 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:21.249
 there were several reasons 

00:02:21.249 --> 00:02:22.579
 reasons first 

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:24.739
 and the project they arranged to the city by 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:26.639
 who as the threshold was supposed 

00:02:26.639 --> 00:02:27.709
 lay the lines 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:29.450
 in some cases did not solve urban 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.639
 problems and solved some other 

00:02:31.639 --> 00:02:34.379
 besides, all the projects are practically 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:36.399
 all of that time were rather weak 

00:02:36.399 --> 00:02:37.449
 worked out 

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:39.079
 and the developers could not give 

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:42.339
 certain answers to the necessary 

00:02:42.339 --> 00:02:44.029
 ru question that just some water 

00:02:44.029 --> 00:02:46.019
 panicked out of something like that 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:48.179
 the project will begin to be implemented 

00:02:48.179 --> 00:02:49.619
 0 but yesterday 

00:02:49.619 --> 00:02:52.319
 n one more reason it was not extremely 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:54.559
 favorable financial conditions implementation 

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:55.329
 the project 

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:57.180
 so the city rejected all these 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.049
 no projects developed your if 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:01.969
 this is not the first world war hope for 

00:03:01.969 --> 00:03:05.540
 people's feelings then in 1915 but at that time already 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.519
 it was not before 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:09.480
 The first builders of the Moscow metro cash 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:10.479
 end kerry 

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:12.469
 feet work they were forced to perform 

00:03:12.469 --> 00:03:13.529
 manually 

00:03:13.529 --> 00:03:15.479
 these are the tools r 

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:17.829
 very important step was learning first 

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:20.019
 subway machinists 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:21.680
 in the construction of any line 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.219
 subway always exists so 

00:03:23.219 --> 00:03:25.079
 called pre-launch period 

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:27.089
 This is the period when acceptance begins. 

00:03:27.089 --> 00:03:29.349
 operation will look at their systems 

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:31.190
 connect so on and so forth 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:32.830
 but now it happens in 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:34.729
 rather tight deadlines then 

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:37.829
 in 34 35 kg ha to 40 

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:40.130
 this work took more than six months 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:42.260
 Well, it became not logical why because everything 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:43.180
 was the first time 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:43.930
 had 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:45.510
 except just be fruitful 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.139
 make sure they are reliable 

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:49.460
 something can be even somewhere to correct 

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:52.160
 if not more than that 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.260
 train the staff to teach correctly 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.499
 to use 

00:03:56.499 --> 00:03:58.259
 such technical means which 

00:03:58.259 --> 00:04:00.189
 were in their 

00:04:00.189 --> 00:04:02.319
 actually get more 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:04.549
 machinist congress yes here's the first machinist 

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:06.400
 These are those who came from Moscow 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.319
 Yaroslavl railway or with 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:10.719
 Moscow tram but they retrained 

00:04:10.719 --> 00:04:11.619
 on subway cars 

00:04:11.619 --> 00:04:13.819
 dumps we mastered this technique 

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:16.200
 passed exams in the world 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.900
 and began a gradual rink 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:18.749
 the lines 

00:04:18.749 --> 00:04:20.109
 engineers who designed 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:22.339
 Moscow metro sent in Ukraine 

00:04:22.339 --> 00:04:25.169
 Czech Republic we carefully studied the work on 

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:26.810
 gold in london paris 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:28.720
 after a while the situation has changed 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.560
 now our specialists 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.720
 sent abroad to help their 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.800
 overseas Oleg Adam by the way in 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.280
 Russia has a room where gifts are collected 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.150
 from metro workers from our cities 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:40.490
 country 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:42.210
 state if 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:44.830
 they have not arranged the standings yet 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:45.749
 Slovakia 

00:04:45.749 --> 00:04:49.870
 in Poland and Hungary and in Bulgaria therefore 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:52.900
 tons per minute and we have one of the detainees 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:53.760
 show 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.150
 our security system they too 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:59.880
 weeks at home abroad but they influenced 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:00.659
 on the neck 

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:02.430
 movement of trains 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:04.430
 Moscow metro the fastest view 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:05.990
 metropolitan transport 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:07.800
 undoubted plus to the fact that there is not 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:08.999
 there are traffic jams 

00:05:08.999 --> 00:05:10.519
 Now train speed 

00:05:10.519 --> 00:05:13.259
 reach 80 kilometers per hour as well 

00:05:13.259 --> 00:05:15.189
 of course we can't always 

00:05:15.189 --> 00:05:17.580
 Our first trains are in Kuril 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:19.749
 the diocese is very worthy 

00:05:19.749 --> 00:05:21.080
 trains went 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.400
 with speed but about goes about 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:26.639
 34 people now goes by about 

00:05:27.509 --> 00:05:30.219
 began and very symantec speeds 

00:05:30.219 --> 00:05:31.860
 then it's all gradually 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:34.009
 increased from year to year and in speed 

00:05:34.009 --> 00:05:35.939
 increased by 

00:05:35.939 --> 00:05:38.289
 Then the resolution but increase the speed to 

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:40.239
 fifty kilometers an hour it's 

00:05:40.239 --> 00:05:43.649
 the embassy 

00:05:43.649 --> 00:05:45.449
 automatics telemechanics as they 

00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:46.239
 will provide security 

00:05:46.239 --> 00:05:48.210
 train movements because 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:50.100
 same thing that lock which 

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:51.430
 secured she 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:52.910
 well defined 

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:53.559
 speeds 

00:05:53.559 --> 00:05:56.569
 she had to but he for the first in 

00:05:56.569 --> 00:05:59.369
 police think something advise yanao 

00:05:59.369 --> 00:06:00.809
 constantly increase 

00:06:00.809 --> 00:06:02.439
 constantly increase we 

00:06:02.439 --> 00:06:04.809
 defended czech permanent increased 

00:06:04.809 --> 00:06:07.199
 block plot yes traffic lights for 

00:06:07.199 --> 00:06:09.419
 order to increase not only speed but 

00:06:09.419 --> 00:06:11.229
 and bandwidth 

00:06:11.229 --> 00:06:13.529
 separate part of the history of our region in 

00:06:13.529 --> 00:06:15.339
 interception 

00:06:15.339 --> 00:06:16.919
 Eliseev decided to devote a whole 

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:17.999
 shop window 

00:06:17.999 --> 00:06:20.669
 among the exhibits there are also tons of which 

00:06:20.669 --> 00:06:23.150
 allowed death and the metro 

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:25.350
 machines but certainly not lower but 

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:25.699
 as 

00:06:25.699 --> 00:06:27.919
 so this story 

00:06:27.919 --> 00:06:30.020
 Moscow metro turnstiles existed 

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:31.979
 not always at first by the controller manually 

00:06:31.979 --> 00:06:33.490
 had to check tickets at 

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:34.610
 passengers 

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:36.659
 and how this happened can be seen on 

00:06:36.659 --> 00:06:38.430
 books on craz 

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:40.250
 Moscow fare payment system 

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:42.870
 metro at all year along with it was 

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:44.150
 upgraded from 

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:46.119
 changed but mainly 

00:06:46.119 --> 00:06:47.860
 so let's say the criteria are one of them 

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:49.189
 in the main important 

00:06:49.189 --> 00:06:51.369
 criteria this convenience has always been 

00:06:51.369 --> 00:06:52.939
 it is a convenience for passengers 

00:06:52.939 --> 00:06:55.610
 that's exactly why back in 1935 

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:57.830
 abandoned the first experienced turnstile 

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:00.099
 here you can see we have an exposure token 

00:07:00.099 --> 00:07:03.069
 sdk is a loss of a 35 year token 

00:07:03.069 --> 00:07:05.039
 why because then in the world 

00:07:05.039 --> 00:07:06.729
 there was only one construction 

00:07:06.729 --> 00:07:08.909
 turnstile is a spinner 

00:07:08.909 --> 00:07:10.729
 what to eat with kamaz little bandwidth 

00:07:10.729 --> 00:07:13.099
 taydulu abilities to pass through and 

00:07:13.099 --> 00:07:15.479
 second rapid wear of mechanical parts 

00:07:15.479 --> 00:07:17.370
 since other reliably designs 

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:18.869
 no one in the world knew 

00:07:18.869 --> 00:07:19.939
 it was necessary from turnstiles 

00:07:19.939 --> 00:07:21.909
 refuse think control 

00:07:21.909 --> 00:07:24.499
 until the end of the fifties, the result is all 

00:07:24.499 --> 00:07:25.430
 ninth year 

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:28.050
 finally our engineers have ours 

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:29.699
 the inventors came up with the very 

00:07:29.699 --> 00:07:30.949
 turnstile design 

00:07:30.949 --> 00:07:32.500
 normal open normally open 

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:34.099
 the type in which it turned out to be so 

00:07:34.099 --> 00:07:35.800
 successfully existed 

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:37.710
 we naturally need to be improved but 

00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:39.520
 not fundamentally design 

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:41.599
 more than that now more than fifty years 

00:07:41.599 --> 00:07:42.819
 she exists 

00:07:42.819 --> 00:07:44.240
 and it allows passengers to pass 

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:46.439
 fast and convenient 

00:07:46.439 --> 00:07:48.289
 Moscow Metro Museum originally 

00:07:48.289 --> 00:07:48.789
 called 

00:07:48.789 --> 00:07:50.639
 publicly interested in 

00:07:50.639 --> 00:07:51.909
 pro bono 

00:07:51.909 --> 00:07:54.639
 schoolchildren often come on excursions 

00:07:54.639 --> 00:07:56.879
 it is likely that someone was here 

00:07:56.879 --> 00:07:59.069
 of the future guys will want to work in 

00:07:59.069 --> 00:07:59.999
 Moscow metro
