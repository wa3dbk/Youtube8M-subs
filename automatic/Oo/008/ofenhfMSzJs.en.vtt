always<00:01:08.110> work<00:01:08.380> the<00:01:08.560> same<00:01:08.799> way

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:09.460 
always work the same way

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.030 
always work the same way
dividing<00:01:10.090> everything<00:01:10.659> into<00:01:11.079> parts<00:01:11.469> so<00:01:11.920> the

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:12.040 
dividing everything into parts so the

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.160 
dividing everything into parts so the

into twelve parts for a nine and a
quarter<00:01:19.780> inch<00:01:20.109> column<00:01:20.530> that<00:01:20.679> means<00:01:20.950> each<00:01:21.130> part

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:21.549 
quarter inch column that means each part

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:23.989 
quarter inch column that means each part
measures<00:01:21.999> about<00:01:22.149> three<00:01:22.630> quarters<00:01:23.020> of<00:01:23.049> an<00:01:23.259> inch

00:01:23.989 --> 00:01:23.999 
measures about three quarters of an inch

00:01:23.999 --> 00:01:26.879 
measures about three quarters of an inch
next<00:01:24.999> pane<00:01:25.359> divides<00:01:25.810> one<00:01:26.139> of<00:01:26.289> those<00:01:26.439> three

00:01:26.879 --> 00:01:26.889 
next pane divides one of those three

00:01:26.889 --> 00:01:29.969 
next pane divides one of those three
quarter<00:01:27.310> inch<00:01:27.490> parts<00:01:27.939> into<00:01:28.509> five<00:01:28.810> parts<00:01:29.079> so

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:29.979 
quarter inch parts into five parts so

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:31.739 
quarter inch parts into five parts so
each<00:01:30.130> of<00:01:30.159> those<00:01:30.459> parts<00:01:30.939> is<00:01:31.090> about<00:01:31.329> an<00:01:31.479> eighth

00:01:31.739 --> 00:01:31.749 
each of those parts is about an eighth

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:33.660 
each of those parts is about an eighth
of<00:01:31.779> an<00:01:32.049> inch<00:01:32.170> yeah<00:01:32.679> it's<00:01:32.859> okay<00:01:33.189> to<00:01:33.249> do<00:01:33.429> a<00:01:33.459> little

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
of an inch yeah it's okay to do a little

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.819 
of an inch yeah it's okay to do a little
rounding<00:01:34.090> off<00:01:34.240> trust<00:01:34.719> me<00:01:34.899> you<00:01:35.409> won't<00:01:35.529> be<00:01:35.649> the

rounding off trust me you won't be the
first<00:01:36.039> carpenter<00:01:36.579> that's<00:01:36.789> done<00:01:36.999> it<00:01:37.119> now<00:01:37.990> we

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:38.049 
first carpenter that's done it now we

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:40.830 
first carpenter that's done it now we
can<00:01:38.469> start<00:01:38.709> sizing<00:01:39.039> some<00:01:39.429> moldings<00:01:39.939> let's

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
can start sizing some moldings let's

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.300 
can start sizing some moldings let's
start<00:01:41.079> at<00:01:41.139> the<00:01:41.229> bottom<00:01:41.409> with<00:01:41.740> the<00:01:41.770> baseboard

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.310

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.669 
start at the bottom with the baseboard
the<00:01:43.209> plinth<00:01:43.509> on<00:01:43.689> the<00:01:43.810> base<00:01:43.990> should<00:01:44.259> be<00:01:44.380> 30

00:01:44.669 --> 00:01:44.679 
the plinth on the base should be 30

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:47.010 
the plinth on the base should be 30
parts<00:01:45.099> the<00:01:45.700> Taurus<00:01:46.149> and<00:01:46.299> the<00:01:46.389> Scotia<00:01:46.689> should

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
parts the Taurus and the Scotia should

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.099 
parts the Taurus and the Scotia should
be<00:01:47.139> 13<00:01:47.590> parts<00:01:48.009> with<00:01:48.789> a<00:01:48.819> bench<00:01:49.179> parts<00:01:49.719> the<00:01:49.899> mass

00:01:50.099 --> 00:01:50.109 
be 13 parts with a bench parts the mass

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:51.690 
be 13 parts with a bench parts the mass
easy<00:01:50.499> even<00:01:51.159> I<00:01:51.249> can<00:01:51.429> do<00:01:51.549> it

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
easy even I can do it

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.730 
easy even I can do it
look<00:01:52.029> the<00:01:52.389> base<00:01:52.599> is<00:01:52.840> five<00:01:53.079> and<00:01:53.229> a<00:01:53.289> half<00:01:53.349> inches

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:53.740 
look the base is five and a half inches

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.539 
look the base is five and a half inches
tall<00:01:54.029> sounds<00:01:55.029> pretty<00:01:55.240> familiar<00:01:55.419> huh<00:01:56.340> let's<00:01:57.340> go

00:01:57.539 --> 00:01:57.549
