00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
the fluid so we're going to put a little

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.260 
the fluid so we're going to put a little
upturn<00:01:41.970> top<00:01:42.350> underneath<00:01:43.350> it<00:01:43.790> and<00:01:44.790> then<00:01:45.060> sit

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
that in there like so so you get a bit

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:53.030 
that in there like so so you get a bit

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:03.639 
it to 80 degrees now we just mix our

00:03:03.639 --> 00:03:08.159 
it to 80 degrees now we just mix our
vinegar<00:03:04.000> with<00:03:04.150> our<00:03:04.299> filtered<00:03:04.689> water<00:03:04.870> and<00:03:07.169> we

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
just gently stir that into our tofu this

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.449 
just gently stir that into our tofu this
will<00:03:16.359> start<00:03:16.569> to<00:03:16.659> coagulate<00:03:17.500> and<00:03:17.739> we're<00:03:18.220> going

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459 
will start to coagulate and we're going

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:20.969 
will start to coagulate and we're going
to<00:03:18.549> then<00:03:18.849> strain<00:03:19.689> it<00:03:19.870> you<00:03:19.989> don't<00:03:20.229> want<00:03:20.439> to<00:03:20.680> whiz

00:03:20.969 --> 00:03:20.979 
to then strain it you don't want to whiz

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:22.469 
to then strain it you don't want to whiz
this<00:03:21.009> up<00:03:21.459> because<00:03:21.639> it<00:03:21.939> will<00:03:22.030> break<00:03:22.269> up<00:03:22.449> the

00:03:22.469 --> 00:03:22.479 
this up because it will break up the

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:27.899 
this up because it will break up the
clods<00:03:22.900> and<00:03:23.079> it<00:03:23.169> won't<00:03:23.379> work<00:03:23.650> so<00:03:26.579> just<00:03:27.579> let<00:03:27.729> that

00:03:27.899 --> 00:03:27.909 
clods and it won't work so just let that

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:29.849 
clods and it won't work so just let that
rest<00:03:28.389> for<00:03:28.689> a<00:03:28.720> few<00:03:28.750> minutes<00:03:29.290> to<00:03:29.439> start<00:03:29.709> to

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:29.859 
rest for a few minutes to start to

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:32.249 
rest for a few minutes to start to
coagulate<00:03:30.489> and<00:03:30.729> then<00:03:31.449> we're<00:03:31.569> going<00:03:31.750> to<00:03:31.840> strain

00:03:32.249 --> 00:03:32.259 
coagulate and then we're going to strain

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:35.550 
coagulate and then we're going to strain
that<00:03:32.379> back<00:03:33.159> through<00:03:33.430> our<00:03:33.519> cheesecloth<00:03:34.560> calico
