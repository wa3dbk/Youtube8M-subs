00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:21.210
 what is trail running is not easy 

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:25.210
 cross country running is emotions 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:27.790
 the nature of the red cube you is when you 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:30.610
 you take the floor to a blue forest or park 

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:32.970
 snowy mountains or empty or maybe 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:32.970
 field 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:50.570
 yes it is more difficult than city running or running 

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:52.550
 more expensive but worth it it's not easy 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.030
 sport is simultaneously a union with 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.990
 by nature 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.990
 competition with him 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:05.990
 I and Dima always pulled closer to 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.390
 nature we started with sports 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:11.120
 orientations later got masters 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:15.110
 sport athletics in our love 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:17.240
 this mountains remember your delight 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.850
 when we first took part in 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:22.190
 mountain marathon such a run strongly 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:24.820
 different from urban or highway 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:28.160
 much more muscles work in it 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:29.930
 huge communication load more stringent 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:33.470
 equipment requirements 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:36.740
 the end of the race my whole body cracked bullets 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:39.380
 off scale and I ran and looked at the mountains 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:42.160
 such a run gives incomparable 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.160
 feelings of freedom 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:50.970
 when you run among such beauties it seems 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:53.520
 that this is the main purpose 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.200
 man now many want 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.390
 switch from city running to three 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.670
 out of five are engaged in trail training 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.850
 running and everyone has the same 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.470
 where should I begin 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.730
 about this we will tell our next 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.590
 video you will see 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:09.810
 what to start doing trail running a 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.710
 how to train to strengthen 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.780
 muscles and ligaments 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:14.790
 we will dwell on the technique of running 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.130
 on different surface features 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:20.600
 running uphill from the mountain and the general requirement 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.600
 Arrow ring clothes and shoes
