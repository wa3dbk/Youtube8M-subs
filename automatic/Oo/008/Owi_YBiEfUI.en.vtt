00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:08.010
 Forty years ago, hungry cattle razed an entire area of ​​the forest in Costa Rica. 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:13.000
 The same hills are now covered by trees and grasslands, 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.270
 It is a testimony to Costa Rica's commitment for decades 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:21.160
 Agriculture that protects the environment and reduces global warming. 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.500
 José Lyon Vargis runs his ranch for cattle bearing this commitment in mind. 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.180
 The walls are made of live teak trees. 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.820
 Forest ecosystems absorb carbon dioxide and protect the natural wildlife in situ. 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.280
 Water comes from springs that are naturally conserved. 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.350
 The nutrient-rich grass protects the soil from erosion and feeds its livestock. 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.330
 For Leon Vargas, farmers and other livestock breeders in Costa Rica, 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:52.250
 Climate-friendly practices are not only good for the planet, but also economically important. 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.000
 Yes we can see the economic benefits, 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.470
 But it also gives me a personal satisfaction that comes from my relationship to the environment. 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.350
 These workers are busy planting seedlings from seeds donated by farmers. 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.930
 When these little seedlings grow up they are sold back to the farms at a low cost. 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.030
 Trees are a vital part of Costa Rica's climate-friendly agricultural movement. 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.340
 The so-called living fences extend across fertile agricultural land. 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.800
 Growing trees are grown in rows and linked by barbed wire. 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:32.300
 It is sturdier and more cohesive than the wooden fence posts, and the roots supply the soil with nitrogen. 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.770
 Trees are also planted in the fields to provide shade for livestock and bushes. 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:47.990
 Julio Jimenez Hernández has more than a thousand cedar trees and other trees in his four-hectare and half-hectare ranch. 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:53.840
 Every 3 years, he gets $ 1.30 for each healthy and qualified tree 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.980
 Through a global program on carbon credits supported by the World Bank. 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
 In addition to cash payments, leaves and bark work on soil protection and nutrition, 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.850
 It does not have to buy too much fertilizer. 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:10.690
 But in a few years, trees will reach maturity after 14 years of growth, 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:17.770
 Hernandez will be allowed to sell the timber from which he will earn huge profits expected to reach about $ 50,000. 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:23.640
 It takes about four to five more years to be harvested, 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:32.640
 When you reach a certain point, the value of each tree will reach about $ 300 to $ 500. 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.740
 Trees are not the only way for farmers to reap the benefits. 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:41.760
 Twenty years ago, one of the owners of dairy farms, Carlos Gomez, spent part of his profits on grain and feed. 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.610
 Now he often feeds his cows with the grass he is harvesting from his land. 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.000
 He cultivates several varieties. 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:55.210
 They are specially grown to stabilize nitrogen in the soil and provide protein, fiber and energy. 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:59.000
 Gomez has also increased the amount of money he spends on feeding cows 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.450
 Which is achieved by breeding 17 cows, 3 calves and 6 goats. 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.000
 It also spends less on fertilizers as well 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.360
 Because it collects and grazes its cows in small areas of its 22-hectare farm, 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:15.070
 And move it to another new area every day, so there is enough time for the grass to grow and recover again. 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:23.330
 At this farm and in this community, many of us producers use environmentally sustainable practices 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:29.590
 Reduce our costs by using local resources. 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:34.830
 Everything here is designed to reduce the farm's carbon footprint and save money. 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:37.980
 The water comes from the spring inside his ranch. 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.500
 To ensure that the water supply is not dry, 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:45.590
 The owner of each farm and its neighbors allow natural forests to grow on either side of the waterway to protect the waterway. 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:51.630
 This has the added advantage of protecting birds and other wild animals, as well as addressing erosion and soil degradation. 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:58.730
 Even cow manure is used, collected in this hole, called a bioreactor. 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:03.600
 Where manure enters, and with the addition of water and over time, methane is formed. 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:08.020
 Gomez uses this fuel to run the equipment he needs to make cheese, 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:12.570
 And supplies a pipe to his home to provide fuel for cooking and heating water. 

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:14.670
 It is another type of savings and savings. 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:19.000
 Gomez says his neighbors believe in climate-friendly agriculture 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.430
 Because they are economically viable 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:26.430
 And because they are proud that Costa Rica is a role model in the world. 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:31.500
 He has seen climate change and knows that action must be taken. 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.890
 The weather has changed and is still changing. 

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:38.000
 It has had a strong impact on agriculture. 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.890
 Yes, there is a change. 

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:48.420
 Of course, the methods and methods used in Costa Rica will not work in every country. 

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:53.130
 Climate, soil conditions and water supply vary from place to place around the world. 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:58.000
 For example, these cows were raised in a particular research unit 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000
 So that the Costa Rican heat will endure and at the same time produce milk. 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.480
 But other countries could adopt Costa Rica's commitment to a climate-sensitive approach 

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:12.000
 In order to grow crops, raise livestock and conserve forests. 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.010
 It not only protects the planet, it also achieves good economic returns. 

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:19.730
 It can become a global trend, a way and a way of thinking. 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000
 Leon Vargas is committed to sustainable practices in his ranch 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.970
 He even uses guppies to clean the water in the aquarium that his cattle use. 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.000
 Yeah. I will continue to do so because of my convictions, not just for commercial reasons. 

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.980
 Not a peer of a few colons, increased or decreased. 

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:44.000
 I think it is the duty of all citizens to help preserve the environment 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:50.200
 And mitigation of the effects of global warming. 

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:57.000
 So in this tiny country at the crossroads of two worlds, the carbon footprint has been reduced. 

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
 At the lowest possible cost ... and maximum benefits. 

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000
 We have to be grateful for this land and to give it back.
