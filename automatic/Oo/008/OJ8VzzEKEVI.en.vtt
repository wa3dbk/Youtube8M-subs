00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:03.899 
all right today we're gonna look at the

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.600 
all right today we're gonna look at the
access<00:00:04.500> tech<00:00:04.879> ms3<00:00:05.879> surface<00:00:06.390> mount<00:00:06.569> light<00:00:07.610> got

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
access tech ms3 surface mount light got

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.129 
access tech ms3 surface mount light got
to<00:00:08.700> looking<00:00:08.910> around<00:00:08.970> some<00:00:09.480> of<00:00:09.570> our<00:00:09.690> videos<00:00:09.960> and

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
to looking around some of our videos and

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:11.299 
to looking around some of our videos and
realize<00:00:10.410> that<00:00:10.440> we<00:00:10.740> didn't<00:00:10.950> actually<00:00:11.010> have<00:00:11.190> a

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
realize that we didn't actually have a

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.140 
realize that we didn't actually have a
video<00:00:11.550> of<00:00:11.670> this<00:00:11.790> so<00:00:12.090> uh<00:00:12.380> so<00:00:13.380> let's<00:00:13.590> do<00:00:13.799> one<00:00:14.150> this

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
video of this so uh so let's do one this

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.810 
video of this so uh so let's do one this
is<00:00:15.360> the<00:00:15.509> light<00:00:16.279> that<00:00:17.279> we're<00:00:17.430> talking<00:00:17.580> about

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
is the light that we're talking about

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:24.790 
is the light that we're talking about
very<00:00:18.570> very<00:00:18.840> small<00:00:20.210> but<00:00:21.210> very<00:00:22.050> very<00:00:22.320> powerful

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:24.800 
very very small but very very powerful

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.330 
very very small but very very powerful
of<00:00:25.800> course<00:00:26.039> it's<00:00:26.250> encased<00:00:26.640> in<00:00:26.910> a<00:00:28.310> like<00:00:29.310> a

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
of course it's encased in a like a

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.130 
of course it's encased in a like a
powder-coated<00:00:29.789> aluminum<00:00:30.179> or<00:00:30.840> some<00:00:30.960> type<00:00:31.109> of

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
powder-coated aluminum or some type of

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.650 
powder-coated aluminum or some type of
metal<00:00:31.529> housing<00:00:31.969> so<00:00:32.969> it's<00:00:33.000> going<00:00:33.300> to<00:00:33.360> be<00:00:33.450> very

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
metal housing so it's going to be very

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:40.700 
metal housing so it's going to be very
very<00:00:33.809> durable<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:38.750> light<00:00:39.750> obviously<00:00:40.290> is<00:00:40.440> very

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
very durable the light obviously is very

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.930 
very durable the light obviously is very
well<00:00:41.100> protected<00:00:41.809> and<00:00:42.809> of<00:00:42.960> course<00:00:43.170> on<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.440> back

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:43.940 
well protected and of course on the back

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.910 
well protected and of course on the back
all<00:00:44.940> your<00:00:45.480> connections<00:00:45.809> where<00:00:46.289> your<00:00:46.410> wires<00:00:46.620> go

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
all your connections where your wires go

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:54.860 
all your connections where your wires go
in<00:00:47.129> that's<00:00:47.670> all<00:00:47.879> epoxy<00:00:48.360> coated<00:00:53.570> so<00:00:54.570> there's

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
in that's all epoxy coated so there's

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.270 
in that's all epoxy coated so there's
not<00:00:55.020> going<00:00:55.140> to<00:00:55.199> be<00:00:55.260> any<00:00:55.410> moisture<00:00:55.500> issues<00:00:56.070> or

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
not going to be any moisture issues or

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.650 
not going to be any moisture issues or
water<00:00:56.489> getting<00:00:56.820> in<00:00:56.969> or<00:00:57.210> anything<00:00:57.390> like<00:00:57.570> that

00:00:59.650 --> 00:00:59.660 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:01.639 

so<00:01:00.660> let<00:01:00.750> me<00:01:00.809> give<00:01:00.930> you<00:01:00.989> some<00:01:01.170> quick

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
so let me give you some quick

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.369 
so let me give you some quick
measurements<00:01:01.890> but<00:01:02.460> before<00:01:02.670> I<00:01:02.730> do<00:01:03.290> of<00:01:04.290> course

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
measurements but before I do of course

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.320 
measurements but before I do of course
what<00:01:04.769> you<00:01:04.799> have<00:01:05.100> if<00:01:05.790> you're<00:01:06.030> not<00:01:06.060> familiar

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
what you have if you're not familiar

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.469 
what you have if you're not familiar
with<00:01:06.570> this<00:01:06.750> light<00:01:07.130> what<00:01:08.130> you<00:01:08.250> have<00:01:08.460> are<00:01:08.820> three

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
with this light what you have are three

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.200 
with this light what you have are three
generation<00:01:10.200> three<00:01:10.560> LEDs<00:01:11.159> that<00:01:11.549> are<00:01:11.820> inside

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
generation three LEDs that are inside

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.120 
generation three LEDs that are inside
and<00:01:12.619> then<00:01:13.619> right<00:01:13.890> up<00:01:14.100> in<00:01:14.250> front<00:01:14.280> here<00:01:14.850> is<00:01:15.090> a

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
and then right up in front here is a

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.170 
and then right up in front here is a
like<00:01:17.130> a<00:01:17.159> fluted<00:01:17.640> lens<00:01:18.110> you<00:01:19.110> can<00:01:19.259> see<00:01:19.470> all<00:01:19.619> the

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:20.180 
like a fluted lens you can see all the

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.520 
like a fluted lens you can see all the
different<00:01:21.180> little<00:01:21.360> angled<00:01:21.780> pieces<00:01:22.020> inside

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
different little angled pieces inside

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.219 
different little angled pieces inside
there<00:01:22.799> and<00:01:22.950> and<00:01:23.630> basically<00:01:24.630> what<00:01:24.869> that<00:01:25.020> does

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
there and and basically what that does

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.830 
there and and basically what that does
is<00:01:25.439> that<00:01:25.470> that<00:01:25.920> allows<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.490> LEDs<00:01:27.150> inside<00:01:27.630> to

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
is that that allows the LEDs inside to

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.230 
is that that allows the LEDs inside to
be<00:01:27.960> amplified<00:01:28.320> and<00:01:28.860> it<00:01:29.460> kind<00:01:29.670> of<00:01:29.700> disperses

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
be amplified and it kind of disperses

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.499 
be amplified and it kind of disperses
them<00:01:30.360> out<00:01:30.540> in<00:01:30.689> all<00:01:30.990> different<00:01:31.140> directions<00:01:31.799> so

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:32.509 
them out in all different directions so

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:35.539 
them out in all different directions so
this<00:01:33.509> is<00:01:33.630> a<00:01:33.659> very<00:01:34.110> popular<00:01:34.350> configuration<00:01:34.890> and

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
this is a very popular configuration and

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.960 
this is a very popular configuration and
this<00:01:36.150> particular<00:01:36.689> LED<00:01:37.250> only<00:01:38.250> has<00:01:38.400> three<00:01:38.640> LEDs

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
this particular LED only has three LEDs

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.880 
this particular LED only has three LEDs
in<00:01:39.150> it<00:01:39.240> this<00:01:39.750> particular<00:01:40.229> light<00:01:40.470> actually

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
in it this particular light actually

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.649 
in it this particular light actually
only<00:01:41.009> has<00:01:41.189> three<00:01:41.369> LEDs<00:01:41.520> in<00:01:41.850> it<00:01:41.880> of<00:01:42.210> course<00:01:42.450> it's

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
only has three LEDs in it of course it's

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.990 
only has three LEDs in it of course it's
it's<00:01:42.810> big<00:01:43.049> brother<00:01:43.290> is<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.619> MS<00:01:43.860> six<00:01:44.159> which

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
it's big brother is the MS six which

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.880 
it's big brother is the MS six which
obviously<00:01:45.600> has<00:01:45.869> six<00:01:46.140> LEDs<00:01:46.470> on<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.619> same

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
obviously has six LEDs on the same

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.219 
obviously has six LEDs on the same
configuration<00:01:47.640> same<00:01:48.329> Heights<00:01:48.659> and<00:01:49.020> width

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
configuration same Heights and width

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.359 
configuration same Heights and width
there<00:01:49.649> same<00:01:50.310> height<00:01:51.180> and<00:01:51.710> depth<00:01:52.710> but

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
there same height and depth but

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:54.980 
there same height and depth but
obviously<00:01:54.119> the<00:01:54.240> length<00:01:54.390> is<00:01:54.600> a<00:01:54.630> little<00:01:54.899> bit

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
obviously the length is a little bit

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:00.649 
obviously the length is a little bit
different<00:01:58.490> so<00:01:59.490> some<00:01:59.520> quick<00:01:59.850> measurements<00:02:00.119> for

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
different so some quick measurements for

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.630 
different so some quick measurements for
you

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.280 

so<00:02:05.640> from<00:02:05.820> top<00:02:06.000> to<00:02:06.060> bottom<00:02:06.210> you're<00:02:06.900> basically

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
so from top to bottom you're basically

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:13.510 
so from top to bottom you're basically
an<00:02:07.440> inch<00:02:10.070> then<00:02:11.070> in<00:02:11.280> width<00:02:11.870> you're<00:02:12.870> slightly

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
an inch then in width you're slightly

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:20.930 
an inch then in width you're slightly
over<00:02:14.520> half<00:02:14.550> an<00:02:14.910> inch<00:02:17.540> and<00:02:18.540> then<00:02:19.190> in<00:02:20.190> length<00:02:20.490> I

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
over half an inch and then in length I

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.000 
over half an inch and then in length I
think<00:02:21.180> we're<00:02:21.300> gonna<00:02:21.390> be<00:02:21.480> around<00:02:21.900> three<00:02:22.620> ish

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:30.950 

yeah<00:02:26.010> almost<00:02:26.550> three<00:02:27.000> and<00:02:27.030> a<00:02:27.150> half<00:02:29.750> so<00:02:30.750> in<00:02:30.900> a

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:30.960 
yeah almost three and a half so in a

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.040 
yeah almost three and a half so in a
light<00:02:31.110> that's<00:02:31.320> less<00:02:31.560> than<00:02:31.590> three<00:02:32.040> inches<00:02:32.220> long

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
light that's less than three inches long

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:39.380 
light that's less than three inches long
and<00:02:35.930> only<00:02:36.930> an<00:02:37.020> inch<00:02:37.170> tall<00:02:37.700> it's<00:02:38.700> it's<00:02:39.030> it's<00:02:39.300> a

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
and only an inch tall it's it's it's a

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.990 
and only an inch tall it's it's it's a
very<00:02:39.420> very<00:02:39.660> small<00:02:40.110> light<00:02:40.460> of<00:02:41.460> course<00:02:41.730> in<00:02:41.910> the

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
very very small light of course in the

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.430 
very very small light of course in the
package<00:02:42.360> what<00:02:42.510> you<00:02:42.600> get<00:02:42.780> is<00:02:42.900> a<00:02:42.930> little<00:02:43.200> set<00:02:43.410> of

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
package what you get is a little set of

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.160 
package what you get is a little set of
instructions<00:02:44.070> on<00:02:44.250> this<00:02:44.370> light<00:02:44.610> is<00:02:44.910> it<00:02:45.780> does

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
instructions on this light is it does

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.560 
instructions on this light is it does
have<00:02:46.350> 11<00:02:46.740> different<00:02:46.890> flash<00:02:47.250> patterns<00:02:47.640> they're

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
have 11 different flash patterns they're

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.390 
have 11 different flash patterns they're
all<00:02:48.720> built-in<00:02:49.110> and<00:02:49.350> the<00:02:49.890> only<00:02:50.040> thing<00:02:50.280> the

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
all built-in and the only thing the

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.610 
all built-in and the only thing the
light<00:02:50.550> actually<00:02:50.730> needs<00:02:51.180> is<00:02:51.480> just<00:02:52.410> simply

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
light actually needs is just simply

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.230 
light actually needs is just simply
power<00:02:52.890> and<00:02:53.070> ground<00:02:53.220> this<00:02:53.550> is<00:02:53.610> a<00:02:53.730> 12<00:02:54.030> volt

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:54.240 
power and ground this is a 12 volt

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.660 
power and ground this is a 12 volt
operation<00:02:54.750> and<00:02:55.010> you<00:02:56.010> just<00:02:56.130> need<00:02:56.310> to<00:02:56.370> hook<00:02:56.490> up

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
operation and you just need to hook up

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.840 
operation and you just need to hook up
your<00:02:56.850> your<00:02:57.420> power<00:02:57.660> and<00:02:57.810> ground<00:02:57.990> wires<00:02:58.260> and

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850 
your your power and ground wires and

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:01.550 
your your power and ground wires and
then<00:02:59.850> the<00:02:59.940> third<00:03:00.180> wire<00:03:00.390> is<00:03:00.660> a<00:03:00.780> flash<00:03:01.170> pattern

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
then the third wire is a flash pattern

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.340 
then the third wire is a flash pattern
changer<00:03:01.920> wire<00:03:02.130> and<00:03:02.430> also<00:03:02.670> a<00:03:02.820> sync<00:03:03.150> wire<00:03:03.360> so<00:03:04.170> if

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
changer wire and also a sync wire so if

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.530 
changer wire and also a sync wire so if
you<00:03:04.440> have<00:03:04.620> multiple<00:03:05.040> light<00:03:05.250> heads<00:03:05.460> that<00:03:05.730> you

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
you have multiple light heads that you

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.150 
you have multiple light heads that you
know<00:03:06.630> like<00:03:06.810> this<00:03:07.050> that<00:03:07.680> you<00:03:07.830> want<00:03:07.980> to

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
know like this that you want to

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.310 
know like this that you want to
alternate<00:03:08.670> or<00:03:09.000> you<00:03:09.180> know<00:03:09.300> flash<00:03:09.630> in<00:03:09.840> sequence

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320 
alternate or you know flash in sequence

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.010 
alternate or you know flash in sequence
you<00:03:10.620> would<00:03:11.220> set<00:03:11.490> each<00:03:11.670> light<00:03:11.970> head<00:03:12.180> on<00:03:12.510> its<00:03:12.840> own

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:13.020 
you would set each light head on its own

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:15.080 
you would set each light head on its own
individual<00:03:13.500> flash<00:03:13.740> pattern<00:03:14.160> and<00:03:14.340> then<00:03:14.910> just

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
individual flash pattern and then just

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.210 
individual flash pattern and then just
connect<00:03:15.390> your<00:03:15.450> yellow<00:03:15.840> wires<00:03:16.140> of<00:03:16.590> each<00:03:17.040> light

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
connect your yellow wires of each light

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.710 
connect your yellow wires of each light
to<00:03:20.220> each<00:03:20.370> other<00:03:20.550> just<00:03:20.790> connect<00:03:21.570> the<00:03:21.630> yellow

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
to each other just connect the yellow

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:27.290 
to each other just connect the yellow
wires<00:03:21.989> together

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.300 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.770 

so<00:03:27.900> 11<00:03:28.230> different<00:03:28.350> flash<00:03:28.680> patterns<00:03:29.780> all

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
so 11 different flash patterns all

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:37.490 
so 11 different flash patterns all
generation<00:03:31.500> 3<00:03:31.970> LEDs<00:03:32.970> inside<00:03:36.080> this<00:03:37.080> light<00:03:37.350> is

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
generation 3 LEDs inside this light is

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.220 
generation 3 LEDs inside this light is
going<00:03:37.620> to<00:03:37.710> pull<00:03:38.240> just<00:03:39.240> under<00:03:39.570> a<00:03:39.600> third<00:03:39.960> of<00:03:40.140> an

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
going to pull just under a third of an

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.560 
going to pull just under a third of an
amp<00:03:40.380> I<00:03:40.560> think<00:03:40.800> they're<00:03:41.010> I<00:03:41.490> think<00:03:42.450> they're

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:42.570 
amp I think they're I think they're

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:45.860 
amp I think they're I think they're
written<00:03:42.720> into<00:03:42.930> like<00:03:43.080> point<00:03:43.380> 2<00:03:43.620> amps<00:03:44.870> so

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
written into like point 2 amps so

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.630 
written into like point 2 amps so
obviously<00:03:46.680> doesn't<00:03:46.980> pull<00:03:47.100> very<00:03:47.220> much<00:03:47.430> juice

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
obviously doesn't pull very much juice

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:48.940 
obviously doesn't pull very much juice
at<00:03:47.820> all

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 
at all

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:52.220 
at all
of<00:03:49.950> course<00:03:50.190> these<00:03:50.340> LEDs<00:03:50.940> are<00:03:50.970> the<00:03:51.900> way<00:03:51.990> to<00:03:52.020> go

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
of course these LEDs are the way to go

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.680 
of course these LEDs are the way to go
everybody's<00:03:52.770> going<00:03:53.010> to<00:03:53.130> them<00:03:53.310> and<00:03:53.940> have<00:03:54.480> been

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:13.800 
with the with the light and I didn't

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:15.590 
with the with the light and I didn't
punch<00:04:14.010> them<00:04:14.190> out<00:04:14.250> but<00:04:14.490> there's<00:04:14.640> little<00:04:14.850> holes

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
let's go ahead and fire it up here now

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:33.160 
let's go ahead and fire it up here now
when<00:04:31.290> I<00:04:31.320> turn<00:04:31.410> it<00:04:31.620> on<00:04:31.710> the<00:04:31.950> light<00:04:32.130> is<00:04:32.340> gonna<00:04:32.640> be

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:33.170 
when I turn it on the light is gonna be

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:37.720 
when I turn it on the light is gonna be
it's<00:04:34.170> actually<00:04:34.470> gonna<00:04:34.590> be<00:04:34.740> set<00:04:34.950> to<00:04:35.100> random

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:37.730 

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:43.360 

which<00:04:38.730> is<00:04:39.000> a<00:04:39.050> the<00:04:40.050> very<00:04:40.350> first<00:04:41.660> flash<00:04:42.660> pattern

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:43.370 
which is a the very first flash pattern

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:47.150 
which is a the very first flash pattern
usually<00:04:44.720> default<00:04:45.740> setting<00:04:46.740> from<00:04:47.100> the

usually default setting from the

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.210 
usually default setting from the
manufacturer<00:04:48.230> it's<00:04:49.230> usually<00:04:49.440> on<00:04:49.770> random<00:04:50.130> when

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220 
manufacturer it's usually on random when

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:52.490 
manufacturer it's usually on random when
you<00:04:50.310> take<00:04:50.460> them<00:04:50.580> out<00:04:50.670> of<00:04:50.700> the<00:04:50.820> box<00:04:51.030> but<00:04:51.990> not

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:52.500 
you take them out of the box but not
