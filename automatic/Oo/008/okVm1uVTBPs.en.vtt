put<00:03:32.800> a<00:03:32.830> little<00:03:32.950> chip<00:03:33.130> on<00:03:33.220> our<00:03:33.280> shoulder<00:03:33.400> we

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
put a little chip on our shoulder we

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:35.340

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:37.710 
knew we were ready but we're very
resilient<00:03:35.680> tonight<00:03:36.070> I<00:03:36.100> thought<00:03:36.480> when<00:03:37.480> we<00:03:37.510> did

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
resilient tonight I thought when we did

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.150 
resilient tonight I thought when we did
take<00:03:37.900> a<00:03:37.930> shot<00:03:38.170> we<00:03:38.380> can<00:03:38.470> just<00:03:38.890> drive<00:03:39.010> it<00:03:39.070> right

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160 
take a shot we can just drive it right

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:40.410 
take a shot we can just drive it right
back<00:03:39.340> down<00:03:39.400> the<00:03:39.610> field<00:03:39.730> we<00:03:39.880> get<00:03:40.000> a<00:03:40.030> field<00:03:40.270> goal

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
back down the field we get a field goal

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.390 
back down the field we get a field goal
or<00:03:40.630> touchdown<00:03:40.660> so<00:03:41.320> it's<00:03:41.980> good<00:03:42.160> to<00:03:42.220> see<00:03:42.310> on

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
or touchdown so it's good to see on

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.530 
or touchdown so it's good to see on
offense<00:03:42.730> and<00:03:42.820> defense<00:03:43.240> they<00:03:43.330> were<00:03:43.420> they

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540 
offense and defense they were they

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.860
