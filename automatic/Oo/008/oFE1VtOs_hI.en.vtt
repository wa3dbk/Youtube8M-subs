mark<00:02:02.490> 5<00:02:02.729> I<00:02:03.110> better<00:02:04.110> close<00:02:04.260> my<00:02:04.409> door<00:02:04.590> because<00:02:04.680> I

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:04.830 
mark 5 I better close my door because I

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:12.290 
mark 5 I better close my door because I
get<00:02:05.010> clipped<00:02:10.820> so<00:02:11.820> that's<00:02:11.970> what<00:02:12.060> they<00:02:12.150> look

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
get clipped so that's what they look

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.979 
get clipped so that's what they look
like<00:02:12.330> what<00:02:12.600> they're<00:02:12.720> off

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:21.420 

Wow<00:02:18.330> this<00:02:19.330> section<00:02:19.780> here<00:02:20.110> did<00:02:20.620> not<00:02:20.650> come<00:02:21.040> on<00:02:21.280> I

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
Wow this section here did not come on I

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.670 
Wow this section here did not come on I
had<00:02:21.700> it<00:02:21.849> originally<00:02:22.030> coded<00:02:22.599> and<00:02:23.260> it<00:02:23.379> was<00:02:23.500> just

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
had it originally coded and it was just

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.589 
had it originally coded and it was just
coded<00:02:24.069> like<00:02:24.190> a<00:02:24.220> Volkswagen<00:02:24.489> from<00:02:25.060> Europe<00:02:25.390> so

00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:25.599 
coded like a Volkswagen from Europe so

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:28.740 
coded like a Volkswagen from Europe so
only<00:02:26.140> my<00:02:26.409> red<00:02:26.650> would<00:02:26.890> work<00:02:27.069> so<00:02:27.849> I<00:02:28.150> wasn't<00:02:28.510> happy

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
only my red would work so I wasn't happy

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.030 
only my red would work so I wasn't happy
with<00:02:28.840> that<00:02:28.989> because<00:02:29.170> this<00:02:29.440> whole<00:02:29.620> center

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
with that because this whole center

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.860 
with that because this whole center
section<00:02:30.370> is<00:02:30.459> amber<00:02:30.909> and<00:02:31.090> that's<00:02:31.569> where<00:02:31.780> the

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
section is amber and that's where the

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.930 
section is amber and that's where the
most<00:02:32.019> LEDs<00:02:32.680> are<00:02:32.890> there's<00:02:33.099> 20<00:02:33.459> if<00:02:33.579> you<00:02:33.610> count

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
most LEDs are there's 20 if you count

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.809 
most LEDs are there's 20 if you count
them<00:02:34.060> is<00:02:34.569> 1<00:02:34.810> 2<00:02:34.989> 3<00:02:35.019> 4<00:02:35.260> 5<00:02:35.680> and<00:02:36.040> there's<00:02:36.220> 4<00:02:36.400> rows<00:02:36.610> is

00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:36.819 
them is 1 2 3 4 5 and there's 4 rows is

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:41.309 
them is 1 2 3 4 5 and there's 4 rows is
5<00:02:37.060> 10<00:02:37.480> 15<00:02:38.110> 20<00:02:38.560> and<00:02:38.739> over<00:02:39.370> here<00:02:39.519> there's<00:02:39.700> 16<00:02:40.319> okay

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319 
5 10 15 20 and over here there's 16 okay

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:44.610 
5 10 15 20 and over here there's 16 okay
because<00:02:42.099> it's<00:02:42.310> something<00:02:42.519> like<00:02:42.640> 1<00:02:42.849> 2<00:02:43.030> 3<00:02:43.060> 4<00:02:43.780> 5<00:02:44.019> 4

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
because it's something like 1 2 3 4 5 4

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:49.410 
because it's something like 1 2 3 4 5 4
4<00:02:45.250> &amp;<00:02:45.579> 3<00:02:45.819> so<00:02:46.620> altogether<00:02:47.620> there's<00:02:47.890> 36<00:02:48.340> LEDs<00:02:48.879> now

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
4 &amp; 3 so altogether there's 36 LEDs now

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.900 
4 &amp; 3 so altogether there's 36 LEDs now
this<00:02:49.660> unusual<00:02:50.290> specimen<00:02:50.829> is<00:02:50.980> the<00:02:51.340> rear

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
this unusual specimen is the rear

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.089 
this unusual specimen is the rear
integrated<00:02:52.599> fog<00:02:52.810> light<00:02:53.079> that<00:02:53.590> you<00:02:53.739> only<00:02:53.859> get

00:02:54.089 --> 00:02:54.099 
integrated fog light that you only get

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:55.949 
integrated fog light that you only get
in<00:02:54.220> Europe<00:02:54.519> and<00:02:55.090> what<00:02:55.239> that<00:02:55.420> is<00:02:55.569> is<00:02:55.750> if<00:02:55.840> you're

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
in Europe and what that is is if you're

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:58.349 
in Europe and what that is is if you're
on<00:02:56.049> a<00:02:56.109> very<00:02:56.400> thick<00:02:57.400> fog<00:02:57.730> bank<00:02:58.060> and<00:02:58.269> you're

00:02:58.349 --> 00:02:58.359 
on a very thick fog bank and you're

00:02:58.359 --> 00:02:59.970 
on a very thick fog bank and you're
driving<00:02:58.750> through<00:02:58.930> it<00:02:59.109> or<00:02:59.500> even<00:02:59.709> the<00:02:59.799> bad

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
driving through it or even the bad

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.309 
driving through it or even the bad
rainstorm<00:03:00.730> this<00:03:01.450> will<00:03:01.659> help<00:03:01.780> people<00:03:01.900> to<00:03:02.079> see

00:03:02.309 --> 00:03:02.319 
rainstorm this will help people to see

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:02.640 
rainstorm this will help people to see
you

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
you

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.140 
you
so<00:03:02.799> that<00:03:02.980> up<00:03:03.069> ahead<00:03:03.370> will<00:03:03.549> sell<00:03:03.700> there's<00:03:03.909> a<00:03:03.940> car

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
so that up ahead will sell there's a car

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:05.940 
so that up ahead will sell there's a car
up<00:03:04.269> there<00:03:04.450> there's<00:03:04.690> something<00:03:04.900> up<00:03:05.140> there<00:03:05.170> this

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
up there there's something up there this

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:07.860 
up there there's something up there this
is<00:03:06.099> like<00:03:06.220> a<00:03:06.280> beacon<00:03:06.670> and<00:03:06.849> it<00:03:07.150> turns<00:03:07.359> on<00:03:07.569> when<00:03:07.840> I

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
is like a beacon and it turns on when I

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:09.210 
is like a beacon and it turns on when I
want<00:03:08.109> it<00:03:08.140> to<00:03:08.290> when<00:03:08.409> I<00:03:08.470> turn<00:03:08.680> when<00:03:08.829> I<00:03:08.859> pulled<00:03:09.129> it

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
want it to when I turn when I pulled it

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:10.970 
want it to when I turn when I pulled it
out<00:03:09.280> that<00:03:09.489> second<00:03:09.819> time<00:03:09.970> this<00:03:10.120> would<00:03:10.299> come<00:03:10.450> on

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
out that second time this would come on

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.930 
out that second time this would come on
and<00:03:11.980> this<00:03:12.159> is<00:03:12.220> what<00:03:12.430> the<00:03:12.549> other<00:03:12.640> side<00:03:12.760> looks

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
and this is what the other side looks

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.059 
and this is what the other side looks
like<00:03:13.209> now<00:03:13.450> I<00:03:13.690> only<00:03:13.930> have<00:03:14.079> one<00:03:14.230> reverse<00:03:14.829> light

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:15.069 
like now I only have one reverse light

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:16.649 
like now I only have one reverse light
so<00:03:15.280> this<00:03:15.400> now<00:03:15.609> is<00:03:15.790> the<00:03:15.819> only<00:03:16.120> reverse<00:03:16.390> light

00:03:16.649 --> 00:03:16.659 
so this now is the only reverse light

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:18.599 
so this now is the only reverse light
when<00:03:16.900> you<00:03:16.959> have<00:03:17.079> the<00:03:17.170> European<00:03:17.379> spec<00:03:17.859> and<00:03:18.459> like

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:18.609 
when you have the European spec and like

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:20.610 
when you have the European spec and like
I<00:03:18.760> said<00:03:19.000> to<00:03:19.359> get<00:03:19.510> this<00:03:19.690> to<00:03:19.870> work<00:03:19.900> right<00:03:20.319> you

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
I said to get this to work right you

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.849 
I said to get this to work right you
have<00:03:20.739> to<00:03:20.829> do<00:03:21.209> bag<00:03:22.209> comm<00:03:22.739> reprogramming<00:03:23.739> you

sense of it and believe me we had to

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.150 
sense of it and believe me we had to
recode<00:03:37.450> it<00:03:37.660> because<00:03:37.989> remember<00:03:38.410> the<00:03:38.680> amber

nother<00:03:40.959> thing<00:03:41.200> we<00:03:41.290> had<00:03:41.410> to<00:03:41.440> do<00:03:41.590> we<00:03:41.709> had<00:03:41.739> to<00:03:41.889> add

00:03:42.119 --> 00:03:42.129 
nother thing we had to do we had to add

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:44.909 
nother thing we had to do we had to add
an<00:03:42.489> extra<00:03:43.419> wire<00:03:43.750> so<00:03:44.440> you<00:03:44.530> need<00:03:44.650> to<00:03:44.739> get<00:03:44.829> an

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:44.919 
an extra wire so you need to get an

00:03:44.919 --> 00:03:46.830 
an extra wire so you need to get an
extra<00:03:45.250> wire<00:03:45.459> because<00:03:46.030> in<00:03:46.150> America<00:03:46.660> the<00:03:46.810> only

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
extra wire because in America the only

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.500 
extra wire because in America the only
have<00:03:47.049> three<00:03:47.319> wires<00:03:47.530> and<00:03:47.980> in<00:03:48.940> Europe<00:03:49.269> they<00:03:49.389> have

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
have three wires and in Europe they have

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:51.930 
have three wires and in Europe they have
four<00:03:49.780> she's<00:03:50.349> gonna<00:03:50.470> get<00:03:50.620> a<00:03:50.680> wire<00:03:50.919> for<00:03:51.160> this<00:03:51.280> and

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
four she's gonna get a wire for this and

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.229 
four she's gonna get a wire for this and
a<00:03:52.030> wire<00:03:52.269> for<00:03:52.629> that<00:03:53.160> and<00:03:54.160> I<00:03:54.250> think<00:03:54.519> another<00:03:54.940> wire

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:55.239 
a wire for that and I think another wire

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:57.569 
a wire for that and I think another wire
for<00:03:55.510> the<00:03:55.599> front<00:03:55.870> to<00:03:55.989> go<00:03:56.109> to<00:03:56.169> your<00:03:56.349> ECU<00:03:56.680> and<00:03:57.040> then

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:57.579 
for the front to go to your ECU and then

00:03:57.579 --> 00:03:58.830 
for the front to go to your ECU and then
you<00:03:57.669> put<00:03:57.849> it<00:03:57.910> all<00:03:58.030> on<00:03:58.120> the<00:03:58.180> wiring<00:03:58.510> harness<00:03:58.810> and

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 
you put it all on the wiring harness and

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.569 
you put it all on the wiring harness and
somehow<00:03:59.199> it<00:03:59.319> all<00:03:59.440> works<00:03:59.650> and<00:03:59.769> this<00:04:00.220> needs<00:04:00.459> an

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:00.579 
somehow it all works and this needs an

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:02.670 
somehow it all works and this needs an
extra<00:04:00.819> wire<00:04:01.000> too<00:04:01.269> and<00:04:02.139> you<00:04:02.230> get<00:04:02.410> the<00:04:02.500> wires

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.680 
extra wire too and you get the wires

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.349 
extra wire too and you get the wires
from<00:04:02.829> Volkswagens<00:04:03.489> so<00:04:03.579> they're<00:04:03.849> all<00:04:03.970> official

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:04.359 
from Volkswagens so they're all official

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:06.059 
from Volkswagens so they're all official
Volkswagen<00:04:04.810> wires<00:04:05.019> but<00:04:05.590> if<00:04:05.709> you<00:04:05.799> want<00:04:05.980> the

00:04:06.059 --> 00:04:06.069 
Volkswagen wires but if you want the

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:07.530 
Volkswagen wires but if you want the
rear<00:04:06.250> integrated<00:04:06.790> look<00:04:06.970> which<00:04:07.120> is<00:04:07.150> the<00:04:07.269> true

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
rear integrated look which is the true

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:09.539 
rear integrated look which is the true
euro<00:04:07.810> look<00:04:08.109> you<00:04:08.650> have<00:04:08.739> to<00:04:08.859> also<00:04:08.980> attach<00:04:09.370> that

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:09.549 
euro look you have to also attach that

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:11.819 
euro look you have to also attach that
to<00:04:09.609> your<00:04:09.699> ECU<00:04:10.090> then<00:04:10.810> when<00:04:10.959> they<00:04:11.049> reprogram<00:04:11.620> it

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:11.829 
to your ECU then when they reprogram it

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:13.710 
to your ECU then when they reprogram it
it<00:04:12.040> will<00:04:12.280> not<00:04:12.459> throw<00:04:12.730> off<00:04:12.819> any<00:04:13.000> fault<00:04:13.299> codes<00:04:13.569> or

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:13.720 
it will not throw off any fault codes or

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.059 
it will not throw off any fault codes or
anything<00:04:13.900> so<00:04:14.319> that's<00:04:14.379> enough<00:04:14.680> of<00:04:14.739> me<00:04:14.799> talking

00:04:15.059 --> 00:04:15.069 
anything so that's enough of me talking

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:16.379 
anything so that's enough of me talking
that's<00:04:15.459> what<00:04:15.579> the<00:04:15.730> lights<00:04:15.879> look<00:04:16.060> like<00:04:16.120> when

00:04:16.379 --> 00:04:16.389 
that's what the lights look like when

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:17.759 
that's what the lights look like when
they're<00:04:16.479> off<00:04:16.660> they're<00:04:17.049> pretty<00:04:17.229> hot<00:04:17.440> they<00:04:17.680> have

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:17.769 
they're off they're pretty hot they have

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:19.740 
they're off they're pretty hot they have
like<00:04:17.889> the<00:04:18.010> silver<00:04:18.340> looks<00:04:18.519> to<00:04:18.639> them<00:04:18.789> notice

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:19.750 
like the silver looks to them notice

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.379 
like the silver looks to them notice
they<00:04:19.870> got<00:04:20.079> the<00:04:20.289> hella<00:04:20.940> insignia<00:04:21.940> right<00:04:22.180> here

00:04:22.379 --> 00:04:22.389

what we got here first of all I'm gonna
put<00:04:43.690> on<00:04:43.810> my<00:04:43.840> front<00:04:44.139> fogs<00:04:44.440> and<00:04:44.740> then<00:04:44.830> my<00:04:44.919> rear

00:04:45.089 --> 00:04:45.099 
put on my front fogs and then my rear

00:04:45.099 --> 00:04:47.040 
put on my front fogs and then my rear
Fox<00:04:45.370> just<00:04:45.940> to<00:04:46.060> show<00:04:46.240> you<00:04:46.300> what<00:04:46.509> the<00:04:46.599> integrated

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.050 
Fox just to show you what the integrated

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:48.719 
Fox just to show you what the integrated
fog<00:04:47.229> light<00:04:47.470> looks<00:04:47.680> like<00:04:47.740> this<00:04:48.280> is<00:04:48.430> just<00:04:48.639> the

00:04:48.719 --> 00:04:48.729 
fog light looks like this is just the

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:53.050 
fog light looks like this is just the
fog<00:04:48.909> light

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:53.060 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:54.730 

and<00:04:53.600> you<00:04:53.690> can<00:04:53.840> see<00:04:53.960> it<00:04:54.080> doesn't<00:04:54.290> come<00:04:54.410> on<00:04:54.500> over

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:54.740 
and you can see it doesn't come on over

00:04:54.740 --> 00:05:03.550 
and you can see it doesn't come on over
there<00:04:54.890> and<00:04:55.430> that's<00:04:55.580> the<00:04:55.730> reverse<00:04:56.060> life

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:03.560 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:07.970 

it<00:05:04.560> is<00:05:04.650> pretty<00:05:04.860> bright<00:05:05.390> now<00:05:06.500> if<00:05:07.500> I<00:05:07.590> turn<00:05:07.770> on<00:05:07.800> the

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:07.980 
it is pretty bright now if I turn on the

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:11.090 
it is pretty bright now if I turn on the
actual<00:05:08.220> lights<00:05:09.200> we'll<00:05:10.200> go<00:05:10.350> one<00:05:10.500> step<00:05:10.770> over

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:11.100 
actual lights we'll go one step over

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:13.220 
actual lights we'll go one step over
there<00:05:11.280> I<00:05:11.460> turned<00:05:12.150> off<00:05:12.450> the<00:05:12.480> integrated<00:05:13.050> fog

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:13.230 
there I turned off the integrated fog

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:16.010 
there I turned off the integrated fog
and<00:05:13.410> I<00:05:13.440> just<00:05:13.560> turn<00:05:13.680> on<00:05:13.770> my<00:05:13.860> lights<00:05:14.540> and<00:05:15.540> that's

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:16.020 
and I just turn on my lights and that's

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:17.870 
and I just turn on my lights and that's
now<00:05:16.800> that<00:05:16.950> was<00:05:17.070> the<00:05:17.100> section<00:05:17.490> that<00:05:17.640> I<00:05:17.730> had

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:17.880 
now that was the section that I had

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:20.540 
now that was the section that I had
working<00:05:18.120> only<00:05:18.800> for<00:05:19.800> the<00:05:19.890> LEDs<00:05:20.310> doing

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:20.550 
working only for the LEDs doing

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:22.970 
working only for the LEDs doing
something<00:05:20.790> weird<00:05:21.030> to<00:05:21.120> the<00:05:21.260> weird<00:05:22.260> man<00:05:22.680> look<00:05:22.920> at

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:22.980 
something weird to the weird man look at

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:23.180 
something weird to the weird man look at
that

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:23.190 
that

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:26.330 
that
Oh<00:05:23.840> wonder<00:05:24.840> if<00:05:24.900> that<00:05:25.020> shows<00:05:25.200> up<00:05:25.410> it's<00:05:26.190> like

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:26.340 
Oh wonder if that shows up it's like

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:31.700 
Oh wonder if that shows up it's like
it's<00:05:26.580> freaking<00:05:26.910> out<00:05:27.030> the<00:05:27.210> camera<00:05:30.620> and<00:05:31.620> that's

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:31.710 
it's freaking out the camera and that's

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:33.880 
it's freaking out the camera and that's
the<00:05:31.860> route<00:05:32.100> that's<00:05:32.250> the<00:05:32.460> red<00:05:32.640> and<00:05:33.090> of<00:05:33.330> course

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:33.890 
the route that's the red and of course

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:36.110 
the route that's the red and of course
I'll<00:05:34.890> just<00:05:35.070> be<00:05:35.190> quick<00:05:35.370> with<00:05:35.550> this<00:05:35.670> this<00:05:35.850> is<00:05:35.910> the

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:36.120 
I'll just be quick with this this is the
