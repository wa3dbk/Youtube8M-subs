00:07:16.159 --> 00:07:18.580 
as well let's conclude the review yes o+
did<00:07:16.400> a<00:07:16.520> great<00:07:16.969> job<00:07:17.210> than<00:07:17.690> my<00:07:17.870> expectations

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:18.590 
did a great job than my expectations

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:21.010 
did a great job than my expectations
with<00:07:19.159> its<00:07:19.310> excellent<00:07:19.880> build<00:07:20.210> and<00:07:20.449> hardware

with its excellent build and hardware

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:23.740 
with its excellent build and hardware
but<00:07:21.979> does<00:07:22.490> it<00:07:22.610> worth<00:07:22.849> over<00:07:23.240> something<00:07:23.569> like

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:23.750 
but does it worth over something like

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:26.769 
but does it worth over something like
the<00:07:24.110> xiaomi<00:07:24.710> redmi<00:07:24.740> 1s<00:07:25.150> which<00:07:26.150> is<00:07:26.360> offering
