anyways<00:00:44.700> oh<00:00:47.210> I<00:00:48.350> don't<00:00:49.350> this<00:00:49.950> map<00:00:50.250> is<00:00:50.280> ok<00:00:50.850> I

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
anyways oh I don't this map is ok I

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.240 
anyways oh I don't this map is ok I
think<00:00:51.480> I<00:00:51.870> think<00:00:52.170> they<00:00:52.320> need<00:00:52.500> more<00:00:52.530> sniper

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
think I think they need more sniper

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.520 
think I think they need more sniper
rifles<00:00:53.790> because<00:00:54.210> they're<00:00:54.420> so<00:00:54.629> hard<00:00:54.840> to<00:00:54.960> use<00:00:55.260> I

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
rifles because they're so hard to use I

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.529 
rifles because they're so hard to use I
think<00:00:56.070> if<00:00:56.160> they<00:00:56.280> put<00:00:56.520> more<00:00:56.760> on<00:00:56.789> the<00:00:57.059> map<00:00:57.270> that

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
think if they put more on the map that

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.389 
think if they put more on the map that
it'd<00:00:57.660> be<00:00:57.780> a<00:00:57.809> lot<00:00:58.020> easier<00:00:58.350> for<00:00:58.590> people<00:00:58.920> to<00:00:59.160> kind

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
it'd be a lot easier for people to kind

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.520 
it'd be a lot easier for people to kind
of<00:00:59.550> even<00:00:59.789> the<00:01:00.059> playing<00:01:00.420> field<00:01:00.600> Morse

00:01:04.999 --> 00:01:05.009 
nieghbors means you know I don't know

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:07.279 
nieghbors means you know I don't know
where<00:01:05.159> I<00:01:05.219> was<00:01:05.339> going<00:01:05.399> back<00:01:05.960> and<00:01:06.960> just<00:01:07.109> stay

00:01:07.279 --> 00:01:07.289 
where I was going back and just stay

00:01:07.289 --> 00:01:08.719 
where I was going back and just stay
there<00:01:07.350> needs<00:01:07.619> to<00:01:07.740> be<00:01:07.770> more<00:01:07.859> snipers<00:01:08.579> and

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
there needs to be more snipers and

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.489 
there needs to be more snipers and
probably<00:01:09.420> less<00:01:09.600> everything<00:01:10.079> else<00:01:10.759> um<00:01:12.499> but

00:01:13.489 --> 00:01:13.499 
probably less everything else um but

00:01:13.499 --> 00:01:17.480 
probably less everything else um but
yeah<00:01:13.649> make<00:01:13.889> the<00:01:14.039> snipers<00:01:14.520> easier<00:01:15.149> oh<00:01:16.279> it<00:01:17.279> make

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
yeah make the snipers easier oh it make

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.730 
yeah make the snipers easier oh it make
these<00:01:17.700> less<00:01:17.969> powerful<00:01:18.359> because<00:01:19.319> I<00:01:19.439> think<00:01:19.499> it's

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
these less powerful because I think it's

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:25.600 
these less powerful because I think it's
too<00:01:20.090> too<00:01:21.090> easy<00:01:21.420> ah
