piece of red oak and cutting the 15

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.719 
piece of red oak and cutting the 15
degrees<00:01:57.090> on<00:01:57.390> both<00:01:57.780> of<00:01:57.990> them<00:01:58.200> so<00:01:58.580> let's<00:01:59.580> get

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
degrees on both of them so let's get

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.070 
degrees on both of them so let's get
that<00:01:59.880> cut<00:02:00.149> real<00:02:00.300> quick<00:02:00.360> and<00:02:00.750> then<00:02:00.840> we'll<00:02:00.930> move

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:01.080 
that cut real quick and then we'll move

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:07.670 
that cut real quick and then we'll move
on<00:02:01.229> to<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:01.440> next<00:02:01.619> step<00:02:05.060> all<00:02:06.060> right<00:02:06.270> so<00:02:06.509> I<00:02:06.990> got

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
on to the next step all right so I got

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.639 
on to the next step all right so I got
all<00:02:07.830> the<00:02:07.920> pieces<00:02:08.100> cut<00:02:08.519> they're<00:02:09.330> all<00:02:09.450> at<00:02:09.660> the<00:02:09.869> 15

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
all the pieces cut they're all at the 15

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.490 
all the pieces cut they're all at the 15
degree<00:02:10.769> angles<00:02:11.430> you<00:02:12.420> know<00:02:12.510> I'll<00:02:12.630> match<00:02:13.019> all<00:02:13.290> up

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
degree angles you know I'll match all up

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.970 
degree angles you know I'll match all up
real<00:02:13.739> nice<00:02:13.950> and<00:02:14.780> what<00:02:15.780> the<00:02:15.900> next<00:02:16.110> step<00:02:16.320> is<00:02:16.560> go

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
real nice and what the next step is go

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.490 
real nice and what the next step is go
ahead<00:02:17.100> glue<00:02:17.519> it<00:02:17.670> up<00:02:17.820> and<00:02:18.269> get<00:02:19.170> it<00:02:19.290> clamped

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
ahead glue it up and get it clamped

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.060 
ahead glue it up and get it clamped
together<00:02:20.120> and<00:02:21.120> let<00:02:21.450> it<00:02:21.570> sit<00:02:21.840> overnight<00:02:22.080> and

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
together and let it sit overnight and

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:26.870 
together and let it sit overnight and
then<00:02:23.790> we'll<00:02:24.209> be<00:02:24.510> coming<00:02:24.750> back<00:02:24.870> and<00:02:25.700> cutting<00:02:26.700> it

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
then we'll be coming back and cutting it

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.620 
then we'll be coming back and cutting it
and<00:02:27.120> then<00:02:28.519> I'll<00:02:29.519> show<00:02:29.760> you<00:02:29.790> the<00:02:30.060> design<00:02:30.390> that

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630

little bit thicker than the Purple Heart

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.820 
little bit thicker than the Purple Heart
I'll<00:04:14.690> make<00:04:14.870> sure<00:04:15.020> it's<00:04:15.200> all<00:04:15.290> nice<00:04:15.530> and<00:04:15.590> even

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 
for whenever we whenever we flip-flop

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:22.840 
for whenever we whenever we flip-flop
the<00:04:19.700> the<00:04:20.209> little<00:04:20.390> angles<00:04:20.900> here<00:04:21.160> a<00:04:22.160> little

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:22.850 
the the little angles here a little

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:24.190 
the the little angles here a little
thing<00:04:23.150> to<00:04:23.330> do

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:24.200 
thing to do

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:27.790 
thing to do
my<00:04:24.590> planer<00:04:24.980> it<00:04:25.340> causes<00:04:25.910> snipe<00:04:26.180> or<00:04:26.870> it<00:04:27.200> snaps<00:04:27.680> a

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:27.800 
my planer it causes snipe or it snaps a

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.620 
my planer it causes snipe or it snaps a
little<00:04:27.980> bit<00:04:28.100> on<00:04:28.250> the<00:04:28.370> backside<00:04:28.790> of<00:04:28.820> all<00:04:29.090> the

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:29.630 
little bit on the backside of all the

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:31.510 
little bit on the backside of all the
wood<00:04:29.810> so<00:04:30.470> I'm<00:04:30.560> actually<00:04:30.710> gonna<00:04:31.040> have<00:04:31.310> this

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:31.520 
wood so I'm actually gonna have this

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:35.920 
wood so I'm actually gonna have this
other<00:04:31.700> piece<00:04:32.030> and<00:04:32.390> as<00:04:33.910> I'm<00:04:34.910> feeding<00:04:35.600> it

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:35.930 
other piece and as I'm feeding it

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:38.230 
other piece and as I'm feeding it
through<00:04:35.960> I'll<00:04:36.800> actually<00:04:37.070> take<00:04:37.580> this<00:04:37.850> other

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:38.240 
through I'll actually take this other

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:41.190 
through I'll actually take this other
piece<00:04:38.600> and<00:04:38.930> feed<00:04:39.260> it<00:04:39.470> on<00:04:39.560> the<00:04:39.740> backside<00:04:40.310> so

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:41.200 
piece and feed it on the backside so

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:44.470 
piece and feed it on the backside so
this<00:04:42.200> piece<00:04:42.500> actually<00:04:43.040> gets<00:04:43.430> the<00:04:43.610> snipe<00:04:43.940> on<00:04:44.240> it

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:44.480 
this piece actually gets the snipe on it

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:49.450 
this piece actually gets the snipe on it
instead<00:04:44.900> of<00:04:45.580> the<00:04:46.580> actual<00:04:47.090> workpiece<00:04:47.990> so<00:04:48.740> you

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:49.460 
instead of the actual workpiece so you

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:51.280 
instead of the actual workpiece so you
can<00:04:49.669> always<00:04:49.820> do<00:04:50.090> that<00:04:50.300> or<00:04:50.600> I<00:04:50.630> could<00:04:51.020> have<00:04:51.110> left

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:51.290 
can always do that or I could have left

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:54.460 
can always do that or I could have left
another<00:04:51.910> four<00:04:52.910> to<00:04:53.210> six<00:04:53.480> inches<00:04:53.840> on<00:04:54.020> the<00:04:54.200> end

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:54.470 
another four to six inches on the end

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:57.970 
another four to six inches on the end
and<00:04:54.880> then<00:04:55.880> just<00:04:56.090> cut<00:04:56.660> that<00:04:56.840> right<00:04:56.900> off<00:04:57.320> but<00:04:57.680> I

00:04:57.970 --> 00:04:57.980 
and then just cut that right off but I

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:59.020 
and then just cut that right off but I
did<00:04:58.190> not<00:04:58.460> do<00:04:58.730> that

00:04:59.020 --> 00:04:59.030 
did not do that

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:01.720 
did not do that
and<00:04:59.419> so<00:05:00.380> I'm<00:05:00.440> gonna<00:05:00.560> use<00:05:00.800> this<00:05:00.950> a<00:05:01.130> little<00:05:01.460> stick

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:01.730 
and so I'm gonna use this a little stick

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:03.790 
and so I'm gonna use this a little stick
here<00:05:01.760> to<00:05:02.570> kind<00:05:02.780> of<00:05:02.840> keep<00:05:03.020> this<00:05:03.260> up<00:05:03.500> a<00:05:03.590> little

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:03.800 
here to kind of keep this up a little

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.280 
here to kind of keep this up a little
bit<00:05:03.980> so<00:05:04.640> let's<00:05:05.419> get<00:05:05.570> this<00:05:05.690> plane<00:05:05.990> down<00:05:06.230> and

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:06.290 
bit so let's get this plane down and

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:10.810 
bit so let's get this plane down and
then<00:05:06.710> we'll<00:05:06.860> go<00:05:06.919> to<00:05:07.550> the<00:05:07.940> miter<00:05:08.780> saw<00:05:09.200> and<00:05:09.820> we'll

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:10.820 
then we'll go to the miter saw and we'll

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:13.810 
then we'll go to the miter saw and we'll
get<00:05:11.030> that<00:05:11.210> all<00:05:11.419> cut<00:05:11.690> up<00:05:11.720> and<00:05:12.110> we'll<00:05:13.070> get<00:05:13.520> it<00:05:13.640> all

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:13.820 
get that all cut up and we'll get it all

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:19.350 
get that all cut up and we'll get it all
put<00:05:14.270> together<00:05:14.360> again<00:05:16.840> okay<00:05:17.870> well<00:05:18.260> so<00:05:18.830> I've<00:05:18.980> got

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:40.520 
we're gonna be cutting on the miter saw

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:42.909 
we're gonna be cutting on the miter saw
right<00:05:40.760> now<00:05:40.940> as<00:05:41.270> you<00:05:41.840> can<00:05:41.870> see<00:05:42.260> I've<00:05:42.530> made<00:05:42.890> a

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:46.400 
stop block it's a three quarter inch off

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:50.770 
stop block it's a three quarter inch off
of<00:05:46.430> where<00:05:46.910> the<00:05:47.030> blades<00:05:47.270> gonna<00:05:47.480> be<00:05:48.520> and<00:05:49.780> I'll
