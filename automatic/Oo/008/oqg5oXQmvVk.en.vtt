00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.420
 not the water of the aquatic attractions smells like a well, like the water of the 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:14.090
 various sources that are around the park in which they constantly bathe 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:18.480
 children and people who are looking to cool off some of them literally smell of shit and 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.820
 forgive the word but it is true in what they are dedicated to review backpacks to 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:26.490
 see if they have food and drink that look to see who has fought at home and 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.100
 who goes full of shit to shower there and to purify the water from time to time 

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:33.960
 when or constantly that it does not cost work the purifier does 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.020
 it seems to me a lack of respect towards society that can be acquired 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:43.690
 quite expensive bracelets considering the excessive price of the entrance 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:47.330
 so that the privileged who have more money can sneak in 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:51.490
 literally and go directly to the attractions I think the estates 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:56.270
 socialities disappeared in the middle ages and here we are giving them the step that 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:59.020
 have more money do not expect cola 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:03.050
 the queues at some attractions are brutal because they are not filled by 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:04.750
 full 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.100
 I do not use the excuse of being damaged because they fix it 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:14.570
 that for something we pay 35 euros entrance 6 euros parking in full sun 3 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:19.380
 euros for a 50 centiliter water bottle and the food menus nor what 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.000
 I know I do not want to know and I'm in charge of passing the sandwiches as 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.920
 they will think that it is their part and that they direct it as they want but I think that 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.490
 they are in Spain and that since consumers are not money people 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.720
 except for 3 people should think about keeping the customers happy 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.890
 that people go once and then do not come back and spend what happens losses 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.950
 millionaire etcetera or rather not profits instead of losses 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.760
 as penultimate note the characters that dispatch because they can not be 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.420
 call waiters 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.689
 and 15 minutes to dispatch two doctors and two people to make a ball of 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:59.310
 Sweet cotton seems to me painful if they do not know how to work, do not hire them 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.710
 thing is the labor integration of immigrants and something else is that 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:08.170
 and as a last point it would not hurt a few shadows while you wait 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.650
 queue to get the tickets because the sun burns I do not know if they know it I hope that 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.799
 yes
