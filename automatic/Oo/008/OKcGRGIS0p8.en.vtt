now we use 1/3 of the water on these
varietals<00:01:12.200> that<00:01:13.200> I<00:01:13.229> do<00:01:13.409> and<00:01:13.799> in<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.310> rest<00:01:14.490> of

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
varietals that I do and in the rest of

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.190 
varietals that I do and in the rest of
the<00:01:14.640> vineyard<00:01:14.939> so<00:01:15.180> it's<00:01:15.299> it's<00:01:15.659> a<00:01:15.840> it's<00:01:16.080> an
