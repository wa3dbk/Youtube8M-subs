 can laugh again have had their idols 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.920
 the clear defeat in gotha ​​only 48 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.609
 hours ago well put away 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.650

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.900
 rasta dome they defeated on sunday the 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:34.160

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.700
 reparation she was successful 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:40.170
 I think that the boys just turn 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.300
 of course believed with the 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.530
 spectators in the back that was like at first 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.510
 you could see a little bit again 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:49.230
 Nervousness that is just in the first 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.469
 quarter I think six turner happened 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.329
 are 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.940
 then we have better in the second 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.739
 made but i think the reason was 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.210
 that the boys just 40 minutes long 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.539
 believed in this game too 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.010
 win 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.840
 the game is influenced by everyone 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.270
 fall from this scene in the third 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.400
 minute heidelberg center koloss chris 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.460
 kelly is fighting for the rebound in the fight 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.790
 the foot of rasso bianco medley kinks 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.040
 around 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:14.130
 while the game continues 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.270
 the 120 kilo man remains on the ground 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.759
 to hurt yourself 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.590
 it does not go on for him 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.930
 raster is missing with donald lawson the 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.909
 starting center you can only about it 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.799
 speculate on what would have happened if 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.049
 yes then I can say exactly what it would be 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.939
 if lausanne has played that 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.650
 has happened that is very unhappy 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.390
 of course then in the case for 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.110
 heidelberg maybe for us 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.390
 small advantage 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.540
 but as I said what would have happened now 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.759
 if the guests from the south visibly 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.140
 irritated by the failure let get the game 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.390
 grid in the cards 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.310
 vincent bailey can play well 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.049
 and high hit rate in defensive 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.170
 turn and act as he pleases 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:55.939
 almost unbelievable 19 meters makes the 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.939
 rookie at half past one 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.990
 the homeowners are also good at it 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.240
 Oliver Mackel Dance gets minutes 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.770
 took advantage of his freedom and lets himself 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.690
 do not ask for long 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.849
 Two turned free throws from Amilcare 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.920
 array leave grid shortly before quarter 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:15.790
 then pull away on six counter 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.790
 that happens 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:26.150
 nico Adamczak tip from 23 meters to 19 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.820
 22 from heidelberger view 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:34.040
 Unbelievable throw but everything else 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:35.840
 as luck is it is allowed us anyway 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.640
 do not happen even if you're like that 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.440
 we did not expect a hit 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.630
 a good advantage in the second quarter 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.980
 take it well every now and then goes like that 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:45.830
 one then also in 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.790
 rasta recovers from this magic 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.620
 only slowly 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.290
 heidelberg seeks his salvation from the 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:54.200
 distance and meets a total of 93 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:56.150
 a 18 0 series and heidelberg lies 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.010
 again in front even with six counters 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.350
 are the fencers in the meantime 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:04.030
 back then give but between gas 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:04.030
 put on the pace 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.440
 chase griffin with two of his total 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.360
 19 points 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.700
 the use of the fighting spirit in the 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.920
 Defense votes anyway and allows 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:18.130
 raster at the end of the first half of the 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:23.560
 pass by the opponent again 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:23.560
 46 to 45 after 20 minutes 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:30.630
 in gotha ​​we had one at half time 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.610
 almost identical situation every one of 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.150
 We really hate losing everyone 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:34.800
 in the team 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.220
 and so we have the right one today 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:39.780
 Answer given after the page change 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:42.270
 casta plays one from the third quarter 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:44.760
 partly quite strong defense only leaves 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:48.630
 still little to benefit from the 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:50.760
 Arrow-fast chase griffin a 13 too 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:53.280
 0 posted grid in the third quarter 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:57.060
 the parquet of the now brother dan raster 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:58.830
 how fast it runs 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.170
 interplay of fencers sometimes times 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:04.350
 especially point guard amazon is 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:07.710
 proves overview and joy of playing raster 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:11.720
 is now at 59 to 47 in front 

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:14.010
 we have good offensives on friday 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:16.500
 not to our rhythm found that 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:18.480
 was of course also in the 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.799
 second half in the case this we 

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:21.780
 the second half only 30 points 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:24.920
 admitted and that is actually the way it is 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:27.270
 How I imagine this 

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:28.320
 fechters coach can open this time 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:30.420
 leave his boys 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:33.150
 also and especially on his bankers 

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:35.730
 america with one of two completely 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:37.570
 so important of his threesome 

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:40.070
 fast 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:41.480
 that is already one of my strengths 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:43.850
 to throw ball fast 

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:45.830
 Therefor also left every day ready for 

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:47.750
 when i come on the field i know 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:51.470
 what the coaches of me want that 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:53.270
 i also want to afford my family 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:55.580
 perhaps I would say a bit 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:57.110
 difficult difficult role than that 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:59.930
 other americans if you say so 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:02.390
 want is the fifth army has until 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:03.890
 now relatively less playtime 

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:05.630
 I got him before the game 

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:08.690
 said that he should be ready today 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:10.850
 he will get more playing time 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:12.080
 told me that he is ready and he 

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:15.170
 that not only said I think then 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:17.210
 also with baskets and also with the use 

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:19.130
 And the fans also showed that he was ready 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:20.900
 and I for him I'd say 

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:22.670
 first of all personally happy that 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:24.860
 he was able to present itself today as the 

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:26.480
 three of amir carol s toby young go 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:30.290
 the crucial full of crass that 

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:32.480
 Number 25 hits 81 70 well 

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:35.000
 two and a half minutes before the end 

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:36.769
 heidelberg on the ground and not now 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.659
 more really 

00:05:36.769 --> 00:05:42.269
 really poor system where i played 

00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:43.799
 but bring the ball after the 

00:05:42.269 --> 00:05:46.529
 nico came and shaped me a lot 

00:05:43.799 --> 00:05:49.499
 So a lot of pressure built up and thought to me 

00:05:46.529 --> 00:05:51.569
 Well ok, well, try to adapt and then 

00:05:49.499 --> 00:05:53.819
 somehow please give to the elbow 

00:05:51.569 --> 00:05:56.489
 provided from of course I do not know 

00:05:53.819 --> 00:05:59.429
 and has the situation also erotic open 

00:05:56.489 --> 00:06:02.129
 Throw the ball to celebrate arts 

00:05:59.429 --> 00:06:04.349
 with and topskorer winzy bailey what that 

00:06:02.129 --> 00:06:07.259
 point guard with nine assists and none 

00:06:04.349 --> 00:06:09.269
 single turnover right that victory with 16 

00:06:07.259 --> 00:06:11.879
 points difference is good to look at 

00:06:09.269 --> 00:06:17.549
 Even if the coach prefers 60 to 50 

00:06:11.879 --> 00:06:20.009
 wins the fans coach important for 

00:06:17.549 --> 00:06:21.749
 the people so the teams under 70 

00:06:20.009 --> 00:06:23.969
 Best hold but there are always 

00:06:21.749 --> 00:06:25.829
 possible especially if a gentleman adamczak 

00:06:23.969 --> 00:06:28.349
 Today, the wildest throws hit where I am 

00:06:25.829 --> 00:06:31.769
 I think water for kids apologize 

00:06:28.349 --> 00:06:33.719
 but yes, but in the end , so are victors 

00:06:31.769 --> 00:06:35.459

00:06:33.719 --> 00:06:37.739
 winning is us map it sees it 

00:06:35.459 --> 00:06:39.899
