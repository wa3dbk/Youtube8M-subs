it's I for me when I'm working with

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.210 
it's I for me when I'm working with
materials<00:01:33.420> it's<00:01:33.720> just<00:01:33.960> if<00:01:34.110> I<00:01:34.229> give<00:01:34.439> the<00:01:34.950> pure

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
materials it's just if I give the pure

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.340 
materials it's just if I give the pure
material<00:01:35.759> and<00:01:35.880> how<00:01:35.939> it<00:01:36.060> affects<00:01:36.360> we<00:01:36.509> are

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
material and how it affects we are

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.730 
material and how it affects we are
getting<00:01:38.310> excited<00:01:38.850> by<00:01:39.000> it<00:01:39.060> is<00:01:40.020> wood<00:01:40.560> has<00:01:40.710> been

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
getting excited by it is wood has been

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.300 
getting excited by it is wood has been
the<00:01:41.070> core<00:01:41.340> but<00:01:41.850> it's<00:01:42.000> this<00:01:42.119> new<00:01:42.360> technique<00:01:42.840> of

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
the core but it's this new technique of

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.800 
the core but it's this new technique of
bending<00:01:44.310> the<00:01:44.430> wood<00:01:44.579> that<00:01:44.850> kind<00:01:45.390> of<00:01:45.450> has

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
bending the wood that kind of has

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.050 
bending the wood that kind of has
excited<00:01:46.110> me<00:01:46.409> recently<00:01:46.740> in<00:01:47.189> terms<00:01:47.430> of<00:01:47.670> being

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
excited me recently in terms of being

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.550 
excited me recently in terms of being
able<00:01:48.210> to<00:01:48.360> make<00:01:48.600> some<00:01:48.810> shapes<00:01:49.020> that<00:01:49.290> weren't

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
able to make some shapes that weren't

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.010 
able to make some shapes that weren't
possible<00:01:49.740> before<00:01:50.119> but<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.240> process<00:01:51.750> there's

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
possible before but the process there's

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.630 
possible before but the process there's
a<00:01:52.110> steam<00:01:52.740> and<00:01:53.009> then<00:01:53.100> there's<00:01:53.250> a<00:01:53.280> compression

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
a steam and then there's a compression

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.670 
a steam and then there's a compression
process<00:01:54.149> that<00:01:54.600> alters<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:55.110> cell<00:01:55.320> structure

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
process that alters the cell structure

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.880 
process that alters the cell structure
that<00:01:56.369> really<00:01:56.820> pushes<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:57.750> act<00:01:58.680> of

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
that really pushes the act of

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.670 
that really pushes the act of
woodworking<00:01:59.509> beyond<00:02:00.509> anything<00:02:00.869> that<00:02:01.049> man<00:02:01.469> is

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
woodworking beyond anything that man is

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.060 
woodworking beyond anything that man is
known<00:02:01.909> before<00:02:02.909> 10-15<00:02:03.689> years<00:02:03.719> ago<00:02:04.020> it's<00:02:04.740> kind

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
known before 10-15 years ago it's kind

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.230 
known before 10-15 years ago it's kind
of<00:02:05.189> a<00:02:05.310> just<00:02:05.520> a<00:02:05.610> new

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
of a just a new

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.389 
of a just a new
way<00:02:06.780> of<00:02:07.020> working<00:02:07.440> with<00:02:07.740> the<00:02:07.830> material<00:02:08.280> is

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
way of working with the material is

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.540 
way of working with the material is
really<00:02:08.550> excited<00:02:09.030> I<00:02:09.149> think<00:02:09.780> would<00:02:10.229> is<00:02:10.500> it<00:02:11.430> it

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
really excited I think would is it it

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.840 
really excited I think would is it it
hasn't<00:02:11.730> gotten<00:02:12.060> it's<00:02:12.570> like<00:02:13.220> proper<00:02:14.220> place<00:02:14.490> but

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
hasn't gotten it's like proper place but

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:16.130 
hasn't gotten it's like proper place but
I<00:02:15.030> think<00:02:15.390> it's<00:02:15.480> when<00:02:15.570> we<00:02:15.660> take<00:02:15.900> it<00:02:15.990> for<00:02:16.110> granted

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
I think it's when we take it for granted

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.520 
I think it's when we take it for granted
as<00:02:16.650> a<00:02:16.920> material<00:02:17.460> and<00:02:17.730> in<00:02:18.090> society<00:02:19.080> in<00:02:19.500> general

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
as a material and in society in general

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.670 
as a material and in society in general
let<00:02:20.100> alone<00:02:20.340> in<00:02:20.720> contemporary<00:02:21.720> wood<00:02:22.230> or

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
let alone in contemporary wood or

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.310 
let alone in contemporary wood or
contemporary<00:02:23.130> jewelry<00:02:23.670> so<00:02:24.180> for<00:02:24.810> me<00:02:24.900> it's<00:02:25.080> to

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
contemporary jewelry so for me it's to

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.410 
contemporary jewelry so for me it's to
give<00:02:25.560> it<00:02:25.740> it's<00:02:26.580> to<00:02:26.700> give<00:02:26.850> it<00:02:26.940> its<00:02:27.060> rightful

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
give it it's to give it its rightful

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.360 
give it it's to give it its rightful
place<00:02:27.690> and<00:02:28.140> respect<00:02:28.590> it<00:02:28.770> just<00:02:29.010> like<00:02:29.220> we

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
place and respect it just like we

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.240 
place and respect it just like we
respect<00:02:29.700> any<00:02:29.850> gem<00:02:30.150> or<00:02:30.390> precious<00:02:31.230> material<00:02:31.950> and

respect any gem or precious material and

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.120 
respect any gem or precious material and
I<00:02:32.700> think<00:02:33.290> people<00:02:34.290> connect<00:02:34.680> with<00:02:34.740> that<00:02:35.010> they

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
I think people connect with that they

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.370 
I think people connect with that they
understand<00:02:35.640> and<00:02:35.940> they<00:02:36.390> they<00:02:36.690> kind<00:02:36.900> of<00:02:36.960> elevate

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
understand and they they kind of elevate

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.920 
understand and they they kind of elevate
it<00:02:37.530> na<00:02:37.680> naration<00:02:38.040> I<00:02:38.310> believe<00:02:38.580> that<00:02:38.820> that<00:02:39.480> the

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
it na naration I believe that that the

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.290 
it na naration I believe that that the
act<00:02:40.080> of<00:02:40.260> creating<00:02:40.650> when<00:02:41.010> when<00:02:41.730> you<00:02:41.820> decide<00:02:42.209> to

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
act of creating when when you decide to

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:43.880 
act of creating when when you decide to
put<00:02:42.480> you<00:02:42.600> you<00:02:43.170> know<00:02:43.260> the<00:02:43.350> clothes<00:02:43.560> that<00:02:43.770> you

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
put you you know the clothes that you

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.520 
put you you know the clothes that you
wear<00:02:44.070> it's<00:02:44.640> a<00:02:44.760> creative<00:02:45.030> act<00:02:45.330> for<00:02:45.570> me<00:02:45.720> you<00:02:46.200> know

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
wear it's a creative act for me you know

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.199 
wear it's a creative act for me you know
you're<00:02:47.070> representing<00:02:47.670> yourself<00:02:47.760> to<00:02:48.120> the

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
you're representing yourself to the

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:50.030 
you're representing yourself to the
world<00:02:48.390> so<00:02:48.660> I<00:02:48.690> think<00:02:48.720> to<00:02:49.500> separate<00:02:49.920> ourselves

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
world so I think to separate ourselves

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.080 
world so I think to separate ourselves
from<00:02:51.350> from<00:02:52.350> creating<00:02:53.070> or<00:02:53.280> to<00:02:53.490> be<00:02:53.610> an<00:02:53.730> artist

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
from from creating or to be an artist

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.720 
from from creating or to be an artist
outside<00:02:54.570> of<00:02:54.840> mainstream<00:02:55.560> I<00:02:56.190> think<00:02:56.520> it's<00:02:56.640> to

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
outside of mainstream I think it's to

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.130 
outside of mainstream I think it's to
separate<00:02:57.150> us<00:02:57.180> from<00:02:57.300> the<00:02:57.600> rest<00:02:57.720> of<00:02:57.870> the<00:02:57.959> world

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
separate us from the rest of the world

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.900 
separate us from the rest of the world
but<00:02:58.350> I<00:02:58.410> believe<00:02:58.920> that<00:02:58.950> everybody's<00:02:59.490> radiated

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
but I believe that everybody's radiated

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.030 
but I believe that everybody's radiated
when<00:03:00.000> we<00:03:00.120> limit<00:03:00.420> ourselves<00:03:00.510> by<00:03:01.500> saying<00:03:01.830> I'm

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
when we limit ourselves by saying I'm

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.770 
when we limit ourselves by saying I'm
not<00:03:02.160> creative<00:03:02.760> or<00:03:02.910> I<00:03:02.940> don't<00:03:03.060> do<00:03:03.330> this<00:03:03.480> or<00:03:03.720> I

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
not creative or I don't do this or I

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.120 
not creative or I don't do this or I
don't<00:03:03.810> do<00:03:04.020> that<00:03:04.140> we're<00:03:04.530> kind<00:03:04.680> of<00:03:04.709> boxing

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
don't do that we're kind of boxing

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.610 
don't do that we're kind of boxing
ourselves<00:03:05.520> out<00:03:05.640> of<00:03:06.230> out<00:03:07.230> of<00:03:07.260> our<00:03:07.500> own

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.710 
ourselves out of out of our own
humanists<00:03:08.280> so<00:03:08.730> we<00:03:08.880> got<00:03:09.000> to<00:03:09.090> have<00:03:09.209> that<00:03:09.480> freedom

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
humanists so we got to have that freedom

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.710 
humanists so we got to have that freedom
to<00:03:09.990> create<00:03:10.230> anything<00:03:11.269> and<00:03:12.269> that's<00:03:12.510> kind<00:03:12.690> of

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
to create anything and that's kind of

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.180 
to create anything and that's kind of
what<00:03:12.870> allowed<00:03:13.110> me<00:03:13.140> to<00:03:13.380> kind<00:03:13.620> of<00:03:13.739> go<00:03:13.920> in<00:03:14.040> any
