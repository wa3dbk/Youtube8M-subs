00:02:01.699 --> 00:02:01.709 
loosely because it was basically the

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:04.039 
loosely because it was basically the

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
production version that I saw not sure

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.600 
production version that I saw not sure
if<00:02:04.140> any<00:02:04.289> of<00:02:04.409> those<00:02:04.560> 6,000<00:02:05.219> models<00:02:05.489> will

don't get it you know what I mean a que
yo<00:02:29.970> yeah<00:02:30.450> now<00:02:31.019> for<00:02:31.260> example<00:02:31.290> trains<00:02:31.920> go<00:02:32.130> with

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
yo yeah now for example trains go with

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.150 
yo yeah now for example trains go with
tracks<00:02:32.579> cars<00:02:33.480> go<00:02:33.690> with<00:02:33.840> roads<00:02:34.109> planes<00:02:34.799> go<00:02:35.040> with

cheese<00:02:37.530> you<00:02:38.010> get<00:02:38.160> the<00:02:38.280> idea<00:02:38.340> now<00:02:39.209> this<00:02:39.389> simple

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
cheese you get the idea now this simple

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.449 
cheese you get the idea now this simple
reasoning<00:02:40.169> isn't<00:02:40.500> difficult<00:02:40.650> for<00:02:41.040> most<00:02:41.160> of<00:02:41.340> us

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
reasoning isn't difficult for most of us

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:44.089 
reasoning isn't difficult for most of us
that<00:02:42.299> again<00:02:42.599> most<00:02:42.900> of<00:02:43.049> us<00:02:43.169> aren't<00:02:43.380> high<00:02:43.829> on

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:44.099 
that again most of us aren't high on

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:45.740 
that again most of us aren't high on
something<00:02:44.400> when<00:02:45.120> we<00:02:45.239> get<00:02:45.389> behind<00:02:45.660> the<00:02:45.720> wheel
