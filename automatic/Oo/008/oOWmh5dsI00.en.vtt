00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.480
 how to build muscles effectively when

 does weight training etc we are 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.789
 beginner 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.199
 a lot of people have gone ahead to the green 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.640
 when one starts does one have to 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.750
 stop going out and do I have to 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.270
 stop drinking alcohol 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.250
 do I have to stop mcdo 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.280
 do you stop eating 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:41.940
 nutella is what I have to stop two 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:42.390
 and a girlfriend dwarf poodle before doing 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.579
 the pecs 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.260
 my answer is no when you start 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.149
 to bodybuilding when beginners 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.100
 your body is not used and other 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.390
 body will react very quickly precisely to that 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.710
 frankly I'm not even surprised that 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.629
 the people who come to win the 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.460
 first of muscu between 10 and 15 kg of 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.140
 mu my opinion here on the bodybuilding the 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.370
 does that to have a healthy lifestyle 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.809
 it 's something before it's done 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.969
 step by step 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.110
 it is useless law suddenly changed 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.880
 really all your habits 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.470
 after spending an hour in the bathroom 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.100
 muscu your diet habits is 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.260
 really something that is going 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.060
 improve little by little after 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.590
 year when so much of the day at 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.390
 next day you are eating six meals 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.619
 per day and that morning instead of 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.030
 take a chocolate and nutella 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.280
 you took oatmeal flakes and 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.210
 the water got weird that makes you 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.740
 very weird 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.780
 and that's it and mentally you're not going 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.740
 able to hold on and you gave up and 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.200
 it's really a shame 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.400
 so little by little you will be able 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.470
 adjust your diet 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.240
 for example you will reduce small to 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.970
 little your portions were there you go 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.560
 also add a piece of ham 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.900
 eggs the malt a policeman to have by little 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.490
 about 30 g of protein per meal is ok 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.380
 really be done little by little at night 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.670
 for example you will replace the 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.950
 white paws by complete pasta 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.329
 at the beginning of course you will put some 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.680
 grated cheese you're going to put some 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.540
 ketchup of salt etc 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.600
 but little by little, you're going 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:57.570
 reduce these portions precisely from that 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.890
 ketchup cheese for the final 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.329
 really need it anymore 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.670
 personally it does that when I see 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:04.909
 we hang out and in early May the diet I 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.890
 would not even exist the weekend I 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:09.319
 plug the mouth gt but fold all 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.120
 the weekends and I was really eating 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:12.319
 but anything that does not suit me 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.480
 prevented from having a result like you 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:17.120
 see on the picture now here 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.220
 so the picture is after six months 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.379
 of that so I had taken it pretty much 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:24.500
 I took it where I think of 

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:26.750
 memory and I stay is pretty dry and that 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.950
 it's really the first year that 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.569
 you will be able to do something like 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.489
 that all to say that people 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:33.620
 who started bodybuilding from the 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:35.720
 moment the first year you go 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.280
 in room 3 4 times a week this is not 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.660
 do not start depriving yourself of everything and 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.310
 of nothing because it's after you go 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:42.200

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.599
