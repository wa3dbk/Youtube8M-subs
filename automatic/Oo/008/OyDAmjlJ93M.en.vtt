00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.069
 Friday the Latvia alley in November 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.150
 wanted to play against them what are you still 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.490
 at the start of the competition 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.679
 We then scored early because we were free 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.509
 quickly turned out to be the living apart type 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.890
 hit that match sept 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.250
 that was due to a statement from the 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.250
 national coach 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.019
 that was a different kind of tension or 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.119
 so for that match full of teak floor 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.560
 little strange tension but have that 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.269
 we think we were picked up then 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.399
 and we actually have it free 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.030
 easy match made by zo 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.030
 sharp start 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.239
 we had 6 0 then I thought and now 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.980
 of course they also have to win 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.530
 so cottage of course also showed up 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.510
 full is showing they go away follow 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.600
 for smartschool I use that kobo 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:54.750
 and six minutes and to also ran free 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.530
 quickly to 2 0 so yes scenario type 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.530
 bias 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:05.960
 cut four makes first goal for you 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.580
 I was a special corner of permanent suffering 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.890
 extended for pressure 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.600
 and I tick and how and how 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.650
 it actually went against it in the back 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.940
 the letter 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.619
 yes what b this was the better 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.369
 organized so it should definitely be after 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:18.259
 back to basics 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:20.750
 they are also planning for the coming Friday 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:23.390
 whoever may play it we must yes 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:25.580
 just learn from van of america that there is 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.530
 otherwise far too big where the 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.550
 limit for the fact car should definitely not 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.890
 happen more 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:33.320
 do you think it's now as an away match 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.759
 will be different than home game 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.220
 could just be so yes I do often 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:39.679
 also experience that teams have some teams 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:42.190
 who then play at home or play that out 

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:45.140
 but they do make a difference 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:47.660
 what it is about there actually it would be 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.380
 not having to decide but the stadium is playing 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:49.910
 anyway 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.830
 maybe one less fierce than I know 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:53.390
 not 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:55.580
 if you are one what things play a role 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.039
 what did you find the strong points and the 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.179
 some lesser sides of latvia 

00:01:57.039 --> 00:02:01.170
 partnership of course fully committed them 

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:03.360
 will go fightable 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.340
 18 are better with quality than that 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.110
 there you have to spend his blind 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.209
 do n't actually see it as an advantage 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.580
 of ado that this match after that 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:13.260
 practice game is coming 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.970
 well actually as an advantage because that 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.580
 practice match you obviously want that 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:20.130
 win and you want to play well well 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.690
 for your fans and for the people at home 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.950
 but it remains a practice game 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.190
 we can now market it well for it 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.190
 echie
