00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 there are very good guys welcome to a 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.299
 new video and we're in minecraft 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.820
 the box 360 with a new video tutorial 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:11.759
 I bring you today and this time it's something 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.730
 very curious as the title of the 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:18.180
 video is like having a backpack in 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.490
 minecraft of console or good of xbox 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.580
 playstation what they want without more 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.769
 clearly clearly desmottes and good 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:29.010
 as everyone already knows the under siege you 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:31.200
 are going to be the protagonists in this 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.800
 Many will know that when we break a 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:36.600
 under chest with a normal peak what 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.130
 is going to give us is obsidian is going to 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:43.900
 return the obsidian 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:48.370
 as you see here but if we break a chest 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:52.060
 to sell with a spike of silk touches 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:53.800
 to spend another little thing guys this chest 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:57.310
 we will not need it for now 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:01:01.180
 I'm going to break it like that, it only breaks 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:04.080
 you're worth it and here we're going to do a test 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:06.729
 let's save all these little things 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.010
 all these even these things that 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:10.870
 I have here in the inventory we are going to 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:14.920
 save everything we have and if 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:16.540
 we break a ndr chest with a pick 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.180
 any peak enchanted with touch 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.920
 silky 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:24.000
 what will happen is that we will 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:26.760
 return the chest but with the things that 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.790
 they are already inside as you see here the 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:33.150
 I 've already had a spike but I have the 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:35.760
 chest here has not broken me 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:38.369
 turning things around but things 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:41.280
 are stored inside if you want to go to 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:44.310
 explore but I have feeds the full of 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.860
 mineral stones and power objects can 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.720
 use this effective trick I do not know if many 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.460
 already know him I hope not because if 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.070
 I will not be doing this is in vain 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:59.369
 and simply put in his chest he quoted 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:59.369
 open and plan have their things here 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:04.600
 an experiment a little logical be if 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:06.190
 break this chest with a peak touches 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:09.100
 silk 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:12.460
 but it's something very ingenious and I hope that 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:14.320
 many many many do not know it and 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:16.240
