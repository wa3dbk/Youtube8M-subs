00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
see this looks like regular Android

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.640 
see this looks like regular Android
phones<00:00:28.170> like<00:00:28.650> nexus<00:00:29.580> s<00:00:29.789> like<00:00:30.449> live<00:00:30.779> tile<00:00:31.230> feed

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
phones like nexus s like live tile feed

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.130

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
so it's multiple colors you can't

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.299 
so it's multiple colors you can't
actually<00:00:34.290> click<00:00:34.710> them<00:00:34.860> like<00:00:35.040> on<00:00:35.190> a<00:00:35.219> real

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309

actually click them like on a real
android<00:00:36.120> phone<00:00:36.360> but<00:00:36.690> you<00:00:36.719> can<00:00:36.989> just<00:00:37.110> look<00:00:37.320> at

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
android phone but you can just look at

android phone but you can just look at
them<00:00:37.710> and<00:00:37.980> it's<00:00:38.610> not<00:00:38.760> like<00:00:38.879> a<00:00:38.910> video<00:00:39.300> feed<00:00:39.629> so

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
them and it's not like a video feed so

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.380 
them and it's not like a video feed so
it<00:00:39.930> won't<00:00:40.469> run<00:00:40.680> down<00:00:40.860> your<00:00:41.149> device's<00:00:42.149> battery
