00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.100
 Vorador, the reformed Sado-Hedonist (Sado = sadist) (hedonist = connoisseur) 

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:16.620
 I had met him before he became patriarch 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.520
 even then I did not know if I could trust him 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:26.340
 ah yes, the father of all vampires, who else should lead the resistance 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.649
 I'm honored to have Vorador save your false courtesies, Cain 

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:36.710
 but distress makes us allies alike, welcome to the sanctuary 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:43.080
 your old castle was more splendid, but I suppose we have to live with that 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.040
 it fulfills its purpose we have little time 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:51.620
 The Seraphans are becoming more powerful day by day, soon they have destroyed all our hiding places 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.890
 Once again we are faced with annihilation, that's what they thought before 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.710
 and you belied them you created a new race, 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.820
 something I would never have done and a little later, I had my army 

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:07.880
 Now we are split and at the end 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.380
 then do something, create new vampires 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.960
 It takes a lot of time and energy to create a vampire 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.899
 I'm not strong enough no, Umah has already told you 

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:23.850
 we have to kill Lord Serafan when he is dead, their power will dry up 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.060
 you have come a long way, Cain and you are our most important ally 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.460
 we have to prepare for our attack 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:34.740
 Vorador what is 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.999
 it's terrible, forgive me Lord Umah was captured, 

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:42.090
 as she has the main building in the industrial district 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.459
 searched, as you had commanded, I stood before the 

00:01:44.459 --> 00:01:46.899
 House, guard, she whispered to me that she was something 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:49.459
 important thing would have found 

00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:53.359
 no idea, before she could tell me, the seraphans discovered her, 

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:56.599
 I wanted to help her, but everywhere, I could not do anything 

00:01:56.599 --> 00:02:00.179
 they said they would bring Umah to the seraphim fortress, 

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:02.639
 to execute her no 

00:02:02.639 --> 00:02:05.990
 then they discovered me and I had to flee 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.740
 forgive me Vorador I must know what she has discovered 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:11.900
 we have to save her, especially life, Cain 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.480
 Yes of course 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.800
 I'm supposed to save her, then 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.720
 a vampire approaching the fortress would be discovered immediately 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:28.520
 but you can camouflage the main entrance of the fortress is heavily guarded, 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.019
 Speak to the Bishop of Meridian a bishop is on our side 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:37.919
 the prospect of immortality can be very convincing, especially for a bishop, 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.459
 whose faith in life after death is not very great 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.900
 the bishop knows a secret entrance to the fortress 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.200
 you find him, in the upper town tell him that I sent you, 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.760
 then he lets you into the fortress and when Umah is already dead 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:57.160
 then her discovery dies with her and with her, our hope 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.659
 Go now, Cain finds the bishop 

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:03.499
 You have Umah's life in hand, like all of us
