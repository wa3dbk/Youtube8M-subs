00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.540 
hey let's go right through enemy
territory<00:00:37.260> of<00:00:37.829> things<00:00:38.040> that's<00:00:38.190> going<00:00:38.370> to<00:00:38.460> try

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:44.030 
territory of things that's going to try
to<00:00:38.610> kill<00:00:38.820> us<00:00:39.500> up<00:00:41.660> best<00:00:42.660> strategy<00:00:43.230> for<00:00:43.260> lizards

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
to kill us up best strategy for lizards

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.680 
to kill us up best strategy for lizards
as<00:00:44.190> you<00:00:44.309> can<00:00:44.460> probably<00:00:44.760> see<00:00:44.969> these<00:00:45.300> jump

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
as you can probably see these jump

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.110 
as you can probably see these jump
attack<00:00:45.860> which<00:00:46.860> is<00:00:47.100> really<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.520> best<00:00:47.550> strategy

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
attack which is really the best strategy

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.139 
attack which is really the best strategy
for<00:00:48.149> almost<00:00:48.450> anything<00:00:49.550> but<00:00:50.550> especially<00:00:50.789> the

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
for almost anything but especially the

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.549 
for almost anything but especially the
lizards<00:00:51.420> because<00:00:51.660> about<00:00:51.809> fast<00:00:52.110> there<00:00:52.350> and

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
lizards because about fast there and

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:53.750 
lizards because about fast there and
they<00:00:52.620> can<00:00:52.770> get<00:00:52.890> behind<00:00:53.070> you<00:00:53.399> really<00:00:53.550> quickly

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
they can get behind you really quickly

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.850 
they can get behind you really quickly
and<00:00:54.059> since<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:54.840> jump<00:00:55.050> attack<00:00:55.170> homes<00:00:55.530> and<00:00:55.800> it

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
and since the jump attack homes and it

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.529 
and since the jump attack homes and it
doesn't<00:00:56.100> help<00:00:56.190> them<00:00:56.399> very<00:00:56.579> often<00:00:59.329> the<00:01:00.329> good

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
doesn't help them very often the good

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.720 
doesn't help them very often the good
thing<00:01:00.570> about<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:01.230> feed<00:01:01.949> attack<00:01:02.399> that<00:01:02.609> you

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
thing about the feed attack that you

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.759 
thing about the feed attack that you
have<00:01:02.910> is<00:01:03.149> you<00:01:03.750> only<00:01:03.870> have<00:01:04.110> to<00:01:04.229> use<00:01:04.409> it<00:01:04.559> for<00:01:04.589> a

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
have is you only have to use it for a

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.070 
have is you only have to use it for a
short<00:01:05.040> period<00:01:05.100> of<00:01:05.430> time<00:01:05.489> if<00:01:05.939> you<00:01:06.479> use<00:01:06.510> it<00:01:06.960> and

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
short period of time if you use it and

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.380 
short period of time if you use it and
get<00:01:07.200> knocked<00:01:07.530> back<00:01:07.710> it<00:01:08.250> will<00:01:08.460> still<00:01:08.790> kill<00:01:09.150> them

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
get knocked back it will still kill them

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.570 
get knocked back it will still kill them
I<00:01:09.600> just<00:01:10.170> don't<00:01:10.350> know<00:01:10.560> if<00:01:10.590> you<00:01:10.890> get<00:01:11.159> all<00:01:11.549> your

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
I just don't know if you get all your

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:21.469 
I just don't know if you get all your
health<00:01:11.970> back<00:01:19.490> so<00:01:20.490> like<00:01:20.640> I<00:01:20.729> mentioned<00:01:20.759> lizards

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
health back so like I mentioned lizards

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.570 
health back so like I mentioned lizards
are<00:01:21.570> pretty<00:01:21.750> tough<00:01:22.619> opponents<00:01:23.189> because<00:01:23.340> they

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
are pretty tough opponents because they

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.060 
are pretty tough opponents because they
can<00:01:23.869> like<00:01:24.869> quickly<00:01:25.290> get<00:01:25.439> behind<00:01:25.770> you<00:01:25.950> when

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
can like quickly get behind you when

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.149 
can like quickly get behind you when
they<00:01:26.189> can<00:01:26.310> also<00:01:26.460> block<00:01:26.909> which<00:01:27.659> is<00:01:27.990> a<00:01:28.560> bit<00:01:29.009> of

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
they can also block which is a bit of

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.289 
they can also block which is a bit of
dip<00:01:29.640> like<00:01:30.000> it's<00:01:30.420> kind<00:01:30.869> of<00:01:30.930> annoying<00:01:31.460> but<00:01:32.460> you

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
dip like it's kind of annoying but you

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.450 
dip like it's kind of annoying but you
know<00:01:33.420> you'll<00:01:34.259> eventually<00:01:34.439> find<00:01:34.710> a<00:01:35.100> really

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
know you'll eventually find a really

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.109 
know you'll eventually find a really
good<00:01:35.759> strategy<00:01:36.240> for<00:01:36.270> taking<00:01:36.630> care<00:01:36.659> of<00:01:36.840> them<00:01:37.110> I

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:38.119 
good strategy for taking care of them I

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:41.630 
good strategy for taking care of them I
could<00:01:39.119> probably<00:01:39.360> hit<00:01:39.720> see<00:01:40.140> and<00:01:40.409> use<00:01:40.740> like<00:01:41.250> my

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
could probably hit see and use like my

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.210 
could probably hit see and use like my
web<00:01:41.850> attack<00:01:42.570> on<00:01:42.840> them<00:01:43.320> to<00:01:43.530> like<00:01:43.649> stun<00:01:43.950> them<00:01:44.100> or

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
web attack on them to like stun them or

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.520 
web attack on them to like stun them or
something<00:01:44.570> but<00:01:45.570> I<00:01:45.630> don't<00:01:46.140> know<00:01:46.200> why<00:01:46.380> i<00:01:46.409> never

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
something but I don't know why i never

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.780 
something but I don't know why i never
use<00:01:46.920> that<00:01:46.950> I<00:01:47.369> assume<00:01:47.850> it's<00:01:48.030> useful<00:01:48.990> as<00:01:49.610> you<00:01:50.610> saw

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
use that I assume it's useful as you saw

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.870 
use that I assume it's useful as you saw
there<00:01:50.820> you<00:01:51.810> can't<00:01:52.079> always<00:01:52.320> feed<00:01:52.979> on<00:01:53.280> an<00:01:53.579> enemy

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
there you can't always feed on an enemy

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.910 
there you can't always feed on an enemy
sometimes<00:01:54.360> you<00:01:54.540> got<00:01:54.689> you<00:01:54.899> try<00:01:55.140> to<00:01:55.200> attack<00:01:55.619> them

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
sometimes you got you try to attack them

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.719 
sometimes you got you try to attack them
and<00:01:56.420> feed<00:01:57.420> on<00:01:57.600> them<00:01:57.719> and<00:01:57.899> will<00:01:58.110> knock<00:01:58.290> you<00:01:58.500> off

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
and feed on them and will knock you off

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:03.289 
and feed on them and will knock you off
so<00:02:00.200> you<00:02:01.200> can't<00:02:01.409> always<00:02:01.590> like<00:02:02.189> one<00:02:02.399> hit<00:02:02.579> KO<00:02:02.790> once

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
so you can't always like one hit KO once

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.990 
so you can't always like one hit KO once
they're<00:02:03.570> on<00:02:03.600> the<00:02:03.750> ground<00:02:04.579> but<00:02:05.579> I<00:02:05.640> did<00:02:05.790> get<00:02:05.939> a

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
they're on the ground but I did get a

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.370 
they're on the ground but I did get a
new<00:02:06.210> move<00:02:06.420> from<00:02:06.659> killing<00:02:06.960> the<00:02:07.049> lizards

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
new move from killing the lizards

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.889 
new move from killing the lizards

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
because apparently if you're a scorpion

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.580 
because apparently if you're a scorpion
or<00:02:10.110> spider<00:02:10.200> if<00:02:11.160> you<00:02:11.370> eat<00:02:11.940> another

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
or spider if you eat another

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.900 
or spider if you eat another
you'll<00:02:12.890> gain<00:02:13.040> their<00:02:13.250> abilities<00:02:15.879> oddly<00:02:16.879> enough

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
you'll gain their abilities oddly enough

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.740 
you'll gain their abilities oddly enough
the<00:02:17.300> power<00:02:17.510> is<00:02:17.750> to<00:02:17.930> crawl<00:02:18.500> on<00:02:18.530> ceilings<00:02:19.750> which

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
the power is to crawl on ceilings which

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.740 
the power is to crawl on ceilings which
I'm<00:02:20.959> somewhat<00:02:21.500> surprised<00:02:21.890> the<00:02:22.750> tarantula

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
I'm somewhat surprised the tarantula

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.640 
I'm somewhat surprised the tarantula
didn't<00:02:24.019> already<00:02:24.170> have<00:02:25.000> but<00:02:26.050> yeah<00:02:27.050> sure<00:02:27.410> I

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
didn't already have but yeah sure I

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.430 
didn't already have but yeah sure I
don't<00:02:28.340> remember<00:02:28.900> well<00:02:29.900> obviously<00:02:29.989> they

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
don't remember well obviously they

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.110 
don't remember well obviously they
wouldn't<00:02:30.650> have<00:02:30.739> had<00:02:30.920> sections<00:02:31.670> where<00:02:31.849> you<00:02:31.940> can

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
wouldn't have had sections where you can

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.970 
wouldn't have had sections where you can
crawl<00:02:32.390> in<00:02:32.510> the<00:02:32.599> ceiling<00:02:32.989> before<00:02:33.170> this<00:02:33.590> because

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
crawl in the ceiling before this because

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.190 
crawl in the ceiling before this because
there's<00:02:34.790> really<00:02:35.000> no<00:02:35.209> chance<00:02:35.900> for

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
there's really no chance for

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.250 
there's really no chance for
backtracking<00:02:36.799> this<00:02:37.220> game<00:02:37.840> since<00:02:38.840> once<00:02:39.140> you

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
backtracking this game since once you

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:49.960 
backtracking this game since once you
beat<00:02:39.500> a<00:02:40.060> chapter<00:02:41.060> you<00:02:41.239> can't<00:02:41.540> go<00:02:41.720> back<00:02:48.970> loading

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
beat a chapter you can't go back loading

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:57.670 
beat a chapter you can't go back loading
screens<00:02:55.510> I'm<00:02:56.510> not<00:02:56.630> sure<00:02:56.720> if<00:02:56.959> I<00:02:57.019> prefer<00:02:57.470> that

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
screens I'm not sure if I prefer that

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.460 
screens I'm not sure if I prefer that
they<00:02:57.860> have<00:02:58.150> loading<00:02:59.150> screens<00:02:59.599> compared<00:03:00.140> to

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
they have loading screens compared to

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:06.789 
they have loading screens compared to
like<00:03:01.690> separated<00:03:02.690> sections<00:03:03.019> or<00:03:03.620> not<00:03:03.890> I<00:03:05.799> guess

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:06.799 
like separated sections or not I guess

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:10.930 
like separated sections or not I guess
it<00:03:07.129> is<00:03:07.970> better<00:03:08.739> but<00:03:09.739> then<00:03:10.310> you<00:03:10.430> hit<00:03:10.549> a<00:03:10.579> loading

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
it is better but then you hit a loading

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.720 
it is better but then you hit a loading
screen<00:03:10.970> you<00:03:11.299> just<00:03:11.540> like<00:03:12.340> actually<00:03:13.340> add<00:03:13.489> is<00:03:13.700> a

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
screen you just like actually add is a

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:15.220 
screen you just like actually add is a
lot<00:03:13.970> better<00:03:14.239> I<00:03:14.450> don't<00:03:14.599> know<00:03:14.690> why<00:03:14.840> I<00:03:14.870> bothered

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
lot better I don't know why I bothered

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:18.400 
lot better I don't know why I bothered
saying<00:03:15.500> that<00:03:15.739> of<00:03:15.950> course<00:03:16.129> it's<00:03:16.340> better<00:03:16.519> I<00:03:17.410> mean

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410 
saying that of course it's better I mean

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:21.039 
saying that of course it's better I mean
is<00:03:19.370> that<00:03:19.430> a<00:03:19.549> dinosaur<00:03:20.180> we're<00:03:20.690> going<00:03:20.870> into

00:03:21.039 --> 00:03:21.049 
is that a dinosaur we're going into

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:24.220 
is that a dinosaur we're going into
dinosaur<00:03:21.680> territory<00:03:22.959> they<00:03:23.959> look<00:03:24.109> like

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.230 
dinosaur territory they look like

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:25.569 
dinosaur territory they look like
dinosaurs<00:03:24.769> but<00:03:24.950> that<00:03:25.100> doesn't<00:03:25.340> make<00:03:25.400> any

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:25.579 
dinosaurs but that doesn't make any

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:30.339 
dinosaurs but that doesn't make any
sense<00:03:26.829> they're<00:03:27.829> thorns<00:03:28.870> oddly<00:03:29.870> shaped<00:03:29.900> like

00:03:30.339 --> 00:03:30.349 
sense they're thorns oddly shaped like

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:36.039 
sense they're thorns oddly shaped like
dinosaurs<00:03:31.000> that's<00:03:32.000> weird<00:03:32.269> oh<00:03:34.720> this<00:03:35.720> is<00:03:35.930> our

boss ooh horny toad that's pretty cool

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:42.729 
boss ooh horny toad that's pretty cool

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:42.739 
it's not as big as the other bosses but

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:50.379 
it's not as big as the other bosses but
I<00:03:42.950> don't<00:03:43.340> know<00:03:43.870> um<00:03:45.220> it<00:03:46.220> blocks<00:03:46.790> and<00:03:49.209> does<00:03:50.209> not

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:50.389 
I don't know um it blocks and does not

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:56.080 
I don't know um it blocks and does not
get<00:03:50.780> it<00:03:50.930> hit<00:03:51.620> by<00:03:51.889> that<00:03:51.919> very<00:03:52.430> well<00:03:54.910> once<00:03:55.910> it's

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 
get it hit by that very well once it's

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:57.280 
get it hit by that very well once it's
like<00:03:56.269> that<00:03:56.450> there's<00:03:56.690> really<00:03:56.810> not<00:03:56.989> a<00:03:57.049> lot<00:03:57.139> you

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
like that there's really not a lot you

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:01.449 
like that there's really not a lot you
can<00:03:57.470> do<00:03:58.359> if<00:03:59.410> you<00:04:00.410> jump<00:04:00.799> attack<00:04:00.919> when<00:04:01.310> it's

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:01.459 
can do if you jump attack when it's

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:02.979 
can do if you jump attack when it's
running<00:04:01.669> or<00:04:02.000> if<00:04:02.060> you<00:04:02.150> attack<00:04:02.480> it<00:04:02.510> well<00:04:02.810> it's

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:02.989 
running or if you attack it well it's

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:06.240 
running or if you attack it well it's
like<00:04:03.290> running<00:04:03.620> or<00:04:03.889> moving<00:04:04.280> you<00:04:05.000> will<00:04:05.209> get<00:04:05.389> hurt

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
like running or moving you will get hurt

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.650 
like running or moving you will get hurt
you<00:04:07.250> have<00:04:07.400> to<00:04:07.519> hit<00:04:07.609> it<00:04:07.669> before<00:04:08.030> it<00:04:08.389> starts

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:08.660 
you have to hit it before it starts

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:12.069 
you have to hit it before it starts
moving<00:04:08.900> or<00:04:09.459> something<00:04:10.459> like<00:04:10.549> that<00:04:10.609> I<00:04:11.079> thought

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:12.079 
moving or something like that I thought

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:13.300 
moving or something like that I thought
I<00:04:12.139> was<00:04:12.200> pretty<00:04:12.410> much<00:04:12.530> screwed<00:04:12.919> when<00:04:13.160> that

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.310 
I was pretty much screwed when that

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:17.229 
I was pretty much screwed when that
happened<00:04:13.669> but<00:04:13.880> I<00:04:14.060> wasn't<00:04:14.299> surprisingly<00:04:16.239> as

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:17.239 
happened but I wasn't surprisingly as

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:19.089 
happened but I wasn't surprisingly as
you<00:04:17.810> can<00:04:17.930> see<00:04:18.079> it<00:04:18.200> doesn't<00:04:18.470> fall<00:04:18.620> on<00:04:18.650> its<00:04:18.859> back

00:04:19.089 --> 00:04:19.099 
you can see it doesn't fall on its back

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:20.979 
you can see it doesn't fall on its back
because<00:04:19.519> if<00:04:19.639> you<00:04:19.729> could<00:04:19.849> make<00:04:20.030> a<00:04:20.060> boss<00:04:20.450> fall<00:04:20.840> on

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:20.989 
because if you could make a boss fall on

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:22.690 
because if you could make a boss fall on
its<00:04:21.140> back<00:04:21.409> that<00:04:21.709> would<00:04:21.829> be<00:04:21.919> pretty<00:04:22.099> sad<00:04:22.400> since

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:22.700 
its back that would be pretty sad since

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:24.940 
its back that would be pretty sad since
you<00:04:22.849> can<00:04:23.000> just<00:04:23.150> eat<00:04:23.360> it

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:24.950 
you can just eat it

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:29.420 
you can just eat it
um<00:04:25.950> I<00:04:26.270> figured<00:04:27.270> that<00:04:27.540> after<00:04:27.840> i<00:04:28.530> saw<00:04:28.950> it<00:04:29.010> like

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
um I figured that after i saw it like

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.970 
um I figured that after i saw it like
fling<00:04:30.060> back<00:04:30.270> like<00:04:30.510> that<00:04:30.720> that<00:04:31.500> the<00:04:31.650> plan<00:04:31.950> was

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:31.980 
fling back like that that the plan was

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:34.400 
fling back like that that the plan was
to<00:04:32.580> make<00:04:32.730> it<00:04:32.820> fall<00:04:32.970> on<00:04:33.000> its<00:04:33.240> back<00:04:33.450> but<00:04:33.840> it<00:04:34.110> turns

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:34.410 
to make it fall on its back but it turns

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:39.770 
to make it fall on its back but it turns
out<00:04:34.620> but<00:04:35.010> that's<00:04:35.490> not<00:04:35.610> the<00:04:35.880> point<00:04:38.480> this<00:04:39.480> is<00:04:39.630> the

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
out but that's not the point this is the

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:43.960 
out but that's not the point this is the
first<00:04:40.020> boss<00:04:40.680> with<00:04:41.160> a<00:04:41.190> ranged<00:04:41.730> attack<00:04:42.120> and<00:04:42.830> as

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:43.970 
first boss with a ranged attack and as
