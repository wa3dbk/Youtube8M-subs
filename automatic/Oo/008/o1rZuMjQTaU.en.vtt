full-size<00:01:58.969> headphones<00:01:59.590> it<00:02:00.590> didn't<00:02:01.159> quite

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:01.369 
full-size headphones it didn't quite

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:04.660 
full-size headphones it didn't quite
have<00:02:01.670> the<00:02:01.700> push<00:02:02.179> to<00:02:02.869> make<00:02:03.020> it<00:02:03.200> all<00:02:03.350> the<00:02:03.500> way<00:02:03.670> so

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
have the push to make it all the way so

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.940 
have the push to make it all the way so
that<00:02:04.789> was<00:02:04.909> a<00:02:04.939> little<00:02:05.030> bit<00:02:05.210> of<00:02:05.299> a<00:02:05.420> downside<00:02:06.200> but

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
that was a little bit of a downside but

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.400 
that was a little bit of a downside but
I<00:02:07.250> you<00:02:07.640> know<00:02:07.789> it<00:02:08.750> really<00:02:08.869> takes<00:02:09.170> a<00:02:09.259> big

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
I you know it really takes a big

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.710 
I you know it really takes a big
amplifier<00:02:09.890> to<00:02:10.130> kind<00:02:10.310> of<00:02:10.369> push<00:02:10.610> the<00:02:10.789> big<00:02:10.970> high

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
amplifier to kind of push the big high

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.449 
amplifier to kind of push the big high
impedance<00:02:12.080> stuff<00:02:12.530> anyway<00:02:12.920> so<00:02:12.980> I<00:02:13.190> didn't

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
impedance stuff anyway so I didn't

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:14.979 
impedance stuff anyway so I didn't
really<00:02:13.610> expect<00:02:13.970> this<00:02:14.120> thing<00:02:14.180> to<00:02:14.360> but<00:02:14.630> it<00:02:14.750> also

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:14.989 
really expect this thing to but it also

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:19.710 
really expect this thing to but it also
does<00:02:15.349> a<00:02:15.739> line<00:02:16.370> level<00:02:16.640> output<00:02:17.269> for<00:02:18.170> your<00:02:18.260> stereo

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
does a line level output for your stereo

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.059 
does a line level output for your stereo
you<00:02:20.720> just<00:02:20.900> turn<00:02:21.080> the<00:02:21.170> volume<00:02:21.200> up<00:02:21.590> all<00:02:21.830> the<00:02:21.950> way

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:22.069 
you just turn the volume up all the way

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:26.949 
you just turn the volume up all the way
to<00:02:22.129> the<00:02:22.670> max<00:02:22.910> on<00:02:24.010> both<00:02:25.010> your<00:02:25.670> laptop<00:02:26.209> and<00:02:26.480> the

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 
to the max on both your laptop and the

to the max on both your laptop and the
device<00:02:27.470> volume<00:02:28.069> output<00:02:28.220> that's<00:02:28.849> kind<00:02:29.150> of<00:02:29.209> also

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:29.569 
device volume output that's kind of also

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:31.630 
device volume output that's kind of also
another<00:02:29.959> thing<00:02:30.230> I<00:02:30.440> want<00:02:30.620> to<00:02:30.739> touch<00:02:30.920> on<00:02:31.130> is<00:02:31.340> the

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
another thing I want to touch on is the

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.069 
another thing I want to touch on is the
there's<00:02:32.349> the<00:02:33.349> best<00:02:34.510> results<00:02:35.510> ourselves<00:02:35.989> when

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:36.079 
there's the best results ourselves when

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:37.330 
there's the best results ourselves when
the<00:02:36.170> volume<00:02:36.500> was<00:02:36.620> all<00:02:36.769> the<00:02:36.860> way<00:02:36.950> up<00:02:37.040> on<00:02:37.220> the

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
the volume was all the way up on the

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.870 
the volume was all the way up on the
computer<00:02:37.760> and<00:02:37.880> then<00:02:38.060> with<00:02:39.340> the<00:02:40.340> diff<00:02:40.640> you<00:02:40.760> had

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
computer and then with the diff you had

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.880 
computer and then with the diff you had
a<00:02:40.910> device<00:02:41.329> output<00:02:41.599> volume<00:02:42.170> you<00:02:42.260> can<00:02:42.410> adjust<00:02:42.739> it

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
a device output volume you can adjust it

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.270 
a device output volume you can adjust it
from<00:02:43.010> there<00:02:43.280> it's<00:02:44.030> incremental<00:02:44.390> and<00:02:45.280> stepped

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
from there it's incremental and stepped

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.819 
from there it's incremental and stepped
but<00:02:46.700> it's<00:02:46.849> done<00:02:47.060> in<00:02:47.269> the<00:02:47.450> analog<00:02:47.840> domain<00:02:47.989> not

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:48.829 
but it's done in the analog domain not

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:52.000 
but it's done in the analog domain not
the<00:02:49.040> digital<00:02:49.190> domain<00:02:50.019> so<00:02:51.019> a<00:02:51.049> lot<00:02:51.319> of<00:02:51.440> people

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
the digital domain so a lot of people

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.610 
the digital domain so a lot of people
think<00:02:52.190> that<00:02:52.310> that<00:02:52.489> really<00:02:53.239> contributes<00:02:53.930> to<00:02:54.590> a

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
think that that really contributes to a

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.319 
think that that really contributes to a
little<00:02:54.920> bit<00:02:55.040> better<00:02:55.130> sound<00:02:55.519> quality<00:02:56.030> which<00:02:56.180> is

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:56.329 
little bit better sound quality which is

00:02:56.329 --> 00:03:01.420 
little bit better sound quality which is
kind<00:02:56.810> of<00:02:56.840> a<00:02:56.930> nice<00:02:57.139> thing<00:02:57.730> I<00:02:59.980> happen<00:03:00.980> to<00:03:01.010> like<00:03:01.250> it

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
kind of a nice thing I happen to like it

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:03.940 
kind of a nice thing I happen to like it
a<00:03:01.519> lot<00:03:01.670> I<00:03:02.030> think<00:03:02.180> the<00:03:02.450> Sun<00:03:02.630> quality<00:03:02.840> was<00:03:03.230> really

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
a lot I think the Sun quality was really

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.030 
a lot I think the Sun quality was really
good<00:03:04.130> in<00:03:04.370> fact<00:03:04.579> this<00:03:05.480> thing<00:03:05.690> retails<00:03:06.049> for<00:03:06.170> 250

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
good in fact this thing retails for 250

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.940 
good in fact this thing retails for 250
dollars<00:03:07.069> and<00:03:07.850> for<00:03:08.120> 250<00:03:08.690> I<00:03:08.900> find<00:03:09.500> it<00:03:09.680> to<00:03:09.769> be

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
dollars and for 250 I find it to be

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.210 
dollars and for 250 I find it to be
above<00:03:10.579> par<00:03:11.030> in<00:03:11.420> its<00:03:11.870> output<00:03:12.290> it's<00:03:12.889> not<00:03:13.069> the

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
above par in its output it's not the

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.090 
above par in its output it's not the
best<00:03:13.370> i've<00:03:13.609> ever<00:03:13.730> heard<00:03:14.060> in<00:03:14.329> my<00:03:14.480> entire<00:03:14.510> life

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.100 
best i've ever heard in my entire life

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:18.550 
best i've ever heard in my entire life
there's<00:03:16.100> much<00:03:16.430> more<00:03:16.609> expensive<00:03:17.139> better<00:03:18.139> kind

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
there's much more expensive better kind

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.660 
there's much more expensive better kind
of<00:03:18.739> solutions<00:03:19.340> to<00:03:20.019> DAC<00:03:21.019> output<00:03:21.290> however<00:03:22.190> for

of solutions to DAC output however for

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:24.099 
of solutions to DAC output however for
what<00:03:22.760> it<00:03:22.880> was<00:03:23.030> in<00:03:23.269> the<00:03:23.359> sides<00:03:23.600> that<00:03:23.720> actually

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:24.109 
what it was in the sides that actually

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:25.800 
what it was in the sides that actually
outperformed<00:03:24.739> quite<00:03:24.950> a<00:03:24.980> few<00:03:25.280> of<00:03:25.400> the<00:03:25.459> other

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
outperformed quite a few of the other

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.500 
outperformed quite a few of the other
$250<00:03:26.810> decks<00:03:27.200> that<00:03:27.440> i've<00:03:27.590> heard<00:03:27.920> to<00:03:28.250> date<00:03:28.510> which

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
$250 decks that i've heard to date which

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.120 
$250 decks that i've heard to date which
is<00:03:29.660> really<00:03:30.049> great<00:03:30.290> thing<00:03:30.470> i<00:03:30.590> like<00:03:30.739> to<00:03:30.859> see<00:03:31.010> that

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.130 
is really great thing i like to see that

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:33.610 
is really great thing i like to see that
kind<00:03:31.310> of<00:03:31.430> price<00:03:32.150> to<00:03:32.389> performance<00:03:32.590> quality<00:03:33.590> a

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620 
kind of price to performance quality a

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:35.740 
kind of price to performance quality a
lot<00:03:33.920> and<00:03:34.280> there's<00:03:34.849> been<00:03:35.030> quite<00:03:35.060> a<00:03:35.359> bit<00:03:35.510> of<00:03:35.599> hype

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
lot and there's been quite a bit of hype

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:37.780 
lot and there's been quite a bit of hype
about<00:03:35.959> this<00:03:36.260> little<00:03:36.440> guy<00:03:36.680> and<00:03:37.040> i<00:03:37.190> do<00:03:37.400> think

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.790 
about this little guy and i do think

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:39.160 
about this little guy and i do think
that<00:03:37.849> it<00:03:38.060> kind<00:03:38.180> of<00:03:38.299> does<00:03:38.450> live<00:03:38.690> up<00:03:38.810> to<00:03:38.840> a<00:03:38.989> lot<00:03:39.139> of

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170 
that it kind of does live up to a lot of

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:40.960 
that it kind of does live up to a lot of
what<00:03:39.380> you<00:03:39.500> may<00:03:39.650> or<00:03:39.859> may<00:03:39.950> not<00:03:39.980> have<00:03:40.310> heard<00:03:40.579> the

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:40.970 
what you may or may not have heard the

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.330 
what you may or may not have heard the
quality<00:03:41.750> for<00:03:42.319> the<00:03:42.470> price<00:03:42.500> is<00:03:42.980> really

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
quality for the price is really

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:44.830 
quality for the price is really
something<00:03:43.730> that<00:03:43.760> i<00:03:43.880> think<00:03:44.000> a<00:03:44.239> lot<00:03:44.269> of<00:03:44.450> people

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
something that i think a lot of people

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:49.210 
something that i think a lot of people
can<00:03:45.620> get<00:03:45.739> into<00:03:45.950> along<00:03:46.730> those<00:03:47.060> same<00:03:47.090> lines<00:03:48.220> it's

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220 
can get into along those same lines it's

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.129 
can get into along those same lines it's
you<00:03:49.459> know<00:03:49.549> just<00:03:49.579> quite<00:03:50.329> the<00:03:50.480> metaphor<00:03:50.959> when

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:51.139 
you know just quite the metaphor when

00:03:51.139 --> 00:03:53.590 
you know just quite the metaphor when
you<00:03:51.230> plug<00:03:51.500> this<00:03:51.650> into<00:03:51.889> your<00:03:52.040> computer

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:53.600 
you plug this into your computer

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.440 
you plug this into your computer
and<00:03:53.860> at<00:03:54.860> least<00:03:55.010> with<00:03:55.190> my<00:03:55.340> macbook<00:03:55.820> air<00:03:56.030> there's

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:56.450 
and at least with my macbook air there's

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:58.930 
and at least with my macbook air there's
like<00:03:56.780> the<00:03:56.960> volume<00:03:57.190> headphone<00:03:58.190> input<00:03:58.370> here<00:03:58.760> and

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
like the volume headphone input here and

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:00.370 
like the volume headphone input here and
then<00:03:59.060> right<00:03:59.510> next<00:03:59.750> to<00:03:59.840> it<00:03:59.870> there's<00:04:00.080> another

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:00.380 
then right next to it there's another

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:02.530 
then right next to it there's another
volume<00:04:00.620> input<00:04:01.160> and<00:04:01.460> when<00:04:01.940> you<00:04:02.030> plug<00:04:02.300> it<00:04:02.420> in

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:02.540 
volume input and when you plug it in

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:04.330 
volume input and when you plug it in
back<00:04:02.900> and<00:04:03.080> forth<00:04:03.260> between<00:04:03.440> those<00:04:03.710> two<00:04:03.950> I<00:04:04.160> mean

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:04.340 
back and forth between those two I mean

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.430 
back and forth between those two I mean
you<00:04:04.460> notice<00:04:04.760> the<00:04:04.880> difference<00:04:05.270> it's<00:04:05.930> much<00:04:06.230> more

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440 
you notice the difference it's much more

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.640 
you notice the difference it's much more
balanced<00:04:07.040> I<00:04:07.460> find<00:04:08.000> a<00:04:08.060> lot<00:04:08.180> of<00:04:08.210> the<00:04:08.330> computer

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
balanced I find a lot of the computer

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:11.380 
balanced I find a lot of the computer
headphone<00:04:09.650> outputs<00:04:10.070> the<00:04:10.370> raw<00:04:10.730> ones<00:04:11.000> they<00:04:11.210> have

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:11.390 
headphone outputs the raw ones they have

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:14.230 
headphone outputs the raw ones they have
to<00:04:11.780> be<00:04:11.900> very<00:04:12.140> overly<00:04:12.620> bloated<00:04:13.160> bass<00:04:13.370> the<00:04:14.060> bass

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:14.240 
to be very overly bloated bass the bass

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:17.320 
to be very overly bloated bass the bass
is<00:04:14.450> much<00:04:14.810> much<00:04:15.110> tighter<00:04:15.500> and<00:04:15.830> the<00:04:16.790> clarity<00:04:17.239> is

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:17.330 
is much much tighter and the clarity is

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:20.199 
is much much tighter and the clarity is
just<00:04:17.540> there<00:04:17.720> so<00:04:18.050> if<00:04:18.620> you're<00:04:18.970> 250<00:04:19.970> dollars

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:30.830 
computer I mean there's something to be

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:32.380 
computer I mean there's something to be
said<00:04:30.860> in<00:04:31.130> that<00:04:31.190> if<00:04:31.340> you're<00:04:31.490> you<00:04:32.210> know<00:04:32.300> if

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:32.390 
said in that if you're you know if

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:33.940 
said in that if you're you know if
you're<00:04:32.570> in<00:04:32.750> tuning<00:04:33.110> your<00:04:33.260> monitors<00:04:33.740> this

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:33.950 
you're in tuning your monitors this

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:35.680 
you're in tuning your monitors this
thing<00:04:34.100> can<00:04:34.190> be<00:04:34.250> a<00:04:34.310> perfect<00:04:34.640> match<00:04:34.760> if<00:04:34.970> not<00:04:35.180> you

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:35.690 
thing can be a perfect match if not you

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:37.630 
thing can be a perfect match if not you
can<00:04:35.870> actually<00:04:36.020> take<00:04:36.380> this<00:04:36.560> thing<00:04:36.770> out<00:04:37.250> to<00:04:37.520> your

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:37.640 
can actually take this thing out to your

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:40.540 
can actually take this thing out to your
bigger<00:04:37.880> headphone<00:04:39.010> amplifier<00:04:40.010> if<00:04:40.250> that's<00:04:40.460> the

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:40.550 
bigger headphone amplifier if that's the

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:42.610 
bigger headphone amplifier if that's the
kind<00:04:40.670> of<00:04:40.790> thing<00:04:40.940> you<00:04:41.030> have<00:04:41.060> and<00:04:41.690> you'll<00:04:42.470> get

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:42.620 
kind of thing you have and you'll get

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:44.650 
kind of thing you have and you'll get
better<00:04:42.830> results<00:04:43.280> than<00:04:43.400> just<00:04:43.670> your<00:04:44.210> standard

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:44.660 
better results than just your standard

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:48.040 
better results than just your standard
output<00:04:45.050> so<00:04:45.430> there<00:04:46.430> is<00:04:46.580> value<00:04:46.820> to<00:04:47.270> this<00:04:47.420> whether

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.050 
output so there is value to this whether

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:50.080 
output so there is value to this whether
it's<00:04:48.260> worth<00:04:48.410> 250<00:04:48.770> that's<00:04:49.190> you<00:04:49.490> know<00:04:49.580> up<00:04:49.820> to<00:04:49.850> you

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:50.090 
it's worth 250 that's you know up to you

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:52.630 
it's worth 250 that's you know up to you
to<00:04:50.210> decide<00:04:50.600> but<00:04:50.630> I<00:04:50.900> do<00:04:51.050> think<00:04:51.710> that<00:04:51.800> there<00:04:52.490> is<00:04:52.610> a

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:52.640 
to decide but I do think that there is a

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:55.630 
to decide but I do think that there is a
definite<00:04:53.630> upgrade<00:04:53.930> in<00:04:54.620> the<00:04:54.740> sound<00:04:54.950> quality<00:04:55.460> so

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:55.640 
definite upgrade in the sound quality so

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:57.940 
definite upgrade in the sound quality so
that's<00:04:56.090> really<00:04:56.330> fun<00:04:56.420> I<00:04:56.690> kind<00:04:57.500> of<00:04:57.560> find<00:04:57.770> this<00:04:57.860> to

00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:57.950 
that's really fun I kind of find this to

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:01.300 
that's really fun I kind of find this to
be<00:04:57.980> a<00:04:58.100> nice<00:04:59.320> solid<00:05:00.320> observation<00:05:01.010> for<00:05:01.220> this

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:01.310 
be a nice solid observation for this

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:03.790 
be a nice solid observation for this
thing<00:05:01.460> I<00:05:01.580> mean<00:05:01.610> it's<00:05:02.330> something<00:05:03.320> even<00:05:03.560> maybe

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:03.800 
thing I mean it's something even maybe

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.590 
thing I mean it's something even maybe
your<00:05:04.010> non<00:05:04.220> audiophile<00:05:05.090> friends<00:05:05.450> might

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:05.600 
your non audiophile friends might

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:09.630 
your non audiophile friends might
recognize<00:05:06.080> which<00:05:06.350> would<00:05:06.500> be<00:05:06.590> kind<00:05:07.220> of<00:05:07.250> cool<00:05:07.510> so

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:09.640 
recognize which would be kind of cool so

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:12.910 
recognize which would be kind of cool so
that<00:05:10.640> being<00:05:10.820> said<00:05:11.200> you<00:05:12.200> know<00:05:12.320> this<00:05:12.740> is

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:12.920 
that being said you know this is

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:14.560 
that being said you know this is
something<00:05:13.130> if<00:05:13.700> you<00:05:13.790> get<00:05:13.910> the<00:05:14.060> chance<00:05:14.090> to<00:05:14.390> check

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:14.570 
something if you get the chance to check

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:16.810 
something if you get the chance to check
it<00:05:14.750> out<00:05:14.870> at<00:05:15.080> the<00:05:15.230> audio<00:05:15.530> shows<00:05:15.830> or<00:05:16.160> maybe<00:05:16.550> even

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:16.820
