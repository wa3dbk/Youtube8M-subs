00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
the bottle and sends the bottle spinning

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:46.680 
the bottle and sends the bottle spinning
flat<00:02:40.540> just<00:02:41.410> like<00:02:41.530> this<00:02:45.239> okay<00:02:46.239> so<00:02:46.330> that's<00:02:46.600> the

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
flat just like this okay so that's the

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:48.960 
flat just like this okay so that's the
first<00:02:46.930> thing<00:02:46.989> you<00:02:47.140> want<00:02:47.320> to<00:02:47.350> get<00:02:47.440> down<00:02:47.970> that's

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
first thing you want to get down that's

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.650 
first thing you want to get down that's
done<00:02:49.410> main<00:02:50.410> part<00:02:50.709> of<00:02:50.770> the<00:02:50.860> trick<00:02:51.070> right<00:02:51.250> there

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
done main part of the trick right there

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.550 
done main part of the trick right there
okay<00:02:52.660> so<00:02:52.720> that's<00:02:52.959> pretty<00:02:53.020> much<00:02:53.230> it<00:02:53.530> right

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
okay so that's pretty much it right

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.280 
okay so that's pretty much it right
there<00:02:53.890> it's<00:02:54.160> a<00:02:54.370> pretty<00:02:54.610> simple<00:02:54.970> move<00:02:55.360> it<00:02:56.020> just

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
there it's a pretty simple move it just

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.650 
there it's a pretty simple move it just
requires<00:02:56.709> a<00:02:57.340> little<00:02:57.730> finesse<00:02:58.090> to<00:02:58.120> get<00:02:58.450> this

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
requires a little finesse to get this

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.360 
requires a little finesse to get this
bottle<00:02:59.080> coming<00:02:59.410> up<00:02:59.530> flat<00:02:59.739> behind<00:03:00.100> your<00:03:00.220> back

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
bottle coming up flat behind your back

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.560 
bottle coming up flat behind your back
and<00:03:00.610> a<00:03:01.000> little<00:03:01.120> timing<00:03:01.720> so<00:03:02.080> that<00:03:02.110> you're

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 
and a little timing so that you're

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:07.229 
and a little timing so that you're
hitting<00:03:04.570> the<00:03:04.660> bottle<00:03:05.670> with<00:03:06.670> the<00:03:06.700> back<00:03:06.970> of<00:03:07.120> your

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239 
hitting the bottle with the back of your

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:14.430 
hitting the bottle with the back of your
arm<00:03:07.420> as<00:03:07.870> it<00:03:08.800> comes<00:03:09.100> up<00:03:10.020> just<00:03:11.020> like<00:03:11.200> that<00:03:13.410> so<00:03:14.410> now

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
arm as it comes up just like that so now

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:15.690 
arm as it comes up just like that so now
what<00:03:14.860> we're<00:03:14.980> going<00:03:15.070> to<00:03:15.130> do<00:03:15.280> is<00:03:15.400> we're<00:03:15.520> going<00:03:15.550> to

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
what we're going to do is we're going to

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.150 
what we're going to do is we're going to
incorporate<00:03:15.970> the<00:03:16.390> tin<00:03:16.709> and<00:03:17.709> we're<00:03:17.890> going<00:03:18.100> to

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.250 
incorporate the tin and we're going to
land<00:03:19.030> the<00:03:19.120> bottle<00:03:19.510> on<00:03:19.660> the<00:03:19.690> tin<00:03:20.050> and<00:03:20.170> it's

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
land the bottle on the tin and it's

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.640 
land the bottle on the tin and it's
going<00:03:20.410> to<00:03:20.470> continue<00:03:20.709> spinning<00:03:21.780> at<00:03:22.780> this<00:03:23.230> point

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
going to continue spinning at this point

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:26.190 
going to continue spinning at this point
I<00:03:23.860> would<00:03:24.130> like<00:03:24.190> to<00:03:24.550> enter<00:03:25.330> a<00:03:25.360> word<00:03:25.690> of<00:03:25.930> caution

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:44.140 
risk that the bottle could fly into the

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:46.150

this trick because if that happens at
work<00:03:57.230> it's<00:03:57.470> going<00:03:57.590> to<00:03:57.650> be<00:03:57.740> kind<00:03:57.980> of

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.040

top<00:04:45.110> or<00:04:45.800> the<00:04:45.860> bottom<00:04:46.190> of<00:04:46.490> the<00:04:46.550> tin<00:04:46.760> whichever

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:47.150 
top or the bottom of the tin whichever

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:52.900 
top or the bottom of the tin whichever
you're<00:04:47.390> comfortable<00:04:51.340> just<00:04:52.340> like<00:04:52.520> that

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:52.910 
you're comfortable just like that

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:59.520 
you're comfortable just like that
okay<00:04:53.480> let's<00:04:53.990> try<00:04:54.140> one<00:04:54.320> more<00:04:54.350> just<00:04:57.640> like<00:04:58.640> that

00:04:59.520 --> 00:04:59.530 
okay let's try one more just like that

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:02.470 
okay let's try one more just like that
so<00:05:00.530> it's<00:05:00.980> a<00:05:01.070> pretty<00:05:01.250> simple<00:05:01.490> trick<00:05:01.910> the<00:05:02.300> main

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:02.480 
so it's a pretty simple trick the main

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:04.720 
so it's a pretty simple trick the main
thing<00:05:02.720> that<00:05:02.750> you<00:05:03.020> need<00:05:03.170> to<00:05:03.260> get<00:05:03.380> down<00:05:03.590> is<00:05:03.920> this

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:04.730 
thing that you need to get down is this

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:11.710 
thing that you need to get down is this
move<00:05:05.350> right<00:05:06.350> then<00:05:08.350> that<00:05:09.350> elbow<00:05:09.800> bone<00:05:10.720> once

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:11.720 
move right then that elbow bone once

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:13.510 
move right then that elbow bone once
you've<00:05:11.870> got<00:05:12.050> that<00:05:12.260> down<00:05:12.500> you're<00:05:13.160> not<00:05:13.340> going<00:05:13.460> to

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:13.520 
you've got that down you're not going to

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:16.840 
you've got that down you're not going to
have<00:05:13.640> a<00:05:13.670> problem<00:05:14.290> getting<00:05:15.290> the<00:05:15.410> ball<00:05:15.830> to<00:05:16.220> lay

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:22.780 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:26.740
