00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:38.810 
I'm going to get a hoverball on this

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:41.590 
I'm going to get a hoverball on this
turn<00:04:39.110> the<00:04:39.380> ball<00:04:39.590> go<00:04:39.950> pause<00:04:40.540> redirect<00:04:41.540> your

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:41.600 
turn the ball go pause redirect your

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:51.220 
turn the ball go pause redirect your
ball<00:04:41.990> with<00:04:42.470> a<00:04:42.650> new<00:04:43.250> direction<00:04:43.490> aku<00:04:44.419> go<00:04:45.320> next

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:51.230

game that's like a racing game I don't
really<00:05:12.240> know<00:05:12.510> how<00:05:12.540> that<00:05:13.169> one<00:05:13.410> works<00:05:13.650> but<00:05:14.340> it

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:14.610 
really know how that one works but it

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:17.629 
really know how that one works but it
also<00:05:15.360> i<00:05:15.660> think<00:05:16.080> you<00:05:16.590> you<00:05:16.830> you<00:05:17.070> also<00:05:17.430> use<00:05:17.610> your

00:05:17.629 --> 00:05:17.639 
also i think you you you also use your

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:20.810 
also i think you you you also use your
phone<00:05:18.380> yeah<00:05:19.380> but<00:05:20.010> i<00:05:20.100> don't<00:05:20.160> know<00:05:20.340> how<00:05:20.400> it<00:05:20.580> is

you see a different different way over

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:36.670 
you see a different different way over
here<00:05:35.360> like<00:05:35.510> you<00:05:35.630> see<00:05:35.810> over<00:05:36.020> here<00:05:36.050> you<00:05:36.350> can<00:05:36.530> see

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:36.680 
here like you see over here you can see

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:39.100 
here like you see over here you can see
players<00:05:37.419> every<00:05:38.419> player<00:05:38.630> would<00:05:38.900> have<00:05:38.930> a

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:39.110 
players every player would have a

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:43.030 
players every player would have a
different<00:05:39.380> color<00:05:41.110> okay<00:05:42.110> like<00:05:42.440> you<00:05:42.770> can<00:05:42.889> see

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:43.040 
different color okay like you can see

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:45.010 
different color okay like you can see
I'm<00:05:43.220> playing<00:05:43.250> terrible<00:05:43.910> it's<00:05:44.419> not<00:05:44.570> easy<00:05:44.750> to
