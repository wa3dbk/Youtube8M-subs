00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
episodes of Doctor Who were fantastic I

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.040 
episodes of Doctor Who were fantastic I
particularly<00:02:38.760> loved<00:02:39.180> to<00:02:39.330> the<00:02:39.450> marriage<00:02:39.660> scene

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
but I was a little bit disappointed that

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.420 
but I was a little bit disappointed that
we<00:02:42.900> didn't<00:02:43.110> get<00:02:43.200> to<00:02:43.410> see<00:02:43.650> more<00:02:43.890> of<00:02:43.920> the<00:02:44.070> actors

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
we didn't get to see more of the actors

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.280 
we didn't get to see more of the actors
who<00:02:44.580> had<00:02:44.700> portrayed<00:02:45.030> the<00:02:45.420> doctor<00:02:45.780> in<00:02:45.930> his<00:02:46.020> past

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
who had portrayed the doctor in his past

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:47.270

regenerations

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.340 
regenerations
it<00:02:47.850> kind<00:02:48.150> of<00:02:48.240> felt<00:02:48.600> more<00:02:48.840> like<00:02:48.990> a<00:02:49.050> celebration

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
it kind of felt more like a celebration

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:52.220 
it kind of felt more like a celebration
of<00:02:49.830> new<00:02:50.100> home<00:02:50.460> and<00:02:50.870> considering<00:02:51.870> this<00:02:51.990> was<00:02:52.200> a

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
of new home and considering this was a

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.410 
of new home and considering this was a
celebration<00:02:52.770> of<00:02:53.160> 50<00:02:53.430> years<00:02:53.640> of<00:02:53.910> Doctor<00:02:54.270> Who

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
celebration of 50 years of Doctor Who

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:55.790 
celebration of 50 years of Doctor Who
that<00:02:54.750> didn't<00:02:54.990> really<00:02:55.140> seem<00:02:55.350> fair<00:02:55.620> to<00:02:55.650> me

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
that didn't really seem fair to me

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.460 
that didn't really seem fair to me
another<00:02:56.790> plus<00:02:57.090> though<00:02:57.420> is<00:02:57.720> that<00:02:58.020> I<00:02:58.050> really

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
another plus though is that I really

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.010 
another plus though is that I really
loved<00:02:58.650> Clara<00:02:58.950> in<00:02:59.190> this<00:02:59.310> episode<00:02:59.730> Clara<00:03:00.630> was<00:03:00.900> an
