00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
have a different gun at any point in the

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.569 
have a different gun at any point in the
game<00:01:27.360> like<00:01:27.780> that<00:01:28.080> guy<00:01:28.229> just<00:01:28.290> had<00:01:28.530> a<00:01:28.560> shotgun<00:01:28.829> if

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
game like that guy just had a shotgun if

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.039 
game like that guy just had a shotgun if
he<00:01:29.729> had<00:01:29.939> like<00:01:30.180> any<00:01:30.390> other<00:01:30.600> kind<00:01:30.720> of<00:01:30.840> gun<00:01:31.020> I

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
he had like any other kind of gun I

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.090 
he had like any other kind of gun I
probably<00:01:31.380> would've<00:01:31.619> been<00:01:31.650> a<00:01:31.740> look<00:01:31.950> at<00:01:32.009> the

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
probably would've been a look at the

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.090 
probably would've been a look at the
kill<00:01:32.310> on<00:01:32.340> him<00:01:32.869> but<00:01:33.869> someone<00:01:34.259> fired<00:01:34.500> behind<00:01:34.890> me

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
kill on him but someone fired behind me

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.429 
kill on him but someone fired behind me
and<00:01:35.310> gave<00:01:36.119> away<00:01:36.360> their<00:01:36.570> position<00:01:36.750> so<00:01:37.170> i<00:01:37.200> think

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
and gave away their position so i think

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:38.780 
and gave away their position so i think
he<00:01:37.530> was<00:01:37.619> honestly<00:01:37.950> going<00:01:38.040> around<00:01:38.340> behind<00:01:38.549> them

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
he was honestly going around behind them

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.710 
he was honestly going around behind them
but

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:41.720 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.050 

yeah<00:01:42.500> I<00:01:42.740> don't<00:01:42.980> know<00:01:43.070> maybe<00:01:43.430> it's<00:01:43.580> just<00:01:43.730> cuz<00:01:43.910> it

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
yeah I don't know maybe it's just cuz it

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.030

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
update where it now you start off with a

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.640 
update where it now you start off with a
shotgun<00:02:34.880> and<00:02:35.420> in<00:02:35.750> the<00:02:35.900> middle<00:02:36.140> that's<00:02:36.440> when

shotgun and in the middle that's when

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.470 
shotgun and in the middle that's when
you<00:02:36.770> start<00:02:37.070> with<00:02:37.190> pistols<00:02:37.700> to<00:02:37.970> the<00:02:38.090> money<00:02:38.360> is

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
you start with pistols to the money is

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.930 
you start with pistols to the money is
right<00:02:38.750> there<00:02:38.959> let<00:02:39.110> the<00:02:39.200> recoil<00:02:39.620> the<00:02:40.220> m14<00:02:40.760> get

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
right there let the recoil the m14 get

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:42.970 
right there let the recoil the m14 get
the<00:02:41.030> better<00:02:41.180> of<00:02:41.270> me<00:02:41.420> and<00:02:41.930> I<00:02:42.380> paid<00:02:42.709> the<00:02:42.830> price

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
the better of me and I paid the price

for<00:02:43.040> it<00:02:43.370> but<00:02:43.910> I<00:02:44.150> think<00:02:44.570> would<00:02:44.630> be<00:02:44.750> awesome<00:02:45.110> if

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
for it but I think would be awesome if

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.580 
for it but I think would be awesome if
they<00:02:45.380> if<00:02:45.650> they<00:02:45.800> did<00:02:45.950> a<00:02:45.980> random<00:02:46.370> gun<00:02:47.090> game<00:02:47.590> where

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:40.850 
supporting like halo 3 changing things
weekly<00:03:38.910> and<00:03:39.090> everything<00:03:39.860> really

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:40.860 
weekly and everything really

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:42.650 
weekly and everything really
experimenting<00:03:41.670> with<00:03:41.730> their<00:03:41.970> game<00:03:42.150> I<00:03:42.420> don't

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
experimenting with their game I don't

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:46.870 
experimenting with their game I don't
expect<00:03:42.960> that<00:03:43.350> to<00:03:43.410> happen<00:03:43.560> but<00:03:44.160> if<00:03:45.830> something

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:46.880 
expect that to happen but if something

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.250 
expect that to happen but if something
similar<00:03:47.880> could<00:03:48.420> happen<00:03:48.780> I<00:03:48.840> don't<00:03:48.870> know<00:03:49.050> it

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
similar could happen I don't know it

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.320 
similar could happen I don't know it
just<00:03:49.560> to<00:03:50.070> keep<00:03:50.220> the<00:03:50.340> game<00:03:50.490> forbidden<00:03:50.970> to<00:03:51.150> miss

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:51.330 
just to keep the game forbidden to miss

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:53.930 
just to keep the game forbidden to miss
Dale<00:03:51.600> I<00:03:52.290> think<00:03:53.040> would<00:03:53.100> be<00:03:53.220> really<00:03:53.250> sweet<00:03:53.610> I

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
Dale I think would be really sweet I

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:55.760 
Dale I think would be really sweet I
noticed<00:03:54.540> that<00:03:54.600> the<00:03:54.870> hardest<00:03:55.260> part<00:03:55.410> I<00:03:55.560> have

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:55.770 
noticed that the hardest part I have

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:57.940 
noticed that the hardest part I have
with<00:03:56.040> the<00:03:56.160> gun<00:03:56.340> game<00:03:56.610> is<00:03:56.880> the<00:03:57.090> sniper<00:03:57.360> rifles

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:57.950 
with the gun game is the sniper rifles

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:01.790 
with the gun game is the sniper rifles
this<00:03:58.950> was<00:03:59.220> on<00:03:59.400> Nuketown<00:03:59.880> and<00:04:00.470> so<00:04:01.470> there's<00:04:01.680> not

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:01.800 
this was on Nuketown and so there's not

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.740 
this was on Nuketown and so there's not
very<00:04:01.860> many<00:04:02.160> sniper<00:04:02.850> angles<00:04:03.360> or<00:04:03.480> anything<00:04:03.720> like

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
very many sniper angles or anything like

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.480 
very many sniper angles or anything like
that<00:04:03.860> especially<00:04:04.860> where<00:04:05.220> you<00:04:05.280> don't<00:04:05.340> have

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:05.490 
that especially where you don't have

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:07.340 
that especially where you don't have
claymores<00:04:06.180> to<00:04:06.360> watch<00:04:06.510> your<00:04:06.690> back<00:04:06.900> if<00:04:07.170> you<00:04:07.260> were

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:07.350 
claymores to watch your back if you were

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:08.570 
claymores to watch your back if you were
gonna<00:04:07.470> go<00:04:07.680> hide<00:04:07.830> up<00:04:08.010> in<00:04:08.100> the<00:04:08.190> house<00:04:08.340> or

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:08.580 
gonna go hide up in the house or

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:10.610 
gonna go hide up in the house or
something<00:04:08.730> but<00:04:09.090> I<00:04:09.300> figured<00:04:10.290> the<00:04:10.350> best<00:04:10.500> place

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
something but I figured the best place

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.980 
something but I figured the best place
to<00:04:10.980> hang<00:04:11.580> out<00:04:11.760> was<00:04:11.880> just<00:04:11.910> lay<00:04:12.210> in<00:04:12.360> the<00:04:12.450> back<00:04:12.630> of

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:12.990 
to hang out was just lay in the back of

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:14.990 
to hang out was just lay in the back of
the<00:04:13.350> grass<00:04:13.590> here<00:04:13.980> and<00:04:14.190> wait<00:04:14.520> for<00:04:14.550> someone<00:04:14.880> to

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
the grass here and wait for someone to

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:22.520 
the grass here and wait for someone to
come<00:04:15.980> fuck<00:04:16.980> around<00:04:17.460> which<00:04:17.790> I<00:04:20.630> actually<00:04:21.630> get

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:22.530 
come fuck around which I actually get

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:26.540 
come fuck around which I actually get
this<00:04:22.770> kill<00:04:24.320> then<00:04:25.320> I<00:04:25.470> die<00:04:25.530> and<00:04:26.190> I'm<00:04:26.370> going<00:04:26.520> to

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
this kill then I die and I'm going to

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:28.130 
this kill then I die and I'm going to
come<00:04:26.760> back<00:04:26.790> in<00:04:26.970> and<00:04:27.360> I'm<00:04:27.450> gonna<00:04:27.570> get<00:04:27.810> knifed

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:28.140 
come back in and I'm gonna get knifed

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:29.840 
come back in and I'm gonna get knifed
before<00:04:28.650> I<00:04:28.680> can<00:04:28.830> get<00:04:28.920> another<00:04:29.070> kill<00:04:29.460> so<00:04:29.610> I<00:04:29.640> have

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:29.850 
before I can get another kill so I have

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:32.090 
before I can get another kill so I have
to<00:04:29.940> go<00:04:30.060> back<00:04:30.330> to<00:04:30.660> the<00:04:30.690> w<00:04:31.050> 18,000<00:04:31.740> and<00:04:31.830> that<00:04:32.010> was

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:32.100 
to go back to the w 18,000 and that was

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:33.580 
to go back to the w 18,000 and that was
the<00:04:32.220> last<00:04:32.250> thing<00:04:32.670> that<00:04:32.730> I<00:04:32.880> wanted<00:04:33.150> to<00:04:33.210> happen

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:33.590 
the last thing that I wanted to happen

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:36.530 
the last thing that I wanted to happen
cuz<00:04:34.590> like<00:04:34.980> i<00:04:35.130> said<00:04:35.370> before<00:04:35.670> i'm<00:04:36.000> not<00:04:36.210> i'm<00:04:36.480> not

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:36.540 
cuz like i said before i'm not i'm not

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:40.190 
cuz like i said before i'm not i'm not
the<00:04:36.840> best<00:04:36.990> with<00:04:37.260> uh<00:04:38.030> with<00:04:39.030> the<00:04:39.420> sniper<00:04:39.720> rifles

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:40.200 
the best with uh with the sniper rifles

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.230 
the best with uh with the sniper rifles
especially<00:04:40.680> on<00:04:40.770> Nuketown<00:04:41.070> and<00:04:41.310> in<00:04:41.610> a<00:04:41.670> kinda

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 
especially on Nuketown and in a kinda

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.240 
especially on Nuketown and in a kinda
like<00:04:42.690> I've<00:04:42.810> never<00:04:42.960> quick<00:04:43.290> scoped<00:04:43.620> before<00:04:44.040> I've

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.250 
like I've never quick scoped before I've

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:45.980 
like I've never quick scoped before I've
never<00:04:44.280> really<00:04:44.520> been<00:04:45.000> one<00:04:45.240> to<00:04:45.540> worry<00:04:45.780> about

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:45.990 
never really been one to worry about

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:49.250 
never really been one to worry about
quickscoping<00:04:47.330> but<00:04:48.330> in<00:04:48.570> a<00:04:48.660> situation<00:04:48.870> like

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:49.260 
quickscoping but in a situation like

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:50.980 
quickscoping but in a situation like
this<00:04:49.440> it<00:04:49.830> would<00:04:49.980> actually<00:04:50.130> be<00:04:50.340> really<00:04:50.460> nice<00:04:50.880> to

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:50.990 
this it would actually be really nice to

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:55.430 
this it would actually be really nice to
be<00:04:52.250> able<00:04:53.250> to<00:04:53.520> quickscope<00:04:54.000> just<00:04:54.330> the<00:04:55.080> way<00:04:55.230> they

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.440 
be able to quickscope just the way they

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.530 
be able to quickscope just the way they
gimped<00:04:55.800> it<00:04:55.890> with<00:04:56.040> the<00:04:56.220> the<00:04:56.430> randomization<00:04:57.240> of

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:57.540 
gimped it with the the randomization of

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:59.840 
gimped it with the the randomization of
the<00:04:58.170> crosshairs<00:04:58.920> and<00:04:59.010> stuff<00:04:59.340> it<00:04:59.520> makes<00:04:59.640> it

00:04:59.840 --> 00:04:59.850 
the crosshairs and stuff it makes it

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:02.360 
the crosshairs and stuff it makes it
really<00:04:59.970> hard<00:05:00.060> in<00:05:00.540> a<00:05:00.690> gun<00:05:01.350> game<00:05:01.650> like<00:05:01.890> this<00:05:02.070> to

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:02.370 
really hard in a gun game like this to

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:06.470 
really hard in a gun game like this to
get<00:05:02.880> the<00:05:03.030> shots<00:05:03.270> off<00:05:04.640> consistently<00:05:05.640> and<00:05:05.970> how

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:06.480 
get the shots off consistently and how

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:08.390 
get the shots off consistently and how
you<00:05:06.540> need<00:05:06.810> them<00:05:07.020> but<00:05:07.290> it's<00:05:07.980> the<00:05:08.100> same<00:05:08.220> for

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:08.400 
you need them but it's the same for

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:12.559 
you need them but it's the same for
everyone<00:05:08.610> so<00:05:08.970> I<00:05:09.210> guess<00:05:09.480> it's<00:05:09.660> still<00:05:09.840> fair

00:05:12.559 --> 00:05:12.569 

00:05:12.569 --> 00:05:14.419 

I<00:05:12.629> have<00:05:13.439> a<00:05:13.499> hard<00:05:13.679> time<00:05:13.800> with<00:05:13.949> the<00:05:14.039> launchers

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:14.429 
I have a hard time with the launchers

00:05:14.429 --> 00:05:18.469 
I have a hard time with the launchers
too<00:05:14.610> cuz<00:05:14.849> they<00:05:14.939> take<00:05:15.119> so<00:05:15.330> long<00:05:15.539> to<00:05:17.240> get<00:05:18.240> working

00:05:18.469 --> 00:05:18.479 
too cuz they take so long to get working

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:22.189 
too cuz they take so long to get working
and<00:05:19.069> the<00:05:20.069> cool<00:05:20.279> thing<00:05:20.309> to<00:05:20.550> about<00:05:21.080> about<00:05:22.080> the

00:05:22.189 --> 00:05:22.199 
and the cool thing to about about the

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:24.379 
and the cool thing to about about the
gun<00:05:22.409> game<00:05:22.649> is<00:05:22.949> it's<00:05:23.459> like<00:05:23.580> a<00:05:23.610> free-for-all<00:05:23.909> so

00:05:24.379 --> 00:05:24.389 
gun game is it's like a free-for-all so

00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:26.469 
gun game is it's like a free-for-all so
if<00:05:24.509> you<00:05:24.599> die<00:05:24.839> a<00:05:24.869> lot<00:05:25.110> you're<00:05:25.379> not<00:05:25.499> necessarily

00:05:26.469 --> 00:05:26.479 
if you die a lot you're not necessarily

00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:28.639 
if you die a lot you're not necessarily
automatically<00:05:27.479> losing<00:05:27.899> life<00:05:28.080> it<00:05:28.289> as<00:05:28.379> a<00:05:28.409> team

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:28.649 
automatically losing life it as a team

00:05:28.649 --> 00:05:31.070 
automatically losing life it as a team
deathmatch<00:05:29.069> like<00:05:29.339> you<00:05:29.429> could<00:05:29.610> die<00:05:30.080> did

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:31.080 
deathmatch like you could die did

didn't work but you can die a whole
bunch<00:05:35.789> of<00:05:35.939> times<00:05:36.119> and<00:05:36.300> you're<00:05:36.449> not<00:05:36.569> as<00:05:36.809> long<00:05:36.929> as

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:37.080 
bunch of times and you're not as long as

you're spreading out who you're dying to
it's<00:05:38.580> not<00:05:38.729> necessarily<00:05:39.300> losing<00:05:40.199> the<00:05:40.259> game<00:05:40.439> for

00:05:40.489 --> 00:05:40.499 
it's not necessarily losing the game for

00:05:40.499 --> 00:05:44.089 
it's not necessarily losing the game for
you<00:05:40.909> of<00:05:41.909> course<00:05:42.240> it's<00:05:42.479> I<00:05:42.749> mean<00:05:43.020> if<00:05:43.139> you<00:05:43.259> die

00:05:44.089 --> 00:05:44.099 
you of course it's I mean if you die

00:05:44.099 --> 00:05:46.010 
you of course it's I mean if you die
consistently<00:05:44.759> in<00:05:44.879> gunfights<00:05:45.509> and<00:05:45.659> that's<00:05:45.839> one

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:46.020 
consistently in gunfights and that's one

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:49.699 
consistently in gunfights and that's one
thing<00:05:46.199> but<00:05:46.259> I<00:05:46.819> know<00:05:48.169> I'm<00:05:49.169> having<00:05:49.439> a<00:05:49.499> great<00:05:49.589> time

00:05:49.699 --> 00:05:49.709 
thing but I know I'm having a great time

00:05:49.709 --> 00:05:53.619 
thing but I know I'm having a great time
with<00:05:50.009> this<00:05:50.099> game<00:05:50.309> so<00:05:50.550> far<00:05:51.919> the<00:05:52.919> wager<00:05:53.249> matches

00:05:53.619 --> 00:05:53.629 
with this game so far the wager matches

00:05:53.629 --> 00:05:57.019 
with this game so far the wager matches
are<00:05:54.629> interesting<00:05:55.289> I<00:05:55.499> don't<00:05:56.009> necessarily<00:05:56.339> like

00:05:57.019 --> 00:05:57.029 
are interesting I don't necessarily like

00:05:57.029 --> 00:05:59.389 
are interesting I don't necessarily like
one<00:05:57.689> the<00:05:57.839> chamber<00:05:58.259> yet<00:05:58.409> because<00:05:58.830> it<00:05:58.979> turns<00:05:59.189> out

00:05:59.389 --> 00:05:59.399 
one the chamber yet because it turns out

00:05:59.399 --> 00:06:02.420 
one the chamber yet because it turns out
that<00:06:00.199> like<00:06:01.199> I<00:06:01.409> was<00:06:01.529> the<00:06:01.619> last<00:06:01.740> one<00:06:01.889> to<00:06:02.009> survive

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:02.430 
that like I was the last one to survive

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:05.359 
that like I was the last one to survive
but<00:06:02.849> I<00:06:02.909> didn't<00:06:03.270> get<00:06:03.330> the<00:06:03.449> most<00:06:03.629> kills<00:06:03.959> like<00:06:04.860> I<00:06:04.979> I

00:06:05.359 --> 00:06:05.369 
but I didn't get the most kills like I I

00:06:05.369 --> 00:06:08.659 
but I didn't get the most kills like I I
think<00:06:05.819> the<00:06:05.939> two<00:06:06.119> I<00:06:06.300> placed<00:06:06.569> third<00:06:07.519> the<00:06:08.519> first

00:06:08.659 --> 00:06:08.669 
think the two I placed third the first

00:06:08.669 --> 00:06:10.369 
think the two I placed third the first
and<00:06:08.879> second<00:06:09.149> got<00:06:09.269> five<00:06:09.449> kills<00:06:09.779> and<00:06:09.959> I<00:06:09.990> got<00:06:10.139> four

00:06:10.369 --> 00:06:10.379 
and second got five kills and I got four

00:06:10.379 --> 00:06:13.009 
and second got five kills and I got four
kills<00:06:10.649> or<00:06:10.800> something<00:06:11.009> like<00:06:11.069> that<00:06:11.129> and<00:06:11.429> I<00:06:12.419> still

00:06:13.009 --> 00:06:13.019 
kills or something like that and I still

00:06:13.019 --> 00:06:14.779 
kills or something like that and I still
came<00:06:13.139> in<00:06:13.319> third<00:06:13.559> even<00:06:13.740> though<00:06:13.949> I<00:06:13.979> killed<00:06:14.369> the

00:06:14.779 --> 00:06:14.789 
came in third even though I killed the

00:06:14.789 --> 00:06:16.159 
came in third even though I killed the
last<00:06:14.969> person<00:06:15.479> I<00:06:15.629> was<00:06:15.749> the<00:06:15.839> only<00:06:15.959> one<00:06:16.110> left

00:06:16.159 --> 00:06:16.169 
last person I was the only one left

00:06:16.169 --> 00:06:19.489 
last person I was the only one left
alive<00:06:16.379> so<00:06:16.889> it's<00:06:17.729> kind<00:06:17.909> of<00:06:17.939> weird<00:06:18.349> this<00:06:19.349> is<00:06:19.439> the

00:06:19.489 --> 00:06:19.499 
alive so it's kind of weird this is the

00:06:19.499 --> 00:06:21.049 
alive so it's kind of weird this is the
reason<00:06:19.649> I<00:06:19.769> posted<00:06:20.099> this<00:06:20.189> game<00:06:20.430> was<00:06:20.879> because
