00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
I think there was a plane before

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.529 
I think there was a plane before
elections<00:02:08.429> in<00:02:08.550> a<00:02:08.610> row<00:02:08.640> where<00:02:09.030> they<00:02:09.119> want<00:02:09.360> and

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
elections in a row where they want and

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:10.729 
elections in a row where they want and

very popular one point in America's

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:18.980 
very popular one point in America's
history<00:02:17.520> not<00:02:17.970> considered<00:02:18.390> traditionally

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
history not considered traditionally

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.170 
history not considered traditionally
white<00:02:19.260> at<00:02:19.470> one<00:02:19.650> point<00:02:19.860> Jews<00:02:20.580> not<00:02:20.790> considered

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
white at one point Jews not considered

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.270 
white at one point Jews not considered
traditionally<00:02:21.630> what<00:02:21.780> we<00:02:21.900> move<00:02:22.110> on<00:02:22.319> right<00:02:22.950> and

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
traditionally what we move on right and

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.220 
traditionally what we move on right and
so<00:02:23.580> this<00:02:23.730> is<00:02:23.790> his<00:02:24.120> pretend<00:02:24.660> non-traditional

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
so this is his pretend non-traditional

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.100 
so this is his pretend non-traditional
uh<00:02:26.069> yeah<00:02:27.060> I<00:02:27.270> guess<00:02:27.420> what<00:02:27.720> he's<00:02:27.810> saying<00:02:28.020> is

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
uh yeah I guess what he's saying is

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.110 
uh yeah I guess what he's saying is
those<00:02:28.290> selfish<00:02:28.740> Obama<00:02:29.130> voters<00:02:29.490> didn't<00:02:29.940> care
