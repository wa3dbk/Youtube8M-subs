00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:06.669
 2 creator and good this new video 

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:08.590
 I want to teach the new computer that 

00:00:06.669 --> 00:00:10.330
 is being this here is a 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:12.260
 special computer to play and all that 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:15.240
 that is 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:18.780
 precisely just to play and also 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.500
 to record and if you do not feel like it and everything 

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:20.880
 you want 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.090
 if I have good are four 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.090
 fans 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:30.289
 if you can a little inside from here 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:34.560
 inside has clues leave them 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:37.860
 writing the pieces of the box is a 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:43.260
 does good not 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:45.660
 xp data do not come more or less 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.329
 It is a Predator X and has enough 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.829
 ahead of these connections has 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.250
 this button and this to regulate the 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:56.210
 speed fan has like this 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:59.600
 from here you can close it 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:02.660
 it closes completely or you open it for 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.159
 great is ventilated and from behind we go to 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.250
 have a little dinner too 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:08.680
 connections of all kinds 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:15.090
 as you can see it is not in kilos 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:15.090
 cÃ¡ceres of the wifi to internet 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:25.580
 and well I'm going to open the design by 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:28.580
 Inside that we are interested 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:32.270
 and well then once opened as you see 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:36.140
 lights is why it has here a led in 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:38.590
 each one and another are four for each 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.590
 fan 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.119
 inside it can be no longer just what 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:43.119
 have 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:49.790
 now 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:53.060
 this is the master q 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.060
 is the 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:58.740
 of the processor from here that what 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.920
 what it does is all the air that comes 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.920
 here 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:09.800
 then this practice is a gtx 260 of 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.080
 envy 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:15.370
 It's pretty cool and it's going pretty good 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.370
 for all the games then I have a 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:24.000
 sonic if they are in the mind of 850 watts 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:27.860
 in the presentation of 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.860
 electricity then I have here a 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:35.069
 a hd of three terabytes and here a ssd 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:50.710
 of 120 and here I am up here too 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:55.230
 6 unasur in concrete 37 ago but 

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:55.230
 and he is here very well 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:03.100
 here there are 22 ram slots put that 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:05.800
 are 2 kingston of 8 gb each of 2000 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:07.240
 hertz and in principle that would be all not 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:10.650
 there's nothing else then an adventure 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:13.220
 entity here friend over this but 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:16.280
 here 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:19.069
 it would be this and this above are the ones that 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:23.480
 regulate with these buttons here 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:25.969
 then in the cover is that is in 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:30.800
 red but age the only thing that has light 

00:03:25.969 --> 00:03:33.440
 inside is this is when you take these 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:39.830
 good and it's also a bit but also 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:41.330
 it does not have the power components and 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:45.030
 nothing this is my computer 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:49.380
 then the logitech keyboard yes 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:53.040
 and the mouse is a ceiling level 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:56.490
 and they were incorporating the bat and the 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:58.350
 spark and things out there that's good to say 

00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:03.210
 running runs the toilet and the parking lot 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:04.920
 runs blue or ultra and butterfield a 

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:09.660
 ultra online against people who give 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:11.640
 I just get to 100 I feel pretty 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:16.700
 I think we do not get 200 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:19.829
 efe pss and the park itself no runs 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:21.930
 one hundred and one with a synchronization 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:25.950
 verticals for vertical circulation to 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:28.110
 he left it at 60 or nailed and if he did not estimate 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:29.880
 the graphics card that acquires why 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:31.919
 do you do this action card function 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:34.350
 graph is at rest at 30 degrees 30 and 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:36.040
 little and when at 60 or so he's 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:39.180
 pretty good 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:44.020
 well enough integration with all this 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:47.860
 the space and the floor are quite large 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:50.740
 for the point intel is 174 thousand 404 thousand 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:53.620
 670 and since this is it would be all is a 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:55.030
 new computer I will record more wanted 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:56.920
 upload it so you can see how good I am going to 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:59.830
 record more and I'll do 

00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:03.660
 more gameplay of for example and all that 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:06.270
 put it on and keep telling ultra 

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:13.840
 180 fps with which is what I want 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:16.570
 and he's pretty handsome this is pretty 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:20.890
 expensive is a gift that I have had but 

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:22.660
 Let's see that the motherboard is 

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:27.689
 a little worse and the graphics card in 

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:30.989
 1770 the 760 feet which is almost 

00:05:27.689 --> 00:05:33.289
 at least it's more than half the price or 

00:05:30.989 --> 00:05:35.369
 be a little half of the 770 

00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:36.539
 consell to be able to play perfectly to 

00:05:35.369 --> 00:05:37.889
 our game happens that I also 

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:40.049
 I want for the next generation and for 

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:41.429
 record and so and so then hard drive 

00:05:40.049 --> 00:05:45.049
 that are pretty good how it is 

00:05:41.429 --> 00:05:45.049
 pretty slots here 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:52.870
 as you can see this is a slot and then 

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:52.870
 put brown 

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:12.890
 You know 

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:14.750
 although I have liked to share what has 

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:16.790
 already been in the computers they left the 

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:20.200
 video answer what you want and we 

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:20.200
 we see in the video goodbye
