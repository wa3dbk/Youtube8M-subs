no<00:06:11.730> problem<00:06:13.820> there<00:06:14.820> you<00:06:15.030> go<00:06:15.210> there's<00:06:15.630> your

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:15.750 
no problem there you go there's your

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:21.380 
no problem there you go there's your
proof<00:06:16.190> it<00:06:17.190> can<00:06:17.520> be<00:06:17.760> done<00:06:18.030> without<00:06:18.630> a<00:06:20.000> Sam<00:06:21.000> I

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:21.390 
proof it can be done without a Sam I

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:24.040

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:35.960 
um I still haven't figured out the rest
of<00:06:33.240> the<00:06:33.300> settings<00:06:33.800> you<00:06:34.800> know<00:06:34.950> that<00:06:35.130> these<00:06:35.700> get

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:35.970 
of the settings you know that these get

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:40.370 
of the settings you know that these get
smaller<00:06:36.420> tires<00:06:36.810> but<00:06:38.480> that's<00:06:39.480> for<00:06:39.930> the<00:06:40.230> people

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:40.380

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:43.170 
who can't use Sammy or don't know how to

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:46.220

use<00:06:43.350> Sammy<00:06:43.650> a<00:06:43.800> whale<00:06:44.130> so<00:06:44.720> that's<00:06:45.720> pretty<00:06:46.020> much

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:46.230 
use Sammy a whale so that's pretty much
