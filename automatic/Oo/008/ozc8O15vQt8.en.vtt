00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:20.680
 a warm welcome to the new 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:23.080
 regionalliga season 2015 the 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.509
 albershausen crusaders after a long time 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:28.090
 preparatory phase, the crusaders traveled 

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:30.460
 to head coach cent franke to fear opponents 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:31.710
 in the substructure faltin form must have looked so 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.210
 the club leaders 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.610
 forced due to several suspended 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:40.000
 the team in the form of quarterback john 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:42.460
 rock middle linebacker nick becker &amp; 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.270
 safety car wallace equal to triple 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.520
 strengthen 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:47.530
 this was also necessary there so far 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.429
 no points collected in montabaur 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:50.649
 could become 

00:00:48.429 --> 00:00:53.170
 after initial sampling on both 

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:56.260
 the game was initially marked 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:58.390
 of defense actions the first one 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.730
 Noteworthy play as before the montabaur 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:02.409
 quarterback thrust classes with one 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:05.590
 walk through the crusaders the 

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:06.820
 fans but also this 3 did not lead to 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.159
 the first points 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:12.070
 Our open came always better 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:13.870
 The game was as red as the rookie timber 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.630
 the one with his first patch for the 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:18.880
 seniors some yards scored the 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.799
 crusaders work in them until just before 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.869
 the endzone 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.890
 then it was finally time for the fans 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:26.590
 could cheer 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:28.780
 John Rock searched and found a receiver 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:31.479
 patrick schmid thus the first 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:34.509
 brought six points of the season on goal 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:36.750
 the subsequent game went wrong 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:40.030
 and so it was after the first quarter 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:42.189
 06 also the defense was open 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:45.939
 stacy in no way after and 

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:47.770
 started highly motivated in kyoto 2 so was 

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:50.380
 it's the former running back andreas 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.719
 pond man in his first game as 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.670
 defense end equal to his first victory 

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:56.560
 who could already register 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.689
 thought the game would have its clear 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.289
 had found favorites 

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:01.210
 sliced 

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:02.969
 an interception calls her the 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.799
 Fighting farmers back on the plan 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:08.140
 and so only a punishment prevented 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:10.390
 the compensation but the defense 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.640
 replied immediately and could through 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:13.780
 new entry nick baker also one 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.910
 force turnover 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.560
 in the first half was clear 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.870
 recognize that the new additions 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.120
 already well integrated into the team 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.800
 and also the newly formed office line 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.860
 always managed to rock 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.020
 to get valuable seconds 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.320
 To emphasize here are also the 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:33.540
 numerous rookies both newcomers 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:35.820
 as well as from the youth again and again 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:39.150
 could show what they already in the 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:40.430
 Location is a big part of this 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.450
 sure again the annual 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:45.570
 Training camp at the sports college 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.370
 Albstadt contributed by every year 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:48.770
 the team continues 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.780
 can grow together 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:54.150
 in the further gameplay of the second 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:56.430
 There were no quarters on either side 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:03:00.570
 achieved more points and went so 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:03.000
 it's good with a 0 6 in the break 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:05.100
 hung up and wide awake amount casey 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.830
 open at the beginning of the second half the 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:09.930
 field especially thomas black was it too 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:12.260
 owe that open always 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.730
 further approached the enemy endzone 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.830
 dennis schmid also caught one 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:19.110
 sensational day and moved the egg 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:21.420
 meter by meter direction endzone of 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:23.130
 driver must and so it was deserved 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:25.290
 wise wide receiver matthias scheuring 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:27.530
 the first drive of the second 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:31.549
 half-time with a touchdown graduation 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:33.870
 score after failed 40 to 12 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:36.959
 the stocking headcoach 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:38.940
 However, sebastian haas continue to fight and 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:42.090
 showed that also their fans the 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:44.040
 It had taken good advantage of the preparation time 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.590
 Year after year , they succeeded 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:49.350
 to work the end zone of the crusaders 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.760
 Although tim baronen initially prevented it 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:52.680
 the first home points 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:56.130
 but that should not have been it yet 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:58.200
 its the next drive the famos could 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:00.660
 difficult to be stopped and then 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:03.720
 was as runningback georgia haas the with 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:05.790
 a spectacular 65 years of his 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.920
 team brought the first points 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:09.290
 You can see it was clearly there again 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:11.580
 like every year on the underground 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:12.959
 preparation is going well for us 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:15.480
 without injuries 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:17.100
 and yes you still see a lot of work ahead 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.959
 All communication is in the deep 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.910
 often not quite round but me 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:22.169
 are on the way to the preparation 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:25.590
 went well 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:28.729
 as the hosts closed on 712 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:31.009
 the crusaders were challenged again 

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:31.930
 and one did not do that twice 

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:34.969
 say 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:38.029
 despite double cover matthias succeeded 

00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:40.039
 shouting the impossible be cash 

00:04:38.029 --> 00:04:42.110
 brought the crusaders into a good one 

00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:44.599
 initial situation for quarter 4 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:46.969
 also matthias messerschmidt the last 

00:04:44.599 --> 00:04:48.830
 should happen due to studies 

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:52.460
 Feels at home again and again 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:54.800
 has shown several good runs many times 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:57.349
 but does not mention points tired yet 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:00.650
 Make the match euring where he is 

00:04:57.349 --> 00:05:02.509
 had stopped in q3 again a 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:04.969
 dream pass by john rock on the wide 

00:05:02.509 --> 00:05:07.879
 receiver and s landed the next 

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:08.960
 score on the scoreboard score 7 

00:05:07.879 --> 00:05:11.270
 to 18 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:13.729
 the fighting spirit of the pharma still 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:15.979
 not broken and worked so long 

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:17.449
 she returns with nice actions again 

00:05:15.979 --> 00:05:20.210
 Direction endzone of the albershausen 

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:22.759
 crusaders know each other over and over again 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:24.979
 cordoba pitcher let go through 

00:05:22.759 --> 00:05:28.479
 Reagans repeatedly put on the scene and 

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:31.159
 So the fans kept his life alive 

00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:32.210
 After all , it was him after all 

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:35.089
 a nice run to 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:37.939
 interim 13 to 18 score 

00:05:35.089 --> 00:05:40.819
 The host then joined 

00:05:37.939 --> 00:05:42.979
 again her second air could so 

00:05:40.819 --> 00:05:45.469
 crusaders open again though 

00:05:42.979 --> 00:05:47.629
 but first down was achieved 

00:05:45.469 --> 00:05:49.240
 painfully from the farmers fans 

00:05:47.629 --> 00:05:52.159
 stopped 

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:54.800
 then great relief was provided 

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:57.879
 Philipp Schnabl the through his cover 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:06:00.409
 the coupe forced a fumble 

00:05:57.879 --> 00:06:04.279
 quickly reacted like a keel 

00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:06.259
 baker endboss of the old and in 

00:06:04.279 --> 00:06:09.289
 the endzone was running and that was how it stood 

00:06:06.259 --> 00:06:12.110
 final score of 13 to 25 after 

00:06:09.289 --> 00:06:16.009
 successful kicker markus weber stuck 

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:17.779
 and the first victory of the season 2015 was 

00:06:16.009 --> 00:06:19.669
 under roof and fold was the first game 

00:06:17.779 --> 00:06:21.259
 the after injury a bit 

00:06:19.669 --> 00:06:21.889
 Trust was back in the court 

00:06:21.259 --> 00:06:25.009
 quite well 

00:06:21.889 --> 00:06:26.360
 and yes at the end of the duck poops so green 

00:06:25.009 --> 00:06:27.740
 we won and we still have 

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:29.180
 is not our come true it once was 

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:34.789
 very important thing that I win once 

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:36.319
 what i do quite well is the function 

00:06:34.789 --> 00:06:37.180
 even in times of bayer we have quite 

00:06:36.319 --> 00:06:41.490
 played well 

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:44.340
 after previously have a kink 

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:47.370
 Now go through the big ones again 

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:48.810
 and all of it was okay but what it needs 

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:50.610
 there are still some things left 

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:52.259
 a lot has to be done so 

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:53.880
 trainings default it were only 

00:06:52.259 --> 00:06:56.819
 Traded and owned hamburg 

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:58.530
 certainly hamburg was also in the 

00:06:56.819 --> 00:06:59.960
 past not really easy too 

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:01.919
 play 

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:04.800
 I do not think we have to 

00:07:01.919 --> 00:07:06.020
 hide so come we come 

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:08.009
 always better in ride we had 

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:10.740
 sometimes a bumpy preparation 

00:07:08.009 --> 00:07:12.349
 but I think it will definitely be 

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:14.550
 a hot dance will be two weeks 

00:07:12.349 --> 00:07:17.130
 Ravensburg will be well prepared and 

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:19.259
 we will prepare well 

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:20.759
 Every game we do thank the 

00:07:19.259 --> 00:07:23.669
