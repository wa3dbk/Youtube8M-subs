the term Europe is in a blind alley I

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.740 
the term Europe is in a blind alley I
really<00:02:48.190> don't<00:02:48.459> think<00:02:48.580> that<00:02:48.820> it's<00:02:49.150> possible<00:02:49.690> to

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
really don't think that it's possible to

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.340 
really don't think that it's possible to
go<00:02:50.170> ahead<00:02:50.440> in<00:02:51.070> in<00:02:51.489> a<00:02:51.610> blind<00:02:52.000> in<00:02:52.630> a<00:02:52.750> bottleneck

go ahead in in a blind in a bottleneck

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:57.600 
go ahead in in a blind in a bottleneck
Europe<00:02:54.220> needs<00:02:54.790> a<00:02:55.450> radical<00:02:56.140> political<00:02:56.610> process

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
Europe needs a radical political process

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.240 
Europe needs a radical political process
which<00:02:57.880> has<00:02:58.300> to<00:02:58.630> be<00:02:58.660> done<00:02:58.959> in<00:02:59.250> individual

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
which has to be done in individual

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.170 
which has to be done in individual
countries<00:03:00.430> not<00:03:01.360> not<00:03:02.050> in<00:03:02.320> a<00:03:02.470> a<00:03:03.280> political

continent<00:03:04.780> Europe<00:03:05.650> you<00:03:05.830> can't<00:03:06.100> have<00:03:06.310> a

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
continent Europe you can't have a

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.940 
continent Europe you can't have a

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
process in a continent and so I think we

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.509 
process in a continent and so I think we
have<00:03:13.180> to<00:03:13.420> start<00:03:13.750> making<00:03:14.080> a<00:03:14.530> paradigm<00:03:15.160> change

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:15.519
