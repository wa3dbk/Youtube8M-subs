about<00:01:33.650> Siberia<00:01:34.490> is<00:01:34.730> some<00:01:35.090> of<00:01:35.180> the<00:01:35.270> ice<00:01:35.420> roads

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
about Siberia is some of the ice roads

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.500 
about Siberia is some of the ice roads
and<00:01:36.080> the<00:01:36.410> ones<00:01:36.590> that<00:01:36.680> haven't<00:01:36.890> been<00:01:37.070> checked

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:37.510

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:39.730 
and the ones that haven't been checked
vehicles<00:01:38.510> can<00:01:38.750> go<00:01:38.900> through<00:01:39.140> the<00:01:39.260> ice<00:01:39.380> and<00:01:39.410> that
