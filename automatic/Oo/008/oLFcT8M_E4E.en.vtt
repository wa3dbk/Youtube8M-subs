new helix 5si gps si many slide imaging
and<00:00:14.849> that's<00:00:14.969> the<00:00:15.059> screen<00:00:15.299> that<00:00:15.450> we're<00:00:15.570> on<00:00:15.660> at

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
and that's the screen that we're on at

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.660 
and that's the screen that we're on at
the<00:00:15.870> moment<00:00:16.049> gives<00:00:16.740> us<00:00:16.859> the<00:00:16.980> ability<00:00:17.160> to<00:00:17.369> shoot

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
the moment gives us the ability to shoot

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.429 
the moment gives us the ability to shoot
a<00:00:17.699> beam<00:00:18.000> out<00:00:18.300> to<00:00:18.570> the<00:00:18.779> left<00:00:18.990> and<00:00:19.199> the<00:00:19.289> right

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
a beam out to the left and the right

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.080 
a beam out to the left and the right
hand<00:00:19.619> side<00:00:19.830> of<00:00:19.949> the<00:00:20.010> boat<00:00:20.189> and<00:00:20.400> be<00:00:20.609> able<00:00:20.699> to<00:00:20.880> see

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
hand side of the boat and be able to see

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.630 
hand side of the boat and be able to see
up<00:00:21.449> to<00:00:21.689> 75<00:00:22.680> metres<00:00:23.070> in<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.189> other<00:00:23.310> direction

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
up to 75 metres in the other direction

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.099 
up to 75 metres in the other direction
so<00:00:24.949> what<00:00:25.949> we've<00:00:26.070> got<00:00:26.099> here<00:00:26.519> at<00:00:26.789> the<00:00:26.820> moment<00:00:27.119> on

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
so what we've got here at the moment on

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.320 
so what we've got here at the moment on
our<00:00:28.769> display<00:00:29.010> is<00:00:29.130> a<00:00:29.310> site<00:00:29.640> imaging<00:00:30.000> screen<00:00:30.300> I

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
our display is a site imaging screen I

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.460 
our display is a site imaging screen I
just<00:00:30.510> want<00:00:30.630> to<00:00:30.689> point<00:00:30.869> out<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:31.140> display

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
just want to point out the display

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.340 
just want to point out the display
itself<00:00:31.769> it's<00:00:32.250> a<00:00:32.340> five<00:00:32.669> inch<00:00:33.030> ultra<00:00:33.690> HD

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
itself it's a five inch ultra HD

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.830 
itself it's a five inch ultra HD
widescreen<00:00:34.800> display<00:00:35.579> so<00:00:35.640> it's<00:00:36.120> a<00:00:36.239> landscape

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
widescreen display so it's a landscape

portrait product in the 5 inch market
the<00:00:42.270> big<00:00:42.510> advantage<00:00:42.930> of<00:00:43.020> this<00:00:43.140> is<00:00:43.379> that<00:00:43.500> when

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
the big advantage of this is that when

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.560 
the big advantage of this is that when
we<00:00:43.680> are<00:00:43.980> on<00:00:44.280> our<00:00:44.399> site<00:00:44.700> imaging<00:00:45.090> screen<00:00:45.360> like

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
we are on our site imaging screen like

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.240 
we are on our site imaging screen like
that<00:00:45.600> we're<00:00:46.230> spreading<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.620> picture<00:00:47.039> across

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
that we're spreading the picture across

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.310 
that we're spreading the picture across
a<00:00:47.370> wider<00:00:47.730> area<00:00:47.850> we're<00:00:48.629> getting<00:00:48.840> a<00:00:48.930> really

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
a wider area we're getting a really

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.729 
a wider area we're getting a really
really<00:00:49.590> good<00:00:49.800> clear<00:00:50.190> crisp<00:00:50.640> image<00:00:51.260> also<00:00:52.260> with

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
really good clear crisp image also with

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.069 
really good clear crisp image also with
these<00:00:52.920> guys<00:00:53.160> as<00:00:53.399> well<00:00:53.640> I've<00:00:54.360> got<00:00:54.570> other<00:00:54.809> two

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
these guys as well I've got other two

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.569 
these guys as well I've got other two
different<00:00:55.440> types<00:00:55.649> of<00:00:55.829> sonar<00:00:56.190> so<00:00:56.370> we've<00:00:56.489> got

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
different types of sonar so we've got

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.459 
different types of sonar so we've got
our<00:00:56.699> down<00:00:56.940> imaging<00:00:57.360> and<00:00:57.870> we've<00:00:58.020> also<00:00:58.170> got<00:00:58.410> our

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
our down imaging and we've also got our

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.950 
our down imaging and we've also got our
traditional<00:00:59.010> 2d<00:00:59.340> sonar<00:00:59.760> and<00:00:59.879> all<00:01:00.359> three<00:01:00.930> of

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
traditional 2d sonar and all three of

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.810 
traditional 2d sonar and all three of
those<00:01:01.230> technologies<00:01:02.010> are<00:01:02.250> in<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.550> 1

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
those technologies are in the 1

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.020 
those technologies are in the 1
transducers<00:01:03.600> are<00:01:03.780> very<00:01:04.110> very<00:01:04.409> simple

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.030 
transducers are very very simple

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.300 
transducers are very very simple
installation<00:01:06.470> we've<00:01:07.470> also<00:01:07.619> got<00:01:08.010> with<00:01:08.159> these

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
installation we've also got with these

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.590 
installation we've also got with these
guys<00:01:08.580> as<00:01:08.909> well

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
guys as well

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.500 
guys as well
our<00:01:10.170> GPS<00:01:10.590> built<00:01:11.010> into<00:01:11.369> it<00:01:11.460> so<00:01:12.240> that's<00:01:12.330> an

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
our GPS built into it so that's an

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.910 
our GPS built into it so that's an
internal<00:01:12.960> GPS<00:01:13.619> antenna<00:01:14.299> a<00:01:15.299> 10<00:01:16.290> Hertz<00:01:16.500> internal

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
internal GPS antenna a 10 Hertz internal

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.920 
internal GPS antenna a 10 Hertz internal
GPS<00:01:17.220> then<00:01:17.490> no<00:01:17.670> need<00:01:17.820> to<00:01:17.970> mount<00:01:18.119> an<00:01:18.360> external

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
GPS then no need to mount an external

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.710 
GPS then no need to mount an external
antenna<00:01:19.290> and<00:01:19.560> we<00:01:19.590> also<00:01:20.220> run<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:21.030> Navy<00:01:21.420> onyx

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
antenna and we also run the Navy onyx

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.230 
antenna and we also run the Navy onyx
gold<00:01:22.080> charts<00:01:22.590> as<00:01:22.740> well<00:01:22.950> which<00:01:23.130> are<00:01:23.369> placed<00:01:24.030> in

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
gold charts as well which are placed in

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.810 
gold charts as well which are placed in
this<00:01:24.330> little<00:01:24.600> card<00:01:24.840> or<00:01:25.110> just<00:01:25.439> here<00:01:25.740> now<00:01:26.520> we<00:01:26.580> can

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
this little card or just here now we can

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.020 
this little card or just here now we can
also<00:01:27.060> run<00:01:27.420> our<00:01:27.689> one<00:01:28.409> auto<00:01:28.860> chart<00:01:29.369> software<00:01:29.880> so

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
also run our one auto chart software so

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.120 
also run our one auto chart software so
that<00:01:30.180> allows<00:01:30.450> us<00:01:30.479> to<00:01:30.720> be<00:01:30.990> able<00:01:31.110> to<00:01:31.290> create<00:01:31.530> our

that allows us to be able to create our

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.069 
that allows us to be able to create our
own<00:01:32.250> custom<00:01:32.549> contour<00:01:33.150> charting<00:01:33.540> really<00:01:33.930> good
