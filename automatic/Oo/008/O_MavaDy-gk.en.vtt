00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 Now while without capturing the distance we 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.879
 with you on bent elbow 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.410
 many stations already that is not applicable I 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.809
 let's say basically not applicable for 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.130
 this guy why am I starting to give and 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.679
 equal action not so here big 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.350
 get here at this time to get 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.539
 it will turn out 1 whether this question why 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:22.949
 here is this wad less practically 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:25.800
 because if I attack him he will be in time 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:28.609
 block that my hand my hand 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.230
 blocks if i have 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:33.719
 reverse grip look I went for it 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.969
 cuts even if he blocks what he 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:39.149
 gets the opposite action understood yes then 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:41.760
 have here we have a knife in one-sided 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:44.399
 understand one-sided understanding here 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.500
 here on time contact we have but what 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.930
 two-way understanding that is i already 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.090
 can work more modified here 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.430
 Now put the dolls again at the steel 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.850
 with the calculation so that the cube besides not 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.829
 2 or 2 DC offset well here in this 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.770
 side now i won't be riser made 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:04.260
 themselves do it but okay 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.840
 you got two kinds for example worth 2 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.270
 the doll is constantly moving as it happens 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.630
 with back I least I will not say immediately 2 on 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.460
 tag 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.040
 but at the same time all the time new positions 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.780
 do we start but look the same 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.580
 the very thing that now work out here 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.280
 for example one option this pen 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:23.939
 controls this person two times two 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.330
 two times two times not to go see 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:29.020
 close to avoid 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:29.530
 once two times two again for example went on 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.260
 shoulder 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:36.640
 what is he doing down now what is he not 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:43.660
 do straighten straighten now not 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:47.440
 I will have a person not to eat 2 or was 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:48.910
 and now again if i survived here arm 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:52.150
 I have to take it because I'm different 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:54.730
 not numbers and either i need to leave as i am 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:56.260
 I work I get delivered and it comes in handy 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:02:05.050
 here again 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:07.630
 option the next option as yourself this 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:09.820
 pose also forget me again not 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:14.560
 I have no time to fold and most likely 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:18.880
 what do you see the story at me 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:21.130
 pursue pursing very question yes yes 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.050
 yes yes yes yes that is to immediately think about 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.660
 what do you do here it once and 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:30.780
 here it went 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:30.780
 next moment first action on 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:47.500
 here we go only very carefully 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.330
 because at the moment you can like things 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.460
 created in the same monsoon therefore 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.290
 very careful not hurry this time 

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:54.340
 the designation will do the following 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:03:02.560
 moment again hand 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:03:04.990
 the next moment what and what one understood 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.710
 Yes, that is, there is nothing difficult if I 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:07.840
 work here 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:21.520
 who is the gun of the day the hand returns to 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:23.950
 punctured automatic machine at the puncture even if you 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:26.830
 worked on the facial sector very 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.580
 neatly here immediately passes administers 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:29.830
 a thrust 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:32.620
 the same thing here I watched here 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:34.060
 marked the hands up but the knife is already automatic 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:37.630
 will not cut 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:39.040
 he needs to work where closer and closer to him 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:42.430
 simpler and simpler than simple 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:44.080
 bring a piercing yes here in this 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:46.330
 situations if in the previous version 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.050
 when we clicked so here he had 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:50.440
 more chance 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:50.950
 yes now that he has a chance 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.380
 less 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:55.150
 You see, he has more he can 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:58.690
 just stupid hands expose yes where there 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:04:01.360
 from here and here it is necessary to have him 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:03.490
 chances are not surrendered to him and then right now and 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:06.760
 so in this position, the reverse grip 

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:09.190
 looks very much here 1 and 2 people 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:15.430
 I took this one off this friend 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:18.040
 I see this air on the edge I went through everything 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:20.140
 I understand that now we put our hands on 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:22.680
 different positions start working with 

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:22.680
 different symptoms 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:38.790
 working out different sinners 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:40.980
 the stars themselves feat the seventh extremely 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:42.840
 carefully be sure to change the rack to 

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:46.950
 sure people stand me 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:49.950
 distance so that i reach my goal 

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:51.690
 see dak kova distance so when you 

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:54.510
 work in general, you would find against 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:56.850
 as soon as they depart even breathe here 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:58.920
 it is no longer understood it too 

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:02.790
 close for this distance here already with 

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:06.630
 this distance can not rush 

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:14.090
 distance this is the one closer to that 

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:14.090
 This here's the effect of this
