00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.550 
divided into three parts I want to do

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.130 
divided into three parts I want to do
that<00:00:46.699> so<00:00:47.000> this<00:00:47.180> way<00:00:47.359> we<00:00:48.079> don't<00:00:48.320> spend<00:00:48.739> any<00:00:49.100> a

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:50.140 
that so this way we don't spend any a

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.680 
that so this way we don't spend any a
seriously<00:00:51.140> long<00:00:51.230> amount<00:00:51.710> of<00:00:51.800> time<00:00:51.859> on<00:00:52.309> any<00:00:52.690> one

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.880 
manner so how do you know if you're on a
serious<00:02:28.640> diet<00:02:28.910> program<00:02:29.750> well<00:02:29.959> the<00:02:30.650> first

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
serious diet program well the first

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:32.290 
serious diet program well the first
thing<00:02:31.040> that<00:02:31.220> you<00:02:31.430> want<00:02:31.610> to<00:02:31.640> make<00:02:31.790> sure<00:02:31.819> is<00:02:32.239> that

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300 
thing that you want to make sure is that

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.449 
thing that you want to make sure is that
the<00:02:33.020> program<00:02:33.620> that<00:02:33.739> you're<00:02:33.860> on<00:02:33.950> has<00:02:34.220> a

diet because a fad diet is going to give
you<00:03:10.750> mediocre<00:03:11.750> results<00:03:12.080> and<00:03:12.500> they're<00:03:12.860> not

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
you mediocre results and they're not

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:14.470 
you mediocre results and they're not
going<00:03:13.010> to<00:03:13.160> stick<00:03:13.370> around<00:03:13.400> now<00:03:14.150> even<00:03:14.390> though

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
going to stick around now even though

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:15.699 
going to stick around now even though
you're<00:03:14.630> just<00:03:14.660> trying<00:03:15.019> to<00:03:15.080> get<00:03:15.170> results<00:03:15.350> in<00:03:15.650> a

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:15.709 
you're just trying to get results in a

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:18.070 
you're just trying to get results in a
seven-day<00:03:16.100> period<00:03:16.360> you<00:03:17.360> still<00:03:17.720> want<00:03:17.959> the

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:18.080 
seven-day period you still want the

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:19.960 
seven-day period you still want the
results<00:03:18.410> to<00:03:18.470> stick<00:03:18.709> around<00:03:18.739> afterwards<00:03:19.519> so

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
results to stick around afterwards so

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.060 
results to stick around afterwards so
how<00:03:20.390> do<00:03:20.450> we<00:03:20.570> go<00:03:20.660> after<00:03:20.810> that<00:03:21.230> well<00:03:21.470> it's<00:03:21.620> got<00:03:21.950> to

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:22.070 
how do we go after that well it's got to

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:26.350 
how do we go after that well it's got to
have<00:03:22.220> some<00:03:22.880> science<00:03:23.360> backing<00:03:23.780> it<00:03:24.070> next<00:03:25.070> it<00:03:25.850> has

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:26.360 
have some science backing it next it has

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.630 
have some science backing it next it has
to<00:03:26.540> be<00:03:26.570> easy<00:03:26.900> to<00:03:27.140> implement<00:03:27.380> because<00:03:28.040> if

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:28.640 
to be easy to implement because if

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.229 
to be easy to implement because if
you're<00:03:29.000> going<00:03:29.180> to<00:03:29.350> have<00:03:30.640> this<00:03:31.640> really

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:32.239 
you're going to have this really

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:34.240 
you're going to have this really
hardcore<00:03:32.660> seven-day<00:03:33.530> period<00:03:33.560> you<00:03:33.980> got<00:03:34.130> this

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
hardcore seven-day period you got this

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.069 
hardcore seven-day period you got this
one-week<00:03:35.000> period<00:03:35.209> where<00:03:35.570> you're<00:03:35.690> going<00:03:35.900> to

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:36.079 
one-week period where you're going to

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:38.590 
one-week period where you're going to
really<00:03:36.350> go<00:03:36.560> after<00:03:36.739> it<00:03:37.180> you<00:03:38.180> want<00:03:38.390> to<00:03:38.450> make<00:03:38.570> sure

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:38.600 
really go after it you want to make sure

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.660 
really go after it you want to make sure
that<00:03:38.870> you<00:03:39.530> can<00:03:39.680> actually<00:03:39.799> stick<00:03:40.250> to<00:03:40.280> the<00:03:40.489> diet

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:40.670 
that you can actually stick to the diet

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:43.050 
that you can actually stick to the diet
you<00:03:41.239> don't<00:03:41.420> want<00:03:41.540> to<00:03:41.600> make<00:03:41.690> it<00:03:41.870> so<00:03:42.079> hard<00:03:42.320> that

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
you don't want to make it so hard that

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:46.780 
you don't want to make it so hard that
it's<00:03:44.060> really<00:03:44.390> hard<00:03:44.600> for<00:03:44.900> you<00:03:45.380> to<00:03:45.620> use<00:03:46.370> in<00:03:46.700> your

the<00:03:53.630> dye<00:03:53.780> is<00:03:53.840> so<00:03:54.260> confusing<00:03:54.829> and<00:03:55.250> difficult<00:03:55.430> to

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
the dye is so confusing and difficult to

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:57.400 
the dye is so confusing and difficult to
use<00:03:56.000> that<00:03:56.630> you<00:03:56.720> can't<00:03:56.930> fit<00:03:57.079> it<00:03:57.170> into<00:03:57.290> your

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:57.410 
use that you can't fit it into your

use that you can't fit it into your
daily<00:03:57.620> lifestyle<00:03:58.160> for<00:03:58.400> instance<00:03:58.760> a<00:03:58.940> lot<00:03:59.390> of

00:03:59.500 --> 00:03:59.510 
daily lifestyle for instance a lot of

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:01.479 
daily lifestyle for instance a lot of
diets<00:03:59.810> will<00:03:59.930> say<00:04:00.109> Oh<00:04:00.140> eat<00:04:00.500> six<00:04:00.829> to<00:04:01.010> seven<00:04:01.310> meals

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:01.489 
diets will say Oh eat six to seven meals

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:03.670 
diets will say Oh eat six to seven meals
per<00:04:01.730> day<00:04:01.840> that's<00:04:02.840> just<00:04:02.930> not<00:04:03.170> realistic<00:04:03.320> for

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 
per day that's just not realistic for

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.789 
per day that's just not realistic for
most<00:04:03.980> people<00:04:04.340> and<00:04:04.810> that's<00:04:05.810> not<00:04:06.019> necessary<00:04:06.650> to

00:04:06.789 --> 00:04:06.799 
most people and that's not necessary to

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:10.060 
most people and that's not necessary to
get<00:04:06.920> results<00:04:07.180> what<00:04:08.180> is<00:04:08.299> necessary<00:04:08.540> is<00:04:09.170> that

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:10.070 
get results what is necessary is that

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:13.720 
get results what is necessary is that
you<00:04:10.970> can<00:04:11.329> adapt<00:04:11.780> the<00:04:12.200> principles<00:04:12.769> so<00:04:13.220> for

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:13.730 
you can adapt the principles so for

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:15.370 
you can adapt the principles so for
instance<00:04:13.760> if<00:04:14.150> you<00:04:14.239> can't<00:04:14.510> eat<00:04:14.690> six<00:04:14.930> to<00:04:15.079> seven

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:15.380 
instance if you can't eat six to seven

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:18.069 
instance if you can't eat six to seven
days<00:04:15.560> well<00:04:16.250> what<00:04:16.850> else<00:04:16.970> can<00:04:17.269> you<00:04:17.299> do<00:04:17.539> how<00:04:17.840> can

00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:18.079 
days well what else can you do how can

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:20.710 
days well what else can you do how can
you<00:04:18.109> can<00:04:18.590> you<00:04:18.709> eat<00:04:19.039> you<00:04:19.370> know<00:04:19.489> three<00:04:20.299> meals<00:04:20.510> per

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 
you can you eat you know three meals per

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.390 
you can you eat you know three meals per
day<00:04:20.900> and<00:04:21.049> still<00:04:21.500> have<00:04:21.709> it<00:04:21.829> work<00:04:21.979> the<00:04:22.160> same<00:04:22.340> way

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
day and still have it work the same way

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.980 
day and still have it work the same way
so<00:04:22.970> the<00:04:23.150> diet<00:04:23.390> has<00:04:23.900> to<00:04:24.320> allow<00:04:25.220> for<00:04:25.780> some<00:04:26.780> type

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:26.990 
so the diet has to allow for some type

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:28.390 
so the diet has to allow for some type
of<00:04:27.020> variation

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400 
of variation

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.240 
of variation

that<00:05:51.110> reason<00:05:51.169> I<00:05:51.530> would<00:05:51.620> say<00:05:51.830> you<00:05:52.190> want<00:05:52.400> to<00:05:52.490> stay

00:05:52.719 --> 00:05:52.729 
that reason I would say you want to stay

00:05:52.729 --> 00:05:55.210 
that reason I would say you want to stay
away<00:05:52.909> from<00:05:52.940> it<00:05:53.180> so<00:05:53.750> that's<00:05:54.229> the<00:05:54.380> first<00:05:54.949> thing

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:55.220 
away from it so that's the first thing

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:58.089 
away from it so that's the first thing
that<00:05:55.760> you<00:05:56.599> want<00:05:56.630> to<00:05:56.930> do<00:05:57.080> if<00:05:57.349> you<00:05:57.680> want<00:05:57.800> to<00:05:57.949> lose

00:05:58.089 --> 00:05:58.099 
that you want to do if you want to lose

00:05:58.099 --> 00:06:00.149 
that you want to do if you want to lose
weight<00:05:58.159> in<00:05:58.610> that<00:05:59.570> seven-day<00:05:59.990> period

00:06:00.149 --> 00:06:00.159 
weight in that seven-day period

00:06:00.159 --> 00:06:03.180 
weight in that seven-day period
specifically<00:06:01.159> lose<00:06:01.430> belly<00:06:01.639> fat<00:06:01.760> so<00:06:02.630> seeing

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:03.190 
specifically lose belly fat so seeing

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:05.920 
specifically lose belly fat so seeing
somewhat<00:06:04.190> visual<00:06:04.820> results<00:06:05.300> you're<00:06:05.659> not<00:06:05.810> going

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:05.930 
somewhat visual results you're not going

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:07.779 
somewhat visual results you're not going
to<00:06:05.990> see<00:06:06.169> amazing<00:06:06.740> results<00:06:06.979> in<00:06:07.340> a<00:06:07.400> seven-day

00:06:07.779 --> 00:06:07.789 
to see amazing results in a seven-day

00:06:07.789 --> 00:06:11.170 
to see amazing results in a seven-day
period<00:06:07.900> but<00:06:08.900> you<00:06:09.740> can<00:06:09.919> see<00:06:10.159> visual<00:06:10.639> results<00:06:11.060> in

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:11.180 
period but you can see visual results in

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:13.270 
period but you can see visual results in
a<00:06:11.270> seven-day<00:06:11.659> period<00:06:11.690> and<00:06:12.199> like<00:06:12.800> I<00:06:12.889> said<00:06:12.949> if

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:13.280 
a seven-day period and like I said if

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:16.420 
a seven-day period and like I said if
you<00:06:13.310> have<00:06:13.430> something<00:06:13.909> to<00:06:14.150> do<00:06:14.479> a<00:06:14.720> week<00:06:15.530> out<00:06:15.710> then

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:16.430 
you have something to do a week out then

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:19.029 
you have something to do a week out then
this<00:06:17.210> is<00:06:17.419> one<00:06:17.800> principle<00:06:18.800> that<00:06:18.919> you

00:06:19.029 --> 00:06:19.039 
this is one principle that you

00:06:19.039 --> 00:06:21.399 
this is one principle that you
definitely<00:06:19.250> want<00:06:19.639> to<00:06:19.699> stick<00:06:19.940> to<00:06:20.150> and<00:06:20.360> in<00:06:21.050> part

00:06:21.399 --> 00:06:21.409 
definitely want to stick to and in part

00:06:21.409 --> 00:06:23.260 
definitely want to stick to and in part
two<00:06:21.590> and<00:06:21.860> part<00:06:21.919> three<00:06:22.099> I'm<00:06:22.639> going<00:06:23.060> to<00:06:23.120> go<00:06:23.240> over

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:23.270 
two and part three I'm going to go over

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:27.070 
two and part three I'm going to go over
a<00:06:23.750> couple<00:06:24.110> more<00:06:24.409> principles<00:06:24.979> so<00:06:26.020> thanks<00:06:27.020> for

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:27.080 
a couple more principles so thanks for

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:29.589 
a couple more principles so thanks for
tuning<00:06:27.470> in<00:06:27.620> I'm<00:06:27.800> jacel<00:06:28.610> body<00:06:28.760> from<00:06:29.240> the<00:06:29.270> secret

00:06:29.589 --> 00:06:29.599 
tuning in I'm jacel body from the secret

00:06:29.599 --> 00:06:31.810 
tuning in I'm jacel body from the secret
to<00:06:29.720> fat<00:06:29.840> loss<00:06:30.050> calm<00:06:30.530> I'll<00:06:30.800> see<00:06:31.280> you<00:06:31.310> in<00:06:31.580> part

to fat loss calm I'll see you in part

00:06:31.820 --> 00:07:29.380 
to fat loss calm I'll see you in part
two<00:06:32.030> and<00:06:32.210> three
