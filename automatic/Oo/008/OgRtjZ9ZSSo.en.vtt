00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:07.029
 let's prepare hamburger style 

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:09.240
 water the ingredients we need 

00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:12.249
 they are for the meat of hamburgers 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.079
 400 grams of beef 2 

00:00:12.249 --> 00:00:16.920
 teaspoons of bovril or concentrate of 

00:00:14.079 --> 00:00:19.720
 salt and pepper meat and for assembly 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.060
 large rolls with lettuce seeds 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:25.110
 chopped tomato sliced â€‹â€‹onion rings 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:29.470
 fresh sour gherkin sliced 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:32.230
 mayonnaise and ketchup we started lining up 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:36.929
 well the meat of the hamburger and 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:36.929
 throwing two teaspoons of bovril 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.140
 we are going to move it a little bit 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.480
 that way we also line up the hamburger 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.630
 big mac style 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:55.290
 they are very similar in this step we take 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:57.420
 the salt and a little bit of pepper and what 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:59.489
 let's mix everything very well with the 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:03.140
 hands so that the 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.140
 ingredients for all the meat 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:13.630
 now we are going to weigh the meat every 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:17.360
 hamburger has to weigh 200 grams 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:20.930
 whereupon once heavy we make a 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:22.930
 ball and we crush it 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:25.730
 to be able to stretch it more easily 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:28.370
 we help ourselves with a kitchen paper and the 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:31.850
 roll and we're stretching it 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:34.750
 so that we stay then of the thickness more 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:37.400
 or less than a finger and well round 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.870
 when we have them both first thing 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.290
 what we have to do on the plate is 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:43.270
 toast bread 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:46.240
 and once this is done we are going to do 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:48.880
 our meat that has to be very 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:51.300
 done so we will do it over medium heat or 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.300
 low 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:58.980
 according to tostadita we turn it over 

00:01:56.049 --> 00:02:01.140
 and once it's done 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:03.390
 we take it out 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.000
 if we have an April iron with lines 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.680
 we will be more authentic still now 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.600
 we go with the assembly the first thing that 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:13.680
 we have to do is in the cover of 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:16.340
 the hamburger throw generous mayonnaise and 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:20.920
 on top 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.920
 we toss a bit of chopped lettuce 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.710
 we put a couple of slices of tomato 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.310
 three onion rings 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:38.930
 and at the base of the bread we place the meat 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:44.980
 we put three slices of gherkin 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:44.980
 bittersweet we make a ketchup spiral 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:52.870
 and we put the two parts together 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:55.180
 very carefully created 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.930
 done this we have already formed our 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.950
 toilet 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:04.129
 now the final trick we are going to leave 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:08.620
 wrapped in paper oven or paper 

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:08.620
 waxed or vegetable paper 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:14.990
 and heat it just before serving to 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:17.450
 half power in the microwave about two 

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:20.930
 minutes while we can fry some 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:24.230
 patatitas and ready we have our 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:26.959
 hamburger style water list 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:30.650
 reason pad because let's be honest these 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:32.959
 meals are not eaten they zampan and it is not 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:37.810
 because I said it but you already know 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:37.810
 I can assure you it is delicious
