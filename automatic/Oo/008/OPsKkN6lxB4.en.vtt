00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 beautiful all the guys here orgasms that 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.629
 I'm here with the first video on FIFA 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.670
 so here we are on the demo I'm in 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:12.450
 live commentaries I just got guys 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:14.519
 finished downloading so it's the first one 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.500
 time the hour x I never played 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.800
 let's go immediately to see the ultimate team 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.930
 what it looks like here goes well is the 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.779
 initial package I think mercy 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.779
 attention immediately so let's see 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:31.529
 we put the team a moment 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:33.860
 aguero yaya touré navas meanwhile reds and 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.700
 it happened for the history of the agreement 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.520
 etc. etc. 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.800
 then let's put on yaya touré 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.510
 let's move it with navas however now it knows 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.010
 we will play a game to see some 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.829
 what are my relative impressions 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.629
 to the game 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:52.170
 meanwhile I don't want it de michelis 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:54.510
 because as slow as my grandfather then I don't 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:58.289
 it makes me do a game 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:00.440
 and anyway we play management 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:03.960
 team does not care game match 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:07.170
 let 's see the opponent who's a rose 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:11.220
 ultimate team 2 with drogba diego costa 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.990
 hazard and the doorman and silver do not know 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:17.689
 why is it okay anyway 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.689
 we can safely play navas 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.310
 but by the way that shit of shooting between 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.200
 the other does not even know in what difficulty 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.570
 he is playing because I have not seen well 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:31.290
 I still could not orient myself well with the 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:33.900
 this is a beautiful enemy 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:38.450
 go garden go garden razor blades 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.450
 allowed at home 2 euro crap stop 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:45.020
 pedrito 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:48.380
 pedrito aguero aguero aguero arrive 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:50.300
 from one to zero then a game a 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.520
 to tell the truth it seems to me quite similar 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:56.180
 to 14 so the first impression I have 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:58.670
 had, however, this was certainly the 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:02.150
 different fur control 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:05.090
 but then for the moment I have not found 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:07.670
 big differences both at the level of 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:10.729
 gameplay that to the graphic level to say the 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:16.900
 truth seems that it seems that strength 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:20.960
 physics really counts a lot but anyway 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:25.100
 defensively it is a bit like the 14th that is 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:29.720
 according to me in the fifa years what he did 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:33.260
 to say in fifa 12 was marked 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:37.130
 easily being fast doing the 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:40.390
 end shopping fifa 13 instead was not enough 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:43.310
 to be precisely there still fast and 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:46.190
 basically make power shots 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:48.610
 on the pole in fifa 14 more or less the same 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:52.459
 according to me if a 14 what they did 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:54.320
 have increased the difficulty of doing 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:57.200
 goals but have also increased the 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:59.120
 difficulty using defense 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:04.010
 defenders for which a little things yes 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:06.470
 compensated in this game it seems that 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:09.820
 the defenses are quite similar to 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:12.650
 that to what there was in awe 14 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:14.420
 it's over I think 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:16.610
 the first half ends but I think it is 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:22.540
 finished the game directly because me 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:25.550
 it seems that there is only one time in the demos 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:28.910
 for the no prizes I was joking and there is also 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:30.340
 the second time I did not expect e 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:33.890
 straight ahead 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:36.739
 the right to permits if he carries it on 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:39.470
 left I did n't prepare it from that 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:40.819
 I saw the goalkeepers in the other demos 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:43.010
 sometimes they are rescues 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:46.370
 incredible as if they had increased i 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:48.650
 their reflections in an exorbitant manner 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:50.239
 anyway better because in awe 14 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:52.730
 we had concierges who did 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:55.730
 then really shit in some cases 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:58.459
 it can certainly be a positive thing 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:03.769
 let's see who this is on the bench 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:07.849
 I did n't even see it royce back then 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:09.500
 I call it royce here I care nothing 

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:16.700
 we sincerely agree 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:18.049
 gundogan hummels case ibra to have the 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:22.100
 replacements 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:25.419
 then we don't put an els we put i 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:31.070
 brava bra in place of aguero so by chance 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:36.860
 graylings so piquet chased overturned 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:40.360
 unbelievable my mom who does the pound 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:40.360
 then marco reus 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:48.060
 Long evidence that the parade is yes goalkeepers 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:49.650
 they are really strong or have increased 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:51.509
 the difficulty of scoring goals too 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:53.669
 this year because I think every year 

00:04:51.509 --> 00:04:58.590
 then they do it or whatever the goalkeepers are 

00:04:53.669 --> 00:05:01.979
 really year is over so ok it's over 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:06.330
 the game is fine to comment on 

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:11.210
 game but the gameplay appeared a good one 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:14.219
 I play a good game certainly good 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:17.580
 here then now that you can't do 

00:05:14.219 --> 00:05:23.129
 nothing that is just playing in each 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:26.639
 case it is yes I want to evaluate it now why 

00:05:23.129 --> 00:05:30.840
 let me explain better last year by trying 

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:33.180
 the demo I had said immediately 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:35.370
 judgments a little hasty about the game 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:39.979
 I was a little bit ill then playing when 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:42.449
 it was out I got a bit like saying 

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:45.479
 denied because in reality the game then 

00:05:42.449 --> 00:05:48.150
 it wasn't as nice as I thought hoping 

00:05:45.479 --> 00:05:50.400
 that this year is different 

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:53.130
 really nice I hope so and so much 

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:55.310
 however this is all for the first one 

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:57.900
 fifa 15 video this year 

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:59.789
 write me in the comments if you have 

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:03.310
 tried the demo thing I think so 

00:05:59.789 --> 00:06:05.980
 now it's out for all the consoles what 

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:08.920
 you have what you think of this demo 

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:10.930
 what differences or almost what 

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:12.360
 same you have found compared to 

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:15.100
 previous title 

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:17.530
 I hope I have been clear enough 

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:20.410
 in this video but I think anyway I think 

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:22.510
 yes he chose how i like it for the 

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:25.330
 first video of fifa 15 and we succeed in 

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:27.640
 get at least 300 350 400 likes 

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:30.900
 let's see this and see you next 

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:30.900
 nice raga video
