 Youth Forum for the Environment 

00:00:07.511 --> 00:00:12.511
 "Global Youth for the Environment Forum" is the corporate social responsibility initiatives of Samsung Engineering. 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
 Which helps raise the environmental awareness of children. 

00:00:17.375 --> 00:00:22.375
 Our children here have a unique opportunity to define the environment and climate change. 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.400
 Our children are our future. 

00:00:24.454 --> 00:00:32.454
 During this forum, children can listen to lectures for prominent speakers such as professors, ambassadors and even celebrities. 

00:00:33.794 --> 00:00:35.794
 I am very happy to be here. 

00:00:35.753 --> 00:00:40.753
 The forum gave me a very rare opportunity to meet other people from all over the world. 

00:00:40.022 --> 00:00:43.022
 I met with Koreans to create a global network of friends. 

00:00:43.452 --> 00:00:48.452
 I also got a lot of information on climate change during this forum. 

00:00:48.409 --> 00:00:52.409
 The forum let me know a lot of things, and that changed me a lot. 

00:00:51.904 --> 00:00:55.904
 The forum changed me a lot because I managed to interact with many people. 

00:00:56.627 --> 00:01:02.627
 I got a lot of great ideas that I can bring to Kenya to make a difference. 

00:01:02.286 --> 00:01:08.286
 In fact, KFUPM is one of the most distinguished schools in Saudi Arabia. 

00:01:09.155 --> 00:01:16.155
 Whenever my students know about this competition, they work hard to become winners. 

00:01:14.796 --> 00:01:17.796
 There are five winners at my university, 

00:01:17.561 --> 00:01:19.561
 And they were invited to Samsung 

00:01:19.435 --> 00:01:25.435
 To share social responsibility and play leading roles in environmental protection. 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:31.659
 On behalf of my students, I would like to extend my sincere thanks to Samsung Engineering for launching the excellent initiative. 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.800
 I wish you success and good luck! 

00:01:33.056 --> 00:01:36.056
 They became interested in climate change through this project and the forum. 

00:01:36.462 --> 00:01:40.460
 When I return to Saudi Arabia, I will try to find out more about this 

00:01:40.534 --> 00:01:44.530
 And look for many different ways to stop it. 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.800
 Climate change can not be easily stopped, but it can be slowed down. 

00:01:46.667 --> 00:01:50.670
 What I learned in the forum is human behavior and behavior that led to climate change. 

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:55.040
 When I return to the Kingdom, I will try to learn more about this and I want to be better. 

00:01:55.354 --> 00:01:58.350
 We will need more than one person to save the earth. 

00:01:57.721 --> 00:02:01.720
 I will gather a lot of people and do my best to achieve our goals. Thank you. 

00:02:00.708 --> 00:02:10.710
 I have come here to participate in the "Global Youth Forum 2013" with my son who won the speech contest in Saudi Arabia. 

00:02:11.308 --> 00:02:14.310
 I am very happy and proud of it. 

00:02:13.779 --> 00:02:19.780
 I also learned about Samsung's corporate social responsibility program. 

00:02:19.754 --> 00:02:26.750
 I wish I could return to South Korea to work beautifully with Samsung Engineering 

00:02:26.377 --> 00:02:36.380
 For our new generation and seize the opportunity to mitigate the effects of climate change. 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:37.990
 Thank you Samsung! 

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:48.410
 The Royal Commission for Jubail organized the English Language Speaking Contest in collaboration with Samsung Saudi Arabia Engineering. 

00:02:47.831 --> 00:02:51.830
 The winners were invited to the Forum. 

00:02:51.604 --> 00:02:56.600
 I would like to express my thanks to Samsung Engineering for providing the wonderful opportunity 

00:02:56.056 --> 00:03:01.060
 For Saudi students to participate in the World Youth Forum in Korea. 

00:03:01.482 --> 00:03:05.480
 Giving back to the community is noble. 

00:03:05.235 --> 00:03:11.240
 This social responsibility program contributes to a better corporate image than ever before. 

00:03:10.937 --> 00:03:18.940
 Therefore, I want Samsung Engineering to promote and expand social responsibility programs in Saudi Arabia 

00:03:18.221 --> 00:03:20.220
 To give a greater chance to other students in the country.
