polish removers but I like to just make

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.860 
polish removers but I like to just make
sure<00:02:32.800> that<00:02:33.100> has<00:02:33.460> some<00:02:33.730> sort<00:02:33.940> of<00:02:34.060> hydrating<00:02:34.690> or

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870

strengthening qualities in them because

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.580 
strengthening qualities in them because
acetone<00:02:37.360> is<00:02:37.480> not<00:02:37.630> great<00:02:37.840> for<00:02:38.020> your<00:02:38.110> nails<00:02:38.320> and

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:42.780 
I don't like the non acetone ones
because<00:02:41.050> I<00:02:41.080> feel<00:02:41.410> like<00:02:41.440> it<00:02:41.590> doesn't<00:02:41.950> remove<00:02:42.490> as

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790

our anniversary trip and while we're
sailing<00:04:47.990> at<00:04:48.080> night<00:04:48.260> time<00:04:48.500> it<00:04:48.710> can<00:04:48.920> get<00:04:49.160> a

sailing at night time it can get a
little<00:04:49.430> cold<00:04:49.910> so<00:04:50.300> I<00:04:50.630> thought<00:04:50.900> this<00:04:51.140> would<00:04:51.200> be

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:51.350 
little cold so I thought this would be

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:53.920 
little cold so I thought this would be
perfect<00:04:51.680> because<00:04:52.100> the<00:04:52.400> color<00:04:52.700> screams<00:04:53.420> summer

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:53.930 
perfect because the color screams summer

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:58.270 
perfect because the color screams summer
and<00:04:54.920> it<00:04:55.160> just<00:04:55.490> fits<00:04:55.970> so<00:04:56.300> flatteringly<00:04:57.160> next<00:04:58.160> I

00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:58.280 
and it just fits so flatteringly next I

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:00.280 
and it just fits so flatteringly next I
went<00:04:58.460> to<00:04:58.730> one<00:04:58.910> of<00:04:59.000> my<00:04:59.060> favorite<00:04:59.420> stores<00:04:59.870> and
