the stuff I was mentioning is like in
here<00:04:06.670> the<00:04:07.670> use<00:04:07.909> of<00:04:08.269> the<00:04:09.170> background<00:04:10.099> ground

00:04:10.539 --> 00:04:10.549 
here the use of the background ground

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:12.569 
here the use of the background ground
graphic<00:04:11.269> things<00:04:11.569> don't<00:04:11.930> look<00:04:12.079> all<00:04:12.290> too<00:04:12.469> good

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:12.579

and the corners are kind of weird

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:17.409
