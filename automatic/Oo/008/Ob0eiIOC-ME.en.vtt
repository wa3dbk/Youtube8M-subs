00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.270 

okay<00:00:00.960> before<00:00:01.140> we<00:00:01.410> actually<00:00:01.620> get<00:00:01.979> to<00:00:02.010> the

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:02.280 
okay before we actually get to the

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.340 
okay before we actually get to the
formulas<00:00:02.790> that<00:00:02.820> show<00:00:03.210> that<00:00:03.449> there<00:00:03.629> are<00:00:03.659> that

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.350 
formulas that show that there are that

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.619 
formulas that show that there are that
there<00:00:04.529> is<00:00:04.650> an<00:00:04.770> optimal<00:00:05.190> strategy<00:00:05.400> I<00:00:05.910> want<00:00:06.569> to

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
there is an optimal strategy I want to

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:08.360 
there is an optimal strategy I want to
first<00:00:06.839> state<00:00:07.109> the<00:00:07.170> theorem<00:00:07.529> that<00:00:07.890> says<00:00:08.130> hey

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
first state the theorem that says hey

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:09.830 
first state the theorem that says hey
everything<00:00:08.849> that<00:00:08.970> we're<00:00:09.090> doing<00:00:09.120> is<00:00:09.510> in<00:00:09.540> fact

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
everything that we're doing is in fact

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.570 
everything that we're doing is in fact
valid<00:00:10.080> and<00:00:10.530> again<00:00:11.010> we're<00:00:11.160> not<00:00:11.190> going<00:00:11.400> to<00:00:11.429> give

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
valid and again we're not going to give

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:12.830 
valid and again we're not going to give
proofs<00:00:11.880> of<00:00:12.000> everything<00:00:12.389> but<00:00:12.660> I<00:00:12.809> think

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
proofs of everything but I think

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.629 
proofs of everything but I think
certainly<00:00:13.410> it's<00:00:13.679> worth<00:00:13.830> stating<00:00:14.160> the<00:00:14.340> theorem

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
certainly it's worth stating the theorem

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.700 
certainly it's worth stating the theorem
so<00:00:14.910> again<00:00:15.750> ultimately<00:00:15.900> we<00:00:16.320> want<00:00:16.440> to<00:00:16.560> find

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
so again ultimately we want to find

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.519 
so again ultimately we want to find
these<00:00:16.859> optimal<00:00:17.430> strategies<00:00:18.260> one<00:00:19.260> thing<00:00:19.439> I

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
these optimal strategies one thing I

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:20.540 
these optimal strategies one thing I
want<00:00:19.710> to<00:00:19.770> show<00:00:19.890> real<00:00:20.130> quick

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
want to show real quick

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.509 
want to show real quick
the<00:00:21.150> expected<00:00:21.570> value<00:00:21.830> using<00:00:22.830> the<00:00:23.010> strategies

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
the expected value using the strategies

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.730 
the expected value using the strategies
in<00:00:23.670> P<00:00:23.880> and<00:00:23.910> Q<00:00:24.269> we<00:00:24.720> can<00:00:24.750> actually<00:00:25.199> compute<00:00:25.529> this

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
in P and Q we can actually compute this

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.460 
in P and Q we can actually compute this
expected<00:00:26.310> value<00:00:26.570> simply<00:00:27.570> by<00:00:27.720> taking<00:00:28.140> the

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
expected value simply by taking the

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.800 
expected value simply by taking the
matrix<00:00:28.650> P<00:00:29.130> times<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:29.670> matrix<00:00:29.789> M<00:00:30.210> times<00:00:30.689> the

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
matrix P times the matrix M times the

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.280 
matrix P times the matrix M times the
matrix<00:00:31.199> Q<00:00:31.710> and<00:00:32.630> when<00:00:33.630> we<00:00:33.750> computed<00:00:34.170> the

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
matrix Q and when we computed the

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.610 
matrix Q and when we computed the
expected<00:00:34.800> value<00:00:35.190> previously<00:00:35.880> we<00:00:36.630> we<00:00:37.320> came<00:00:37.500> up

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
expected value previously we we came up

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.680 
expected value previously we we came up
with<00:00:37.739> this<00:00:37.890> formula<00:00:38.219> so<00:00:39.090> I<00:00:39.149> just<00:00:39.360> want<00:00:39.480> to<00:00:39.540> show

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
with this formula so I just want to show

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.569 
with this formula so I just want to show
that<00:00:39.719> in<00:00:39.930> fact<00:00:40.140> we<00:00:40.350> still<00:00:40.530> do<00:00:40.890> get<00:00:41.070> that<00:00:41.219> same

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
that in fact we still do get that same

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.389 
that in fact we still do get that same
formula<00:00:42.180> if<00:00:42.510> we<00:00:42.570> take<00:00:43.020> P<00:00:43.320> times<00:00:43.590> M<00:00:43.800> times<00:00:43.829> Q

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
formula if we take P times M times Q

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.010 
formula if we take P times M times Q
just<00:00:44.579> want<00:00:44.760> to<00:00:44.820> do<00:00:44.879> that<00:00:44.969> real<00:00:45.180> quick<00:00:45.390> and

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
just want to do that real quick and

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.670 
just want to do that real quick and
again<00:00:46.309> that's<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.520> reason<00:00:47.850> for<00:00:47.879> using<00:00:48.300> a<00:00:48.390> row

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:48.680 
again that's the reason for using a row

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.889 
again that's the reason for using a row
for<00:00:49.680> using<00:00:49.920> rows<00:00:50.160> and<00:00:50.430> columns<00:00:50.879> is<00:00:51.090> so<00:00:51.750> that

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
for using rows and columns is so that

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.840 
for using rows and columns is so that
now<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.110> matrix<00:00:52.710> multiplication<00:00:53.550> will<00:00:53.730> all

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
now the matrix multiplication will all

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.290 
now the matrix multiplication will all
work<00:00:54.030> out<00:00:54.620> so<00:00:55.620> we've<00:00:55.739> got<00:00:55.890> P<00:00:56.129> 1<00:00:56.280> and<00:00:56.430> P<00:00:56.610> 2<00:00:56.640> we're

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
work out so we've got P 1 and P 2 we're

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.500 
work out so we've got P 1 and P 2 we're
going<00:00:57.420> to<00:00:57.480> multiply<00:00:57.930> that<00:00:58.199> by<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:59.510> matrix

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
going to multiply that by the matrix

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.020 
going to multiply that by the matrix
with<00:01:00.660> entries<00:01:00.859> ABCD<00:01:01.859> and<00:01:02.129> then<00:01:02.820> we're<00:01:02.940> going

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
with entries ABCD and then we're going

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.429 
with entries ABCD and then we're going
to<00:01:03.120> multiply<00:01:03.510> that<00:01:03.539> by<00:01:03.750> Q<00:01:04.320> 1<00:01:04.530> and<00:01:04.890> Q<00:01:04.949> 2<00:01:06.439> notice

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
to multiply that by Q 1 and Q 2 notice

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.980 
to multiply that by Q 1 and Q 2 notice
our<00:01:07.680> first<00:01:07.920> matrix<00:01:08.189> here<00:01:08.580> is<00:01:08.640> a<00:01:08.729> 1<00:01:09.000> by<00:01:09.180> 2<00:01:09.240> matrix

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
our first matrix here is a 1 by 2 matrix

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.950 
our first matrix here is a 1 by 2 matrix
our<00:01:10.080> second<00:01:10.530> one<00:01:10.619> is<00:01:10.740> a<00:01:10.830> 2<00:01:10.890> by<00:01:11.220> 2<00:01:11.250> matrix<00:01:11.659> so<00:01:12.659> if

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
our second one is a 2 by 2 matrix so if

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.719 
our second one is a 2 by 2 matrix so if
we<00:01:13.140> multiply<00:01:13.380> those<00:01:13.830> together<00:01:14.040> we'll<00:01:14.460> end<00:01:14.640> up

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
we multiply those together we'll end up

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.810 
we multiply those together we'll end up
with<00:01:14.790> a<00:01:15.060> 1<00:01:15.689> by<00:01:15.720> 2<00:01:15.930> matrix<00:01:16.530> so<00:01:17.490> again<00:01:17.670> we're

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
with a 1 by 2 matrix so again we're

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.880 
with a 1 by 2 matrix so again we're
doing<00:01:17.880> rows<00:01:18.180> by<00:01:18.390> columns<00:01:18.420> so<00:01:19.380> we<00:01:19.500> would<00:01:19.619> have<00:01:19.740> a

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
doing rows by columns so we would have a

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.249 
doing rows by columns so we would have a
times<00:01:20.369> P<00:01:20.670> 1<00:01:21.740> plus<00:01:22.740> C<00:01:23.100> times<00:01:23.369> P<00:01:23.490> 2<00:01:23.909> that<00:01:24.210> would<00:01:25.110> be

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
times P 1 plus C times P 2 that would be

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.149 
times P 1 plus C times P 2 that would be
our<00:01:25.640> first<00:01:26.640> entry<00:01:26.939> and<00:01:27.360> then<00:01:28.049> we<00:01:28.170> would<00:01:28.320> have<00:01:28.500> B

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
our first entry and then we would have B

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:35.330 
our first entry and then we would have B
times<00:01:29.579> P<00:01:29.970> 1<00:01:30.229> plus<00:01:31.229> D<00:01:32.040> times<00:01:32.369> P<00:01:33.030> 2<00:01:34.280> okay<00:01:35.280> so

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
times P 1 plus D times P 2 okay so

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.940 
times P 1 plus D times P 2 okay so
there's<00:01:35.640> our<00:01:35.759> 1<00:01:36.150> by<00:01:36.329> 2<00:01:36.390> matrix<00:01:36.990> and<00:01:37.229> again<00:01:37.680> now

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
there's our 1 by 2 matrix and again now

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.010 
there's our 1 by 2 matrix and again now
we<00:01:38.009> just<00:01:38.220> have<00:01:38.340> to<00:01:38.430> multiply<00:01:38.549> this<00:01:38.880> by<00:01:39.030> Q<00:01:39.479> 1<00:01:39.689> and

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
we just have to multiply this by Q 1 and

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.080 
we just have to multiply this by Q 1 and
Q<00:01:40.520> 2<00:01:41.720> again<00:01:42.720> we've<00:01:42.840> got<00:01:42.990> a<00:01:43.020> 1<00:01:43.259> by<00:01:43.439> 2<00:01:43.500> matrix<00:01:44.100> this

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
Q 2 again we've got a 1 by 2 matrix this

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.080 
Q 2 again we've got a 1 by 2 matrix this
is<00:01:45.149> a<00:01:45.360> 2<00:01:45.390> by<00:01:45.720> 1<00:01:45.750> matrix<00:01:46.460> notice<00:01:47.460> if<00:01:47.579> we<00:01:47.670> multiply

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
is a 2 by 1 matrix notice if we multiply

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.520 
is a 2 by 1 matrix notice if we multiply
these<00:01:48.149> together<00:01:48.479> we're<00:01:48.899> actually<00:01:49.110> going<00:01:49.470> to

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
these together we're actually going to

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.219 
these together we're actually going to
get<00:01:49.649> a<00:01:49.710> 1<00:01:50.250> by<00:01:50.430> 1<00:01:50.850> matrix<00:01:51.060> so<00:01:51.630> a<00:01:51.659> matrix<00:01:52.079> with

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
get a 1 by 1 matrix so a matrix with

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.830 
get a 1 by 1 matrix so a matrix with
just<00:01:52.409> a<00:01:52.500> single<00:01:52.710> entry<00:01:53.189> and<00:01:53.399> typically<00:01:54.149> we'll

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
just a single entry and typically we'll

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.590 
just a single entry and typically we'll
just<00:01:55.020> simply<00:01:55.579> will<00:01:56.579> write<00:01:56.790> it<00:01:56.969> where<00:01:57.329> we<00:01:57.450> don't

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
just simply will write it where we don't

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.980 
just simply will write it where we don't
even<00:01:57.750> use<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.380> matrix<00:01:58.979> notation<00:01:59.869> so<00:02:00.869> we've

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
even use the matrix notation so we've

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.100 
even use the matrix notation so we've
got<00:02:01.140> our<00:02:01.229> first<00:02:01.500> entry<00:02:01.710> a<00:02:02.070> P<00:02:02.460> 1<00:02:02.729> plus<00:02:03.180> CP<00:02:03.600> 2

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
got our first entry a P 1 plus CP 2

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.709 
got our first entry a P 1 plus CP 2
you've<00:02:04.649> got<00:02:04.740> to<00:02:04.860> multiply<00:02:05.100> that<00:02:05.399> by<00:02:05.460> Q<00:02:05.939> 1<00:02:06.119> and

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
you've got to multiply that by Q 1 and

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.919 
you've got to multiply that by Q 1 and
then<00:02:07.710> we<00:02:07.890> would<00:02:08.069> have<00:02:08.220> our<00:02:08.459> second<00:02:08.879> entry<00:02:09.179> be<00:02:09.660> P

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
then we would have our second entry be P

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:10.529 
then we would have our second entry be P
1

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:10.539 
1

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:13.229 
1
plus<00:02:10.719> DT<00:02:11.620> 2<00:02:11.829> and<00:02:12.610> we're<00:02:12.730> going<00:02:12.760> to<00:02:12.909> multiply

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:13.239 
plus DT 2 and we're going to multiply

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:15.690 
plus DT 2 and we're going to multiply
that<00:02:13.269> by<00:02:13.450> Q<00:02:13.959> 2<00:02:13.989> and<00:02:14.890> that's<00:02:15.099> just<00:02:15.280> a<00:02:15.340> matter<00:02:15.519> of

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
that by Q 2 and that's just a matter of

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.119 
that by Q 2 and that's just a matter of
distributing<00:02:16.359> so<00:02:16.689> we<00:02:16.810> would<00:02:16.900> have<00:02:17.019> a<00:02:17.200> times<00:02:17.739> P

00:02:18.119 --> 00:02:18.129 
distributing so we would have a times P

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:24.170 
distributing so we would have a times P
1<00:02:18.370> times<00:02:18.730> Q<00:02:19.090> 1<00:02:19.329> plus<00:02:20.319> C<00:02:20.590> times<00:02:20.859> P<00:02:21.010> 2<00:02:21.430> times<00:02:22.299> Q<00:02:22.900> 1

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.979 
1 times Q 1 plus C times P 2 times Q 1
got<00:02:25.180> B<00:02:25.359> P<00:02:25.599> 1<00:02:25.810> times<00:02:26.200> Q<00:02:26.620> 2<00:02:26.859> plus<00:02:27.579> D<00:02:28.180> times<00:02:28.480> P<00:02:28.810> 2

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:28.989 
got B P 1 times Q 2 plus D times P 2

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:33.270 
got B P 1 times Q 2 plus D times P 2
times<00:02:29.590> Q<00:02:30.220> 2<00:02:30.430> and<00:02:30.760> I'm<00:02:31.480> not<00:02:31.720> going<00:02:31.900> to<00:02:32.280> reorder

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
times Q 2 and I'm not going to reorder

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.240 
times Q 2 and I'm not going to reorder
these<00:02:33.689> you<00:02:34.689> certainly<00:02:35.019> could<00:02:35.260> but<00:02:35.980> basically

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
these you certainly could but basically

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:37.800 
these you certainly could but basically
I<00:02:36.370> just<00:02:36.549> want<00:02:36.700> to<00:02:36.760> show<00:02:36.879> you<00:02:36.939> hey<00:02:37.269> you<00:02:37.329> do<00:02:37.659> in

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
I just want to show you hey you do in

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.349 
I just want to show you hey you do in
fact<00:02:38.049> get<00:02:38.409> the<00:02:38.470> exact<00:02:39.010> same<00:02:39.250> thing<00:02:39.310> that<00:02:39.909> we

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:40.359 
fact get the exact same thing that we

00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:41.250 
fact get the exact same thing that we
had<00:02:40.599> before

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
had before

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.069 
had before
the<00:02:41.709> same<00:02:42.250> first<00:02:42.519> terms<00:02:42.819> are<00:02:43.030> there<00:02:43.209> okay

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:44.079 
the same first terms are there okay

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:47.190 
the same first terms are there okay
there's<00:02:44.290> our<00:02:44.409> CP<00:02:44.920> 2<00:02:45.099> Q<00:02:45.459> 1<00:02:45.489> term<00:02:46.019> the<00:02:47.019> term

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
there's our CP 2 Q 1 term the term

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.619 
there's our CP 2 Q 1 term the term
involving<00:02:47.470> B<00:02:47.889> and<00:02:48.250> then<00:02:48.549> the<00:02:48.669> term<00:02:48.909> involving

00:02:49.619 --> 00:02:49.629 
involving B and then the term involving

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:54.360 
involving B and then the term involving
D<00:02:50.079> so<00:02:50.799> it<00:02:50.919> actually<00:02:51.040> turns<00:02:51.400> out<00:02:51.609> to<00:02:51.669> compute<00:02:53.370> to

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
D so it actually turns out to compute to

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.309 
D so it actually turns out to compute to
compute<00:02:54.700> the<00:02:54.790> expected<00:02:55.000> value<00:02:55.689> you<00:02:55.989> just<00:02:56.019> do

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:56.319 
compute the expected value you just do

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:59.369 
compute the expected value you just do
that<00:02:56.470> matrix<00:02:56.980> multiplication<00:02:57.480> so<00:02:58.480> that's<00:02:59.200> the

00:02:59.369 --> 00:02:59.379 
that matrix multiplication so that's the

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:02.099 
that matrix multiplication so that's the
reason<00:02:59.739> why<00:02:59.859> we<00:03:00.099> use<00:03:00.129> rows<00:03:00.879> and<00:03:01.239> columns<00:03:01.689> okay

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:02.109 
reason why we use rows and columns okay

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:04.110 
reason why we use rows and columns okay
just<00:03:02.530> to<00:03:02.620> make<00:03:02.769> the<00:03:02.889> matrix<00:03:03.459> multiplication

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
just to make the matrix multiplication

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:09.569 
just to make the matrix multiplication
work<00:03:04.569> out<00:03:05.879> alrighty<00:03:06.879> so<00:03:07.120> a<00:03:07.659> few<00:03:08.530> remarks<00:03:08.919> here

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:09.579 
work out alrighty so a few remarks here

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:15.500 
work out alrighty so a few remarks here
a<00:03:10.500> few<00:03:11.500> remarks<00:03:11.859> and<00:03:13.319> then<00:03:14.319> we'll<00:03:14.379> actually

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
a few remarks and then we'll actually

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:20.129 
a few remarks and then we'll actually
finally<00:03:16.510> jump<00:03:16.959> into<00:03:18.510> finding<00:03:19.510> the<00:03:19.629> optimal

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:20.139 
finally jump into finding the optimal

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:22.559 
finally jump into finding the optimal
strategy<00:03:20.530> and<00:03:21.069> pointing<00:03:21.909> out<00:03:22.000> some<00:03:22.209> remarks

00:03:22.559 --> 00:03:22.569 
strategy and pointing out some remarks

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:25.020 
strategy and pointing out some remarks
about<00:03:22.780> that<00:03:22.989> so<00:03:23.199> again<00:03:24.069> without<00:03:24.489> proof<00:03:24.819> we've

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
about that so again without proof we've

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:26.939 
about that so again without proof we've
now<00:03:25.180> got<00:03:25.419> what's<00:03:25.690> known<00:03:25.870> as<00:03:26.019> the<00:03:26.049> fundamental

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:26.949 
now got what's known as the fundamental

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:30.210 
now got what's known as the fundamental
theorem<00:03:27.459> of<00:03:27.489> game<00:03:27.940> theory<00:03:28.419> okay<00:03:28.930> so<00:03:29.040> it<00:03:30.040> says

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
theorem of game theory okay so it says

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:33.240 
theorem of game theory okay so it says
for<00:03:30.400> every<00:03:30.609> M<00:03:30.970> by<00:03:31.389> n<00:03:31.690> matrix<00:03:32.109> game<00:03:32.349> M<00:03:32.650> there

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
for every M by n matrix game M there

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.729 
for every M by n matrix game M there

00:03:39.119 --> 00:03:39.129 
not necessarily unique for the row

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:40.369 
not necessarily unique for the row

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:45.459 
satisfies the following two inequalities

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:48.149 
satisfies the following two inequalities
it<00:03:46.030> says<00:03:46.389> if<00:03:46.510> we<00:03:46.540> take<00:03:46.750> P<00:03:47.019> star<00:03:47.290> and<00:03:47.620> multiply

00:03:48.149 --> 00:03:48.159 
it says if we take P star and multiply

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:50.879 
it says if we take P star and multiply
it<00:03:48.220> by<00:03:48.489> M<00:03:48.729> and<00:03:49.060> multiply<00:03:49.599> it<00:03:49.659> by<00:03:49.750> Q<00:03:50.229> so<00:03:50.680> again

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:50.889 
it by M and multiply it by Q so again

00:03:50.889 --> 00:03:53.789 
it by M and multiply it by Q so again
we're<00:03:51.069> finding<00:03:51.669> the<00:03:51.819> expected<00:03:52.049> value<00:03:53.049> using

00:03:53.789 --> 00:03:53.799 
we're finding the expected value using

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:57.689 
we're finding the expected value using
this<00:03:54.280> strategy<00:03:55.180> it<00:03:55.389> says<00:03:56.229> the<00:03:56.560> expected<00:03:57.159> value

00:03:57.689 --> 00:03:57.699 
this strategy it says the expected value

00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:59.640 
this strategy it says the expected value
is<00:03:57.939> always<00:03:58.329> going<00:03:58.479> to<00:03:58.540> be<00:03:58.599> greater<00:03:59.139> than<00:03:59.379> or

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:05.709 
strategy that the column player chooses

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:08.009 
strategy that the column player chooses
so<00:04:06.250> it<00:04:06.340> says<00:04:06.519> with<00:04:06.669> this<00:04:06.759> the<00:04:07.180> strategy<00:04:07.810> it

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:08.019 
so it says with this the strategy it

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:10.499 
so it says with this the strategy it
says<00:04:08.199> you'll<00:04:08.680> know<00:04:08.919> that<00:04:09.189> the<00:04:09.790> value<00:04:10.180> is<00:04:10.389> at

00:04:10.499 --> 00:04:10.509 
says you'll know that the value is at

00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:14.999 
says you'll know that the value is at
least<00:04:10.840> this<00:04:11.799> number<00:04:12.810> but<00:04:13.810> likewise<00:04:14.349> it<00:04:14.769> says

00:04:14.999 --> 00:04:15.009 
least this number but likewise it says

00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:17.490 
least this number but likewise it says
if<00:04:15.280> there's<00:04:15.459> a<00:04:15.519> strategy<00:04:16.180> for<00:04:16.419> for<00:04:16.840> the<00:04:17.139> column

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.500 
if there's a strategy for for the column

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.769 
if there's a strategy for for the column
player<00:04:17.680> Q<00:04:18.130> star<00:04:18.340> and<00:04:18.669> it<00:04:19.150> satisfies<00:04:19.419> the

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:19.779 
player Q star and it satisfies the

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:21.959 
player Q star and it satisfies the
second<00:04:20.380> inequality<00:04:20.500> it<00:04:21.010> says<00:04:21.219> if<00:04:21.370> we<00:04:21.430> take<00:04:21.639> P

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:21.969 
second inequality it says if we take P

00:04:21.969 --> 00:04:23.220 
second inequality it says if we take P
times<00:04:22.419> M

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:23.230 
times M

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:26.430 
times M
q-star<00:04:23.770> it<00:04:24.280> says<00:04:24.970> that's<00:04:25.120> always<00:04:25.510> less<00:04:26.170> than

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440 
q-star it says that's always less than

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:29.880 
q-star it says that's always less than

matter<00:04:30.100> what<00:04:30.370> strategy<00:04:30.640> that<00:04:31.270> the<00:04:31.660> row<00:04:32.290> player

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:32.620 
matter what strategy that the row player

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.520 
matter what strategy that the row player
uses<00:04:33.390> so<00:04:34.390> what<00:04:34.660> does<00:04:34.780> this<00:04:34.900> really<00:04:35.080> tell<00:04:35.350> us

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:35.530 
uses so what does this really tell us

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:36.750 
uses so what does this really tell us
here<00:04:35.740> well<00:04:35.920> it<00:04:36.070> tells<00:04:36.370> us<00:04:36.490> something

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:36.760 
here well it tells us something

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:38.940 
here well it tells us something
important<00:04:37.240> so<00:04:37.450> a<00:04:37.690> couple<00:04:38.410> things<00:04:38.500> real<00:04:38.800> quick

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:38.950 
important so a couple things real quick

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:42.000 
important so a couple things real quick
again<00:04:39.340> we<00:04:39.490> call<00:04:39.610> V<00:04:39.880> the<00:04:40.090> value<00:04:40.420> of<00:04:40.930> the<00:04:41.080> game<00:04:41.290> so

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:42.010 
again we call V the value of the game so

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:46.830 
again we call V the value of the game so
earlier<00:04:42.550> in<00:04:42.700> my<00:04:42.850> example<00:04:45.060> you<00:04:46.060> know<00:04:46.180> I<00:04:46.510> guess

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:46.840 
earlier in my example you know I guess

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:50.670 
earlier in my example you know I guess
the<00:04:47.680> expected<00:04:48.190> value<00:04:48.640> was<00:04:49.110> negative<00:04:50.110> fifteen

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:50.680 
the expected value was negative fifteen

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:54.090 
the expected value was negative fifteen
cents<00:04:50.980> to<00:04:51.100> the<00:04:51.160> first<00:04:51.430> player<00:04:51.700> and<00:04:52.890> that's<00:04:53.890> not

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:54.100 
cents to the first player and that's not

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:55.890 
cents to the first player and that's not
that's<00:04:54.400> not<00:04:54.670> the<00:04:54.790> value<00:04:55.210> in<00:04:55.300> that<00:04:55.390> case<00:04:55.630> that's

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:55.900 
that's not the value in that case that's

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.980 
that's not the value in that case that's
simply<00:04:56.170> the<00:04:56.200> expected<00:04:56.980> value<00:04:57.730> so<00:04:58.000> the<00:04:58.450> value

00:04:58.980 --> 00:04:58.990 
simply the expected value so the value

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:00.930 
simply the expected value so the value
plain<00:04:59.350> ol<00:04:59.530> value<00:05:00.100> that's<00:05:00.400> sort<00:05:00.730> of<00:05:00.790> the

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:00.940 
plain ol value that's sort of the

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:03.510 
plain ol value that's sort of the
optimal<00:05:01.630> case<00:05:02.170> situation<00:05:02.680> when<00:05:03.280> you<00:05:03.340> talk

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:03.520 
optimal case situation when you talk

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.300 
optimal case situation when you talk
about<00:05:03.550> the<00:05:03.910> value<00:05:04.440> okay<00:05:05.440> and<00:05:05.620> this<00:05:05.710> is<00:05:05.830> what's

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:06.310 
about the value okay and this is what's

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:08.430 
about the value okay and this is what's
known<00:05:06.370> as<00:05:06.580> the<00:05:06.610> security<00:05:07.480> level<00:05:07.810> for<00:05:08.020> both<00:05:08.170> R

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:08.440 
known as the security level for both R

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:14.640 
known as the security level for both R
and<00:05:08.770> C<00:05:09.360> so<00:05:11.340> any<00:05:12.340> strategies<00:05:13.150> P<00:05:13.990> star<00:05:14.260> and<00:05:14.290> Q

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:14.650 
and C so any strategies P star and Q

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:16.650 
and C so any strategies P star and Q
star<00:05:14.830> that<00:05:15.070> satisfy<00:05:15.670> these<00:05:15.730> inequalities<00:05:16.120> or

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:16.660 
star that satisfy these inequalities or

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:18.720 
star that satisfy these inequalities or
what<00:05:16.900> are<00:05:17.020> known<00:05:17.110> as<00:05:17.170> optimal<00:05:17.890> strategies<00:05:18.430> so

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:18.730 
what are known as optimal strategies so

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:19.920 
what are known as optimal strategies so
if<00:05:18.820> you<00:05:18.940> can<00:05:19.060> satisfy<00:05:19.240> these<00:05:19.690> inequalities

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:19.930 
if you can satisfy these inequalities

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:22.740 
if you can satisfy these inequalities
you're<00:05:20.890> playing<00:05:21.220> you're<00:05:21.970> playing<00:05:22.000> the<00:05:22.570> best

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:22.750 
you're playing you're playing the best

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:25.860 
you're playing you're playing the best
strategies<00:05:23.350> and<00:05:23.730> if<00:05:24.730> the<00:05:24.910> value<00:05:25.360> of<00:05:25.540> the<00:05:25.660> game

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:25.870 
strategies and if the value of the game

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:27.930 
strategies and if the value of the game
equals<00:05:26.380> zero<00:05:26.770> well<00:05:27.130> then<00:05:27.280> then<00:05:27.580> we<00:05:27.700> say<00:05:27.820> the

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:27.940 
equals zero well then then we say the

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:32.760 
equals zero well then then we say the
game<00:05:28.120> is<00:05:28.300> fair<00:05:28.780> okay<00:05:30.360> all<00:05:31.360> right<00:05:31.600> so<00:05:31.990> so<00:05:32.740> a

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:32.770 
game is fair okay all right so so a

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:34.830 
game is fair okay all right so so a
second<00:05:33.100> ago<00:05:33.280> our<00:05:33.550> expected<00:05:33.940> value<00:05:34.090> again<00:05:34.630> was

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:34.840 
second ago our expected value again was

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:37.620 
second ago our expected value again was
negative<00:05:35.380> fifteen<00:05:35.920> cents<00:05:36.400> per<00:05:36.670> game<00:05:36.910> that

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:37.630 
negative fifteen cents per game that

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:39.060 
negative fifteen cents per game that
doesn't<00:05:37.900> mean<00:05:38.020> that<00:05:38.050> the<00:05:38.230> game<00:05:38.410> is<00:05:38.560> not<00:05:38.590> fair

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:39.070 
doesn't mean that the game is not fair

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:40.380 
doesn't mean that the game is not fair
because<00:05:39.310> again<00:05:39.700> we<00:05:39.850> haven't<00:05:40.060> necessarily

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:40.390 
because again we haven't necessarily

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:44.420 
because again we haven't necessarily
found<00:05:41.170> the<00:05:41.380> optimal<00:05:42.160> strategies<00:05:42.880> yet<00:05:43.300> okay<00:05:43.840> so

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:44.430 
found the optimal strategies yet okay so

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:51.060 
found the optimal strategies yet okay so
a<00:05:45.720> couple<00:05:46.720> other<00:05:47.220> remarks<00:05:48.220> here<00:05:49.830> first<00:05:50.830> off

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:51.070 
a couple other remarks here first off

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:53.370 
a couple other remarks here first off
what<00:05:51.640> are<00:05:51.670> these<00:05:51.880> two<00:05:52.060> inequalities<00:05:52.270> say<00:05:53.110> it

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:53.380 
what are these two inequalities say it

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:55.620 
what are these two inequalities say it
says<00:05:53.950> the<00:05:54.130> fundamental<00:05:54.700> theorem<00:05:55.090> states<00:05:55.510> that

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:55.630 
says the fundamental theorem states that

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:58.410 
says the fundamental theorem states that
for<00:05:55.750> every<00:05:56.050> matrix<00:05:56.560> game<00:05:57.070> there's<00:05:57.640> optimal

00:05:58.410 --> 00:05:58.420 
for every matrix game there's optimal

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:01.440 
for every matrix game there's optimal
strategies<00:05:59.080> for<00:05:59.760> the<00:06:00.760> row<00:06:00.940> player<00:06:01.210> in<00:06:01.360> the

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:01.450 
strategies for the row player in the

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:05.610 
strategies for the row player in the
column<00:06:01.840> player<00:06:02.110> and<00:06:02.410> a<00:06:02.980> unique<00:06:03.280> value<00:06:03.730> V<00:06:04.620> you

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:05.620 
column player and a unique value V you

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:07.560 
column player and a unique value V you
know<00:06:05.650> finding<00:06:06.220> these<00:06:06.340> optimal<00:06:06.940> strategies

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:07.570 
know finding these optimal strategies

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:10.140 
know finding these optimal strategies
and<00:06:07.840> that<00:06:07.960> corresponding<00:06:08.710> value<00:06:09.070> V<00:06:09.340> we<00:06:09.850> say

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:10.150 
and that corresponding value V we say

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:12.540 
and that corresponding value V we say
once<00:06:10.540> we've<00:06:10.690> done<00:06:10.870> that<00:06:10.930> we<00:06:11.350> we've<00:06:11.800> solved<00:06:12.400> the

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:12.550 
once we've done that we we've solved the

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:15.630 
once we've done that we we've solved the
game<00:06:12.730> or<00:06:13.000> that's<00:06:13.270> solving<00:06:13.750> the<00:06:13.960> game<00:06:14.190> so<00:06:15.190> the

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:15.640 
game or that's solving the game so the

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:18.360 
game or that's solving the game so the
triplet<00:06:16.120> so<00:06:16.450> once<00:06:16.660> we<00:06:16.810> know<00:06:16.840> the<00:06:17.170> value<00:06:17.320> V<00:06:17.590> the

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:18.370 
triplet so once we know the value V the

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:21.120 
triplet so once we know the value V the
the<00:06:18.700> strategies<00:06:19.360> P<00:06:19.600> star<00:06:19.870> and<00:06:19.900> Q<00:06:20.350> star<00:06:20.590> that's

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:21.130 
the strategies P star and Q star that's

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:24.480 
the strategies P star and Q star that's
called<00:06:21.460> the<00:06:21.640> solution<00:06:22.360> of<00:06:22.450> the<00:06:22.570> game<00:06:23.310> so<00:06:24.310> again

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:24.490 
called the solution of the game so again

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:26.100 
called the solution of the game so again
using<00:06:24.670> the<00:06:24.880> notation<00:06:25.120> we<00:06:25.390> had<00:06:25.540> earlier<00:06:25.960> it

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:26.110 
using the notation we had earlier it

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:28.800 
using the notation we had earlier it
says<00:06:26.440> the<00:06:27.190> expected<00:06:27.700> value<00:06:28.150> using<00:06:28.690> these

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:28.810 
says the expected value using these

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:31.470 
says the expected value using these
strategies<00:06:29.020> P<00:06:29.770> star<00:06:30.070> and<00:06:30.100> Q<00:06:30.610> star<00:06:30.880> well<00:06:31.360> to

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:31.480 
strategies P star and Q star well to

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:33.330 
strategies P star and Q star well to
compute<00:06:31.810> that<00:06:31.960> again<00:06:32.350> we<00:06:32.500> saw<00:06:32.980> at<00:06:33.070> the<00:06:33.160> very

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:33.340 
compute that again we saw at the very

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:34.770 
compute that again we saw at the very
beginning<00:06:33.760> we<00:06:33.910> could<00:06:34.060> just<00:06:34.150> take<00:06:34.300> P<00:06:34.540> star

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:34.780 
beginning we could just take P star

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:36.210 
beginning we could just take P star
multiplied<00:06:35.320> by<00:06:35.500> M

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:36.220 
multiplied by M

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:39.750 
multiplied by M
apply<00:06:36.370> by<00:06:36.580> q-star<00:06:37.090> and<00:06:37.300> that'll<00:06:37.570> give<00:06:37.690> us<00:06:37.750> V<00:06:38.760> so

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:39.760 
apply by q-star and that'll give us V so

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:42.930 
apply by q-star and that'll give us V so
the<00:06:39.880> big<00:06:40.060> question<00:06:40.300> is<00:06:40.980> and<00:06:41.980> this<00:06:42.370> is<00:06:42.580> now

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:42.940 
the big question is and this is now

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:46.080 
the big question is and this is now
actually<00:06:43.600> the<00:06:43.960> the<00:06:44.890> interesting<00:06:45.580> stuff<00:06:45.790> that

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:46.090 
actually the the interesting stuff that

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:47.280 
actually the the interesting stuff that
we're<00:06:46.480> going<00:06:46.570> to<00:06:46.660> do<00:06:46.780> in<00:06:46.870> the<00:06:46.930> next<00:06:47.050> video

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:47.290 
we're going to do in the next video

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:49.410 
we're going to do in the next video
actually<00:06:47.800> computing<00:06:48.280> this<00:06:48.430> knowing<00:06:49.300> a

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:49.420 
actually computing this knowing a

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:52.700 
actually computing this knowing a
solution<00:06:49.930> exists<00:06:50.560> how<00:06:51.040> do<00:06:51.580> we<00:06:51.760> find<00:06:52.030> it<00:06:52.270> right

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:52.710 
solution exists how do we find it right

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:55.800 
solution exists how do we find it right
so<00:06:53.710> you<00:06:54.430> know<00:06:54.550> the<00:06:54.640> first<00:06:54.850> thing<00:06:55.060> obviously

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:55.810 
so you know the first thing obviously

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:57.540 
so you know the first thing obviously
knowing<00:06:56.350> that<00:06:56.560> a<00:06:56.590> solution<00:06:57.040> exists<00:06:57.430> is

00:06:57.540 --> 00:06:57.550 
knowing that a solution exists is

00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:00.030 
knowing that a solution exists is
important<00:06:58.290> but<00:06:59.290> once<00:06:59.560> we<00:06:59.710> know<00:06:59.830> that<00:07:00.010> a

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:00.040 
important but once we know that a

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:01.980 
important but once we know that a
solution<00:07:00.490> exists<00:07:00.970> how<00:07:01.420> do<00:07:01.480> we<00:07:01.690> go<00:07:01.870> about

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:01.990 
solution exists how do we go about

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:04.620 
solution exists how do we go about
finding<00:07:02.410> that<00:07:02.890> solution<00:07:03.460> and<00:07:03.610> it<00:07:04.270> turns<00:07:04.510> out

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:04.630 
finding that solution and it turns out

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:06.240 
finding that solution and it turns out
there's<00:07:04.870> some<00:07:04.990> different<00:07:05.320> techniques<00:07:05.530> so

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:06.250 
there's some different techniques so

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:08.610 
there's some different techniques so
we're<00:07:06.940> going<00:07:07.060> to<00:07:07.120> look<00:07:07.300> at<00:07:07.450> the<00:07:07.570> 2<00:07:07.750> by<00:07:07.900> 2<00:07:07.930> case

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:08.620 
we're going to look at the 2 by 2 case

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:10.110 
we're going to look at the 2 by 2 case
first<00:07:09.280> since<00:07:09.580> that's<00:07:09.730> what<00:07:09.850> we're<00:07:09.970> dealing

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:10.120 
first since that's what we're dealing

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:12.330 
first since that's what we're dealing
with<00:07:10.330> and<00:07:10.720> then<00:07:11.080> we'll<00:07:11.260> generalize<00:07:11.980> that

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:12.340 
with and then we'll generalize that

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:15.450 
with and then we'll generalize that
we'll<00:07:12.730> start<00:07:12.970> looking<00:07:13.180> at<00:07:14.010> makes<00:07:15.010> makes

00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:15.460 
we'll start looking at makes makes

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:18.870 
we'll start looking at makes makes
matrix<00:07:16.060> games<00:07:16.270> of<00:07:16.690> any<00:07:17.500> order<00:07:17.890> okay<00:07:18.310> so<00:07:18.820> again

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:18.880 
matrix games of any order okay so again

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:20.310 
matrix games of any order okay so again
obviously<00:07:19.060> the<00:07:19.600> math<00:07:19.810> can<00:07:20.050> get<00:07:20.140> a<00:07:20.170> little

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:20.320 
obviously the math can get a little

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:23.040 
obviously the math can get a little
crazy<00:07:20.620> so<00:07:21.010> the<00:07:21.730> more<00:07:21.970> general<00:07:22.390> ones<00:07:22.600> we<00:07:22.840> won't

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:23.050 
crazy so the more general ones we won't

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:25.800 
crazy so the more general ones we won't
use<00:07:23.290> huge<00:07:23.680> systems<00:07:24.190> or<00:07:24.670> use<00:07:24.970> huge<00:07:25.330> matrices

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:25.810 
use huge systems or use huge matrices

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:27.240 
use huge systems or use huge matrices
but<00:07:26.140> again<00:07:26.320> we<00:07:26.440> will<00:07:26.560> take<00:07:26.770> some<00:07:27.010> that<00:07:27.160> are

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:27.250 
but again we will take some that are

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:30.090 
but again we will take some that are
more<00:07:27.400> complicated<00:07:27.730> than<00:07:28.210> 2<00:07:28.540> by<00:07:28.690> 2<00:07:29.100> matrices

00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:30.100 
more complicated than 2 by 2 matrices

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:32.640 
more complicated than 2 by 2 matrices
but<00:07:30.820> again<00:07:31.030> let's<00:07:31.450> start<00:07:31.720> with<00:07:31.840> a<00:07:31.870> 2<00:07:32.080> by<00:07:32.230> 2<00:07:32.260> ones

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:32.650 
but again let's start with a 2 by 2 ones

00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:35.070 
but again let's start with a 2 by 2 ones
first
