 Hello, my name is open, France. 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:12.740
 Pleasure to be here with you, I would like 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:14.870
 today to present a little of my 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:17.030
 makeup work is a makeup 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:20.510
 where I like to use 

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:22.940
 different techniques mixing makeup 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:25.880
 such as using brushes and breaking 

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:26.720
 I hope you understand this work. 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.150
 thank you 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.910
 let's go the first step of this work 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:35.960
 is to hide the eyebrow and for this I 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:42.280
 I'll use the number 400 brush with it. 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:48.670
 we are applying a type of varnish 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:52.210
 on the brow so that it secure the 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:55.050
 skin such as using a vine brush to 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.050
 eyebrow 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:05.870
 the spatula we will apply gently 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.870
 over the eyebrow 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.930
 a wax 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:20.840
 now we make a mix of colors 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:26.780
 to achieve the skin tone of the 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:32.869
 our model with the use of fingers 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:37.030
 we apply the basis on this 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:37.030
 the axn on this mass 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:44.550
 and we are analyzing this texture 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:53.730
 to make it easier to hide the eyebrow 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:57.680
 I'm going to use oy g1 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:57.680
 mixed to white 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:07.110
 We'll be getting more bridge to 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.110
 apply phase 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.720
 in the most natural application 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:54.130
 I'm applying base on all skin 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:58.160
 using the same colors that were 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:03:02.030
 used to cover the eyebrow 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:06.010
 separately so that I can at the same time 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:10.900
 time to apply skin tones 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.900
 brighter tones 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:20.550
 as we apply the 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:22.080
 the desired hue or color for this 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:26.450
 job 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:34.250
 we are going to explore body anatomy 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:34.250
 giving more volume but giving up 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:43.109
 this base is a fund that we are 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:43.109
 preparing for us 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:53.650
 to start the process 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:57.579
 the color of the skin first I will fix 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:04:00.299
 some parts of the face with the colorless powder 

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:00.299
 number 10
