00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000 
saw the presentation of what it looked

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.270 
saw the presentation of what it looked
like<00:02:04.120> at<00:02:04.450> the<00:02:04.480> beginning<00:02:04.690> and<00:02:05.470> it's<00:02:05.890> mind

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 
like at the beginning and it's mind

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:07.920 
like at the beginning and it's mind
boggling<00:02:06.550> that<00:02:06.880> they<00:02:07.240> were<00:02:07.300> able<00:02:07.750> to

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:07.930 
boggling that they were able to

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:09.749 
boggling that they were able to
accomplish<00:02:08.380> what<00:02:08.830> they<00:02:08.950> were<00:02:09.009> able<00:02:09.160> to<00:02:09.310> show

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
accomplish what they were able to show

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:11.960 
accomplish what they were able to show
now<00:02:10.060> I<00:02:10.090> mean<00:02:10.450> it's<00:02:10.690> it's<00:02:10.960> absolutely

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
now I mean it's it's absolutely

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.330 
now I mean it's it's absolutely
incredible<00:02:12.970> and<00:02:13.330> I<00:02:13.870> think<00:02:14.470> it<00:02:14.620> will<00:02:14.680> expect<00:02:15.130> it

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
incredible and I think it will expect it

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.790 
incredible and I think it will expect it
to<00:02:15.460> be<00:02:15.580> a<00:02:15.610> showpiece<00:02:15.910> in<00:02:16.570> High<00:02:17.050> Point<00:02:17.320> for<00:02:17.500> many

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
to be a showpiece in High Point for many

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.880 
to be a showpiece in High Point for many
years<00:02:18.040> to<00:02:18.220> come<00:02:18.430> I<00:02:19.050> think<00:02:20.050> in<00:02:20.200> in<00:02:20.470> some<00:02:20.710> ways

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
years to come I think in in some ways

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.700 
years to come I think in in some ways
it's<00:02:21.250> setting<00:02:21.580> a<00:02:21.670> higher<00:02:21.850> standard<00:02:22.240> and<00:02:22.720> I

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:23.710 
it's setting a higher standard and I

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:26.520 
it's setting a higher standard and I
think<00:02:24.160> it's<00:02:24.340> going<00:02:24.610> to<00:02:24.670> I<00:02:25.390> think<00:02:25.870> raised<00:02:26.320> the

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
think it's going to I think raised the

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.450 
think it's going to I think raised the
bar<00:02:26.740> for<00:02:27.720> many<00:02:28.720> showrooms<00:02:29.290> around<00:02:29.680> the

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:30.460 
bar for many showrooms around the

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:33.210 
bar for many showrooms around the
highpoint<00:02:30.850> area
