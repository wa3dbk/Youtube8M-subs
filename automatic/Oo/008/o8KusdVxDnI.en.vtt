then<00:02:04.119> to<00:02:04.240> finish<00:02:04.390> off<00:02:04.720> the<00:02:04.899> head<00:02:05.159> we<00:02:06.159> want<00:02:06.340> to

00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:06.399 
then to finish off the head we want to

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:08.040 
then to finish off the head we want to
use<00:02:06.430> these<00:02:06.640> arch<00:02:06.940> pieces<00:02:07.420> so<00:02:07.600> that<00:02:07.630> we<00:02:07.840> have<00:02:07.869> a

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 
use these arch pieces so that we have a

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.509 
use these arch pieces so that we have a
nice<00:02:08.440> round<00:02:08.860> top<00:02:10.019> so<00:02:11.019> those<00:02:11.260> are<00:02:11.290> going<00:02:12.250> to<00:02:12.310> fit

00:02:12.509 --> 00:02:12.519 
nice round top so those are going to fit

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:15.660 
nice round top so those are going to fit
right<00:02:12.790> on<00:02:12.819> top<00:02:13.180> of<00:02:13.209> the<00:02:13.600> 1<00:02:13.750> by<00:02:13.930> 2<00:02:13.989> plates<00:02:14.530> and<00:02:15.370> we

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
right on top of the 1 by 2 plates and we

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.520 
right on top of the 1 by 2 plates and we
need<00:02:15.880> those<00:02:16.090> plates<00:02:16.510> because<00:02:16.810> even<00:02:17.380> though

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
need those plates because even though

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.040 
need those plates because even though
this<00:02:17.680> is<00:02:17.860> one<00:02:18.130> by<00:02:18.280> one<00:02:18.519> size<00:02:18.790> this<00:02:19.660> plate

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
this is one by one size this plate

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.110 
this is one by one size this plate
coming<00:02:20.410> off<00:02:20.530> the<00:02:20.680> side<00:02:20.950> is<00:02:21.250> actually<00:02:21.819> one

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
coming off the side is actually one

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.960 
coming off the side is actually one
plate<00:02:22.540> lower<00:02:23.100> intervention<00:02:24.100> so<00:02:24.700> we<00:02:24.760> have<00:02:24.880> to

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
plate lower intervention so we have to

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.479 
plate lower intervention so we have to
add<00:02:25.120> that<00:02:25.510> little<00:02:25.720> blade<00:02:26.140> at<00:02:26.260> the<00:02:26.350> bottom<00:02:26.739> so

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:27.489 
add that little blade at the bottom so

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:28.800 
add that little blade at the bottom so
that<00:02:27.519> we<00:02:27.700> can<00:02:27.880> make<00:02:28.209> sure<00:02:28.239> we<00:02:28.420> don't<00:02:28.600> have<00:02:28.690> any

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
that we can make sure we don't have any

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.370 
that we can make sure we don't have any
gaps<00:02:29.200> on<00:02:30.130> top<00:02:30.400> of<00:02:30.549> the<00:02:30.610> head<00:02:31.080> now<00:02:32.080> we<00:02:32.140> have<00:02:32.350> a

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
gaps on top of the head now we have a

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:35.070 
gaps on top of the head now we have a
ghost<00:02:32.650> with<00:02:32.920> the<00:02:33.250> porns<00:02:34.090> it<00:02:34.269> looks<00:02:34.450> like<00:02:34.660> so<00:02:35.019> to

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
ghost with the porns it looks like so to

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.750 
ghost with the porns it looks like so to
make<00:02:35.350> sure<00:02:35.500> we<00:02:35.739> cover<00:02:35.950> that<00:02:36.069> up<00:02:36.370> and<00:02:36.580> we<00:02:36.670> don't

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
make sure we cover that up and we don't

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.280 
make sure we cover that up and we don't
want<00:02:36.880> to<00:02:37.030> have<00:02:37.150> any<00:02:37.330> studs<00:02:37.630> we<00:02:37.810> want<00:02:37.959> a<00:02:38.019> smooth

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
want to have any studs we want a smooth

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.059 
want to have any studs we want a smooth
top<00:02:38.620> that's<00:02:38.920> why<00:02:39.040> we<00:02:39.100> use<00:02:39.430> a<00:02:39.730> 2<00:02:40.150> by<00:02:40.360> 2<00:02:40.680> roof<00:02:41.680> tile

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:42.069 
top that's why we use a 2 by 2 roof tile

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:47.250 
top that's why we use a 2 by 2 roof tile
and<00:02:43.590> we've<00:02:44.590> got<00:02:44.769> half<00:02:45.010> our<00:02:45.190> ghost<00:02:45.430> done<00:02:46.200> so<00:02:47.200> i'm

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
and we've got half our ghost done so i'm

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:48.660 
and we've got half our ghost done so i'm
guessing<00:02:47.440> at<00:02:47.650> this<00:02:47.799> point<00:02:48.069> you<00:02:48.340> guys<00:02:48.489> can

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
guessing at this point you guys can

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.039 
guessing at this point you guys can
probably<00:02:49.000> guess<00:02:49.150> what<00:02:49.359> the<00:02:49.480> rest<00:02:49.660> of<00:02:49.780> this<00:02:49.870> is

00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:50.049 
probably guess what the rest of this is

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:51.740 
probably guess what the rest of this is
going<00:02:50.170> to<00:02:50.230> be<00:02:50.350> for<00:02:50.620> these<00:02:51.010> are<00:02:51.280> going<00:02:51.459> to<00:02:51.579> be

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
going to be for these are going to be

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.060 
going to be for these are going to be
the<00:02:52.750> little<00:02:52.930> shrouds<00:02:53.380> that<00:02:53.650> come<00:02:53.769> out<00:02:53.890> of<00:02:53.920> the

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.070 
the little shrouds that come out of the

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:56.940 
the little shrouds that come out of the
bottom<00:02:54.310> of<00:02:54.430> our<00:02:54.519> ghosts<00:02:55.380> and<00:02:56.380> the<00:02:56.410> first<00:02:56.680> part

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
bottom of our ghosts and the first part

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:58.979 
bottom of our ghosts and the first part
I<00:02:57.100> like<00:02:57.310> to<00:02:57.459> do<00:02:57.609> is<00:02:57.820> since<00:02:58.269> these<00:02:58.450> two<00:02:58.510> by<00:02:58.930> two

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989 
I like to do is since these two by two

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:01.410 
I like to do is since these two by two
by<00:02:59.170> threes<00:02:59.620> are<00:02:59.799> a<00:02:59.829> little<00:02:59.980> stronger<00:03:00.370> than<00:03:01.239> the

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
by threes are a little stronger than the

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.069 
by threes are a little stronger than the
1<00:03:01.600> x<00:03:01.750> 2<00:03:01.780> x<00:03:01.989> 3<00:03:02.140> s<00:03:02.410> I<00:03:02.590> put<00:03:02.859> these<00:03:03.040> on<00:03:03.250> first<00:03:03.549> and

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:04.079 
1 x 2 x 3 s I put these on first and

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:06.180 
1 x 2 x 3 s I put these on first and
they're<00:03:05.079> going<00:03:05.230> to<00:03:05.290> go<00:03:05.440> on<00:03:05.590> either<00:03:05.799> side

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
they're going to go on either side

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.069 
they're going to go on either side
almost<00:03:06.880> looks<00:03:07.030> like<00:03:07.120> our<00:03:07.390> ghost<00:03:07.570> has<00:03:07.690> the<00:03:07.870> legs

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:08.079 
almost looks like our ghost has the legs

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:09.949 
almost looks like our ghost has the legs
right<00:03:08.290> now<00:03:08.350> but<00:03:09.040> ghosts<00:03:09.310> don't<00:03:09.400> have<00:03:09.640> legs

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
right now but ghosts don't have legs

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:11.789 
right now but ghosts don't have legs
we're<00:03:10.959> going<00:03:11.049> to<00:03:11.140> make<00:03:11.230> sure<00:03:11.290> we<00:03:11.500> have<00:03:11.620> these

00:03:11.789 --> 00:03:11.799 
we're going to make sure we have these

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:14.340 
we're going to make sure we have these
last<00:03:12.190> couple<00:03:12.459> pieces

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.350 
last couple pieces

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:16.350 
last couple pieces
we're<00:03:14.860> going<00:03:14.950> to<00:03:15.040> put<00:03:15.190> two<00:03:15.490> of<00:03:15.520> the<00:03:15.910> one<00:03:16.150> by<00:03:16.300> two

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:16.360 
we're going to put two of the one by two

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.770 
we're going to put two of the one by two
by<00:03:16.690> threes<00:03:16.990> in<00:03:17.290> front<00:03:17.680> to<00:03:17.890> cover<00:03:18.040> that<00:03:18.280> gap<00:03:18.780> and

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
by threes in front to cover that gap and

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:24.090 
by threes in front to cover that gap and
then<00:03:20.200> do<00:03:20.350> the<00:03:20.500> same<00:03:20.740> thing<00:03:21.040> in<00:03:21.280> the<00:03:21.340> back<00:03:23.100> once

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:24.100 
then do the same thing in the back once

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.340 
then do the same thing in the back once
you<00:03:24.190> get<00:03:24.310> that<00:03:24.430> last<00:03:24.640> piece<00:03:24.970> in<00:03:25.270> you<00:03:26.230> have

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:26.350
