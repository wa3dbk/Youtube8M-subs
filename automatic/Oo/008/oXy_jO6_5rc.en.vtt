punk<00:00:46.980> hazard<00:00:47.219> and<00:00:47.579> maybe<00:00:48.329> it'll<00:00:48.719> come<00:00:48.899> out

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
punk hazard and maybe it'll come out

2014<00:00:49.710> early<00:00:50.070> 2014<00:00:50.430> and<00:00:50.850> we<00:00:50.940> might<00:00:51.149> have<00:00:51.360> one

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
2014 early 2014 and we might have one

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.720 
2014 early 2014 and we might have one
more<00:00:51.899> arc<00:00:52.110> so<00:00:52.500> that'll<00:00:52.739> be<00:00:52.829> three<00:00:53.160> arts<00:00:53.550> in<00:00:53.699> the

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
more arc so that'll be three arts in the

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.700 
more arc so that'll be three arts in the
new<00:00:53.940> world<00:00:54.149> not<00:00:54.809> to<00:00:54.989> mention<00:00:55.140> they<00:00:55.350> might<00:00:55.530> add

new world not to mention they might add

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.069 
new world not to mention they might add
a<00:00:55.980> Bundy<00:00:56.579> you<00:00:56.850> know<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.120> return<00:00:57.600> to<00:00:57.780> ship<00:00:57.930> on

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
a Bundy you know the return to ship on

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.770 
a Bundy you know the return to ship on
the<00:00:58.170> after<00:00:58.440> two<00:00:58.649> years<00:00:58.829> as<00:00:59.070> a<00:00:59.129> whole<00:00:59.609> map<00:01:00.539> or

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
the after two years as a whole map or

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.630 
the after two years as a whole map or
whatever<00:01:01.020> whole<00:01:01.289> stage<00:01:01.559> so<00:01:02.190> you'll<00:01:02.460> have

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
whatever whole stage so you'll have

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.160 
whatever whole stage so you'll have
about<00:01:02.879> roughly<00:01:03.300> right<00:01:03.510> now<00:01:03.600> we<00:01:03.660> have<00:01:03.840> four

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
about roughly right now we have four

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.260 
about roughly right now we have four
different<00:01:04.470> things<00:01:04.890> as<00:01:05.129> far<00:01:05.489> as<00:01:05.580> content<00:01:06.030> for

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
different things as far as content for

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.539 
different things as far as content for
the<00:01:06.330> game<00:01:06.360> goes<00:01:06.780> that's<00:01:07.500> a<00:01:07.650> little<00:01:07.770> bit<00:01:08.010> shaky

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
the game goes that's a little bit shaky

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.760 
the game goes that's a little bit shaky
because<00:01:08.670> you<00:01:09.000> know<00:01:09.150> only<00:01:09.840> four<00:01:10.380> different

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
because you know only four different

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.469 
because you know only four different
levels<00:01:11.100> hopefully<00:01:12.030> what<00:01:12.180> they're<00:01:12.299> going<00:01:12.420> to

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
levels hopefully what they're going to

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.289 
levels hopefully what they're going to
do<00:01:12.689> is<00:01:12.930> I<00:01:13.200> could<00:01:13.860> probably<00:01:14.189> say<00:01:14.400> like<00:01:14.549> this<00:01:14.729> the

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
do is I could probably say like this the

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:16.910 
do is I could probably say like this the
return<00:01:15.630> sister<00:01:15.900> Bundy<00:01:16.170> will<00:01:16.290> be<00:01:16.380> holding<00:01:16.619> up

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
return sister Bundy will be holding up

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.039 
return sister Bundy will be holding up
map<00:01:17.159> may<00:01:17.850> be<00:01:17.909> going<00:01:18.210> down<00:01:18.299> a<00:01:18.450> Fishman<00:01:18.930> Island

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
map may be going down a Fishman Island

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.630 
map may be going down a Fishman Island
will<00:01:19.290> be<00:01:19.380> another<00:01:19.619> one<00:01:19.890> just<00:01:20.220> being<00:01:20.460> on<00:01:20.610> the

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
will be another one just being on the

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:21.830 
will be another one just being on the
ship<00:01:20.970> and<00:01:21.000> a<00:01:21.270> bunch<00:01:21.450> of<00:01:21.570> sea<00:01:21.810> monsters

hazard if you know best case scenario we

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.330 
hazard if you know best case scenario we

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
have one more arc that there will be

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.310 
have one more arc that there will be
that<00:01:56.790> particular<00:01:57.390> arc<00:01:57.570> and<00:01:57.689> maybe<00:01:57.840> filler<00:01:58.170> in

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
that particular arc and maybe filler in

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.130 
that particular arc and maybe filler in
between<00:01:58.680> so<00:01:59.369> with<00:01:59.909> that<00:02:00.119> limited<00:02:00.810> amount<00:02:01.079> of

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
between so with that limited amount of

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.080 
between so with that limited amount of
content<00:02:01.590> I'm<00:02:01.829> guessing<00:02:02.460> what<00:02:02.579> they<00:02:02.700> might<00:02:02.909> do

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
content I'm guessing what they might do

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.539 
content I'm guessing what they might do
is<00:02:03.240> maybe<00:02:03.840> and<00:02:04.560> this<00:02:04.740> is<00:02:04.890> wishful<00:02:05.100> thinking

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
is maybe and this is wishful thinking

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.449 
is maybe and this is wishful thinking
but<00:02:05.670> maybe<00:02:06.479> they'll<00:02:07.290> throw<00:02:07.590> in<00:02:07.799> film<00:02:08.190> Z

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
but maybe they'll throw in film Z

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.160 
but maybe they'll throw in film Z
whatever<00:02:08.729> happens<00:02:09.060> in<00:02:09.149> film<00:02:09.360> Z<00:02:09.629> as<00:02:09.750> well<00:02:09.989> in

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
whatever happens in film Z as well in

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.990 
whatever happens in film Z as well in
there<00:02:10.349> as<00:02:10.500> a<00:02:10.530> map<00:02:10.800> that'll<00:02:11.400> be<00:02:11.489> a<00:02:11.520> huge<00:02:11.700> thing

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
there as a map that'll be a huge thing

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.190 
there as a map that'll be a huge thing
if<00:02:12.180> they<00:02:12.300> do<00:02:12.420> that<00:02:12.599> oh

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
if they do that oh

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.410 
if they do that oh
so<00:02:13.739> excited<00:02:14.280> but<00:02:14.400> it<00:02:14.550> also<00:02:14.700> be<00:02:15.030> spoilers

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
so excited but it also be spoilers

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:16.610 
so excited but it also be spoilers
because<00:02:15.629> we'll<00:02:15.780> probably<00:02:15.810> get<00:02:16.140> that<00:02:16.290> game

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
because we'll probably get that game

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.250 
because we'll probably get that game
before<00:02:17.069> we<00:02:17.400> even<00:02:17.489> get<00:02:17.700> film<00:02:17.970> Z<00:02:18.239> who<00:02:18.420> knows<00:02:18.599> so

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
before we even get film Z who knows so

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.369 
before we even get film Z who knows so
either<00:02:19.830> way<00:02:20.129> I'm<00:02:20.400> still<00:02:20.849> really<00:02:21.000> excited<00:02:21.569> what

00:02:25.369 --> 00:02:25.379 
which would have been nice even if

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:26.360
