00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.789 
right obviously the more points you're
going<00:01:29.909> to<00:01:30.119> get<00:01:30.299> if<00:01:30.570> you<00:01:31.140> answer<00:01:31.409> one<00:01:31.650> or<00:01:31.680> two

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
going to get if you answer one or two

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.649 
going to get if you answer one or two
questions<00:01:32.460> right<00:01:32.880> then<00:01:33.150> you're<00:01:33.270> going<00:01:33.420> to<00:01:33.509> get

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
questions right then you're going to get

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.690 
questions right then you're going to get
one<00:01:33.869> extra<00:01:34.380> point<00:01:34.530> if<00:01:34.829> you<00:01:34.950> answer<00:01:35.220> three<00:01:35.579> or

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
one extra point if you answer three or

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:36.800 
one extra point if you answer three or
four<00:01:35.909> you're<00:01:36.150> going<00:01:36.360> to<00:01:36.450> get<00:01:36.600> two<00:01:36.780> extra

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
four you're going to get two extra

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.170 
four you're going to get two extra
points<00:01:37.290> and<00:01:37.590> if<00:01:38.130> you<00:01:38.250> answer<00:01:38.610> five<00:01:38.820> correct

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
points and if you answer five correct

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.310 
points and if you answer five correct
you're<00:01:39.329> gonna<00:01:39.420> get<00:01:39.570> three<00:01:39.750> extra<00:01:39.960> points

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
you're gonna get three extra points

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.569 
you're gonna get three extra points
that's<00:01:40.470> all<00:01:40.680> of<00:01:40.829> them<00:01:40.920> by<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.130> way<00:01:41.310> in<00:01:41.430> one

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
that's all of them by the way in one

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.310 
that's all of them by the way in one
round<00:01:41.790> so<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.360> reason<00:01:42.600> I<00:01:42.689> say<00:01:42.869> extra<00:01:43.259> is

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
round so the reason I say extra is

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.810 
round so the reason I say extra is
because<00:01:43.590> these<00:01:43.710> are<00:01:43.770> not<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.340> only<00:01:44.490> points

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
because these are not the only points

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.429 
because these are not the only points
you<00:01:44.880> get<00:01:45.000> on<00:01:45.119> perc<00:01:45.329> pop<00:01:45.509> quiz<00:01:45.780> you<00:01:45.990> also<00:01:46.170> earn
