00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
will actually move to but it doesn't

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:47.720 
will actually move to but it doesn't
work<00:00:41.250> on<00:00:41.520> flat<00:00:41.730> surfaces<00:00:43.760> because<00:00:46.460> don't<00:00:47.460> know

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
work on flat surfaces because don't know

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:57.600 
work on flat surfaces because don't know
 sure<00:00:53.510> it's

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:57.610 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:06.390 

see<00:00:58.330> it's<00:00:58.690> not<00:00:58.960> actually<00:00:59.590> moving<00:01:04.650> but<00:01:05.650> now<00:01:06.340> it

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:06.400 
see it's not actually moving but now it

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:14.120 
see it's not actually moving but now it
is<00:01:06.580> oh<00:01:09.450> now<00:01:10.500> this<00:01:11.500> I<00:01:11.830> think<00:01:11.920> is<00:01:12.130> really<00:01:12.840> cool

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
is oh now this I think is really cool

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.710 
is oh now this I think is really cool
not<00:01:15.130> just<00:01:15.400> because<00:01:15.610> of<00:01:15.790> this<00:01:16.060> I<00:01:16.300> think<00:01:16.420> the

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:16.720 
not just because of this I think the

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.140 
not just because of this I think the
college<00:01:17.140> screams<00:01:17.380> pretty<00:01:17.650> cool<00:01:17.970> let's<00:01:18.970> go<00:01:19.090> to

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:19.150 
college screams pretty cool let's go to

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:24.630 
college screams pretty cool let's go to
this<00:01:19.300> riding<00:01:19.870> here<00:01:20.310> and<00:01:21.840> it's<00:01:23.250> fairly<00:01:24.250> well

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.640 
this riding here and it's fairly well

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.120 
this riding here and it's fairly well
detailed<00:01:25.210> besides<00:01:25.930> the<00:01:26.290> driver's<00:01:26.890> cockpit

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 
detailed besides the driver's cockpit

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.100 
detailed besides the driver's cockpit
which<00:01:27.610> I<00:01:27.760> think<00:01:27.970> they<00:01:28.120> could<00:01:28.420> have<00:01:28.479> done<00:01:28.690> a<00:01:28.720> lot

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.110 
which I think they could have done a lot

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:32.520 
which I think they could have done a lot
better<00:01:29.170> on<00:01:29.530> I<00:01:29.860> mean<00:01:30.610> that's<00:01:30.790> rubbish<00:01:31.380> that<00:01:32.380> is

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530 
better on I mean that's rubbish that is

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.120 
better on I mean that's rubbish that is
actually<00:01:32.680> really<00:01:33.250> badly<00:01:33.640> done<00:01:34.710> it's<00:01:35.710> just<00:01:35.979> got

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.130 
actually really badly done it's just got

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.010 
actually really badly done it's just got
like<00:01:36.280> sort<00:01:36.460> of<00:01:36.520> this<00:01:36.670> driver's<00:01:37.300> head<00:01:37.479> sticking

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020
