in the remaining part of this film will

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:30.190 
in the remaining part of this film will
do<00:03:27.750> one<00:03:27.989> more<00:03:28.019> experiment<00:03:28.890> to<00:03:29.370> do<00:03:29.489> with<00:03:29.640> time

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 
do one more experiment to do with time

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.600 
do one more experiment to do with time
then<00:03:31.200> we'll<00:03:31.379> look<00:03:31.500> into<00:03:31.739> how<00:03:32.010> consciousness

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610 
then we'll look into how consciousness

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:35.509 
then we'll look into how consciousness
about<00:03:33.060> private<00:03:33.510> self<00:03:33.810> is<00:03:34.290> a<00:03:34.349> normal<00:03:34.920> stage<00:03:35.280> of

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150 
if we want to know what time it is then

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:52.780 
if we want to know what time it is then
we<00:03:50.269> might<00:03:50.420> look<00:03:50.599> at<00:03:50.720> our<00:03:50.840> watches<00:03:51.079> I<00:03:51.610> can<00:03:52.610> see
