00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:08.400
 hello that's all you want to talk to him 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:09.900
 of a little older than 5 years old and 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.150
 watch TV that sometimes happens 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.790
 a little at least the most unexpected it's 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.440
 internet do in the movie and that's 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.189
 the crucial moment he was finally the 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:23.789
 suspense is there and paf 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:26.490
 No, it's not a shaq, but yes 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.260
 he wants to talk about the advertisers I 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.730
 wanted to spend a little violence on 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.710
 show that all ads are faked 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.809
 yes all I'm sure you are 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.070
 agree with me activities for the purpose 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.840
 is to encourage consumers to 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.260
 use the products or services 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.640
 prison days incite the camp this morning 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.260
 to use the products of the company 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.730
 yes of course but I think that 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.590
 often there is nothing to see 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.660
 for example an example the study for the 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.149
 fast food and sandwiches his joy there 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.449
 are not cooked they are all beautiful while 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.610
 clean 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.010
 the cheese it's not even his name then 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:59.190
 that you like 308 has the impression that the 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:03.049
 haunch xda above then that is not 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:05.700
 but the difference 

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:08.450
 it gives less envy what he sees on 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.140
 a photo then has the ads that 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:13.790
 personally I do not think they have 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.790
 no relation to the product 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:34.000
 m 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.000
 1 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
 and 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:44.930
 page where the tipping point where she 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:48.350
 sells ads for perfumes 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:51.530
 no but it's a big mystery still to 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.790
 no time can you say that bacchus 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.950
 and one sometimes that he tries to tend 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:02:00.650
 for jeans at the limit a man 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:02.960
 on the other hand but a pub that I thought 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:04.130
 thoroughly even ny are all hailed by 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.090
 against us guys it's the ad for 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.680
 shower videos and gels 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.600
 you know the three-letter mark 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.480
 yeah I can not say in fact the mark 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:13.490

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.880

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:20.170

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:22.250
 they put it all the same talking 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.750
 I do not know about you but for me 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.600
 it never worked 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.550
 and then finally there are people from 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.140
 pen or do you really wonder if the 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:33.830

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:25.150
 hours after he was on TV 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:28.330
 like the pub with the same singing to 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:30.250

 skull, that is, they will go to you 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.580

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:38.650
 a few seconds 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:40.270

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:43.120
 that now beaten can know that 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:44.860

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:03.650
 I saw a pile that will shock in the 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:06.200
 underground a pub with for slogan we did not 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:07.630
 not for principle to offer you a 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:11.510

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:24.410
 women 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:27.830
 that means they created a site where 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:28.910
 you could have cheated on her extra husband 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:29.270
 conjugal actually is when you are 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:30.560

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:33.919
 no, but it's still something 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:35.419
 who creates a site for you to dare to 

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:37.540
 simplify life when to search 

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:42.320
