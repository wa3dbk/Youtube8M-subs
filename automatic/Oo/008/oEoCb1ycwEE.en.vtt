okay<00:00:01.079> here's<00:00:01.350> something<00:00:01.620> I<00:00:01.770> found<00:00:02.040> very

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:02.220 
okay here's something I found very

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.260 
okay here's something I found very
interesting<00:00:03.140> John<00:00:04.140> Bedini<00:00:04.879> wants<00:00:05.879> us<00:00:06.000> to<00:00:06.029> take

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
interesting John Bedini wants us to take

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.410 
interesting John Bedini wants us to take
a<00:00:06.330> look<00:00:06.600> at<00:00:06.779> the<00:00:06.990> diodes<00:00:07.740> and<00:00:08.580> how<00:00:08.790> the<00:00:08.849> crystal

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
a look at the diodes and how the crystal

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.789 
a look at the diodes and how the crystal
and<00:00:09.750> a<00:00:09.929> diode<00:00:10.230> works<00:00:10.740> and<00:00:11.250> I<00:00:12.590> did<00:00:13.590> some

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
and a diode works and I did some

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.160 
and a diode works and I did some
research<00:00:13.980> on<00:00:14.429> it<00:00:14.490> today<00:00:14.969> and<00:00:15.299> there's<00:00:15.960> been<00:00:16.139> a

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
research on it today and there's been a

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.890 
research on it today and there's been a
lot<00:00:16.410> of<00:00:16.440> study<00:00:17.310> done<00:00:17.609> and<00:00:17.850> I've<00:00:18.000> studied<00:00:18.390> it<00:00:18.660> -

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
lot of study done and I've studied it -

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.220 
lot of study done and I've studied it -
on<00:00:19.199> just<00:00:19.980> an<00:00:20.130> LED<00:00:20.670> as<00:00:20.820> a<00:00:20.850> solar<00:00:21.210> cell<00:00:21.570> and<00:00:21.930> I

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
on just an LED as a solar cell and I

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.500 
on just an LED as a solar cell and I
tried<00:00:22.590> to<00:00:23.210> green-and-white

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
tried to green-and-white

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.849 
tried to green-and-white
that<00:00:24.930> I<00:00:24.960> found<00:00:25.260> out<00:00:25.410> a<00:00:25.470> red<00:00:25.830> a<00:00:26.160> red<00:00:26.820> LED<00:00:27.710> put<00:00:28.710> out

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
that I found out a red a red LED put out

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.150 
that I found out a red a red LED put out
that<00:00:29.099> much<00:00:29.160> voltage<00:00:29.820> under<00:00:30.029> load<00:00:30.800> in<00:00:31.800> direct

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
that much voltage under load in direct

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.830 
that much voltage under load in direct
sunlight<00:00:32.399> and<00:00:32.940> that's<00:00:33.329> what<00:00:33.570> on<00:00:33.690> this

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
sunlight and that's what on this

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.450 
sunlight and that's what on this
oscillator<00:00:34.469> and<00:00:34.710> you<00:00:34.770> can<00:00:34.890> hear<00:00:35.100> with<00:00:35.280> this

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
oscillator and you can hear with this

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:42.170 
oscillator and you can hear with this
radio<00:00:35.730> here<00:00:38.960> picks<00:00:39.960> up<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.290> radio<00:00:40.590> signal<00:00:41.180> if

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
radio here picks up the radio signal if

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.020 
radio here picks up the radio signal if
that's<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:42.719> loaded<00:00:43.410> voltage<00:00:43.649> on<00:00:44.640> that

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
that's the loaded voltage on that

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.709 
that's the loaded voltage on that
capacitor<00:00:45.239> right<00:00:45.989> there<00:00:46.610> with<00:00:47.610> this<00:00:47.820> red<00:00:48.149> LED

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
capacitor right there with this red LED

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.360 
capacitor right there with this red LED
in<00:00:48.899> direct<00:00:49.200> sunlight<00:00:49.500> I<00:00:49.890> can<00:00:50.100> vary<00:00:50.309> the

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
in direct sunlight I can vary the

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:58.779 
in direct sunlight I can vary the
frequency<00:00:50.640> here<00:00:55.190> over<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.309> loss<00:00:56.550> later<00:00:57.260> but

00:00:58.779 --> 00:00:58.789 
frequency here over the loss later but

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:01.160 
frequency here over the loss later but
let<00:00:59.789> me<00:00:59.879> show<00:01:00.059> you<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.300> voltage<00:01:00.510> here<00:01:01.020> when

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
let me show you the voltage here when

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:11.780 
let me show you the voltage here when
it's<00:01:01.289> unloaded<00:01:06.770> and<00:01:07.770> that<00:01:08.070> up<00:01:08.189> at<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.460> Sun

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:18.640 

that's<00:01:12.390> this<00:01:12.720> led<00:01:13.880> just<00:01:14.880> pointed<00:01:15.390> at<00:01:15.480> the<00:01:15.630> Sun

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:18.650 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.380 

and<00:01:19.650> it's<00:01:19.950> enough<00:01:20.250> to<00:01:20.430> run<00:01:20.610> that<00:01:20.790> oscillator

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
and it's enough to run that oscillator

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.660 
and it's enough to run that oscillator
here<00:01:22.290> that<00:01:22.470> winding<00:01:22.890> down<00:01:23.070> that's<00:01:23.460> how<00:01:23.550> I

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
here that winding down that's how I

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.470 
here that winding down that's how I
fished<00:01:24.060> this<00:01:24.390> little<00:01:24.660> oscillator<00:01:25.170> is<00:01:26.300> runs<00:01:27.300> in

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:27.480 
fished this little oscillator is runs in

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:31.430 
fished this little oscillator is runs in
the<00:01:27.600> micro<00:01:28.050> amps<00:01:29.840> basically<00:01:30.840> just<00:01:31.080> like<00:01:31.260> the

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:31.440 
the micro amps basically just like the

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.050 
the micro amps basically just like the
penny<00:01:31.680> oscillator<00:01:32.280> but<00:01:32.520> I'm<00:01:32.640> using<00:01:32.850> the

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
penny oscillator but I'm using the

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.830 
penny oscillator but I'm using the
different<00:01:33.480> coils<00:01:33.990> menhir<00:01:34.950> but<00:01:35.940> yeah<00:01:36.270> this<00:01:36.630> was

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
different coils menhir but yeah this was

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.260 
different coils menhir but yeah this was
quite<00:01:37.020> a<00:01:37.080> find<00:01:37.470> to<00:01:37.800> find<00:01:37.830> out<00:01:38.250> that<00:01:38.460> this<00:01:38.700> red

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
quite a find to find out that this red

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.140 
quite a find to find out that this red
LED<00:01:39.950> that<00:01:40.950> will<00:01:41.100> put<00:01:41.340> out<00:01:41.460> that<00:01:41.700> much<00:01:41.880> power

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
LED that will put out that much power

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.460 
LED that will put out that much power
and<00:01:43.250> run<00:01:44.250> a<00:01:44.310> rumble<00:01:45.120> oscillator<00:01:45.630> like<00:01:45.870> that<00:01:46.110> so

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
and run a rumble oscillator like that so

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.860 
and run a rumble oscillator like that so
I<00:01:46.680> tested<00:01:47.430> it<00:01:47.729> with<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:48.030> crystal<00:01:48.450> and<00:01:48.600> cell

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:48.870 
I tested it with the crystal and cell

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:50.630 
I tested it with the crystal and cell
and<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.740> only<00:01:49.950> thing<00:01:50.190> I<00:01:50.250> get<00:01:50.310> with<00:01:50.610> a

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
and the only thing I get with a

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.490 
and the only thing I get with a
crystalline<00:01:51.180> cell<00:01:51.450> is<00:01:51.750> an<00:01:51.930> increasing

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
crystalline cell is an increasing

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.250 
crystalline cell is an increasing
voltage<00:01:52.710> due<00:01:53.070> to<00:01:53.100> heat<00:01:53.430> that's<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:54.870> heating

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:55.260 
voltage due to heat that's the heating

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.490 
voltage due to heat that's the heating
of<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:55.410> Sun<00:01:55.800> but<00:01:56.100> I<00:01:56.280> didn't<00:01:56.640> get<00:01:56.729> this<00:01:57.000> effect

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
of the Sun but I didn't get this effect

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:03.620 
of the Sun but I didn't get this effect
like<00:01:58.500> this<00:01:59.240> with<00:02:00.240> this<00:02:00.479> Ally<00:02:00.960> you<00:02:02.270> so<00:02:03.270> anyway

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
like this with this Ally you so anyway

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:04.940 
like this with this Ally you so anyway
just<00:02:03.660> want<00:02:03.930> to<00:02:03.990> share<00:02:04.140> that<00:02:04.290> with<00:02:04.410> people<00:02:04.770> that

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
just want to share that with people that
