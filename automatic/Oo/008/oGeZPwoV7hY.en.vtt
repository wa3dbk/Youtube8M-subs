00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:13.349
 sweet and savory recipes hello to all like 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.450
 I had announced the new one today 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.630
 recipe will be spaghetti alla 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:21.380
 pizzaiola is an easy recipe to make 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.040
 good and it also shakes them a great success 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:26.070
 even with children 

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:28.920
 so as usual I leave you to the video 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.210
 and to the ingredients the ingredients that 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.249
 let's use for this recipe 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:36.570
 only parsley 1 garlic clove 

00:00:34.249 --> 00:00:37.859
 tomato puree in this case 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.809
 we use from tomato purÃ©e 

00:00:37.859 --> 00:00:45.269
 fresh then the cooking times will be 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:45.899
 reduced to the ideas of oregano and anchovy 

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:48.690
 in oil 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:53.640
 but what we do right away is to put 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:56.579
 water on the fire and then continue with 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:00.629
 the recipe ok now let's try 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:02.989
 off with the thought we use the 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.989
 Crescent moon 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:13.680
 once finished chopping the 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:22.380
 parsley and side we go to put 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:26.660
 the oil in a pan and we go to 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.660
 put in our used 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:36.330
 before going to light the fire e 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:38.100
 brown the mince we carry 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.590
 go ahead and let's avoid this 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:50.430
 case an anchovy to come 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:52.820
 pitted drips I recommend fairies 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.290
 be careful when chopping olives 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.119
 because in the end it could turn out later 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:00.510
 a treasure hunt in finding them for 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:02.190
 that they splash everywhere again 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:03.930
 decreed now we can go to 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:09.600
 light fire and brown the 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:11.940
 our previous used as soon as 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.940
 you will hear the sizzle means that to the 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:19.400
 time to go put has lived or 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.400
 better our tomato sauce 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:33.620
 you immediately see that it is fresh from the 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:33.620
 pompous and we mix everything 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:54.410
 now let's go put the tellers in it 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:54.410
 olives and acilia and a handful of oregano 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:04.740
 and let's mix very simple well 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.730
 to do in this research 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:09.520
 then now let's go to cook on fire 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.870
 low for salt not 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:14.500
 I believe there is that according to why 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:16.090
 since there are already olives, this is not the case 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:21.370
 I really think there is a need 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:22.690
 we know it's all we believe here they are 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.980
 to be naturally in the moment 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:37.230
 our spaghetti always the usual number 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:42.130
 54 people 320 grams and we turn immediately 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:45.730
 so do not attack ten minutes of 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:47.110
 our sub cooking is ready to remember 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:50.440
 of course we are talking about 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:54.460
 fresh tomato puree if so 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:57.690
 buy the sauces those already prepared there 

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:57.690
 they will also want 15 20 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:03.490
 now all we have to do is wait 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:05.890
 the pasta ok the pasta is ready let's go to 

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:09.640
 drain it and we travel this is the 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:16.600
 result of our spaghetti are 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:18.130
