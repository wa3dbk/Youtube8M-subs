00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.450
 meet totec shop on day link in 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:12.540
 description and there staff here is well lÃ©o 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:15.150
 to tech news and a study done 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:18.330
 by Oxford University said that 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.770
 playing videogame makes you a person 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.650
 best 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.140
 this study was done with children and 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:28.170
 according to him children who play videogame 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.230
 for an hour or so a day 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.500
 you run the risk of having a 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:36.329
 antisocial and will also be better 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:39.780
 students will be more stable 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.969
 emotionally and less aggressive 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.390
 so summarizing play an hour of play 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:47.430
 per day is good for your health 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.739
 let's say health mental health 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.920
 social and so on 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:55.770
 but this same study says that people 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.949
 who play video games for more than three 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:02.070
 hours or many hours end up having 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:05.479
 certain problems as they become more 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:10.710
 less aggressive and even 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:13.320
 hyperactive and the site is a very 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:16.890
 known outside a technology site 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:19.710
 and talks about several other issues he did 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.140
 a very cool video that summarizes all the 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:25.140
 events of all the films of the 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.509
 franchise fast and furious 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:31.920
 the video is about 10 minutes 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:35.130
 and makes this fun-funny summary of 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.470
 so it's really cool and the 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.570
 video link is the description for who 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.110
 I want to see the good that the coach just keep 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.329
 around here 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.899
 a big hug and until the next technician 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.899
 to 

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:54.810
 if you are an insult and are looking for 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:57.479
 by the network that helps your channel 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:00.709
 grow and also have good support 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:03.899
 I'll introduce you to the network. 

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:06.780
 is a network that I believe and is 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:08.819
 I trust and the network offers 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:12.120
 benefits mainly to those who are 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:14.370
 beginning and does not understand much of this 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.849
 network business it offers a 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:20.340
 minimum payment of $ 1 or is your 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:23.849
 car yields at least $ 1 per month 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:26.099
 You get that money something else. 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:29.069
 network has a temporary contract of 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:31.379
 three months you can click on the network 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:33.780
 for three months if you do not like it 

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:35.519
 only ask for them that they cancel 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.730
 your contract in case you want 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:43.560
 continue your contract is only one 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:45.510
 year and finally I find it more interesting 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.120
 the network has a contract in 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.859

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:53.670

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:55.889
 information on the network link and a video 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:58.400
 Talking a little bit more is going to be on the 

00:02:55.889 --> 00:02:58.400
