00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
trailer Murray has a little bit of a

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.380 
trailer Murray has a little bit of a
problem<00:02:55.170> going<00:02:55.560> on<00:02:55.830> but<00:02:56.220> even<00:02:56.760> in<00:02:56.910> its<00:02:57.060> artwork

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
problem going on but even in its artwork

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.750 
problem going on but even in its artwork

it still shows Bentley you know driving
it<00:02:59.850> so<00:03:00.000> it's<00:03:00.240> like<00:03:00.300> what<00:03:00.770> um<00:03:01.770> but<00:03:02.430> then<00:03:02.610> we<00:03:02.760> move

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
it so it's like what um but then we move

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:08.660 
it so it's like what um but then we move
on<00:03:03.120> to<00:03:03.270> Murray<00:03:04.130> Murray<00:03:07.070> this<00:03:08.070> smile<00:03:08.370> is<00:03:08.400> gonna

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
take a while to get used to it it's

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.680 
take a while to get used to it it's
starting<00:03:11.370> to<00:03:11.640> get<00:03:11.790> a<00:03:11.850> little<00:03:12.030> you're<00:03:12.570> not

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
starting to get a little you're not

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.320 
starting to get a little you're not
easier<00:03:13.110> to<00:03:13.320> see<00:03:13.470> but<00:03:14.190> this<00:03:14.700> is<00:03:14.760> probably<00:03:15.120> the

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
easier to see but this is probably the

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.670 
easier to see but this is probably the
most<00:03:15.510> jarring<00:03:16.020> design<00:03:16.620> I<00:03:16.650> think<00:03:18.110> but<00:03:19.110> in<00:03:19.440> terms

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
most jarring design I think but in terms

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.920 
most jarring design I think but in terms
of<00:03:19.800> the<00:03:19.890> voice<00:03:20.040> acting<00:03:20.550> it's<00:03:20.790> fantastic<00:03:21.780> you

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
of the voice acting it's fantastic you

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.050 
of the voice acting it's fantastic you

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:38.520 
sounds pretty close to the original and

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.970 
sounds pretty close to the original and
he<00:03:38.850> does<00:03:39.060> that<00:03:39.239> it's<00:03:40.050> kind<00:03:40.290> of<00:03:40.320> like<00:03:40.500> Ratchet

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
he does that it's kind of like Ratchet

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.300

one voice direction too boys wear it

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.850 
one voice direction too boys wear it
it's<00:03:45.180> different<00:03:45.540> but<00:03:45.900> it's<00:03:46.080> similar<00:03:46.440> enough

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:46.860 
it's different but it's similar enough

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:49.400 
it's different but it's similar enough
wearing<00:03:47.280> not<00:03:47.550> that<00:03:47.760> big<00:03:47.940> of<00:03:47.970> a<00:03:48.090> deal<00:03:48.330> so<00:03:49.110> I'm

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
going to use their like these in time

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:06.740 
going to use their like these in time
design<00:04:05.340> or<00:04:05.640> they<00:04:05.790> going<00:04:06.030> back<00:04:06.150> to<00:04:06.330> our<00:04:06.390> classic

but<00:04:44.730> actually<00:04:45.150> makes<00:04:45.300> me<00:04:45.450> really<00:04:45.630> wondering

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:45.990 
but actually makes me really wondering

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:49.100 
but actually makes me really wondering
if<00:04:46.169> a<00:04:46.320> jak<00:04:46.530> and<00:04:46.710> daxter<00:04:47.010> movie<00:04:47.280> gets<00:04:47.460> made<00:04:48.110> you

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.110 
if a jak and daxter movie gets made you

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:51.170 
if a jak and daxter movie gets made you
know<00:04:49.200> I'll<00:04:49.680> talk<00:04:49.890> more<00:04:49.950> about<00:04:50.220> because<00:04:51.030> I

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:51.180 
know I'll talk more about because I

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:52.970 
know I'll talk more about because I
think<00:04:51.510> since<00:04:52.140> they're<00:04:52.290> all<00:04:52.470> kind<00:04:52.770> of<00:04:52.800> these

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:52.980 
think since they're all kind of these

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:55.250 
think since they're all kind of these
origin<00:04:53.430> story<00:04:53.640> so<00:04:53.820> I<00:04:54.150> think<00:04:54.750> it<00:04:54.870> was<00:04:54.960> actually

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:55.260 
origin story so I think it was actually

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.290 
origin story so I think it was actually
have<00:04:55.350> to<00:04:55.470> start<00:04:55.740> a<00:04:55.860> jak<00:04:56.100> 2<00:04:56.460> because<00:04:56.970> you<00:04:57.210> know

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:57.300 
have to start a jak 2 because you know

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:58.850 
have to start a jak 2 because you know
in<00:04:57.450> the<00:04:57.540> first<00:04:57.720> game<00:04:57.900> gak<00:04:58.110> one's<00:04:58.350> gonna<00:04:58.530> mute

00:04:58.850 --> 00:04:58.860 
in the first game gak one's gonna mute

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:01.070 
in the first game gak one's gonna mute
so<00:04:59.220> and<00:04:59.790> the<00:04:59.940> store<00:05:00.120> doesn't<00:05:00.360> really<00:05:00.570> start

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.080 
so and the store doesn't really start

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.550 
so and the store doesn't really start
much<00:05:01.410> tell<00:05:01.770> Jack<00:05:02.100> to<00:05:02.130> zoom<00:05:02.990> probably<00:05:03.990> and<00:05:04.200> you

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:04.560 
much tell Jack to zoom probably and you

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.440 
much tell Jack to zoom probably and you

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:06.450 
like I am this horrible feeling that

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:08.600 
like I am this horrible feeling that
Sony's<00:05:06.960> trying<00:05:07.260> to<00:05:07.380> do<00:05:07.560> like<00:05:07.830> this<00:05:07.980> Avengers

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:10.290 
well that one still did I think have a

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:12.020 
well that one still did I think have a
little<00:06:10.620> bit<00:06:10.770> problems<00:06:11.280> with<00:06:11.520> the<00:06:11.700> 2d

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:12.030 
little bit problems with the 2d

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:13.490 
little bit problems with the 2d
animation<00:06:12.630> and<00:06:12.810> plus<00:06:13.020> they're<00:06:13.229> trying<00:06:13.410> to

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:13.500 
animation and plus they're trying to

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:14.719 
animation and plus they're trying to
make<00:06:13.590> this<00:06:13.710> go<00:06:13.919> for<00:06:14.100> a<00:06:14.130> much<00:06:14.280> more<00:06:14.460> mainstream

00:06:14.719 --> 00:06:14.729

00:06:14.729 --> 00:06:17.690 
make this go for a much more mainstream
audience<00:06:15.510> so<00:06:15.750> the<00:06:16.380> CG<00:06:16.740> was<00:06:16.979> probably<00:06:17.310> a<00:06:17.370> safer

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:17.700
