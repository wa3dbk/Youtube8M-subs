00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.659 

so<00:00:00.570> a<00:00:00.840> bit<00:00:01.079> about<00:00:01.230> computer<00:00:01.469> networks<00:00:02.070> first

00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:02.669 
so a bit about computer networks first

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.200 
so a bit about computer networks first
of<00:00:02.820> all<00:00:02.939> why<00:00:03.389> do<00:00:03.449> we<00:00:03.659> need<00:00:03.810> them<00:00:04.049> well<00:00:05.210> he's

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.210 
of all why do we need them well he's

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:07.880 
of all why do we need them well he's
happy<00:00:06.540> because<00:00:06.960> he's<00:00:07.140> got<00:00:07.319> access<00:00:07.680> to<00:00:07.859> a

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
happy because he's got access to a

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.440 
happy because he's got access to a
printer<00:00:08.160> that's<00:00:08.429> connected<00:00:08.820> to<00:00:08.940> his<00:00:09.059> computer

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
printer that's connected to his computer

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.589 
printer that's connected to his computer
he's<00:00:10.410> not<00:00:10.650> so<00:00:10.830> happy<00:00:10.980> because<00:00:11.340> he<00:00:11.610> hasn't<00:00:11.820> but

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
he's not so happy because he hasn't but

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.020 
he's not so happy because he hasn't but
if<00:00:12.840> his<00:00:13.320> computer<00:00:13.799> connected<00:00:14.160> up<00:00:14.309> to<00:00:14.340> the

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
if his computer connected up to the

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.910 
if his computer connected up to the
other<00:00:15.150> fellas<00:00:15.480> computer<00:00:16.049> then<00:00:16.619> he'd<00:00:16.770> have

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
other fellas computer then he'd have

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.650 
other fellas computer then he'd have
access<00:00:17.039> to<00:00:17.340> the<00:00:17.460> printer<00:00:17.850> as<00:00:17.910> well<00:00:17.970> and<00:00:18.359> that

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
access to the printer as well and that

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.200 
access to the printer as well and that
would<00:00:18.779> be<00:00:18.869> called<00:00:19.140> a<00:00:19.380> peer-to-peer<00:00:20.210> computer

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
would be called a peer-to-peer computer

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.849 
would be called a peer-to-peer computer
network<00:00:23.570> for<00:00:24.570> computer<00:00:24.960> networks<00:00:25.289> can<00:00:25.590> also

all<00:00:47.340> computers<00:00:48.120> will<00:00:48.780> be<00:00:48.809> connected<00:00:49.260> up<00:00:49.350> to<00:00:49.379> a

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
all computers will be connected up to a

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.490 
all computers will be connected up to a
big<00:00:49.860> computer<00:00:50.280> called<00:00:51.000> a<00:00:51.120> server<00:00:51.449> and<00:00:51.780> the

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
big computer called a server and the

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.770 
big computer called a server and the
server<00:00:52.579> would<00:00:53.579> store<00:00:53.879> everybody's<00:00:54.420> my

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
server would store everybody's my

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.500 
server would store everybody's my
documents<00:00:55.410> and<00:00:55.559> files<00:00:56.030> that<00:00:57.030> server<00:00:57.300> will<00:00:57.480> be

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
documents and files that server will be

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.900 
documents and files that server will be
backed<00:00:57.809> up<00:00:57.960> regularly<00:00:58.500> so<00:00:59.190> that<00:00:59.430> everybody's

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
backed up regularly so that everybody's

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.209 
backed up regularly so that everybody's
work<00:01:00.120> was<00:01:00.329> safe<00:01:00.600> just<00:01:00.899> in<00:01:01.500> case<00:01:01.710> that<00:01:01.890> server

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
work was safe just in case that server

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.820 
work was safe just in case that server
exploded<00:01:02.940> so<00:01:03.899> there's<00:01:04.049> another<00:01:04.290> benefit<00:01:04.680> of

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
exploded so there's another benefit of

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.530 
exploded so there's another benefit of
networks<00:01:05.189> to<00:01:06.590> different<00:01:07.590> network<00:01:07.890> layouts

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:08.540 
networks to different network layouts

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.880 
networks to different network layouts
there<00:01:09.540> are<00:01:09.659> some<00:01:09.810> of<00:01:09.900> them<00:01:10.020> but<00:01:10.350> by<00:01:10.530> far<00:01:10.860> the

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
there are some of them but by far the

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.000 
there are some of them but by far the
most<00:01:11.130> popular<00:01:11.369> these<00:01:11.729> days<00:01:11.790> is<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.720> bus

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:13.010 
most popular these days is the bus

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:18.230 
most popular these days is the bus
layout<00:01:14.010> and<00:01:14.570> most<00:01:15.830> networks<00:01:16.909> use<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.060> bus

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
layout and most networks use the bus

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.660 
layout and most networks use the bus
layout<00:01:18.600> to<00:01:19.439> have<00:01:19.590> what<00:01:19.770> is<00:01:19.799> called<00:01:20.040> Ethernet

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
layout to have what is called Ethernet

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.760 
layout to have what is called Ethernet
networking<00:01:21.119> where<00:01:21.780> we<00:01:21.869> use<00:01:22.020> category<00:01:22.530> 5

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
network and make it bigger talk a bit

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.950 
network and make it bigger talk a bit
about<00:01:55.740> this<00:01:56.100> thing<00:01:56.310> called<00:01:56.340> a<00:01:56.610> server<00:01:56.939> so<00:01:57.869> the

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
about this thing called a server so the

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.719 
about this thing called a server so the
server<00:01:58.170> is<00:01:58.350> a<00:01:58.380> really<00:01:58.680> big<00:01:58.890> computer<00:01:59.520> with

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
server is a really big computer with

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.910 
server is a really big computer with
lots<00:01:59.969> of<00:02:00.090> storage<00:02:00.420> space<00:02:00.590> to<00:02:01.590> store

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
lots of storage space to store

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.289 
lots of storage space to store
everybody's<00:02:02.369> files<00:02:02.840> but<00:02:03.840> also<00:02:04.219> manages

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:05.299 
everybody's files but also manages

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:09.949 
everybody's files but also manages
people's<00:02:06.299> logins<00:02:06.780> and<00:02:06.960> passwords<00:02:07.099> and<00:02:08.959> also

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
people's logins and passwords and also

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.420 
people's logins and passwords and also
manages<00:02:10.289> access<00:02:10.770> to<00:02:10.950> files<00:02:11.160> for<00:02:11.370> different

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
manages access to files for different

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.830 
manages access to files for different
people<00:02:11.730> so<00:02:11.970> some<00:02:12.120> people<00:02:12.239> can<00:02:12.420> access<00:02:12.690> some
