 The first chip is thickness 14 and 7 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.550
 millimeter is very very thin panel 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:55.439

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:04.420
 ambilight zone illumination that is, if 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.890
 Phones Phylo usually three zones 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:09.430
 ambilight backlights are side and 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:11.530
 the upper ones here are still 4 zones 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:14.050
 the lower zone of the telly can be hung on 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:16.180
 wall can put it on a special 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:19.690
 salute with a special transparent 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:21.880
 stand on the table and in both cases how 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.950
 us guys Filip said it turns out that 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.019
 the TV seems to be floating in the air 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.450
 This is when the whole world is turned off, but not 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:30.489
 often not among mixers we are and 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:33.370
 blender everyones and guys in jackets 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:35.260
 here of course there is no such effect here 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.090
 area for ordinary buyers here with 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.920
 a bunch of German rabid children this 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:40.630
 it is impossible to shoot the helico costs 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:43.799
 stand making as if floating in 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:43.799
 air looks pretty spectacular 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:49.819
 guys new philips ambilight 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:51.080
 the guys reviewed the concert with their bella 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:53.420
 it's a little bit better 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:54.830
 Naturally this is fashion chairs here 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:57.319
 and by the way the backlight control panel 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:59.269
 by all these matters and so beyond 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:00.379
 ambilight and by the way then TVs 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:02.450
 philips 

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:04.610
 elevation just that four zones on 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:06.620
 ambilight backlit now kim duytu 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:07.549
 you can sharpen when lights which 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:09.650
 called hill 

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:13.519
 philips Well, here they are right and left 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:14.930
 and the whole joke is that they can be 

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:17.840
 synchronized with ambilight backlight 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:20.600
 that is, let's say you sura is yes here 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:22.490
 yellow light green light and lights give 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:24.320
 about the same shade kelly shade 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:26.389
 similarity ambilight lighting so 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:28.280
 the way lanterns can be made as much 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:30.500
 it turns out fun 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:32.330
 similar pictures light for the whole room 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:34.760
 looks really impressive unfortunately 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:36.979
 an hour here until such a visualization is nothing 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:38.870
 this particular but we were shown 

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:44.139
 example and and lively it looks real 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:44.139
 not bad ambilight plus cue philips cues 

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:52.270
 and your up to the most interesting is philips 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:54.100
 designline this is telly and 2013 2014 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:56.260
 as you can see the philips guys are completely 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:58.180
 revised the concept of appearance 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:00.400
 their TVs are now on top of the panel 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:02.380
 is the glass that's how it all looks 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.420
 Naturally here all the same technology 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:06.520
 as the children of the 1000 series of televisions 

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:08.740
 philips and other models backlight 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:10.810
 ambilight smart and other stuff other 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:12.640
 we talked about this about 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:13.570
 three or four months ago, but they saw 

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:15.520
 only one diagonal 

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:18.370
 this is the biggest diagonal of 84 inches 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:20.470
 small diagonals appeared Vanya come here 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:24.200
 these look really good 

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:26.840
 they just put on the floor 

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:29.740
 leaning against the wall without any fasteners 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:30.890
 and perhaps watching TV is 46 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:34.840
 inches 

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:34.840
 yo tivi ambilight lights 

00:05:34.849 --> 00:05:38.749
 philips designline when it appears in 

00:05:36.649 --> 00:05:41.209
 the sale on not yet said but because 

00:05:38.749 --> 00:05:43.099
 diagonal already a lot of concept worked out 

00:05:41.209 --> 00:05:44.620
 I think this is a question of the nearest 

00:05:43.099 --> 00:05:46.930
 of time 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:50.100
 and I promise that it will be worth it 

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:50.100
 adequate money
