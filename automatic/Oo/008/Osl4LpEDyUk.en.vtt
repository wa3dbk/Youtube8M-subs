00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.350
 but I'll show you how to deny 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.350
 an external microphone added 95 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.800
 which is a great coi consider more interviews mainly number of 

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:14.109
 homeless 

00:00:14.109 --> 00:00:15.109
 Earth 

00:00:15.109 --> 00:00:16.039
 all 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:18.999
 that happens 

00:00:18.999 --> 00:00:21.119
 He comes with a car. 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.119
 after from here 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.849
 with these two tips 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:31.029
 This car is for you to turn your air on tv. 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:34.860
 come on say you understand 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.790
 - it also serves as input 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:38.920
 So 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.250
 if we look at cells 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.250
 the club in your home 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.250
 and if there is better to serve as microphone input 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:49.639
 I imagine that this 

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:53.699
 ie the default but I think it's worth a trial and error 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:59.590
 derby square any other triumph by 2 microphone arrow in my case was 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:00.800
 the first 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.900
 but I've seen other cultures out there that were 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.740
 by experience 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:07.090
 there 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.220
 We need a microphone. 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.220
 in the case of ebc which is a born idol 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:21.200
 for some reason I dedicate to the microphone and you need your active microphone be it 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.910
 need 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:25.120
 the files 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:30.100
 so if it came from the directional supplier it would break like those lapels 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.020
 also that children 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.880
 two vehicles were towed 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.980
 this kind here 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:41.980
 what would you say 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.640
 in another photo of him 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.630
 it's a change of scenery 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.880
 if you connect these networks 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.880
 in this 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.540
 to do this 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.540
 I had to use it for the actuators 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:02.240
 he will be 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.700
 on both sides 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.879
 click here 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.029
 this interest 

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:13.489
 three weeks 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:16.369
 in the league here 

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:18.849
 and then I was able to call 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:21.849
 microphone wire 

00:02:23.149 --> 00:02:24.569
 families 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:27.599
 There you will see 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:28.669
 the title 

00:02:28.669 --> 00:02:31.669
 if you respect 

00:02:33.679 --> 00:02:35.319
 our air 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:38.319
 he will ask if they are reservations stayed 

00:02:43.089 --> 00:02:46.089
 have to connect the microphone connects to the plateau 

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:50.449
 in the document 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:52.790
 elaine 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:53.650
 the option 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:54.819
 r7 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:58.819
 if the option does not appear stf gave something wrong have hurry this 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:01.819
 option and this option if you choose 

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:05.410
 I know this has worked out several times 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:09.270
 but this here is you that motto of fighter that of each month 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:15.109
 it is today to lose interviewees only here that the whole world today 

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:17.859
 exp. contact today with a squeak 

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:20.859
 so I threw all this out here 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:27.279
 was a foreign player who told him to do 

00:03:27.279 --> 00:03:29.739
 a solid path tinho 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:33.119
 here it enters here in the place in its vermelhinho 

00:03:33.119 --> 00:03:35.029
 and got out of the car 

00:03:35.029 --> 00:03:36.569
 direct 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:37.859
 on the microphone 

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:40.859
 no more fit will also be easier to load 

00:03:41.749 --> 00:03:43.959
 and this car here 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:46.959
 free from microphone 

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:50.699
 the cell phone 

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:53.569
 ef 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:55.709
 must be an option 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:57.309
 st 

00:03:57.309 --> 00:03:59.809
 And then I used it as 

00:03:59.809 --> 00:04:02.539
 with the microphone 

00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:03.259
 beneficent
