00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:38.300
 for this first refreshing drink that 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:42.289
 it looks great gravel we are going to 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:44.269
 need the following we are going to choose 

00:00:42.289 --> 00:00:47.269
 a glass of your preference the one that most 

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:50.880
 like and we will fill with the strawberries 

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:52.770
 amount in which you prefer 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:55.080
 after that we grabbed a spoon and 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:59.360
 we begin to crush it completely 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:01:02.190
 until it becomes a puree he cited something like that 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:04.080
 now we're going to take half of a 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.240
 lemon that will give you a very 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.570
 special to this drink 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:14.100
 Then sugar to your liking, I 'll take it as 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:17.250
 a teaspoon and a half and how not to 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.630
 to miss we are going to take water with gas if 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.400
 you do not have sparkling water you do not 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.520
 worry that you can also use the 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.730
 normal mineral water and tastes delicious 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.460
 same 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:31.100
 and finally we're going to throw the ice 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.720
 the amount you want and that 's it 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.780
 well list our refreshing drink 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:38.210
 to share it with our friends and 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:40.220
 our relatives really 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:43.360
 I recommend that you make this drink that 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.360
 it's great 

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:50.640
 for this second drink we need what 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:53.620
 following 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:59.650
 half an orange where we are going to 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:02:04.780
 squeeze it completely then we'll go 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:09.930
 to put the mint leaves and with a 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.930
 we are going to remove all its waters 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:23.820
 Now we put half a lemon and 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.820
 our ice 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:29.599
 now with the slices that we already had what 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:32.810
 what we are going to do is decorate our 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:35.540
 glass so you can do it before or 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:38.450
 after putting the ice that is your 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:41.780
 preference and the truth this is very 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:52.700
 pretty now we're going to take the water 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:55.940
 without gas and sugar to taste and ready it 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:59.480
 we move very well with the straw and what 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:02.380
 garnish with a slice of lemon and 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:05.299
 is our refreshing citrus drink 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:07.190
 The truth is that this is one of 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:09.560
 my favorite ones I love 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:12.700
 apart it looks very beautiful the oranges are 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.700
 you can eat them later 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:22.659
 I call this drink the tropical 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:24.939
 because we have combined all the fruits 

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:27.000
 that we had previously seen in 

00:03:24.939 --> 00:03:28.680
 refreshing drinks 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.260
 what we are going to need is a 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.390
 any container that you have and 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:36.080
 we will fill it with strawberry the amount 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:38.600
 that you want and need 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:39.110
 then we are going to throw the leaves of 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.460
 mint 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:47.030
 this so that to give a rich flavor 

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:54.140
 Now I have made the orange juice and 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:56.240
 we will squeeze it very well once 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:04:00.800
 ready that we're going to throw half of a 

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:04.520
 lemon and sugar to taste and now what 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:06.740
 we can put the blender once 

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:10.430
 it's ready that we're going to throw 

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:12.470

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:15.230
 decorate with lemon slices 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:21.320
 well washed by the way so we're going 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:24.500
 to put around our gas now 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:27.530
 let's throw our combination but 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:30.290
 you can choose to leave it like this or 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:31.910
 pour water or sparkling water in this 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:34.730
 case I decided to put water with gas 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:37.100
 because it tastes great and now I 'm going to 

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:39.410
 decorate very well and that's our 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:41.480
