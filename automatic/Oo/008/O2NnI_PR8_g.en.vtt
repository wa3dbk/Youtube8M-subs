00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
things about it but I to be honest the

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.619 
things about it but I to be honest the
reason<00:02:06.090> I<00:02:06.450> didn't<00:02:06.750> play<00:02:06.899> it<00:02:07.049> was<00:02:07.170> because<00:02:07.560> I

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:08.629 
reason I didn't play it was because I

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:11.930 
reason I didn't play it was because I
just<00:02:09.629> wanted<00:02:10.170> a<00:02:10.379> jack<00:02:10.739> I<00:02:11.039> just<00:02:11.340> wanted<00:02:11.610> a<00:02:11.700> jack

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
for I didn't understand why they

for I didn't understand why they
make<00:02:14.100> a<00:02:14.130> jack<00:02:14.370> for<00:02:14.580> but<00:02:15.300> yeah<00:02:15.930> i<00:02:16.110> know<00:02:16.800> we<00:02:17.160> have

my<00:02:17.970> brother<00:02:18.209> has<00:02:18.420> uncharted<00:02:18.990> 2<00:02:19.170> &amp;<00:02:19.560> 3<00:02:20.930> i'm<00:02:21.930> gonna

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
my brother has uncharted 2 &amp; 3 i'm gonna

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.260 
my brother has uncharted 2 &amp; 3 i'm gonna
say<00:02:22.380> so<00:02:22.980> there<00:02:23.220> may<00:02:23.370> be<00:02:23.400> a<00:02:23.580> point<00:02:24.000> where<00:02:24.150> i

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
say so there may be a point where i

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.900 
say so there may be a point where i
might<00:02:24.510> try<00:02:24.569> it<00:02:24.930> out<00:02:25.140> just<00:02:25.560> just<00:02:26.130> to<00:02:26.280> see<00:02:26.550> if<00:02:26.760> it

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
might try it out just just to see if it

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.850 
might try it out just just to see if it
what<00:02:27.330> everyone<00:02:27.720> says<00:02:27.930> is<00:02:28.080> true<00:02:28.230> about<00:02:28.410> it<00:02:28.740> and

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
what everyone says is true about it and

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.490 
what everyone says is true about it and
I<00:02:29.400> he<00:02:30.090> just<00:02:30.270> hit<00:02:30.390> me<00:02:30.510> with<00:02:30.630> a<00:02:30.660> level<00:02:30.990> one<00:02:31.200> so<00:02:31.470> i

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
I he just hit me with a level one so i

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.110 
I he just hit me with a level one so i
sort<00:02:31.920> of<00:02:32.040> need<00:02:32.160> to<00:02:32.310> get<00:02:32.430> my<00:02:32.520> act<00:02:32.700> together<00:02:32.850> and

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
sort of need to get my act together and

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.840 
sort of need to get my act together and
try<00:02:34.110> and<00:02:34.170> get<00:02:34.650> my<00:02:34.800> supers<00:02:35.250> up<00:02:35.400> on<00:02:35.550> him<00:02:35.700> these

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
try and get my supers up on him these

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:41.090 
try and get my supers up on him these
there<00:02:36.720> we<00:02:36.870> go<00:02:37.220> peacemaker<00:02:38.220> combo<00:02:38.730> that<00:02:39.620> the<00:02:40.620> up

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
there we go peacemaker combo that the up

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.220 
there we go peacemaker combo that the up
in<00:02:41.310> circle<00:02:41.670> for<00:02:41.820> that<00:02:41.910> peacemaker<00:02:42.450> gravity

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
in circle for that peacemaker gravity

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.650 
in circle for that peacemaker gravity
that's<00:02:43.500> really<00:02:44.430> hard<00:02:44.700> one<00:02:44.880> to<00:02:45.090> land<00:02:45.300> because

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
that's really hard one to land because

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.090 
that's really hard one to land because
you<00:02:45.720> have<00:02:45.750> to<00:02:45.900> be<00:02:46.020> like<00:02:46.170> in<00:02:46.320> a<00:02:46.410> really<00:02:46.830> close

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
you have to be like in a really close

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.699 
you have to be like in a really close
radius<00:02:47.580> and<00:02:47.790> then<00:02:48.270> to<00:02:48.390> get<00:02:48.510> off<00:02:48.660> the<00:02:48.930> the

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
radius and then to get off the the

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:52.490 
radius and then to get off the the
peacemakers<00:02:50.430> bomb<00:02:50.959> they<00:02:51.959> have<00:02:52.110> to<00:02:52.230> be<00:02:52.350> pretty

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
peacemakers bomb they have to be pretty

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.630 
peacemakers bomb they have to be pretty
much<00:02:52.769> diagonally<00:02:53.489> in<00:02:53.670> on<00:02:53.910> top<00:02:54.269> of<00:02:54.420> you<00:02:54.600> and

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
much diagonally in on top of you and

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.160 
much diagonally in on top of you and
that's<00:02:56.640> pretty<00:02:57.269> difficult<00:02:57.540> to<00:02:57.810> get<00:02:57.930> if<00:02:58.019> you're

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
that's pretty difficult to get if you're

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:59.990 
that's pretty difficult to get if you're
around<00:02:58.350> the<00:02:58.530> other<00:02:58.620> way<00:02:58.739> so<00:02:58.920> I'm<00:02:59.790> nearly

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
around the other way so I'm nearly

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.940 
around the other way so I'm nearly
creeping<00:03:00.360> up<00:03:00.450> on<00:03:00.510> a<00:03:00.600> level<00:03:00.810> one<00:03:01.140> and<00:03:01.170> it's<00:03:01.620> one

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
creeping up on a level one and it's one

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.610 
creeping up on a level one and it's one
minute<00:03:02.250> 30<00:03:02.580> I<00:03:03.060> think<00:03:03.660> we<00:03:03.750> do<00:03:03.870> i<00:03:04.140> think<00:03:04.440> i<00:03:04.470> did

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
minute 30 I think we do i think i did

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.020 
minute 30 I think we do i think i did
three<00:03:05.040> must<00:03:05.340> have<00:03:05.430> been<00:03:05.519> a<00:03:05.550> three<00:03:05.820> minute

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
three must have been a three minute

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.140 
three must have been a three minute
battle<00:03:06.269> but<00:03:06.680> anyway<00:03:07.680> we're<00:03:07.980> gonna<00:03:08.070> we've<00:03:08.970> got

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
battle but anyway we're gonna we've got

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.940 
battle but anyway we're gonna we've got
our<00:03:09.239> level<00:03:09.540> one<00:03:09.780> i<00:03:09.989> might<00:03:10.230> try<00:03:10.260> for<00:03:10.650> a<00:03:10.680> level

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
our level one i might try for a level

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.009 
our level one i might try for a level
two<00:03:11.160> the<00:03:11.760> best<00:03:12.030> thing<00:03:12.239> about<00:03:12.330> a<00:03:12.480> little<00:03:12.780> too

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019 
two the best thing about a little too

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:14.660 
two the best thing about a little too
with<00:03:13.200> this<00:03:13.290> costume<00:03:13.709> is<00:03:13.860> that<00:03:13.980> you<00:03:14.040> get<00:03:14.250> to<00:03:14.310> see

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
with this costume is that you get to see

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.530 
with this costume is that you get to see
the<00:03:15.630> jak<00:03:16.200> and<00:03:16.380> daxter<00:03:16.860> one<00:03:17.310> precursor<00:03:18.299> legacy

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
the jak and daxter one precursor legacy

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.979 
the jak and daxter one precursor legacy
Jack<00:03:19.140> as<00:03:19.410> dark<00:03:20.220> Jack<00:03:20.519> and<00:03:20.790> that's<00:03:21.750> actually

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
Jack as dark Jack and that's actually

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:25.670 
Jack as dark Jack and that's actually
really<00:03:22.380> cool<00:03:23.180> so<00:03:24.180> I<00:03:24.540> think<00:03:24.660> we<00:03:24.930> might<00:03:25.380> try<00:03:25.560> and

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
really cool so I think we might try and

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.110 
really cool so I think we might try and
hit<00:03:25.799> him<00:03:25.890> off<00:03:26.010> I<00:03:26.220> think<00:03:26.760> I<00:03:26.820> don't<00:03:26.970> know<00:03:27.060> if

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
hit him off I think I don't know if

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.449 
hit him off I think I don't know if
there's<00:03:27.329> extra<00:03:27.510> ap<00:03:28.079> if<00:03:28.260> we<00:03:28.410> knock<00:03:29.070> him<00:03:29.220> off<00:03:29.280> the

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
there's extra ap if we knock him off the

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:32.720 
there's extra ap if we knock him off the
edge<00:03:29.610> but<00:03:30.420> there<00:03:31.380> I<00:03:31.650> think<00:03:31.950> that<00:03:32.100> minus<00:03:32.489> is<00:03:32.610> in

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
edge but there I think that minus is in

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.990 
edge but there I think that minus is in
a<00:03:32.880> a<00:03:33.180> point<00:03:34.019> so<00:03:34.230> there<00:03:34.470> could<00:03:34.650> be<00:03:34.820> could<00:03:35.820> be<00:03:35.880> a

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
a a point so there could be could be a

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.449 
a a point so there could be could be a
bit<00:03:36.180> of<00:03:36.269> negative<00:03:36.450> negative<00:03:37.079> points<00:03:38.070> going<00:03:38.250> on

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
bit of negative negative points going on

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:42.229 
bit of negative negative points going on
to<00:03:38.610> Nathan's<00:03:39.380> stats<00:03:40.380> so<00:03:41.040> I'm<00:03:41.880> going<00:03:42.000> to<00:03:42.030> creep

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
to Nathan's stats so I'm going to creep

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:43.640 
to Nathan's stats so I'm going to creep
up<00:03:42.360> to<00:03:42.420> the<00:03:42.510> level<00:03:42.720> i'm<00:03:43.079> creeping<00:03:43.380> up<00:03:43.470> to<00:03:43.560> the

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
up to the level i'm creeping up to the

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.220 
up to the level i'm creeping up to the
little<00:03:43.920> tube<00:03:44.220> and<00:03:44.750> probably<00:03:45.750> a<00:03:45.810> few<00:03:45.900> more

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
little tube and probably a few more

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:51.440 
little tube and probably a few more
shots<00:03:46.440> I'll<00:03:46.650> have<00:03:46.709> it<00:03:47.090> arc<00:03:48.090> welder<00:03:48.769> so<00:03:50.450> it

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
shots I'll have it arc welder so it

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.750 
shots I'll have it arc welder so it
keeps<00:03:51.660> me<00:03:51.900> away<00:03:52.200> those<00:03:52.410> battles<00:03:52.799> the<00:03:53.519> best

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
keeps me away those battles the best

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:54.949 
keeps me away those battles the best
thing<00:03:53.970> about<00:03:54.030> the<00:03:54.299> blast<00:03:54.540> that<00:03:54.720> you<00:03:54.840> can

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 
thing about the blast that you can

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:57.350 
thing about the blast that you can
actually<00:03:55.079> shoot<00:03:55.500> you<00:03:56.340> can<00:03:56.489> shoot<00:03:56.730> Nathan's

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360 
actually shoot you can shoot Nathan's

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.020 
actually shoot you can shoot Nathan's
barrels<00:03:57.810> for<00:03:58.049> the<00:03:58.170> explosive<00:03:58.799> pretty<00:03:59.730> much<00:03:59.880> to

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
barrels for the explosive pretty much to

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:01.970 
barrels for the explosive pretty much to
hit<00:04:00.150> anyone<00:04:00.390> that's<00:04:00.720> not<00:04:00.959> near<00:04:01.350> well<00:04:01.739> you

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
hit anyone that's not near well you

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:03.410 
hit anyone that's not near well you
won't<00:04:02.160> be<00:04:02.250> near<00:04:02.430> the<00:04:02.519> barrel<00:04:02.820> so<00:04:02.940> that's<00:04:03.090> okay

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 
won't be near the barrel so that's okay

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.410 
won't be near the barrel so that's okay
so<00:04:03.500> I've<00:04:04.500> crept<00:04:04.860> up<00:04:04.980> on<00:04:05.070> my<00:04:05.190> level<00:04:05.370> two<00:04:05.670> might

due<00:04:24.000> to<00:04:24.120> him<00:04:24.270> falling<00:04:24.510> off<00:04:24.780> we'll<00:04:25.560> see<00:04:25.710> what

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
due to him falling off we'll see what

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.730 
due to him falling off we'll see what
happens<00:04:25.979> in<00:04:26.280> the<00:04:26.370> next<00:04:26.400> five<00:04:26.880> seconds

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:27.740 
happens in the next five seconds

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:31.520 
happens in the next five seconds
um<00:04:28.740> try<00:04:29.370> and<00:04:29.460> get<00:04:29.580> a<00:04:29.610> oh<00:04:29.910> wow<00:04:30.840> he<00:04:31.050> hit<00:04:31.230> me<00:04:31.260> there

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:31.530 
um try and get a oh wow he hit me there

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:35.720 
um try and get a oh wow he hit me there
 well<00:04:33.950> okay<00:04:34.950> apparently<00:04:35.220> apparently

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:35.730 
 well okay apparently apparently

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:38.440 
 well okay apparently apparently
getting<00:04:36.060> hit<00:04:36.120> off<00:04:36.330> the<00:04:36.450> edge<00:04:36.540> does<00:04:36.900> not<00:04:37.140> uh

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:38.450 
getting hit off the edge does not uh

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:42.530 
getting hit off the edge does not uh
negate<00:04:39.450> from<00:04:39.720> your<00:04:39.870> score<00:04:40.230> so<00:04:41.240> that's<00:04:42.240> odd

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:42.540 
negate from your score so that's odd

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:45.200 
negate from your score so that's odd
considering<00:04:43.500> that<00:04:43.740> I<00:04:43.950> did<00:04:44.280> hit<00:04:44.430> him<00:04:44.460> off<00:04:44.700> but

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 
considering that I did hit him off but

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:48.140 
considering that I did hit him off but
hopefully<00:04:45.780> we<00:04:45.900> can<00:04:46.020> get<00:04:46.170> a<00:04:46.440> I<00:04:47.310> think<00:04:47.850> the<00:04:47.940> best

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:48.150 
hopefully we can get a I think the best

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:49.700 
hopefully we can get a I think the best
we<00:04:48.330> can<00:04:48.480> do<00:04:48.630> in<00:04:48.750> the<00:04:48.780> 50<00:04:49.140> seconds<00:04:49.500> that<00:04:49.590> we've

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
we can do in the 50 seconds that we've

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:53.660 
we can do in the 50 seconds that we've
got<00:04:49.920> is<00:04:50.300> get<00:04:51.300> a<00:04:51.330> level<00:04:51.780> 10<00:04:52.590> not<00:04:53.160> 11<00:04:53.280> once<00:04:53.490> on<00:04:53.640> a

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:53.670 
got is get a level 10 not 11 once on a

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:55.910 
got is get a level 10 not 11 once on a
level<00:04:53.820> two<00:04:54.120> level<00:04:54.810> three<00:04:54.960> still<00:04:55.320> a<00:04:55.350> bit<00:04:55.530> hefty

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:55.920 
level two level three still a bit hefty

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:58.790 
level two level three still a bit hefty
even<00:04:56.280> on<00:04:56.370> overtime<00:04:56.880> and<00:04:57.560> hopefully<00:04:58.560> this<00:04:58.680> will

00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 
even on overtime and hopefully this will

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.950 
even on overtime and hopefully this will
add<00:04:59.010> to<00:04:59.190> the<00:04:59.310> time<00:04:59.550> because<00:04:59.910> I<00:05:00.000> think<00:05:00.060> again<00:05:00.660> I

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 
add to the time because I think again I

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.170 
add to the time because I think again I
did<00:05:01.410> it<00:05:01.530> to<00:05:01.770> three<00:05:02.430> minute<00:05:02.670> battle<00:05:02.790> instead<00:05:03.030> of

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:03.180 
did it to three minute battle instead of

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:05.780 
did it to three minute battle instead of
5<00:05:03.420> 1<00:05:03.690> so<00:05:03.960> this<00:05:04.590> is<00:05:04.740> adding<00:05:05.010> length<00:05:05.190> eNOS<00:05:05.490> to<00:05:05.670> it

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:05.790 
5 1 so this is adding length eNOS to it

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:09.320 
5 1 so this is adding length eNOS to it
so<00:05:06.120> can't<00:05:06.960> complain<00:05:07.140> about<00:05:07.410> that<00:05:07.760> 28<00:05:08.760> seconds

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:09.330 
so can't complain about that 28 seconds

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.900 
so can't complain about that 28 seconds
and<00:05:09.570> I've<00:05:09.810> got<00:05:09.960> my<00:05:10.050> level<00:05:10.350> 1<00:05:10.530> I<00:05:10.770> might<00:05:11.550> try<00:05:11.760> get

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:11.910 
and I've got my level 1 I might try get

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:15.070

my blaster or the radius blaster from
not<00:05:16.080> quite<00:05:16.290> sure<00:05:16.320> on<00:05:16.470> the<00:05:16.620> name<00:05:16.830> it's<00:05:17.010> from

Jack three but nearly got level 2 and
he's<00:05:19.890> got<00:05:20.190> me<00:05:20.310> with<00:05:20.460> his<00:05:20.610> gattling<00:05:21.030> gun<00:05:21.060> gonna

charge<00:05:22.350> it<00:05:22.440> up<00:05:22.530> again<00:05:22.890> might<00:05:23.280> have<00:05:23.370> to<00:05:23.430> do<00:05:23.970> that

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:24.090 
charge it up again might have to do that

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:26.240 
charge it up again might have to do that
before<00:05:24.240> that<00:05:24.419> hits<00:05:24.600> me<00:05:24.660> and<00:05:24.900> again<00:05:25.500> well<00:05:26.220> I

before that hits me and again well I

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:27.080 
before that hits me and again well I

thought that would have give me a little
too<00:05:27.300> i<00:05:27.330> thought<00:05:27.540> that<00:05:27.600> was<00:05:27.660> charged<00:05:28.050> up<00:05:28.200> and<00:05:28.350> up
