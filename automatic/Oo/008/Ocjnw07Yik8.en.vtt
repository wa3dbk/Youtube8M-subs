here but unfortunately we're not in
Minecraft<00:01:24.060> 1.2<00:01:24.540> anymore<00:01:24.930> so<00:01:25.430> if<00:01:26.430> I<00:01:26.610> call<00:01:26.909> a

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
Minecraft 1.2 anymore so if I call a

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.350 
Minecraft 1.2 anymore so if I call a
cart<00:01:27.270> now<00:01:27.650> the<00:01:28.650> front<00:01:28.890> cart<00:01:29.130> will<00:01:29.340> move<00:01:29.640> but<00:01:30.270> as

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
cart now the front cart will move but as

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.350 
cart now the front cart will move but as
soon<00:01:30.540> as<00:01:30.630> it<00:01:30.810> hits<00:01:31.020> this<00:01:31.259> detector<00:01:31.799> rail<00:01:31.950> to

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 
soon as it hits this detector rail to

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.380 
soon as it hits this detector rail to
ultimately<00:01:33.360> trigger<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:34.049> next<00:01:34.619> cart<00:01:34.950> to<00:01:35.070> move

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
ultimately trigger the next cart to move

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.910 
ultimately trigger the next cart to move
you'll<00:01:36.390> see<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.659> torch<00:01:36.900> is<00:01:37.079> lit<00:01:37.110> but<00:01:37.590> of

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
you'll see the torch is lit but of

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.580 
you'll see the torch is lit but of
course<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.640> hard<00:01:39.600> will<00:01:39.780> is<00:01:39.990> no<00:01:40.140> longer<00:01:40.350> lit

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
course the hard will is no longer lit

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.679 
course the hard will is no longer lit
and<00:01:40.829> because<00:01:41.280> of<00:01:41.310> that<00:01:41.430> all<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.270> carts<00:01:42.509> behind

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
and because of that all the carts behind

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:47.420 
and because of that all the carts behind
are<00:01:43.380> not<00:01:44.159> moving<00:01:44.460> anymore<00:01:45.950> so<00:01:46.950> one<00:01:47.220> more<00:01:47.399> thing

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
are not moving anymore so one more thing

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.120 
are not moving anymore so one more thing
I'll<00:01:47.670> mention<00:01:47.790> is<00:01:48.210> that<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:49.439> old<00:01:49.619> dispenser

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
I'll mention is that the old dispenser

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.429 
I'll mention is that the old dispenser
was<00:01:50.250> about<00:01:50.549> seven<00:01:51.360> blocks<00:01:51.570> wide<00:01:51.899> as<00:01:52.229> you<00:01:52.350> can

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
was about seven blocks wide as you can

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.920 
was about seven blocks wide as you can
see<00:01:52.619> there<00:01:52.909> but<00:01:53.909> in<00:01:54.030> a<00:01:54.090> new<00:01:54.270> dispenser<00:01:54.720> I've

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
see there but in a new dispenser I've

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.289 
see there but in a new dispenser I've
managed<00:01:55.409> to<00:01:55.470> whittle<00:01:55.860> this<00:01:56.100> down<00:01:56.159> to<00:01:56.549> six<00:01:56.880> so

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
managed to whittle this down to six so

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:58.910 
managed to whittle this down to six so
it's<00:01:57.479> actually<00:01:57.659> smaller<00:01:58.350> than<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:58.829> old

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
it's actually smaller than the old

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.300 
it's actually smaller than the old
dispenser<00:01:59.549> this<00:02:00.360> was<00:02:00.540> mainly<00:02:00.990> done<00:02:01.979> because

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
dispenser this was mainly done because

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.580 
dispenser this was mainly done because
thanks<00:02:02.790> to<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.210> moving<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:03.960> RS<00:02:04.380> nor<00:02:04.530> latch

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
thanks to the moving the RS nor latch

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.590 
thanks to the moving the RS nor latch
down<00:02:05.009> one<00:02:05.250> block<00:02:05.369> I<00:02:05.700> was<00:02:05.820> able<00:02:06.030> to<00:02:06.060> optimize

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
down one block I was able to optimize

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.260 
down one block I was able to optimize
the<00:02:06.780> space<00:02:07.290> a<00:02:07.320> bit<00:02:07.590> more

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
the space a bit more

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.870 
the space a bit more
one<00:02:09.690> last<00:02:09.930> thing<00:02:10.140> I<00:02:10.380> will<00:02:10.440> also<00:02:10.890> mention<00:02:11.040> is<00:02:11.460> a

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
one last thing I will also mention is a

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.750 
one last thing I will also mention is a
little<00:02:12.360> bit<00:02:12.510> little<00:02:12.750> improvement<00:02:13.320> that<00:02:14.190> my

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
little bit little improvement that my

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.670 
little bit little improvement that my
good<00:02:15.210> friend<00:02:15.240> Ren<00:02:15.720> walls<00:02:15.990> as<00:02:16.290> a<00:02:16.320> fellow

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
good friend Ren walls as a fellow

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.320 
good friend Ren walls as a fellow
dispenser<00:02:17.160> designer<00:02:17.430> suggested<00:02:17.880> to<00:02:17.970> me<00:02:18.090> and

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
dispenser designer suggested to me and

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.750 
dispenser designer suggested to me and
that<00:02:19.020> is<00:02:19.170> to<00:02:19.440> put<00:02:19.650> in<00:02:19.740> some<00:02:20.010> propagation

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
that is to put in some propagation

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.700 
that is to put in some propagation
signals<00:02:21.150> in<00:02:21.390> between<00:02:21.840> each<00:02:22.020> of<00:02:22.050> the<00:02:22.290> RS<00:02:22.560> nor

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
signals in between each of the RS nor

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:25.880 
signals in between each of the RS nor
latch<00:02:22.770> so<00:02:23.190> you<00:02:23.250> can<00:02:23.370> see<00:02:23.580> some<00:02:24.150> of<00:02:24.270> that<00:02:24.300> in<00:02:24.900> the

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
latch so you can see some of that in the

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.300 
latch so you can see some of that in the
sides<00:02:26.190> here<00:02:26.580> and<00:02:27.120> what<00:02:27.540> that<00:02:27.750> does<00:02:28.050> is<00:02:28.290> has<00:02:28.980> two

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
sides here and what that does is has two

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.520 
sides here and what that does is has two
advantages<00:02:29.430> one<00:02:30.210> of<00:02:30.360> which<00:02:30.510> is<00:02:30.750> makes<00:02:31.290> the

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
advantages one of which is makes the

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.380 
advantages one of which is makes the
propagation<00:02:31.980> time<00:02:32.130> much<00:02:32.670> faster<00:02:33.120> for<00:02:33.270> the

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
propagation time much faster for the

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.930 
propagation time much faster for the
cards<00:02:33.660> so<00:02:34.230> you<00:02:34.620> can<00:02:35.190> see<00:02:35.370> that<00:02:35.550> they<00:02:35.670> move

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
cards so you can see that they move

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.780 
cards so you can see that they move
almost<00:02:36.840> instantaneously<00:02:37.710> how<00:02:38.220> this<00:02:38.370> works<00:02:38.580> is

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
almost instantaneously how this works is

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.990 
almost instantaneously how this works is
when<00:02:39.420> I<00:02:39.480> hit<00:02:39.720> this<00:02:39.960> button<00:02:40.200> here<00:02:40.680> the<00:02:41.670> signal

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
when I hit this button here the signal

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.970 
when I hit this button here the signal
actually<00:02:42.330> goes<00:02:42.690> to<00:02:42.720> all<00:02:43.170> of<00:02:43.410> the<00:02:43.530> RS<00:02:43.800> nor<00:02:43.920> latch

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
actually goes to all of the RS nor latch

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.370 
actually goes to all of the RS nor latch
is<00:02:44.280> almost<00:02:44.550> at<00:02:44.730> the<00:02:44.820> same<00:02:45.030> time<00:02:45.330> and<00:02:45.660> then<00:02:46.020> turn

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
is almost at the same time and then turn

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.920 
is almost at the same time and then turn
makes<00:02:46.740> all<00:02:47.040> the<00:02:47.280> carts<00:02:47.640> in<00:02:48.210> the<00:02:48.420> dispenser

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
makes all the carts in the dispenser

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.000 
makes all the carts in the dispenser
move<00:02:49.200> almost<00:02:49.770> at<00:02:49.890> the<00:02:49.980> same<00:02:50.130> time<00:02:50.400> as<00:02:50.580> well

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
move almost at the same time as well

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.920 
move almost at the same time as well
another<00:02:53.010> the<00:02:53.520> second<00:02:53.970> advantage<00:02:54.120> of<00:02:54.510> this<00:02:54.660> is

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
another the second advantage of this is

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.550 
another the second advantage of this is
also<00:02:55.680> that<00:02:56.130> like<00:02:57.090> in<00:02:57.360> Grenville<00:02:57.900> dispenser<00:02:58.410> if

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
also that like in Grenville dispenser if

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.270 
also that like in Grenville dispenser if
I<00:02:59.570> remove<00:03:00.570> a<00:03:00.720> cart<00:03:00.960> this<00:03:01.440> dispenser<00:03:01.770> will<00:03:02.040> now

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
I remove a cart this dispenser will now

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.390 
I remove a cart this dispenser will now
repair<00:03:02.910> any<00:03:03.150> gaps<00:03:03.480> are<00:03:03.750> in<00:03:03.900> the<00:03:04.470> dispensers<00:03:05.370> so

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
repair any gaps are in the dispensers so

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.270 
repair any gaps are in the dispensers so
I've<00:03:06.000> removed<00:03:06.330> that<00:03:06.420> cart<00:03:06.780> and<00:03:07.050> if<00:03:07.590> I<00:03:07.710> hit<00:03:08.010> the

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
I've removed that cart and if I hit the

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:13.370 
I've removed that cart and if I hit the
call<00:03:08.850> Cart<00:03:09.240> button<00:03:09.540> again<00:03:11.959> you'll<00:03:12.959> see<00:03:13.230> that

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
call Cart button again you'll see that

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.350 
call Cart button again you'll see that
all<00:03:13.650> the<00:03:13.800> carts<00:03:14.100> behind<00:03:14.280> that<00:03:14.730> gap<00:03:14.910> will<00:03:15.180> now

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
all the carts behind that gap will now

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.990 
all the carts behind that gap will now
move<00:03:15.690> to<00:03:16.020> fill<00:03:16.680> that<00:03:16.860> gap<00:03:16.920> which<00:03:17.700> is<00:03:17.820> pretty

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
move to fill that gap which is pretty

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.270 
move to fill that gap which is pretty
good<00:03:18.150> so<00:03:18.390> I<00:03:18.420> managed<00:03:18.720> to<00:03:18.780> do<00:03:19.170> this<00:03:19.350> for<00:03:20.040> almost

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
good so I managed to do this for almost

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.610 
good so I managed to do this for almost
all<00:03:20.880> the<00:03:21.090> slots<00:03:21.330> and<00:03:21.510> dispenser<00:03:21.989> except<00:03:22.410> for

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
all the slots and dispenser except for

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.060 
all the slots and dispenser except for
the<00:03:22.709> last<00:03:22.980> one<00:03:23.310> which<00:03:23.520> over<00:03:24.270> here<00:03:24.630> and<00:03:25.070> there's

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
the last one which over here and there's

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:29.120 
the last one which over here and there's
a<00:03:26.130> reason<00:03:26.640> for<00:03:26.670> this<00:03:27.000> the<00:03:27.570> loading<00:03:28.530> mechanism

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
a reason for this the loading mechanism

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.070 
a reason for this the loading mechanism
as<00:03:29.310> you<00:03:29.459> can<00:03:29.550> see<00:03:29.730> here<00:03:30.030> just<00:03:30.600> before<00:03:30.930> you

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
as you can see here just before you

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:32.780 
as you can see here just before you
enter<00:03:31.380> this<00:03:31.530> dispenser<00:03:32.040> there's<00:03:32.400> a<00:03:32.489> switch

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
enter this dispenser there's a switch

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.400 
enter this dispenser there's a switch
and<00:03:33.120> this<00:03:33.239> can<00:03:33.420> trigger<00:03:33.660> and<00:03:33.900> controls

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.410 
and this can trigger and controls

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:39.080 
and this can trigger and controls
basically<00:03:37.410> controls<00:03:37.950> how<00:03:38.250> what<00:03:38.880> kind<00:03:39.060> of

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
basically controls how what kind of

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.000 
basically controls how what kind of
cards<00:03:39.390> can<00:03:39.570> get<00:03:39.720> going<00:03:40.019> to<00:03:40.080> the<00:03:40.200> Spencer<00:03:40.650> makes

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
cards can get going to the Spencer makes

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.070 
cards can get going to the Spencer makes
basically<00:03:41.550> prevents<00:03:42.180> you<00:03:42.239> from<00:03:42.269> fast<00:03:42.750> loading

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:43.080 
basically prevents you from fast loading

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.320 
basically prevents you from fast loading
and<00:03:43.350> putting<00:03:43.560> in<00:03:43.620> double<00:03:43.860> card<00:03:44.070> set<00:03:44.280> so<00:03:45.060> if<00:03:45.180> I

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.330 
and putting in double card set so if I

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:49.460 
and putting in double card set so if I
were<00:03:45.480> to<00:03:45.510> I<00:03:46.170> can<00:03:46.530> get<00:03:46.680> down<00:03:46.890> here<00:03:47.250> and<00:03:48.440> load<00:03:49.440> up

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
were to I can get down here and load up

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.949 
were to I can get down here and load up
the<00:03:49.650> dispenser<00:03:50.160> here<00:03:50.660> you'll<00:03:51.660> see<00:03:51.780> that

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
the dispenser here you'll see that

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:55.880 
the dispenser here you'll see that
switch<00:03:52.220> moves<00:03:53.220> so<00:03:53.550> that<00:03:54.120> only<00:03:54.360> one<00:03:54.570> cart<00:03:55.110> goes

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
switch moves so that only one cart goes

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:01.150 
switch moves so that only one cart goes
in<00:03:56.100> at<00:03:56.400> a<00:03:56.640> time<00:03:59.000> it's<00:04:00.000> almost<00:04:00.180> full<00:04:00.540> here

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:01.160 
in at a time it's almost full here

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:04.040 
in at a time it's almost full here
alright<00:04:02.160> so<00:04:02.400> and<00:04:02.640> once<00:04:03.090> the<00:04:03.390> dispenser<00:04:03.959> is

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:04.050 
alright so and once the dispenser is

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:05.780 
alright so and once the dispenser is
complete<00:04:04.350> folder<00:04:04.530> the<00:04:04.980> switch<00:04:05.519> will

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
complete folder the switch will

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:08.300 
complete folder the switch will
permanently<00:04:06.209> switch<00:04:06.660> over<00:04:07.050> to<00:04:07.650> the<00:04:07.860> overflow

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
permanently switch over to the overflow

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:11.770 
permanently switch over to the overflow
so<00:04:08.700> that<00:04:09.360> no<00:04:09.660> further<00:04:09.959> carts<00:04:10.380> can<00:04:10.530> get<00:04:10.680> in<00:04:10.860> but

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:11.780 
so that no further carts can get in but

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:14.780 
so that no further carts can get in but
because<00:04:12.780> this<00:04:13.320> is<00:04:13.470> a<00:04:13.500> this<00:04:13.920> last<00:04:14.220> slot<00:04:14.459> is<00:04:14.580> not

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
because this is a this last slot is not

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:17.789 
because this is a this last slot is not
part<00:04:15.060> of<00:04:15.150> the<00:04:15.300> propagation<00:04:15.900> signals<00:04:16.890> so

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:17.799 
part of the propagation signals so

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:20.460 
part of the propagation signals so
if<00:04:18.400> I<00:04:18.579> remove<00:04:18.879> this<00:04:19.060> card<00:04:19.419> and<00:04:19.690> then<00:04:19.840> call<00:04:20.139> a

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 
if I remove this card and then call a

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:24.480 
if I remove this card and then call a
cart<00:04:21.069> once<00:04:21.280> more<00:04:21.660> you'll<00:04:22.660> see<00:04:22.960> that<00:04:23.490> the

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:24.490 
cart once more you'll see that the

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:27.350 
cart once more you'll see that the
whoops<00:04:24.849> don't<00:04:25.629> go<00:04:26.020> into<00:04:26.139> the<00:04:26.229> carts<00:04:26.470> there

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
whoops don't go into the carts there

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.790 
whoops don't go into the carts there
you'll<00:04:28.360> see<00:04:28.539> that<00:04:28.690> the<00:04:28.840> switch<00:04:28.960> is<00:04:29.080> now<00:04:29.379> still

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
you'll see that the switch is now still

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.010 
you'll see that the switch is now still
stuck<00:04:30.159> because<00:04:30.370> this<00:04:31.120> switch<00:04:31.389> is<00:04:31.539> controlled

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.020 
stuck because this switch is controlled

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.860 
stuck because this switch is controlled
by<00:04:32.169> this<00:04:32.229> purple<00:04:32.710> RS<00:04:33.250> nor<00:04:33.460> latch<00:04:33.520> and<00:04:34.060> this<00:04:34.539> RS

occurred leaves a slot which would

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:50.279 
occurred leaves a slot which would
happen<00:04:48.039> when<00:04:48.340> cart<00:04:49.000> rolls<00:04:49.690> over<00:04:49.960> this

happen when cart rolls over this
detector<00:04:50.770> rail<00:04:51.460> here<00:04:51.909> so<00:04:52.509> because<00:04:52.750> no<00:04:53.020> we

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:53.590 
detector rail here so because no we

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:55.740 
detector rail here so because no we
remove<00:04:53.919> that<00:04:53.949> cart<00:04:54.430> the<00:04:55.000> techno<00:04:55.449> card

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:55.750 
remove that cart the techno card

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:57.990 
remove that cart the techno card
actually<00:04:55.960> rolled<00:04:56.470> over<00:04:56.650> that<00:04:56.889> rail<00:04:57.130> so<00:04:57.759> of

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:58.000 
actually rolled over that rail so of

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.610 
actually rolled over that rail so of
course<00:04:58.150> the<00:04:58.330> switch<00:04:58.539> is<00:04:58.659> now<00:04:58.780> stuck<00:04:59.169> in<00:04:59.199> this

00:04:59.610 --> 00:04:59.620 
course the switch is now stuck in this

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:02.460 
course the switch is now stuck in this
position<00:05:00.099> the<00:05:00.729> fix<00:05:00.909> is<00:05:01.060> you<00:05:01.180> can<00:05:01.330> just<00:05:01.479> go<00:05:01.569> move

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:02.470 
position the fix is you can just go move

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:04.170 
position the fix is you can just go move
it<00:05:02.710> let's<00:05:02.919> just<00:05:02.979> put<00:05:03.250> a<00:05:03.280> card<00:05:03.580> manually<00:05:03.970> there

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:04.180 
it let's just put a card manually there

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:08.580 
it let's just put a card manually there
and<00:05:04.419> it'll<00:05:04.750> repair<00:05:05.289> itself<00:05:05.940> now<00:05:07.349> this<00:05:08.349> is<00:05:08.470> not

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:08.590 
and it'll repair itself now this is not

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:11.249 
and it'll repair itself now this is not
a<00:05:08.620> big<00:05:08.860> deal<00:05:09.069> in<00:05:09.819> my<00:05:09.969> opinion<00:05:10.000> so<00:05:10.659> I'm<00:05:11.080> not

00:05:11.249 --> 00:05:11.259 
a big deal in my opinion so I'm not

00:05:11.259 --> 00:05:12.719 
a big deal in my opinion so I'm not
