00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
relative strength index now let's take a

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.310 
relative strength index now let's take a
look<00:00:49.890> at<00:00:50.100> how<00:00:50.430> this<00:00:50.610> compares<00:00:50.879> with<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:52.050> price

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
look at how this compares with the price

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.810 
look at how this compares with the price
index<00:00:53.570> well<00:00:54.710> first<00:00:55.710> we'll<00:00:55.980> take<00:00:56.190> a<00:00:56.219> look<00:00:56.520> at

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
index well first we'll take a look at

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.810 
index well first we'll take a look at
when<00:00:57.329> it<00:00:57.480> was<00:00:57.660> at<00:00:57.989> 80<00:00:58.320> you<00:00:59.280> might<00:00:59.460> ask<00:00:59.609> yourself

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
when it was at 80 you might ask yourself

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.950 
when it was at 80 you might ask yourself
what<00:01:00.600> does<00:01:00.750> this<00:01:00.930> mean<00:01:01.170> well<00:01:02.510> when<00:01:03.510> it<00:01:03.629> when

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
what does this mean well when it when

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.280 
what does this mean well when it when
this<00:01:04.170> is<00:01:04.470> above<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.250> 50<00:01:06.000> line<00:01:06.180> this<00:01:06.990> means

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
this is above the 50 line this means

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.649 
this is above the 50 line this means
that<00:01:07.409> it's<00:01:07.619> over<00:01:07.830> bought<00:01:08.159> anything<00:01:09.119> below

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
that it's over bought anything below

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.890 
that it's over bought anything below
means<00:01:10.560> it's<00:01:10.740> oversold<00:01:11.600> now<00:01:12.600> what<00:01:12.780> does

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
means it's oversold now what does

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.620 
means it's oversold now what does
overbought<00:01:13.439> and<00:01:13.470> oversold<00:01:13.770> refer<00:01:14.640> to<00:01:14.880> it's

11.5 roughly 214 are you going to by
here<00:04:14.990> no<00:04:15.250> why<00:04:16.810> because<00:04:17.810> we<00:04:17.960> take<00:04:18.170> a<00:04:18.200> look<00:04:18.530> at

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:18.710 
here no why because we take a look at

here no why because we take a look at
the<00:04:18.830> RSI<00:04:19.370> chart<00:04:19.820> the<00:04:20.510> RSI<00:04:20.900> chart<00:04:21.200> shows<00:04:21.500> us

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:21.739 
the RSI chart the RSI chart shows us

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:25.210 
the RSI chart the RSI chart shows us
that<00:04:21.980> it's<00:04:22.160> at<00:04:22.280> an<00:04:22.400> all-time<00:04:22.940> high<00:04:23.390> and<00:04:24.220> most

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:25.220 
that it's at an all-time high and most

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:28.810 
that it's at an all-time high and most
likely<00:04:25.570> will<00:04:26.570> be<00:04:26.600> going<00:04:27.050> back<00:04:27.260> down<00:04:27.830> following

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:28.820 
likely will be going back down following

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:32.740 
likely will be going back down following
these<00:04:29.270> patterns<00:04:29.600> over<00:04:30.530> here<00:04:30.770> and<00:04:31.480> that<00:04:32.480> means

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:32.750 
these patterns over here and that means

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:35.560 
these patterns over here and that means
they<00:04:33.200> can<00:04:33.440> expect<00:04:33.770> the<00:04:33.890> price<00:04:34.190> to<00:04:34.250> drop<00:04:35.210> to

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:35.570 
they can expect the price to drop to

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:37.690 
they can expect the price to drop to
roughly<00:04:35.930> around<00:04:36.080> let's<00:04:36.710> say<00:04:36.890> twelve<00:04:37.250> dollars

roughly around let's say twelve dollars
12.2<00:04:38.690> that'd<00:04:39.530> be<00:04:39.710> a<00:04:39.740> good<00:04:39.920> time<00:04:40.100> to<00:04:40.160> buy<00:04:40.430> and

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:40.960 
12.2 that'd be a good time to buy and
