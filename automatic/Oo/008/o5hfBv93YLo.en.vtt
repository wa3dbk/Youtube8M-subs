00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
I have one cup of brown rice flour 1/4

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.539 
I have one cup of brown rice flour 1/4
cup<00:00:12.509> of<00:00:12.540> potato<00:00:13.110> flour<00:00:13.440> not<00:00:13.860> potato<00:00:14.190> starch

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
cup of potato flour not potato starch

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.340 
cup of potato flour not potato starch
it's<00:00:14.849> really<00:00:15.330> really<00:00:15.599> fine<00:00:15.809> it's<00:00:16.049> going<00:00:16.170> to<00:00:16.230> be

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
it's really really fine it's going to be

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.080 
it's really really fine it's going to be
like<00:00:16.500> our<00:00:16.619> glue<00:00:16.980> kind<00:00:17.310> of<00:00:17.460> make<00:00:17.699> it<00:00:17.730> because

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
like our glue kind of make it because

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.400 
like our glue kind of make it because
there's<00:00:18.270> no<00:00:18.390> gluten<00:00:18.600> in<00:00:18.869> the<00:00:19.050> brown<00:00:19.230> rice

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
there's no gluten in the brown rice

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:20.900 
there's no gluten in the brown rice
flour<00:00:19.529> so<00:00:20.070> it's<00:00:20.160> going<00:00:20.250> to<00:00:20.310> act<00:00:20.490> like<00:00:20.609> our<00:00:20.699> glue

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
flour so it's going to act like our glue

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.880 
flour so it's going to act like our glue
to<00:00:21.000> make<00:00:21.119> it<00:00:21.210> all<00:00:21.300> stick<00:00:21.420> together<00:00:21.570> and<00:00:21.900> then

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
to make it all stick together and then

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.580 
to make it all stick together and then
this<00:00:23.220> is<00:00:23.430> 3/4<00:00:23.910> cup<00:00:24.060> of<00:00:24.090> water<00:00:24.300> so<00:00:25.289> we<00:00:25.320> add

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
this is 3/4 cup of water so we add

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.170

rice<00:00:29.519> flour<00:00:31.460> potato<00:00:32.460> flour<00:00:32.550> not<00:00:33.390> starch<00:00:34.880> we

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
rice flour potato flour not starch we

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:43.940 
rice flour potato flour not starch we
could<00:00:36.059> stir<00:00:36.239> those<00:00:36.420> together<00:00:36.660> a<00:00:36.840> little<00:00:42.950> and

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
could stir those together a little and

00:00:43.950 --> 00:01:06.219 
could stir those together a little and
then<00:00:44.430> I'm<00:00:44.579> going<00:00:44.700> to<00:00:44.760> add<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.210> water

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:06.229 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:10.690 

and<00:01:07.229> that's<00:01:07.469> perfect<00:01:07.909> nice<00:01:08.909> ball<00:01:09.180> of<00:01:09.210> dough

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
and that's perfect nice ball of dough

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.830 
and that's perfect nice ball of dough
all<00:01:11.700> right<00:01:11.820> so<00:01:12.000> I<00:01:12.060> divided<00:01:12.420> it<00:01:12.450> into<00:01:12.600> four

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
all right so I divided it into four

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.090 
all right so I divided it into four
little<00:01:12.990> balls<00:01:13.289> and<00:01:13.619> now<00:01:13.680> I'm<00:01:13.740> going<00:01:13.890> to<00:01:13.979> roll

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
little balls and now I'm going to roll

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.459 
little balls and now I'm going to roll
them<00:01:14.250> out<00:01:14.340> I'm<00:01:15.329> doing<00:01:15.689> it<00:01:15.780> between<00:01:16.049> two<00:01:16.320> pieces

00:01:16.459 --> 00:01:16.469 
them out I'm doing it between two pieces

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:18.770 
them out I'm doing it between two pieces
of<00:01:16.649> plastic<00:01:16.770> wrap<00:01:17.310> wax<00:01:18.210> paper<00:01:18.450> would<00:01:18.689> be

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
of plastic wrap wax paper would be

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.319 
of plastic wrap wax paper would be
really<00:01:18.990> good<00:01:19.110> too<00:01:19.320> I<00:01:19.500> didn't<00:01:20.369> have<00:01:20.460> any<00:01:20.640> but

00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:21.329

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:22.460 
really good too I didn't have any but
the<00:01:21.420> plastic<00:01:21.689> wrap<00:01:21.780> making<00:01:22.020> so<00:01:22.110> doesn't<00:01:22.319> slide

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
the plastic wrap making so doesn't slide

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:23.929 
the plastic wrap making so doesn't slide
around<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.799> cabinet<00:01:23.159> which<00:01:23.250> is<00:01:23.280> nice<00:01:23.520> too<00:01:23.759> and

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.359 
we're going we're shooting for a circle
shape<00:01:26.880> but<00:01:27.240> it<00:01:27.329> doesn't<00:01:27.600> really<00:01:27.689> matter

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:28.369 
shape but it doesn't really matter

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:47.319 
shape but it doesn't really matter
