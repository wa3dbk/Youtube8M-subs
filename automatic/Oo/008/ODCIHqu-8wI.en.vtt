00:00:11.339 --> 00:00:14.629
 I know everyone so I am not here with a logitech keyboard 

00:00:15.569 --> 00:00:19.910
 one of those that are having the most success lately is one 

00:00:19.909 --> 00:00:21.669
 ergonomic keyboard 

00:00:21.669 --> 00:00:26.380
 as you can see java the package is convolved both as a shape 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:31.310
 leather with the depth of the insert keys with a lot really is a 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.530
 myriad of additional multimedia keys 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.970
 voyeur keyboard the stars and that allows the use 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:43.930
 extensor a file in the pool is compact and useful for renting 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:44.920
 number 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.269
 d particularly large vlf receiver 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:53.010
 let's proceed now keyboard 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.740
 as you see 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:57.530
 compatible 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.460
 column windows 7 windows xp in windows vista then 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:04.110
 Compatible with 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.020
 more than 90% of computers on the market 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.020
 expect these things to be seismic map photos 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.590
 facebook ofootball 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.200
 overly writing 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.860
 ok 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.860
 cretone spa boxes 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:32.120
 as you see 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:39.240
 there is the cafeteria mail for example to rummage the usp exit where to connect 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.360
 sensor wires 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.360
 then we have 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.820
 sex is real 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.480
 as you can see epc or compact 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.500
 it's surely 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.150
 is one of those that you can easily forget then 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:02.200
 hooked 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.390
 has a portable USB ide anti-porn chicken port on myself in the costori 

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:10.829
 inside of 

00:02:10.829 --> 00:02:13.929
 then we find paris 

00:02:13.929 --> 00:02:19.219
 dedicated to slices then because villa type program allows use 

00:02:19.219 --> 00:02:22.889
 of the keyboard and the personalization of the data we remind you that you can 

00:02:22.889 --> 00:02:25.439
 keyboard and also customizable 

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:27.949
 as behaviors 

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:29.159
 life I demand of you 

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:34.000
 finished pages lunch at all the functions of the senate. also in this 

00:02:33.999 --> 00:02:38.760
 In this case we are a complete condom that protects dallas d'alatri 

00:02:41.499 --> 00:02:44.499
 crown keyboard as it was said of a rubber insert 

00:02:45.749 --> 00:02:49.179
 this lower part is particularly comfortable in use 

00:02:49.179 --> 00:02:52.239
 daily because it allows to support the 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:54.359
 the end of the palm 

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:57.359
 present films as you see 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:02.620
 on the shiny walls so we have a film quiubi.it 

00:03:05.589 --> 00:03:08.969
 on its back we sang of ignition 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:13.059
 hot and on obviously for villa sensor 

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:16.639
 unifarm we have the battery slot 

00:03:21.779 --> 00:03:25.919
 and we also have the types of not for an adjustment in the same keyboard as 

00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:29.039
 say that there is 8 degree interaction 

00:03:31.279 --> 00:03:35.109
 and that 4 installments we finish double stage inflation alert 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:40.090
 good thing if you want the keyboard inclined of the days I must also a lot 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:43.129
 cristina for combined keyboard 

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:46.239
 re branded hello kitty libero.it 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:47.879
 as you see 

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:52.930
 both here and here we find the challenge logitech quickcam so we always know 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:54.259
 anyway 

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:59.569
 is tv marche without having to go in search here we find an indicator of the task de 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:01.899
 the keyboard charge 

00:04:01.899 --> 00:04:06.399
 she has 8 complete as you see as it was said before dubbed ball is 

00:04:06.399 --> 00:04:08.630
 therefore we have inclination 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:11.169
 a sign curve in this verse 

00:04:11.169 --> 00:04:14.909
 that in the face of opportunities in this way we obviously have the 

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:17.099
 possibility of giving 

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:21.499
 on the deeper button the longer fingers so it is very ergonomic and 

00:04:21.499 --> 00:04:23.680
 much more studied 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.889
 indoor keys that work as you say tartlets a net 12 as you see 

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:31.770
 we have normal keys that we have the keys then with hotel for example for 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:33.639
 faux opening 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:36.890
 of gordola rather than that sky of the calendar 

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:39.890
 internet messenger e mail 

00:04:40.439 --> 00:04:42.610
 is a search 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:46.060
 in this way we can then customize the best 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:48.879
 moms use 

00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:50.400
 on the other hand waiting 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.509
 queen on the final part as you see 

00:04:53.509 --> 00:04:54.390
 There are 

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:56.120
 the calculator keys 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:59.090
 and there is the switch-off button in this case with the switch-off button 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:03.600
 personally tried configuration by properly configuring the last one 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:04.470
 button 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:07.409
 comuque a pressure in this kind 

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:10.960
 for me it can lead to rt sistem shutdown 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:17.889
 what else to add there are the rubber feet as you say then you have which 

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:20.719
 also a non-slip surface 

00:05:20.719 --> 00:05:25.460
 rt soon that the kids series create media buttons of the media 

00:05:25.459 --> 00:05:26.300
 center 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:29.490
 rather he asked admit 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:34.770
 the multimedia keys as you decrease volume increases system dissident volume 

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:37.910
 tatoo goldbet quote iforwarder stop play 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:42.699
 pause so let's say that there really are all the buttons 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:47.629
 of which you may feel the need to use the computer normally 

00:05:47.629 --> 00:05:52.979
 we remember the plague noire rsm mind gesture of a pair of batteries 

00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:54.789
 stylus to work 

00:05:54.789 --> 00:05:59.739
 and milk it is possible to configure with the finance fume sensor 

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:05.550
 &amp; amp eur usd which then for me second time ready text connect more 

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:06.889
 intelligent 

00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:11.389
 then to the same system here in practice because Punic sensor some 

00:06:11.389 --> 00:06:12.740
 file 

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:16.810
 and that you will have for example a keyboard a mouse connected on the same pipol 

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:18.789
 instead of this way 

00:06:18.789 --> 00:06:22.180
 with some new ones especially the minimum 

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:25.180
 you can have more peripherals connected 

00:06:25.819 --> 00:06:31.169
 the inquiÃ©ter minato move we will try then in the daily the keyboard and sol 

00:06:31.169 --> 00:06:34.729
 but if there will be the need to make katy videos even more to how 

00:06:34.729 --> 00:06:38.159
 it works 7 pointer we will publish them 

00:06:38.159 --> 00:06:39.300
 with this 

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:41.320
 nice blows through 

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:42.560
