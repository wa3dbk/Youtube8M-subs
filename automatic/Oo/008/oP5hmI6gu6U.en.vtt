is<00:02:20.870> the<00:02:21.050> equivalent<00:02:21.620> of<00:02:21.800> 4<00:02:22.129> cans<00:02:22.520> of<00:02:22.820> canned

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
is the equivalent of 4 cans of canned

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.560 
is the equivalent of 4 cans of canned
beans<00:02:23.420> so<00:02:24.320> here<00:02:24.710> I<00:02:24.830> have<00:02:25.400> 2<00:02:25.730> cups<00:02:26.030> of<00:02:26.210> dried

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:26.570 
beans so here I have 2 cups of dried

beans so here I have 2 cups of dried
pinto<00:02:26.810> beans<00:02:27.200> to<00:02:27.440> cook

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
pinto beans to cook

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:29.800 
pinto beans to cook
first<00:02:28.550> I'm<00:02:28.819> going<00:02:29.120> to<00:02:29.239> rinse<00:02:29.420> them<00:02:29.629> in<00:02:29.720> the

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
first I'm going to rinse them in the

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.600 
first I'm going to rinse them in the
colander<00:02:29.989> in<00:02:30.410> the<00:02:30.440> sink<00:02:30.530> and<00:02:30.920> then<00:02:31.340> check<00:02:31.580> for

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
colander in the sink and then check for

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.180 
colander in the sink and then check for
any<00:02:31.940> inedible<00:02:32.420> bits<00:02:32.690> like<00:02:33.170> small<00:02:33.530> stones<00:02:33.890> or

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
any inedible bits like small stones or

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:39.339 
any inedible bits like small stones or
pebbles<00:02:35.920> let's<00:02:36.920> do<00:02:37.160> that<00:02:37.310> really<00:02:37.640> quick<00:02:38.349> we'll

00:02:39.339 --> 00:02:39.349 
pebbles let's do that really quick we'll

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:42.309 
pebbles let's do that really quick we'll
rinse<00:02:39.650> them<00:02:39.920> and<00:02:40.840> then<00:02:41.840> we're<00:02:41.959> going<00:02:42.080> to<00:02:42.110> look

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:42.319 
rinse them and then we're going to look

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:46.990 
rinse them and then we're going to look
for<00:02:42.590> the<00:02:42.650> stone<00:02:44.680> there<00:02:45.680> we<00:02:45.769> go<00:02:45.950> to<00:02:46.519> see<00:02:46.670> we<00:02:46.819> can

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
for the stone there we go to see we can

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.440 
for the stone there we go to see we can
find<00:02:47.239> any<00:02:47.950> beans<00:02:48.950> often<00:02:49.489> grow<00:02:49.730> in<00:02:49.880> rocky<00:02:50.150> and

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
find any beans often grow in rocky and

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.509 
find any beans often grow in rocky and
sandy<00:02:50.810> soil<00:02:51.110> so<00:02:51.530> that's<00:02:51.709> why<00:02:51.920> you<00:02:51.980> might<00:02:52.280> find

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:52.519 
sandy soil so that's why you might find

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:56.050 
sandy soil so that's why you might find
a<00:02:52.700> few<00:02:52.760> of<00:02:53.090> these<00:02:53.209> little<00:02:53.390> stones<00:02:54.040> so<00:02:55.060> before

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
a few of these little stones so before

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:57.789 
a few of these little stones so before
we<00:02:56.209> cook<00:02:56.420> the<00:02:56.599> beans<00:02:56.780> we<00:02:57.230> need<00:02:57.379> to<00:02:57.500> soak<00:02:57.769> the

00:02:57.789 --> 00:02:57.799 
we cook the beans we need to soak the

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:00.610 
we cook the beans we need to soak the
beans<00:02:58.330> soaking<00:02:59.330> beans<00:02:59.480> helps<00:03:00.019> soften<00:03:00.290> them

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
beans soaking beans helps soften them

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.440 
beans soaking beans helps soften them
and<00:03:00.860> helps<00:03:01.099> decrease<00:03:01.250> the<00:03:01.670> heart<00:03:01.940> to<00:03:02.060> digest

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
and helps decrease the heart to digest

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.089 
and helps decrease the heart to digest
sugars<00:03:02.870> which<00:03:03.319> can<00:03:03.590> cause<00:03:03.799> stomach

00:03:04.089 --> 00:03:04.099 
sugars which can cause stomach

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:06.339 
sugars which can cause stomach
discomfort<00:03:04.459> and<00:03:04.940> gas<00:03:05.120> so<00:03:05.989> we<00:03:06.140> definitely

00:03:06.339 --> 00:03:06.349 
discomfort and gas so we definitely

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:09.210 
discomfort and gas so we definitely
don't<00:03:06.980> want<00:03:07.130> to<00:03:07.250> skip<00:03:07.489> this<00:03:07.640> important<00:03:08.120> step

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
don't want to skip this important step

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.069 
don't want to skip this important step
now<00:03:10.220> there<00:03:10.880> are<00:03:11.000> two<00:03:11.180> ways<00:03:11.209> to<00:03:11.420> soak<00:03:11.810> the<00:03:11.959> beans

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:12.079 
now there are two ways to soak the beans

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:14.740 
now there are two ways to soak the beans
the<00:03:12.709> long<00:03:12.980> soak<00:03:13.310> method<00:03:13.549> in<00:03:13.880> the<00:03:14.239> quick<00:03:14.480> soak

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
the long soak method in the quick soak

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:16.870 
the long soak method in the quick soak
method<00:03:14.780> which<00:03:15.739> I'm<00:03:15.950> going<00:03:16.160> to<00:03:16.250> show<00:03:16.549> you<00:03:16.579> today

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880 
method which I'm going to show you today

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:20.770 
method which I'm going to show you today
just<00:03:17.180> to<00:03:18.140> review<00:03:18.440> the<00:03:19.099> long<00:03:19.430> soak<00:03:19.819> way<00:03:20.209> you

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
just to review the long soak way you

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:22.600 
just to review the long soak way you
would<00:03:20.930> put<00:03:21.110> the<00:03:21.230> beans<00:03:21.470> in<00:03:21.620> a<00:03:21.829> container<00:03:22.280> with

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:22.610 
would put the beans in a container with

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:24.839 
would put the beans in a container with
three<00:03:22.940> times<00:03:23.239> as<00:03:23.510> much<00:03:23.720> water<00:03:24.049> as<00:03:24.170> the<00:03:24.530> beans

00:03:24.839 --> 00:03:24.849 
three times as much water as the beans

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:28.089 
three times as much water as the beans
cover<00:03:25.849> and<00:03:26.180> soak<00:03:26.660> them<00:03:26.870> for<00:03:27.019> eight<00:03:27.260> to<00:03:27.739> twelve

the<00:03:36.230> beans<00:03:36.380> overnight<00:03:37.069> is<00:03:37.340> a<00:03:37.400> great

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
the beans overnight is a great

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:38.890 
the beans overnight is a great
time-saver

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900 
time-saver

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.220 
time-saver
just<00:03:39.500> remember<00:03:39.859> to<00:03:40.010> plan<00:03:40.160> ahead<00:03:40.660> now<00:03:41.660> the

just remember to plan ahead now the
quick<00:03:42.470> soak<00:03:42.709> method<00:03:42.739> takes<00:03:43.519> much<00:03:43.819> less<00:03:44.060> time

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
quick soak method takes much less time

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.440 
quick soak method takes much less time
an<00:03:44.569> hour<00:03:45.200> compared<00:03:45.799> to<00:03:45.889> a<00:03:45.920> day<00:03:46.160> of<00:03:46.190> soaking<00:03:46.730> but

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.450 
an hour compared to a day of soaking but

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:50.410 
an hour compared to a day of soaking but
requires<00:03:47.900> a<00:03:48.049> little<00:03:48.440> extra<00:03:48.859> work<00:03:49.160> from<00:03:49.430> you<00:03:49.579> so

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.000 
soak for about an hour then we'll be

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.740 
soak for about an hour then we'll be
ready<00:04:38.150> to<00:04:38.270> cook<00:04:38.510> up<00:04:38.630> our<00:04:38.810> beans

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:39.750 
ready to cook up our beans

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.040 
ready to cook up our beans
so<00:04:40.620> it's<00:04:41.310> been<00:04:41.580> about<00:04:41.760> an<00:04:41.880> hour<00:04:41.940> and<00:04:42.510> you<00:04:42.840> can

so it's been about an hour and you can

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:45.230 
so it's been about an hour and you can
see<00:04:43.260> a<00:04:43.290> lot<00:04:43.530> of<00:04:43.560> foamy<00:04:44.070> stuff<00:04:44.130> on<00:04:44.670> top<00:04:44.940> of<00:04:45.150> the

see a lot of foamy stuff on top of the

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.420 
see a lot of foamy stuff on top of the
beans<00:04:45.450> we're<00:04:46.410> going<00:04:46.650> to<00:04:46.740> get<00:04:46.920> rid<00:04:47.070> of<00:04:47.100> all<00:04:47.400> that

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.430 
beans we're going to get rid of all that

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:50.260 
beans we're going to get rid of all that
by<00:04:48.240> draining<00:04:48.660> the<00:04:48.900> beans<00:04:49.110> into<00:04:49.410> my<00:04:49.620> colander

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:50.270 
by draining the beans into my colander

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:56.150 
by draining the beans into my colander
like<00:04:51.270> this<00:04:53.840> let's<00:04:54.840> just<00:04:55.050> be<00:04:55.200> careful<00:04:55.440> not<00:04:55.860> to

up onto high heat okay we're going to

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:53.750 
up onto high heat okay we're going to
let<00:05:51.540> these<00:05:51.720> boil<00:05:52.169> over<00:05:52.530> high<00:05:52.560> heat<00:05:52.740> and<00:05:53.280> if

that rises to the top here with a spoon

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:03.140 
that rises to the top here with a spoon
or<00:05:59.310> a<00:05:59.370> slotted<00:05:59.729> spoon<00:05:59.970> like<00:06:00.330> this<00:06:01.729> there<00:06:02.729> we<00:06:02.910> go

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:03.150 
or a slotted spoon like this there we go

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:08.950 
or a slotted spoon like this there we go
very<00:06:05.780> well<00:06:07.190> okay

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:08.960 
very well okay

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:11.810 
very well okay
now<00:06:09.960> that<00:06:10.169> these<00:06:10.290> are<00:06:10.350> they're<00:06:11.220> at<00:06:11.430> a<00:06:11.460> full

now that these are they're at a full
boil<00:06:12.090> I'm<00:06:12.419> going<00:06:12.840> to<00:06:13.080> reduce<00:06:13.410> the<00:06:13.590> heat<00:06:13.620> to<00:06:13.800> low

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:14.100

boil I'm going to reduce the heat to low
cover<00:06:14.340> and<00:06:15.330> let<00:06:15.600> them<00:06:15.720> simmer<00:06:15.960> for<00:06:16.200> about<00:06:16.320> an

cover and let them simmer for about an

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:22.550 
cover and let them simmer for about an
hour<00:06:20.360> I'll<00:06:21.360> occasionally<00:06:21.750> check<00:06:22.290> the<00:06:22.410> water

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:22.560 
hour I'll occasionally check the water

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:24.230 
hour I'll occasionally check the water
level<00:06:22.979> and<00:06:23.130> if<00:06:23.250> it<00:06:23.370> gets<00:06:23.580> too<00:06:23.790> low

level and if it gets too low

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:26.210 
level and if it gets too low
meaning<00:06:24.780> if<00:06:24.930> it's<00:06:25.080> not<00:06:25.260> fully<00:06:25.560> covering<00:06:26.040> the

meaning if it's not fully covering the

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:29.659 
meaning if it's not fully covering the
beans<00:06:26.430> I'll<00:06:26.729> add<00:06:27.240> more<00:06:27.510> in<00:06:27.890> now<00:06:28.890> cooking<00:06:29.400> times

00:06:29.659 --> 00:06:29.669 
beans I'll add more in now cooking times

beans I'll add more in now cooking times
can<00:06:29.910> be<00:06:30.060> a<00:06:30.090> little<00:06:30.479> bit<00:06:30.600> different<00:06:31.110> depending

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:31.590 
can be a little bit different depending

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:34.100 
can be a little bit different depending
on<00:06:32.070> the<00:06:32.190> type<00:06:32.430> and<00:06:32.640> age<00:06:33.030> of<00:06:33.210> the<00:06:33.270> beans<00:06:33.540> but

on the type and age of the beans but

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:36.890 
on the type and age of the beans but
generally<00:06:34.680> it<00:06:34.860> takes<00:06:35.100> about<00:06:35.250> an<00:06:35.430> hour<00:06:35.580> to<00:06:35.970> test

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:36.900 
generally it takes about an hour to test

generally it takes about an hour to test
for<00:06:37.229> doneness<00:06:37.650> just<00:06:38.550> taste<00:06:38.790> the<00:06:38.940> bean<00:06:39.180> and<00:06:39.330> see

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:39.900 
for doneness just taste the bean and see

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:41.719 
for doneness just taste the bean and see
if<00:06:40.050> it<00:06:40.169> tastes<00:06:40.470> soft<00:06:40.740> enough<00:06:41.010> to<00:06:41.070> your<00:06:41.340> liking

00:06:41.719 --> 00:06:41.729
