is really unique and we do that like

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.910 
is really unique and we do that like
co-locating<00:01:36.490> the<00:01:37.170> complementary<00:01:38.170> groups<00:01:38.500> and

co-locating the complementary groups and
skill<00:01:39.310> sets<00:01:39.340> we're<00:01:40.300> able<00:01:40.510> to<00:01:40.750> communicate

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:43.770 
skill sets we're able to communicate
very<00:01:41.980> very<00:01:42.280> rapidly<00:01:42.460> between<00:01:42.910> designer<00:01:43.570> and

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 
very very rapidly between designer and

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.530 
very very rapidly between designer and
engineer<00:01:44.070> therefore<00:01:45.070> you<00:01:45.550> can<00:01:45.760> then<00:01:45.970> find

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:46.540 
engineer therefore you can then find
