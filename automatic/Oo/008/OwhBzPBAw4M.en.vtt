this foundation will last me but the

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:07.810 
this foundation will last me but the

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:07.820 
finish of this it's not mat and it's not

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:12.790 
finish of this it's not mat and it's not
doing<00:03:08.420> it's<00:03:09.050> a<00:03:09.230> natural<00:03:10.840> kind<00:03:11.840> of<00:03:12.020> a<00:03:12.140> satin

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:12.800

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.570 
doing it's a natural kind of a satin
finish<00:03:12.830> but<00:03:13.670> it<00:03:13.820> does<00:03:14.180> give<00:03:14.810> you<00:03:15.170> a<00:03:15.320> little<00:03:15.950> bit

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:16.580 
finish but it does give you a little bit

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:20.710 
finish but it does give you a little bit
of<00:03:16.970> a<00:03:17.900> glow<00:03:18.200> a<00:03:18.560> little<00:03:19.100> bit<00:03:19.280> I<00:03:19.610> think<00:03:20.209> that<00:03:20.330> II

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
of a glow a little bit I think that II

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.729 
of a glow a little bit I think that II
skin<00:03:21.140> type<00:03:21.440> can<00:03:21.739> wear<00:03:21.920> this<00:03:22.190> except<00:03:22.910> for

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:23.739 
skin type can wear this except for

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:27.250 
skin type can wear this except for
extremely<00:03:24.739> oily<00:03:25.100> skin<00:03:25.820> I<00:03:26.120> can<00:03:26.630> see<00:03:27.020> it

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
extremely oily skin I can see it

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:32.170 
extremely oily skin I can see it
breaking<00:03:27.739> down<00:03:28.250> on<00:03:28.989> really<00:03:29.989> only<00:03:30.260> skin<00:03:30.890> up<00:03:31.370> but

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
breaking down on really only skin up but

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.810 
breaking down on really only skin up but
I<00:03:32.270> have<00:03:32.480> dry<00:03:32.780> skin<00:03:33.170> sometimes<00:03:34.100> I<00:03:34.220> have<00:03:34.370> normal

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:34.820 
I have dry skin sometimes I have normal

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:38.699 
I have dry skin sometimes I have normal
skin<00:03:35.000> sometimes<00:03:35.540> I<00:03:35.810> have<00:03:35.959> combo<00:03:36.650> skin<00:03:37.060> so<00:03:38.060> uh

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709 
skin sometimes I have combo skin so uh

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:42.460 
skin sometimes I have combo skin so uh
if<00:03:39.709> I<00:03:39.920> get<00:03:40.100> really<00:03:40.640> only<00:03:41.209> if<00:03:41.720> it's<00:03:41.870> really<00:03:42.230> hot

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:42.470 
if I get really only if it's really hot

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:45.070 
if I get really only if it's really hot
and<00:03:42.680> humid<00:03:42.890> outside<00:03:43.810> then<00:03:44.810> it'll<00:03:44.959> start

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:45.080 
and humid outside then it'll start

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:47.890 
and humid outside then it'll start
breaking<00:03:45.709> down<00:03:45.739> right<00:03:46.160> here<00:03:46.489> but<00:03:47.180> to<00:03:47.510> prevent

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900 
breaking down right here but to prevent

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:53.830 
breaking down right here but to prevent
that<00:03:48.280> hold<00:03:49.280> on<00:03:49.459> hold<00:03:49.850> on<00:03:52.180> okay<00:03:53.180> I<00:03:53.450> think<00:03:53.660> I

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 
that hold on hold on okay I think I

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.790 
that hold on hold on okay I think I
booger<00:03:54.670> to<00:03:55.670> prevent<00:03:56.180> that<00:03:56.360> I<00:03:56.570> feel<00:03:57.170> like<00:03:57.410> with

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:57.800 
booger to prevent that I feel like with

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:03.280 
booger to prevent that I feel like with
this<00:03:58.010> down<00:03:58.310> Basin<00:03:58.910> you<00:03:59.440> really<00:04:00.440> need<00:04:01.400> a<00:04:02.290> primer

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.290 
this down Basin you really need a primer

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:06.370 
this down Basin you really need a primer
with<00:04:03.590> this<00:04:04.209> to<00:04:05.209> keep<00:04:05.420> it<00:04:05.600> from<00:04:05.720> breaking<00:04:05.900> up

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:06.380 
with this to keep it from breaking up

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:10.509 
with this to keep it from breaking up
after<00:04:07.340> about<00:04:07.610> six<00:04:08.120> hours<00:04:08.680> sometimes<00:04:09.680> if<00:04:10.130> it's

00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:10.519 
after about six hours sometimes if it's

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:12.340 
after about six hours sometimes if it's
really<00:04:10.910> hot<00:04:11.090> and<00:04:11.209> humid<00:04:11.390> outside<00:04:11.660> it<00:04:12.110> can

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:12.350 
really hot and humid outside it can

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:14.370 
really hot and humid outside it can
start<00:04:12.890> breaking<00:04:13.370> up<00:04:13.489> on<00:04:13.790> me

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:14.380 
start breaking up on me

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:16.920 
start breaking up on me
if<00:04:14.470> it's<00:04:14.650> really<00:04:14.950> hot<00:04:15.160> and<00:04:15.310> humid<00:04:15.520> so<00:04:16.270> if<00:04:16.450> I<00:04:16.570> put

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 
if it's really hot and humid so if I put

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:19.260 
if it's really hot and humid so if I put
on<00:04:17.140> just<00:04:17.590> any<00:04:17.920> primer<00:04:18.400> doesn't<00:04:19.120> matter

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:19.270 
on just any primer doesn't matter

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:24.060 
on just any primer doesn't matter
drugstore<00:04:19.989> Randall<00:04:20.590> has<00:04:20.860> a<00:04:20.890> good<00:04:21.160> one<00:04:21.690> then<00:04:23.070> it

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.070 
drugstore Randall has a good one then it

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:27.060 
drugstore Randall has a good one then it
prevents<00:04:24.940> that<00:04:25.150> so<00:04:25.480> do<00:04:25.720> this<00:04:26.230> it's<00:04:26.650> expensive

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
prevents that so do this it's expensive

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:30.540 
prevents that so do this it's expensive
it<00:04:27.370> as<00:04:27.520> thick<00:04:27.730> as<00:04:28.360> it<00:04:28.420> is<00:04:29.070> really<00:04:30.070> needs<00:04:30.340> a

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.550 
it as thick as it is really needs a

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:33.210 
it as thick as it is really needs a
primer<00:04:30.940> with<00:04:31.270> it<00:04:31.510> to<00:04:32.110> make<00:04:32.290> it<00:04:32.500> last<00:04:32.710> all<00:04:33.130> day

primer with it to make it last all day
in<00:04:33.970> my<00:04:34.450> opinion<00:04:34.840> oh<00:04:35.200> it's<00:04:35.980> got<00:04:36.130> great<00:04:36.790> super

in my opinion oh it's got great super

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:39.630 
in my opinion oh it's got great super
great<00:04:37.990> coverage<00:04:38.440> it's<00:04:38.800> supposed<00:04:39.220> to<00:04:39.460> be

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:39.640 
great coverage it's supposed to be

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:41.940 
great coverage it's supposed to be
waterproof<00:04:40.450> but<00:04:40.900> like<00:04:41.050> I<00:04:41.230> said<00:04:41.290> when<00:04:41.920> you

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:41.950

sweating and all that I can see it

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:47.910 
sweating and all that I can see it
breaking<00:04:44.590> up<00:04:45.070> but<00:04:46.000> the<00:04:46.210> finish<00:04:46.660> is<00:04:46.930> absolutely

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:47.920 
breaking up but the finish is absolutely

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:52.010
