00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:05.970
 Hi everyone, I'll teach you one in this video. 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:09.090
 wool dessert was super easy and 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:11.610
 to start choosing the right 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.110
 gelatin flavors of your choice and 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.250
 prepare the way you are 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.650
 accustomed 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.869
 This is the way I think it's easier. 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.949
 I first put hot water in the 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:24.449
 bridge and then added the gelatin powder 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:26.369
 and then I stirred until I dissolved 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.109
 completely 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.140
 if you want you can also put water 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:34.230
 cold but I do not see need is left 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.989
 your criteria and flavors that I chose 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:41.390
 for this recipe is where strawberry 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:45.239
 lemon raspberry and passion fruit 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:46.829
 I also used the different pots to 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.850
 you see that this does not interfere with 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:52.850
 nothing they only need to be relatively 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.850
 fulfilled 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.460
 O 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:30.230
 set aside in the refrigerator until 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:47.210
 quite hard so that after 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:50.440
 You can cut them using a knife. 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:55.610
 cut horizontally and vertically 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:59.650
 I made small cubes, you too. 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:01.250
 can see that cuts do not need to be 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:05.530
 right 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.530
 no it will not interfere with the result 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:23.660
 then choose a container with lid 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:26.660
 so you can dump your club 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.660
 gelatine 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:21.500
 for the next step you just go 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:24.460
 need to put a can of milk 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:28.640
 condensed milk and a box of sour cream 

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:30.860
 modifier and after mixing the right 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:33.320
 It is even called colorless gelatin in this 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:34.160
 process but I think it's soft 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:36.530
 same 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:39.620
 so with this part I would not be able to 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:43.810
 do this because people prefer 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:43.810
 Make her harder 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:04:16.060
 Î', Î', Î', Î', ô, ô ô ô ô 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:19.570
 O 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:34.290
 then dump this mixture the 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:35.940
 cubes gelatin gives a stir stayed 

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:37.050
 well and mix well 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:40.740
 colorful 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:43.580
 then just take it in the fridge and 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.580
 can serve 

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:20.050
 I really hope you liked it. 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:21.129
 that left to do at home is 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:24.419
 a delight 

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:24.419
 Kisses and until next time
