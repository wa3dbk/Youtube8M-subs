and I'll show you when we get to the

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
and I'll show you when we get to the
athleticism<00:01:39.720> because<00:01:39.960> you're<00:01:40.170> probably

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
athleticism because you're probably

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.080

going<00:01:55.740> to<00:01:55.830> me<00:01:55.890> anymore<00:01:56.100> because<00:01:56.400> you<00:01:56.610> actually

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
going to me anymore because you actually

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.429 
going to me anymore because you actually
have<00:01:57.090> strength<00:01:57.479> on<00:01:57.689> this<00:01:57.869> build<00:01:58.110> all<00:01:58.290> right

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
have strength on this build all right

00:01:58.439 --> 00:01:59.960 
have strength on this build all right
and<00:01:58.650> he's<00:01:58.920> a<00:01:58.950> little<00:01:59.159> bit<00:01:59.310> bigger<00:01:59.490> so<00:01:59.610> you<00:01:59.790> get

00:01:59.960 --> 00:01:59.970 
and he's a little bit bigger so you get

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:01.700 
and he's a little bit bigger so you get
a<00:02:00.000> better<00:02:00.210> shot<00:02:00.360> you<00:02:00.810> don't<00:02:00.990> need<00:02:01.229> that<00:02:01.260> power

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
a better shot you don't need that power

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.200 
a better shot you don't need that power
he<00:02:01.890> just<00:02:02.070> needs<00:02:02.220> a<00:02:02.280> pretty<00:02:02.520> good<00:02:02.640> accuracy<00:02:03.000> all

I found and I know I said it before that
you<00:02:25.410> don't<00:02:25.620> need<00:02:25.770> it<00:02:25.950> there's<00:02:26.760> a<00:02:26.849> difference

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
at 83 so like I said this is just a

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.320 
at 83 so like I said this is just a
representation<00:02:50.099> of<00:02:50.549> what<00:02:50.700> I<00:02:50.730> think<00:02:51.150> that

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
representation of what I think that

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.990 
representation of what I think that
they'll<00:02:51.510> turn<00:02:51.720> into<00:02:52.049> not<00:02:52.799> a<00:02:53.010> real<00:02:53.400> actual

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
they'll turn into not a real actual

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.330 
they'll turn into not a real actual
number<00:02:54.480> all<00:02:54.599> right<00:02:54.629> now<00:02:55.200> I<00:02:55.470> will<00:02:55.799> continue<00:02:56.220> and

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
number all right now I will continue and

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.160 
number all right now I will continue and
show<00:02:56.489> you<00:02:56.549> guys<00:02:56.760> exactly<00:02:57.000> how<00:02:57.569> he<00:02:57.630> plays<00:02:57.900> in

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
show you guys exactly how he plays in

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.140 
show you guys exactly how he plays in
the<00:02:58.200> game<00:02:58.349> so<00:02:58.769> let's<00:02:58.980> jump<00:02:59.250> in<00:02:59.489> there<00:02:59.700> and<00:02:59.849> i'll

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
the game so let's jump in there and i'll

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.839 
the game so let's jump in there and i'll
see<00:03:00.330> you<00:03:00.360> guys<00:03:00.450> on<00:03:00.840> the<00:03:00.930> other<00:03:00.959> side<00:03:01.430> hey<00:03:02.430> guys

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:20.809 
was much better we had a number of
penalty<00:03:19.860> minutes<00:03:19.980> that's<00:03:20.310> probably<00:03:20.700> the

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:20.819 
penalty minutes that's probably the

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:21.979 
penalty minutes that's probably the

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
reason why we did it but look at the

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:25.030 
reason why we did it but look at the

where<00:03:26.040> the<00:03:26.160> total<00:03:26.519> for<00:03:26.730> faceoffs

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
where the total for faceoffs

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.270

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:38.250 
no I must not have got a shot with it

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:40.260 
no I must not have got a shot with it

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:40.270 
but there was a puck put at net i

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:41.820 
but there was a puck put at net i
deflected<00:04:40.600> it<00:04:40.900> hit<00:04:41.020> the<00:04:41.110> back<00:04:41.260> wall<00:04:41.290> that's<00:04:41.710> it

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:41.830 
deflected it hit the back wall that's it

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:43.379 
deflected it hit the back wall that's it
bouncing<00:04:42.250> backwards<00:04:42.670> and<00:04:42.880> then<00:04:43.060> he<00:04:43.240> just

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:43.389 
bouncing backwards and then he just

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:45.300 
bouncing backwards and then he just
talked<00:04:43.570> it<00:04:43.690> backwards<00:04:44.110> like<00:04:44.260> that<00:04:44.470> so<00:04:44.980> it<00:04:45.100> bad

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:45.310 
talked it backwards like that so it bad

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:48.150 
talked it backwards like that so it bad
I<00:04:45.490> tipped<00:04:45.820> it<00:04:46.290> bout<00:04:47.290> that's<00:04:47.560> it<00:04:47.740> coming<00:04:48.010> back

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:48.160 
I tipped it bout that's it coming back

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.790 
I tipped it bout that's it coming back
off<00:04:48.400> of<00:04:48.580> the<00:04:48.639> wall<00:04:48.820> and<00:04:49.230> then<00:04:50.230> he<00:04:50.350> just<00:04:50.500> shovels

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:50.800 
off of the wall and then he just shovels

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.320 
off of the wall and then he just shovels
it<00:04:50.889> in<00:04:50.980> there<00:04:51.130> so<00:04:51.250> that<00:04:51.280> was<00:04:51.520> my<00:04:51.550> second<00:04:52.090> assist

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:52.330 
it in there so that was my second assist

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.420 
it in there so that was my second assist
so<00:04:52.419> that<00:04:52.540> was<00:04:52.630> a<00:04:52.660> goal<00:04:52.870> and<00:04:53.020> two<00:04:53.230> assists<00:04:53.590> I

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:54.430 
so that was a goal and two assists I

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:56.280 
so that was a goal and two assists I
don't<00:04:55.180> think<00:04:55.389> I<00:04:55.419> got<00:04:55.450> any<00:04:55.600> hits<00:04:55.990> and<00:04:56.200> I

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:56.290 
don't think I got any hits and I

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:59.129 
don't think I got any hits and I
seriously<00:04:56.650> doubt<00:04:56.919> I<00:04:56.950> did<00:04:57.190> maybe<00:04:57.460> 12<00:04:58.419> hits<00:04:58.660> now

00:04:59.129 --> 00:04:59.139 
seriously doubt I did maybe 12 hits now

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:01.050 
seriously doubt I did maybe 12 hits now
they<00:04:59.320> weren't<00:04:59.560> big<00:04:59.770> now<00:05:00.370> this<00:05:00.580> is<00:05:00.730> exactly

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:01.060 
they weren't big now this is exactly

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:03.390 
they weren't big now this is exactly
what<00:05:01.389> i<00:05:01.419> wanted<00:05:01.690> to<00:05:01.780> obtain<00:05:02.110> when<00:05:03.010> i<00:05:03.040> went<00:05:03.310> with

what i wanted to obtain when i went with

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.870

people out that is not what this build
is<00:05:25.390> this<00:05:25.870> is<00:05:26.020> purely<00:05:26.410> about<00:05:26.710> being<00:05:26.979> a<00:05:27.190> dominant

is this is purely about being a dominant
physical<00:05:28.210> force<00:05:28.450> out<00:05:28.660> there<00:05:29.010> and<00:05:30.010> you'll<00:05:30.550> see

00:05:30.659 --> 00:05:30.669 
physical force out there and you'll see

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:32.909 
physical force out there and you'll see
by<00:05:30.820> the<00:05:30.880> faceoffs<00:05:31.330> being<00:05:31.600> 26<00:05:31.960> 28<00:05:32.200> and<00:05:32.560> it<00:05:32.800> was

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:32.919 
by the faceoffs being 26 28 and it was

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:35.010 
by the faceoffs being 26 28 and it was
against<00:05:33.130> the<00:05:33.250> human<00:05:33.550> 26<00:05:34.210> 28<00:05:34.360> were<00:05:34.690> the<00:05:34.840> face

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:35.020 
against the human 26 28 were the face

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:37.020 
against the human 26 28 were the face
off<00:05:35.229> it<00:05:35.530> was<00:05:35.680> just<00:05:35.860> unbelievable<00:05:36.070> numbers<00:05:36.850> for

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:37.030 
off it was just unbelievable numbers for

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:39.060 
off it was just unbelievable numbers for
me<00:05:37.120> so<00:05:37.600> you<00:05:37.630> can<00:05:37.810> see<00:05:38.020> right<00:05:38.050> there<00:05:38.680> that<00:05:38.710> this

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:39.070 
me so you can see right there that this

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:40.740 
me so you can see right there that this
is<00:05:39.190> a<00:05:39.220> solid<00:05:39.729> center<00:05:40.000> because<00:05:40.150> he<00:05:40.360> has<00:05:40.510> that

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:40.750 
is a solid center because he has that

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:43.020 
is a solid center because he has that
strength<00:05:41.050> he<00:05:41.590> has<00:05:41.770> that<00:05:41.979> balance<00:05:42.490> he's<00:05:42.850> a<00:05:42.880> good

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:43.030 
strength he has that balance he's a good

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:44.610 
strength he has that balance he's a good
pivot<00:05:43.570> the<00:05:44.080> only<00:05:44.229> thing<00:05:44.380> that<00:05:44.500> I<00:05:44.530> would

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:44.620 
pivot the only thing that I would

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:46.620 
pivot the only thing that I would
increase<00:05:45.280> very<00:05:45.640> likely<00:05:45.910> would<00:05:46.150> be<00:05:46.240> my<00:05:46.360> poke

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:46.630 
increase very likely would be my poke

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:48.240 
increase very likely would be my poke
check<00:05:46.990> I<00:05:47.140> think<00:05:47.350> that<00:05:47.470> that<00:05:47.500> was<00:05:47.830> a<00:05:47.860> little<00:05:48.070> bit

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:48.250 
check I think that that was a little bit

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:50.909 
check I think that that was a little bit
low<00:05:48.810> you<00:05:49.810> might<00:05:49.990> have<00:05:50.110> to<00:05:50.229> sacrifice<00:05:50.410> um

00:05:50.909 --> 00:05:50.919 
low you might have to sacrifice um

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:52.469 
low you might have to sacrifice um
defensive<00:05:51.190> awareness<00:05:51.789> in<00:05:51.880> order<00:05:52.090> to<00:05:52.180> get<00:05:52.300> some

00:05:52.469 --> 00:05:52.479 
defensive awareness in order to get some

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:54.870 
defensive awareness in order to get some
poke<00:05:52.660> check<00:05:52.930> up<00:05:53.110> there<00:05:53.320> but<00:05:53.710> even<00:05:54.010> one<00:05:54.280> or<00:05:54.550> two

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:54.880 
poke check up there but even one or two

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:57.300 
poke check up there but even one or two
would<00:05:55.390> help<00:05:55.600> tremendously<00:05:55.919> just<00:05:56.919> because

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:57.310 
would help tremendously just because

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:00.090 
would help tremendously just because
right<00:05:57.580> now<00:05:57.610> is<00:05:57.970> just<00:05:58.210> not<00:05:58.270> quite<00:05:59.020> there<00:05:59.350> it's

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:00.100 
right now is just not quite there it's

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:02.159 
right now is just not quite there it's
pretty<00:06:00.340> good<00:06:00.430> but<00:06:00.970> not<00:06:01.120> quite<00:06:01.150> there<00:06:01.570> anyway

00:06:02.159 --> 00:06:02.169 
pretty good but not quite there anyway

00:06:02.169 --> 00:06:04.170 
pretty good but not quite there anyway
