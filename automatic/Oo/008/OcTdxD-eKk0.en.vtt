can<00:00:42.440> you<00:00:42.620> guess<00:00:42.920> what<00:00:43.309> is<00:00:43.460> common<00:00:43.969> in<00:00:44.090> all<00:00:44.329> of

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:44.510 
can you guess what is common in all of

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:50.380 
can you guess what is common in all of
them<00:00:46.390> yes<00:00:47.390> it<00:00:48.320> is<00:00:48.620> that<00:00:48.890> round<00:00:49.220> object<00:00:49.820> called

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:50.390 
them yes it is that round object called

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.899 
them yes it is that round object called
as<00:00:50.629> wheel<00:00:51.079> on<00:00:51.680> which<00:00:52.100> all<00:00:52.339> these<00:00:52.699> vehicles<00:00:53.089> run

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:54.909 
as wheel on which all these vehicles run

00:00:54.909 --> 00:01:00.780 
as wheel on which all these vehicles run
the<00:00:55.909> bus<00:00:56.149> has<00:00:56.449> wheels<00:00:56.780> so<00:00:58.059> does<00:00:59.059> bicycle<00:00:59.750> and

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:00.790 
the bus has wheels so does bicycle and

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:07.330 
the bus has wheels so does bicycle and
so<00:01:01.790> does<00:01:02.120> the<00:01:02.300> car<00:01:05.200> it<00:01:06.200> is<00:01:06.259> a<00:01:06.440> great<00:01:06.830> invention

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
so does the car it is a great invention

the primitive men used to live in

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.460 
the primitive men used to live in
jungles<00:01:31.850> they<00:01:32.850> used<00:01:33.150> to<00:01:33.330> kill<00:01:33.509> animals<00:01:33.869> for

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
jungles they used to kill animals for

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.539 
jungles they used to kill animals for
their<00:01:34.619> food<00:01:34.920> and<00:01:36.500> used<00:01:37.500> to<00:01:37.710> carry<00:01:38.009> them<00:01:38.310> for

their food and used to carry them for
long<00:01:38.759> distances<00:01:39.479> to<00:01:39.689> their<00:01:40.200> cave<00:01:42.080> one<00:01:43.080> day<00:01:43.289> it

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
long distances to their cave one day it

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.550 
long distances to their cave one day it
is<00:01:43.710> believed<00:01:44.130> that<00:01:44.460> a<00:01:44.850> caveman<00:01:45.270> saw<00:01:45.840> a<00:01:46.049> log<00:01:46.320> of

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
is believed that a caveman saw a log of

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.529 
is believed that a caveman saw a log of
wood<00:01:46.830> rolling<00:01:47.580> down<00:01:49.100> he<00:01:50.100> got<00:01:50.369> very<00:01:50.700> interested

00:01:51.529 --> 00:01:51.539 
wood rolling down he got very interested

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:56.710 
wood rolling down he got very interested
as<00:01:51.960> to<00:01:52.020> how<00:01:52.619> the<00:01:53.280> log<00:01:53.490> of<00:01:53.789> wood<00:01:54.060> was<00:01:54.330> rolling

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:56.720 
as to how the log of wood was rolling

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.050 
as to how the log of wood was rolling
another<00:01:57.720> day<00:01:58.020> an<00:01:58.280> animal<00:01:59.280> was<00:01:59.490> kept<00:01:59.789> on<00:01:59.970> the

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
another day an animal was kept on the

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.740 
another day an animal was kept on the
logs<00:02:00.509> of<00:02:00.780> wood<00:02:00.810> and<00:02:01.619> slowly<00:02:02.340> as<00:02:02.729> the<00:02:03.299> log<00:02:03.509> of

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
logs of wood and slowly as the log of

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.950 
logs of wood and slowly as the log of
wood<00:02:04.020> moved<00:02:04.409> the<00:02:05.159> animal<00:02:05.700> was<00:02:05.909> displaced<00:02:06.360> from

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
wood moved the animal was displaced from

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.029 
wood moved the animal was displaced from
its<00:02:06.990> position<00:02:08.690> this<00:02:09.690> excited<00:02:10.350> the<00:02:10.530> caveman

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
its position this excited the caveman

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.509 
its position this excited the caveman
too<00:02:12.890> very<00:02:13.890> soon

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:14.519 
too very soon

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:18.170 
too very soon
the<00:02:14.850> caveman<00:02:15.120> took<00:02:15.660> a<00:02:15.870> log<00:02:16.110> of<00:02:16.350> wood<00:02:16.620> and<00:02:17.549> cut

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
the caveman took a log of wood and cut

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.580 
the caveman took a log of wood and cut
it<00:02:18.360> from<00:02:18.390> one<00:02:18.870> side<00:02:19.170> to<00:02:19.440> form<00:02:19.920> a<00:02:20.100> round<00:02:20.430> object

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
it from one side to form a round object

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.620 
it from one side to form a round object
which<00:02:22.590> finally<00:02:23.220> came<00:02:23.489> to<00:02:23.670> be<00:02:23.790> known<00:02:23.819> as<00:02:24.209> the

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
which finally came to be known as the

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:29.599 
which finally came to be known as the
wheel<00:02:26.540> now<00:02:27.540> slowly<00:02:27.930> wheels<00:02:28.830> were<00:02:29.130> used<00:02:29.400> to

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:29.609 
wheel now slowly wheels were used to

00:02:29.609 --> 00:02:32.479 
wheel now slowly wheels were used to
take<00:02:29.820> killed<00:02:30.180> animals<00:02:30.690> from<00:02:31.380> the<00:02:31.560> forest<00:02:32.040> to

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
take killed animals from the forest to

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:37.610 
take killed animals from the forest to
cave<00:02:32.760> man's<00:02:33.090> home<00:02:33.420> and<00:02:35.150> slowly<00:02:36.170> Bullock<00:02:37.170> carts

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
cave man's home and slowly Bullock carts

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:43.380 
cave man's home and slowly Bullock carts
and<00:02:38.570> horse<00:02:39.570> carts<00:02:40.019> also<00:02:40.530> came<00:02:40.769> into<00:02:41.040> existence

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
and horse carts also came into existence

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:50.190 
and horse carts also came into existence
so<00:02:44.390> this<00:02:44.659> is<00:02:44.840> how<00:02:45.049> the<00:02:45.110> wheel<00:02:45.500> was<00:02:45.860> invented

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:59.600 

students<00:02:51.200> isn't<00:02:51.739> this<00:02:52.069> an<00:02:52.280> interesting<00:02:52.640> story
