00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
see I've got the big KTM 13 litre tank

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.360 
see I've got the big KTM 13 litre tank
on<00:00:50.850> here<00:00:51.199> this<00:00:52.199> is<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.500> same<00:00:52.680> tank<00:00:52.860> we<00:00:53.039> had<00:00:53.190> on

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
on here this is the same tank we had on

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.479 
on here this is the same tank we had on
the<00:00:53.489> 500<00:00:54.090> earlier<00:00:54.390> this<00:00:54.600> year<00:00:54.710> I<00:00:55.710> like<00:00:56.129> it<00:00:56.309> it

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
the 500 earlier this year I like it it

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.760 
the 500 earlier this year I like it it
works<00:00:56.699> pretty<00:00:56.940> well<00:00:57.090> one<00:00:58.020> thing<00:00:58.379> about<00:00:58.410> it

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
works pretty well one thing about it

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.750 
works pretty well one thing about it
this<00:00:58.920> is<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.309> only<00:00:59.850> tank<00:01:00.920> available<00:01:01.920> that

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
this is the only tank available that

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.679 
this is the only tank available that
gives<00:01:03.059> you<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:04.290> opportunity<00:01:05.100> to<00:01:05.360> still<00:01:06.360> leave

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
gives you the opportunity to still leave

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.039 
gives you the opportunity to still leave
the<00:01:07.580> charcoal<00:01:08.580> canister<00:01:08.850> and<00:01:09.360> all<00:01:09.630> of<00:01:09.840> the

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
the charcoal canister and all of the

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.600 
the charcoal canister and all of the
smog<00:01:10.500> paraphernalia<00:01:11.460> into<00:01:11.939> intact<00:01:13.610> the

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
smog paraphernalia into intact the

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.130 
smog paraphernalia into intact the
downside<00:01:15.090> is<00:01:15.270> you're<00:01:15.450> giving<00:01:15.689> up<00:01:15.810> a<00:01:15.900> little

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
downside is you're giving up a little

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.100 
downside is you're giving up a little
bit<00:01:16.320> of<00:01:16.439> fuel<00:01:16.590> space<00:01:16.920> for<00:01:17.250> that<00:01:17.460> but<00:01:17.900> it's<00:01:18.900> nice

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
bit of fuel space for that but it's nice

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.300 
bit of fuel space for that but it's nice
that<00:01:19.170> you<00:01:19.380> can<00:01:19.439> run<00:01:19.680> it<00:01:19.799> and<00:01:19.890> leave<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.040> bike

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
that you can run it and leave the bike

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.330 
that you can run it and leave the bike
totally<00:01:20.909> stock<00:01:21.439> you<00:01:22.439> can<00:01:22.560> also<00:01:22.710> see<00:01:23.009> we've<00:01:23.189> got

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
totally stock you can also see we've got

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.179 
totally stock you can also see we've got
the<00:01:23.490> giant<00:01:23.820> loop<00:01:23.909> tank<00:01:24.150> bag<00:01:24.360> on<00:01:24.710> you<00:01:25.710> know<00:01:25.830> for

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
the giant loop tank bag on you know for

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.530 
the giant loop tank bag on you know for
a<00:01:26.220> couple<00:01:26.490> of<00:01:26.549> years<00:01:26.729> I've<00:01:26.939> been<00:01:27.060> using<00:01:27.299> the

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
a couple of years I've been using the

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.330 
a couple of years I've been using the
giant<00:01:27.840> loop<00:01:28.049> Mojave<00:01:28.439> bag<00:01:28.710> that<00:01:28.950> sits<00:01:29.159> back

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
giant loop Mojave bag that sits back

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.749 
giant loop Mojave bag that sits back
here<00:01:29.729> and<00:01:29.850> I<00:01:29.909> really<00:01:30.270> like<00:01:30.479> that<00:01:30.509> thing<00:01:30.930> but<00:01:31.170> I

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:31.759 
here and I really like that thing but I

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:34.219 
here and I really like that thing but I
the<00:01:32.759> tank<00:01:33.000> bag<00:01:33.210> now<00:01:33.420> that<00:01:33.570> I've<00:01:33.659> got<00:01:33.869> it's<00:01:34.049> one

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
the tank bag now that I've got it's one

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.170 
the tank bag now that I've got it's one
of<00:01:34.320> those<00:01:34.409> things<00:01:34.680> I<00:01:34.829> just<00:01:34.860> wonder<00:01:35.729> how<00:01:35.759> I<00:01:35.939> ever

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
of those things I just wonder how I ever

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.030 
of those things I just wonder how I ever
lived<00:01:36.450> without<00:01:36.630> it<00:01:37.020> it<00:01:37.439> doesn't<00:01:37.860> look<00:01:38.009> very

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
lived without it it doesn't look very

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.069 
lived without it it doesn't look very
big<00:01:38.520> but<00:01:38.700> I<00:01:38.729> can<00:01:38.759> actually<00:01:39.240> stuff<00:01:39.540> quite<00:01:39.840> a<00:01:39.869> bit

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
big but I can actually stuff quite a bit

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.440 
big but I can actually stuff quite a bit
of<00:01:40.140> stuff<00:01:40.320> in<00:01:40.470> there<00:01:40.680> it's<00:01:40.979> just<00:01:41.640> really<00:01:41.909> handy

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
of stuff in there it's just really handy

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.569 
of stuff in there it's just really handy
to<00:01:42.570> use<00:01:42.600> out<00:01:42.960> on<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.200> trail<00:01:43.439> all<00:01:43.649> day<00:01:46.579> we've

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579
