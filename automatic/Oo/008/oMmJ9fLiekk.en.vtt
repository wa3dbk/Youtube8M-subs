this<00:00:12.179> is<00:00:12.360> a<00:00:12.389> cool<00:00:12.780> MOC<00:00:12.990> it<00:00:13.259> looks<00:00:13.469> like<00:00:13.650> if<00:00:13.950> I

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
this is a cool MOC it looks like if I

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.160 
this is a cool MOC it looks like if I
could<00:00:14.670> determine<00:00:14.940> based<00:00:15.269> on<00:00:15.420> the<00:00:15.509> size<00:00:15.780> of<00:00:15.990> it

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
could determine based on the size of it

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.260 
could determine based on the size of it
if<00:00:16.770> it<00:00:16.980> was<00:00:17.130> a<00:00:17.160> real<00:00:17.400> Lego<00:00:17.640> set<00:00:17.970> it<00:00:18.150> would

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
if it was a real Lego set it would

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.490 
if it was a real Lego set it would
probably<00:00:18.420> around<00:00:19.279> $25<00:00:20.300> um<00:00:21.300> but<00:00:21.900> it's<00:00:22.020> cool<00:00:22.230> I

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
probably around $25 um but it's cool I

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.769 
probably around $25 um but it's cool I
have<00:00:22.650> a<00:00:22.710> lot<00:00:22.830> of<00:00:22.859> minifigures<00:00:23.130> in<00:00:23.580> here<00:00:23.880> um<00:00:24.720> I

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
have a lot of minifigures in here um I

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.210 
have a lot of minifigures in here um I
made<00:00:25.320> it<00:00:25.380> look<00:00:25.439> a<00:00:25.529> lot<00:00:25.680> I<00:00:25.710> try<00:00:25.859> to<00:00:25.920> make<00:00:26.039> it<00:00:26.070> look

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
made it look a lot I try to make it look

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.070

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
started so let me just first start by

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.440 
started so let me just first start by
showing<00:00:32.189> there's<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:32.790> platform's<00:00:33.300> it's

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
showing there's the platform's it's

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.229 
showing there's the platform's it's
built<00:00:33.690> on<00:00:34.399> but<00:00:35.399> that's<00:00:35.579> basically<00:00:35.940> what<00:00:36.090> I<00:00:36.120> do

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
built on but that's basically what I do

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.330 
built on but that's basically what I do
I<00:00:36.300> take<00:00:36.480> big<00:00:36.690> platforms<00:00:37.260> pull<00:00:37.469> my<00:00:37.620> box<00:00:37.829> on<00:00:38.040> and

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
I take big platforms pull my box on and

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.479 
I take big platforms pull my box on and
then<00:00:38.850> use<00:00:39.030> smaller<00:00:39.570> one<00:00:40.410> by<00:00:40.590> some<00:00:40.860> platforms

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
then use smaller one by some platforms

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.229 
then use smaller one by some platforms
you<00:00:41.820> know<00:00:41.910> to<00:00:41.969> connect<00:00:42.570> them<00:00:42.719> all<00:00:42.840> together<00:00:44.239> so

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
you know to connect them all together so

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.380 
you know to connect them all together so
it<00:00:46.079> don't<00:00:46.260> lot<00:00:46.469> of<00:00:46.559> my<00:00:46.620> mocks<00:00:47.120> you<00:00:48.120> have<00:00:48.239> two

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
it don't lot of my mocks you have two

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.420 
it don't lot of my mocks you have two
fencing<00:00:48.899> pieces<00:00:49.230> to<00:00:49.379> pick<00:00:49.620> up<00:00:49.739> fencing<00:00:50.129> pieces

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
fencing pieces to pick up fencing pieces

the those pieces were from the 2004
Hogwarts<00:01:37.229> Express<00:01:37.350> not<00:01:37.979> the<00:01:38.100> motorists<00:01:38.490> one

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
it probably did from that one but I

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.410 
it probably did from that one but I
don't<00:01:40.950> add<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:41.400> other<00:01:41.549> one<00:01:41.820> side<00:01:42.240> the

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
don't add the other one side the

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.679 
don't add the other one side the

of<00:06:19.479> a<00:06:19.570> Slytherin<00:06:20.140> house<00:06:20.410> you<00:06:20.800> know<00:06:20.919> I<00:06:21.510> mean

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:22.510 
of a Slytherin house you know I mean

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:24.090 
of a Slytherin house you know I mean
like<00:06:22.660> a<00:06:22.690> lot<00:06:22.810> of<00:06:22.870> like<00:06:23.229> all<00:06:23.440> the<00:06:23.590> blacks<00:06:23.860> were

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:24.100 
like a lot of like all the blacks were

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:26.460 
like a lot of like all the blacks were
in<00:06:24.550> Slytherin<00:06:24.940> so<00:06:25.419> then<00:06:25.990> just<00:06:26.200> have<00:06:26.320> the

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:26.470 
in Slytherin so then just have the

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:27.630 
in Slytherin so then just have the
windows<00:06:26.740> right<00:06:26.890> there<00:06:26.950> and<00:06:27.220> like<00:06:27.430> I<00:06:27.460> said<00:06:27.580> I

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:27.640 
windows right there and like I said I

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:32.540 
windows right there and like I said I
think<00:06:27.820> those<00:06:27.940> make<00:06:28.120> really<00:06:28.330> great<00:06:28.450> windows<00:06:28.930> so

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:32.550 

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:33.839 

so

00:06:33.839 --> 00:06:33.849 
so

00:06:33.849 --> 00:06:36.570 
so
yeah<00:06:34.800> exactly<00:06:35.800> I<00:06:35.830> think<00:06:36.009> that's<00:06:36.189> basically

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:36.580 
yeah exactly I think that's basically
