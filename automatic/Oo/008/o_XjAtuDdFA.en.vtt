00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.129
 next professor kruse please 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.169
 I tried what I got to this 

00:00:05.129 --> 00:00:08.910
 theme how does the internet affect the 

00:00:07.169 --> 00:00:09.870
 Society wanted to say in ten readings 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.309
 summarize 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.360
 you can not do that in three minutes 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.129
 to summarize more but I have myself 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.070
 asked what is so to speak the 

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:18.330
 the core idea behind it and there I am now very much 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.520
 strong on system theoretical 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.680
 I want to come out of perspective 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.600
 you like a basic thesis in the short 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.860
 I believe that space 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.390
 internet the company actually 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.980
 I would change quite seriously 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.290
 even the term revolution 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.300
 There is one for that 

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:36.000
 basic power shift from 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.620
 supplier to demand i believe that 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.300
 because something really happens in all 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.160
 areas of society and that has 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.839
 to do something with the system architecture 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.129
 if you look at what we have in the 

00:00:42.839 --> 00:00:45.449
 last years are then 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.699
 we went and have the 

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:49.079
 networking density in the world seriously 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:51.269
 has never raised such a 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.760
 explosion given then that came 

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:55.050
 web 2.0 in addition to that 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.359
 fact that we have the networking density 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.339
 We hunted it up spontaneously 

00:00:57.359 --> 00:01:01.620
 blown up activity in the systems 

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:03.449
 So more and more people are active in 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.710
 a highly networked system and that 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.660
 third what happened then 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.490
 actually about something like retweet 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:10.350
 function at twitter for example the 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.940
 are circling excitations in the network 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.250
 and when the three things come together 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:16.350
 high crosslink density high spontaneous 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.120
 activity and circling excitement then can 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.560
 I tell you what happens the systems 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.340
 have a tendency to self 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.050
 list 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.390
 that means we will experience that 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:26.250
 suddenly become powerful and powerful 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.410
 Although you can not tell where 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.240
 that happens exactly and the people 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:32.100
 have discovered that for themselves the first 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.060
 motivation of the people in the network was 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.010
 information 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.840
 They wanted access to the information then 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:37.950
 At some point they realized well it is 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.940
 also exciting in the network 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.260
 show 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.910
 then it was about it 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.740
 leave and what people are in 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:45.330
 moment is that you know about the 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.710
 nets can become powerful 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.780
 the people are closing in on each other 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.820
 Movements together and if they are 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.050
 situation still want to predict then 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.430
 I can tell you that will be with these 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:55.170
 basically do not go nets 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.150
 we can look into the glass ball 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.070
 But these are not linear systems 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.330
 they can not do nonlinear systems 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.710
 predict the butterfly effect 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.660
 sits in between 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.120
 we have to understand that 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:08.189
 makes redefined power sits 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:09.929
 When inquiring at the customer and 

00:02:08.189 --> 00:02:11.940
 not with the provider that is we 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.110
 get an extremely strong customer 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.880
 we get an extremely strong one 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.920
 staff and we get one 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.240
 extremely strong citizens of these systems 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.370
 will develop such a dynamic 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:23.990
 that it simply does not grab us 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.990
 can not afford to change us
