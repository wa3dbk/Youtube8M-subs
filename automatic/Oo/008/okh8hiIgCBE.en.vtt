00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:02.209 
quarters of that I was that really

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:05.140 
quarters of that I was that really
interested<00:04:02.990> I<00:04:03.080> thought<00:04:03.350> was<00:04:04.310> this<00:04:04.400> about<00:04:04.550> the

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:06.970 
interested I thought was this about the
bill<00:04:05.300> go<00:04:05.510> and<00:04:05.780> she's<00:04:05.930> now<00:04:06.500> going<00:04:06.620> to<00:04:06.740> become<00:04:06.800> a

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:06.980 
bill go and she's now going to become a

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:08.770

model<00:04:07.220> that<00:04:07.430> fine<00:04:07.730> whatever<00:04:08.030> but<00:04:08.240> before<00:04:08.540> that

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:08.780 
model that fine whatever but before that

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:10.150 
model that fine whatever but before that
it<00:04:08.840> was<00:04:08.959> really<00:04:09.170> interesting<00:04:09.410> look<00:04:09.740> family

somewhere say trees sick trees came in
know<00:04:23.900> what<00:04:24.200> that<00:04:24.380> was<00:04:24.500> about<00:04:24.530> it's<00:04:25.370> a

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460 
know what that was about it's a

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:27.700 
know what that was about it's a
carbon-neutral<00:04:25.880> film<00:04:26.450> parody<00:04:26.840> yeah<00:04:27.169> so

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:27.710 
carbon-neutral film parody yeah so

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:30.640 
carbon-neutral film parody yeah so
that's<00:04:28.550> exactly<00:04:28.820> what<00:04:29.300> is<00:04:29.810> right<00:04:30.080> so<00:04:30.320> it's<00:04:30.500> the

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:30.650 
that's exactly what is right so it's the

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:35.440 
that's exactly what is right so it's the
message<00:04:30.860> is<00:04:31.419> save<00:04:32.419> trees<00:04:33.130> but<00:04:34.130> I<00:04:34.430> think<00:04:35.030> right

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:35.450 
message is save trees but I think right

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:38.260 
message is save trees but I think right
by<00:04:35.660> making<00:04:36.050> your<00:04:36.140> daughter<00:04:36.380> a<00:04:36.560> model<00:04:37.120> but<00:04:38.120> this

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.160 
is where i was gonna get to it i think

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.940 
is where i was gonna get to it i think
the<00:04:40.310> trailer<00:04:40.669> did<00:04:41.090> a<00:04:41.360> really<00:04:41.960> bad<00:04:42.080> job<00:04:42.290> of

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:42.950 
the trailer did a really bad job of

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:45.970 
the trailer did a really bad job of
putting<00:04:43.790> that<00:04:44.120> message<00:04:44.630> forward<00:04:44.930> because<00:04:45.560> hey

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:45.980 
putting that message forward because hey

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:49.510 
putting that message forward because hey
you<00:04:46.340> know<00:04:46.510> love<00:04:47.510> the<00:04:47.720> environment<00:04:48.520> being

eco-friendly all that sort of stuff I

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:53.680 
eco-friendly all that sort of stuff I
just<00:04:52.070> don't<00:04:52.250> think<00:04:52.520> that<00:04:52.580> the<00:04:52.940> the<00:04:52.970> trailer

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:53.690 
just don't think that the the trailer

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:56.730 
just don't think that the the trailer
actually<00:04:53.900> gave<00:04:54.440> that<00:04:54.830> message<00:04:55.460> oh<00:04:55.700> hang<00:04:56.090> on

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:01.520 
but now thinking bad as all that stuff

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.790 
but now thinking bad as all that stuff
for<00:05:01.700> the<00:05:01.790> farming<00:05:02.300> and<00:05:02.570> being<00:05:02.810> our<00:05:02.960> land<00:05:03.380> and

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:03.800 
for the farming and being our land and

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.620 
for the farming and being our land and
all<00:05:03.860> that<00:05:04.010> kind<00:05:04.250> of<00:05:04.310> stuff<00:05:04.370> so<00:05:05.060> then<00:05:05.270> the

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:05.630 
all that kind of stuff so then the

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:07.210 
all that kind of stuff so then the
treasure<00:05:05.870> of<00:05:05.990> the<00:05:06.080> beginning<00:05:06.410> sure<00:05:06.800> probably

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:07.220 
treasure of the beginning sure probably

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:10.540 
treasure of the beginning sure probably
wasn't<00:05:07.820> anything<00:05:08.060> to<00:05:08.210> do<00:05:08.360> with<00:05:08.919> trees<00:05:09.919> at<00:05:10.430> the

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:10.550 
wasn't anything to do with trees at the

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:12.610 
wasn't anything to do with trees at the
time<00:05:10.790> it<00:05:10.970> didn't<00:05:11.150> make<00:05:11.300> me<00:05:11.390> think<00:05:11.570> oh<00:05:11.870> wow<00:05:12.229> you

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:12.620 
time it didn't make me think oh wow you

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:14.440 
time it didn't make me think oh wow you
know<00:05:12.740> what<00:05:12.979> we<00:05:13.580> should<00:05:13.610> stop<00:05:13.970> making<00:05:14.120> this

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:14.450 
know what we should stop making this

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:15.820 
know what we should stop making this
because<00:05:14.870> there's<00:05:15.169> battery<00:05:15.590> power

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:15.830 
because there's battery power

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:17.469 
because there's battery power
electricity<00:05:16.430> that<00:05:16.790> we<00:05:16.880> use<00:05:17.060> it<00:05:17.180> to<00:05:17.210> create

00:05:17.469 --> 00:05:17.479 
electricity that we use it to create

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:19.090 
electricity that we use it to create
this<00:05:17.660> channel<00:05:18.080> so<00:05:18.169> we<00:05:18.260> should<00:05:18.410> stop<00:05:18.680> and<00:05:18.890> start

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:19.100 
this channel so we should stop and start

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:21.060 
this channel so we should stop and start
planting<00:05:19.370> trees<00:05:19.760> that's<00:05:20.419> not<00:05:20.630> what<00:05:20.750> happened

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:21.070 
planting trees that's not what happened

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:23.980 
planting trees that's not what happened
instead<00:05:22.070> I<00:05:22.310> was<00:05:22.490> like<00:05:22.640> boys<00:05:23.419> going<00:05:23.720> on<00:05:23.810> in<00:05:23.900> this

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:23.990 
instead I was like boys going on in this

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:28.300 
instead I was like boys going on in this
film<00:05:24.260> so<00:05:25.130> I<00:05:25.520> I<00:05:26.419> don't<00:05:27.050> really<00:05:27.560> have<00:05:27.830> too<00:05:28.160> much

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:28.310 
film so I I don't really have too much

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:29.830 
film so I I don't really have too much
of<00:05:28.430> an<00:05:28.520> opinion<00:05:28.610> apart<00:05:29.150> from<00:05:29.330> I<00:05:29.450> need<00:05:29.630> to<00:05:29.720> know

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:29.840 
of an opinion apart from I need to know

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:30.390 
of an opinion apart from I need to know
more

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:30.400 
more

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:33.170 
more
or<00:05:30.460> I<00:05:30.520> decide<00:05:30.910> anything<00:05:31.419> about<00:05:31.810> this<00:05:31.930> movie

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:33.180 
or I decide anything about this movie

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:36.870 
or I decide anything about this movie
but<00:05:34.180> yeah<00:05:35.020> Christine<00:05:35.560> production<00:05:36.070> value<00:05:36.370> yeah

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:36.880 
but yeah Christine production value yeah

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:38.999 
but yeah Christine production value yeah
yeah<00:05:37.630> absolutely<00:05:37.990> production<00:05:38.620> value<00:05:38.860> it's

00:05:38.999 --> 00:05:39.009 
yeah absolutely production value it's

00:05:39.009 --> 00:05:42.270 
yeah absolutely production value it's
nice<00:05:39.190> it<00:05:39.400> was<00:05:39.520> a<00:05:39.580> very<00:05:40.419> simple<00:05:41.020> you<00:05:41.470> know<00:05:41.770> and<00:05:42.220> I

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:42.280 
nice it was a very simple you know and I

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:45.360 
nice it was a very simple you know and I
think<00:05:42.550> that<00:05:43.350> in<00:05:44.350> the<00:05:44.500> first<00:05:44.800> half<00:05:45.070> of<00:05:45.340> that

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:45.370 
think that in the first half of that

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:48.840 
think that in the first half of that
film<00:05:45.699> it<00:05:46.389> kind<00:05:46.690> of<00:05:47.070> kind<00:05:48.070> of<00:05:48.220> dragged<00:05:48.460> you<00:05:48.639> win

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:48.850 
film it kind of kind of dragged you win

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:51.330 
film it kind of kind of dragged you win
because<00:05:49.090> of<00:05:49.270> the<00:05:49.479> simpleness<00:05:50.440> of<00:05:50.800> the<00:05:51.130> piece

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:51.340 
because of the simpleness of the piece

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:53.430 
because of the simpleness of the piece
but<00:05:51.759> because<00:05:52.479> we<00:05:52.630> knew<00:05:52.960> that<00:05:52.990> it<00:05:53.410> had

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:53.440
