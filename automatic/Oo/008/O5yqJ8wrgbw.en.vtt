00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 good channel service I am encourages that 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.250
 for those who have 1 mega thread and today 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.189
 let's talk about a path of more than 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.800
 flowers today we are going to talk about in mont de 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.259
 late we have to be with is in 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.480
 the center square and also as 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.820
 you know is one of the most famous mountains 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.859
 for the following reason there live two 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.840
 tribes the raccord tribe and the tribe of 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.970
 solar and let's start talking about 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.010
 the tribe of raccord as you know by 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:30.510
 over the clouds on monte targo 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:32.070
 receives resides the tribe of the clusters those 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.070
 are the pantheon tribe of agreement is 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.860
 well the pantheon is not the leader but there 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.809
 is where the pantheon was born and each member of 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.239
 the tribe is raised to be a 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.129
 disciplined and brave warrior 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.140
 I love to fight against the plains 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.500
 of Martians because they are usually the 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.020
 most powerful armies 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:54.710
 the raccoon tribe not only trains 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:57.190
 to be better but also with their 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.660
 bare hands valera based on hooks 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.340
 because if they take away their weapons they want 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.560
 demonstrate that they are also capable of 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:07.090
 fight hand-to-hand 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:10.250
 also the weapons of the tacos are 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.630
 magical weapons are already the relics and 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.460
 often passed down from generation to 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.460
 generation are weapons that what they give 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.979
 as treasures 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:20.440
 currently pantheon is considered the 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:22.210
 champion of the tribe they also had 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.100
 a ritual that every member of the tribe 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.800
 raccord should participate in a rite 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:30.220
 called core and it was that a ceremony the 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:32.619
 teenagers were fighting to death for a 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:35.380
 relic weapon that was an event 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:38.320
 quite scandalous but I had a 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:41.350
 function bird scarce food eliminated 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:43.659
 to a person who was not that powerful not 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:46.509
 they need strong and stayed a hero 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:49.420
 of quotes with the relic weapon and 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:51.039
 besides sabanÃ©s food besides the child 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.580
 It was prepared from a very small 

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:56.190
 fight in this ritual 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:58.440
 in case some fighter refused 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:00.240
 to participate 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:03.060
 that participant was sentenced to death 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.220
 and if the two wanted to fight both were 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:08.700
 sentenced to death the current leader of the 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:11.270
 record tribe is hagen if I would be setting 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.830
 this will remind Spartans a bit 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:16.460
 now let's see another tribe that is 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:20.640
 next to the records that only solar and 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:23.010
 they reside there and just the tacos without 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.590
 no problem because both are for the 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.390
 allies also they are not so 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.820
 focused on combat and prefer 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:32.910
 devote his life to worship the sun because 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:36.030
 they worship the sun they have as a point 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:39.810
 strong that the sun is a 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:43.530
 god is a god who helps the solari and 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:46.200
 also many years ago before 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:48.330
 appeared from now there was a hero of 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.790
 solar and that the sun helped him 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:52.260
 fight along with his other rivals 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.790
 that is to say with his comrades they fought 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.010
 next to them and their armor and their 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.380
 equipment was illuminated and detached 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:01.020
 magical powers they also do the 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:04.470
 same ritual that banks say 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:06.959
 the children fight for special weapons and 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:09.780
 that he was not capable of winning he died 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:12.180
 I read with leone something similar happened with 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.840
 lioness what happens that she did not like 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.480
 to fight 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:18.060
 that is to say that he liked to defend and had 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.370
 that then in 1 against 1 fight between 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.650
 them what happened to lioness and now he refused 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.510
 to fight in that combat that ritual and 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.740
 when they were going to kill him it was shown that 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:29.560
 she was the chosen one 

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:32.680
 the hours that is to say lit up in the 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:35.020
 Sun and his gun were given weapons 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.180
 legendary of the former champion of the 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:38.010
 solar 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.680
 as you are seeing both tribes are 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:43.849
 similar and as you can see 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:46.170
 currently they those two tribes are still 

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:48.299
 active we have fallen they have lost us 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:50.310
 against noksel and others already and here you have 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:52.769
 Well, the history of the two tribes 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:54.719
 that live in the talgo mount as 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:57.989
 you also know I want to add that pantheon 

00:03:54.719 --> 00:03:59.819
 and lioness are friends since childhood 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:02.069
 Well, I hope you liked this one 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:03.239
 story of Mt. Talgo and I hope that 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:06.409
 enjoy them as always and many 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:06.409
