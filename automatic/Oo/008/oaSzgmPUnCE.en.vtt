 the experience in memory of the mediocre 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.300
 the center knows 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:36.890
 this located in high of big mount in the street florencio sánchez 4 60 that 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.730
 we are fully dedicated to those there we are basic and superior course and in 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.820
 this moment we are starting a cycle of special classes what we are 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:48.960
 doing in this chapter before the talks in I am 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.780
 ps percent a bid class 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.730
 p in this case we have little trees 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:57.420
 for one hundrerd 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.400
 Deciduous mickelson 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:04.510
 and others and that are perennial for those who do not know so much perennial by closing by 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:05.880
 assange what is it 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.130
 I do not know what leaves fall 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.149
 they keep them for almost the whole year and they are renewed without losing it 

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:17.560
 complete and the other deciduous are what you see that with the first 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:23.920
 cold kan their leaves and they are totally naked we in this case we are 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:29.689
 pruning from initial seedlings such as dribbling sticks screen 

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:35.079
 we sowed last year and the growth that has been 

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:39.829
 had approximately 30 to 40 centimeters and we are going to perform the 

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:45.490
 first test and we are also living plants much more important 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.789
 with some years percent 

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:50.320
 some of them that are 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:55.990
 true bonsai keb we are pruning them properly and that this work 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.320
 we must decide that we are doing it in agreement 

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:03.960
 and what more conducive 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.000
 and some will ask when is that time or if we are guided by months in the 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.680
 calendar and I always had told all the students the quiet this kind of 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.059
 work 

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:17.850
 we must perform 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:22.730
 as we are updating the meteorological service when they tell us 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.149
 frost in urban areas 

00:02:25.149 --> 00:02:28.249
 and a couple of days of less than 2 degrees 

00:02:28.249 --> 00:02:33.179
 for sure we are already i spends a week the trees now have 

00:02:33.179 --> 00:02:38.189
 almost completely stopped its growth and from the time where we can 

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:41.189
 start pruning 

00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:57.289
 we try to always do 

00:02:57.289 --> 00:03:02.210
 percent in first place in the first moments of winter 

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:03.769
 the trees that are 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:07.479
 of exploring and fruit because if not the tree grew 

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:12.039
 and makes its distribution of everything to what the soil produces 

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:14.489
 and then we can 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:15.569
 and we take it off 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:20.560
 half of those flowers and fruit per hundred when we have our own way 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:21.649
 hadad 

00:03:21.649 --> 00:03:27.239
 we can in an early form the florin fruit and leave the rest for 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:28.769
 late winter 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:30.369
 works 

00:03:30.369 --> 00:03:33.269
 to pay nothing now everywhere
