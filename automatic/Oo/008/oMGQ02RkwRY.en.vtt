00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:03.329
 stop 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:12.480
 and we're in minecraft for a reason 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:15.870
 to teach you a myth of the elderly 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.590
 minecraft bugs that minecraft if 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.680
 it has an end 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:23.160
 let's see it but the world they use is 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:23.160
 creative 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:29.730
 with tricks and create a new world worth 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:33.000
 and we will check that if it has an end 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.810
 because many people give me many forums and 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.210
 I was seeing that I did not know if 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:40.620
 infinite or not in the infinite minecraft and 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.450
 I tell you that minecraft if it is 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.980
 infinite 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:49.370
 the uncle who did this 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:54.329
 the command this I have here 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:58.829
 traveled more than 303 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:01.640
 hundreds of millions of blocks from the 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:04.699
 respawn point 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.380
 and let's see how is that let's see the 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:11.000
 myth 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:14.380
 like people that few people know not 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.369
 much is worth here we are 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.369
 and set to see 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.880
 here is the for invisible if you look 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:31.580
 This is the corner here and here 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:38.590
 if you see the sea this one is whiter than 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:38.590
 here and I notice there are no trees or anything 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.560
 there are no trees at all and here is 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:48.770
 cut trees 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:50.800
 Iraqis you see that you have darkness and 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.800
 not here 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:57.930
 and the trees are cut and it's a 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.930
 myth one of the myths 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:04.910
 better known good less known of 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:08.540
 minecraft because people do not search if 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:10.730
 has minecraft fine but I'm interested 

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:13.010
 why and I say well it has an end and I found 

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:15.860
 this command here that managed to leave in 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:18.020
 the description of the video 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:23.140
 and the truth is that I was impressed 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:23.140
 quite minecraft if it has an end 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.860
 my mother 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:34.260
 and also does not respond to pig cows 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:37.080
 neither mods carbon missile cyber 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:41.240
 hather the sheep do not let him pass 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:44.450
 then minecraft if it has an end 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:47.780
 this this line here that does not let you 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:52.580
 happen they fixed it in version 1.4 or 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:55.100
 1.2 to 1.5 if it could perfectly 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:58.280
 pass and see it tunjo is a mine is that 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:02.350
 there was and under the sea it was as if 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.350
 you were as if there were no sea 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:07.430
 here 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.510
 but because here we are on this side yes 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:11.590
 do not 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.590
 and the truth is that 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:16.620
 by his side 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:19.200
 then we can say that minecraft yes 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:21.420
 it has an end so many have said 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.250
 friends that minecraft is always 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:25.350
 always generates that always 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.420
 way is right thousands x is generated 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:30.240
 but there came a time that minecraft there 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:33.330
 have to limit all the poles of 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:35.830
 limit have no limits 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:38.290
 I do not know what 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:40.180
 happen 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.950
 but well this has been everything is for 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:45.160
 know in what way if they have limits 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:48.790
 will leave them in the description of the video 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:50.910
 and well this has been all I hope that you 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:50.910
 I liked it 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:55.790
 pass it on to your friends 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:59.350
 for it to be done 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:01.780
 we go to this information because 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:06.310
 a friend that is from minecraft or something like that 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:10.050
 and I also want to say that that is called 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:12.780
 like the distant lands of minecraft 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:15.660
 there are very few videos that say the limit 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:17.340
 of minecraft if you notice this is the 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:19.019
 third or fourth video that seen in 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:23.420
 Youtube 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:26.889
 says the distant lands of 

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:29.520
 of this game of minecraft 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:32.470
 and if we look the snow does not fall either 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:34.270
 there are only the blocks there 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:36.720
 and if it were not there, we could 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:41.000
 to transfer the 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:44.270
 the walls and all that then 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.460
 These minecraft guarantees and main cause and 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:48.550
 has limits schemas in like me 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:48.550
 liked 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:53.730
 good favorites and even others 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.730
 kids
