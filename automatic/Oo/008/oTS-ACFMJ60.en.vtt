00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
been coming out of brain research which

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.650 
been coming out of brain research which
is<00:01:16.440> all<00:01:16.680> fascinating<00:01:17.130> but<00:01:17.730> what<00:01:18.300> we<00:01:18.390> want<00:01:18.420> to

but<00:01:48.000> we<00:01:48.240> had<00:01:48.420> places<00:01:48.720> for<00:01:49.080> them<00:01:49.200> in<00:01:49.410> the<00:01:49.680> 1970s

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
but we had places for them in the 1970s

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.700 
but we had places for them in the 1970s
all<00:01:50.670> that<00:01:50.850> changed<00:01:51.450> suddenly<00:01:51.960> America

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
all that changed suddenly America

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.160 
all that changed suddenly America
decided<00:01:53.040> we<00:01:53.910> wanted<00:01:54.180> to<00:01:54.240> educate<00:01:54.330> everybody

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170
