00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:14.099
 the girl here is a new cooking video 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.599
 in this video I will show you how to do it 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.600
 these balls that are completely 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.460
 vegans and vegetarians are not 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.619
 too complicated to do really 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.720
 very simple fast and it is a sweet that 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.510
 I do very often especially for 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.599
 even the hawk will need the action 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.189
 almonds the dates and prunes these 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.860
 three are the three main ingredients 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.350
 then we will use bitter cocoa for 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.510
 precisely the outside with choose 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.610
 if you use coconut instead we will use the 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.920
 classic vats to position the 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.110
 all first thing we take anyway 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.230
 our dates we will use more or less 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.969
 The quantities are not fixed at 180 grams 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.980
 One moment you go watch 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.949
 then we put them in warm water 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.620
 to make them slightly softer and 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.180
 we should be in the water at least 10 minutes 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.100
 in the meantime we take the others anyway 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.670
 ingredients what we do we take the 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.920
 our almonds use and those already 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:10.049
 also revealed 180 grams in this case 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.140
 and we put them in our blender which 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:15.650
 meanwhile we have opened positioned of 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.650
 next to us 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.100
 we take ours 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.920
 and also in this case 180 grams this 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.630
 I had taken the recipe from a network 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.369
 girl that I follow very often 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.950
 I put down here in the information box 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:30.759
 of his facebook page and from there not me 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.500
 I am more 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:33.729
 I didn't do it more or less then 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.649
 I make many times with chocolate 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:37.960
 so many times with coconut 

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:39.399
 in short, it changes very often once 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.450
 that our English are ready i 

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:42.130
 our ten minutes have passed 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.110
 let's note all the ingredients 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.820
 in our mixer blender in short 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.770
 what you have we put it 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:49.930
 on the use the change obviously I have the 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.990
 my cookies firm lover that I use 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:55.090
 we always blend critare 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.830
 let's say all sorry don't whisk 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.659
 chop all the contents 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:01.690
 it will take a while because of it 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:03.600
 however you won't be able to blend well 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:05.229
 so I advise you to stop 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.390
 position to move a little 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:08.560
 elements then turn it back on do a 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.140
 step 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.400
 I make a variation in the recipe 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:15.640
 or what you are seeing add 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:18.100
 of water to make it more a species 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.840
 of mush is easier to create 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.580
 our balls what you have to do 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.290
 let's take a glass take the 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.390
 bitter cocoa I take this glass 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.180
 the larger the less will be then even more 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.950
 easy to create balls and put inside 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.930
 precisely the bitter chocolate after which 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.180
 takes our compound and creates precisely 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.100
 some balls then to make a nice one 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.870
 job you have to take the balls with 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:40.209
 the hand just create a nice ball 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.820
 placed in the chocolate to turn it well 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:45.130
 what less all all sides of the 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:46.959
 ball are covered by chocolate 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:48.430
 I also show you the other example 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:50.200
 for those who don't really want to create 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.720
 precisely these balls to take one 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:56.320
 portion of product m directly in the 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:58.150
 chocolate turn precisely the like been 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:00.010
 living images now and not you are 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.670
 created a ball but still can go 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.019
 well 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.420
 we say that it is better to create the balls 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:06.130
 to do a really well done job e 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.989
 now we find all of them with compound 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:10.840
 balls that will come out but come out anyway 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:12.489
 two trays if you want less than enough 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.260
 reduce, however, of course 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:16.150
 ingredients if they fear and if you want 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.340
 the more you increase the more you know the three 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.440
 ingredients go hand in hand with the 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.480
 same amount once all finished 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.370
 we need to put the balls in the fridge 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.870
 I'm usually the m in the fridge too 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.780
 put it in the freezer if you have any 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.910
 immediate need I put them in the fridge 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:33.220
 fridge at least half an hour after half an hour 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:35.350
 they can also be eaten anyway 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.790
 now I'll show you the picture 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:39.100
 some fridge balls 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:41.980
 I eat them anyway us celino 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:43.569
 alone I do the evening the next day for 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:44.250
 two or three days however it lasts but these 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:47.200
 balls 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:49.390
 let me know if this recipe will go 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.920
 to reproduce it let me know if you 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:52.420
 in short like let me know the 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.430
 your opinion on this mine 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:57.569
 recipe experiment a large piece 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.569
 all the next video bye
