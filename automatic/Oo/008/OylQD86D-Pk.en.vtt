00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 people it's sir call of duty 7 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.460
 for a video so today saw a 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.230
 little video for how to make a 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.080
 nice car in minecraft 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:13.860
 so it's a super sense tutorial and especially 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.750
 great so that's it then it's gone 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.770
 you need a ride and cat 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.770
 here to begin 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.030
 so a bourge here 

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:25.510
 finally paul that cuttings and in sticky 

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:25.510
 desired 

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.800
 that's not the way 

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:29.800
 to eat 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:35.540
 this here 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.940
 so it looks more like a motorcycle 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:41.050
 like that after sarah totally changed 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.050
 so forget to take something 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.930
 aulas 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.170
 for red ferrari 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.530
 we'll be crisscrossing here 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.200
 right here 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.230
 sai 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.530
 6 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.230
 hop there 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:04.180
 but that here it's a little tuning already 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.580
 it's really a little better back after 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:09.810
 to make a little more stylish ensures 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:09.810
 add windows 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.930
 to add windows often have 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:15.930
 added 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.560
 dish 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.560
 bare 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.509
 cloud 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.630
 here after to make the plate 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.630
 registration 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.580
 so here for example we put 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:53.310
 ok that my father is there we are caught 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:58.160
 a bonus manhole at the price come back 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.160
 togo powder at yes 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:10.820
 as for me, I do not have a lot of apa 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.930
 after also a crap show 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:13.930
 usually those very 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:25.040
 no I'm not kidding 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:29.540
 I laugh I laugh it's humor 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:32.330
 can nothing put to cynicism after that is 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.940
 what else is good after 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.890
 we can improve the car neither 28 nor 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.150
 everything but for now it's good 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.180
 it gives a pretty nice car 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:44.090
 especially we can get in and 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:46.580
 when we're in it gives that it gives 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.060
 really really to a real child in 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.920
 the car 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.630
 so here I hope that this little 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.060
