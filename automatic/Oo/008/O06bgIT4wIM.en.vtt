00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:06.020
 hello I'm towers and today I come with a 

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:13.100
 with a sample of an android game 

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:16.039
 who is called master bartender 

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:20.599
 and the very funny taste truth 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:23.149
 but in this tutorial if I come to you 

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:24.349
 teaching how to get all together 

00:00:23.149 --> 00:00:26.679
 the wines that we have that is what 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:26.679
 trees 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.060
 champagne 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.110
 a little 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.030
 then 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.170
 this 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:45.590
 it's more than half 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:49.300
 finally we address this 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:49.300
 that would be blue 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:55.680
 I'm full 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.680
 we stir 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:00.280
 we arrive efe 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.180
 any 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:21.909
 to our clinic but good is that this 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.909
 application 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:28.610
 It is not 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:31.110
 so hard so let's say but but 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:35.530
 there are times where they do not get stuck 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:37.740
 games need help and I come to that 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:41.229
 these three new ones that just came out 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:43.560
 they will give us the ticket to unlock 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:47.509
 those other three 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.509
 so we will use this 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.320
 a little bit what I do not know 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.810
 it's more than half 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.740
 which 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.740
 and finally 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.859
 we are making progress 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.430
 and 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.920
 or not 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:04.330
 came out those three others we saved this 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:07.050
 and it would be a little 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.050
 this 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.010
 I am 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.439
 ah 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.000
 have to like yes or yes 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:48.250
 for he loved it 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:48.250
 I'm on time 

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:55.490
 the miraculous drink by profession 

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:57.770
 i 

00:03:55.490 --> 00:04:00.730
 and then 

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:00.730
 I have to say 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:07.370
 came out these other three we run 

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:09.520
 - 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:12.510
 bit 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:12.510
 this other 

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:45.400
 Well let's wait and see if you like it 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:55.760
 until now I have all carried 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:55.760
 lived means or more 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:10.860
 until he knows it like that they would not have to 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:13.439
 to be battling came out is the one 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:16.469
 this means the vodka and it is the last and 

00:05:13.439 --> 00:05:20.720
 it's up, I've done it here 

00:05:16.469 --> 00:05:22.970
 there but the truth is that 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:25.120
 I always get the rocker so this 

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:25.120
 time 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:28.650
 I love in this way 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:35.330

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:41.130
 we see the new method 

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:59.270

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:31.190
 liked comment on what other mode of 

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:34.010
 android this they want it to go up because the 

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:35.960
 truth is that I do not have any more ideas 

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:38.600
 that other games exist one and another very 

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:41.080
 investigate but if you want a special 

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:44.110
 I do it 

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:47.110
 well so far I'll leave it we have 

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:50.310
 all wines and well with these is the same if 

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:50.310

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:03.950

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:03.950
 end the tutorial 

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:11.310
 in fact I wanted to do it very long 

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:11.310
 but 

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:15.210
 it is in fact him 

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:20.740
 depends on 

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:22.210
 well this is what happens is that this 

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:24.150
 boy has taken a good time to take the 

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:30.380
 drink 

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:30.380
 I do not want to be short either but 

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:46.880
 as I said as enter and lift 

00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:46.880
