00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
fiber and omega-3 fatty acids and what

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.289 
fiber and omega-3 fatty acids and what
they<00:01:55.590> do<00:01:55.649> is<00:01:55.890> they<00:01:56.009> put<00:01:56.250> it<00:01:56.369> in<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:57.000> juice

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
they do is they put it in the juice

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.690 
they do is they put it in the juice
because<00:01:57.960> juice<00:01:58.380> spikes<00:01:59.009> your<00:01:59.219> blood<00:01:59.460> sugar

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
because juice spikes your blood sugar

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.249 
because juice spikes your blood sugar
you<00:01:59.880> get<00:01:59.969> a<00:02:00.030> spike<00:02:00.299> and<00:02:00.570> then<00:02:00.840> you<00:02:00.960> get<00:02:01.079> tired

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
you get a spike and then you get tired

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.499 
you get a spike and then you get tired
right<00:02:01.649> so<00:02:01.979> if<00:02:02.100> you<00:02:02.219> add<00:02:02.399> the<00:02:02.640> fiber<00:02:02.909> to<00:02:03.240> it<00:02:03.270> it

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
right so if you add the fiber to it it

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.450 
right so if you add the fiber to it it
will<00:02:03.630> slow<00:02:03.990> the<00:02:04.320> release<00:02:04.469> of<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:05.009> juice<00:02:05.250> and

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
will slow the release of the juice and

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.910 
will slow the release of the juice and
you

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
sugar because I was like I came early

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:21.900

and<00:03:20.380> I<00:03:20.440> found<00:03:20.739> some<00:03:21.070> and<00:03:21.340> like<00:03:21.430> the<00:03:21.579> second

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
and I found some and like the second

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:23.490 
and I found some and like the second
ingredient<00:03:22.060> type<00:03:22.450> of<00:03:22.660> just<00:03:22.840> corn<00:03:23.079> syrup<00:03:23.350> or
