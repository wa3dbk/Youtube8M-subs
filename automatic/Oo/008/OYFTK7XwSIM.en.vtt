technique<00:00:18.720> for<00:00:18.960> making<00:00:19.170> lines<00:00:19.740> a<00:00:20.100> lot<00:00:20.340> thinner

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
technique for making lines a lot thinner

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.880 
technique for making lines a lot thinner
or<00:00:21.029> a<00:00:21.060> lot<00:00:21.359> thicker<00:00:21.689> and<00:00:21.840> this<00:00:22.170> is<00:00:22.320> handy<00:00:22.859> for

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
or a lot thicker and this is handy for

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.640 
or a lot thicker and this is handy for
images<00:00:23.880> where<00:00:24.119> you've<00:00:24.359> actually<00:00:24.990> converted

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
images where you've actually converted

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.679 
images where you've actually converted
it<00:00:25.769> to<00:00:25.949> line<00:00:26.189> up<00:00:26.430> or<00:00:26.699> where<00:00:26.910> you've<00:00:27.090> got<00:00:27.359> line

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
it to line up or where you've got line

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.089 
it to line up or where you've got line
art<00:00:27.930> like<00:00:28.199> this<00:00:28.470> that<00:00:28.740> we've<00:00:28.890> actually

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
art like this that we've actually

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.600 
art like this that we've actually
scanned<00:00:29.730> in<00:00:30.199> to<00:00:31.199> make<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:31.890> lines<00:00:32.130> thicker

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
scanned in to make the lines thicker

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.450 
scanned in to make the lines thicker
choose<00:00:33.030> filter<00:00:33.570> and<00:00:33.809> then<00:00:34.110> other<00:00:34.440> and<00:00:34.800> then

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
choose filter and then other and then

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.360 
choose filter and then other and then
minimum<00:00:36.120> and<00:00:36.450> with<00:00:37.170> minimum<00:00:37.739> you<00:00:37.920> can<00:00:37.950> then

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
minimum and with minimum you can then

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.360 
minimum and with minimum you can then
select<00:00:38.730> the<00:00:39.300> minimum<00:00:40.170> radius<00:00:40.410> which<00:00:40.950> is<00:00:41.129> going

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
select the minimum radius which is going

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.850 
select the minimum radius which is going
to<00:00:41.489> make<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:42.090> image<00:00:42.510> lines<00:00:42.899> a<00:00:43.200> lot<00:00:43.469> thicker

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
to make the image lines a lot thicker

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.310 
to make the image lines a lot thicker
and<00:00:44.250> you<00:00:44.700> can<00:00:44.879> test<00:00:45.210> these<00:00:45.450> out<00:00:45.660> generally

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
and you can test these out generally

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.470 
and you can test these out generally
just<00:00:46.530> one<00:00:46.829> or<00:00:46.980> two<00:00:47.010> pixels<00:00:47.670> is<00:00:47.850> like<00:00:48.059> all<00:00:48.420> you

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
just one or two pixels is like all you

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.569 
just one or two pixels is like all you
need<00:00:49.110> to<00:00:49.379> do<00:00:49.590> and<00:00:49.920> this<00:00:50.070> is<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.399> original

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
need to do and this is the original

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.330 
need to do and this is the original
image<00:00:51.180> and<00:00:51.539> this<00:00:51.629> is<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.379> thicker<00:00:52.980> lined

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
image and this is the thicker lined

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.729 
image and this is the thicker lined
image<00:00:53.910> so<00:00:54.180> let's<00:00:54.390> perhaps<00:00:54.960> take<00:00:55.230> this<00:00:55.379> up<00:00:55.590> to

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
image so let's perhaps take this up to

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.819 
image so let's perhaps take this up to
four<00:00:56.010> and<00:00:56.280> I'll<00:00:56.969> click<00:00:57.149> OK<00:00:57.629> and<00:00:57.960> that<00:00:58.590> has<00:00:58.800> just

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
four and I'll click OK and that has just

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.619 
four and I'll click OK and that has just
thickened<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.460> line<00:00:59.699> so<00:01:00.030> if<00:01:00.180> that<00:01:00.329> were<00:01:00.449> all

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
thickened the line so if that were all

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.360 
thickened the line so if that were all
we<00:01:00.809> wanted<00:01:01.079> to<00:01:01.140> do<00:01:01.379> we<00:01:01.530> could<00:01:01.680> just<00:01:01.859> save<00:01:02.100> this

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
we wanted to do we could just save this

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.670 
we wanted to do we could just save this
and<00:01:02.579> be<00:01:02.850> off<00:01:03.120> but<00:01:03.600> let's<00:01:03.780> have<00:01:03.989> a<00:01:04.019> look<00:01:04.260> and<00:01:04.439> see

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
and be off but let's have a look and see

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.039 
and be off but let's have a look and see
how<00:01:04.890> we<00:01:04.920> can<00:01:05.280> make<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:06.000> lines<00:01:06.210> thinner<00:01:06.689> I'm

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
how we can make the lines thinner I'm

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.890 
how we can make the lines thinner I'm
going<00:01:07.409> to<00:01:07.590> filter<00:01:08.130> this<00:01:08.310> time<00:01:08.369> other<00:01:08.880> and<00:01:09.330> this

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
going to filter this time other and this

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.100 
going to filter this time other and this
time<00:01:10.200> and<00:01:10.500> we're<00:01:10.710> looking<00:01:10.740> at<00:01:11.100> maximum<00:01:11.850> and

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
time and we're looking at maximum and

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.710 
time and we're looking at maximum and
we're<00:01:13.110> just<00:01:13.260> going<00:01:13.530> to<00:01:13.650> set<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.369> maximum<00:01:14.790> line

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
we're just going to set the maximum line

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.120 
we're just going to set the maximum line
width<00:01:16.110> and<00:01:16.920> so<00:01:17.850> we<00:01:18.000> want<00:01:18.180> this<00:01:18.360> down<00:01:18.659> to

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
width and so we want this down to

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.560 
width and so we want this down to
something<00:01:20.130> that<00:01:20.490> gives<00:01:20.700> us<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:21.030> lines<00:01:21.270> that

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
something that gives us the lines that

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.780 
something that gives us the lines that
we're<00:01:21.780> looking<00:01:21.990> for<00:01:22.470> so<00:01:22.740> here<00:01:23.040> I<00:01:23.250> have<00:01:23.280> it<00:01:23.549> set

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
we're looking for so here I have it set

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.030 
we're looking for so here I have it set
to<00:01:23.820> 5<00:01:24.210> this<00:01:24.509> is<00:01:24.689> what<00:01:24.840> it<00:01:24.960> was<00:01:25.140> this<00:01:25.530> is<00:01:25.740> what<00:01:25.920> it

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
to 5 this is what it was this is what it

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.060 
to 5 this is what it was this is what it
is<00:01:26.220> now<00:01:26.520> if<00:01:27.240> I<00:01:27.420> go<00:01:27.659> a<00:01:27.689> bit<00:01:27.780> smaller<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.740> lines

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
is now if I go a bit smaller the lines

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.130 
is now if I go a bit smaller the lines
are<00:01:29.340> going<00:01:29.490> to<00:01:29.610> get<00:01:29.759> thicker<00:01:30.090> if<00:01:30.360> I<00:01:30.509> get<00:01:30.780> bigger

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
are going to get thicker if I get bigger

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.350 
are going to get thicker if I get bigger
the<00:01:31.860> lines<00:01:32.100> are<00:01:32.340> going<00:01:32.490> to<00:01:32.579> get<00:01:32.759> thinner<00:01:33.090> to

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
the lines are going to get thinner to

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.569 
the lines are going to get thinner to
the<00:01:33.479> extent<00:01:33.990> where<00:01:34.259> they<00:01:34.530> actually<00:01:34.799> totally

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
the extent where they actually totally

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.880 
the extent where they actually totally
disappear<00:01:36.150> so<00:01:36.360> you<00:01:36.450> need<00:01:36.630> to<00:01:36.780> find<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.650> sweet

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
disappear so you need to find the sweet

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.120 
disappear so you need to find the sweet
spot<00:01:38.070> here<00:01:39.000> for<00:01:39.270> your<00:01:39.450> particular<00:01:39.810> image<00:01:40.500> but

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
spot here for your particular image but

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.639 
spot here for your particular image but
if<00:01:41.250> you<00:01:41.340> do<00:01:41.520> want<00:01:41.790> to<00:01:41.909> make<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:42.960> lines<00:01:43.200> that

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
if you do want to make the lines that

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.679 
if you do want to make the lines that
are<00:01:43.799> fairly<00:01:44.399> thick<00:01:44.670> right<00:01:44.939> now<00:01:44.970> to<00:01:45.240> be<00:01:45.659> a

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
are fairly thick right now to be a

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.170 
are fairly thick right now to be a
little<00:01:46.110> bit<00:01:46.259> finer<00:01:46.619> then<00:01:47.250> you<00:01:47.520> can<00:01:47.759> do<00:01:47.970> that

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
little bit finer then you can do that
