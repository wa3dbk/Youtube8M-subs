00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:41.360 
so this is the towel and we spread it
spread<00:03:34.970> it<00:03:35.970> on<00:03:36.120> a<00:03:36.950> hydrator<00:03:37.950> sheet<00:03:39.980> and<00:03:40.980> then

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
spread it on a hydrator sheet and then

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.309 
spread it on a hydrator sheet and then
you<00:03:41.580> decide<00:03:42.000> what<00:03:42.209> kind<00:03:42.390> of<00:03:42.510> shapes<00:03:42.840> who<00:03:43.080> want

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:43.319 
you decide what kind of shapes who want

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:48.559 
you decide what kind of shapes who want
I<00:03:45.650> know<00:03:46.650> it's<00:03:46.950> not<00:03:47.129> orange<00:03:47.430> yet<00:03:47.760> but<00:03:48.030> I<00:03:48.060> still

00:03:48.559 --> 00:03:48.569 
I know it's not orange yet but I still

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:57.850

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:57.860 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:00.259

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269 
so spread it out about a fourth inch

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:02.900 
so spread it out about a fourth inch
thick<00:04:00.629> and<00:04:00.900> don't<00:04:01.890> leave<00:04:02.010> any<00:04:02.190> holes<00:04:02.519> in<00:04:02.760> it
