00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.759
 rb leipzig rehearses the bundesliga in the test 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.770
 against Werder Bremen for the lawn baller 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:08.760
 it's the fifth game against one 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.130
 first division 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.860
 In the process, they succeed in the second victory 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:20.100
 a 2 1 for the bremen remains 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:21.930
 the next test match defeat to 2 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.670
 ahead and you have to stop then 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.769
 also show and then we have only 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.900
 quite a few situations shows despite 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.580
 a bull's heat finds the third league 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.710
 newcomer fast in the lot 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.920
 especially by the active striker 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.660
 daniel frahn you have to be 12 minute 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.860
 also the guests from the north bach 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.750
 show offensive urge and first counter 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.879
 Bremen striker Josef Ackerl fails 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.649
 still at the pale cross 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:47.910
 then Niclas FÃ¼llkrug arrives 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.190
 1 0 leadership 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:54.030
 instead of rejoicing but criticized 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:56.489
 the game system 433 we complete 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.899
 new system imprinted at bremen 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.039
 our team and we try 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.420
 of course as soon as possible though 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.090
 i think that will be a process that you 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.820
 that was the whole year 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.650
 in the further course rb 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.150
 with the four-time German champion 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.580
 a thrilling duel 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.890
 but the bremen are often missing the 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.500
 Ideas who comes there very often about the 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:19.740
 left side tries it with flanks but 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.780
 niklas hoheneder explains in return 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:25.170
 makes that leipzig's timo rÃ¶ttger better 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.250
 after a single action network of the 1 1 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.979
 balancing a 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.759
 remes with a preparation you may 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.490
 are not result now either 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.170
 Of course, you prefer to overestimate 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.600
 it still won two three gates 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.939
 could do more that was it 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.340
 I really liked it at the beginning 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.299
 in the second half, rb has many 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.430
 new players 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:47.009
 but one who can prove himself further 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.890
 is carsten kammlott the striker meets 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:52.380
 against werder to the 2 1 endstand at 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:57.329
 league start and hall he had missed 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:58.590
 Of course, it was important that I think 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:01.320
 against bundesliga 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.520
 put on it and as a striker 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.039
 Of course always good to meet 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.740
 rb creates confidence with the victory 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:09.110
 for the first third league home game against 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.879
 the table leader and 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:15.269
 ascent from the prussian city of 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:18.150
 Saturday we expect the 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:21.870
 best team and we have to 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.799
 Give everything and show that we are that 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.209
 not only friendly games against 

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:26.209
 to win the Bundesliga
