hey guys welcome back this is John wind
from<00:00:03.570> a<00:00:03.750> meteorology<00:00:04.290> class<00:00:04.819> last<00:00:05.819> time<00:00:06.029> we

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.150 
from a meteorology class last time we

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:07.880 
from a meteorology class last time we
learned<00:00:06.330> about<00:00:06.480> what<00:00:06.779> monoclonal<00:00:07.259> antibodies

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
learned about what monoclonal antibodies

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.530 
learned about what monoclonal antibodies
are<00:00:08.130> and<00:00:08.400> how<00:00:08.610> they<00:00:08.849> play<00:00:09.030> an<00:00:09.090> important<00:00:09.510> role

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
are and how they play an important role

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.740 
are and how they play an important role
in<00:00:09.690> medicine<00:00:10.200> in<00:00:10.410> this<00:00:11.219> video<00:00:11.580> I<00:00:11.880> think<00:00:12.059> we

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
in medicine in this video I think we

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.509 
in medicine in this video I think we
should<00:00:12.929> take<00:00:13.019> a<00:00:13.080> look<00:00:13.290> at<00:00:13.500> how<00:00:13.799> monoclonal

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
should take a look at how monoclonal

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.210 
should take a look at how monoclonal

alright<00:00:49.590> so<00:00:49.739> let's<00:00:49.920> begin<00:00:51.680> first<00:00:52.680> we<00:00:52.860> need<00:00:53.010> to

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
alright so let's begin first we need to

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.369 
alright so let's begin first we need to
immunize<00:00:53.489> an<00:00:53.760> ml<00:00:54.000> model<00:00:54.300> such<00:00:54.690> as<00:00:54.840> a<00:00:54.870> mouse<00:00:55.079> or

now<00:01:09.119> one<00:01:09.360> thing<00:01:09.479> I<00:01:09.600> would<00:01:09.750> like<00:01:09.869> to<00:01:09.930> mention<00:01:10.170> is

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
now one thing I would like to mention is

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.530 
now one thing I would like to mention is
that<00:01:10.619> these<00:01:10.950> antigens<00:01:11.400> are<00:01:11.580> usually<00:01:11.970> attached

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
that these antigens are usually attached

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.510 
that these antigens are usually attached
to<00:01:12.869> adjuvant<00:01:13.470> so<00:01:14.130> as<00:01:14.250> to<00:01:14.400> reduce

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
to adjuvant so as to reduce

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.719 
to adjuvant so as to reduce
immunogenicity<00:01:15.270> of<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:15.840> antigen<00:01:16.729> adjuvant

function to protect the antigen by

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.469 
function to protect the antigen by
prolonging<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.829> immune<00:01:38.040> response<00:01:38.329> they<00:01:39.329> can

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
prolonging the immune response they can

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.330 
prolonging the immune response they can
also<00:01:39.630> enhance<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.680> immune<00:01:40.860> response<00:01:40.890> by

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
also enhance the immune response by

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.490 
also enhance the immune response by
stimulating<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:41.820> release<00:01:41.909> of<00:01:42.299> cytokines<00:01:42.780> an

that are producing antibodies then we

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:38.940

expand our cell line or we need to grow
our<00:04:59.229> hybridomas<00:05:00.160> and<00:05:00.430> we<00:05:00.490> can<00:05:00.639> do<00:05:00.729> this<00:05:00.820> in<00:05:01.000> one

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:01.030

of<00:05:01.300> two<00:05:01.450> ways<00:05:01.590> we<00:05:02.590> can<00:05:02.710> do<00:05:02.830> this<00:05:02.950> in<00:05:03.130> vivo<00:05:03.520> by

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:03.970 
of two ways we can do this in vivo by

interesting to note is that hybridoma
growth<00:05:18.520> in<00:05:18.850> mice<00:05:19.270> will<00:05:19.570> tend<00:05:19.960> to<00:05:20.110> yield<00:05:20.290> other
