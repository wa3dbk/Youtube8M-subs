what<00:00:03.170> is<00:00:03.320> cell<00:00:03.530> cycle<00:00:03.950> let<00:00:04.819> us<00:00:04.940> define<00:00:05.330> a

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:05.630 
what is cell cycle let us define a

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:08.320 
what is cell cycle let us define a
series<00:00:06.529> of<00:00:06.860> events<00:00:07.250> in<00:00:07.580> the<00:00:07.850> growth<00:00:08.090> and

eukaryotic<00:00:11.210> cell<00:00:11.420> is<00:00:11.870> called<00:00:12.440> a<00:00:12.650> cell<00:00:13.010> cycle

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:13.480 
eukaryotic cell is called a cell cycle

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.060 
eukaryotic cell is called a cell cycle
here<00:00:14.480> we'll<00:00:14.840> try<00:00:15.110> to<00:00:15.170> understand<00:00:15.740> the<00:00:15.860> events

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:16.070 
here we'll try to understand the events

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.179 
here we'll try to understand the events
that<00:00:16.670> occur<00:00:17.060> in<00:00:17.180> a<00:00:17.270> cell<00:00:17.689> cycle<00:00:17.930> the<00:00:18.380> cell

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:19.189 
that occur in a cell cycle the cell

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:21.490 
that occur in a cell cycle the cell
cycle<00:00:19.669> is<00:00:19.790> divided<00:00:20.300> into<00:00:20.540> two<00:00:20.779> basic<00:00:21.320> phases

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:21.500 
cycle is divided into two basic phases

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.389 
cycle is divided into two basic phases
and<00:00:21.919> what<00:00:22.640> are<00:00:22.759> those<00:00:23.410> interphase<00:00:24.410> and<00:00:24.680> M

00:00:25.389 --> 00:00:25.399 
and what are those interphase and M

00:00:25.399 --> 00:00:28.210 
and what are those interphase and M
phase<00:00:26.169> during<00:00:27.169> interphase<00:00:27.649> the<00:00:27.890> cell

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:28.220 
phase during interphase the cell

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.639 
phase during interphase the cell
prepares<00:00:28.880> itself<00:00:29.689> for<00:00:29.809> the<00:00:30.020> division

00:00:30.639 --> 00:00:30.649 
prepares itself for the division

00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:33.010 
prepares itself for the division
can<00:00:31.430> you<00:00:31.550> guess<00:00:31.790> what<00:00:32.090> does<00:00:32.300> this<00:00:32.480> preparation

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:33.020 
can you guess what does this preparation

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.400 
can you guess what does this preparation
mean<00:00:33.410> this<00:00:34.370> means<00:00:34.670> that<00:00:34.910> the<00:00:35.059> cell<00:00:35.359> is<00:00:35.600> engaged

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:36.410 
mean this means that the cell is engaged

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.669 
mean this means that the cell is engaged
in<00:00:36.590> growth<00:00:36.890> and<00:00:37.280> metabolic<00:00:37.820> activities<00:00:38.679> this

00:00:39.669 --> 00:00:39.679 
in growth and metabolic activities this

00:00:39.679 --> 00:00:41.619 
in growth and metabolic activities this
phase<00:00:39.980> is<00:00:40.250> further<00:00:40.670> divided<00:00:41.149> into<00:00:41.239> three

00:00:41.619 --> 00:00:41.629

00:00:54.939 --> 00:00:54.949 
phase or gap 2 phase now let us look at

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:57.880 
phase or gap 2 phase now let us look at
these<00:00:55.100> phases<00:00:55.609> one<00:00:55.879> by<00:00:56.089> one<00:00:56.329> during<00:00:57.199> g1<00:00:57.589> phase

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:57.890 
these phases one by one during g1 phase

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.340 
these phases one by one during g1 phase
the<00:00:58.609> cell<00:00:58.850> is<00:00:58.969> metabolically<00:00:59.539> active<00:00:59.780> and

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.350 
the cell is metabolically active and

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.299 
the cell is metabolically active and
grows<00:01:00.980> in<00:01:01.190> size<00:01:01.429> you<00:01:02.420> see<00:01:02.629> that<00:01:03.070> during<00:01:04.070> his

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:04.309 
grows in size you see that during his

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:06.609 
grows in size you see that during his
face<00:01:04.610> the<00:01:04.879> replication<00:01:05.570> or<00:01:05.720> the<00:01:05.990> synthesis<00:01:06.590> of

face the replication or the synthesis of
DNA<00:01:07.070> takes<00:01:07.310> place<00:01:07.720> now<00:01:08.720> one<00:01:09.020> thing<00:01:09.259> should<00:01:09.439> be

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500 
DNA takes place now one thing should be

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.149 
DNA takes place now one thing should be
clear<00:01:09.890> to<00:01:10.100> you<00:01:10.360> in<00:01:11.360> this<00:01:11.600> phase<00:01:11.899> that<00:01:12.500> means<00:01:12.530> in

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:13.159 
clear to you in this phase that means in

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:16.120 
clear to you in this phase that means in
synthesis<00:01:13.790> phase<00:01:14.000> only<00:01:14.869> the<00:01:15.229> amount<00:01:15.649> of<00:01:15.829> DNA

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
synthesis phase only the amount of DNA

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.700 
synthesis phase only the amount of DNA
doubles<00:01:16.719> but<00:01:17.719> the<00:01:17.780> number<00:01:18.079> of<00:01:18.200> chromosomes

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 
doubles but the number of chromosomes

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.999 
doubles but the number of chromosomes
remains<00:01:19.579> the<00:01:19.850> same<00:01:20.200> take<00:01:21.200> note<00:01:21.439> of<00:01:21.469> this<00:01:21.770> this

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:22.009 
remains the same take note of this this

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:24.819 
remains the same take note of this this
is<00:01:22.130> very<00:01:22.340> important<00:01:22.899> this<00:01:23.899> S<00:01:24.170> phase<00:01:24.469> is

00:01:24.819 --> 00:01:24.829 
is very important this S phase is

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:28.389 
is very important this S phase is
followed<00:01:25.369> by<00:01:25.549> a<00:01:25.579> g2<00:01:26.119> phase<00:01:26.740> during<00:01:27.740> g2<00:01:28.159> phase

followed by a g2 phase during g2 phase
the<00:01:29.119> protein<00:01:29.540> synthesis<00:01:30.110> occurs<00:01:30.259> and<00:01:30.950> the

see<00:02:14.990> in<00:02:15.080> the<00:02:15.200> picture

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
see in the picture

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.140

now<00:02:16.320> these<00:02:16.590> sales<00:02:16.980> further<00:02:17.370> enter<00:02:17.820> the<00:02:17.940> cell

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
now these sales further enter the cell

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.620 
now these sales further enter the cell
cycle<00:02:18.630> and<00:02:18.750> this<00:02:19.850> causes<00:02:20.850> an<00:02:20.970> increase<00:02:21.330> in<00:02:21.360> the
