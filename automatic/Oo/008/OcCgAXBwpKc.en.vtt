00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:10.620
 It's a lovingly long length I cut my hair a little 

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:14.160
 It was rejuvenated when I shortened the house a little while ago, but I'm getting old at a stretch recently 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:17.220
 I feel the hate that parting even Somehow thinner 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:20.650
 So this machine is this time 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:26.770
 Do not enter at all in succession last time off the track 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:32.050
 The there was Todorokikaminari I'm a machine with a 9 mm bearing roller, but I changed the time being 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:35.230
 Put the stay in the middle, but it 's like coming to the middle of the shaft 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:40.640
 I tried it , and everyone's comment 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:47.570
 It is on the right side of the thrust front that there were many, but this seems to be of quality 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:47.780
 A year or later, I received a comment, but I thought it was quite true 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.079
 The 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:01:00.630
 Well there may be talk about this synthesis 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:01:05.250
 First of all, the road ahead of Thrust 's speed is Patti's speed 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:07.140
 It's too early , so I'm going to drop the speed a bit because it's against the angle there 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.810
 I thought so 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:13.840
 This time I here front of the roller 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:30.830
 here but this thrust 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:35.190
 Plate opening degree adjustment arch arch 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:41.100
 It is the first place the cola in this state 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:42.420
 I would like to compare the time by replacing it with a 19 mm aluminum bearing roller of 19 mm 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.720
 think 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:48.890
 Then let's say quickly 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.890
 [musics] 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.610
 3rd place 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:01.370
 Yes 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:07.700
 I tried to put an angle adjustment plate here at Gibbs front 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:08.360
 From what I only put this one side I felt that I was unlikely to go a little 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.780
 What 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:16.460
 And that would put this large outside lows 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:19.710
 If I put this in, I would like to say that I leaned on the bread thing 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:21.890
 I will attach it to you 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:24.890
 [musics] 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.890
 bea 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.979
 [musics] 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:43.200
 [musics] 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.810
 I would like to do the Gyeong-A muffler 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.610
 me 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:49.660
 But it was no good , I will challenge it as a torque tune motor and speed. 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:55.970
 I decide 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:57.680
 I would like to run on this machine soon 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:00.730
 Good Iiii 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:03.629
 [musics] 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.629
 Follow 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:12.240
 [musics] 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:17.340
 me 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:19.100
 I did not plan it somehow but the time is 3 seconds 99 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:23.170
 That's pretty awesome 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:26.530
 It's salty change cherry blossoms . 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:31.030
 Here I entered Ryan Fleur 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:36.230
 I would like to try changing 19 people 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:39.530
 We changed to 19 mi no ne aluminum bearing roller by that 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:45.049
 I on the other but it is I think you can see the other brother is big 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:48.020
 This installation position has changed a little behind the price This is also a difference 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:48.480
 I would like to attention 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:55.960
 doing 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:55.960
 [musics] 

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:00.569

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:03.980
 [musics] 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:07.280
 It's a little in front of the front 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:09.940
 Kedomo this plate I have become wobbly I flew Bukkake 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:13.850
 The members are 4 seconds 03 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:16.510
 Weakened car with a result that is slightly Oze 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:16.510
 f 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:25.419
 Kedomo is around here really Bra by saying yes 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:28.539
 I wrote the size of the roller and I compared the time 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:32.259
 In that number of units it is a straight line is still 

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:37.820
 Attached to the front until the rollers at the little 

00:04:32.259 --> 00:04:41.210
 Suddenly I think the king had a good time but I think it's small 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:44.960
 Unfortunately is Nechotto that has not seen much difference 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:50.300
 It is when you go to the big course someday 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:56.810
 I think I want to do that to compare the time and replacement this roller 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:59.720
 Videos that were compared in 19 m 9 a roller here rear by saying yes 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:03.110
 Could wearing a cast of here 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:04.570
 Please try to do the way Tara also ne good reference 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:07.550
 See you again 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:08.280
 [musics] 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:20.480
