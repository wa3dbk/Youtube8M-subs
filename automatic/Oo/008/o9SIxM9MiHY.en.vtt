 stand to cool a little 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:19.590

 then we will refrigerate it covered 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:57.200
 little while 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:00.049
 and we serve them with toast or cookies 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:02.599

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:04.730
 with this touch of mustard that already 

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:06.530
 makes as very removed what always 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:09.290
 we put lemon pepper salt on 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:12.079
 cilantro, onion, tomato and others 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:15.019
 and in this case you are adding us good 

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:17.090
 well the radishes that also the oil 

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:19.220
 olive that gives it a very good flavor and 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:21.859
 course the mustard that will leave us 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:24.020
 a stew that we will want to eat and 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:25.729
 eat and eat that will be very rich and 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:28.190
 we can decorate it with a little bit of 

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:30.949
 lettuce over chopped if you notice that yes 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:32.300
 I loved the recipe for the same 

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:35.000
 gentlemen who like jalapeño pepper 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:37.070
 well a jalapeño kilito truth ready 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.440
 clear as chile serrano if they want or 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:41.449
 whoever it is and they still hear up to chile 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:43.729
 chipotle would look good where to stay 

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:45.440
 he has all kinds of tim all 

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:47.780
 it really is that it is very 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:49.639
 tasty very easy to make so that 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:51.349
 these days where we already have the 

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:53.030
 warm up Guadalajara and I 

00:04:51.349 --> 00:04:54.949
 I suppose that of many, many parts in the 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:56.630
 world because life is not complicated in 

00:04:54.949 --> 00:04:59.009
 only seven minutes have a breast 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:01.800
 cooked and the rest is already 

00:04:59.009 --> 00:05:04.289
 nothing nothing else mix I want to chop but 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:07.409
 it's very fast because there's not much 

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:09.659
 amount of more you get enough 

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:11.430
 Toast because it yields a lot 

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:12.649
 a lot this is so that as for a 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:14.789
 family of four 

00:05:12.649 --> 00:05:16.919
 exactly a family of four like that 

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:19.169
 that if you are six or seven and they are 

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:20.520
 very well known then put two breasts and 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:23.659
 you know they do it twice as long 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:26.759
 but they take a few minutes a minute 

00:05:23.659 --> 00:05:28.949
 per breast one minute per breast and 

00:05:26.759 --> 00:05:30.389
 is excellent I liked the 

00:05:28.949 --> 00:05:32.669
 combination that you made of mustard 

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:34.860
 oil because it 's like it's a 

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:37.620
 vinaigrette and lemon juice 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:40.289
 but with this idea of such ceviche 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:42.270
 Mexican so Peruvian so Latino then 

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:44.999
 good then very rich recipe dear friend 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:47.580

00:05:44.999 --> 00:05:50.759
 our friends and our friends or if 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:53.399
 many already cook in their house they live 

00:05:50.759 --> 00:05:55.259

00:05:53.399 --> 00:05:56.669

00:05:58.439 --> 00:06:01.709
 like to get into the kitchen and do not mess 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:05.000
 So much is that the woman is not going to 

00:06:01.709 --> 00:06:08.010
