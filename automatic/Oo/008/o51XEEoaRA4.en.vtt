00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
you are not looking at him you could

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.930 
you are not looking at him you could
technically<00:00:43.290> evade<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:44.129> enemy<00:00:44.520> with<00:00:44.760> these

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
technically evade the enemy with these

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.569 
technically evade the enemy with these
new<00:00:45.149> features<00:00:45.559> which<00:00:46.559> is<00:00:46.739> pretty<00:00:46.920> sweet<00:00:47.129> so<00:00:47.460> we

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
new features which is pretty sweet so we

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:48.979 
new features which is pretty sweet so we
got<00:00:47.730> to<00:00:47.820> see<00:00:48.000> how<00:00:48.149> this<00:00:48.329> was<00:00:48.510> all<00:00:48.690> played<00:00:48.960> out

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
got to see how this was all played out

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.439 
got to see how this was all played out
with<00:00:49.350> sensitivity<00:00:50.190> we<00:00:50.850> noticed<00:00:51.210> he<00:00:51.329> is

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
with sensitivity we noticed he is

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.200 
with sensitivity we noticed he is
turning<00:00:51.750> and<00:00:52.280> he<00:00:53.280> did<00:00:53.579> it<00:00:53.699> turn<00:00:53.850> very<00:00:54.120> quickly

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
turning and he did it turn very quickly

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.420 
turning and he did it turn very quickly
so<00:00:54.780> I'm<00:00:54.870> assuming<00:00:55.020> that<00:00:55.710> since<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.129> tivity

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
so I'm assuming that since the tivity

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.279 
so I'm assuming that since the tivity
might<00:00:56.579> be<00:00:56.730> controlled<00:00:57.180> in<00:00:57.329> some<00:00:57.570> situations

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
might be controlled in some situations

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.439 
might be controlled in some situations
we<00:00:58.469> will<00:00:58.590> have<00:00:58.739> to<00:00:58.829> wait<00:00:58.949> and<00:00:59.100> see<00:00:59.160> on<00:00:59.280> that<00:00:59.449> the

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
we will have to wait and see on that the

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.119 
we will have to wait and see on that the
fact<00:01:00.690> that<00:01:00.809> he<00:01:00.899> killed<00:01:01.260> him<00:01:01.379> pretty<00:01:01.590> easily<00:01:01.649> in

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
fact that he killed him pretty easily in

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.939 
fact that he killed him pretty easily in
the<00:01:02.160> air<00:01:02.370> but<00:01:02.699> he<00:01:02.789> wasn't<00:01:02.969> shooting<00:01:03.270> at<00:01:03.539> you<00:01:03.949> as

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
the air but he wasn't shooting at you as

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.460 
the air but he wasn't shooting at you as
you<00:01:05.280> noticed<00:01:05.580> in<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:05.880> actual<00:01:06.540> footage<00:01:07.170> there

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470

I want to see if he can actually shoot
when<00:01:09.600> you're<00:01:09.750> in<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:09.960> air<00:01:10.080> now<00:01:10.320> you<00:01:10.830> can<00:01:11.100> shoot

when you're in the air now you can shoot

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.450 
when you're in the air now you can shoot
when<00:01:11.640> you're<00:01:11.850> actually<00:01:12.439> dashing<00:01:13.439> so<00:01:14.070> yes<00:01:14.430> you

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
jumping there like that that's the big

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.469 
jumping there like that that's the big
question<00:01:20.790> and<00:01:21.439> also<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:23.009> fact<00:01:23.250> that<00:01:23.400> can<00:01:24.210> you

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
question and also the fact that can you

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.810 
question and also the fact that can you
dash<00:01:24.810> forward<00:01:25.200> and<00:01:25.409> backwards<00:01:25.860> can<00:01:26.159> you<00:01:26.310> jump

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
dash forward and backwards can you jump

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.480 
dash forward and backwards can you jump
high<00:01:27.060> left<00:01:27.540> to<00:01:27.780> right<00:01:28.020> or<00:01:28.290> are<00:01:29.280> they

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
high left to right or are they

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.560 
high left to right or are they
controlled<00:01:30.060> in<00:01:30.299> certain<00:01:30.930> situations<00:01:32.570> also

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
controlled in certain situations also

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.260 
controlled in certain situations also
you<00:01:34.439> can<00:01:34.470> actually<00:01:34.829> notice<00:01:35.369> that<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.729> map<00:01:36.000> is

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
you can actually notice that the map is

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.240 
you can actually notice that the map is
back<00:01:36.689> to<00:01:36.869> what<00:01:37.020> it<00:01:37.049> used<00:01:37.140> to<00:01:37.409> be<00:01:37.439> on<00:01:37.650> size<00:01:37.950> is

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
back to what it used to be on size is

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.039 
back to what it used to be on size is
tilted<00:01:38.700> a<00:01:38.790> little<00:01:38.820> to<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.329> right<00:01:39.360> like

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
tilted a little to the right like

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.740 
tilted a little to the right like
titanfall<00:01:40.470> which<00:01:41.400> is<00:01:41.610> fine<00:01:41.880> by<00:01:42.060> me<00:01:42.270> actually<00:01:42.479> I

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
titanfall which is fine by me actually I

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.569 
titanfall which is fine by me actually I
think<00:01:43.020> that's<00:01:43.170> a<00:01:43.290> nice<00:01:43.500> little<00:01:43.770> angle<00:01:44.189> set<00:01:44.460> up

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
think that's a nice little angle set up

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.690 
think that's a nice little angle set up
on<00:01:44.790> that<00:01:44.970> and<00:01:45.240> also<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.710> kill<00:01:47.009> feed<00:01:47.280> is<00:01:47.460> back

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
on that and also the kill feed is back

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.130 
on that and also the kill feed is back
to<00:01:47.850> where<00:01:48.000> it<00:01:48.030> used<00:01:48.270> to<00:01:48.420> be<00:01:48.600> which<00:01:48.780> is<00:01:48.810> really

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
to where it used to be which is really

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.200 
to where it used to be which is really
nice<00:01:49.380> because<00:01:49.590> I<00:01:49.799> like<00:01:49.979> having<00:01:50.490> that<00:01:50.610> on<00:01:50.880> one

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
nice because I like having that on one

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.080 
nice because I like having that on one
side<00:01:51.540> so<00:01:51.960> if<00:01:52.229> I<00:01:52.380> am<00:01:52.560> looking<00:01:52.740> at<00:01:53.009> the<00:01:53.220> map<00:01:53.729> I

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
side so if I am looking at the map I

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.910 
side so if I am looking at the map I
could<00:01:54.570> just<00:01:54.720> scroll<00:01:55.020> my<00:01:55.170> eyes<00:01:55.350> down<00:01:55.680> really

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
could just scroll my eyes down really

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.249 
could just scroll my eyes down really
quickly<00:01:56.250> instead<00:01:56.640> of<00:01:56.790> going<00:01:57.450> across<00:01:57.810> the

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
quickly instead of going across the

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.490 
quickly instead of going across the
other<00:01:58.409> side<00:01:58.560> which<00:01:59.219> is<00:01:59.250> very<00:01:59.820> helpful<00:02:00.119> and<00:02:00.500> the

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
other side which is very helpful and the

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.770 
other side which is very helpful and the
fact<00:02:01.770> that<00:02:01.920> score<00:02:02.579> streaks<00:02:03.030> are<00:02:03.240> back<00:02:03.450> it's

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
fact that score streaks are back it's

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.050 
fact that score streaks are back it's
not<00:02:04.409> called<00:02:04.710> duty<00:02:04.920> without<00:02:05.070> killstreaks<00:02:05.850> we

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
not called duty without killstreaks we

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.839 
not called duty without killstreaks we
have<00:02:06.180> to<00:02:06.360> kill<00:02:06.600> streaks<00:02:06.869> here<00:02:07.049> 700<00:02:07.680> 600<00:02:08.160> he

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
have to kill streaks here 700 600 he

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:12.050 
have to kill streaks here 700 600 he
gets<00:02:09.090> a<00:02:09.239> kill<00:02:09.509> it<00:02:09.810> drops<00:02:10.649> down<00:02:10.800> to<00:02:10.950> 600<00:02:11.489> 500<00:02:11.970> so

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
gets a kill it drops down to 600 500 so

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.520 
gets a kill it drops down to 600 500 so
let's<00:02:12.180> letting<00:02:12.480> you<00:02:12.540> know<00:02:12.660> how<00:02:12.870> many<00:02:13.050> you<00:02:13.140> need

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
let's letting you know how many you need

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.559 
let's letting you know how many you need
war<00:02:13.680> to<00:02:14.130> get<00:02:14.340> your<00:02:14.490> killstreaks<00:02:15.150> which<00:02:15.390> is

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
war to get your killstreaks which is

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:18.199 
war to get your killstreaks which is
pretty<00:02:15.720> sweet<00:02:15.930> and<00:02:16.310> I'm<00:02:17.310> assuming<00:02:17.670> what<00:02:18.120> it

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
pretty sweet and I'm assuming what it

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.090 
pretty sweet and I'm assuming what it
would<00:02:18.330> be<00:02:18.450> 726<00:02:19.020> kills<00:02:19.530> to<00:02:19.740> get<00:02:19.890> those

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
would be 726 kills to get those

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.820 
would be 726 kills to get those
killstreaks<00:02:20.850> unless<00:02:21.300> you<00:02:21.870> got<00:02:22.020> kills<00:02:22.350> before

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
killstreaks unless you got kills before

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.160 
killstreaks unless you got kills before
that<00:02:23.040> and<00:02:23.670> then<00:02:24.330> your<00:02:24.450> abilities<00:02:24.990> I'm

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
that and then your abilities I'm

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.050 
that and then your abilities I'm
assuming<00:02:25.620> these<00:02:25.740> blue<00:02:26.100> things<00:02:26.130> on<00:02:26.610> the<00:02:26.700> bottom

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
assuming these blue things on the bottom

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.720 
assuming these blue things on the bottom
on<00:02:27.870> top<00:02:28.140> of<00:02:28.260> the<00:02:28.319> weapon<00:02:28.650> here<00:02:28.860> that<00:02:29.459> actually

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
on top of the weapon here that actually

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.990 
on top of the weapon here that actually
have<00:02:30.060> five<00:02:30.390> bars<00:02:30.630> okay<00:02:31.140> you<00:02:31.200> got<00:02:31.410> two<00:02:31.620> of<00:02:31.739> them

have five bars okay you got two of them

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.570 
have five bars okay you got two of them
so<00:02:33.000> do<00:02:33.630> they<00:02:33.780> recharge<00:02:34.230> I'm<00:02:34.590> assuming<00:02:35.069> you

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
so do they recharge I'm assuming you

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.699 
so do they recharge I'm assuming you
can't<00:02:35.880> spam<00:02:36.390> your<00:02:36.690> abilities<00:02:37.140> on<00:02:37.319> your<00:02:37.470> suit
