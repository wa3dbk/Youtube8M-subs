00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:17.930
 What's up with kids here in the Canary Islands 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.910
 I bring a trick to the call of duty 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:21.770
 2 dishes for zombie mode on the map 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.110
 juliette and for this trick we are going to 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:26.810
 necessarily need the new weapon 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:29.090
 of this map the paralyzer that if what 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:31.160
 trick is called petrified and we're going to 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:33.350
 need to come here right in front of 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.449
 the witch mansion and only with 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:38.150
 raise ourselves a little we will get them 

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:39.769
 hook in a high place where 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:41.629
 the zombies will not give us 

00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:43.130
 we have to come right here just like 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:45.320
 you see in the video on the barrier where it is 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:47.120
 neither bent outward and you have to 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.370
 rise and do not leave us a step 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:52.100
 invisible where the zombies are 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:54.500
 accumulate just right under our and not 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.510
 will give us a touch or nothing good 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.710
 once in a while some touch can 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:01.570
 buy titan also to be sure 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.700
 but come on, they give you all of them 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:06.640
 we had until round 15 or so 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:08.260
 If I'm wrong and do not behave 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.540
 neither is the truth and the one that 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.690
 was in the trick or that the one who did not 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.360
 I was 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:16.250
 fix where the accumulation that 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.560
 it is just below us that is in the 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.750
 trick sometimes will take bonuses to 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.690
 Sometimes it does not depend on where else the zombie 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:25.460
 if it is too far from gold and those of 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:27.500
 older ones have to be put right here 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:30.070
 where will be on p5 to the door 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:33.140
 to the witches open tucked inside 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.820
 never get much more if you do not appear 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:39.320
 the witch you just have to be here 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:42.140
 at the entrance and nothing zombies will come from 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:45.470
 once in a while some as you see but 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.780
 nothing very few if you are more than more than one 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:50.750
 this time we were just me and 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:53.540
 they will take that was the trick and I here 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.950
 with an mp5 but you do not know how to fix that 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.950
 a zombie came from time to time but 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:00.440
 easy to kill and it's already so nothing 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:03.979
 but you liked to remember that you have 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:06.930
 infinite mp5 with this trick for all 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:09.570
 those that are not uploaded in the trick 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.850
 and nothing but I like this trick you give him 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:15.110
 life favorites and if you are not and we 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.110
 we see the next video
