00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
little modified to be autonomous and

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.050 
little modified to be autonomous and
that's<00:03:11.920> the<00:03:12.100> wreckage<00:03:12.460> that<00:03:12.700> from<00:03:12.880> their

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
that's the wreckage that from their

that's the wreckage that from their
attempt<00:03:18.330> those<00:03:19.330> things<00:03:19.630> to<00:03:19.810> come<00:03:20.250> that's<00:03:21.250> what

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
attempt those things to come that's what

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.280 
attempt those things to come that's what
we're<00:03:21.580> here<00:03:21.730> for

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
we're here for

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.460 
we're here for
exactly<00:03:23.500> China's<00:03:24.490> and<00:03:24.700> Cassius<00:03:25.470> removing

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
exactly China's and Cassius removing

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.740 
exactly China's and Cassius removing
them<00:03:26.590> requires<00:03:27.010> two<00:03:27.310> souls<00:03:27.700> that's<00:03:28.240> the<00:03:28.510> only

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
them requires two souls that's the only

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.300 
them requires two souls that's the only
way<00:03:28.870> they<00:03:29.080> can<00:03:29.200> even<00:03:29.380> be<00:03:29.590> retrieved

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
way they can even be retrieved

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.370 
way they can even be retrieved
it's<00:03:30.970> the<00:03:31.150> necessity<00:03:31.720> of<00:03:31.750> the<00:03:31.930> double-entry

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.380 
it's the necessity of the double-entry

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:35.670 
it's the necessity of the double-entry
system<00:03:32.790> well<00:03:33.790> if<00:03:34.060> that's<00:03:34.300> all<00:03:34.570> couldn't<00:03:35.560> she

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
system well if that's all couldn't she

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.550 
system well if that's all couldn't she
just<00:03:35.710> as<00:03:36.040> easily<00:03:36.250> have<00:03:36.550> taken<00:03:36.580> my<00:03:37.030> place<00:03:37.560> not

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
just as easily have taken my place not

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.680 
just as easily have taken my place not
at<00:03:38.710> all<00:03:38.860> a<00:03:39.070> replica<00:03:39.430> can't<00:03:39.940> take<00:03:40.210> an<00:03:40.360> events

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690 
at all a replica can't take an events

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:42.810 
at all a replica can't take an events
place<00:03:40.960> their<00:03:41.530> souls<00:03:41.830> reside<00:03:42.220> in<00:03:42.400> a<00:03:42.490> different

place than hers now

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:56.720 
place than hers now
let's<00:03:45.640> begin

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:01.350 

what's<00:03:57.510> the<00:03:57.689> matter<00:03:57.840> color

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:01.360 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.690 

this<00:04:01.840> isn't<00:04:02.200> writing<00:04:02.440> they<00:04:03.250> seem<00:04:03.490> to<00:04:03.640> have

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:03.700 
this isn't writing they seem to have

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.810 
this isn't writing they seem to have
shifted<00:04:04.000> inform<00:04:04.630> their<00:04:05.320> matching<00:04:05.800> now<00:04:05.980> let's

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:06.820 
shifted inform their matching now let's

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:08.850 
shifted inform their matching now let's
just<00:04:07.030> hurry<00:04:07.180> and<00:04:07.330> pull<00:04:07.600> them<00:04:07.750> out<00:04:07.840> that's<00:04:08.740> what

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:08.860 
just hurry and pull them out that's what

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:11.850 
just hurry and pull them out that's what
we<00:04:08.950> came<00:04:09.100> down<00:04:09.310> here<00:04:09.550> for<00:04:09.700> now
