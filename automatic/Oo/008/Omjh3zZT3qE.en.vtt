00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
the shops were going to be like but I

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:10.090 
the shops were going to be like but I
think<00:02:09.019> it<00:02:09.320> would<00:02:09.410> be<00:02:09.440> good<00:02:09.590> for<00:02:09.649> you<00:02:09.800> guys<00:02:09.920> look

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:10.100 
think it would be good for you guys look

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.340 
think it would be good for you guys look
at<00:02:10.250> if<00:02:10.399> you<00:02:10.640> are<00:02:10.970> beginner<00:02:11.600> filmmakers<00:02:12.140> and

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
at if you are beginner filmmakers and

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.520 
at if you are beginner filmmakers and
just<00:02:13.220> give<00:02:13.340> me<00:02:13.400> an<00:02:13.459> idea<00:02:13.519> like<00:02:13.850> how<00:02:14.530> the

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
just give me an idea like how the

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:16.630 
just give me an idea like how the
process<00:02:15.890> that<00:02:16.010> i<00:02:16.100> go<00:02:16.130> through<00:02:16.310> when<00:02:16.550> i'm

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
process that i go through when i'm

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:17.979 
process that i go through when i'm
coming<00:02:16.850> up<00:02:16.940> playing<00:02:17.120> especially<00:02:17.480> that<00:02:17.660> fast

coming up playing especially that fast

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:20.350 
coming up playing especially that fast
it<00:02:18.950> is<00:02:19.010> easier<00:02:19.580> to<00:02:19.640> go<00:02:19.819> out<00:02:19.940> with<00:02:19.970> a<00:02:20.120> camera

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:22.290 
starting early so it's something that I

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:24.380 
starting early so it's something that I
have<00:05:22.440> to<00:05:22.470> include<00:05:22.740> into<00:05:23.160> the<00:05:23.250> script<00:05:23.490> so<00:05:24.300> we

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:26.730 
came up with the idea and now I'm kind

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:28.430 
came up with the idea and now I'm kind
of<00:05:26.820> like<00:05:27.030> the<00:05:27.150> storyboarding<00:05:27.810> writing<00:05:28.230> stage

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:28.440 
of like the storyboarding writing stage

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:31.820 
of like the storyboarding writing stage
and<00:05:28.770> a<00:05:29.840> lot<00:05:30.840> of<00:05:30.870> directors<00:05:31.320> disagree<00:05:31.800> on

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:31.830 
and a lot of directors disagree on

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:33.290 
and a lot of directors disagree on
whether<00:05:32.160> you<00:05:32.400> should<00:05:32.490> have<00:05:32.640> storyboards<00:05:32.970> or

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:33.300 
whether you should have storyboards or

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:35.600 
whether you should have storyboards or
not<00:05:33.419> I<00:05:34.260> believe<00:05:34.919> that<00:05:34.950> if<00:05:35.220> you're<00:05:35.370> a<00:05:35.430> beginner

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:35.610 
not I believe that if you're a beginner

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:37.730 
not I believe that if you're a beginner
filmmaker<00:05:36.330> that<00:05:37.140> you<00:05:37.290> should<00:05:37.590> use

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:37.740 
filmmaker that you should use

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:39.320 
filmmaker that you should use
storyboards<00:05:38.040> I<00:05:38.490> don't<00:05:38.880> know<00:05:38.970> if<00:05:39.060> I<00:05:39.120> call

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:39.330 
storyboards I don't know if I call

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:41.480 
storyboards I don't know if I call
myself<00:05:39.479> a<00:05:39.870> beginner<00:05:40.169> but<00:05:40.710> I'm<00:05:41.010> definitely<00:05:41.220> not

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:41.490 
myself a beginner but I'm definitely not

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:43.580 
myself a beginner but I'm definitely not
an<00:05:41.610> expert<00:05:41.970> yet<00:05:42.150> so<00:05:42.720> I<00:05:42.750> still<00:05:43.200> use<00:05:43.410> some

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:43.590 
an expert yet so I still use some

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:46.159 
an expert yet so I still use some
storyboards<00:05:43.979> and<00:05:44.160> that's<00:05:44.340> just<00:05:44.490> because<00:05:45.169> it

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:46.169 
storyboards and that's just because it

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:47.780 
storyboards and that's just because it
almost<00:05:46.320> becomes<00:05:46.770> second<00:05:47.190> nature<00:05:47.220> want<00:05:47.580> to<00:05:47.669> get

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:47.790 
almost becomes second nature want to get

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:49.070 
almost becomes second nature want to get
really<00:05:47.940> good<00:05:48.090> and<00:05:48.330> coverage<00:05:48.720> is<00:05:48.840> really

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:49.080 
really good and coverage is really

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:50.690 
really good and coverage is really
simple<00:05:49.290> for<00:05:49.530> people<00:05:49.560> who<00:05:49.919> are<00:05:50.100> have<00:05:50.580> been

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:50.700 
simple for people who are have been

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:52.159 
simple for people who are have been
making<00:05:51.180> films<00:05:51.419> for<00:05:51.479> a<00:05:51.570> long<00:05:51.690> time<00:05:51.930> and<00:05:52.110> they

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:52.169 
making films for a long time and they

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:55.040 
making films for a long time and they
don't<00:05:52.260> need<00:05:52.440> storyboards<00:05:52.950> necessarily<00:05:54.050> but

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:55.050 
don't need storyboards necessarily but

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:56.900 
don't need storyboards necessarily but
coverage<00:05:55.890> is<00:05:56.160> still<00:05:56.430> something<00:05:56.640> that<00:05:56.760> I

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:56.910 
coverage is still something that I

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:58.219 
coverage is still something that I
struggle<00:05:57.210> with<00:05:57.240> so<00:05:57.540> I<00:05:57.570> still<00:05:57.990> use<00:05:58.140> the

00:05:58.219 --> 00:05:58.229 
struggle with so I still use the

00:05:58.229 --> 00:06:00.080 
struggle with so I still use the
storyboards<00:05:58.710> but<00:05:59.280> instead<00:05:59.460> of<00:05:59.550> drawing<00:05:59.790> them

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:00.090 
storyboards but instead of drawing them

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:01.850 
storyboards but instead of drawing them
this<00:06:00.180> time<00:06:00.419> I<00:06:00.690> decided<00:06:01.050> to<00:06:01.380> go<00:06:01.530> out<00:06:01.650> to<00:06:01.770> the

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:01.860 
this time I decided to go out to the

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:04.670 
this time I decided to go out to the
location<00:06:02.130> where<00:06:02.310> we'll<00:06:02.580> be<00:06:02.610> filming<00:06:03.000> and<00:06:03.680> I

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:04.680 
location where we'll be filming and I

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:06.740 
location where we'll be filming and I
just<00:06:05.220> kind<00:06:05.370> of<00:06:05.400> like<00:06:05.610> a<00:06:05.669> rough<00:06:05.940> draft<00:06:06.180> of<00:06:06.690> what

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:06.750 
just kind of like a rough draft of what

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:08.750 
just kind of like a rough draft of what
the<00:06:07.200> story<00:06:07.470> is<00:06:07.530> going<00:06:07.620> to<00:06:07.740> be<00:06:07.830> like<00:06:07.979> and<00:06:08.250> I<00:06:08.580> used

couple hours before it was under it

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:23.870 
couple hours before it was under it
without<00:06:22.710> you<00:06:23.250> know<00:06:23.310> with<00:06:23.430> missing<00:06:23.700> sound

effects and stuff like that um sorry I
just<00:06:27.960> like<00:06:28.140> a<00:06:28.169> burst<00:06:28.440> of<00:06:28.530> energy<00:06:28.680> I've<00:06:28.979> been

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:29.010 
just like a burst of energy I've been

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:33.250 
just like a burst of energy I've been
talking<00:06:29.430> really<00:06:29.550> fast<00:06:31.700> but

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:33.260 
talking really fast but

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.230 
talking really fast but
oh<00:06:33.320> so<00:06:33.920> yeah<00:06:34.040> so<00:06:34.340> what<00:06:34.460> I<00:06:34.490> did<00:06:34.580> was<00:06:34.730> Hannah<00:06:35.150> and

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:35.240 
oh so yeah so what I did was Hannah and

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:36.880 
oh so yeah so what I did was Hannah and
I<00:06:35.270> went<00:06:35.480> out<00:06:35.510> to<00:06:35.600> the<00:06:35.660> location<00:06:35.900> and<00:06:36.260> i<00:06:36.710> did<00:06:36.860> a

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:36.890 
I went out to the location and i did a

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:38.770 
I went out to the location and i did a
rough<00:06:37.100> draft<00:06:37.250> of<00:06:37.550> how<00:06:37.760> the<00:06:38.180> coverage<00:06:38.510> is<00:06:38.600> going

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:38.780 
rough draft of how the coverage is going

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:41.080 
rough draft of how the coverage is going
to<00:06:38.840> go<00:06:38.980> so<00:06:39.980> none<00:06:40.220> of<00:06:40.250> it<00:06:40.400> really<00:06:40.430> cuts<00:06:40.760> together

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:41.090 
to go so none of it really cuts together

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:42.520 
to go so none of it really cuts together
perfectly<00:06:41.450> because<00:06:41.660> I<00:06:41.810> didn't<00:06:42.260> really<00:06:42.380> know

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:42.530 
perfectly because I didn't really know

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:44.200 
perfectly because I didn't really know
what<00:06:42.560> I<00:06:42.680> wanted<00:06:43.010> yet<00:06:43.220> and<00:06:43.400> the<00:06:43.760> sound<00:06:43.970> is<00:06:44.060> off

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:44.210 
what I wanted yet and the sound is off

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:46.240 
what I wanted yet and the sound is off
there's<00:06:44.480> no<00:06:44.570> lines<00:06:44.810> and<00:06:45.200> the<00:06:45.740> costumes<00:06:45.920> aren't

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:46.250 
there's no lines and the costumes aren't

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:49.240 
there's no lines and the costumes aren't
right<00:06:46.370> they're<00:06:46.550> going<00:06:46.670> to<00:06:46.790> be<00:06:47.440> but<00:06:48.440> i<00:06:48.710> thought

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:49.250
