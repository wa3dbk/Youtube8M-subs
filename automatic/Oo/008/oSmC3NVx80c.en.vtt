00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:32.180 
anything but it is a good fertilizer for

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.080 
anything but it is a good fertilizer for
fruit<00:00:32.689> trees<00:00:33.280> so<00:00:34.280> I'm<00:00:34.370> spreading<00:00:34.850> it<00:00:34.970> out

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:35.090

fairly<00:00:35.660> amply<00:00:36.670> this<00:00:37.670> is<00:00:37.880> the<00:00:38.360> reason<00:00:38.510> being<00:00:38.899> is

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:39.230 
fairly amply this is the reason being is

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.370

of<00:02:17.150> one<00:02:17.480> of<00:02:17.600> my<00:02:17.720> raspberry<00:02:18.350> patches<00:02:19.030> now<00:02:20.030> these

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.240 
of one of my raspberry patches now these

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.390 
of one of my raspberry patches now these
are<00:02:20.510> heavy<00:02:20.750> feeders<00:02:21.170> so<00:02:21.590> it<00:02:21.740> takes<00:02:21.950> a<00:02:22.160> lot<00:02:22.370> of

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
are heavy feeders so it takes a lot of

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.470 
are heavy feeders so it takes a lot of
fertilizer<00:02:22.760> for<00:02:23.450> these<00:02:23.630> things<00:02:24.190> but<00:02:25.480> they're

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
fertilizer for these things but they're

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:32.020 
fertilizer for these things but they're
doing<00:02:26.840> pretty<00:02:27.050> good<00:02:29.950> these<00:02:30.950> photos<00:02:31.430> here<00:02:31.730> show

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
a good picture of how our raspberries

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.430 
a good picture of how our raspberries
are<00:02:34.160> doing<00:02:34.490> they're<00:02:35.300> coming<00:02:35.660> on<00:02:35.810> very<00:02:36.110> heavy

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:40.490 
and looking pretty good next year

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:43.360 
and looking pretty good next year
they'll<00:02:40.760> probably<00:02:41.510> be<00:02:42.080> bigger<00:02:42.320> in<00:02:42.620> size<00:02:42.920> as

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
they'll probably be bigger in size as

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.630 
they'll probably be bigger in size as
well<00:02:43.880> as<00:02:44.450> numbers<00:02:44.959> so<00:02:45.860> we're<00:02:46.010> looking<00:02:46.370> forward

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640
