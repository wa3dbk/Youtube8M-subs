as you would imagine

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.020 
as you would imagine
and<00:01:23.640> I'm<00:01:24.000> integrated<00:01:24.740> into<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:26.310> wing<00:01:26.550> section

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
and I'm integrated into the wing section

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.969 
and I'm integrated into the wing section
when<00:01:27.150> that<00:01:27.270> is<00:01:27.420> lowered

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:29.979 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:31.890 

we<00:01:30.430> had<00:01:30.549> this<00:01:30.640> car<00:01:30.850> fired<00:01:31.090> up<00:01:31.270> a<00:01:31.540> couple<00:01:31.780> of

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:31.900 
we had this car fired up a couple of

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.179 
we had this car fired up a couple of
minutes<00:01:32.140> ago<00:01:32.229> and<00:01:32.439> the<00:01:32.500> exhaust<00:01:32.830> sounds

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:33.189 
minutes ago and the exhaust sounds

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:34.999 
minutes ago and the exhaust sounds
fantastic

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
fantastic

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.170 
fantastic
we'll<00:01:36.009> probably<00:01:36.189> question<00:01:36.790> whether<00:01:36.939> you<00:01:37.060> need

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:37.180 
we'll probably question whether you need

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.749 
we'll probably question whether you need
even<00:01:37.299> sports<00:01:37.659> exhaust<00:01:37.840> on<00:01:38.170> this<00:01:38.320> car<00:01:38.500> now<00:01:38.759> it

00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:39.759 
even sports exhaust on this car now it

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:41.550 
even sports exhaust on this car now it
sounds<00:01:39.909> really<00:01:40.299> great<00:01:40.509> got<00:01:41.380> a<00:01:41.409> lot<00:01:41.530> of

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
sounds really great got a lot of

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:42.530 
sounds really great got a lot of
character<00:01:41.979> to<00:01:42.009> it

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
character to it

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.469 
character to it
berbils<00:01:43.540> and<00:01:43.720> pops<00:01:43.960> just<00:01:44.470> like<00:01:44.649> you<00:01:44.860> would

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
berbils and pops just like you would

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:51.840 
berbils and pops just like you would
you'd<00:01:46.479> imagine

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.050 

singly<00:01:52.720> these<00:01:52.869> air<00:01:53.080> intakes<00:01:53.500> these<00:01:54.460> just<00:01:54.970> like

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
singly these air intakes these just like

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.300 
singly these air intakes these just like
the<00:01:55.210> Boxster<00:01:55.630> now<00:01:55.930> will<00:01:56.500> pull<00:01:56.710> air<00:01:56.920> on<00:01:57.100> both

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
the Boxster now will pull air on both

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.060 
the Boxster now will pull air on both
sides<00:01:57.640> they<00:01:58.090> also<00:01:58.240> have<00:01:58.479> a<00:01:58.509> purge<00:01:58.900> fan<00:01:59.350> which

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.070 
sides they also have a purge fan which

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:02.039 
sides they also have a purge fan which
is<00:02:00.100> on<00:02:00.759> the<00:02:00.940> lower<00:02:01.119> section<00:02:01.420> too<00:02:01.780> so<00:02:01.930> it

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:02.049 
is on the lower section too so it

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:03.840 
is on the lower section too so it
actually<00:02:02.170> blow<00:02:02.530> out<00:02:02.799> the<00:02:03.100> the<00:02:03.460> hot<00:02:03.610> air<00:02:03.820> from

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 
actually blow out the the hot air from

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.359 
actually blow out the the hot air from
the<00:02:04.180> from<00:02:04.899> the<00:02:04.990> engine<00:02:05.200> compartment<00:02:05.340> which<00:02:06.340> is

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:06.369 
the from the engine compartment which is

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:10.050 
the from the engine compartment which is
of<00:02:06.610> course<00:02:07.110> right<00:02:08.110> in<00:02:08.140> the<00:02:08.350> center<00:02:09.060> right

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
of course right in the center right

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:21.860 
of course right in the center right
behind<00:02:10.300> here<00:02:14.250> let's<00:02:15.250> pop<00:02:15.489> the<00:02:15.640> trunk

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.670 

so<00:02:22.500> look<00:02:22.620> at<00:02:22.739> the<00:02:23.120> rear<00:02:24.120> compartment<00:02:24.690> and<00:02:25.410> now

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
so look at the rear compartment and now

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.170 
so look at the rear compartment and now
this<00:02:25.890> is<00:02:26.069> where<00:02:26.220> you<00:02:26.310> will<00:02:26.430> adjust<00:02:26.819> your<00:02:26.970> oil

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
this is where you will adjust your oil
