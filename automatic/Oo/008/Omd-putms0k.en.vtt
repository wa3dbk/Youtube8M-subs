the<00:00:38.640> amount<00:00:38.790> of<00:00:39.530> duplicates<00:00:40.530> we<00:00:40.770> are<00:00:40.890> gained

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
the amount of duplicates we are gained

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.400 
the amount of duplicates we are gained
so<00:00:41.790> early<00:00:42.090> on<00:00:42.210> we<00:00:42.390> haven't<00:00:42.540> if<00:00:42.870> you<00:00:42.960> look<00:00:43.140> back

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
so early on we haven't if you look back

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.520 
so early on we haven't if you look back
over<00:00:43.710> there<00:00:44.160> I<00:00:44.370> think<00:00:44.879> it's<00:00:45.030> 18<00:00:45.539> 19<00:00:45.870> episodes

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
over there I think it's 18 19 episodes

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.060 
over there I think it's 18 19 episodes
now<00:00:46.710> of<00:00:47.460> how<00:00:47.940> many<00:00:48.469> how<00:00:49.469> many<00:00:49.530> packs<00:00:49.860> have<00:00:50.010> been

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
now of how many how many packs have been

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.500 
now of how many how many packs have been
off<00:00:50.250> and<00:00:50.460> not<00:00:50.610> many<00:00:50.789> have<00:00:50.879> been<00:00:50.969> opened<00:00:51.329> so<00:00:51.449> I'm

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
off and not many have been opened so I'm

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.569 
off and not many have been opened so I'm
surprised<00:00:51.870> how<00:00:52.050> many<00:00:52.110> duplicate<00:00:52.590> players<00:00:52.860> we

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
surprised how many duplicate players we

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.000 
surprised how many duplicate players we
are<00:00:53.730> getting<00:00:54.059> considering<00:00:54.629> how<00:00:54.840> many<00:00:55.010> gold

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
are getting considering how many gold

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.439 
are getting considering how many gold
players<00:00:56.250> there<00:00:56.520> are<00:00:56.610> in<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:56.940> pool<00:00:57.149> which<00:00:57.420> is

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
players there are in the pool which is

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.630 
players there are in the pool which is
absolutely<00:00:57.840> ridiculous<00:00:58.260> but<00:00:58.770> we<00:00:59.250> do<00:00:59.430> have

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
absolutely ridiculous but we do have

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.930 
absolutely ridiculous but we do have
some<00:00:59.879> big<00:01:00.120> names<00:01:00.420> in<00:01:00.719> team<00:01:01.140> already<00:01:01.469> and<00:01:01.940> we're

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
some big names in team already and we're

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.700

skills<00:04:30.080> but<00:04:30.470> I<00:04:30.530> was<00:04:30.650> a<00:04:30.710> tidy<00:04:30.979> finish<00:04:31.280> and<00:04:31.610> that

00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:31.639 
skills but I was a tidy finish and that

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:33.820 
skills but I was a tidy finish and that
it<00:04:32.240> does<00:04:32.419> make<00:04:32.599> it<00:04:32.810> free<00:04:33.080> kneel<00:04:33.259> and<00:04:33.409> takes<00:04:33.650> him

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:33.830 
it does make it free kneel and takes him

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:35.740 
it does make it free kneel and takes him
one<00:04:34.129> step<00:04:34.520> closer<00:04:34.849> to<00:04:35.090> get<00:04:35.240> in<00:04:35.330> his<00:04:35.419> hatchery
