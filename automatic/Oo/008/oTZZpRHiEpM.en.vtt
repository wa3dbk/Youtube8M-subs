00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
he's seen some YouTube videos where some

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.570 
he's seen some YouTube videos where some
people<00:00:22.170> recommend<00:00:22.740> stretching<00:00:22.980> before<00:00:23.369> you

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
people recommend stretching before you

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.640

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
people recommend stretching after you

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.269 
people recommend stretching after you
workout<00:00:27.330> and<00:00:27.570> he's<00:00:28.289> confused<00:00:28.769> about<00:00:28.920> whether

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
workout and he's confused about whether

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.749 
workout and he's confused about whether
you<00:00:29.490> should<00:00:29.699> stretch<00:00:29.910> before<00:00:29.970> or<00:00:30.570> after<00:00:31.050> and

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:31.759 
you should stretch before or after and

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:34.520 
you should stretch before or after and
the<00:00:32.759> general<00:00:33.239> rule<00:00:33.270> of<00:00:33.570> thumb<00:00:33.780> when<00:00:34.170> it<00:00:34.230> comes

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
the general rule of thumb when it comes

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.830 
the general rule of thumb when it comes
to<00:00:34.860> stretching<00:00:35.309> is<00:00:35.850> that<00:00:36.149> you<00:00:36.239> should<00:00:36.510> never

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
to stretching is that you should never

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.459 
to stretching is that you should never
stretch<00:00:37.440> a<00:00:37.680> cold<00:00:38.190> muscle<00:00:38.899> when<00:00:39.899> you<00:00:40.020> go<00:00:40.200> and

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
stretch a cold muscle when you go and

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.740 
stretch a cold muscle when you go and
stretch<00:00:40.800> a<00:00:41.070> cold<00:00:41.489> muscle<00:00:41.760> you<00:00:42.450> are<00:00:42.480> more

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
stretch a cold muscle you are more

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.020 
stretch a cold muscle you are more
likely<00:00:43.140> to<00:00:43.290> actually<00:00:43.500> pull<00:00:44.010> it<00:00:44.160> or<00:00:44.340> tear<00:00:44.879> it

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
likely to actually pull it or tear it

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.720 
likely to actually pull it or tear it
rather<00:00:45.809> than<00:00:46.110> stretching<00:00:46.620> so<00:00:47.280> you<00:00:47.340> always

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
rather than stretching so you always

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.400 
rather than stretching so you always
want<00:00:47.910> to<00:00:48.000> warm<00:00:48.660> up<00:00:48.840> first

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
want to warm up first

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.590 
want to warm up first
get<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.739> blood<00:00:49.980> flowing<00:00:50.340> get<00:00:50.760> your<00:00:50.940> core

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
get the blood flowing get your core

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.200 
get the blood flowing get your core
temperature<00:00:51.989> elevated<00:00:52.699> get<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:53.850> muscle

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
temperature elevated get the muscle

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.630 
temperature elevated get the muscle
warmed<00:00:54.539> up<00:00:54.690> so<00:00:55.170> that<00:00:55.379> when<00:00:55.590> you<00:00:55.739> do<00:00:55.980> stretch<00:00:56.370> it

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
warmed up so that when you do stretch it

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.760 
warmed up so that when you do stretch it
you're<00:00:57.180> going<00:00:57.420> to<00:00:57.600> more<00:00:58.140> likely<00:00:58.440> stretch

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
you're going to more likely stretch

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.279 
you're going to more likely stretch
rather<00:00:59.219> than<00:00:59.489> tear<00:00:59.840> you<00:01:00.840> can<00:01:00.989> kind<00:01:01.199> of

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
rather than tear you can kind of

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.229 
rather than tear you can kind of
visualize<00:01:01.770> your<00:01:02.010> muscles<00:01:02.399> like<00:01:02.879> a<00:01:02.910> rubber

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
visualize your muscles like a rubber

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.780 
visualize your muscles like a rubber
band<00:01:03.629> I<00:01:04.049> mean<00:01:04.589> if<00:01:04.739> you<00:01:04.830> were<00:01:04.949> to<00:01:05.070> take<00:01:05.280> a<00:01:05.519> rubber

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
band I mean if you were to take a rubber

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.649 
band I mean if you were to take a rubber
band<00:01:06.180> and<00:01:06.619> place<00:01:07.619> it<00:01:08.040> in<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.729> freezer<00:01:09.030> let's

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
band and place it in the freezer let's

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:10.670 
band and place it in the freezer let's
say<00:01:09.780> we're<00:01:09.930> going<00:01:10.020> to<00:01:10.080> just<00:01:10.290> put<00:01:10.439> it<00:01:10.530> in<00:01:10.619> the

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
say we're going to just put it in the

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.620 
say we're going to just put it in the
freezer<00:01:10.890> overnight<00:01:11.340> and<00:01:11.729> then<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.390> next

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
freezer overnight and then the next

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.630 
freezer overnight and then the next
morning<00:01:12.810> you<00:01:13.500> open<00:01:13.920> up<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.070> freezer<00:01:14.220> take<00:01:14.520> out

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
morning you open up the freezer take out

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.490 
morning you open up the freezer take out
the<00:01:14.729> rubber<00:01:14.880> band<00:01:15.119> and<00:01:15.299> you<00:01:15.750> stretch<00:01:16.110> it<00:01:16.140> you

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
the rubber band and you stretch it you

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.100 
the rubber band and you stretch it you
know<00:01:17.159> you<00:01:17.729> probably<00:01:18.090> are<00:01:18.509> going<00:01:18.689> to<00:01:18.750> end<00:01:18.900> up

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
know you probably are going to end up

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.679 
know you probably are going to end up
snapping<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:20.130> rubber<00:01:20.340> band<00:01:20.610> because<00:01:20.880> as<00:01:21.450> it's

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
snapping the rubber band because as it's

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.620 
snapping the rubber band because as it's
cold<00:01:22.320> its<00:01:23.100> contracted<00:01:23.909> and<00:01:24.119> it's<00:01:24.270> not<00:01:24.420> very

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
cold its contracted and it's not very

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.170 
cold its contracted and it's not very
flexible<00:01:25.200> not<00:01:25.409> very<00:01:25.619> pliable<00:01:25.860> your<00:01:26.820> muscles

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
flexible not very pliable your muscles

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.450 
flexible not very pliable your muscles
are<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.420> same<00:01:27.630> way<00:01:27.869> if<00:01:28.200> you<00:01:28.380> try<00:01:28.710> and<00:01:28.920> stretch

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
are the same way if you try and stretch

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.060 
are the same way if you try and stretch
a<00:01:29.700> cold<00:01:30.060> muscle<00:01:30.509> you're<00:01:30.840> more<00:01:31.079> likely<00:01:31.290> to<00:01:31.470> tear

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
a cold muscle you're more likely to tear

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.280 
a cold muscle you're more likely to tear
them<00:01:32.340> rather<00:01:33.119> than<00:01:33.390> stretch<00:01:33.750> them<00:01:33.990> so<00:01:34.200> you

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
them rather than stretch them so you

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.710 
them rather than stretch them so you
always<00:01:34.500> want<00:01:34.799> to<00:01:34.890> warm<00:01:35.070> up<00:01:35.189> first<00:01:35.490> now<00:01:36.390> as<00:01:36.540> far

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
always want to warm up first now as far

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.870 
always want to warm up first now as far
as<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:36.960> warm-up<00:01:37.290> is<00:01:37.320> concerned<00:01:37.820> there's<00:01:38.820> a

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
as the warm-up is concerned there's a

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.520 
as the warm-up is concerned there's a
lot<00:01:39.119> of<00:01:39.270> things<00:01:39.450> you<00:01:39.600> can<00:01:39.750> do<00:01:39.869> I<00:01:40.079> mean<00:01:40.229> when<00:01:40.439> it

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
lot of things you can do I mean when it

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.190 
lot of things you can do I mean when it
comes<00:01:40.560> to<00:01:40.920> a<00:01:41.220> workout<00:01:41.820> what<00:01:42.270> I<00:01:42.299> recommend<00:01:42.869> is

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
comes to a workout what I recommend is

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.050 
comes to a workout what I recommend is
starting<00:01:43.920> off<00:01:44.070> with<00:01:44.310> just<00:01:44.579> some<00:01:44.729> general

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
starting off with just some general

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.990 
starting off with just some general
cardio<00:01:45.740> something<00:01:46.740> like<00:01:47.009> the<00:01:47.399> rowing<00:01:47.880> machine

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
cardio something like the rowing machine

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.389 
cardio something like the rowing machine
or<00:01:48.540> maybe<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:49.079> the<00:01:49.409> elliptical<00:01:49.890> machine<00:01:50.009> with

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
or maybe the the elliptical machine with

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.670 
or maybe the the elliptical machine with
the<00:01:50.490> moving<00:01:50.820> handles<00:01:51.380> preferably<00:01:52.380> something

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
the moving handles preferably something

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.560 
the moving handles preferably something
that's<00:01:53.040> going<00:01:53.250> to<00:01:53.369> move<00:01:53.579> your<00:01:53.909> entire<00:01:54.030> body

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
that's going to move your entire body

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
- to get their core temperature elevated

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.540 
- to get their core temperature elevated
and<00:03:43.150> to<00:03:43.570> work<00:03:43.720> up<00:03:43.900> a<00:03:43.930> sweat<00:03:44.100> then<00:03:45.100> we<00:03:45.250> would<00:03:45.400> do

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:45.550 
and to work up a sweat then we would do

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:49.440 
and to work up a sweat then we would do
some<00:03:45.959> mobility<00:03:46.959> exercises<00:03:47.940> followed<00:03:48.940> by<00:03:49.150> our

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
some mobility exercises followed by our

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:52.020 
some mobility exercises followed by our
stretching<00:03:49.959> so<00:03:50.800> we<00:03:51.100> get<00:03:51.310> the<00:03:51.430> stretching<00:03:51.880> done

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
stretching so we get the stretching done

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:56.270 
stretching so we get the stretching done
fairly<00:03:52.510> early<00:03:52.720> in<00:03:53.170> our<00:03:53.970> workouts<00:03:54.970> in<00:03:55.209> order<00:03:56.080> to

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:13.270 
doing that day you'd want to get the

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:14.940 
doing that day you'd want to get the
stretching<00:04:13.630> done<00:04:13.780> beforehand<00:04:14.410> before<00:04:14.650> you

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:14.950 
stretching done beforehand before you

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:17.640 
stretching done beforehand before you
get<00:04:15.130> into<00:04:15.400> the<00:04:15.520> explosive<00:04:16.470> punching<00:04:17.470> kicking

get into the explosive punching kicking

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:20.940 
get into the explosive punching kicking
and<00:04:18.190> all<00:04:18.459> that<00:04:18.640> kind<00:04:18.820> of<00:04:18.850> stuff<00:04:19.350> so<00:04:20.350> it's<00:04:20.799> a

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:20.950 
and all that kind of stuff so it's a

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:23.250 
and all that kind of stuff so it's a
change<00:04:21.340> of<00:04:21.520> order<00:04:21.880> because<00:04:22.360> it's<00:04:22.780> a<00:04:22.870> different

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:23.260 
change of order because it's a different

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.560 
change of order because it's a different
sport<00:04:23.380> different<00:04:23.919> application<00:04:24.520> so<00:04:25.270> how<00:04:25.510> do

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.570 
sport different application so how do

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:26.140 
sport different application so how do
you<00:04:25.690> go<00:04:25.810> about

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.150 
you go about

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:28.240 
you go about
the<00:04:26.449> actual<00:04:26.810> order<00:04:27.199> is<00:04:27.350> it's<00:04:27.710> going<00:04:27.889> to<00:04:28.009> vary

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:28.250 
the actual order is it's going to vary

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:29.550 
the actual order is it's going to vary
depending<00:04:28.370> on<00:04:28.759> whatever<00:04:28.940> it<00:04:29.150> is<00:04:29.270> you're<00:04:29.419> doing

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560 
depending on whatever it is you're doing

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.800 
depending on whatever it is you're doing
but<00:04:30.560> the<00:04:30.919> general<00:04:31.370> rule<00:04:31.580> of<00:04:31.610> never<00:04:32.210> stretching

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:32.810 
but the general rule of never stretching

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:35.379 
but the general rule of never stretching
a<00:04:32.900> cold<00:04:33.169> muscle<00:04:33.520> applies<00:04:34.520> across<00:04:34.850> the<00:04:34.970> board

00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:35.389 
a cold muscle applies across the board

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:38.290 
a cold muscle applies across the board
you<00:04:35.810> always<00:04:36.259> need<00:04:36.440> to<00:04:36.470> warm<00:04:36.979> up<00:04:37.160> first<00:04:37.460> before

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:38.300 
you always need to warm up first before

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:41.680 
you always need to warm up first before
you<00:04:38.750> stretch<00:04:39.250> stretching<00:04:40.250> is<00:04:40.430> not<00:04:40.940> a<00:04:41.240> warm-up

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:41.690 
you stretch stretching is not a warm-up

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:43.960 
you stretch stretching is not a warm-up
again<00:04:42.380> think<00:04:42.650> of<00:04:42.710> that<00:04:42.860> rubber<00:04:43.100> band<00:04:43.370> analogy

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:43.970 
again think of that rubber band analogy

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:45.909 
again think of that rubber band analogy
you<00:04:44.150> stride<00:04:44.509> stretch<00:04:44.900> a<00:04:44.930> cold<00:04:45.259> rubber<00:04:45.500> band

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:45.919 
you stride stretch a cold rubber band

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:48.430 
you stride stretch a cold rubber band
it<00:04:45.979> ain't<00:04:46.250> stretching<00:04:46.789> it's<00:04:46.970> snapping<00:04:47.870> you

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:48.440 
it ain't stretching it's snapping you

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:49.540 
it ain't stretching it's snapping you
don't<00:04:48.620> want<00:04:48.770> that<00:04:48.919> happening<00:04:49.310> to<00:04:49.430> your

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:49.550 
don't want that happening to your

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:51.340 
don't want that happening to your
muscles<00:04:49.910> you<00:04:50.509> try<00:04:50.750> and<00:04:50.870> stretch<00:04:51.050> a<00:04:51.080> cold

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:51.350 
muscles you try and stretch a cold

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:53.439 
muscles you try and stretch a cold
muscle<00:04:51.530> they're<00:04:52.280> not<00:04:52.490> stretching<00:04:52.850> they're

00:04:53.439 --> 00:04:53.449 
muscle they're not stretching they're

00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:55.060 
muscle they're not stretching they're
going<00:04:53.750> to<00:04:53.900> tear<00:04:54.139> they're<00:04:54.410> going<00:04:54.560> to<00:04:54.650> pull<00:04:54.860> or

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:56.660 
you're just gonna strain them you don't

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:57.430 
you're just gonna strain them you don't
want<00:04:56.870> that<00:04:56.990> to<00:04:57.050> happen
