I<00:01:57.990> think<00:01:58.200> one<00:01:58.380> of<00:01:58.409> the<00:01:58.560> things<00:01:58.590> that<00:01:59.090> would

benefit<00:02:00.570> people<00:02:01.170> greatly<00:02:01.920> is<00:02:02.340> if<00:02:02.549> we<00:02:02.909> bring

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
benefit people greatly is if we bring

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.230 
benefit people greatly is if we bring
some<00:02:03.990> attention<00:02:04.079> to<00:02:04.680> the<00:02:04.799> fact<00:02:05.009> that<00:02:05.189> we<00:02:05.880> have

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:36.090 
going to let go of whatever is bothering
that<00:04:33.940> might<00:04:34.120> be<00:04:34.300> something<00:04:34.600> beneficial<00:04:35.100> I

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:36.100 
that might be something beneficial I

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:39.510 
that might be something beneficial I
think<00:04:36.640> setting<00:04:37.030> an<00:04:37.150> intention<00:04:37.270> is<00:04:38.110> a<00:04:38.620> great

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520 
think setting an intention is a great

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.409 
think setting an intention is a great
way<00:04:39.760> to<00:04:39.820> go<00:04:40.090> because<00:04:41.640> instead<00:04:42.640> of<00:04:42.700> coming<00:04:43.300> in

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:43.419 
way to go because instead of coming in

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:45.240 
way to go because instead of coming in
and<00:04:43.479> just<00:04:43.840> being<00:04:44.110> fearful<00:04:44.530> of<00:04:44.919> trying

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:45.250 
and just being fearful of trying

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:47.879 
and just being fearful of trying
something<00:04:45.580> new<00:04:45.760> the<00:04:46.389> first<00:04:46.630> time<00:04:46.960> come<00:04:47.710> in
