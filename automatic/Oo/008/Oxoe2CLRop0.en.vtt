00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.280 
it happens really nice on the bracelet
I'm<00:02:05.880> when<00:02:06.119> I<00:02:06.149> first<00:02:06.420> saw<00:02:06.630> this<00:02:06.840> bracelet

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
I'm when I first saw this bracelet

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.050 
I'm when I first saw this bracelet
several<00:02:07.590> years<00:02:07.740> ago<00:02:08.039> I<00:02:08.250> was<00:02:08.580> very<00:02:08.759> attracted

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
several years ago I was very attracted

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.029 
several years ago I was very attracted
to<00:02:09.390> it<00:02:09.569> because<00:02:09.780> I<00:02:09.810> like<00:02:10.080> the<00:02:10.200> simplicity<00:02:10.410> I

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
to it because I like the simplicity I

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.080 
to it because I like the simplicity I
liked<00:02:11.459> the<00:02:11.580> angularity

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
liked the angularity

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:14.790 
liked the angularity
I<00:02:13.150> think<00:02:13.750> that<00:02:13.870> this<00:02:14.019> was<00:02:14.170> a<00:02:14.200> very<00:02:14.410> clever

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
I think that this was a very clever

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.619 
I think that this was a very clever
design<00:02:15.069> for<00:02:16.060> Panerai

00:02:16.619 --> 00:02:16.629 
design for Panerai

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:19.020 
design for Panerai
and<00:02:17.410> it's<00:02:17.620> bracelets<00:02:18.129> and<00:02:18.250> and<00:02:18.519> again<00:02:18.910> this

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
and it's bracelets and and again this

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.690 
and it's bracelets and and again this
this<00:02:19.269> this<00:02:19.629> bracelet<00:02:20.080> style<00:02:20.519> continues<00:02:21.519> and<00:02:21.670> I

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
this this bracelet style continues and I

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:22.920 
this this bracelet style continues and I
think<00:02:21.910> it's<00:02:22.030> available<00:02:22.480> in<00:02:22.540> a<00:02:22.599> few<00:02:22.750> other

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
think it's available in a few other

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.900 
think it's available in a few other
watches<00:02:23.319> but<00:02:23.800> this<00:02:23.920> one<00:02:24.069> particular<00:02:24.190> is<00:02:24.730> good

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
watches but this one particular is good

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.170 
watches but this one particular is good
so<00:02:25.090> again<00:02:25.330> as<00:02:25.510> this<00:02:26.200> sort<00:02:26.410> of<00:02:26.530> Panerai<00:02:27.180> lumen

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
so again as this sort of Panerai lumen

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.160 
so again as this sort of Panerai lumen
or<00:02:28.269> marina<00:02:28.629> you<00:02:29.319> have<00:02:29.590> that<00:02:29.860> sandwich<00:02:30.250> dial

here a relatively simple system for
releasing<00:03:23.230> the<00:03:24.130> bracelets<00:03:25.290> so<00:03:26.290> I'm<00:03:26.530> not

of<00:03:44.530> wear<00:03:44.859> all<00:03:45.639> different<00:03:46.060> types<00:03:46.209> of<00:03:46.359> straps

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:46.660 
of wear all different types of straps

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.839 
of wear all different types of straps
and<00:03:46.959> in<00:03:47.109> this<00:03:47.290> sort<00:03:47.440> of<00:03:47.530> case<00:03:47.739> design<00:03:48.160> tends<00:03:48.700> to

00:03:48.839 --> 00:03:48.849 
and in this sort of case design tends to

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:50.699 
and in this sort of case design tends to
look<00:03:48.970> good<00:03:49.239> with<00:03:49.720> a<00:03:49.930> lot<00:03:50.139> of<00:03:50.169> them<00:03:50.410> there

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
look good with a lot of them there

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:51.930 
look good with a lot of them there
really<00:03:50.859> isn't<00:03:51.069> too<00:03:51.250> much<00:03:51.400> more<00:03:51.579> to<00:03:51.669> say<00:03:51.910> about

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
really isn't too much more to say about

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:53.610 
really isn't too much more to say about
this<00:03:52.419> and<00:03:52.630> that<00:03:52.750> you<00:03:52.930> know<00:03:52.959> other<00:03:53.230> than<00:03:53.440> this

this and that you know other than this

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.530 
this and that you know other than this
is<00:03:53.799> you<00:03:53.980> know<00:03:54.069> this<00:03:54.459> is<00:03:54.639> a<00:03:54.669> big<00:03:54.940> chunky<00:03:55.389> watch

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540 
is you know this is a big chunky watch

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:57.030 
is you know this is a big chunky watch
this<00:03:55.810> isn't<00:03:56.079> the<00:03:56.139> type<00:03:56.319> of<00:03:56.349> thing<00:03:56.530> I'd<00:03:56.739> want<00:03:56.950> to

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
this isn't the type of thing I'd want to

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.159 
this isn't the type of thing I'd want to

sort<00:04:07.419> of<00:04:07.510> complain<00:04:07.900> sometimes<00:04:08.380> that<00:04:08.620> Panerai

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:08.980 
sort of complain sometimes that Panerai

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:10.890 
sort of complain sometimes that Panerai
tends<00:04:09.370> to<00:04:09.519> regurgitate<00:04:09.819> designs<00:04:10.450> a<00:04:10.599> lot<00:04:10.750> which

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:10.900 
tends to regurgitate designs a lot which

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:12.390 
tends to regurgitate designs a lot which
is<00:04:11.019> true<00:04:11.260> and<00:04:11.290> Panerai<00:04:11.769> will<00:04:11.889> be<00:04:11.950> the<00:04:12.040> first<00:04:12.250> to

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 
is true and Panerai will be the first to

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:12.890 
is true and Panerai will be the first to
admit<00:04:12.489> it

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
admit it

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.240 
admit it
but<00:04:13.900> what<00:04:14.079> I<00:04:14.109> like<00:04:14.380> here<00:04:14.620> is<00:04:14.709> this<00:04:14.829> is<00:04:14.950> a<00:04:14.980> very

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250 
but what I like here is this is a very

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:17.789 
but what I like here is this is a very
core<00:04:15.849> look<00:04:16.510> for<00:04:16.989> Panerai<00:04:17.470> and<00:04:17.560> I<00:04:17.590> think

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:17.799 
core look for Panerai and I think

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:19.440 
core look for Panerai and I think
there's<00:04:17.950> there's<00:04:18.220> a<00:04:18.340> there's<00:04:18.430> a<00:04:18.700> combination

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:19.450 
there's there's a there's a combination

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:21.420 
there's there's a there's a combination
of<00:04:19.599> features<00:04:20.109> here<00:04:20.560> that<00:04:20.590> is<00:04:20.859> very<00:04:21.099> attractive

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:21.430 
of features here that is very attractive

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:23.520 
of features here that is very attractive
is<00:04:21.909> this<00:04:22.330> the<00:04:22.450> most<00:04:22.630> minimalist<00:04:23.200> style<00:04:23.260> they

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.530 
is this the most minimalist style they

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:25.230 
is this the most minimalist style they
make<00:04:23.710> no<00:04:23.979> but<00:04:24.490> they<00:04:24.580> definitely<00:04:24.700> make<00:04:25.060> more

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240 
make no but they definitely make more

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.310 
make no but they definitely make more
complicated<00:04:25.539> dials

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.320 
complicated dials

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:28.800 
complicated dials
think<00:04:26.500> ruin<00:04:27.280> some<00:04:27.640> of<00:04:27.760> the<00:04:27.880> balance<00:04:28.600> and

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 
think ruin some of the balance and

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:31.410 
think ruin some of the balance and
appeal<00:04:29.230> of<00:04:29.920> why<00:04:30.250> people<00:04:30.670> like<00:04:30.850> pan<00:04:31.150> are<00:04:31.300> you

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:31.420 
appeal of why people like pan are you

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:33.120 
appeal of why people like pan are you
know<00:04:31.510> that<00:04:31.660> that<00:04:32.020> sub-series<00:04:32.440> seconds<00:04:32.950> close

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.130 
know that that sub-series seconds close

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:33.990 
know that that sub-series seconds close
to<00:04:33.250> nine<00:04:33.430> o'clock

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000 
to nine o'clock

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.540 
to nine o'clock
that's<00:04:34.300> very<00:04:34.510> iconic<00:04:34.960> for<00:04:35.230> them<00:04:35.400> and<00:04:36.400> the

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:36.550 
that's very iconic for them and the

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:38.040 
that's very iconic for them and the
addition<00:04:36.850> the<00:04:37.000> day<00:04:37.150> just<00:04:37.360> makes<00:04:37.600> it<00:04:37.690> a<00:04:37.840> little

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.050 
addition the day just makes it a little

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:39.690 
addition the day just makes it a little
bit<00:04:38.230> more<00:04:38.650> convenient<00:04:39.070> so<00:04:39.250> I<00:04:39.280> think<00:04:39.370> the<00:04:39.550> P

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:39.700 
bit more convenient so I think the P

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:41.880 
bit more convenient so I think the P
9000<00:04:40.300> movement<00:04:40.630> is<00:04:40.720> a<00:04:40.780> great<00:04:41.350> based<00:04:41.590> movement

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:41.890 
9000 movement is a great based movement

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:44.550 
9000 movement is a great based movement
for<00:04:42.160> any<00:04:42.250> pan<00:04:42.490> or<00:04:42.670> eye<00:04:42.700> and<00:04:43.660> I<00:04:43.900> think<00:04:44.170> that<00:04:44.320> in

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560 
for any pan or eye and I think that in

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:48.530 
for any pan or eye and I think that in
this<00:04:44.800> in<00:04:45.010> the<00:04:45.670> in<00:04:45.910> the<00:04:46.330> nineteen<00:04:46.690> fifty<00:04:47.140> case

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:48.540 
this in the in the nineteen fifty case

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:50.640 
this in the in the nineteen fifty case
you<00:04:49.540> really<00:04:49.840> can't<00:04:50.080> get<00:04:50.200> much<00:04:50.260> better<00:04:50.380> than

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:50.650 
you really can't get much better than

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:52.980 
you really can't get much better than
this<00:04:50.830> type<00:04:51.130> of<00:04:51.160> combination<00:04:52.090> with<00:04:52.600> this<00:04:52.750> dial

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:52.990 
this type of combination with this dial

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:55.200 
this type of combination with this dial
once<00:04:53.260> they<00:04:53.380> take<00:04:53.560> the<00:04:53.680> 1950<00:04:54.190> KS<00:04:54.430> and<00:04:54.640> they<00:04:55.030> put

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:55.210 
once they take the 1950 KS and they put

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:57.180 
once they take the 1950 KS and they put
other<00:04:55.300> complications<00:04:56.110> in<00:04:56.290> there<00:04:56.470> I<00:04:56.650> think<00:04:57.100> it

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:57.190 
other complications in there I think it

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:58.800 
other complications in there I think it
kind<00:04:57.370> of<00:04:57.460> ruins<00:04:57.880> some<00:04:58.090> of<00:04:58.180> the<00:04:58.270> balance<00:04:58.690> at

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:58.810 
kind of ruins some of the balance at

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:01.020 
kind of ruins some of the balance at
least<00:04:58.960> in<00:04:59.110> my<00:04:59.230> opinion<00:04:59.350> so<00:04:59.680> for<00:04:59.890> me<00:05:00.040> this<00:05:00.700> kind

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:01.030 
least in my opinion so for me this kind

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:03.780 
least in my opinion so for me this kind
of<00:05:01.150> essential<00:05:02.080> pan<00:05:02.500> or<00:05:02.680> I<00:05:02.800> look<00:05:03.100> on<00:05:03.340> the
