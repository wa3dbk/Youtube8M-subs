 at the 15th but I really like the round back and I really like the hand 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:24.710
 group therapy 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.390
 and the people who live in pennies are very friendly remains that 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:30.060

 she in the chapel at safed and her first year of this trade and 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.040
 of industry but I'm going to start a little bit a few courses like in a 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.080
 other place that were overwhelming is about women 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:04.730
 when did you want to be a lean summer teacher pts to 3 of 6 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:06.740
 she is ready to face 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.579
 backs fade both because in fact it's to be able to learn the 

00:01:09.579 --> 00:01:12.200
 piano I started giving stuff that I had already taken foot in 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.330
 telefoot to continue my studies that an object of nelly and especially that 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.260

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.430
 adults are asking themselves a lot of questions arise a lot of 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.329
 c but sion and then to lead the respondent 

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:39.760

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.540
 but they need everyone turning really hard right off the bat 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.740
 while children are born from the margins of both linguistic groups at the 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:46.920

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.710
 so you have to think about following 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.360
 things composed of 10 episodes why
