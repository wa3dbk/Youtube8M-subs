00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.620
 hello and welcome to hardware rat in 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.629
 this video the technology news 

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:09.660
 calendar week 30 2013 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:12.210
 battlefield 4 is now officially directx 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.089
 11.1 support currently exists 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.269
 no graphics cards the directx 11.1 

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:18.300
 support 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.160
 but at the end of 2013 there will be the a rating 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.310
 9000 series that support this 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.990
 should directx 11.1 should be graphics 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.630
 technically very little bring it 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.490
 just be relieving that means 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.960
 some tasks were previously performed by the processor 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.969
 is now made by the 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.530
 video card what I took then 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.510
 However, if that's more of a question 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.559
 Disadvantage for people is the one good 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.800
 have processor 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.960
 Google has a hdmi stick for 35 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.940
 dollars presented this is called 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.829
 cromcast and with the chambers 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.500
 different contents of smartphones and 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.030
 to stream tablets on the tv 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.739
 can then be with his example 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.780
 put the smartphone on the sofa 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.610
 Start youtube app and youtube 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.289
 simply videos on the chrome casters 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.989
 this ends with the television 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.239
 but the cromcast also gives you two 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.390
 Android devices together 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:05.189
 synchronize 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.380
 that means when two tablets 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.090
 simultaneously connected to the cromcast 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.280
 are there and opened one 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.409
 youtube video then the cromcast you can 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.570
 Make you like that youtube video 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.700
 also open on the second tablet 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.430
 it will be powered by chrome 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.619
 caster over usb that means you 're stuck 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.590
 the usb cable either a usb port 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.420
 the TV or to the power supply to 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.000
 I think that's a great idea of 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:33.000
 Google and 35 US dollars are more than 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.299
 Cheap Samsung is slowly starting to get new ones 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.640
 lp ddr3 memory modules to manufacture the 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:41.720
 Use six small chips and set to 3 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.970
 gb memory with a bandwidth of 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:47.040
 2133 megabit that means that means 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.829
 the upcoming smartphone generation will take place 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.829
 2 are equipped with 3 gb RAM 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:55.259
 the first smartphones with 3 gb are supposed to 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:57.509
 already in the second half of 2013 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:59.969
 but seems likely is 3 gb 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.979
 for most of you and for being me 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.150
 many do not even think a gigabyte 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.160
 get full 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:06.900
 now also the new nexus 7 of 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:09.119
 google presented the most exciting 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.280
 but the tablet the screen is 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:14.940
 just like the name says 7 inches tall and 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:18.030
 has a resolution of 1920 x 1200 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:21.420
 pixeln so full hd that is in the end 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:23.850
 then a pixel density of 323 pixels per 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.430
 in. otherwise there is no great innovation 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:30.720
 before that it had a quad-core with 1 2 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:34.440
 ghz now a quad comes with 1 5 ghz 1 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:37.860
 gb ram 2 gb ram has the smallest model 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.580
 16 gb the two largest models 32 gb 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.380
 Storage 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.510
 the two cheaper models have no 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:45.240
 mobile internet has only the biggest 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.070
 mobile internet and also new lte and 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.600
 besides, this is on the back this time 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:50.370
 also a camera with it 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.770
 the prices should be pretty 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:56.040
 the small model 200 remains the same 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:58.470
 euro the slightly larger 250 and that 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.780
 model with mobile internet 300 euro 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:03.360
 So it got a sharp point as expected 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:06.150
 price performance ratio have intel 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:09.030
 chipsets for 11 50 get a new one 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:11.220
 had stepping the previous c1 tapping 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.230
 yes a serious mistake and indeed 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:15.570
 that we have the pc in standby mode 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.730
 turns and then wakes up that 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:19.230
 you then know the usb-3 devices new 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.269
 you do not have to find it that way 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:23.519
 but I do not do any serious work either 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:25.380
 website hype the shit intel sandy 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:27.330
 bridge chipsets have namely to 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.910
 release a much more serious one 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:31.800
 error and that were the sata ports 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:33.870
 meter time becomes weaker but very much 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:36.450
 puts a lot of emphasis on that his usb3 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:38.130
 ports during uncover the standby mode 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:40.019
 not be recognized every time 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:42.650
 should have on the mainboard choice 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:45.269
 pay attention to the c2 stepping in any case 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:47.340
 at intel it should be in the desktop area 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:49.530
 next year no significant new 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:52.080
 give architecture but just 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.489
 newly launched hessel processors in the 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.600
 notebook area should be but one 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:56.519
 to be a little bit different 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:59.420
 there are supposed to be in the second 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:01.799
 half of 2014 already the first bread 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:03.780
 Processors in a 14 nanometer process 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:05.640
 Of course this can appear for one thing 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:08.010
 because of that intel what do good 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:09.750
 wants and a technology before 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:11.970
 or simply because they want to bring 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:12.510
 especially the jaguar architecture 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:14.609
 to have 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.960
 that was it again with technology 

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:17.610
 news for this week 

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:19.230
 if the video you like has 

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:21.030
 a thumbs up if you have a question 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:23.010
 you wrote in the comments 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:25.370
 then I would say until the next 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:25.370
 Video
