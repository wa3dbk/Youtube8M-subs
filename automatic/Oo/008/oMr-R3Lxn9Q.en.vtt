samsung galaxy fit which is reached
recently<00:00:08.160> of<00:00:08.790> course<00:00:08.849> let<00:00:09.420> us<00:00:09.540> see<00:00:09.719> the<00:00:09.870> device

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
recently of course let us see the device

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.290 
recently of course let us see the device
the<00:00:10.980> device<00:00:11.099> holds<00:00:11.610> a<00:00:11.670> three-point<00:00:12.059> range

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
resolution of 240 into 300 that is not

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.670 
resolution of 240 into 300 that is not
that<00:00:18.720> good<00:00:19.350> actually<00:00:19.920> and<00:00:20.490> the<00:00:21.420> back<00:00:21.660> it<00:00:22.410> has<00:00:22.439> a

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
that good actually and the back it has a

that good actually and the back it has a
5<00:00:23.010> megapixel<00:00:23.160> camera<00:00:24.029> and<00:00:24.119> that's<00:00:24.539> it<00:00:24.720> there

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
5 megapixel camera and that's it there

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.890 
5 megapixel camera and that's it there
is<00:00:25.080> no<00:00:25.230> flash<00:00:25.500> and<00:00:25.830> the<00:00:26.400> back<00:00:26.580> cover<00:00:26.880> is<00:00:27.210> how

the<00:00:28.560> back<00:00:28.740> cover<00:00:28.980> has<00:00:29.189> some<00:00:29.460> texture<00:00:29.939> which

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
the back cover has some texture which

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.959 
the back cover has some texture which
looks<00:00:30.510> good<00:00:30.810> and<00:00:31.019> it<00:00:31.800> is<00:00:31.949> not<00:00:32.160> like<00:00:32.430> it<00:00:32.460> is<00:00:32.759> not

looks good and it is not like it is not

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.630 
looks good and it is not like it is not
slippery<00:00:33.360> so<00:00:33.660> that<00:00:33.840> you<00:00:33.960> could<00:00:34.140> be<00:00:34.710> easily

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
slippery so that you could be easily

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.869 
slippery so that you could be easily
hold<00:00:36.120> it<00:00:36.300> and<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:37.110> only<00:00:37.739> main<00:00:38.100> concern<00:00:38.610> that

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
hold it and the only main concern that

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.060 
hold it and the only main concern that
we<00:00:39.059> have<00:00:39.300> here<00:00:39.660> with<00:00:40.230> the<00:00:40.350> mobile<00:00:40.500> phone<00:00:40.890> is

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
we have here with the mobile phone is

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.549 
we have here with the mobile phone is
that<00:00:41.370> it's<00:00:41.550> a<00:00:41.760> fingerprint<00:00:42.329> magnet<00:00:42.570> from<00:00:43.379> the

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
that it's a fingerprint magnet from the

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:51.529 
that it's a fingerprint magnet from the
front<00:00:43.800> side<00:00:43.890> and<00:00:49.219> later<00:00:50.219> on<00:00:50.399> like<00:00:50.640> Adam<00:00:51.149> back

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
front side and later on like Adam back

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.869 
front side and later on like Adam back
from<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:51.930> back<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.350> mobile<00:00:52.710> feels<00:00:53.340> very<00:00:53.640> good

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
can have up to seven home screens and

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.330 
can have up to seven home screens and
you<00:01:12.299> can<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:13.080> pinch<00:01:13.320> to<00:01:13.530> zoom<00:01:13.560> works<00:01:13.979> very

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
you can the pinch to zoom works very

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.480 
you can the pinch to zoom works very
well<00:01:14.630> of<00:01:15.630> course<00:01:15.990> I<00:01:16.080> only<00:01:16.320> use<00:01:16.530> to<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:17.070> two

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
well of course I only use to the two

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.289 
well of course I only use to the two
home<00:01:17.700> screens<00:01:18.060> here<00:01:18.299> right<00:01:19.049> now<00:01:19.290> and<00:01:20.150> this<00:01:21.150> is

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
home screens here right now and this is

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.890 
home screens here right now and this is
a<00:01:21.330> very<00:01:21.689> mid-range<00:01:22.259> device<00:01:23.479> of<00:01:24.479> course<00:01:24.780> the

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
a very mid-range device of course the

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.050 
a very mid-range device of course the
camera<00:01:25.200> is<00:01:25.380> a<00:01:25.409> 5<00:01:25.650> megapixel<00:01:25.770> camera<00:01:26.580> which<00:01:26.880> is

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
camera is a 5 megapixel camera which is

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.770 
camera is a 5 megapixel camera which is
very<00:01:27.270> good<00:01:27.509> to<00:01:28.080> a<00:01:28.110> mid-range<00:01:28.560> device<00:01:28.770> and

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
very good to a mid-range device and

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.630 
very good to a mid-range device and
right<00:01:30.780> now<00:01:30.990> I<00:01:31.020> want<00:01:31.380> to<00:01:31.470> do<00:01:31.680> some<00:01:31.890> benchmark

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
right now I want to do some benchmark

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.149 
right now I want to do some benchmark
testing<00:01:33.060> so<00:01:33.390> that<00:01:33.570> you<00:01:33.689> could<00:01:33.900> know<00:01:34.409> what<00:01:34.710> the

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
testing so that you could know what the

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:40.569 
testing so that you could know what the
device<00:01:35.430> holds<00:01:37.880> ok<00:01:38.880> let's<00:01:39.270> go<00:01:39.509> with<00:01:39.840> a

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:40.579 
device holds ok let's go with a

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:43.700 
device holds ok let's go with a
benchmarking<00:01:41.579> of<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:42.030> Leo<00:01:42.450> poor<00:01:42.750> and<00:01:43.020> let's

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
benchmarking of the Leo poor and let's

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.130 
benchmarking of the Leo poor and let's
see<00:01:43.890> how<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.130> processor<00:01:44.729> does<00:01:44.970> it<00:01:45.180> the

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
see how the processor does it the

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.920 
see how the processor does it the
processor<00:01:46.619> is<00:01:46.649> a<00:01:46.829> 600<00:01:47.369> megahertz<00:01:48.149> Qualcomm

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
processor is a 600 megahertz Qualcomm

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:55.889 
processor is a 600 megahertz Qualcomm
processor<00:01:51.049> it<00:01:52.049> has<00:01:52.079> a<00:01:52.320> 256mb<00:01:53.189> of<00:01:53.369> RAM

00:01:55.889 --> 00:01:55.899 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:02:39.660 

let's<00:01:56.899> see<00:01:57.079> the<00:01:57.229> frameworks

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.360 

Wow<00:02:40.670> the<00:02:41.180> device<00:02:41.480> does<00:02:41.840> a<00:02:41.870> very<00:02:42.230> good<00:02:42.680> job<00:02:42.890> and

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
Wow the device does a very good job and

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.320 
Wow the device does a very good job and
it<00:02:43.550> has<00:02:44.140> 45.2<00:02:45.140> FPS<00:02:46.040> which<00:02:46.670> is<00:02:46.819> more<00:02:47.060> than<00:02:47.270> the

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330 
it has 45.2 FPS which is more than the

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.840 
it has 45.2 FPS which is more than the

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:46.070 
phones but the only main concern is the

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:48.460 
phones but the only main concern is the
screen<00:06:46.370> which<00:06:47.300> is<00:06:47.330> not<00:06:47.600> actually<00:06:47.840> the<00:06:48.140> as

clarity<00:06:49.430> as<00:06:49.550> other<00:06:49.730> screens<00:06:50.180> because<00:06:50.450> it<00:06:50.750> has

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:50.930 
clarity as other screens because it has

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:55.510 
clarity as other screens because it has
only<00:06:51.110> resolution<00:06:51.500> of<00:06:51.919> 302<00:06:52.520> 240<00:06:53.000> ok<00:06:53.810> and<00:06:54.280> if<00:06:55.280> you
