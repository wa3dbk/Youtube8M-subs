00:00:00.769 --> 00:00:03.000
 hello today we will talk about how 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.410
 overclock the central process 

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:06.790
 when overclocking the central 

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:08.179
 processor environment 

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:11.179
 determine which one 

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:15.449
 I'll take advantage of it 

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:18.449
 can download the dry law website 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:23.759
 readers 

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:27.149
 she manages 

00:00:27.149 --> 00:00:30.149
 which process model 

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.070
 clock frequency 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.070
 now wall events 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:43.710
 besides years 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.710
 view information 

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:55.520
 when we collected 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.520
 information processes 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:06.790
 in the connector statistics of divorce 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.830
 we are interested in London 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
 in this case 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.240
 and see the statistics 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.310
 thereby we will find out 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:31.730
 indicative 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:34.730
 we carry 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.710
 after we figured out 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.340
 unload the computer 

00:02:17.889 --> 00:02:20.889
 push a button 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:24.319
 beat man walked 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:27.319
 in which purity is created 

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:40.729
 our social 

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:42.269
 system bus frequency 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:43.479
 as marketing 

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:45.779
 most processor models 

00:02:45.779 --> 00:02:48.779
 locked away 

00:03:01.279 --> 00:03:03.669
 thereby he 

00:03:03.669 --> 00:03:06.669
 CPU frequency 

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:11.409
 i.e. processor frequency 

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:14.409
 system bus frequency 

00:03:16.899 --> 00:03:19.899
 for system stability 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:23.229
 slightly increase the voltage 

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:26.229
 the processor 

00:03:32.469 --> 00:03:35.469
 as it leads 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:39.299
 respectively processes 

00:03:41.779 --> 00:03:43.629
 Besides 

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:46.629
 no shortens the term 

00:03:51.339 --> 00:03:54.339
 in this case 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:23.859
 but traces and services 

00:04:49.819 --> 00:04:52.219
 will increase 

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:55.219
 traces are the same 

00:05:45.999 --> 00:05:48.999
 note that donkey 

00:05:58.779 --> 00:05:59.939
 for the most effective
