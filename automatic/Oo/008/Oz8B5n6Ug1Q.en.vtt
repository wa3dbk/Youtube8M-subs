things<00:03:40.870> pop<00:03:41.200> and<00:03:42.070> I<00:03:42.430> am<00:03:42.610> going<00:03:42.910> to<00:03:42.970> put<00:03:43.180> this

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:43.360 
things pop and I am going to put this

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:46.950 
things pop and I am going to put this
tank<00:03:43.720> into<00:03:44.050> the<00:03:44.250> electronics<00:03:45.330> this<00:03:46.330> gas<00:03:46.600> tank

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:46.960 
tank into the electronics this gas tank

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:48.740 
tank into the electronics this gas tank
I'm<00:03:47.200> going<00:03:47.410> to<00:03:47.500> put<00:03:47.650> it<00:03:47.740> in<00:03:47.890> the<00:03:48.040> electrolyte

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
I'm going to put it in the electrolyte

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:57.930 
I'm going to put it in the electrolyte
so<00:03:49.750> I<00:03:50.050> probably<00:03:50.980> did<00:03:51.310> will<00:03:51.490> do<00:03:51.670> this<00:03:51.850> again<00:03:56.940> but

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:57.940 
so I probably did will do this again but

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:01.740 
so I probably did will do this again but
as<00:03:58.090> you<00:03:58.300> can<00:03:58.510> see<00:04:00.030> what<00:04:01.030> we've<00:04:01.210> ended<00:04:01.570> up<00:04:01.690> with

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
as you can see what we've ended up with

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:10.850 
as you can see what we've ended up with
there<00:04:02.350> is<00:04:03.340> a<00:04:05.250> perfectly<00:04:06.250> good<00:04:08.370> drain<00:04:09.370> thread

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:10.860 
there is a perfectly good drain thread

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:13.790 
there is a perfectly good drain thread
I'm<00:04:11.860> sure<00:04:12.130> you<00:04:12.310> cannot<00:04:12.700> see<00:04:12.940> it<00:04:13.060> on<00:04:13.150> the<00:04:13.270> camera

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:13.800 
I'm sure you cannot see it on the camera

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:18.840 
I'm sure you cannot see it on the camera
but<00:04:14.800> it's<00:04:16.260> it's<00:04:17.260> surprisingly<00:04:18.070> how<00:04:18.370> good<00:04:18.670> that

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:18.850 
but it's it's surprisingly how good that

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:19.289 
but it's it's surprisingly how good that
looks

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:19.299 
looks

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:22.560 
looks
I<00:04:19.480> believe<00:04:20.350> it'll<00:04:20.590> be<00:04:20.680> a<00:04:20.710> visible<00:04:21.520> time

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:22.570 
I believe it'll be a visible time

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:27.720 
I believe it'll be a visible time
this<00:04:23.400> is<00:04:24.400> the<00:04:24.820> second<00:04:25.740> piston<00:04:26.740> that<00:04:26.950> are

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:27.730 
this is the second piston that are

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:33.750 
this is the second piston that are
removed<00:04:28.530> and<00:04:29.530> the<00:04:29.970> I<00:04:32.250> used<00:04:33.250> the<00:04:33.460> same

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:33.760 
removed and the I used the same

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.680 
removed and the I used the same
procedure<00:04:34.420> to<00:04:34.920> remove<00:04:35.920> this<00:04:36.400> this<00:04:36.910> piston

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:37.690 
procedure to remove this this piston

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:40.860 
procedure to remove this this piston
here<00:04:37.960> from<00:04:38.590> this<00:04:38.770> cylinder<00:04:39.190> and<00:04:40.150> as<00:04:40.540> you<00:04:40.690> can

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:40.870 
here from this cylinder and as you can

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:44.100 
here from this cylinder and as you can
see<00:04:40.930> one<00:04:41.530> ring<00:04:41.860> is<00:04:42.100> stuck<00:04:42.520> I<00:04:42.910> will<00:04:43.660> put<00:04:43.930> this

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:44.110 
see one ring is stuck I will put this

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:52.590 
see one ring is stuck I will put this
one<00:04:44.380> at<00:04:44.530> Alette<00:04:44.740> college<00:04:45.190> tank<00:04:45.490> also<00:04:51.600> you

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:52.600 
one at Alette college tank also you

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:59.070 
one at Alette college tank also you
could<00:04:53.580> take<00:04:54.580> a<00:04:54.930> piece<00:04:55.930> of<00:04:56.110> wood<00:04:56.910> and<00:04:57.910> most<00:04:58.870> of

00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.080 
could take a piece of wood and most of

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.950 
could take a piece of wood and most of
time<00:04:59.260> you<00:04:59.620> can<00:05:00.010> free<00:05:00.340> these<00:05:00.700> rings<00:05:01.030> up<00:05:01.390> this

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:01.960 
time you can free these rings up this

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.830 
time you can free these rings up this
piston<00:05:02.500> looks<00:05:02.770> really<00:05:03.250> really<00:05:03.550> good<00:05:03.790> this<00:05:04.030> it

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:04.840 
piston looks really really good this it

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:06.810 
piston looks really really good this it
actually<00:05:05.290> looks<00:05:05.500> better<00:05:05.710> than<00:05:06.010> the<00:05:06.190> other<00:05:06.430> one

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:06.820 
actually looks better than the other one

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:10.320 
actually looks better than the other one
so<00:05:07.150> I<00:05:08.020> will<00:05:08.320> clean<00:05:08.620> up<00:05:08.650> both<00:05:08.950> up<00:05:09.220> and<00:05:09.520> we'll<00:05:10.300> use

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:10.330 
so I will clean up both up and we'll use

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:13.440 
so I will clean up both up and we'll use
the<00:05:10.780> best<00:05:10.960> one<00:05:11.230> of<00:05:11.290> the<00:05:11.500> two<00:05:11.910> I'm<00:05:12.910> going<00:05:13.240> to<00:05:13.300> use

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:13.450

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:43.840 
the top of the piston off and they just

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:46.560 
the top of the piston off and they just
abandon<00:06:44.710> in<00:06:44.890> it<00:06:45.130> and<00:06:45.760> it<00:06:45.940> came<00:06:46.180> into<00:06:46.390> my

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:55.770 
possession thinking that the only thing
I<00:06:50.650> could<00:06:50.710> save<00:06:51.220> was<00:06:52.120> the<00:06:52.690> rod<00:06:52.950> but<00:06:53.950> I<00:06:54.510> used<00:06:55.510> the

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:55.780 
I could save was the rod but I used the

00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:59.760 
I could save was the rod but I used the
Cape<00:06:56.440> chisel<00:06:57.400> and<00:06:58.300> I<00:06:58.450> chiseled<00:06:59.170> away<00:06:59.320> the

piston down in the cylinder a little bit
at<00:07:02.950> the<00:07:03.100> time<00:07:03.370> I<00:07:03.790> have<00:07:04.210> used<00:07:04.540> a<00:07:05.320> multitude<00:07:06.310> of
