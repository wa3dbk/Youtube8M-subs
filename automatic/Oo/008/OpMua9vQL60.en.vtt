00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
art I did I wanted to be that size but I

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:11.080 
art I did I wanted to be that size but I
realized<00:03:06.530> that<00:03:06.950> was<00:03:07.280> not<00:03:07.970> the<00:03:08.510> case<00:03:10.060> when<00:03:11.060> I

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
realized that was not the case when I

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.259 
realized that was not the case when I
was<00:03:11.269> finished<00:03:11.660> making<00:03:12.500> them<00:03:12.709> the<00:03:13.220> one<00:03:14.030> of<00:03:14.150> the

00:03:14.259 --> 00:03:14.269 
was finished making them the one of the

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:18.670 
was finished making them the one of the
legs<00:03:14.570> I<00:03:16.000> discovered<00:03:17.000> that<00:03:17.150> she<00:03:17.600> was<00:03:18.350> already

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
legs I discovered that she was already

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.610 
legs I discovered that she was already
taller<00:03:19.160> so<00:03:20.030> that<00:03:20.630> was<00:03:20.780> not<00:03:20.900> gonna<00:03:21.080> happen

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
taller so that was not gonna happen

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.440 
taller so that was not gonna happen
it<00:03:22.370> took<00:03:22.519> about<00:03:22.670> five<00:03:23.540> to<00:03:23.810> six<00:03:23.959> hours<00:03:24.370> roughly

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
it took about five to six hours roughly

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:28.180 
it took about five to six hours roughly
it's<00:03:26.450> made<00:03:26.690> out<00:03:26.810> of<00:03:26.930> different<00:03:27.590> colored<00:03:27.980> wool

00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:31.519 
and the sand or the skin and so it's or

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:34.090 
and the sand or the skin and so it's or

outlined to keep the sand in place and

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.970 
outlined to keep the sand in place and
they'd<00:03:36.049> stand<00:03:36.350> and<00:03:36.590> the<00:03:37.579> rest<00:03:38.060> of<00:03:38.180> it<00:03:38.269> is<00:03:38.420> just

used any on this one though I think it's

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:54.400 
used any on this one though I think it's
turned<00:03:53.660> up<00:03:53.690> pretty<00:03:53.900> good

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:54.410 
turned up pretty good

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:57.699 
turned up pretty good

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:00.530 
when making this I have used a picture

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:04.120 
when making this I have used a picture
as<00:04:00.980> a<00:04:01.220> reference<00:04:01.610> and<00:04:01.820> then<00:04:02.500> I've<00:04:03.500> placed<00:04:03.799> each

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:04.130 
as a reference and then I've placed each

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:06.880 
as a reference and then I've placed each
block<00:04:05.110> individually<00:04:06.110> by<00:04:06.350> hand<00:04:06.380> using

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:10.580 
creative that is a and a it took a while

out of hand and so so big and I reached

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:35.790 
out of hand and so so big and I reached
the<00:04:33.690> building<00:04:34.690> limit<00:04:35.320> or<00:04:35.470> the<00:04:35.590> height<00:04:35.770> limit

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:35.800 
the building limit or the height limit

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.280 
the building limit or the height limit
where<00:04:36.460> I<00:04:36.490> can't<00:04:36.729> place<00:04:37.000> any<00:04:37.030> more<00:04:37.300> blocks<00:04:37.570> and

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:38.290 
where I can't place any more blocks and

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:42.500 
where I can't place any more blocks and
I<00:04:39.070> was<00:04:39.220> only<00:04:39.400> only<00:04:40.090> at<00:04:40.180> the<00:04:40.270> neck<00:04:40.479> so<00:04:41.290> I<00:04:41.320> had<00:04:41.680> to

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:42.510 
I was only only at the neck so I had to

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:47.340 
I was only only at the neck so I had to
to<00:04:43.510> make<00:04:44.020> the<00:04:44.169> head<00:04:44.350> I<00:04:44.380> had<00:04:44.680> to<00:04:45.479> install<00:04:46.479> I<00:04:46.870> want

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:47.350 
to make the head I had to install I want

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:49.170 
to make the head I had to install I want
to<00:04:47.440> say<00:04:47.590> quickly<00:04:47.740> install<00:04:48.280> but<00:04:48.490> it<00:04:48.729> certainly

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:49.180 
to say quickly install but it certainly

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:52.469 
to say quickly install but it certainly
wasn't<00:04:49.540> quick<00:04:49.870> I<00:04:50.080> had<00:04:50.200> to<00:04:50.320> install<00:04:51.479> worldedit

00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:52.479 
wasn't quick I had to install worldedit

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:56.490 
wasn't quick I had to install worldedit
and<00:04:52.900> kinda<00:04:53.470> you<00:04:53.500> know<00:04:54.750> take<00:04:55.750> this<00:04:55.900> big<00:04:56.139> chunk

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:56.500 
and kinda you know take this big chunk

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:00.930 
and kinda you know take this big chunk
out<00:04:56.710> of<00:04:56.740> of<00:04:57.310> the<00:04:57.610> ground<00:04:57.850> and<00:04:58.120> lower<00:04:58.960> it<00:04:59.430> but<00:05:00.430> I

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:00.940 
out of of the ground and lower it but I

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:02.640 
out of of the ground and lower it but I
don't<00:05:01.330> know<00:05:01.479> how<00:05:01.660> many<00:05:01.720> blocks<00:05:02.200> it<00:05:02.380> is<00:05:02.470> maybe

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:02.650 
don't know how many blocks it is maybe

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:05.190 
don't know how many blocks it is maybe
on<00:05:03.460> 20<00:05:03.820> blocks<00:05:04.000> I<00:05:04.300> had<00:05:04.389> to<00:05:04.450> lower<00:05:04.660> it<00:05:04.870> because<00:05:05.110> I

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:05.200 
on 20 blocks I had to lower it because I

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:09.659 
on 20 blocks I had to lower it because I
want<00:05:05.410> it<00:05:05.590> was<00:05:06.090> in<00:05:07.090> the<00:05:07.300> air<00:05:07.479> originally<00:05:08.669> so

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:09.669 
want it was in the air originally so

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:12.140 
want it was in the air originally so
yeah<00:05:09.880> I<00:05:09.940> had<00:05:10.180> to

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:12.150 
yeah I had to

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:14.909 
yeah I had to
lower<00:05:13.150> it<00:05:13.330> a<00:05:13.419> bit<00:05:13.449> to<00:05:13.810> make<00:05:13.990> room<00:05:14.259> for<00:05:14.469> the<00:05:14.740> head

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:14.919 
lower it a bit to make room for the head

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:17.850 
lower it a bit to make room for the head
and<00:05:15.249> I<00:05:15.669> think<00:05:15.939> it's<00:05:16.090> like<00:05:16.270> three<00:05:17.199> blocks<00:05:17.439> left

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:17.860 
and I think it's like three blocks left

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:23.249 
and I think it's like three blocks left
two<00:05:18.689> until<00:05:19.689> the<00:05:19.930> block<00:05:20.650> limit<00:05:21.129> so<00:05:21.969> it's<00:05:22.870> pretty

00:05:23.249 --> 00:05:23.259 
two until the block limit so it's pretty

00:05:23.259 --> 00:05:28.830 
two until the block limit so it's pretty
big<00:05:23.680> and<00:05:25.710> yeah<00:05:27.240> so<00:05:28.240> this<00:05:28.360> was<00:05:28.569> kind<00:05:28.719> of<00:05:28.749> a
