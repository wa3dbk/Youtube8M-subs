00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.329

 dylan tons this second to the general the 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.860
 dutch lindemann and then also 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:50.160
 Sebastian delfosse whose five of 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.610
 general and no yann guyot trapped in 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.829
 the rear 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.329
 the pursuit-race engages arm wrestling 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.489
 and big pedal strokes with four 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.739
 sales representatives u and too much 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.270
 well ranked runners the scales leans 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.879
 in favor of the top 15

 the army in arms bah yann 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.390
 guyot but it will be in vain 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.250
 so that's before she 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.680
 looking in the long climb on the 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.650
 dinan pavers the 2014 winner the 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.820
 Belgian or the Dutch dylan toys or 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.740
 berthe yann lienemann 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.420
 the answer is not yet given that 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.080
 other runners play the victory 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.450
 step 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.920
 while still others ensures a 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.810
 place in the general it is the case of 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.960
 the amazing franck bonnamour of the 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:32.500
 selection brittany on fun 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:34.540
 satisfaction is clearly too much 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.280
 clearly because I franck I 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.240
 am since 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.500

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.509
 I am more of a temperament 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.770
 very optimistic and especially the 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:45.759
 concerning but that's true I 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.830
 not expect at all that it 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:51.970
 evolves to such a level it's it's 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:54.509
 bluffing at 3000 very promising of the same 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:54.509
 for my confidence 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:59.900
 one of the youngest can one times 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:03.440

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.980
 power of the Croatian matira basin to 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.530
 height of several attempts 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.480
