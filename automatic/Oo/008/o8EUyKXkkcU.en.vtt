00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.180
 how about friends this time I'm going to 

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:06.860
 teach to install the expansions of the 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:10.100
 nexus 

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:12.680
 as you can see here I have my connection 

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:14.930
 of expansions and before proceeding 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:17.270
 I will make a recommendation only 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:21.650
 install the expansions that are a single 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:24.380
 extension file in xp are the 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:27.440
 originals and manage to have complications 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:29.780
 when installing 

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:34.760
 already cleared of that 

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:38.170
 we will continue installing the stations 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.170
 let's do the study 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.450
 inserting are lax 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.610
 let's go to the system tab 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:56.320
 and here we are going to click on import data 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:02.520
 look for the folder where they have their 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:02.520
 expansions 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:11.640
 I'm going to load the expansion 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.640
 to show you 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:21.880
 select the file in xp and open it 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:25.469
 and will begin to load the expansion 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.469
 they wait for me to load 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:35.320
 and if the expansion is loaded correctly 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:38.460
 should appear this gives us 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.460
 they give him to accept 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:45.090
 and as you see, the expression does not come out 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.090
 installed 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:52.580
 now we 're going to bookstore and here we 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:56.560
 should appear 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.560
 as you can see here is 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:08.280
 and so it would be the same with the rest of the 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.560
 expansions I hope you served them your 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:14.150
 information and see you in a next 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.150
 tutorial see you later
