those really bouncy rubber balls called

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.399 
those really bouncy rubber balls called
a<00:01:40.009> whammo<00:01:40.430> and<00:01:40.780> whenever<00:01:41.780> you<00:01:41.960> bounce<00:01:42.140> it<00:01:42.320> on

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:42.409 
a whammo and whenever you bounce it on

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:45.249 
a whammo and whenever you bounce it on
the<00:01:42.560> floor<00:01:42.799> it<00:01:43.280> will<00:01:44.119> bounce<00:01:44.509> and<00:01:44.930> then<00:01:45.140> it

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:45.259 
the floor it will bounce and then it

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:46.719 
the floor it will bounce and then it
will<00:01:45.350> bounce<00:01:45.470> a<00:01:45.710> little<00:01:45.830> higher<00:01:46.130> and<00:01:46.490> then<00:01:46.580> a

little<00:01:46.939> higher<00:01:47.240> and<00:01:47.570> then<00:01:47.720> really<00:01:48.080> higher<00:01:48.320> and

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
little higher and then really higher and

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:50.920 
little higher and then really higher and
faster<00:01:49.400> until<00:01:49.430> it's<00:01:49.939> like<00:01:50.119> bouncing<00:01:50.570> all<00:01:50.659> over

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:50.930 
faster until it's like bouncing all over

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:52.090 
faster until it's like bouncing all over
the<00:01:51.020> walls<00:01:51.200> kind<00:01:51.439> of<00:01:51.560> like<00:01:51.710> you've<00:01:51.890> seen<00:01:52.040> in

the walls kind of like you've seen in

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.109 
the walls kind of like you've seen in
current<00:01:52.490> teams<00:01:52.640> where<00:01:52.850> they<00:01:52.939> bounce

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:53.119 
current teams where they bounce

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:54.999 
current teams where they bounce
something<00:01:53.420> off<00:01:53.570> a<00:01:53.630> wall<00:01:53.930> and<00:01:54.259> it<00:01:54.710> just<00:01:54.740> goes

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:55.009 
something off a wall and it just goes

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:59.800 
something off a wall and it just goes
all<00:01:55.520> over<00:01:55.630> and<00:01:58.119> it's<00:01:59.119> safe

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
all over and it's safe

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.649 
all over and it's safe
if<00:01:59.950> you<00:02:00.950> don't<00:02:01.130> bounce<00:02:01.340> it<00:02:01.640> but<00:02:02.240> if<00:02:02.329> you<00:02:02.450> start

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:02.659 
if you don't bounce it but if you start

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:04.450 
if you don't bounce it but if you start
bouncing<00:02:03.049> it<00:02:03.170> you<00:02:03.350> better<00:02:03.530> duck<00:02:03.799> and<00:02:04.100> get<00:02:04.250> some

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 
bouncing it you better duck and get some

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.910 
bouncing it you better duck and get some
cover<00:02:04.700> it<00:02:05.149> might<00:02:05.720> knock<00:02:06.140> your<00:02:06.320> teeth<00:02:06.500> out<00:02:06.710> or
