this is a pretty easy process here I'm
just<00:02:10.319> kind<00:02:10.500> of<00:02:10.560> doing<00:02:10.890> the<00:02:11.009> edges<00:02:11.580> to<00:02:12.480> try<00:02:12.660> to

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
just kind of doing the edges to try to

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.350 
just kind of doing the edges to try to
give<00:02:12.930> it<00:02:13.050> the<00:02:13.140> maximum<00:02:14.540> readability<00:02:16.040> success

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
give it the maximum readability success

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.780 
give it the maximum readability success
hit<00:02:18.360> continue<00:02:19.130> it's<00:02:20.130> going<00:02:20.280> to<00:02:20.340> ask<00:02:20.459> me<00:02:20.580> for<00:02:20.640> a

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
hit continue it's going to ask me for a

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.520 
hit continue it's going to ask me for a

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
passcode this will just be for this
