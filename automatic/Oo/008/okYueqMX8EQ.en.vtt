look at super tradin know this is sort

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.299 
look at super tradin know this is sort
of<00:00:33.610> replaced<00:00:34.030> what<00:00:34.420> I<00:00:34.480> believe<00:00:34.780> and<00:00:35.140> was<00:00:35.950> EV

00:00:36.299 --> 00:00:36.309 
of replaced what I believe and was EV

of replaced what I believe and was EV
trained<00:00:36.610> in<00:00:36.760> the<00:00:36.879> past<00:00:37.120> couple<00:00:37.390> of<00:00:37.480> games<00:00:37.539> I've

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:37.870

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.950 
trained in the past couple of games I've
never<00:00:38.019> really<00:00:38.440> and<00:00:38.679> tried<00:00:39.640> EV<00:00:39.999> training<00:00:40.300> me

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:40.960 
never really and tried EV training me

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.959 
never really and tried EV training me
well<00:00:41.140> i<00:00:41.379> started<00:00:41.800> tried<00:00:42.160> a<00:00:42.190> little<00:00:42.489> bit<00:00:42.760> but

00:00:42.959 --> 00:00:42.969 
well i started tried a little bit but

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:45.509 
well i started tried a little bit but
didn't<00:00:43.929> have<00:00:44.109> time<00:00:44.320> to<00:00:44.469> invest<00:00:44.739> too<00:00:45.039> much<00:00:45.070> into

00:00:45.509 --> 00:00:45.519 
didn't have time to invest too much into

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:47.610 
didn't have time to invest too much into
it<00:00:45.550> but<00:00:46.300> then<00:00:46.449> let's<00:00:47.019> look<00:00:47.140> at<00:00:47.289> this<00:00:47.409> this<00:00:47.559> is

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:47.620 
it but then let's look at this this is

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.189 
it but then let's look at this this is
going<00:00:47.920> to<00:00:48.039> raise<00:00:48.429> your<00:00:48.879> special<00:00:49.480> attack<00:00:49.809> let

00:00:50.189 --> 00:00:50.199 
going to raise your special attack let

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:52.860 
going to raise your special attack let
me<00:00:50.260> just<00:00:50.469> level<00:00:50.739> one<00:00:50.980> over<00:00:51.940> there<00:00:52.089> and<00:00:52.629> this<00:00:52.719> is

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:52.870 
me just level one over there and this is

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:54.689 
me just level one over there and this is
a<00:00:52.899> magnet<00:00:53.199> game<00:00:53.530> so<00:00:53.769> doing<00:00:54.069> this<00:00:54.190> will<00:00:54.460> raise

00:00:54.689 --> 00:00:54.699 
a magnet game so doing this will raise

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:57.930 
a magnet game so doing this will raise
your<00:00:54.909> special<00:00:55.359> attack<00:00:56.199> and<00:00:56.499> i'm<00:00:57.190> using<00:00:57.729> and

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:57.940 
your special attack and i'm using and

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:03.149 
your special attack and i'm using and
charm<00:00:58.510> under<00:00:58.809> here<00:00:59.460> so<00:01:00.460> as<00:01:00.850> you<00:01:01.089> can<00:01:01.210> see<00:01:02.159> the

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:03.159 
charm under here so as you can see the

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:06.320 
charm under here so as you can see the
idea<00:01:03.460> is<00:01:03.699> you've<00:01:04.449> got<00:01:04.629> targets<00:01:04.870> at<00:01:05.379> the<00:01:05.680> top

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
idea is you've got targets at the top

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.980 
idea is you've got targets at the top
now<00:01:07.330> there's<00:01:07.479> going<00:01:07.630> to<00:01:07.720> be<00:01:07.750> a<00:01:07.840> bit<00:01:07.960> awkward

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:07.990 
now there's going to be a bit awkward

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.700 
now there's going to be a bit awkward
for<00:01:08.260> me<00:01:08.440> to<00:01:08.470> do<00:01:08.680> but<00:01:09.310> what<00:01:09.640> you<00:01:09.729> need<00:01:09.759> to<00:01:09.909> do<00:01:10.149> is

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
for me to do but what you need to do is

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:17.039 
for me to do but what you need to do is
the<00:01:11.710> white<00:01:11.890> boxes<00:01:12.930> you<00:01:13.930> need<00:01:14.079> to<00:01:14.200> hit<00:01:15.509> and<00:01:16.509> then

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:17.049 
the white boxes you need to hit and then

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:20.789 
the white boxes you need to hit and then
you<00:01:17.079> need<00:01:17.259> to<00:01:17.350> avoid<00:01:17.469> the<00:01:17.860> black<00:01:18.100> balls<00:01:19.799> that

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:20.799 
you need to avoid the black balls that

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:24.749 
you need to avoid the black balls that
Magnemite<00:01:21.219> throw<00:01:21.430> results<00:01:22.770> if<00:01:23.770> the<00:01:24.310> idea<00:01:24.430> is

00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:24.759 
Magnemite throw results if the idea is

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:28.560 
Magnemite throw results if the idea is
oh<00:01:25.649> god<00:01:26.649> it<00:01:26.770> that<00:01:26.979> but<00:01:27.880> I<00:01:27.969> with<00:01:28.180> the<00:01:28.270> deal<00:01:28.450> when

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:28.570 
oh god it that but I with the deal when

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:30.149 
oh god it that but I with the deal when
you're<00:01:28.689> trying<00:01:28.840> to<00:01:28.960> record<00:01:29.619> and<00:01:29.860> look<00:01:29.950> at<00:01:30.070> this

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:30.159 
you're trying to record and look at this

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:33.270 
you're trying to record and look at this
i<00:01:30.420> wish<00:01:31.420> i<00:01:31.479> had<00:01:31.600> a<00:01:31.630> 3ds<00:01:32.140> capture<00:01:32.590> device<00:01:32.829> but<00:01:33.100> I

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280 
i wish i had a 3ds capture device but I

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.840 
i wish i had a 3ds capture device but I
don't<00:01:33.640> so<00:01:34.570> the<00:01:34.659> idea<00:01:34.780> is<00:01:35.159> like<00:01:36.159> I<00:01:36.219> say<00:01:36.490> you're

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:36.850 
don't so the idea is like I say you're

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:38.819 
don't so the idea is like I say you're
hitting<00:01:37.210> these<00:01:37.479> white<00:01:37.780> squares<00:01:38.200> with<00:01:38.530> your

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:38.829 
hitting these white squares with your

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:42.090 
hitting these white squares with your
side<00:01:39.280> of<00:01:39.399> easy<00:01:39.520> football<00:01:40.170> and<00:01:41.170> you<00:01:41.710> get<00:01:41.950> that

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100 
side of easy football and you get that

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.060 
side of easy football and you get that
amount<00:01:42.520> they're<00:01:42.820> so<00:01:43.119> like<00:01:43.359> 300<00:01:44.049> to<00:01:44.740> complete

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.070 
amount they're so like 300 to complete

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.880 
amount they're so like 300 to complete
the<00:01:45.189> training<00:01:45.430> and<00:01:45.990> you<00:01:46.990> need<00:01:47.140> to<00:01:47.229> avoid<00:01:47.500> the

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890 
the training and you need to avoid the

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.999 
the training and you need to avoid the
black<00:01:48.369> balls<00:01:48.640> left<00:01:49.469> Magnemite<00:01:50.469> shots<00:01:50.740> yet

00:01:50.999 --> 00:01:51.009 
black balls left Magnemite shots yet

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:54.240 
black balls left Magnemite shots yet
someone<00:01:51.640> was<00:01:51.670> cleared<00:01:52.030> and<00:01:52.329> we<00:01:53.200> get<00:01:53.350> special

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
someone was cleared and we get special

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.880 
someone was cleared and we get special
attack<00:01:54.520> goes<00:01:54.880> up<00:01:55.090> by<00:01:55.240> four<00:01:55.659> and<00:01:55.960> then<00:01:56.679> when<00:01:56.799> you

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 
attack goes up by four and then when you

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:03.179 
attack goes up by four and then when you
complete<00:01:57.280> that<00:01:57.390> you<00:01:58.390> get<00:01:58.630> a<00:01:59.759> bug<00:02:01.920> so<00:02:02.920> this<00:02:03.039> is<00:02:03.070> a

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:03.189 
complete that you get a bug so this is a

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:07.260 
complete that you get a bug so this is a
special<00:02:03.429> attack<00:02:03.850> bug<00:02:05.070> and<00:02:06.070> I've<00:02:06.909> a<00:02:06.939> three<00:02:07.210> of

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
special attack bug and I've a three of

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.180 
special attack bug and I've a three of
them<00:02:07.479> know<00:02:07.630> so<00:02:08.200> then<00:02:08.410> you<00:02:08.560> can<00:02:08.679> come<00:02:08.860> in<00:02:09.070> the

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
them know so then you can come in the

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:10.440 
them know so then you can come in the
car<00:02:09.399> trend<00:02:09.670> there's<00:02:09.789> a<00:02:09.820> lot<00:02:09.940> the<00:02:10.030> difference

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
car trend there's a lot the difference

i'll hit the back the bag by itself once

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.350 
i'll hit the back the bag by itself once
in<00:02:17.470> minute<00:02:17.709> if<00:02:17.890> you<00:02:17.920> just<00:02:18.099> leave<00:02:18.220> it<00:02:18.280> to<00:02:18.550> itself

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
in minute if you just leave it to itself

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.360 
in minute if you just leave it to itself
so<00:02:19.840> the<00:02:19.990> selector<00:02:20.350> bug<00:02:20.530> I'm<00:02:20.770> going<00:02:21.160> to<00:02:21.220> go

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
so the selector bug I'm going to go

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.650

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
bug I want to use this special attack

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:32.700 
bug I want to use this special attack
bug<00:02:30.000> use<00:02:31.000> that<00:02:31.320> going<00:02:32.320> to<00:02:32.380> use<00:02:32.470> a<00:02:32.590> few

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:32.710 
bug use that going to use a few

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:34.440 
bug use that going to use a few
Charmander<00:02:33.280> know<00:02:33.610> if<00:02:33.760> I<00:02:33.850> just<00:02:34.030> leave<00:02:34.240> its

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
Charmander know if I just leave its

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.000 
Charmander know if I just leave its
Charmander<00:02:35.050> will<00:02:35.170> hit<00:02:35.320> the<00:02:35.410> bug<00:02:35.560> by<00:02:35.740> himself

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
Charmander will hit the bug by himself

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.700 
Charmander will hit the bug by himself
one<00:02:36.250> similis<00:02:36.640> or<00:02:37.140> you<00:02:38.140> can<00:02:38.290> just<00:02:38.440> tap<00:02:38.650> it

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:38.710 
one similis or you can just tap it

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:40.830 
one similis or you can just tap it
constantly<00:02:39.310> and<00:02:40.000> it<00:02:40.180> doesn't<00:02:40.330> take<00:02:40.480> very<00:02:40.600> long

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
constantly and it doesn't take very long

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:50.300 
constantly and it doesn't take very long
just<00:02:41.110> a<00:02:41.260> couple<00:02:41.440> of<00:02:41.530> seconds<00:02:47.490> in<00:02:48.490> there<00:02:48.700> we<00:02:48.790> go

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
just a couple of seconds in there we go

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.860 
just a couple of seconds in there we go
so<00:02:51.310> I'm<00:02:51.370> guessing<00:02:51.550> as<00:02:51.880> you<00:02:52.120> sort<00:02:52.360> static<00:02:52.750> or

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
so I'm guessing as you sort static or

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:54.180 
so I'm guessing as you sort static or
where<00:02:52.990> you<00:02:53.050> get<00:02:53.170> better<00:02:53.380> bugs<00:02:53.590> or<00:02:53.770> take<00:02:53.980> longer

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
where you get better bugs or take longer

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:56.370 
where you get better bugs or take longer
break<00:02:54.610> them<00:02:54.880> which<00:02:55.420> is<00:02:55.540> why<00:02:55.690> your<00:02:55.870> Pokemon

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
break them which is why your Pokemon

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.470 
break them which is why your Pokemon
will<00:02:57.010> do<00:02:57.160> just<00:02:57.370> one<00:02:57.489> at<00:02:57.550> a<00:02:57.580> time<00:02:57.790> and<00:02:58.030> sometimes

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
will do just one at a time and sometimes

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.360 
will do just one at a time and sometimes
you'll<00:02:58.870> actually<00:02:58.989> find<00:02:59.350> another<00:02:59.709> bug<00:02:59.920> so<00:03:00.160> this

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
you'll actually find another bug so this

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.790 
you'll actually find another bug so this
time<00:03:00.610> Charmander<00:03:01.600> managed<00:03:01.900> to<00:03:02.050> find<00:03:02.320> an

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:02.800 
time Charmander managed to find an

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.729 
time Charmander managed to find an
attack<00:03:03.310> bag<00:03:03.550> medium<00:03:04.170> so<00:03:05.170> if<00:03:05.230> I<00:03:05.320> comet<00:03:05.590> there

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739 
attack bag medium so if I comet there

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:08.270 
attack bag medium so if I comet there
that<00:03:06.160> I've<00:03:06.220> got<00:03:06.340> three<00:03:06.520> bugs<00:03:06.790> again<00:03:07.120> and

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
that I've got three bugs again and

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.830 
that I've got three bugs again and
that's<00:03:09.280> pretty<00:03:09.489> much<00:03:09.610> it<00:03:09.730> summed<00:03:10.150> up<00:03:10.270> so<00:03:10.750> you

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
that's pretty much it summed up so you

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.479 
that's pretty much it summed up so you
can<00:03:10.959> see<00:03:10.989> here<00:03:11.410> the<00:03:11.620> tutorial<00:03:12.130> takes<00:03:12.370> you

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:12.489 
can see here the tutorial takes you

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:14.070 
can see here the tutorial takes you
through<00:03:12.640> an<00:03:12.760> ant<00:03:12.880> some<00:03:13.030> defense<00:03:13.360> but<00:03:13.959> I'll

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:14.080 
through an ant some defense but I'll

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.530 
through an ant some defense but I'll
focus<00:03:14.320> on<00:03:14.590> the<00:03:14.709> Charmander<00:03:15.280> for<00:03:15.910> a<00:03:16.150> special

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:35.049 
in this video as well shouldn't take

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:38.640 
in this video as well shouldn't take
very<00:03:35.170> long<00:03:35.440> to<00:03:35.590> do<00:03:36.269> so<00:03:37.350> again<00:03:38.350> it's<00:03:38.500> a<00:03:38.530> bit<00:03:38.620> out

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
very long to do so again it's a bit out

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:40.650 
very long to do so again it's a bit out
with<00:03:38.920> the<00:03:39.040> show<00:03:39.489> with<00:03:39.670> both<00:03:39.850> screens<00:03:40.150> but<00:03:40.540> this

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:40.660 
with the show with both screens but this

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:42.900 
with the show with both screens but this
middle<00:03:40.930> circle<00:03:41.110> here<00:03:41.500> is<00:03:41.769> your<00:03:42.070> power<00:03:42.280> bar<00:03:42.610> if

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
middle circle here is your power bar if

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:45.449 
middle circle here is your power bar if
this<00:03:43.180> builds<00:03:43.840> up<00:03:43.989> when<00:03:44.530> you<00:03:44.650> hit<00:03:44.830> you<00:03:45.100> get<00:03:45.280> more

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:45.459 
this builds up when you hit you get more

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:47.820 
this builds up when you hit you get more
points<00:03:45.670> in<00:03:46.060> ideas<00:03:46.780> slightly<00:03:47.230> get<00:03:47.350> 200<00:03:47.799> points

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:47.830 
points in ideas slightly get 200 points

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:50.160 
points in ideas slightly get 200 points
in<00:03:48.310> the<00:03:48.489> allotted<00:03:48.640> time<00:03:48.760> and<00:03:49.269> then<00:03:49.810> on<00:03:50.019> this

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:50.170 
in the allotted time and then on this

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:52.680 
in the allotted time and then on this
screen<00:03:50.350> there<00:03:50.620> is<00:03:50.890> just<00:03:51.340> that's<00:03:52.330> where<00:03:52.600> you

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690 
screen there is just that's where you

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:54.509 
screen there is just that's where you
tappin<00:03:53.049> but<00:03:53.680> it's<00:03:53.769> the<00:03:53.830> top<00:03:54.010> screen<00:03:54.220> that<00:03:54.459> you

00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:54.519 
tappin but it's the top screen that you

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:57.150 
tappin but it's the top screen that you
need<00:03:54.670> to<00:03:54.730> be<00:03:54.850> looking<00:03:55.000> at<00:03:55.180> more<00:03:55.530> so<00:03:56.530> this<00:03:56.950> one

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:57.160 
need to be looking at more so this one

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:58.620 
need to be looking at more so this one
it's<00:03:57.340> a<00:03:57.400> little<00:03:57.730> bit<00:03:57.850> tricky<00:03:58.150> yet<00:03:58.269> because

00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:58.630 
it's a little bit tricky yet because

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:01.199 
it's a little bit tricky yet because
there's<00:03:58.810> more<00:03:58.959> than<00:03:59.110> a<00:03:59.170> boat<00:03:59.350> and<00:03:59.970> such<00:04:00.970> a<00:04:01.000> bit

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:01.209 
there's more than a boat and such a bit

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:03.330 
there's more than a boat and such a bit
harder<00:04:01.510> predict<00:04:01.900> and<00:04:02.260> get<00:04:02.590> those<00:04:02.769> high<00:04:03.040> shots

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340 
harder predict and get those high shots

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:06.840 
harder predict and get those high shots
but<00:04:04.060> you<00:04:04.390> only<00:04:04.540> need<00:04:04.720> like<00:04:05.110> 200<00:04:05.470> points<00:04:06.250> but

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:06.850 
but you only need like 200 points but

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:08.280 
but you only need like 200 points but
you<00:04:06.940> showed<00:04:07.120> up<00:04:07.330> more<00:04:07.510> black<00:04:07.720> balls<00:04:07.959> but

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.290 
you showed up more black balls but

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:10.710 
you showed up more black balls but
easier<00:04:08.890> to<00:04:09.040> avoid<00:04:09.280> they're<00:04:10.000> done<00:04:10.360> in<00:04:10.450> just<00:04:10.570> a

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 
easier to avoid they're done in just a

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.660 
easier to avoid they're done in just a
matter<00:04:10.810> of<00:04:10.959> seconds<00:04:11.350> in<00:04:11.680> your<00:04:12.010> values<00:04:12.370> just

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:12.670 
matter of seconds in your values just

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:15.730 
with using the saddle pad and then

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:19.979 
with using the saddle pad and then
that's<00:04:15.940> this<00:04:16.150> train<00:04:16.419> and<00:04:16.630> done<00:04:18.209> success<00:04:19.209> so

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:19.989
