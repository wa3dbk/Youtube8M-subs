00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
functionality so here are my top tips

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.769 
functionality so here are my top tips
and<00:00:28.289> tricks<00:00:28.500> for<00:00:28.680> the<00:00:28.800> Zen<00:00:29.130> UI<00:00:29.400> and<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.539> first

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
and tricks for the Zen UI and the first

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.200 
and tricks for the Zen UI and the first
thing<00:00:30.990> is<00:00:31.140> if<00:00:31.710> you<00:00:32.040> just<00:00:32.070> pull<00:00:32.460> as<00:00:32.700> you<00:00:33.000> can<00:00:33.120> see

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
thing is if you just pull as you can see

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.540 
thing is if you just pull as you can see
we<00:00:33.420> have<00:00:33.540> some<00:00:33.660> notifications<00:00:34.350> etc<00:00:34.829> and<00:00:35.040> the

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
we have some notifications etc and the

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.459 
we have some notifications etc and the
way<00:00:35.670> the<00:00:35.820> notifications<00:00:36.480> work<00:00:36.840> on<00:00:37.050> this<00:00:37.230> issue

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
way the notifications work on this issue

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.530 
way the notifications work on this issue
Zen<00:00:37.829> UI<00:00:37.980> is<00:00:38.219> a<00:00:38.250> little<00:00:38.520> bit<00:00:38.610> different<00:00:39.030> because

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
Zen UI is a little bit different because

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.569 
Zen UI is a little bit different because
if<00:00:39.840> you<00:00:39.930> pull<00:00:40.110> it<00:00:40.140> from<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:40.500> left<00:00:40.710> or<00:00:40.920> if<00:00:41.460> you

if you pull it from the left or if you

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:42.950 
if you pull it from the left or if you

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
pull it from the right it's a little bit

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.410 
pull it from the right it's a little bit
different<00:00:43.290> for<00:00:43.620> example<00:00:43.739> to<00:00:44.340> get<00:00:45.149> to<00:00:45.300> your

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
different for example to get to your

different for example to get to your
notifications<00:00:46.050> you<00:00:46.170> have<00:00:46.289> to<00:00:46.410> pull<00:00:46.590> it<00:00:46.770> down

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
have the safe and it will be reflected

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.480 
have the safe and it will be reflected
now<00:01:24.869> if<00:01:24.990> I<00:01:25.080> just<00:01:25.259> go<00:01:25.409> back<00:01:25.590> here<00:01:25.860> as<00:01:26.040> you<00:01:26.460> can

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
now if I just go back here as you can

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.670 
now if I just go back here as you can
see<00:01:26.640> it<00:01:26.909> is<00:01:27.150> reflected<00:01:27.840> so<00:01:28.140> I<00:01:28.170> find<00:01:28.470> this<00:01:28.590> very

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
see it is reflected so I find this very

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.710 
see it is reflected so I find this very
convenient<00:01:29.430> in<00:01:29.549> my<00:01:29.579> opinion<00:01:30.060> if<00:01:30.390> you<00:01:30.509> click

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720

here by default you will go to your
default<00:01:32.670> settings<00:01:33.450> now<00:01:33.930> if<00:01:34.049> we<00:01:34.140> talk<00:01:34.290> about

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
default settings now if we talk about

a lot but here if we go to the power
consumption<00:04:16.320> table<00:04:16.829> this<00:04:17.459> is<00:04:17.609> pretty

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:17.850 
consumption table this is pretty

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:19.370 
consumption table this is pretty
interesting<00:04:18.180> it<00:04:18.630> gives<00:04:18.840> you<00:04:18.930> the<00:04:19.049> entire

statistics of which app is using the

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:23.360 
statistics of which app is using the
most<00:04:21.989> battery<00:04:22.140> line<00:04:22.650> so<00:04:22.950> if<00:04:23.010> you<00:04:23.130> are<00:04:23.190> having

most battery line so if you are having

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:25.370 
most battery line so if you are having
some<00:04:23.700> battery<00:04:24.120> life<00:04:24.300> issues<00:04:24.630> and<00:04:24.780> let's<00:04:25.260> say

some battery life issues and let's say

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:26.180 
some battery life issues and let's say
some<00:04:25.560> app

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190

but<00:04:53.610> apart<00:04:53.970> from<00:04:54.060> that<00:04:54.680> you<00:04:55.680> also<00:04:56.190> have<00:04:56.460> this

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:56.610 
but apart from that you also have this

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:58.280 
but apart from that you also have this
app<00:04:56.850> installation<00:04:57.240> setting<00:04:57.780> that<00:04:57.900> is<00:04:58.080> pretty

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:58.290 
app installation setting that is pretty

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:01.250 
app installation setting that is pretty
interesting<00:04:58.680> and<00:04:59.040> if<00:04:59.940> you<00:05:00.150> add<00:05:00.360> a<00:05:00.420> micro<00:05:01.020> SD

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:01.260 
interesting and if you add a micro SD

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.190 
interesting and if you add a micro SD
card<00:05:01.560> in<00:05:01.980> that<00:05:02.040> you<00:05:02.730> can<00:05:02.970> set<00:05:03.720> the<00:05:03.870> preferred

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:04.200 
card in that you can set the preferred

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:06.200 
card in that you can set the preferred
location<00:05:04.350> to<00:05:04.830> the<00:05:04.980> SD<00:05:05.280> card<00:05:05.310> not<00:05:05.700> every<00:05:06.060> app

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:06.210 
location to the SD card not every app

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:07.910 
location to the SD card not every app
will<00:05:06.390> be<00:05:06.510> installed<00:05:06.810> in<00:05:06.900> the<00:05:06.990> SD<00:05:07.200> card<00:05:07.410> but<00:05:07.740> it

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:07.920 
will be installed in the SD card but it

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:09.890 
will be installed in the SD card but it
will<00:05:07.980> try<00:05:08.250> to<00:05:08.280> install<00:05:08.700> most<00:05:09.270> of<00:05:09.420> the<00:05:09.480> apps<00:05:09.660> now

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:09.900 
will try to install most of the apps now

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.350 
will try to install most of the apps now
to<00:05:09.960> the<00:05:10.260> extra<00:05:10.890> storage<00:05:11.220> that<00:05:11.490> is<00:05:11.550> the<00:05:11.760> SD<00:05:12.120> card

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:12.360 
to the extra storage that is the SD card

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.120 
to the extra storage that is the SD card
and<00:05:12.540> as<00:05:12.840> you<00:05:12.990> can<00:05:13.140> see<00:05:13.200> I<00:05:13.380> have<00:05:13.620> enabled<00:05:14.040> that

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:14.130 
and as you can see I have enabled that

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:16.400 
and as you can see I have enabled that
option<00:05:14.520> and<00:05:14.790> it<00:05:15.030> works<00:05:15.330> I<00:05:15.510> would<00:05:15.990> say<00:05:16.170> pretty

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:16.410 
option and it works I would say pretty

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:19.460 
option and it works I would say pretty
well<00:05:16.950> so<00:05:17.850> again<00:05:18.060> this<00:05:18.180> is<00:05:18.330> a<00:05:18.360> nice<00:05:18.570> option<00:05:18.810> also

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:19.470 
well so again this is a nice option also

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:21.020 
well so again this is a nice option also

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:22.980 
the glove mode and if you enable that

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:25.400 
the glove mode and if you enable that
the<00:05:23.580> screen<00:05:23.850> sensitivity<00:05:24.240> becomes<00:05:24.870> even<00:05:25.200> more

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:25.410 
the screen sensitivity becomes even more

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:27.350
