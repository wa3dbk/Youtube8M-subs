00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:07.379
 Hello oh damn how bored with 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:10.080
 you video of the joint which is published once 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:13.380
 a few weeks well, I think you yourself know 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:16.830
 why after all it is clear to you I remove reviews on 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.840
 mods while testing builds don't 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.750
 very convenient to shoot because there 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:25.230
 There are builds on which in which there are many 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.990
 bugs plus constantly come out new 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.570
 builds tank launcher and there is also a bunch 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.540
 mistakes and very convenient to shoot it all 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:36.510
 it would be because for example I will take i 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.070
 I'll take a review there in a couple of days 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.750
 completely changed and will be quite 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.969
 differently and how then to explain and people 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:45.090
 will look and have to delete at all 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:47.719
 video is shorter than full kapets but I am again 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.850
 back don't know when came back again 

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:55.289
 I hope that this will not be so long 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:59.309
 Well, in general, today we have a review on the mod 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:02.640
 More precisely on such a mini game with a mod under 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:05.339
 Snake name in general is such a kind 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.880
 surprise and seventies it was very 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.860
 unexpectedly in general let's first for 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.049
 to play this normally 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:18.450
 mini-game you need to create a flat world and 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:22.159
 Now we are here as a tribute 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:25.680
 respect this fashion the name of this fashion 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:26.810
 Chepik yes like so called and 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.810
 create the world 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:34.320
 the main thing that he was a flat devil guys 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:36.509
 but just another reminder in this game 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.990
 better to play in survival mode because 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.680
 that when you play you can 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.220
 by chance 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:48.689
 destroy blocks and it will disturb you 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:51.659
 play well let's start so 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:54.060
 start playing i think everyone knows this 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:57.479
 snake play she 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:00.180
 if anyone if anyone had old nokia 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.220
 there or generally old phones should 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.920
 know 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:07.190
 what kind of game was she built all 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:09.890
 old cell phones and everyone played them 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:13.310
 when there was nothing to do but now everything 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:17.030
 time is killing what is there very damn 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:20.060
 cool games but here we have a snake that I 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:23.630
 I carry in general we type in a chat command 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:26.150
 snake and push such a certain inter 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:29.960
 now go back and wait a few 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:32.290
 seconds I don't know, let's better not 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:37.370
 will be first person 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:39.380
 include a third person review and ours 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.040
 the main task is collecting gold 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.650
 ingots 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:46.630
 it is instead of these squares which 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:49.550
 going but in the original well we just 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:50.600
 run up to this gold ingot take 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:54.290
 him and 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:56.240
 us added one more sheep and 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.580
 the same game accelerates everything as in 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:05.360
 original and it's just great damn 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:09.470

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:12.170
 cool something a little like it 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:15.950
 so so so it would be necessary to reduce the drawing 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:18.050
 and let's man so we go we go and in general 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:20.360
 this game is infinite meaning you can 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:22.160
 play as much as you want I don't know 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:24.320

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:30.560
