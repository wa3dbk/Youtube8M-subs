00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:06.860 
out for this event I'll get some more

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:07.990 
out for this event I'll get some more
footage<00:04:06.980> when<00:04:07.250> it's<00:04:07.370> all<00:04:07.489> set<00:04:07.700> up<00:04:07.819> but<00:04:07.940> I

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 
footage when it's all set up but I

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.790 
footage when it's all set up but I
assume<00:04:08.239> it's<00:04:08.390> going<00:04:08.420> to<00:04:08.569> be<00:04:08.800> substantially

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:09.800 
assume it's going to be substantially

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:14.290 
assume it's going to be substantially
louder<00:04:10.040> and<00:04:10.340> just<00:04:11.030> tougher<00:04:11.269> to<00:04:11.360> manage<00:04:11.630> so<00:04:13.300> an

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:14.300 
louder and just tougher to manage so an

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:17.050 
louder and just tougher to manage so an
Airstream<00:04:14.810> it's<00:04:15.019> a<00:04:15.430> Neil<00:04:16.430> Armstrong<00:04:16.850> and<00:04:16.910> Buzz

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:17.060 
Airstream it's a Neil Armstrong and Buzz

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.050 
Airstream it's a Neil Armstrong and Buzz
Aldrin's<00:04:17.359> first<00:04:17.840> footprints<00:04:18.350> on<00:04:18.440> earth<00:04:19.060> after

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:20.060 
Aldrin's first footprints on earth after

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:23.230 
Aldrin's first footprints on earth after
walking<00:04:20.450> on<00:04:20.660> the<00:04:20.720> moon<00:04:21.760> so<00:04:22.760> I<00:04:22.790> think<00:04:23.060> this<00:04:23.180> is

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.240 
walking on the moon so I think this is

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:27.100 
walking on the moon so I think this is
the<00:04:23.570> the<00:04:24.020> pod<00:04:24.669> that's<00:04:25.669> cool<00:04:25.940> maybe<00:04:26.479> no<00:04:26.750> it

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110 
the the pod that's cool maybe no it

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:28.900 
the the pod that's cool maybe no it
can't<00:04:27.290> be<00:04:27.350> that's<00:04:27.560> an<00:04:27.650> Airstream<00:04:28.100> the<00:04:28.520> trailer

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:28.910 
can't be that's an Airstream the trailer

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:32.890 
can't be that's an Airstream the trailer
what<00:04:29.330> is<00:04:29.419> this

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:32.900 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:37.390

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:42.570 
facility and spacecraft Center that's
cool

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:42.580 
cool

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:45.450 
cool
it's<00:04:42.759> a<00:04:42.879> cool<00:04:43.150> NASA<00:04:43.810> the<00:04:44.800> moon<00:04:45.039> there's

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:45.460 
it's a cool NASA the moon there's

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.159 
it's a cool NASA the moon there's
lots<00:04:45.669> of<00:04:45.849> cool<00:04:46.000> stuff<00:04:46.060> here<00:04:46.419> ah<00:04:46.599> there<00:04:46.900> there

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:47.169 
lots of cool stuff here ah there there

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:51.530 
lots of cool stuff here ah there there
we<00:04:47.259> go<00:04:49.139> that

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:51.540 
we go that

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:53.879 
we go that
back<00:04:52.170> up<00:04:52.350> so<00:04:52.470> you<00:04:52.530> can<00:04:52.620> get<00:04:52.710> a

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:53.889 
back up so you can get a

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:58.279 
back up so you can get a
better<00:04:54.520> look<00:04:54.759> at<00:04:54.849> this<00:04:54.999> thing<00:04:55.210> so<00:04:55.569> I<00:04:55.949> believe

00:04:58.279 --> 00:04:58.289 
better look at this thing so I believe

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:01.489 
better look at this thing so I believe
that<00:04:58.830> is<00:04:58.979> a<00:04:59.009> pod<00:04:59.279> that<00:04:59.550> they<00:04:59.699> would<00:05:00.499> plummet

00:05:01.489 --> 00:05:01.499 
that is a pod that they would plummet

00:05:01.499 --> 00:05:03.290 
that is a pod that they would plummet
back<00:05:01.770> to<00:05:01.979> earth<00:05:02.129> in<00:05:02.339> after<00:05:02.729> a<00:05:02.759> space<00:05:03.059> mission

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:03.300 
back to earth in after a space mission

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:05.420 
back to earth in after a space mission
