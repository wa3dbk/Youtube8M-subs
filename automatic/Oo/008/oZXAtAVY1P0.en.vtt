here<00:00:11.429> to<00:00:11.759> kind<00:00:12.179> of<00:00:12.210> get<00:00:12.330> first<00:00:12.540> impressions

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:13.160 
here to kind of get first impressions

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.279 
here to kind of get first impressions
there's<00:00:14.160> the<00:00:14.400> rear<00:00:14.610> 200<00:00:15.210> meter<00:00:15.360> to<00:00:15.599> 600<00:00:16.139> meter

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
there's the rear 200 meter to 600 meter

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.000 
there's the rear 200 meter to 600 meter
and<00:00:17.039> here's<00:00:17.460> the<00:00:17.580> prone<00:00:18.680> as<00:00:19.680> you<00:00:19.800> can<00:00:19.920> tell

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
and here's the prone as you can tell

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.200 
and here's the prone as you can tell
they're<00:00:20.130> pretty<00:00:20.310> small

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
they're pretty small

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.210 
they're pretty small
they're<00:00:21.960> real<00:00:22.140> low<00:00:22.289> profile<00:00:22.740> they're<00:00:22.980> really

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
they're real low profile they're really

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:29.630 
they're real low profile they're really
light<00:00:24.050> same<00:00:25.050> with<00:00:25.170> the<00:00:25.289> rear<00:00:26.359> you<00:00:27.359> get<00:00:27.510> a<00:00:28.640> good

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
light same with the rear you get a good

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.840 
light same with the rear you get a good
Nam<00:00:30.830> one<00:00:31.830> thing<00:00:31.980> I<00:00:32.040> noticed<00:00:32.369> and<00:00:32.489> you<00:00:32.550> can<00:00:32.669> tell

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
Nam one thing I noticed and you can tell

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.139 
Nam one thing I noticed and you can tell
when<00:00:33.030> I<00:00:33.059> flip<00:00:33.270> this<00:00:33.360> up<00:00:33.920> this<00:00:34.920> knob<00:00:35.219> here<00:00:35.250> moves

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
when I flip this up this knob here moves

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.790 
when I flip this up this knob here moves
slightly<00:00:36.450> it<00:00:37.020> doesn't<00:00:37.320> move<00:00:37.410> patch<00:00:37.620> the

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
slightly it doesn't move patch the

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.220 
slightly it doesn't move patch the
notches<00:00:38.040> itself<00:00:38.550> but<00:00:38.790> it<00:00:38.879> does<00:00:39.030> move<00:00:39.270> and<00:00:40.050> it

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
notches itself but it does move and it

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.630 
notches itself but it does move and it
seems<00:00:40.410> to<00:00:40.500> be<00:00:40.559> pretty<00:00:40.649> consistent<00:00:40.860> I<00:00:41.430> don't

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
seems to be pretty consistent I don't

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:42.709 
seems to be pretty consistent I don't
think<00:00:41.760> it's<00:00:41.850> gonna<00:00:41.940> affect<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.270> accuracy<00:00:42.480> at

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
think it's gonna affect the accuracy at

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.270 
think it's gonna affect the accuracy at
all<00:00:44.270> the<00:00:45.270> 200<00:00:45.780> meter<00:00:45.899> to<00:00:46.320> 600<00:00:46.890> meter<00:00:47.010> rear

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
all the 200 meter to 600 meter rear

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.130 
all the 200 meter to 600 meter rear
sight<00:00:47.550> zeroes<00:00:48.360> on<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.570> left<00:00:48.750> hand<00:00:48.870> side

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
sight zeroes on the left hand side

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.990 
sight zeroes on the left hand side
there's<00:00:49.410> a<00:00:49.440> little<00:00:49.620> arrow<00:00:49.860> there<00:00:49.980> and<00:00:50.340> you

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
there's a little arrow there and you

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.639 
there's a little arrow there and you
match<00:00:51.180> your<00:00:51.390> range<00:00:51.780> up<00:00:52.020> with<00:00:52.170> this<00:00:52.289> arrow<00:00:52.530> on

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
match your range up with this arrow on

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.110 
match your range up with this arrow on
the<00:00:52.739> left<00:00:52.980> which<00:00:53.520> I<00:00:53.640> thought<00:00:53.760> was<00:00:53.879> a<00:00:53.940> little

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
the left which I thought was a little

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.420 
the left which I thought was a little
bit<00:00:54.300> weird<00:00:54.510> up<00:00:54.600> here<00:00:54.629> to<00:00:54.840> be<00:00:54.930> in<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.079> back<00:00:55.430> but

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
bit weird up here to be in the back but

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.709 
bit weird up here to be in the back but
uh<00:00:56.489> yeah<00:00:57.059> it<00:00:57.120> goes<00:00:57.239> from<00:00:57.710> 200<00:00:59.359> left<00:01:00.359> all<00:01:00.629> the

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
uh yeah it goes from 200 left all the

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.090 
uh yeah it goes from 200 left all the
way<00:01:00.750> up<00:01:00.899> to<00:01:02.090> 600<00:01:03.090> meters<00:01:03.329> a<00:01:03.710> little<00:01:04.710> past<00:01:04.890> six

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
way up to 600 meters a little past six

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.050 
way up to 600 meters a little past six
honor<00:01:05.250> I<00:01:05.339> don't<00:01:05.489> know<00:01:05.549> if<00:01:05.610> it's<00:01:05.729> a<00:01:05.790> cure<00:01:05.939> past

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
honor I don't know if it's a cure past

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:06.469 
honor I don't know if it's a cure past
ten

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
ten

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.500 
ten
all<00:01:06.720> these<00:01:06.960> are<00:01:07.140> averaged<00:01:07.530> so<00:01:07.830> you'll<00:01:08.010> be

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:08.510 
all these are averaged so you'll be

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.420 
all these are averaged so you'll be
roughly<00:01:09.510> they<00:01:09.689> said<00:01:09.990> one<00:01:10.680> click<00:01:10.890> up<00:01:11.070> one<00:01:11.250> click

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
roughly they said one click up one click

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.640 
roughly they said one click up one click
down<00:01:11.640> at<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.420> range<00:01:12.600> you<00:01:13.260> kind<00:01:13.439> of<00:01:13.500> got<00:01:13.619> a

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
down at the range you kind of got a

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.410 
down at the range you kind of got a
depend<00:01:14.040> on<00:01:14.100> your<00:01:14.220> hand<00:01:14.369> on<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.670> weapon<00:01:15.060> itself

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
depend on your hand on the weapon itself

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.730 
depend on your hand on the weapon itself
you<00:01:15.540> got<00:01:15.689> a<00:01:15.720> shoot<00:01:16.080> and<00:01:16.200> find<00:01:16.380> out<00:01:16.470> what<00:01:16.590> your

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
you got a shoot and find out what your

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.010 
you got a shoot and find out what your
at<00:01:17.299> the<00:01:18.299> front<00:01:18.650> is<00:01:19.909> the<00:01:20.909> front<00:01:21.869> sight<00:01:21.990> post

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
at the front is the front sight post

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.429 
at the front is the front sight post
itself<00:01:22.470> is<00:01:22.619> very<00:01:22.950> thin<00:01:23.670> I'd<00:01:24.000> say<00:01:24.150> it's<00:01:24.270> about

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:24.439 
itself is very thin I'd say it's about

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:27.020 
itself is very thin I'd say it's about
75%<00:01:25.439> it's<00:01:25.860> thin<00:01:25.979> as<00:01:26.100> a<00:01:26.130> regular<00:01:26.400> 82<00:01:26.729> which<00:01:26.939> I

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
75% it's thin as a regular 82 which I

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:27.649 
75% it's thin as a regular 82 which I
thought<00:01:27.150> was<00:01:27.240> awesome

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
thought was awesome

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.319 
thought was awesome
I<00:01:27.840> like<00:01:28.350> that<00:01:28.530> in<00:01:28.829> the<00:01:29.549> sight<00:01:29.729> picture<00:01:29.850> itself

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
I like that in the sight picture itself

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.140 
I like that in the sight picture itself
because<00:01:31.220> little<00:01:32.220> difference<00:01:32.579> not<00:01:32.729> not<00:01:33.000> like<00:01:33.119> a

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
because little difference not not like a

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.749 
because little difference not not like a
knee<00:01:33.299> -<00:01:33.450> a<00:01:33.920> little<00:01:34.920> bit<00:01:35.040> wider<00:01:35.280> maybe<00:01:35.520> on<00:01:35.700> the

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
knee - a little bit wider maybe on the

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.200 
knee - a little bit wider maybe on the
outside<00:01:35.790> on<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:37.170> ears<00:01:37.880> so<00:01:38.880> we'll<00:01:39.090> she

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
outside on the the ears so we'll she

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:59.340 
outside on the the ears so we'll she
didn't<00:01:39.390> see<00:01:39.509> what<00:01:39.630> I<00:01:39.659> liked<00:01:39.840> it

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.350 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.409
