00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
Naked palette which I feel like I

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.290 
Naked palette which I feel like I
haven't<00:00:19.080> used<00:00:19.380> in<00:00:19.529> ages<00:00:19.770> and<00:00:20.310> I<00:00:20.760> saw<00:00:21.000> it<00:00:21.150> and

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
haven't used in ages and I saw it and

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.300 
haven't used in ages and I saw it and
was<00:00:21.449> like<00:00:21.480> I<00:00:21.869> need<00:00:22.109> to<00:00:22.410> use<00:00:22.560> this<00:00:22.710> palette<00:00:22.949> it

was<00:00:23.640> once<00:00:23.850> my<00:00:24.060> child<00:00:24.390> what<00:00:24.750> happened<00:00:25.170> so<00:00:25.590> I

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
was once my child what happened so I

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.620 
was once my child what happened so I
thought<00:00:25.980> I'd<00:00:26.099> give<00:00:26.250> it<00:00:26.279> another<00:00:26.430> go<00:00:26.760> and<00:00:27.090> pause

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
thought I'd give it another go and pause

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
I've just fallen in love with it again

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.880 
I've just fallen in love with it again
anyway<00:00:29.820> I<00:00:29.939> just<00:00:30.179> applied<00:00:30.750> that<00:00:30.960> in<00:00:31.230> the<00:00:31.560> center

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
anyway I just applied that in the center

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.650 
anyway I just applied that in the center
of<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.130> lid<00:00:32.340> and<00:00:32.579> then<00:00:32.880> I'm<00:00:33.210> going<00:00:33.480> in<00:00:33.630> with

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
of the lid and then I'm going in with

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:43.349 
of the lid and then I'm going in with
half-baked<00:00:34.290> in<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:34.829> inner<00:00:35.040> third

00:00:43.349 --> 00:00:43.359 

00:00:43.359 --> 00:00:45.869 

next<00:00:44.140> I'm<00:00:44.289> applying<00:00:44.469> buck<00:00:44.949> on<00:00:45.249> the<00:00:45.670> outer

00:00:45.869 --> 00:00:45.879 
next I'm applying buck on the outer

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:47.669 
next I'm applying buck on the outer
third<00:00:46.120> and<00:00:46.480> then<00:00:46.690> blending<00:00:47.230> that<00:00:47.350> through<00:00:47.559> the

00:00:47.669 --> 00:00:47.679 
third and then blending that through the

00:00:47.679 --> 00:00:49.500 
third and then blending that through the
socket<00:00:48.070> I<00:00:48.250> don't<00:00:48.850> want<00:00:49.059> this<00:00:49.179> to<00:00:49.329> be<00:00:49.420> an

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:49.510 
socket I don't want this to be an

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:52.079 
socket I don't want this to be an
intense<00:00:49.809> smoke<00:00:50.140> out<00:00:50.379> and<00:00:50.800> it<00:00:51.280> looks<00:00:51.550> mostly

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:52.089 
intense smoke out and it looks mostly

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:54.630 
intense smoke out and it looks mostly
about<00:00:52.269> the<00:00:52.420> purple<00:00:52.780> liner<00:00:53.019> so<00:00:53.559> this<00:00:54.250> is<00:00:54.399> just

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:54.640 
about the purple liner so this is just

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.779 
about the purple liner so this is just
intended<00:00:55.120> to<00:00:55.359> add<00:00:55.570> shape<00:00:55.899> and<00:00:56.140> definition

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
intended to add shape and definition

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:04.320 
intended to add shape and definition
kind<00:00:57.789> of<00:00:57.879> like<00:00:58.000> a<00:00:58.030> contour<00:00:58.479> I<00:01:03.000> have<00:01:04.000> to<00:01:04.119> place

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:04.330 
kind of like a contour I have to place

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.539 
kind of like a contour I have to place
my<00:01:04.539> top<00:01:04.780> wing<00:01:05.080> quite<00:01:05.619> far<00:01:05.890> down<00:01:05.920> underneath

00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:06.549 
my top wing quite far down underneath

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:08.550 
my top wing quite far down underneath
the<00:01:06.850> crease<00:01:07.030> of<00:01:07.090> my<00:01:07.360> eyelid<00:01:07.780> at<00:01:07.930> the<00:01:08.049> edge<00:01:08.200> to

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:08.560 
the crease of my eyelid at the edge to

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.800 
the crease of my eyelid at the edge to
avoid<00:01:08.860> it<00:01:09.070> cutting<00:01:09.490> in<00:01:09.610> half<00:01:09.789> not<00:01:10.360> being<00:01:10.600> a

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:10.810 
avoid it cutting in half not being a

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.320 
avoid it cutting in half not being a
straight<00:01:11.110> line<00:01:11.289> anymore<00:01:11.590> so<00:01:12.460> I<00:01:12.789> can't<00:01:13.060> do<00:01:13.240> the

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:13.330 
straight line anymore so I can't do the

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.210 
straight line anymore so I can't do the
continuation<00:01:13.810> from<00:01:14.289> my<00:01:14.409> waterline<00:01:14.890> thing

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:15.220 
continuation from my waterline thing

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.639 
continuation from my waterline thing
that<00:01:15.399> people<00:01:15.610> do<00:01:15.940> instead<00:01:16.270> I<00:01:17.140> have<00:01:17.319> to<00:01:17.440> pull<00:01:17.619> it

00:01:17.639 --> 00:01:17.649 
that people do instead I have to pull it

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:20.100 
that people do instead I have to pull it
down<00:01:17.890> a<00:01:17.920> bit<00:01:18.069> more<00:01:18.399> at<00:01:18.549> the<00:01:18.580> edge<00:01:18.759> like<00:01:19.149> this<00:01:19.420> to

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.110 
down a bit more at the edge like this to

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:22.080 
down a bit more at the edge like this to
make<00:01:20.229> it<00:01:20.380> look<00:01:20.530> like<00:01:20.649> a<00:01:20.710> continuous<00:01:21.280> line<00:01:21.549> but

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.090 
make it look like a continuous line but

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:23.820 
make it look like a continuous line but
also<00:01:22.330> so<00:01:22.840> it<00:01:22.959> sits<00:01:23.170> underneath<00:01:23.470> the<00:01:23.679> wing

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:23.830 
also so it sits underneath the wing

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:29.789 
also so it sits underneath the wing
properly<00:01:27.330> thanks<00:01:28.390> and<00:01:28.569> taking<00:01:28.899> flash<00:01:29.200> on<00:01:29.530> an

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:29.799 
properly thanks and taking flash on an

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:31.649 
properly thanks and taking flash on an
angled<00:01:30.190> brush<00:01:30.429> and<00:01:30.700> then<00:01:31.119> just<00:01:31.360> letting<00:01:31.509> the

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:31.659 
angled brush and then just letting the

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:33.749 
angled brush and then just letting the
liner<00:01:31.869> in<00:01:32.049> place<00:01:32.200> and<00:01:32.619> intensifying<00:01:33.490> that

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:33.759 
liner in place and intensifying that

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:35.520 
liner in place and intensifying that
color<00:01:33.970> and<00:01:34.299> of<00:01:34.420> course<00:01:34.630> the<00:01:34.780> liner<00:01:34.990> can<00:01:35.229> be<00:01:35.319> any

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
color and of course the liner can be any

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:36.990 
color and of course the liner can be any
color<00:01:35.770> one<00:01:36.130> I<00:01:36.369> think<00:01:36.459> this<00:01:36.759> would<00:01:36.970> look

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.000 
color one I think this would look

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.809 
color one I think this would look
awesome<00:01:37.479> in<00:01:37.929> blue<00:01:38.110> and<00:01:38.259> yellow<00:01:38.440> too<00:01:38.649> and<00:01:39.220> even

00:01:39.809 --> 00:01:39.819 
awesome in blue and yellow too and even

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:41.429 
awesome in blue and yellow too and even
green<00:01:40.060> I<00:01:40.330> really<00:01:40.659> want<00:01:40.780> to<00:01:40.869> try<00:01:41.020> it<00:01:41.080> with<00:01:41.140> just

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:41.439 
green I really want to try it with just

green I really want to try it with just
loads<00:01:41.920> of<00:01:42.130> color<00:01:42.310> not<00:01:43.060> a<00:01:43.090> lot<00:01:43.270> ones<00:01:43.450> that<00:01:43.750> might

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:58.770 

I<00:01:56.460> didn't<00:01:57.460> notice<00:01:57.580> my<00:01:57.820> camera<00:01:58.210> had<00:01:58.420> switched

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
I didn't notice my camera had switched

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.260 
I didn't notice my camera had switched
off<00:01:58.990> so<00:01:59.260> part<00:01:59.830> of<00:01:59.890> my<00:02:00.040> eyeliner<00:02:00.400> is<00:02:00.640> already

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270
