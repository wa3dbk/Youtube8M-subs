actually looks are kind of largely right

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.630 
actually looks are kind of largely right
there<00:00:24.060> but<00:00:24.300> the<00:00:25.199> point<00:00:25.500> remains<00:00:25.619> the<00:00:26.070> same<00:00:26.340> and

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
there but the point remains the same and

minds<00:00:52.170> around<00:00:52.440> it<00:00:53.010> just<00:00:53.340> frustrates

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:54.110 
minds around it just frustrates

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:56.209 
minds around it just frustrates
everybody<00:00:55.110> when<00:00:55.379> you're<00:00:55.500> in<00:00:55.620> your<00:00:55.649> base<00:00:55.949> you

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
everybody when you're in your base you

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:57.439 
everybody when you're in your base you
hop<00:00:56.399> in<00:00:56.550> a<00:00:56.610> vehicle<00:00:56.789> and<00:00:57.030> then<00:00:57.210> you<00:00:57.270> suddenly

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
hop in a vehicle and then you suddenly

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.260 
hop in a vehicle and then you suddenly
blow<00:00:57.780> up<00:00:57.989> and<00:00:58.320> it<00:00:58.680> can<00:00:58.859> be<00:00:58.980> a<00:00:59.010> cheap<00:00:59.280> tactic<00:00:59.820> and

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
blow up and it can be a cheap tactic and

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.729 
blow up and it can be a cheap tactic and
if<00:01:00.449> it's<00:01:00.629> all<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:00.840> way<00:01:01.020> back<00:01:01.230> like<00:01:01.500> in<00:01:01.620> their

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
if it's all the way back like in their

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.179 
if it's all the way back like in their
spawn<00:01:02.160> then<00:01:02.789> I'm<00:01:02.910> not<00:01:03.059> cool<00:01:03.300> with<00:01:03.359> it<00:01:04.189> because

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
spawn then I'm not cool with it because

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.460 
spawn then I'm not cool with it because
I<00:01:05.339> think<00:01:05.549> that<00:01:05.670> is<00:01:05.880> actually<00:01:06.510> very<00:01:06.780> lame<00:01:07.260> but

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
I think that is actually very lame but

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:08.990 
I think that is actually very lame but
if<00:01:07.560> it's<00:01:07.680> around<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:08.010> flag<00:01:08.250> or<00:01:08.520> something<00:01:08.850> you

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
if it's around the flag or something you

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.270 
if it's around the flag or something you
know<00:01:09.030> all's<00:01:09.450> fair<00:01:09.720> in<00:01:09.750> love<00:01:10.110> and<00:01:10.500> war<00:01:10.530> there<00:01:10.860> in

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
know all's fair in love and war there in

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.850 
know all's fair in love and war there in
my<00:01:11.490> opinion<00:01:11.790> but<00:01:12.600> I'm<00:01:13.409> not<00:01:13.530> even<00:01:13.680> doing<00:01:13.799> that

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
my opinion but I'm not even doing that

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.130

or anything lame like that I'm just
floating<00:01:49.320> around<00:01:49.530> their<00:01:49.740> base<00:01:49.890> you<00:01:50.040> don't<00:01:50.130> sit

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
floating around their base you don't sit

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.580 
floating around their base you don't sit
in<00:01:50.430> one<00:01:50.520> spot<00:01:50.579> too<00:01:51.000> long<00:01:51.210> I<00:01:51.420> love<00:01:51.810> recon<00:01:52.259> class

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
in one spot too long I love recon class

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.219 
in one spot too long I love recon class
for<00:01:52.950> this<00:01:53.159> strategy<00:01:53.909> because<00:01:54.270> not<00:01:54.990> only<00:01:55.020> is

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
for this strategy because not only is

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:56.510 
for this strategy because not only is
the<00:01:55.350> spawn<00:01:55.590> be<00:01:55.799> can<00:01:55.950> get<00:01:56.100> you<00:01:56.159> back<00:01:56.340> there

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
the spawn be can get you back there

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.450 
the spawn be can get you back there
quickly<00:01:56.700> but<00:01:57.540> the<00:01:57.719> tugs<00:01:58.079> or<00:01:58.439> math<00:01:58.680> is<00:01:59.009> a<00:01:59.040> great

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
quickly but the tugs or math is a great

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.490 
quickly but the tugs or math is a great
way<00:01:59.670> to<00:01:59.729> kind<00:02:00.180> of<00:02:00.329> have<00:02:00.509> an<00:02:00.630> edge<00:02:00.810> on<00:02:01.200> them

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
way to kind of have an edge on them

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.289 
way to kind of have an edge on them
while<00:02:02.399> you're<00:02:02.520> in<00:02:02.610> their<00:02:02.729> base<00:02:02.880> now<00:02:03.060> you<00:02:03.180> see

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
while you're in their base now you see

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.240 
while you're in their base now you see
right<00:02:03.450> here<00:02:03.689> I<00:02:03.750> take<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:04.680> flag<00:02:04.860> to<00:02:05.040> go<00:02:05.130> back

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
right here I take the flag to go back

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.340 
right here I take the flag to go back
and<00:02:05.280> score<00:02:05.670> and<00:02:06.570> so<00:02:06.689> doing<00:02:06.899> the<00:02:06.960> strategy

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
and score and so doing the strategy

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.809 
and score and so doing the strategy
obviously<00:02:07.469> doesn't<00:02:07.950> mean<00:02:08.099> you're<00:02:08.310> limited<00:02:08.789> to

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
obviously doesn't mean you're limited to

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.900 
obviously doesn't mean you're limited to
just<00:02:09.060> that<00:02:09.330> I<00:02:09.599> was<00:02:10.200> being<00:02:10.979> the<00:02:11.220> tiny<00:02:11.610> annoying
