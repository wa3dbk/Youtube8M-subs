little bit the key switch here I don't
know<00:00:12.660> it<00:00:12.750> was<00:00:12.840> like<00:00:12.870> dented<00:00:13.320> for<00:00:13.679> some<00:00:13.830> reason

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.950 
no no why we went a flat so I had a head
flatten<00:00:16.680> it<00:00:16.770> with<00:00:16.800> a<00:00:16.949> hammer<00:00:17.690> they<00:00:18.690> sell<00:00:18.930> a

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
flatten it with a hammer they sell a

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.550 
flatten it with a hammer they sell a
hammer<00:00:19.740> like<00:00:19.949> this<00:00:20.100> it's<00:00:20.369> for<00:00:20.580> bodywork<00:00:21.560> you

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
hammer like this it's for bodywork you

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.429 
hammer like this it's for bodywork you
know<00:00:22.680> flat<00:00:23.660> so<00:00:24.660> I<00:00:24.689> straightened<00:00:25.080> it<00:00:25.109> with<00:00:25.260> that

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
know flat so I straightened it with that

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.470 
know flat so I straightened it with that
and<00:00:26.160> then<00:00:26.279> it<00:00:26.400> was<00:00:26.519> pretty<00:00:26.789> much<00:00:26.939> straight<00:00:27.300> but

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
and then it was pretty much straight but

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.269 
and then it was pretty much straight but
then<00:00:27.630> I<00:00:27.840> had<00:00:28.260> like<00:00:28.380> dimples<00:00:28.800> from<00:00:28.890> the<00:00:29.070> hammer

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
then I had like dimples from the hammer

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.389 
then I had like dimples from the hammer
and<00:00:30.140> again<00:00:31.140> instead<00:00:31.349> of<00:00:31.470> using<00:00:31.650> bondo<00:00:32.160> I<00:00:32.189> used

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
and again instead of using bondo I used

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.630 
and again instead of using bondo I used
jb<00:00:32.910> weld<00:00:33.260> and<00:00:34.260> I<00:00:34.380> just<00:00:34.590> smooth<00:00:34.860> it<00:00:35.040> out<00:00:35.130> you

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
jb weld and I just smooth it out you

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.000 
jb weld and I just smooth it out you
know<00:00:35.760> I<00:00:35.790> see<00:00:36.120> a<00:00:36.180> real<00:00:36.390> thin<00:00:36.630> just<00:00:37.110> kind<00:00:37.950> of

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
know I see a real thin just kind of

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.850 
know I see a real thin just kind of
cover<00:00:38.190> it<00:00:38.370> and<00:00:38.910> then<00:00:38.940> I<00:00:39.090> feathered<00:00:39.510> it<00:00:39.860> you

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
cover it and then I feathered it you

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.119 
cover it and then I feathered it you
know<00:00:41.010> with<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.219> palm<00:00:41.399> sander<00:00:41.700> you<00:00:42.980> know<00:00:43.980> like

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
know with the palm sander you know like

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.779 
know with the palm sander you know like
this<00:00:44.340> this<00:00:45.030> one<00:00:45.270> this<00:00:45.960> one<00:00:46.140> oscillates<00:00:46.789> it

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
this this one this one oscillates it

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.520 
this this one this one oscillates it
goes<00:00:48.420> you<00:00:48.719> know<00:00:48.840> circular<00:00:49.230> but<00:00:49.379> it<00:00:49.440> also

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
goes you know circular but it also

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.799 
goes you know circular but it also
rotates<00:00:49.879> so<00:00:50.879> that<00:00:51.059> way<00:00:51.239> you<00:00:51.300> don't<00:00:51.449> get<00:00:51.660> like

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
rotates so that way you don't get like

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.610 
rotates so that way you don't get like
scratch<00:00:52.140> marks<00:00:52.469> but<00:00:53.340> anyway<00:00:54.260> if<00:00:55.260> you<00:00:55.410> do

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
scratch marks but anyway if you do

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.889 
scratch marks but anyway if you do
bodywork<00:00:56.100> it's<00:00:57.030> always<00:00:57.270> good<00:00:57.390> to<00:00:57.420> after<00:00:57.840> you

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
bodywork it's always good to after you

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.750 
bodywork it's always good to after you
get<00:00:58.020> done<00:00:58.170> when<00:00:58.320> you're<00:00:58.410> sanding<00:00:58.590> it<00:00:58.859> to<00:00:59.579> run

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
get done when you're sanding it to run

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.450 
get done when you're sanding it to run
your<00:00:59.879> hand<00:01:00.090> across<00:01:00.329> it<00:01:01.160> because<00:01:02.160> you<00:01:02.250> could<00:01:02.370> be

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
your hand across it because you could be

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.100 
your hand across it because you could be
surprised<00:01:02.730> what<00:01:02.910> you<00:01:02.969> can<00:01:03.030> feel<00:01:03.300> if<00:01:03.840> you<00:01:03.989> can

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
surprised what you can feel if you can

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.770 
surprised what you can feel if you can
feel<00:01:04.439> that<00:01:05.210> like<00:01:06.210> if<00:01:06.360> it<00:01:06.450> doesn't<00:01:06.689> feel

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
feel that like if it doesn't feel

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.890 
feel that like if it doesn't feel
totally<00:01:07.049> flat<00:01:08.090> and<00:01:09.090> you<00:01:09.240> can<00:01:09.360> still<00:01:09.570> feel<00:01:09.750> it

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
totally flat and you can still feel it

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:10.760 
totally flat and you can still feel it
when<00:01:10.020> you<00:01:10.080> run<00:01:10.170> your<00:01:10.290> hand<00:01:10.409> across<00:01:10.500> that

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
when you run your hand across that

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.170 
when you run your hand across that
you're<00:01:10.920> going<00:01:11.070> to<00:01:11.100> see<00:01:11.369> it<00:01:11.520> in<00:01:11.640> your<00:01:11.790> paint<00:01:11.970> job

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
you're going to see it in your paint job

so keep working at it until when you
when<00:01:15.330> you<00:01:15.450> when<00:01:15.479> you<00:01:15.780> feather<00:01:16.049> it<00:01:16.200> enough

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
when you when you feather it enough

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:17.690 
when you when you feather it enough
where<00:01:16.590> you<00:01:16.680> can<00:01:16.799> run<00:01:16.920> your<00:01:17.040> hand<00:01:17.250> across<00:01:17.340> it

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
where you can run your hand across it

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.550 
where you can run your hand across it
and<00:01:18.090> it<00:01:18.540> doesn't<00:01:18.840> even<00:01:18.869> feel<00:01:19.049> like<00:01:19.110> it's<00:01:19.200> there

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
and it doesn't even feel like it's there

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.300 
and it doesn't even feel like it's there
and<00:01:20.400> you<00:01:20.460> um<00:01:21.000> then<00:01:21.360> you<00:01:21.390> know<00:01:22.070> you<00:01:23.070> know<00:01:23.189> you're

ten minutes before you spray it so I'm
just<00:03:31.500> going<00:03:31.680> to<00:03:31.739> stir<00:03:31.980> it

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.750 

it's<00:03:34.849> pretty<00:03:35.060> thin<00:03:35.920> when<00:03:36.920> you<00:03:37.310> want<00:03:37.459> it<00:03:37.519> thin

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:40.459 
so you can spray it but you don't want a

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:41.770 
so you can spray it but you don't want a
toothed<00:03:40.670> bin<00:03:40.940> because<00:03:41.180> then<00:03:41.360> it's<00:03:41.569> enough

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
toothed bin because then it's enough

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:48.280
