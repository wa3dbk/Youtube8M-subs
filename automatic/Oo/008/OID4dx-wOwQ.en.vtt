 windows seven premium and with 64 bits 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:47.520
 we need to know how much 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:54.150
 here this program will be more vitalizing 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:56.480
 in Spanish we are going to download the video 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:59.899

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.060
 language 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:23.270
 is this if your 64 bit windows 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:26.509

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:30.190
 pack or from this view of this list and 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:34.960
 for windows 32 64 bits 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:38.280
 sp1 rtm s test 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.280
 here we are going to look 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:47.920
 a strange language 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:53.740
 which was 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.740
 here 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.940

 to the expert 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.090
 and if you want to put it in English 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.580
 also what they have to do was 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:21.840
 search the world in English 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.840

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:33.400
 we hope it will be late 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:33.400
 language one minute 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:41.500
 then it appears around 2 mb 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.500
