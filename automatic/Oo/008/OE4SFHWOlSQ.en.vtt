00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.890 
yeah red eyeshadow or Rouge blush and
blend<00:02:59.890> it<00:03:00.010> really<00:03:00.280> well<00:03:00.519> and<00:03:00.790> make<00:03:01.450> it<00:03:01.630> you

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
blend it really well and make it you

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.100 
blend it really well and make it you
might<00:03:02.079> also<00:03:02.470> consider<00:03:03.430> adding<00:03:03.880> water<00:03:04.150> if<00:03:04.450> it's

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110
