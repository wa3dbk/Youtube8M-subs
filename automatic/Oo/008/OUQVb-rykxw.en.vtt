00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
on here to make the s most simple way

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:33.970 
on here to make the s most simple way
instead<00:02:32.660> of<00:02:32.720> trying<00:02:33.230> to<00:02:33.290> figure<00:02:33.560> out<00:02:33.590> and<00:02:33.860> make

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
instead of trying to figure out and make

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.320 
instead of trying to figure out and make
it<00:02:34.130> somehow<00:02:35.709> like<00:02:36.709> again<00:02:37.040> you<00:02:37.430> just<00:02:37.640> line<00:02:38.300> it

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
it somehow like again you just line it

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:45.920 
it somehow like again you just line it
up<00:02:38.599> with<00:02:38.900> seven<00:02:39.770> this<00:02:39.950> time

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:53.980 

make<00:02:46.590> sure<00:02:46.620> it<00:02:46.890> has<00:02:46.980> the<00:02:47.010> same<00:02:47.310> space

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:53.990 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:03:02.220 

okay<00:02:55.810> push<00:02:56.810> the<00:02:56.990> stage<00:02:57.290> row<00:02:57.470> 7<00:02:57.920> over<00:02:58.100> a<00:02:58.340> bit

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.320

okay then we are going to get a

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.550 
okay then we are going to get a
rectangular<00:03:07.330> medium<00:03:07.750> piece<00:03:08.110> this<00:03:08.319> is<00:03:08.440> going

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
rectangular medium piece this is going

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:15.800 
rectangular medium piece this is going
to<00:03:08.620> fill<00:03:08.890> the<00:03:09.510> seventh<00:03:10.510> make<00:03:11.110> it<00:03:11.230> look<00:03:11.349> like<00:03:11.500> a
