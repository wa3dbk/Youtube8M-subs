I<00:03:04.050> don't<00:03:04.860> think<00:03:04.920> you<00:03:05.100> can<00:03:05.250> find<00:03:05.430> any<00:03:05.700> sort<00:03:06.060> of

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
I don't think you can find any sort of

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:07.700 
I don't think you can find any sort of
media<00:03:06.420> out<00:03:06.720> there<00:03:06.750> whether<00:03:07.140> it's<00:03:07.320> movies

media out there whether it's movies

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:10.040 
media out there whether it's movies
whether<00:03:07.980> it's<00:03:08.190> records<00:03:08.610> or<00:03:08.790> whatever<00:03:09.050> that

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
whether it's records or whatever that
