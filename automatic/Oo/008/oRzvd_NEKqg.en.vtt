I think it's a little bit different than

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:46.899 
I think it's a little bit different than
the<00:04:44.240> last<00:04:44.419> one<00:04:44.659> this<00:04:44.780> has<00:04:45.020> a<00:04:45.460> tiny<00:04:46.460> bit<00:04:46.880> more

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:50.970 
close and personal

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:53.780 
close and personal
um<00:04:51.090> but<00:04:51.870> overall<00:04:52.260> it's<00:04:52.680> like<00:04:52.860> a<00:04:52.950> nice<00:04:53.190> like

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:53.790

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:03.810 
um I'll probably keep playing with a

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:05.420 
um I'll probably keep playing with a
bang<00:05:04.050> a<00:05:04.290> little<00:05:04.530> bit<00:05:04.650> more<00:05:04.890> here<00:05:05.220> and<00:05:05.310> there

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:05.430 
bang a little bit more here and there

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:07.610 
bang a little bit more here and there
just<00:05:05.640> try<00:05:05.820> to<00:05:05.880> get<00:05:06.030> it<00:05:06.180> to<00:05:06.300> look<00:05:06.590> the<00:05:07.590> most

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:07.620 
just try to get it to look the most

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:10.790 
just try to get it to look the most
natural<00:05:07.950> that<00:05:08.460> I<00:05:08.520> can<00:05:08.880> this<00:05:09.870> one<00:05:10.050> again<00:05:10.350> it's

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 
natural that I can this one again it's

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.710 
natural that I can this one again it's
because<00:05:11.190> of<00:05:11.310> the<00:05:11.400> bang<00:05:11.610> you<00:05:12.060> can<00:05:12.120> put<00:05:12.450> it<00:05:12.540> in<00:05:12.630> a

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:12.720 
because of the bang you can put it in a

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:17.300 
because of the bang you can put it in a
low<00:05:12.930> ponytail<00:05:14.210> it<00:05:15.210> have<00:05:15.420> to<00:05:15.570> be<00:05:15.660> low<00:05:16.310> and/or

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:17.310 
low ponytail it have to be low and/or

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:21.290 
low ponytail it have to be low and/or
possibly<00:05:17.910> like<00:05:18.420> if<00:05:18.540> you<00:05:18.630> put<00:05:18.870> it<00:05:18.960> up<00:05:20.120> you<00:05:21.120> kind

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:21.300 
possibly like if you put it up you kind

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:23.540 
possibly like if you put it up you kind
of<00:05:21.390> gather<00:05:21.630> the<00:05:21.900> hair<00:05:22.110> and<00:05:22.440> a<00:05:22.500> clip<00:05:22.830> you<00:05:23.160> could

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:23.550 
of gather the hair and a clip you could

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:25.130 
of gather the hair and a clip you could
probably<00:05:23.730> could<00:05:24.060> do<00:05:24.210> that<00:05:24.240> but<00:05:24.630> this<00:05:24.750> hair<00:05:25.020> is

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:25.140
