00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:07.279
 all over April, your husband is rubbish 

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:15.059
 My name is Maxim April I'm from the city 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:18.950
 Zhukova I was the first love in the first 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.950
 half a song is a reflection of my life 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.310
 by with you 

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:31.560
 they didn't turn off the swart 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:33.650
 everyone and played in the yard and I fell in love 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.350
 those blue eyes 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:38.370
 5 and hair from the bank 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:41.780
 on the head on 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.780
 bob just how to get 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:46.460
 no one offended you 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:49.750
 and gave 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.750
 all for and in the attic 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:56.230
 first time you kissed you then 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:58.300
 you and want or 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:02.700
 like each other love 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.700
 how did the tank not count with every finger 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:10.750
 when drying let's get lost now we 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.750
 with you 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.030
 the city is my boobs and 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:18.590
 don't pass 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:22.140
 yes who got lost being with you for 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:23.880
 not a word of chanterelles and 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.750
 which plant 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.750
 here we are with you 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.720
 they 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.640
 Maxim asked 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.359
 a striking similarity to timbre with 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:52.359
 the great Michael around it so 

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:54.399
 obliges you she obliges you so but i 

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:55.899
 I want to say that I am not disappointed then 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:58.119
 that the song is melodic 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:02:01.240
 in a manner of course you close your eyes and 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:04.060
 Misha you see God forbid you know very much 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:07.200
 great taste and talent to find your 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.200
 songs about power
