00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.309
 so and now I would like to add some more details 

00:00:12.319 --> 00:00:16.289
 Ostrom video cassettes and Nokia c6 achieve 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.900
 I have now here so it must be optimized and it is indeed so 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.060
 that you can also program the podcasts time for hours draw it 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.189
 I've found the podcasts the video cassette this quick launch bar 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:28.009
 placed 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:30.640
 so that her actress has access 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.710
 and around male animal daredevil on my podcast list 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.859
 that was here in this case 

00:00:37.859 --> 00:00:41.739
 Kotkai excellent can search me over the godfather options 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.570
 make settings here 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.190
 and with the setting I can both define the connection via which 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:50.230
 connection 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:51.400
 so to speak 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:55.030
 Bread box to be downloaded so I can limit Mr. that 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.120
 For example, you do not want to see it either concretely and otherwise 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.120
 if there are huge costs maybe incurred due to the data plan 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.540
 and i can also say download again when downloading and then hike 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.100
 should happen 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.600
 and also and where the polkas should be stored so here 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.150
 the memory card 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.550
 what's going on interval once a day 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:19.190
 then I can say it is from the instructions such as date and around 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:23.159
 Figurine and the download Limmat that is also quite interesting I can say 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.439
 so please after only so much federal swine flu to 75 percent 

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:29.870
 maximum is full and then stop 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:33.090
 Lord or ignore that, then you can adjust a lot when I am 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.880
 now made so that I just in the morning at three quarters 7 loads this 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.890
 Device automatically put my podcast under and if have already had breakfast 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.220
 everything directly on the device only the latest news the latest current 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.690
 Things and can do everything immediately so therefore the great thing if you have the 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:51.720
 Unfortunately, settings are not so obvious 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.790
 as I said in the video Kostas exactly the same 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:57.590
 I can go around her even if I go in here 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:59.090
 this is the survey 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.650
 so to speak the video Corsini options 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:03.870
 I can also here about the settings 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:08.060
 go in and say okay what network connection would be even 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:09.549
 Age restrictions 

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:13.469
 So there are already that the videos are suitable for the appropriate age 

00:02:13.469 --> 00:02:16.469
 preferred memory thumbnails version 

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:20.940
 I can then do all of these things and there too 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.099
 Time disturbed 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:25.249
 then stop 

00:02:25.249 --> 00:02:27.179
 Democrats in in the fields 

00:02:27.179 --> 00:02:28.969
 so 

00:02:28.969 --> 00:02:31.419
 that left the feeds and then options 

00:02:31.419 --> 00:02:34.419
 then I can here 

00:02:37.609 --> 00:02:41.329
 feat Arcos called the APUs disconnect so it goes here 

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:44.369
 that's for example for my recent broadcast with the mouse and then 

00:02:44.369 --> 00:02:46.659
 are you here 

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:48.089
 accordingly 

00:02:48.089 --> 00:02:52.089
 Fiete work a lot the parts are then I can do it all here also an opponent 

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:55.339
 So from there - I say that the whole network 

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:58.219
 What you have to do is just that the different ones 

00:02:58.219 --> 00:03:03.379
 Video formats are not fully displayable on this device so many are 

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:06.369
 really only suitable for a child such as 3sat 

00:03:06.369 --> 00:03:09.509
 a very Dieter Sander Videocast in my opinion 

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:13.619
 but unfortunately not directly displayed on the device or Gucci 2 2 2 

00:03:14.119 --> 00:03:17.749
 unfortunately on the Nokia c6 also not representable here must be refinished 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:23.650
 A nice program is also still under the come namely this percent 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:25.659
 as a test for that is mostly in USD 

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:28.720
 actually still for the version 3 of s 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.719
 Cisse 60 So it's six to six depths to say 

00:03:32.719 --> 00:03:34.899
 but it also works on this device 

00:03:34.899 --> 00:03:38.979
 Craig currently has the agony version of the full version you love 11 13 

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:40.169
 Euro approximately 

00:03:40.169 --> 00:03:44.159
 The Scenes One can here make a single single channel to Celles 

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:45.060
 A single one 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.699
 Felix define the one you subscribe to 

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:51.349
 can also specify there but how does me and Florian can also be combined 

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:54.359
 Gaiser really exciting really all the kids right on the device 

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:57.799
 Â«Furthermore, could also be without an Internet connection 

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:01.809
 "So the whole thing is looking at 3 great things now 

00:04:01.809 --> 00:04:05.069
 The video podcasts must risk the Normans and podcasts 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:07.979
 and I was almost all uncertainties to write 

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:11.149
 a note very briefly from the pot cash register video Kross 

00:04:11.149 --> 00:04:16.209
 Unfortunately I can also define Karsten Videocasts under the basket 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:19.560
 that works in the ZID synonymous videos under then treated them but how 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:20.650
 Audio Webcast 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:23.580
 but still I can look at them in the military 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.749
 In Tunisia should then a bit of coal was around 

00:04:26.749 --> 00:04:28.840
 you have to get used to that really 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:32.400
 Videocasts also with the videocasts to define itself at the podcast that is 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:32.819
 a 

00:04:32.819 --> 00:04:35.439
 since then has to keep thinking 

00:04:35.439 --> 00:04:38.339
 just a nice program, I can still lead the world 

00:04:38.339 --> 00:04:39.479
 percent 

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:40.460
 Dr 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:43.889
 Actimel here 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:45.529
 only very briefly the device 

00:04:45.529 --> 00:04:48.110
 really nice made 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:51.110
 and especially 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:54.569
 what they really are 

00:04:54.569 --> 00:04:57.949
 the clock area also runs the Potsdam deeper 

00:04:57.949 --> 00:05:02.250
 but he was still standing there without having pizza in the oven or 

00:05:02.249 --> 00:05:06.300
 needs my five-hour break and would like to set the alarm clock every time 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:07.830
 that one very good alternative 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:09.599
 the team then went very fast 

00:05:09.599 --> 00:05:13.439
 yes the first choice for this performance for more information on Nero and 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:19.410
 My work and Thun go under intuitive points or Hoffmann believes 

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:21.159
 a minus point in the de
