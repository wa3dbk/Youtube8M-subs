00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:33.820
 how are we all have new question 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:33.820
 the amino acids lose weight we go to 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.710
 amino acids and weight reduction 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:44.449
 i 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:48.019
 yes and not for example if we take the friend 

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:50.600
 faithful as an example that there are two 

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:53.540
 presentations there are a few lines of the 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:56.720
 label that says more that I would take it 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:59.059
 more when you're in a volume phase 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:02.300
 when you want to gain the weight I think that 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:04.729
 I would take it more but there is the link 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:10.040
 which is the one that I'm going to show you in 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:12.920
 same field link moso that I 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:18.130
 I recommend when one is in the phase of 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:21.380
 definition is going to help a lot because 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:23.300
 no longer just from business in particular 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.280
 from the same field I have already spoken in a 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.690
 video I invite you to the head but not 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.170
 I'm going to repeat the new 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:31.909
 information the amino acids I what 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.880
 I recommend consuming them during 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:38.690
 Exercise during your exercise routine 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:43.100
 or your weight routine and another take after 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:46.460
 in case you really during your day 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:48.920
 do not consume enough so 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:51.110
 say amino acids says it is true not 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:54.530
 as much meat as so much point because 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:56.470
 there really is a lot of food where 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:02:00.200
 they release these essential amino acids 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:04.120
 what brings them - phil but if the 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:08.149
 we can eat then without more 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:11.020
 I need I take the pleasant film 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:15.590
 during the exercise to conserve 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:18.080
 mainly energy and muscle me 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.330
 I wrote it down so I think I take that 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.310
 way I take it because it has 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:25.190
 operated in that way 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:28.040
 many on the label tells you that before 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:30.489
 during and after there are others that look so 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:33.800
 only later at night will it be 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:38.300
 depending much what your style of 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:41.180
 life and how you are with the product and 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:43.099
 be the minor or any the least is 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:46.010
 an excellent option but there are many 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:48.640
 fish in the market 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:51.410
 of supplements I talked about many 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:55.069
 amino acids I invite you to go to my 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:56.209
 channel but if I asked if they come down 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:59.299
 weight 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:04.100
 I would not take it as a supplement for 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:06.980
 lose weight itself I will not use the 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:10.069
 link that is this if it will help 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:13.849
 a lot to do a lot more muscle 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:17.330
 defined to scratch you completely but 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:20.480
 itself if we have a problem with the 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:22.670
 weight or overweight I do not think it's the 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.910
 ideal supplement 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:28.760
 in that mind I think yes and one 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:32.810
 you want to lose weight if you're already decided 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:35.930
 completely I first average by diet 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:39.080
 step number 1 diet second step I 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:44.180
 would go for the casting combined with the 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:45.860
 exercise and third and if they do not work 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:48.920
 in your first two steps that I finish you 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:52.959
 of giving I would opt later for a 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:55.610
 fat burner to see if ya 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:57.830
 potentiate the first two steps that 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:00.950
 we are giving not so much then it is for 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:03.680
 the magic powder skewer say the pill 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:05.780
 to burn fat then lick it double 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:08.480
 your guys at this moment no no no no 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:11.720
 you do not have to drop the egg in the 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:15.260
 fat burned hands 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:17.420
 already after a weight loss since 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:19.400
 You say you know low weight and now 

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:21.500
 I want to transform that weight 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:24.770
 muscle but defined in the case this is 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:27.050
 the prompt of a woman and there yes already you 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:30.340
 I could recommend the amino acids as 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:33.710
 the linen is like psa of health with 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:35.980
 any fall to the market but one 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:38.530
 excellent option is at least field 

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:43.320
 Personally, I like it personally 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:47.140
 a lot but if not to lose weight 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:49.650
 the truth is not going to help us much yet 

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:52.710
 if you bring carnitine 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:54.419
 I bring a very small dose then I do not 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:56.430
 it's going to work as much as to lower 

00:04:54.419 --> 00:05:00.539
 of weight I recommend you do the 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:04.550
 steps that I gave you a moment ago and 

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:07.700
 really with these steps you will see 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:10.580
 the results that you expect then there 

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:13.280
 is the review that you asked me well 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:17.000
 correct then forget any doubt 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:18.710
 any add-on there is my mail 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:22.810
 if you liked the video give me a like in 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:26.450
 the bolton that is in guided or first 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:30.470
 share a debate if you are not yet subscribed 

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:34.280
