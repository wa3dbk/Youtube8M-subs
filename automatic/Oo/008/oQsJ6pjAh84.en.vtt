00:00:00.000 --> 00:01:06.580
(music)  

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.440
Good morning everybody. 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.210
 Good morning. 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:14.230
All of you bikers, congratulations for getting here because if 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.050
you didn't get here, you wouldn't be here. 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.850
So bravo. 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:22.660
 This is my wife, Diane, and we had a great ride this morning. 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:28.480
 We live in Rockville, so we tooled down the Bethesda Trolley Trial 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.660
 --- about five miles. 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.610
 Beautiful ride, beautiful day...lots of people on the trial. 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.890
 We met a postdoc along the way from (NI)DDK so we all rode 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:41.410
together across all of those bridges, which are pretty amazing. 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.980
 And we just heard this morning that the Trolley Trial is going to be 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.280
completed in the next year all the way to NIH, so you don't have 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:50.790
 that funny ending. 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.200
(applause)

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.890
 So I usually ride to work on two wheels, but not the two wheels 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:02.790
I rode this morning.  Usually it's the Harley. 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:12.220
 Probably the Harley only exercises about one muscle, that's this one. 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.030
 Whereas what we were on today was clearly healthier. 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.050
 And around here with the way people support this kind of biking, 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:22.620
I think there's no reason not to get out there. 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.580
 So I'm really glad you all are part of this. 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.110
 I think after today, I'll be doing this a little more often because 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.100
it really is wonderful. 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.830
 And I have to go address the NIGMS Advisory Council 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:41.680
in a few minutes.  Do you think I'm dressed properly for that? 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.080
 Don't I look like a really authoritative figure that you would 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:49.010
trust to lead a 31 billion dollar organization? 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.990
 Yeah...sure. 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.780
(laughter) 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.870
 Well, fortunately there's a shower in the B2 level here...

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:57.800
although it's a little bit.... 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:59.870
  We won't go in to that. 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.060
 So I will try to look more respectable later on. 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.760
 But, what a great day. 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.280
 And thank you to all of those who've organized this. 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.150
 The club that's put together this effort. 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.810
 All of the flyers and the emails and the posters that you've sent out to 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:14.590
get everybody revved about this. 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.490
 Thanks to all the people helping, some of who are from my 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.430
 lab...Michelle, Peter. 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:21.980
 It's great to see you all here to be a part of this. 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.780
 So have a wonderful day and ride safe on the way home and let's do 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.750
this again as often as we can. 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:28.700
 Thank you all.

00:03:28.720 --> 00:05:10.980
