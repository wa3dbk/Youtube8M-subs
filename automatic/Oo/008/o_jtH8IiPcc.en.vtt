00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
brace steel and this is done so it can

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:59.539 
brace steel and this is done so it can
cut<00:02:58.500> down<00:02:58.620> on<00:02:58.769> a<00:02:58.829> bunch<00:02:59.010> of<00:02:59.099> the<00:02:59.220> weight<00:02:59.370> that

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
now this shares the exact same features

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.990 
now this shares the exact same features
as<00:03:40.109> the<00:03:40.590> two<00:03:40.739> previous<00:03:41.190> stands<00:03:41.549> we<00:03:41.669> just<00:03:41.849> went

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
as the two previous stands we just went

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.289 
as the two previous stands we just went
over<00:03:42.269> but<00:03:42.870> with<00:03:43.319> one<00:03:43.590> thing<00:03:43.949> missing<00:03:44.370> the<00:03:45.030> legs

00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:03.299 
isn't going to stand up by itself so it

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:04.789 
isn't going to stand up by itself so it
needs<00:04:03.419> a<00:04:03.480> little<00:04:03.510> help<00:04:03.720> you're<00:04:04.440> going<00:04:04.590> to<00:04:04.650> have
