00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.240
Today I cook Korean-style carrot.

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:06.360
There is no absolutely correct recipe for this salad.

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:10.270
However, there are some rules and technological features.

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:12.769
And though, it all depends on taste attachments.

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:16.279
It is like to pickle cabbage.

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:22.259
The principal ingredients: 500 g of carrots, 50-70 ml of vegetable oil,

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:27.800
1 tbsp of vinegar, 1 tbspn of sugar, 0.5 tsp of salt and red chilli pepper.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.120
To taste you can add garlic, coriander and black pepper.

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:36.800
Rub the carrot on special grater.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.130
It turns out long strips.

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:43.360
A coarse grater is not suitable.

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.590
Here are the strips.

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:52.080
In the grated carrots add sugar and salt.

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.460
Also vinegar.

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.630
These are the marinade ingredients.

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:01.320
They allow to keep and give a basic taste of salad.

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:07.590
Stir.

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:14.200
Crush the carrots a bit, like a cabbage, that it gives a juice.

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:24.000
Leave carrots for 15-20 minutes.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.320
Now add the spices.

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:34.840
Add pepper: black and hot red. Coriander.

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:42.090
Mix all.

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.240
Add spices to your liking.

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:52.190
Who likes peppery - add more pepper.

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:58.260
Mix.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:04.390
The vegetable oil must be heated to a high temperature, but do not boil it.

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:09.499
Pour the oil in a pan and heat.

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:18.099
The oil is warmed up. Immediately pour and stir it.

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:33.739
We still have the garlic.

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:41.939
If we had added earlier, it could turn green.

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:49.579
Now when the oil has cooled down a bit, you can add the garlic.

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:53.379
Squeezing the garlic through a press.

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:58.989
Stir again.

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:02.919
Tightly cover the bowl.

00:03:02.919 --> 00:03:05.349
Salad can be put in a jar and cover with a lid.

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:10.679
We leave the salad at room temperature overnight.

00:03:10.679 --> 00:03:14.799
In the morning put the salad in the refrigerator. There it can be stored up to two weeks.

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:19.410
Cook with fun and bon appetit!

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
