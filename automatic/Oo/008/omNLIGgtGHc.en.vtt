farther<00:02:59.000> you're<00:02:59.150> going<00:02:59.330> to<00:02:59.390> travel<00:02:59.690> you

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
farther you're going to travel you

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.850 
farther you're going to travel you
maintain<00:03:01.100> your<00:03:01.250> length<00:03:01.580> your<00:03:02.480> body<00:03:02.750> length<00:03:03.110> so

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860 
maintain your length your body length so

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:07.060 
maintain your length your body length so
you'll<00:03:04.070> keep<00:03:04.310> moving<00:03:04.850> as<00:03:05.060> you're<00:03:05.300> three<00:03:06.070> when

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:07.070 
you'll keep moving as you're three when

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:09.940 
you'll keep moving as you're three when
you<00:03:07.160> push<00:03:07.550> down<00:03:07.970> to<00:03:08.900> push<00:03:09.140> your<00:03:09.350> head<00:03:09.530> up<00:03:09.710> to

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
you push down to push your head up to

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:14.290 
you push down to push your head up to
grieve<00:03:10.190> you<00:03:10.580> use<00:03:10.850> that<00:03:11.150> like

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:14.300 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:17.120 

another<00:03:15.300> important<00:03:15.960> element<00:03:16.590> of<00:03:17.070> your

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
another important element of your

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.210 
another important element of your
breathing<00:03:17.610> is<00:03:18.030> the<00:03:18.270> pattern<00:03:18.840> that<00:03:19.220> your

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
breathing is the pattern that your

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.290 
breathing is the pattern that your
breathing<00:03:20.460> so<00:03:21.420> you<00:03:22.020> can<00:03:22.200> really<00:03:22.380> breathe<00:03:22.740> as

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:23.300 
breathing so you can really breathe as

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:25.940 
breathing so you can really breathe as
frequently<00:03:24.300> or<00:03:24.480> infrequently<00:03:24.750> as<00:03:25.530> you<00:03:25.710> like

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
frequently or infrequently as you like

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.910 
frequently or infrequently as you like
most<00:03:26.760> people<00:03:27.150> make<00:03:27.330> the<00:03:27.480> mistake<00:03:27.870> of<00:03:28.140> waiting

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
most people make the mistake of waiting

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.160 
most people make the mistake of waiting
to<00:03:29.490> breathe<00:03:29.760> until<00:03:30.240> they're<00:03:30.600> desperate<00:03:31.140> for

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
to breathe until they're desperate for

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.890 
to breathe until they're desperate for
air<00:03:31.530> so<00:03:32.490> I<00:03:32.850> think<00:03:33.240> it<00:03:33.360> should<00:03:33.480> breathe<00:03:33.720> as

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
air so I think it should breathe as

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.200 
air so I think it should breathe as
often<00:03:34.290> as<00:03:34.440> you<00:03:34.620> need<00:03:34.650> to<00:03:35.040> and<00:03:35.370> for<00:03:35.910> most<00:03:36.090> people

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:36.210 
often as you need to and for most people

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:40.280 
often as you need to and for most people
that's<00:03:36.510> every<00:03:36.990> -<00:03:37.290> or<00:03:37.980> every<00:03:38.370> four<00:03:38.640> strokes<00:03:39.290> so

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
that's every - or every four strokes so

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.890 
that's every - or every four strokes so
are<00:03:40.410> you<00:03:40.530> going<00:03:40.650> to<00:03:40.710> bring<00:03:40.950> it<00:03:41.070> every<00:03:41.900> two

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
are you going to bring it every two

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:48.199 
are you going to bring it every two
strong<00:03:43.260> Oh<00:03:44.720> probably<00:03:45.720> to<00:03:45.930> one<00:03:46.140> side<00:03:47.209> another

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
strong Oh probably to one side another

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:50.360 
strong Oh probably to one side another
breathing<00:03:48.720> pattern<00:03:49.170> that's<00:03:49.350> really<00:03:49.709> useful

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
breathing pattern that's really useful

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.060 
breathing pattern that's really useful
is<00:03:50.580> to<00:03:50.790> breathe<00:03:51.000> every<00:03:51.180> three<00:03:51.720> strokes<00:03:52.070> so

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.070 
is to breathe every three strokes so

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:58.820 
is to breathe every three strokes so
that<00:03:53.220> you're<00:03:53.370> alternating<00:03:53.910> your<00:03:54.450> side<00:03:57.830> and

00:03:58.820 --> 00:03:58.830 
that you're alternating your side and

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:00.860 
that you're alternating your side and
that's<00:03:59.010> really<00:03:59.220> useful<00:03:59.459> if<00:04:00.060> the<00:04:00.209> conditions

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
that's really useful if the conditions

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:04.910 
that's really useful if the conditions
are<00:04:01.280> choppy<00:04:02.280> or<00:04:03.240> just<00:04:04.080> to<00:04:04.200> keep<00:04:04.380> your<00:04:04.560> stroke

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 
are choppy or just to keep your stroke

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:08.080 
are choppy or just to keep your stroke
balanced<00:04:05.760> there<00:04:06.630> are<00:04:06.750> three<00:04:07.050> things<00:04:07.380> that<00:04:07.680> can

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:08.090 
balanced there are three things that can

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:11.000 
balanced there are three things that can
mess<00:04:09.090> up<00:04:09.150> your<00:04:09.390> breathing<00:04:10.170> a<00:04:10.290> little<00:04:10.590> bit<00:04:10.740> in

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
mess up your breathing a little bit in

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:15.590 
mess up your breathing a little bit in
the<00:04:11.220> open<00:04:11.580> water<00:04:11.990> one<00:04:12.990> is<00:04:13.260> cold<00:04:14.040> water<00:04:14.600> the

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:15.600 
the open water one is cold water the

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.920 
the open water one is cold water the
other<00:04:15.630> is<00:04:15.990> panic<00:04:16.680> attacks<00:04:17.280> and<00:04:17.640> the<00:04:18.419> third<00:04:18.690> is

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
other is panic attacks and the third is

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:23.120 
other is panic attacks and the third is
fatigue<00:04:20.480> so<00:04:21.480> in<00:04:21.630> the<00:04:21.750> cold<00:04:22.019> water<00:04:22.320> since<00:04:22.860> we're

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
fatigue so in the cold water since we're

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:25.130 
fatigue so in the cold water since we're
in<00:04:23.220> San<00:04:23.490> Francisco<00:04:24.180> I<00:04:24.480> should<00:04:24.690> mention<00:04:24.870> it

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:25.140 
in San Francisco I should mention it

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:27.680 
in San Francisco I should mention it
swimming<00:04:25.440> in<00:04:25.590> cold<00:04:25.830> water<00:04:26.450> it's<00:04:27.450> pretty

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
swimming in cold water it's pretty

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:30.680 
swimming in cold water it's pretty
common<00:04:27.990> to<00:04:28.760> lose<00:04:29.760> your<00:04:29.970> breath<00:04:30.150> a<00:04:30.210> little<00:04:30.510> bit

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:30.690 
common to lose your breath a little bit

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:35.380 
common to lose your breath a little bit
and<00:04:32.210> hyperventilate<00:04:33.320> at<00:04:34.320> least<00:04:34.560> it<00:04:34.740> the<00:04:34.860> first

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:35.390 
and hyperventilate at least it the first

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:39.140 
and hyperventilate at least it the first
few<00:04:36.390> minutes<00:04:36.600> of<00:04:36.870> the<00:04:37.020> swim<00:04:37.260> so<00:04:38.190> in<00:04:38.669> that<00:04:38.820> case

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150 
few minutes of the swim so in that case

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:42.500 
few minutes of the swim so in that case
you<00:04:39.930> want<00:04:40.080> to<00:04:40.169> slow<00:04:40.500> your<00:04:40.740> breathing<00:04:41.010> down<00:04:41.510> as

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:42.510 
you want to slow your breathing down as

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:45.250 
you want to slow your breathing down as
much<00:04:42.810> as<00:04:42.990> you<00:04:43.140> can<00:04:43.410> breathe<00:04:44.250> deeply

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:45.260 
much as you can breathe deeply

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.990 
much as you can breathe deeply
sometimes<00:04:46.260> all<00:04:46.530> breathes<00:04:46.800> every<00:04:47.100> six<00:04:47.580> strokes

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.000 
sometimes all breathes every six strokes

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.830 
sometimes all breathes every six strokes
when<00:04:48.960> that's<00:04:49.169> happening<00:04:49.590> to<00:04:49.770> me<00:04:49.890> just<00:04:50.220> to<00:04:50.400> slow

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:50.840 
when that's happening to me just to slow

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:56.380 
when that's happening to me just to slow
my<00:04:51.840> breath<00:04:52.080> down<00:04:54.229> panic<00:04:55.229> attacks<00:04:55.620> too<00:04:55.890> similar

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:56.390 
my breath down panic attacks too similar

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:59.659 
my breath down panic attacks too similar
when<00:04:57.390> you<00:04:57.510> something<00:04:58.290> scares<00:04:58.650> you<00:04:58.950> or<00:04:58.979> you

00:04:59.659 --> 00:04:59.669 
when you something scares you or you

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:04.430 
when you something scares you or you
have<00:04:59.820> a<00:04:59.850> thought<00:05:00.180> a<00:05:00.570> few<00:05:01.200> thought<00:05:03.020> you<00:05:04.020> tighten

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:04.440 
have a thought a few thought you tighten

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:07.700 
have a thought a few thought you tighten
up<00:05:04.500> your<00:05:04.680> breathing<00:05:04.890> and<00:05:06.020> so<00:05:07.020> it's<00:05:07.229> important

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:07.710 
up your breathing and so it's important

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:11.320 
up your breathing and so it's important
there<00:05:07.919> also<00:05:08.250> to<00:05:08.520> breathe<00:05:09.000> slowly<00:05:09.450> and<00:05:09.930> deeply

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:11.330 
there also to breathe slowly and deeply

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:14.870 
there also to breathe slowly and deeply
and<00:05:12.330> the<00:05:12.450> third<00:05:12.690> thing<00:05:12.870> is<00:05:12.930> fatigue<00:05:13.640> so<00:05:14.640> when

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:14.880 
and the third thing is fatigue so when

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:16.520 
and the third thing is fatigue so when
you're<00:05:15.030> an<00:05:15.120> open<00:05:15.419> water<00:05:15.660> you're<00:05:16.050> swimming

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:16.530 
you're an open water you're swimming

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:19.670 
you're an open water you're swimming
much<00:05:17.040> longer<00:05:17.960> distances<00:05:18.960> then<00:05:19.229> you're<00:05:19.410> used

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:19.680 
much longer distances then you're used

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:23.210 
much longer distances then you're used
to<00:05:19.800> in<00:05:20.010> the<00:05:20.130> pool<00:05:20.430> and<00:05:20.850> it's<00:05:21.630> easy<00:05:21.919> to<00:05:22.919> feel

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:23.220 
to in the pool and it's easy to feel

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:25.690 
to in the pool and it's easy to feel
that<00:05:23.490> a<00:05:23.760> little<00:05:24.510> bit<00:05:24.660> feel<00:05:24.960> short<00:05:25.349> of<00:05:25.410> breath

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:25.700 
that a little bit feel short of breath

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:28.219 
that a little bit feel short of breath
so<00:05:26.700> in<00:05:26.820> that<00:05:26.940> case<00:05:27.270> it's<00:05:27.599> important<00:05:28.140> to

00:05:28.219 --> 00:05:28.229 
so in that case it's important to

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:30.529 
so in that case it's important to
breathe<00:05:28.470> more<00:05:28.830> frequently<00:05:29.400> breathe<00:05:29.910> as<00:05:30.060> often

00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:30.539 
breathe more frequently breathe as often

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:35.420 
breathe more frequently breathe as often
as<00:05:30.690> you<00:05:30.870> need<00:05:30.900> to<00:05:33.110> there's<00:05:34.110> one<00:05:34.349> common<00:05:34.890> aspect

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:35.430 
as you need to there's one common aspect

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:39.080 
as you need to there's one common aspect
to<00:05:35.580> all<00:05:35.789> three<00:05:36.270> of<00:05:36.300> those<00:05:36.599> problems<00:05:37.520> and<00:05:38.520> that

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:39.090 
to all three of those problems and that

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:42.469 
to all three of those problems and that
is<00:05:39.300> exhaling<00:05:40.550> so<00:05:41.550> all<00:05:41.820> three<00:05:42.210> of<00:05:42.330> those

00:05:42.469 --> 00:05:42.479 
is exhaling so all three of those

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:46.370 
is exhaling so all three of those
problems<00:05:43.169> can<00:05:43.440> be<00:05:43.650> solved<00:05:44.520> by<00:05:44.720> exhaling<00:05:45.720> fully

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:46.380 
problems can be solved by exhaling fully

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:49.420 
problems can be solved by exhaling fully
a<00:05:46.830> lot<00:05:47.400> of<00:05:47.580> our<00:05:47.700> breathing<00:05:47.970> issues<00:05:48.300> come<00:05:48.810> from

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:49.430 
a lot of our breathing issues come from

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:53.630 
a lot of our breathing issues come from
not<00:05:50.430> breathing<00:05:51.030> out<00:05:51.560> so<00:05:52.560> make<00:05:53.070> sure<00:05:53.099> you're

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:53.640 
not breathing out so make sure you're

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:55.550 
not breathing out so make sure you're
breathing<00:05:53.910> out<00:05:54.240> you<00:05:54.300> want<00:05:54.570> to<00:05:54.660> blow<00:05:54.870> bubbles

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:55.560 
breathing out you want to blow bubbles

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:58.820 
breathing out you want to blow bubbles
you<00:05:56.490> can<00:05:56.669> hum<00:05:56.970> if<00:05:57.539> that<00:05:57.810> helps<00:05:58.229> or<00:05:58.380> sometimes

00:05:58.820 --> 00:05:58.830 
you can hum if that helps or sometimes

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:00.680 
you can hum if that helps or sometimes
in<00:05:59.010> the<00:05:59.099> cold<00:05:59.370> water<00:05:59.640> we<00:05:59.880> like<00:06:00.060> to<00:06:00.240> scream<00:06:00.630> a

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:00.690 
in the cold water we like to scream a

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:03.710 
in the cold water we like to scream a
little<00:06:01.140> bit<00:06:01.320> just<00:06:02.190> to<00:06:02.340> make<00:06:02.370> sure<00:06:02.760> we're<00:06:03.030> we're

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:03.720 
little bit just to make sure we're we're

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:07.780 
little bit just to make sure we're we're
getting<00:06:04.020> the<00:06:04.110> air<00:06:04.289> out

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:07.790 

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:10.610 

breathing<00:06:08.790> becomes<00:06:09.270> the<00:06:09.630> most<00:06:09.930> challenging

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:10.620 
breathing becomes the most challenging

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:14.740 
breathing becomes the most challenging
when<00:06:10.890> the<00:06:11.040> water<00:06:11.310> is<00:06:11.670> rough<00:06:12.030> or<00:06:12.540> choppy<00:06:13.670> so

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:14.750 
when the water is rough or choppy so

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:16.910 
when the water is rough or choppy so
there<00:06:15.750> are<00:06:15.840> three<00:06:16.050> things<00:06:16.230> you<00:06:16.470> could<00:06:16.680> do<00:06:16.890> to

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:16.920 
there are three things you could do to

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:20.270 
there are three things you could do to
breathe<00:06:17.460> easier<00:06:17.970> in<00:06:18.150> choppy<00:06:18.480> water<00:06:19.070> the<00:06:20.070> first

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:20.280 
breathe easier in choppy water the first

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:23.330 
breathe easier in choppy water the first
is<00:06:20.550> to<00:06:20.730> roll<00:06:21.030> your<00:06:21.270> body<00:06:21.480> farther<00:06:22.280> so<00:06:23.280> you

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:23.340 
is to roll your body farther so you

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:25.400 
is to roll your body farther so you
might<00:06:23.610> have<00:06:23.760> to<00:06:23.910> wall<00:06:24.180> almost<00:06:24.570> so<00:06:25.080> you<00:06:25.140> look

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:25.410 
might have to wall almost so you look

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:28.070 
might have to wall almost so you look
looking<00:06:26.070> straight<00:06:26.460> up<00:06:26.490> at<00:06:26.700> the<00:06:26.760> sky<00:06:27.000> just<00:06:27.930> so

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:28.080 
looking straight up at the sky just so

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:29.660 
looking straight up at the sky just so
you<00:06:28.140> can<00:06:28.320> get<00:06:28.500> your<00:06:28.650> mouth<00:06:28.890> a<00:06:29.220> little<00:06:29.370> bit

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:29.670 
you can get your mouth a little bit

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:32.360 
you can get your mouth a little bit
farther<00:06:30.000> away<00:06:30.300> from<00:06:30.510> the<00:06:30.900> surface<00:06:31.410> and<00:06:31.770> you'll

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:32.370 
farther away from the surface and you'll

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:34.700 
farther away from the surface and you'll
be<00:06:32.580> a<00:06:32.610> little<00:06:32.910> bit<00:06:33.060> more<00:06:33.300> stable<00:06:33.720> the<00:06:34.230> more<00:06:34.470> you

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:34.710 
be a little bit more stable the more you

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:37.010 
be a little bit more stable the more you
roll<00:06:34.890> your<00:06:35.130> hips<00:06:35.400> around<00:06:35.820> you'll<00:06:36.540> be<00:06:36.690> able<00:06:36.780> to

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:37.020 
roll your hips around you'll be able to

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:40.310 
roll your hips around you'll be able to
balance<00:06:37.260> better<00:06:38.360> the<00:06:39.360> second<00:06:39.810> is<00:06:39.930> to<00:06:39.960> make

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:40.320 
balance better the second is to make

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:43.250 
balance better the second is to make
sure<00:06:40.350> you<00:06:40.710> breathe<00:06:41.040> and<00:06:41.400> quickly<00:06:42.020> you<00:06:43.020> want<00:06:43.200> to

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:43.260 
sure you breathe and quickly you want to

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:46.790 
sure you breathe and quickly you want to
open<00:06:43.410> your<00:06:43.740> mouth<00:06:44.690> gasp<00:06:45.690> the<00:06:46.080> air<00:06:46.260> in<00:06:46.500> and<00:06:46.710> then

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:46.800 
open your mouth gasp the air in and then

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:49.670 
open your mouth gasp the air in and then
close<00:06:47.130> your<00:06:47.310> mouth<00:06:47.490> right<00:06:47.850> away<00:06:48.350> so<00:06:49.350> you<00:06:49.380> can

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:49.680 
close your mouth right away so you can

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:51.980 
close your mouth right away so you can
minimize<00:06:49.920> water<00:06:50.520> going<00:06:51.090> in<00:06:51.240> your<00:06:51.360> mouth<00:06:51.540> if

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:51.990 
minimize water going in your mouth if

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:55.040 
minimize water going in your mouth if
you<00:06:52.530> do<00:06:52.890> get<00:06:53.070> water<00:06:53.310> in<00:06:53.520> your<00:06:53.670> mouth<00:06:53.850> just<00:06:54.510> spit

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:55.050 
you do get water in your mouth just spit

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:57.470 
you do get water in your mouth just spit
it<00:06:55.170> out<00:06:55.320> and<00:06:55.650> you<00:06:56.250> probably<00:06:56.490> will<00:06:56.910> swallow<00:06:57.330> a

00:06:57.470 --> 00:06:57.480
