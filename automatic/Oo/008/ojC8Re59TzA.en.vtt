I<00:03:16.680> think<00:03:17.680> that<00:03:17.859> the<00:03:18.400> makes<00:03:18.609> of<00:03:18.760> great<00:03:19.030> guitar

I think that the makes of great guitar
player<00:03:19.599> is<00:03:19.840> when<00:03:20.019> you<00:03:20.140> find<00:03:20.379> your<00:03:20.560> voice<00:03:20.709> when

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
player is when you find your voice when

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.640 
player is when you find your voice when
you<00:03:21.069> find<00:03:21.310> that<00:03:21.400> one<00:03:21.609> thing<00:03:21.819> that<00:03:21.879> really<00:03:22.650> sets

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
you find that one thing that really sets

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:25.860 
you find that one thing that really sets
you<00:03:23.769> apart<00:03:23.799> from<00:03:24.219> someone<00:03:24.609> and<00:03:25.030> perhaps<00:03:25.689> you

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
you apart from someone and perhaps you

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:27.899 
you apart from someone and perhaps you
may<00:03:26.019> play<00:03:26.290> it<00:03:26.439> unorthodox<00:03:26.769> perhaps<00:03:27.549> them<00:03:27.730> have

00:03:27.899 --> 00:03:27.909 
may play it unorthodox perhaps them have

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:29.610 
may play it unorthodox perhaps them have
a<00:03:27.939> different<00:03:28.390> way<00:03:28.480> of<00:03:28.510> approaching<00:03:28.719> it<00:03:29.260> or

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
a different way of approaching it or

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.199 
a different way of approaching it or
attacking<00:03:29.950> it<00:03:30.189> but<00:03:30.340> that's<00:03:30.519> your<00:03:31.030> voice

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209 
attacking it but that's your voice

00:03:31.209 --> 00:04:27.450
