00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.540
 Our relationship does not grow takes time 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:11.000

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.700
 silence I want you to trust me not to 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.740
 act like a fool looking for chicken bread 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.820
 and the fish if there is not a blessing 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.790
 late 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:22.220
 efe takes time giving the same time 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:26.300
 I've been silent, I want you to trust 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:28.520
 in me I love you I have shown you in 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:31.280

 call only for blessings look for me 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.810
 in the good not only in the bad 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.660
 When the storm comes I will extend 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.880
 your wings and fly trees above 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:43.130
 the storm and fly fairies will fly by 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.410
 what torments you took in 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.690
 answer you in my time and not in yours 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:50.539
 I do not want to be demanding or sound your 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:53.240
 proud and he asks me that sanz is the person 

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:55.729
 that you love so much and if your salvation was 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.950
 prostrate in his bed I see beyond 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:59.960
 if I do the miracle you lose that 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.030
 I take it with me and that's what you do not 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.520
 You understand me you look for bread and 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:07.280
 fish if there is not a blessing our 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:09.410
 relationship does not grow takes time praying 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.269
 the same time that I have been silent 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.970
 I want you to trust me not to act 

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:17.030
 Like a fool you look for me for loaves and 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.180
 I fish looking for bread and 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.000
 fishes 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:23.250
 He looks for me for loaves and fishes and does not 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.290
 there is a blessing our relationship does not 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:29.579
 it grows 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:33.659
 you know something today the mister tells you I want 

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:35.830
 bless your life but not in the middle of your 

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:39.460
 despair 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:44.650
 you know something your desperation brings you 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:50.650
 to make wrong decisions the lord 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:54.700
 never never arrives early but you know 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:59.890
 something is not late Mr. Wood 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:02.600
 arrives just in time at the moment 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:06.350
 that you really need it 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:08.660
 what are you asking God for things but the 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:11.810
 sir is going to give you what you really 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:13.940
 you need maybe it's something you want 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:17.090
 so much but maybe it's not something that 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:19.100
 it really suits you sir knows what 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:23.000
 What do you need 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:25.910
 learn to think about it it's time that 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.320
 let yourself be guided by god 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:30.350
 maybe the petitioner Mr. sanz something 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:37.100
 lifted up from that bed and the lord will 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:41.600
 says and what would happen so what would happen if yes 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:46.310
 He lifted them from that bed and lost their 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:50.030
 salvation and maybe it's time to 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:52.670
 take it straight to heaven 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:56.240
 because maybe prostrate in that bed has 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:04:00.350
 his was placed in god today I bless you 

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:04.490
 in the name of Jesus but it says cycle my 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:09.610
 God always capital and remember God is 

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:09.610
 God and the rest is parking
