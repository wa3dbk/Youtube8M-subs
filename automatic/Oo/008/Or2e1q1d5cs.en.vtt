00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.870 
of them has or two of them have special
modifications<00:01:39.930> or<00:01:40.470> what<00:01:40.620> looks<00:01:40.800> to<00:01:40.860> be<00:01:40.950> custom

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
modifications or what looks to be custom

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.760 
modifications or what looks to be custom
modifications<00:01:42.570> that<00:01:42.660> we<00:01:43.020> can<00:01:43.200> see<00:01:43.470> two<00:01:43.740> of

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
modifications that we can see two of

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.340 
modifications that we can see two of
them<00:01:44.010> have<00:01:44.220> an<00:01:44.370> extra<00:01:44.730> tire<00:01:45.030> on<00:01:45.330> top<00:01:45.660> and<00:01:46.200> that

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
them have an extra tire on top and that

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.690 
them have an extra tire on top and that
seems<00:01:46.560> to<00:01:46.620> be<00:01:46.740> probably<00:01:47.130> something<00:01:47.460> we'll<00:01:47.580> be

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
seems to be probably something we'll be

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.640 
seems to be probably something we'll be
able<00:01:47.820> to<00:01:47.970> add<00:01:48.150> once<00:01:48.780> we<00:01:48.930> get<00:01:49.050> the<00:01:49.170> vehicle<00:01:49.320> at

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:49.650 
able to add once we get the vehicle at

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:51.890 
able to add once we get the vehicle at
the<00:01:49.710> los<00:01:50.400> santos<00:01:50.850> customs<00:01:50.880> as<00:01:51.540> you<00:01:51.600> can<00:01:51.720> see

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:51.900 
the los santos customs as you can see

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.420 
the los santos customs as you can see
the<00:01:52.020> problems<00:01:52.470> for<00:01:52.710> from<00:01:52.890> there's<00:01:53.070> that<00:01:53.220> red

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
the problems for from there's that red

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.240 
the problems for from there's that red
one<00:01:53.670> there<00:01:53.880> seems<00:01:54.570> to<00:01:54.690> be<00:01:54.780> green<00:01:55.200> and<00:01:55.440> also

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
one there seems to be green and also

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.540 
one there seems to be green and also
maybe<00:01:56.430> blue<00:01:56.760> and<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.270> yellow

00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:58.550 
maybe blue and the yellow

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:00.460 
maybe blue and the yellow
orange<00:01:58.820> color<00:01:59.060> right<00:01:59.270> there<00:01:59.570> it<00:02:00.110> also<00:02:00.260> seems

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:00.470 
orange color right there it also seems

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:01.990 
orange color right there it also seems
that<00:02:00.650> there's<00:02:00.800> going<00:02:00.950> to<00:02:01.010> be<00:02:01.040> for<00:02:01.400> fog<00:02:01.700> lights

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
that there's going to be for fog lights

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.700 
that there's going to be for fog lights
it<00:02:02.360> looks<00:02:02.600> like<00:02:02.720> it<00:02:02.840> has<00:02:02.990> them<00:02:03.230> and<00:02:03.380> it's<00:02:03.470> going

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 
it looks like it has them and it's going

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.490 
it looks like it has them and it's going
to<00:02:03.770> have<00:02:03.890> to<00:02:04.100> with<00:02:04.820> a<00:02:04.850> winch<00:02:05.170> there<00:02:06.170> seems<00:02:06.470> to

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
to have to with a winch there seems to

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.469 
to have to with a winch there seems to
be<00:02:06.650> off<00:02:06.770> some<00:02:07.040> roof<00:02:07.250> lights<00:02:07.550> who<00:02:08.119> knows<00:02:08.300> of

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
be off some roof lights who knows of

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.060 
be off some roof lights who knows of
those<00:02:08.630> will<00:02:08.780> be<00:02:08.810> fully<00:02:09.110> operational<00:02:09.320> who<00:02:09.920> know

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:10.070 
those will be fully operational who know

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:12.100 
those will be fully operational who know
it's<00:02:10.250> most<00:02:10.490> likely<00:02:10.580> not<00:02:10.910> just<00:02:11.330> because<00:02:11.570> a<00:02:11.720> lot

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
it's most likely not just because a lot

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:13.810 
it's most likely not just because a lot
of<00:02:12.140> times<00:02:12.410> that<00:02:12.680> we've<00:02:12.800> seen<00:02:13.040> those<00:02:13.250> type<00:02:13.790> of

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:13.820 
of times that we've seen those type of

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:15.280 
of times that we've seen those type of
things<00:02:13.970> on<00:02:14.300> vehicles<00:02:14.630> are<00:02:14.750> never<00:02:15.020> really

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
things on vehicles are never really

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.500 
things on vehicles are never really
fully<00:02:15.500> functional<00:02:16.220> and<00:02:16.880> there's<00:02:17.030> also<00:02:17.150> other

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
fully functional and there's also other

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.060 
fully functional and there's also other
items<00:02:18.020> which<00:02:18.200> should<00:02:18.380> look<00:02:18.530> to<00:02:18.560> be<00:02:18.770> black

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.070 
items which should look to be black

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:21.880 
items which should look to be black
stickers<00:02:19.460> and<00:02:19.700> whatnot<00:02:20.060> the<00:02:20.690> ifruit<00:02:21.140> the

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
stickers and whatnot the ifruit the

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.820 
stickers and whatnot the ifruit the
epsilon<00:02:22.850> program<00:02:23.360> looks<00:02:24.350> like<00:02:24.440> a<00:02:24.500> look<00:02:24.680> like

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
epsilon program looks like a look like

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.700 
epsilon program looks like a look like
heat<00:02:25.100> like<00:02:25.310> a<00:02:25.600> what<00:02:26.600> is<00:02:26.690> that<00:02:26.720> to<00:02:27.170> change<00:02:27.470> of

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:27.710 
heat like a what is that to change of

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:29.350 
heat like a what is that to change of
some<00:02:27.920> sort<00:02:28.250> and<00:02:28.610> the<00:02:28.700> butcher<00:02:28.970> the<00:02:29.000> goodies

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
some sort and the butcher the goodies

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:30.700 
some sort and the butcher the goodies
looks<00:02:29.570> like<00:02:29.660> a<00:02:29.690> bunch<00:02:29.870> of<00:02:29.990> stickers<00:02:30.230> as<00:02:30.500> well

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:30.710 
looks like a bunch of stickers as well

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:32.680 
looks like a bunch of stickers as well
so<00:02:31.340> that's<00:02:31.580> all<00:02:31.820> the<00:02:31.850> images<00:02:32.180> right<00:02:32.450> there

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
so that's all the images right there
