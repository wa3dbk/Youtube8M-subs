00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.170 
from a different spot on the pitch
that's<00:03:16.800> where<00:03:17.070> Donovan<00:03:17.430> gets<00:03:17.610> his<00:03:17.730> goals<00:03:17.970> from

the ones he gets in space anyway both of
these<00:03:20.970> guys<00:03:21.239> can<00:03:21.660> get<00:03:21.870> goals<00:03:22.140> in<00:03:22.320> other

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:26.299 
and that's what makes them so special
