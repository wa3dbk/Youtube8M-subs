00:00:05.769 --> 00:00:05.779 
play Mega Man 3 and now I have to decide

00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:10.879 
play Mega Man 3 and now I have to decide
which<00:00:07.910> weapon<00:00:08.910> I'm<00:00:09.000> going<00:00:09.210> to<00:00:09.269> use<00:00:09.510> I<00:00:09.889> believe

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
which weapon I'm going to use I believe

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.669 
which weapon I'm going to use I believe
the<00:00:11.190> shadow<00:00:11.429> blade<00:00:11.700> works<00:00:11.910> on<00:00:12.120> this<00:00:12.300> so<00:00:12.990> we'll

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
the shadow blade works on this so we'll

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.500 
the shadow blade works on this so we'll
do<00:00:13.799> that<00:00:17.029> while<00:00:18.029> you<00:00:18.119> can<00:00:18.180> shoot<00:00:18.390> through

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
do that while you can shoot through

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.820 
do that while you can shoot through
these<00:00:18.660> arms<00:00:18.990> I<00:00:19.080> didn't<00:00:19.260> know<00:00:19.350> that<00:00:19.470> way<00:00:19.740> I

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:21.830 
these arms I didn't know that way I

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:23.779 
these arms I didn't know that way I
don't<00:00:22.830> think<00:00:22.980> you<00:00:23.070> can<00:00:23.160> actually<00:00:23.340> do<00:00:23.640> that

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
don't think you can actually do that

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.839 
don't think you can actually do that
with<00:00:23.850> the<00:00:24.060> arm<00:00:24.240> cannon<00:00:25.580> well<00:00:26.580> you're<00:00:26.760> gonna

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:43.300 
happened there but grab ourselves a

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.910 
happened there but grab ourselves a
couple<00:01:44.300> of<00:01:44.390> some<00:01:44.780> junk<00:01:45.110> here<00:01:45.410> you<00:01:45.530> know<00:01:45.649> just

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
couple of some junk here you know just

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.359 
couple of some junk here you know just
forget<00:01:46.039> it<00:01:47.649> yeah<00:01:48.649> I<00:01:48.680> know<00:01:48.770> it's<00:01:48.979> a<00:01:49.009> waste<00:01:49.220> to

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:49.369 
forget it yeah I know it's a waste to

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:52.290 
forget it yeah I know it's a waste to
use<00:01:49.460> shadow<00:01:49.850> blades<00:01:50.180> on<00:01:50.360> that<00:01:50.539> but<00:01:50.750> oh<00:01:50.899> well

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:52.300 
use shadow blades on that but oh well

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.340 
use shadow blades on that but oh well
so<00:01:53.300> I<00:01:53.330> guess<00:01:53.539> it's<00:01:53.690> time<00:01:53.780> to<00:01:53.899> fight<00:01:54.080> gamma

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
so I guess it's time to fight gamma

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.389 
so I guess it's time to fight gamma
gamma<00:01:55.280> there<00:01:56.149> is<00:01:56.530> holy<00:01:57.530> cow<00:01:57.860> he's<00:01:58.100> humongous

00:01:58.389 --> 00:01:58.399 
gamma there is holy cow he's humongous

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:00.730 
gamma there is holy cow he's humongous
very<00:01:59.330> easy<00:01:59.539> way<00:01:59.750> to<00:01:59.780> beat<00:01:59.990> this<00:02:00.110> guy<00:02:00.289> to<00:02:00.350> stand

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
very easy way to beat this guy to stand

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:06.910 
very easy way to beat this guy to stand
here<00:02:01.990> and<00:02:02.990> he<00:02:03.830> won't<00:02:03.950> do<00:02:04.160> a<00:02:04.190> thing<00:02:04.310> to<00:02:04.700> you

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.609 

energy<00:02:07.610> gets<00:02:07.820> halfway<00:02:08.119> down<00:02:08.360> he<00:02:09.170> finally

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
energy gets halfway down he finally

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:11.230 
energy gets halfway down he finally
completes<00:02:09.979> the<00:02:10.160> robot<00:02:10.490> the<00:02:10.700> project<00:02:11.120> he's

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:11.240 
completes the robot the project he's

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.240

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
whatever you got well I always thought

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.860 
whatever you got well I always thought
because<00:02:34.010> uh<00:02:34.150> because<00:02:35.150> it's<00:02:35.270> like<00:02:35.390> bubble<00:02:35.720> led

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
because uh because it's like bubble led

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:37.510 
because uh because it's like bubble led
and<00:02:36.050> Mega<00:02:36.200> Man<00:02:36.350> 2<00:02:36.500> I<00:02:36.530> figured<00:02:36.920> since<00:02:37.040> snake<00:02:37.340> had

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:37.520 
and Mega Man 2 I figured since snake had

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:38.979 
and Mega Man 2 I figured since snake had
the<00:02:37.610> same<00:02:37.790> sort<00:02:38.060> of<00:02:38.120> pattern<00:02:38.300> you<00:02:38.600> had<00:02:38.750> to<00:02:38.840> use

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:38.989 
the same sort of pattern you had to use

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:40.540 
the same sort of pattern you had to use
it<00:02:39.020> it's<00:02:39.770> really<00:02:39.890> hard<00:02:39.980> to<00:02:40.190> hit<00:02:40.310> him<00:02:40.400> with<00:02:40.520> it

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.550 
it it's really hard to hit him with it

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.690 
it it's really hard to hit him with it
but<00:02:40.820> that's<00:02:41.330> how<00:02:41.450> I<00:02:41.540> always<00:02:41.989> did<00:02:42.170> it<00:02:42.700> I'm

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
but that's how I always did it I'm

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.220 
but that's how I always did it I'm
pretty<00:02:43.910> sure<00:02:44.120> if<00:02:44.239> that<00:02:44.390> hand<00:02:44.600> hits<00:02:44.900> you<00:02:45.050> you're

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
pretty sure if that hand hits you you're

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.259 
pretty sure if that hand hits you you're
dead<00:02:45.640> so<00:02:46.640> you<00:02:47.120> don't<00:02:47.239> want<00:02:47.360> that<00:02:47.450> to<00:02:47.600> happen

and<00:05:54.990> I<00:05:55.199> was<00:05:55.289> thinking<00:05:55.559> well<00:05:55.709> I've<00:05:55.889> never

00:05:55.999 --> 00:05:56.009 
and I was thinking well I've never

00:05:56.009 --> 00:05:57.409 
and I was thinking well I've never
played<00:05:56.339> Link's<00:05:56.610> Awakening<00:05:56.669> before<00:05:57.240> something

00:05:57.409 --> 00:05:57.419 
played Link's Awakening before something

00:05:57.419 --> 00:05:58.909 
played Link's Awakening before something
that's<00:05:57.659> do<00:05:57.749> a<00:05:57.779> practice<00:05:58.259> run<00:05:58.409> well<00:05:58.589> I<00:05:58.620> haven't

00:05:58.909 --> 00:05:58.919 
that's do a practice run well I haven't

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:01.480 
that's do a practice run well I haven't
started<00:05:59.159> or<00:05:59.430> anything<00:05:59.669> like<00:05:59.909> that<00:05:59.969> yet

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:01.490 
started or anything like that yet

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:03.610 
started or anything like that yet
so<00:06:01.550> I<00:06:01.850> might<00:06:02.600> just<00:06:02.660> go<00:06:02.840> ahead<00:06:03.020> and<00:06:03.199> do<00:06:03.319> that<00:06:03.350> one

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:03.620 
so I might just go ahead and do that one

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:05.409 
so I might just go ahead and do that one
blind<00:06:03.919> I<00:06:04.160> don't<00:06:04.340> know<00:06:04.430> I<00:06:04.699> mean<00:06:04.970> what<00:06:05.150> the<00:06:05.270> heck
