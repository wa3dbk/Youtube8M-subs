00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
leaked on the apple store and the reason

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.140 
leaked on the apple store and the reason
we<00:00:25.109> know<00:00:25.500> this<00:00:25.740> is<00:00:25.980> because<00:00:26.369> the<00:00:26.580> picture<00:00:26.820> on

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
we know this is because the picture on

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.900 
we know this is because the picture on
screen<00:00:27.720> if<00:00:27.900> you<00:00:28.050> look<00:00:28.410> at<00:00:28.619> the<00:00:28.680> home<00:00:29.550> button

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
screen if you look at the home button

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.389 
screen if you look at the home button
you<00:00:30.510> can<00:00:30.689> see<00:00:30.929> that<00:00:30.960> there<00:00:31.289> is<00:00:31.320> a<00:00:31.470> fingerprint

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
you can see that there is a fingerprint

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.520 
you can see that there is a fingerprint
scanner<00:00:32.850> on<00:00:33.120> there<00:00:33.390> and<00:00:33.540> this<00:00:33.719> is<00:00:33.930> not<00:00:34.230> an

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
scanner on there and this is not an

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.670 
scanner on there and this is not an
iphone<00:00:35.120> 5c<00:00:36.120> because<00:00:36.840> they<00:00:36.989> did<00:00:37.200> not<00:00:37.230> include

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
iphone 5c because they did not include

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.010 
iphone 5c because they did not include
the<00:00:37.920> fingerprint<00:00:38.460> scanner<00:00:38.790> so<00:00:39.360> we<00:00:39.510> are<00:00:39.570> hoping

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
the fingerprint scanner so we are hoping

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:46.279 
the fingerprint scanner so we are hoping
that<00:00:40.230> this<00:00:40.469> is<00:00:40.500> a<00:00:40.890> new<00:00:42.140> a9<00:00:43.140> device<00:00:44.040> and<00:00:44.610> so<00:00:45.480> what

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
that this is a new a9 device and so what

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.500 
that this is a new a9 device and so what
some<00:00:46.649> things<00:00:46.920> we<00:00:47.129> know<00:00:47.370> right<00:00:47.700> now<00:00:47.760> about<00:00:48.180> the

about the iphone 6s also just so you

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.859 
about the iphone 6s also just so you
hopefully<00:01:34.380> don't<00:01:34.590> get<00:01:34.799> that<00:01:34.979> confused<00:01:35.369> um

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:35.869 
hopefully don't get that confused um

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
gate I sort of stumbled on that last

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.969 
gate I sort of stumbled on that last
sentence<00:01:54.570> but<00:01:54.750> hopefully<00:01:55.170> you<00:01:55.290> still<00:01:55.590> got<00:01:55.799> it

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
sentence but hopefully you still got it

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.719 
sentence but hopefully you still got it
on<00:01:56.329> what<00:01:57.329> we<00:01:57.479> know<00:01:57.659> about<00:01:57.840> this<00:01:58.200> iphone<00:01:58.740> 6c<00:01:59.340> so

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
on what we know about this iphone 6c so

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.270 
on what we know about this iphone 6c so
far<00:02:00.030> if<00:02:00.210> it<00:02:00.390> is<00:02:00.570> truly<00:02:01.110> leaked<00:02:01.560> and<00:02:01.890> released

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
far if it is truly leaked and released

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.359 
far if it is truly leaked and released
is<00:02:02.549> that<00:02:03.450> it<00:02:03.689> is<00:02:03.840> going<00:02:04.110> to<00:02:04.200> be<00:02:04.259> faster<00:02:04.860> cameras

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
is that it is going to be faster cameras

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:06.830 
is that it is going to be faster cameras
going<00:02:05.490> to<00:02:05.549> be<00:02:05.670> better<00:02:05.850> just<00:02:06.210> the<00:02:06.390> basic

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
going to be better just the basic

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.279 
going to be better just the basic
upgrades<00:02:07.560> and<00:02:08.270> one<00:02:09.270> thing<00:02:09.629> that<00:02:09.660> i<00:02:09.929> am

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289
