00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:14.490
 would you dare insert a 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.970
 electronic component within your 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:20.160
 body because the paulistano ramon de souza 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:22.400
 rcn group editor decided to implement 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.690
 a microchip in his left hand 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.730
 facing this procedure as the 

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:30.900
 first step towards achieving a 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:33.270
 dream in common turn a cyborg that is 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.149
 an nfc chip developed by the company 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.370
 among the items of the 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.629
 size of a rice grain and costing 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.780
 $ 100 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.909
 the product is similar to rfd chips that 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.760
 caused a certain controversy some years 

00:00:44.909 --> 00:00:48.390
 back but works one way 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.909
 different 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.069
 it has just over 800 bytes of 

00:00:50.909 --> 00:00:55.649
 memory that can be used to 

00:00:53.069 --> 00:00:56.670
 store any type of data that you 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.100
 Wish 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.620
 this data can then be transferred 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:05.690
 for any reader device as a 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:08.490
 smartphone equipped with nfc technology 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:10.500
 another very interesting use for 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.350
 this chip is security related 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.960
 you can use it for 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.659
 unlock your cell phone and even 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.850
 open electronic locks from your home 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.250
 since it is very easy to circumvent the system of 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.439
 using an arduino and a small 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.079
 nfc board 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.939
 according to the most difficult copywriter 

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:32.130
 was to find a professional who 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.049
 would be willing to perform this 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.509
 unusual procedure 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:39.000
 the eband ended up being made by rafael 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:41.460
 lion in his bar studio and I modified 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.579
 xantar chan located in the municipality of 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:47.579
 jundiahy the procedure was very fast and 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:50.130
 since the chip has been capped in 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:53.880
 biocompatible glass and within a 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:56.130
 syringe so far sterilized one of the 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.499
 more fun uses that ramÃ³n found 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.829
 for your implant is that of a 

00:01:58.499 --> 00:02:04.200
 virtual visits when passing a smartphone 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:06.659
 in your hand it is possible to obtain data from 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:11.009
 contact such as phone number and email 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:13.080
 Profession and official website no more pains 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.420
 with the implant region still a little 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.940
 red the young man needs to be careful 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.650
 for one or two weeks until the 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:23.079
 chip is encapsulated by fibrous tissue 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:27.459
 and stop moving inside your 

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:29.680
 body and he does not want to stop here. 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:31.989
 ramon is already planning his next 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.090
 implant that must occur in a few 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:36.790
 three or four months 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:39.010
 this time the editor wants to put a magnet 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.470
 neodymium on the ring finger of your hand 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:44.079
 left side which will allow you to feel the 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:46.049
 electromagnetic waves emitted by 

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:48.609
 electronic devices 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:50.590
 seeing all this story with more 

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:52.319
 details and leaving a little 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.000
 old story of the mark of the beast 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:58.480
 we repeated the question asked at the beginning of 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:01.170
 video and you would have the courage to 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.819
 a chip in your body 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:06.639
