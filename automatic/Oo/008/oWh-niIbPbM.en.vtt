00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
Legends and games like dota basically

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.500 
Legends and games like dota basically
MOBAs<00:01:02.370> or<00:01:03.019> RTS<00:01:04.019> games<00:01:04.290> like<00:01:04.470> starcraft<00:01:05.510> the

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
MOBAs or RTS games like starcraft the

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.300 
MOBAs or RTS games like starcraft the
computer<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.260> community<00:01:07.740> is<00:01:07.770> so<00:01:08.100> much

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
computer the community is so much

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.590 
computer the community is so much
different<00:01:08.549> like<00:01:09.320> teams<00:01:10.400> stick<00:01:11.400> together<00:01:11.600> for

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
different like teams stick together for

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.109 
different like teams stick together for
such<00:01:12.930> a<00:01:12.960> long<00:01:13.200> long<00:01:14.130> long<00:01:14.610> time<00:01:15.150> and<00:01:15.799> it's<00:01:16.799> not

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:17.119 
such a long long long time and it's not

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:19.789 
such a long long long time and it's not
it's<00:01:18.119> not<00:01:18.299> really<00:01:18.540> players<00:01:18.840> having<00:01:19.380> control

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
it's not really players having control

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.179 
it's not really players having control
over<00:01:19.860> so<00:01:20.670> much<00:01:20.850> of<00:01:21.140> the<00:01:22.140> team<00:01:22.409> itself<00:01:22.799> I<00:01:23.009> mean

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
over so much of the team itself I mean

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.859 
over so much of the team itself I mean
they<00:01:23.280> do<00:01:23.340> have<00:01:23.670> some<00:01:23.909> say<00:01:24.180> who<00:01:24.450> stays<00:01:24.659> and<00:01:24.810> who

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
they do have some say who stays and who

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.070 
they do have some say who stays and who
goes<00:01:24.990> but<00:01:25.710> it<00:01:26.299> seems<00:01:27.299> like<00:01:27.479> when<00:01:27.600> they<00:01:27.720> build<00:01:27.930> a

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
goes but it seems like when they build a

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.350 
goes but it seems like when they build a
team<00:01:28.290> they<00:01:29.250> build<00:01:29.460> a<00:01:29.579> team<00:01:29.759> because<00:01:30.060> they<00:01:30.180> know

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
team they build a team because they know

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.149 
team they build a team because they know
they'll<00:01:30.750> you<00:01:31.079> know<00:01:31.110> they're<00:01:31.829> they're<00:01:32.070> gonna

becoming<00:01:51.720> no<00:01:52.020> different<00:01:52.500> than<00:01:52.649> every<00:01:53.549> other

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
becoming no different than every other

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:58.010 
becoming no different than every other
team<00:01:54.119> out<00:01:54.420> there<00:01:54.720> it's<00:01:55.500> just<00:01:55.890> it's<00:01:57.020> it's

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:02.299 
really it's really sad to see how far

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:06.230 
really it's really sad to see how far
competitive<00:02:03.299> cod<00:02:03.570> could<00:02:03.990> go<00:02:04.579> but<00:02:05.579> it's<00:02:05.909> just

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
competitive cod could go but it's just

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.749 
competitive cod could go but it's just
being<00:02:06.450> hindered<00:02:06.869> and<00:02:07.049> set<00:02:07.290> back<00:02:07.530> every<00:02:08.280> single

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
being hindered and set back every single

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.910 
being hindered and set back every single
day<00:02:08.940> seems<00:02:09.330> like<00:02:09.539> and<00:02:09.810> they're<00:02:10.410> never<00:02:10.619> going

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920
