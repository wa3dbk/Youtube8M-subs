I've<00:00:01.079> been<00:00:01.199> posting<00:00:01.589> a<00:00:01.860> few<00:00:02.460> videos<00:00:02.760> with<00:00:03.330> this

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:03.540 
I've been posting a few videos with this

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:05.510 
I've been posting a few videos with this
new<00:00:03.750> micro<00:00:04.140> quad<00:00:04.380> that<00:00:04.560> I<00:00:04.680> just<00:00:05.100> built<00:00:05.250> up<00:00:05.400> this

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:05.520 
new micro quad that I just built up this

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.700 
new micro quad that I just built up this
week<00:00:05.759> this<00:00:06.390> is<00:00:06.480> the<00:00:06.950> hobbyking<00:00:07.950> fpv<00:00:08.550> 250<00:00:09.300> frame

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:09.710 
week this is the hobbyking fpv 250 frame

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:14.660 
week this is the hobbyking fpv 250 frame
which<00:00:10.710> is<00:00:11.150> $10<00:00:12.530> the<00:00:13.530> framework<00:00:14.009> is<00:00:14.190> one<00:00:14.429> piece

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
which is $10 the framework is one piece

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.080 
which is $10 the framework is one piece
um<00:00:15.059> it's<00:00:15.900> really<00:00:16.470> really<00:00:17.039> robust<00:00:17.430> plastic<00:00:17.910> eye

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
um it's really really robust plastic eye

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.010 
um it's really really robust plastic eye
I<00:00:19.050> think<00:00:19.230> it's<00:00:19.710> a<00:00:19.770> brilliant<00:00:20.720> frame<00:00:21.720> from<00:00:21.990> the

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
I think it's a brilliant frame from the

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.089 
I think it's a brilliant frame from the
money<00:00:22.490> it<00:00:23.490> comes<00:00:23.820> with<00:00:24.090> a<00:00:24.119> little<00:00:25.099> protector

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
money it comes with a little protector

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.740 
money it comes with a little protector
plate<00:00:26.310> which<00:00:26.519> is<00:00:26.550> really<00:00:26.970> designed<00:00:27.150> for<00:00:27.480> the

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
plate which is really designed for the

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.080 
plate which is really designed for the
hobbyking<00:00:28.289> kk2<00:00:28.710> controller<00:00:29.310> so<00:00:29.910> if<00:00:29.970> you're

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
hobbyking kk2 controller so if you're

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.939 
hobbyking kk2 controller so if you're
using<00:00:30.210> any<00:00:30.420> other<00:00:30.570> controller<00:00:31.140> it<00:00:31.500> may<00:00:31.740> not

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
using any other controller it may not

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.709 
using any other controller it may not
fit<00:00:32.219> but<00:00:32.430> you<00:00:32.460> could<00:00:32.669> always<00:00:32.790> make<00:00:33.030> up<00:00:33.239> a<00:00:33.420> top

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
fit but you could always make up a top

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.930 
fit but you could always make up a top
plate<00:00:33.960> using<00:00:34.260> standoffs<00:00:35.010> in<00:00:35.190> a<00:00:35.309> and<00:00:35.489> a<00:00:35.730> piece

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
plate using standoffs in a and a piece

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.459 
plate using standoffs in a and a piece
of<00:00:35.969> flat<00:00:36.329> sheet<00:00:36.840> of<00:00:37.020> something<00:00:38.780> the<00:00:39.780> thing<00:00:40.320> I

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
of flat sheet of something the thing I

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.560 
of flat sheet of something the thing I
like<00:00:40.739> about<00:00:40.770> it<00:00:41.309> is<00:00:41.430> this<00:00:41.730> two<00:00:42.030> pin<00:00:42.180> is<00:00:42.270> really

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
like about it is this two pin is really

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.830 
like about it is this two pin is really
robust<00:00:43.160> I've<00:00:44.160> got<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:45.030> RCX

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
robust I've got the RCX

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
1804 2400 kV motors from RC Mart I chose

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.060 
1804 2400 kV motors from RC Mart I chose
those<00:00:51.570> because<00:00:52.050> they<00:00:52.230> do<00:00:52.289> clockwise<00:00:52.829> and

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
those because they do clockwise and

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.250 
those because they do clockwise and
anti-clockwise<00:00:53.520> motors<00:00:54.300> and<00:00:54.449> threaded

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
anti-clockwise motors and threaded

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.439 
anti-clockwise motors and threaded
screws<00:00:56.210> pop<00:00:57.210> so<00:00:57.570> that<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:58.879> the<00:00:59.879> props<00:01:00.300> are

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
screws pop so that the the props are

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.090 
screws pop so that the the props are
self<00:01:00.600> tightening<00:01:00.899> which<00:01:01.199> I<00:01:01.320> really<00:01:01.649> like<00:01:01.829> on

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
self tightening which I really like on

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.820 
self tightening which I really like on
the<00:01:02.280> DJI<00:01:02.699> phantom<00:01:03.210> and<00:01:03.439> it's<00:01:04.439> something<00:01:04.650> that

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
the DJI phantom and it's something that

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.500 
the DJI phantom and it's something that
I<00:01:04.949> wanted<00:01:05.159> on<00:01:05.309> on<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:05.820> micro<00:01:06.180> corner<00:01:06.390> if<00:01:06.450> I

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
I wanted on on the micro corner if I

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.310 
I wanted on on the micro corner if I

only<00:02:03.799> however<00:02:04.799> it<00:02:05.280> it<00:02:05.670> has<00:02:05.909> about<00:02:06.210> 200

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
only however it it has about 200

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.330 
only however it it has about 200
milliseconds<00:02:07.110> of<00:02:07.140> latency<00:02:07.200> which<00:02:07.920> are<00:02:08.099> tried

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
milliseconds of latency which are tried

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.830 
milliseconds of latency which are tried
and<00:02:08.640> I<00:02:08.729> just<00:02:09.239> can't<00:02:09.450> get<00:02:09.569> my<00:02:09.690> head<00:02:09.720> around

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
and I just can't get my head around

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.570 
and I just can't get my head around
I'm<00:02:12.260> sure<00:02:12.530> with<00:02:12.650> practice<00:02:13.010> you<00:02:13.099> get<00:02:13.250> used<00:02:13.459> to

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
I'm sure with practice you get used to

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.670 
I'm sure with practice you get used to
it<00:02:13.670> but<00:02:14.060> I<00:02:14.120> want<00:02:14.420> to<00:02:14.510> fly<00:02:14.660> this<00:02:14.720> sort<00:02:15.650> of

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
it but I want to fly this sort of

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.790 
it but I want to fly this sort of
through<00:02:16.420> obstacles<00:02:17.420> and<00:02:17.629> around<00:02:17.870> low<00:02:18.590> and

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
through obstacles and around low and

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.890 
through obstacles and around low and
fast<00:02:19.010> so<00:02:19.310> I<00:02:19.340> want<00:02:19.640> something<00:02:19.879> quick<00:02:20.060> so<00:02:20.780> I've

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
fast so I want something quick so I've

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.650 
fast so I want something quick so I've
got<00:02:21.080> the<00:02:21.260> fat<00:02:21.680> shark<00:02:21.920> 600<00:02:22.459> TVL<00:02:22.819> camera<00:02:23.209> which

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
got the fat shark 600 TVL camera which

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.440 
got the fat shark 600 TVL camera which
which<00:02:24.140> I'm<00:02:24.260> using<00:02:24.440> for<00:02:24.739> the<00:02:24.830> fpv<00:02:25.370> feed<00:02:26.150> and

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
which I'm using for the fpv feed and

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.119 
which I'm using for the fpv feed and
then<00:02:26.900> I've<00:02:26.989> got<00:02:27.200> the<00:02:27.319> pilot<00:02:27.590> HD<00:02:27.830> cam<00:02:28.010> where

00:02:28.119 --> 00:02:28.129 
then I've got the pilot HD cam where

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:29.710 
then I've got the pilot HD cam where
I've<00:02:28.220> just<00:02:28.250> fitted<00:02:28.700> for<00:02:28.940> recording<00:02:29.390> because

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
I've just fitted for recording because

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.420 
I've just fitted for recording because
it's<00:02:30.260> nice<00:02:30.379> to<00:02:30.410> have<00:02:30.590> a<00:02:30.709> video<00:02:30.920> of<00:02:31.129> the<00:02:31.190> flights

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
it's nice to have a video of the flights

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.130 
it's nice to have a video of the flights
both<00:02:32.000> for<00:02:32.180> you<00:02:32.269> to<00:02:32.420> look<00:02:32.510> at<00:02:32.690> when<00:02:32.840> you<00:02:32.930> crash

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
both for you to look at when you crash

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.500 
both for you to look at when you crash
and<00:02:33.410> when<00:02:34.040> you<00:02:34.160> don't<00:02:34.310> crash<00:02:34.549> and<00:02:34.760> also<00:02:35.150> to<00:02:35.330> put

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
and when you don't crash and also to put

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.140 
and when you don't crash and also to put
on<00:02:35.569> YouTube<00:02:35.720> or<00:02:36.049> whatever<00:02:36.489> and<00:02:37.489> because<00:02:38.120> of

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
on YouTube or whatever and because of

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.900 
on YouTube or whatever and because of
the<00:02:38.450> shape<00:02:38.660> of<00:02:39.110> the<00:02:39.170> frame<00:02:39.459> you<00:02:40.459> need<00:02:40.580> a<00:02:40.640> really

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
the shape of the frame you need a really

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.000 
the shape of the frame you need a really
short<00:02:41.090> camera<00:02:41.599> to<00:02:41.930> fit<00:02:42.140> easily<00:02:42.590> so<00:02:42.830> that's

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
short camera to fit easily so that's

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.400 
short camera to fit easily so that's
what<00:02:43.250> I've<00:02:43.370> got<00:02:43.400> at<00:02:43.580> the<00:02:43.610> moment<00:02:44.140> the<00:02:45.140> video

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
what I've got at the moment the video

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.370 
what I've got at the moment the video
transmitter<00:02:45.799> I've<00:02:46.010> just<00:02:46.160> put<00:02:46.489> on<00:02:46.579> there<00:02:46.880> the

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
transmitter I've just put on there the

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.440 
transmitter I've just put on there the
RC<00:02:48.380> receiver<00:02:48.739> is<00:02:49.130> underneath<00:02:49.700> doesn't<00:02:50.299> seem

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
RC receiver is underneath doesn't seem

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:51.850 
RC receiver is underneath doesn't seem
to<00:02:50.540> be<00:02:50.630> any<00:02:50.750> issue<00:02:50.959> there<00:02:51.260> at<00:02:51.380> all<00:02:51.530> it<00:02:51.709> flies

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 
to be any issue there at all it flies

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.500 
to be any issue there at all it flies
really<00:02:52.040> well<00:02:52.160> performance<00:02:53.090> I'm<00:02:53.209> really

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
really well performance I'm really

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.650 
really well performance I'm really
pleased<00:02:53.750> with<00:02:53.900> it<00:02:54.140> climbs<00:02:54.799> pretty<00:02:55.280> quickly

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
pleased with it climbs pretty quickly

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.229 
pleased with it climbs pretty quickly
it's<00:02:56.660> certainly<00:02:57.610> exactly<00:02:58.610> what<00:02:58.730> I<00:02:58.760> want<00:02:59.060> and

00:02:59.229 --> 00:02:59.239 
it's certainly exactly what I want and

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:00.940 
it's certainly exactly what I want and
I'm<00:02:59.480> I've<00:02:59.780> crashed<00:03:00.049> it<00:03:00.230> at<00:03:00.379> 5<00:03:00.530> or<00:03:00.650> 6<00:03:00.799> times

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
I'm I've crashed it at 5 or 6 times

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:01.449 
I'm I've crashed it at 5 or 6 times
already

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:01.459 
already

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:03.460 
already
and<00:03:01.819> all<00:03:01.940> I'm<00:03:02.120> breaking<00:03:02.480> is<00:03:02.629> this<00:03:02.840> front<00:03:03.110> left

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
and all I'm breaking is this front left

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:07.059 
and all I'm breaking is this front left
prop<00:03:03.890> which<00:03:04.190> I've<00:03:04.400> broken<00:03:05.410> well<00:03:06.410> I<00:03:06.440> boat<00:03:06.799> to

00:03:07.059 --> 00:03:07.069 
prop which I've broken well I boat to

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:09.009 
prop which I've broken well I boat to
and<00:03:07.400> then<00:03:07.910> fitting<00:03:08.299> this<00:03:08.420> one<00:03:08.629> I<00:03:08.660> was<00:03:08.840> a<00:03:08.870> bit

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:09.019 
and then fitting this one I was a bit

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:10.539 
and then fitting this one I was a bit
heavy-handed<00:03:09.379> and<00:03:09.680> I've<00:03:09.739> actually<00:03:09.890> got<00:03:10.310> a<00:03:10.340> lot

00:03:10.539 --> 00:03:10.549 
heavy-handed and I've actually got a lot

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:13.000 
heavy-handed and I've actually got a lot
of<00:03:10.579> a<00:03:10.700> fatigue<00:03:11.450> crack<00:03:11.510> there<00:03:12.049> so<00:03:12.709> I<00:03:12.739> probably

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
of a fatigue crack there so I probably

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:14.319 
of a fatigue crack there so I probably
fly<00:03:13.310> this<00:03:13.370> one<00:03:13.610> for<00:03:13.730> a<00:03:13.760> bit<00:03:13.879> want<00:03:14.060> the<00:03:14.180> ones

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:14.329 
fly this one for a bit want the ones

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:16.620 
fly this one for a bit want the ones
that<00:03:14.480> I've<00:03:14.569> cracked<00:03:14.959> they've<00:03:15.739> still<00:03:16.040> flown

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
that I've cracked they've still flown

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:20.949 
that I've cracked they've still flown
after<00:03:17.630> the<00:03:17.950> after<00:03:18.950> the<00:03:18.980> mishaps<00:03:19.400> and<00:03:19.959> because

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 
after the after the mishaps and because

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:22.809 
after the after the mishaps and because
I've<00:03:21.109> test<00:03:21.319> flown<00:03:21.620> afterwards<00:03:22.190> but<00:03:22.760> I

00:03:22.809 --> 00:03:22.819 
I've test flown afterwards but I

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:25.150 
I've test flown afterwards but I
wouldn't<00:03:23.090> want<00:03:23.660> to<00:03:23.690> keep<00:03:23.840> using<00:03:24.109> them<00:03:24.410> here

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
wouldn't want to keep using them here

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.370 
wouldn't want to keep using them here
they<00:03:25.400> are<00:03:25.670> so<00:03:26.209> that<00:03:26.480> is<00:03:26.660> the<00:03:26.810> first<00:03:27.109> one<00:03:27.319> I

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.380 
they are so that is the first one I

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:31.089 
they are so that is the first one I
broke<00:03:27.880> and<00:03:28.880> I<00:03:29.329> chipped<00:03:29.599> both<00:03:29.959> tips<00:03:30.440> which<00:03:30.920> I

00:03:31.089 --> 00:03:31.099 
broke and I chipped both tips which I

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:33.160 
broke and I chipped both tips which I
wasn't<00:03:31.400> too<00:03:31.519> worried<00:03:31.700> about<00:03:32.019> it's<00:03:33.019> got<00:03:33.139> a

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
wasn't too worried about it's got a

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.319 
wasn't too worried about it's got a
little<00:03:33.260> stress<00:03:33.620> fracture<00:03:34.160> on<00:03:34.489> the<00:03:34.549> hub<00:03:35.120> there

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:35.329 
little stress fracture on the hub there

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:37.449 
little stress fracture on the hub there
so<00:03:35.690> that<00:03:35.840> that's<00:03:36.230> no<00:03:36.470> good<00:03:36.620> and<00:03:36.859> then<00:03:37.370> the

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:37.459 
so that that's no good and then the

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:41.830 
so that that's no good and then the
second<00:03:37.880> one<00:03:38.049> the<00:03:39.049> tip<00:03:39.290> broke<00:03:39.410> off<00:03:39.739> and<00:03:40.840> it's

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
second one the tip broke off and it's

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.839 
second one the tip broke off and it's
got<00:03:42.049> stress<00:03:42.290> fractures<00:03:42.680> on<00:03:42.799> both<00:03:42.829> these<00:03:43.669> are

00:03:43.839 --> 00:03:43.849 
got stress fractures on both these are

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:46.539 
got stress fractures on both these are
