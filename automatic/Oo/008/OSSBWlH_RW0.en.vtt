00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
to do that because the first two games

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.229

we<00:02:48.010> played<00:02:48.250> neither<00:02:48.549> we<00:02:48.760> didn't<00:02:48.970> spend<00:02:49.120> enough

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
time in the crease and that was our

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:52.890 
time in the crease and that was our
biggest<00:02:51.670> problem<00:02:52.120> because<00:02:52.360> they<00:02:52.480> demanded<00:02:52.840> of

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
biggest problem because they demanded of

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.990 
biggest problem because they demanded of
wicked<00:02:53.230> so<00:02:53.830> today<00:02:54.100> the<00:02:54.220> basic<00:02:54.549> idea<00:02:54.850> was<00:02:54.910> to

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
wicked so today the basic idea was to

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.449 
wicked so today the basic idea was to
have<00:02:55.150> the<00:02:55.269> kitchen<00:02:55.660> and<00:02:55.890> hedge<00:02:56.890> fund<00:02:57.190> the<00:02:57.280> pace

have the kitchen and hedge fund the pace

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:58.860 
have the kitchen and hedge fund the pace
of<00:02:57.610> the<00:02:57.670> pitch<00:02:57.850> because<00:02:58.180> we<00:02:58.390> all<00:02:58.480> thought<00:02:58.660> this

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
of the pitch because we all thought this

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:59.970
