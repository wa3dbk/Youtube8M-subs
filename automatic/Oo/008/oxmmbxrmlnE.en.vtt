 j -c 

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:28.970
 jean-franÃ§ois first had to wait for the player Corsican at the moment 

00:00:28.969 --> 00:00:29.929
 from his deposit 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:32.140
 you are two hours to 12 hours 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.140
 it's a little annoying from the turbine spotter 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:42.680
 the wall sto 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.560
 with the master actually at the beginning is just a basic man that you place and 

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.960
 the others put themselves aside 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.860
 m after it's the same is the choice of rooms the basic man and he hears 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.860
 not 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.760
 once his place is out of basic standard broke 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.450
 four five outgoing players to choose a what you want as skype remains 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.010
 after a good decision to choose c 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:20.290
 to know what makes you turn so you do not jump signed on the tip 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.560
 yet another parameter and 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.630
 and after it's the same, it's a trajectory analysis that goes very fast 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.450
 it did not interfere culture the ball from 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.090
 if there are times where more and more stage a lot of players who alone 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.970
 in front of the trajectory 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.040
 even ol players the opposing team yet to fish their door 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.040
 on the ball 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.880
 in the trapps the order are becoming more dexterous and and the balloons brushed 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.510
 go faster and faster so 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:57.910
 it is also difficult to find quickly analyzed the path to repair after 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:00.480
 it's like going out and she's chosen 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.500
 you look at the challenge of the wages of his because it's going fast 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.880
 a direct free kick I can not afford to try to keep it and the 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.429
 release two meters from goal to goal each time 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:13.019
 it's done it would give access in a separate area there is a lesson 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:16.019
 to take 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:26.670
 here already to keep it in an already healthy corner possible to the nerve and 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.669
 you see it after a while it's mostly 

00:02:29.669 --> 00:02:32.929
 once the disease cnam to lisa trajectory that you said 

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:36.979
 he's a cadre of funds I push to go get her 

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:39.979
 after especially concentrate to clear it as far as possible 

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:44.089
 especially Paris is the only one of the times you can just touch his skin of 

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:47.089
 typed the bar the control fallouts demand for nutella it's in the game 

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:52.169
 as often you can have tried to push him what the cub and tamesna a 

00:02:52.169 --> 00:02:54.069
 dish 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:56.619
 I'm curious about everything you missed legs to push the most 

00:02:56.619 --> 00:02:59.619
 strong enough for the ball for Toulon 

00:03:17.439 --> 00:03:21.359
 against the bayern I see that the ball by jo that will fall back at the last moment 

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:22.339
 I tell myself 

00:03:22.339 --> 00:03:24.989
 but at the moment where is this newspaper the sun 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:28.419
 and here I go for a last-ditch party pushing the air for me the evil 

00:03:28.419 --> 00:03:29.369
 cleared the 

00:03:29.369 --> 00:03:32.529
 get out last arm moment to push her as far as possible and to 

00:03:32.529 --> 00:03:33.759
 this word 

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:36.909
 of timing parade of success 

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:39.400
 the last free kick rolled up the player's 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.609
 the super nes on itself 

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:45.919
 on this one there was two tenths of a second who hesitated located block 

00:03:45.919 --> 00:03:49.539
 what and it's going so fast that what is not in the good time of these dead 

00:04:03.429 --> 00:04:04.639
 it's a lot of 

00:04:04.639 --> 00:04:07.919
 in mental preparation compared to the match of the preparation what 

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:11.759
 we work a lot in one season at least in high season after I can 

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:13.209
 not so much worked for 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:16.680
 never a full week to work 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.150
 nan it's a lot of British know it 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:23.099
 it surprises me this fair 

00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:25.979
 technically speaking you have to call only you have to be clean 

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:28.340
 that is, a maness loan keep the balloons 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:31.159
 it surprised me that's why my indifference 

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:31.399
