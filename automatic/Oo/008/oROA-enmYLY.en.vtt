00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.600
 hello everyone a new little tour of 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.299
 garden 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.519
 in this May 30, 2015 at the request of 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.969
 some to show you a little bit 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:14.759
 the evolutions since the last video 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:16.289
 then tomatoes 1 that are very 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.060
 advanced for the season but that I had 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.029
 started very early in February 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.640
 inside is drunk that will provide 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.599
 So here we have beef heart 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.070
 which starts to grow well 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:32.279
 it's exactly the same for 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:36.660
 cherry tomatoes that I had planted in 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.800
 pot and that starts to produce 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.370
 nice little tomatoes we're not going 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.800
 delay to consume so here on the 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.680
 vegetables that I had planted very, very early 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.649
 so in February of course it was a 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.489
 bet on the weather quality to of 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.530
 this spring 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.440
 he knows that spring has been rather 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.550
 good and it's hot so all 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.739
 tomato plants that I had started 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.840
 early no in the house and that I had 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:04.170
 released a little prematurely resisted 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:06.570
 at the high temperatures of this spring 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:10.860
 now it is not at all certain 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.100
 that this process works from year to year 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.500
 year 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.630
 I think it was a little daring 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.490
 this year and that I may have to 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:21.210
 bad surprises but future valley 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:25.130
 if charlie earth the fruit trees 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.130
 this year are loaded with fruit 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.689
 here are a lot of apples in the in the 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.090
 apple tree just a little problem the 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:36.299
 codling at his frequent so I have 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:41.159
 installed a pheromone trap for 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:43.979
 try to devalue a bit the degree of 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:49.289
 the infestation and see if a treatment 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:50.970
 will be necessary on the vegetable part to 

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:54.149
 strictly speaking so there you go of 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.320
 crazy that I had top last year 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.430
 which they spent the place street la 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.430
 dance and there they are well developed 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.670
 here we started eating first 

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:05.399
 salads of the year the first 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:08.610
 early carrots we also consume 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:12.019
 for fifteen days three weeks the 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:15.530
 wood and snow peas that have taken 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:17.670
 proportions this year I 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.500
 did not imagine a little too big to my 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.970
 taste elsewhere because it's a lot 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:27.180
 shaded vegetables planted between the two 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:30.600
 these are the particular ovens you have 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:32.400
 on the mound of the beasts I'm trying 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:36.959
 but this year small saddlery 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:38.730
 still really small again 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:41.340
 beets and spinach we have 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:44.010
 started to eat the beans against the 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.560
 wall of the building that are naturally 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.870
 consume them fold the rare moments 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.430
 so here it is you have the boots of 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.190
 straw that you presented in the 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:56.130
 last video and about which I 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:58.230
 wanted to experiment with culture then 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:02.640
 you remember I told you 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:05.430
 that I 'm experimenting with 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.109
 side on the right boots the process 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.989
 we will say usual described in 

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:12.380
 books which is to bring a 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:15.200
 fertilizer rich in nitrogen 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:18.260
 on the boot to be able to consider a 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.390
 vegetable growing and on the boot of 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.420
 left 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:26.750
 I simply replaced the fertilizer with 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:29.300
 a good a good contribution of nothing for 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:31.370
 try to bring enough votes 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:31.700
 to consider the growth of 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:34.280
 tomatoes 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.750
 good I presented the same day of 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.820
 tomatoes on both boots and 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:41.270
 today I do not see any 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:42.950
 blatant difference between growth 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:45.320
 says the tomatoes on each of the two 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:47.420
 boots so that's kind of encouraging 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:49.040
 will see in the excitement sell be but 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:50.390
 the future how are things going 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.440
 continue and if tomato production 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:53.180
 is identical on every line of boots 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.890
 but his hand would suit me well 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:57.350
 we can replace fertilizers 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:59.420
 nitrogen from commerce by a simple 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:01.300
 ring for memory I'm still 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:07.120
 rhine quiet there on the boot 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:09.620
 you have here d barley is they are 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:12.410
 equally well developed and which 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:19.730
 have been producing for a fortnight 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:21.770
 near the decades all potatoes 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:23.870
 recent in the grass and mulch 

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:26.750
 parsnip peas again from 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:29.600
 carrots and green beans that I have 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:33.020
 sowed recently are vegetables a 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:36.080
 little particular bit that I test as 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:38.729
 the case of the stoop crowne japan the 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:48.169
 perpetual executioner here is the snow 

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:53.479
 roja there are sources artichokes 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:57.449
 against the wall that are well revived 

00:04:53.479 --> 00:04:59.460
 and finally, as always, the sphere 

00:04:57.449 --> 00:04:59.699
 so you remember on the part 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:02.009
 left 

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:06.210
 I had this is not early in the season 

00:05:02.009 --> 00:05:09.059
 of February there carrots of 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:10.830
 radish turnips obviously weights 

00:05:09.059 --> 00:05:12.629
 all these vegetables have been consumed and 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:15.059
 then there on the right side 

00:05:12.629 --> 00:05:16.919
 so gillet puts some tomatoes 

00:05:15.059 --> 00:05:19.469
 zucchini and eggplant which is 

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:22.949
 also a lot of favored again 

00:05:19.469 --> 00:05:25.559
 do a convenient beef heart well 

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:27.330
 advanced for the season and zucchini 

00:05:25.559 --> 00:05:30.080
 that we have been consuming since almost 

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:30.080
 three weeks 

00:05:31.969 --> 00:05:38.089
 that's pretty much for the garden so in 

00:05:36.689 --> 00:05:41.839
 end May 2015 

00:05:38.089 --> 00:05:41.839
 Well, I'll see you soon
