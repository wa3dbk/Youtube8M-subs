00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
this is not treated well this tree will

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.020 
this is not treated well this tree will
start<00:01:03.510> to<00:01:03.660> lose<00:01:03.840> its<00:01:04.080> ability<00:01:04.229> to<00:01:04.559> have

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.030 
start to lose its ability to have

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.520 
start to lose its ability to have
photosynthesis<00:01:06.030> and<00:01:06.240> a<00:01:06.900> lot<00:01:07.080> of<00:01:07.170> these<00:01:07.260> leaves

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
photosynthesis and a lot of these leaves

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.080 
photosynthesis and a lot of these leaves
will<00:01:07.710> starts<00:01:08.010> to<00:01:08.100> drop<00:01:08.280> off<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:08.670> tree<00:01:08.850> a

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
will starts to drop off the tree a

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.359 
will starts to drop off the tree a
number<00:01:09.600> of<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:09.780> branches<00:01:10.140> were<00:01:10.200> breaking<00:01:11.189> and

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
number of the branches were breaking and

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:12.920
