 follow a diet that is limited 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:10.210
 in some micronutrients and increase 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:11.619

 food and then rather than giving 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.330
 plans that are strict or 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:34.619
 determined in time so rather of the 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:36.759
 long term change some habits and 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.830
 we know it's now 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:40.479
 now that it's more efficient than 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:44.860
 to make punctual diets we go 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:45.789

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.560
 in fact he still has the support 

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:50.110
 artificial in chorus they a pipe that 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.899
 fate of a team that goes into the 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:54.759
 not in the stomach that allows him 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:55.780
 to have to have enough to eat this 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:56.860
 that they are still not doing very well 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.200
 feed through the mouth 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.789
 after this brief medical summary sylvie and 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.350
 luxury will explain to a patient a 

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:02.890
 way of feeding by his double 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.659
 venous route 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:09.640
 but first of all you have to present your 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:12.850
 colleague also 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:15.310
 dieticians then this bottle does that 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:17.950
 brings you glucose alain that's at 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.330
 say that of sugar and salt with 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.560
 water is to hydrate you saw 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.420
 you do not have the right to drink 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.040
 so it's true that while waiting for you 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.019
 can eat quite normally 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.690
 and enough not to lose 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:30.310
 weight we will continue with the probe with 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.750
 food crafts entry sense 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.620
 it's when a patient does not eat and 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.660
 he loses weight 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.670
 involuntarily he will lose strength 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.170
 he will do especially the muscles and the 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.720
 challenge at that moment that it make him 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.670
 regain weight admires in Libya 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.320
 favorite side of the profession otherwise 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.440
 it's also the teaching done 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.310
 to teach passersby I know very 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.810
 rewarding I wish a good end 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.980
 of the day one of the roles of the dietician 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.690
 is also to choose a diet 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.079
 healthy to reduce the risks of 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.880
 diseases 

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:56.440
 history of avoiding heart attacks 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.359
 Following a king size burger over 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.890
 for a patient that there is a pathology 

00:02:58.359 --> 00:03:01.690
 like a cardiovascular disease we're going 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.700
 rather make them a teaching she 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.950
 privileged food for precisely 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.379
 prior notice 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.480
 a possible second second attack 

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:11.310
 a second heart attack for a 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.319
 patient than anorexic or bulimic 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.819
 the treatment is much longer and 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:16.500
 it is rather we will treat the 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:18.209
 patient's eating behavior 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.220
 listen I call you the subject of the lady 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:22.110

 infectious all but actually the 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:29.849
 dietitian assesses nutritional status 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:32.160

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:34.080
 of food decides the menu there 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.310
 do not forget to turn off the light and 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.750
 we go back to the kitchen because they 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.280
 also assist staff for the 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.299
 meal preparation control the 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.580

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:45.079

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:51.239

 in any case one thing is sure he is 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:59.940
 rarely alone my work with 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.799

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:03.510
