this<00:01:57.540> is<00:01:57.720> going<00:01:57.960> to<00:01:58.050> help<00:01:58.260> blend<00:01:58.500> the<00:01:58.650> two

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
this is going to help blend the two

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.890 
this is going to help blend the two
colors<00:01:58.830> from<00:01:59.430> the<00:01:59.760> brow<00:01:59.940> highlight<00:02:00.210> color<00:02:00.660> to

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:00.900 
colors from the brow highlight color to

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.020 
colors from the brow highlight color to
the<00:02:01.020> regular<00:02:01.410> lid<00:02:02.040> color<00:02:02.340> and<00:02:02.670> it's<00:02:02.790> going<00:02:02.970> to

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
the regular lid color and it's going to

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.930 
the regular lid color and it's going to
make<00:02:03.150> it<00:02:03.300> look<00:02:03.420> a<00:02:03.660> little<00:02:04.050> bit<00:02:04.260> more<00:02:04.820> of<00:02:05.820> a

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:05.940 
make it look a little bit more of a

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.030 
make it look a little bit more of a
gradient<00:02:06.450> effects<00:02:06.780> that's<00:02:06.990> not<00:02:07.200> so<00:02:07.440> hard<00:02:07.470> next

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:08.040 
gradient effects that's not so hard next

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
I'm going to be mixing two colors

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.510 
I'm going to be mixing two colors
together<00:02:33.870> so<00:02:34.290> first<00:02:34.470> I'm<00:02:34.650> going<00:02:34.770> to<00:02:34.830> take<00:02:34.980> foxy

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
together so first I'm going to take foxy

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.490 
together so first I'm going to take foxy
the<00:02:35.550> same<00:02:35.820> color<00:02:36.060> we<00:02:36.180> just<00:02:36.390> used<00:02:36.660> and<00:02:36.930> then<00:02:37.410> I'm

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
the same color we just used and then I'm

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:38.900 
the same color we just used and then I'm
going<00:02:37.620> to<00:02:37.710> mix<00:02:37.860> a<00:02:37.980> little<00:02:38.130> bit<00:02:38.340> of<00:02:38.430> booty<00:02:38.730> call

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
going to mix a little bit of booty call

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.130 
going to mix a little bit of booty call
in<00:02:39.120> it<00:02:39.240> so<00:02:39.360> that's<00:02:39.540> going<00:02:39.630> to<00:02:39.690> give<00:02:39.870> it<00:02:39.990> a

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
in it so that's going to give it a

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:41.690 
in it so that's going to give it a
little<00:02:40.470> bit<00:02:40.680> of<00:02:40.710> that<00:02:40.830> iridescent<00:02:41.190> shimmer

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
little bit of that iridescent shimmer

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.210 
little bit of that iridescent shimmer
that<00:02:42.060> Kerry<00:02:42.480> had<00:02:42.750> in<00:02:42.990> her<00:02:43.500> inner<00:02:43.710> tear<00:02:44.010> ducts

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
that Kerry had in her inner tear ducts

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.040 
that Kerry had in her inner tear ducts
area<00:02:44.610> but<00:02:44.820> it's<00:02:44.970> still<00:02:45.120> a<00:02:45.180> little<00:02:45.330> bit<00:02:45.510> map<00:02:45.750> so

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
area but it's still a little bit map so

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:47.930 
area but it's still a little bit map so
I'm<00:02:46.140> just<00:02:46.290> going<00:02:46.440> to<00:02:46.500> be<00:02:46.620> mixing<00:02:46.950> the<00:02:47.070> two<00:02:47.250> with

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
I'm just going to be mixing the two with

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.960 
I'm just going to be mixing the two with
my<00:02:48.240> precision<00:02:48.780> tapered<00:02:49.410> p<00:02:49.770> 86<00:02:50.520> brush<00:02:50.820> from

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
my precision tapered p 86 brush from

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.570 
my precision tapered p 86 brush from
Sigma<00:02:51.590> so<00:02:52.590> we're<00:02:52.710> just<00:02:52.740> going<00:02:52.980> to<00:02:53.190> mix<00:02:53.370> those

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
Sigma so we're just going to mix those

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
Sigma so we're just going to mix those
together<00:02:53.960> tap<00:02:54.960> off<00:02:55.200> any<00:02:55.620> excess<00:02:56.220> and<00:02:56.490> then

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:56.600 
together tap off any excess and then

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:00.590 
together tap off any excess and then
start<00:02:57.600> about<00:02:57.930> right<00:02:58.260> here<00:02:58.800> and<00:02:59.390> work<00:03:00.390> your<00:03:00.540> way

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
start about right here and work your way

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:05.900 
start about right here and work your way
into<00:03:00.900> the<00:03:01.080> inner<00:03:01.260> corner<00:03:04.340> so<00:03:05.340> this<00:03:05.610> brush<00:03:05.880> is

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
into the inner corner so this brush is

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:07.610 
into the inner corner so this brush is
really<00:03:06.330> nice<00:03:06.480> because<00:03:06.720> it<00:03:06.930> has<00:03:07.050> this<00:03:07.170> pointed

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
really nice because it has this pointed

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.100 
really nice because it has this pointed
edge<00:03:07.830> which<00:03:08.160> makes<00:03:08.400> it<00:03:08.520> really<00:03:08.760> easy<00:03:08.900> to<00:03:09.900> bring

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
edge which makes it really easy to bring

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.530 
edge which makes it really easy to bring
it<00:03:10.230> up<00:03:10.520> here<00:03:11.520> without<00:03:11.640> getting<00:03:11.940> all<00:03:12.180> over<00:03:12.450> the

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
it up here without getting all over the

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:17.650 
it up here without getting all over the
place<00:03:13.790> so<00:03:14.790> again<00:03:14.970> starting<00:03:15.450> about<00:03:15.540> right<00:03:15.840> here

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:17.660 
place so again starting about right here

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:22.670 
place so again starting about right here
working<00:03:18.660> the<00:03:18.690> shadows<00:03:20.570> up<00:03:21.570> and<00:03:22.080> into<00:03:22.350> the

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
working the shadows up and into the

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.260 
working the shadows up and into the
teria<00:03:23.070> okay<00:03:23.489> next<00:03:23.670> I'm<00:03:23.850> going<00:03:23.970> to<00:03:24.030> take<00:03:24.209> that

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:24.270 
teria okay next I'm going to take that

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:27.050 
teria okay next I'm going to take that
face<00:03:24.630> that<00:03:24.660> I<00:03:24.930> applied<00:03:25.260> earlier<00:03:25.770> and<00:03:26.040> just<00:03:26.070> add

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
face that I applied earlier and just add

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:31.510 
face that I applied earlier and just add
it<00:03:27.420> right<00:03:27.450> beneath<00:03:28.400> my<00:03:29.400> lower<00:03:29.640> lash<00:03:29.970> line<00:03:30.270> and

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:31.520 
it right beneath my lower lash line and

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:36.470 
it right beneath my lower lash line and
applying<00:03:32.520> this<00:03:33.650> with<00:03:34.650> my<00:03:34.860> ring<00:03:35.130> finger<00:03:35.430> and<00:03:35.970> it

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
applying this with my ring finger and it

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.390 
applying this with my ring finger and it
can<00:03:36.630> be<00:03:36.660> sloppily<00:03:37.200> applied<00:03:37.620> that's<00:03:37.920> totally

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
can be sloppily applied that's totally

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.050 
can be sloppily applied that's totally
okay<00:03:38.880> but<00:03:39.769> basically<00:03:40.769> just<00:03:41.250> adding<00:03:41.670> a<00:03:41.760> base
