how to get this 99 is very simple a lot
of<00:02:05.850> people<00:02:06.000> thinks<00:02:06.509> it's<00:02:06.630> a<00:02:06.719> very<00:02:06.930> complex

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
of people thinks it's a very complex

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:11.240 
of people thinks it's a very complex
skill<00:02:07.920> but<00:02:08.160> it's<00:02:08.340> not<00:02:08.580> I<00:02:09.530> made<00:02:10.530> cannonballs<00:02:11.069> up

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
then I did gold bars 299 simple not hard

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.150 
then I did gold bars 299 simple not hard
at<00:02:18.910> all<00:02:19.030> I<00:02:19.300> would<00:02:19.599> take<00:02:19.810> my<00:02:20.050> gold<00:02:20.500> or<00:02:20.709> bring<00:02:21.040> it

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
over here smelt it down you super uh

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.640 
over here smelt it down you super uh
that<00:02:24.250> super<00:02:24.640> heat<00:02:24.790> spell<00:02:25.120> that<00:02:25.810> smell<00:02:26.379> it's<00:02:26.500> an

item super heat and it would double the
speed<00:02:30.849> of<00:02:31.150> my<00:02:31.390> smelting<00:02:31.930> so<00:02:32.620> it<00:02:32.769> doubles<00:02:33.130> my<00:02:33.250> XP

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
speed of my smelting so it doubles my XP

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.790 
speed of my smelting so it doubles my XP
I'd<00:02:33.760> go<00:02:33.910> back<00:02:34.090> to<00:02:34.269> my<00:02:34.360> bank<00:02:34.630> bank<00:02:34.989> come<00:02:35.290> back<00:02:35.470> do

i<00:04:11.380> do<00:04:12.040> that<00:04:12.310> for<00:04:12.549> two<00:04:12.700> reasons<00:04:12.730> the<00:04:13.650> first

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
i do that for two reasons the first

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:17.430 
i do that for two reasons the first
reason<00:04:14.980> is<00:04:15.430> so<00:04:16.359> i<00:04:16.389> don't<00:04:16.660> get<00:04:16.780> burnt<00:04:17.019> out<00:04:17.229> on

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:17.440 
reason is so i don't get burnt out on

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.199 
reason is so i don't get burnt out on
the<00:04:17.590> skill<00:04:17.859> because<00:04:18.280> if<00:04:18.579> you<00:04:18.700> stay<00:04:18.910> in<00:04:18.940> one

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.209 
the skill because if you stay in one

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:20.969 
the skill because if you stay in one
spot<00:04:19.239> the<00:04:19.599> whole<00:04:19.750> time<00:04:19.930> it<00:04:20.169> really<00:04:20.349> sucks<00:04:20.709> if

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:20.979 
spot the whole time it really sucks if

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:23.070 
spot the whole time it really sucks if
you're<00:04:21.820> especially<00:04:22.180> if<00:04:22.570> you're<00:04:22.720> gonna<00:04:22.870> be

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 
you're especially if you're gonna be

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.810 
you're especially if you're gonna be
here<00:04:23.260> a<00:04:23.289> while<00:04:23.409> like<00:04:23.680> fire<00:04:23.919> making<00:04:24.159> I<00:04:24.430> did<00:04:24.640> that

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
here a while like fire making I did that

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:26.140 
here a while like fire making I did that
I<00:04:25.120> did<00:04:25.510> not

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.150 
I did not

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:28.240 
I did not
leave<00:04:26.240> that<00:04:26.270> place<00:04:26.600> till<00:04:26.900> I<00:04:26.930> got<00:04:27.110> 99<00:04:27.350> you<00:04:28.130> know

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:28.250 
leave that place till I got 99 you know

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:31.510 
leave that place till I got 99 you know
and<00:04:29.169> that<00:04:30.169> was<00:04:30.350> fine<00:04:30.590> because<00:04:30.889> it<00:04:31.160> was<00:04:31.250> really

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:31.520 
and that was fine because it was really

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:35.020 
and that was fine because it was really
fast<00:04:31.759> this<00:04:32.210> skill<00:04:32.509> is<00:04:32.540> very<00:04:32.870> slow<00:04:33.290> so<00:04:34.100> I<00:04:34.130> have

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.030 
fast this skill is very slow so I have

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:36.969 
fast this skill is very slow so I have
to<00:04:35.210> be<00:04:35.330> able<00:04:35.479> to<00:04:35.690> move<00:04:35.840> around<00:04:36.020> get<00:04:36.530> some<00:04:36.740> stuff

00:04:36.969 --> 00:04:36.979 
to be able to move around get some stuff

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:39.100 
to be able to move around get some stuff
done<00:04:37.009> go<00:04:37.699> to<00:04:37.759> town<00:04:38.000> to<00:04:38.180> a<00:04:38.210> farm<00:04:38.479> room<00:04:38.720> come<00:04:38.930> back

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.110 
done go to town to a farm room come back

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:41.950 
done go to town to a farm room come back
art<00:04:39.350> we're<00:04:39.620> ready<00:04:39.860> to<00:04:39.949> go<00:04:40.130> again<00:04:40.690> so<00:04:41.690> that's

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:41.960 
art we're ready to go again so that's

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:43.810 
art we're ready to go again so that's
the<00:04:42.050> first<00:04:42.320> reason<00:04:42.560> the<00:04:42.979> second<00:04:43.370> reason<00:04:43.490> is

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:43.820 
the first reason the second reason is

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:46.560 
the first reason the second reason is
because<00:04:44.060> prices<00:04:44.570> go<00:04:44.990> up<00:04:45.020> and<00:04:45.410> down<00:04:45.620> so<00:04:46.070> much

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:46.570 
because prices go up and down so much

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:52.930

of a sudden cannonballs drop in price to
200<00:05:05.240> GP<00:05:05.840> each<00:05:06.080> well<00:05:06.650> guess<00:05:06.889> what<00:05:07.130> happened<00:05:07.720> you

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:08.720 
200 GP each well guess what happened you

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:10.120 
200 GP each well guess what happened you
just<00:05:08.960> got<00:05:09.110> screwed<00:05:09.380> over<00:05:09.590> a<00:05:09.770> lot<00:05:09.979> of<00:05:10.010> money

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:10.130 
just got screwed over a lot of money

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:11.830 
just got screwed over a lot of money
because<00:05:10.789> you're<00:05:11.150> still<00:05:11.330> bars<00:05:11.539> are<00:05:11.660> going<00:05:11.780> to

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:11.840 
because you're still bars are going to

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:14.680 
because you're still bars are going to
drop<00:05:11.990> also<00:05:12.470> so<00:05:13.070> if<00:05:13.190> you<00:05:13.310> do<00:05:13.490> it<00:05:13.639> at<00:05:13.760> 5k<00:05:14.060> at<00:05:14.630> a

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:14.690 
drop also so if you do it at 5k at a

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:17.020 
drop also so if you do it at 5k at a
time<00:05:14.960> you<00:05:15.710> won't<00:05:15.979> get<00:05:16.160> screwed<00:05:16.550> over<00:05:16.699> and<00:05:16.970> if

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:17.030 
time you won't get screwed over and if

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:21.080 
know what I mean so that's why I do them

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:24.040 
know what I mean so that's why I do them
at<00:05:21.199> 5k<00:05:21.520> yeah<00:05:22.520> i<00:05:22.550> could<00:05:22.760> buy<00:05:23.090> tons<00:05:23.539> of<00:05:23.750> them<00:05:23.930> at
