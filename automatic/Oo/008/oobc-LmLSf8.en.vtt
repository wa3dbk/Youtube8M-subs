00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:00.820 
half arts now in the beginning this is

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:02.580 
half arts now in the beginning this is
great<00:02:01.060> it's<00:02:01.270> like<00:02:01.420> having<00:02:01.630> barbarian<00:02:02.230> except

that<00:02:02.740> you<00:02:02.830> get<00:02:02.950> that<00:02:03.100> extra<00:02:03.430> little

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:03.580 
that you get that extra little

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.020 
that you get that extra little
protection<00:02:04.060> whenever<00:02:04.480> someone<00:02:04.720> hits<00:02:04.870> you<00:02:04.960> now

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:08.800 
this is also great because running at

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.620 
this is also great because running at
the<00:02:08.920> block<00:02:09.250> it<00:02:09.610> just<00:02:09.789> does<00:02:09.970> it<00:02:10.090> for<00:02:10.119> you<00:02:10.420> it's

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
the block it just does it for you it's

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.309 
the block it just does it for you it's
against<00:02:10.990> someone<00:02:11.230> the<00:02:11.350> sword

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 
against someone the sword

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:13.809 
against someone the sword
it's<00:02:12.409> not<00:02:12.530> as<00:02:12.680> good<00:02:12.920> as<00:02:13.010> blocking<00:02:13.340> by<00:02:13.670> any

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 
it's not as good as blocking by any

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:16.690 
it's not as good as blocking by any
means<00:02:14.120> but<00:02:14.450> it<00:02:14.780> helps<00:02:15.170> a<00:02:15.290> lot<00:02:15.499> and<00:02:15.920> if<00:02:16.579> you

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
means but it helps a lot and if you

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.309 
means but it helps a lot and if you
block<00:02:16.969> why<00:02:17.269> you<00:02:17.329> do<00:02:17.599> this<00:02:17.719> you'll<00:02:17.930> get<00:02:18.079> even

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:18.319 
block why you do this you'll get even

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:20.530 
block why you do this you'll get even
more<00:02:18.590> protection<00:02:19.280> which<00:02:19.400> is<00:02:19.519> just<00:02:19.670> insane<00:02:20.299> for

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
more protection which is just insane for

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.959 
more protection which is just insane for
the<00:02:20.629> beginning<00:02:20.989> now<00:02:21.680> in<00:02:21.829> the<00:02:21.920> middle<00:02:22.189> most

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:22.969 
the beginning now in the middle most
