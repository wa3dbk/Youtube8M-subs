my interviews with risky business that's
very<00:04:24.090> important<00:04:24.569> I<00:04:24.720> mean<00:04:24.900> there<00:04:25.259> in<00:04:25.500> a<00:04:25.590> sense

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
very important I mean there in a sense

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.219 
very important I mean there in a sense
you<00:04:26.100> can<00:04:26.400> afford<00:04:26.699> to<00:04:26.880> boost<00:04:27.090> but<00:04:27.479> the<00:04:27.630> investor

00:04:28.219 --> 00:04:28.229 
you can afford to boost but the investor

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:31.969 
you can afford to boost but the investor
there<00:04:29.419> obviously<00:04:30.419> that's<00:04:30.780> risen<00:04:31.050> forth<00:04:31.470> they

00:04:31.969 --> 00:04:31.979 
there obviously that's risen forth they

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:34.070 
there obviously that's risen forth they
should<00:04:32.430> know<00:04:32.610> that<00:04:32.910> at<00:04:33.300> the<00:04:33.389> same<00:04:33.569> time<00:04:33.870> I

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 
should know that at the same time I

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:35.689 
should know that at the same time I
think<00:04:34.259> they'll<00:04:34.650> be<00:04:34.830> more<00:04:34.979> painful<00:04:35.280> for<00:04:35.460> you<00:04:35.669> to

00:04:35.689 --> 00:04:35.699 
think they'll be more painful for you to

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:37.790 
think they'll be more painful for you to
see<00:04:35.970> them<00:04:36.120> blossom<00:04:36.449> like<00:04:37.199> all<00:04:37.380> of<00:04:37.470> them<00:04:37.620> lost

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 
see them blossom like all of them lost

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.830 
see them blossom like all of them lost
money<00:04:38.069> whether<00:04:38.759> their<00:04:39.000> coach<00:04:39.270> as<00:04:39.599> their

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
money whether their coach as their

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.330 
money whether their coach as their
mentor<00:04:40.259> it'd<00:04:40.410> be<00:04:40.500> the<00:04:40.650> same<00:04:40.680> as<00:04:41.069> you<00:04:41.280> know

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
mentor it'd be the same as you know

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:43.339 
mentor it'd be the same as you know
telling<00:04:41.940> a<00:04:42.000> child<00:04:42.030> to<00:04:42.509> go<00:04:42.990> on<00:04:43.080> a<00:04:43.169> holiday

00:04:43.339 --> 00:04:43.349 
telling a child to go on a holiday

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:45.110 
telling a child to go on a holiday
that's<00:04:43.740> a<00:04:43.860> disaster<00:04:44.160> I<00:04:44.460> mean<00:04:44.610> you<00:04:44.669> don't<00:04:44.789> want

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120 
that's a disaster I mean you don't want

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:48.499 
that's a disaster I mean you don't want
anybody<00:04:45.720> you<00:04:46.139> make<00:04:46.560> a<00:04:46.590> mistake<00:04:47.039> or<00:04:47.370> to<00:04:47.520> lose<00:04:47.669> so

00:04:48.499 --> 00:04:48.509 
anybody you make a mistake or to lose so

00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:50.839 
anybody you make a mistake or to lose so
they<00:04:48.930> all<00:04:49.050> have<00:04:49.199> an<00:04:49.319> update<00:04:49.590> I<00:04:49.800> suspect<00:04:50.520> if<00:04:50.699> we

00:04:50.839 --> 00:04:50.849 
they all have an update I suspect if we

00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:52.640 
they all have an update I suspect if we
have<00:04:51.000> enough<00:04:51.360> investment<00:04:51.870> opportunities

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:52.650 
have enough investment opportunities

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:54.740 
have enough investment opportunities
we'll<00:04:53.099> be<00:04:53.220> able<00:04:53.310> to<00:04:53.460> present<00:04:53.699> a<00:04:54.090> lower<00:04:54.389> risk

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:54.750 
we'll be able to present a lower risk

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:57.589 
we'll be able to present a lower risk
maybe<00:04:55.440> lower<00:04:55.740> return<00:04:56.360> opportunity<00:04:57.360> as<00:04:57.449> well

00:04:57.589 --> 00:04:57.599 
maybe lower return opportunity as well

00:04:57.599 --> 00:04:59.839 
maybe lower return opportunity as well
as<00:04:57.720> a<00:04:57.780> higher<00:04:58.139> risk<00:04:58.470> high<00:04:59.160> return<00:04:59.520> on

00:04:59.839 --> 00:04:59.849 
as a higher risk high return on

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:01.520 
as a higher risk high return on
opportunity<00:05:00.509> so<00:05:00.900> that<00:05:01.020> people<00:05:01.320> will<00:05:01.500> have

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:01.530 
opportunity so that people will have

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:03.980 
opportunity so that people will have
that<00:05:01.740> opportunity<00:05:02.310> I<00:05:02.699> can<00:05:02.910> deal<00:05:03.630> or<00:05:03.810> no<00:05:03.960> deal

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:03.990 
that opportunity I can deal or no deal

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:07.159 
that opportunity I can deal or no deal
to<00:05:04.259> be<00:05:04.470> going<00:05:05.030> to<00:05:06.030> rush<00:05:06.449> when<00:05:06.720> do<00:05:06.870> we<00:05:06.990> take

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:07.169 
to be going to rush when do we take

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:09.170 
to be going to rush when do we take
because<00:05:07.949> this<00:05:08.070> looks<00:05:08.310> like<00:05:08.550> it's<00:05:08.759> gonna<00:05:08.940> work

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:09.180
