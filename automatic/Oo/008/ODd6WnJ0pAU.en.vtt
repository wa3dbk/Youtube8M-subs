00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:08.920
 a koran school 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.630
 the hard thing about it 

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:17.810
 high-fur bouquet is the way of 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:18.410
 definitely hold on to that couple's start 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:21.380
 steal 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:23.080
 it is difficult there very soon 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:26.420
 hold bouquet 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:28.100
 you start with 12 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:29.420
 the flower that is in the middle of phuket 

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:32.419
 coming 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:34.430
 yes we are in a certain way between you 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:37.610
 five fingers 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:43.239
 the second flower that comes there is hiding 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:49.400
 to lie the third flower that comes four 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:52.430
 lines parallel to the second fourth 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:54.739
 flower comes there again 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:58.339
 parallel to it but you see now 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:01:00.670
 all the effect of koran school 

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:00.670
 tie 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:14.180
 this also comes in a spiral again 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:16.880
 to lie on it 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:19.280
 the flowers are on the left 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:22.130
 bottom of stems to then the 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:25.880
 right side that you should also pay attention to 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:29.240
 is the ratio of the part above 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:32.630
 your hand over the vase or what 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:35.090
 in the vase comes in the phase is a third 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:37.940
 from the stem 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.530
 from the fathers or above your hand is two 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.770
 third of the 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.770
 quiet 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:57.550
 always obliquely 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:02:00.990
 on top of it you see mountains that we thumb and 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:03.990
 forefinger as ever closer together 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.990
 come 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:09.690
 it is already the opening of the vase 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:23.499
 and that holding becomes plus therefore 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:26.299
 always easier but it remains beautiful 

00:02:23.499 --> 00:02:29.209
 spiraling 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:30.439
 working you go wrong if you get the 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:33.530
 flowers suddenly 

00:02:30.439 --> 00:02:34.400
 right side and nouns side 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.250
 left 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.739
 look because then it can show but it is 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:44.239
 less easy because there is now 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:51.439
 he almost goes in the way this way 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:55.510
 automatically fall well and so you get 

00:02:51.439 --> 00:02:55.510
 a sheaf of bouquet bound 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:08.530
 blind gap blind knot means that 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:12.490
 your start and finally off the table 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:14.319
 soon to see what has been eliminated 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:18.250
 blind creep is used with one 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:21.940
 parallel bound well known 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:24.910
 end of language with the upward direction 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:28.330
 flowers at the bottom is coming 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:33.970
 by this bus will soon be to the arena 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:40.660
 language spoken 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:41.860
 pretty tight to steal back and forth 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:45.970
 the rope 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:49.810
 control parallel to or 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:56.980
 so the rope comes side by side 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:04:00.280
 not over each other and I do was tight 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:07.049
 because yes those cities that move differently 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:12.090
 a little more must be put together 

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:12.090
 end of the rope through the loop 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:23.710
 and it should be at the top 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:27.669
 you keep it and then the 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:32.350
 button below 

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:34.090
 total and then you cut the top and the 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:36.510
 bottom 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:36.510
 cut your way 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:51.080
 and you have parallel 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:51.080
 connected blind gap
