00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.970
 hey this is a free guess in 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:09.059
 a parkbox that is a cedar wood 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.650
 crate of herbs lay in it of ax and 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.179
 how we do it all in the 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.780
 today's result of barbecue 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.410
 rheinhessen 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.410
 have lots of fun with it 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.230
 Here are the ingredients that we for 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.120
 our crust roast from the herbs 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.860
 crate need get going with s course 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.030
 crusty roast that here a nice one 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.530
 piece of ham with one 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.810
 neat start on top so well 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:00.080
 Perfect for roast pork and then it is 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:02.930
 here's the herbal box that's from ax 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:04.760
 blow this is a counter in wooden box 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:06.470
 which are half different herbs in it 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.260
 I just read in front of bordeaux leaves 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:11.330
 rosemary sage lavender chili pods 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:13.250
 and curry leaves are in there and is 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:16.010
 So extra for meat there is also 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.360
 which for fischer and I am very 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:19.010
 I was curious about that at the 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.810
 The opening of grillfuerst I have the 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:23.090
 met and was totally thrilled 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.190
 from these boxes and also from these 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.170
 passport whatsoever things in the wood 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.729
 I could do that later 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:32.000
 give it a try but now first here 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:33.710
 this top box a bit today 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.560
 has to go faster today too 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.000
 again my quick vacuum of her here 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.410
 so that we, the meat is just now 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.850
 then quickly get on the grill 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:42.050
 can and now I prepare that 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.790
 maybe first and how we do that 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:46.160
 I'll show you now first 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:48.260
 is now the rind of the ham 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.910
 scratched and there you pay attention 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.140
 best to score on it like that 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.610
 meat fibers run 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.050
 I want that meatier after that 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.520
 have cut so now put down 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:57.860
 The fibers are now running in the direction 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.620
 and that means when I'm the rhombus now 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.540
 I cut the so that the cut 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:03.770
 each to the places where I show that 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.159
 Then cut meat later 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.050
 would like to 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:08.530
 It is important in the black you need 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:12.140
 a really sharp knife but otherwise 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:14.540
 did that in a fasko and I 'm waiting 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:17.830
 even just scratching and not after 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.830
 possibility into the meat no 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:23.200
 so the meat is ready so far 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:25.240
 the black scratched and now put 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.110
 I cut the piece with the black meat 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:30.100
 downward 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:37.630
 in my quick vacuum of hers and this 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:39.580
 the bottle of white beer was there anyway 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:41.110
 finished now now comes the lid 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.100
 on it and then I will for one now 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.480
 marinate for an hour 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.430
 if you are not in a vacuum right now 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.890
 you should already have two of your power 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.950
 hours count that just the rind 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:52.510
 to be nice with us so much 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.680
 can suck fully or stop 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:58.350
 also a bit of taste 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:03:01.300
 So take cover and now 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:02.920
 pull the balcony for those who 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.300
 now have taken care and noticed 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.070
 if the degree of beer rhine 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.870
 tilted there is still carbon dioxide in it 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:09.880
 Vacuum dissolves over time 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:12.940
 that is basically perfect 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:15.459
 right but if he vacuum twice 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:18.850
 you let your quasi this vacuum pump 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:21.100
 the carbonic acid from the beer and yes 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:22.810
 So there should not be much left 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.250
 just stay after 20 minutes 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.840
 Also check again if the vacuum is still 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.350
 If necessary, then that is again 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.239
 renew 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:30.760
 but now it is definitely 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:31.900
 first time right in the vacuum says in it and 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.860
 I'll just leave it that way for now 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.799
 marinate further 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:38.560
 after about an hour, the meat is 

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:39.670
 Well marinated and the vacuum is still 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.640
 available I'll leave it again 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:47.410
 air in baccum their rows and take 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:51.160
 the lid off and here is now 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:53.260
 the height of box ax blow and see 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:56.350
 as I said a counting box with the 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:59.380
 herbs in there and I place on it 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:03.510
 now the meat the beer is so 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:03.510
 really nice drafted into the saved 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:09.480
 The free rate fits right in 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:12.910
 this box purely 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:14.680
 Now I'm still on the rattle 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:16.299
 a little rough salt or a few 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.549
 Salt flakes and a pure in these 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:23.229
 slots I was cut because the 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:25.360
 makes for a wonderful crust yes then 

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:28.060
 it is prepared meat and we 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:30.460
 can over to the grill term 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:31.139
 preheated to a temperature of 180 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.020
 Degree 

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:35.550
 perfect for the hear box so here in the 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:36.990
 direct area made that means so 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:39.180
 left and right in the coal baskets with 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:41.969
 the coals here is our top box with 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:44.069
 We are really asking the post now 

00:04:41.969 --> 00:04:45.810
 just here are the middle Rhine lids 

00:04:44.069 --> 00:04:47.099
 to and just make sure that the 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:50.639
 temperature in the beginning is not 

00:04:47.099 --> 00:04:52.560
 over 180 degrees, that's what the herbs are all about 

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:53.909
 give their roms nice meat 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:56.180
 can be and thermometer 

00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:58.949
 plug in for temperature control 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:01.819
 the target core temperature is 67 degrees 

00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:05.189
 and then let's see what it looks like 

00:05:01.819 --> 00:05:08.580
 after exactly two hours we have one 

00:05:05.189 --> 00:05:10.080
 core temperature of 67 degrees and reached 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:13.680
 it smells incredible here in the carport 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:14.759

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:20.189

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:22.500
 and now we see new items, which sees 

00:05:20.189 --> 00:05:24.599
 very good and it smells fantastic 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:26.909
 I will now out of the grill 

00:05:24.599 --> 00:05:28.860
 take out and then ten more minutes 

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:31.770
 let it rest and then I can do it 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:33.270
 finally cut so he is done 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:36.150
