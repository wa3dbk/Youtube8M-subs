brand new board perform this year it's

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.620 
brand new board perform this year it's
what<00:00:08.760> we're<00:00:08.880> calling<00:00:09.030> our<00:00:10.070> urban<00:00:11.070> board

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:11.630 
what we're calling our urban board

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:14.120 
what we're calling our urban board
basically<00:00:12.630> the<00:00:12.809> whole<00:00:13.139> idea<00:00:13.349> with<00:00:13.590> urban<00:00:13.980> a

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
basically the whole idea with urban a

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.189 
basically the whole idea with urban a
lot<00:00:14.670> of<00:00:14.790> snowboarding<00:00:15.299> has<00:00:15.660> gone<00:00:15.960> to<00:00:16.109> the

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
lot of snowboarding has gone to the

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.460 
lot of snowboarding has gone to the
streets<00:00:16.529> not<00:00:17.180> specifically<00:00:18.180> just<00:00:18.420> on<00:00:18.690> the

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
streets not specifically just on the

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.939 
streets not specifically just on the
mountain<00:00:20.270> so<00:00:21.270> this<00:00:21.480> one's<00:00:21.689> kind<00:00:22.529> of<00:00:22.590> built

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
mountain so this one's kind of built

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.640 
mountain so this one's kind of built
with<00:00:23.279> that<00:00:23.460> in<00:00:23.609> mind<00:00:23.640> designed<00:00:24.300> for<00:00:24.650> Congreve

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
with that in mind designed for Congreve

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.859 
with that in mind designed for Congreve
I<00:00:25.800> his<00:00:26.010> hand<00:00:26.340> rails<00:00:26.580> things<00:00:26.880> like<00:00:27.060> that<00:00:27.240> so<00:00:27.750> the

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
I his hand rails things like that so the

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.050 
I his hand rails things like that so the
thing<00:00:28.050> with<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.349> contract<00:00:28.859> this<00:00:29.130> has<00:00:29.429> what's

thing with the contract this has what's
called<00:00:30.240> the<00:00:30.359> badass<00:00:30.810> package<00:00:31.320> so<00:00:32.070> since<00:00:32.550> this

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
called the badass package so since this

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.040 
called the badass package so since this

the<00:00:48.690> profile<00:00:49.260> of<00:00:49.410> this<00:00:49.620> is<00:00:49.920> what's<00:00:50.340> called

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
the profile of this is what's called

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.799 
the profile of this is what's called
pops<00:00:50.910> camber<00:00:51.420> so<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.980> camber<00:00:53.370> board<00:00:53.699> but<00:00:54.300> the

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
pops camber so the camber board but the

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.889 
pops camber so the camber board but the
camera<00:00:55.320> doesn't<00:00:55.350> go<00:00:55.770> all<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.100> way<00:00:56.250> out<00:00:56.370> to<00:00:56.910> the

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
camera doesn't go all the way out to the

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.529 
camera doesn't go all the way out to the
contact<00:00:58.530> points<00:00:58.890> you<00:00:59.550> got<00:00:59.699> a<00:00:59.760> little<00:00:59.940> pop<00:01:00.210> zone

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
contact points you got a little pop zone

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.540 
contact points you got a little pop zone
here<00:01:00.899> which<00:01:01.739> is<00:01:01.890> going<00:01:02.039> to<00:01:02.100> give<00:01:02.280> you<00:01:02.370> more

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
here which is going to give you more

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.479 
here which is going to give you more
power<00:01:02.850> for<00:01:03.239> higher<00:01:03.660> ollies<00:01:04.199> and<00:01:04.489> additional

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
power for higher ollies and additional

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.940 
power for higher ollies and additional
benefit<00:01:05.939> for<00:01:06.180> that<00:01:06.330> is<00:01:06.600> being<00:01:07.229> able<00:01:07.500> to<00:01:07.650> press

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
benefit for that is being able to press

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.940 
benefit for that is being able to press
and<00:01:08.280> lock<00:01:08.670> onto<00:01:08.939> a<00:01:09.119> Ledge<00:01:09.420> or<00:01:09.720> a<00:01:09.780> rail<00:01:10.049> things

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
and lock onto a Ledge or a rail things

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.460 
and lock onto a Ledge or a rail things
like<00:01:11.100> that<00:01:11.280> so<00:01:11.640> it's<00:01:12.390> really<00:01:12.780> rad<00:01:13.200> you're

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
like that so it's really rad you're

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:14.960 
like that so it's really rad you're
going<00:01:13.590> to<00:01:13.650> get<00:01:13.770> a<00:01:13.799> lot<00:01:14.100> more<00:01:14.130> energy<00:01:14.729> out<00:01:14.760> of

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
going to get a lot more energy out of

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.990 
going to get a lot more energy out of
this<00:01:15.090> thing<00:01:15.409> then<00:01:16.409> say<00:01:17.070> a<00:01:17.100> reverse<00:01:17.520> camber<00:01:17.820> a

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
this thing then say a reverse camber a

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.859 
this thing then say a reverse camber a
rocker<00:01:18.330> board<00:01:19.850> another<00:01:20.850> cool<00:01:21.119> thing<00:01:21.180> here<00:01:21.420> is

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
rocker board another cool thing here is

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.810 
rocker board another cool thing here is
0<00:01:22.860> to<00:01:23.070> 60<00:01:23.460> days<00:01:23.720> so<00:01:24.720> 0<00:01:25.650> to<00:01:25.740> 60<00:01:26.040> base<00:01:26.220> is<00:01:26.430> designed

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
0 to 60 days so 0 to 60 base is designed

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.590 
0 to 60 days so 0 to 60 base is designed
to<00:01:27.180> get<00:01:27.659> you<00:01:27.689> up<00:01:27.960> to<00:01:27.990> speed<00:01:28.229> quickly<00:01:29.450> it's<00:01:30.450> not

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
to get you up to speed quickly it's not

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.340 
to get you up to speed quickly it's not
a<00:01:30.659> real<00:01:30.990> high-end<00:01:31.310> like<00:01:32.310> top-end<00:01:32.880> speed<00:01:33.350> but

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
a real high-end like top-end speed but

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.429 
a real high-end like top-end speed but
it's<00:01:34.500> meant<00:01:34.740> for<00:01:34.860> quick<00:01:35.250> drop<00:01:35.520> ins<00:01:36.320> you<00:01:37.320> know

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
it's meant for quick drop ins you know

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.230 
it's meant for quick drop ins you know
you<00:01:37.500> got<00:01:37.740> 20<00:01:38.070> feet<00:01:38.280> to<00:01:38.460> get<00:01:38.610> up<00:01:38.729> to<00:01:38.850> speed<00:01:38.970> to

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
you got 20 feet to get up to speed to

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.710 
you got 20 feet to get up to speed to
get<00:01:39.329> out<00:01:39.479> ollie<00:01:39.720> onto<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.200> rail<00:01:41.390> so<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.570> way<00:01:42.659> I

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
get out ollie onto the rail so the way I

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.109 
get out ollie onto the rail so the way I
do<00:01:42.869> that<00:01:43.140> it's<00:01:43.530> just<00:01:43.829> the<00:01:44.040> difference<00:01:44.670> in<00:01:44.820> kind

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
do that it's just the difference in kind

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.999 
do that it's just the difference in kind
of<00:01:45.149> a<00:01:45.270> molecular<00:01:45.780> makeup<00:01:45.960> of<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:46.380> base<00:01:46.560> so

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
of a molecular makeup of the base so

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.800 
of a molecular makeup of the base so
nothing<00:01:47.909> more<00:01:48.060> than<00:01:48.210> just<00:01:48.450> rearranged

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 
nothing more than just rearranged

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:52.139 
nothing more than just rearranged
heels<00:01:50.049> in<00:01:50.229> the<00:01:50.320> base<00:01:50.500> but<00:01:50.829> it<00:01:51.520> doesn't<00:01:51.880> have<00:01:51.970> as

00:01:52.139 --> 00:01:52.149 
heels in the base but it doesn't have as

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:54.450 
heels in the base but it doesn't have as
much<00:01:52.329> hot<00:01:52.840> top<00:01:53.259> end<00:01:53.470> speed<00:01:53.530> but<00:01:53.979> it<00:01:54.100> will<00:01:54.280> get

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
much hot top end speed but it will get

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.889 
much hot top end speed but it will get
you<00:01:54.610> up<00:01:54.670> speed<00:01:55.000> faster<00:01:55.509> than<00:01:55.689> another<00:01:56.619> boards

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
you up speed faster than another boards

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:03.770 
you up speed faster than another boards
full<00:01:58.899> twin<00:01:59.170> tip<00:01:59.380> board<00:02:01.950> you<00:02:02.950> know<00:02:03.039> graphically

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
full twin tip board you know graphically

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.320 
full twin tip board you know graphically
definitely<00:02:04.780> stands<00:02:05.079> out<00:02:05.350> a<00:02:06.340> couple<00:02:07.090> of<00:02:07.240> the
