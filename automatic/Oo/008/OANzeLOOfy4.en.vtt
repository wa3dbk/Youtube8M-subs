00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:08.970
 in the second part now so the 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.130
 Setting the firmware to start 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.929
 We arduino and open again 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.870
 the freshly downloaded rapid-i 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:22.650
 vermeer in the subordinate rabbit ear 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:25.740
 the file repeats pde okay i do 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:28.410
 that a little bit bigger then that 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.050
 Configuration points the first 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.910
 Do you have to choose which electronics 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.239
 had a little at the time 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.579
 break i use the 33 how to do that 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.579
 list sees the ram control with the 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.950
 arduino mega 25 60 if you the 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.170
 You need to use sanguinum control 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.530
 the arena software with the sanguinum 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:52.250
 board files patch drive system 0 at 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:55.079
 All printers with three axes equal 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:59.510
 We can do the steps per millimeter 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:02.399
 all later still peripheral to adjust 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:06.000
 the temperature is or do I have that 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:09.500
 atc it would be the 8 otherwise the 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.500
 Rest stay that way 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.649
 then it goes to the configuration for the 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.299
 second extruder of the section 

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:27.659
 I am interested in my printer 

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:31.909
 not now 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:35.700
 So all that remains the way it is then 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:37.649
 here comes the hot bed because I have the 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:41.789
 adjust temperature sensors because I 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:44.399
 because the same would have otherwise 

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:47.909
 i offer bed manager on bang bang 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:50.039
 almost update because I'm a relay 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.429
 in between, I can not do that 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:52.429
 regulate 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:02:00.430
 then we are already approaching the part 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:04.960
 which brings the most problems 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:07.210
 the configuration of the and stops as 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.880
 First I switch with trudi pull up 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:12.520
 Resistances in the places where I am 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:17.110
 Kanisch stopps have connected 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:20.740
 with me that's the case with x-men at y 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:24.070
 min and at z-max next you can 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:26.350
 you have to invert the dedusted dust 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:29.500
 do so when you close so has completely 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:31.420
 normal switch uses in the best case 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.610
 one opens then one can on everything if 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.860
 can represent the states stoppages the 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.280
 open the contact as soon as you press 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.230
 become 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.540
 Next, you have the printer still 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.940
 say where you have a stopps that was over 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:47.680
 have already told me as in the enix 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:50.400
 in y and at max the setting must 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.780
 also with the collapse somehow 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.220
 by the way, correspond by the way 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.630
 If you have your decision you do not have to 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.470
 I would then have in the rams 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:59.620
 electronics also in the max slot 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.239
 connect 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.430
 Here I have the firmware again 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:04.450
 Explicitly say where my limit switches 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.299
 stuck position 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:13.630
 as I said it at -1 in and 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:16.530
 at 1 max software limit switch position 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:16.530
 I out 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.090
 the maxlive settings in the 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.890
 section are also something very important 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.330
 but I can still later in the retiro 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:36.380
 adjust without the firmware new 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:41.240
 Upload recharge recharge 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:44.800
 of course the next section can 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:44.800
 so stay first 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:56.580
 and I think we are almost through 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:10.120
 now comes the section 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:15.280
 the construction came that should remember us 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:18.400
 there he is 115 1200 which must later in the 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:20.850
 raptors are set to work with the 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:23.320
 to communicate with printers 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:26.680
 Here comes the section with the eco 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:28.090
 if you like the settings 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:31.030
 you just want to reset the 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:33.360
 once here on any other number 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:37.710
 to change then the whole reset and 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:37.710
 you have for the basic attitude 

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:43.410
 down here comes the one 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:45.750
 section for sd cards support and lcd 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:47.070
 display that has my printer synonymous there 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:47.550
 I will therefore ran back later 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:49.320
 have to 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:51.500
 but then I do it in a breath 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:54.510
 with the hardware 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:56.120
 that should not stop us now 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:59.340
 to set up a printer 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:01.340
 yes it was that already again 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:03.780
 I am still talking about this now 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:06.360
 now the renamed nino was with the 

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:09.990
 Next time do not search that is called 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:11.670
 new file ending next hurdle 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:13.050
 successfully mastered next time 

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:14.670
 then we have that on the arduino and 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:17.990
 just look if the raptors that 

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:17.990
 recognizes whole also reasonably
