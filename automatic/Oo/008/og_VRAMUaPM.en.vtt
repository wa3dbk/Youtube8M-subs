 if my day had color it would be blue but the 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:23.490
 blue of all colors and free colors 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:26.180
 and free them to run them in felt 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:30.480
 all directions 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:34.500
 if my day had a serious texture 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:37.980
 Soft soft is like pillow 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:41.700
 the goose of the one who when 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.690
 you feel the richest person in the 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.770
 world 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:51.260
 if my day had temperature 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:54.350
 would be the one that touches us gently 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:58.890
 month that civilly 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:01:04.409
 if my day had a serious song 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:08.580
 robinho titles of john hearn ban if my 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:12.590
 a key would be the one that 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.590
 opens all doors 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:20.360
 if my day had a taste it would be the 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:21.950
 taste different from your fragrance 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.960
 in my language 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.960
 After I kiss your neck 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:35.900
 if my day had a place it would be that 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:39.520
 that after you arrive never again 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:47.090
 You want to leave because you want to stay 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:51.710
 Do not even stay that day. 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:56.240
 had things would be full of partners 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:02:01.390
 married with butterflies that transparent 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:06.440
 they would fly around us spinning 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:10.220
 whirling to leave us all and 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:14.540
 tontos plummeted years in blue 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:19.130

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:23.780
 shimmering of all colors and already 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:25.130
 knew that one day he would feel 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:30.400
 integers 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:35.120
 in a delicious mix that laughs and cries 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:37.750
 and that he never wants to leave 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:52.350
