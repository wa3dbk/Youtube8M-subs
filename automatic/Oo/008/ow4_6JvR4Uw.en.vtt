that<00:01:55.470> it'll<00:01:55.950> swing<00:01:56.310> correctly<00:01:56.810> then<00:01:57.810> I<00:01:57.990> took<00:01:58.049> a

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
that it'll swing correctly then I took a

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.910 
that it'll swing correctly then I took a
piece<00:01:58.770> of<00:01:58.799> fencing<00:01:59.399> 83<00:02:00.390> inches<00:02:00.509> wide<00:02:00.920> attached

piece of fencing 83 inches wide attached

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.130 
piece of fencing 83 inches wide attached
to<00:02:02.250> one<00:02:02.579> by<00:02:02.729> six<00:02:03.030> at<00:02:03.149> the<00:02:03.180> top<00:02:03.450> gonna<00:02:03.719> two<00:02:04.020> by

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
to one by six at the top gonna two by

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.109 
to one by six at the top gonna two by
four<00:02:04.380> at<00:02:04.469> the<00:02:04.530> bottom<00:02:04.890> that's<00:02:05.430> just<00:02:05.670> extra

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
four at the bottom that's just extra

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.479 
four at the bottom that's just extra
scrap<00:02:06.450> we<00:02:06.630> head<00:02:06.810> line<00:02:07.020> around<00:02:07.290> and<00:02:07.649> then<00:02:08.160> I<00:02:08.220> put

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.740 
verticals
in<00:02:09.820> it<00:02:10.270> and<00:02:10.360> then<00:02:10.720> a<00:02:10.930> couple<00:02:11.170> diagonals<00:02:11.800> used

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
in it and then a couple diagonals used

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:18.030 
in it and then a couple diagonals used
air<00:02:13.750> staple<00:02:14.260> gun<00:02:14.460> for<00:02:15.460> that<00:02:16.830> actually<00:02:17.830> that<00:02:17.920> we

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
air staple gun for that actually that we

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.530 
air staple gun for that actually that we
just<00:02:18.250> gotten<00:02:18.610> so<00:02:18.850> all<00:02:19.120> this<00:02:19.360> is<00:02:19.600> recycled<00:02:20.230> the

sections to be able to stretch too in

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.410 
sections to be able to stretch too in
this<00:02:52.780> case<00:02:53.020> we're<00:02:53.290> using<00:02:53.760> this<00:02:54.760> post<00:02:55.120> to

this one you you clip one side in like
this<00:03:51.820> and<00:03:52.500> then<00:03:53.500> this<00:03:53.710> side<00:03:53.950> comes<00:03:54.250> around<00:03:54.640> and

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
this and then this side comes around and

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:59.100 
this and then this side comes around and
you<00:03:55.900> pop<00:03:56.140> it<00:03:56.170> and<00:03:56.740> you<00:03:57.520> pump<00:03:57.790> it<00:03:58.000> on<00:03:58.210> here<00:03:58.990> and

from the other side of the fence but

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:04.710 
from the other side of the fence but
then<00:04:03.010> you<00:04:03.100> pull<00:04:03.370> this<00:04:03.550> up<00:04:03.730> and<00:04:04.060> around<00:04:04.390> and

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
then you pull this up and around and

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.710 
then you pull this up and around and
close<00:04:05.080> this<00:04:05.610> you'll<00:04:06.610> see<00:04:06.820> it<00:04:06.970> won't<00:04:07.180> one<00:04:07.450> here

close this you'll see it won't one here

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:10.980 
close this you'll see it won't one here
that<00:04:07.870> I<00:04:07.930> already<00:04:08.110> done

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:10.990 

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:13.440 

and<00:04:11.530> about<00:04:11.770> how<00:04:11.920> much<00:04:12.070> did<00:04:12.310> this<00:04:12.430> cost<00:04:12.490> this<00:04:13.390> is

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:21.520 
an acre or so that probably caught the

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:23.040
