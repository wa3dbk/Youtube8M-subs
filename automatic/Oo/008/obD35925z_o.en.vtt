thought I'd do it again now and my
internet<00:01:49.850> was<00:01:50.180> down<00:01:50.450> because<00:01:50.750> my<00:01:51.399> provider

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:52.399 
internet was down because my provider

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:55.630 
internet was down because my provider
had<00:01:52.850> stuffed<00:01:53.270> me<00:01:53.450> over<00:01:53.750> they<00:01:54.740> signed<00:01:55.490> me<00:01:55.580> up

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
had stuffed me over they signed me up

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.060 
had stuffed me over they signed me up
onto<00:01:55.939> the<00:01:56.030> wrong<00:01:56.179> package<00:01:56.439> charging<00:01:57.439> me<00:01:57.530> $40<00:01:58.039> a

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.070 
onto the wrong package charging me $40 a

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:59.380 
onto the wrong package charging me $40 a
month<00:01:58.130> more<00:01:58.460> than<00:01:58.490> I<00:01:58.670> was<00:01:58.759> supposed<00:01:58.970> to<00:01:59.090> be<00:01:59.210> and

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
month more than I was supposed to be and

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.410 
month more than I was supposed to be and
so<00:01:59.420> we<00:01:59.570> had<00:01:59.750> to<00:01:59.840> get<00:01:59.899> that<00:02:00.020> sorted<00:02:00.380> out<00:02:01.270> and<00:02:02.270> was

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
so we had to get that sorted out and was

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.240 
so we had to get that sorted out and was
again<00:02:02.780> for<00:02:03.289> some<00:02:03.409> reason<00:02:03.649> the<00:02:03.709> internet<00:02:03.979> been

slowed<00:02:04.610> to<00:02:04.909> dial<00:02:05.179> up<00:02:05.330> speed<00:02:06.039> it<00:02:07.039> wasn't<00:02:07.369> that

00:02:07.419 --> 00:02:07.429 
slowed to dial up speed it wasn't that

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:09.190

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:30.099 
you play with these guns on scrapyard
you'd<00:03:28.850> pretty<00:03:29.060> much<00:03:29.120> be<00:03:29.359> guaranteed<00:03:29.389> a<00:03:29.870> nuke

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:30.109 
you'd pretty much be guaranteed a nuke

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:33.580 
you'd pretty much be guaranteed a nuke
if<00:03:30.260> you<00:03:30.350> the<00:03:30.500> only<00:03:30.709> one<00:03:30.859> using<00:03:31.069> them<00:03:32.590> because

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
if you the only one using them because

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:35.349 
if you the only one using them because
they<00:03:33.859> just<00:03:33.889> had<00:03:34.160> so<00:03:34.190> much<00:03:34.519> range<00:03:34.880> I<00:03:35.060> mean<00:03:35.209> they

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:35.359 
they just had so much range I mean they

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:37.360 
they just had so much range I mean they
had<00:03:35.569> more<00:03:36.079> than<00:03:36.230> double<00:03:36.560> the<00:03:36.680> range<00:03:36.889> and<00:03:37.220> the

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
had more than double the range and the

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.760 
had more than double the range and the
power

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:37.770 
power

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:39.650 
power
it<00:03:38.400> was<00:03:38.490> constantly<00:03:38.850> one-hit-kill<00:03:39.240> when<00:03:39.570> he

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
it was constantly one-hit-kill when he

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.480 
it was constantly one-hit-kill when he
had<00:03:39.780> them<00:03:39.870> akimbo<00:03:40.170> and<00:03:40.500> there<00:03:41.040> was<00:03:41.160> a<00:03:41.190> glitch

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:41.490 
had them akimbo and there was a glitch

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:43.580 
had them akimbo and there was a glitch
where<00:03:41.730> if<00:03:41.790> he<00:03:41.880> ran<00:03:42.060> bullying<00:03:42.540> and<00:03:42.810> you<00:03:42.930> had<00:03:43.050> FMJ

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
where if he ran bullying and you had FMJ

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.110 
where if he ran bullying and you had FMJ
and<00:03:43.740> akimbo<00:03:43.950> on<00:03:44.220> you<00:03:44.460> could<00:03:44.640> keep<00:03:44.760> that<00:03:44.820> power

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
and akimbo on you could keep that power

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.730 
and akimbo on you could keep that power
and<00:03:45.360> range<00:03:45.570> but<00:03:45.810> I<00:03:45.870> think<00:03:46.290> it's<00:03:46.380> been<00:03:46.530> patched

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:46.740 
and range but I think it's been patched

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:48.800 
and range but I think it's been patched
I<00:03:47.040> haven't<00:03:47.280> tried<00:03:47.460> it<00:03:47.640> but<00:03:47.820> I<00:03:48.090> didn't<00:03:48.720> really

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
I haven't tried it but I didn't really

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.980 
I haven't tried it but I didn't really
feel<00:03:48.990> up<00:03:49.170> feel<00:03:49.830> like<00:03:49.980> giving<00:03:50.370> it<00:03:50.460> a<00:03:50.520> go<00:03:50.990> no

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:51.990 
feel up feel like giving it a go no

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:53.270 
feel up feel like giving it a go no
