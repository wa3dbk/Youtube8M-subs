 and in more detail everything that I have 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:20.289

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:23.830

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:29.560
 but well, I'm going to make a summary 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:31.570
 of everything that has been part of the 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.370
 main cars and weapons and everything 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.920

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:37.210
 taught in the previous video that is the 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.380
 first I have come up today that I will leave 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:39.730
 in the description if you want to see it 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:41.530
 what are cars and weapons 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:43.870
 main and now I will comment 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.490
 everything he could find other than that 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:46.960
 within the games is worth first 

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:48.700
 we have this vehicle that is only in 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.470
 the online mode that we can buy it in 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:52.000
 the normal vehicle store this 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:53.440
 you are seeing right now it is a 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.940
 vehicle that has nothing of the other 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.650
 world of special but good because it is 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.420
 pretty funny after we can 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:00.670
 find in the clothing store a lot 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.650
 of garments and well then new sets 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.479
 that if you talk to him the clerk or 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:05.680
 the store clerk because we 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:07.270
 will give some new sets that what 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.560
 we will have the bottom part that 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.140
 we can find that the truth 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.520
 pretty cool to the military or to the thief 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.350
 we can dress there as we want 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:17.079
 we can take a normal uniform 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:19.000
 uniform with uniform helmet with a 

00:01:17.079 --> 00:01:20.470
 mask and complete and good well there 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.180
 different types that as you are seeing 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:23.710
 here I will leave it there is a time for 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.030
 that you can see everything after this 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.470
 there to see also some new 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.970
 masks that have got into the game that 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.619
 the truth is that they are pretty cool 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:31.270
 If I'm not mistaken, they are some that are called 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:32.590
 combat masks and there are others that are 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:34.509
 like skulls that I think are also 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.070
 new and good because the truth is that we 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:38.710
 they are pretty cool pretty funny 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:40.179
 and well they stick with all the suit and 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.039
 the equipment that has been put in the dlc 

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:43.869
 obviously I have also noticed that 

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:46.270
 As you can see , you can put the emblem 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:47.530
 in the chest to what is the suit not the 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.390
 we put on the emblem of the 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.679
 crisis and you can put it here good had 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.939
 the one of the crew to play with 

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:53.590
 subscribers was not in my crew 

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:54.610
 principal but good just to 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.649
 that you know that it is a detail that 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:58.450
 I can put that in if we go to the 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:00.009
 section of the weapons store we are going to 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.349
 can find a lot of new 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:03.670
 countries inside the parachutes that is 

00:02:02.349 --> 00:02:04.899
 what is the coating of the 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.399
 parachute that you already know you could 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:07.990
 put of some countries previously 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:09.759
 Well now we are going to have a 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.170
 lots of new countries the truth is 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:13.060
 that there are quite a lot of them 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.290
 at that point it's pretty good and 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.330
 Well, also other things that have 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:17.670
 stuck as it has appeared 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.560
 and that is that for example when a person 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.540
 online comes with a helicopter with a 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.700
 plane leaves signaled on the map as 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.090
 that comes with that or that comes off as 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.500
 a helicopter the propeller or an airplane 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.180
 when a person comes online 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.680
 before you just get a point that 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.920
 was approaching I did not know if they came to you in 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.750
 helicopter plane walking by car 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.700
 Well now it's worth it comes out at all times 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.290
 in what kind of vehicle, well, that 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.970
 person also here looking at the 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:45.540
 rockstar page because they tell us that it has 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:47.400
 put a new type of games in the 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.290
 creative way to be able to create those that do not 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.270
 was before that is the last team 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:54.900
 stand up that this is a game if I do not 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:57.060
 wrong is like in call of duty search 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.680
 and destroy not what it is or it does not reappear 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.770
 simply when he dies he can no longer 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.600
 reappear and well they have gotten this 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:05.700
 creative mode to be able to create games 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:08.100
 This type also have included the 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.959
 rounds for the creator mode also what 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.970
 that we can start several 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:13.560
 rounds worth not only not only once but 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:16.410
 what can we do to put it to 67 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.640
 rounds and we can play longer 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:19.290
 You can also include this from the 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.210
 rounds in capture mode it's worth not 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.100
 were available in the creator mode 

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:24.870
 and now if they have gotten it and 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.790
 Well, here I'm going to leave on the screen a 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:29.730
 list of games that have gotten I think 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:32.040
 which are all from the last team in 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.090
 I'll leave the list and the levels and 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.490
