and<00:02:22.290> your<00:02:23.290> internet<00:02:23.620> you<00:02:23.680> should<00:02:23.859> be<00:02:24.340> working

00:02:24.539 --> 00:02:24.549 
and your internet you should be working

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:30.509 
and your internet you should be working
at<00:02:24.819> this<00:02:24.909> point<00:02:25.920> if<00:02:27.090> that<00:02:28.090> doesn't<00:02:28.450> work<00:02:29.519> you

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:30.519 
at this point if that doesn't work you

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:35.309 
at this point if that doesn't work you
can<00:02:30.780> change<00:02:31.780> also<00:02:32.019> change<00:02:32.439> the<00:02:33.569> server<00:02:34.569> to<00:02:34.870> a

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:35.319 
can change also change the server to a

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:40.110 
can change also change the server to a
second<00:02:36.189> option<00:02:36.639> and<00:02:38.370> that<00:02:39.370> would<00:02:39.549> be<00:02:39.730> this

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
second option and that would be this

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:52.020 
second option and that would be this
would<00:02:40.599> be<00:02:41.400> 208<00:02:43.859> 6<00:02:44.859> 7<00:02:47.579> to<00:02:48.989> 202<00:02:49.989> to<00:02:50.200> foe<00:02:50.500> and<00:02:51.030> hit

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
would be 208 6 7 to 202 to foe and hit

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.319 
would be 208 6 7 to 202 to foe and hit
ok<00:02:52.389> and<00:02:52.629> then<00:02:53.200> it<00:02:53.290> should<00:02:53.439> work<00:02:53.560> but<00:02:54.329> hopefully
