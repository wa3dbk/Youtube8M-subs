00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:13.070
 the animal encyclopedia today we 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:15.410
 we found in the lion's enclosure 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:18.919
 and juvenile tigers that were bred 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:22.249
 by nec and joana and caesar from his 

00:00:18.919 --> 00:00:25.279
 birth these copies as well as 

00:00:22.249 --> 00:00:26.689
 his parents grandparents and great grandparents have 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:28.789
 been taught with techniques of 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:30.769
 meekness that have led to these 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:33.199
 species can coexist with other 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:38.750
 species such as dogs and 

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:40.699
 humans recently received 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.309
 the visit of caretakers of the zoo of 

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:45.550
 belgium and professionals and veterinarians 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:48.469
 of the Association of Zoos of Brazil 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:50.320
 all agreed that in order to 

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:53.359
 interpret the techniques of meekness 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:55.160
 we should get rid of those prejudices and 

00:00:53.359 --> 00:00:56.480
 open the mind to be able to understand what 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.089
 It is happening at the zoo 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:01.730
 the cats the printing techniques or 

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:04.549
 early imprint are being applied 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.900
 as a new methodology in the management 

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:07.130
 of zoos 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.010
 when we hear the words 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:12.770
 zoos immediately our mind 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:16.010
 It makes reference to an animal that lives 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.900
 locked up under bad conditions and lives 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:20.420
 totally sacrificed to a confinement 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:23.240
 permanent is meekness technique 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:26.210
 it's just the opposite the 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:29.120
 animal can leave its environment can 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:31.750
 make your walks and the zoo 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:34.850
 LujÃ¡n has been included in a new 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:37.460
 classification of named zoos 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:39.880
 zoos of contact or zoos of 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.880
 investment 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.960
 the meekness technique is very 

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:48.569
 beneficial for the life of animals 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.569
 who are in captivity in 

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:54.000
 actually this animal and now it's 

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:55.829
 resting peacefully under the 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.929
 a man's hands can get out of his 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:00.479
 enclosure to walk can coexist with 

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:02.459
 other specimens lack stress and 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:05.130
 in the face of any type of disease, it is not 

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:07.920
 necessary to apply closing techniques or 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:11.580
 tighten to be able to treat them is very 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:16.319
 easy to access them and be able to cure them 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:18.599
 when they need to invite you to 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:21.090
 come to the lujÃ¡n zoo to see the 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:22.470
 result of what is the technique of 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.620
 meekness applied in this 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.620
 establishment
