00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
you can even use it on concrete and

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.179 
you can even use it on concrete and
clean<00:00:27.599> up<00:00:27.750> your<00:00:27.930> pavement<00:00:28.170> of<00:00:28.859> course<00:00:29.039> that

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
clean up your pavement of course that

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.310 
clean up your pavement of course that

the<00:01:19.909> material<00:01:20.909> this<00:01:21.299> was<00:01:21.479> made<00:01:21.659> of<00:01:21.810> 19<00:01:22.200> for

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
the material this was made of 19 for

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.670 
the material this was made of 19 for
1960<00:01:23.670> something<00:01:24.090> was<00:01:24.630> kind<00:01:24.840> of<00:01:24.869> a<00:01:24.960> nylon<00:01:25.380> thing

1960 something was kind of a nylon thing
i<00:01:25.890> added<00:01:26.369> these<00:01:26.490> cranks<00:01:26.880> this<00:01:27.270> used<00:01:27.659> to<00:01:27.750> be

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
i added these cranks this used to be

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.310 
i added these cranks this used to be
just<00:01:28.049> wing<00:01:28.290> nuts<00:01:28.530> and<00:01:28.799> then<00:01:29.579> over<00:01:29.850> here<00:01:30.320> what

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
just wing nuts and then over here what

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.980 
just wing nuts and then over here what
these<00:01:31.470> are<00:01:31.680> is<00:01:31.799> they<00:01:31.920> keep<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.369> the<00:01:33.270> hopper<00:01:33.689> in

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
these are is they keep the the hopper in

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.069 
these are is they keep the the hopper in
the<00:01:34.140> bay<00:01:34.640> and<00:01:35.640> you<00:01:35.790> click<00:01:36.360> that<00:01:36.540> out<00:01:36.720> and<00:01:36.900> you

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
the bay and you click that out and you

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.510 
the bay and you click that out and you
would<00:01:37.200> lift<00:01:37.380> that<00:01:37.530> up<00:01:37.740> and<00:01:37.950> same<00:01:38.189> thing<00:01:38.340> for

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
would lift that up and same thing for

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.130 
would lift that up and same thing for
that<00:01:38.640> side<00:01:39.140> over<00:01:40.140> here<00:01:40.170> this<00:01:40.890> work<00:01:41.130> hooks<00:01:41.369> on

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
that side over here this work hooks on

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.300 
that side over here this work hooks on
and<00:01:43.610> that<00:01:44.610> comes<00:01:44.850> out<00:01:45.000> very<00:01:45.240> easily<00:01:46.280> one<00:01:47.280> of

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
and that comes out very easily one of

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.219 
one thing I like about this particular
sweeper<00:01:58.890> this<00:01:59.399> is<00:01:59.610> not<00:01:59.790> too<00:02:00.000> big<00:02:00.240> and<00:02:00.630> it's

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
sweeper this is not too big and it's

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.370 
sweeper this is not too big and it's
very<00:02:01.530> heavy<00:02:01.829> so<00:02:02.520> it<00:02:02.640> stays<00:02:02.880> to<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.149> ground<00:02:03.420> the

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
very heavy so it stays to the ground the

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.760 
very heavy so it stays to the ground the
the<00:02:05.159> wheels<00:02:05.399> were<00:02:05.610> all<00:02:05.729> very<00:02:05.880> evenly<00:02:06.390> and<00:02:06.770> will

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
the wheels were all very evenly and will

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.759 
the wheels were all very evenly and will
demonstrate<00:02:08.250> here<00:02:08.429> in<00:02:08.489> just<00:02:08.610> a<00:02:08.670> minute
