00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.169
 but how it happens to attract those true 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.139
 emotions 

00:00:13.169 --> 00:00:18.449
 what is the impulse of life how to work 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.070

 means that the couple is the most 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.390
 important but they know that here in a 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.040
 I had that I have that would be another reason 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.220

 game of love and war everything is worth 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:48.600
 and generally start to sensitize 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.040

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:55.350

 crisis the whole evolution as well as it looks 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:33.000
 all the signs converge in a 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.770
 focal point was like an old class that 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.539
 I had psychology as a boyfriend in that 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.270
 that there was talk about johan's windows 

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:41.459
 and that the center is your reality all the 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.069
 outside all the periphery you say how I am 

00:01:41.459 --> 00:01:46.470
 I am part of active part negative part 

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:48.720
 positive and so on but to the center of 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.549
 our life we have lost that point 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.060
 focal when we are realistic 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:56.159
 tenacious prosperous integrity behind the 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.110
 social worker that is delivered 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.450
 with the one who admires praising that 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.099
 thanks that nice that does not try to 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.689
 walk around to see what catches and 

00:02:02.099 --> 00:02:05.729
 then they leave the couple because 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:07.110
 remember that person who abandons 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.269
 someone with children who has out there 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.009
 gifts like illegitimate bastards have 

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:13.620
 you but will return as orphans 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:16.950
 in another life and orphanhood is earned 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:19.890
 think those words the skirts you win 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:22.260
 price the same distance but without 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:25.170
 But here I would tell you that at work 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:27.420
 of life when truly the human 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.860
 is whole and when you say this beautiful 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.230
 prayer in the name of the hand of 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.879
 presence I'm looking for the soul mate 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.580
 the couple that is related to my physical 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:37.739
 emotionally mentally and spiritually no longer 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.599
 you are going to leave because of the physical aspect 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:42.989
 but you will see all the values 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:46.890
 spiritual annexes and believe me that that 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:49.650
 is the true peace and spirituality that 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:52.799
 is the way or the message that I am going to 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:55.380
 try to say when all lives are 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:57.989
 have truly accumulated being 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:00.390
 spiritual has reached the majesty 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:03.890
 and excellence and a job 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.890
 truly and we go up
