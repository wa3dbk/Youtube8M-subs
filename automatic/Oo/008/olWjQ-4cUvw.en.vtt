forward<00:01:48.329> to<00:01:48.479> using<00:01:48.689> just<00:01:49.079> because<00:01:49.350> of<00:01:49.439> his<00:01:49.530> if

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
forward to using just because of his if

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.260 
forward to using just because of his if
we<00:01:49.770> look<00:01:49.890> at<00:01:49.950> his<00:01:50.070> stats<00:01:50.310> now<00:01:50.549> he's<00:01:50.970> pretty

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
we look at his stats now he's pretty

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.910 
we look at his stats now he's pretty
decent<00:01:51.689> and<00:01:51.899> if<00:01:52.020> you<00:01:52.110> moved<00:01:52.320> him<00:01:52.439> up<00:01:52.500> into<00:01:52.680> mid

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
decent and if you moved him up into mid

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.280 
decent and if you moved him up into mid
filtration<00:01:53.369> he'd<00:01:53.759> be<00:01:53.880> even<00:01:54.270> there<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:55.140> next

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
filtration he'd be even there the next

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.580 
filtration he'd be even there the next
one<00:01:55.560> is<00:01:55.740> obviously<00:01:56.310> a<00:01:56.399> bama<00:01:56.700> rank<00:01:56.939> now<00:01:57.119> I

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
one is obviously a bama rank now I

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.289 
one is obviously a bama rank now I
reckon<00:01:58.590> that<00:01:59.009> he's<00:01:59.219> going<00:01:59.460> to<00:01:59.520> be<00:01:59.640> playing<00:01:59.880> at

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
reckon that he's going to be playing at

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.569 
reckon that he's going to be playing at
the<00:02:00.840> right<00:02:01.200> midfield<00:02:01.680> position<00:02:01.799> when<00:02:02.310> he<00:02:02.399> does

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
the right midfield position when he does

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.120 
the right midfield position when he does
come<00:02:02.850> out<00:02:02.969> of<00:02:03.149> packs<00:02:03.420> but<00:02:04.170> that<00:02:04.890> could<00:02:05.100> change

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
come out of packs but that could change

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.760 
come out of packs but that could change
depending<00:02:05.460> got<00:02:06.119> a<00:02:06.149> mobile<00:02:06.329> as<00:02:07.079> a<00:02:07.140> striker<00:02:07.560> as

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
depending got a mobile as a striker as

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.100 
depending got a mobile as a striker as
well<00:02:07.920> so<00:02:08.099> a<00:02:08.129> bama<00:02:08.369> Yang<00:02:08.550> and<00:02:08.700> a<00:02:09.509> lever<00:02:09.750> am<00:02:09.899> I<00:02:10.050> to

a<00:02:13.620> lot<00:02:14.069> of<00:02:14.099> people<00:02:14.220> reckon<00:02:14.670> he<00:02:14.730> should<00:02:14.880> have

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
a lot of people reckon he should have

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.729 
a lot of people reckon he should have
been<00:02:15.000> upgraded<00:02:15.450> to<00:02:15.480> over<00:02:15.959> in<00:02:16.050> a<00:02:16.140> teammate<00:02:16.470> this

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
year if that does happen he might be a

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.770 
year if that does happen he might be a
cheap<00:02:18.959> beast<00:02:19.349> looking<00:02:19.830> at<00:02:19.950> his<00:02:20.420> looking<00:02:21.420> at<00:02:21.540> if

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
cheap beast looking at his looking at if

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.059 
cheap beast looking at his looking at if
you<00:02:21.840> look<00:02:21.870> at<00:02:22.050> his<00:02:22.170> team<00:02:22.319> in<00:02:22.410> the<00:02:22.440> season<00:02:22.830> stats

you look at his team in the season stats
the<00:02:23.250> cali<00:02:23.459> to<00:02:23.640> get<00:02:23.880> i<00:02:24.030> reckon<00:02:24.599> it<00:02:24.720> could<00:02:24.810> be

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
the cali to get i reckon it could be

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:26.420 
the cali to get i reckon it could be
quite<00:02:25.200> close<00:02:25.470> to<00:02:25.590> that<00:02:25.709> his<00:02:25.830> normal<00:02:26.160> card

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
quite close to that his normal card

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.729 
quite close to that his normal card
anywhere<00:02:26.910> the<00:02:27.540> next<00:02:27.780> one<00:02:27.900> is<00:02:27.930> obviously<00:02:28.349> gonna

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
anywhere the next one is obviously gonna

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:30.199 
anywhere the next one is obviously gonna
feature<00:02:29.069> well<00:02:29.550> it<00:02:29.610> sort<00:02:29.730> of<00:02:29.760> feature<00:02:29.910> a<00:02:30.030> lot<00:02:30.150> of

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
feature well it sort of feature a lot of

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:33.110 
feature well it sort of feature a lot of
Dortmund<00:02:30.660> and<00:02:31.099> and<00:02:32.099> Bayern<00:02:32.580> players<00:02:32.880> as<00:02:33.030> we

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
Dortmund and and Bayern players as we

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.940 
Dortmund and and Bayern players as we
have<00:02:33.209> moved<00:02:33.420> away<00:02:33.540> from<00:02:33.690> them<00:02:34.050> yet<00:02:34.230> anyway<00:02:34.620> and

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
have moved away from them yet anyway and

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.979 
have moved away from them yet anyway and
it<00:02:35.160> is<00:02:35.250> a<00:02:35.280> world<00:02:35.519> cup<00:02:35.760> winner<00:02:35.989> schweinsteiger

it is a world cup winner schweinsteiger

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:39.020 
it is a world cup winner schweinsteiger
I<00:02:37.170> reckon<00:02:37.800> this<00:02:37.980> carries<00:02:38.340> will<00:02:38.489> be<00:02:38.550> absolutely

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
I reckon this carries will be absolutely

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.870 
I reckon this carries will be absolutely
brilliant<00:02:39.450> maybe<00:02:39.630> a<00:02:39.720> boost<00:02:40.019> on<00:02:40.200> pace<00:02:40.849> but<00:02:41.849> I

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
brilliant maybe a boost on pace but I

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.250 
brilliant maybe a boost on pace but I
don't<00:02:41.940> know<00:02:42.120> how<00:02:42.239> he<00:02:42.269> a<00:02:42.510> bit<00:02:42.750> do<00:02:42.930> get<00:02:43.170> the

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
don't know how he a bit do get the

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:44.630 
don't know how he a bit do get the
players<00:02:43.530> but<00:02:43.680> i<00:02:43.709> reckon<00:02:43.980> schweinsteiger<00:02:44.580> is

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
players but i reckon schweinsteiger is

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.340 
players but i reckon schweinsteiger is
going<00:02:44.790> to<00:02:44.880> be<00:02:44.970> and<00:02:45.209> one<00:02:45.870> of<00:02:45.900> the<00:02:46.019> ones<00:02:46.170> which

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350

right<00:03:44.579> wing<00:03:44.970> position<00:03:45.299> maybe<00:03:45.720> not<00:03:46.290> in<00:03:46.440> the<00:03:46.680> in

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459

playing for Bayern Munich could be

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:05.270

very<00:04:05.790> it<00:04:06.150> was<00:04:06.269> very<00:04:06.359> similar<00:04:06.720> to<00:04:06.840> the<00:04:06.930> cab<00:04:07.170> this

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.380 
very it was very similar to the cab this

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.770 
very it was very similar to the cab this
year<00:04:07.590> he's<00:04:08.430> strong<00:04:08.730> he's<00:04:08.940> fast<00:04:09.209> and<00:04:09.420> he's<00:04:09.600> got

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
year he's strong he's fast and he's got

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.599 
year he's strong he's fast and he's got
decent<00:04:10.109> dribbling<00:04:10.590> ability<00:04:10.709> as<00:04:11.100> well<00:04:11.130> and<00:04:11.549> a

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:11.609 
decent dribbling ability as well and a

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:14.059 
decent dribbling ability as well and a
decent<00:04:12.030> shot<00:04:12.359> at<00:04:12.540> that<00:04:12.660> so<00:04:13.319> I<00:04:13.350> reckon<00:04:13.680> he<00:04:13.859> could

00:04:14.059 --> 00:04:14.069 
decent shot at that so I reckon he could

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:15.680 
decent shot at that so I reckon he could
be<00:04:14.190> the<00:04:14.310> number<00:04:14.549> one<00:04:14.579> striker<00:04:15.090> which<00:04:15.299> everyone

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
be the number one striker which everyone

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:18.529 
be the number one striker which everyone
does<00:04:15.930> look<00:04:16.169> to<00:04:16.380> in<00:04:16.590> fifa15<00:04:17.519> ultimate<00:04:18.209> team<00:04:18.389> and

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:18.539 
does look to in fifa15 ultimate team and

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:19.640 
does look to in fifa15 ultimate team and
that's<00:04:18.660> why<00:04:18.780> I<00:04:18.810> put<00:04:19.049> him<00:04:19.169> in<00:04:19.229> there<00:04:19.380> but

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
that's why I put him in there but

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:21.289 
that's why I put him in there but
there's<00:04:20.280> one<00:04:20.400> more<00:04:20.549> player<00:04:20.789> and<00:04:21.030> that's<00:04:21.180> a

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:21.299 
there's one more player and that's a

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:23.390 
there's one more player and that's a
