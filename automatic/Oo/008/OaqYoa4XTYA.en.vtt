want<00:01:01.050> to<00:01:01.170> stress<00:01:01.379> how<00:01:01.739> important<00:01:02.399> veggies<00:01:02.789> are

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969

a<00:01:03.780> lot<00:01:04.080> of<00:01:04.199> people<00:01:04.500> think<00:01:04.830> because<00:01:05.070> they're<00:01:05.430> so

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
a lot of people think because they're so

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.460 
a lot of people think because they're so
expensive<00:01:06.150> they'll<00:01:06.600> just<00:01:06.810> skip<00:01:07.050> them<00:01:07.260> and

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
expensive they'll just skip them and

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.650 
expensive they'll just skip them and
just<00:01:08.130> feed<00:01:08.340> hay<00:01:08.760> in<00:01:08.910> pellets<00:01:09.300> and<00:01:09.420> they'll<00:01:09.540> be

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:09.660 
just feed hay in pellets and they'll be

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:13.310 
just feed hay in pellets and they'll be
fine<00:01:09.900> but<00:01:10.890> actually<00:01:11.600> rabbits<00:01:12.600> really<00:01:12.960> do<00:01:13.110> need

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
fine but actually rabbits really do need

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.280 
fine but actually rabbits really do need
veggies<00:01:13.740> so<00:01:14.130> if<00:01:14.730> you<00:01:14.940> can't<00:01:15.210> afford<00:01:15.330> them<00:01:15.780> then

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
veggies so if you can't afford them then

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.550 
veggies so if you can't afford them then
maybe<00:01:17.070> you<00:01:17.310> shouldn't<00:01:17.610> get<00:01:17.730> a<00:01:17.790> rabbit<00:01:18.210> but

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
maybe you shouldn't get a rabbit but

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.840 
maybe you shouldn't get a rabbit but
veggies<00:01:19.560> are<00:01:19.710> really<00:01:19.890> important<00:01:20.370> so<00:01:20.610> don't

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
veggies are really important so don't

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.930 
veggies are really important so don't
just<00:01:21.210> skip<00:01:22.200> them<00:01:22.380> so<00:01:23.160> veggies<00:01:23.550> are<00:01:23.700> going<00:01:23.850> to

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:23.940 
just skip them so veggies are going to

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.990 
just skip them so veggies are going to
