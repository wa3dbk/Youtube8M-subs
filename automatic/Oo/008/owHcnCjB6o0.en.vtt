00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.490
 Look, I think we scored here. 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.170
 for the German Cup if I'm not mistaken and 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.840
 assistance we have one we are already 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.400
 in sixth place I do not know if munique 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.869
 has ability to pass 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.110
 although we managed to win the 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.759
 dowry changes then everything is possible galley 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.220
 But it 's only then, let's use that 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.000
 again on the date and we are going to 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.310

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.290
 pass 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.510
 we also acknowledge that it was the 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.340
 hamburg passed that's it too 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:55.980
 I was very impressed by the other's attention . 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:59.100
 The side we have there is Bayern Munich 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:00.960
 against schalke 04 i just saw at a glance how 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.330
 I already told you, announced right. 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.370
 but anyway look at this stadium 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.660
 In Carlos, for me, the best stadium of the 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:08.610
 world I do not know 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:11.960
 in several other good mascara 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:14.820
 areas the line is too gorgeous Giant 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:16.770
 cozy colorful ne 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:19.230
 let's go then to the next match o 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:21.210
 munich come playing believe traditional 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.760
 which I do not like in a bit 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:25.920
 Same little guys there last comes 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.930
 the muqui boy the different color can 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.660
 win and for what the world when it has 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.760
 that enemy thing is reddish 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.600
 I do not know it seems that you have some disease in the 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.330
 skin 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:38.550
 oh my god, come on, let it go 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.410
 in the galley will answer why the 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:42.420
 judge no longer places the ball in the center 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.940
 the grass will roll through the canopy germany 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:47.670
 remembering that there is only one match 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:50.220
 my cost is only the game passed 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:52.920
 lost is out the ball is rolling 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:55.560
 for another match and let's Munich 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.120
 we will try to move to the semifinals the 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:01.530
 coach has already put the offensive team already 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:03.300
 in the beginning is good people look there already 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.160
 He lagged behind the dead boy 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:09.350
 the image passing the people attentive there 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:09.350
 leap up I went to the kick 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:21.890
 bullying is all ricci 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:24.620
 look what made the kid u that touches 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:26.810
 folks attending after the shirt 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.520
 number 20 arrived beating the goal 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:31.610
 agreed to go there 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:34.220
 dumb dumb dumb gal 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:36.590
 too bad there the goalkeeper saves 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.250
 and is in there 1 to 0 for 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.430
 Munich 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:42.370
 shaw five minutes starting the first 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:45.560
 goal and in the competition and our 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:47.600
 second tour now we did 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.470
 Sergio playing too many goalkeepers playing 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.480
 too much 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:51.590
 the coach put defensive 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.120
 We have to continue in the attack. 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:56.120
 now the opposing team has shaken us 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:59.300
 to continue attacking and comes 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:02.180
 Look at the space they gave out. 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:05.180
 I swore that ball was in there. 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:07.970
 the goal of this guys a beautiful shot 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:09.980
 too much that was too close 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:11.780
 Look there defensive if you wait for the 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:14.300
 team play and stay in our 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:16.340
 field defending him is not how you 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:18.620
 play soccer with the best defense is the 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:20.239
 attack but they say that you attack 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:23.000
 attack attack and leave the opposing team 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:25.130
 and for our field consequently 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.280
 there is no danger in our 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:27.280
 defense 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:33.780
 beautiful ball ball is not over the first 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:36.570
 time in our attack I was going to 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:38.160
 backs of defense in any way 1 to 0 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:40.530
 We will win with assistance from the 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:44.550
 boy ue number 20 shirt goal that I 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:45.930
 I do not know the name in the middle come alone and 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:48.240
 tried to find a space on the team . 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:49.920
 Munich look there unsecured kid comes 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:52.110
 trying to dribble that cart 

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:53.820
 son of the morning there is always a certain 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:55.710
 time this type of boat 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:57.360
 She's coming by but I do not have 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:00.320

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.320
 histamine for nothing 

00:05:00.849 --> 00:05:05.619
 I know the guy tried to make him old there. 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:07.749
 I ask you, the player tried 

00:05:05.619 --> 00:05:10.749
 doing that bid the coach did not 

00:05:07.749 --> 00:05:14.259
 take off please, please , please go 

00:05:10.749 --> 00:05:16.629

00:05:14.259 --> 00:05:18.639
 getting on the mac 

00:05:16.629 --> 00:05:22.119
 Unfortunately we were already settled 

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:23.289
 This is not legal, the galley of 

00:05:22.119 --> 00:05:24.849
 any way we can play well 

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:26.589
 giving a zoom assistance and not 

00:05:24.849 --> 00:05:28.959
 we managed to score but we did not have 

00:05:26.589 --> 00:05:30.939
 The important thing is the munich 

00:05:28.959 --> 00:05:33.339
 in itself and moving on to the semifinals 

00:05:30.939 --> 00:05:36.159
 and it is this that has been signed by the last 

00:05:33.339 --> 00:05:39.669
 time in order to chat munich spent more 

00:05:36.159 --> 00:05:42.849
 once of another German giant of this 

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:44.949
 time the victim was the Freiburg Freiburg 

00:05:42.849 --> 00:05:47.229
 I do not know how to pronounce it comes to us. 

00:05:44.949 --> 00:05:50.169
 from one to zero and move on to the next 

00:05:47.229 --> 00:05:54.699
 stage offensive position 25 chances created 

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:56.259
 and such selection 0% starting note 7.3 

00:05:54.699 --> 00:05:58.449
 we were well drawn but we did not 

00:05:56.259 --> 00:06:00.159
 we got to finish finishing on attacking 

00:05:58.449 --> 00:06:02.800
 very well no but she two finalizations 

00:06:00.159 --> 00:06:04.959
 against two against a certain game is not 0 

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:07.479
 It was very cool and the branch won as 

00:06:04.959 --> 00:06:10.059
 best match player with 8,1 

00:06:07.479 --> 00:06:11.740
 over did the bastard goal and the bayern 

00:06:10.059 --> 00:06:13.569

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:15.879
 schalke and will we have a 

00:06:13.569 --> 00:06:17.079
 duel of munich or will have a draw in 

00:06:15.879 --> 00:06:18.909
 semifinals I do not know 

00:06:17.079 --> 00:06:21.610
 in any way any team that the 

00:06:18.909 --> 00:06:23.439
 people grab it now it's going to be quarry not 

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:24.099
 be the hannover who is not very cool 

00:06:23.439 --> 00:06:25.629
