00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:34.089 
it kind of just disappears it is a very

00:00:34.089 --> 00:00:36.600 
it kind of just disappears it is a very
bizarre<00:00:34.390> feeling<00:00:35.019> flow<00:00:35.440> tented<00:00:35.920> not<00:00:36.280> it

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:36.610 
bizarre feeling flow tented not it

doesn't<00:00:36.910> stay<00:00:37.120> liquid<00:00:37.600> once<00:00:37.839> you<00:00:37.989> rub<00:00:38.230> it<00:00:38.379> on

00:00:38.549 --> 00:00:38.559 
doesn't stay liquid once you rub it on

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:40.259 
doesn't stay liquid once you rub it on
two<00:00:38.800> flies<00:00:39.070> it<00:00:39.339> just<00:00:39.519> kind<00:00:39.699> of<00:00:39.760> eventually

00:00:40.259 --> 00:00:40.269 
two flies it just kind of eventually

00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:42.180 
two flies it just kind of eventually
once<00:00:40.480> you<00:00:40.570> rub<00:00:40.780> it<00:00:40.900> in<00:00:41.019> and<00:00:41.170> work<00:00:41.320> it<00:00:41.470> in<00:00:41.620> it

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:42.190 
once you rub it in and work it in it

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:43.829 
once you rub it in and work it in it
just<00:00:42.430> kind<00:00:42.610> of<00:00:42.670> disappears<00:00:43.269> and<00:00:43.480> coats<00:00:43.690> your

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:43.839 
just kind of disappears and coats your

00:00:43.839 --> 00:00:46.320 
just kind of disappears and coats your
fly<00:00:44.110> so<00:00:44.860> for<00:00:45.070> this<00:00:45.159> reason<00:00:45.400> it's<00:00:45.850> a<00:00:46.059> great

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:46.330 
fly so for this reason it's a great

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:49.410 
fly so for this reason it's a great
flotant<00:00:46.839> for<00:00:47.049> CDC<00:00:47.589> so<00:00:48.400> typically<00:00:49.000> if<00:00:49.119> you<00:00:49.299> were

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:49.420 
flotant for CDC so typically if you were

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.689 
flotant for CDC so typically if you were
to<00:00:49.570> take<00:00:49.780> this<00:00:49.930> little<00:00:50.140> CDC<00:00:50.710> compare<00:00:51.159> done<00:00:51.369> and

00:00:51.689 --> 00:00:51.699 
to take this little CDC compare done and

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:54.000 
to take this little CDC compare done and
applied<00:00:52.089> ink<00:00:52.390> or<00:00:52.720> a<00:00:52.750> quell<00:00:53.049> to<00:00:53.290> it<00:00:53.409> it<00:00:53.830> would

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.010 
applied ink or a quell to it it would

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:55.950 
applied ink or a quell to it it would
just<00:00:54.040> matte<00:00:54.369> up<00:00:54.580> the<00:00:54.699> fibers<00:00:55.180> and<00:00:55.420> completely

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:55.960 
just matte up the fibers and completely

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.369 
just matte up the fibers and completely
ruin<00:00:56.440> the<00:00:56.530> fly<00:00:56.820> but<00:00:57.820> with<00:00:57.970> dry<00:00:58.180> magic<00:00:58.659> I'll

00:00:59.369 --> 00:00:59.379 
ruin the fly but with dry magic I'll

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:00.660 
ruin the fly but with dry magic I'll
show<00:00:59.589> you<00:00:59.650> here<00:00:59.890> it<00:01:00.010> will<00:01:00.100> matte<00:01:00.280> up<00:01:00.460> the

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:00.670 
show you here it will matte up the

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:05.070 
show you here it will matte up the
fibers<00:01:01.059> here<00:01:01.210> for<00:01:01.479> a<00:01:01.510> brief<00:01:01.750> second<00:01:02.250> as<00:01:03.839> I<00:01:04.839> work
