his<00:01:26.189> career<00:01:26.490> but<00:01:26.790> I<00:01:26.850> think<00:01:27.119> he<00:01:27.180> can<00:01:27.299> take<00:01:27.450> a

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479

fight goes the distance when I'm going
with<00:01:31.110> Dennis<00:01:31.500> I<00:01:31.710> think<00:01:31.950> he<00:01:32.070> will<00:01:32.220> win<00:01:32.400> by<00:01:32.610> TKO

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
with Dennis I think he will win by TKO

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.870 
with Dennis I think he will win by TKO
or<00:01:33.500> decision<00:01:34.500> and<00:01:34.710> I'm<00:01:35.280> looking<00:01:35.520> forward<00:01:35.729> to

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
or decision and I'm looking forward to

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.310 
or decision and I'm looking forward to
this<00:01:35.970> fight<00:01:36.210> and<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.540> main<00:01:36.810> reason<00:01:37.140> why<00:01:37.259> is

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
this fight and the main reason why is

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.679 
this fight and the main reason why is
because<00:01:37.470> Dennis<00:01:38.189> bite<00:01:38.460> sub<00:01:38.790> might<00:01:39.479> be<00:01:39.659> a

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
because Dennis bite sub might be a

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.499 
because Dennis bite sub might be a
future<00:01:40.049> opponent<00:01:40.710> of<00:01:41.420> wladimir<00:01:42.420> klitschko
