00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 the balance is already something very positive that 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.799
 we must highlight the 13 medals so 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:10.320
 least the Chileans could win and 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:13.349
 get here in the contest held in 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.299
 our country and today three of the 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.400
 competitors that added four months 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.210
 They are with us 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:24.060
 isidora as you like me in greeting you 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:26.370
 Sun how he 's doing and ended with 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.680
 ladybugs like until catalinas 

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:30.780
 in the previous to the contest of this the 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:34.140
 preparations is the organization the 

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:36.930
 training you thought about four 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.610
 medals or a little more or all three in 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.730
 total that the Chileans got 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.980
 we had thought 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:48.329
 the goal was the medal for us 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:51.600
 in having a good time being all together but 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:54.900
 the medal was like the goal in alone 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.239
 we did quite well as a team expected 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:59.820
 a little more but we did not do the best 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.879
 possible equal venezuela is very good and 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.970
 the duet we did the best we came out very 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.740
 well and it was very emotional when they finished 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.680
 and then when they gave us the scores 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.080
 they are also people in the rival to 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.440
 beat to win the medal there was no 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.970
 numbers in the soul about us is 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.640
 what we rehearsed of the championships 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.520
 previous 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.380
 I believe that in this case we beat 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.090
 Colombia but I'm also very close to 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.369
 venezuela that was from the day to the closest 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.920
 and if the expectations were met 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:32.810
 before the contest the goal was the 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.729
 medal and they wanted to make a good 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.369
 acting as they are often heard 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:40.880
 sports for us the goal 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:44.360
 usually the medal and we turned and 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:46.310
 much internal something for something missed by 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.680
 make some mistakes that you have to 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:51.280
 correct to the best based on then to 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:55.280
 the exponents that had in competition 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:56.390
 The routine has not gone well 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.890
 what we lack is also more 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:03.710
 precision and more leg extension 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.360
 just share what your partner says and 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.369
 I think we need to improve some 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.950
 Aspects to get as main 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:11.959
 What is Brazil we need to improve? 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.670
 what technique more skills than 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:16.519
 compared to other countries like 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.590
 less competed but I think the 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:23.150
 goal that is the medal we achieve and 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:25.130
 they also passed incredible they celebrated 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.030
 also with a lot of emotion because a 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.980
 medal 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.959
 he wins and it's not easy, there are not many 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.610
 sacrifices like that were seen and 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:36.200
 listened to statements also to the 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:39.319
 respect yes that 's because I train eight 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:42.470
 daily hours, it's just sick to be all 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:44.810
 the days with the same routine training 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.340
 and we have in very cold water not 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.790
 it's a matter of getting to the pools as 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:53.600
 warm not to arrive in the cold 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:56.090
 sacrifice those as what motivates you 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:58.730
 to follow to be able to achieve the medal 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.680
 points are crazy has work 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:04.190
 katelyn talks about the very cold water that 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:06.170
 as demanding as he receives on the day he 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:09.230
 we are training approximately between 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:11.390
 7 and 8 hours a day three and a half in the 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.860
 morning and three thirty in the afternoon and 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:14.810
 depending on whether the 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:17.360
 training to the faults of us or 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:20.130
 no and then we start to leave the load 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:23.130
 average that the championship is approaching 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:25.050
 I think it was this experience but 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:26.580
 at the end of the competition I think that 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:29.310
 it is the day as more or less but 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:32.790
 trained by the achievements that they make to us 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:34.830
 the 14 years and hours of easy dedication 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:37.680
 only to competition to sport 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:40.350
 Friends are also friends or not 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:43.280
 is only focused net no it is not 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:45.860
 easy to engage in sports 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:48.740
 how do you want sporting yourself at the end 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:51.470
 he finishes doing it for pleasure not because 

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:54.920
 It is as required and then 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:56.240
 you do not feel obligated I know I have 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.830
 understood how good you travel in 

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:59.510
 the next few days for a very long period 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:02.510
 long abroad that idea was 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:05.650
 perfect you want to stay 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:08.590
 outside to prepare them the disciples 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:10.750
 in chile the vice letter travel I 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:12.430
 I think to improve the technique and 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:15.030
 also learn from the other countries and 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:17.049
 when traveling 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:18.970
 catalina with that of this experience 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:21.070
 these trips some goal from here to 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:23.830
 end of the year 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:26.229
 good here as in August of September 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:30.910
 we have the Pan American that also 

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:32.889
 idea is to get better and I think that 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:35.800
 with what we are going to train like 

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:37.900
 we are going to achieve and here in chile they are going to 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.460
 keep training the team so 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:43.000
 they will continue to perfect and 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:44.590
 let's be more better I think there's 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.600
 athletes who think what they want 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:48.760
 leave chile to have better 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:50.770
 get better performance or better use 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:52.570
 to the sporting work that you think 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:55.449
 the same has been raised as a 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:58.060
 short- term goal to leave our country what 

00:04:55.449 --> 00:05:00.430
 I ask only I think that it is the same 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:02.830
 important to know the techniques of 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:05.650
 other countries since I always believe that 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:07.270
 it is better to have as another idea what 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:09.009
 is fitting the other countries and the 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:11.560
 new techniques that they have since 

00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:14.350
 sometimes they are superior to us 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:17.620
 I think it's super good to travel and know 

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:19.960
 things I would also be that game at 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:22.660
 foreign for now I do not think so 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:26.169
 Only here in Chile, I do not go with 

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:29.500
 qatar of foreigner also already but I left 

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:30.970
 preparing be outside north not 

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:32.680
 do other athletes leave our 

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:35.550
 country to perfect itself in the 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:38.889
 foreigner living outside would you like a 

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:41.680
 for now I do not know if he lived outside me 

00:05:38.889 --> 00:05:44.860
 I think that as I know more about 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:47.080
 what makes a dent, but it is also 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:49.040
 important to be in chile and all the 

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:52.190
 support for 

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:53.420
 for the country catalina solÃ­s and now they 

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:55.070
 I want to thank these minutes I imagine 

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:56.900
 that are still celebrating and 

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:58.730
 recovering energy by wear gone 

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:00.410
 last week thank you very much for 

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:02.240
 accompany us and luck in everything has 

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:04.340
 ahead and we will continue talking 

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:05.750
 and analyzing each of the movements 

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:08.120
 with the new brands that are 

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:10.150
 getting girls to go very 

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:10.150
 all right
