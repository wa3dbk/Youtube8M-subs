00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:13.750 
so what you're looking at here

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:20.430 
so what you're looking at here
is<00:00:13.980> my<00:00:14.980> largest<00:00:15.520> cell<00:00:17.100> this<00:00:18.100> is<00:00:18.160> the<00:00:18.400> TT<00:00:19.140> 310

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:20.440 
is my largest cell this is the TT 310

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:50.230 
be configured for 120 volt AC because

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:51.780 
be configured for 120 volt AC because
there<00:00:50.380> is<00:00:50.440> an<00:00:50.530> additional<00:00:51.010> one<00:00:51.250> of<00:00:51.489> the<00:00:51.579> tabs

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:51.790 
there is an additional one of the tabs

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:58.290 
there is an additional one of the tabs
and<00:00:52.059> one<00:00:52.960> of<00:00:53.079> the<00:00:53.140> plates<00:00:53.410> is<00:00:54.870> tab<00:00:55.870> for<00:00:56.320> a<00:00:57.300> for

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:58.300 
and one of the plates is tab for a for

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.580 
and one of the plates is tab for a for
the<00:00:58.480> 120<00:00:59.140> so<00:00:59.860> just<00:01:00.219> by<00:01:00.520> rewiring<00:01:01.000> it<00:01:01.300> alone<00:01:01.590> you

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:02.590 
the 120 so just by rewiring it alone you

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:05.990 
the 120 so just by rewiring it alone you
can<00:01:02.800> convert<00:01:03.070> it<00:01:03.129> from<00:01:03.280> DC<00:01:03.730> to<00:01:03.820> AC<00:01:04.979> anyways

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
can convert it from DC to AC anyways

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.469 
can convert it from DC to AC anyways

if<00:02:33.860> you're<00:02:33.950> going<00:02:34.070> to<00:02:34.160> run<00:02:34.310> this<00:02:34.430> on<00:02:34.640> if<00:02:34.940> you're

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300 
if you're going to run this on if you're

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:42.520 
if you're going to run this on if you're
going<00:02:35.390> to<00:02:35.480> configure<00:02:35.780> this<00:02:35.990> to<00:02:36.050> AC<00:02:37.360> then<00:02:41.530> it's

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
going to configure this to AC then it's

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.220 
going to configure this to AC then it's
configured<00:02:43.250> to<00:02:43.280> run<00:02:43.850> independently<00:02:44.600> each<00:02:44.870> row

configured to run independently each row

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.710 
configured to run independently each row
so<00:02:46.130> you<00:02:46.220> can<00:02:46.400> go<00:02:46.550> five<00:02:47.000> circuits<00:02:47.660> of<00:02:47.900> 120<00:02:48.530> AC

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
so you can go five circuits of 120 AC

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.820 
so you can go five circuits of 120 AC
put<00:02:50.720> it<00:02:50.810> on<00:02:50.900> its<00:02:51.050> own<00:02:51.170> breaker<00:02:51.530> and<00:02:53.560> you<00:02:54.560> plug

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
put it on its own breaker and you plug

00:02:54.830 --> 00:03:01.230 
put it on its own breaker and you plug
it<00:02:54.950> right<00:02:55.070> in<00:02:55.280> and<00:02:55.550> just<00:02:56.350> huge<00:02:57.350> production

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:01.240
