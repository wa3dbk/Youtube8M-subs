to<00:01:38.799> 43<00:01:39.219> and<00:01:39.310> you<00:01:39.429> turn<00:01:39.639> it<00:01:39.759> in<00:01:39.880> and<00:01:40.149> you<00:01:40.450> drive

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:40.689 
to 43 and you turn it in and you drive

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:42.510 
to 43 and you turn it in and you drive
the<00:01:40.840> thing<00:01:41.049> off<00:01:41.200> you're<00:01:41.590> fine<00:01:42.069> you're<00:01:42.459> fine

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.520 
the thing off you're fine you're fine

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.819 
the thing off you're fine you're fine
you<00:01:43.209> don't<00:01:43.389> need<00:01:43.509> to<00:01:43.600> use<00:01:43.689> the<00:01:43.840> brakes<00:01:44.079> but<00:01:44.590> you

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:44.829 
you don't need to use the brakes but you

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:47.510 
you don't need to use the brakes but you
get<00:01:45.009> on<00:01:45.130> to<00:01:45.369> uh

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.489 

come<00:01:48.520> on<00:01:48.700> that'd<00:01:48.969> be<00:01:49.090> an<00:01:49.179> r1<00:01:49.509> right<00:01:49.899> now<00:01:50.380> we're

00:01:50.489 --> 00:01:50.499 
come on that'd be an r1 right now we're

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:51.359 
come on that'd be an r1 right now we're
coming<00:01:50.710> down<00:01:50.770> that<00:01:50.920> road<00:01:51.100> a<00:01:51.130> little<00:01:51.249> bit

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:51.369 
coming down that road a little bit

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:53.249 
coming down that road a little bit
quicker<00:01:51.640> it's<00:01:52.119> still<00:01:52.359> a<00:01:52.390> 57<00:01:52.990> mile<00:01:53.140> an<00:01:53.229> hour

00:01:53.249 --> 00:01:53.259 
quicker it's still a 57 mile an hour

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:54.450 
quicker it's still a 57 mile an hour
corner<00:01:53.679> and<00:01:53.920> that's<00:01:54.069> what<00:01:54.189> we<00:01:54.280> need<00:01:54.399> to

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
corner and that's what we need to

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:55.950 
corner and that's what we need to
realize<00:01:54.759> is<00:01:54.909> we<00:01:54.999> adjust<00:01:55.329> for<00:01:55.450> these<00:01:55.600> corners

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:55.960 
realize is we adjust for these corners

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.080 
realize is we adjust for these corners
so<00:01:56.319> we<00:01:56.859> learnt<00:01:57.130> we<00:01:57.340> learned<00:01:57.520> it<00:01:57.640> this<00:01:57.729> morning

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090 
so we learnt we learned it this morning

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:59.459 
so we learnt we learned it this morning
more<00:01:58.240> speed<00:01:58.539> as<00:01:58.630> more<00:01:58.810> breaks<00:01:59.079> so<00:01:59.229> now<00:01:59.319> you're

00:01:59.459 --> 00:01:59.469 
more speed as more breaks so now you're

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:01.289 
more speed as more breaks so now you're
coming<00:01:59.619> down<00:01:59.829> this<00:01:59.979> row<00:02:00.340> instead<00:02:00.609> of<00:02:00.700> a<00:02:00.850> 50

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:01.299 
coming down this row instead of a 50

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:02.550 
coming down this row instead of a 50
mile<00:02:01.450> an<00:02:01.479> hour<00:02:01.659> now<00:02:02.049> you're<00:02:02.200> coming<00:02:02.319> down<00:02:02.499> the

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
mile an hour now you're coming down the

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.380 
mile an hour now you're coming down the
road<00:02:02.709> at<00:02:02.890> 110<00:02:03.670> miles<00:02:03.909> an<00:02:04.090> hour

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
road at 110 miles an hour

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.569 
road at 110 miles an hour
a<00:02:04.569> lot<00:02:05.409> of<00:02:05.439> people<00:02:05.740> in<00:02:05.799> this<00:02:05.890> country<00:02:06.250> feel<00:02:06.280> the

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:06.579 
a lot of people in this country feel the

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:08.820 
a lot of people in this country feel the
speed<00:02:06.849> is<00:02:07.000> dangerous<00:02:07.509> speeds<00:02:08.319> not<00:02:08.560> dangerous

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
speed is dangerous speeds not dangerous

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:10.919 
speed is dangerous speeds not dangerous
if<00:02:09.280> speed<00:02:09.580> was<00:02:09.610> dangerous<00:02:10.179> everybody<00:02:10.840> at

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929 
if speed was dangerous everybody at

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:12.720 
if speed was dangerous everybody at
Bonneville<00:02:11.319> would<00:02:11.440> die<00:02:11.590> right<00:02:12.370> you<00:02:12.549> die

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
Bonneville would die right you die

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.300 
Bonneville would die right you die
everybody<00:02:13.629> running<00:02:13.870> NASCAR<00:02:14.230> would<00:02:14.349> die<00:02:14.560> it's

everybody running NASCAR would die it's

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.100 
everybody running NASCAR would die it's
not<00:02:15.400> speed<00:02:15.819> it's<00:02:16.000> the<00:02:16.030> lack<00:02:16.209> of<00:02:16.239> control<00:02:16.629> so

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
not speed it's the lack of control so

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:18.270 
not speed it's the lack of control so
you're<00:02:17.230> coming<00:02:17.379> down<00:02:17.560> there<00:02:17.709> at<00:02:17.799> 80<00:02:17.920> miles<00:02:18.099> an

hour now we'll go 80 miles an hour on

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.229 
hour now we'll go 80 miles an hour on
the<00:02:20.140> Yamaha<00:02:20.590> you<00:02:20.980> roll<00:02:21.250> off<00:02:21.430> you<00:02:21.760> pick<00:02:21.970> up<00:02:22.090> your

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:22.239 
the Yamaha you roll off you pick up your

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:23.789 
the Yamaha you roll off you pick up your
brake<00:02:22.480> lever<00:02:22.720> because<00:02:23.140> you<00:02:23.319> still<00:02:23.530> got<00:02:23.650> to<00:02:23.739> go

00:02:23.789 --> 00:02:23.799 
brake lever because you still got to go

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:26.250 
brake lever because you still got to go
57<00:02:24.430> miles<00:02:24.610> an<00:02:24.760> hour<00:02:24.849> at<00:02:25.120> 43<00:02:25.720> degrees<00:02:26.019> a<00:02:26.049> lean

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
57 miles an hour at 43 degrees a lean

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.199 
57 miles an hour at 43 degrees a lean
angle<00:02:26.410> so<00:02:27.010> many<00:02:27.220> people<00:02:27.610> think<00:02:27.790> they're<00:02:28.090> going

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
angle so many people think they're going

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:30.630 
angle so many people think they're going
to<00:02:28.269> go<00:02:28.360> faster<00:02:28.780> and<00:02:28.870> lean<00:02:28.959> over<00:02:28.989> further<00:02:29.610> hmm

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
to go faster and lean over further hmm

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.089 
to go faster and lean over further hmm
Whitley<00:02:31.480> would<00:02:31.959> it<00:02:32.079> be<00:02:32.200> nice<00:02:32.379> if<00:02:32.410> lean<00:02:32.890> angle

00:02:33.089 --> 00:02:33.099 
Whitley would it be nice if lean angle

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:35.550 
Whitley would it be nice if lean angle
was<00:02:33.760> infinite<00:02:34.329> right<00:02:34.930> whatever

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
was infinite right whatever

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.949 
was infinite right whatever
toss<00:02:36.310> the<00:02:36.519> thing<00:02:36.700> in<00:02:36.879> whatever<00:02:37.360> whatever<00:02:37.690> lean

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
toss the thing in whatever whatever lean

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:40.890 
toss the thing in whatever whatever lean
angle<00:02:38.110> you<00:02:38.379> want<00:02:38.530> lean<00:02:39.160> angle<00:02:39.340> not<00:02:40.299> infinite

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
angle you want lean angle not infinite

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.140 
angle you want lean angle not infinite
so<00:02:41.410> we're<00:02:41.560> learning<00:02:41.950> we're<00:02:42.609> crashing<00:02:43.030> these

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
so we're learning we're crashing these

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:44.849 
so we're learning we're crashing these
things<00:02:43.390> cuz<00:02:43.629> we're<00:02:43.810> not<00:02:44.230> using<00:02:44.470> the<00:02:44.620> brakes

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:44.859 
things cuz we're not using the brakes

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:46.860 
things cuz we're not using the brakes
well<00:02:45.069> enough<00:02:45.370> are<00:02:46.060> we<00:02:46.209> crashing<00:02:46.599> up<00:02:46.690> in<00:02:46.810> the

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
well enough are we crashing up in the

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:48.449 
well enough are we crashing up in the
canyons<00:02:47.230> cuz<00:02:47.349> we're<00:02:47.500> going<00:02:47.650> too<00:02:47.799> fast<00:02:47.829> or<00:02:48.280> too

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
canyons cuz we're going too fast or too

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:51.960 
canyons cuz we're going too fast or too
slow<00:02:49.799> are<00:02:50.799> we<00:02:50.950> crashed<00:02:51.220> in<00:02:51.400> the<00:02:51.489> canyons<00:02:51.819> we

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
slow are we crashed in the canyons we

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.479 
slow are we crashed in the canyons we
want<00:02:52.120> too<00:02:52.209> fast<00:02:52.480> or<00:02:52.660> too<00:02:52.780> slow<00:02:52.950> too<00:02:53.950> fast<00:02:54.220> we're

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
want too fast or too slow too fast we're

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:55.949 
want too fast or too slow too fast we're
doing<00:02:54.670> this<00:02:54.790> a<00:02:54.849> lot<00:02:55.090> we're<00:02:55.540> not<00:02:55.660> using<00:02:55.840> the

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
doing this a lot we're not using the

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:57.809 
doing this a lot we're not using the
brakes<00:02:56.170> we're<00:02:56.620> realizing<00:02:56.889> as<00:02:57.160> faster<00:02:57.579> we<00:02:57.670> go

00:02:57.809 --> 00:02:57.819 
brakes we're realizing as faster we go

00:02:57.819 --> 00:02:59.220 
brakes we're realizing as faster we go
the<00:02:57.849> more<00:02:58.180> we<00:02:58.420> use<00:02:58.450> our<00:02:58.720> brakes<00:02:58.900> em<00:02:59.079> you<00:02:59.139> guys

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
the more we use our brakes em you guys

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:00.990 
the more we use our brakes em you guys
are<00:02:59.410> thinking<00:02:59.530> about<00:02:59.799> buying<00:02:59.980> a<00:03:00.160> brand-new

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
are thinking about buying a brand-new

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.670 
are thinking about buying a brand-new
thousand<00:03:01.450> cc<00:03:01.780> motorcycle<00:03:02.049> you<00:03:02.410> use<00:03:02.560> your

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
thousand cc motorcycle you use your

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.379 
thousand cc motorcycle you use your
brakes<00:03:02.859> more<00:03:03.400> on<00:03:03.549> that<00:03:03.730> motorcycle<00:03:04.090> you

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:04.389 
brakes more on that motorcycle you

00:03:04.389 --> 00:03:06.089 
brakes more on that motorcycle you
understand<00:03:04.720> that<00:03:04.930> use<00:03:05.500> your<00:03:05.620> brakes<00:03:05.829> more<00:03:06.010> on

00:03:06.089 --> 00:03:06.099 
understand that use your brakes more on

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:07.710 
understand that use your brakes more on
that<00:03:06.190> motorcycle<00:03:06.400> so<00:03:06.790> we'll<00:03:07.239> get<00:03:07.329> into<00:03:07.480> this
