you<00:01:15.750> have<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:16.110> current<00:01:16.500> temperature<00:01:16.950> you

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
you have the current temperature you

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.560 
you have the current temperature you
have<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.369> alarm<00:01:17.670> temperature<00:01:18.180> so<00:01:18.330> when<00:01:18.479> the

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
have the alarm temperature so when the

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.929 
have the alarm temperature so when the

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
you have some cables here and sticky

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.289 
you have some cables here and sticky
pads<00:01:48.810> so<00:01:49.320> you<00:01:49.380> can<00:01:49.590> place<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:49.979> sensors<00:01:50.640> these

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
pads so you can place the sensors these

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.580 
pads so you can place the sensors these
are<00:01:51.509> all<00:01:51.630> the<00:01:51.780> temperature<00:01:52.380> sensors<00:01:52.710> here

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
are all the temperature sensors here

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.819 
are all the temperature sensors here
then<00:01:55.590> this<00:01:56.100> comes<00:01:56.369> off<00:01:57.110> you<00:01:58.110> have<00:01:58.290> some<00:01:58.560> more

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
then this comes off you have some more

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:02.359 
then this comes off you have some more
temperature<00:01:59.549> sensors<00:02:00.000> here<00:02:00.770> you<00:02:01.770> just<00:02:01.950> go<00:02:02.100> you

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
temperature sensors here you just go you

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.850 
temperature sensors here you just go you
just<00:02:02.670> use<00:02:02.820> those<00:02:03.000> sticky<00:02:03.360> pads<00:02:03.570> and<00:02:03.899> then<00:02:04.740> you

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
just use those sticky pads and then you

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.119 
just use those sticky pads and then you
have<00:02:05.040> the<00:02:05.250> display<00:02:05.729> itself<00:02:06.290> and<00:02:07.290> if<00:02:07.740> you<00:02:07.890> can't

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
have the display itself and if you can't
