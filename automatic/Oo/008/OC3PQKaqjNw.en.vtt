00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.570
 man gang beauty good I left today is 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:18.800
 is an official 4.22 android for the galaxy 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:25.350
 tab ps 5100 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:29.900
 so there are many changes starting with 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.900
 the home screen unlock it 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:42.390
 one side of the screen is you can put 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:47.129
 a personalized message or leave only 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:49.289
 time or choose another to leave 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:53.129
 on here 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:55.920
 sure the unlock is unlock the 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:59.670
 standard is samsung had included a 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:02.430
 water or light would look better but not 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.840
 have change in stock room 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:10.590
 so it comes with this unlock 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:14.850
 good interface standard what has changed 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:24.229
 Climate change has changed and it is now 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:30.570
 an animated idea is not google 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:33.150
 search changed now has a dock here 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.140
 below that is fixed with the programs 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.810
 fixed 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.829
 before in the 4.12 guys that upstairs now 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:42.720
 down here 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:47.939
 with regard to smooth fluency and much more 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:49.259
 fluid than 4.12 with certainty because 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.869
 four points sometimes 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.790
 in the beginning she was super well after she 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.320
 I could choke on 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.049
 screen transitions 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.399
 I have not had this problem until now. 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:02.130
 to install 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.700
 she did not have this problem until 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:08.129
 now 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:12.200
 the menu is at a slightly higher margin 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:15.700
 so there were fewer programs but so 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:19.849
 super fast and fluid in my opinion 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:22.370
 I think it's super cool 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:30.370
 in relation to fluidity I did a test 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:30.370
 her in the year everything to do with 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:44.299
 memory ram several video tests and gave 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:49.010
 nine 297 to 4.12 stock without moving it 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:53.890
 nothing was variable between six and a half 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.890
 and 7 then so performance question 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:03:04.280
 changed quite 2000 points difference 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:10.660
 good that more neighborhood status changed the 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:10.660
 4.2 standard where you can add 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:23.600
 still 100% think that if it was equals the 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:25.700
 of young cia mold on one side she descends 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:28.310
 or if it was equal to 4.2 that it 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.450
 Come up here and see if you change this. 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:32.870
 earth I think it would be much more 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:38.630
 interesting than this whole screen that the 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:44.290
 Samsung made but it's great too without 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:44.290
 no problem so far the configuration 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:52.160
 not much has changed a few things and 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:54.829
 appears in relation to what you can 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:58.700
 install applications to the 

00:03:54.829 --> 00:04:05.090
 memory that also on the galaxy tab has no 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:07.880
 so much difference because by having 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:09.290
 a reasonable internal memory that is 16 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.720
 megas so it does not have this 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:15.829
 need as some 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:16.970
 smartphone from samsung has what 

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:19.849
 I told you about the 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:21.340
 screen locking is here blocking the 

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:28.300
 earth giant 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:31.150
 you have two clock options that stand alone 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:37.860
 so the personal message you put 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:37.860
 the name such I left the personal message 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:52.120
 4.22 August version August 3 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:05:00.790
 the panel is the strongest with France that 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:05:02.919
 has released but has the option of language 

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:05.470
 in Portuguese so she's all in 

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:07.510
 Portuguese, no problem with 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:10.260
 to performance 

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:10.260
 I find it super interesting 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:25.060
 before the 442 she had not used 

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:25.570
 a share of 50 mega miles from now 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:29.800
 not 

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:33.100
 it uses the 800 to 1804 actually 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:35.889
 she uses 800 denies part of ram 

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:39.039
 but there is so much good in relation to 

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:41.849
 Testing battery I have already installed 

00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:45.910
 one more no more touch and I installed one 

00:05:41.849 --> 00:05:48.849
 cost 11 already with 4,251 previous video 

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:50.889
 My regards from rp1 regarding battery was 

00:05:48.849 --> 00:05:52.930
 great government is here one because 

00:05:50.889 --> 00:05:54.400
 usually the world stories 

00:05:52.930 --> 00:06:00.270
 I do not know what happens is that they 

00:05:54.400 --> 00:06:03.490
 they use a lot of batteries sometimes they cost them 

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:06.160
 Do not even use the battery, I do not know why. 

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:07.780
 I can not say that either, but I will 

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:11.680
 to test on the battery but so 

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:16.780
 can install taboa is on dance site 

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:18.310
 mobile o 3g 

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:21.940
 sometimes the person talks but the baseband 

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:24.690
 It's the same as normal for me. 

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:26.889
 running normal 

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:28.450
 perfect, no problem with 

00:06:26.889 --> 00:06:32.190
 the speed by which sometimes 

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:35.060
 because of being another country's baseband 

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:38.180
 different from the other and 

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:42.470
 slower does not connect either trio 

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:44.810
 3g and stay here non normal hymn is with 

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:50.570
