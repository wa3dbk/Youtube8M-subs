to decorate is my mantle I think it's a
great<00:00:57.239> way<00:00:58.020> to<00:00:58.489> kind<00:00:59.489> of<00:01:00.410> revamp<00:01:01.410> a<00:01:01.800> room<00:01:02.370> very

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
great way to kind of revamp a room very

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.329 
great way to kind of revamp a room very
easily<00:01:03.300> and<00:01:03.750> it's<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.290> focal<00:01:04.530> point<00:01:04.739> of<00:01:05.159> our

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
easily and it's the focal point of our

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.160 
easily and it's the focal point of our
family<00:01:05.760> room<00:01:05.909> and<00:01:06.180> where<00:01:06.360> we<00:01:06.510> spend<00:01:06.780> most<00:01:06.840> of

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
family room and where we spend most of

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.800 
family room and where we spend most of
our<00:01:07.260> time<00:01:07.320> so<00:01:08.280> it<00:01:08.490> really<00:01:08.760> is<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.479> center<00:01:09.780> of

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
our time so it really is the center of

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.380 
our time so it really is the center of
our<00:01:10.049> house<00:01:10.260> so<00:01:10.950> when<00:01:11.520> I<00:01:11.549> was<00:01:12.000> thinking<00:01:12.330> about

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390
