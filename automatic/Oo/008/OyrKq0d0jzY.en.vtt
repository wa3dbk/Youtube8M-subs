 hello how about here I bring you this design 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:18.900
 super simple here I am using the 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:22.140
 oval color of the Basque collection laugh 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:27.259
 this limited edition collection this 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.259
 term and also this mix color royale 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:33.770
 I'm not sure if I'm going to go back to 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:36.290
 have a bright blue summary 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:39.500
 beautiful beautiful they are asking me so 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:42.640
 that such style will have it again but 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:46.280
 our insurance I'm starting with 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:49.489
 acrylic crystal these chips are chips 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.589
 stilettos that I have in my store this 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:55.579
 he announced that the store will open March 

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:59.359
 6 ok I'll go back to venice and the cuts 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:01.640
 to the desired extent a little bit of 

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:04.210
 crystal acrylic because we're going to use a 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.210
 The chemists 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:10.540
 here I started with the incredible 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:18.659
 it is a beautiful shiny gold is part of the 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:22.700
 consell 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.700
 I'm filling the whole arena 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.880
 10 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:33.190
 making a thin layer taking 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.190
 mind that I go in capsules 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:44.550
 now on the ring finger 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:49.470
 I'm going to put the color like that is a blue 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:51.330
 beautiful king this is a little transparent 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:55.250
 What do I like about him? 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:57.380
 Acrylic is a bit transparent 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.710
 so it's not so opaque but time 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:02.540
 it's more a beautiful so all the 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:05.150
 all and all that reached this 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:08.030
 collection I hope you like 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:09.410
 all the colors that will be very 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:13.480
 season 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:15.550
 all spring and even in the summer 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:19.750
 finally the strong colors were 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:22.799
 I showed this season and it's three months is 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.799
 one of my favorite colors 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:30.470
 and I'm doing the cuticle area 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:33.110
 remember that the pearls that 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:36.049
 we raise acrylic when we do the 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:40.150
 cuticle area should be a little more 

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:40.150
 wet from the regular 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.530
 dry we will not be able to seal days of 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:48.130
 safari 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:50.380
 now this is the index finger here I am 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:54.470
 using the audience 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:57.320
 is if you can see the brightness that I answer 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:59.260
 is I loved this mix that created a 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:01.870
 of the favorites 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:04.599
 because it has a beautiful shine 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:07.180
 and as I say they are not so opaque they are a 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:09.010
 little have a bit of transparency that 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:13.540
 the access a bit different very 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:16.720
 pretty and that's what we did and now 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:19.620
 I'm going to encapsulate the middle finger 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.610
 where we put the golden mixture 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.890
 encapsulating very well remember that 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:27.010
 when we imprison, it does not have to be 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:30.380
 a lot of acrylic a thin layer between 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:33.410
 less be 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:37.160
 - acrylic - we will have to iron out is 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:40.010
 that nothing else try to do it as much as 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:42.510
 best possible and so also not 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:45.910
 we waste so much product 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:50.920
 now on the ring finger where you the 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:53.740
 blue king how will i own gel and now 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:56.980
 I'm going to put these pictures maybe your king 

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:59.690
 also these for those who bought them in 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:02.930
 the michaels store 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:04.450
 they had a special note with all the 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:07.150
 boxes keys 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:09.159
 and then I took advantage 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:11.660
 this is how I say one of my 

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:14.330
 favorite colors so 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:16.370
 I can not leave them there as they see 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:18.830
 putting in the package they are coming from 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:20.989
 these measures come large medium and 

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:22.440
 little ones and that's what I'm doing 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:25.320
 as you can see 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:27.810
 I put balines nothing else that was not recorded 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:29.380
 but I put balines I like to put them in 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:33.850
 the Stalinist priests 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:38.170
 I put a clean lamp with alcohol and 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:43.160
 now I'm putting the starboard king 

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:46.110
 sorry that being queens is part of your voice 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:49.770
 to better adhere the design 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:52.020
 studio design taking care of not 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:54.660
 use it on top of the stones as 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:56.110
 you know so as not to lose the cut of 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:58.960
 stones that 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:00.789
 the new one no longer april riding 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:02.650

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:13.270

00:05:10.449 --> 00:05:15.910

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:18.580
