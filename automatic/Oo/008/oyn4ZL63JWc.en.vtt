00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:52.750 
think the package is really keeps up

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:55.740 
think the package is really keeps up
shiny<00:04:53.080> and<00:04:53.380> I<00:04:53.800> can<00:04:54.730> get<00:04:54.940> what<00:04:55.150> I<00:04:55.180> got<00:04:55.420> my<00:04:55.510> blush
