00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.219 
to form it into the shape on the top
first<00:01:50.700> let's<00:01:51.299> move<00:01:51.450> this<00:01:51.630> rectangle<00:01:52.110> out<00:01:52.170> of

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
first let's move this rectangle out of

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.889 
first let's move this rectangle out of
the<00:01:52.290> way<00:01:52.549> and<00:01:53.549> making<00:01:53.729> work<00:01:53.970> only<00:01:54.360> on<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:54.780> red

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
the way and making work only on the red

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.539 
the way and making work only on the red
pack<00:01:55.110> now<00:01:55.290> I'm<00:01:55.710> just<00:01:55.799> going<00:01:56.009> to<00:01:56.040> work<00:01:56.250> it<00:01:56.399> back

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
pack now I'm just going to work it back

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.010 
pack now I'm just going to work it back
and<00:01:56.759> forth<00:01:56.969> with<00:01:57.119> this<00:01:57.180> piece<00:01:57.390> of<00:01:57.509> track<00:01:57.689> again

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
and forth with this piece of track again

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.180 
and forth with this piece of track again
to<00:01:58.530> get<00:01:58.649> down<00:01:58.829> to<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:58.979> right<00:01:59.159> shape<00:01:59.430> for

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:00.190 
to get down to the right shape for

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:03.030 
to get down to the right shape for
and<00:02:01.120> then<00:02:01.630> I<00:02:01.660> can<00:02:01.900> really<00:02:02.200> cut<00:02:02.470> two<00:02:02.620> pieces<00:02:02.770> of

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:03.040 
and then I can really cut two pieces of

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.770 
and then I can really cut two pieces of
it<00:02:05.880> that<00:02:06.880> looks<00:02:07.030> pretty<00:02:07.150> good<00:02:07.270> there<00:02:07.540> now<00:02:07.750> I

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
it that looks pretty good there now I

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.359 
it that looks pretty good there now I
can<00:02:07.960> cut<00:02:08.170> the<00:02:08.350> ends<00:02:08.650> off<00:02:08.770> to<00:02:08.979> make<00:02:09.130> it<00:02:09.250> the

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
can cut the ends off to make it the

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:12.750 
can cut the ends off to make it the
right<00:02:09.520> size<00:02:09.760> that<00:02:10.479> looks<00:02:10.660> pretty<00:02:10.810> good<00:02:10.930> now<00:02:11.760> I

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
right size that looks pretty good now I

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.670 
right size that looks pretty good now I
think<00:02:13.030> I'll<00:02:13.210> notch<00:02:13.510> out<00:02:14.580> the<00:02:15.580> part<00:02:15.880> here<00:02:16.390> and

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
think I'll notch out the part here and

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.160 
think I'll notch out the part here and
here<00:02:17.680> and<00:02:17.830> then<00:02:18.520> we'll<00:02:18.640> have<00:02:18.910> it<00:02:19.090> looking<00:02:20.020> more

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
here and then we'll have it looking more

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:24.270 
here and then we'll have it looking more
likely<00:02:21.180> let<00:02:22.180> loose<00:02:22.540> I<00:02:22.900> came<00:02:23.470> pretty<00:02:23.650> good<00:02:23.890> now

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
likely let loose I came pretty good now

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.800 
likely let loose I came pretty good now
i'm<00:02:24.370> going<00:02:24.460> to<00:02:24.520> not<00:02:24.670> show<00:02:24.910> the<00:02:25.090> piece<00:02:25.300> here<00:02:25.690> in

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
i'm going to not show the piece here in

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.440 
i'm going to not show the piece here in
here<00:02:26.680> so<00:02:27.400> it<00:02:27.610> looks<00:02:27.760> like<00:02:27.850> there's<00:02:28.120> a<00:02:28.180> spot

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
here so it looks like there's a spot

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.140 
here so it looks like there's a spot
there<00:02:28.690> but<00:02:29.500> first<00:02:29.860> i'm<00:02:30.220> going<00:02:30.370> to<00:02:30.490> add<00:02:30.610> the<00:02:30.910> top

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
there but first i'm going to add the top

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.600 
there but first i'm going to add the top
in<00:02:31.510> black<00:02:31.750> and<00:02:32.140> black<00:02:32.350> and<00:02:32.560> black<00:02:32.740> here<00:02:33.070> so

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
in black and black and black here so

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:35.490 
in black and black and black here so
will<00:02:33.760> it<00:02:33.850> be<00:02:33.910> easier<00:02:34.330> to<00:02:34.390> cut<00:02:34.660> when<00:02:35.020> i<00:02:35.050> do<00:02:35.170> the

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
will it be easier to cut when i do the

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.560 
will it be easier to cut when i do the
trimming<00:02:35.830> so<00:02:36.640> for<00:02:36.820> that<00:02:36.970> part<00:02:37.210> i'm<00:02:37.390> going<00:02:37.480> to

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:37.570 
trimming so for that part i'm going to

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:39.810 
trimming so for that part i'm going to
take<00:02:37.720> some<00:02:37.870> black<00:02:38.110> and<00:02:38.440> roll<00:02:39.160> it<00:02:39.310> flat<00:02:39.460> with<00:02:39.700> my

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:39.820 
take some black and roll it flat with my

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:44.100 
take some black and roll it flat with my
play<00:02:40.240> dough<00:02:40.300> roller<00:02:40.690> just<00:02:41.560> like<00:02:41.740> this<00:02:43.050> now<00:02:44.050> i

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
play dough roller just like this now i

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.830 
play dough roller just like this now i
can<00:02:44.380> cut<00:02:44.560> out<00:02:44.850> the<00:02:45.850> rectangles<00:02:46.450> need<00:02:46.600> it<00:02:46.690> for

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
can cut out the rectangles need it for

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.900 
can cut out the rectangles need it for
the<00:02:46.900> top<00:02:47.080> of<00:02:47.260> the<00:02:47.350> end<00:02:47.620> there<00:02:48.460> that<00:02:48.700> came

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
the top of the end there that came

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:50.910 
the top of the end there that came
really<00:02:49.090> good<00:02:49.360> now<00:02:50.320> i'm<00:02:50.410> going<00:02:50.500> to<00:02:50.560> not<00:02:50.710> show

four<00:03:13.270> black<00:03:13.420> falls<00:03:13.780> to<00:03:14.380> make<00:03:14.530> it<00:03:14.650> higher<00:03:14.830> I<00:03:14.860> do

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.100 
four black falls to make it higher I do

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.160 
four black falls to make it higher I do
is<00:03:15.400> squeeze<00:03:16.209> it<00:03:16.330> with<00:03:16.390> your<00:03:16.450> fingers<00:03:16.840> it

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
is squeeze it with your fingers it

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:19.320 
is squeeze it with your fingers it
performs<00:03:17.500> a<00:03:17.560> round<00:03:17.739> circle<00:03:17.920> and<00:03:18.280> that'll<00:03:19.150> be<00:03:19.300> R

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:19.330 
performs a round circle and that'll be R

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.290 
performs a round circle and that'll be R
