00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:26.260
 Microwave microwave is 800 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:32.050
 watts you have to put it at 60 percent 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:34.660
 of power for 13 minutes 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:37.510

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:39.790
 microwave and we have removed it is already 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:44.290
 done but for you to see what we check 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:46.990
 I put my finger together and turned around and pressed 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:49.220
 you see a little and my finger does not sink 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:51.500
 it's soft 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:54.650
 but note that then when 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.720

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:59.150

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:03.410
 unmold once we have the flan 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:05.960

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:08.470
 grace 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.799
