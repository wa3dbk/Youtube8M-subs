sleep<00:02:09.610> and<00:02:10.330> that<00:02:11.019> was<00:02:11.319> certainly<00:02:11.650> nothing

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
sleep and that was certainly nothing

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:20.420

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
the wind is just amazingly strong right

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:26.209 
the wind is just amazingly strong right
now<00:02:24.269> which<00:02:24.629> pretty<00:02:25.019> much<00:02:25.109> wipes<00:02:25.590> out<00:02:25.859> our

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:26.219 
now which pretty much wipes out our

00:02:26.219 --> 00:02:28.910 
now which pretty much wipes out our
fishing<00:02:27.000> and<00:02:27.959> it's<00:02:28.230> going<00:02:28.319> to<00:02:28.409> limit<00:02:28.620> our

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
fishing and it's going to limit our

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.349 
fishing and it's going to limit our
exploring<00:02:29.549> so<00:02:29.730> we're<00:02:29.819> probably<00:02:29.939> going<00:02:30.180> to<00:02:30.239> go

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:30.359 
exploring so we're probably going to go

00:02:30.359 --> 00:02:32.030
