little familiar doesn't it you know back
when<00:00:25.980> I<00:00:26.039> couldn't<00:00:26.460> get<00:00:26.580> on<00:00:26.699> the<00:00:26.820> platforms<00:00:27.390> you

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
when I couldn't get on the platforms you

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.439 
when I couldn't get on the platforms you
go<00:00:28.170> through<00:00:28.380> this<00:00:28.470> way<00:00:28.650> again<00:00:29.119> thank<00:00:30.119> you<00:00:30.269> for

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
go through this way again thank you for

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.690 
go through this way again thank you for
not<00:00:30.539> linearity<00:00:30.869> of<00:00:31.410> course<00:00:32.219> with<00:00:32.399> this<00:00:32.489> game

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
not linearity of course with this game

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:33.860 
not linearity of course with this game
doesn't<00:00:33.030> really<00:00:33.210> seem<00:00:33.390> like<00:00:33.450> there's<00:00:33.690> a

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
doesn't really seem like there's a

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.740 
doesn't really seem like there's a
linearity<00:00:34.320> or<00:00:35.010> non<00:00:35.219> linearity<00:00:35.550> because<00:00:36.149> it

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
linearity or non linearity because it

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:37.940 
linearity or non linearity because it
just<00:00:36.870> seems<00:00:37.140> like<00:00:37.260> it<00:00:37.469> goes<00:00:37.590> all<00:00:37.739> over<00:00:37.770> the

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
just seems like it goes all over the

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.560 
just seems like it goes all over the
place<00:00:38.129> because<00:00:38.489> sometimes<00:00:39.000> you<00:00:39.270> think<00:00:39.360> you're

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
place because sometimes you think you're

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.810 
place because sometimes you think you're
going<00:00:39.719> to<00:00:39.920> direction<00:00:40.920> of<00:00:41.010> progress<00:00:41.399> also<00:00:41.610> this

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
going to direction of progress also this

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.560 
going to direction of progress also this
looks<00:00:42.000> familiar<00:00:42.059> too<00:00:44.329> maybe<00:00:45.329> is<00:00:45.629> john<00:00:46.079> board

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:47.570 
looks familiar too maybe is john board

for<00:01:31.200> no<00:01:31.350> reason<00:01:31.770> at<00:01:31.920> all<00:01:31.950> on<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:32.940> fact<00:01:33.180> that

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
for no reason at all on the fact that

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.260 
for no reason at all on the fact that
can<00:01:33.570> be<00:01:35.750> denied<00:01:36.750> you<00:01:36.990> then

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
can be denied you then

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:39.520 
can be denied you then
I<00:01:38.359> don't<00:01:38.899> know<00:01:38.960> that's<00:01:39.109> what<00:01:39.229> you<00:01:39.320> want<00:01:39.469> to

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
I don't know that's what you want to

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.859 
I don't know that's what you want to
start<00:01:39.770> thinking<00:01:40.250> again<00:01:40.539> that's<00:01:41.539> what<00:01:41.659> another

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:41.869 
start thinking again that's what another

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:43.120 
start thinking again that's what another
thing<00:01:41.960> at<00:01:42.200> the<00:01:42.259> beginning<00:01:42.500> reminds<00:01:42.829> me<00:01:42.979> of

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
thing at the beginning reminds me of

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.469 
thing at the beginning reminds me of
when<00:01:43.369> I<00:01:43.460> hear<00:01:43.670> it<00:01:43.789> oh<00:01:44.920> I<00:01:45.920> don't<00:01:46.460> understand<00:01:47.240> the

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
when I hear it oh I don't understand the

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:51.680 
when I hear it oh I don't understand the
need<00:01:48.079> to<00:01:48.409> have<00:01:48.710> an<00:01:48.950> invincibility<00:01:49.399> really

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:51.690 
need to have an invincibility really

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:54.200 
need to have an invincibility really
so<00:01:52.410> it's<00:01:52.560> kind<00:01:52.890> of<00:01:53.010> just<00:01:53.130> easier<00:01:53.520> to<00:01:53.580> roll<00:01:53.940> into

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
so it's kind of just easier to roll into

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.160 
so it's kind of just easier to roll into
those<00:01:54.540> that<00:01:54.810> it<00:01:54.900> is<00:01:55.020> to<00:01:55.230> actually<00:01:55.470> jump<00:01:56.780> also<00:01:57.780> a

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
those that it is to actually jump also a

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.590 
those that it is to actually jump also a
ja<00:01:58.470> vu<00:01:58.680> much<00:02:00.200> asia<00:02:01.200> i<00:02:01.350> do<00:02:01.470> much<00:02:02.270> okay<00:02:03.270> i<00:02:03.300> guess

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
ja vu much asia i do much okay i guess

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.440 
ja vu much asia i do much okay i guess
there's<00:02:03.810> going<00:02:03.960> to<00:02:04.020> be<00:02:04.050> their<00:02:04.980> second<00:02:05.280> timer

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
there's going to be their second timer

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.160 
there's going to be their second timer
not<00:02:06.450> quite<00:02:06.690> what<00:02:06.840> I<00:02:06.870> was<00:02:06.930> expecting<00:02:07.050> actually

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
not quite what I was expecting actually

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.000 
not quite what I was expecting actually
say<00:02:10.170> you're<00:02:10.320> going<00:02:10.590> to<00:02:10.649> need<00:02:10.740> to<00:02:10.770> use<00:02:10.920> the

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:11.010 
say you're going to need to use the

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:14.060 
say you're going to need to use the
arrow<00:02:11.250> keys<00:02:11.340> with<00:02:11.730> thing<00:02:12.510> because<00:02:12.870> like<00:02:13.110> it

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:14.070 
arrow keys with thing because like it

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:23.400 
arrow keys with thing because like it
goes<00:02:14.430> by<00:02:15.240> itself<00:02:17.270> ok<00:02:18.270> we<00:02:18.450> have<00:02:18.540> a<00:02:18.600> choice<00:02:18.960> now

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.530 

grab<00:02:24.010> a<00:02:24.040> ring<00:02:24.340> but<00:02:24.670> that's<00:02:24.880> not<00:02:25.000> what<00:02:25.390> we're

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
grab a ring but that's not what we're

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
don't like the way that feels the

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:02.430 
don't like the way that feels the
controls<00:03:01.390> and<00:03:01.480> everything<00:03:01.840> it's<00:03:02.200> just<00:03:02.260> a

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
controls and everything it's just a

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.670 
controls and everything it's just a
really<00:03:02.710> different<00:03:03.190> game<00:03:03.850> for<00:03:04.570> all<00:03:04.780> its<00:03:05.290> just

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
go into the bonus stage and probably cut

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.740 
go into the bonus stage and probably cut
it<00:03:31.840> out<00:03:31.960> or<00:03:32.290> to<00:03:32.590> the<00:03:32.620> if<00:03:32.920> your<00:03:33.070> convenience

it out or to the if your convenience

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.120 
it out or to the if your convenience
because<00:03:34.750> we<00:03:34.960> all<00:03:34.990> know<00:03:35.140> what<00:03:35.320> the<00:03:35.530> stage<00:03:35.770> is<00:03:35.800> by

because we all know what the stage is by
now<00:03:36.280> I<00:03:36.400> think<00:03:36.700> of<00:03:37.690> course<00:03:37.930> I<00:03:38.080> didn't<00:03:38.260> want<00:03:38.380> that

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
now I think of course I didn't want that

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:43.080 
now I think of course I didn't want that
barrier<00:03:39.210> whatever<00:03:40.530> we<00:03:41.530> have<00:03:41.770> the<00:03:42.160> crappy

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.090 
barrier whatever we have the crappy

shield<00:03:43.300> now<00:03:43.510> so<00:03:43.930> we<00:03:44.350> can<00:03:44.380> crappily<00:03:44.950> take<00:03:45.160> one

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
shield now so we can crappily take one

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.850
