00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:18.029
 hi guys, welcome to our appointment 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.150
 today we will talk about a new topic interesting the best film 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.509
 for today we will meet only two regular figures a group of three is a 

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:28.819
 group of 5 

00:00:28.819 --> 00:00:30.929
 the group 2 3 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.170
 is composed of right hand right hand pl 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.160
 vol. 5 gym gym gym left hand 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:41.500
 therefore 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.500
 the 3 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.390
 hi5 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.840
 It is very important that you every single group of you but a 4 and a 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.450
 accompanies otherwise 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:01.450
 at the time people at a combination of three 

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:08.730
 our brain gives us the intimate illusion of live fish therefore you are the 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:12.980
 singer it cose the group of the group was in the mind of the group from 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:15.920
 others are simply 3 16 months 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:16.950
 therefore 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.000
 now you give a group of ad libitum wolves 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.580
 I hope he knows the meaning of this word 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.580
 otherwise explain your teachings 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:30.550
 diana on the ground 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:43.240
 same thing for the group of five yesterday will be a little more uncomfortable 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.520
 tiziana testi is an internal inter 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.869
 important that you equal to euro order on this exercise otherwise 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.130
 christie you saw perceive in groups 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.130
 it is not in their nature of the sixteenth notes 

00:02:09.939 --> 00:02:14.689
 another interesting expedient we can say for why to live 

00:02:14.689 --> 00:02:19.079
 learn physically with the europe ita dre head and those from 5 

00:02:19.859 --> 00:02:23.959
 re is to and heart attacks help from the drums as the drums produce 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:25.199
 Mosiah 

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:28.779
 we could think of a group of three composed of a tomo rollante case 

00:02:31.429 --> 00:02:33.450
 is a group of 5 composed 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.239
 tomo rollante second tomo rollante and casso in fifth place 

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:46.889
 obviously, we will have to go and fill a measure of 16x16 

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:56.279
 and the combination of 3 3 5 5 or 5 5 3 3 or 5 3 5 3 etc. etc. 

00:02:56.279 --> 00:02:57.739
 always does 16 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:02:59.359
 but each produces 

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:01.809
 present a different sound 

00:03:01.809 --> 00:03:04.809
 let us consider 5 3 5 lands 

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:08.069
 alassio I will make the wolf 5 3 5 3 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:11.569
 help help we try to memorize with respect to time 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:15.589
 let's call it Cavalese something else that comes out of the drums like music 

00:03:27.779 --> 00:03:31.689
 so what I heard musically was 

00:03:42.969 --> 00:03:47.329
 obviously changing the combination we will get another clarence and so it is 

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:49.089
 we can yamato 

00:03:49.089 --> 00:03:53.869
 obviously the drums only serve us initially to learn physically 

00:03:53.869 --> 00:03:55.079
 moemento 

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:59.119
 then emp much more interesting to manage and linear 

00:03:59.119 --> 00:04:03.759
 present in this case the 5 3 5 3 using more pieces is more than narnia 

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:09.289
 now let's take an example of time I have broken time bars and then follows 

00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:13.819
 rollin 'air fire with its respective ideos 80 closing on 5 3 5 3 

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:41.220
 obviously other combinations can also be used 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.409
 it is particularly eni 

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:48.499
 extra father's valleys could be the 3 5 3 5 combinations to use 

00:04:48.499 --> 00:04:52.800
 gomen variation no pattern while vol we carry a time 

00:04:53.379 --> 00:04:56.629
 because I chose 3 5 3 5 

00:04:56.629 --> 00:05:01.990
 203 5 of the circus for the simple reason that su dance in my blog modules are the 

00:05:01.989 --> 00:05:03.270
 my background 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:09.059
 and it sounds a lot better on tram 7 5 3 is much better i3 i5 on time 

00:05:09.059 --> 00:05:15.609
 om used a point a peculiarity in the enduro little over 5 I put 

00:05:15.609 --> 00:05:18.609
 the emphasis on the second 16th of the UDC of the group of five 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:23.759
 the way I can fall and the sol battery of two while only the variation 

00:05:23.759 --> 00:05:24.879
 that is 

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:27.830
 new zealand too 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:29.000
 now 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.379
 fibers 

00:05:30.379 --> 00:05:34.240
 how many liters would be with these accents u 

00:05:40.879 --> 00:05:42.659
 they 

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:46.029
 now let's try to use it as a variation coming out of a groove 

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:49.990
 whatever 

00:06:12.749 --> 00:06:14.029
 hello guys next time
