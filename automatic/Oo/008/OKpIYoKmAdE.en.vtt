00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:11.139
 is 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:15.440
 hello girls and girls, be fine 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.820
 Come to our kitchen 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.470
 today 's recipe is one of mine 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.970
 favorite because I can eat with 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:21.020
 hand and also share with people 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:22.970
 that I love 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:24.980
 Seriously, there's something hotter than 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.150
 make a pizza and do not think it 's a 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.950
 any track not 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:31.340
 today I'll show you how to make the pasta 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:33.050
 perfect that only takes three ingredients and 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:35.000
 Finally I will study to make a 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.440
 filling of Maria Rita which is different from 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:50.900
 the best I have ever tasted stay 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:52.850
 me first time do not make the 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:55.489
 pizza dough 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.500
 you're basically going to need 250 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:01.190
 grams of wheat flour also from a 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:03.379
 teaspoon of salt and five grams per 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.210
 half of the batch of dry biological yeast 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:07.250
 this special segment for the mass of 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:08.479
 Pizza is very easy to find in 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.460
 supermarket 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:12.590
 We will use means that I think 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:15.140
 you can double the sachet equal amount 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.700
 in pots or plastic bags is still good 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.920
 for about a month 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.350
 but if you want to use all the content 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.180
 can also just double the amount 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:26.660
 of the two ingredients that we put 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:33.050
 Portugal in a bowl Mix the flour 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:35.000
 the salt and the yeast then present 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:37.300
 about half american water field 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.300
 warm 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:44.190
 start mixing the dough with your hands 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.020
 add more water if you are 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:48.619
 too hard or too much flour if 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.619
 very soft 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.760
 make dough for a smooth surface and 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.310
 the knot begins 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:59.130
 you should make stretching movements and 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.440
 pull you should stretch with the base of the 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.630
 palms using this candy here 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:12.090
 underneath and pull with the tips of the fingers 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:14.730
 then stretches and pulls after stealing the 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:18.230
 mass for about five minutes of life 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.230
 in the middle and make two chickens 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:26.709
 put in plastic bags and let 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:26.709
 rest for two hours 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.190
 then take one of the balls and with 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:43.190
 the help of a roll of pasta open the 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:44.870
 mass on a high floured surface 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:47.120
 tape ball can be saved in 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.680
 refrigerator for four days or do not 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.810
 for about a month 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.770
 or you can pass the two disks 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:56.540
 Same-Day Pizza Has Problems In 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:59.900
 Pre heat the oven to 200 degrees and take 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:05.030
 a form of non-stick tape with 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:08.110
 place the dough open over the 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:10.400
 wheel brand that does not fit in the form 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:11.660
 now it 's time to pay for the sauce 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.489
 tomato in the woods 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.350
 you can buy a ready-made sauce or 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:17.900
 then make that peeled tomato sauce 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:19.940
 nor for you at the request made time beyond 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.950
 putting little slow do not soak 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:26.450
 but kills two tablespoons are that 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:29.079
 who also chooses a tablespoon 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:29.079
 of olive oil 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.829
 you will notice that this filling of 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:35.989
 margherita is a little different instead 

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:37.280
 of traditional mozzarella using mozzarella 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:40.640
 of buffalo and parmesan 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:44.410
 but I promise it gets a lot of spice and 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:47.780
 120 grams of grated Parmesan on the note 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:49.820
 in the sequence add 250 grams of 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.590
 preferably buffalo mozzarella 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:54.790
 of these comes balls that you can 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:54.790
 dismantle with your hands 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:01.110
 finish with about ten fresh leaves 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:01.110
 of basil 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:12.730
 bring to the preheated oven for about 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:14.920
 10 minutes until golden finally tackles 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:18.389
 cut eight triangular pieces and 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.389
 finish with one more tone series 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:23.070
 enjoy your food 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:32.440
 one of the greatest pleasures of this life felt 

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:34.480
 the taste of food so it is so 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:36.730
 It's cool for us to make bread 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:38.860
 people can share with everyone doing 

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:41.190
 the pizza tastes like and with who you love until 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.190
