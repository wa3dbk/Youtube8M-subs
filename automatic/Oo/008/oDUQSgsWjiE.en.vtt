00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
when I expected the quail nothing was

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.850 
when I expected the quail nothing was
wrong<00:00:49.500> as<00:00:50.280> far<00:00:50.309> as<00:00:50.640> any<00:00:50.789> visible<00:00:51.680> damages<00:00:52.680> or

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
wrong as far as any visible damages or

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.920 
wrong as far as any visible damages or
anything<00:00:53.100> like<00:00:53.370> that<00:00:53.430> like<00:00:53.760> an<00:00:53.910> animal<00:00:54.329> snuck

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
anything like that like an animal snuck

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.170 
anything like that like an animal snuck
in<00:00:55.050> a<00:00:55.110> cage<00:00:55.350> and<00:00:55.530> killed<00:00:55.739> him<00:00:55.920> so<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.820> only

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
in a cage and killed him so the only

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.660 
in a cage and killed him so the only
thing<00:00:57.420> I'm<00:00:57.600> assuming<00:00:58.140> is<00:00:58.410> that<00:00:58.670> something

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
thing I'm assuming is that something

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.250 
thing I'm assuming is that something
happened<00:01:00.120> and<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.300> quail<00:01:00.510> got<00:01:00.780> scared<00:01:01.079> and

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
happened and the quail got scared and

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.969 
happened and the quail got scared and
jumped<00:01:01.440> up<00:01:01.649> and<00:01:01.859> broke<00:01:02.010> his<00:01:02.160> neck<00:01:02.840> so<00:01:03.840> I<00:01:04.199> have

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
jumped up and broke his neck so I have

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.210 
jumped up and broke his neck so I have
five<00:01:05.339> now<00:01:05.700> I<00:01:05.729> have<00:01:06.140> one<00:01:07.470> and<00:01:07.740> four<00:01:07.979> hands

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
five now I have one and four hands

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.490
