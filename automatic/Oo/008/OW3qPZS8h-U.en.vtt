and<00:01:08.010> found<00:01:09.010> that<00:01:09.690> the<00:01:10.690> installation<00:01:10.900> went

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:11.230 
and found that the installation went

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:14.010 
and found that the installation went

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:14.020 
extremely well there was an issue with

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.520 
extremely well there was an issue with
some<00:01:14.260> other<00:01:15.060> suspension<00:01:16.060> parts<00:01:16.510> that<00:01:16.810> can

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:17.530 
some other suspension parts that can

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:19.650 
some other suspension parts that can
helped<00:01:17.860> us<00:01:18.010> identify<00:01:18.190> and<00:01:18.850> so<00:01:19.300> what<00:01:19.510> we're

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:19.660 
helped us identify and so what we're

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:23.550
