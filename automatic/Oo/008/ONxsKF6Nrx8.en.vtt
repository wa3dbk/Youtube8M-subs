00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.080
 mention that the following video refers to the application of this 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.119

 and three barrels 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:58.260
 however, these must be done alternately 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.880
 a sweep then the trachea

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:12.820
 first hand 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.450
 before applying the product yields to edit until communication is achieved 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:22.020

 It is proceeded to sand the wood with a sandpaper fandel and 180 

00:02:18.249 --> 00:02:20.569
 to soften the surface 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:23.579
 the five steps are repeated twice more 

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:25.870
 once the surface is requested 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:30.809
