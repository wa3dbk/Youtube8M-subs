eyes yet I used it on the cheeks

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.340 
eyes yet I used it on the cheeks
yesterday<00:02:10.890> it<00:02:11.400> didn't<00:02:11.910> last<00:02:12.120> brilliantly

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
yesterday it didn't last brilliantly

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.240 
yesterday it didn't last brilliantly
as<00:02:13.560> good<00:02:14.280> as<00:02:14.460> the<00:02:14.760> cream<00:02:15.150> cheek<00:02:15.480> color<00:02:15.870> but<00:02:16.260> it

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
as good as the cream cheek color but it

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.510 
as good as the cream cheek color but it
lasted<00:02:17.910> ok<00:02:18.330> for<00:02:18.780> a<00:02:18.810> number<00:02:19.440> of<00:02:19.530> hours<00:02:19.920> so<00:02:20.310> I

lasted ok for a number of hours so I

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.390 
lasted ok for a number of hours so I
think<00:02:20.610> it's<00:02:20.820> quite<00:02:21.000> a<00:02:21.120> versatile<00:02:21.930> product<00:02:22.830> and

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
think it's quite a versatile product and

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.840 
think it's quite a versatile product and

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:13.940 
is just really really pretty I mean you
can<00:04:12.120> obviously<00:04:12.270> share<00:04:13.050> it<00:04:13.230> out<00:04:13.440> quite<00:04:13.770> a<00:04:13.800> lot

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950 
can obviously share it out quite a lot

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:18.020

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:22.240 
and just gives that very peachy tone I
will<00:04:18.630> say<00:04:18.989> this<00:04:19.830> one<00:04:20.250> is<00:04:20.520> not<00:04:21.090> as<00:04:21.330> good<00:04:21.989> a

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:22.250 
will say this one is not as good a

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:26.060 
will say this one is not as good a
texture<00:04:23.250> as<00:04:23.690> some<00:04:24.690> of<00:04:24.810> the<00:04:24.900> previous<00:04:25.169> powders

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
texture as some of the previous powders

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.690 
texture as some of the previous powders
it's

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:26.700 
it's

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:29.900 
it's
definitely<00:04:26.970> a<00:04:27.000> little<00:04:27.360> hard<00:04:28.110> and<00:04:28.910> greenies

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:29.910

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520 
putting a bit too high but it does give

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:37.310 
putting a bit too high but it does give
a<00:04:32.850> very<00:04:33.600> pretty<00:04:34.370> champagne<00:04:35.990> let's<00:04:36.990> put<00:04:37.230> it

a very pretty champagne let's put it

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:41.960 
a very pretty champagne let's put it
over<00:04:37.470> the<00:04:37.730> color<00:04:39.830> there<00:04:40.830> you<00:04:41.010> can<00:04:41.040> see<00:04:41.220> kind<00:04:41.760> of

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:41.970 
over the color there you can see kind of

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:45.490 
over the color there you can see kind of
warming<00:04:42.300> that<00:04:42.510> up<00:04:42.780> this<00:04:43.530> one<00:04:43.860> over<00:04:44.430> the<00:04:44.550> color

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:45.500 
warming that up this one over the color

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.880 
warming that up this one over the color
it's<00:04:46.500> not<00:04:46.680> glittery<00:04:47.340> enough<00:04:47.580> for<00:04:47.880> you<00:04:48.090> and

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:48.890 
it's not glittery enough for you and

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:51.860 
it's not glittery enough for you and
then<00:04:49.890> you<00:04:50.010> can<00:04:50.160> work<00:04:50.340> with<00:04:50.550> that<00:04:50.580> so<00:04:51.030> I<00:04:51.240> haven't

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:57.810

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:23.880 
of more shimmery pale look but the

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:28.010 
of more shimmery pale look but the
consistencies<00:05:24.750> I<00:05:25.140> prefer<00:05:26.010> to<00:05:26.250> this<00:05:26.490> I<00:05:27.090> still

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:28.020

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:33.020 
quite like the Kevin oak wine
candlelight<00:05:30.560> prefer<00:05:31.560> the<00:05:31.710> consistency<00:05:32.490> to

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:33.030 
candlelight prefer the consistency to

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:35.390 
candlelight prefer the consistency to
this<00:05:33.210> one<00:05:33.480> but<00:05:33.720> I<00:05:34.290> haven't<00:05:34.680> got<00:05:34.830> anything
