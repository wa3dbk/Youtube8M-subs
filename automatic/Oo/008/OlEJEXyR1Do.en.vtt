00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.759
 young eye that this video serves to 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.330
 other devices either mid-range 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.370
 or high 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:18.000
 good let's start with the video tutorial 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:20.310
 what your friend gamer pro 98 brings you 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.289
 we give in extract here in the file rar 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.519
 to leave the download limit in the 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.519
 video description 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.929
 now we will have these two files 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:35.120
 one is the game's apk and another is the 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.120
 files that go in sd memory 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:44.320
 at this moment I am connecting my 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:47.940
 device to the pc and that's why it will take 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.940
 a few seconds xd xd 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.180
 As you can see, the files that appeared 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.100
 they are in the sd memory and we will pass the 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.890
 apk to one of the folders that most 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.410
 want me to leave at the moment 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.780
 Android folder and now we will pass the 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:16.280
 sd files in the android folder 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.280
 hydrate we stick it in there 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.190
 we wait for the end of the 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.190
 records 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:37.130
 well while these fucking files are 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:39.380
 they are going, I am telling you that 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:42.049
 I will be uploading the game in a few hours 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:45.369
 of dead space for galaxy gio un xd 

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:45.369
 xddd 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:56.670
 is already ending 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:07.759
 As you can see, I'm finished and now 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:10.099
 I will proceed to eject the removable disk 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:14.560
 and now I will record the cell phone with my camera 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:14.560
 to teach them how to install the game 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:31.340
 As you can see, we are already on the screen of the 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.340
 galaxy yogurt 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:38.280
 it will lower a bit the brightness so that it 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:40.379
 appreciate the screen better now 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.599
 we will enter our browser 

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:44.700
 good files that you have in 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:47.129
 my case is called my files when 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.959
 we have entered look for the apk of 

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:51.720
 game in the folder that we have 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:55.519
 past I left it in the android folder 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.519
 and from there he installs him to observe 

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:08.950
 now we give in install 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.660
 we mark in realized 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:27.420
 eye that the only way to make run 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:29.459
 the game is using chain fire 3d and the 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:32.240
 only way to use this is to be 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:32.240
 root user 

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:39.100
 I will be doing a video tutorial 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:41.320
 on how to install chain fire 3d for 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:43.450
 the road users later on if 

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:45.760
 you like you can see in others 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:47.800
 channels videos how to install it good 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.290
 those who already have it installed to brando 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:52.780
 and look at the steps I'm going to take 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:55.180
 give in de fort open gl settings then in 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.570
 reduces texture quality in plugin mark 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.570
 walk on 

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:39.940
 well here I already had the game 

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:42.340
 saved with the car that I chose you 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:44.650
 at the beginning they will look like a screen 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:46.660
 to choose your car I recommend them 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:51.070
 that they choose one like mine since it is 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:53.500
 more stable xd xd xdddd when they go 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:55.690
 passing the story mode of the game is going 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:57.360
 to raise a quantity of money and they will leave 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:59.470
 unlocking more cars and 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:02.640
 later they will be able to improve the one 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:02.640
 you already have 

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:17.040
 I'll give you a quick run so you can see 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:19.230
 how is the game inside and observe that 

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:22.310
 It is very fluid as long as they have 

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:22.310
 fire 3 p 

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:35.580
 in this game the accelerometer of 

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:38.360
 right to left to be able to move the 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:38.360
 car xvii 

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:47.510
 in the description of the video I will leave you a 

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:49.910
 link a channel so they can see how 

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:51.590
 install chain fire 3d so that the one 

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:55.600
 do not have it eye that they have to be 

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:55.600
 rock users if not it will not serve them 

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:05.560
 excuse me pause the video because someone 

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:10.030
 he came to fuck at the door loving me 

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:12.520
 sell utensils xd xd xd xddddd 

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:14.830
 As you can see, the game is already running 

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:18.720
 as long as they do everything that 

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:18.720
 I have shown with the umpire 3 p 

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:24.139
 I'll call I can not play well because I have 

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:26.590
 holding on to this camera so I'll do what 

00:06:24.139 --> 00:06:26.590
 I can 

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:58.140
 if in case when they start the 

00:06:56.010 --> 00:07:00.330
 game and you see the black screen in 

00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:02.430
 the moment the car starts it does not 

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:04.380
 scare the way to solve this is 

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:06.330
 putting the button backwards and then 

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:08.430
 press the start button about 

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:10.410
 seconds and go back and back 

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:12.360
 this way will be fixed wait a few 

00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:15.560
 seconds after the screen returns to 

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:15.560
 react observe 

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:20.470
 as you see when you press that the screen will 

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:23.470
 freezes for a few seconds when and 

00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:25.420
 they know at least about 25 seconds 

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:27.990
 they give in the part of that arrow that 

00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:27.990
 go back 

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:32.710

00:07:30.729 --> 00:07:35.199

00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:36.759
