00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:10.140
 hello and welcome to this demo of 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:12.059
 lapilli hpsc 3 sc for single cut good the 

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:12.450
 obviously voice form reminds of 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.210
 thing 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.220
 so she's still a little bit more 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:21.109
 slim as his inspirational body in 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:25.259
 mahogany so with stomach cuts 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:28.710
 a tip a little more pointed we note 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:32.539
 still a beautiful 5-ply binding 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:37.800
 and then mahogany neck also 

00:00:32.539 --> 00:00:39.000
 glued with maple fingerboard 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.899
 oil bath 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:47.489
 here is maybe one with a small 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:49.769
 dark plating and then three microphones 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.949
 house and that's what's nice so 

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:55.890
 is that we find a config that has 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:58.890
 more guitarists like to fight 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.590
 or others or 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.280
 peter frampton for example so how 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.640
 it works 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:08.220
 there in the state we have that these two microphones there 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:11.159
 which therefore runs a configuration 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.119
 standard where we will see regulate both 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:16.950
 and then serious 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:20.729
 and then when you pull here the button 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:24.900
 tone 2 of the serious microphone 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:27.330
 well is started from the humbucker 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:30.030
 middle and he's active all the time 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:35.460
 so that's to say that we suddenly 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:38.520
 has both the three and the grave and the 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:41.070
 middle so we'll listen to that we start 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.340
 first in standard configuration are 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.340
 clear 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:55.910
 m 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.030
 and we move on to the 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:15.030
 configuration with the middle microphone 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.030
 activated 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.810
 but 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.540
 and 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.540
 1 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:49.560
 so we see that as soon as the microphone picks up 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:51.599
 is running well it's hard to have 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.209
 clear sounds they are immediately at 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:57.319
 these crunch so we go directly past 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:57.319
 in the crunch sounds 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.940
 and 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:14.850
 and 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.220
 I put the microphone back 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:32.349
 m 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.580
 and we will go to saturated sound 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:53.880
 and 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:43.470
 and 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:47.690
 the shot 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:26.590
 well we saw him as his inspirer is 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:31.230
 pivi hpsc 3 is made to send the 

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:31.230
 bourrier and on that I greet you well
