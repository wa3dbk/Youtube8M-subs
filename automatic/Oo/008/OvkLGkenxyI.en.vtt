00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:11.770
 Gandhi said that what you do in life will be insignificant 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:15.281
 but it is very important that you do it 

00:00:15.281 --> 00:00:17.350
 Agent, they were both trying to stop it 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:18.351
 Go home 

00:00:18.685 --> 00:00:19.190
 Do not! 

00:00:20.754 --> 00:00:22.220
 I tend to agree with the first part 

00:00:22.756 --> 00:00:25.692
 You could have it worse than having a father take you out of jail 

00:00:25.692 --> 00:00:27.360
 I do not want to be taken out of anything 

00:00:29.763 --> 00:00:33.990
 Why do you think dad does not want to spend time with me? 

00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:34.334
 She knows that I will take care of her 

00:00:34.401 --> 00:00:35.902
 That's what there is, Tyler 

00:00:35.902 --> 00:00:38.400
 That's what you get? Is not sufficient 

00:00:38.772 --> 00:00:39.673
 He broke the rules 

00:00:40.674 --> 00:00:42.275
 You know you can not smoke here 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:44.100
 Why do you have an ashtray? 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.110
 It's a bowl 

00:00:45.178 --> 00:00:46.179
 Complete the room 

00:00:46.346 --> 00:00:48.481
 I imagine he was here to tease me 

00:00:49.983 --> 00:00:51.351
 He had lost his way 

00:00:51.418 --> 00:00:53.620
 You've been a ghost these last two weeks, okay? 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:54.921
 You do not want to leave 

00:00:55.321 --> 00:00:56.690
 I've had enough of this introvert roll, okay? 

00:00:56.756 --> 00:00:58.758
 I'm ready to mount an intervention here 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.127
 Until... 

00:01:01.127 --> 00:01:02.529
 He has a daughter! 

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:03.463
 Who has a daughter? 

00:01:03.463 --> 00:01:04.798
 The cop that split your face 

00:01:04.798 --> 00:01:05.598
 Has a daughter 

00:01:05.598 --> 00:01:08.100
 I know her It's in my global policy class 

00:01:08.768 --> 00:01:09.135
 Go for it 

00:01:09.602 --> 00:01:11.971
 I do not go out with sociology students 

00:01:11.971 --> 00:01:13.907
 Fortunately for you I am undecided 

00:01:13.907 --> 00:01:14.808
 About what? 

00:01:14.808 --> 00:01:16.242
 Especially 

00:01:17.277 --> 00:01:18.111
 ... let someone enter 

00:01:18.111 --> 00:01:19.450
 What do they have for dessert? 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:20.347
 I take my dessert first 

00:01:22.816 --> 00:01:23.850
 What is that? 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.685
 This is our appetizer 

00:01:25.685 --> 00:01:29.155
 That's why you cheat the girls. They love this poetic bullshit 

00:01:29.155 --> 00:01:31.257
 Charles, it's your son 

00:01:31.257 --> 00:01:32.459
 Yes, I was wondering if you wanted to have dinner 

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:34.940
 How many? 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:35.280
 Three 

00:01:35.261 --> 00:01:37.564
 He can leave me planted, but not leave you planted 

00:01:39.699 --> 00:01:41.101
 You do not have to take care of anything 

00:01:41.101 --> 00:01:43.703
 You are not responsible for anyone. You are a kid 

00:01:45.505 --> 00:01:46.139
 I'm going out 

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:46.840
 Who are you going with? 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.641
 With a school boy 

00:01:48.641 --> 00:01:49.909
 You're pretty lost, right? 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:51.911
 He thinks he knows me, but no. 

00:01:52.912 --> 00:01:55.849
 My father does not know what is happening 

00:01:55.849 --> 00:01:57.170
 What's going on? 

00:02:13.333 --> 00:02:16.336
 Someone has been trying to tell me something 

00:02:17.537 --> 00:02:19.390
 Make it yours forever 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.740
 And I'm working on the part of "forever" 

00:02:22.876 --> 00:02:25.345
 Remember me
