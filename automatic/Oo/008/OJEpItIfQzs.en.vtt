00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830 
brownish pinkish color and I asked them

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:31.360 
brownish pinkish color and I asked them
I<00:04:28.190> wanted<00:04:28.820> like<00:04:29.000> a<00:04:29.350> bronzer<00:04:30.350> that<00:04:30.380> is<00:04:30.830> kind<00:04:31.280> of

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:33.600 
I wanted like a bronzer that is kind of
like<00:04:31.460> a<00:04:31.520> blush<00:04:31.910> and<00:04:32.240> they<00:04:32.450> gave<00:04:32.600> me<00:04:32.660> this<00:04:32.960> so<00:04:33.320> I

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400 
think it shows more in the light then

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.250 
think it shows more in the light then
during<00:04:37.580> the<00:04:37.790> night<00:04:37.970> so<00:04:38.000> I<00:04:38.270> usually<00:04:38.900> wear<00:04:39.080> it

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:39.260 
during the night so I usually wear it

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.970 
during the night so I usually wear it
when<00:04:39.470> I'm<00:04:39.560> at<00:04:39.710> school<00:04:39.890> or<00:04:40.850> during<00:04:41.210> the<00:04:41.390> daytime

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:41.980 
when I'm at school or during the daytime

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:45.430 
when I'm at school or during the daytime
