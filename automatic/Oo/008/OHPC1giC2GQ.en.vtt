00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:06.060
 How about guys that get impatient 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.519
 the weekend but good calm 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.950
 because before we bring you a series of 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.990
 news and technological news that 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.330
 we show you how every day on video 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.310
 having said that, let's see the program 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.939
 neurotic 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.740
 guys the future of windows 7 is dark 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.529
 the microsoft experiment to offer 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:28.410
 a finished system with no option to do 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.840
 of the tablets rm a real substitute 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.600
 of laptops like windows 8 pro is 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.010
 giving very poor results yet 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.100
 the other line they have chosen 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.440
 manufacturers like asus samsung do or the 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.170
 own microsoft including a series 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.420
 full version of windows 8 maybe yes 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.329
 that seems to be fitting in the market 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.610
 why do we say this because they leave it so 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.650
 see the results of a study carried 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.680
 out by the strategy analytics firm 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:58.680
 where it is reflected that windows 8 is already 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.170
 present in 75 percent of the 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.540
 tablets from around the world or what is it 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.869
 same in just over 3 million 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.869
 dispositives 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:11.350
 17 compared to 6 million 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:14.170
 Android tablet or almost 20 million 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:16.720
 from ipad to microsoft is missing a path 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:19.720
 for being a worthy rival to the competition 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:21.880
 but be careful because there are two aspects to 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:24.790
 keep in mind and they could give that 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.860
 push that microsoft needs in the first 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:29.530
 place to say that the maybe windows 8 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:32.110
 they have only been in the market for five months 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:34.509
 and that its availability starts to be 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.759
 now normal even more so since it 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:39.850
 will announce the arrival of the surface pro a 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:41.950
 europe and other continents the other great 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:44.380
 factor that could make windows go up 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.869
 8 as the foam is the arrival of 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:49.149
 smaller and cheaper tablets like 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:51.520
 for example the surface mini or 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:56.700
 dozens of devices that will come to 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:56.700
 Prices between 200 and 300 euros 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:03.110
 if a few days ago we talked about the 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.600
 possibility to see the technology of 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:08.600
 flexible oled screens in the coming 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.940
 galaxy note 3 from samsung is now the axis 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:13.640
 who confirms that will advance this new 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.170
 format for this year showing the 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.930
 that will be the first mobile phone 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.210
 commercial with flexible screen 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.850
 world 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:24.280
 he has been the vice president of the division 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:26.200
 of mobiles of lg who confirmed in a 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.640
 interview to the wall street journal that 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.250
 the manufacturer was working 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.290
 closely with lg display to be able 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.450
 show a mobile phone this year 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:37.960
 flexible finished and totally 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:39.910
 Commercial yes responsible shaft 

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:42.070
 made it clear that as in the prototypes 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.710
 shown by samsung not all the 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:46.510
 terminal would be flexible in some 

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:48.610
 elements like the battery and the 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.920
 circuitry would be integrated into a 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:53.080
 rigid module is to say that only the 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:56.020
 screen as such would have the ability 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:58.300
 to be flexible it is not uncommon to see 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:00.610
 statements so more when the axis 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:03.460
 showed and at the same time he announced his 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:06.220
 Curved screen oled televisions 

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:08.410
 which employ such technology is seen 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.570
 that the company is working hard to 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:13.180
 Lead this new smartphone format 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:15.730
 of which we can already imagine some 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:19.620
 interesting concepts like phones 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.620
 Rolling bracelets or tablet 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:26.070
 when we talk about smartphone and tablet 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:28.630
 we talk about almost infinite possibilities 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:31.390
 web browsing social networks games 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:33.250
 several applications but certainly one of 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:35.920
 the biggest tasks that are done since 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:39.400
 them and even from laptops is the 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:41.350
 consumption of photos and videos but of course the 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.960
 solutions to watch these videos in a 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:45.910
 larger screen happen to launch a 

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:47.830
 cable from the device in question 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:49.630
 until television have a screen 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:52.180
 connected and that is compatible with 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:54.160
 our device or opt for equipment 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:56.350
 that are only compatible with a 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:58.390
 determined cardwell you 'll see the case of 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:00.880
 apple tv well 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:02.740
 blair comes to change that this 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:05.200
 device that fits in the palm of a 

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:07.540
 hand connects to the hdmi output of 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:10.060
 any television independently 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:12.130
 if it has an internet connection or 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:14.620
 no and it allows us to see on that screen 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:18.010
 any video that we have in our 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:20.410
 devices wirelessly plate 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:22.990
 It is cross-platform , which indicates that 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:25.840
 have compatibility problems with a 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:27.669
 certain system or device 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.650
 If the hardware that contains a 

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:31.419
 connects to our local network and that 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:34.240
 thanks to an application that is installed 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:36.490
 on our portable tablet smartphone or 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:39.190
 desktop allows us to create a channel 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:40.990
 wireless between both sides of this 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:42.610
 way if we want to see a video of 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:45.100
 our laptop or smartphone in the 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:46.660
 television is only necessary to open the 

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:49.510
 application and ready 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:51.790
 by the way the price of plr is 99 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:58.810
 dollars and is already available in the 

00:04:51.790 --> 00:05:00.910
 main online stores as you will have 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:03.190
 could verify the market of the 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:05.350
 smartphones has gone from focusing the 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:07.830
 attention on the power or camera to 

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:10.060
 do it in the size of the screens 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:13.060
 currently the premium models of 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:15.250
 mobile manufacturers move from the 4.5 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:17.260
 inches coming to be considered 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:20.110
 as a new format to which the sector 

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:22.310
 has called fable half smartphone and 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:25.160
 half tablet 

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:27.230
 well, since we all hope to see 

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:29.270
 what happened to the apple with its next 

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:30.890
 iphone before the remarkable growth of 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:33.500
 the manufacturers that bet on the 

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:35.900
 droid 5 co-president of apple has 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:38.390
 publicly discarded that the format 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:40.120
 fablet be in the liquid for the next 

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:43.030
 Iphone 6 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:44.889
 that is cook tells us that his new 

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:47.710
 iphone will enter this trend 

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:50.350
 of the macro screens as it ensures 

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:52.540
 that would mean sacrificing elements 

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:55.120
 as the resolution the quality or the 

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:57.430
 compatibility of applications with 

00:05:55.120 --> 00:06:00.370
 these affirmations the top leader 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:02.229
 Apple completely cancels the rumors 

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:05.560
 that pointed to a new iphone of more 

00:06:02.229 --> 00:06:08.920
 4.5 inches that you think you think 

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:11.920
 hit apple with this decision 

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:14.140
 good friends up here our program 

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:16.270
 we finished the week but we returned the 

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:18.760
 Monday with more news with our 

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:21.190
 application programs and a lot much 

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:23.250
 more that you pass as not a good end of 

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:23.250
 week
