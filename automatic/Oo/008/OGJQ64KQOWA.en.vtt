00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 with the good that we have a sector with 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:07.770
 cats eye that these cats do not have the 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:14.690
 cut nails and they will scratch us a lot and 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:14.690
 It hurts and will make us allow in caresses 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:22.740
 back to back 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.740
 me chis 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.140
 yes but sometimes when you started them 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.140
 I was going to caress 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:42.780
 we are going to close well so that we do not have 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:42.780
 a disgrace 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:53.090
 Victor goalkeeper here can come 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:55.130
 anyone visiting obviously with a 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:58.370
 award called for a question that 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:01:00.530
 they need to be organized but can 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.080
 come anybody then for ideal for 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.300
 that the kids know what it is 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:06.980
 really a clear animal a sanctuary 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:10.820
 not a zoo where the animal is 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:13.610
 imprisoned subjected to carl of animals 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.390
 is rescued every animal has its 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.010
 history 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.590
 I'm not in everyone's stories but 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:21.110
 every animal had its life its history its 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:24.970
 past and that's why it ended here not from 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.970
 young children who left in boxes 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:31.830
 run over by their parents who died 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.690
 there is a super small tank once 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:35.759
 finite and this one loves this sense 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:39.409
 more likes the caresses and has this and 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.409
 the brother have some nails 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.940
 the 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.950
 it's more this one has the tongue out 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:52.000
 they like the caresses to the 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.000
 cats are addicted 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:56.800
 and well they are in this sector 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:02:00.550
 love to sunbathe 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:05.170
 40 30 40 45 all the sanctuaries of 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:05.170
 animals and in total counting everything 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:10.590
 but well you can not cut them 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.590
 nails so 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:15.220
 but they are all castrated 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:17.230
 cats 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:20.110
 and that is fundamental here is that between a 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:25.270
 animal castrates and even castrates 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:27.010
 the bulls are castrated the goats all by 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:29.590
 a matter obviously of maintaining a 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:34.410
 limit of reproduction but not 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:34.410
 they would overflow the down 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:42.250
 so if I do too but if you cut them 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:46.030
 I do 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:48.010
 and they are happy in their sector the 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:50.530
 cats 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:53.980
 The beautiful ones are sunbathing 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:56.530
 good sometimes when something is no roosters 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.870
 so they're not fighting and those 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:01.209
 now they are not but they are put here with 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.370
 the cats and if there are photos they get along 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:05.379
 they do not kill or fight, so you see the 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.450
 everyone watching with them with 

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:10.150
 roosters is very funny is to go against the 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:12.280
 nature a little and there we have a cat 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.959
 who cares for the guinea fowl 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.329
 live with them because sometimes you feel 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:18.189
 even among cats they get bad 

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:20.200
 then they like another sector there 

00:03:18.189 --> 00:03:23.730
 we have a rabbit with a cat 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.730
 other data guinea hens 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:32.400
 We can not but they are two options 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.349
 he likes caresses 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:45.489
 and you have an ojito hello 

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:54.549
 it seems 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:03.510
 so a little bit yours all animal by 

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:05.120
 sick 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:07.280
 Yes Yes 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:10.069
 it takes a lot of help from volunteers 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:11.810
 because being two people overflows to 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:13.430
 Sometimes an animal gets sick but there 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:14.750
 times you get sick ten suddenly there are 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.459
 to be running aside for the 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:19.340
 another then they are always welcome 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:21.949
 volunteers five seasons clear 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:23.960
 whether foreigners who want the 

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:26.389
 idea is to be able to put and finish a 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:29.479
 Quincho there is so they can come 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:31.790
 foreigners to stay and help because 

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:34.639
 here to do everything from them 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:37.990
 eating take care lift 

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:37.990
 excrement must be done
