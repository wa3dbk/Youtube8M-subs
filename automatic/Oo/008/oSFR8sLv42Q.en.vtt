00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.179
 caramba that's what explains us that it's the big difference between the 

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:30.220
 car from last year is effective 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:31.619
 Bernard Beaucourt 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.300
 roman could see last year it was an open car this 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:35.150
 year 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.680
 already we had to make a closed car he is obliged because 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.160
 in the hands of chives performing a car even the woman with a roof 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:43.310
 it is 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:47.030
 it's obligatory you have% between 5 and 10 kilometers apart 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.040
 it's a huge benefit to have a closed car for the theses of 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.530
 points that they so this year audi decided to make a closed car 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:54.480
 more 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.300
 for the first time driving right while in the past we had 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.590
 always a left flange 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.250
 for our reports and to homs 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:02.660
 first a closed car you have 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.560
 necessarily a problem of carros doors to make the pilot shaman 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.060
 it's a lot more complicated 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.010
 you also need to get used to the blue because on the right we do not see it 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.840
 very well 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.940
 you also have in case of rain 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:14.120
 visibility 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.400
 a little smaller a month ago m 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.110
 all this to gain top speed here at mincult to 13 kilometers 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:22.070
 avÃ© 6 km and TV rights 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.870
 segi who would have by cars that you like and that separates you that a 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:26.720
 open or closed car is 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.030
 a trial only 10th and a second round so you have to go through 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.860
 one day or another for closed cars and opt for this 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.860
 this regulation there after motor point of view 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.550
 this year we have a documentary in Asia if the hand 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:40.850
 in audio vo 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.170
 with a displacement of 3x6 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.240
 we also know that a new audi 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.760
 a more compact engine 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:50.120
 all this to try to reassure refocus the masses to the maximum 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.900
 outside of that was also a lot developed in the year 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.300
 to go we had a five-speed gearbox this year has to gear 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:57.450
 6-speed 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.960
 it is also new 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.140
 after the contest see it outside my car is completely different 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:03.200
 with the ump 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.540
 at 8 pm the design is very aggressive at the helm 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.120
 some scenes some women but a detail everything has been redesigned from a to 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.799
 z 

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:13.989
 so that's true my new car 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:15.200
 for our hours 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.590
 he had to develop a lot of weight is better eleven months of work since 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.369
 last year there will be two months to not say ana 

00:02:21.369 --> 00:02:24.189
 because there was a month we celebrated the victory more since we only did 

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:25.929
 work on his new car 

00:02:25.929 --> 00:02:29.359
 the club these jars develops in hand 

00:02:29.359 --> 00:02:32.419
 and up to the value of vancouver pretty much seen but the car is 

00:02:32.419 --> 00:02:33.509
 quick 

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:37.639
 normal bad and very reliable our runners will see I became 4 euros in a year
