sensor<00:00:17.840> it's<00:00:18.840> a<00:00:19.070> little<00:00:20.070> controversial

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
sensor it's a little controversial

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.609 
sensor it's a little controversial
sometimes<00:00:21.510> and<00:00:21.869> there's<00:00:22.020> a<00:00:22.080> bunch<00:00:22.529> of

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
sometimes and there's a bunch of

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.470 
sometimes and there's a bunch of
different<00:00:22.710> ways<00:00:23.039> of<00:00:23.279> doing<00:00:23.550> it<00:00:23.640> everyone<00:00:24.269> has

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
different ways of doing it everyone has

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.870 
different ways of doing it everyone has
their<00:00:24.630> own<00:00:24.689> opinion<00:00:24.750> I<00:00:25.380> certainly<00:00:26.279> have<00:00:26.550> mine

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
their own opinion I certainly have mine

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.080 
their own opinion I certainly have mine
and<00:00:27.180> I<00:00:28.019> think<00:00:28.740> mine<00:00:28.949> is<00:00:29.189> the<00:00:29.490> best<00:00:29.670> way<00:00:29.849> because

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
and I think mine is the best way because

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.410 
and I think mine is the best way because
it's<00:00:30.480> one<00:00:31.080> of<00:00:31.170> the<00:00:31.230> safer<00:00:31.710> ways<00:00:32.059> again<00:00:33.059> my

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
it's one of the safer ways again my

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.780 
it's one of the safer ways again my
opinion<00:00:33.870> not<00:00:34.559> knocking<00:00:35.100> companies<00:00:35.550> like

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
opinion not knocking companies like

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.420 
opinion not knocking companies like
Arctic<00:00:36.210> butterfly<00:00:36.870> or<00:00:37.260> some<00:00:37.829> of<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.010> swabs

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
Arctic butterfly or some of the swabs

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.119 
Arctic butterfly or some of the swabs
that<00:00:38.700> are<00:00:38.790> out<00:00:38.910> there<00:00:38.940> I<00:00:39.440> just<00:00:40.440> don't<00:00:40.739> like

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
that are out there I just don't like

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:46.160 
that are out there I just don't like
putting<00:00:41.670> liquids<00:00:42.660> on<00:00:42.899> my<00:00:43.890> sensor<00:00:44.899> when<00:00:45.899> you<00:00:46.020> go

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
putting liquids on my sensor when you go

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.830 
putting liquids on my sensor when you go
to<00:00:46.230> a<00:00:46.289> trade<00:00:46.620> show<00:00:46.649> and<00:00:47.219> if<00:00:48.149> someone<00:00:48.420> showing

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
to a trade show and if someone showing

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.979 
to a trade show and if someone showing
you<00:00:49.140> their<00:00:49.680> cleaning<00:00:50.100> product<00:00:50.760> and<00:00:51.000> it<00:00:51.629> says

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
you their cleaning product and it says

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.680 
you their cleaning product and it says
it<00:00:52.789> leaves<00:00:53.789> less<00:00:54.510> residue<00:00:55.199> than<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:55.920> others

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:56.690 
it leaves less residue than the others

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:58.970 
it leaves less residue than the others
that<00:00:57.690> just<00:00:57.930> means<00:00:58.050> it's<00:00:58.260> still<00:00:58.440> leaving<00:00:58.770> some

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
that just means it's still leaving some

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.799 
that just means it's still leaving some
residue<00:00:59.370> and<00:00:59.579> I<00:00:59.730> want<00:00:59.940> to<00:01:00.030> avoid<00:01:00.270> that<00:01:00.329> at<00:01:00.719> all

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
residue and I want to avoid that at all

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.100 
residue and I want to avoid that at all
costs<00:01:01.350> I<00:01:01.469> don't<00:01:01.770> want<00:01:02.070> anything<00:01:02.370> on<00:01:02.789> my<00:01:03.660> sensor

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
costs I don't want anything on my sensor

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.789 
costs I don't want anything on my sensor
so<00:01:04.379> I<00:01:04.409> use<00:01:04.890> a<00:01:04.920> dry<00:01:05.460> method<00:01:05.909> now<00:01:06.570> in<00:01:06.990> a<00:01:07.409> previous

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
so I use a dry method now in a previous

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.000 
so I use a dry method now in a previous
video<00:01:08.189> we<00:01:08.610> showed<00:01:08.820> you<00:01:08.939> how<00:01:09.060> to<00:01:09.090> clean<00:01:09.479> your

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:10.010 
video we showed you how to clean your

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.700 
video we showed you how to clean your
lens<00:01:11.010> with<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:12.060> lens<00:01:12.299> pen<00:01:12.600> well<00:01:13.380> these

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
lens with the lens pen well these

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.039 
lens with the lens pen well these
products<00:01:14.250> are<00:01:14.340> from<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:14.909> same<00:01:15.090> company<00:01:15.659> it's

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
products are from the same company it's

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.010 
products are from the same company it's
called<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.890> sensor<00:01:17.400> clear<00:01:17.729> so<00:01:18.540> there's<00:01:18.750> a

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
called the sensor clear so there's a

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.039 
called the sensor clear so there's a
sensor<00:01:19.500> clear<00:01:19.770> loop<00:01:20.070> that<00:01:20.520> will<00:01:20.549> use<00:01:21.020> have<00:01:22.020> a

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
sensor clear loop that will use have a

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.630 
sensor clear loop that will use have a
blower<00:01:22.530> and<00:01:23.210> we<00:01:24.210> have<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:25.080> sensor<00:01:25.590> pen<00:01:25.920> that

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
blower and we have the sensor pen that

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.420 
blower and we have the sensor pen that
will<00:01:26.790> use<00:01:27.259> maybe<00:01:28.259> maybe<00:01:28.770> we<00:01:29.009> won't<00:01:29.130> have<00:01:29.400> to

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
will use maybe maybe we won't have to

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.270 
will use maybe maybe we won't have to
but<00:01:30.240> we'll<00:01:30.630> get<00:01:30.780> started<00:01:31.079> so<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:31.920> first<00:01:32.189> thing

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
but we'll get started so the first thing

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.710 
but we'll get started so the first thing
we<00:01:32.820> need<00:01:32.909> to<00:01:33.000> do<00:01:33.150> is<00:01:33.420> remove<00:01:33.960> our<00:01:34.259> lens<00:01:35.720> now

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
we need to do is remove our lens now

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.340 
we need to do is remove our lens now
when<00:01:36.960> we<00:01:37.110> look<00:01:37.140> inside<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:38.610> camera<00:01:39.210> we're<00:01:40.049> not

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
when we look inside the camera we're not

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.620 
when we look inside the camera we're not
seeing<00:01:40.799> the<00:01:41.070> sensor<00:01:41.549> we're<00:01:41.909> seeing<00:01:42.270> the

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
seeing the sensor we're seeing the

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.109 
seeing the sensor we're seeing the
mirror<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.890> light<00:01:44.159> comes<00:01:44.490> into<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:44.820> camera

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
mirror the light comes into the camera

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.020 
mirror the light comes into the camera
hits<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.689> mirror<00:01:46.049> bounces<00:01:47.040> up<00:01:47.369> to<00:01:47.759> another

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
hits the mirror bounces up to another

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.819 
hits the mirror bounces up to another
mirror<00:01:48.420> at<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.750> top<00:01:49.049> and<00:01:49.320> through<00:01:49.680> the

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
mirror at the top and through the

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.639 
mirror at the top and through the
viewfinder<00:01:50.070> so<00:01:50.880> we're<00:01:51.090> not<00:01:51.119> seeing<00:01:51.930> the<00:01:52.350> lens

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
viewfinder so we're not seeing the lens

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.289 
viewfinder so we're not seeing the lens
right<00:01:53.040> are<00:01:53.220> the<00:01:53.340> sensor<00:01:53.700> right<00:01:53.850> here<00:01:53.909> we're

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
right are the sensor right here we're

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.420 
right are the sensor right here we're
just<00:01:54.509> seeing<00:01:54.659> a<00:01:54.810> mirror<00:01:55.170> but<00:01:55.680> often<00:01:55.979> times<00:01:56.009> the

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
just seeing a mirror but often times the

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.690 
just seeing a mirror but often times the
mayor<00:01:56.640> does<00:01:56.850> get<00:01:57.060> dust<00:01:57.299> on<00:01:57.540> it<00:01:57.570> it<00:01:58.140> will<00:01:58.259> just

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
mayor does get dust on it it will just

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.219 
mayor does get dust on it it will just
give<00:01:59.700> it<00:01:59.790> a<00:01:59.820> few<00:02:00.060> puffs<00:02:00.299> and<00:02:00.479> I'm<00:02:00.750> holding<00:02:01.140> the

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
give it a few puffs and I'm holding the

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.039 
give it a few puffs and I'm holding the
camera<00:02:01.560> facing<00:02:02.369> down<00:02:02.820> so<00:02:03.420> that<00:02:03.450> I<00:02:03.630> don't<00:02:03.780> get

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
camera facing down so that I don't get

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:09.109 
camera facing down so that I don't get
dust<00:02:04.590> settling<00:02:05.219> back<00:02:05.430> in<00:02:05.729> okay<00:02:07.550> so<00:02:08.550> the<00:02:08.910> mirror

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
dust settling back in okay so the mirror

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.559 
dust settling back in okay so the mirror
looks<00:02:09.330> pretty<00:02:09.629> good<00:02:09.810> right<00:02:09.869> there<00:02:11.180> now<00:02:12.180> I<00:02:12.209> need

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
looks pretty good right there now I need

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.330 
looks pretty good right there now I need
to<00:02:12.720> clean

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
to clean

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.640 
to clean
sensor<00:02:13.760> so<00:02:14.750> I'm<00:02:14.840> going<00:02:14.959> to<00:02:14.989> turn<00:02:15.140> the<00:02:15.290> camera

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
sensor so I'm going to turn the camera

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.470 
sensor so I'm going to turn the camera
on<00:02:17.170> this<00:02:18.170> is<00:02:18.319> a<00:02:18.349> canon<00:02:19.010> 7d<00:02:19.580> so<00:02:19.970> your<00:02:20.150> steps

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
where i want to be careful because i

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.770

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
dust off the sensor now while I still

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:27.069 
dust off the sensor now while I still
have<00:03:25.400> it<00:03:25.549> like<00:03:25.700> that<00:03:25.730> I'm<00:03:26.450> going<00:03:26.569> to<00:03:26.660> open<00:03:26.810> up

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:27.079 
have it like that I'm going to open up

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:31.059 
have it like that I'm going to open up
the<00:03:28.010> loop<00:03:29.200> I'm<00:03:30.200> going<00:03:30.380> to<00:03:30.440> put<00:03:30.709> it<00:03:30.799> upside<00:03:31.010> down

00:03:31.059 --> 00:03:31.069 
the loop I'm going to put it upside down

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:45.099 
the loop I'm going to put it upside down
here<00:03:31.400> for<00:03:31.549> a<00:03:31.579> moment<00:03:35.560> and<00:03:43.900> I'm<00:03:44.900> going<00:03:45.079> to

here for a moment and I'm going to

00:03:45.109 --> 00:03:49.569 
here for a moment and I'm going to
adjust<00:03:45.410> this<00:03:45.650> for<00:03:46.359> my<00:03:47.359> camera<00:03:47.680> and<00:03:48.680> I<00:03:49.280> will<00:03:49.430> put

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:49.579 
adjust this for my camera and I will put

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:51.610 
adjust this for my camera and I will put
this<00:03:49.730> right<00:03:50.000> over<00:03:50.209> the<00:03:50.450> lens<00:03:50.630> now<00:03:51.139> you<00:03:51.200> notice

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620 
this right over the lens now you notice

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:55.830 
this right over the lens now you notice
there's<00:03:52.130> a<00:03:52.400> little<00:03:52.940> opening<00:03:53.720> right<00:03:54.470> here

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 
there's a little opening right here

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.920 
there's a little opening right here
where<00:03:56.840> I<00:03:56.870> can<00:03:57.139> give<00:03:57.620> this<00:03:58.340> pen<00:03:58.760> now<00:03:59.569> this<00:03:59.690> pin

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 
where I can give this pen now this pin

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:04.629 
where I can give this pen now this pin
is<00:03:59.959> very<00:04:00.319> similar<00:04:00.709> to<00:04:01.099> the<00:04:02.030> lens<00:04:02.930> pen<00:04:03.260> but<00:04:04.160> the

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:04.639 
is very similar to the lens pen but the

00:04:04.639 --> 00:04:07.479 
is very similar to the lens pen but the
tip<00:04:04.910> on<00:04:05.090> this<00:04:05.329> is<00:04:05.540> very<00:04:06.200> small<00:04:06.560> it's<00:04:07.220> a<00:04:07.280> little

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:07.489 
tip on this is very small it's a little

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:10.690 
tip on this is very small it's a little
triangle<00:04:08.120> and<00:04:08.239> it<00:04:08.660> does<00:04:08.840> not<00:04:09.169> have<00:04:09.650> any<00:04:10.069> carbon

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:10.700 
triangle and it does not have any carbon

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:13.839 
triangle and it does not have any carbon
on<00:04:10.819> it<00:04:11.000> like<00:04:11.299> this<00:04:11.840> the<00:04:12.260> lens<00:04:12.500> pen<00:04:12.799> so<00:04:13.609> what<00:04:13.760> I'm

00:04:13.839 --> 00:04:13.849 
on it like this the lens pen so what I'm

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:16.170 
on it like this the lens pen so what I'm
going<00:04:13.940> to<00:04:14.030> do<00:04:14.239> while<00:04:14.900> I'm<00:04:15.049> looking<00:04:15.380> in<00:04:15.500> here

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
going to do while I'm looking in here

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:22.430 
you get the newest version of the sensor

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:24.790 
you get the newest version of the sensor
cleared<00:05:22.940> loop<00:05:23.300> because<00:05:23.870> it<00:05:24.380> will<00:05:24.620> actually

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:24.800 
cleared loop because it will actually

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:29.470 
cleared loop because it will actually
adjust<00:05:25.610> for<00:05:27.160> those<00:05:28.160> cameras<00:05:28.760> there's<00:05:29.390> a

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:29.480 
adjust for those cameras there's a

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:31.870 
adjust for those cameras there's a
little<00:05:29.660> arrow<00:05:30.070> on<00:05:31.070> here<00:05:31.280> that<00:05:31.310> says<00:05:31.580> four

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:31.880 
little arrow on here that says four

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:33.700 
little arrow on here that says four
thirds<00:05:32.240> and<00:05:32.480> that's<00:05:32.630> the<00:05:32.720> same<00:05:32.900> formulas<00:05:33.530> and

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:33.710 
thirds and that's the same formulas and

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:36.730 
thirds and that's the same formulas and
so<00:05:34.280> I<00:05:34.340> just<00:05:34.520> adjust<00:05:34.970> this<00:05:35.210> for<00:05:35.740> those

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:36.740 
so I just adjust this for those

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:39.640 
so I just adjust this for those
particular<00:05:37.510> cameras<00:05:38.510> to<00:05:38.990> make<00:05:39.170> sure<00:05:39.410> that<00:05:39.620> I

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:39.650 
particular cameras to make sure that I

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:44.350

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:44.360 
can get a good focus on the lens or I
