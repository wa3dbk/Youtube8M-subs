00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:23.269 

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:28.810 

as<00:00:24.269> far<00:00:24.480> as<00:00:24.600> that<00:00:24.750> goes<00:00:24.810> i<00:00:25.410> hope<00:00:25.740> that's<00:00:25.980> okay

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:28.820 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.700 

didn't<00:00:29.820> realize<00:00:29.970> it's<00:00:30.449> so<00:00:30.660> shallow<00:00:30.990> as<00:00:31.349> far<00:00:31.619> as

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
didn't realize it's so shallow as far as

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.130 
didn't realize it's so shallow as far as
that<00:00:31.859> goes<00:00:31.920> let's<00:00:32.430> see<00:00:34.280> should<00:00:35.280> be<00:00:35.670> right<00:00:36.030> here

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:36.140 
that goes let's see should be right here

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:43.270 
that goes let's see should be right here
maybe<00:00:37.140> I<00:00:37.469> think<00:00:39.050> so<00:00:40.050> i'm<00:00:40.500> thinking<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:41.329> ps2

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:43.280 
maybe I think so i'm thinking the ps2

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.690 
maybe I think so i'm thinking the ps2
series<00:00:44.280> stuff<00:00:45.110> as<00:00:46.110> far<00:00:46.379> as<00:00:46.410> shooters<00:00:46.800> go<00:00:47.039> it's

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:42.890 
stuff how to connect I think I got that
down<00:03:39.079> anything<00:03:40.079> else<00:03:40.260> I<00:03:41.569> really<00:03:42.569> hope<00:03:42.720> this

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
down anything else I really hope this

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.360 
down anything else I really hope this
does<00:03:43.169> not<00:03:43.290> interfere<00:03:43.590> with<00:03:43.919> the<00:03:44.040> HD<00:03:44.340> PVR

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
does not interfere with the HD PVR

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.089 
does not interfere with the HD PVR
otherwise<00:03:45.180> I'll<00:03:45.480> be<00:03:45.540> rather<00:03:45.840> depressed<00:03:46.349> and

00:03:47.089 --> 00:03:47.099 
otherwise I'll be rather depressed and

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:48.890 
otherwise I'll be rather depressed and
it's<00:03:47.280> still<00:03:47.459> on<00:03:47.669> the<00:03:47.760> plastic<00:03:48.239> well<00:03:48.419> kind<00:03:48.660> of<00:03:48.780> I

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
it's still on the plastic well kind of I

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:54.339 
it's still on the plastic well kind of I
think<00:03:48.930> this<00:03:49.260> is<00:03:49.470> new<00:03:49.650> use<00:03:51.680> let's

00:03:54.339 --> 00:03:54.349 
think this is new use let's

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:59.599 
think this is new use let's
i'm<00:03:55.349> rather<00:03:55.590> excited<00:03:55.859> about<00:03:56.489> that<00:03:58.280> it<00:03:59.280> doesn't

00:03:59.599 --> 00:03:59.609 
i'm rather excited about that it doesn't

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:01.160 
i'm rather excited about that it doesn't
seem<00:03:59.790> like<00:03:59.969> it's<00:04:00.120> all<00:04:00.239> worn<00:04:00.510> out<00:04:00.629> I<00:04:00.900> think

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
seem like it's all worn out I think

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:03.050 
seem like it's all worn out I think
