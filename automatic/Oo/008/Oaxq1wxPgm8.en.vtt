unique features here is the rotating
disc<00:00:54.649> now<00:00:55.160> best<00:00:56.030> to<00:00:56.270> my<00:00:56.480> knowledge<00:00:56.780> I<00:00:57.850> could

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850 
disc now best to my knowledge I could

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.889 
disc now best to my knowledge I could
see<00:00:59.059> if<00:00:59.180> I<00:00:59.329> give<00:00:59.540> you<00:00:59.660> a<00:00:59.690> look<00:00:59.899> at<00:01:00.020> it<00:01:00.200> there

00:01:01.889 --> 00:01:01.899 
see if I give you a look at it there

see if I give you a look at it there
this<00:01:02.899> is<00:01:03.200> just<00:01:03.500> a<00:01:03.710> plastic<00:01:04.009> disc<00:01:05.890> that<00:01:06.890> is

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 
this is just a plastic disc that is

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.679 
this is just a plastic disc that is
clear<00:01:07.880> and<00:01:08.060> painted<00:01:08.750> with<00:01:08.780> the<00:01:09.140> grey<00:01:10.689> blades

if<00:01:12.229> you<00:01:12.560> will<00:01:13.689> but<00:01:14.689> when<00:01:14.929> you<00:01:15.079> view<00:01:15.319> it<00:01:15.380> this

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770 
if you will but when you view it this

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.789 
if you will but when you view it this
way<00:01:16.600> it<00:01:17.600> kind<00:01:17.959> of<00:01:18.109> gives<00:01:18.350> you<00:01:18.530> the<00:01:18.679> impression

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:18.799 
way it kind of gives you the impression

way it kind of gives you the impression
of<00:01:19.340> the<00:01:19.490> actual<00:01:19.819> blades<00:01:20.090> going<00:01:20.359> around<00:01:20.659> now

00:01:21.309 --> 00:01:21.319 
of the actual blades going around now

00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:24.849 
of the actual blades going around now
those<00:01:21.859> are<00:01:22.189> actually<00:01:22.880> your<00:01:23.240> seconds<00:01:23.990> that<00:01:24.529> is

00:01:24.849 --> 00:01:24.859 
those are actually your seconds that is

those are actually your seconds that is
counting<00:01:25.399> the<00:01:25.729> seconds<00:01:26.179> through<00:01:26.450> working

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
counting the seconds through working

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:33.910 
counting the seconds through working
with<00:01:27.759> the<00:01:28.759> movement<00:01:32.350> give<00:01:33.350> you<00:01:33.469> a<00:01:33.560> good<00:01:33.770> look

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
with the movement give you a good look

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.340 
with the movement give you a good look
at<00:01:34.100> the<00:01:34.189> case<00:01:34.429> here<00:01:34.759> as<00:01:35.600> you<00:01:35.719> can<00:01:35.779> see<00:01:35.899> it's

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:56.579 
it's you know it's not five six hundred

00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:59.630 
it's you know it's not five six hundred

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
it now you could see in the chapter ring

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.599 
it now you could see in the chapter ring
you<00:03:06.959> got<00:03:07.170> the<00:03:07.379> cutout<00:03:07.769> holes<00:03:08.099> which<00:03:08.489> are

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:08.609 
you got the cutout holes which are

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:13.280 
you got the cutout holes which are
actually<00:03:09.180> the<00:03:09.510> hour<00:03:09.780> markers<00:03:11.690> you<00:03:12.690> do<00:03:12.959> have<00:03:13.260> a

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:05.549 
and especially in a United yeah nice

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:11.000

unique machined case such as this

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:14.070 
unique machined case such as this
it<00:04:12.010> is<00:04:12.310> not<00:04:12.640> a<00:04:12.910> screw<00:04:13.209> down<00:04:13.360> crown<00:04:13.660> it<00:04:13.900> is<00:04:14.050> a

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:14.080 
it is not a screw down crown it is a

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:18.180 
it is not a screw down crown it is a
push-pull<00:04:14.769> crown<00:04:15.930> okay<00:04:16.930> and<00:04:17.410> as<00:04:17.620> you<00:04:17.799> can<00:04:17.950> see

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.190 
push-pull crown okay and as you can see

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:23.340 
push-pull crown okay and as you can see
because<00:04:18.430> this<00:04:18.910> is<00:04:19.120> the<00:04:19.269> Miata<00:04:19.540> 8<00:04:19.810> to<00:04:20.049> 15<00:04:21.870> it<00:04:22.870> is

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:23.350 
because this is the Miata 8 to 15 it is

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:36.929 
because this is the Miata 8 to 15 it is
non<00:04:23.740> hacking

00:04:36.929 --> 00:04:36.939 

00:04:36.939 --> 00:04:40.570 

let<00:04:37.939> me<00:04:38.060> give<00:04:38.210> you<00:04:38.330> a<00:04:38.360> look<00:04:38.900> at<00:04:39.229> it<00:04:39.409> on<00:04:39.499> my<00:04:39.590> seven

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:40.580 
let me give you a look at it on my seven

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:54.720 
let me give you a look at it on my seven
and<00:04:40.729> a<00:04:40.789> half<00:04:40.819> inch<00:04:41.330> wrist

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:54.730 

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:57.870 

there's<00:04:55.270> a<00:04:55.450> good<00:04:55.600> look<00:04:55.810> on<00:04:55.990> my<00:04:56.170> wrist<00:04:56.670> as<00:04:57.670> I

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:57.880 
there's a good look on my wrist as I

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.900 
there's a good look on my wrist as I
said<00:04:58.120> it<00:04:58.330> is<00:04:58.510> about<00:04:59.070> 50<00:05:00.070> millimetres<00:05:00.520> lug<00:05:00.760> to

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:00.910 
said it is about 50 millimetres lug to

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:02.580 
said it is about 50 millimetres lug to
lug<00:05:01.090> I<00:05:01.270> have<00:05:01.420> it<00:05:01.510> a<00:05:01.570> little<00:05:01.690> loose<00:05:01.990> on<00:05:02.230> my<00:05:02.350> wrist

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:02.590 
lug I have it a little loose on my wrist

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:05.700 
lug I have it a little loose on my wrist
here<00:05:02.860> but<00:05:03.850> it<00:05:03.970> does<00:05:04.120> fit<00:05:04.390> pretty<00:05:04.420> nicely<00:05:04.750> those

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:05.710 
here but it does fit pretty nicely those

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:09.090 
here but it does fit pretty nicely those
lugs<00:05:06.480> curved<00:05:07.480> downward<00:05:08.050> from<00:05:08.560> that<00:05:08.740> nice

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:09.100 
lugs curved downward from that nice

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:17.490 
lugs curved downward from that nice
round<00:05:09.460> case<00:05:14.790> the<00:05:15.790> leather<00:05:16.330> strap<00:05:16.720> is<00:05:16.960> very

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:17.500 
round case the leather strap is very

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:23.820 
round case the leather strap is very
very<00:05:17.800> very<00:05:18.040> soft<00:05:18.400> and<00:05:18.870> very<00:05:19.870> comfortable<00:05:22.830> so

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:23.830 
very very soft and very comfortable so

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:27.240 
very very soft and very comfortable so
you<00:05:23.920> should<00:05:24.190> have<00:05:24.310> no<00:05:24.490> issues<00:05:24.850> with<00:05:25.060> that<00:05:26.250> the

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:27.250 
you should have no issues with that the

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:30.030 
you should have no issues with that the
bottom<00:05:27.580> line<00:05:27.760> here<00:05:28.120> is<00:05:28.150> a<00:05:28.330> yep<00:05:29.050> it's<00:05:29.320> maybe<00:05:29.950> a

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:30.040 
bottom line here is a yep it's maybe a

bottom line here is a yep it's maybe a

little fashion forward and possibly a

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:36.450 
little fashion forward and possibly a
little<00:05:33.670> impractical<00:05:34.180> and<00:05:34.870> maybe<00:05:35.860> a<00:05:36.010> little

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:36.460 
little impractical and maybe a little

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:38.970 
little impractical and maybe a little
bit<00:05:36.730> gimmicky<00:05:37.350> but<00:05:38.350> I<00:05:38.380> think<00:05:38.710> it's<00:05:38.830> pretty

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:38.980 
bit gimmicky but I think it's pretty

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:41.880 
bit gimmicky but I think it's pretty
cool<00:05:39.280> and<00:05:39.610> I<00:05:39.790> think<00:05:40.120> the<00:05:40.330> price<00:05:40.780> point<00:05:41.230> is<00:05:41.440> on

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:41.890 
cool and I think the price point is on

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:44.550 
cool and I think the price point is on
target<00:05:42.720> so<00:05:43.720> if<00:05:43.900> you're<00:05:44.020> looking<00:05:44.200> for

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:44.560 
target so if you're looking for

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:47.700 
target so if you're looking for
something<00:05:44.980> a<00:05:45.130> little<00:05:45.550> fun<00:05:45.880> and<00:05:46.180> unique<00:05:46.710> this

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:47.710 
something a little fun and unique this
