00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:17.290
 here 

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:17.290
 in my mind 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:20.789
 Your suitcase 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.099
 the boy 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:41.780
 everywhere 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.780
 my mind 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.989
 I like reggae and that a song 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.120
 spectacular very different from what 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:54.340
 we have been doing the 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.660
 merengue tropical urban this is the 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:58.120
 first song that comes out a bit more 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:00.910
 of this rhythm of this comfort zone 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.290
 as we can say and I think it is 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:05.440
 pretty cool because it's the first 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:08.500
 song that or the second we see in 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:10.180
 spanglish we do and for the market 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.619
 Latin in the United States as it is 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.240
 important also that we can give you a 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:14.830
 little food to that market 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.800
 spanglish and that sometimes does not understand 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:20.740
 a lot of things in Spanish 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.899
 we do not have intentions and therefore to 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.009
 medium term to make a crossover 

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:25.960
 we feel that we still have to grow 

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:27.490
 very much to the Latin market but this 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.470
 a song to have fun a song 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:32.140
 to have a good time to also 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:34.899
 satisfy that musical need of 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.520
 We not only do what 

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:38.229
 market also like it but also 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.400
 enjoy a little something that we 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:43.710
 we are fanatics like the king 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.930
 really a very special song already 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.420
 that this was liked by all his team 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:51.300
 work to us we love feel 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.380
 that a song that then potentially 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.480
 it could be at some point a 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.830
 promotional but for the radio so 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:57.540
 least to make a video clip and that the 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.820
 people can enjoy this song 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:03.770
 what we love so much is called me baby 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.770
 It is also part of this meeting verse
