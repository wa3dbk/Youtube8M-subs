00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.889
 Hi, how are you, I'm Antonio Montalbán 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.410
 how do you know how to achieve good development 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.480
 of the shoulders is essential 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.000
 who does not want to achieve good ones 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.100
 shoulders so in the video of the day of 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.779
 today I'm going to teach you an exercise that 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.540
 will help develop your shoulders 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:28.289
 sideways so you get that 

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:30.510
 populated form the sides well I 'm 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.230
 referring to exercise elevations 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.230
 lateral 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.890
 if you have been following my videos for a while 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:43.280
 then you have already seen me performing 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:46.340
 this exercise but today what 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:48.440
 let's try much deeper and 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.510
 I'll also teach you a technique that 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:53.750
 will benefit you greatly in the 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:56.269
 Musculatures of your lateral shoulders in 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.620
 First, the fact that you can do 

00:00:56.269 --> 00:00:59.420
 our lifting exercises 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.750
 lateral that does not mean 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:05.540
 necessarily that your lateral shoulders 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:08.390
 they are working but how could you 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:11.810
 I explain to you when all these exercises 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.380
 of the lateral hernán that happen well 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:17.520
 look 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:20.969
 gravity like this has vertical like this 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:25.259
 obviously then you, brando, are 

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:28.110
 so are the sides sideways 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.289
 the fat that's here but look at donation the 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.420
 focus 

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:35.270
 forward nothing to do with your shoulders 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:37.789
 lateral you understand that generally 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.350
 happens when you put a lot of weight in 

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:43.399
 this exercise 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:47.080
 that is, they do like that and that is seen every time 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:50.290
 in the gym, count yourself again 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:52.030
 here is here in gravity here is the 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:54.460
 attention that these occur in the muscle 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.460
 what happens in the muscle and where is it 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:59.880
 that 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:04.800
 forward ok nothing to see how many are the 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:07.470
 laterals then it is very important in 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:11.030
 First we will submit 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:13.400
 why sitting and why not standing 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.770
 in if there is no extra benefit in 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.990
 your shoulders in doing it sitting upright 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:21.380
 because the movement is the same but the 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:23.930
 advantage that is in doing it sitting down is that 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:26.330
 will give you less less chance to do 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:29.120
 ie trap 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.710
 you're going to be there and you're going to start doing 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:34.660
 exercise 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:37.970
 again as I was telling you if you feel 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:40.010
 that you were in this movement I already know by 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.410
 what are you doing with a very heavy 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:45.920
 exaggerated or because it simply is not 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:47.710
 correctly the exercise then another 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:51.280
 thing like that 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:52.870
 keep in mind that your side eyes do not 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.220
 they are at work you are not 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.620
 benefiting absolutely nothing 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.300
 then there you are going to say I put you 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:01.570
 then with trace my shoulders 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:03.880
 laterals do not take that shape is like 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:06.220
 Blair well the sides is a very point 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:08.280
 important of the account then 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.800
 when you do 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:14.120
 you can practice like this first look 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.120
 side grandchildren 

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:21.040
 that your side eyes are there 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.040
 if you feel they are there 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:27.670
 because they are the sides that are laughing 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:30.099
 ok there has to be very important 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:34.650
 this is also why it is fundamental 

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:34.650
 to start with your elbows 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:41.750
 so you do not 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:43.390
 that's the point of doing that there 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:46.010
 the whole focus be for us 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:49.210
 front and us shoulders 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.210
 side to see 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.959
 let us begin 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:02.989
 this is the correct execution of this 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:02.989
 exercise 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:13.110
 a technique to benefit you much more 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:16.600
 of this exercise is the following 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:19.780
 note that in the initial part of the 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:22.270
 movement here there is no tension 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:26.080
 that if these other laterals you can not 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:29.140
 be with points as there is but reality 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:33.840
 there is no address where it starts to 

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:37.000
 say the work from here to here 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:39.670
 that's why 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.190
 this one I had to teach you is for 

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:44.770
 work with the shoulders apart from 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:49.180
 body not here because there is practically 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:51.520
 you are resting then there and 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:56.129
 to the top 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:56.129
 not here until the horizontal 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:13.150
 He said 

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:15.160
 and how to get to your body 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:17.680
 or 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:20.950
 a way also to make sure that 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:23.260
 your lateral shoulders are working or 

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:25.180
 be so that we are not lateral be 

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:28.090
 always pointing skyward ie 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:31.700
 there it is 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:35.390
 lean a little forward using 

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:37.610
 do it and because after 

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:40.360
 you can do this movement in the 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:42.900
 body power each 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:47.339
 as lateral 

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:47.339
 it's a little bit 

00:05:48.839 --> 00:05:54.020
 somewhat 

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:57.710
 Oh 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:06:00.980
 make sure you bought lateral be 

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:00.980
 pointing up 

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:09.370
 you will also not be dead 

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:17.529
 with the land of friendship 

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:19.920
 in constant division 

00:06:17.529 --> 00:06:23.610
 so to correctly 

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:27.270
 he also spoke slow remember it's not a 

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:31.960
 race I do not know sometimes doing 

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:35.510
 that way of training anything proper nothing 

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:38.690
 optimal for your muscles 

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:40.409
 there focus on feeling your eyes 

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:41.879
 lateral 

00:06:40.409 --> 00:06:43.800
 and always keep in mind all 

00:06:41.879 --> 00:06:46.649
 tips that I have given you in this video 

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:49.679
 well you'll have excellent 

00:06:46.649 --> 00:06:51.539
 results on your lateral shoulders if 

00:06:49.679 --> 00:06:53.399
 you want me personally from advisors 

00:06:51.539 --> 00:06:55.949
 in your workouts routines like 

00:06:53.399 --> 00:06:57.659
 you must feed yourself among other things to 

00:06:55.949 --> 00:07:00.749
 that you achieve the body that is so 

00:06:57.659 --> 00:07:01.529
 wanting just click on the one in 

00:07:00.749 --> 00:07:03.749
