here<00:00:37.680> we<00:00:37.800> have<00:00:37.980> one<00:00:38.219> from<00:00:38.460> Samsung<00:00:38.700> that

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
here we have one from Samsung that

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.850 
here we have one from Samsung that
actually<00:00:39.390> bends<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:39.870> rules<00:00:39.899> just<00:00:40.440> a<00:00:40.590> little

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
actually bends the rules just a little

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.440 
actually bends the rules just a little
bit<00:00:41.010> compared<00:00:41.430> to<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:41.670> other<00:00:41.790> ultrabooks<00:00:42.090> out

there the samsung series 5 ultrabook is
something<00:00:46.170> that<00:00:46.260> comes<00:00:46.590> out<00:00:46.829> in<00:00:47.010> gunmetal

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
something that comes out in gunmetal

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.220 
something that comes out in gunmetal
grey<00:00:47.820> color<00:00:48.090> that<00:00:48.300> looks<00:00:48.420> pretty<00:00:48.629> good<00:00:48.780> it's

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
grey color that looks pretty good it's

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.229 
grey color that looks pretty good it's
pretty<00:00:49.469> solid<00:00:49.710> it's<00:00:50.460> not<00:00:50.640> made<00:00:50.820> from<00:00:50.910> a<00:00:51.059> single

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
pretty solid it's not made from a single

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:52.670 
pretty solid it's not made from a single
piece<00:00:51.510> of<00:00:51.719> steel<00:00:51.930> like<00:00:52.199> some<00:00:52.410> of<00:00:52.530> its

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
piece of steel like some of its

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.430 
piece of steel like some of its
competitors<00:00:52.980> but<00:00:53.850> it<00:00:54.090> does<00:00:54.360> feel<00:00:54.390> very<00:00:54.690> solid

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
competitors but it does feel very solid

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.350 
competitors but it does feel very solid
it's<00:00:55.770> not<00:00:55.860> almost<00:00:56.219> no<00:00:56.340> flakes<00:00:56.699> or<00:00:56.940> creeks<00:00:57.210> in

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
it's not almost no flakes or creeks in

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.810 
it's not almost no flakes or creeks in
the<00:00:57.480> case<00:00:57.719> and<00:00:58.020> when<00:00:58.920> you<00:00:59.010> open<00:00:59.340> and<00:00:59.460> close<00:00:59.489> the

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
the case and when you open and close the

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.939 
the case and when you open and close the
device<00:01:00.149> there's<00:01:00.719> actually<00:01:01.199> quite<00:01:01.410> a<00:01:01.770> nice

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
device there's actually quite a nice

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.359 
device there's actually quite a nice
funk<00:01:02.850> to<00:01:03.059> it<00:01:03.090> on<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:04.439> inside<00:01:04.589> you'll<00:01:05.040> find<00:01:05.100> a

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
funk to it on the inside you'll find a

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.210 
funk to it on the inside you'll find a
core<00:01:05.580> i5<00:01:05.729> processor<00:01:06.689> and<00:01:06.869> also<00:01:07.740> something

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
core i5 processor and also something

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.310 
core i5 processor and also something
that's<00:01:08.490> unique<00:01:08.700> to<00:01:08.909> an<00:01:09.270> ultrabook<00:01:09.630> machine<00:01:10.140> a

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
that's unique to an ultrabook machine a

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.590 
that's unique to an ultrabook machine a
hardest<00:01:11.100> drive<00:01:11.340> now<00:01:11.820> you<00:01:11.880> might<00:01:12.240> argue<00:01:12.570> that

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
hardest drive now you might argue that

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.210 
hardest drive now you might argue that
actually<00:01:13.080> slows<00:01:13.290> down<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.680> machine<00:01:13.950> quite<00:01:14.189> a

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
actually slows down the machine quite a

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.850 
actually slows down the machine quite a
bit<00:01:14.460> but<00:01:15.049> Samsung<00:01:16.049> is<00:01:16.170> actually<00:01:16.439> quite<00:01:16.560> smart

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
bit but Samsung is actually quite smart

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.920 
bit but Samsung is actually quite smart
about<00:01:17.159> it<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.670> typical<00:01:17.880> ultrabook<00:01:18.540> standard

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
about it the typical ultrabook standard

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.870 
about it the typical ultrabook standard
normally<00:01:19.560> focuses<00:01:20.009> on<00:01:20.100> solid-state<00:01:20.520> storage

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
normally focuses on solid-state storage

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.910 
normally focuses on solid-state storage
which<00:01:21.570> is<00:01:21.600> great<00:01:21.990> but<00:01:22.259> typically<00:01:22.650> that

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
which is great but typically that

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.789 
which is great but typically that
requires<00:01:23.880> a<00:01:24.000> machine<00:01:24.360> that<00:01:24.869> only<00:01:24.900> has<00:01:25.229> 64

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
requires a machine that only has 64

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.070 
requires a machine that only has 64
gigabytes<00:01:26.250> of<00:01:26.400> storage<00:01:26.520> or<00:01:26.880> 128<00:01:27.509> or<00:01:27.540> 256

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
gigabytes of storage or 128 or 256

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.160 
gigabytes of storage or 128 or 256
kilobytes<00:01:28.590> which<00:01:29.130> is<00:01:29.670> not<00:01:29.850> a<00:01:30.090> lot<00:01:30.659> if<00:01:30.900> you<00:01:31.049> have

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
kilobytes which is not a lot if you have

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.740 
kilobytes which is not a lot if you have
say<00:01:31.380> a<00:01:31.619> lot<00:01:31.770> of<00:01:31.920> music<00:01:32.310> or<00:01:32.490> a<00:01:32.579> lot<00:01:32.729> of<00:01:32.820> movies<00:01:33.180> so

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
say a lot of music or a lot of movies so

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.870 
say a lot of music or a lot of movies so
what<00:01:34.170> makes<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.560> samsung<00:01:34.950> series<00:01:35.280> 5<00:01:35.310> unique

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
what makes the samsung series 5 unique

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.210 
what makes the samsung series 5 unique
is<00:01:36.060> that<00:01:36.630> it<00:01:36.900> has<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.350> solid-state<00:01:38.040> storage

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
is that it has the solid-state storage

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.800 
is that it has the solid-state storage
which<00:01:38.759> are<00:01:38.939> small<00:01:39.150> only<00:01:39.509> twenty<00:01:39.780> four

machine compared to other ultrabooks is

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
that it is quite upgradable so you can

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.170 
that it is quite upgradable so you can
flip<00:02:54.770> this<00:02:54.920> little<00:02:55.040> panel<00:02:55.489> open<00:02:55.790> on<00:02:55.910> the<00:02:56.000> back

flip this little panel open on the back

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.180 
flip this little panel open on the back
and<00:02:56.390> you<00:02:56.450> can<00:02:56.690> swap<00:02:57.110> out<00:02:57.410> the<00:02:57.620> harder<00:02:57.920> scribe

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:03.340 
off-the-shelf pots it's things like this
that<00:03:02.060> makes<00:03:02.390> the<00:03:02.540> machine<00:03:02.810> quite<00:03:03.050> unique

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350 
that makes the machine quite unique

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:04.900 
that makes the machine quite unique
compared<00:03:03.800> to<00:03:03.830> something<00:03:04.130> like<00:03:04.250> the<00:03:04.550> macbook

of this machine one of the things we do

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:32.620 
of this machine one of the things we do
like<00:03:31.400> about<00:03:31.549> the<00:03:31.760> machine<00:03:32.060> is<00:03:32.180> the<00:03:32.299> battery

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.630 
like about the machine is the battery

like about the machine is the battery
life<00:03:32.660> we<00:03:33.500> easily<00:03:33.709> got<00:03:34.010> six<00:03:34.310> hours<00:03:34.459> out<00:03:34.820> of<00:03:34.940> this

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
life we easily got six hours out of this

spending a whole drive in there and we

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:40.870 
spending a whole drive in there and we
really<00:03:38.959> didn't<00:03:39.260> expect<00:03:39.530> that<00:03:39.760> the<00:03:40.760> other

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:40.880 
really didn't expect that the other

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:42.280 
really didn't expect that the other
thing<00:03:41.090> we're<00:03:41.209> not<00:03:41.269> crazy<00:03:41.480> about<00:03:41.690> is<00:03:41.930> the<00:03:42.049> price

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.290 
thing we're not crazy about is the price

at<00:03:42.920> 12,000<00:03:43.519> ran<00:03:43.670> it<00:03:43.820> actually<00:03:44.090> competes<00:03:44.450> quite

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:44.660 
at 12,000 ran it actually competes quite

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:46.270 
at 12,000 ran it actually competes quite
well<00:03:44.900> with<00:03:45.110> something<00:03:45.470> like<00:03:45.590> the<00:03:45.709> macbook<00:03:46.070> air

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
well with something like the macbook air

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:47.830 
well with something like the macbook air
but<00:03:46.940> if<00:03:47.030> you<00:03:47.120> actually<00:03:47.269> go<00:03:47.420> look<00:03:47.630> at<00:03:47.750> the

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 
but if you actually go look at the

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.080 
but if you actually go look at the
pricing<00:03:48.230> overseas<00:03:48.680> it<00:03:49.190> comes<00:03:49.700> in<00:03:49.820> at<00:03:49.910> nine

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090

hundred dollars in the u.s. that makes

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:53.770 
hundred dollars in the u.s. that makes
us<00:03:52.130> think<00:03:52.310> that<00:03:52.519> Samsung<00:03:52.970> was<00:03:53.090> actually<00:03:53.480> quite

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
us think that Samsung was actually quite

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:55.449 
us think that Samsung was actually quite
smart<00:03:54.110> about<00:03:54.350> the<00:03:54.500> pricing<00:03:54.980> in<00:03:55.190> other

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:55.459 
smart about the pricing in other

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:57.130 
smart about the pricing in other
countries<00:03:55.910> but<00:03:56.299> not<00:03:56.510> so<00:03:56.660> much<00:03:56.780> in<00:03:56.840> South
