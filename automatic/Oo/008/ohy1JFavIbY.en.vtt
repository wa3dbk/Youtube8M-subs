00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 I have some time for the change 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.790
 Again we made money 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.620
 news bad news for 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.240
 all there wonder where we already at yellow 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.130
 The Bavarians have it again 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.290
 That's not great 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.000
 But somebody does not have much to do 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.580
 news here would of course 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.320
 with each other our fraps or 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.210
 our courses with different people 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.830
 see news with star and 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.560
 I get settings here via the 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.960
 create three points and new message 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.820
 so the window looks like this up here 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.279
 I'll give the best one to contact 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.989
 or the numeral if I have something like no 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.510
 of course, I see my contacts 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.540
 and I can then directly with them 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.550
 lays out claus to get any night 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.410
 he was evil so we write 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.210
 Just something here we can do something 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.300
 attach but beware then will from the 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.980
 sms one mms 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:52.350
 well let's have a look at the keyboard 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.980
 a little closer and may determine 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.719
 we alright we have one up here 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.969
 line with suggestions 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:09.510
 So you can start with me 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:11.850
 I have the question after the vacation and 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.270
 so on then you could if you 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.950
 luck has practical sat down create 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:19.229
 in each case a letter up here 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.640
 word suggestions are right here with 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.409
 I delete the last character with it 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.240
 I jump to the next line, yes me 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.250
 a point had pressed longer 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.640
 I can also ask myself a question mark 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.189
 space come stop I come 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.869
 pressed for longer I can here 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:36.299
 question mark we choose or one 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:39.950
 exclamation mark what I want the gradl 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:42.930
 I have some nice smileys with me 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:44.729
 but it can be that one on the 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.920
 other device does not recognize so 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.860
 do not necessarily rely on it 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:53.189
 we go back to the abc we still have 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:58.979
 another option for digits 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:02:00.540
 and good for different symbols 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.149
 not quite cool would have been if 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.969
 we would have our own number line 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:08.039
 but unfortunately not that big the first 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:11.009
 letter big twice and the blue one 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.360
 point, everything seems big and if that 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.280
 whole is not filled 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.980
 Let's write small here I could 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:25.350
 now also second and that works 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:29.040
 as good as you can see now works 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:30.510
 Wonderful is the keyboard below 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.850
 we still have the possibility of a picture 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.430
 insert 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:37.740
 to take a picture it is for 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.600
 insert and a location as I said 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:42.630
 even then the sms is quite beautiful 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:45.120
 mms could be so expensive to watch out for 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:47.550
 it continues with the mails and here 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.709
 are available for selection either e-mail or 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:51.450
 of course gmail but we want e 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:54.330
 we look at two already 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.500
 news awaiting us as okay what 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.360
 I would be here 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.370
 Here I can once over vision 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.650
 and then see the different folders 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.420
 I also see two pieces waiting here 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.540
 me and two are with a star 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:08.430
 I can add a new one up here 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.239
 Write can search for mails and 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.880
 over the three points 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:14.280
 sort by, for example 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.890
 Larger unread with star priority 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.540
 and so on, I can tell you yourself 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:21.180
 Of course I can also put the maid 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:23.640
 and call them when whom to whom from whom 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.500
 were sent how big the whole is 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.540
 Here I see the subject here I see 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.030
 a few lines of vision after 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:34.110
 left or right to the previous or 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:35.820
 next e mail to display well what 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:39.110
 I can do the e-mail here 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:41.820
 answer all answers forward 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:43.200
 that, too, is self-explanatory 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.769
 I can get the message up here again 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.209
 Clear 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:48.420
 you see that works here 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:50.850
 really very fluent everything very much 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:53.519
 very good if we have a new mail 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:55.230
 Write then look at the whole thing 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:57.180
 Who can do that, of course, again 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:02.580
 The contacts can also search here 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:05.480
 attach something and that will be a lot 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:05.480
 select 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:12.030
 back can write a subject 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:17.010
 I came a little bit of a size 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:19.560
 change font size I can, of course 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:23.490
 a color change what i can do the whole thing 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:24.750
 field writing italic can underscore 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:30.050
 me only for one of all 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:30.050
 make a difference and so on 

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:34.140
 Again, I have smileys again 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:36.390
 and otherwise the keyboard 

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:38.160
 not really different 

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:39.600
 There is not much to say about here 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.790
 the three points we can use the text 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.560
 format other addressees 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:45.840
 Add priority set 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.920
 For example, it is important therefore have 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.500
 I'll just come up here 

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:51.780
 ausrufezeichen purely 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:54.390
 alternative priority low an arrow 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:55.920
 down settings are maybe 

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:58.080
 still important because we have the 

00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:01.440
 signature can change that you because 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:02.760
 first general settings and 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:04.620
 when I have a specific account 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:07.350
 I can choose the signature completely 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:15.380
 Exhibit or of course you like that 

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:19.950
 customize as I would like to have greeted by 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:21.180
 boss or something depending on how you call it 

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:23.280
 be funny 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:26.540
 yes that was it then already with male 

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:26.540
 You can not say much more about that
