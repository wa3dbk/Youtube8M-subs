00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 Today I 'm going to show you the nori tax that 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.339
 consists of throwing the ball into the air 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.740
 make the pine and catch it with 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.870
 legs this video is dedicated to hello 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.300
 friend and to miguel del puerto a greeting 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.950
 kids, let's start to learn it 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.690
 you must know how to make the pine with the ball 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.640
 between the legs and hold a minimum 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.770
 of time throws the ball into the air with 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.600
 hands or the vertical foot to your head and 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.189
 a height a little higher than her for 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.570
 calculate the time it takes to lower the 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.400
 moment in which it will weigh like doing 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.859
 the movement you can do it two 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.960
 ways of the style side hovered or by 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.239
 behind pinewood style I will first speak 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.430
 about how to put it aside the idea is 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.290
 you must throw the ball into the air 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.120
 vertical to your head and at a height a 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.010
 little superior to her must follow him 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.960
 always with your eyes when you see 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.940
 start to go down, throw yourself as if you have 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.530
 a kind of round and try to continue 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.489
 following it with the look until no 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.200
 you can more 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.910
 if you have thrown it vertical to you and have 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.530
 started the movement of the round in the 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.090
 right moment should I believe that 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.710
 any part of my legs 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.840
 I mean between the English ankles 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.730
 glutes or knees when you feel that the 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.559
 ball you touch just makes a little 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.600
 of force to tighten it and that you do not know 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.460
 escape to me personally this part 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.020
 I've always been out of inertia 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.670
 right now I just want to put up with you 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.560
 little doing the pine now let's talk about 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.060
 the other way of doing it is similar to 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.040
 make the end from my point of view 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.750
 is based more on analysis and then on the 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.670
 instruction that in the previous until the 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.330
 first part is as before lance 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.580
 the ball into the air 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.380
 vertical to your head a little higher 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.180
 that the height of this and analyzes how much 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.530
 long it takes to get down and up which 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.180
 must raise the ball since this is 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.920
 different for each person is to say 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.570
 keep your eyes on the ball in 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.909
 every moment when it starts to go down 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.290
 begins the movement of the pine you're going to 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.240
 stop seeing the ball before in the 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.950
 another way of doing it that's why I meant 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.050
 to her saying that it is more important 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.910
 intention continues to drive you with the 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:43.259
 legs in the movement of the pine e 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:44.850
 try to catch him behind the 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.649
 way that I explained earlier in the 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.630
 method of the round gives because it will already be 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.970
 near his legs we touch now 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.470
 different tips and progressions choose 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.300
 which way do you do it in the form of 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.460
 the round gives your leg impulse 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:58.500
 right so or with the left and in 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.420
 true to take away a point running in the 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.700
 method of the round gives you can do it 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.100
 supporting one hand only two or first 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.500
 one and then the work and in the method of 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.360
 Pine says he loses momentum if the 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.000
 right or left you can learn 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.130
 raising the ball with his hands 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.240
 in movements in value will always go 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.190
 above imagining that if you see the 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.870
 value trajectory jumps the ball 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.090
 vertical and try to get your 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.590
 legs the ass in the lumbar feels 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.570
 when it's your turn to familiarize yourself with 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.340
 the movement and learn to intuit when 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.450
 catching the ball increases the time 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.580
 you end up pine 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.410
 Once you have mastered everything you have to throw yourself 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.850
 fear at the key moment and make a 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.470
 fast scissors when you lift 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.790
 legs to catch the ball and you have to 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.060
 go with the idea of ​​staying doing the 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.340
 Pine tree 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.140
 in summary you have to make the movement 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.850
 with decision knowing that it will come out 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.310
 well influenced because you know what you're 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:46.170
 doing and very important before doing 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.319
 this trick warms the torso well and in 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.120
 special the dolls 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:52.010
 I just want to add that before any 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.780
 doubt me leave a comment and that of 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.680
 I would really like to see your nori cats 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.680
 so you know
