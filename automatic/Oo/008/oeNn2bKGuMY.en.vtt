okay and then you'll just kind of put it

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.490 
okay and then you'll just kind of put it
down<00:01:29.640> on<00:01:29.970> whichever<00:01:30.509> heart<00:01:30.960> you<00:01:31.110> want<00:01:31.320> this

has different sized hearts so you can
just<00:01:34.110> find<00:01:34.380> one<00:01:35.090> that<00:01:36.090> will<00:01:36.299> go<00:01:36.479> and<00:01:37.280> you'll<00:01:38.280> do

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
just find one that will go and you'll do

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.039 
just find one that will go and you'll do
two<00:01:38.670> of<00:01:38.700> those<00:01:39.000> and<00:01:39.360> then<00:01:39.509> you'll<00:01:39.659> just<00:01:39.869> allow

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
two of those and then you'll just allow

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.460 
two of those and then you'll just allow
this<00:01:40.530> to<00:01:40.710> dry<00:01:41.180> and<00:01:42.180> it<00:01:42.600> will<00:01:42.630> become<00:01:43.049> clear<00:01:43.350> and

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
this to dry and it will become clear and

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:44.660 
this to dry and it will become clear and
opaque<00:01:43.799> so<00:01:43.950> you<00:01:44.040> don't<00:01:44.189> have<00:01:44.280> to<00:01:44.430> worry<00:01:44.579> about

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
opaque so you don't have to worry about

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.990 
opaque so you don't have to worry about
that<00:01:45.000> and<00:01:46.100> and<00:01:47.100> it<00:01:47.280> takes<00:01:47.490> about<00:01:47.640> ten<00:01:47.970> minutes

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
that and and it takes about ten minutes

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.969 
that and and it takes about ten minutes
usually<00:01:48.600> to<00:01:49.049> dry<00:01:49.200> it<00:01:49.259> doesn't<00:01:49.409> take<00:01:49.710> very<00:01:49.740> long

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
usually to dry it doesn't take very long

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.730 
usually to dry it doesn't take very long
so<00:01:50.399> I<00:01:50.430> have<00:01:50.850> two<00:01:51.119> that<00:01:51.360> are<00:01:51.479> already<00:01:51.630> done<00:01:52.020> that
