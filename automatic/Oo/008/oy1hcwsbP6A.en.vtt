outstanding<00:02:19.370> very<00:02:20.370> good<00:02:22.010> so<00:02:23.010> now<00:02:23.190> what<00:02:23.489> we're

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
outstanding very good so now what we're

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.449 
outstanding very good so now what we're
going<00:02:23.850> to<00:02:23.970> do<00:02:24.620> go<00:02:25.620> ahead<00:02:25.800> and<00:02:25.920> flip<00:02:26.100> the<00:02:26.280> lever

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
going to do go ahead and flip the lever

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:30.979 
going to do go ahead and flip the lever
up<00:02:28.550> this<00:02:29.550> will<00:02:29.760> allow<00:02:29.940> us<00:02:29.970> to<00:02:30.420> take<00:02:30.569> the<00:02:30.750> case

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
up this will allow us to take the case

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:38.270 
up this will allow us to take the case
off<00:02:31.260> the<00:02:31.980> side<00:02:32.400> of<00:02:32.580> the<00:02:32.700> case<00:02:32.910> anyway<00:02:37.160> so<00:02:38.160> we

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
off the side of the case anyway so we

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:43.040 
off the side of the case anyway so we
pull<00:02:38.550> it<00:02:38.700> open<00:02:41.120> we<00:02:42.120> see<00:02:42.360> that<00:02:42.600> it<00:02:42.780> still<00:02:42.989> has

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
pull it open we see that it still has

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.820 
pull it open we see that it still has
the<00:02:43.440> original<00:02:43.650> glass<00:02:44.930> we<00:02:45.930> set<00:02:46.200> that<00:02:46.350> down<00:02:46.530> to

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
the original glass we set that down to

the original glass we set that down to
the<00:02:46.920> side<00:02:47.100> right<00:02:47.310> here

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.880
