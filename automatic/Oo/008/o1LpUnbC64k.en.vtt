00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
but I doubt it tested I'm hoping they're

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:14.420 
but I doubt it tested I'm hoping they're
gonna<00:03:13.260> clean<00:03:13.530> up<00:03:13.650> that<00:03:13.680> one<00:03:13.980> there

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
you can see it's pretty rough from here
