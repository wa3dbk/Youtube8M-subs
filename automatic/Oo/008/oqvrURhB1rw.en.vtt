as<00:00:06.089> you<00:00:06.210> can<00:00:06.270> see<00:00:06.480> he's<00:00:06.720> no<00:00:06.960> longer<00:00:07.140> one<00:00:07.680> he's

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
as you can see he's no longer one he's

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:10.370 
as you can see he's no longer one he's
been<00:00:07.890> downgraded<00:00:08.309> to<00:00:08.610> a<00:00:08.730> deluxe<00:00:08.970> class<00:00:09.380> which

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
been downgraded to a deluxe class which

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:11.990 
been downgraded to a deluxe class which
I<00:00:10.679> know<00:00:10.860> a<00:00:10.980> lot<00:00:11.190> of<00:00:11.219> people<00:00:11.490> have<00:00:11.610> complained

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
I know a lot of people have complained

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.180 
I know a lot of people have complained
about<00:00:12.090> it<00:00:12.780> is<00:00:12.929> not<00:00:13.259> the<00:00:13.469> most<00:00:13.650> horrible<00:00:13.950> thing

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
about it is not the most horrible thing

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.490 
about it is not the most horrible thing
in<00:00:14.309> the<00:00:14.370> world<00:00:14.549> I<00:00:14.849> I<00:00:15.059> too<00:00:15.299> wish<00:00:15.690> he<00:00:15.870> were<00:00:15.990> maybe

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
in the world I I too wish he were maybe

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.170 
in the world I I too wish he were maybe
a<00:00:16.619> Voyager<00:00:17.100> or<00:00:17.279> an<00:00:17.400> ultra<00:00:17.640> class

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
a Voyager or an ultra class

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.580 
a Voyager or an ultra class
I<00:00:18.289> think<00:00:19.289> leader<00:00:19.500> might<00:00:19.740> be<00:00:19.949> a<00:00:19.980> little<00:00:20.130> too<00:00:20.340> big

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:21.590 
I think leader might be a little too big

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:24.140 
I think leader might be a little too big
but<00:00:22.590> I<00:00:22.619> do<00:00:23.130> wish<00:00:23.369> she<00:00:23.490> was<00:00:23.609> a<00:00:23.640> slightly<00:00:23.939> bigger

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
but I do wish she was a slightly bigger

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.540 
but I do wish she was a slightly bigger
figure<00:00:24.510> but<00:00:24.720> we'll<00:00:25.260> get<00:00:25.350> into<00:00:25.500> that<00:00:25.590> later<00:00:26.400> on

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
figure but we'll get into that later on

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.099 
figure but we'll get into that later on
he's<00:00:26.910> he's<00:00:27.150> still<00:00:27.359> a<00:00:27.390> very<00:00:27.570> nice<00:00:27.840> figure

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
he's he's still a very nice figure

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.650 
he's he's still a very nice figure
especially<00:00:28.410> for<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:28.859> deluxe<00:00:29.099> class<00:00:29.660> price

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
especially for the deluxe class price

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.740 
especially for the deluxe class price
point<00:00:31.019> now<00:00:31.470> he<00:00:31.650> is<00:00:31.740> a<00:00:31.769> tank<00:00:32.360> he<00:00:33.360> does<00:00:33.540> have<00:00:33.719> a

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
point now he is a tank he does have a

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.190 
point now he is a tank he does have a
fully<00:00:34.530> rotatable<00:00:35.010> turret<00:00:35.780> which<00:00:36.780> is<00:00:36.960> nice<00:00:37.170> a

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
fully rotatable turret which is nice a

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.389 
fully rotatable turret which is nice a
lot<00:00:37.500> of<00:00:37.559> tanks<00:00:38.899> don't<00:00:39.899> have<00:00:40.230> that<00:00:40.500> especially

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
lot of tanks don't have that especially

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.479 
lot of tanks don't have that especially
at<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.579> deluxe<00:00:41.790> size<00:00:43.100> it<00:00:44.100> does<00:00:44.250> fire<00:00:44.460> a

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
at the deluxe size it does fire a

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.000 
at the deluxe size it does fire a
missile<00:00:44.789> I<00:00:45.469> don't<00:00:46.469> want<00:00:46.590> to<00:00:46.649> install<00:00:46.890> the

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
missile I don't want to install the

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.500 
missile I don't want to install the
front<00:00:47.190> and<00:00:47.460> it<00:00:47.550> actually<00:00:47.789> fires<00:00:48.000> with<00:00:48.480> a

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
front and it actually fires with a

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:49.760 
front and it actually fires with a
decent<00:00:48.899> amount<00:00:48.960> of<00:00:49.140> force<00:00:49.440> if<00:00:49.649> you

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
decent amount of force if you

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.950 
decent amount of force if you
accidentally<00:00:50.190> hit<00:00:50.280> this<00:00:50.430> button<00:00:50.670> it<00:00:51.449> will<00:00:51.750> go

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
accidentally hit this button it will go

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.340 
accidentally hit this button it will go
flying<00:00:52.260> good<00:00:52.890> ways<00:00:53.039> across<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.520> room<00:00:54.350> I'm

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
flying good ways across the room I'm

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.420 
flying good ways across the room I'm
gonna<00:00:55.530> go<00:00:55.649> ahead<00:00:55.770> and<00:00:55.920> take<00:00:56.039> it<00:00:56.070> out<00:00:56.250> because

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
gonna go ahead and take it out because

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.369 
gonna go ahead and take it out because
it<00:00:56.640> is<00:00:56.670> easy<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:57.090> hit<00:00:57.210> this<00:00:57.390> trigger<00:00:57.629> during

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
it is easy to hit this trigger during

00:00:58.379 --> 00:00:59.750 
it is easy to hit this trigger during
transformation<00:00:58.770> I'd<00:00:59.070> prefer<00:00:59.219> not<00:00:59.489> to<00:00:59.520> lose

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
transformation I'd prefer not to lose

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.779 
transformation I'd prefer not to lose
the<00:00:59.879> missile<00:01:00.149> in<00:01:00.449> here<00:01:01.460> to<00:01:02.460> start<00:01:02.609> the

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
the missile in here to start the

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.780 
the missile in here to start the
transformation<00:01:03.180> off<00:01:03.539> we<00:01:04.080> want<00:01:04.350> to<00:01:04.790> straighten

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
transformation off we want to straighten

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.700 
transformation off we want to straighten
this<00:01:06.030> back<00:01:06.600> peak<00:01:06.900> part<00:01:07.170> of<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.320> turret<00:01:07.530> and

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
this back peak part of the turret and

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:13.840 
this back peak part of the turret and
pop<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:08.909> cannon<00:01:09.530> up<00:01:10.530> like<00:01:10.799> this<00:01:12.830> which

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
pop the cannon up like this which

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:15.859 
pop the cannon up like this which
sometimes<00:01:14.850> tends<00:01:15.090> to<00:01:15.210> pop<00:01:15.390> it<00:01:15.570> off<00:01:15.659> it's<00:01:15.810> a

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
sometimes tends to pop it off it's a

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.210 
sometimes tends to pop it off it's a
whole<00:01:16.049> joint<00:01:16.290> but<00:01:16.500> you<00:01:16.560> just<00:01:16.710> can<00:01:16.830> just<00:01:17.009> snap

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
whole joint but you just can just snap

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.520 
whole joint but you just can just snap
it<00:01:17.340> right<00:01:17.369> back<00:01:17.490> on<00:01:17.960> pop<00:01:18.960> that<00:01:19.140> up<00:01:19.229> like<00:01:19.350> that

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
it right back on pop that up like that

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.130 
it right back on pop that up like that
and<00:01:19.890> squeeze<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.670> turret<00:01:20.939> together<00:01:21.210> like

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
and squeeze the turret together like

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:28.030 
and squeeze the turret together like
that<00:01:23.299> and<00:01:24.619> rotate<00:01:25.619> it<00:01:25.790> to<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:26.880> side<00:01:27.090> like<00:01:27.330> this

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:28.040 
that and rotate it to the side like this

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.440 
that and rotate it to the side like this
then<00:01:29.040> you<00:01:29.159> want<00:01:29.340> to<00:01:29.369> take<00:01:29.700> these<00:01:29.850> top<00:01:30.210> pieces

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
then you want to take these top pieces

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.620 
then you want to take these top pieces
and<00:01:31.439> attach<00:01:32.340> them<00:01:32.640> and<00:01:32.670> clip<00:01:33.119> them<00:01:33.240> from<00:01:33.479> the

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
and attach them and clip them from the

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:39.870 
and attach them and clip them from the
on<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:34.590> side<00:01:34.829> here

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.220 

so<00:01:40.880> that's<00:01:41.090> loose<00:01:41.420> and<00:01:41.720> then<00:01:41.840> you<00:01:41.960> can<00:01:42.080> take

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:42.230 
so that's loose and then you can take

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:48.160 
so that's loose and then you can take
this<00:01:42.410> piece<00:01:42.650> and<00:01:45.280> unclip<00:01:46.280> it<00:01:46.400> and<00:01:47.050> bring<00:01:48.050> it

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
this piece and unclip it and bring it

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.300 
this piece and unclip it and bring it
out<00:01:48.230> to<00:01:48.260> the<00:01:48.470> side<00:01:50.830> knows<00:01:51.830> you<00:01:51.920> just<00:01:52.100> saw<00:01:52.250> you

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
out to the side knows you just saw you

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.610 
out to the side knows you just saw you
want<00:01:52.610> to<00:01:52.670> take<00:01:52.850> go<00:01:53.810> ahead<00:01:53.990> and<00:01:54.080> rotate<00:01:54.320> this<00:01:54.470> up

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:54.620 
want to take go ahead and rotate this up

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:55.060 
want to take go ahead and rotate this up
like<00:01:54.740> this

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.070 
like this

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:56.980 
like this
take<00:01:55.610> these<00:01:55.790> side<00:01:56.060> pieces<00:01:56.300> and<00:01:56.600> flip<00:01:56.750> them<00:01:56.960> out

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 
take these side pieces and flip them out

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:03.510 
take these side pieces and flip them out
like<00:01:57.170> this<00:01:58.750> then<00:01:59.750> you'll<00:01:59.930> rotate<00:02:00.140> them<00:02:00.620> around

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.020 

to<00:02:04.520> the<00:02:04.640> side<00:02:05.170> you'll<00:02:06.170> push<00:02:06.410> this<00:02:06.590> forward<00:02:07.030> and

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
to the side you'll push this forward and

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:09.790 
to the side you'll push this forward and
then<00:02:08.360> this<00:02:08.540> will<00:02:08.750> peg<00:02:09.080> into<00:02:09.259> the<00:02:09.380> back<00:02:09.560> and

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
then this will peg into the back and

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.040 
then this will peg into the back and
seize<00:02:09.979> a<00:02:10.009> little<00:02:10.190> tab<00:02:10.399> and<00:02:10.729> a<00:02:10.790> slot<00:02:11.090> pegs<00:02:11.870> into

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
seize a little tab and a slot pegs into

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.790 
seize a little tab and a slot pegs into
the<00:02:12.140> back<00:02:12.350> of<00:02:12.500> that<00:02:13.450> then<00:02:14.450> rotate<00:02:14.840> it<00:02:14.870> so

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
the back of that then rotate it so

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.070 
the back of that then rotate it so
that's<00:02:16.040> a<00:02:16.330> something<00:02:17.330> like<00:02:17.420> that<00:02:17.570> you<00:02:17.870> do<00:02:17.990> the

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
that's a something like that you do the

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.970 
that's a something like that you do the
same<00:02:18.260> thing<00:02:18.410> over<00:02:18.530> here

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
same thing over here

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:25.050 
same thing over here
slide<00:02:19.820> this<00:02:19.970> forward<00:02:20.590> tap<00:02:21.590> it<00:02:21.770> in<00:02:22.540> and<00:02:23.540> rotate

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
slide this forward tap it in and rotate

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.510 
slide this forward tap it in and rotate
this<00:02:26.060> way<00:02:26.440> it's<00:02:27.440> basically<00:02:27.709> you<00:02:27.860> want<00:02:28.040> the

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:28.520 
this way it's basically you want the

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.190 
this way it's basically you want the
foot<00:02:28.760> to<00:02:28.790> line<00:02:29.090> up<00:02:29.240> under<00:02:29.450> the<00:02:29.570> kneecap<00:02:29.930> piece

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
foot to line up under the kneecap piece

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:35.170 
foot to line up under the kneecap piece
here<00:02:31.750> and<00:02:32.750> you're<00:02:32.930> gonna<00:02:33.790> rotate<00:02:34.790> the<00:02:35.060> gun

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
here and you're gonna rotate the gun

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.900 
here and you're gonna rotate the gun
sideways<00:02:35.720> lift<00:02:36.260> this<00:02:36.410> piece<00:02:36.650> up<00:02:36.890> this<00:02:37.670> piece

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
sideways lift this piece up this piece

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.150 
sideways lift this piece up this piece
has<00:02:38.120> folded<00:02:38.840> underneath<00:02:39.380> pull<00:02:39.890> that<00:02:40.010> all<00:02:40.130> the

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
has folded underneath pull that all the

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.860 
has folded underneath pull that all the
way<00:02:40.220> underneath<00:02:40.490> and<00:02:41.180> then<00:02:41.420> you<00:02:41.510> bring<00:02:41.720> the

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
way underneath and then you bring the

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:47.910 
way underneath and then you bring the
legs<00:02:42.610> down<00:02:43.610> like<00:02:43.880> this

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.260 

I<00:02:47.980> shall<00:02:48.730> turn<00:02:49.599> them<00:02:49.780> to<00:02:49.900> face<00:02:50.110> you<00:02:50.670> and<00:02:51.670> then

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:52.270 
I shall turn them to face you and then

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:54.870 
I shall turn them to face you and then
you<00:02:52.390> turn<00:02:52.569> the<00:02:52.720> whole<00:02:52.840> robot<00:02:53.200> around<00:02:53.290> and<00:02:54.280> turn

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
you turn the whole robot around and turn

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.170 
you turn the whole robot around and turn
the<00:02:55.030> waste<00:02:55.209> around<00:02:55.599> to<00:02:55.780> reveal<00:02:55.989> the<00:02:56.170> purple

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
the waste around to reveal the purple

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.960 
the waste around to reveal the purple
and<00:02:58.180> there's<00:02:58.390> his<00:02:58.569> legs<00:02:59.040> now<00:03:00.040> the<00:03:00.099> feet<00:03:00.520> rotate

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
and there's his legs now the feet rotate

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:10.740 
and there's his legs now the feet rotate
down<00:03:02.370> into<00:03:03.370> place<00:03:05.400> like<00:03:06.400> that

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.020 

and<00:03:11.230> this<00:03:11.500> is<00:03:11.650> a<00:03:11.680> rather<00:03:11.950> neat<00:03:12.340> bit<00:03:12.910> of

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
and this is a rather neat bit of

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.750 
and this is a rather neat bit of
transformation<00:03:13.720> this<00:03:13.900> arm<00:03:14.140> piece<00:03:14.550> first<00:03:15.550> it

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
transformation this arm piece first it

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:22.890 
transformation this arm piece first it
folds<00:03:16.090> in<00:03:16.210> half<00:03:18.180> like<00:03:19.180> that<00:03:19.210> and<00:03:20.760> then<00:03:21.900> once

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
folds in half like that and then once

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.120 
folds in half like that and then once
you<00:03:22.990> get<00:03:23.080> it<00:03:23.170> fold<00:03:23.380> in<00:03:23.560> half<00:03:23.710> there's<00:03:23.920> a<00:03:23.950> couple

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
you get it fold in half there's a couple

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:27.840 
you get it fold in half there's a couple
tabs<00:03:24.810> that<00:03:25.810> then<00:03:26.020> slide<00:03:26.830> forward<00:03:27.310> to<00:03:27.340> lock<00:03:27.640> the

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:27.850 
tabs that then slide forward to lock the

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:30.360 
tabs that then slide forward to lock the
arm<00:03:28.000> into<00:03:28.150> position<00:03:28.740> keep<00:03:29.740> it<00:03:29.890> from<00:03:30.040> unfolding

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
arm into position keep it from unfolding

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:31.980 
arm into position keep it from unfolding
it's<00:03:30.700> very<00:03:31.000> very<00:03:31.300> neat<00:03:31.510> little<00:03:31.750> mechanism

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:31.990 
it's very very neat little mechanism

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:35.520 
it's very very neat little mechanism
there<00:03:33.390> go<00:03:34.390> ahead<00:03:34.480> and<00:03:34.660> rotate<00:03:34.930> his<00:03:35.110> cannon

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
there go ahead and rotate his cannon

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:39.450 
there go ahead and rotate his cannon
down<00:03:36.450> flip<00:03:37.450> this<00:03:37.600> piece<00:03:37.840> down<00:03:38.080> and<00:03:38.460> rotate

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:39.460 
down flip this piece down and rotate

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:40.440 
down flip this piece down and rotate
that<00:03:39.640> whole<00:03:39.880> thing

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
that whole thing

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:43.500 
that whole thing
I<00:03:40.650> guess<00:03:41.650> this<00:03:41.800> way<00:03:41.950> up<00:03:42.130> up<00:03:42.310> into<00:03:42.610> his<00:03:42.760> arm<00:03:42.970> fill

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510 
I guess this way up up into his arm fill

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:47.490 
I guess this way up up into his arm fill
in<00:03:43.630> his<00:03:43.750> forearm<00:03:43.990> and<00:03:44.430> give<00:03:45.430> him<00:03:45.580> his<00:03:45.730> hand<00:03:46.500> and

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
in his forearm and give him his hand and

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.890 
in his forearm and give him his hand and
then<00:03:47.620> just<00:03:47.650> rotate<00:03:48.190> the<00:03:48.310> arm<00:03:48.459> around<00:03:48.720> at<00:03:49.720> the

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
then just rotate the arm around at the

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.640 
then just rotate the arm around at the
elbow<00:03:50.700> for<00:03:51.700> that<00:03:51.850> arm<00:03:52.090> now<00:03:52.360> this<00:03:53.110> arm<00:03:53.350> you<00:03:53.470> just

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
elbow for that arm now this arm you just

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:57.120 
elbow for that arm now this arm you just
want<00:03:53.800> to<00:03:53.830> pull<00:03:54.130> off<00:03:55.080> and<00:03:56.080> it<00:03:56.320> does<00:03:56.470> pop<00:03:56.680> off<00:03:56.920> if

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:57.130 
want to pull off and it does pop off if

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:58.260 
want to pull off and it does pop off if
you<00:03:57.190> put<00:03:57.370> too<00:03:57.459> much<00:03:57.550> pressure<00:03:57.790> on<00:03:57.940> the<00:03:58.030> ball

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:58.270 
you put too much pressure on the ball

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:01.290 
you put too much pressure on the ball
joint<00:03:58.480> no<00:03:59.230> but<00:03:59.380> it<00:03:59.470> snaps<00:03:59.680> right<00:03:59.770> back<00:03:59.890> on<00:04:00.300> flip

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:01.300 
joint no but it snaps right back on flip

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:06.570 
joint no but it snaps right back on flip
it<00:04:01.420> down<00:04:02.340> flip<00:04:03.340> the<00:04:03.490> hand<00:04:03.730> out<00:04:05.190> so<00:04:06.190> it<00:04:06.280> wants<00:04:06.400> to

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:06.580 
it down flip the hand out so it wants to

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:08.100 
it down flip the hand out so it wants to
come<00:04:06.760> out<00:04:06.940> there<00:04:07.750> you<00:04:07.810> go

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:08.110 
come out there you go

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:10.440 
come out there you go
and<00:04:08.830> flip<00:04:09.100> this<00:04:09.190> little<00:04:09.340> cap<00:04:09.940> I'm<00:04:10.209> the

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:10.450 
and flip this little cap I'm the

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:11.790 
and flip this little cap I'm the
instructions<00:04:10.900> show<00:04:11.140> there's<00:04:11.380> a<00:04:11.410> little<00:04:11.560> great

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:11.800 
instructions show there's a little great

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:14.490 
instructions show there's a little great
hook<00:04:12.070> that<00:04:12.720> piece<00:04:13.720> that<00:04:13.930> can<00:04:14.020> flip<00:04:14.290> up<00:04:14.440> a

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500 
hook that piece that can flip up a

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.530 
hook that piece that can flip up a
little<00:04:14.709> piece<00:04:14.860> of<00:04:14.890> detailing<00:04:15.340> I<00:04:15.700> just<00:04:16.299> tend<00:04:16.450> to

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:16.540 
little piece of detailing I just tend to

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:17.849 
little piece of detailing I just tend to
leave<00:04:16.720> it<00:04:16.810> down<00:04:16.840> because<00:04:17.140> it<00:04:17.290> doesn't<00:04:17.650> seem<00:04:17.739> to

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:17.859 
leave it down because it doesn't seem to

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:22.909 
leave it down because it doesn't seem to
serve<00:04:18.040> any<00:04:18.220> purpose<00:04:19.200> and<00:04:20.400> then<00:04:21.400> the<00:04:22.060> backpack

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919 
serve any purpose and then the backpack

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:26.250 
serve any purpose and then the backpack
rotate<00:04:23.919> this<00:04:24.070> down<00:04:24.390> flip<00:04:25.390> this<00:04:25.510> piece<00:04:25.750> up<00:04:25.990> and

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:26.260 
rotate this down flip this piece up and

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.400 
rotate this down flip this piece up and
these<00:04:26.890> two<00:04:27.100> posts<00:04:27.640> these<00:04:28.600> two<00:04:28.810> pieces<00:04:29.020> just

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:29.410 
these two posts these two pieces just

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:33.980 
these two posts these two pieces just
tab<00:04:29.650> on<00:04:29.860> to
