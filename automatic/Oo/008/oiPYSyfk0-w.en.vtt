00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:06.540
 place number five 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.970
 Venus is she morning and evening star 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.099
 2 from the sun the planet is in the group 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.530
 lands of similar planets in this group have 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.540
 Venus is the densest atmosphere consisting 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.580
 mainly from carbon dioxide 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.160
 This is explained by the fact that there is no Venus 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.930
 life and carbon cycle in venus 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.359
 is at a distance of one hundred and eight 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.070
 million kilometers from the sun 

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:29.789
 the distance to the earth ranges from 40 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.890
 up to 250 9 million kilometers ru. 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.469
 represented as primitive hot 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.329
 land where grow giant treelike 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.700
 ferns and roam dinosaurs 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:42.059
 one turn around the sun venera makes 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.770
 for 224 Earth days Venus is the only one 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.899
 a planet named after 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.750
 goddess in astrology venus symbolizes 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:51.270
 love and is considered the planet's patron 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.640
 the scales and calves have the symbol venus 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.250
 is a mirror the same as copper and 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.410
 feminine female planet often 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.840
 called the twin of the earth because of the very 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.539
 she is only about the same size 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:06.060
 640 kilometers less than the land on 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.159
 Venus strong winds blow in the atmosphere 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.500
 there are huge clouds 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:13.970
 because of what you can not see from the ground 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.970
 not even the sun 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:29.200
 place number four is the sixth planet from 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:31.810
 the sun saturn consists mainly of 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:34.270
 hydrogen with impurities of helium and also has 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:36.700
 traces of water are methane and ammonia a 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:38.710
 the region is a small core of iron not 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.170
 curry ice thin 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:43.660
 metallic hydrogen and gaseous 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:45.820
 the outer layer of saturn has a noticeable 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:47.410
 ring system there are parts 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.200
 ice check some heavy 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:52.120
 elements and dust though rings have 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.880
 other planets but only rings of saturn 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:57.040
 maybe see only four of them and 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.830
 together they reflect more light than 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:02.020
 the surface of the planet saturn the second 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.570
 largest planet of the solar system 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:07.300
 this is an example of superiority of form over 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:09.220
 content around the planet are spinning 62 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:11.410
 currently known satellite 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.840
 the largest of which titanium is 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:16.870
 the second largest in the solar system and 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.910
 even more than mercury also titanium is 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.890
 the only satellite in the solar system 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:22.720
 with a dense atmosphere now 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.000
 Saturn is in orbit 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:29.140
 automatic interplanetary station to 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:31.989
 Autumn launched in 1997 and arrived 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.910
 to the Saturn system in 2004 in astrology 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:36.430
 saturn is one of two not the most 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:38.290
 good patrons and patronizes 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:41.040
 to product his way 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.040
 well, you understand 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:47.049
 instead of number three jupiter is the biggest and 

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:49.480
 the fastest planet in the sun 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:51.849
 the jupiter system is one of the five 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:54.549
 planets that people can see and 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:56.129
 was known in antiquity on the planet 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:58.659
 atmospheric phenomena occur 

00:02:56.129 --> 00:03:02.079
 superior earth storms and lightning 

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:04.390
 the polar lights duck in 1665 by Giovanni 

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:06.670
 the bones did not fix the red spot on 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:08.920
 Jupiter is the largest 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.599
 an atmospheric vortex in the solar system would 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.909
 its length could accommodate three 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:15.310
 planets the size of the earth it's spinning 

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:17.920
 counterclockwise at 400 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:19.930
 35 kilometers per hour or from 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.879
 uncomfortable questions that may ask 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:24.579
 astronomers any student this why 

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:27.370
 red spot on jupiter red though 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:30.040
 jupiter is like saturn has rings but they 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:33.670
 so different from giants composition of rings 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:35.620
 no next to the 1970s Jupiter flew 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:37.780
 8 interplanetary ships that 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.980
 engaged in his study opened what 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.319
 There are a lot of unexplained people on the planet. 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:44.019
 phenomena so in the shade the temperature is not lower 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:46.269
 as usual, and above, moreover, Jupiter 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:48.489
 has speak more precisely make sounds 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:51.359
 who first recorded the nasa probe 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:51.359
 voyager 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:03.829
 place number two mars fourth planet 

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:06.170
 from the sun and 7 in size it is larger 

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:08.060
 only mercury is the surface of Mars 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:10.040
 and much thicker than the earth's reddish 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:12.709
 iron oxide gives the planet a color 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:14.780
 by the way the symbol of marsh shield and spear is the same 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:17.090
 the very symbol of both iron and male 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:19.519
 the beginning of the pressure on Mars 160 times 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:21.079
 less earthly and no man would 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:23.330
 could survive there oxygen in the blood 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:30.770
 would instantly turn into bubbles that 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:32.690
 would lead instant death to you 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:34.430
 fly to the red planet moving with 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:37.820
 a hundred kilometers an hour you 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:39.620
 I would have to fly 271 years and 221 days 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:41.570
 By the way, only a third of the ships 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:43.729
 sent mars have reached their goal 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:49.250
 which forced many to think about some 

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:51.020
 the martian bermuda triangle and 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:53.060
 no ozone layer surface 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:55.190
 Mars is buried every day mortal 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:57.080
 radiation doses in spite of all these 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:59.840
 the facts go serious selection and on 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:01.460
 colonization of mars terms there more 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:04.010
 all among the other planets of the solar 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:05.630
 systems are like earth days last 

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:08.150
 only thirty nine minutes longer 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:10.820
 than earthly and recent nasa studies 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:12.919
 confirmed the possible availability of water so 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:14.990
 not less about how to live on Mars so far 

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:16.699
 what can we learn only from the song noiz 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:19.250
 mc &amp; alice cooper 

00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:19.840
 aloft cool red sand steep 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:22.360
 the mountains 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:23.919
 craters insanely beautiful channels next to 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:26.139
 equator nothing compares to 

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:29.850
 there sunsets really cold 

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:29.850
 pressure to put it mildly low 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:35.650
 first place is the land of tyrr our dear world 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:37.900
 planet 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:39.850
 the only planet at the moment about 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:41.800
 which is aware that there is life 

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:44.050
 the earth emerged from the solar nebula 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:46.600
 about four and a half billion years 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:54.070
 back 1 life started around 

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:55.600
 about 4 billion years ago around 

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:57.610
 the land flies the only natural 

00:05:55.600 --> 00:06:00.580
 satellite moon but besides it exist 

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:02.440
 satellites and space stations which 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:04.030
 people run the moon the only 

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:06.040
 space object except earth on 

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:08.139
 which the man managed to visit a little 

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:10.450
 more than 70 percent of the earth's surface 

00:06:08.139 --> 00:06:12.310
 occupies world ocean okara earth 

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:13.840
 divided into several tectonic 

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:17.460
 plates that move with speed 

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:17.460
 several centimeters a year 

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:28.330
 the core of the earth supposedly consists of 

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:31.319
 iron and nickel and liquid outer core 

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:33.340
 which is the source of the magnetic field on 

00:06:31.319 --> 00:06:35.889
 interacts with other objects in 

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:38.289
 cosmos including sun and moon around 1 

00:06:35.889 --> 00:06:40.389
 the earth turns 2 same around 

00:06:38.289 --> 00:06:42.879
 lands in ancient times people thought that our 

00:06:40.389 --> 00:06:44.800
 the planet is the center of the universe and the sun 

00:06:42.879 --> 00:06:47.289
 revolves around us but it was 

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:49.629
 disproved like this that the earth is flat and 

00:06:47.289 --> 00:06:51.849
 is on three turtles our land 

00:06:49.629 --> 00:06:53.379
 home planet and no wonder she takes 

00:06:51.849 --> 00:07:04.270
 first place not only in our hearts 

00:06:53.379 --> 00:07:06.520
 but in the most popular top I will be glad 

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:08.590
 as a man first set foot on mars 

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:10.960
 if you subscribe to the channel as well 

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:14.250
 look at the top 5 deadly predators and
