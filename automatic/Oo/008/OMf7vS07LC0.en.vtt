00:00:07.769 --> 00:00:13.210
 the last home game of the year a whole 

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:15.070
 special borussia dortmund becomes too 

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:17.200
 guest his the team against the 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:20.230
 TSG on the last day of the season 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:22.750
 with 2 1 won and last minute the 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:25.030
 relegationsplatz secured a beautiful 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:27.340
 memory that you like to think back to 

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:30.460
 but so not before this game 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:32.380
 directly more than usual in the time 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:35.320
 be honest in the day-to-day business in 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:37.480
 normal week, you have no thoughts 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.640
 He comes back again and again 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.230
 to wear if you are with people 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.340
 one talks about football 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:44.560
 Of course, this event often happens 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.480
 addressed and then always come 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:49.780
 again so the pictures high and reminds 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:51.340
 But then what was then then but so 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.470
 In the day-to-day business, it's all about now 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:57.010
 but overall remains with us 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:59.290
 of course because this is absolutely positive 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.890
 effect we draw from this game 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:02.170
 could 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:03.550
 I think specially again 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.890
 we do not need to remember that 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:09.490
 remembrance is already at every even 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:11.050
 present and often enough in retrospect 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:14.740
 these scenes also again 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:16.409
 I think it's not good if you look at it 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.030
 because now again specifically on 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.409
 comes in when it was above all things 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.030
 a home game is another 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:22.690
 atmosphere as in dortmund us there 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.530
 expected 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:28.810
 even if a great enemy lurking on us 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.220
 the last three years twice 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.020
 German champion has become 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:33.940
 Champions League Final has played 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.560
 has now moved on in the 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:38.070
 Champions league already a big one 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:41.049
 task we are looking forward to this game 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:45.369
 to measure with the big ones if you can 

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:47.619
 exciting story and expect 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:49.720
 a very interesting game 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:51.640
 It's natural that we pull ours 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.110
 Games also want to win in the game 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.710
 we go in and try the game too 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.290
 win 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:59.020
 how it works then you will see 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:01.250
 can not assume that you 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.549
 totally play against dortmund 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.810
 you and you can count on a victory 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:07.310
 you have to see how the game works 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.259
 believe me were a chance to have that 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.629
 but it will be natural 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:12.890
 incredibly difficult task even those 

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:13.640
 Oppose and maybe say 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.980
 one after the other 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.319
 the point was good or the point has us 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:21.410
 also it suits it i think it is 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:22.940
 already so that we stop this year 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.860
 sometimes so the constellations want 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.420
 as they say right from the first 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.040
 seven then have six teams to 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.450
 home had perhaps missing because of that 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.190
 one or the other also won the one 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.500
 would have liked to have done more at home 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.519
 but that I still find a nice one 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.910
 graduation for the year 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:39.319
 that somehow makes the secret or the 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.120
 farewell in front of the domestic fans such a 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:44.329
 a little bit after the story with 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:46.430
 dortmund in the first as conclusion of the 

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:48.230
 last season and now dortmund here 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.940
 to conclude the home games 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:53.150
 I think that's quite a round 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:55.010
 story in the two play schalke 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.160
 and frankfurt has the team already 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:00.019
 works very well 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:01.700
 it has to be thoughtful 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:03.849
 what makes even a change or sense 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.849
 Not
