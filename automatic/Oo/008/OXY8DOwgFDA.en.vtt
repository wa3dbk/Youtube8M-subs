 baby blues amapoen turn in the presentation dedicated path le 

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:08.679
 Announcements 

00:00:08.679 --> 00:00:10.320
 iman land either. 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.730
 thirty volume 1 in this first course vs we will have how to expand 

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:18.070
 the potential of mint rei 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:20.269
 through 

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:23.210
 extensions that are not available 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.630
 p2 then brings the interior of the render engine interfaces 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:28.839
 the first part 

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:33.359
 of course we introduce new elements of the books 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.780
 we will install these new elements inside the 3ds max cappelletti 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:39.900
 &amp; amp 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.480
 therefore we will observe how to introduce these potentials that concern you 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:44.970
 choose sta 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:49.180
 and then we will activate these shellers within the interface of 3ds max 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.090
 to be able to make great ale acacias 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.710
 new features 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.870
 once we have access to new features and we will have the new one 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.870
 interface that manages 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:06.100
 dogo potential in relation to the options to take 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:11.620
 in this first course it creates a duration of 1 hour 30 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:14.390
 and have 14 lessons 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.250
 we will be focused on it 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.469
 in understanding and using the first area 

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:23.280
 concerning the astra port 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.490
 amount is only the techniques that were already present in the versions 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:29.710
 previous but always hidden 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:34.320
 that now the mental ray reaction becomes more and more important in the mind 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.290
 because they lean 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.930
 implementations already present via source those I know talking about fans is gay for 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:44.930
 and we are talking about klobas the doubts greece 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:50.790
 of these 14 lessons we will study how the test is domination assigns amount 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.910
 I know traitor colobraro 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:56.260
 this will be an important step I open that amount then 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:57.990
 they will be able to talk 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.000
 with other extensions in relation to taking to church we will spy 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.940
 subsequently 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:09.320
 of these elections we will observe all the options that are inserted inside 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:12.289
 of the amount if so 

00:02:12.289 --> 00:02:16.119
 each lesson will explain to you what German helmets are and what they are 

00:02:16.119 --> 00:02:21.189
 density what emerges is the saix task what the test hearts is 

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:23.579
 transverse 

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:27.189
 all these lessons then interface with the knowledge you should have 

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:31.929
 have already acquired connected mint writer courses. 7 

00:02:31.929 --> 00:02:33.170
 we're talking about 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.680
 of the 1 Nerazzurri volumes for example to make Inca 

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:42.079
 because you will refer to the options that are examples of throat bags 

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:44.709
 illuminations and you will understand how 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:49.879
 the options of the sedation amount or proof les illuminations and how it is 

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:52.879
 they relate the presence of fans to gays for example 

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:56.539
 then these under the guise 

00:02:56.539 --> 00:03:00.349
 quite advanced in the new income management 

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:04.249
 from we will observe with me 

00:03:04.249 --> 00:03:05.559
 Sara 

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:09.039
 save solutions the importance of 

00:03:09.779 --> 00:03:11.739
 and inside d 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:16.030
 this first course go we will have 2 files that will accompany us 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:18.749
 the first file if this 

00:03:18.749 --> 00:03:22.949
 this fais as always is available for your projects then west 

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:27.959
 tel these two sessions that you can then use as you wish inside 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:30.549
 of your comments 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:33.989
 let's look at some lends 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:35.839
 we will have heads 

00:03:35.839 --> 00:03:38.599
 in relation to 

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:41.879
 interrogation of those who sleep 

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:44.319
 i would insert the tv 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:45.210
 a 

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:47.010
 harry radianza 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:52.349
 to the density and therefore we will understand how the amount if they relate to 

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:55.650
 indirect lighting through these tests that are 

00:03:56.289 --> 00:04:00.949
 very important because they will make you understand some interesting things 

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:05.090
 the final renderings as we will always do later 

00:04:05.969 --> 00:04:08.399
 during the lessons this is one 

00:04:08.399 --> 00:04:11.539
 final rendering that we will create together 

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:15.929
 and it will be the reason to understand how the amount if they relate 

00:04:15.929 --> 00:04:18.989
 within the final images of a certain quality 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:23.750
 there are old acquaintances for those who have also followed the previous courses 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:25.009
 that is to say 

00:04:25.009 --> 00:04:30.009
 the elements of this type there will also be elections related to 

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:32.370
 and other rendering situations 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:33.220
 always 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:36.249
 in relation to the sky amount options 

00:04:36.249 --> 00:04:39.969
 they will make you understand how he cares if they can change the look 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:44.450
 de aprender in relation to indirect lighting 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.409
 this is the set file set forth. I was talking then or 

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:53.050
 I greet you thank you and wait for the first part 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:55.969
 of the news gently backs away.
