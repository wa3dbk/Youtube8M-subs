00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
now while the wither only has 150 health

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.369 
now while the wither only has 150 health
which<00:00:52.649> was<00:00:52.770> nothing<00:00:52.980> compared<00:00:53.460> to<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.610> hop<00:00:53.730> oh

00:00:54.369 --> 00:00:54.379 
which was nothing compared to the hop oh

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:56.750 
which was nothing compared to the hop oh
you<00:00:55.379> broke<00:00:55.530> my<00:00:55.680> with<00:00:55.860> a<00:00:55.890> thing<00:00:56.160> which<00:00:56.730> is

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
you broke my with a thing which is

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.000 
you broke my with a thing which is
nothing<00:00:57.180> compared<00:00:57.539> to<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:57.719> Hydra<00:00:58.140> arm<00:00:58.530> I

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
nothing compared to the Hydra arm I

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.619 
nothing compared to the Hydra arm I
don't<00:00:59.399> think<00:00:59.520> we've<00:00:59.609> ever<00:00:59.699> had<00:00:59.850> a<00:01:00.000> mob<00:01:00.420> of<00:01:00.449> as

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
don't think we've ever had a mob of as

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.270 
don't think we've ever had a mob of as
much<00:01:00.780> health<00:01:01.020> as<00:01:01.079> a<00:01:01.199> Hydra<00:01:01.530> before<00:01:01.859> the

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
much health as a Hydra before the

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.520 
much health as a Hydra before the
closest<00:01:02.910> thing<00:01:03.030> is<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.210> turtle<00:01:03.480> and<00:01:03.719> before

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
closest thing is the turtle and before

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.530 
closest thing is the turtle and before
you<00:01:04.619> ask<00:01:04.799> those<00:01:05.040> two<00:01:05.280> can't<00:01:05.519> fight<00:01:05.790> trust<00:01:06.270> me<00:01:06.420> I

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
you ask those two can't fight trust me I

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.140 
you ask those two can't fight trust me I
tried<00:01:06.830> the<00:01:07.830> wither<00:01:08.040> is<00:01:08.250> faster<00:01:08.790> and<00:01:08.970> he

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
tried the wither is faster and he

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.810 
tried the wither is faster and he
doesn't<00:01:09.390> miss<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:10.110> Hydra<00:01:10.650> he<00:01:11.250> misses<00:01:11.549> a<00:01:11.580> lot

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
doesn't miss the Hydra he misses a lot

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.969 
doesn't miss the Hydra he misses a lot
arm<00:01:12.150> so<00:01:12.450> it's<00:01:12.540> kind<00:01:12.750> of<00:01:12.810> it's<00:01:12.990> quite<00:01:13.140> cool<00:01:13.409> that

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
arm so it's kind of it's quite cool that

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.100 
arm so it's kind of it's quite cool that
with<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.700> flying<00:01:15.030> around<00:01:15.360> kind<00:01:15.659> of<00:01:15.689> pelting

as<00:01:31.920> you<00:01:32.009> can<00:01:32.100> see<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.369> withers<00:01:32.640> charging<00:01:33.060> up

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
as you can see the withers charging up

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.749 
as you can see the withers charging up
itself<00:01:33.360> and<00:01:33.540> then<00:01:33.659> BAM<00:01:34.310> explosion<00:01:35.310> so<00:01:35.579> as<00:01:35.640> you

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
itself and then BAM explosion so as you

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:36.620 
itself and then BAM explosion so as you
can<00:01:35.880> see<00:01:36.000> they're<00:01:36.119> fighting<00:01:36.329> I'm<00:01:36.390> gonna<00:01:36.540> see

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
can see they're fighting I'm gonna see

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.600 
can see they're fighting I'm gonna see
if<00:01:36.720> I<00:01:36.780> can<00:01:36.869> get<00:01:36.990> a<00:01:37.140> little<00:01:37.829> bit<00:01:38.189> closer<00:01:38.400> so<00:01:38.490> you

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
if I can get a little bit closer so you

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:39.980 
if I can get a little bit closer so you
can<00:01:38.700> actually<00:01:39.030> see<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.390> fireballs<00:01:39.720> there<00:01:39.869> we

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
can actually see the fireballs there we

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.569 
can actually see the fireballs there we
go<00:01:40.140> you<00:01:40.710> can<00:01:40.740> see<00:01:40.890> that<00:01:41.009> with<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.340> shooting

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
go you can see that with the shooting

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:42.920 
go you can see that with the shooting
and<00:01:41.700> skulls<00:01:42.000> and<00:01:42.240> is<00:01:42.360> it<00:01:42.479> better<00:01:42.630> without<00:01:42.720> a

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
and skulls and is it better without a

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.660 
and skulls and is it better without a
wiz<00:01:43.170> I<00:01:43.200> think<00:01:43.530> without<00:01:43.860> actually<00:01:44.310> honestly

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
wiz I think without actually honestly

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.609 
wiz I think without actually honestly
I'm<00:01:45.270> gonna<00:01:45.630> I'm<00:01:45.810> gonna<00:01:45.869> I'm<00:01:46.140> gonna<00:01:46.320> try<00:01:46.560> it

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna try it

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.380 
I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna try it
with<00:01:46.740> both<00:01:46.770> so<00:01:47.070> as<00:01:47.159> you<00:01:47.250> can<00:01:47.369> see<00:01:47.430> that<00:01:47.729> with<00:01:48.360> a

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
with both so as you can see that with a

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.810 
with both so as you can see that with a
when<00:01:49.290> he<00:01:49.320> gets<00:01:49.590> hit<00:01:49.829> he<00:01:50.009> takes<00:01:50.220> a<00:01:50.340> lot<00:01:50.549> of

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
when he gets hit he takes a lot of

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.190 
when he gets hit he takes a lot of
damage<00:01:50.970> I<00:01:51.210> think<00:01:51.240> he's<00:01:51.479> already<00:01:51.630> been<00:01:51.810> hit

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
damage I think he's already been hit

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.530 
damage I think he's already been hit
only<00:01:52.530> like<00:01:52.649> once<00:01:52.920> or<00:01:53.100> twice<00:01:53.340> but<00:01:54.090> at<00:01:54.270> the<00:01:54.360> same

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
only like once or twice but at the same

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.450 
only like once or twice but at the same
time<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:54.899> Hydra<00:01:55.439> misses<00:01:55.740> with<00:01:55.890> his<00:01:56.009> attacks<00:01:56.310> a

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
time the Hydra misses with his attacks a

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.459 
time the Hydra misses with his attacks a
lot<00:01:56.820> while<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.270> wither<00:01:57.479> like<00:01:57.750> always<00:01:58.020> you<00:01:58.350> can

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
lot while the wither like always you can

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.459 
lot while the wither like always you can
to<00:01:58.530> see<00:01:58.710> he's<00:01:59.219> just<00:01:59.280> pelting<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.350> Hydra<00:02:01.350> on

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
to see he's just pelting the Hydra on

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.530 
to see he's just pelting the Hydra on
the<00:02:01.619> head<00:02:01.829> with<00:02:02.130> his<00:02:02.430> wither<00:02:02.700> skulls<00:02:03.119> which<00:02:03.360> is

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
the head with his wither skulls which is

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.450

of his heads actually died but that

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.860 
of his heads actually died but that
means<00:02:11.220> two<00:02:11.520> more<00:02:11.790> is<00:02:11.940> gonna<00:02:12.060> comps<00:02:12.510> that's<00:02:12.690> bad

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
means two more is gonna comps that's bad

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
difficult for me to commentate on this

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.390 
difficult for me to commentate on this
battle<00:02:22.110> but<00:02:22.290> this<00:02:22.740> was<00:02:22.890> the<00:02:23.010> best<00:02:23.130> Hydra

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
battle but this was the best Hydra

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.530 
battle but this was the best Hydra
battle<00:02:23.640> I<00:02:23.670> could<00:02:23.819> do<00:02:23.910> and<00:02:24.060> frankly<00:02:24.330> with<00:02:24.450> the

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
battle I could do and frankly with the

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:25.850 
battle I could do and frankly with the
Hydra<00:02:24.840> there's<00:02:25.020> not<00:02:25.140> much<00:02:25.290> you<00:02:25.319> can<00:02:25.440> do<00:02:25.650> so<00:02:25.770> you

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
Hydra there's not much you can do so you

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.580 
Hydra there's not much you can do so you
look<00:02:25.950> it's<00:02:26.100> like<00:02:26.250> yeah<00:02:26.610> fire<00:02:27.170> fire<00:02:28.170> spewing

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590

look it's like yeah fire fire spewing
everywhere<00:02:28.770> and<00:02:29.280> the<00:02:29.340> withers<00:02:29.640> like<00:02:29.820> dodging

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
everywhere and the withers like dodging

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.060 
everywhere and the withers like dodging
around<00:02:30.360> so<00:02:31.050> I'm<00:02:31.170> not<00:02:31.290> sure<00:02:31.350> how<00:02:31.560> much<00:02:31.650> hydrat

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
around so I'm not sure how much hydrat

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:34.370 
around so I'm not sure how much hydrat
that<00:02:32.459> not<00:02:33.120> so<00:02:33.240> much<00:02:33.390> Hydra<00:02:33.840> not<00:02:34.020> so<00:02:34.140> much

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
that not so much Hydra not so much

that not so much Hydra not so much
health<00:02:34.800> the<00:02:35.070> hydras<00:02:35.490> on<00:02:35.610> the<00:02:36.120> wither<00:02:36.360> you<00:02:36.570> can

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
health the hydras on the wither you can

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.580 
health the hydras on the wither you can
see<00:02:36.930> is<00:02:37.050> unlike<00:02:37.970> two-thirds<00:02:38.970> but<00:02:39.810> it<00:02:39.989> I<00:02:40.230> can't

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
see is unlike two-thirds but it I can't

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:41.900 
see is unlike two-thirds but it I can't
seem<00:02:40.830> to<00:02:40.860> get<00:02:41.070> on<00:02:41.220> the<00:02:41.310> Hydra<00:02:41.640> because<00:02:41.790> that's

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
seem to get on the Hydra because that's

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.220 
seem to get on the Hydra because that's
the<00:02:42.000> problem<00:02:42.150> another<00:02:42.390> problem<00:02:42.510> is<00:02:42.810> that<00:02:42.840> look

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
stationary cannot move with a exact

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.479 
stationary cannot move with a exact
officer<00:02:58.320> -<00:02:58.440> spinning<00:02:58.739> around<00:02:58.860> and<00:02:59.130> doing<00:02:59.370> lots

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
officer - spinning around and doing lots

of damage and hitting over and over and

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.210 
of damage and hitting over and over and
over<00:03:00.780> gonna<00:03:01.200> kinda<00:03:01.410> get<00:03:01.530> a<00:03:01.560> little<00:03:01.620> bit<00:03:02.040> closer

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
over gonna kinda get a little bit closer

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.479 
over gonna kinda get a little bit closer
again<00:03:03.230> yeah<00:03:04.230> yeah<00:03:04.260> and<00:03:04.800> each<00:03:04.950> of<00:03:05.070> the<00:03:05.130> hydras

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
again yeah yeah and each of the hydras

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:06.860 
again yeah yeah and each of the hydras
heads<00:03:05.700> is<00:03:05.880> actually<00:03:06.150> like<00:03:06.269> an<00:03:06.390> individual

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
heads is actually like an individual

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.300 
heads is actually like an individual
head<00:03:07.050> I<00:03:07.230> don't<00:03:07.500> know<00:03:07.620> is<00:03:07.739> me<00:03:07.860> oh<00:03:07.950> there<00:03:08.220> we<00:03:08.280> go

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
head I don't know is me oh there we go

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.580 
head I don't know is me oh there we go
the<00:03:09.120> hydras<00:03:09.450> axe<00:03:09.570> on<00:03:09.720> quite<00:03:10.140> a<00:03:10.170> bit<00:03:10.440> lower

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
the hydras axe on quite a bit lower

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.530 
the hydras axe on quite a bit lower
health<00:03:10.890> if<00:03:11.130> you<00:03:11.160> a<00:03:11.790> lot<00:03:11.880> of<00:03:11.940> people<00:03:12.150> didn't<00:03:12.450> see

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
health if you a lot of people didn't see

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.210 
health if you a lot of people didn't see
that<00:03:12.630> coming<00:03:12.930> you<00:03:12.989> can<00:03:13.140> see<00:03:13.230> the<00:03:13.350> with<00:03:13.500> are<00:03:13.680> is

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
that coming you can see the with are is

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.979 
that coming you can see the with are is
losing<00:03:14.550> health<00:03:14.820> definitely<00:03:15.239> but<00:03:15.390> if<00:03:15.480> I<00:03:15.570> look<00:03:15.690> I

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
losing health definitely but if I look I

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:17.840 
losing health definitely but if I look I
think<00:03:16.260> around<00:03:16.440> here<00:03:16.800> no<00:03:17.100> oh<00:03:17.310> there<00:03:17.519> it<00:03:17.610> is

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
think around here no oh there it is

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:19.310 
think around here no oh there it is
hydras<00:03:18.420> health<00:03:18.600> when<00:03:18.750> I<00:03:18.810> look<00:03:18.959> at<00:03:19.049> the<00:03:19.140> ground

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
hydras health when I look at the ground

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:20.630 
hydras health when I look at the ground
you<00:03:19.410> could<00:03:19.590> see<00:03:19.680> the<00:03:19.799> Hydra<00:03:20.070> is<00:03:20.130> actually<00:03:20.370> very

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
you could see the Hydra is actually very

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.020 
you could see the Hydra is actually very
very<00:03:21.030> low<00:03:21.650> so<00:03:22.650> I<00:03:22.680> think<00:03:22.799> the<00:03:23.310> wither<00:03:23.519> is<00:03:23.730> going

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
very low so I think the wither is going

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:25.580 
very low so I think the wither is going
to<00:03:24.150> take<00:03:24.329> this<00:03:24.450> barrel<00:03:24.870> not<00:03:25.110> many<00:03:25.260> people<00:03:25.410> saw

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
to take this barrel not many people saw

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.560 
to take this barrel not many people saw
that<00:03:25.620> coming<00:03:25.920> but<00:03:26.130> the<00:03:27.000> wither<00:03:27.180> is<00:03:27.390> now

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570 
that coming but the wither is now

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:29.150 
that coming but the wither is now
dropping<00:03:27.840> down<00:03:28.170> onto<00:03:28.380> the<00:03:28.470> ground<00:03:28.650> on<00:03:28.980> its

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
dropping down onto the ground on its

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.160 
dropping down onto the ground on its
healing<00:03:29.489> format<00:03:30.150> so<00:03:30.510> that<00:03:30.540> means<00:03:30.840> we<00:03:31.049> would

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
healing format so that means we would

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:32.990 
healing format so that means we would
heal<00:03:31.560> but<00:03:32.130> at<00:03:32.190> the<00:03:32.250> same<00:03:32.370> time<00:03:32.519> it<00:03:32.670> could<00:03:32.850> be<00:03:32.940> an

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
heal but at the same time it could be an

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.460 
heal but at the same time it could be an
advantage<00:03:33.150> for<00:03:33.540> the<00:03:33.630> Hydra<00:03:34.019> because<00:03:34.260> he<00:03:34.350> might

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
advantage for the Hydra because he might

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.199 
advantage for the Hydra because he might
hit<00:03:34.739> him<00:03:34.860> always<00:03:35.190> sort<00:03:35.459> of<00:03:35.489> on<00:03:35.610> the<00:03:35.820> ground<00:03:36.030> and

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
hit him always sort of on the ground and

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:38.210 
hit him always sort of on the ground and
you<00:03:36.269> sort<00:03:36.420> of<00:03:36.480> shock<00:03:36.780> state<00:03:37.140> when<00:03:37.829> I<00:03:37.920> tested

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
you sort of shock state when I tested

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.340 
you sort of shock state when I tested
this<00:03:38.340> battle<00:03:38.610> it<00:03:38.700> didn't<00:03:38.880> happen<00:03:39.180> but<00:03:39.840> oh<00:03:39.989> and

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.350 
this battle it didn't happen but oh and

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:42.319 
this battle it didn't happen but oh and
the<00:03:40.650> Hydra<00:03:40.980> is<00:03:41.100> dying<00:03:41.370> as<00:03:41.640> you<00:03:41.790> can<00:03:41.940> see<00:03:42.090> he's

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:42.329 
the Hydra is dying as you can see he's

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:43.910 
the Hydra is dying as you can see he's
now<00:03:42.480> exploding<00:03:42.989> in<00:03:43.110> all<00:03:43.200> his<00:03:43.350> head<00:03:43.560> to<00:03:43.709> disk
