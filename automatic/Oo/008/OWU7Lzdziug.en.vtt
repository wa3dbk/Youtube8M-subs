00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:08.610
 In this video we are the third manager 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.880
 spoken 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:14.340
 the third rule says at the intersection 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.460
 a purely earthy parental generation 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.470
 become two different features 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:22.740
 independently three runs 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:25.080
 Things are important to this rule 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.359
 one is a rpg 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:31.019
 parental generation so the parents are 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:33.390
 with respect to both features promotion of 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.130
 further the fact that it is 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.410
 two different features are involved 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.500
 in the first and second Mendelian 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:43.879
 rule is usually from apartment 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.469
 the rest of the heirs talked about them 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:49.379
 consider feature 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.910
 this is about dissuading the idea and 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.399
 the third point is just the thing with 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.550
 independence is what we call it 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:59.280
 this third rule also plain and 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.680
 simply look at independence rules 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.680
 Let's start with how the rule 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.400
 in the cross and schema we present 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:11.220
 here the parental generation and music 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:14.100
 digital generation where music is fast 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.080
 both features are the features here 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.930
 on the one hand the first color and the hearts 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.130
 because we are looking at 200 times 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.159
 it is one of the hebrides 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:26.640
 Here's what the initials are 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:32.000
 Hot big admits for money dominant 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:35.400
 against small g for green large it is 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.880
 dominant over small he big and 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:41.790
 small it is important to us after the first 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.659
 managers are all individual 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.020
 the f1 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:49.409
 ration uniform so right in this 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:52.950
 case they are all phenotypically yellow and 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:56.549
 around there big then goes against small 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:58.200
 big he is dominant over small so 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:01.159
 and now comes the clou on the whole 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:04.530
 The result is four now 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:06.929
 different cells do not form and 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.390
 these four germ cells are then used for 

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:11.009
 the crossing scheme of the two 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:15.599
 generations each on the grow 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:17.040
 note here and here a germ cell one 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:19.590
 can imagine that that one 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.560
 border here comes from father and one 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.209
 from mother or vice versa 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.549
 and each of these germ cell includes 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:29.340
 an information regarding one 

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:32.970
 feature that is already here once 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.920
 this germ cell to big he big this 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:38.310
 Germ cell contains the information 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:42.269
 for the form enlarged and and for the 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:46.109
 color big money why too and and yellow 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:49.859
 every germ cell must have both characteristics 

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:52.530
 cover with one avenue and from the 

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:55.200
 free combinability of the 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:58.560
 Independence can now be next to four 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:03.569
 germ cells are formed and both 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:04.829
 in the case of the material line, therefore 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:06.689
 a mother as well as from the side of 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:11.209
 Father and so on, this results 

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:14.069
 crossing scheme is striking here 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:16.439
 the internet two generations new 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:19.439
 feature combinations arise 

00:03:16.439 --> 00:03:23.340
 what is it now known here when 

00:03:19.439 --> 00:03:28.139
 these types and new ones are for example the 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:31.999
 here wrinkled and money continues parental 

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:36.540
 Generation not represented as well as 

00:03:31.999 --> 00:03:38.760
 here smooth and green at also in the 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:41.969
 brander content does not represent that 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:44.250
 ratio at the dominant recessive 

00:03:41.969 --> 00:03:49.739
 the rest he likes to have in the f2 generation 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:52.290
 it is always new to record 3 3 to 1 that 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:53.959
 is the typical relationship we have 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:57.230
 we can take a quick look 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:04:03.989
 9 is seen at a glance 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:08.629
 yellow and and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 3 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:12.870
 will pay for a green one 1 2 3 and 

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:15.870
 us league and yellow 123 and that is one 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:18.630
 that we are green and that's it 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:21.690
 so important again for 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:23.849
 Repeat freely combinable that 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:25.440
 means it can not be different 

00:04:23.849 --> 00:04:28.470
 cells with different occupation 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:30.419
 their alene so avenue is one 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:31.590
 training form of a gene and the 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:33.180
 can be different with each other 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:34.349
 be combined 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.240
 one speaks of freyler 

00:04:34.349 --> 00:04:38.980
 Combinability and so turns 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:42.610
 this intersection scheme is interesting 

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:45.010
 with two new more combinations 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:45.940
 occur in the parental generation 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:47.890
 not available 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:51.250
 if you have problems with the 

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:53.500
 terms like phenotype retro 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:55.420
 music and so on you can have 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:58.590
 the first video concerning the humans 

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:58.590
 lie to look at
