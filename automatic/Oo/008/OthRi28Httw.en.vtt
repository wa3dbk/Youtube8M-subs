think it kind of mask away what I have
going<00:03:39.180> on<00:03:39.390> here<00:03:39.450> because<00:03:40.380> your<00:03:40.530> eyes<00:03:40.680> kind<00:03:41.010> of

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
going on here because your eyes kind of

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.610 
going on here because your eyes kind of
go<00:03:41.190> to<00:03:41.250> the<00:03:41.490> belt<00:03:41.760> not<00:03:42.270> the<00:03:42.510> Bulge<00:03:42.780> and<00:03:43.200> kind<00:03:43.500> of

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
go to the belt not the Bulge and kind of

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.430 
go to the belt not the Bulge and kind of
ties<00:03:43.830> that<00:03:44.160> an<00:03:44.670> angel<00:03:45.000> you<00:03:45.360> can<00:03:45.540> create<00:03:46.200> this

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440
