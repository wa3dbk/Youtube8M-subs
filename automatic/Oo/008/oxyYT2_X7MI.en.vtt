a few features that we need to go over

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.430 
a few features that we need to go over
on<00:00:13.500> our<00:00:13.830> telescoping<00:00:14.429> loading<00:00:14.849> ramps<00:00:15.440> comes

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
on our telescoping loading ramps comes

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.200 
on our telescoping loading ramps comes
with<00:00:16.619> this<00:00:16.770> non-slip<00:00:17.430> material<00:00:17.550> that<00:00:18.090> is

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:21.080 
positions through this hole right here

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.140 
positions through this hole right here
this<00:01:22.080> pin<00:01:22.380> will<00:01:22.560> slide<00:01:22.830> in<00:01:23.070> when<00:01:23.700> you<00:01:23.790> line<00:01:24.000> it

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
this pin will slide in when you line it

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.359 
this pin will slide in when you line it
up<00:01:24.240> with<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.200> coordinating<00:01:25.740> hole<00:01:25.920> of<00:01:26.159> the

up with the coordinating hole of the

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.010 
up with the coordinating hole of the
inner<00:01:26.549> part<00:01:26.850> of<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:27.060> ramp<00:01:27.240> let's<00:01:27.750> go<00:01:27.900> ahead

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
inner part of the ramp let's go ahead

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.749 
inner part of the ramp let's go ahead
and<00:01:28.200> I'll<00:01:28.259> slide<00:01:28.590> it<00:01:28.710> out<00:01:28.770> and<00:01:28.829> show<00:01:29.100> you<00:01:31.759> so

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
and I'll slide it out and show you so

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.450 
and I'll slide it out and show you so
here<00:01:32.790> would<00:01:33.060> be<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:33.299> first<00:01:33.329> position<00:01:34.460> she

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
here would be the first position she

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.330 
here would be the first position she
would<00:01:35.579> take<00:01:35.729> your<00:01:36.000> pin<00:01:36.420> here<00:01:37.070> slide<00:01:38.070> it<00:01:38.220> all

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
would take your pin here slide it all

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.760 
would take your pin here slide it all
the<00:01:38.369> way<00:01:38.490> through<00:01:38.990> this<00:01:39.990> keeps<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.380> ramp<00:01:40.560> from

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
the way through this keeps the ramp from

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.300 
the way through this keeps the ramp from
moving<00:01:40.979> so<00:01:41.970> this<00:01:42.119> gives<00:01:42.360> you<00:01:42.479> a<00:01:42.540> short<00:01:42.810> setup

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
moving so this gives you a short setup

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.679 
moving so this gives you a short setup
if<00:01:44.310> maybe<00:01:44.579> you<00:01:44.759> don't<00:01:44.909> need<00:01:45.060> quite<00:01:45.329> as<00:01:45.479> much

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
if maybe you don't need quite as much

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.760 
if maybe you don't need quite as much
where<00:01:46.470> you<00:01:46.619> could<00:01:46.770> set<00:01:46.950> it<00:01:46.979> down<00:01:47.100> there<00:01:48.770> that

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
where you could set it down there that

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.649 
where you could set it down there that
will<00:01:49.890> give<00:01:50.009> you<00:01:50.100> a<00:01:50.130> short<00:01:50.399> set<00:01:50.610> up<00:01:50.759> just<00:01:51.479> for

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
will give you a short set up just for

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:52.999 
will give you a short set up just for
comparison<00:01:51.960> we've<00:01:52.320> already<00:01:52.500> set<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:52.920> other

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
comparison we've already set the other
