00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
loving this a little tip when mixing

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.290 
loving this a little tip when mixing
prints<00:02:49.990> is<00:02:50.200> to<00:02:50.380> mix<00:02:50.620> a<00:02:50.830> bigger<00:02:51.580> print<00:02:52.060> with<00:02:52.270> a

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:52.300 
prints is to mix a bigger print with a

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:55.020 
prints is to mix a bigger print with a
smaller<00:02:52.750> busier<00:02:53.350> print<00:02:53.740> and<00:02:53.980> that's<00:02:54.610> kind<00:02:54.940> of

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
smaller busier print and that's kind of

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.360 
smaller busier print and that's kind of
what<00:02:55.210> I<00:02:55.240> have<00:02:55.570> here<00:02:55.930> but<00:02:56.560> I<00:02:56.800> think<00:02:56.860> why<00:02:57.310> this

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
what I have here but I think why this

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.640 
what I have here but I think why this
works<00:02:57.820> is<00:02:58.000> this<00:02:58.150> is<00:02:58.210> essentially<00:02:59.020> the<00:02:59.410> same

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
works is this is essentially the same

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.260 
works is this is essentially the same
print<00:02:59.980> this<00:03:00.160> shirt<00:03:00.520> is<00:03:00.730> from<00:03:00.910> the<00:03:01.060> same

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:01.270 
print this shirt is from the same

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:03.090 
print this shirt is from the same
company<00:03:01.450> these<00:03:01.840> pants<00:03:02.290> are<00:03:02.440> it's<00:03:02.830> just<00:03:03.010> a

company these pants are it's just a
different<00:03:03.520> variation<00:03:03.850> so<00:03:04.720> if<00:03:04.960> it's<00:03:05.140> the<00:03:05.230> same

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
different variation so if it's the same

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:06.570
