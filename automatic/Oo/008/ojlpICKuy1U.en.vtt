the middle of the piece using a
permanent<00:01:56.180> marker<00:01:56.450> I<00:01:56.990> just<00:01:57.380> hold<00:01:58.070> it<00:01:58.310> to<00:01:58.490> the

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
permanent marker I just hold it to the

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:05.350 
permanent marker I just hold it to the
right<00:01:58.909> amount<00:02:01.240> from<00:02:02.240> the<00:02:02.690> from<00:02:03.470> my<00:02:03.650> finger<00:02:04.360> so

right amount from the from my finger so

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.320 
right amount from the from my finger so
that<00:02:05.390> is<00:02:05.810> close<00:02:06.620> to<00:02:06.890> the<00:02:07.010> right<00:02:07.220> mark<00:02:08.030> and<00:02:08.269> I

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
that is close to the right mark and I

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.880 
that is close to the right mark and I
just<00:02:08.569> run<00:02:08.840> my<00:02:09.049> finger<00:02:09.440> down<00:02:09.619> the<00:02:09.860> middle

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
just run my finger down the middle

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:19.020 
just run my finger down the middle
doesn't<00:02:12.890> have<00:02:13.190> to<00:02:13.340> be<00:02:13.489> accurate

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:24.370 

we're<00:02:20.030> going<00:02:20.270> to<00:02:22.180> hammer<00:02:23.180> this<00:02:23.480> into<00:02:24.020> our

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
we're going to hammer this into our

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:48.910 
we're going to hammer this into our
block<00:02:27.190> using<00:02:28.190> our<00:02:28.340> tapered<00:02:29.709> nylon<00:02:30.709> hammer<00:02:47.920> now

block using our tapered nylon hammer now
I'm<00:02:49.730> just<00:02:50.000> going<00:02:50.300> to<00:02:50.360> hold<00:02:50.660> this<00:02:50.870> edgewise<00:02:51.470> on

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
I'm just going to hold this edgewise on

00:02:51.980 --> 00:03:02.110 
I'm just going to hold this edgewise on
my<00:02:52.209> handle<00:02:53.209> use<00:02:53.750> the<00:02:53.989> rawhide<00:02:54.170> hammer<00:03:01.120> and

my handle use the rawhide hammer and

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:15.370 
my handle use the rawhide hammer and
crimp<00:03:02.480> that<00:03:02.720> down<00:03:13.660> and<00:03:14.660> I'm<00:03:14.810> going<00:03:15.110> to<00:03:15.170> go

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
crimp that down and I'm going to go

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:18.990 
crimp that down and I'm going to go
through<00:03:15.620> the<00:03:15.739> rolling<00:03:16.069> mill<00:03:16.280> and<00:03:17.180> just

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
through the rolling mill and just

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:25.990 
through the rolling mill and just
flatten<00:03:20.000> that<00:03:23.920> so<00:03:24.920> that<00:03:25.130> the<00:03:25.250> middle<00:03:25.400> is<00:03:25.700> nice

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
flatten that so that the middle is nice

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.539 
flatten that so that the middle is nice
and<00:03:26.239> smooth<00:03:26.570> and<00:03:27.260> we<00:03:27.530> want<00:03:27.739> to<00:03:27.829> so<00:03:28.040> that<00:03:28.160> it<00:03:28.280> is

00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:28.549 
and smooth and we want to so that it is

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:32.740 
and smooth and we want to so that it is
just<00:03:29.920> just<00:03:30.920> enough<00:03:31.370> to<00:03:31.609> flatten<00:03:32.030> it<00:03:32.180> we<00:03:32.630> don't

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750 
just just enough to flatten it we don't

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:34.750 
just just enough to flatten it we don't
we<00:03:33.109> don't<00:03:33.260> want<00:03:33.380> to<00:03:33.620> kill<00:03:33.829> it<00:03:33.980> and<00:03:34.370> we<00:03:34.579> don't

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
we don't want to kill it and we don't

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:39.880 
we don't want to kill it and we don't
want<00:03:34.940> to<00:03:35.030> make<00:03:35.150> it<00:03:35.269> any<00:03:35.390> longer<00:03:38.739> now<00:03:39.739> we're

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:39.890 
want to make it any longer now we're

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:41.680 
want to make it any longer now we're
just<00:03:39.980> gonna<00:03:40.160> heat<00:03:40.430> this<00:03:40.609> up<00:03:40.790> again<00:03:41.120> until<00:03:41.329> it's

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:41.690 
just gonna heat this up again until it's

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:44.710 
just gonna heat this up again until it's
a<00:03:41.780> dull<00:03:42.019> red<00:03:42.640> because<00:03:43.640> we've<00:03:43.940> folded<00:03:44.239> it<00:03:44.600> and

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720 
a dull red because we've folded it and

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.280 
a dull red because we've folded it and
flattened<00:03:45.260> it<00:03:45.410> it's<00:03:46.160> work<00:03:46.489> hardens<00:03:47.290> which

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
flattened it it's work hardens which

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:49.930 
flattened it it's work hardens which
means<00:03:48.560> you<00:03:48.769> won't<00:03:48.890> be<00:03:49.130> able<00:03:49.310> to<00:03:49.400> open<00:03:49.549> this<00:03:49.880> up

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:49.940 
means you won't be able to open this up

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:54.600 
means you won't be able to open this up
until<00:03:50.900> after<00:03:51.049> you<00:03:51.410> anneal<00:03:51.769> it

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:54.610 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:58.040 

we're<00:03:55.480> just<00:03:55.660> going<00:03:55.870> to<00:03:55.930> go<00:03:56.050> from<00:03:56.260> end<00:03:56.500> to<00:03:56.590> end

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:58.050 
we're just going to go from end to end

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:17.910 
we're just going to go from end to end
and<00:03:59.050> when<00:03:59.290> it's<00:03:59.440> a<00:03:59.590> dull<00:03:59.830> red<00:04:00.270> stuff

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:17.920 

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:19.890 

I'm<00:04:18.460> shielding<00:04:19.030> the<00:04:19.120> metal<00:04:19.360> from<00:04:19.540> the<00:04:19.600> light

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900 
I'm shielding the metal from the light

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:23.810 
I'm shielding the metal from the light
so<00:04:20.200> that<00:04:20.230> I<00:04:20.410> can<00:04:20.590> actually<00:04:20.740> see<00:04:21.190> the<00:04:21.370> colors

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:27.660 

one<00:04:24.820> of<00:04:24.940> the<00:04:25.060> indicators<00:04:25.720> is<00:04:26.650> Windham<00:04:27.340> when

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:27.670 
one of the indicators is Windham when

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:30.570 
one of the indicators is Windham when
the<00:04:27.850> flame<00:04:28.180> is<00:04:28.570> turning<00:04:29.470> orange<00:04:29.860> as<00:04:30.070> it's

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:30.580 
the flame is turning orange as it's

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:33.000 
the flame is turning orange as it's
brushing<00:04:31.030> across<00:04:31.300> the<00:04:31.570> metal<00:04:31.900> it<00:04:32.590> means<00:04:32.830> the

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.010 
brushing across the metal it means the

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:34.710 
brushing across the metal it means the
metal<00:04:33.310> is<00:04:33.550> actually<00:04:33.820> up<00:04:34.240> an<00:04:34.420> annealing

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:34.720 
metal is actually up an annealing

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:40.260 
metal is actually up an annealing
temperature<00:04:35.410> so<00:04:35.710> you<00:04:35.740> can<00:04:35.980> stop<00:04:39.060> now<00:04:40.060> will

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:40.270 
temperature so you can stop now will

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:44.570 
temperature so you can stop now will
quench<00:04:40.480> this<00:04:40.750> in<00:04:40.930> water<00:04:42.540> dry<00:04:43.540> out<00:04:43.690> the<00:04:43.900> middle

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580 
quench this in water dry out the middle

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:47.540 
quench this in water dry out the middle
we're<00:04:45.580> going<00:04:45.790> to<00:04:45.910> take<00:04:46.090> a<00:04:46.120> straight<00:04:46.510> burnisher

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:47.550 
we're going to take a straight burnisher

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:49.800 
we're going to take a straight burnisher
and<00:04:48.550> work<00:04:48.790> it<00:04:48.970> in<00:04:49.120> the<00:04:49.240> end

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:49.810 
and work it in the end

00:04:49.810 --> 00:05:00.660 
and work it in the end
to<00:04:50.110> start<00:04:50.440> opening<00:04:50.830> it<00:04:50.950> up<00:04:59.250> and<00:05:00.250> now<00:05:00.430> we'll

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:00.670 
to start opening it up and now we'll

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:03.030 
to start opening it up and now we'll
just<00:05:00.850> hammer<00:05:01.120> this<00:05:01.420> over<00:05:01.750> a<00:05:01.780> ring<00:05:02.020> mandrel<00:05:02.260> to

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:03.040 
just hammer this over a ring mandrel to

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:08.020 
use your rawhide hammer on this and I'm

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:15.170 
use your rawhide hammer on this and I'm
on<00:05:08.200> the<00:05:08.350> small<00:05:08.650> end<00:05:08.920> of<00:05:09.070> the<00:05:09.280> ring<00:05:09.760> mandrel

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:15.180 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:18.900 

just<00:05:16.180> work<00:05:16.360> your<00:05:16.570> way<00:05:16.690> down<00:05:16.720> the<00:05:17.110> length<00:05:17.910> and

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:18.910 
just work your way down the length and

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:21.570 
just work your way down the length and
when<00:05:19.810> you're<00:05:19.960> open<00:05:20.320> about<00:05:20.560> this<00:05:20.830> far<00:05:21.160> that's

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:21.580 
when you're open about this far that's

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:24.000 
when you're open about this far that's
about<00:05:21.760> half<00:05:21.970> way<00:05:22.180> open<00:05:22.540> then<00:05:23.050> we<00:05:23.080> can<00:05:23.290> go<00:05:23.620> on<00:05:23.800> to

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:24.010 
about half way open then we can go on to

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:28.620 
about half way open then we can go on to
our<00:05:24.040> bracelet<00:05:24.670> mandrel<00:05:24.880> and<00:05:25.270> do<00:05:25.390> the<00:05:25.540> rest<00:05:27.630> I'm

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:28.630 
our bracelet mandrel and do the rest I'm

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:33.980 
our bracelet mandrel and do the rest I'm
just<00:05:28.690> going<00:05:29.050> to<00:05:29.080> hammer<00:05:29.290> this<00:05:29.500> around<00:05:29.890> my

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:33.990 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:36.210 

bracelet<00:05:34.990> mandrel<00:05:35.260> using<00:05:35.950> the<00:05:36.070> rawhide

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:36.220 
bracelet mandrel using the rawhide

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:38.460 
bracelet mandrel using the rawhide
hammer<00:05:36.730> the<00:05:37.540> reason<00:05:37.870> we're<00:05:38.020> using<00:05:38.050> the

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:38.470 
hammer the reason we're using the

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:40.410 
hammer the reason we're using the
rawhide<00:05:38.860> is<00:05:38.890> I<00:05:39.250> want<00:05:39.460> this<00:05:39.610> nice<00:05:39.850> and<00:05:40.090> smooth

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:40.420 
rawhide is I want this nice and smooth

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:45.260 
rawhide is I want this nice and smooth
and<00:05:40.630> shiny<00:05:41.020> and<00:05:41.500> this<00:05:42.160> won't<00:05:42.370> put<00:05:42.640> marks<00:05:42.970> in<00:05:43.150> it

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:45.270 

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:47.490 

now<00:05:46.270> we're<00:05:46.420> going<00:05:46.510> to<00:05:46.570> hold<00:05:46.720> this<00:05:46.900> around<00:05:47.290> our

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:47.500 
now we're going to hold this around our

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:55.650 
now we're going to hold this around our
round<00:05:47.830> ball<00:05:48.900> and<00:05:53.910> I'm<00:05:54.910> just<00:05:55.120> going<00:05:55.330> to<00:05:55.420> hammer

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:55.660 
round ball and I'm just going to hammer

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:58.230 
round ball and I'm just going to hammer
the<00:05:55.930> edges<00:05:56.350> but<00:05:57.250> you<00:05:57.490> can<00:05:57.640> hit<00:05:57.730> the<00:05:57.880> middle<00:05:58.120> if

00:05:58.230 --> 00:05:58.240 
the edges but you can hit the middle if

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:59.390 
the edges but you can hit the middle if
you<00:05:58.360> want<00:05:58.570> it<00:05:58.690> won't<00:05:58.810> make<00:05:59.020> any<00:05:59.080> difference

00:05:59.390 --> 00:05:59.400 
you want it won't make any difference

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:06.270 
you want it won't make any difference
but<00:06:00.400> the<00:06:00.580> idea<00:06:01.030> is<00:06:04.440> by<00:06:05.440> hitting<00:06:05.680> the<00:06:05.920> edges

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:06.280 
but the idea is by hitting the edges

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:08.100 
but the idea is by hitting the edges
that's<00:06:06.550> going<00:06:06.790> to<00:06:06.940> make<00:06:07.120> it<00:06:07.270> into<00:06:07.600> a<00:06:07.630> bit<00:06:07.900> of<00:06:08.020> a

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:08.110 
that's going to make it into a bit of a

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:11.100 
that's going to make it into a bit of a
dome<00:06:08.350> and<00:06:08.650> it'll<00:06:09.520> smooth<00:06:09.940> out<00:06:10.180> the<00:06:10.540> ripples<00:06:10.720> in

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:11.110 
dome and it'll smooth out the ripples in

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:16.890 
dome and it'll smooth out the ripples in
the<00:06:11.230> edges<00:06:13.830> so<00:06:14.830> we've<00:06:14.950> got<00:06:15.160> our<00:06:15.280> shape<00:06:15.900> now

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:16.900 
the edges so we've got our shape now

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:22.659 
the edges so we've got our shape now
we're<00:06:17.050> going<00:06:17.200> to<00:06:17.320> hallmark<00:06:18.130> it

00:06:22.659 --> 00:06:22.669 

00:06:22.669 --> 00:06:27.320 

9<00:06:23.669> to<00:06:23.940> 5<00:06:24.210> because<00:06:24.870> it's<00:06:25.229> sterling<00:06:26.330> picolit

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:27.330 
9 to 5 because it's sterling picolit

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:30.890 
9 to 5 because it's sterling picolit
publish<00:06:28.050> it<00:06:28.259> now<00:06:29.220> this<00:06:29.520> is<00:06:29.580> smooth<00:06:30.090> so<00:06:30.509> you<00:06:30.570> can

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:30.900 
publish it now this is smooth so you can

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:33.140 
publish it now this is smooth so you can
either<00:06:31.020> tumble<00:06:31.650> it<00:06:31.770> or<00:06:32.130> you<00:06:32.580> can<00:06:32.759> publish<00:06:32.940> it

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:33.150 
either tumble it or you can publish it

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:36.169
