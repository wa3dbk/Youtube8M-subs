momentum<00:03:22.470> out<00:03:22.620> of<00:03:22.740> it<00:03:22.860> and<00:03:23.040> just<00:03:23.130> you<00:03:23.460> know<00:03:23.490> you

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
momentum out of it and just you know you

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:26.360 
momentum out of it and just you know you
don't<00:03:23.760> need<00:03:23.850> to<00:03:24.000> go<00:03:24.060> crazy<00:03:24.330> heavy<00:03:24.540> and<00:03:25.530> then<00:03:25.710> do

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
don't need to go crazy heavy and then do

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.200 
don't need to go crazy heavy and then do
some<00:03:26.580> bits<00:03:27.120> and<00:03:27.270> 20<00:03:27.630> ones<00:03:27.810> which<00:03:28.410> is<00:03:28.620> a<00:03:29.090> we<00:03:30.090> did

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:30.210 
some bits and 20 ones which is a we did

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:31.550 
some bits and 20 ones which is a we did
with<00:03:30.390> back<00:03:30.600> yesterday<00:03:31.050> actually<00:03:31.290> but

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
with back yesterday actually but

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.610 
with back yesterday actually but
forearms<00:03:32.370> within<00:03:32.970> the<00:03:33.390> curl<00:03:33.630> aspect<00:03:34.440> it's

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
forearms within the curl aspect it's

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.530 
forearms within the curl aspect it's
doing<00:03:34.980> like<00:03:35.130> a<00:03:35.160> top<00:03:35.430> range<00:03:35.730> low<00:03:36.000> range<00:03:36.240> and

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
doing like a top range low range and

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.030 
doing like a top range low range and
full<00:03:36.780> range<00:03:36.960> of<00:03:37.050> motion<00:03:37.110> for<00:03:37.410> seven<00:03:37.770> seven

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
full range of motion for seven seven

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:44.690 
full range of motion for seven seven

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.480 

yeah<00:03:46.260> that<00:03:47.260> pretty<00:03:47.380> much<00:03:47.500> will<00:03:47.770> for<00:03:47.890> biceps<00:03:48.340> at

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:48.490 
yeah that pretty much will for biceps at

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:49.800 
yeah that pretty much will for biceps at
that<00:03:48.640> point<00:03:48.940> and<00:03:49.150> then<00:03:49.270> we<00:03:49.360> went<00:03:49.480> right<00:03:49.690> two

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
that point and then we went right two

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.260 
that point and then we went right two
tries<00:03:50.280> warmed<00:03:51.280> up<00:03:51.400> i<00:03:51.520> like<00:03:51.640> doing<00:03:51.790> wrote<00:03:52.060> push

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:52.270 
tries warmed up i like doing wrote push

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:54.300 
tries warmed up i like doing wrote push
downs<00:03:52.510> that<00:03:52.690> kind<00:03:52.840> of<00:03:52.870> one<00:03:52.990> on<00:03:53.110> my<00:03:53.200> elbows<00:03:53.590> you

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
downs that kind of one on my elbows you

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:55.760 
downs that kind of one on my elbows you
know<00:03:54.400> it's<00:03:54.490> cold<00:03:54.730> out<00:03:54.880> it's<00:03:55.030> winter<00:03:55.330> so

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:55.770 
know it's cold out it's winter so

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:59.490 
know it's cold out it's winter so
typically<00:03:56.770> the<00:03:57.610> my<00:03:58.450> joints<00:03:58.810> are<00:03:58.960> take<00:03:59.470> a

00:03:59.490 --> 00:03:59.500 
typically the my joints are take a

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.830 
typically the my joints are take a
little<00:03:59.650> bit<00:03:59.770> longer<00:03:59.950> to<00:04:00.190> warm<00:04:00.340> up<00:04:00.750> you<00:04:01.750> know

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
little bit longer to warm up you know

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.850 
little bit longer to warm up you know
I'm<00:04:01.990> getting<00:04:02.200> so<00:04:02.440> old<00:04:02.850> 28<00:04:03.850> but<00:04:04.690> we<00:04:05.440> started

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:05.860 
I'm getting so old 28 but we started

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:08.460 
I'm getting so old 28 but we started
with<00:04:06.040> rope<00:04:07.030> push<00:04:07.240> down<00:04:07.450> to<00:04:07.780> drop<00:04:08.080> set<00:04:08.320> on<00:04:08.440> that

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:08.470 
with rope push down to drop set on that

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:11.430 
with rope push down to drop set on that
finish<00:04:09.190> it<00:04:09.270> got<00:04:10.270> a<00:04:10.300> really<00:04:10.480> good<00:04:10.570> pump<00:04:10.959> on<00:04:11.230> that

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:11.440 
finish it got a really good pump on that

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:16.470 
finish it got a really good pump on that
and<00:04:11.709> then<00:04:11.830> we<00:04:12.280> went<00:04:12.430> over<00:04:12.580> to<00:04:12.880> a<00:04:15.150> incline<00:04:16.150> bench

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:16.480 
and then we went over to a incline bench

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:18.300 
and then we went over to a incline bench
with<00:04:17.169> machined<00:04:17.500> kind<00:04:17.769> of<00:04:17.829> turned<00:04:18.010> into<00:04:18.100> a

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.310 
with machined kind of turned into a

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:20.970 
with machined kind of turned into a
skull<00:04:18.820> crusher<00:04:19.090> have<00:04:19.870> unique<00:04:20.230> movement<00:04:20.470> that

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:20.980 
skull crusher have unique movement that

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:23.400 
skull crusher have unique movement that
you<00:04:21.160> don't<00:04:21.280> usually<00:04:21.370> see<00:04:21.579> what<00:04:22.060> the<00:04:22.150> bands<00:04:22.410> add

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:23.410 
you don't usually see what the bands add

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:25.200 
you don't usually see what the bands add
some<00:04:23.650> more<00:04:23.770> resistance<00:04:24.280> on<00:04:24.460> the<00:04:24.490> top<00:04:24.760> part<00:04:25.030> to

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
some more resistance on the top part to

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:28.320 
some more resistance on the top part to
really<00:04:25.390> start<00:04:25.900> firing<00:04:26.140> some<00:04:26.290> more<00:04:26.500> tricep<00:04:27.330> and

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:28.330 
really start firing some more tricep and

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:29.940 
really start firing some more tricep and
then<00:04:28.480> we<00:04:28.540> superset<00:04:28.930> of<00:04:28.960> that<00:04:29.169> with<00:04:29.320> the<00:04:29.350> dip

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:29.950 
then we superset of that with the dip

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:32.909 
then we superset of that with the dip
machine<00:04:30.280> from<00:04:31.000> there<00:04:31.240> we<00:04:31.450> went<00:04:31.630> to<00:04:31.919> an

00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:32.919 
machine from there we went to an

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:35.220 
machine from there we went to an
overhead<00:04:33.340> rope<00:04:33.970> and<00:04:34.210> then<00:04:34.690> we<00:04:34.840> did<00:04:34.990> a<00:04:35.020> single

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:35.230 
overhead rope and then we did a single

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:39.360 
overhead rope and then we did a single
arm<00:04:35.470> and<00:04:35.770> then<00:04:36.580> we<00:04:36.700> did<00:04:36.880> a<00:04:37.950> superset<00:04:38.950> kind<00:04:39.280> of

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:39.370 
arm and then we did a superset kind of

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:41.970 
arm and then we did a superset kind of
thing<00:04:39.580> with<00:04:39.790> the<00:04:40.720> postscript<00:04:41.290> push<00:04:41.440> ups<00:04:41.650> that

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:41.980 
thing with the postscript push ups that

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:43.710 
thing with the postscript push ups that
can<00:04:42.130> finish<00:04:42.280> it<00:04:42.520> so<00:04:42.730> pretty<00:04:43.240> much<00:04:43.330> blow<00:04:43.600> up

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:43.720 
can finish it so pretty much blow up

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:46.320 
can finish it so pretty much blow up
arms<00:04:44.290> you<00:04:45.040> know<00:04:45.130> we<00:04:45.280> got<00:04:45.760> it<00:04:45.850> done<00:04:45.940> about<00:04:46.180> an

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:46.330

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:52.300 
actually we got at least 12 to 16 sets

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:55.260 
actually we got at least 12 to 16 sets
per<00:04:52.600> bicep<00:04:53.560> and<00:04:53.590> tricep<00:04:54.130> so<00:04:54.370> plenty<00:04:54.940> of<00:04:55.030> sets

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:55.270 
per bicep and tricep so plenty of sets

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:58.469 
per bicep and tricep so plenty of sets
and<00:04:55.510> you<00:04:55.900> know<00:04:55.990> good<00:04:56.169> pace<00:04:56.410> good<00:04:56.860> workout<00:04:57.479> was

as you know starting to really crank up

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:04.440 
as you know starting to really crank up
my<00:05:02.680> offseason<00:05:03.070> and<00:05:03.430> my<00:05:03.820> weights<00:05:04.030> coming<00:05:04.270> up

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:04.450 
my offseason and my weights coming up

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:06.390 
my offseason and my weights coming up
I'm<00:05:04.630> sitting<00:05:05.050> about<00:05:05.169> 290<00:05:05.680> right<00:05:05.830> now<00:05:05.979> and<00:05:06.250> it's

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:06.400 
I'm sitting about 290 right now and it's

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.250 
I'm sitting about 290 right now and it's
still<00:05:06.550> going<00:05:06.700> to<00:05:06.820> push<00:05:07.000> try<00:05:07.330> to<00:05:07.390> we're<00:05:08.020> here<00:05:08.140> my

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:08.260 
still going to push try to we're here my

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.380 
still going to push try to we're here my
weight<00:05:08.470> as<00:05:08.680> then<00:05:08.950> I<00:05:08.979> slowly<00:05:09.669> come<00:05:09.970> down<00:05:10.000> for<00:05:10.270> my

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:10.390 
weight as then I slowly come down for my

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:12.960 
weight as then I slowly come down for my
show<00:05:10.630> so<00:05:10.990> ultimately<00:05:11.830> my<00:05:12.160> goal<00:05:12.190> is<00:05:12.550> to<00:05:12.700> think

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:12.970 
show so ultimately my goal is to think

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:14.790 
show so ultimately my goal is to think
heavier<00:05:13.240> this<00:05:13.419> year<00:05:13.660> whether<00:05:14.380> I<00:05:14.440> could<00:05:14.560> pee

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:14.800 
heavier this year whether I could pee
