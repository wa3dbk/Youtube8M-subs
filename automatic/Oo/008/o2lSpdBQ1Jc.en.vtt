00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:20.390
 hello to all here is my third proposal 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.800
 of art villas for Valentine's Day 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.900
 thought for all those girls who don't 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.269
 they have plenty of time but that 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.010
 however, they want cared for hands that 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.380
 they don't want to go there 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.450
 tinkering too much with dotter brushes is 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.030
 then used the file by trying to 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:39.690
 the first time the Chinese files and I have to say 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.440
 that at least this that I took now is not 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.809
 not bad 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.809
 I also took two other types or maybe 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.879
 one, however, I didn't use the 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.890
 glue inter is included in the kit 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:53.489
 because I don't trust too much then 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:56.610
 used my max dam glue for 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.829
 file and I must say that the result is 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.800
 perfect is really perfect and this can 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:04.229
 which I liked because as you see 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.740
 lets the color that is there shine through 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:10.470
 base therefore does not cover it completely and is 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.780
 according to me so cute indeed 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:16.320
 this one I say especially with everyone 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.330
 how many kisses I found from Chinese 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.189
 I used a little bit with the color of 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.189
 base using this yellow for whom 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:25.530
 he wants a little bit out of the lines is a 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:28.350
 yellow from the new dinner collection 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.530
 it's from spring lux wines and I like it 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.880
 a lot a day in a bit off 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:35.490
 nice eco and therefore wanted to play 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.740
 you calculate that today there is an outside 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.780
 super gray weather it's raining and I have to 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.079
 come out then I'll go out with these 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:45.060
 nail with this practically 

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:47.310
 I see this rain, I see myself 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.140
 just me though as always is 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.329
 speaking too much I leave you to the tutorial 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.649
 which of course also enough 

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:54.240
 intuitive though I hope anyway can 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.700
 be useful to someone 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.240
 nothing I send you a big kiss and see you 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.630
 the next 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.630
 Hello 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:06.610
 with the lux cnd wines would not go 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.950
 extended to the base however the red threats or 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.420
 nails so I decided to 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:13.180
 however, applying it I don't think the 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.920
 however, I wanted to garden 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.720
 apply it to the same is used 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.540
 the other pupa growth I want then and 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.550
 is in the two passes of the yellow of the 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.460
 spring collection though 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:26.890
 the framing is wrong we are those 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:29.220
 given two passes and I immediately went to 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.540
 spread the top coat of the same line 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:34.060
 also because it is a top coat that dries 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:36.940
 very quickly and so I have it 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.980
 also applied for this reason to 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.840
 speed up further is 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:44.440
 going to apply the kitchens it dries 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.670
 enamel one or two drops perugia 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.010
 at this point I have to wait for it 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:50.590
 nail polish is perfectly dry I take 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:53.830
 the max tender glue per file and apply 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:58.390
 a in inverted commas without the 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:59.740
 supervision of the fingernail of the ring finger one 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:01.630
 once the thing becomes transparent 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:05.890
 it means that it has dried and is ready 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:08.410
 to resume the file in short position 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:10.420
 a little bit like the one I like best 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.700
 so how I want the coming 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.770
 decoration on my nail please first 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.630
 a little with your fingers and then in this case 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:23.920
 I used that of this stick 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:27.040
 checked in the oar packaging well e 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.510
 I am therefore going to raise and of course the 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.370
 decorum moved over mine 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:32.350
 nail at this point all that remains is 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.120
 reapply the top coat and I apply it 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:36.459
 only on the ring finger in this case 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.080
 however very simple promotes 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:38.950
 fancy I hope so much there is 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.300
 liked 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:43.140
 I send a kiss and dinners to the next 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:43.140
 hello video
