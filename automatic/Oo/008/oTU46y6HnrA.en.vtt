Lite speaker that I'm going to be
putting<00:01:06.410> in<00:01:06.590> its<00:01:06.740> place<00:01:07.040> and<00:01:07.340> you<00:01:07.400> can<00:01:07.640> see

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:07.670 
putting in its place and you can see

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:09.670 
putting in its place and you can see
it's<00:01:08.000> pretty<00:01:08.180> much<00:01:08.450> exactly<00:01:08.660> the<00:01:09.170> same<00:01:09.380> size

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 
it's pretty much exactly the same size

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.180 
it's pretty much exactly the same size
as<00:01:10.010> the<00:01:10.760> existing<00:01:11.300> speaker<00:01:11.810> so<00:01:12.770> there<00:01:13.100> are

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:13.190 
as the existing speaker so there are

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:14.830 
as the existing speaker so there are
another<00:01:13.340> three<00:01:13.430> screws<00:01:14.180> to<00:01:14.390> holding<00:01:14.810> the

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
another three screws to holding the

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.450 
another three screws to holding the
motherboard<00:01:15.380> in<00:01:15.530> place<00:01:15.770> and<00:01:16.040> once<00:01:16.190> those<00:01:16.400> are

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
motherboard in place and once those are

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.400 
motherboard in place and once those are
removed<00:01:16.670> you<00:01:17.120> can<00:01:17.180> separate<00:01:17.810> the<00:01:17.930> speaker

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:18.410 
removed you can separate the speaker

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:23.290 
removed you can separate the speaker
from<00:01:18.560> the<00:01:18.950> case<00:01:21.340> it's<00:01:22.340> not<00:01:22.550> glued<00:01:22.850> in<00:01:23.030> there<00:01:23.060> or

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:23.300 
from the case it's not glued in there or

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.810 
from the case it's not glued in there or
anything<00:01:23.479> it<00:01:23.750> just<00:01:23.780> sits<00:01:24.170> in<00:01:24.350> that<00:01:24.530> hollow<00:01:24.830> so

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820 
anything it just sits in that hollow so

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:27.880 
anything it just sits in that hollow so
the<00:01:26.090> first<00:01:26.330> thing<00:01:26.509> we<00:01:26.630> have<00:01:26.780> to<00:01:26.930> do<00:01:27.080> is<00:01:27.229> unsold

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 
the first thing we have to do is unsold

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.400 
the first thing we have to do is unsold
are<00:01:28.100> the<00:01:28.220> wires<00:01:28.460> connecting<00:01:29.210> the<00:01:29.840> speaker<00:01:30.259> to

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:30.410 
are the wires connecting the speaker to

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:43.930 
are the wires connecting the speaker to
the<00:01:30.530> motherboard<00:01:40.330> and<00:01:42.250> now<00:01:43.250> with<00:01:43.460> those<00:01:43.640> wires

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:43.940 
the motherboard and now with those wires

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.960 
the motherboard and now with those wires
unsalted<00:01:44.750> you<00:01:45.170> can<00:01:45.380> see<00:01:45.710> the<00:01:46.100> speaker<00:01:46.820> that

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970 
unsalted you can see the speaker that

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:48.490 
unsalted you can see the speaker that
was<00:01:47.090> in<00:01:47.270> there<00:01:47.450> is<00:01:47.570> really<00:01:47.869> corroded<00:01:48.410> and

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
was in there is really corroded and

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:54.639 
was in there is really corroded and
rusted<00:01:52.330> so<00:01:53.330> now<00:01:53.479> I'm<00:01:53.539> just<00:01:53.780> going<00:01:53.990> to<00:01:54.110> unsolder

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:54.649 
rusted so now I'm just going to unsolder

00:01:54.649 --> 00:02:22.280 
rusted so now I'm just going to unsolder
the<00:01:55.009> wires<00:01:55.250> from<00:01:55.670> the<00:01:56.000> DS<00:01:56.270> Lite<00:01:56.660> speaker

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.750 

so<00:02:23.290> I'm<00:02:23.350> just<00:02:23.560> turning<00:02:23.920> up<00:02:24.010> the<00:02:24.160> wires<00:02:24.340> again

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
so I'm just turning up the wires again

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:52.520 
so I'm just turning up the wires again
with<00:02:24.970> some<00:02:25.150> new<00:02:25.180> solder

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.530 

and<00:02:53.530> now<00:02:53.739> we<00:02:53.800> can<00:02:54.040> go<00:02:54.190> ahead<00:02:54.310> on<00:02:54.730> solder<00:02:55.420> the

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
and now we can go ahead on solder the

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:10.040 
and now we can go ahead on solder the
new<00:02:55.690> speaker<00:02:56.170> into<00:02:56.440> place

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:12.750 

although<00:03:11.050> the<00:03:11.200> -<00:03:11.380> loudspeaker<00:03:12.100> fits<00:03:12.340> almost

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 
although the - loudspeaker fits almost

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.460 
although the - loudspeaker fits almost
perfectly<00:03:13.300> into<00:03:13.570> the<00:03:13.690> place<00:03:13.900> left<00:03:14.230> by<00:03:14.410> the

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
perfectly into the place left by the

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.830 
perfectly into the place left by the
existing<00:03:15.160> game<00:03:15.310> boy<00:03:15.460> color<00:03:15.580> speaker<00:03:16.180> you<00:03:16.630> do

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
existing game boy color speaker you do

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.780 
existing game boy color speaker you do
have<00:03:17.080> to<00:03:17.230> cut<00:03:17.440> away<00:03:17.590> some<00:03:17.770> of<00:03:18.010> the<00:03:18.220> plastic

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
have to cut away some of the plastic

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.960 
have to cut away some of the plastic
surrounding<00:03:19.690> the<00:03:19.810> hollow<00:03:20.280> before<00:03:21.280> the<00:03:21.640> tabs

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
surrounding the hollow before the tabs

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.870 
surrounding the hollow before the tabs
to<00:03:22.240> fit<00:03:22.770> so<00:03:23.770> you<00:03:24.070> can<00:03:24.340> see<00:03:24.550> that<00:03:24.730> it<00:03:24.850> fits

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 
to fit so you can see that it fits

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:29.160 
to fit so you can see that it fits
pretty<00:03:25.330> much<00:03:25.510> perfectly<00:03:26.080> now<00:03:26.320> I<00:03:27.750> just<00:03:28.750> have<00:03:29.140> to

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:29.170 
pretty much perfectly now I just have to

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:30.600 
pretty much perfectly now I just have to
cut<00:03:29.470> away<00:03:29.560> a<00:03:29.680> little<00:03:29.890> bit<00:03:30.010> more<00:03:30.340> from<00:03:30.580> the

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:30.610 
cut away a little bit more from the

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:34.500 
cut away a little bit more from the
bottom<00:03:31.440> and<00:03:32.700> that's<00:03:33.700> it<00:03:34.000> that's<00:03:34.120> the<00:03:34.300> new

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
bottom and that's it that's the new

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.020 
bottom and that's it that's the new
speaker<00:03:35.020> in<00:03:35.140> place<00:03:35.440> and<00:03:35.830> I've<00:03:36.280> replaced<00:03:36.760> the

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
speaker in place and I've replaced the

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:41.520 
speaker in place and I've replaced the
motherboard<00:03:37.510> so<00:03:39.810> I'm<00:03:40.810> just<00:03:40.990> putting<00:03:41.260> it<00:03:41.380> back

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
motherboard so I'm just putting it back

00:03:41.530 --> 00:04:00.180 
motherboard so I'm just putting it back
together<00:03:41.770> again<00:03:42.040> now<00:03:58.080> and<00:03:59.080> replacing<00:04:00.070> the

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:00.190 
together again now and replacing the

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:19.289 
together again now and replacing the
batteries<00:04:07.230> and<00:04:08.230> putting<00:04:08.620> the<00:04:08.709> gamin<00:04:17.130> and<00:04:18.299> you

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:19.299 
batteries and putting the gamin and you

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:20.789 
batteries and putting the gamin and you
can<00:04:19.450> hear<00:04:19.630> immediately<00:04:20.230> that<00:04:20.410> the<00:04:20.500> sound

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:20.799 
can hear immediately that the sound

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:22.500 
can hear immediately that the sound
coming<00:04:21.070> from<00:04:21.190> the<00:04:21.370> new<00:04:21.549> speaker<00:04:21.910> is<00:04:22.090> so<00:04:22.330> much

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:22.510 
coming from the new speaker is so much

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:24.450 
coming from the new speaker is so much
clearer<00:04:22.900> and<00:04:23.020> louder<00:04:23.200> than<00:04:23.800> the<00:04:23.919> existing

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.460 
clearer and louder than the existing

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.930 
clearer and louder than the existing
game<00:04:24.640> Boyko<00:04:25.060> speaker<00:04:25.570> and<00:04:26.100> even<00:04:27.100> a<00:04:27.250> perfectly

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:27.940 
game Boyko speaker and even a perfectly

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:32.969 
game Boyko speaker and even a perfectly
working<00:04:28.419> gameboy<00:04:28.780> color<00:04:29.050> speaker<00:04:31.650> so<00:04:32.650> this<00:04:32.830> is

00:04:32.969 --> 00:04:32.979 
working gameboy color speaker so this is

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:34.890 
working gameboy color speaker so this is
a<00:04:33.010> really<00:04:33.460> easy<00:04:33.490> mod<00:04:34.060> to<00:04:34.240> do<00:04:34.390> it<00:04:34.510> only<00:04:34.660> took

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900 
a really easy mod to do it only took

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.530 
a really easy mod to do it only took
about<00:04:35.169> 15<00:04:35.740> or<00:04:36.010> 20<00:04:36.460> minutes<00:04:36.640> from<00:04:36.910> start<00:04:37.330> to

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:37.540 
about 15 or 20 minutes from start to

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:38.040 
about 15 or 20 minutes from start to
finish

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.050 
finish

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:40.230 
finish
there<00:04:38.530> are<00:04:38.590> only<00:04:38.680> two<00:04:39.040> ways<00:04:39.250> to<00:04:39.580> solder<00:04:40.030> and

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.240 
there are only two ways to solder and

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.909 
there are only two ways to solder and
then<00:04:40.540> a<00:04:40.600> little<00:04:40.900> bit<00:04:41.110> of<00:04:41.200> the<00:04:41.290> case<00:04:41.530> to<00:04:41.740> cut

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:41.919 
then a little bit of the case to cut

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:44.130 
then a little bit of the case to cut
away
