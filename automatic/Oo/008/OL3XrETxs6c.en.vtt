00:04:42.379 --> 00:04:42.389 
these uh it has another pilot where it's

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:45.409 
these uh it has another pilot where it's
like<00:04:42.539> flames<00:04:43.069> almost<00:04:44.069> so<00:04:44.940> what<00:04:45.090> you<00:04:45.210> want<00:04:45.360> to

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:45.419 
like flames almost so what you want to

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:46.760 
like flames almost so what you want to
do<00:04:45.539> is<00:04:45.690> you<00:04:45.720> want<00:04:45.840> to<00:04:46.050> kind<00:04:46.259> of<00:04:46.319> seen<00:04:46.590> you<00:04:46.680> like

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:46.770 
do is you want to kind of seen you like

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:50.150 
do is you want to kind of seen you like
that<00:04:46.830> you<00:04:47.280> want<00:04:47.430> to<00:04:47.520> give<00:04:47.729> it<00:04:47.759> a<00:04:48.710> by<00:04:49.710> hundred

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.160 
that you want to give it a by hundred

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:51.980 
that you want to give it a by hundred
percent<00:04:50.460> saturation<00:04:50.639> on<00:04:51.240> the<00:04:51.330> flame<00:04:51.569> I<00:04:51.840> mean

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:51.990 
percent saturation on the flame I mean

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:58.850 
percent saturation on the flame I mean
on<00:04:52.139> that<00:04:52.460> and<00:04:54.889> about<00:04:56.810> 45<00:04:57.810> 45<00:04:58.410> percent

00:04:58.850 --> 00:04:58.860 
on that and about 45 45 percent

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:03.879 
on that and about 45 45 percent
lightness<00:04:59.340> and<00:04:59.550> you<00:05:00.060> have<00:05:00.240> that<00:05:00.479> right<00:05:00.539> there

00:05:03.879 --> 00:05:03.889 

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:09.140 

so<00:05:04.889> the<00:05:05.039> switch<00:05:05.340> the<00:05:06.120> switches<00:05:06.660> are<00:05:08.030> kind<00:05:09.030> of

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.150 
so the switch the switches are kind of

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:12.020 
so the switch the switches are kind of
almost<00:05:09.389> like<00:05:10.020> let<00:05:10.949> me<00:05:10.979> see<00:05:11.250> let<00:05:11.430> me<00:05:11.490> see<00:05:11.580> it's

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:12.030 
almost like let me see let me see it's

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:14.960 
almost like let me see let me see it's
kind<00:05:12.360> of<00:05:12.570> greatest<00:05:13.110> but<00:05:14.039> it's<00:05:14.160> also<00:05:14.340> white<00:05:14.759> I

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:14.970 
kind of greatest but it's also white I

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:17.120 
kind of greatest but it's also white I
mean<00:05:15.150> it's<00:05:15.330> also<00:05:15.509> white<00:05:15.870> it's<00:05:16.050> also<00:05:16.199> so<00:05:16.530> what

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:17.130 
mean it's also white it's also so what

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:19.779 
mean it's also white it's also so what
we're<00:05:17.250> going<00:05:17.370> to<00:05:17.490> do<00:05:17.580> is<00:05:17.789> we're<00:05:18.690> gonna<00:05:18.840> add

00:05:19.779 --> 00:05:19.789 
we're going to do is we're gonna add

00:05:19.789 --> 00:05:24.980 
we're going to do is we're gonna add
about<00:05:21.020> right<00:05:22.020> there<00:05:22.349> so<00:05:23.280> about<00:05:23.610> I<00:05:23.970> mean<00:05:24.840> you

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:24.990 
about right there so about I mean you

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:26.420 
about right there so about I mean you
could've<00:05:25.289> did<00:05:25.440> it<00:05:25.530> without<00:05:25.650> the<00:05:25.889> gray<00:05:26.039> so<00:05:26.310> I

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:26.430 
could've did it without the gray so I

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:29.980 
could've did it without the gray so I
mean<00:05:26.580> without<00:05:26.940> going<00:05:27.210> to<00:05:27.360> look<00:05:27.479> great<00:05:27.599> but<00:05:28.349> I'm

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:29.990 
mean without going to look great but I'm

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:34.670 
mean without going to look great but I'm
about<00:05:30.990> 80%<00:05:31.259> on<00:05:31.979> the<00:05:32.159> light<00:05:32.370> I<00:05:32.550> lightness<00:05:33.500> 0%<00:05:34.500> on

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:34.680 
about 80% on the light I lightness 0% on

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:37.760 
about 80% on the light I lightness 0% on
the<00:05:34.770> saturation<00:05:35.900> so<00:05:36.900> we're<00:05:37.050> gonna<00:05:37.139> do<00:05:37.320> a<00:05:37.349> quick

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:37.770 
the saturation so we're gonna do a quick

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:41.170 
the saturation so we're gonna do a quick
three<00:05:38.310> another<00:05:38.699> quick<00:05:38.940> 360<00:05:39.539> view<00:05:39.870> on<00:05:39.990> this<00:05:40.169> and

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:41.180 
three another quick 360 view on this and

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:44.959 
three another quick 360 view on this and
as<00:05:42.180> you<00:05:42.389> know<00:05:42.570> the<00:05:43.080> nike<00:05:43.500> are<00:05:43.740> the<00:05:44.430> nike<00:05:44.759> mag

00:05:44.959 --> 00:05:44.969 
as you know the nike are the nike mag

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:47.629 
as you know the nike are the nike mag
has<00:05:45.240> a<00:05:45.270> strap<00:05:45.719> on<00:05:45.930> it<00:05:46.110> and<00:05:46.259> it's<00:05:47.190> kind<00:05:47.250> of<00:05:47.490> like

00:05:47.629 --> 00:05:47.639 
has a strap on it and it's kind of like

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:49.129 
has a strap on it and it's kind of like
gamma<00:05:47.940> blue<00:05:48.270> so<00:05:48.509> that's<00:05:48.719> what<00:05:48.840> we're<00:05:48.960> going<00:05:49.050> to

00:05:49.129 --> 00:05:49.139 
gamma blue so that's what we're going to

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:50.810 
gamma blue so that's what we're going to
make<00:05:49.199> that<00:05:49.409> logo<00:05:49.830> right<00:05:49.979> there<00:05:50.009> that<00:05:50.340> logo<00:05:50.699> is

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:50.820 
make that logo right there that logo is

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:54.230 
make that logo right there that logo is
going<00:05:50.969> to<00:05:51.060> be<00:05:51.120> gamma<00:05:51.360> blue<00:05:52.370> or<00:05:53.370> you<00:05:53.909> can<00:05:54.060> make

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:54.240 
going to be gamma blue or you can make

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:56.930 
going to be gamma blue or you can make
it<00:05:54.360> the<00:05:54.479> same<00:05:54.719> blue<00:05:55.080> as<00:05:55.289> you<00:05:55.949> are<00:05:56.159> made<00:05:56.520> made
