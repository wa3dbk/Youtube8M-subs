CNN I'll give you behind the scenes look

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.959 
CNN I'll give you behind the scenes look
at<00:00:31.380> some<00:00:31.500> of<00:00:31.590> our<00:00:31.710> specialty<00:00:32.099> cameras<00:00:32.520> this<00:00:32.910> is

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
at some of our specialty cameras this is

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.330 
at some of our specialty cameras this is
where<00:00:33.270> we<00:00:33.360> consider<00:00:33.750> a<00:00:33.840> small<00:00:33.989> or<00:00:34.710> a<00:00:34.770> standard

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
where we consider a small or a standard

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.200 
where we consider a small or a standard
jib<00:00:36.000> and<00:00:36.329> as<00:00:36.630> you<00:00:36.750> see<00:00:36.989> it's<00:00:37.170> a<00:00:37.260> tripod<00:00:37.770> a<00:00:38.219> long

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
jib and as you see it's a tripod a long

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.350 
jib and as you see it's a tripod a long
bar<00:00:39.570> with<00:00:40.290> a<00:00:40.320> camera<00:00:40.770> on<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:41.040> end<00:00:41.070> and<00:00:41.399> the

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
bar with a camera on the end and the

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.030 
bar with a camera on the end and the
reason<00:00:42.390> we<00:00:42.719> have<00:00:42.870> it<00:00:42.989> so<00:00:43.170> small<00:00:43.410> in<00:00:43.620> here<00:00:43.920> is

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
reason we have it so small in here is

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.500 
reason we have it so small in here is
because<00:00:44.250> you<00:00:44.550> see<00:00:44.760> this<00:00:44.910> is<00:00:45.059> a<00:00:45.090> working

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
because you see this is a working

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.770 
because you see this is a working
newsroom<00:00:45.989> but<00:00:46.980> it<00:00:47.100> can<00:00:47.309> be<00:00:47.489> much<00:00:47.670> larger<00:00:47.910> it

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
newsroom but it can be much larger it

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.510 
newsroom but it can be much larger it
can<00:00:48.960> go<00:00:49.079> out<00:00:49.230> thirty<00:00:49.530> feet<00:00:49.800> from<00:00:50.039> this<00:00:50.219> base

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
can go out thirty feet from this base

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.810 
can go out thirty feet from this base
and<00:00:51.050> the<00:00:52.050> camera<00:00:52.410> sits<00:00:52.649> on<00:00:52.800> top<00:00:53.039> it's<00:00:53.550> very

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
and the camera sits on top it's very

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.959 
and the camera sits on top it's very
simple<00:00:54.149> operation<00:00:54.300> you<00:00:54.840> see<00:00:55.370> it<00:00:56.370> pivots<00:00:56.610> up

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
simple operation you see it pivots up

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.729 
simple operation you see it pivots up
and<00:00:57.149> down<00:00:57.329> left<00:00:57.960> and<00:00:58.170> right<00:00:58.410> from<00:00:58.710> the

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
and down left and right from the

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.720 
and down left and right from the
triangle<00:00:59.460> and<00:00:59.670> then<00:01:00.539> right<00:01:00.719> here<00:01:01.520> we<00:01:02.520> have<00:01:02.699> a

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
triangle and then right here we have a

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:08.030 
triangle and then right here we have a
motor<00:01:03.530> that<00:01:04.530> allows<00:01:05.489> this<00:01:05.880> camera<00:01:06.869> to<00:01:07.830> turn

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
motor that allows this camera to turn

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.609 
motor that allows this camera to turn
like<00:01:08.400> this<00:01:08.729> and<00:01:09.090> then<00:01:09.840> we<00:01:09.930> have<00:01:10.080> a<00:01:10.110> motor<00:01:10.409> up

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
like this and then we have a motor up

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.510 
like this and then we have a motor up
here<00:01:11.810> that<00:01:12.810> allows<00:01:13.619> it<00:01:13.890> to<00:01:13.920> go<00:01:14.100> up<00:01:14.189> and<00:01:14.310> down

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
here that allows it to go up and down

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.190 
here that allows it to go up and down
and<00:01:14.820> that's<00:01:15.000> all<00:01:15.299> they<00:01:15.600> are<00:01:15.630> they're<00:01:15.960> four

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
and that's all they are they're four

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.749 
and that's all they are they're four
different<00:01:16.619> movements<00:01:17.100> it's<00:01:17.460> just<00:01:17.670> the

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
different movements it's just the

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.359 
different movements it's just the
operator<00:01:18.090> has<00:01:18.360> to<00:01:18.390> know<00:01:18.630> when<00:01:18.900> he<00:01:18.990> booms<00:01:19.369> that

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
operator has to know when he booms that

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.460 
operator has to know when he booms that
the<00:01:20.490> camera<00:01:20.880> is<00:01:20.939> going<00:01:21.119> to<00:01:21.210> swing<00:01:21.570> past<00:01:22.110> your

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
the camera is going to swing past your

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.270 
the camera is going to swing past your
camera<00:01:23.180> and<00:01:24.180> I<00:01:24.479> would<00:01:24.630> lose<00:01:24.840> this<00:01:25.770> would<00:01:26.070> lose

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
camera and I would lose this would lose

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.819 
camera and I would lose this would lose
your<00:01:26.670> camera<00:01:27.030> your<00:01:27.210> shot<00:01:27.450> so<00:01:28.350> if<00:01:28.439> I<00:01:28.530> wanted<00:01:28.770> to

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829

your camera your shot so if I wanted to
keep<00:01:29.040> it<00:01:29.250> I<00:01:29.340> had<00:01:29.490> to<00:01:29.520> be<00:01:29.729> back<00:01:29.850> in<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.119> controls

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
keep it I had to be back in the controls

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.660 
keep it I had to be back in the controls
and<00:01:30.750> as<00:01:30.840> it's<00:01:31.020> going<00:01:31.079> this<00:01:31.409> way<00:01:31.619> I<00:01:31.890> have<00:01:32.189> to<00:01:32.369> pan

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
and as it's going this way I have to pan

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.640 
and as it's going this way I have to pan
left<00:01:33.259> to<00:01:34.259> keep<00:01:34.500> following<00:01:35.310> you<00:01:35.579> so<00:01:36.650> there's

left to keep following you so there's
this<00:01:38.060> mind<00:01:39.060> and<00:01:39.360> mechanical<00:01:40.229> thing<00:01:40.439> that<00:01:40.650> goes

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
this mind and mechanical thing that goes

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.190 
this mind and mechanical thing that goes
together<00:01:41.189> to<00:01:42.180> let<00:01:42.360> you<00:01:42.509> know<00:01:42.659> what<00:01:42.869> makes<00:01:43.079> a

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
together to let you know what makes a

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.740 
together to let you know what makes a
smooth<00:01:43.530> cube<00:01:44.040> move<00:01:44.280> when<00:01:44.579> it's<00:01:44.759> panning<00:01:45.270> we

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
smooth cube move when it's panning we

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.359 
smooth cube move when it's panning we
got<00:01:45.899> the<00:01:46.020> camera<00:01:46.380> monitor<00:01:46.799> here<00:01:47.009> this<00:01:47.189> is<00:01:47.340> a

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
got the camera monitor here this is a

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.550 
got the camera monitor here this is a
camera<00:01:47.880> and<00:01:48.090> this<00:01:48.420> is<00:01:48.570> what's<00:01:48.840> going<00:01:49.079> on<00:01:49.229> air

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
camera and this is what's going on air

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.620 
camera and this is what's going on air
and<00:01:50.490> a<00:01:50.640> lot<00:01:50.729> of<00:01:50.850> times<00:01:51.030> it's<00:01:51.180> good<00:01:51.360> to<00:01:51.450> know

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
and a lot of times it's good to know

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.990 
and a lot of times it's good to know
when<00:01:52.290> you're<00:01:52.500> on<00:01:52.619> air<00:01:52.890> and<00:01:53.159> also<00:01:53.369> because

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
when you're on air and also because

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.940 
when you're on air and also because
we're<00:01:54.180> at<00:01:54.270> CNN<00:01:54.689> we<00:01:54.840> have<00:01:54.990> the<00:01:55.110> crawls<00:01:55.409> and<00:01:55.860> we

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
we're at CNN we have the crawls and we

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.709 
we're at CNN we have the crawls and we

it helps us on our framing they've got a

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.959 
it helps us on our framing they've got a
motor<00:02:00.420> here<00:02:00.869> that<00:02:01.170> can<00:02:01.490> adjust<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.640> speed<00:02:02.939> of
