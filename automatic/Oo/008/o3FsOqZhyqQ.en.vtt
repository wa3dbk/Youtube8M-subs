moto a go-go dude I love your tracks
they're<00:00:46.170> all<00:00:46.379> just<00:00:46.710> really<00:00:47.010> really<00:00:47.250> well<00:00:47.399> done

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
they're all just really really well done

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.700 
they're all just really really well done
but<00:00:48.149> I<00:00:48.480> have<00:00:48.660> some<00:00:48.840> personal<00:00:49.079> problems<00:00:49.469> with

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
but I have some personal problems with

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.410 
but I have some personal problems with
this<00:00:50.190> track<00:00:50.489> in<00:00:50.670> particular<00:00:51.120> and<00:00:51.300> this

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
this track in particular and this

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.790 
this track in particular and this
hopefully<00:00:51.899> that<00:00:52.079> was<00:00:52.199> the<00:00:52.289> ugliest<00:00:52.410> with

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
hopefully that was the ugliest with

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.860 
hopefully that was the ugliest with
whichever<00:00:53.129> so<00:00:53.820> I'll<00:00:53.910> have<00:00:54.030> to<00:00:54.120> build<00:00:54.449> a<00:00:54.600> triple

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
whichever so I'll have to build a triple

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.630 
whichever so I'll have to build a triple
this<00:00:55.020> but<00:00:55.230> you<00:00:55.289> can<00:00:55.410> see<00:00:55.590> it's<00:00:56.190> actually<00:00:56.340> like

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
this but you can see it's actually like

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.700 
this but you can see it's actually like
a<00:00:56.670> quad<00:00:57.059> quad<00:00:57.300> quad<00:00:57.690> I<00:00:57.870> think<00:00:58.289> if<00:00:58.440> you

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
a quad quad quad I think if you

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.080 
a quad quad quad I think if you
Whitledge<00:00:59.219> through<00:00:59.489> every<00:00:59.730> little<00:00:59.969> rhythm

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
Whitledge through every little rhythm

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.510 
Whitledge through every little rhythm
there<00:01:00.449> I'm<00:01:01.140> gonna<00:01:01.289> case<00:01:01.559> this<00:01:01.770> triple<00:01:02.160> I<00:01:02.250> think

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
there I'm gonna case this triple I think

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
there I'm gonna case this triple I think
it's<00:01:03.090> kind<00:01:03.270> of<00:01:03.300> lame<00:01:03.799> but<00:01:05.060> that's<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.299> problem

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
it's kind of lame but that's the problem

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:07.789 
it's kind of lame but that's the problem
I<00:01:06.689> have<00:01:06.810> with<00:01:06.900> this<00:01:07.020> track<00:01:07.260> there's<00:01:07.500> a<00:01:07.560> few

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
I have with this track there's a few

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.510 
I have with this track there's a few
rhythms<00:01:08.100> where<00:01:08.340> it<00:01:08.520> to<00:01:08.670> hit<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:08.820> big<00:01:09.150> line<00:01:10.520> you

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
rhythms where it to hit the big line you

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.590 
rhythms where it to hit the big line you
have<00:01:11.610> to<00:01:11.640> do<00:01:11.790> a<00:01:11.820> whip<00:01:12.000> glitch<00:01:12.210> and<00:01:12.360> that's

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
have to do a whip glitch and that's

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.469 
have to do a whip glitch and that's
usually<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.020> case<00:01:13.140> of<00:01:13.470> a<00:01:13.590> lot<00:01:13.799> of<00:01:13.950> tracks<00:01:14.479> but

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
usually the case of a lot of tracks but

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.780 
usually the case of a lot of tracks but
the<00:01:15.750> problem<00:01:16.080> I<00:01:16.140> have<00:01:16.340> specifically<00:01:17.340> with<00:01:17.549> why

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
the problem I have specifically with why

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.800 
the problem I have specifically with why
it<00:01:18.119> bothers<00:01:18.450> me<00:01:18.479> on<00:01:18.780> this<00:01:18.990> track<00:01:19.350> is<00:01:19.700> that<00:01:20.810> the

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
it bothers me on this track is that the

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:22.999 
it bothers me on this track is that the
lines<00:01:22.020> that<00:01:22.200> you're<00:01:22.259> trying<00:01:22.500> to<00:01:22.530> hit<00:01:22.680> aren't

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
lines that you're trying to hit aren't

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.100 
lines that you're trying to hit aren't
necessarily<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:24.030> most<00:01:24.210> unrealistic<00:01:24.750> I<00:01:24.990> mean

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
necessarily the most unrealistic I mean

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.240 
necessarily the most unrealistic I mean
that<00:01:25.229> quad<00:01:25.439> quad<00:01:25.590> quad<00:01:25.830> is<00:01:26.009> a<00:01:26.070> little

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
that quad quad quad is a little

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.690 
that quad quad quad is a little
unrealistic<00:01:26.810> but<00:01:27.810> I<00:01:28.170> guess<00:01:29.009> it's<00:01:29.189> more<00:01:29.400> just

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
unrealistic but I guess it's more just

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.649 
unrealistic but I guess it's more just
like<00:01:29.850> with<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.600> bike<00:01:30.840> and<00:01:31.110> where<00:01:32.240> it<00:01:33.240> looks

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
like with the bike and where it looks

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.090 
like with the bike and where it looks
like<00:01:33.780> you're<00:01:34.020> gonna<00:01:34.140> jump<00:01:34.470> in<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.890> game

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
like you're gonna jump in the game

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.340 
like you're gonna jump in the game
physics<00:01:35.549> it's<00:01:36.270> like<00:01:36.450> oh<00:01:36.630> you<00:01:36.689> gotta<00:01:37.020> clear<00:01:37.320> it

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
physics it's like oh you gotta clear it

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.859 
physics it's like oh you gotta clear it
to<00:01:37.500> there<00:01:37.850> but<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:39.000> only<00:01:39.119> way<00:01:39.299> to<00:01:39.360> really<00:01:39.600> do

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
to there but the only way to really do

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.359 
to there but the only way to really do
it<00:01:40.020> is<00:01:40.200> to<00:01:40.350> do<00:01:40.470> it<00:01:40.530> with<00:01:40.619> a<00:01:40.650> whip<00:01:40.799> push<00:01:41.009> and<00:01:41.250> I'm

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
it is to do it with a whip push and I'm

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.069 
it is to do it with a whip push and I'm
not<00:01:41.520> saying<00:01:41.729> these<00:01:41.970> gaps<00:01:42.240> are<00:01:42.420> impossible

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
not saying these gaps are impossible

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:44.510 
not saying these gaps are impossible
without<00:01:43.229> a<00:01:43.380> whip<00:01:43.560> glitch<00:01:43.770> because<00:01:44.159> I'm<00:01:44.340> sure

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
without a whip glitch because I'm sure

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.730 
without a whip glitch because I'm sure
if<00:01:44.610> you<00:01:44.909> hit<00:01:45.090> everything<00:01:45.390> totally<00:01:46.259> perfect

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
if you hit everything totally perfect

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.109 
if you hit everything totally perfect
and<00:01:46.860> you<00:01:46.950> have<00:01:47.040> the<00:01:47.130> right<00:01:47.310> bike<00:01:47.490> settings<00:01:47.939> for

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
and you have the right bike settings for

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.149 
and you have the right bike settings for
gaps<00:01:48.360> like<00:01:48.600> that<00:01:48.810> then<00:01:49.320> maybe<00:01:49.560> you<00:01:49.710> can<00:01:49.829> clear

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
gaps like that then maybe you can clear

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.359 
gaps like that then maybe you can clear
but<00:01:50.909> to<00:01:51.270> clear<00:01:52.079> these<00:01:52.229> big<00:01:52.470> gaps<00:01:52.710> I<00:01:52.979> kind<00:01:53.340> of

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
but to clear these big gaps I kind of

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:54.620 
but to clear these big gaps I kind of
ruined<00:01:53.549> it<00:01:53.729> as<00:01:53.820> you<00:01:53.939> can<00:01:54.030> see<00:01:54.090> I'm<00:01:54.329> not<00:01:54.479> the

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
ruined it as you can see I'm not the

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:55.999 
ruined it as you can see I'm not the
greatest<00:01:54.990> person<00:01:55.140> at<00:01:55.409> what<00:01:55.530> glitches<00:01:55.680> because

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
greatest person at what glitches because

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.209 
greatest person at what glitches because
I<00:01:56.100> completely<00:01:56.520> despise<00:01:57.180> them<00:01:57.509> and<00:01:58.469> those<00:01:59.100> of

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
I completely despise them and those of

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:00.380 
I completely despise them and those of
you<00:01:59.280> that<00:01:59.399> don't<00:01:59.579> know<00:01:59.700> what<00:01:59.790> it<00:02:00.000> is<00:02:00.060> basically

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
you that don't know what it is basically

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.749 
you that don't know what it is basically
just<00:02:00.600> let<00:02:00.960> you<00:02:01.170> go<00:02:01.380> farther<00:02:01.799> by<00:02:02.219> just<00:02:02.579> throwing

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
just let you go farther by just throwing

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.120 
just let you go farther by just throwing
the<00:02:02.939> bike<00:02:03.119> forward<00:02:03.540> and<00:02:03.689> doing<00:02:03.810> a<00:02:04.020> whip<00:02:04.200> in<00:02:05.009> a

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
the bike forward and doing a whip in a

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.640 
the bike forward and doing a whip in a
specific<00:02:05.450> way<00:02:06.450> I<00:02:06.719> guess

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:07.650 
specific way I guess

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:11.540 
specific way I guess
so<00:02:08.280> anyway<00:02:08.580> it<00:02:09.000> it<00:02:09.630> just<00:02:09.899> bugs<00:02:10.229> me<00:02:10.560> that<00:02:10.890> the

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
so anyway it it just bugs me that the

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.610 
so anyway it it just bugs me that the
lines<00:02:11.760> that<00:02:12.060> it<00:02:12.120> looks<00:02:12.570> like<00:02:12.780> you<00:02:13.230> want<00:02:13.380> to<00:02:13.530> hit

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
lines that it looks like you want to hit

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.500 
lines that it looks like you want to hit
just<00:02:13.950> with<00:02:14.070> the<00:02:14.160> physics<00:02:14.460> of<00:02:14.550> this<00:02:14.700> game<00:02:14.910> the

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
just with the physics of this game the

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:16.640 
just with the physics of this game the
only<00:02:15.690> way<00:02:15.810> you<00:02:15.900> can<00:02:16.020> really<00:02:16.140> get<00:02:16.350> them<00:02:16.470> is

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
only way you can really get them is

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.200 
only way you can really get them is
through<00:02:16.860> the<00:02:17.010> width<00:02:17.460> which<00:02:17.640> that's<00:02:18.000> the<00:02:18.060> only

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 
through the width which that's the only

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.920 
through the width which that's the only
way<00:02:18.330> you<00:02:18.390> can<00:02:18.540> do<00:02:18.630> them<00:02:18.720> at<00:02:18.810> least

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
way you can do them at least

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.470 
way you can do them at least
consistently<00:02:19.800> in<00:02:20.070> my<00:02:20.250> eyes<00:02:20.460> so<00:02:20.880> that's<00:02:21.330> the

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
consistently in my eyes so that's the

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:22.730 
consistently in my eyes so that's the
only<00:02:21.630> problem<00:02:21.780> that<00:02:21.990> I<00:02:22.110> really<00:02:22.410> have<00:02:22.530> at<00:02:22.680> the

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
only problem that I really have at the

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.190 
only problem that I really have at the
track<00:02:22.980> but<00:02:23.160> look<00:02:23.340> at<00:02:23.490> all<00:02:23.670> the<00:02:24.000> options<00:02:24.900> to<00:02:25.080> the

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
track but look at all the options to the

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.200 
track but look at all the options to the
rhythms<00:02:25.560> that<00:02:25.650> you<00:02:25.770> have<00:02:26.010> actually<00:02:26.880> this<00:02:26.970> one

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.210 
rhythms that you have actually this one

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.180 
rhythms that you have actually this one
doesn't<00:02:27.390> have<00:02:27.540> that<00:02:27.750> many<00:02:27.930> options<00:02:28.440> but<00:02:28.530> if

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
doesn't have that many options but if

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:30.650 
doesn't have that many options but if
you<00:02:29.310> had<00:02:29.430> a<00:02:29.460> perfect<00:02:29.850> whip<00:02:29.970> glitch<00:02:30.300> there<00:02:30.570> you

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
you had a perfect whip glitch there you

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:31.970 
you had a perfect whip glitch there you
can<00:02:30.780> actually<00:02:30.900> quad<00:02:31.260> out<00:02:31.530> of<00:02:31.650> there<00:02:31.770> and<00:02:31.920> it

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
can actually quad out of there and it

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.320 
can actually quad out of there and it
makes<00:02:32.100> it<00:02:32.250> nice<00:02:32.370> and<00:02:32.430> smooth<00:02:32.910> so<00:02:33.150> if<00:02:33.210> you're

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
makes it nice and smooth so if you're

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.390 
makes it nice and smooth so if you're
gonna<00:02:33.420> do<00:02:33.570> a<00:02:33.600> fast<00:02:33.840> lap<00:02:34.020> time<00:02:34.320> or<00:02:35.040> if<00:02:35.130> you<00:02:35.220> want

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
gonna do a fast lap time or if you want

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.640 
gonna do a fast lap time or if you want
to<00:02:35.430> see<00:02:35.700> a<00:02:35.730> fast<00:02:36.090> lap<00:02:36.330> time<00:02:36.570> of<00:02:36.780> like<00:02:37.320> some<00:02:37.500> whip

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
to see a fast lap time of like some whip

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.760 
to see a fast lap time of like some whip

channel I'll link it in the description
that<00:02:44.070> might<00:02:44.400> be<00:02:44.520> a<00:02:44.550> good<00:02:44.730> place<00:02:44.970> for<00:02:45.120> you<00:02:45.209> to

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
that might be a good place for you to

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:46.940 
that might be a good place for you to
see<00:02:45.480> content<00:02:45.870> like<00:02:46.080> that<00:02:46.110> you<00:02:46.440> might<00:02:46.560> not<00:02:46.770> see

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
see content like that you might not see

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.290 
see content like that you might not see
it<00:02:46.980> out<00:02:47.160> here<00:02:47.490> but<00:02:47.730> hopefully<00:02:47.970> you<00:02:48.060> can<00:02:48.090> see<00:02:48.180> it

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
it out here but hopefully you can see it

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.440 
it out here but hopefully you can see it
there<00:02:48.480> if<00:02:48.690> you're<00:02:48.840> interested<00:02:49.310> anyway<00:02:50.450> so

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
there if you're interested anyway so

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.270 
there if you're interested anyway so
there's<00:02:51.810> some<00:02:51.990> options<00:02:52.500> too<00:02:52.890> here<00:02:53.070> look<00:02:53.190> at

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
there's some options too here look at

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.670 
there's some options too here look at
this<00:02:53.370> step<00:02:53.610> on<00:02:53.760> step<00:02:53.970> off<00:02:54.150> triple<00:02:54.660> you<00:02:55.440> can<00:02:55.560> hit

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
this step on step off triple you can hit

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.290 
this step on step off triple you can hit
it<00:02:55.830> nice<00:02:55.980> and<00:02:56.040> smooth<00:02:56.580> you<00:02:56.610> can<00:02:56.880> see<00:02:57.030> sometimes

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
it nice and smooth you can see sometimes

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.150 
it nice and smooth you can see sometimes
I<00:02:57.540> drop<00:02:57.810> the<00:02:57.959> front<00:02:58.200> end<00:02:58.380> a<00:02:58.440> little<00:02:58.709> bit<00:02:58.890> just

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
I drop the front end a little bit just

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.690 
I drop the front end a little bit just
to<00:02:59.310> kind<00:03:00.090> of<00:03:00.630> sure<00:03:01.050> that<00:03:01.739> you're<00:03:01.860> gonna<00:03:01.980> make

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
to kind of sure that you're gonna make

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:03.800 
to kind of sure that you're gonna make
these<00:03:02.910> gaps<00:03:03.150> if<00:03:03.420> you<00:03:03.510> think<00:03:03.630> you're<00:03:03.720> gonna

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
these gaps if you think you're gonna

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.750 
these gaps if you think you're gonna
come<00:03:03.989> up<00:03:04.020> a<00:03:04.110> little<00:03:04.200> short<00:03:04.320> but<00:03:05.190> that's<00:03:05.400> a<00:03:05.520> lot

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
come up a little short but that's a lot

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.729 
come up a little short but that's a lot
different<00:03:05.970> than<00:03:06.270> doing<00:03:06.600> like<00:03:06.810> a<00:03:06.840> big<00:03:07.230> old<00:03:07.440> whip

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
different than doing like a big old whip

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:09.949 
different than doing like a big old whip
glitch<00:03:08.040> that<00:03:08.280> makes<00:03:08.700> you<00:03:08.820> go<00:03:09.000> like<00:03:09.030> 50<00:03:09.930> feet

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
glitch that makes you go like 50 feet

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:14.570 
glitch that makes you go like 50 feet
farther<00:03:10.760> but<00:03:12.019> anyway<00:03:13.019> so<00:03:13.080> I<00:03:13.290> think<00:03:13.459> that's<00:03:14.459> all

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
farther but anyway so I think that's all

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:15.740 
farther but anyway so I think that's all
I<00:03:14.610> really<00:03:14.880> need<00:03:15.030> to<00:03:15.060> say<00:03:15.269> about<00:03:15.420> the<00:03:15.630> wave

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
I really need to say about the wave

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.930 
I really need to say about the wave
glitch<00:03:15.959> stuff<00:03:16.290> it<00:03:16.620> is<00:03:16.890> fun<00:03:17.220> and<00:03:17.459> it<00:03:17.550> takes<00:03:17.760> some

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
glitch stuff it is fun and it takes some

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.300 
glitch stuff it is fun and it takes some
skill<00:03:18.120> to<00:03:18.660> hit<00:03:19.050> some<00:03:19.590> of<00:03:19.650> these<00:03:19.739> big<00:03:20.010> gaps

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
skill to hit some of these big gaps

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.370 
skill to hit some of these big gaps
every<00:03:20.910> lap<00:03:21.090> and<00:03:21.390> stuff<00:03:21.600> like<00:03:21.780> I<00:03:21.930> haven't<00:03:22.290> done

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
every lap and stuff like I haven't done

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:26.479 
every lap and stuff like I haven't done
it<00:03:22.530> once<00:03:22.739> really<00:03:23.040> but<00:03:24.650> it<00:03:25.650> takes<00:03:25.950> skill<00:03:26.100> to<00:03:26.370> do

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
it once really but it takes skill to do

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:27.860 
it once really but it takes skill to do
that<00:03:26.670> with<00:03:26.850> the<00:03:26.940> whip<00:03:27.090> glitch<00:03:27.330> but<00:03:27.570> it's<00:03:27.720> just

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
that with the whip glitch but it's just

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.590 
that with the whip glitch but it's just
not<00:03:28.110> something<00:03:28.530> that<00:03:28.739> I<00:03:28.920> think<00:03:29.280> is<00:03:29.760> very<00:03:30.239> cool

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
not something that I think is very cool

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.470 
not something that I think is very cool
it's<00:03:31.590> just<00:03:31.709> kind<00:03:31.890> of<00:03:31.920> like<00:03:31.980> X<00:03:32.640> the<00:03:33.000> next<00:03:33.239> boy

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
it's just kind of like X the next boy

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.920 
it's just kind of like X the next boy
kind<00:03:33.780> of<00:03:33.840> thing<00:03:34.019> but<00:03:34.350> anyway<00:03:34.890> I<00:03:35.670> hate<00:03:36.540> being<00:03:36.750> so

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
kind of thing but anyway I hate being so

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.720 
kind of thing but anyway I hate being so
negative<00:03:37.110> for<00:03:37.739> too<00:03:37.890> much<00:03:38.040> of<00:03:38.190> the<00:03:38.280> video<00:03:38.549> this

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
negative for too much of the video this

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.210 
negative for too much of the video this
is<00:03:38.790> a<00:03:38.940> really<00:03:39.299> really<00:03:39.450> great<00:03:39.690> track<00:03:40.049> just<00:03:41.040> look

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
is a really really great track just look

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.100 
is a really really great track just look
at<00:03:41.340> all<00:03:41.489> the<00:03:41.640> berms<00:03:41.910> and<00:03:42.150> take<00:03:42.390> skill<00:03:42.780> to<00:03:42.959> kind

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.110 
at all the berms and take skill to kind

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:44.900 
at all the berms and take skill to kind
of<00:03:43.200> get<00:03:43.380> into<00:03:43.530> them<00:03:43.799> carry<00:03:44.130> your<00:03:44.340> speed<00:03:44.519> and

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
of get into them carry your speed and

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:46.580 
of get into them carry your speed and
whatnot<00:03:45.239> you<00:03:45.840> can<00:03:45.959> do<00:03:46.080> a<00:03:46.110> different<00:03:46.260> rhythm

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
whatnot you can do a different rhythm

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:47.930 
whatnot you can do a different rhythm
through<00:03:46.920> here<00:03:47.190> you<00:03:47.280> can<00:03:47.340> actually<00:03:47.790> do<00:03:47.910> a

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
through here you can actually do a

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.670 
through here you can actually do a
little<00:03:48.180> triple<00:03:48.510> at<00:03:48.570> the<00:03:48.630> beginning<00:03:49.019> but<00:03:49.530> for

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
little triple at the beginning but for

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:50.870 
little triple at the beginning but for
some<00:03:49.799> reason<00:03:50.040> I<00:03:50.100> like<00:03:50.130> hitting<00:03:50.610> that<00:03:50.670> line

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:50.880 
some reason I like hitting that line

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.460 
some reason I like hitting that line
that<00:03:51.090> I'm<00:03:51.180> hitting<00:03:51.330> there<00:03:51.540> and<00:03:51.810> again<00:03:52.230> here

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
that I'm hitting there and again here

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.220 
that I'm hitting there and again here
you<00:03:52.560> can<00:03:52.680> actually<00:03:52.769> jump<00:03:53.070> over<00:03:53.660> then<00:03:54.660> triple

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
you can actually jump over then triple

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.229 
you can actually jump over then triple
and<00:03:55.470> then<00:03:56.130> you<00:03:56.250> jump<00:03:56.489> all<00:03:56.670> the<00:03:56.700> way<00:03:56.850> over<00:03:57.120> the

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239 
and then you jump all the way over the

00:03:57.239 --> 00:03:58.970 
and then you jump all the way over the
table<00:03:57.630> I<00:03:57.690> think<00:03:57.989> maybe<00:03:58.230> not<00:03:58.470> maybe<00:03:58.739> it's<00:03:58.920> just

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
table I think maybe not maybe it's just

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:00.320 
table I think maybe not maybe it's just
a<00:03:59.100> step<00:03:59.310> on<00:03:59.430> but<00:03:59.640> if<00:03:59.700> you<00:03:59.760> jump<00:03:59.970> over<00:04:00.090> that

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:00.330 
a step on but if you jump over that

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:01.670 
a step on but if you jump over that
table<00:04:00.570> then<00:04:00.810> you<00:04:00.900> end<00:04:01.110> yourself<00:04:01.470> with<00:04:01.650> a

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
table then you end yourself with a

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.680 
table then you end yourself with a
double<00:04:02.310> so<00:04:02.610> it's<00:04:02.760> nice<00:04:02.940> you<00:04:03.090> double<00:04:03.360> into<00:04:03.660> the

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
double so it's nice you double into the

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.020 
double so it's nice you double into the
corner<00:04:03.810> big<00:04:04.650> triple<00:04:04.920> always<00:04:05.400> fun<00:04:05.640> just<00:04:05.880> throw

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
corner big triple always fun just throw

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:07.970 
corner big triple always fun just throw
a<00:04:06.060> big<00:04:06.239> old<00:04:06.390> whip<00:04:06.540> over<00:04:06.720> and<00:04:06.870> this<00:04:07.410> is<00:04:07.590> so<00:04:07.799> much

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
a big old whip over and this is so much

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.250 
a big old whip over and this is so much
fun<00:04:08.220> to<00:04:08.370> just<00:04:08.459> hit<00:04:08.790> this<00:04:08.910> it<00:04:09.450> was<00:04:09.600> good<00:04:09.870> I<00:04:10.049> hit

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
fun to just hit this it was good I hit

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.350 
fun to just hit this it was good I hit
the<00:04:10.350> reflex<00:04:10.709> nice<00:04:10.920> and<00:04:11.100> early<00:04:11.220> and<00:04:11.790> land<00:04:12.090> Oh

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:12.360 
the reflex nice and early and land Oh

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:13.940 
the reflex nice and early and land Oh
what<00:04:12.810> that<00:04:13.110> looks<00:04:13.290> perfect

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950 
what that looks perfect

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:16.129 
what that looks perfect
usually<00:04:14.489> if<00:04:14.700> you<00:04:14.790> land<00:04:15.060> it<00:04:15.269> on<00:04:15.450> the<00:04:15.690> downside

00:04:16.129 --> 00:04:16.139 
usually if you land it on the downside

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:17.020 
usually if you land it on the downside
of<00:04:16.200> one<00:04:16.410> of<00:04:16.500> the<00:04:16.560> loops<00:04:16.680> you

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:17.030 
of one of the loops you

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:18.789 
of one of the loops you
and<00:04:17.209> it<00:04:17.299> obviously<00:04:17.420> but<00:04:18.260> it's<00:04:18.380> just<00:04:18.440> not<00:04:18.650> the

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:18.799 
and it obviously but it's just not the

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:20.860 
and it obviously but it's just not the
fastest<00:04:19.190> way<00:04:19.340> to<00:04:19.370> go<00:04:19.670> it's<00:04:19.880> just<00:04:19.940> just<00:04:20.570> not

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:20.870 
fastest way to go it's just just not

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:23.410 
fastest way to go it's just just not
it's<00:04:21.230> just<00:04:21.380> worthless<00:04:21.920> really<00:04:22.460> but<00:04:22.940> it's<00:04:23.210> a

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:23.420 
it's just worthless really but it's a

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:24.879 
it's just worthless really but it's a
it's<00:04:23.690> a<00:04:23.750> lot<00:04:23.870> of<00:04:24.020> fun<00:04:24.170> to<00:04:24.290> just<00:04:24.410> jump<00:04:24.620> in<00:04:24.740> there

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:24.889 
it's a lot of fun to just jump in there

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:28.800 
it's a lot of fun to just jump in there
a<00:04:24.950> handful<00:04:25.370> of<00:04:25.400> times<00:04:26.889> and<00:04:27.889> through<00:04:28.160> here<00:04:28.460> I

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 
a handful of times and through here I

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:31.090 
a handful of times and through here I
think<00:04:29.810> you<00:04:29.900> can<00:04:30.080> hit<00:04:30.350> you<00:04:30.590> might<00:04:30.830> you<00:04:30.950> can

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:31.100 
think you can hit you might you can

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:32.409 
think you can hit you might you can
probably<00:04:31.250> hit<00:04:31.430> this<00:04:31.580> quad<00:04:31.910> I'm<00:04:32.150> kind<00:04:32.389> of

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:32.419 
probably hit this quad I'm kind of

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:33.550 
probably hit this quad I'm kind of
messed<00:04:32.600> that<00:04:32.750> up<00:04:32.810> but<00:04:33.050> you<00:04:33.110> probably<00:04:33.380> hit<00:04:33.470> the

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:33.560 
messed that up but you probably hit the

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.710 
messed that up but you probably hit the
quad<00:04:33.800> without<00:04:34.550> a<00:04:34.580> whip<00:04:34.850> glitch<00:04:35.090> but<00:04:35.389> again

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:35.720 
quad without a whip glitch but again

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:36.850 
quad without a whip glitch but again
you'd<00:04:35.930> have<00:04:35.990> to<00:04:36.169> hit<00:04:36.260> it<00:04:36.380> just<00:04:36.530> nice<00:04:36.650> and

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:36.860 
you'd have to hit it just nice and

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:37.360 
you'd have to hit it just nice and
perfect

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 
perfect

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:39.040 
perfect
I<00:04:37.400> love<00:04:38.000> these<00:04:38.180> loops<00:04:38.389> before<00:04:38.600> the<00:04:38.810> finish

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.050 
I love these loops before the finish

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:43.330 
I love these loops before the finish
line<00:04:39.790> finish<00:04:40.790> line<00:04:41.000> Landing<00:04:41.690> is<00:04:41.870> steep<00:04:42.340> that's

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:43.340 
line finish line Landing is steep that's

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:45.370 
line finish line Landing is steep that's
not<00:04:43.580> a<00:04:43.610> big<00:04:43.880> deal<00:04:44.090> not<00:04:44.389> a<00:04:44.419> negative<00:04:44.750> at<00:04:45.050> all<00:04:45.200> but

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:45.380 
not a big deal not a negative at all but

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:46.840 
not a big deal not a negative at all but
it's<00:04:45.500> just<00:04:45.560> something<00:04:45.860> to<00:04:45.950> be<00:04:46.070> aware<00:04:46.100> of<00:04:46.370> to<00:04:46.730> be

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:46.850 
it's just something to be aware of to be

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:51.220 
it's just something to be aware of to be
able<00:04:46.940> to<00:04:47.320> hit<00:04:48.320> your<00:04:48.470> target<00:04:48.530> basically<00:04:49.340> I<00:04:50.230> need

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:51.230 
able to hit your target basically I need

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:53.380 
able to hit your target basically I need
to<00:04:51.320> hit<00:04:51.410> this<00:04:51.590> full<00:04:51.800> speed<00:04:52.070> next<00:04:52.370> time<00:04:52.550> it's

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:53.390 
to hit this full speed next time it's

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:54.550 
to hit this full speed next time it's
kind<00:04:53.600> of<00:04:53.630> hard<00:04:53.810> to<00:04:53.840> get<00:04:53.990> the<00:04:54.050> right<00:04:54.260> hop

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:54.560 
kind of hard to get the right hop

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:57.640 
kind of hard to get the right hop
through<00:04:54.860> there<00:04:54.980> sometimes<00:04:56.350> now<00:04:57.350> you<00:04:57.410> can

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:57.650 
through there sometimes now you can

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:00.010 
through there sometimes now you can
actually<00:04:57.950> do<00:04:58.220> a<00:04:58.250> double<00:04:58.820> double<00:04:59.510> which<00:04:59.840> just

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:00.020 
actually do a double double which just

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:01.510 
actually do a double double which just
seems<00:05:00.200> really<00:05:00.410> slow<00:05:00.770> but<00:05:01.040> then<00:05:01.130> you<00:05:01.190> can<00:05:01.340> jump

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:01.520 
seems really slow but then you can jump

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:04.030 
seems really slow but then you can jump
over<00:05:01.730> and<00:05:01.970> end<00:05:02.150> with<00:05:02.300> that<00:05:02.540> double<00:05:03.380> as<00:05:03.530> well<00:05:03.740> I

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:04.040 
over and end with that double as well I

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:06.390 
over and end with that double as well I
kind<00:05:04.790> of<00:05:04.820> like<00:05:04.970> doing<00:05:05.090> a<00:05:05.210> little<00:05:05.419> clip<00:05:05.780> there

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:06.400 
kind of like doing a little clip there

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.370 
kind of like doing a little clip there
to<00:05:07.400> finish<00:05:08.150> that<00:05:08.450> off<00:05:08.479> with<00:05:08.840> a<00:05:08.870> double<00:05:09.080> there

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:09.380 
to finish that off with a double there

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:11.350 
to finish that off with a double there
let's<00:05:09.979> jump<00:05:10.280> this<00:05:10.460> thing<00:05:10.610> one<00:05:10.729> more<00:05:10.880> time<00:05:10.940> why

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:11.360 
let's jump this thing one more time why

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:15.730 
let's jump this thing one more time why
why<00:05:11.690> not<00:05:13.300> dude<00:05:14.300> that<00:05:14.510> was<00:05:14.660> a<00:05:14.690> pretty<00:05:15.200> high<00:05:15.410> jump

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:15.740 
why not dude that was a pretty high jump

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:24.960 
why not dude that was a pretty high jump
Jesus<00:05:18.310> yeah<00:05:19.310> that<00:05:19.550> was<00:05:19.669> huge

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:24.970 

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:27.930 

trying<00:05:25.630> to<00:05:25.690> get<00:05:25.780> ridiculous<00:05:26.140> but<00:05:26.640> anyway<00:05:27.640> just

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:27.940 
trying to get ridiculous but anyway just

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:30.090 
trying to get ridiculous but anyway just
a<00:05:28.030> really<00:05:28.360> really<00:05:28.540> well-done<00:05:29.140> track<00:05:29.560> on<00:05:29.890> the

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:30.100 
a really really well-done track on the

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:32.340 
a really really well-done track on the
inside<00:05:30.460> line<00:05:30.730> there<00:05:31.000> ends<00:05:31.360> you<00:05:31.510> up<00:05:31.690> it's<00:05:32.140> not

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:32.350 
inside line there ends you up it's not

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:33.870 
inside line there ends you up it's not
very<00:05:32.590> exciting<00:05:33.040> because<00:05:33.130> it<00:05:33.340> just<00:05:33.520> starts<00:05:33.790> you

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:33.880 
very exciting because it just starts you

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:36.750 
very exciting because it just starts you
off<00:05:34.030> with<00:05:34.060> a<00:05:34.240> double<00:05:35.310> maybe<00:05:36.310> I'll<00:05:36.460> hit<00:05:36.580> it<00:05:36.670> on

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:36.760 
off with a double maybe I'll hit it on

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:38.190 
off with a double maybe I'll hit it on
the<00:05:36.880> next<00:05:37.060> lap<00:05:37.240> if<00:05:37.450> I<00:05:37.570> remember<00:05:37.930> but<00:05:38.080> it's

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:38.200 
the next lap if I remember but it's

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:39.510 
the next lap if I remember but it's
really<00:05:38.380> nothing<00:05:38.620> exciting<00:05:39.190> that's<00:05:39.340> why<00:05:39.460> I

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:39.520 
really nothing exciting that's why I

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.910 
really nothing exciting that's why I
haven't<00:05:39.700> particularly<00:05:40.320> gone<00:05:41.320> out<00:05:41.560> of<00:05:41.590> my<00:05:41.740> way

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:41.920 
haven't particularly gone out of my way

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:45.960 
haven't particularly gone out of my way
to<00:05:41.980> show<00:05:42.850> you<00:05:42.910> that<00:05:44.490> well<00:05:45.490> let's<00:05:45.610> just<00:05:45.790> try<00:05:45.910> to

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:45.970 
to show you that well let's just try to

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:48.950 
to show you that well let's just try to
hit<00:05:46.180> a<00:05:46.210> fun<00:05:46.480> fast<00:05:46.990> lap<00:05:47.290> here<00:05:47.590> to<00:05:47.920> end<00:05:48.520> it<00:05:48.700> off

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:48.960 
hit a fun fast lap here to end it off

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.330 
hit a fun fast lap here to end it off
you<00:05:49.960> can<00:05:50.080> actually<00:05:50.440> jump<00:05:50.650> all<00:05:50.860> the<00:05:50.950> way<00:05:51.040> over

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:51.340 
you can actually jump all the way over

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:53.070 
you can actually jump all the way over
you<00:05:51.430> can<00:05:51.550> see<00:05:51.760> I<00:05:52.030> kind<00:05:52.390> of<00:05:52.480> clipped<00:05:52.750> it<00:05:52.870> there

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:53.080 
you can see I kind of clipped it there

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:54.750 
you can see I kind of clipped it there
but<00:05:53.320> if<00:05:53.410> you<00:05:53.560> really<00:05:53.980> are<00:05:54.070> trying<00:05:54.220> and<00:05:54.580> kind<00:05:54.700> of

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:54.760 
but if you really are trying and kind of

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:56.340 
but if you really are trying and kind of
do<00:05:54.820> a<00:05:54.850> little<00:05:54.940> bit<00:05:55.090> of<00:05:55.180> a<00:05:55.270> in-game<00:05:55.720> bunny<00:05:56.080> hop

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:56.350 
do a little bit of a in-game bunny hop

00:05:56.350 --> 00:06:01.770 
do a little bit of a in-game bunny hop
you<00:05:56.890> can<00:05:57.040> get<00:05:57.190> through<00:05:57.430> it<00:05:59.820> man<00:06:00.880> you<00:06:01.360> can<00:06:01.540> quad

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:01.780 
you can get through it man you can quad

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:03.990 
you can get through it man you can quad
that<00:06:02.080> but<00:06:02.440> obviously<00:06:02.950> my<00:06:03.160> whip<00:06:03.370> glitch<00:06:03.610> skills

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:04.000 
that but obviously my whip glitch skills

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.900 
that but obviously my whip glitch skills
are<00:06:04.240> not<00:06:04.660> where<00:06:04.900> they<00:06:05.050> should<00:06:05.080> be<00:06:05.760> for<00:06:06.760> those

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:06.910 
are not where they should be for those

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:08.940 
are not where they should be for those
types<00:06:07.270> of<00:06:07.510> lines<00:06:07.720> you<00:06:08.080> know<00:06:08.230> multiple

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:08.950 
types of lines you know multiple

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:11.840 
types of lines you know multiple
wickless<00:06:09.610> things<00:06:10.150> big<00:06:10.660> gaps<00:06:10.900> in<00:06:11.110> a<00:06:11.200> row<00:06:11.380> or

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:11.850 
wickless things big gaps in a row or

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:16.500 
wickless things big gaps in a row or
intense<00:06:14.280> okay<00:06:15.280> so<00:06:15.340> sometimes<00:06:15.670> the<00:06:15.970> laws<00:06:16.000> is<00:06:16.390> a

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:16.510 
intense okay so sometimes the laws is a

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:18.120 
intense okay so sometimes the laws is a
little<00:06:16.720> bit<00:06:16.810> of<00:06:16.900> a<00:06:16.960> cheat<00:06:17.170> but<00:06:17.470> you<00:06:17.560> can<00:06:17.710> slide

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:18.130 
little bit of a cheat but you can slide

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:20.310 
little bit of a cheat but you can slide
sideways<00:06:18.550> like<00:06:18.940> that<00:06:19.210> and<00:06:19.690> you<00:06:19.900> kind<00:06:20.050> of<00:06:20.080> throw

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:20.320 
sideways like that and you kind of throw

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:22.410 
sideways like that and you kind of throw
yourself<00:06:20.680> into<00:06:20.830> the<00:06:20.980> lip<00:06:21.220> and<00:06:21.490> it<00:06:22.030> gives<00:06:22.300> you

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:22.420 
yourself into the lip and it gives you

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:24.000 
yourself into the lip and it gives you
reflex<00:06:22.870> a<00:06:22.960> lot<00:06:23.080> of<00:06:23.200> the<00:06:23.260> times<00:06:23.470> but<00:06:23.740> you<00:06:23.860> can

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:24.010 
reflex a lot of the times but you can

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:26.490 
reflex a lot of the times but you can
get<00:06:24.190> through<00:06:24.460> there<00:06:24.870> really<00:06:25.870> really<00:06:26.110> fast

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:26.500 
get through there really really fast

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:28.590 
get through there really really fast
with<00:06:26.740> a<00:06:26.770> lot<00:06:27.040> of<00:06:27.070> entry<00:06:27.490> speed<00:06:27.760> and<00:06:28.000> slow<00:06:28.360> it<00:06:28.480> up

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:28.600 
with a lot of entry speed and slow it up

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:30.390 
with a lot of entry speed and slow it up
by<00:06:28.780> just<00:06:28.990> sliding<00:06:29.140> into<00:06:29.650> the<00:06:29.740> face<00:06:30.010> and<00:06:30.280> it

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:30.400 
by just sliding into the face and it

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:32.580 
by just sliding into the face and it
just<00:06:30.430> I<00:06:30.910> don't<00:06:31.360> know<00:06:31.570> it's<00:06:32.050> kind<00:06:32.260> of<00:06:32.290> fun<00:06:32.470> it's

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:32.590 
just I don't know it's kind of fun it's

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:33.960 
just I don't know it's kind of fun it's
a<00:06:32.650> little<00:06:32.860> bit<00:06:32.980> of<00:06:33.070> an<00:06:33.160> exploit<00:06:33.550> like<00:06:33.730> a<00:06:33.760> wit

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:33.970 
a little bit of an exploit like a wit

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:36.570 
a little bit of an exploit like a wit
glitch<00:06:34.240> so<00:06:34.990> it's<00:06:35.230> kind<00:06:35.890> of<00:06:35.920> another<00:06:36.130> stupid
