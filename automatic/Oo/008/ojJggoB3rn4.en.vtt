00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
and this is by the way the fastest track

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.980 
and this is by the way the fastest track
in<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.340> world<00:01:08.670> by<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.360> time<00:01:09.659> you<00:01:09.810> get<00:01:09.930> to

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
in the world by the time you get to

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.109 
in the world by the time you get to
succeed<00:01:10.650> it's<00:01:10.890> actually<00:01:11.340> going<00:01:11.520> on<00:01:11.760> a<00:01:11.790> very

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
succeed it's actually going on a very

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.870 
succeed it's actually going on a very
slight<00:01:12.510> incline<00:01:13.110> to<00:01:13.650> sort<00:01:14.250> of<00:01:14.340> slow<00:01:14.610> them<00:01:14.850> down

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
slight incline to sort of slow them down

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.940 
slight incline to sort of slow them down
for<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.390> finish<00:01:15.720> so<00:01:15.930> she<00:01:16.020> said<00:01:16.380> he<00:01:16.590> must<00:01:16.799> have

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
for the finish so she said he must have

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.609 
for the finish so she said he must have
had<00:01:17.369> this<00:01:17.549> line<00:01:17.909> offer<00:01:18.180> been<00:01:18.619> seriously

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
had this line offer been seriously

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.649 
had this line offer been seriously
off-balance<00:01:20.490> as<00:01:20.610> he<00:01:20.790> was<00:01:20.939> approaching<00:01:21.090> that

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
off-balance as he was approaching that

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.620

turn now Erin also told me that the rain
that<00:01:24.689> happened<00:01:25.530> overnight<00:01:25.830> would<00:01:26.189> actually

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
that happened overnight would actually

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.539 
that happened overnight would actually
slow<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.390> track<00:01:27.659> down<00:01:27.990> so<00:01:28.680> she<00:01:28.710> was<00:01:29.310> here
