00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
and it has been an absolutely invaluable

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.050 
and it has been an absolutely invaluable
tool<00:02:30.930> in<00:02:31.350> hiring<00:02:31.769> the<00:02:32.010> new<00:02:32.040> team<00:02:32.370> it<00:02:32.610> takes

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
that doesn't work out on a regular basis

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.039 
that doesn't work out on a regular basis
you<00:02:40.799> put<00:02:41.069> them<00:02:41.250> in<00:02:41.400> with<00:02:41.580> a<00:02:42.049> sports

beyond<00:02:45.599> a<00:02:46.019> limit<00:02:46.380> they<00:02:46.620> ever<00:02:46.799> thought<00:02:47.099> they

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
beyond a limit they ever thought they

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.199 
beyond a limit they ever thought they
could<00:02:47.489> go<00:02:47.670> and<00:02:48.349> do<00:02:49.349> they<00:02:49.500> continue<00:02:49.890> or<00:02:50.610> do<00:02:51.060> they

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
could go and do they continue or do they

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:54.350 
could go and do they continue or do they
stop<00:02:51.510> and<00:02:51.900> I've<00:02:52.410> seen<00:02:52.650> boat<00:02:52.890> and<00:02:53.360> that's

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
stop and I've seen boat and that's

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.870 
stop and I've seen boat and that's
really<00:02:54.660> a<00:02:54.780> factor<00:02:55.080> because<00:02:55.620> our<00:02:56.370> season<00:02:56.760> is

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
really a factor because our season is

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.080 
really a factor because our season is
long<00:02:57.060> there's<00:02:57.840> 45<00:02:58.410> games<00:02:58.709> so<00:02:59.489> you<00:02:59.519> need<00:02:59.910> to<00:03:00.000> be

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
long there's 45 games so you need to be

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.240 
long there's 45 games so you need to be
able<00:03:00.150> to<00:03:00.299> push<00:03:00.480> yourself<00:03:00.660> to<00:03:01.320> the<00:03:01.350> limit<00:03:01.500> when

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
able to push yourself to the limit when

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:03.910 
able to push yourself to the limit when
you<00:03:02.370> don't<00:03:02.579> think<00:03:02.730> you<00:03:02.910> can<00:03:03.030> do<00:03:03.209> any<00:03:03.390> more<00:03:03.570> and

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
you don't think you can do any more and

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.680 
you don't think you can do any more and
that's<00:03:04.920> what<00:03:05.190> zoopla<00:03:05.519> allows<00:03:06.060> us<00:03:06.299> to<00:03:06.480> see

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
that's what zoopla allows us to see

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.830 
that's what zoopla allows us to see
