00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:19.070
 here a round days entrepreneur im 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:22.430
 can also use the rest 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:26.869
 to carry small children 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:29.720
 Actually we have the same principle 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:33.890
 down here, still be happy black there 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:37.390
 burns hand and here we have that 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:39.759
 big tableware laid out 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:42.619
 should be here on the side of the zippers 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:48.910
 open the front with it 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:48.910
 that works if it is here on the ground 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.950
 These two holes are the legs 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:57.110
 can be performed 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:59.860
 through these two holes if then 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:03.020
 the legs performed as well as here 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:06.399
 you should disappear a very small one 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:11.619
 dog then it would be advisable here yet 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:11.619
 additional additional seat kirsten 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:19.190
 to put one in a bit 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:20.720
 so put it up a bit higher then 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:25.100
 the tail is hereby and the 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:27.799
 backfires then it is recommended 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:31.880
 capitalized first here and that 

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:35.060
 one-legged round here have the 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:38.269
 introduce clique and accordingly 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:40.579
 one to click and then finally only 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:42.829
 yet since he can no longer So 

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:45.920
 then here with his head out here 

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:48.829
 and then run into his advantage 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.450
 the position over half of this so that 

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:53.830
 So then only in 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:56.180
 quotes the flanks high 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:56.870
 have to be driven already 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.150
 locked 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:03.740
 the zips are the way too 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:05.510
 in these positions so made that 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:07.420
 they can not rise 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:10.520
 do not work independently 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:14.330
 Well then we still have those here 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:17.030
 possibilities according to the lengths too 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:20.750
 that means in the case would have to adjust 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:22.700
 the whole thing down so that's the one 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.950
 look head even further up and out 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:26.660
 can and here we have here 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:28.940
 three stages that means the 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:30.500
 Height can be compensated here 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:32.840
 So here we are the lowest 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:35.630
 middle and highest body level 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.950
 then as you can see so here 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:38.150
 then again as you like 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:40.700
 extend 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:43.340
 that is if the shoulder then 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:46.180
 should be relatively high so then have 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:48.440
 we here the possibility accordingly 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:51.140
 give or give material 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:52.850
 and here we have the possibility 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:55.130
 again something a bit firmer too 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:55.900
 pull and then the shoulder better 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:58.930
 fix 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:02.120
 we still have a belly strap here 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:07.480
 here at the side he is this one 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:09.040
 Belly belt is then here by the 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:14.769
 loop 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:19.329
 pulled through and here laterally laterally 

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:21.340
 then this one through and there you can 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:25.350
 then as you see here we have 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:30.190
 then again in the abdomen 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:33.789
 fix or chest and needs it there 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:36.090
 only happen with the animal so and 

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:38.470
 then there is the corresponding stability 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:42.070
 guaranteed that is so good 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:47.320
 to the effective theory without dog us 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:49.000
 Here are still side pockets in the 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:54.009
 side pocket is once 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:56.080
 educate and at night time is on 

00:04:54.009 --> 00:04:58.509
 still a magazine there is to see there 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:01.960
 skill anything pure and a 

00:04:58.509 --> 00:05:08.259
 keychain zipper compartment 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:10.300
 maybe forget or something there 

00:05:08.259 --> 00:05:12.099
 have all sorts of small-time impression 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:15.490
 and here you have the 

00:05:12.099 --> 00:05:17.320
 possibility according to example 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:19.740
 a drinking bottle no to do or two 

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:21.870
 water bottles 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:25.050
 then stow it accordingly 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:26.729
 Here the front of the abdomen shortly because we have 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:30.270
 still my bag fits that he is here 

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:32.669
 loose it with pocket as he with 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:35.449
 outside pocket still visit iphone 

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:39.150
 and maybe something else here 

00:05:35.449 --> 00:05:42.479
 quite economics or whatever 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:44.150
 In any case , we have, so to speak, on 

00:05:42.479 --> 00:06:08.789
 the possibilities 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:06:11.240
 Overall, it is very stable with the dog 

00:06:08.789 --> 00:06:11.240
 looks
