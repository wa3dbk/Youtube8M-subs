00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
how many exercises are you doing in

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.360 
how many exercises are you doing in
other<00:00:35.730> words<00:00:35.969> it<00:00:36.180> almost<00:00:36.630> sounds<00:00:37.230> like<00:00:37.370> you're

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
other words it almost sounds like you're

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.280 
other words it almost sounds like you're
overtraining<00:00:39.360> a<00:00:39.510> little<00:00:39.719> bit<00:00:39.840> you<00:00:40.079> have<00:00:40.110> a

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
overtraining a little bit you have a

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.340 
overtraining a little bit you have a
great<00:00:40.620> chest<00:00:40.950> workout<00:00:41.399> you've<00:00:41.640> got<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:42.090> power

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:42.350 
great chest workout you've got the power

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.510 
great chest workout you've got the power
strength<00:00:43.350> just<00:00:43.559> doesn't<00:00:43.890> disappear<00:00:44.010> like

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520

that<00:00:44.700> overnight<00:00:45.110> but<00:00:46.110> I'm<00:00:46.590> thinking<00:00:47.100> you

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
that overnight but I'm thinking you

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.850 
that overnight but I'm thinking you
possibly<00:00:47.969> may<00:00:48.450> be<00:00:48.510> overtraining<00:00:49.350> by<00:00:49.590> either

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
possibly may be overtraining by either

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.610 
possibly may be overtraining by either
doing<00:00:50.070> too<00:00:50.700> many<00:00:50.820> exercises<00:00:51.350> which<00:00:52.350> is<00:00:52.469> not

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
doing too many exercises which is not

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.130 
doing too many exercises which is not
really<00:00:52.890> that<00:00:52.920> big<00:00:53.219> a<00:00:53.280> deal<00:00:53.520> but<00:00:54.239> not<00:00:54.420> offering

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
really that big a deal but not offering

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.350 
really that big a deal but not offering
your<00:00:55.289> body<00:00:55.500> enough<00:00:55.980> rest<00:00:56.309> before<00:00:56.610> you<00:00:56.969> train

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
your body enough rest before you train

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.799 
your body enough rest before you train
chest<00:00:57.809> again<00:00:58.260> or<00:00:58.890> before<00:00:59.879> you<00:01:00.000> train<00:01:00.359> another

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
chest again or before you train another

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.900 
chest again or before you train another
pressing<00:01:01.440> type<00:01:01.620> movement<00:01:02.010> like<00:01:02.219> shoulders<00:01:02.760> or

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
pressing type movement like shoulders or

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.450 
pressing type movement like shoulders or
triceps<00:01:03.470> the<00:01:04.470> other<00:01:04.589> thing<00:01:04.860> I'm<00:01:04.979> thinking<00:01:05.339> of

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
triceps the other thing I'm thinking of

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.030 
triceps the other thing I'm thinking of
is<00:01:05.580> this<00:01:05.820> depending<00:01:06.479> on<00:01:06.600> how<00:01:06.840> hard<00:01:07.650> and<00:01:07.979> how

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
is this depending on how hard and how

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.840 
is this depending on how hard and how
frequently<00:01:08.970> you<00:01:09.299> train<00:01:09.979> you<00:01:10.979> might<00:01:11.189> not<00:01:11.369> be<00:01:11.580> in

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
frequently you train you might not be in

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.450 
frequently you train you might not be in
enough<00:01:12.689> of<00:01:12.840> a<00:01:12.930> recovery<00:01:13.290> mode<00:01:13.710> and<00:01:13.830> this<00:01:14.280> is

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
enough of a recovery mode and this is

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.060 
enough of a recovery mode and this is
why<00:01:14.610> I<00:01:14.670> tell<00:01:15.060> people<00:01:15.240> about<00:01:15.799> utilizing<00:01:16.799> some

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
why I tell people about utilizing some

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.190 
why I tell people about utilizing some
type<00:01:17.220> of<00:01:17.250> sugary<00:01:17.729> drink<00:01:18.150> to<00:01:18.659> replace<00:01:18.990> the

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
type of sugary drink to replace the

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.800 
type of sugary drink to replace the
glycogen<00:01:19.799> you<00:01:20.340> end<00:01:20.520> up<00:01:20.670> having<00:01:20.820> a<00:01:21.060> big<00:01:21.360> week<00:01:21.600> of

glycogen you end up having a big week of

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.359 
glycogen you end up having a big week of

following<00:01:31.079> week<00:01:31.229> you<00:01:31.500> feel<00:01:31.710> kind<00:01:31.979> of<00:01:32.009> punky

man you just don't have it you know the
snap<00:01:35.189> isn't<00:01:35.610> there<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:35.970> strength<00:01:36.329> isn't

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
snap isn't there the strength isn't

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.200 
snap isn't there the strength isn't
there<00:01:36.930> and<00:01:37.140> this<00:01:37.740> is<00:01:37.920> because<00:01:38.310> you<00:01:38.880> have<00:01:39.060> not

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
there and this is because you have not

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.569 
there and this is because you have not
replaced<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:40.049> glycogen<00:01:40.650> in<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:40.890> muscles<00:01:41.369> the

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
replaced the glycogen in the muscles the

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.190 
replaced the glycogen in the muscles the
amount<00:01:41.790> of<00:01:41.880> energy<00:01:42.270> you<00:01:42.390> have<00:01:42.570> available<00:01:43.020> is

amount of energy you have available is

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.700 
amount of energy you have available is
just<00:01:43.740> not<00:01:43.920> there<00:01:44.220> so<00:01:44.820> you're<00:01:45.000> okay<00:01:45.509> but<00:01:46.170> you

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
just not there so you're okay but you

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.469 
just not there so you're okay but you
just<00:01:46.770> don't<00:01:47.159> feel<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.490> same<00:01:47.729> and<00:01:48.060> then

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
just don't feel the same and then

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.660 
just don't feel the same and then
possibly<00:01:49.110> during<00:01:49.740> that<00:01:49.979> week<00:01:50.220> if<00:01:50.399> you<00:01:50.490> don't

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
possibly during that week if you don't

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.340 
possibly during that week if you don't
replace<00:01:51.000> that<00:01:51.180> glycogen<00:01:51.750> or<00:01:51.810> that<00:01:52.020> muscle

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
replace that glycogen or that muscle

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.649 
replace that glycogen or that muscle
sugar<00:01:52.710> you<00:01:53.159> don't<00:01:53.340> feel<00:01:53.640> as<00:01:53.909> well<00:01:54.299> the

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
sugar you don't feel as well the

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.719 
sugar you don't feel as well the
following<00:01:55.229> week<00:01:55.409> and<00:01:55.619> then<00:01:56.009> somehow<00:01:56.310> you<00:01:56.520> end

heavier lighter or number two you can
pyramid<00:02:49.770> up<00:02:49.920> by<00:02:50.580> going<00:02:51.180> up<00:02:51.360> and<00:02:51.390> do<00:02:51.570> 225<00:02:52.080> to<00:02:53.010> 55

pyramid up by going up and do 225 to 55
to<00:02:53.910> 75<00:02:54.240> and<00:02:54.420> as<00:02:54.900> you<00:02:55.050> pyramid<00:02:55.530> up<00:02:55.650> you<00:02:55.890> drop<00:02:56.280> the

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
to 75 and as you pyramid up you drop the

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.670 
to 75 and as you pyramid up you drop the
reps<00:02:56.730> and<00:02:57.000> then<00:02:57.570> eventually<00:02:57.870> after<00:02:58.320> you're

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
reps and then eventually after you're

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.520 
reps and then eventually after you're
max<00:02:58.980> you<00:02:59.520> then<00:02:59.760> take<00:03:00.150> a<00:03:00.210> light<00:03:00.510> set<00:03:00.870> drop<00:03:01.380> the

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
keep your reps very low allowing you to

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:17.360 
keep your reps very low allowing you to

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
two and then let's say we're gonna try

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.350 
two and then let's say we're gonna try
305<00:03:22.380> for<00:03:22.650> one<00:03:22.770> or<00:03:22.890> two<00:03:23.040> and<00:03:23.310> even<00:03:23.970> though<00:03:24.180> it's

again allowing for greater adaptation
you'll<00:03:33.060> be<00:03:33.150> amazed<00:03:33.450> one<00:03:33.960> or<00:03:34.080> two<00:03:34.230> heavy<00:03:34.560> reps

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
you'll be amazed one or two heavy reps

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.610 
you'll be amazed one or two heavy reps
or<00:03:35.490> one<00:03:35.940> or<00:03:36.060> two<00:03:36.090> heavy<00:03:36.930> sets<00:03:37.290> where<00:03:37.500> you're

getting one or two reps how how much

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.660 
getting one or two reps how how much
that'll<00:03:40.170> tire<00:03:40.440> you<00:03:40.620> out<00:03:40.680> alright
