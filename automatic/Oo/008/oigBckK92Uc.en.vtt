00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
with themes so if you're using a winter

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.000 
with themes so if you're using a winter
board<00:01:12.150> theme<00:01:12.420> that<00:01:12.689> does<00:01:13.260> some<00:01:13.409> crazy<00:01:13.530> stuff

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
then you can adjust the offset to make

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.760 
then you can adjust the offset to make
it<00:01:17.040> match<00:01:17.280> up<00:01:17.310> with<00:01:17.850> your<00:01:18.090> theme<00:01:18.420> now<00:01:19.110> any<00:01:19.560> time

respring and that is kind of a downside
it's<00:01:23.400> not<00:01:23.490> really<00:01:23.909> totally<00:01:24.299> dynamic<00:01:25.020> you<00:01:25.110> do

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
it's not really totally dynamic you do

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.679 
it's not really totally dynamic you do
have<00:01:25.380> to<00:01:25.470> respring<00:01:25.920> but<00:01:26.130> once<00:01:26.310> you<00:01:26.460> do<00:01:26.640> you<00:01:27.420> see
