00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
infrared work so what do you got this

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.830 
infrared work so what do you got this
year<00:00:21.090> close<00:00:21.330> yeah<00:00:22.310> all<00:00:23.310> work<00:00:23.640> so<00:00:24.180> what<00:00:24.720> do<00:00:24.779> you

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
year close yeah all work so what do you

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.650 
year close yeah all work so what do you
got<00:00:24.960> now<00:00:25.189> so<00:00:26.189> last<00:00:26.550> year<00:00:26.820> we<00:00:27.060> launched

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
got now so last year we launched

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.050 
got now so last year we launched
actually<00:00:28.410> I<00:00:28.650> thought<00:00:29.220> we<00:00:29.369> got<00:00:29.400> here<00:00:29.760> we<00:00:29.939> were

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
actually I thought we got here we were

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.319 
actually I thought we got here we were
launched<00:00:30.359> in<00:00:30.480> Kickstarter<00:00:31.260> which<00:00:31.560> is<00:00:31.769> a

00:00:32.319 --> 00:00:32.329 
launched in Kickstarter which is a

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:34.940 
launched in Kickstarter which is a
software-defined<00:00:33.329> rfid<00:00:34.140> reader<00:00:34.500> who<00:00:34.739> are

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
software-defined rfid reader who are

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.490 
software-defined rfid reader who are
Finland<00:00:35.370> and<00:00:36.329> we<00:00:36.600> got<00:00:36.780> here<00:00:36.960> and<00:00:37.050> realized<00:00:37.170> we

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
Finland and we got here and realized we

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.530 
Finland and we got here and realized we
hadn't<00:00:37.770> made<00:00:37.890> our<00:00:38.100> our<00:00:38.520> launch<00:00:38.820> video<00:00:39.149> so<00:00:39.420> we

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
hadn't made our our launch video so we

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.299 
hadn't made our our launch video so we
actually<00:00:39.840> went<00:00:40.020> up<00:00:40.110> to<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:40.440> room<00:00:40.649> and<00:00:41.010> the

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
actually went up to the room and the

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.760 
actually went up to the room and the
video<00:00:41.820> on<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.059> thing<00:00:42.239> stuffs<00:00:42.510> I<00:00:42.750> mean<00:00:43.260> Zack<00:00:43.559> on

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
video on the thing stuffs I mean Zack on

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.069 
video on the thing stuffs I mean Zack on
the<00:00:43.890> sofa<00:00:44.280> in<00:00:44.309> the<00:00:44.430> robot<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:45.000> rear<00:00:45.149> saying

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
the sofa in the robot the rear saying

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.380 
the sofa in the robot the rear saying
hey<00:00:46.230> we've<00:00:46.440> got<00:00:46.469> this<00:00:46.559> great<00:00:46.800> idea<00:00:47.270> so<00:00:48.270> he

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
hey we've got this great idea so he

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:49.760 
hey we've got this great idea so he
launched<00:00:48.690> it<00:00:48.780> in<00:00:48.899> exactly<00:00:49.440> a<00:00:49.530> year<00:00:49.590> later

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
launched it in exactly a year later

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.049 
launched it in exactly a year later
we're<00:00:50.309> here<00:00:50.750> we've<00:00:51.750> done<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.350> beta<00:00:52.530> and<00:00:53.370> spits

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
we're here we've done the beta and spits

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.540 
we're here we've done the beta and spits
from<00:00:54.469> tamper-evident<00:00:55.469> said<00:00:56.039> well<00:00:56.280> why<00:00:56.520> don't

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
from tamper-evident said well why don't

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.330 
from tamper-evident said well why don't
you<00:00:56.789> make<00:00:56.969> some<00:00:57.030> extras<00:00:58.100> that'll<00:00:59.100> be<00:00:59.190> cool

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
you make some extras that'll be cool

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.580 
you make some extras that'll be cool
because<00:00:59.640> we<00:00:59.820> know<00:00:59.969> we<00:01:00.840> got<00:01:00.989> to<00:01:01.079> all<00:01:01.410> of<00:01:01.530> you

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
because we know we got to all of you

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.049 
because we know we got to all of you
here<00:01:01.770> that<00:01:01.890> give<00:01:02.039> you<00:01:02.129> feedback<00:01:02.280> exactly<00:01:02.879> so

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
here that give you feedback exactly so

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.759 
here that give you feedback exactly so
we<00:01:03.239> can<00:01:03.270> again<00:01:03.660> you<00:01:03.870> know<00:01:03.989> a<00:01:04.199> few<00:01:04.470> hundred

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
we can again you know a few hundred

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.980 
we can again you know a few hundred
people<00:01:04.890> have<00:01:05.100> brought<00:01:05.250> them<00:01:05.489> here<00:01:05.720> we<00:01:06.720> solved

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
people have brought them here we solved

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.490 
people have brought them here we solved
them<00:01:07.080> pretty<00:01:07.320> much<00:01:07.380> it<00:01:07.680> cost<00:01:07.890> so<00:01:09.260> we'll<00:01:10.260> take

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
them pretty much it cost so we'll take

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.320 
them pretty much it cost so we'll take
that<00:01:10.680> feedback<00:01:10.920> and<00:01:11.310> feed<00:01:11.520> it<00:01:11.640> into<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:12.000> final

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
that feedback and feed it into the final

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.300 
that feedback and feed it into the final
version<00:01:12.360> so<00:01:13.049> so<00:01:13.439> now<00:01:13.590> that's<00:01:13.740> what<00:01:13.979> how<00:01:14.159> many

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
version so so now that's what how many

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.520 
version so so now that's what how many
frequencies<00:01:14.670> is<00:01:14.970> this<00:01:15.119> this<00:01:15.689> is<00:01:16.049> just<00:01:16.320> low

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
frequencies is this this is just low

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.840 
frequencies is this this is just low
frequency<00:01:17.070> so<00:01:17.250> it<00:01:17.369> does<00:01:17.549> like

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:18.850 
frequency so it does like

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.960 
frequency so it does like
150<00:01:19.850> right<00:01:20.329> but<00:01:20.689> it's<00:01:20.840> so<00:01:21.399> the<00:01:22.399> logics<00:01:22.820> all

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:22.970 
150 right but it's so the logics all

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.260 
150 right but it's so the logics all
built<00:01:23.299> into<00:01:23.509> the<00:01:23.689> chips<00:01:24.049> you<00:01:25.149> connect<00:01:26.149> with

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
built into the chips you connect with

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.630 
built into the chips you connect with
anything<00:01:26.659> that<00:01:26.689> Arduino<00:01:27.350> whatever<00:01:28.130> terminal

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
anything that Arduino whatever terminal

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.249 
anything that Arduino whatever terminal
that<00:01:28.700> you've<00:01:28.880> got<00:01:29.149> to<00:01:29.450> or<00:01:29.600> terminal<00:01:30.080> and

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:30.259 
that you've got to or terminal and

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:33.160 
that you've got to or terminal and
connector<00:01:30.830> over<00:01:31.100> USB<00:01:31.820> serial<00:01:32.270> yeah<00:01:32.750> my<00:01:32.930> must

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
connector over USB serial yeah my must

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.830 
connector over USB serial yeah my must
be<00:01:33.350> if<00:01:33.890> you<00:01:34.009> plug<00:01:34.220> in<00:01:34.250> USB<00:01:34.490> at<00:01:34.909> emulate<00:01:35.360> serial

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
be if you plug in USB at emulate serial

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.990 
be if you plug in USB at emulate serial
but<00:01:36.110> we<00:01:36.200> also<00:01:36.350> breakout<00:01:36.890> you<00:01:37.130> ask<00:01:37.340> so<00:01:37.700> if<00:01:37.850> you

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000 
but we also breakout you ask so if you

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.600 
but we also breakout you ask so if you
only<00:01:38.210> have<00:01:38.479> an<00:01:38.630> actual<00:01:38.929> real<00:01:39.140> serial<00:01:39.619> which<00:01:40.399> no

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:40.610 
only have an actual real serial which no

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:42.190 
only have an actual real serial which no
one<00:01:40.759> has<00:01:40.939> these<00:01:41.119> days<00:01:41.360> but<00:01:41.630> it<00:01:41.720> is<00:01:41.869> like

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
one has these days but it is like

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.050 
one has these days but it is like
something<00:01:42.500> that<00:01:42.649> doesn't<00:01:43.070> support<00:01:43.460> direct

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
something that doesn't support direct

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.630 
something that doesn't support direct
the<00:01:44.149> USB<00:01:44.539> host<00:01:44.689> where<00:01:45.020> you<00:01:45.289> can<00:01:45.560> just<00:01:45.920> open<00:01:46.340> you

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 
the USB host where you can just open you

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.510 
the USB host where you can just open you
up<00:01:46.670> okay<00:01:47.420> so<00:01:48.289> you<00:01:48.350> could<00:01:48.619> make<00:01:48.860> a<00:01:48.890> shield<00:01:49.280> out

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
up okay so you could make a shield out

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.940 
up okay so you could make a shield out
there<00:01:49.789> for<00:01:49.939> example<00:01:50.170> so<00:01:51.170> tell<00:01:51.590> us<00:01:51.619> what<00:01:51.799> kind

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
there for example so tell us what kind

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:53.109 
there for example so tell us what kind
of<00:01:52.009> trouble<00:01:52.310> we<00:01:52.340> can<00:01:52.490> get<00:01:52.580> into<00:01:52.640> with<00:01:53.000> this

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:53.119 
of trouble we can get into with this

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:55.120 
of trouble we can get into with this
thing<00:01:53.360> well<00:01:53.690> basically<00:01:54.319> with<00:01:54.500> this<00:01:54.649> you<00:01:54.920> can

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
thing well basically with this you can

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.520 
thing well basically with this you can
read<00:01:55.429> pretty<00:01:55.850> much<00:01:56.030> any<00:01:56.600> low<00:01:56.750> frequency<00:01:57.319> tags

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
read pretty much any low frequency tags

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.870 
read pretty much any low frequency tags
you<00:01:57.950> can<00:01:57.979> emulate<00:01:58.549> it<00:01:58.940> included<00:02:00.610> so<00:02:01.610> this<00:02:01.640> have

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
you can emulate it included so this have

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.370 
you can emulate it included so this have
a<00:02:01.909> nice<00:02:02.060> memory<00:02:02.270> like<00:02:02.600> a<00:02:02.630> nice<00:02:02.810> store<00:02:03.110> like

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
a nice memory like a nice store like

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.289 
a nice memory like a nice store like
slots<00:02:03.950> 1<00:02:04.190> through<00:02:04.369> 10<00:02:04.580> and<00:02:04.850> store<00:02:05.030> 10

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:05.299 
slots 1 through 10 and store 10

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:07.180 
slots 1 through 10 and store 10
different<00:02:05.630> at<00:02:05.959> the<00:02:06.110> moment<00:02:06.530> at<00:02:06.740> the<00:02:06.860> moment<00:02:06.890> it

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:07.190 
different at the moment at the moment it

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:09.430 
different at the moment at the moment it
has<00:02:07.340> one<00:02:07.610> storage<00:02:08.000> slot<00:02:08.360> but<00:02:08.600> there's<00:02:08.810> bags<00:02:09.200> of

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
has one storage slot but there's bags of

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.190 
has one storage slot but there's bags of
it<00:02:09.590> we<00:02:09.739> left<00:02:09.979> I<00:02:10.130> mean<00:02:10.250> we<00:02:10.429> picked<00:02:10.700> the<00:02:10.819> biggest

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
it we left I mean we picked the biggest

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:18.850 
it we left I mean we picked the biggest
32-bit<00:02:12.400> yeah<00:02:13.430> so<00:02:14.150> it<00:02:14.269> has<00:02:15.880> 20<00:02:17.680> so<00:02:18.680> in<00:02:18.799> the

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
32-bit yeah so it has 20 so in the

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.140 
32-bit yeah so it has 20 so in the
future<00:02:19.069> you<00:02:19.280> might<00:02:19.400> be<00:02:19.549> able<00:02:19.670> to<00:02:19.760> hit<00:02:19.940> a<00:02:19.970> button

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
future you might be able to hit a button

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.690 
future you might be able to hit a button
and<00:02:20.360> say<00:02:20.599> is<00:02:20.840> like<00:02:21.260> one<00:02:21.470> two<00:02:21.709> three<00:02:21.980> zero<00:02:22.190> three

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
and say is like one two three zero three

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.150 
and say is like one two three zero three
we<00:02:23.690> broken<00:02:24.109> up<00:02:24.260> all<00:02:24.410> the<00:02:24.560> pins<00:02:24.769> there<00:02:25.040> is<00:02:25.130> a

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
we broken up all the pins there is a

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.370 
we broken up all the pins there is a
user<00:02:25.430> button<00:02:25.820> but<00:02:26.570> we<00:02:26.600> broken<00:02:26.989> their<00:02:27.109> all<00:02:27.230> the

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
user button but we broken their all the

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.110 
user button but we broken their all the
pins<00:02:27.560> so<00:02:27.799> you<00:02:27.829> could<00:02:28.100> potentially<00:02:28.220> add<00:02:28.850> a

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
pins so you could potentially add a

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:34.310 
pins so you could potentially add a
little<00:02:29.420> LCD<00:02:30.079> and<00:02:30.410> the<00:02:30.530> joystick

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.410 

so<00:02:34.830> then<00:02:35.040> what's<00:02:35.250> the<00:02:35.400> future<00:02:35.610> once<00:02:36.270> you're

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
so then what's the future once you're

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.590 
so then what's the future once you're
out<00:02:36.480> of<00:02:36.570> the<00:02:36.660> beta<00:02:37.340> is<00:02:38.340> b1<00:02:38.550> this<00:02:39.030> is<00:02:39.210> what

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
out of the beta is b1 this is what

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.400 
out of the beta is b1 this is what
you've<00:02:39.870> read<00:02:40.080> 22<00:02:40.680> as<00:02:40.890> it<00:02:41.010> happens<00:02:41.360> 22

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
you've read 22 as it happens 22

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.230 
you've read 22 as it happens 22
genuinely<00:02:43.410> is<00:02:43.710> virtual<00:02:44.130> 22<00:02:44.580> we<00:02:44.820> didn't<00:02:45.090> just

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240 
genuinely is virtual 22 we didn't just

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:50.270 
genuinely is virtual 22 we didn't just
leave<00:02:45.480> it<00:02:47.900> will<00:02:48.900> go<00:02:49.080> to<00:02:49.140> full<00:02:49.380> production<00:02:49.590> and

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
leave it will go to full production and

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.220 
leave it will go to full production and
we're<00:02:51.090> then<00:02:51.240> gonna<00:02:51.390> look<00:02:51.660> at<00:02:51.870> doing<00:02:52.140> the

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
we're then gonna look at doing the

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.050 
we're then gonna look at doing the
high-frequency<00:02:52.520> version<00:02:53.520> whether<00:02:53.880> it

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
high-frequency version whether it

00:02:54.060 --> 00:03:00.020 
high-frequency version whether it
becomes<00:02:54.390> like<00:02:58.340> frequency<00:02:59.340> we're<00:02:59.490> doing<00:02:59.880> it

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
becomes like frequency we're doing it

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:01.270 
becomes like frequency we're doing it
see

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
see

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.220 
see
so<00:03:02.280> when<00:03:02.370> you<00:03:02.490> say<00:03:02.700> suffer<00:03:03.120> define<00:03:03.420> does<00:03:04.080> that

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
so when you say suffer define does that

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.590 
so when you say suffer define does that
mean<00:03:04.440> they'll<00:03:04.920> get<00:03:05.070> BIOS<00:03:05.459> updates<00:03:05.820> three

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
mean they'll get BIOS updates three

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.090 
mean they'll get BIOS updates three
flashes<00:03:07.020> when<00:03:07.140> you've<00:03:07.290> got<00:03:07.440> a<00:03:07.470> new<00:03:07.560> feature<00:03:07.860> or

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
flashes when you've got a new feature or

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:09.860 
flashes when you've got a new feature or
is<00:03:08.160> it<00:03:08.370> up<00:03:08.490> to<00:03:08.610> down<00:03:08.760> to<00:03:09.030> okay<00:03:09.540> so<00:03:09.570> the

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
is it up to down to okay so the

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.770 
is it up to down to okay so the
software-defined<00:03:10.290> bit<00:03:11.010> is<00:03:11.190> referring<00:03:11.850> to<00:03:11.880> how

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
software-defined bit is referring to how

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.590 
software-defined bit is referring to how
you<00:03:12.840> process<00:03:13.440> the<00:03:14.130> signal<00:03:14.640> so<00:03:14.880> traditional

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
you process the signal so traditional

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.670 
you process the signal so traditional
RFID<00:03:16.170> readers<00:03:16.830> the<00:03:17.670> analog<00:03:18.390> baseband<00:03:18.989> circuit

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
RFID readers the analog baseband circuit

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.750 
RFID readers the analog baseband circuit
is<00:03:20.010> doing<00:03:20.970> the<00:03:21.270> all<00:03:21.900> the<00:03:22.080> demodulation<00:03:22.760> what

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
is doing the all the demodulation what

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.009 
is doing the all the demodulation what
we<00:03:23.940> do<00:03:24.180> is<00:03:24.570> we<00:03:24.780> do<00:03:24.930> the<00:03:24.959> baseband<00:03:25.560> demodulator

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:27.019 
we do is we do the baseband demodulator

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:29.630 
we do is we do the baseband demodulator
and<00:03:28.019> then<00:03:28.200> it's<00:03:28.379> passed<00:03:28.560> up<00:03:28.890> to<00:03:28.920> the<00:03:29.189> digital

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
and then it's passed up to the digital

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.789 
and then it's passed up to the digital
when<00:03:29.849> they<00:03:29.970> do<00:03:30.150> the<00:03:30.769> protocol<00:03:31.769> of

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799 
when they do the protocol of

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:35.210 
when they do the protocol of
demodulation<00:03:32.610> in<00:03:32.879> the<00:03:32.970> digital<00:03:33.360> and<00:03:34.040> the<00:03:35.040> neat

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
demodulation in the digital and the neat

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.339 
demodulation in the digital and the neat
thing<00:03:35.430> about<00:03:35.459> that<00:03:35.700> is<00:03:36.150> it<00:03:36.390> means<00:03:36.569> that<00:03:37.019> you

00:03:37.339 --> 00:03:37.349 
thing about that is it means that you

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:40.479 
thing about that is it means that you
can<00:03:37.560> use<00:03:37.709> the<00:03:37.890> same<00:03:38.129> circuit<00:03:38.760> for<00:03:39.090> PS<00:03:39.780> k<00:03:40.049> FS

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:40.489 
can use the same circuit for PS k FS

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:43.399 
can use the same circuit for PS k FS
kask<00:03:41.489> which<00:03:41.970> of<00:03:42.150> the<00:03:42.269> three<00:03:42.510> main<00:03:42.720> modulation

00:03:43.399 --> 00:03:43.409 
kask which of the three main modulation

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:45.860 
kask which of the three main modulation
types<00:03:43.709> which<00:03:44.549> would<00:03:44.730> normally<00:03:44.909> be<00:03:45.120> a<00:03:45.269> possible

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
types which would normally be a possible

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:50.649 
types which would normally be a possible
on<00:03:46.560> a<00:03:46.590> single<00:03:47.040> circuit

00:03:50.649 --> 00:03:50.659 

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:53.479 

so<00:03:51.659> that's<00:03:51.959> routes<00:03:52.440> of<00:03:52.620> troops<00:03:52.829> of<00:03:53.010> a<00:03:53.099> digital

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489 
so that's routes of troops of a digital

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:56.179 
so that's routes of troops of a digital
and<00:03:53.700> then<00:03:53.819> we<00:03:53.970> do<00:03:54.120> the<00:03:54.390> final<00:03:54.859> demodulation<00:03:55.859> in

00:03:56.179 --> 00:03:56.189 
and then we do the final demodulation in

00:03:56.189 --> 00:03:57.920 
and then we do the final demodulation in
the<00:03:56.310> digital<00:03:56.700> now<00:03:56.970> that's<00:03:57.150> been<00:03:57.329> done<00:03:57.510> before

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
the digital now that's been done before

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.860 
the digital now that's been done before
but<00:03:58.109> normally<00:03:58.500> using<00:03:58.829> DSPs<00:03:59.450> but<00:04:00.450> because<00:04:00.750> we

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
but normally using DSPs but because we

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.860 
but normally using DSPs but because we

00:04:16.189 --> 00:04:16.199 
pitcher will be chosen 32-bit so you've

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:19.189 
pitcher will be chosen 32-bit so you've
got<00:04:16.410> tons<00:04:16.709> of<00:04:16.919> them<00:04:17.070> to<00:04:17.310> do<00:04:17.489> other<00:04:17.729> stuff<00:04:18.199> so

00:04:19.189 --> 00:04:19.199 
got tons of them to do other stuff so

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:21.129 
got tons of them to do other stuff so
then<00:04:19.350> häôs<00:04:19.560> it<00:04:19.739> responds<00:04:20.220> to<00:04:20.310> the<00:04:20.400> Kickstarter

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:10.400 
of the backers within three days we were

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.280 
of the backers within three days we were
fully<00:05:10.639> balanced<00:05:11.150> so<00:05:11.449> we<00:05:11.600> ended<00:05:11.780> up<00:05:11.900> three<00:05:12.199> of

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:12.290 
fully balanced so we ended up three of

them so packed and we chose a fairly
short<00:05:15.560> time<00:05:15.860> period<00:05:16.250> because<00:05:16.639> we<00:05:17.060> didn't<00:05:17.330> want

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:17.419 
short time period because we didn't want

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:20.350 
short time period because we didn't want
