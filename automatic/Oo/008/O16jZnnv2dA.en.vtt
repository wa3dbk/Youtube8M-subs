00:01:45.489 --> 00:01:45.499 
all you have to do is just take a file

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:47.410 
all you have to do is just take a file
and<00:01:45.829> follow<00:01:46.159> the<00:01:46.369> bevel<00:01:46.969> see<00:01:47.179> how<00:01:47.270> it's

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
and follow the bevel see how it's

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.239 
and follow the bevel see how it's
cleaning<00:01:47.689> up<00:01:47.899> right<00:01:48.079> there<00:01:48.350> and<00:01:48.649> it's<00:01:49.130> getting

cleaning up right there and it's getting

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:52.029 
cleaning up right there and it's getting
the<00:01:49.939> edge<00:01:50.210> I'm<00:01:50.539> restoring<00:01:51.170> the<00:01:51.409> edge<00:01:51.590> to<00:01:51.950> the

00:01:52.029 --> 00:01:52.039 
the edge I'm restoring the edge to the

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:53.529 
the edge I'm restoring the edge to the
file<00:01:52.219> it<00:01:52.369> doesn't<00:01:52.639> take<00:01:52.759> a<00:01:52.789> whole<00:01:52.999> lot<00:01:53.060> and

00:01:53.529 --> 00:01:53.539 
file it doesn't take a whole lot and

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:55.120 
file it doesn't take a whole lot and
then<00:01:54.020> you<00:01:54.139> can<00:01:54.289> turn<00:01:54.560> it<00:01:54.679> over<00:01:54.799> on<00:01:54.920> the<00:01:55.100> other

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
then you can turn it over on the other

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:56.859 
then you can turn it over on the other
side<00:01:55.579> because<00:01:55.819> you'll<00:01:56.030> leave<00:01:56.209> a<00:01:56.240> little<00:01:56.630> bit

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:56.869 
side because you'll leave a little bit
