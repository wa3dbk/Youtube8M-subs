underground cities but those are pretty

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.209 
underground cities but those are pretty
hard<00:01:01.140> to<00:01:01.199> find<00:01:01.530> because<00:01:01.739> it<00:01:01.980> to<00:01:02.070> look<00:01:02.190> for

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
hard to find because it to look for

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.579 
hard to find because it to look for
these<00:01:02.460> really<00:01:02.640> small<00:01:03.030> entrances<00:01:03.690> that<00:01:03.899> can<00:01:04.470> be

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
these really small entrances that can be

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.219 
these really small entrances that can be
hidden<00:01:04.830> under<00:01:04.970> trees<00:01:05.970> in<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.630> rocks<00:01:06.900> and<00:01:07.140> all

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
hidden under trees in the rocks and all

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.440 
hidden under trees in the rocks and all
that<00:01:07.439> stuff<00:01:07.770> and<00:01:08.010> it's<00:01:08.580> really<00:01:08.909> cool<00:01:09.150> that<00:01:09.180> you

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
that stuff and it's really cool that you

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.359 
that stuff and it's really cool that you
have<00:01:09.570> to<00:01:09.689> find<00:01:09.930> them<00:01:10.170> but<00:01:10.619> it's<00:01:10.740> also<00:01:10.860> really

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
have to find them but it's also really

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.020 
have to find them but it's also really
hard<00:01:12.049> so<00:01:13.049> anyway<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:14.070> basic<00:01:14.220> thing<00:01:14.700> about

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
hard so anyway the basic thing about

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.969 
hard so anyway the basic thing about
these<00:01:15.240> cities<00:01:15.540> is<00:01:15.659> that<00:01:15.990> they're<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.380> same<00:01:16.590> no

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
a test if Achatz spawner

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.539 
a test if Achatz spawner
but<00:01:46.200> they're<00:01:46.320> not<00:01:46.439> as<00:01:46.619> they're<00:01:46.979> not<00:01:47.100> all<00:01:47.340> as

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
but they're not as they're not all as

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.670 
but they're not as they're not all as
benign<00:01:48.000> of<00:01:48.299> a<00:01:48.420> spawner<00:01:48.720> is<00:01:48.930> that<00:01:49.140> so<00:01:49.350> if<00:01:49.409> we<00:01:49.560> go

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
benign of a spawner is that so if we go

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.050 
benign of a spawner is that so if we go
up<00:01:49.799> here<00:01:49.829> I'm<00:01:50.070> pretty<00:01:50.220> sure<00:01:50.430> I'll<00:01:50.579> find<00:01:50.850> a

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
up here I'm pretty sure I'll find a

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.050 
up here I'm pretty sure I'll find a
better<00:01:51.780> or<00:01:52.110> more<00:01:52.409> evil<00:01:52.770> spawner<00:01:53.100> if<00:01:53.759> we<00:01:53.850> just

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
better or more evil spawner if we just

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.600 
better or more evil spawner if we just
go<00:01:54.210> up<00:01:54.240> a<00:01:54.450> little<00:01:54.659> bit<00:01:54.840> not<00:01:55.590> in<00:01:55.619> this<00:01:55.829> room<00:01:56.159> or

now on the ruined cities there's way
more<00:02:46.260> mob<00:02:46.920> spawners<00:02:47.310> than<00:02:47.610> there<00:02:47.730> are<00:02:47.760> in<00:02:47.940> a

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
plain city like this and so you actually

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:53.539 
plain city like this and so you actually
have<00:02:52.319> to<00:02:52.410> be<00:02:52.500> really<00:02:52.829> really<00:02:52.860> you<00:02:53.430> know

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:53.549 
have to be really really you know

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:55.720 
have to be really really you know
prepared<00:02:54.000> to<00:02:54.209> actually<00:02:54.390> go<00:02:54.750> through<00:02:55.019> here<00:02:55.349> and

try to you know get all the crap
basically<00:03:00.260> so<00:03:01.260> let's<00:03:01.950> just<00:03:02.099> try<00:03:02.160> to<00:03:02.220> get<00:03:02.400> out

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
basically so let's just try to get out

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:03.680 
basically so let's just try to get out
of<00:03:02.579> here<00:03:02.879> get<00:03:03.209> me<00:03:03.269> out

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
of here get me out

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
oh god there we go so another thing is

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.990 
oh god there we go so another thing is
is<00:03:07.260> that<00:03:07.410> in<00:03:07.620> these<00:03:07.920> cities<00:03:08.280> they'll<00:03:08.579> randomly

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
is that in these cities they'll randomly

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.569 
is that in these cities they'll randomly
spawn<00:03:09.299> a<00:03:09.540> nether<00:03:10.230> portal<00:03:10.620> that's<00:03:11.069> only<00:03:11.400> on<00:03:11.549> a

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:11.579 
spawn a nether portal that's only on a

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:13.699 
spawn a nether portal that's only on a
few<00:03:11.790> of<00:03:11.910> them<00:03:12.030> it's<00:03:12.150> not<00:03:12.269> always<00:03:12.540> but<00:03:13.140> in<00:03:13.620> the

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
few of them it's not always but in the

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:16.009 
few of them it's not always but in the
bigger<00:03:13.920> cities<00:03:14.190> a<00:03:14.549> nether<00:03:14.879> portal<00:03:15.299> is<00:03:15.420> a<00:03:15.450> must

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 
bigger cities a nether portal is a must

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:18.620 
bigger cities a nether portal is a must
there's<00:03:16.680> also<00:03:17.010> um<00:03:17.489> in<00:03:17.880> these<00:03:18.389> cities

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
there's also um in these cities

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:21.050 
there's also um in these cities
sometimes<00:03:19.230> not<00:03:19.769> in<00:03:19.799> this<00:03:19.980> particular<00:03:20.190> one<00:03:20.760> but

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
sometimes not in this particular one but

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.000 
sometimes not in this particular one but
I<00:03:21.299> already<00:03:21.569> know<00:03:21.810> there<00:03:22.019> is<00:03:22.170> one<00:03:22.200> that<00:03:22.680> spawns

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
I already know there is one that spawns

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.250 
I already know there is one that spawns
like<00:03:23.280> this<00:03:23.549> is<00:03:23.730> that<00:03:24.359> they<00:03:24.660> actually<00:03:24.840> spawn

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
like this is that they actually spawn

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:26.960 
like this is that they actually spawn
will<00:03:25.440> the<00:03:25.560> sewer<00:03:25.739> system<00:03:26.250> and<00:03:26.400> then<00:03:26.730> then<00:03:26.850> at

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
will the sewer system and then then at

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:28.580 
will the sewer system and then then at
the<00:03:27.060> very<00:03:27.090> bottom<00:03:27.299> of<00:03:27.750> the<00:03:27.900> sewer<00:03:28.079> system
