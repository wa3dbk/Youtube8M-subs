ground you can put a weight on your hips
but<00:02:04.990> I've<00:02:05.110> just<00:02:05.140> found<00:02:05.560> that<00:02:05.830> I<00:02:06.130> was<00:02:06.369> starting

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
but I've just found that I was starting

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.510 
but I've just found that I was starting
to<00:02:06.729> go<00:02:07.000> lift<00:02:07.660> heavier<00:02:08.080> than<00:02:08.350> the<00:02:08.500> then<00:02:09.340> the

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.520 
to go lift heavier than the then the

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:10.710 
to go lift heavier than the then the
weight<00:02:09.700> that<00:02:09.820> I<00:02:09.910> could<00:02:10.060> actually<00:02:10.179> put<00:02:10.479> on<00:02:10.570> my

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
weight that I could actually put on my

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.290 
weight that I could actually put on my
hips<00:02:10.959> so<00:02:11.650> basically<00:02:12.130> say<00:02:12.280> I<00:02:12.340> have<00:02:12.430> a<00:02:12.489> 45-pound

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
hips so basically say I have a 45-pound

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.900 
hips so basically say I have a 45-pound
plate<00:02:13.480> and<00:02:13.989> it's<00:02:14.380> here<00:02:14.800> my<00:02:15.310> range<00:02:15.550> of<00:02:15.670> motion

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
plate and it's here my range of motion

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:17.340 
plate and it's here my range of motion
is<00:02:16.000> limited<00:02:16.209> because<00:02:16.570> the<00:02:16.900> plate<00:02:17.170> is<00:02:17.320> just

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
is limited because the plate is just

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:19.440 
is limited because the plate is just
taking<00:02:17.890> up<00:02:17.980> too<00:02:18.250> much<00:02:18.430> so<00:02:18.820> that's<00:02:19.300> when<00:02:19.420> I

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
taking up too much so that's when I

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:20.940 
taking up too much so that's when I
decided<00:02:19.510> to<00:02:19.959> switch<00:02:20.200> to<00:02:20.410> the<00:02:20.500> BOSU<00:02:20.709> ball

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
decided to switch to the BOSU ball

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.990 
decided to switch to the BOSU ball
because<00:02:21.250> you're<00:02:21.790> with<00:02:22.540> the<00:02:23.110> added<00:02:24.000> stability

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
because you're with the added stability

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.540 
because you're with the added stability
factor<00:02:25.620> you<00:02:26.620> can<00:02:26.770> actually<00:02:26.920> decrease<00:02:27.340> your

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
factor you can actually decrease your

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:28.680 
factor you can actually decrease your
weight<00:02:27.700> so<00:02:27.880> I'm<00:02:27.940> gonna<00:02:28.090> show<00:02:28.180> you<00:02:28.300> two<00:02:28.480> ways
