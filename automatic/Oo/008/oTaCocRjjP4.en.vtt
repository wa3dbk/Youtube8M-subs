00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:15.719
 hello today i decided to check can 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.100
 whether the wheel itself wants all the water from our 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.140
 display booth 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.980
 it is understandable when stop here 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.960
 number rises beautifully well to the other so 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.630
 that water is enough to remember 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.900
 carving vacuums what then would i 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:34.829
 took a professional vacuum cleaner nt30 5/1 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:37.879
 so tact this means punching filter but 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:40.920
 we will turn it off by the need I need 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:44.180
 try just a cent zoom gone and here 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.180
 so look yourself short 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:10.030
 instead of the order here so told me 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.190
 sometime 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:16.060
 washer whom I showed this thing 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:23.710
 probably burned to which I answered yes 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:26.280
 Garbage question now check take the bank 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.280
 myrtle 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.950
 swap 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.679
 olya 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:02:01.509
 does fixation think for and why 

00:01:41.679 --> 00:02:23.349
 in general, he will write out underwater 1k and here he is 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:27.239
 so good is own flat filter 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:27.239
 which is left from raw concessions 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:40.840
 cool truth to this test finished 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:44.260
 on this test finished the water pulled out 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.599
 turned off the vacuum cleaner turned on like 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.889
 it turned out cool 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:52.440
