00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
stage to be its immature state as it

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.410 
stage to be its immature state as it
grows<00:00:23.010> the<00:00:23.039> leaves<00:00:23.430> become<00:00:23.760> thinner<00:00:24.000> almost

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
grows the leaves become thinner almost

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.179 
grows the leaves become thinner almost
paper<00:00:24.750> thin<00:00:24.930> and<00:00:25.350> it'll<00:00:25.590> look<00:00:25.710> nothing<00:00:26.160> like

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
paper thin and it'll look nothing like

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.040 
paper thin and it'll look nothing like
this<00:00:26.580> behind<00:00:27.150> these<00:00:27.449> new<00:00:27.630> ones<00:00:27.810> that<00:00:27.869> I<00:00:27.990> just

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
this behind these new ones that I just

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.290 
this behind these new ones that I just
got<00:00:28.380> in<00:00:28.560> you'll<00:00:28.740> see<00:00:28.920> a<00:00:28.949> mature<00:00:29.369> atala<00:00:29.760> lychee

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
got in you'll see a mature atala lychee

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.659 
got in you'll see a mature atala lychee
as<00:00:30.900> I<00:00:31.080> said<00:00:31.289> it<00:00:31.529> looks<00:00:31.740> nothing<00:00:32.009> like<00:00:32.250> it<00:00:32.489> did

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
so you see how it develops once it's had

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.880 
so you see how it develops once it's had
a<00:00:34.890> chance<00:00:35.190> to<00:00:35.340> grow<00:00:35.550> it's<00:00:36.239> pretty<00:00:36.540> interesting

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:36.890
