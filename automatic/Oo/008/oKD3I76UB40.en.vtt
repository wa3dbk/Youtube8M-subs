00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:41.880
 he told me the referee is going to be then 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.880
 humberto suazo 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.719
 or 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:55.880
 r 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.829
 Hello 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.440
 solid step 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:13.530
 of course he celebrates 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:16.140
 mathematical tranquility the center of 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.710
 suazo is revived was the intro bad of 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.710
 heads 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:25.479
 third brandy renteria for scratches that 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:27.000
 He has not looked for me anymore, it seems to me that 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:30.010
 high justice 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.860
 10 to correcaminos was very good auction of 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:35.710
 Zapala that is looking for it and we know that 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.900
 he is a great auctioneer just and inside 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:41.990
 of the area that usually involves the goal 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:44.149
 up but also for the defense of 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.070
 but if you win there were three more players 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:48.170
 the goalkeeper that were there on the 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.960
 ball and they let him finish it regularly 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:53.299
 I totally agree with Alejandro 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:56.060
 berber axel is cautioned by 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:58.189
 correctly if it is the third in the 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:01.280
 match the second for roadrunners the 

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:03.710
 number 24 alexander berber that will start 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:06.080
 his football career basic forces 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.820
 of the streamers of Monterrey did not have the 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.640
 very complicated opportunity in that 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:13.550
 position having a severe meza has already 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:16.310
 been assigned to various teams in the 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:19.970
 App division or other good 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:23.150
 opportunity in which dorón pabón or 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.900
 good soother pacifier could throw straight 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.920
 to the arch 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:31.280
 and the archer Jorge Díaz de León 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:34.280
 that is just taking the last 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:37.150
 Situations of siege but suazo will be 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.150
 right peacock 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:45.159
 and 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.569
 the dialing 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.060
 but so many things 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:02.819
 where is the ball there is no 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:06.200
 visibility for him 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:06.200
 but here is the repetition 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.939
 but 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.950
 of good race because days when it occurs 

00:03:10.939 --> 00:03:15.400
 account the ball is 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:18.909
 shaking the nets 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:20.709
 daniel renteria monterrey acquired in 

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:22.659
 the first part overcomes correctly 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:24.670
 the two goals by zero good without 

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:27.610
 subtract merits from peacock, of course, 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:31.420
 hits the ball right on the right foot 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:34.569
 for the external part that the district very 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:36.220
 well smooth he continued to never lose 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:40.439
 seen the ball and that earned him 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:44.409
 catch the ball and lose 

00:03:40.439 --> 00:03:47.099
 the verticality and grace of monterrey 

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:47.099
 inside the area 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.780
 roadrunner 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:08.120
 on the way appeared 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:08.120
 once 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:14.180
 schuster the mind in the angle 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:16.950
 Roadrunner was dead 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:21.170
 because they stole the ball it seemed 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:23.780
 Israelis the grips makes the diagonal 

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:26.960
 to see perfectly if you what 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:29.600
 golazo class just done in 8 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:32.690
 of roadrunners to 100 palms the ball 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:36.070
 in the angle there is a match is alive 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:36.070
 against roads the sun 

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:41.610
 because the pacifier whipped turkey by the 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:45.920
 left we will see if someone is 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:45.920
 will take advantage and is in the shot 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:55.630
 and later 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:55.630
 good 

00:05:04.789 --> 00:05:09.499
 dramatically goes forward and towards 

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:12.509
 inside the goal 

00:05:09.499 --> 00:05:15.269
 monterrey for a divine work 

00:05:12.509 --> 00:05:17.999
 Well well we just said 

00:05:15.269 --> 00:05:20.909
 I stay brody or the roadrunners team 

00:05:17.999 --> 00:05:22.919
 it is tied or scratched because it defines it 

00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:25.559
 happened the second one defines it because this 

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:28.709
 good match practically goes into the 

00:05:25.559 --> 00:05:32.159
 freezer and it's a logical situation not 

00:05:28.709 --> 00:05:33.479
 because monterrey plays on the rise but 

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:36.479
 because showing is a more made team 

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:40.000
 more solid more more solvent more more 

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:41.630
 mature in a very nervous way 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.190
 plus 

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:45.190
 the kid comes 

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:50.680
 ah 

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:06.240
 when hunger 

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:08.610
 but thanks you drag the value already 

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:10.919
 the grace left the center for you 

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:13.440
 you're going to put in front unusual because 

00:06:10.919 --> 00:06:15.750
 they were usually passed behind and he 

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:19.169
 happens to them right here they are just 

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:20.480
 he plays and the perfect ball against 

00:06:19.169 --> 00:06:23.150
 sense 

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:26.410
 the right leg space to put 

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:28.970
 in 4 goals for 1 to live 

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:32.090
 in this particular annotation we are 

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:34.790
 seeing which right grace the third 

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:37.190
 for Monterrey and at this moment I know 

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:38.930
 that is more spectacular of this goal if 

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:40.790
 driving because it's born from that 

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:42.830
 midfield what it does in asia that is 

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:45.050
 inspired by this moment this young man of 

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:47.840
 scratched equipment or that one that 

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:50.990
 they had stories from the turkey and 

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:53.420
 you can run road four goals for one 

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:56.620
 then forceful to the team of 

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:56.620
 monterrey action solís 

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:04.889
 and this is over 

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:04.889
 that striped party 

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:12.960
 goals by one a good performance of 

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:16.230

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:21.180
 pacifier sooth and so with this panoramic
