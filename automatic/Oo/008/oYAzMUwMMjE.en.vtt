 I will reply to everyone write in any 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:41.659
 what comes to mind also there 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.850
 worry 

00:00:41.659 --> 00:00:45.889
 ok let's start with the tutorial ok guys 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.109
 we explain the installation immediately 

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:49.969
 of the kraft adventure to install 

00:00:48.109 --> 00:00:51.679
 the kraft adventure first there 

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:54.829
 I recommend creating a folder on the 

00:00:51.679 --> 00:00:56.719
 desktop and rename it as you want me to 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:59.269
 example the proper adventure call 

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:01.729
 kraft the priest and as you can see there is not 

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:03.829
 inside no file first 

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:07.190
 I show that the kraft adventure for 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:09.400
 who also has a 64-bit system does not 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:12.170
 will work we go to the official website 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:14.510
 of the kraft adventure you always find 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.970
 in the description of this video e 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:18.560
 come on you can decide to download it from 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.110
 here or from the official website 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.210
 see here where where where here here 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:27.070
 where where where here is the perfect one 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:29.360
 from the official website of this tech way 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.830
 let's call it that even if it isn't 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:35.480
 I would call it that 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:40.580
 expect the 24 seconds of download a 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:41.990
 moment not too long 13 12 11 here 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.730
 while we are here I remind you of 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:47.720
 leave a nice live video still these 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:49.220
 eight seconds 7 6 5 4 3 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.840
 if you don't put rai.tv it will explode 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.120
 computer you can no longer install from 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.610
 vento kraft so do it and sign up 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:59.060
 well the channel then we wait for a 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:01.190
 second ok perfect we open it e 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:04.010
 we take this folder all the 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:05.630
 contained here you see this perfect 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:07.850
 and what we do 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:11.329
 we move it to this folder 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:13.129
 perfect desktop the already extracted then 

00:02:11.329 --> 00:02:13.910
 we can also close this and what 

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:17.300
 let's make 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:19.670
 let's start the kraft adventure ok 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:24.770
 as you can see it immediately gives us an error 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:26.600
 because why the wrong svt file 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:28.550
 this happens especially for those who have a 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:31.120
 64-bit system 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:36.380
 and what we need to do 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:39.080
 delete this svt eliminates perfect e 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:40.610
 we go on this other link this 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.530
 but it's not nice to say 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.120
 this other link 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.800
 sorry for the interruption to this 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.410
 point what we do click on mor 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:50.750
 don't click on this windows here 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.850
 go on perfect humor 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:55.430
 a page that you all have will open 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:58.130
 svt for linux etc so now 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:00.440
 let's try the one for windows 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:04.400
 here it is and download this version 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:07.100
 I have 64 since I do not exhaust this 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.170
 for 32 but unloading the one below this 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:11.420
 here I am selecting now which it is 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.280
 for windows 64 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:16.190
 I've already downloaded it is very easy 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:18.290
 easy and what you do open the 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:22.880
 winrar folder you will find in different 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:24.650
 file you take the file called svt e 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:27.470
 I took it inside the folder 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:29.990
 adventure kraft and open now 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:33.530
 the croft adventure ok as you see now 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:36.200
 this problem is fixed, however, now 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:40.040
 when we start minecraft we will also have 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:42.050
 another very ugly type problem 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:46.010
 that we do install it comes out 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:47.420
 minecraft punto jar doesn't exist therefore 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:50.480
 what are we going to do 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:53.030
 we close let's go to the other link that is 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:55.850
 this and download the old launcher 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:57.320
 of minecraft this you remember here 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:59.330
 the old one before the update 

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:02.690
 echo practically having to download this 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:07.330
 we put it inside the folder 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:12.380
 adventure kraft and we rename it petard 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:14.930
 erasing this perfect here so 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:17.750
 let's leave it so let's do it now 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:19.609
 what we do insert username and 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:21.919
 the password we have then puts a 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:24.560
 perfect pack we make remember 

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:26.360
 password login and now what it does there 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:28.610
 does to download old packages 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:31.130
 of the old version of minecraft va 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:33.229
 well when it's done I'll explain how 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:36.680
 continue because now he will give you a 

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:38.210
 another mistake so let's wait a moment 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.400
 who finishes installing it 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:43.280
 if you have other problems, ask in 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:45.169
 description though if you also follow this 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:47.479
 guide that is the only one for now 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:48.830
 there is working and it doesn't work 

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:50.650
 something wrong 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:53.419
 you probably wrong with 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:54.080
 the installation of the packages let's say 

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:56.810
 so 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:59.750
 or you have misplaced the very svt file 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:02.539
 important what if it works without you 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:04.010
 that change the svt is fine better 

00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:07.610
 for you and it's not a problem 

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:09.470
 ok now we close ok but what is the 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:11.330
 problem now when we try to 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:13.490
 start the adventure off 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:16.450
 practically tell us that the minecraft 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:19.160

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:21.380

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:33.260
 file 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:37.430
 we make a perfect and select the 

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:42.919
