00:00:05.219 --> 00:00:09.310
 You just entered the theater of the unknown sky. 

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:13.308
 If words and images look strange there is a reason for that. 

00:00:13.308 --> 00:00:17.570
 Our world was unmatched differently. 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:22.618
 This experience will not do you anything to regret and there is no reason to fear. 

00:00:35.679 --> 00:00:39.750
 The mythical archetype of a great great-grandfather or hero 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.689
 is certainly the most popular mythical theme of all time. 

00:00:43.689 --> 00:00:49.079
 And yet, thousands of years after the first expressions of that archetype, 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.539
 can anyone rightly claim to have penetrated that riddle? 

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:57.868
 Even today, despite numerous volumes written on this subject, 

00:00:57.868 --> 00:01:01.408
 the plausible answer seems to be completely out of reach. 

00:01:01.408 --> 00:01:07.659
 What human experience could inspire the world image of super heroes 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:16.289
 who saves the world, from monster chaos? It's just one of the globally recurring mysteries. 

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:22.840
 Why did the birth of that great ancestor from the womb worship the mother of the goddess? 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.990
 Why exhibiting or leaving this hero at birth? 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.799
 Or murder or relocation of his father? 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:37.209
 Why is the god so commonly identified as 

00:01:37.209 --> 00:01:44.250
 an implacable arrow, sword, spear or hammer, a weapon that turns out to be a cosmic lightning. 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.999
 That! Lightning, but without any similarity to the lightning in our heaven today. 

00:01:51.099 --> 00:01:56.250
 Absolutely nothing makes sense with any known references. 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.289
 And yet these topics are so completely related to being an archetypal 

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:04.079
 the attribute leads flawlessly to the other, and then further to the other. 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:09.920
 There must be an explanation, yet unbiased beliefs will not allow an explanation. 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:15.949
 This is a logical contradiction that emerges from today's accepted stories of human history 

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:23.759
 and planetary history. The problem lies in the undefined theoretical assumption. 

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:29.250
 The assumption is: How today, as before. Well, there's a trap; 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.219
 It keeps our attention on today's uncommon solar system, 

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:37.500
 even while human records speak with a thousand votes 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.819
 in support of a violent and catastrophic planetary history. 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:48.270
 In popular testimonies, prominent heroes are quasi-divine, great and powerful people 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:51.360
 saving the human race from chaos monsters. 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:03:00.220
 One astronomeric tradition for the other calls this warrior figure with Mars planet. 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.479
 The more we go back, the more divine or heavenly character stands out 

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:20.780
 heroes. Such Egyptian warlike figures as S, 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:26.180
 or Horus, or Amon were originally celestial figures without a trace of doubt, 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.770
 but later localized through regional narration. 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:34.950
 The same can be said of ancient Sumerian or Akadian equivalents, Dumuzi 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:40.419
 or Tamuz, the gods of Mars Ningir or Nergal, and even Gilgamesh. 

00:03:40.419 --> 00:03:47.069
 In the end, local cult cultures transformed such figures into legendary 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:54.230
 the ancestors of those who recount those stories. Our answer to that dilemma 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:59.330
 lies in a veritable reconstruction of things never imagined in our time. 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:04.760
 Reconstruction takes us back to gathering the planet near Earth, 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:09.349
 what are all the events that took place before the present solar organization of the solar system. 

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:13.349
 The planets did not always talk about their current paths. 

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:17.360
 Our object is an ancient polar configuration, 

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:22.049
 where warrior-hero finds a lot and a complete explanation of the activities 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:27.649
 dark, reddish, the most ancient sphere. 

00:04:27.649 --> 00:04:31.970
 Planet Mars was the centerpiece of cosmic lightning. 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.530
 Verification of this reconstruction lies in the contribution 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:50.300
 visible forms and conversational sequences of events; 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:54.639
 which all testify to the global substructure of human memory. 

00:04:57.839 --> 00:05:01.540
 What will happen to our understanding of human history 

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:04.850
 if they can be seen beyond any reasonable doubt 

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:10.410
 that the archetype of warrior-hero requires celestial events that have no parallel in 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:12.439
 the experience of nature today? 

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:21.399
 What does this mean when a warrior-king on Earth 

00:05:21.399 --> 00:05:25.970
 symbolically puts, as his crown, the glorious glory of heaven. 

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:31.160
 This even meant a kingdom merger, and a wedding with an archetypal star 

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:34.910
 goddess, which can be identified as a Venus planet. 

00:05:38.978 --> 00:05:43.350
 A lot of parallel symbols is equally important. There is only one example 

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:46.210
 identification of explosive radiant, 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:50.600
 the essential qualities of that starry goddess, as the shield of warrior-king 

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:53.820
 a mythical Christmas gift to him. 

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:59.589
 That identification magically confirms the local king as incarnation, or 

00:05:59.589 --> 00:06:05.228
 the avatars of the heavenly prototype, the warrior of the king as a mythic protector and 

00:06:05.228 --> 00:06:10.970
 the owner of scary glory. That's what the word hero means literally. 

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:16.979
 Do you mention any of the most repetitive topics to the arcade hero, 

00:06:16.979 --> 00:06:20.019
 just look at her place in the reconstruction, 

00:06:20.019 --> 00:06:23.779
 and you will find further topics that are as well expressed. 

00:06:23.779 --> 00:06:28.399
 There is no place for multiplicity or simple explanation. 

00:06:28.399 --> 00:06:32.529
 Let's ask a question. Is there a popular explanation 

00:06:32.529 --> 00:06:37.478
 does it really work? In the context of our reconstruction, the required samples 

00:06:37.478 --> 00:06:41.270
 they must be shown. Globally. If the events happened. 

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:46.770
 We will follow this logic to further conclusions in our next segment.
