 ryad boudebouz who was whistled on 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.509

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.640
 first few minutes this time it has 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.340
 waited half an hour to give a 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.340
 advantage to bastia Corsican go 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.619
 return with this advantage to the locker room 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:53.579
 and in second half sochaux goes 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:55.110
 push the center to the second post the 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.060

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.820
 Sochalian equalization 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.850
 No but 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:04.530
 well rightly sanctions cédric 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:08.229
 bakambu for a stroller on diakité 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:13.870
 the goal is therefore precisely refused 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:17.070
 always at 0 for bastia a situation 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:20.260
 for the Bastians with this shot from 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:22.480
 krasic who is above 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.340
 this is what this action of 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.440
 krasic idea of ​​a situation the surface 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.150
 of mickaël landreau with corchia who is 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.640
 stayed on land mickaël landreau takes care 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:33.070
 of corchia following the strike of 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:36.459

 mark in the empty goal since mickaël 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:40.600
 landreau deals with corchia is a 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:44.220
 new times where the money well does not 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:47.110
 will not validate the goal 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:51.519
 there was a whistle beforehand 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:55.209
 and so sochaux is still running 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:57.340
 of bastia but by dint of pushing the 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:03:00.400
 Sochaux will be rewarded with the 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:02.709
 emmanuel mayuka's goal his second goal

 superb way at the velodrome stadium 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:12.970
 there they take advantage of this control a little 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:16.239
 little missed complicated to sulk for taupe 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:16.959
 and his volley just in front of fethi harek 1 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:19.600
 goal everywhere 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:21.310
 a last situation a little realistic 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:24.700
 to the chan ya in playtime with 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:26.709
 this free kick of sébastien corchia boxed 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:30.400
 by holding me landreau then caught in 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:33.010
 a second time we will remain there a 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:36.280
 everywhere three points out of 15 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:39.780
 for fox of the best in the game but 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.780
 not quite at the accounting level 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.650
 entirely
