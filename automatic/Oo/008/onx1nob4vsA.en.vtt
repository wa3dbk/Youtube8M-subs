knife it can be really difficult this
way<00:01:52.100> you<00:01:52.159> can<00:01:52.369> use<00:01:52.490> that<00:01:52.640> sawing<00:01:53.000> motion<00:01:55.090> to

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
way you can use that sawing motion to

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.350 
way you can use that sawing motion to
get<00:01:56.300> all<00:01:57.290> the<00:01:57.710> skin<00:01:58.100> off

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:40.960 
and I'm going to cut the pineapple on

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:43.020 
and I'm going to cut the pineapple on
half<00:02:41.170> just<00:02:41.500> so<00:02:41.590> that<00:02:41.710> I<00:02:41.800> can<00:02:41.860> show<00:02:41.980> both<00:02:42.430> of

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
half just so that I can show both of

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.980 
half just so that I can show both of
them<00:02:43.330> to<00:02:43.600> you<00:02:45.120> well<00:02:46.120> be<00:02:46.270> the<00:02:46.390> first<00:02:46.600> one<00:02:46.750> is<00:02:46.780> if

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:46.990 
them to you well be the first one is if

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:49.550 
them to you well be the first one is if
you're<00:02:47.140> going<00:02:47.230> to<00:02:47.290> want<00:02:47.680> to<00:02:47.770> cut<00:02:47.950> it<00:02:48.040> in<00:02:48.160> rings

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
you're going to want to cut it in rings

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.240 
you're going to want to cut it in rings
you<00:02:50.560> may<00:02:50.740> want<00:02:50.980> to<00:02:51.100> put<00:02:51.700> them<00:02:51.850> on<00:02:51.970> a<00:02:52.000> platter<00:02:52.390> I

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
you may want to put them on a platter I

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.880 
you may want to put them on a platter I
think<00:02:54.250> it<00:02:54.340> looks<00:02:54.550> nicer<00:02:54.880> it's<00:02:55.450> up<00:02:55.630> to<00:02:55.750> you<00:02:55.890> but

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
think it looks nicer it's up to you but

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:58.620 
think it looks nicer it's up to you but
just<00:02:57.100> you<00:02:57.310> can<00:02:57.460> just<00:02:57.610> cut<00:02:57.760> the<00:02:57.880> pineapple<00:02:58.090> into

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
just you can just cut the pineapple into

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:01.590 
just you can just cut the pineapple into
about<00:02:59.350> 1<00:02:59.560> inch<00:02:59.710> slices<00:02:59.980> or<00:03:00.220> however<00:03:00.820> thick<00:03:01.450> you

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.600 
about 1 inch slices or however thick you

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:08.760 
about 1 inch slices or however thick you
like<00:03:01.630> it<00:03:05.550> then<00:03:06.550> with<00:03:07.330> each<00:03:07.600> piece<00:03:08.050> you<00:03:08.620> can

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:08.770 
like it then with each piece you can

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:09.990 
like it then with each piece you can
just<00:03:08.890> lay<00:03:09.040> it<00:03:09.160> flat<00:03:09.340> on<00:03:09.460> the<00:03:09.700> cutting<00:03:09.970> board

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
just lay it flat on the cutting board

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:16.650 
just lay it flat on the cutting board
and<00:03:10.620> cut<00:03:11.620> around<00:03:11.770> the<00:03:12.160> core<00:03:14.880> the<00:03:15.880> core<00:03:15.910> can<00:03:16.480> be

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
and cut around the core the core can be

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.110 
and cut around the core the core can be
soft<00:03:16.960> and<00:03:17.320> if<00:03:17.950> it's<00:03:18.100> soft<00:03:18.310> enough<00:03:18.460> you<00:03:18.760> can<00:03:18.940> eat

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
soft and if it's soft enough you can eat

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.560 
soft and if it's soft enough you can eat
it<00:03:19.270> but<00:03:20.220> a<00:03:21.220> lot<00:03:22.030> of<00:03:22.060> people<00:03:22.210> are<00:03:22.480> very

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:22.570 
it but a lot of people are very

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:24.420 
it but a lot of people are very
particular<00:03:22.810> also<00:03:23.380> use<00:03:23.500> a<00:03:23.530> small<00:03:23.920> and<00:03:24.130> I<00:03:24.190> for

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
particular also use a small and I for

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.930 
particular also use a small and I for
this<00:03:24.610> is<00:03:24.760> that<00:03:24.790> would<00:03:25.090> be<00:03:25.180> easier<00:03:25.570> for<00:03:25.660> you<00:03:26.940> and

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
this is that would be easier for you and

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:32.250 
this is that would be easier for you and
then<00:03:28.240> that<00:03:28.420> should<00:03:28.660> just<00:03:28.870> pop<00:03:29.110> right<00:03:29.140> out

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.720 

and<00:03:32.379> then<00:03:33.069> you<00:03:33.790> have<00:03:33.970> a<00:03:34.000> pineapple<00:03:34.299> slice<00:03:35.730> the

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
and then you have a pineapple slice the

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:40.470 
and then you have a pineapple slice the
other<00:03:37.060> option<00:03:38.939> that<00:03:39.939> I<00:03:39.970> think<00:03:40.239> is<00:03:40.360> a<00:03:40.390> little

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
other option that I think is a little

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:46.770 
other option that I think is a little
easier<00:03:41.290> is<00:03:42.280> to<00:03:43.120> cut<00:03:43.569> around<00:03:43.689> the<00:03:44.319> core<00:03:45.269> so<00:03:46.269> you

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
easier is to cut around the core so you

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:51.649 
easier is to cut around the core so you
can<00:03:46.959> just<00:03:46.989> cut<00:03:48.150> your<00:03:49.150> chunks<00:03:50.310> around<00:03:51.310> this

00:03:51.649 --> 00:03:51.659 
can just cut your chunks around this

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:54.899 
can just cut your chunks around this
circular<00:03:52.659> loop<00:03:52.900> it's<00:03:53.170> like<00:03:53.470> circular<00:03:54.190> corner

00:03:54.899 --> 00:03:54.909 
circular loop it's like circular corner

00:03:54.909 --> 00:04:00.509 
circular loop it's like circular corner
um<00:03:55.500> and<00:03:58.379> depending<00:03:59.379> on<00:03:59.470> house<00:03:59.709> off<00:03:59.980> the<00:04:00.010> cords

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:00.519 
um and depending on house off the cords

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:02.399 
um and depending on house off the cords
mom<00:04:00.849> will<00:04:01.120> depend<00:04:01.390> how<00:04:01.540> close<00:04:01.840> you<00:04:02.019> can<00:04:02.170> get<00:04:02.349> to

00:04:02.399 --> 00:04:02.409 
mom will depend how close you can get to

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:07.890 
mom will depend how close you can get to
it<00:04:05.579> now<00:04:06.579> you<00:04:06.640> have<00:04:06.879> one<00:04:07.060> color<00:04:07.480> that<00:04:07.690> you<00:04:07.720> can

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900 
it now you have one color that you can

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.860 
it now you have one color that you can
discard<00:04:08.290> and<00:04:08.950> then<00:04:09.819> just<00:04:10.329> chop<00:04:10.690> your

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:10.870 
discard and then just chop your

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:18.090 
discard and then just chop your
pineapple<00:04:11.560> into<00:04:12.060> bite-sized<00:04:13.060> pieces
