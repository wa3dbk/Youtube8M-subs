surprises so today we're going to show

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.680 
surprises so today we're going to show
you<00:00:37.200> an<00:00:37.440> actual<00:00:37.649> example<00:00:38.070> of<00:00:38.789> a<00:00:39.000> lot<00:00:39.210> that

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
you an actual example of a lot that

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.630 
you an actual example of a lot that
we're<00:00:39.840> thinking<00:00:39.989> of<00:00:40.260> building<00:00:40.710> on<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:41.399> first

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
we're thinking of building on the first

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.430 
we're thinking of building on the first
thing<00:00:41.789> we<00:00:41.879> notice<00:00:42.180> is<00:00:42.270> that<00:00:42.329> this<00:00:42.719> lot<00:00:42.930> is<00:00:43.199> on<00:00:43.410> a

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
thing we notice is that this lot is on a

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.240 
thing we notice is that this lot is on a
hill<00:00:43.770> so<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:44.699> road<00:00:44.940> it<00:00:45.329> has<00:00:45.809> about<00:00:46.020> a<00:00:46.079> 25<00:00:46.739> to<00:00:46.770> 30

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
hill so the road it has about a 25 to 30

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.580 
hill so the road it has about a 25 to 30
percent<00:00:47.430> slope<00:00:47.910> to<00:00:48.120> it<00:00:48.149> and<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.809> lot<00:00:49.020> follows

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
percent slope to it and the lot follows

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.020 
percent slope to it and the lot follows
that<00:00:49.770> so<00:00:50.039> what<00:00:50.190> does<00:00:50.280> this<00:00:50.370> mean<00:00:50.579> from<00:00:50.940> a

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
that so what does this mean from a

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.670 
that so what does this mean from a
building<00:00:51.300> perspective<00:00:51.539> well<00:00:52.320> it<00:00:52.469> means<00:00:52.590> that

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
building perspective well it means that

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.439 
building perspective well it means that
we're<00:00:52.859> going<00:00:52.980> to<00:00:53.039> need<00:00:53.129> a<00:00:53.190> retaining<00:00:53.550> wall<00:00:53.699> not

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
we're going to need a retaining wall not

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.810 
we're going to need a retaining wall not
only<00:00:54.780> is<00:00:55.020> there<00:00:55.230> a<00:00:55.260> drop-off<00:00:55.739> in<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:56.280> side<00:00:56.519> of

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
only is there a drop-off in the side of

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.430 
only is there a drop-off in the side of
the<00:00:57.030> lot<00:00:57.180> but<00:00:57.359> also<00:00:57.539> in<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:57.899> rear<00:00:58.109> so<00:00:58.320> we're

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
the lot but also in the rear so we're

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.130 
the lot but also in the rear so we're
going<00:00:58.530> to<00:00:58.590> want<00:00:59.010> to<00:00:59.100> create<00:00:59.519> an<00:01:00.390> extra<00:01:00.750> budget

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
going to want to create an extra budget

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.290 
going to want to create an extra budget
item<00:01:01.410> for<00:01:01.620> both<00:01:01.769> of<00:01:01.949> those<00:01:02.070> items<00:01:02.820> in<00:01:03.090> a<00:01:03.149> lot

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
item for both of those items in a lot

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.050 
item for both of those items in a lot
now<00:01:03.480> we<00:01:03.870> can<00:01:04.050> minimize<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.680> cost<00:01:04.949> of<00:01:05.309> this<00:01:05.489> by

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
now we can minimize the cost of this by

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.060 
now we can minimize the cost of this by
using<00:01:06.120> a<00:01:06.630> plan<00:01:06.930> that<00:01:07.200> actually<00:01:07.320> fits<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:07.890> lot

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
using a plan that actually fits the lot

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.890 
using a plan that actually fits the lot
so<00:01:08.370> if<00:01:08.490> we<00:01:08.580> use<00:01:08.700> a<00:01:08.730> bi-level<00:01:09.060> plan<00:01:09.600> this<00:01:09.780> is

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
so if we use a bi-level plan this is

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.960 
so if we use a bi-level plan this is
going<00:01:10.020> to<00:01:10.080> be<00:01:10.170> a<00:01:10.200> slab<00:01:10.470> house<00:01:10.740> and<00:01:11.100> we<00:01:11.520> drop<00:01:11.790> it

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
going to be a slab house and we drop it

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.060 
going to be a slab house and we drop it
down<00:01:12.180> with<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:12.689> natural<00:01:13.140> grade<00:01:13.439> of<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:13.860> of

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
down with the natural grade of the of

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.230 
down with the natural grade of the of
the<00:01:14.280> lot<00:01:14.460> it's<00:01:14.700> going<00:01:14.850> to<00:01:14.909> save<00:01:15.090> us<00:01:15.210> money

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
the lot it's going to save us money

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.310 
the lot it's going to save us money
because<00:01:15.659> we're<00:01:15.750> going<00:01:15.840> to<00:01:15.900> be<00:01:16.020> able<00:01:16.080> to<00:01:16.200> use<00:01:16.290> a

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
because we're going to be able to use a

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.560 
because we're going to be able to use a
shorter<00:01:17.189> retaining<00:01:17.580> wall<00:01:17.790> and<00:01:18.030> less<00:01:18.299> fill

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
shorter retaining wall and less fill

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.810 
shorter retaining wall and less fill

definitely going to need a retaining
wall<00:01:28.770> to<00:01:29.299> transition<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:30.420> grade<00:01:30.630> from<00:01:30.869> this

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
wall to transition the grade from this

house<00:01:31.259> to<00:01:31.470> that<00:01:31.619> house<00:01:31.890> so<00:01:32.430> like<00:01:32.579> I<00:01:32.670> said<00:01:32.729> if<00:01:32.970> we

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
house to that house so like I said if we

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.969 
house to that house so like I said if we
use<00:01:33.210> a<00:01:33.240> bi-level<00:01:33.570> plan<00:01:34.200> that's<00:01:34.590> going<00:01:34.740> to<00:01:34.799> help

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
use a bi-level plan that's going to help

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.410 
use a bi-level plan that's going to help
us<00:01:35.220> cut<00:01:35.460> down<00:01:35.490> on<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:35.970> size<00:01:36.180> of<00:01:36.329> that

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
us cut down on the size of that

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.789 
us cut down on the size of that
retaining<00:01:36.780> wall<00:01:36.990> and<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.320> amount<00:01:37.560> of<00:01:37.649> fill

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
retaining wall and the amount of fill

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.310 
retaining wall and the amount of fill
material<00:01:37.829> we'll<00:01:38.460> need<00:01:38.610> to<00:01:38.939> make<00:01:39.840> up<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.140> grade

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
material we'll need to make up the grade

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.310 
material we'll need to make up the grade
difference<00:01:40.680> here<00:01:40.890> so<00:01:41.420> here's<00:01:42.420> a<00:01:42.509> truly<00:01:42.930> awful

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
difference here so here's a truly awful

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.020 
difference here so here's a truly awful
sketch<00:01:43.619> I<00:01:43.799> made<00:01:43.829> here<00:01:44.220> guys<00:01:44.430> but<00:01:44.640> you<00:01:44.729> can<00:01:44.850> see

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
sketch I made here guys but you can see

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.389 
sketch I made here guys but you can see
where<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.390> grade<00:01:45.689> transitions<00:01:46.649> down<00:01:46.979> and

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
where the grade transitions down and

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.490 
where the grade transitions down and
we've<00:01:48.119> got<00:01:48.299> a<00:01:48.329> retaining<00:01:48.899> wall<00:01:49.049> at<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.320> lower

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
we've got a retaining wall at the lower

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.709 
we've got a retaining wall at the lower
end<00:01:49.799> there<00:01:50.070> with<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:50.520> footer<00:01:50.759> and<00:01:51.060> we've

00:01:51.709 --> 00:01:51.719 
end there with the footer and we've

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:54.350 
end there with the footer and we've
stepped<00:01:52.110> down<00:01:52.380> a<00:01:52.740> bi-level<00:01:53.159> plan<00:01:53.790> here<00:01:54.119> to

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
stepped down a bi-level plan here to

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.469 
stepped down a bi-level plan here to
match<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:54.630> grade<00:01:55.259> now<00:01:56.070> if<00:01:56.399> we<00:01:56.610> had<00:01:56.820> installed

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
match the grade now if we had installed

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.030 
match the grade now if we had installed
just<00:01:57.719> a<00:01:57.899> straight<00:01:58.259> you<00:01:58.560> know<00:01:58.649> built<00:01:58.920> a

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
just a straight you know built a

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.950 
just a straight you know built a
straight<00:01:59.340> house<00:01:59.520> on<00:01:59.880> this<00:02:00.119> fictitious

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
straight house on this fictitious

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.810 
straight house on this fictitious
drawing<00:02:01.530> here<00:02:01.770> the<00:02:02.159> grade<00:02:02.430> would<00:02:02.610> have<00:02:02.700> been

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
drawing here the grade would have been

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.999 
drawing here the grade would have been
higher<00:02:03.060> and<00:02:03.329> the<00:02:03.390> retaining<00:02:03.810> wall<00:02:04.140> would<00:02:04.799> need

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
higher and the retaining wall would need

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.160 
higher and the retaining wall would need
to<00:02:05.189> rise<00:02:05.399> on<00:02:05.880> the<00:02:06.060> lower<00:02:06.210> end<00:02:06.450> with<00:02:06.689> more<00:02:06.930> fill

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
to rise on the lower end with more fill

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.130 
to rise on the lower end with more fill
material<00:02:08.270> so<00:02:09.270> what<00:02:09.390> makes<00:02:09.630> this<00:02:09.869> lot

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
material so what makes this lot

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.590 
material so what makes this lot
expensive<00:02:10.920> to<00:02:11.039> build<00:02:11.190> on<00:02:11.430> is<00:02:11.700> also<00:02:12.210> what<00:02:12.420> makes

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
expensive to build on is also what makes

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.290 
expensive to build on is also what makes
it<00:02:12.810> great<00:02:13.080> so<00:02:13.620> this<00:02:13.710> lot<00:02:13.980> slopes<00:02:14.400> big-time<00:02:15.060> in

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
it great so this lot slopes big-time in

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:16.850 
it great so this lot slopes big-time in
the<00:02:15.390> direction<00:02:15.690> of<00:02:15.930> the<00:02:16.050> ocean<00:02:16.200> behind<00:02:16.770> me

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
the direction of the ocean behind me

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:17.570 
the direction of the ocean behind me
here

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
here

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.370 
here
might<00:02:17.700> get<00:02:17.880> an<00:02:17.970> actual<00:02:18.300> ocean<00:02:18.540> view<00:02:18.960> from<00:02:19.260> the

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
might get an actual ocean view from the

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.260 
might get an actual ocean view from the
upstairs<00:02:19.710> bedrooms<00:02:20.460> since<00:02:20.640> the<00:02:20.820> future<00:02:21.090> house

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
upstairs bedrooms since the future house

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.350 
upstairs bedrooms since the future house
next<00:02:21.660> door<00:02:21.690> is<00:02:21.870> going<00:02:22.230> to<00:02:22.290> be<00:02:22.410> so<00:02:22.590> much<00:02:22.740> lower

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
next door is going to be so much lower

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.250 
next door is going to be so much lower
so<00:02:24.360> we're<00:02:24.480> going<00:02:24.570> to<00:02:24.660> want<00:02:24.780> to<00:02:24.870> place<00:02:25.080> our

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
so we're going to want to place our

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.110 
so we're going to want to place our
windows<00:02:25.650> in<00:02:25.860> the<00:02:25.950> home<00:02:26.100> to<00:02:26.310> take<00:02:26.460> advantage<00:02:26.940> of

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
windows in the home to take advantage of

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.630 
windows in the home to take advantage of
the<00:02:27.240> view<00:02:27.530> one<00:02:28.530> of<00:02:28.560> the<00:02:28.680> first<00:02:29.010> things<00:02:29.310> that<00:02:29.430> US

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
the view one of the first things that US

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.250 
the view one of the first things that US
builders<00:02:30.000> notice<00:02:30.360> about<00:02:30.570> this<00:02:30.810> lot<00:02:31.020> is<00:02:31.230> that

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
builders notice about this lot is that

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:32.300 
builders notice about this lot is that
it's<00:02:31.530> been<00:02:31.710> filled

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
it's been filled

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.160 
it's been filled
basically<00:02:32.850> the<00:02:33.090> developer<00:02:33.540> has<00:02:33.660> built<00:02:33.870> what

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
basically the developer has built what

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.620 
basically the developer has built what
we<00:02:34.260> call<00:02:34.470> a<00:02:34.680> pad<00:02:35.100> to<00:02:35.760> build<00:02:35.970> a<00:02:36.090> home<00:02:36.240> on<00:02:36.390> in

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
we call a pad to build a home on in

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.750 
we call a pad to build a home on in
order<00:02:37.140> to<00:02:37.260> get<00:02:37.380> that<00:02:37.560> pad<00:02:37.860> built<00:02:38.160> up<00:02:38.400> as<00:02:38.640> you

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
order to get that pad built up as you

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.820 
order to get that pad built up as you
see<00:02:38.970> here<00:02:39.240> they<00:02:39.600> bring<00:02:39.870> in<00:02:40.020> fill<00:02:40.320> dirt<00:02:40.530> and

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
see here they bring in fill dirt and

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.520 
see here they bring in fill dirt and
stone<00:02:41.250> or<00:02:41.520> some<00:02:41.910> combination<00:02:42.180> of<00:02:42.540> thereof<00:02:42.960> now

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
stone or some combination of thereof now

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.140 
stone or some combination of thereof now
the<00:02:43.590> concern<00:02:43.980> is<00:02:44.160> whether<00:02:44.400> this<00:02:44.640> fill<00:02:44.940> was

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
the concern is whether this fill was

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:46.970 
the concern is whether this fill was
actually<00:02:45.570> compacted<00:02:46.170> properly<00:02:46.620> when<00:02:46.770> it<00:02:46.860> was

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
actually compacted properly when it was

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.770 
actually compacted properly when it was
installed<00:02:47.400> if<00:02:47.670> not<00:02:47.880> we<00:02:48.270> could<00:02:48.450> have<00:02:48.570> some

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
installed if not we could have some

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.270 
installed if not we could have some
major<00:02:48.990> structural<00:02:49.590> problems<00:02:49.950> in<00:02:50.040> the<00:02:50.130> future

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
major structural problems in the future

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.940 
major structural problems in the future
so<00:02:50.790> we<00:02:50.820> want<00:02:51.060> to<00:02:51.150> investigate<00:02:51.510> that<00:02:51.810> so<00:02:52.770> one<00:02:52.920> of

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
so we want to investigate that so one of

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.230 
so we want to investigate that so one of
the<00:02:53.070> other<00:02:53.220> nice<00:02:53.400> things<00:02:53.670> about<00:02:53.760> the<00:02:54.030> slot

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:54.240 
the other nice things about the slot

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.150 
the other nice things about the slot
guys<00:02:54.480> is<00:02:54.720> all<00:02:54.870> the<00:02:55.080> utilities<00:02:55.590> are<00:02:55.740> here<00:02:55.950> we've
