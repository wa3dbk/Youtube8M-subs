the water marble now affecting the
raspberry<00:00:09.280> ripple<00:00:09.400> color<00:00:11.730> I'm<00:00:12.730> using

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:12.790 
raspberry ripple color I'm using

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:14.249 
raspberry ripple color I'm using
filtered<00:00:13.420> water<00:00:13.570> which<00:00:13.870> is<00:00:13.990> at<00:00:14.110> room

00:00:14.249 --> 00:00:14.259 
filtered water which is at room

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:15.509 
filtered water which is at room
temperature<00:00:14.769> but<00:00:14.980> I've<00:00:15.099> put<00:00:15.309> it<00:00:15.370> in<00:00:15.460> the

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:15.519 
temperature but I've put it in the

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:17.160 
temperature but I've put it in the
microwave<00:00:15.849> for<00:00:15.969> three<00:00:16.299> seconds<00:00:16.689> as<00:00:16.810> this<00:00:16.960> nail

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:17.170 
microwave for three seconds as this nail

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:18.269 
microwave for three seconds as this nail
varnish<00:00:17.470> tends<00:00:17.680> to<00:00:17.800> dry<00:00:17.950> a<00:00:17.980> little<00:00:18.160> bit

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:18.279 
varnish tends to dry a little bit

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:20.310 
varnish tends to dry a little bit
quicker<00:00:18.550> than<00:00:18.640> others<00:00:19.000> I'm<00:00:19.810> creating<00:00:20.290> a

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:20.320 
quicker than others I'm creating a

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.380 
quicker than others I'm creating a
bullseye<00:00:20.680> effect<00:00:20.980> and<00:00:21.460> I'm<00:00:21.579> using<00:00:21.790> three

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:22.390 
bullseye effect and I'm using three

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:24.210 
bullseye effect and I'm using three
shades<00:00:22.660> of<00:00:22.810> nail<00:00:22.989> varnish<00:00:23.140> so<00:00:23.349> I'm<00:00:23.529> using<00:00:23.770> the

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:24.220 
shades of nail varnish so I'm using the

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.370 
shades of nail varnish so I'm using the
darkest<00:00:24.669> shade<00:00:24.880> first<00:00:25.119> then<00:00:25.810> the<00:00:25.989> lightest

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:26.380 
darkest shade first then the lightest

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:29.909 
darkest shade first then the lightest
shade<00:00:26.649> and<00:00:26.950> then<00:00:27.520> the<00:00:27.790> middle<00:00:28.059> shade<00:00:28.919> this

00:00:29.909 --> 00:00:29.919 
shade and then the middle shade this

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:31.049 
shade and then the middle shade this
will<00:00:30.099> give<00:00:30.220> you<00:00:30.279> the<00:00:30.369> most<00:00:30.520> marbled<00:00:30.970> effect

00:00:31.049 --> 00:00:31.059 
will give you the most marbled effect

00:00:31.059 --> 00:00:33.120 
will give you the most marbled effect
when<00:00:31.660> you<00:00:31.750> use<00:00:31.930> the<00:00:32.110> pen<00:00:32.320> to<00:00:32.500> drag<00:00:32.710> the<00:00:32.829> colors

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:33.130 
when you use the pen to drag the colors

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:35.970 
when you use the pen to drag the colors
around<00:00:33.399> to<00:00:33.730> create<00:00:33.850> the<00:00:34.030> swirls<00:00:34.410> in<00:00:35.410> total

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:35.980 
around to create the swirls in total

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:37.110 
around to create the swirls in total
they'll<00:00:36.130> be<00:00:36.220> eight<00:00:36.400> drops<00:00:36.610> of<00:00:36.820> nail<00:00:36.970> varnish

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:37.120 
they'll be eight drops of nail varnish

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.790 
they'll be eight drops of nail varnish
to<00:00:37.390> create<00:00:37.600> the<00:00:37.690> bullseye<00:00:38.050> and<00:00:38.320> four<00:00:38.560> of<00:00:38.650> those

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:38.800 
to create the bullseye and four of those

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.960 
to create the bullseye and four of those
will<00:00:38.980> be<00:00:39.070> of<00:00:39.160> the<00:00:39.280> pale<00:00:39.460> pink<00:00:41.730> you<00:00:42.730> want<00:00:42.910> to

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:42.970 
will be of the pale pink you want to

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:44.520 
will be of the pale pink you want to
work<00:00:43.060> really<00:00:43.270> quickly<00:00:43.450> for<00:00:43.840> this<00:00:43.990> because<00:00:44.200> the

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:44.530 
work really quickly for this because the

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:45.900 
work really quickly for this because the
nail<00:00:44.680> varnish<00:00:44.830> dries<00:00:45.130> on<00:00:45.250> top<00:00:45.580> of<00:00:45.670> the<00:00:45.730> water

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:45.910 
nail varnish dries on top of the water

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:51.150 
nail varnish dries on top of the water
very<00:00:46.120> quick<00:00:49.560> once<00:00:50.560> you've<00:00:50.740> created<00:00:50.950> your

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:51.160 
very quick once you've created your

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.280 
very quick once you've created your
bullseye<00:00:51.460> you're<00:00:52.210> going<00:00:52.360> to<00:00:52.510> need<00:00:52.690> either<00:00:52.960> an

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:53.290 
bullseye you're going to need either an

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:55.830 
bullseye you're going to need either an
orange<00:00:53.620> stick<00:00:53.890> a<00:00:54.160> pin<00:00:54.520> or<00:00:54.850> a<00:00:54.970> toothpick<00:00:55.300> and

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:55.840 
orange stick a pin or a toothpick and

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.240 
orange stick a pin or a toothpick and
you're<00:00:56.290> going<00:00:56.440> to<00:00:56.530> be<00:00:56.590> using<00:00:56.860> that<00:00:56.950> to<00:00:57.100> drag

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:57.250 
you're going to be using that to drag

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.479 
you're going to be using that to drag
the<00:00:57.400> colors<00:00:57.670> out<00:00:57.790> to<00:00:57.910> create<00:00:58.090> the<00:00:58.270> swirls<00:00:58.540> I

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
the colors out to create the swirls I

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.650 
the colors out to create the swirls I
start<00:01:00.489> the<00:01:00.610> swirls<00:01:00.820> by<00:01:01.000> dragging<00:01:01.360> the<00:01:01.420> center

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:01.660 
start the swirls by dragging the center

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.420 
start the swirls by dragging the center
of<00:01:01.750> the<00:01:01.840> bullseye<00:01:02.020> in<00:01:02.500> two<00:01:02.680> directions<00:01:02.860> to

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:03.430 
of the bullseye in two directions to

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:06.389 
of the bullseye in two directions to
begin<00:01:03.700> with<00:01:03.910> and<00:01:04.350> then<00:01:05.350> using<00:01:05.799> the<00:01:05.890> pin<00:01:06.070> I<00:01:06.189> just

00:01:06.389 --> 00:01:06.399 
begin with and then using the pin I just

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:08.640 
begin with and then using the pin I just
like<00:01:06.579> to<00:01:06.759> swirl<00:01:07.000> the<00:01:07.119> colors<00:01:07.420> together<00:01:07.689> I<00:01:08.170> also

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:08.650 
like to swirl the colors together I also

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:10.140 
like to swirl the colors together I also
like<00:01:08.860> to<00:01:08.979> make<00:01:09.070> sure<00:01:09.250> you<00:01:09.400> drag<00:01:09.640> the<00:01:09.760> outside

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:10.150 
like to make sure you drag the outside

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:11.910 
like to make sure you drag the outside
color<00:01:10.420> to<00:01:10.659> the<00:01:10.780> center<00:01:10.990> so<00:01:11.320> you<00:01:11.350> get<00:01:11.620> a<00:01:11.650> really

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:11.920 
color to the center so you get a really

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.620 
color to the center so you get a really
nice<00:01:12.040> marbled<00:01:12.580> effect<00:01:12.700> with<00:01:13.030> the<00:01:13.150> dark<00:01:13.360> shades

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:13.630

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.170 
and the light shades a little tip is to

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:18.810 
and the light shades a little tip is to
dip<00:01:17.350> the<00:01:17.530> pin<00:01:17.740> into<00:01:18.100> the<00:01:18.130> water<00:01:18.430> when<00:01:18.700> you're

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:18.820 
dip the pin into the water when you're

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:20.340
