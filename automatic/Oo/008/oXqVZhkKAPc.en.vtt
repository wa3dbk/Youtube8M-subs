particular<00:02:02.080> you<00:02:02.380> can<00:02:02.409> weigh<00:02:02.800> these<00:02:02.979> obviously

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
particular you can weigh these obviously

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.759 
particular you can weigh these obviously
get<00:02:05.200> them<00:02:05.350> exact<00:02:05.770> and<00:02:06.190> then<00:02:06.610> you<00:02:07.030> form<00:02:07.330> them

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:07.769 
get them exact and then you form them
