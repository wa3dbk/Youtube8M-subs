00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.840
 minecraft video this one I'm doing 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.410
 the portions yes 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:19.900
 if you know how to be the positions then 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:22.210
 you can learn here this for the 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:25.090
 playstation edition when I am 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:27.610
 playing on playstation 4 this one 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:33.550
 I already made the first position, which is 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:35.200
 resistance to fire here is yes no 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:38.350
 You know how to do it, subscribe and 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:40.420
 see my videos there and you can board 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:44.970
 another position more here so much to which 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:47.960
 we will do we go to the next one that is this 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:47.960
 we are going to need 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:55.440
 one of these cracks are in the 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:55.440
 duty are those here 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:03.640
 and we will not need the three bottles 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:07.390
 with water with the 23 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:11.590
 we go here to here we put the three 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:14.230
 and a guard walk this faith is now this 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:17.800
 It is the position of strength 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:20.950
 then with the one that hits harder and that 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:26.310
 you make it with the blaze wand that is 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:30.360
 when he kills the blazers, you go here 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.940
 and here you have what 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:36.880
 well 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:40.380
 now we come if we put one of these and 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:45.210
 there now 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:47.159
 this may be optional ok 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.119
 what you add 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.119
 let's see here 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:57.020
 let's hope it comes full 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:03.240
 how can you see this has 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:07.940
 three minutes if we add the stone the 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.940
 position will last eight minutes 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.350
 that is really much better eight 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:18.260
 minutes instead of three minutes 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:18.260
 over here we will see control da 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:26.170
 eight minutes ok now so when the 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.780
 we take the stronger stick we kill 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:32.109
 faster enemies now there is something else 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.760
 you can do it with those who can 

00:02:32.109 --> 00:02:37.000
 put what they are 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:39.700
 that will make the position stronger 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.819
 be stronger so when you give it to you 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.620
 you take you hit harder than the first 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:47.260
 position that is normal let 's say it 's normal 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:50.800
 simply that it lasted longer but 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:54.660
 this is already phase 2 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.660
 as you can see there says phase 2 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.260
 if you need the shots you can hit more 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:03.370
 much stronger and now it's being 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:05.709
 this when you put gunpowder 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.430
 What is gunpowder? Nothing does not write but 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:10.819
 when you kill them 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:16.819
 the model leaves wants to leave here 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:18.969
 let's see what went down and here we go to 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:18.969
 watch 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:27.420
 and the cap that these two, then you can 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:30.140
 do this this will last a minute 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:33.090
 and medium but is stronger stronger 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:35.340
 this lasts eight minutes but is strong 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:39.090
 but that is or be a little stronger than 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:41.970
 the regular and this one is much stronger and 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:45.540
 this is simply so that 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:48.030
 explode when you have us to the ground and already 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:50.720
 you already have how you can see there says 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.720
 force ok 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:56.350
 good is the position of force so 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:58.950
 If you have any questions 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:02.020
 you can leave it there in the comments and 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:03.580
 we will continue with positions 7 3 a 

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:05.920
 other motions know in case no 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:09.000
 the birds so subscribe we list the 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:09.000
 next video goodbye
