00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:57.070 
here and take a look this is actually a

00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:00.420 
here and take a look this is actually a
very<00:05:57.400> ceramic<00:05:58.710> display<00:05:59.710> floor<00:05:59.980> that<00:06:00.160> we<00:06:00.250> have

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:00.430 
very ceramic display floor that we have

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:03.840 
very ceramic display floor that we have
here<00:06:00.990> so<00:06:01.990> you<00:06:02.830> can<00:06:03.010> see<00:06:03.220> by<00:06:03.400> looking<00:06:03.430> at<00:06:03.790> this

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:03.850 
here so you can see by looking at this

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:06.690 
here so you can see by looking at this
is<00:06:04.180> actually<00:06:04.540> a<00:06:04.750> grout<00:06:05.440> --less<00:06:05.710> installation

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:06.700 
is actually a grout --less installation

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:10.560 
is actually a grout --less installation
I<00:06:07.950> see<00:06:08.950> so<00:06:09.160> the<00:06:09.520> Duras<00:06:09.730> ceramic<00:06:10.060> has<00:06:10.150> a<00:06:10.210> little

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:10.570 
I see so the Duras ceramic has a little

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:12.900 
I see so the Duras ceramic has a little
bit<00:06:10.690> of<00:06:10.780> a<00:06:10.840> beveled<00:06:11.200> edge<00:06:11.320> to<00:06:11.680> it

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:12.910 
bit of a beveled edge to it

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:15.750 
bit of a beveled edge to it
so<00:06:13.620> actually<00:06:14.620> a<00:06:14.680> joint<00:06:15.010> sealer<00:06:15.340> goes<00:06:15.520> down

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:15.760 
so actually a joint sealer goes down

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:17.820 
so actually a joint sealer goes down
here<00:06:16.030> so<00:06:16.180> the<00:06:16.330> bevel<00:06:16.630> actually<00:06:16.990> is<00:06:17.110> sealed

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:17.830 
here so the bevel actually is sealed

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:21.150 
here so the bevel actually is sealed
over<00:06:18.010> the<00:06:18.160> top<00:06:18.340> very<00:06:19.270> easy<00:06:19.420> to<00:06:19.900> keep<00:06:20.050> clean<00:06:20.160> a
