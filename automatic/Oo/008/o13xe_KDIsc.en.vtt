00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.290

 good evening 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.250
 it does not ring me as comfortable because the waterfalls in the office on the 2 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.770
 little ears for a moment 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.930

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:53.900
 I take 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.580
 end of 2010 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:57.380
 then I believe 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.850
 to build with cartons artistically the wall of cartons 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.850
 it gives me a car 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.590
 see 

00:02:13.289 --> 00:02:15.400
 cassius while 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.469
 the waterfall at the exit of the schools 

00:02:17.469 --> 00:02:21.379
 it's when I go to get cassius at the tip 

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:26.599
 school and as I bring him back to his mother my beautiful in order to prove it 

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:29.599
 adaptation us 

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:34.000
 the design 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.080
 so I bring her back 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:41.560
 to his beauty in the car to prove that I am finally able 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:45.889
 first see driving a car owes more how is your beautiful called 

00:02:45.889 --> 00:02:47.159
 outfit 

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:50.369
 philippe nardi by m 

00:02:50.369 --> 00:02:52.569
 and she this pretty dangerous 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:55.569
 I have not born yet it's not uncommon it's 

00:02:57.939 --> 00:03:01.009
 a real dad me metaxas knew nothing about 

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:02.439
 Interpol 

00:03:02.439 --> 00:03:05.479
 no longer really the choice 

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:07.089
 we will play 

00:03:07.089 --> 00:03:10.469
 but I still had to do it 

00:03:10.469 --> 00:03:13.869
 I close my mouth yet asked 

00:03:13.869 --> 00:03:17.179
 in the past in a blog 

00:03:17.179 --> 00:03:20.179
 why after all why 

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:23.539
 this summer 

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:25.419
 Do you want 

00:03:25.419 --> 00:03:28.419
 the impression of having already seen at another school 

00:03:32.059 --> 00:03:33.219
 so 

00:03:33.219 --> 00:03:36.219
 you do not have the keys to the car 

00:03:39.179 --> 00:03:41.259
 an event in itself 

00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:43.219
 drum roll 

00:03:43.219 --> 00:03:44.429
 who cares 

00:03:44.429 --> 00:03:47.429
 without it justifies it by the decline 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:52.369
 otherwise it's the disaster 

00:03:52.369 --> 00:03:55.619
 as it appears that the car has persisted what I am going to make you say 

00:03:55.619 --> 00:03:58.619
 maybe the head-to-tail 

00:04:05.399 --> 00:04:06.449
 as I do not hurt anymore 

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:08.189
 the car 

00:04:08.189 --> 00:04:11.189
 swiss feast day 

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:15.109

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:20.129

00:04:20.129 --> 00:04:21.199
 lambert mende 

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:22.070

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:25.330
 France-evening 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:28.330

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:30.650
