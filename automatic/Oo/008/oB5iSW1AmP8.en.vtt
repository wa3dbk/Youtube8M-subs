then<00:01:39.299> you<00:01:39.329> tuck<00:01:39.829> these<00:01:40.829> sides<00:01:42.140> underneath<00:01:43.140> you

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
then you tuck these sides underneath you

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.770 
then you tuck these sides underneath you
so<00:01:44.640> that

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
so that

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.670 
so that
keep<00:01:46.350> that<00:01:46.530> body<00:01:46.710> heat<00:01:47.040> in<00:01:47.190> and<00:01:48.060> you<00:01:48.180> lay<00:01:48.360> in<00:01:48.540> it

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:48.680 
keep that body heat in and you lay in it

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.800 
keep that body heat in and you lay in it
like<00:01:49.680> that<00:01:50.030> that's<00:01:51.030> all<00:01:51.180> you<00:01:51.270> do<00:01:51.420> it's

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
like that that's all you do it's

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.899 
like that that's all you do it's
actually<00:01:51.960> pretty<00:01:52.290> simple<00:01:52.640> accordingly<00:01:53.640> you

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
actually pretty simple accordingly you

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.910 
actually pretty simple accordingly you
know<00:01:54.030> if<00:01:54.299> it's<00:01:54.509> colder<00:01:55.080> out<00:01:55.229> if<00:01:55.380> it's<00:01:55.530> warmer

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.410 
know if it's colder out if it's warmer
out<00:01:56.040> it's<00:01:56.580> depending<00:01:56.940> upon<00:01:57.060> what<00:01:57.330> you're

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
give a little bit of a sag to it so that

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.640 
give a little bit of a sag to it so that
it<00:03:13.350> stays<00:03:13.980> a<00:03:14.040> little<00:03:14.220> bit<00:03:14.720> flatter<00:03:15.720> secondly

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
it stays a little bit flatter secondly

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:17.569 
it stays a little bit flatter secondly
what<00:03:16.829> you<00:03:16.890> want<00:03:17.010> to<00:03:17.070> do<00:03:17.130> is<00:03:17.220> sleep<00:03:17.400> one

what you want to do is sleep one

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:19.729 
what you want to do is sleep one
diagonal<00:03:18.030> so<00:03:18.720> I'll<00:03:18.870> do<00:03:19.049> is<00:03:19.170> actually<00:03:19.350> pull

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
diagonal so I'll do is actually pull

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:23.599 
diagonal so I'll do is actually pull
this<00:03:19.980> this<00:03:20.519> side<00:03:20.790> we<00:03:21.380> had<00:03:22.380> towards<00:03:23.280> the<00:03:23.400> end

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:23.609 
this this side we had towards the end

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:24.200 
this this side we had towards the end
here

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:24.210 
here

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:26.600 
here
I<00:03:24.270> usually<00:03:25.170> just<00:03:25.410> use<00:03:25.650> these<00:03:25.980> as<00:03:26.160> markers

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
I usually just use these as markers
