00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
surgery so I would do four things number

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.220 
surgery so I would do four things number
one<00:00:18.779> is<00:00:19.560> I<00:00:19.890> would<00:00:20.070> change<00:00:20.400> my<00:00:20.609> activity<00:00:21.230> to

two<00:00:38.040> what<00:00:38.760> I<00:00:38.790> would<00:00:39.000> do<00:00:39.090> is<00:00:39.210> I<00:00:39.300> wouldn't<00:00:39.600> rush<00:00:40.079> I

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
two what I would do is I wouldn't rush I

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.459 
two what I would do is I wouldn't rush I
wouldn't<00:00:41.370> rush<00:00:41.579> into<00:00:41.879> surgery<00:00:42.120> unless<00:00:42.960> I<00:00:43.200> was

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
wouldn't rush into surgery unless I was

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.049 
wouldn't rush into surgery unless I was
having<00:00:43.800> neurologic<00:00:44.430> problems<00:00:44.879> like

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059

if<00:00:50.250> I<00:00:50.430> could<00:00:50.700> I'd<00:00:50.879> wait<00:00:51.149> this<00:00:51.360> out<00:00:51.570> because<00:00:52.440> I

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
if I could I'd wait this out because I

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.880 
if I could I'd wait this out because I
know<00:00:52.710> that<00:00:53.610> ninety<00:00:54.390> percent<00:00:54.420> of<00:00:54.780> times<00:00:55.050> this

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
know that ninety percent of times this

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.560 
know that ninety percent of times this
problem<00:00:56.190> gets<00:00:56.370> better<00:00:56.579> on<00:00:56.789> its<00:00:56.969> own<00:00:57.149> but<00:00:57.420> it

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
problem gets better on its own but it

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.319 
problem gets better on its own but it
can<00:00:57.780> take<00:00:58.020> six<00:00:58.649> eight<00:00:58.859> twelve<00:00:59.160> weeks<00:00:59.579> so

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
can take six eight twelve weeks so

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.799 
can take six eight twelve weeks so
number<00:01:00.600> two<00:01:00.840> is<00:01:01.050> give<00:01:01.649> it<00:01:01.770> time<00:01:02.390> number<00:01:03.390> three

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
number two is give it time number three

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.130 
number two is give it time number three
is<00:01:04.100> it's<00:01:05.100> important<00:01:05.640> to<00:01:06.270> get<00:01:06.450> someone

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
is it's important to get someone

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.020
