 crowded with historic cars as it could 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:08.930
 as can be the historic rally of 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:11.720
 montecarlo could not miss a 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:15.410
 important Italian stable that it is 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:19.010
 the milan historic car team here with 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:21.560
 we have the president Mr. of 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:23.540
 martino who will show us a little bit 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:26.510
 because as far as I understand there is really 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:30.380
 a nice car crew that participates in 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:33.500
 this sixteenth edition this year 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:36.850
 we are present with nine crews 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:40.690
 last year we were 12 anyway 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:42.590
 crews and their own prepared trained 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:46.370
 veteran of the 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:51.140
 of the historic rally of montecarlo then 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:53.540
 we hope to place ourselves properly 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:55.810
 let's not talk about victory anyway 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:58.069
 always hoping is always betting 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:00.709
 important as I said to participate but 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:03.620
 but you have had some have some 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:04.209
 illustrious that can lead to a neighbor to 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:07.040
 podium 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:12.440
 well anyway some crew is there 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:17.120
 in short, if you want I say we have that 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:21.470
 of eugenio rossi marco terenzi alberto 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:23.479
 bergamaschi danilo scarcella is, however, me 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:27.530
 seems to do a wrong to others because 

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:29.630
 we have the couple levering husband and wife 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:32.750
 they too are very aggressive and then 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:37.850
 we have samples that some leave 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:41.449
 from barcelona type carlo moats and his 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:44.510
 navigator that the name escapes me now 

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:48.680
 however, here are all the characters like 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:52.400
 this beautiful driven pictorial lanza 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:56.389
 from zanchi from peter zanchi and mandarin 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:05:00.050
 then we have the car deshaun and others 

00:04:56.389 --> 00:05:02.330
 that now don't say the name exactly 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:04.490
 however nine crews are not bad 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:07.190
 I would say that it is really a presence 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:09.080
 important and therefore as we also see a 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:11.360
 we Italians here at montecarlo don't 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:14.300
 we miss nothing then they say 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:16.370
 always good luck and and crack the 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:19.090
 wolf how to say thank you thank you 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:19.090

00:05:24.679 --> 00:05:28.719

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:29.530

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:32.920

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:36.280

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:54.610

00:06:36.280 --> 00:07:01.450
 row and women in your opinion which is a 

00:06:54.610 --> 00:07:06.300
 festival is American that after seven 

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:06.300
 Chinese in the limits 

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:25.610

00:07:13.099 --> 00:07:32.870
 not having been drawn up the newspapers that 

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:35.629

00:07:38.629 --> 00:07:42.159
