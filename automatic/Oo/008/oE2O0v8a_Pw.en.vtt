00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:19.939 
the website in a second where I where I

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:23.840 
the website in a second where I where I
purchased<00:00:20.939> it<00:00:21.060> from<00:00:22.100> just<00:00:23.100> give<00:00:23.310> me<00:00:23.340> a<00:00:23.460> second

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
purchased it from just give me a second

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.130 
purchased it from just give me a second
though<00:00:24.000> I'm<00:00:24.150> going<00:00:24.269> to<00:00:24.359> pop<00:00:24.539> this<00:00:24.660> back<00:00:24.869> down

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
though I'm going to pop this back down

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.920 
though I'm going to pop this back down
so<00:00:25.350> we<00:00:25.380> can<00:00:25.560> have<00:00:25.740> a<00:00:25.769> look<00:00:25.920> here<00:00:26.130> now<00:00:26.519> I<00:00:27.119> I<00:00:27.630> don't

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
so we can have a look here now I I don't

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.029 
so we can have a look here now I I don't
think<00:00:27.990> this<00:00:28.170> should<00:00:28.349> go<00:00:28.529> for<00:00:28.710> very<00:00:28.859> long

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
think this should go for very long

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.500 
think this should go for very long
because<00:00:29.189> really<00:00:29.550> isn't<00:00:29.820> all<00:00:29.910> that<00:00:29.970> much<00:00:30.119> to

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
because really isn't all that much to

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.690 
because really isn't all that much to
show<00:00:30.720> but<00:00:31.050> it<00:00:31.619> kind<00:00:32.189> of<00:00:32.219> looks<00:00:32.399> like<00:00:32.489> some

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
show but it kind of looks like some

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.490 
show but it kind of looks like some
weird<00:00:33.000> spidery<00:00:33.540> sort<00:00:33.870> of<00:00:33.960> thing<00:00:34.850> anyway<00:00:35.850> I

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:36.500 
weird spidery sort of thing anyway I

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.610 
weird spidery sort of thing anyway I
it's<00:00:37.500> pretty<00:00:37.829> cool<00:00:38.059> I've<00:00:39.059> i<00:00:39.570> purchased<00:00:40.230> it<00:00:40.350> so

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
it's pretty cool I've i purchased it so

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.030 
it's pretty cool I've i purchased it so
cheap<00:00:40.860> i<00:00:41.010> can't<00:00:41.280> believe<00:00:41.550> it<00:00:41.670> i<00:00:41.820> did<00:00:42.180> get<00:00:42.329> it

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:43.040 
cheap i can't believe it i did get it

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.279 
cheap i can't believe it i did get it
from<00:00:44.040> someone<00:00:44.430> in<00:00:44.640> Australia<00:00:45.239> so<00:00:45.450> I<00:00:45.480> believe

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
from someone in Australia so I believe

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:47.840 
from someone in Australia so I believe
that<00:00:46.620> Dave<00:00:46.770> most<00:00:47.070> likely<00:00:47.399> purchased<00:00:47.760> the

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
that Dave most likely purchased the

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.139 
that Dave most likely purchased the
whole<00:00:47.969> bulk<00:00:48.239> load<00:00:48.539> of<00:00:48.690> these<00:00:48.899> and<00:00:49.399> they<00:00:50.399> resell

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
whole bulk load of these and they resell

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.060 
whole bulk load of these and they resell
them<00:00:51.329> here<00:00:51.690> and<00:00:51.899> it<00:00:52.199> just<00:00:52.230> makes<00:00:52.620> it<00:00:52.739> that<00:00:52.800> it's

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
them here and it just makes it that it's

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.979

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
look at how much space there is here

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:19.640 
look at how much space there is here
between<00:02:17.190> these<00:02:17.760> and<00:02:18.060> how<00:02:18.720> thin<00:02:18.959> the<00:02:19.080> ipad<00:02:19.470> is

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
between these and how thin the ipad is

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.460 
between these and how thin the ipad is
so<00:02:19.940> usually<00:02:20.940> the<00:02:21.090> way<00:02:21.239> I<00:02:21.270> do<00:02:21.480> it<00:02:21.660> and<00:02:21.930> it's<00:02:22.080> it's

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
so usually the way I do it and it's it's

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.260 
so usually the way I do it and it's it's
generally<00:02:22.950> in<00:02:23.099> the<00:02:23.130> car<00:02:23.459> it's<00:02:24.000> already

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
generally in the car it's already

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.809 
generally in the car it's already
mounted<00:02:24.780> and<00:02:24.959> then<00:02:25.290> I<00:02:25.410> pop<00:02:25.650> this<00:02:25.800> in<00:02:26.010> there<00:02:26.220> I<00:02:26.370> I

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
mounted and then I pop this in there I I

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:29.780 
mounted and then I pop this in there I I
will<00:02:27.690> just<00:02:27.900> sort<00:02:28.230> of<00:02:28.319> see<00:02:28.860> the<00:02:29.010> flap<00:02:29.250> heel<00:02:29.459> lift

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
will just sort of see the flap heel lift

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.000 
will just sort of see the flap heel lift
that<00:02:29.940> up<00:02:30.000> and<00:02:30.300> then<00:02:30.930> bring<00:02:31.200> it<00:02:31.290> right<00:02:31.470> down<00:02:31.530> and

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
that up and then bring it right down and

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.850 
that up and then bring it right down and
I'll<00:02:32.370> try<00:02:32.940> and<00:02:33.060> keep<00:02:33.209> it<00:02:33.390> to<00:02:33.510> the<00:02:33.630> edge<00:02:33.860> okay

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
I'll try and keep it to the edge okay

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.280 
I'll try and keep it to the edge okay
now<00:02:35.160> it<00:02:35.280> does<00:02:35.430> have<00:02:35.610> rubber<00:02:35.940> to<00:02:36.720> rubber<00:02:36.750> stops

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
now it does have rubber to rubber stops

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.620 
now it does have rubber to rubber stops
everywhere<00:02:38.069> here<00:02:38.280> as<00:02:38.459> you<00:02:38.580> can<00:02:38.610> see<00:02:38.790> here<00:02:39.360> and

everywhere here as you can see here and

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.110 
everywhere here as you can see here and
up<00:02:40.590> there<00:02:40.620> as<00:02:41.069> well<00:02:41.280> there's<00:02:41.580> rubber<00:02:41.819> stops

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
up there as well there's rubber stops

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.820

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
got so much of a viewing angle here

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.880 
got so much of a viewing angle here
trying<00:03:17.190> to<00:03:17.340> record<00:03:17.760> this<00:03:17.970> and<00:03:18.260> it<00:03:19.260> pretty<00:03:19.799> much

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
trying to record this and it pretty much

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.789 
trying to record this and it pretty much
is<00:03:20.280> all<00:03:20.579> good<00:03:20.820> it<00:03:21.150> holds<00:03:21.390> its<00:03:22.049> not<00:03:22.350> going<00:03:22.560> that

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 
is all good it holds its not going that

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:26.449 
is all good it holds its not going that
way<00:03:22.950> okay<00:03:23.670> now<00:03:24.500> because<00:03:25.500> this<00:03:25.620> is<00:03:25.680> already<00:03:26.190> in

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
way okay now because this is already in

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:30.349 
way okay now because this is already in
usually<00:03:27.150> when<00:03:27.329> I'm<00:03:27.480> I'm<00:03:27.870> installing<00:03:28.440> it<00:03:29.359> it's

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:30.359 
usually when I'm I'm installing it it's

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:33.890 
usually when I'm I'm installing it it's
already<00:03:30.630> connected<00:03:32.000> it's<00:03:33.000> a<00:03:33.150> lot<00:03:33.329> easier<00:03:33.359> now

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
already connected it's a lot easier now

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.380 
already connected it's a lot easier now
these<00:03:34.739> bits<00:03:35.100> here<00:03:35.190> these<00:03:35.820> are<00:03:36.000> the<00:03:36.090> bits<00:03:36.239> that

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
these bits here these are the bits that

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:42.680 
these bits here these are the bits that
go<00:03:36.709> on<00:03:40.310> basically<00:03:41.310> you<00:03:41.459> know<00:03:41.549> it<00:03:41.730> depends<00:03:42.570> on

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
go on basically you know it depends on

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:46.039 
go on basically you know it depends on
your<00:03:42.810> car<00:03:43.049> really<00:03:43.350> I'd<00:03:43.739> say<00:03:44.010> but<00:03:44.280> um<00:03:44.720> my<00:03:45.720> car

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:46.049 
your car really I'd say but um my car

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:49.640 
your car really I'd say but um my car
has<00:03:46.290> a<00:03:46.640> head<00:03:47.640> head<00:03:48.570> rests<00:03:48.900> at<00:03:49.019> the<00:03:49.109> back<00:03:49.320> so

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
has a head head rests at the back so

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.190 
has a head head rests at the back so
you've<00:03:49.920> got<00:03:49.950> you<00:03:50.340> you've<00:03:50.790> got<00:03:51.030> the<00:03:51.209> car<00:03:51.720> itself

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200
