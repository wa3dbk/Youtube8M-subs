00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:09.950
 hello today there is an almond 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:13.719
 Cherry cake with a very special 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:16.940
 trick and I show you like that 

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:22.870
 the beautiful fruit in the middle of the churches 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:25.570
 the churches remain a glass deposit 

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:30.590
 Drain 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:34.060
 because say dispose of me and then 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:36.820
 comes a good shot of kirsch water 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:40.430
 that does not necessarily have to be 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:43.100
 but it tastes better I bake 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:46.489
 yes like with a little alcohol 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:48.670
 You probably already noticed that, though 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:53.750
 Of course you can always come back 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:56.960
 exchange cream milk or otherwise 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.399
 any juices that does not have to 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.559
 always be unconditional 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:02.980
 yes, so the cherries are now 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:09.190
 deducted as well as in the 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:12.650
 black forest cake little mondamine 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:18.130
 or food starch and a 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:23.020
 pinch cinnamon and now that 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:28.990
 Expired juice with the cooling water 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:31.670
 that's enough of cooked and cooked 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:34.250
 then the coasts come to me 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:38.900
 a little bit more water is needed 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:42.590
 added or was done 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:45.490
 a little bit of pudding so to speak 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:50.560
 and here come the cherries rhine 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:54.430
 not much of this mix well 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:56.869
 pudding just so that the cherries 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.729
 are bound and then comes the trick 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:01.729
 17 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:06.729
 and opladen I have two here 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:09.560
 big or three big opladen 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:12.380
 I climb me now really so 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:16.400
 that they are in shape when the cash registers 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:18.520
 or here in the springform 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.500
 fit in 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:26.840
 they will then be laid out with it 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:29.440
 the cherries can not sink and 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:32.930
 do not overlay these opladen 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:34.910
 but only individual and to 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:38.980
 Of course, preparation also belongs 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:41.810
 Turn the flour into the baking powder 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:46.730
 and then come the hacked ones 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:50.960
 almonds a square roughly chopped way 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:54.560
 almonds that will be mixed well now 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:57.560
 butter vanilla sugar and lemons 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:00.350
 sugar, of course, everything yourself 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:04.700
 you know that you need yes 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:07.190
 just look in my videos and 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.300
 below, I will also link 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:10.940
 use 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:13.310
 then you do not need to look far 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:16.490
 already was the butter with the 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:19.960
 sugar foamy stirred 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:23.420
 support I give an egg to it 

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:25.930
 if the mother is a bit too tight then 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:29.000
 it can be better frothy stir 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:33.410
 yes and now, of course, as always 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:38.210
 with her from the side of the 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:40.610
 dough or the butter replaced with it too 

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:44.840
 really everything evenly foamy 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:47.930
 is stirred and stirring is so long 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:52.700
 sugar has dissolved and the butter 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:57.760
 white is foamy and is that all then 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:04:01.360
 as far as you can go with her 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:07.880
 the legal eggs and the flour 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:10.400
 alternately underneath and this mass 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.890
 must not be frothy 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:15.290
 to be stirred 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:19.600
 We also have before the buttery-looking 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:22.370
 with theories with flour in no case 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:24.880
 the dough draws together 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:28.600
 straw and tastes 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:33.310
 not that there was a deadly sin 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:35.340
 When packing biomass with flour frothy 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:35.340
 stir 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:42.660
 sorry but so far now is the crowd 

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:46.000
 in the prepared springform 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:51.280
 I filled in there again 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:54.600
 bow or bread paper inserted and there 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:58.030
 now comes the mass evenly 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:05:03.700
 filled about half the size 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:06.700
 delete and then the opladen on it 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:12.990
 If possible, do not overlay them 

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:16.030
 but just hang up the turks 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:19.960
 not quite on the run big about good 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:22.930
 let centimeter square if the 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:23.470
 cherries rand do not see out 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:25.360
 beautiful 

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:27.820
 and now I have a mistake again 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:29.950
 I made the whole mass in the 

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:32.850
 middle view to pass 

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:36.040
 I should not have done that because 

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:38.740
 she has my cherries down now 

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:41.950
 my picture is pressed apart 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:42.970
 have broached we do not see that then 

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:47.290
 be very nice 

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:47.890
 when circulated 180 degrees about 60 minutes 

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:52.030
 to bake 

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:54.520
 this cake takes a little longer because 

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:57.960
 but moisture in the middle can be 

00:05:54.520 --> 00:06:00.970
 that takes a little longer to pack 

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:04.090
 something has also come to my mind 

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:08.470
 in the middle because I'm too soon out of the 

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:13.960
 oven out says yes fall 

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:16.710
 let it cool and then it can 

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:21.630
 either with a chocolate glaze 

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:24.420
 or just with icing sugar 

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:26.890
 be overwhelmed 

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:30.810
 i liked it with icing sugar 

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:33.400
 Actually, I'm not so sweet either 

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:33.990
 yes and that was it already 

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:37.400
 again 

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:40.130
 and ammann cut will see you then 

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:45.080
 pressed the cherries apart 

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:46.660
 and here are the small parts because he does not 

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:49.699
 was completely finished 

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:54.460
 but I do not like it either 

00:06:49.699 --> 00:07:02.600
 day so that's forgiven me 

00:06:54.460 --> 00:07:06.520
 I too make mistakes like that and now that 

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:06.520
 big cut 

00:07:07.449 --> 00:07:17.030
 they are not quite what you are 

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:20.270
 you know the cherries apart 

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:23.810
 because I just pressed the whole thing 

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:28.460
 mass at once in the middle 

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:33.380
 have yes and then it should be now 

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:36.349
 usually look and you think 

00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:39.080
 on the thumbs up and also on 

00:07:36.349 --> 00:07:42.740
 friendly comments I answer 

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:45.789
 They also like to ask if you have it 

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:45.789
 Until next time
