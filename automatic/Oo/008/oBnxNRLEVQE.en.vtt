00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.910
 there are only three of them in this case 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.560
 I will teach with the torrent do not forget that 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.800
 The main thing they need is the 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:32.369
 internet and a psp with custom firmware 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.469
 well let's start first of all 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.200
 download the torrent program or 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:40.489
 any other function is the same 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.489
 install as normal 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.990
 As you can see I already have here the 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.790
 direct access 

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:49.790
 now we open the program 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:56.690
 and this is where we will download all the 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:00.789
 games we want but before 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.789
 we need the link in torrent format 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:08.750
 for this we will need to go to a page 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:12.619
 of free download of games one of 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:14.630
 it is pal psp dotcom do not forget 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:17.210
 they need to be subscribed to 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:21.340
 to be able to download games like me 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:21.340
 in my case I already have my session started 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:28.770
 here we can see that we have several 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.770
 games of the newest to download 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:34.200
 there is also the game search engine in 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.899
 this time we will look for one called sip 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:40.140
 on filter logan shadow a very good game 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:44.420
 by the way we simply put the name 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.420
 or part of it and we give you look 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.600
 and here come the results of the 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:57.900
 search only we click on one of 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.900
 they 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.300
 normally in the forms of discharge of 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.060
 these games are the one that I am 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:13.700
 explaining now the one of the torrent also 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:16.670
 another call comes out for another call the 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.980
 link and another call direct download in 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.750
 my next video I will try to explain the 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.880
 direct download that is by means of 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:26.600
 servers like rapidshare and so on 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:29.270
 now we give to download torrent les 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:33.610
 will ask that they keep it they do it since 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:33.610
 it does not weigh more than 1 or 2 megabytes 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:43.200
 now they look for it in their desk or in 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:43.200
 where they put him to be saved 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.040
 in my case it is on the desk 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.840
 this one here is the so-called torrent 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:11.890
 now we open our program that in my 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.520
 case is the torrent and there in the area 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:17.290
 white we drag the downloaded torrent 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:19.510
 this will start immediately 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.610
 to download the game file 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:24.340
 maybe it will take a while but at the end 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:26.940
 it will be worth it in my case I already had it 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.940
 initiated 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:34.040
 now only wait time 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.430
 download will depend on the speed of your 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.430
 Internet 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:45.580
 automatically the file will go 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:49.770
 downloading to your desktop or to the site 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:49.770
 that you have selected for your download 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:59.830
 the average games come to weigh between 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:59.830
 800 megabytes and one gig with 200 megabytes 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.860
 once it has finished 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:10.260
 download will have a file that can or 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:12.360
 not having the winrar icon is only 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:14.870
 thing to open the file downloaded with 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.870
 the winrar 

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:22.340
 there you may find more than one 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:26.950
 file but just open the one in the folder 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:26.950
 call iso there will be our game 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:33.130
 that 's where the game is 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:39.099
 now simply drag it in the 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:39.099
 desk 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:50.199
 and there is our game now, just 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:51.910

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:54.280
 must appear in your memory at 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:56.229
 principle the folder called iso if not 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:59.620
 is you create it with the name in 

00:04:56.229 --> 00:05:02.740
 capital letters there in that folder we put the 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:04.900
 game of the desk and ready now only 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:07.600
 we unplug it and from the psp menu 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:10.889
 in game and memory stick we execute the 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:10.889
 game and ready to play 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:18.349
