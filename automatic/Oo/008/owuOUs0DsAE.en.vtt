00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:10.680
 I've learned that smiling is a way 

00:00:06.819 --> 00:00:13.370
 economic to improve the appearance 

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.370
 all right 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:30.130
 you are in your third age and you already know 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:33.460
 I ended life and everything 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:36.760
 here a new stage begins 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:40.449
 in which you must take care of yourself 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:43.579
 Enjoy your children's grandchildren and 

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:46.909
 why not your healthy life 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:50.629
 generally in the third age there is more 

00:00:46.909 --> 00:00:53.809
 tendency to have diabetes anemia 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:58.640
 hypertension for that reason there 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:01:01.149
 to pay attention to comply with 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:03.369
 the nutritional principles at this stage 

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:06.979
 because the energy needs 

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:11.330
 they decrease and because they decrease because 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:13.729
 there is less physical activity and then it is 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:16.399
 that you have to keep in mind you have to 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:18.880
 decrease the energy value but there 

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:22.680
 that cover the nutritional principles 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:26.280
 because to avoid getting sick 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:29.790
 what happens with feeding 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.680
 in this stage they lose the motivation 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.430
 because they have some 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.530
 Gastrointestinal intolerances 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:39.570
 because maybe they are depressed by the 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:43.229
 loss of a family member especially 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:45.869
 husband or a close family member have 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:48.810
 dental problems also difficulties 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:51.320
 with the flavors that many times 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:55.200
 decreases the sensation of the flavors 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:57.299
 what to eat and how much to eat 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:02.369
 Do not stop including in your diet 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:07.369
 daily potato sweet potato corn rice pasta 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:10.019
 whole-grain breads with respect to vegetables 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:12.420
 if you have any level of intolerance 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:15.230
 gastrointestinal tract you have to select the 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:18.450
 vegetables but you do not have to eliminate them 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:21.170
 no matter how much you have diverticula for more 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.670
 have any symptoms of gastritis 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:26.819
 you always have to take into account in 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.410
 what stage are you going to be but to include us 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:30.870
 you have to include us you have to 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:34.560
 consult with a professional so that 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:36.180
 determine with you what types of 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.010
 vegetables you should include in your 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:41.819
 area feeding and in what way the 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:44.390
 you are going to cook so that you do not exacerbate the 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:47.540
 unpleasant symptom 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:50.870
 when you are well enter your body 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.819
 raw vegetables because they have fiber this 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:56.420
 will help you in case you have 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:59.840
 high cholesterol to drag the 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:04.130
 Blood cholesterol tries to include 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:06.190
 daily fish that also because 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:09.380
 They are soft and are easily 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:12.050
 chewable then bolt or chew xii 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:16.220
 digests fast always accompanied by 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:18.650
 raw or steamed vegetables treats 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:24.590
 to choose canola olive oils 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:26.810
 sunflower not in frying but in raw 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:29.840
 another important thing is that 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:32.900
 try to avoid salt drinks 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:35.900
 alcoholic drinks and coffee and as dessert one 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:38.600
 fruit that can also be in compote 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:41.840
 without the shell 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:47.420
 do not think only of your grandchildren but 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:49.340
 think about your life in a healthy way I 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:52.520
 I tell you that you are going to do the activity 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:54.800
 physical to a gym but if I tell you that 

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:56.440
 walk daily that will help you 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:59.660
 because it's going to increase endorphins 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:02.500
 It will help you feel better 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:05.830
 relate compare third age 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:10.550
 different to other stages but it's 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:13.010
 important that you take care of yourself and you 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:17.060
 life will do to the extent that you 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:20.350
 you want better and better for your optimism 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.350
 having a present 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:30.550
 there are three things in life that can 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:34.979
 destroy a person the anger the 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:34.979
 pride and not knowing how to forgive
