maybe<00:03:58.470> two<00:03:58.680> hundred<00:03:58.709> dollars<00:03:59.310> would<00:03:59.820> be

maybe two hundred dollars would be

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.990 
maybe two hundred dollars would be
easier<00:04:00.510> to<00:04:00.570> recommend<00:04:01.170> but<00:04:01.709> for<00:04:01.920> 299<00:04:02.400> it<00:04:02.700> just

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
easier to recommend but for 299 it just

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.550 
easier to recommend but for 299 it just
