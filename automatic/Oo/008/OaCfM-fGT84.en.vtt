00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
pc had trouble was running them and I've

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.030 
pc had trouble was running them and I've
quickly<00:01:18.600> viewed<00:01:18.869> a<00:01:18.960> few<00:01:19.200> messages<00:01:19.350> and

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
quickly viewed a few messages and

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.070 
quickly viewed a few messages and
whipped<00:01:20.700> off<00:01:20.939> some<00:01:21.270> of<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.420> texture<00:01:21.840> packs

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
whipped off some of the texture packs

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.050 
whipped off some of the texture packs
that<00:01:22.229> people<00:01:22.710> thought<00:01:22.950> were<00:01:23.009> amazing<00:01:23.850> and

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
that people thought were amazing and

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.880 
that people thought were amazing and
this<00:01:24.900> was<00:01:25.229> one<00:01:25.409> of<00:01:25.590> them<00:01:25.770> and<00:01:26.009> this<00:01:26.520> is<00:01:27.530> 128<00:01:28.530> x

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
this was one of them and this is 128 x

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.810 
this was one of them and this is 128 x
128<00:01:29.729> so<00:01:30.600> it's<00:01:30.780> a<00:01:30.930> really<00:01:31.380> massive<00:01:32.100> huge

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
128 so it's a really massive huge

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.330 
128 so it's a really massive huge
texture<00:01:33.329> pack<00:01:33.540> I<00:01:33.900> think<00:01:34.470> it's<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.890> biggest

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
texture pack I think it's the biggest

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.580 
texture pack I think it's the biggest
texture<00:01:35.820> pack<00:01:36.030> like<00:01:36.270> and<00:01:36.479> find<00:01:36.750> light<00:01:37.110> is<00:01:37.320> in

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
texture pack like and find light is in

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.219 
texture pack like and find light is in
the<00:01:37.680> largest<00:01:38.040> file<00:01:38.280> size<00:01:38.610> and<00:01:38.970> right<00:01:39.229> what

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
the largest file size and right what

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.170 
the largest file size and right what
crashes<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:40.920> most<00:01:41.100> pcs<00:01:41.579> because<00:01:41.970> I<00:01:42.090> actually

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
crashes the most pcs because I actually

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.819 
crashes the most pcs because I actually
looked<00:01:42.630> up<00:01:42.750> with<00:01:42.869> the<00:01:42.930> comments<00:01:43.470> on<00:01:43.619> them

texture pack which isn't bad considering

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.870 
texture pack which isn't bad considering
you<00:03:15.360> know<00:03:15.390> it<00:03:15.720> is<00:03:15.900> a<00:03:15.930> really<00:03:16.560> huge<00:03:17.250> hitch<00:03:17.670> to

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
you know it is a really huge hitch to

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.880 
you know it is a really huge hitch to
pack<00:03:18.120> obviously<00:03:18.840> up<00:03:18.959> my<00:03:19.230> piece<00:03:19.500> you<00:03:19.709> could

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
pack obviously up my piece you could

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.000 
pack obviously up my piece you could
probably<00:03:20.100> handle<00:03:20.400> like<00:03:20.730> 256<00:03:21.660> or<00:03:22.170> maybe<00:03:22.890> even

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
probably handle like 256 or maybe even

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.360 
probably handle like 256 or maybe even
more<00:03:23.340> like<00:03:23.519> 512<00:03:24.350> which<00:03:25.350> I<00:03:25.590> haven't<00:03:25.920> found<00:03:26.100> any

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
more like 512 which I haven't found any

texture<00:03:26.820> packs<00:03:27.060> out<00:03:27.329> at<00:03:27.540> the<00:03:27.660> moment<00:03:27.840> but

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
texture packs out at the moment but

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:31.069 
texture packs out at the moment but
there's<00:03:28.980> another<00:03:29.280> feature<00:03:29.700> of<00:03:30.150> Minecraft<00:03:30.900> I

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:31.079 
there's another feature of Minecraft I

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:32.630 
there's another feature of Minecraft I
didn't<00:03:31.410> know<00:03:31.440> which<00:03:31.890> is<00:03:32.040> filled<00:03:32.250> with<00:03:32.370> you

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 
didn't know which is filled with you

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.599 
didn't know which is filled with you
which<00:03:32.910> I<00:03:33.090> just<00:03:33.329> done<00:03:33.540> and<00:03:34.100> it<00:03:35.100> looks<00:03:35.130> amazing

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:35.609 
which I just done and it looks amazing

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:38.449 
which I just done and it looks amazing
as<00:03:36.329> you<00:03:36.510> can<00:03:36.630> see<00:03:36.870> but<00:03:37.769> sometimes<00:03:38.010> it's

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
as you can see but sometimes it's

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:40.160 
as you can see but sometimes it's
difficult<00:03:38.519> to<00:03:39.060> turn<00:03:39.359> because<00:03:39.750> you<00:03:39.900> end<00:03:40.019> up

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
difficult to turn because you end up

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:43.729 
difficult to turn because you end up
like<00:03:40.700> turning<00:03:41.700> a<00:03:41.940> lot<00:03:42.540> less<00:03:42.810> because<00:03:43.170> you<00:03:43.410> lot

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
like turning a lot less because you lot

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:46.250 
like turning a lot less because you lot
why<00:03:44.670> I<00:03:44.700> generally<00:03:45.359> think<00:03:45.390> this<00:03:45.720> takes<00:03:45.930> to<00:03:46.109> pack

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
why I generally think this takes to pack

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.890 
why I generally think this takes to pack
does<00:03:46.470> look<00:03:46.680> amazing<00:03:46.769> I<00:03:47.370> actually<00:03:48.269> remember

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
does look amazing I actually remember

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.620 
does look amazing I actually remember
back<00:03:49.109> in<00:03:49.140> the<00:03:49.410> day<00:03:49.650> when<00:03:50.010> you<00:03:50.970> know<00:03:51.120> no<00:03:51.390> one

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
just seananners and he post up just one

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.039 
just seananners and he post up just one
video<00:03:56.090> saying<00:03:57.090> that<00:03:57.359> this<00:03:57.510> game<00:03:57.750> was<00:03:57.900> amazing

00:03:58.039 --> 00:03:58.049

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
he come across it and he got really

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.849 
he come across it and he got really
badly<00:04:01.590> addicted<00:04:02.250> to<00:04:02.430> it<00:04:02.579> and<00:04:03.350> all<00:04:04.350> my<00:04:04.650> mates

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:06.620 
badly addicted to it and all my mates
will<00:04:05.310> look<00:04:05.430> like<00:04:05.640> watch<00:04:05.880> the<00:04:06.090> video<00:04:06.359> watch<00:04:06.569> the
