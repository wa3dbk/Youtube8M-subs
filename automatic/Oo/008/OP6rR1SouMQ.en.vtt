00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:05.659 
combined everything pretty well together

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:08.330 
combined everything pretty well together
and<00:01:06.659> I<00:01:06.780> think<00:01:06.840> that<00:01:07.170> well<00:01:07.530> let's<00:01:07.979> try<00:01:08.130> it<00:01:08.220> out

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
and I think that well let's try it out

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.679 
and I think that well let's try it out
and<00:01:08.490> see<00:01:08.580> how<00:01:08.729> it<00:01:08.850> goes<00:01:08.880> as<00:01:09.210> far<00:01:09.240> as<00:01:09.450> getting

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
and see how it goes as far as getting

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:17.539 
and see how it goes as far as getting
the<00:01:09.930> de<00:01:10.320> la<00:01:10.380> cruz<00:01:15.920> yeah<00:01:16.920> I<00:01:17.070> mean<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.400> dough

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
the de la cruz yeah I mean the dough

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.789 
the de la cruz yeah I mean the dough
just<00:01:17.820> kind<00:01:18.000> of<00:01:18.110> comes<00:01:19.110> off<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.409> whisk<00:01:19.590> pretty

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
just kind of comes off the whisk pretty

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.490 
just kind of comes off the whisk pretty
easily

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
easily

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.590 
easily
yeah<00:01:22.820> excuse<00:01:23.820> me<00:01:23.850> how<00:01:24.090> long<00:01:24.150> will<00:01:24.390> that<00:01:24.420> I've

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
yeah excuse me how long will that I've

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.350 
yeah excuse me how long will that I've
taken<00:01:24.750> you<00:01:25.049> like<00:01:25.290> with<00:01:26.040> using<00:01:26.460> your<00:01:26.580> hands<00:01:26.939> the

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.600 
taken you like with using your hands the
same<00:01:27.570> amount<00:01:27.810> of<00:01:27.900> time<00:01:28.110> but<00:01:28.500> it<00:01:28.560> okay<00:01:29.220> so<00:01:29.280> it

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
same amount of time but it okay so it

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.609 
same amount of time but it okay so it
doesn't<00:01:29.909> really<00:01:29.970> save<00:01:30.329> time<00:01:30.630> it<00:01:30.930> just<00:01:31.140> is<00:01:31.439> less

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
doesn't really save time it just is less

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.230 
doesn't really save time it just is less
mess<00:01:31.860> yes<00:01:32.340> that<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:32.820> idea

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
mess yes that the idea

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.969 
mess yes that the idea
yeah<00:01:33.600> means<00:01:33.810> definitely<00:01:34.170> less<00:01:34.290> messy<00:01:34.619> and<00:01:34.890> I

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
yeah means definitely less messy and I

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.460 
yeah means definitely less messy and I
think<00:01:35.220> it<00:01:35.310> does<00:01:35.430> a<00:01:35.460> better<00:01:35.670> job<00:01:35.790> but<00:01:36.119> probably

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
think it does a better job but probably

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.719 
think it does a better job but probably
mixing<00:01:37.470> all<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.710> dough<00:01:37.829> together<00:01:38.009> they're

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
no no it's designed to just I say it's

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.350 
no no it's designed to just I say it's
actually<00:01:49.259> quite<00:01:49.439> through<00:01:49.740> yeah<00:01:50.070> hard<00:01:50.430> okay

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
actually quite through yeah hard okay

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.480 
actually quite through yeah hard okay
but<00:01:51.869> that<00:01:52.380> was<00:01:52.530> fast<00:01:52.799> I<00:01:52.979> mean<00:01:53.130> you<00:01:53.220> saw<00:01:53.369> how
