 with damages and fishing 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:15.139
 and I already missed them quite a lot 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:16.970
 two weeks we have not done a video 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:18.740
 for you is that I still like to go up 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:20.779
 of the other types of videos where I 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:22.730
 move and stuff I do not like 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:24.259
 do it but it was but also 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.789
 videos in which we practice because 

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:27.320
 you saw that you also like 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:32.850
 these for me then if they were already 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:35.309
 mind that my hair turned back 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.140
 I did not paint it like the last time because 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.420
 I like it more so it looks more 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.610
 disguised and not so exaggerated for in 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.379
 Today I am going to tell you about what 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.570
 it happened to me in the week that Thursday 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.329
 I had an exam and how can 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.670
 I'm studying what I did a little 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:53.640
 little piece of paper where little information came 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.339
 either they know that when we do a how 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.809
 it's called CÃ³rdoba is a super summary of 

00:00:56.339 --> 00:01:00.510
 everything you 've seen in a certain time 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.729
 I honestly am not good at 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.769
 get accordions on any exam I've 

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:07.649
 tried from high school up 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.450
 now there are times that never never 

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:11.550
 sac because for example when you wrote 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.500
 things in my hands I was like that sometimes 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:16.470
 and began to sweat and caves was of 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.810
 view or erased the last time already 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.819
 I had a little leaf like that 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.350
 this size I was late for the exam and the 

00:01:20.819 --> 00:01:24.060
 teacher I feel up front I carry 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.009
 that will have sent the batteries and diaz 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.569
 kids that run out of huge roles 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.700
 and the mansion opposite did not see them 

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:32.130
 he chose and chiles tomatoes three of those 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.990
 they do not see or really do not see it 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.909
 I said well I'm going to take mine almost 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.690
 just my exam I just needed to take out 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.900
 a 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:42.030
 formula so that one that he gave me they did not have 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.650
 I put the fist in my hand like that and I 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.430
 I was writing the hand is for 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:46.260
 in front of me 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.000
 I said well he has to come and see something and he's 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:50.640
 behind me good I keep writing 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.820
 he grabs my hand he gives me lifts and he 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.820
 wta 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:59.600
 I take off I remembered or I take the exam 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:02.120
 and to finish it I was the only kind of 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.740
 red color in the room that I imagine 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:06.620
 putting me red and still in the city 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.180
 It was red and I was very very sad and 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:10.070
 better not do accordion I do not know if what 

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:12.620
 do I know when to take them out once 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:14.150
 I tried to put a piece of paper in a pen and 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.040
 I'm even afraid to turn to see my 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:18.740
 pen feels that the teacher looked at me 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.600
 also hide the piece of paper inside of 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:22.370
 the calculator makes me more 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.800
 easy but still gives me a lot of fear 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:28.100
 I realize that it starts to shake I put 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:31.010
 so nervous worse than being watching a 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:33.110
 horror movie alone at night with the 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:36.240
 I do not serve to take off lights 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:38.220
 actions talking about horror 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.690
 I do not know if you have seen the mom trailer 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.340
 it looks like it's going to be great this 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.960
 movie once they were there 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.300
 put of guillermo del toro that is 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:47.610
 very much the movies the gentleman deals 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:50.010
 about two girls who are lost in the 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:52.410
 forest and his mom murdered and then the 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:55.200
 you find them, but we are more 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.760
 that you will have of them try to take care of them 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.380
 or something like that now it looks like it's going to be 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.940
 chida because our leader also like 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:03.320
 that you nail yourself and so I 'm waiting for you 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.320
 how to be in the cinema 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:09.670
 another movie that I recommend watching 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:12.040
 it's called I'm number 4 and if not the 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.810
 have seen they will like it because they have 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.360
 Well, what interests me is my bear 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.430
 guys who are the indigenous and there is another 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.860
 all weird species that seem like 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.630
 sharks that want to hunt 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.580
 behind the number 4 they will try 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:28.430
 kill and suppose chido because it does not 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:30.439
 directing doing powers and these things 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:32.420
 a movie that is also seen to be 

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:34.640
 activity is like this free test you know 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:37.069
 all this is fashionable that of meetings 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:39.290
 children and pass them to action are two 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:41.120
 brothers who managed to escape when 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:43.879
 they were children of a witch and already of great 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:45.530
 happen to all witches but here according to 

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:55.000
 they are going to face one that is 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:55.000
 too powerful and ghost 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:15.710
 it did not move 

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:22.190
 a movie that I liked to go out on 

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:24.650
 2012 in September I think 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:26.690
 the appearance is called to many people 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:29.120
 They did not like it but there really is 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:32.390
 kept entertaining is about a 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:34.910
 couple that is threatened by the issue 

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:37.190
 worthy this attacks them because long ago 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:39.650
 the guy named once was with a 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:41.840
 small group trying to show that the 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:43.910
 spirits and things exist and that 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:46.460
 they are really here with us that 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:48.260
 malignant to the 300 this people what 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:50.600
 does is feed on all the fear and 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:52.190
 every one that traps a person and goes 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.720
 learning more the couple tries 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:55.970
 escape from but 20 is impossible 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:58.070
 contact a paranormal expert but 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:00.230
 even with the help of him they realize 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:01.880
 that they can not escape from this entity and 

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:03.890

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:10.840

 If it is net typical equipment then full of 

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:26.909
 where cinema is going to get more 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:29.370
