 what was the content acid like that 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:02.069
 why because if you will do 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:04.979
 so you will have to take the middle bunch 

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:07.229
 sen load cargo to lower take 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:11.880

 load distributed more powerful 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:29.710
 there will be a front beam 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:32.410
 the average games are already smaller further as 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:33.480
 what are the biggest mistakes mistakes 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:38.290
 mostly such 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.890
 many guys are talking about mixing

 stretched and as little as possible but she 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.520
 tense if you reduce you will 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.940
 stress 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:12.430
 you will all load go stormy and 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.850
 whole half exactly if you took away
