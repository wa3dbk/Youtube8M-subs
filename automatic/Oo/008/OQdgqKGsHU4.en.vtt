 it continues in fact especially in the 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.610
 sardinia centrale the intense traffic of 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.410
 unidentified aircraft that trace 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:21.290
 white stripes other than those 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.520
 produced by scheduled aircraft 

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:25.980
 intersecting each other they generate 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:28.520
 lattice that expands forming a 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.350
 cloudy surface over a very large area 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:32.369
 international scientific circles 

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:34.260
 support the thesis that the traces 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.900
 contain substances that are harmful to health 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.879
 as it was called metals of other nature 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:41.070
 according to some the story would be 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.470
 attributable to military experiments or 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:47.790
 civilian for radio communications or for 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:50.100
 cause climate change over 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:53.070
 our faces looked up at the sky 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.830
 we are all involved there is chemistry 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.500
 why don't you listen to nature cries 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:01:01.379
 we are more and more upset about wanting trails 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.850
 Chemicals Above Our Bodies Pulls Up 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.750
 look to the sky we are all involved 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:11.150
 I want chemical and why don't you listen to the 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:14.640
 nature like we are more and more upset 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:16.620
 what I talk about computer data eat the 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.170
 brain like a wagon keep us 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:21.300
 in the dark and they know they can do it 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:27.090
 hidden truths hurt me not 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:29.910
 mistake the sky leaves the scene 1 limits 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:34.159
 compact military projects from which one does not 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:36.960
 they can escape from the ionosphere 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:39.960
 above our faces drawn our gaze 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.869
 to heaven we are all involved trails 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.850
 chemical because you don't listen but nature 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.340
 white we are more and more upset 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.350
 I want chemtrails over ours 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.780
 remember who from the look at the sky 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.689
 we are all involved I want to be born 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:57.330
 clinics so you don't listen to nature 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:59.670
 like we are more and more upset in the 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.799
 sky long white trails but it is not 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.479
 the normal see that expands and 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:06.030
 slowly then it rises and falls 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.459
 in the atmosphere and we start to inhale 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.950
 but you are aware that it is a 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.090
 breathe heavy metal silicon game 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.920
 nobody escapes everyone we breathe 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.200
 how many tons of iron and aluminum and 2 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.610
 neroni 6 what combine magni only of e 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.799
 various way to show him the opposite 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.350
 they do not believe in bringing us into some 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:23.430
 other lab exam play with 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:25.680
 our lives 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:28.830
 we are like dogs and we go around with them 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:31.560
 injure an avian or cesium mad cow 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:34.769
 dispute new new diseases every year 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:37.500
 affected people play with ours 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:41.790
 ideas experiments and intoxications but never 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:44.190
 finished cancer vaccine aids affect are 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:47.910
 increasingly the diseases with which to 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:51.530
 stiff over our drawn faces 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.530
 look to the sky we are all involved 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:57.920
 do not listen to nature like we are always 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:00.349
 the more upset I want there is chemistry above 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.720
 our bodies pull on the look at 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:05.270
 heaven we are all involved want 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:09.819
 chosen by michele because you don't listen to the 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:09.819
 nature is crying we are more and more upset 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.709
 it continues in fact especially in the 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:41.840

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:50.239
 intersecting each other genus I had 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:52.750
