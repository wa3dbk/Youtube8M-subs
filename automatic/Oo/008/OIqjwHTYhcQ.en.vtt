00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
want to turn and then fold it down again

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.990 
want to turn and then fold it down again
and<00:00:30.380> open<00:00:31.380> my<00:00:31.650> back<00:00:31.890> up<00:00:32.099> turn<00:00:32.520> it<00:00:32.579> over<00:00:32.759> again

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
do the diagonal which you all should

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.670 
do the diagonal which you all should
already<00:00:35.579> have<00:00:35.700> and<00:00:36.410> then<00:00:37.410> you're<00:00:37.530> going<00:00:37.620> to

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
already have and then you're going to

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.319 
already have and then you're going to
get<00:00:37.770> like<00:00:37.980> then<00:00:38.820> which<00:00:39.000> I'm<00:00:39.059> going<00:00:39.149> to<00:00:39.210> just

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
get like then which I'm going to just

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.160 
get like then which I'm going to just
pinch<00:00:39.629> the<00:00:39.719> side<00:00:40.790> then<00:00:41.790> and<00:00:42.059> I<00:00:42.390> push<00:00:42.989> it

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
pinch the side then and I push it

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.639 
pinch the side then and I push it
together<00:00:43.320> so<00:00:43.829> it<00:00:43.890> will<00:00:44.010> bit<00:00:44.100> like<00:00:44.899> that<00:00:45.899> and

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
together so it will bit like that and

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:56.280 
together so it will bit like that and
then<00:00:46.950> you<00:00:47.010> want<00:00:47.160> to<00:00:47.219> form<00:00:47.730> it<00:00:48.590> into<00:00:49.590> a<00:00:49.860> trying

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:56.290 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:00.150 

then<00:00:57.070> you<00:00:57.970> want<00:00:58.150> to<00:00:58.210> take<00:00:58.560> these<00:00:59.560> flaps<00:00:59.950> right

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:00.160 
then you want to take these flaps right

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:08.880 
then you want to take these flaps right
here<00:01:01.980> fold<00:01:02.980> it<00:01:04.050> up<00:01:05.050> and<00:01:07.500> chain<00:01:08.500> with<00:01:08.650> the<00:01:08.680> other

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:08.890 
here fold it up and chain with the other

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:14.580 
here fold it up and chain with the other
side<00:01:12.480> and<00:01:13.480> then<00:01:13.750> you<00:01:13.840> do<00:01:13.960> the<00:01:14.050> same<00:01:14.230> thing<00:01:14.440> for

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:14.590 
side and then you do the same thing for

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:23.460 
side and then you do the same thing for
the<00:01:14.650> back<00:01:15.330> hold<00:01:16.330> it<00:01:16.510> up<00:01:17.580> but<00:01:19.470> in<00:01:21.090> and<00:01:22.090> then<00:01:22.900> you

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:23.470 
the back hold it up but in and then you

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:28.200 
the back hold it up but in and then you
want<00:01:23.650> to<00:01:23.680> take<00:01:24.570> this<00:01:25.570> slop<00:01:25.930> on<00:01:26.110> the<00:01:26.200> side<00:01:27.210> pull

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.210 
want to take this slop on the side pull

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.920 
want to take this slop on the side pull
it<00:01:28.300> down<00:01:28.830> then<00:01:29.830> same<00:01:30.190> with<00:01:30.220> the<00:01:30.430> other<00:01:30.460> side

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
it down then same with the other side

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:38.990 
it down then same with the other side
then<00:01:31.930> you<00:01:32.080> flip<00:01:32.440> it<00:01:32.590> over<00:01:32.740> and<00:01:32.950> do<00:01:33.130> it<00:01:33.160> again

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.130 

and<00:01:40.000> then<00:01:40.270> what<00:01:40.600> you're<00:01:40.690> going<00:01:40.810> to<00:01:40.900> do<00:01:40.990> is

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:41.140 
and then what you're going to do is

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.580 
and then what you're going to do is
going<00:01:41.170> to<00:01:41.320> have<00:01:41.500> this<00:01:41.710> on<00:01:42.009> both<00:01:42.160> sides<00:01:42.550> and

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
going to have this on both sides and

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.240 
going to have this on both sides and
then<00:01:44.590> you<00:01:44.740> want<00:01:44.860> to<00:01:44.950> take<00:01:45.130> these<00:01:45.340> flasher<00:01:45.820> here

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
then you want to take these flasher here

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.900 
then you want to take these flasher here
open<00:01:48.250> this<00:01:48.369> up<00:01:48.580> and<00:01:48.930> tuck<00:01:49.930> the<00:01:50.110> pocket<00:01:50.530> there

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:50.910 
open this up and tuck the pocket there

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:56.540 
open this up and tuck the pocket there
there<00:01:51.910> tuck<00:01:52.119> it<00:01:52.300> in<00:01:52.390> the<00:01:52.479> pocket

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:56.550 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:59.010 

and<00:01:57.550> then<00:01:57.790> when<00:01:57.970> you<00:01:58.030> do<00:01:58.120> it<00:01:58.240> all<00:01:58.390> four<00:01:58.810> of<00:01:58.840> them

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
and then when you do it all four of them

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:07.570 
and then when you do it all four of them
front<00:01:59.500> and<00:01:59.620> back

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.430 

the<00:02:08.150> only<00:02:08.330> reason<00:02:08.450> I'm<00:02:08.570> trying<00:02:08.780> to<00:02:08.930> do<00:02:09.050> this<00:02:09.259> is

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
the only reason I'm trying to do this is

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.020 
the only reason I'm trying to do this is
because<00:02:09.590> it'll<00:02:10.040> give<00:02:10.220> it<00:02:10.250> more<00:02:10.400> support<00:02:10.910> when

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
because it'll give it more support when

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.390 
because it'll give it more support when
you<00:02:11.060> blow<00:02:11.540> it<00:02:11.690> up<00:02:11.810> or<00:02:12.500> not<00:02:12.680> blow<00:02:12.890> it<00:02:12.920> up<00:02:13.070> but<00:02:13.250> you

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
you blow it up or not blow it up but you

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.150 
you blow it up or not blow it up but you
know<00:02:13.840> so<00:02:14.840> you<00:02:15.020> can<00:02:15.200> blow<00:02:15.320> it<00:02:15.380> up<00:02:15.560> if<00:02:16.070> you<00:02:16.130> want

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
know so you can blow it up if you want

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:25.230 
know so you can blow it up if you want
to

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:25.240 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:38.340 

I<00:02:26.550> keep<00:02:27.550> it

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.350 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:42.220 

now<00:02:39.350> what<00:02:39.530> you<00:02:39.650> do<00:02:39.770> is<00:02:39.800> you<00:02:40.250> want<00:02:41.240> to<00:02:41.300> like<00:02:41.480> fold

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
now what you do is you want to like fold

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:43.960 
now what you do is you want to like fold
it<00:02:42.350> like<00:02:42.470> that<00:02:42.710> and<00:02:43.190> you<00:02:43.250> seal<00:02:43.460> the<00:02:43.490> hole<00:02:43.790> right

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
it like that and you seal the hole right

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.510 
it like that and you seal the hole right
there<00:02:44.030> I<00:02:44.620> should<00:02:45.620> be<00:02:46.070> but<00:02:46.310> there's<00:02:46.460> a

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:46.520 
there I should be but there's a

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.250 
there I should be but there's a
little<00:02:46.640> hole<00:02:46.730> right<00:02:46.850> there<00:02:47.030> will<00:02:47.750> blow<00:02:48.050> into

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
little hole right there will blow into

00:02:48.260 --> 00:03:01.520 
little hole right there will blow into
it

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:10.820 

okay<00:03:04.680> I'm<00:03:05.680> gonna<00:03:05.830> have<00:03:05.950> to<00:03:06.069> go<00:03:06.220> a<00:03:06.250> lot<00:03:06.459> into<00:03:06.670> it

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:20.380 

and<00:03:11.830> let<00:03:11.890> me<00:03:12.310> just<00:03:12.340> fix<00:03:12.610> my<00:03:12.819> support

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:20.390 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:23.090 

so<00:03:21.390> you<00:03:21.450> kind<00:03:21.780> of<00:03:21.810> want<00:03:21.990> to<00:03:22.020> square<00:03:22.320> it<00:03:22.440> out<00:03:22.560> two

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
so you kind of want to square it out two

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:28.630 
so you kind of want to square it out two
away
