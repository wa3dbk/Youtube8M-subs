00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
of the matchups that they actually had

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.300 
of the matchups that they actually had
this<00:01:30.509> weekend<00:01:31.020> I<00:01:31.080> mean<00:01:31.200> SOS<00:01:31.710> certainly<00:01:32.100> went

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
this weekend I mean SOS certainly went

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.029 
this weekend I mean SOS certainly went
with<00:01:32.459> that<00:01:32.610> tech-heavy<00:01:33.509> gateway<00:01:34.259> less<00:01:34.590> style

00:01:35.029 --> 00:01:35.039 
with that tech-heavy gateway less style

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:37.249 
with that tech-heavy gateway less style
but<00:01:35.640> parting<00:01:36.090> you're<00:01:36.209> right<00:01:36.450> if<00:01:36.810> he's<00:01:36.990> always

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
but parting you're right if he's always

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.820 
but parting you're right if he's always
like<00:01:37.649> that<00:01:37.679> type<00:01:38.220> of<00:01:38.250> play<00:01:38.729> he's<00:01:39.299> always<00:01:39.479> been

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:39.830 
like that type of play he's always been

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:41.899 
like that type of play he's always been
phenomenal<00:01:40.830> with<00:01:40.860> this<00:01:41.159> control<00:01:41.670> on<00:01:41.759> that

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
phenomenal with this control on that

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.880 
phenomenal with this control on that
type<00:01:42.149> of<00:01:42.179> play<00:01:42.509> and<00:01:42.750> you<00:01:43.319> know<00:01:43.440> with<00:01:43.860> the

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
type of play and you know with the

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.919 
type of play and you know with the
mobilities<00:01:44.670> that<00:01:45.000> you<00:01:45.090> obviously<00:01:45.270> get<00:01:45.690> from

00:01:45.919 --> 00:01:45.929 
mobilities that you obviously get from

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:47.449 
mobilities that you obviously get from
there<00:01:46.140> I<00:01:46.289> think<00:01:46.500> that<00:01:46.740> opens<00:01:47.220> up<00:01:47.340> the

00:01:47.449 --> 00:01:47.459 
there I think that opens up the

00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:49.760 
there I think that opens up the
creativity<00:01:48.000> some<00:01:48.659> of<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:48.840> plays<00:01:49.319> that<00:01:49.740> you

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
creativity some of the plays that you

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.039 
creativity some of the plays that you
can<00:01:50.039> make<00:01:50.220> if<00:01:50.429> you<00:01:50.549> will<00:01:50.729> whether<00:01:51.569> that<00:01:51.810> be

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
can make if you will whether that be

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.770 
can make if you will whether that be
vision<00:01:52.560> with<00:01:52.770> a<00:01:53.369> Stargate<00:01:53.819> unit<00:01:54.299> or<00:01:54.569> your

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
vision with a Stargate unit or your

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.480 
vision with a Stargate unit or your
mothership<00:01:55.200> core<00:01:55.470> or<00:01:55.830> something<00:01:55.950> else<00:01:56.399> like

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
mothership core or something else like

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.029 
mothership core or something else like
that<00:01:56.610> you<00:01:57.209> know<00:01:57.299> to<00:01:57.360> try<00:01:57.840> to<00:01:57.899> get<00:01:58.200> yourself<00:01:58.319> an

00:01:59.029 --> 00:01:59.039 
that you know to try to get yourself an

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:01.520 
that you know to try to get yourself an
advantage<00:01:59.629> you<00:02:00.629> know<00:02:00.720> whether<00:02:01.019> or<00:02:01.170> not<00:02:01.259> that

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
advantage you know whether or not that

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.050 
advantage you know whether or not that
will<00:02:01.649> actually<00:02:02.129> come<00:02:02.369> into<00:02:02.519> play

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
will actually come into play

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.469 
will actually come into play
I<00:02:03.090> feel<00:02:03.810> like<00:02:04.310> SOS<00:02:05.310> can't<00:02:05.640> necessarily<00:02:05.819> play

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
I feel like SOS can't necessarily play

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.619 
I feel like SOS can't necessarily play

the stylee plays in other in another
matchup<00:02:09.869> just<00:02:10.259> simply<00:02:10.649> due<00:02:10.920> to<00:02:10.950> the<00:02:11.790> way<00:02:11.970> that

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
matchup just simply due to the way that

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.570

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
instability early on the games get so

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.170 
instability early on the games get so
interesting<00:02:22.260> and<00:02:22.379> calmed<00:02:22.800> down<00:02:22.830> a<00:02:22.980> ton<00:02:23.519> once

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
interesting and calmed down a ton once

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:25.640

you<00:02:24.360> get<00:02:24.569> into<00:02:24.810> the<00:02:24.930> mid<00:02:25.170> game<00:02:25.379> it

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
you get into the mid game it

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.550 
you get into the mid game it
interestingly<00:02:25.890> becomes<00:02:26.580> all<00:02:26.879> about<00:02:27.260> the<00:02:28.260> warp

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560

at<00:02:32.819> all<00:02:32.970> I<00:02:33.180> mean<00:02:33.569> it<00:02:34.050> used<00:02:34.319> to<00:02:34.500> be<00:02:34.620> the<00:02:34.739> most

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
at all I mean it used to be the most

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.610 
at all I mean it used to be the most
stagnant<00:02:35.730> static<00:02:36.540> matchup<00:02:37.019> in<00:02:37.140> the<00:02:37.230> mid<00:02:37.379> game

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
and now it's incredibly fast paced it's

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.509 
and now it's incredibly fast paced it's
a<00:02:39.959> lot<00:02:40.110> more<00:02:40.290> about<00:02:40.470> attacking<00:02:40.920> and<00:02:41.220> multiple

difference is gonna be I believe there's

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.720 
difference is gonna be I believe there's
one<00:03:00.490> additional<00:03:00.760> gate<00:03:01.209> way<00:03:01.390> down<00:03:02.220> yeah<00:03:03.220> yeah<00:03:03.700> I

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
one additional gate way down yeah yeah I

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.580 
one additional gate way down yeah yeah I
mean<00:03:03.790> the<00:03:03.970> additional<00:03:04.330> gateway<00:03:04.660> from<00:03:04.720> Part<00:03:05.500> II

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
mean the additional gateway from Part II

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.920 
mean the additional gateway from Part II
is<00:03:05.740> not<00:03:05.950> gonna<00:03:06.130> be<00:03:06.310> too<00:03:06.340> telling<00:03:07.000> what<00:03:07.660> I<00:03:07.690> would

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
is not gonna be too telling what I would

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:09.720

the current winner right now so Stargate

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:59.100 
the current winner right now so Stargate
has<00:03:56.200> gone<00:03:56.860> down<00:03:57.130> once<00:03:57.459> again<00:03:57.610> for<00:03:58.600> parting<00:03:58.959> Oh

00:03:59.100 --> 00:03:59.110 
has gone down once again for parting Oh

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:01.170 
has gone down once again for parting Oh
later<00:03:59.470> than<00:03:59.680> the<00:03:59.769> last<00:03:59.950> time<00:04:00.100> and<00:04:00.310> there<00:04:00.519> oh<00:04:00.910> my

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:01.180 
later than the last time and there oh my

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:03.390 
later than the last time and there oh my
god<00:04:01.450> it's<00:04:01.630> a<00:04:01.750> dark<00:04:02.080> shrine<00:04:02.350> ignore<00:04:03.010> everything

god it's a dark shrine ignore everything
I'm<00:04:03.670> saying<00:04:03.940> okay<00:04:04.180> he<00:04:04.299> gets<00:04:04.480> a<00:04:04.570> century

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:05.080 
I'm saying okay he gets a century

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.440 
I'm saying okay he gets a century
because<00:04:06.070> he<00:04:06.220> wants<00:04:06.459> to<00:04:06.519> get<00:04:06.730> a<00:04:06.790> dark<00:04:07.090> shrine

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:07.450 
because he wants to get a dark shrine

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:09.930 
because he wants to get a dark shrine
that's<00:04:07.660> my<00:04:07.900> analysis<00:04:08.560> Marcus<00:04:08.980> that<00:04:09.310> was<00:04:09.489> very

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:09.940 
that's my analysis Marcus that was very

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:15.110 
that's my analysis Marcus that was very
very<00:04:10.209> well<00:04:10.510> done<00:04:10.810> Sean<00:04:11.140> I<00:04:11.560> have<00:04:11.829> a<00:04:12.010> show

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.180 

and<00:04:16.120> this<00:04:16.930> century<00:04:17.230> will<00:04:17.410> become<00:04:17.680> very

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.190 
and this century will become very

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:21.120 
and this century will become very
important<00:04:18.640> right<00:04:18.790> here<00:04:19.380> if<00:04:20.380> it<00:04:20.650> needs<00:04:20.859> to

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.130 
important right here if it needs to

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:24.900 
important right here if it needs to
block<00:04:21.430> it<00:04:21.640> off<00:04:21.790> is<00:04:22.000> it<00:04:22.180> right<00:04:22.390> foot<00:04:22.570> Oh<00:04:23.910> second

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:16.630 
did and there's blink for SOS so he's

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:19.380 
did and there's blink for SOS so he's
going<00:06:16.840> to<00:06:16.960> be<00:06:17.140> transitioning<00:06:17.860> out<00:06:18.220> of<00:06:18.250> his<00:06:18.910> DTS

going to be transitioning out of his DTS

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:22.290 
going to be transitioning out of his DTS
into<00:06:19.960> that<00:06:20.110> now<00:06:20.290> I<00:06:20.320> mean<00:06:20.650> the<00:06:21.400> damage<00:06:21.640> was

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:22.300 
into that now I mean the damage was

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:24.600 
into that now I mean the damage was
minor<00:06:22.930> but<00:06:23.530> maybe<00:06:23.710> the<00:06:23.980> fact<00:06:24.160> that<00:06:24.400> he

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:24.610 
minor but maybe the fact that he

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:26.460 
minor but maybe the fact that he
prevented<00:06:25.210> the<00:06:25.300> Oracle<00:06:25.750> from<00:06:25.960> doing<00:06:26.140> anything

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:26.470 
prevented the Oracle from doing anything

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:29.280 
prevented the Oracle from doing anything
but<00:06:26.980> just<00:06:27.190> revealing<00:06:27.640> the<00:06:27.850> DTS<00:06:28.330> it's<00:06:28.960> probably

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:29.290 
but just revealing the DTS it's probably

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:31.710 
but just revealing the DTS it's probably
really<00:06:29.530> gonna<00:06:29.650> play<00:06:29.830> into<00:06:30.520> SLS's<00:06:31.000> favor<00:06:31.420> oh

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:31.720 
really gonna play into SLS's favor oh

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:34.230 
really gonna play into SLS's favor oh

here comes the Oracle RightNow and he'll

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:35.970 
here comes the Oracle RightNow and he'll

pass over the natural nothing really to

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:38.070 
pass over the natural nothing really to
