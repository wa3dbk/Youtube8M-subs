00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.289
 it changes the quality yeah and the 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.650
 diameter of the lens so the green 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:07.350

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:22.700

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:33.720
 I do not have if we see five if we go 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:36.060
 hold between 3.2 and the device preceded 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.619
 red what new train you 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.780
 will show in a black bat thing 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.490
 excuse me from a black space something 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.610
 black 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.659
 and then we'll show what they 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.990
 had in the box that we receive the 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:50.200
 matata bezel time ok it is nice 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:02:02.600
 oscillating viewfinder power that aims to 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:02:04.130
 set on the side then park watts and 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.689
 the toilets mounted a trip is very 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.830
 boring it goes up that I can tell you 

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:08.000
 that's why I did not go back 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.860
 in front of your eyes because it's annoying 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.519
 because the police and the slope is needed 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:18.799
 hold another one here is the box of the 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:21.830
 box keep the capa capa anonymity which 

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:25.100
 is really bad and illustrated it does not matter 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:28.370
 not for the right climb or the 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:31.489
 show radio he happily enjoys that 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.720
 will read all this especially as closed on 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:35.209
 video on the internet is good you 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:38.720
 know that you have everything so yeah with 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:41.660
 that there was a little rhythm that's for 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.450
 protect her a spare battery because 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:46.250
 I think it costs 5 euros 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:48.519
 it's the peaks of a necklace 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:52.250
 more world these charters and the full 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:55.010
 autonomy more comfortable so I'm going 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:57.799
 spend what Yeah but hey it 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:00.709
 will bring them nothing and with the dany sun 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:01.970
 I bought three thousand lives of 0 28 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:05.049
 grams of green color 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:07.160
 in addition it ensures the on the cenaci that 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:15.200
 lebanon was just out of the body 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:17.000
 tiff rent green color 0 28 g yeah 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.040
 so I think it'll be better 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.109
 not try what this new what 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.620
 I had 0.25 in the earth chips 

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:27.620
 to get out of the barrel is a little silly 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:30.940
 and that I'm trying to 0.28 and at worst to 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:34.220
 that of the cartridges that that since 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:37.040
 is right now for you 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:38.840
 show lines to hits and puts back 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:43.780
 so we'll show you we're in 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:47.920
 black is not Roma and the tennis player 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:55.760
 so I had first glass 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:58.220
 pascal - better how to use these people 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.750
 here you see good it does not do too much 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:02.420
 because in truth it is much more 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:05.770
 powerful but to pau precisely created in 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:05.770
 road then it will be over I think 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:16.349
 m
