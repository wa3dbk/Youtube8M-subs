00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
their recommendation and said that we

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:39.680 
their recommendation and said that we
need<00:02:37.170> to<00:02:37.350> have<00:02:37.530> a<00:02:37.739> maximum<00:02:38.700> amount<00:02:38.820> of<00:02:39.269> sugar

having to know about dieting but if we

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.150 
having to know about dieting but if we
look<00:03:03.360> at<00:03:03.600> kids<00:03:03.870> one<00:03:04.140> of<00:03:04.170> the<00:03:04.320> biggest<00:03:04.620> reasons

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
look at kids one of the biggest reasons

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.920 
look at kids one of the biggest reasons
that<00:03:05.370> they<00:03:05.519> have<00:03:05.820> obese<00:03:06.269> seeing<00:03:06.570> that<00:03:06.750> they

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
may died in the future is because

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:10.910 
may died in the future is because
they're<00:03:09.329> consuming<00:03:09.780> too<00:03:09.959> much<00:03:10.079> sugar<00:03:10.140> now<00:03:10.890> a
