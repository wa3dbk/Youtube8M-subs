00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:04.410

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:05.570
 for you 

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:10.259

 released in the UK but has audio that captures in Portuguese 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:15.799
 Brazilian 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:18.070
 both in the film as a plus 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:21.070
 of these the general joy and collectors 

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:24.070
 especially the students the fans 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.489
 we hope for the four films aline 

00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:30.349
 the definition 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:32.690
 and a dream come true 

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:35.890
 in the last semester of 2010 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.890
 edition of the punished kingdom 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.080
 borges is very clever 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:46.030
 usually the disks in the uk editions of uk non-company 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:48.240
 much for the quality of the egg 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:49.730
 of packaging 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:51.120
 but it is not the case stated 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.730
 here to forts 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.170
 I make a right homework assignment. 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.160
 I am not measuring this man from cavez to patients closely 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.290
 Why are you seeing detail? 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.930
 of the box and see that in the racket 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.930
 has a metalized effect 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.510
 It's very beautiful 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:13.680
 everything you will not find 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.530
 in the national edition 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:17.070
 national only 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.620
 released without the slightest clue all this you also do not have any of this not 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:23.160
 are the only thing 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.190
 and what is the inflation the sebrae 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.610
 because of this the disks 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:30.840
 roger presentation 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.720

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.110
 difference only in the packaging we present 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.480

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:50.900
 main world event 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.230

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:56.570
 the beyond called the series principal 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:57.720
 the plug 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.720
 of the first two films 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:02.770
 even knowing 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:04.550
 one more time we have here 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:05.810

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.810
 April 23 

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:14.449
 and as we do not have one more time there we find here a leaflet 

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:16.989
 shortly thereafter for the three 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:19.989

 to clean 

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:50.949
 and then you will count even more 

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:52.589
 two discs 

00:02:52.589 --> 00:02:57.059

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:17.929
 we stayed a little bit of the game 

00:03:17.929 --> 00:03:20.099
 frenzy that was created 

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:23.099
 the character 

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:26.699
 critics have already seen 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:34.989

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:21.669
 the third 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.240

 it was not me I speak 

00:05:14.879 --> 00:05:19.449
 I am persistent but the reaction of the disks in this mutual way 

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:22.449
 it's as if the station arranged 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:25.289
 and the leaflet 

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:30.219
