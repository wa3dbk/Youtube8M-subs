00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
in november of 2012 so we could see one

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.330 
in november of 2012 so we could see one
in<00:01:08.250> november<00:01:08.670> 2013<00:01:09.479> but<00:01:10.290> with<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.680> Moto<00:01:11.040> X

a<00:01:13.140> little<00:01:13.380> bit<00:01:13.560> longer<00:01:13.770> maybe<00:01:13.979> even<00:01:14.430> into<00:01:14.670> 2014

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420

as to what specs it could have we have

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.899 
as to what specs it could have we have
no<00:01:19.020> idea<00:01:19.500> because<00:01:19.860> we<00:01:19.979> know<00:01:20.159> so<00:01:20.430> little<00:01:20.460> about

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
no idea because we know so little about

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.060 
no idea because we know so little about
the<00:01:21.180> next<00:01:21.450> Nexus<00:01:21.869> phones<00:01:22.140> right<00:01:22.470> now<00:01:22.710> it<00:01:22.890> could
