00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
why this is important doctrine to

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.690 
why this is important doctrine to
understand<00:01:07.590> is<00:01:08.070> because<00:01:08.250> as<00:01:08.729> we<00:01:09.360> are<00:01:10.700> learning

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
understand is because as we are learning

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.359 
understand is because as we are learning
who<00:01:11.970> we<00:01:12.119> are<00:01:12.299> we<00:01:12.960> know<00:01:13.200> that<00:01:13.229> we<00:01:13.650> have<00:01:13.920> a<00:01:13.950> body

who we are we know that we have a body

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.880

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
because we physically can see it our

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:25.280 
because we physically can see it our
soul<00:01:17.490> is<00:01:18.200> our<00:01:19.670> mind<00:01:20.990> our<00:01:22.460> will<00:01:23.460> and<00:01:24.290> our

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
soul is our mind our will and our

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:32.960 
soul is our mind our will and our
emotions<00:01:26.840> and<00:01:28.549> our<00:01:29.549> spirit<00:01:30.329> is<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:31.500> real<00:01:31.970> you

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
emotions and our spirit is the real you

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.410 
emotions and our spirit is the real you
the<00:01:33.420> real<00:01:33.630> person<00:01:34.320> inside<00:01:34.979> of<00:01:35.189> us<00:01:35.340> so<00:01:36.210> we<00:01:36.390> are

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
the real person inside of us so we are

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:43.130 
the real person inside of us so we are
spirit<00:01:37.170> beings<00:01:38.990> house<00:01:39.990> in<00:01:40.470> a<00:01:40.530> body<00:01:41.060> and<00:01:42.140> so

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
spirit beings house in a body and so

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.410 
spirit beings house in a body and so
what<00:01:43.320> happens<00:01:43.770> when<00:01:43.979> we<00:01:44.369> accepted<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.030> Christ

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
what happens when we accepted the Christ

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:51.170 
what happens when we accepted the Christ
our<00:01:45.780> spirit<00:01:46.610> was<00:01:49.189> separated<00:01:50.189> from<00:01:50.220> God<00:01:50.610> or<00:01:50.939> in

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
our spirit was separated from God or in

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.710 
our spirit was separated from God or in
sin<00:01:51.689> in<00:01:52.140> separation<00:01:52.860> from<00:01:53.189> God<00:01:53.460> but<00:01:54.030> then<00:01:54.360> God

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
sin in separation from God but then God

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.770 
sin in separation from God but then God
gave<00:01:54.960> us<00:01:55.140> a<00:01:55.290> new<00:01:55.530> spirit<00:01:56.070> 100%<00:01:57.000> righteous<00:01:57.540> and

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780

so<00:02:10.349> in<00:02:10.470> Romans<00:02:10.920> 7

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
so in Romans 7

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:20.780 
so in Romans 7
verse<00:02:14.370> 16<00:02:15.680> and<00:02:16.680> 17<00:02:17.340> Paul<00:02:18.090> says<00:02:18.890> if<00:02:19.890> then<00:02:20.430> I<00:02:20.730> do

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
verse 16 and 17 Paul says if then I do

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.570 
verse 16 and 17 Paul says if then I do
what<00:02:21.450> I<00:02:21.630> will<00:02:21.900> not<00:02:22.140> to<00:02:22.200> do<00:02:22.590> I<00:02:22.890> agree<00:02:23.040> with<00:02:23.430> the

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
what I will not to do I agree with the

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.940 
what I will not to do I agree with the
law<00:02:23.730> that<00:02:24.000> it's<00:02:24.180> good<00:02:24.480> but<00:02:25.140> now<00:02:25.320> it<00:02:25.560> is<00:02:25.710> no

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
law that it's good but now it is no

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.910 
law that it's good but now it is no
longer<00:02:25.980> I<00:02:26.490> who<00:02:26.610> do<00:02:27.180> it<00:02:27.210> but<00:02:27.360> sin<00:02:27.900> that<00:02:27.960> indwells

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
longer I who do it but sin that indwells

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.000 
longer I who do it but sin that indwells
me<00:02:29.400> and<00:02:30.330> so<00:02:30.540> what<00:02:30.720> happens<00:02:31.170> is<00:02:31.350> there's<00:02:31.590> still

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
me and so what happens is there's still

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.360 
me and so what happens is there's still
an<00:02:32.160> independence<00:02:33.230> around<00:02:34.230> our<00:02:34.530> spirit<00:02:35.130> and

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
an independence around our spirit and

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.830 
an independence around our spirit and
that's<00:02:35.820> in<00:02:36.440> inside<00:02:37.440> of<00:02:37.800> our<00:02:38.100> body<00:02:38.460> and<00:02:38.850> inside

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
that's in inside of our body and inside

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.290 
that's in inside of our body and inside
of<00:02:40.200> our<00:02:40.530> soul<00:02:40.860> and<00:02:41.780> so<00:02:42.780> this<00:02:43.200> is<00:02:43.470> when<00:02:43.770> you

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:44.300 
of our soul and so this is when you

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.450 
of our soul and so this is when you
became<00:02:45.300> a<00:02:45.360> new<00:02:45.690> creature<00:02:45.990> in<00:02:46.140> Christ<00:02:46.290> a<00:02:46.980> new

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:47.460

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
continue to be able to be used by the

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.150 
continue to be able to be used by the
evil<00:02:57.390> one<00:02:57.420> and<00:02:57.810> so<00:02:58.290> that's<00:02:58.470> what<00:02:58.650> it<00:02:58.740> means<00:02:58.890> by

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
evil one and so that's what it means by

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.040 
evil one and so that's what it means by
sin<00:02:59.550> that<00:02:59.760> sin<00:03:00.060> and<00:03:00.270> dwells<00:03:00.510> it's<00:03:00.810> still

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
sin that sin and dwells it's still

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:04.640 
sin that sin and dwells it's still
separated<00:03:01.680> and<00:03:02.190> so<00:03:02.490> what<00:03:02.670> happens<00:03:03.120> is<00:03:03.390> that<00:03:03.900> as

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
separated and so what happens is that as

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.790 
separated and so what happens is that as
you<00:03:04.980> begin<00:03:05.310> to<00:03:05.520> live<00:03:05.880> out<00:03:06.209> your<00:03:06.600> life<00:03:07.080> it

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:12.240 
starts to take over the soul the body

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:17.900 
starts to take over the soul the body
and<00:03:12.690> soul<00:03:13.380> and<00:03:13.700> as<00:03:14.810> it<00:03:15.810> takes<00:03:16.080> over<00:03:16.610> you<00:03:17.610> get<00:03:17.760> to
