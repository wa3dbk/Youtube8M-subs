Williamson<00:00:20.640> he's<00:00:21.029> very<00:00:21.210> good<00:00:21.450> very<00:00:21.810> efficient

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.040 
Williamson he's very good very efficient
and<00:00:22.710> I<00:00:23.130> think<00:00:23.400> he<00:00:23.550> might<00:00:23.850> become<00:00:24.180> New

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
and I think he might become New

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.490 
and I think he might become New
Zealand's<00:00:25.590> best<00:00:26.009> batsmen<00:00:26.450> ever<00:00:27.450> and<00:00:28.320> the

Zealand's best batsmen ever and the
streamlined<00:00:29.430> perfect<00:00:30.029> battle<00:00:30.300> out<00:00:30.480> there<00:00:30.660> was

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
streamlined perfect battle out there was

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:31.730 
streamlined perfect battle out there was
a<00:00:30.779> point<00:00:31.050> there<00:00:31.230> what<00:00:31.349> we're<00:00:31.470> looking

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
a point there what we're looking

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.100 
a point there what we're looking
thinking<00:00:32.099> here<00:00:32.510> how<00:00:33.510> is<00:00:33.660> this<00:00:33.750> something

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
thinking here how is this something

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.150 
thinking here how is this something
wrong<00:00:34.260> with<00:00:34.410> him<00:00:34.530> but<00:00:34.560> no<00:00:34.710> no<00:00:34.829> that's

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
wrong with him but no no that's

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.670 
wrong with him but no no that's
absolutely<00:00:35.490> right<00:00:35.670> and<00:00:35.910> he's<00:00:36.180> 24<00:00:36.780> and<00:00:37.380> we<00:00:37.560> were

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
absolutely right and he's 24 and we were

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.140 
absolutely right and he's 24 and we were
talking<00:00:37.860> earlier<00:00:38.100> weren't<00:00:38.460> we<00:00:38.550> who<00:00:38.940> would<00:00:39.060> you

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:39.150 
talking earlier weren't we who would you

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:40.790

rather<00:00:39.180> have<00:00:39.420> in<00:00:39.570> his<00:00:39.690> side<00:00:39.900> route<00:00:40.320> or

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
rather have in his side route or

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.650 
rather have in his side route or
Williamson<00:00:41.370> and<00:00:41.640> I<00:00:41.790> think<00:00:41.940> we<00:00:42.030> both<00:00:42.180> decided

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
Williamson and I think we both decided

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.350 
Williamson and I think we both decided
just<00:00:43.230> by<00:00:43.680> a<00:00:43.710> whisker<00:00:43.980> it'd<00:00:44.280> be<00:00:44.400> Williamson<00:00:44.970> and

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
just by a whisker it'd be Williamson and

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.400 
just by a whisker it'd be Williamson and
that's<00:00:45.540> very<00:00:45.780> very<00:00:45.930> high<00:00:46.110> price<00:00:46.320> because

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
that's very very high price because

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.770 
that's very very high price because

smashing a declining fifth break soon be

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.919 
smashing a declining fifth break soon be
fence<00:01:23.549> could<00:01:23.789> I'd<00:01:23.969> bet<00:01:24.569> that's<00:01:24.749> about

00:01:24.919 --> 00:01:24.929 
fence could I'd bet that's about

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:26.959 
fence could I'd bet that's about
anything<00:01:25.140> around<00:01:25.409> seven<00:01:26.009> points<00:01:26.429> between<00:01:26.640> all

00:01:26.959 --> 00:01:26.969 
anything around seven points between all

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:28.849 
anything around seven points between all
the<00:01:27.090> people<00:01:27.210> that<00:01:27.600> understand<00:01:28.289> South<00:01:28.560> Africa

00:01:28.849 --> 00:01:28.859 
the people that understand South Africa

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:30.380 
the people that understand South Africa
at<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:28.979> moment<00:01:29.310> so<00:01:29.460> I<00:01:29.670> think<00:01:29.880> that's<00:01:30.060> a<00:01:30.179> little

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
at the moment so I think that's a little

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:31.550 
at the moment so I think that's a little
bit<00:01:30.659> unfair<00:01:30.810> but<00:01:31.140> yes

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
bit unfair but yes

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.929 
bit unfair but yes
New<00:01:31.859> Zealand<00:01:32.100> looked<00:01:32.219> like<00:01:32.340> a<00:01:32.369> better<00:01:32.640> thing

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
New Zealand looked like a better thing

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.160 
New Zealand looked like a better thing
so<00:01:33.119> we<00:01:33.210> shouldn't<00:01:33.420> be<00:01:33.479> that<00:01:33.659> surprised<00:01:34.049> oh

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
so we shouldn't be that surprised oh

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.050 
so we shouldn't be that surprised oh
it's<00:01:34.380> really<00:01:34.859> early<00:01:35.009> days<00:01:35.369> with<00:01:35.609> two<00:01:35.819> days

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
it's really early days with two days

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.300 
it's really early days with two days
everyone<00:01:36.719> the<00:01:36.899> theories<00:01:37.259> they<00:01:37.679> have<00:01:37.859> one<00:01:38.130> that

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
everyone the theories they have one that

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.370 
everyone the theories they have one that
just<00:01:38.579> aren't<00:01:39.270> to<00:01:39.450> climbing<00:01:39.899> I<00:01:39.990> don't<00:01:40.170> think

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
just aren't to climbing I don't think

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.139 
just aren't to climbing I don't think
this<00:01:40.590> is<00:01:40.619> how<00:01:41.280> do<00:01:41.340> you<00:01:41.460> decide<00:01:41.759> to<00:01:41.819> really

00:01:42.139 --> 00:01:42.149 
this is how do you decide to really

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:43.609 
this is how do you decide to really
younger<00:01:42.509> at<00:01:42.569> the<00:01:42.600> start<00:01:42.869> the<00:01:42.960> Kris<00:01:43.139> seven<00:01:43.530> I

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
younger at the start the Kris seven I

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.879 
younger at the start the Kris seven I
reckon<00:01:44.869> they're<00:01:45.869> just<00:01:46.200> at<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.469> start<00:01:46.740> of

00:01:46.879 --> 00:01:46.889 
reckon they're just at the start of

conceding billions of runs the third man

00:01:58.859 --> 00:02:00.919 
conceding billions of runs the third man
to<00:01:59.100> we<00:01:59.249> incident<00:01:59.670> with<00:02:00.119> the<00:02:00.240> third<00:02:00.569> of<00:02:00.810> his

yeah<00:02:04.679> I<00:02:04.859> think<00:02:04.979> it<00:02:05.100> was<00:02:05.189> a<00:02:05.279> series<00:02:05.670> around<00:02:05.850> some

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
yeah I think it was a series around some

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.630 
yeah I think it was a series around some
point<00:02:06.420> -<00:02:06.869> around<00:02:07.170> the<00:02:07.380> third<00:02:07.560> man<00:02:07.799> that<00:02:08.310> said

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
point - around the third man that said

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.750 
point - around the third man that said
ok<00:02:09.330> no<00:02:10.110> one<00:02:10.259> uses<00:02:10.500> a<00:02:10.679> third<00:02:10.890> man<00:02:11.130> anymore<00:02:11.550> he's

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
ok no one uses a third man anymore he's

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.100 
ok no one uses a third man anymore he's
just<00:02:11.970> better<00:02:12.150> at<00:02:12.360> hitting<00:02:12.540> there<00:02:12.840> because

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
just better at hitting there because

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.410 
just better at hitting there because
he's<00:02:13.620> a<00:02:13.650> really<00:02:14.040> good<00:02:14.190> batsman<00:02:14.580> I<00:02:14.790> think<00:02:15.300> he's

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
he's a really good batsman I think he's

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.170 
he's a really good batsman I think he's
probably<00:02:15.600> a<00:02:16.110> toxic<00:02:16.890> brand<00:02:17.250> in<00:02:17.580> the<00:02:17.670> eyes<00:02:17.790> of

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
probably a toxic brand in the eyes of

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.000 
probably a toxic brand in the eyes of
the<00:02:18.330> public<00:02:18.510> I<00:02:18.989> don't<00:02:19.230> mean<00:02:19.349> that<00:02:19.379> negatively

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
the public I don't mean that negatively

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:21.229 
the public I don't mean that negatively
about<00:02:20.069> him<00:02:20.159> but<00:02:20.340> I<00:02:20.400> think<00:02:20.610> I<00:02:20.790> said<00:02:21.150> it

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
about him but I think I said it

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:21.949 
about him but I think I said it
politically

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
politically

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:23.869 
politically
no<00:02:22.170> I<00:02:22.590> don't<00:02:22.769> think<00:02:23.010> you<00:02:23.189> can<00:02:23.340> win<00:02:23.430> people<00:02:23.640> over

00:02:23.869 --> 00:02:23.879 
no I don't think you can win people over

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:25.640 
no I don't think you can win people over
now<00:02:24.150> and<00:02:24.299> I<00:02:24.329> just<00:02:24.359> think<00:02:24.719> he's<00:02:24.870> not<00:02:25.109> he's<00:02:25.439> only

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
now and I just think he's not he's only

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.699 
now and I just think he's not he's only
a<00:02:25.799> tiny<00:02:26.129> part<00:02:26.579> of<00:02:26.760> the<00:02:26.819> problem<00:02:27.180> if<00:02:27.510> you<00:02:27.569> if<00:02:28.560> we

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
a tiny part of the problem if you if we

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:30.069 
a tiny part of the problem if you if we
what<00:02:28.829> percentage<00:02:29.280> of<00:02:29.370> the<00:02:29.489> probable<00:02:29.849> is<00:02:30.000> it

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:30.079 
what percentage of the probable is it

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:32.959 
what percentage of the probable is it
7.8<00:02:31.310> maybe<00:02:32.310> bit<00:02:32.549> off

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:32.969 
7.8 maybe bit off

00:02:32.969 --> 00:02:35.720 
7.8 maybe bit off
