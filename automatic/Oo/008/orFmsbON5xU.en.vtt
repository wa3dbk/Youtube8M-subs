00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:35.590 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:41.640 

you

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:41.650 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:44.010 

when<00:00:42.190> we<00:00:42.310> moved<00:00:42.550> here<00:00:42.610> these<00:00:43.240> trees<00:00:43.600> were<00:00:43.810> cut

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:44.020 
when we moved here these trees were cut

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:45.690 
when we moved here these trees were cut
all<00:00:44.200> the<00:00:44.320> way<00:00:44.410> down<00:00:44.560> to<00:00:44.680> the<00:00:44.800> ground<00:00:45.010> we<00:00:45.520> didn't

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:45.700 
all the way down to the ground we didn't

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:46.770 
all the way down to the ground we didn't
even<00:00:45.790> know<00:00:45.910> they<00:00:46.030> were<00:00:46.090> alive<00:00:46.240> there<00:00:46.600> weren't

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:46.780 
even know they were alive there weren't

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.620 
even know they were alive there weren't
any<00:00:46.900> trees<00:00:47.200> on<00:00:47.410> the<00:00:47.500> property<00:00:47.880> but<00:00:48.880> over<00:00:49.540> the

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:49.630 
any trees on the property but over the

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:50.850 
any trees on the property but over the
seven<00:00:49.900> years<00:00:49.930> that<00:00:50.110> we've<00:00:50.290> been<00:00:50.320> here<00:00:50.620> we<00:00:50.710> let

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:50.860 
seven years that we've been here we let

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.070 
seven years that we've been here we let
the<00:00:50.980> trees<00:00:51.220> grow<00:00:51.250> up<00:00:51.760> they<00:00:52.090> were<00:00:52.540> alive<00:00:52.809> and

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:53.080 
the trees grow up they were alive and

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.250 
the trees grow up they were alive and
they<00:00:53.940> were<00:00:54.940> beautiful<00:00:55.540> this<00:00:55.630> tree<00:00:55.840> got<00:00:55.989> to<00:00:56.140> be

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:56.260 
they were beautiful this tree got to be

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.150 
they were beautiful this tree got to be
taller<00:00:56.950> than<00:00:57.070> the<00:00:57.280> powerlines<00:00:58.090> up<00:00:58.300> here<00:00:59.160> but

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:00.160 
taller than the powerlines up here but

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.680 
taller than the powerlines up here but
then<00:01:00.280> we<00:01:00.400> planted<00:01:00.760> a<00:01:00.879> peach<00:01:01.059> tree<00:01:01.270> and<00:01:01.600> our

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:01.690 
then we planted a peach tree and our

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:04.049 
then we planted a peach tree and our
rose<00:01:01.930> bushes<00:01:02.230> and<00:01:02.610> eventually<00:01:03.610> these<00:01:03.820> trees

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:04.059 
rose bushes and eventually these trees

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:06.090 
rose bushes and eventually these trees
were<00:01:04.420> blocking<00:01:05.170> off<00:01:05.410> all<00:01:05.560> the<00:01:05.650> light<00:01:05.800> to<00:01:05.950> those

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:06.100 
were blocking off all the light to those

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.930 
were blocking off all the light to those
so<00:01:06.880> we<00:01:07.090> decided<00:01:07.390> to<00:01:07.510> cut<00:01:07.690> them<00:01:07.900> down<00:01:08.850> when<00:01:09.850> we

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:09.940 
so we decided to cut them down when we

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:11.820 
so we decided to cut them down when we
were<00:01:10.030> cutting<00:01:10.240> them<00:01:10.390> but<00:01:10.540> we<00:01:10.840> my<00:01:11.410> son<00:01:11.619> and<00:01:11.770> I

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:11.830 
were cutting them but we my son and I

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:13.950 
were cutting them but we my son and I
decided<00:01:12.190> instead<00:01:12.670> of<00:01:12.850> cutting<00:01:13.540> them<00:01:13.690> all<00:01:13.810> the

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:13.960 
decided instead of cutting them all the

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.780 
decided instead of cutting them all the
way<00:01:14.050> to<00:01:14.110> the<00:01:14.290> ground<00:01:14.440> again<00:01:14.830> we<00:01:15.460> would<00:01:15.610> leave

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:15.790 
way to the ground again we would leave

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:18.270 
way to the ground again we would leave
them<00:01:16.060> at<00:01:16.300> fence<00:01:16.810> post<00:01:17.110> height<00:01:17.350> and<00:01:17.560> then<00:01:18.190> we

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280 
them at fence post height and then we

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.480 
them at fence post height and then we
just<00:01:18.460> take<00:01:18.640> some<00:01:18.700> slats<00:01:19.300> and<00:01:20.220> build<00:01:21.220> a<00:01:21.340> fence

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:21.490 
just take some slats and build a fence

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:23.999 
just take some slats and build a fence
right<00:01:21.700> here<00:01:21.759> for<00:01:22.180> our<00:01:22.300> future<00:01:23.259> flowers<00:01:23.770> and

00:01:23.999 --> 00:01:24.009 
right here for our future flowers and

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:26.310 
right here for our future flowers and
roses<00:01:24.130> and<00:01:24.610> other<00:01:24.759> plants<00:01:25.149> to<00:01:25.270> kind<00:01:25.869> of<00:01:25.990> climb

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:26.320 
roses and other plants to kind of climb

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.400 
roses and other plants to kind of climb
over<00:01:26.759> but<00:01:27.759> then<00:01:27.940> a<00:01:28.180> couple<00:01:28.479> weeks<00:01:28.930> later<00:01:29.110> my

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:29.410 
over but then a couple weeks later my

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:31.800 
over but then a couple weeks later my
wife<00:01:29.440> had<00:01:29.770> the<00:01:29.890> brilliant<00:01:30.040> idea<00:01:30.520> of<00:01:30.810> instead

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
wife had the brilliant idea of instead

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.950 
wife had the brilliant idea of instead
of<00:01:31.990> putting<00:01:32.350> wood<00:01:33.280> slats<00:01:33.880> in<00:01:34.119> here<00:01:34.390> we<00:01:34.780> would

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:34.960 
of putting wood slats in here we would

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.430 
of putting wood slats in here we would
just<00:01:34.990> make<00:01:35.649> the<00:01:35.979> branches<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:37.479> fence<00:01:37.780> so

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:38.440 
just make the branches the fence so

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.499 
just make the branches the fence so
that's<00:01:38.590> what<00:01:38.710> we've<00:01:38.830> done<00:01:39.149> so<00:01:40.149> as<00:01:40.240> you<00:01:40.360> can<00:01:40.450> see

00:01:40.499 --> 00:01:40.509 
that's what we've done so as you can see

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:44.130 
that's what we've done so as you can see
we<00:01:41.320> had<00:01:41.500> three<00:01:42.009> main<00:01:42.330> big<00:01:43.330> trees<00:01:43.720> that<00:01:43.990> are

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140 
we had three main big trees that are

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.370 
we had three main big trees that are
post<00:01:44.800> right<00:01:45.039> now<00:01:45.190> and<00:01:45.430> we<00:01:46.300> just<00:01:46.509> took<00:01:46.660> this

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.380 
post right now and we just took this

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.940 
post right now and we just took this
Kevlar<00:01:48.130> string<00:01:48.520> here<00:01:48.789> strung<00:01:49.479> it<00:01:49.600> from<00:01:50.140> tree

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 
Kevlar string here strung it from tree

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.669 
Kevlar string here strung it from tree
to<00:01:51.009> tree<00:01:51.369> and<00:01:51.550> did<00:01:52.149> three<00:01:52.539> levels<00:01:53.200> of<00:01:53.380> it<00:01:53.500> and

00:01:53.669 --> 00:01:53.679 
to tree and did three levels of it and

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:56.669 
to tree and did three levels of it and
then<00:01:54.490> the<00:01:55.240> branches<00:01:55.690> when<00:01:55.869> they<00:01:55.990> start<00:01:56.289> like

00:01:56.669 --> 00:01:56.679 
then the branches when they start like

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:59.520 
then the branches when they start like
this<00:01:56.830> one<00:01:57.039> here<00:01:57.369> they're<00:01:58.090> nice<00:01:58.360> and<00:01:58.530> flexible

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 
this one here they're nice and flexible

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:01.919 
this one here they're nice and flexible
so<00:02:00.310> you<00:02:00.340> can<00:02:00.550> bend<00:02:00.849> them<00:02:01.000> however<00:02:01.270> you<00:02:01.539> want<00:02:01.599> to

00:02:01.919 --> 00:02:01.929 
so you can bend them however you want to

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:04.889 
so you can bend them however you want to
we<00:02:02.890> just<00:02:02.920> tie<00:02:03.310> them<00:02:03.399> to<00:02:03.550> the<00:02:03.640> strings<00:02:03.940> as<00:02:04.569> we<00:02:04.780> go

00:02:04.889 --> 00:02:04.899 
we just tie them to the strings as we go

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:08.359 
we just tie them to the strings as we go
along<00:02:05.140> and<00:02:05.819> create<00:02:06.819> our<00:02:07.030> living<00:02:07.569> fence<00:02:07.810> and

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
along and create our living fence and

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.400 
along and create our living fence and
that's<00:02:09.369> what<00:02:09.580> we've<00:02:09.700> got<00:02:09.880> here<00:02:10.090> we<00:02:11.050> still<00:02:11.230> have

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
that's what we've got here we still have

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:14.040 
that's what we've got here we still have
to<00:02:11.560> cut<00:02:12.550> away<00:02:12.640> the<00:02:13.060> branches<00:02:13.870> that<00:02:13.959> are

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
to cut away the branches that are

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:15.480 
to cut away the branches that are
growing<00:02:14.260> out<00:02:14.410> of<00:02:14.470> that<00:02:14.860> other<00:02:15.010> tree<00:02:15.280> but<00:02:15.430> you

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490 
growing out of that other tree but you

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:17.699 
growing out of that other tree but you
can<00:02:15.610> see<00:02:15.760> how<00:02:15.880> quickly<00:02:16.150> they<00:02:16.420> grow<00:02:16.569> the<00:02:17.440> trees

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
can see how quickly they grow the trees

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:20.790 
can see how quickly they grow the trees
get<00:02:17.950> huge<00:02:18.750> all<00:02:19.750> right<00:02:19.900> these<00:02:20.140> are<00:02:20.380> catalpa

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
get huge all right these are catalpa

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.070 
get huge all right these are catalpa
trees<00:02:21.099> and<00:02:21.340> they<00:02:22.300> remind<00:02:22.630> me<00:02:22.690> of<00:02:22.780> the

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
trees and they remind me of the

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.050 
trees and they remind me of the
beanstalks<00:02:23.950> in<00:02:24.190> Jack<00:02:24.550> the<00:02:24.700> giant<00:02:25.030> slayer

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
beanstalks in Jack the giant slayer

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.660 
beanstalks in Jack the giant slayer
where<00:02:25.930> everything<00:02:26.440> just<00:02:26.470> kind<00:02:26.830> of<00:02:26.920> twists<00:02:27.550> and

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
where everything just kind of twists and

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.479 
where everything just kind of twists and
turns

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
turns

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
cool-looking as we go along we will

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.030 
cool-looking as we go along we will
remove<00:02:37.450> these<00:02:37.720> strings<00:02:38.349> so<00:02:38.530> they<00:02:38.650> don't<00:02:38.800> start

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
remove these strings so they don't start

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.530 
remove these strings so they don't start
cutting<00:02:39.310> into<00:02:39.489> the<00:02:39.580> vines<00:02:39.790> they<00:02:40.060> grow<00:02:40.270> so<00:02:40.510> fast

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
cutting into the vines they grow so fast

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.270 
cutting into the vines they grow so fast
they'll<00:02:40.989> grow<00:02:41.170> right<00:02:41.410> around<00:02:41.709> these<00:02:41.890> strings

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
they'll grow right around these strings

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.580 
they'll grow right around these strings
and<00:02:42.580> then<00:02:43.150> once<00:02:43.360> the

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
and then once the

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.110 
and then once the

then we're going to remove all of the

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:50.370 
then we're going to remove all of the
guide<00:02:48.910> wires<00:02:49.180> that<00:02:49.390> we<00:02:49.510> have<00:02:49.660> on<00:02:49.840> here<00:02:50.080> for<00:02:50.260> the
