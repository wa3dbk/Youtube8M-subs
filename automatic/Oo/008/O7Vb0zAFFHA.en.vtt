00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.359 

the<00:01:06.360> recorded<00:01:06.869> sound<00:01:07.080> is<00:01:07.350> an<00:01:07.560> exactly<00:01:08.070> ideal

the recorded sound is an exactly ideal

the recorded sound is an exactly ideal
but<00:01:09.210> let<00:01:09.390> me<00:01:09.540> show<00:01:09.720> you<00:01:09.780> some<00:01:10.320> simple<00:01:10.770> tricks

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
but let me show you some simple tricks

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.890 
but let me show you some simple tricks
that<00:01:11.250> will<00:01:11.340> help<00:01:11.549> to<00:01:11.880> achieve<00:01:12.000> a<00:01:12.360> much<00:01:12.570> richer

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
that will help to achieve a much richer

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.730 
that will help to achieve a much richer
warmer<00:01:13.770> and<00:01:13.979> living<00:01:14.340> sound<00:01:15.080> first<00:01:16.080> we<00:01:16.439> had<00:01:16.590> a

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
warmer and living sound first we had a

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.550 
warmer and living sound first we had a

some of the unknowing peaks from the

some of the unknowing peaks from the
hi-hat<00:01:21.659> this<00:01:22.500> plug-in<00:01:22.830> is<00:01:23.070> mainly<00:01:23.400> made<00:01:23.790> for

hi-hat this plug-in is mainly made for
the<00:01:24.119> essing<00:01:24.479> but<00:01:24.930> it<00:01:25.020> can<00:01:25.200> also<00:01:25.470> work<00:01:25.650> great<00:01:26.189> as

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
the essing but it can also work great as

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.670 
the essing but it can also work great as
a<00:01:26.490> compressor<00:01:27.150> on<00:01:27.299> other<00:01:27.689> instruments<00:01:28.170> to

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
a compressor on other instruments to

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:46.959 
a compressor on other instruments to

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:46.969 

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:50.330 

second<00:01:47.969> we<00:01:48.210> add<00:01:48.390> an<00:01:48.600> EQ<00:01:48.899> to<00:01:49.289> cover<00:01:49.560> out<00:01:49.770> some<00:01:50.219> of

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
second we add an EQ to cover out some of

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.279 
second we add an EQ to cover out some of
the<00:01:50.460> dull<00:01:50.700> sounding<00:01:51.179> resonance<00:01:51.659> that<00:01:51.869> we<00:01:52.079> in

00:01:52.279 --> 00:01:52.289 
the dull sounding resonance that we in

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:55.999 
the dull sounding resonance that we in
this<00:01:52.560> case<00:01:52.860> find<00:01:53.280> around<00:01:53.880> 500<00:01:54.689> Hertz<00:01:54.960> we<00:01:55.770> also

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
this case find around 500 Hertz we also

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.270 
this case find around 500 Hertz we also
give<00:01:56.399> a<00:01:56.579> little<00:01:56.759> boost<00:01:57.030> around<00:01:57.780> 60<00:01:58.289> Hertz<00:01:58.500> this

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
give a little boost around 60 Hertz this

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:24.300 
give a little boost around 60 Hertz this
especially<00:01:59.819> lifts<00:02:00.630> the<00:02:00.960> Tom's

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.610 

the<00:02:25.310> bass<00:02:25.550> drum<00:02:25.880> lacks<00:02:26.300> that<00:02:26.620> punishing

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
the bass drum lacks that punishing

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.030 
the bass drum lacks that punishing
low-end<00:02:28.100> so<00:02:28.820> we<00:02:28.940> add<00:02:29.090> waves<00:02:29.630> our<00:02:29.930> base<00:02:30.410> our

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
low-end so we add waves our base our

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.100 
low-end so we add waves our base our
bass<00:02:31.370> is<00:02:31.610> a<00:02:31.670> really<00:02:32.090> nice<00:02:32.240> plane<00:02:32.540> that<00:02:32.900> adds

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
bass is a really nice plane that adds

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.160 
bass is a really nice plane that adds
low<00:02:33.740> frequency<00:02:34.550> harmonics<00:02:35.240> to<00:02:35.540> the<00:02:35.660> material

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
low frequency harmonics to the material

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.040 
low frequency harmonics to the material
in<00:02:36.320> this<00:02:37.070> case<00:02:37.340> we<00:02:37.820> add<00:02:37.970> a<00:02:38.210> little<00:02:38.570> bit<00:02:38.690> around

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.050 
in this case we add a little bit around

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:58.720 
in this case we add a little bit around
50<00:02:39.710> Hertz<00:02:55.630> the<00:02:56.630> last<00:02:56.870> thing<00:02:57.350> we<00:02:57.530> do<00:02:57.680> is<00:02:57.890> add<00:02:58.430> a

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
50 Hertz the last thing we do is add a

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.390 
50 Hertz the last thing we do is add a
little<00:02:58.760> bit<00:02:59.209> of<00:02:59.420> reverb<00:02:59.920> from<00:03:00.920> the<00:03:01.070> reverb

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
little bit of reverb from the reverb

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.940 
little bit of reverb from the reverb
plug-in<00:03:01.730> we<00:03:02.209> use<00:03:02.360> a<00:03:02.390> preset<00:03:03.050> called<00:03:03.410> small

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
plug-in we use a preset called small

plug-in we use a preset called small
room<00:03:04.360> we<00:03:05.360> reduce<00:03:05.990> the<00:03:06.230> reverb<00:03:06.590> a<00:03:06.770> little<00:03:07.040> bit

in<00:03:07.340> the<00:03:07.459> low-end<00:03:07.850> and<00:03:08.120> then<00:03:08.510> we<00:03:08.690> send<00:03:08.930> a<00:03:09.020> small

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
in the low-end and then we send a small

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:12.130 
in the low-end and then we send a small
