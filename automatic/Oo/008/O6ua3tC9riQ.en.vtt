00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:26.139 
the idea is the same that you get
yourself<00:01:24.350> sort<00:01:24.770> of<00:01:24.830> psyched<00:01:25.070> up<00:01:25.250> you<00:01:25.490> have<00:01:25.670> you

00:01:26.139 --> 00:01:26.149 
yourself sort of psyched up you have you

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:28.090 
yourself sort of psyched up you have you
memorized<00:01:26.810> your<00:01:26.930> lines<00:01:26.990> and<00:01:27.560> the<00:01:27.619> music<00:01:27.950> and
