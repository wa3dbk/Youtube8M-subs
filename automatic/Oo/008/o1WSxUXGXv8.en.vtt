building myself a wearable computer as
you<00:00:14.730> can<00:00:14.910> see<00:00:15.240> I<00:00:15.480> am<00:00:15.929> wearing<00:00:15.960> a<00:00:16.560> pair<00:00:16.590> of<00:00:17.900> meizu

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930

you can see I am wearing a pair of meizu
crystal<00:00:21.680> over<00:00:22.680> eye<00:00:22.789> displays<00:00:23.789> or<00:00:24.090> head

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
crystal over eye displays or head

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:31.070 
crystal over eye displays or head
mounted<00:00:24.869> displays<00:00:28.010> they<00:00:29.510> work<00:00:30.510> really<00:00:30.840> well

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
mounted displays they work really well

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.290 
mounted displays they work really well
actually<00:00:31.380> they're<00:00:31.890> quite<00:00:32.189> nice<00:00:32.369> I<00:00:32.700> I<00:00:33.120> think

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
actually they're quite nice I I think

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.569 
actually they're quite nice I I think
that<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:33.899> internet<00:00:34.590> pictures<00:00:34.739> don't<00:00:35.340> give

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
that the internet pictures don't give

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.119 
that the internet pictures don't give
justice<00:00:36.329> to<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.600> sheer<00:00:36.840> lack<00:00:37.260> of<00:00:37.559> size<00:00:37.860> of

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
justice to the sheer lack of size of

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:39.860 
justice to the sheer lack of size of
these<00:00:38.309> things<00:00:38.370> they're<00:00:38.910> really<00:00:39.180> quite<00:00:39.540> tiny

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
these things they're really quite tiny

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.030 
these things they're really quite tiny
and<00:00:40.379> extremely<00:00:41.100> lightweight<00:00:42.559> they're<00:00:43.559> there

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
and extremely lightweight they're there

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.049 
and extremely lightweight they're there
they're<00:00:44.520> excellent<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:46.460> control<00:00:47.460> device<00:00:47.789> is

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
they're excellent the control device is

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.690 
they're excellent the control device is
right<00:00:48.270> here<00:00:48.739> again<00:00:49.739> let<00:00:50.010> me<00:00:50.039> just<00:00:50.129> give<00:00:50.460> you<00:00:50.489> an

right here again let me just give you an
idea<00:00:50.850> of<00:00:51.059> how<00:00:51.270> small<00:00:51.660> this<00:00:51.899> is<00:00:52.140> I'm<00:00:52.469> holding<00:00:53.010> it

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
idea of how small this is I'm holding it

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.840 
idea of how small this is I'm holding it
into<00:00:53.430> my<00:00:53.579> in<00:00:53.879> my<00:00:53.910> hand<00:00:54.329> here<00:00:54.629> it's<00:00:54.899> it's<00:00:55.350> tiny

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
into my in my hand here it's it's tiny

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.689 
into my in my hand here it's it's tiny
so<00:00:57.360> yes<00:00:57.600> everything<00:00:58.140> about<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.100> my<00:00:59.520> view

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
so yes everything about the my view

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.880 
so yes everything about the my view
crystal<00:01:00.090> is<00:01:00.239> tiny<00:01:00.570> which<00:01:01.199> is<00:01:01.379> nice<00:01:01.559> because

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
crystal is tiny which is nice because

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.740 
crystal is tiny which is nice because
you<00:01:02.489> know<00:01:02.520> you<00:01:02.850> want<00:01:03.000> a<00:01:03.059> wearable<00:01:03.329> computer

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
you know you want a wearable computer

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.030 
you know you want a wearable computer
not<00:01:03.899> to<00:01:04.019> be<00:01:04.110> too<00:01:04.260> big<00:01:04.500> so<00:01:05.369> anyway<00:01:06.290> my<00:01:07.290> plan<00:01:07.619> is

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
not to be too big so anyway my plan is

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.190 
not to be too big so anyway my plan is
to<00:01:08.250> take<00:01:08.460> these<00:01:09.409> dual<00:01:10.409> screen<00:01:11.070> if<00:01:11.340> you<00:01:11.520> will

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200 
to take these dual screen if you will

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.719 
to take these dual screen if you will
glasses<00:01:13.200> and<00:01:13.409> turn<00:01:14.070> them<00:01:14.250> into<00:01:14.400> a<00:01:14.460> single

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
glasses and turn them into a single

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.200 
glasses and turn them into a single
display<00:01:15.060> I<00:01:15.650> want<00:01:16.650> to<00:01:16.830> take<00:01:17.100> them<00:01:17.250> apart<00:01:17.369> void

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
display I want to take them apart void

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.730 
display I want to take them apart void
my<00:01:18.479> warranty<00:01:18.509> and<00:01:20.780> basically<00:01:21.780> make<00:01:22.140> a<00:01:22.170> single

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
my warranty and basically make a single

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.679 
my warranty and basically make a single
one<00:01:23.159> eye<00:01:23.189> display<00:01:23.820> out<00:01:24.030> of<00:01:24.150> it<00:01:24.240> that<00:01:24.390> will<00:01:24.479> be

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
one eye display out of it that will be

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.219 
one eye display out of it that will be
mounted<00:01:24.900> to<00:01:25.290> a<00:01:25.320> pair<00:01:25.590> of<00:01:25.710> glasses<00:01:27.229> hopefully

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
mounted to a pair of glasses hopefully

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.510 
mounted to a pair of glasses hopefully
that<00:01:28.409> should<00:01:28.530> make<00:01:28.680> it<00:01:28.829> look<00:01:29.009> a<00:01:29.100> little<00:01:29.310> bit

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
that should make it look a little bit

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:30.920 
that should make it look a little bit
more<00:01:29.850> normal

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
more normal

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.200 
more normal
well<00:01:31.409> not<00:01:32.009> normal<00:01:32.549> but<00:01:32.670> at<00:01:32.790> least<00:01:32.909> a<00:01:33.060> little

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
well not normal but at least a little

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.109 
well not normal but at least a little
bit<00:01:33.450> less<00:01:33.659> or<00:01:34.079> o'clock<00:01:34.640> although<00:01:35.640> it<00:01:35.820> is<00:01:35.939> worth

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
bit less or o'clock although it is worth

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.999 
bit less or o'clock although it is worth
noting<00:01:36.659> that<00:01:36.689> I<00:01:36.900> actually<00:01:37.259> have<00:01:37.680> a<00:01:37.710> fair

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
noting that I actually have a fair

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.800 
noting that I actually have a fair
amount<00:01:38.040> of<00:01:38.340> periphery<00:01:38.850> vision<00:01:39.270> I'm<00:01:39.479> looking

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
amount of periphery vision I'm looking

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.630 
amount of periphery vision I'm looking
directly<00:01:40.079> into<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:40.500> camera<00:01:40.799> right<00:01:41.130> now<00:01:41.159> I<00:01:41.340> can

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
directly into the camera right now I can

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.730 
directly into the camera right now I can
see<00:01:41.820> it<00:01:41.939> just<00:01:41.970> fine<00:01:42.180> I<00:01:42.659> can't<00:01:43.350> tell<00:01:43.560> whether

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
see it just fine I can't tell whether

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.060 
see it just fine I can't tell whether
you<00:01:43.920> can<00:01:44.070> see<00:01:44.310> me<00:01:44.490> because<00:01:44.790> I'm<00:01:45.240> actually

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 
you can see me because I'm actually

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.590 
you can see me because I'm actually
looking<00:01:47.070> at<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:47.310> output<00:01:47.549> of<00:01:47.820> the<00:01:48.030> camera<00:01:48.450> on

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
looking at the output of the camera on

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.399 
looking at the output of the camera on
the<00:01:49.100> crystal<00:01:50.100> display<00:01:50.460> so<00:01:50.850> I<00:01:51.200> can't<00:01:52.200> tell<00:01:52.380> but

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
the crystal display so I can't tell but

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.580 
the crystal display so I can't tell but
I<00:01:52.680> will<00:01:52.860> be<00:01:53.009> able<00:01:53.100> to<00:01:53.220> soon<00:01:53.490> anyway<00:01:54.329> so<00:01:54.439> this<00:01:55.439> is

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
I will be able to soon anyway so this is

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.709 
I will be able to soon anyway so this is
step<00:01:55.799> one<00:01:56.040> as<00:01:56.340> you<00:01:56.909> can<00:01:57.060> see<00:01:57.210> they<00:01:57.390> work<00:01:57.540> great

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
step one as you can see they work great

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.480 
step one as you can see they work great
they're<00:01:58.140> actually<00:01:58.560> quite<00:01:58.710> nice<00:01:58.979> I<00:01:59.310> would

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
they're actually quite nice I would

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.969 
they're actually quite nice I would
highly<00:01:59.759> recommend<00:02:00.180> them<00:02:00.680> but<00:02:01.680> we're<00:02:01.890> gonna

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
highly recommend them but we're gonna

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.590 
highly recommend them but we're gonna
see<00:02:02.219> whether<00:02:02.399> they'll<00:02:02.640> work<00:02:02.850> well<00:02:03.090> for<00:02:03.540> a

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
see whether they'll work well for a

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.770 
see whether they'll work well for a
wearable<00:02:04.140> computer<00:02:05.210> I've<00:02:06.210> just<00:02:06.420> taken<00:02:06.600> the

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
wearable computer I've just taken the

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.139 
wearable computer I've just taken the
first<00:02:06.899> bit<00:02:07.320> of<00:02:07.350> the<00:02:07.530> casing<00:02:07.979> off<00:02:08.099> this<00:02:08.940> little

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
first bit of the casing off this little

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.910 
first bit of the casing off this little
bit<00:02:09.390> of<00:02:09.479> plastic<00:02:09.929> here<00:02:10.200> just<00:02:10.410> slipped

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
there as you can see maybe oh yeah that

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.250 
there as you can see maybe oh yeah that
won't<00:02:14.400> focus<00:02:14.819> but<00:02:15.060> as<00:02:15.480> you<00:02:15.690> would<00:02:15.810> be<00:02:15.989> able<00:02:16.080> to

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
won't focus but as you would be able to

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.140 
won't focus but as you would be able to
see<00:02:16.440> that<00:02:16.590> was<00:02:16.800> hiding<00:02:17.310> two<00:02:17.550> tiny<00:02:17.940> little

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
see that was hiding two tiny little

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.960 
see that was hiding two tiny little
screws<00:02:18.650> so<00:02:19.650> I'm<00:02:19.920> hoping<00:02:20.280> that<00:02:20.340> some<00:02:20.790> of<00:02:20.819> this

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
screws so I'm hoping that some of this

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.199 
screws so I'm hoping that some of this
other<00:02:21.150> casing<00:02:21.660> will<00:02:21.810> come<00:02:21.989> off<00:02:22.170> fairly<00:02:22.530> easily

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
other casing will come off fairly easily

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:26.420 
other casing will come off fairly easily
in<00:02:24.209> case<00:02:24.390> it<00:02:24.540> wasn't<00:02:24.690> clear<00:02:24.840> from<00:02:25.290> that's<00:02:26.130> a

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
in case it wasn't clear from that's a

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.340 
in case it wasn't clear from that's a
second<00:02:26.670> ago<00:02:26.849> this<00:02:27.090> just<00:02:27.480> pried<00:02:27.780> off<00:02:28.020> it<00:02:28.260> was

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
second ago this just pried off it was

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.470 
second ago this just pried off it was
just<00:02:28.380> glued<00:02:28.709> on<00:02:28.890> it<00:02:29.400> was<00:02:29.520> it<00:02:30.060> was<00:02:30.209> almost

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
just glued on it was it was almost

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.190 
just glued on it was it was almost
falling<00:02:30.900> off<00:02:31.170> it<00:02:31.380> was<00:02:31.500> fairly<00:02:31.680> easy<00:02:31.830> to<00:02:32.160> remove

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
falling off it was fairly easy to remove

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.410 
falling off it was fairly easy to remove
next<00:02:34.200> step<00:02:34.680> of<00:02:34.860> disassembly<00:02:35.489> done<00:02:35.790> as<00:02:36.150> you

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
next step of disassembly done as you

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.110 
next step of disassembly done as you
almost<00:02:36.690> certainly<00:02:37.170> cannot<00:02:37.560> see<00:02:37.980> there<00:02:38.910> is

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
almost certainly cannot see there is

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.589 
almost certainly cannot see there is
glue<00:02:39.989> holding<00:02:40.769> that<00:02:41.040> plug<00:02:41.610> in<00:02:41.849> place<00:02:42.180> which<00:02:42.480> is

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 
glue holding that plug in place which is

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:44.540 
glue holding that plug in place which is
really<00:02:42.870> annoying<00:02:43.110> so<00:02:44.010> I'm<00:02:44.100> going<00:02:44.280> to<00:02:44.370> have<00:02:44.459> to

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
really annoying so I'm going to have to

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:50.449 
really annoying so I'm going to have to
get<00:02:44.670> rid<00:02:44.819> of<00:02:44.910> the<00:02:45.030> glue<00:02:45.269> and<00:02:48.680> this<00:02:49.680> part<00:02:50.100> the

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
get rid of the glue and this part the

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:53.210 
get rid of the glue and this part the
part<00:02:50.730> just<00:02:51.360> inside<00:02:51.780> of<00:02:51.989> this<00:02:52.170> plastic<00:02:52.920> sheath

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
part just inside of this plastic sheath

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.550 
part just inside of this plastic sheath
actually<00:02:54.150> also<00:02:54.450> just<00:02:54.630> pried<00:02:54.870> apart<00:02:55.019> it<00:02:55.440> was

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
actually also just pried apart it was

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.150 
actually also just pried apart it was
not<00:02:57.080> screwed<00:02:58.080> in<00:02:58.290> I<00:02:58.470> thought<00:02:58.680> it<00:02:58.799> was<00:02:58.920> screwed

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
not screwed in I thought it was screwed

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.270 
not screwed in I thought it was screwed
in<00:02:59.310> that<00:02:59.910> was<00:03:00.060> wrong<00:03:00.269> it<00:03:00.510> was<00:03:00.600> just<00:03:00.810> glued<00:03:01.049> in

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
in that was wrong it was just glued in

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.100 
in that was wrong it was just glued in
as<00:03:02.280> you<00:03:02.430> can<00:03:02.580> clearly<00:03:02.730> see<00:03:02.970> I've<00:03:03.420> now<00:03:03.690> removed

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
as you can clearly see I've now removed

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.380 
as you can clearly see I've now removed
the<00:03:04.319> casing<00:03:04.769> from<00:03:04.920> both<00:03:05.190> sides<00:03:05.519> really

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
the casing from both sides really

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.570 
the casing from both sides really
nothing<00:03:06.720> to<00:03:06.840> report<00:03:07.170> in<00:03:07.319> the<00:03:07.380> left<00:03:07.590> eye<00:03:07.799> it<00:03:08.459> was

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
nothing to report in the left eye it was

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.860 
nothing to report in the left eye it was
just<00:03:08.819> as<00:03:08.910> easy<00:03:09.120> to<00:03:09.209> the<00:03:09.360> right<00:03:09.510> eye<00:03:09.540> of<00:03:09.810> course

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
just as easy to the right eye of course

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:16.640 
just as easy to the right eye of course
okay<00:03:12.870> my<00:03:13.080> current<00:03:13.530> suspicion<00:03:14.280> is<00:03:14.910> that<00:03:15.840> this

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
okay my current suspicion is that this

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:21.620 
okay my current suspicion is that this
frame<00:03:17.430> here<00:03:19.130> actually<00:03:20.239> should<00:03:21.239> just<00:03:21.420> pop

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
frame here actually should just pop

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.449 
frame here actually should just pop
right<00:03:21.690> off<00:03:22.140> like<00:03:22.350> none<00:03:22.650> of<00:03:22.769> this<00:03:22.890> is<00:03:23.130> really

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
right off like none of this is really

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:28.160 
right off like none of this is really
attached<00:03:24.450> to<00:03:24.840> that<00:03:24.959> frame<00:03:25.560> and<00:03:26.450> so<00:03:27.450> if<00:03:27.900> that's

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
attached to that frame and so if that's

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.460 
attached to that frame and so if that's
the<00:03:28.440> case<00:03:29.390> there's<00:03:30.390> the<00:03:30.810> problem<00:03:31.109> that

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
the case there's the problem that

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.979 
the case there's the problem that
there's<00:03:31.680> this<00:03:31.920> bit<00:03:32.190> of<00:03:32.340> really<00:03:33.120> mega<00:03:33.540> glue

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
there's this bit of really mega glue

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:37.340 
there's this bit of really mega glue
right<00:03:34.320> here<00:03:34.459> that<00:03:35.459> does<00:03:35.640> not<00:03:35.910> want<00:03:36.329> to<00:03:36.450> come

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
right here that does not want to come

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:40.250 
right here that does not want to come
off<00:03:37.519> it<00:03:38.519> looks<00:03:39.420> almost<00:03:39.660> like<00:03:39.900> they<00:03:40.140> actually

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
off it looks almost like they actually

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:41.870 
off it looks almost like they actually
melted<00:03:40.890> the<00:03:41.070> two<00:03:41.220> pieces<00:03:41.579> of<00:03:41.609> plastic

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
melted the two pieces of plastic

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.830 
melted the two pieces of plastic
together<00:03:42.510> it's<00:03:42.780> such<00:03:43.019> an<00:03:43.140> insane<00:03:43.560> gluing<00:03:44.100> job

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
together it's such an insane gluing job

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.810 
together it's such an insane gluing job
but<00:03:45.840> I<00:03:46.079> don't<00:03:46.590> have<00:03:46.739> any<00:03:46.829> confidence<00:03:47.280> in<00:03:47.609> that

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:47.820 
but I don't have any confidence in that

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:49.699 
but I don't have any confidence in that
analysis<00:03:48.480> at<00:03:48.630> all<00:03:48.750> I<00:03:48.780> might<00:03:49.109> find<00:03:49.410> out<00:03:49.530> that

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
analysis at all I might find out that

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:51.080 
analysis at all I might find out that
ultimately<00:03:50.130> that's<00:03:50.340> not<00:03:50.579> what<00:03:50.760> I<00:03:50.790> need<00:03:51.000> to

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
ultimately that's not what I need to

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.930 
ultimately that's not what I need to
take<00:03:51.239> apart<00:03:51.600> but<00:03:52.489> something<00:03:53.489> needs<00:03:53.609> to<00:03:53.790> come

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
take apart but something needs to come

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:55.340 
take apart but something needs to come
apart<00:03:54.239> and<00:03:54.450> I'm<00:03:54.510> just<00:03:54.690> gonna<00:03:54.810> keep<00:03:55.049> right<00:03:55.319> on

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
apart and I'm just gonna keep right on

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.940 
apart and I'm just gonna keep right on
prying<00:03:55.890> until<00:03:56.220> I<00:03:56.250> figure<00:03:56.579> out<00:03:56.640> what

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:57.950 
prying until I figure out what

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:00.319 
prying until I figure out what
eventually<00:03:58.950> this<00:03:59.340> little<00:03:59.640> black<00:03:59.880> frame

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:00.329 
eventually this little black frame

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:03.890 
eventually this little black frame
popped<00:04:00.750> off<00:04:01.730> although<00:04:02.730> as<00:04:03.000> you<00:04:03.420> can<00:04:03.600> probably

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
popped off although as you can probably

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.250 
popped off although as you can probably
plainly<00:04:04.739> see<00:04:05.100> it<00:04:06.090> left<00:04:06.420> a<00:04:06.569> little<00:04:06.870> bit<00:04:07.139> of

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
plainly see it left a little bit of

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.069 
plainly see it left a little bit of
itself<00:04:07.590> behind<00:04:08.359> but<00:04:09.359> hopefully<00:04:09.720> that's<00:04:09.900> not<00:04:09.989> a

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:10.079 
itself behind but hopefully that's not a

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:11.509 
itself behind but hopefully that's not a
problem<00:04:10.350> because<00:04:10.620> again<00:04:10.950> I<00:04:10.980> don't<00:04:11.250> need<00:04:11.400> to

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:11.519 
problem because again I don't need to

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:15.379 
problem because again I don't need to
use<00:04:11.700> this<00:04:11.910> piece<00:04:12.209> so<00:04:13.069> I'm<00:04:14.069> getting<00:04:14.519> closer<00:04:15.030> to

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:15.389 
use this piece so I'm getting closer to

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:16.789 
use this piece so I'm getting closer to
my<00:04:15.510> ultimate<00:04:15.810> goal<00:04:16.139> now<00:04:16.320> I<00:04:16.350> just<00:04:16.470> need<00:04:16.739> to

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 
my ultimate goal now I just need to

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:20.690 
my ultimate goal now I just need to

okay<00:04:25.590> this<00:04:25.830> was<00:04:26.010> an<00:04:26.130> interesting<00:04:26.340> discovery

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440 
okay this was an interesting discovery

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.900 
okay this was an interesting discovery
this<00:04:28.440> piece<00:04:28.740> the<00:04:29.010> part<00:04:29.220> you<00:04:29.340> actually<00:04:29.490> look

this piece the part you actually look

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:32.180 
this piece the part you actually look
through<00:04:30.120> with<00:04:30.300> a<00:04:30.330> viewport<00:04:30.960> if<00:04:31.139> you<00:04:31.260> will<00:04:31.440> is

through with a viewport if you will is

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:34.360 
through with a viewport if you will is
actually<00:04:32.639> just<00:04:32.760> a<00:04:32.970> completely<00:04:33.780> separate

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:34.370 
actually just a completely separate

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:37.790 
actually just a completely separate
electronics<00:04:35.370> free<00:04:36.050> piece<00:04:37.050> of<00:04:37.080> glass<00:04:37.530> and

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 
electronics free piece of glass and

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.909 
electronics free piece of glass and
plastic<00:04:38.030> so<00:04:39.030> it<00:04:39.180> copped<00:04:39.450> out<00:04:39.720> and<00:04:40.590> now<00:04:40.770> I<00:04:40.800> just

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:40.919 
plastic so it copped out and now I just

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:43.640 
plastic so it copped out and now I just
have<00:04:41.250> to<00:04:41.280> remove<00:04:41.669> that<00:04:42.230> projector<00:04:43.230> for<00:04:43.500> lack

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:43.650 
have to remove that projector for lack

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:45.740 
have to remove that projector for lack
of<00:04:43.800> a<00:04:43.889> better<00:04:43.980> term<00:04:44.130> and<00:04:45.060> it<00:04:45.180> looks<00:04:45.389> like<00:04:45.510> it

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:45.750 
of a better term and it looks like it

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:48.680 
of a better term and it looks like it
should<00:04:45.900> just<00:04:46.050> slide<00:04:46.169> out<00:04:46.410> once<00:04:46.860> I've<00:04:47.040> got<00:04:47.690> once

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:48.690 
should just slide out once I've got once

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:50.870 
should just slide out once I've got once
I've<00:04:48.840> got<00:04:49.020> this<00:04:49.169> piece<00:04:49.440> sort<00:04:49.800> of<00:04:49.889> separated<00:04:50.550> so

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:50.880 
I've got this piece sort of separated so

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:52.970 
I've got this piece sort of separated so
it's<00:04:51.600> looking<00:04:51.840> pretty<00:04:51.960> good<00:04:52.080> at<00:04:52.290> this<00:04:52.410> point<00:04:52.650> I

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:52.980 
it's looking pretty good at this point I

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:54.890 
it's looking pretty good at this point I
don't<00:04:53.100> know<00:04:53.250> how<00:04:53.400> I'm<00:04:53.550> going<00:04:53.700> to<00:04:53.850> get<00:04:54.300> this<00:04:54.600> to

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:54.900 
don't know how I'm going to get this to

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.440 
don't know how I'm going to get this to
sort<00:04:55.080> of<00:04:55.200> stay<00:04:55.530> attached<00:04:55.860> to<00:04:56.100> that<00:04:56.280> but<00:04:56.700> I<00:04:56.940> can

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:57.450 
sort of stay attached to that but I can

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:58.820 
sort of stay attached to that but I can
worry<00:04:57.660> about<00:04:57.750> that<00:04:58.080> once<00:04:58.350> I've<00:04:58.500> got<00:04:58.650> this

00:04:58.820 --> 00:04:58.830 
worry about that once I've got this

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:04.280 
worry about that once I've got this
piece<00:04:59.040> out<00:05:00.710> well<00:05:01.710> I<00:05:02.040> have<00:05:02.400> that<00:05:02.610> part<00:05:02.880> out<00:05:03.060> oh<00:05:03.450> I

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:04.290 
piece out well I have that part out oh I

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:06.230 
piece out well I have that part out oh I
should<00:05:04.620> mention<00:05:04.800> I<00:05:05.070> took<00:05:05.550> off<00:05:05.700> the<00:05:05.730> other<00:05:05.880> ear

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.240 
should mention I took off the other ear

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.030 
should mention I took off the other ear
piece<00:05:06.419> entirely<00:05:06.870> there<00:05:07.500> was<00:05:07.620> really<00:05:07.860> nothing

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:08.040 
piece entirely there was really nothing

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.190 
piece entirely there was really nothing
left<00:05:08.610> to<00:05:08.790> do<00:05:08.910> to<00:05:09.090> take<00:05:09.210> it<00:05:09.270> off<00:05:09.480> I<00:05:09.690> just<00:05:09.900> got<00:05:10.080> rid

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:10.200 
left to do to take it off I just got rid

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:12.220 
left to do to take it off I just got rid
of<00:05:10.260> it<00:05:10.410> cuz<00:05:10.500> it<00:05:10.590> was<00:05:10.710> in<00:05:10.770> the<00:05:10.830> way<00:05:10.980> anyway

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:12.230 
of it cuz it was in the way anyway

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:14.060 
of it cuz it was in the way anyway
unfortunately<00:05:13.230> it<00:05:13.290> looks<00:05:13.440> like<00:05:13.620> I'm<00:05:13.830> pretty

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:14.070 
unfortunately it looks like I'm pretty

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:15.620 
unfortunately it looks like I'm pretty
much<00:05:14.250> gonna<00:05:14.430> have<00:05:14.550> to<00:05:14.669> break<00:05:14.880> the<00:05:15.060> plastic<00:05:15.240> at

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:15.630 
much gonna have to break the plastic at

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:18.409 
much gonna have to break the plastic at
this<00:05:15.780> point<00:05:16.080> because<00:05:16.500> these<00:05:17.160> two<00:05:17.490> pieces<00:05:18.000> are

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:18.419 
this point because these two pieces are

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:21.650 
this point because these two pieces are
connected<00:05:19.410> and<00:05:20.100> just<00:05:20.370> so<00:05:20.610> incredibly<00:05:21.180> thick

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:21.660 
connected and just so incredibly thick

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:23.719 
connected and just so incredibly thick
that<00:05:21.870> I<00:05:21.900> can't<00:05:22.260> pry<00:05:22.500> them<00:05:22.710> apart<00:05:22.740> enough<00:05:23.460> to

00:05:23.719 --> 00:05:23.729 
that I can't pry them apart enough to

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:26.090 
that I can't pry them apart enough to
get<00:05:23.910> this<00:05:24.120> piece<00:05:24.419> out<00:05:24.690> I<00:05:25.020> can<00:05:25.710> do<00:05:25.830> it<00:05:25.950> with<00:05:26.070> a

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:26.100 
get this piece out I can do it with a

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:28.159 
get this piece out I can do it with a
pair<00:05:26.310> of<00:05:26.340> pliers<00:05:26.669> but<00:05:27.090> only<00:05:27.240> with<00:05:27.479> both<00:05:27.690> hands

00:05:28.159 --> 00:05:28.169 
pair of pliers but only with both hands

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:30.409 
pair of pliers but only with both hands
so<00:05:28.830> that<00:05:29.280> doesn't<00:05:29.490> help<00:05:29.700> me<00:05:29.820> any<00:05:29.850> cuz<00:05:30.180> I<00:05:30.270> only

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:30.419 
so that doesn't help me any cuz I only

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:33.350 
so that doesn't help me any cuz I only
have<00:05:30.630> two<00:05:30.840> hands<00:05:31.080> so<00:05:31.520> I'm<00:05:32.520> just<00:05:32.700> gonna<00:05:32.880> stick<00:05:33.300> a

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:33.360 
have two hands so I'm just gonna stick a

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.540 
have two hands so I'm just gonna stick a
large<00:05:33.720> screwdriver<00:05:34.410> in<00:05:34.680> there<00:05:34.890> and<00:05:35.160> hit<00:05:35.520> it

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:35.550 
large screwdriver in there and hit it

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:37.550 
large screwdriver in there and hit it
with<00:05:35.760> a<00:05:35.790> hammer<00:05:35.880> and<00:05:36.419> hopefully<00:05:36.900> break<00:05:37.350> the

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:37.560 
with a hammer and hopefully break the

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:40.000 
with a hammer and hopefully break the
plastic<00:05:37.740> without<00:05:38.340> breaking<00:05:38.729> anything<00:05:38.940> else

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:40.010 
plastic without breaking anything else

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:43.850 
plastic without breaking anything else
okay<00:05:41.010> I<00:05:41.039> finally<00:05:41.430> managed<00:05:41.970> to<00:05:42.150> get<00:05:42.300> the<00:05:42.860> amber

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:43.860 
okay I finally managed to get the amber

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:46.370 
okay I finally managed to get the amber
piece<00:05:44.070> off<00:05:44.370> as<00:05:45.000> you<00:05:45.240> can<00:05:45.270> see<00:05:45.630> I<00:05:45.660> did<00:05:46.020> that<00:05:46.200> by

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:46.380 
piece off as you can see I did that by

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:48.680 
piece off as you can see I did that by
just<00:05:46.620> shattering<00:05:47.280> it<00:05:47.430> entirely<00:05:47.880> but<00:05:48.390> hey<00:05:48.660> I

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:48.690 
just shattering it entirely but hey I

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:51.800 
just shattering it entirely but hey I
don't<00:05:48.870> need<00:05:49.080> it<00:05:49.200> anymore<00:05:50.240> so<00:05:51.240> this<00:05:51.450> is<00:05:51.660> the

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:51.810 
don't need it anymore so this is the

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:54.440 
don't need it anymore so this is the
result<00:05:52.169> I<00:05:52.580> just<00:05:53.580> taped<00:05:53.850> everything<00:05:54.330> together

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:54.450 
result I just taped everything together

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:56.390 
result I just taped everything together
crudely<00:05:54.930> because<00:05:55.289> it<00:05:55.530> turns<00:05:55.710> out<00:05:55.890> those<00:05:56.100> black

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:56.400 
crudely because it turns out those black

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.219 
crudely because it turns out those black
pieces<00:05:56.669> were<00:05:57.180> all<00:05:57.240> being<00:05:57.539> held<00:05:57.780> in<00:05:57.990> place<00:05:58.140> by

00:05:58.219 --> 00:05:58.229 
pieces were all being held in place by

00:05:58.229 --> 00:06:00.260 
pieces were all being held in place by
the<00:05:58.500> amber<00:05:58.979> piece<00:05:59.190> but<00:05:59.400> in<00:05:59.550> fact<00:05:59.700> the<00:05:59.880> tape<00:06:00.090> is

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:00.270 
the amber piece but in fact the tape is

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:02.450 
the amber piece but in fact the tape is
working<00:06:00.570> surprisingly<00:06:01.110> well

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:02.460 
working surprisingly well

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:05.270 
working surprisingly well
what<00:06:03.000> I'm<00:06:03.090> going<00:06:03.270> to<00:06:03.360> try<00:06:03.510> to<00:06:03.539> do<00:06:03.750> next<00:06:04.050> is<00:06:04.830> take

what I'm going to try to do next is take

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:08.960 
what I'm going to try to do next is take
off<00:06:05.550> this<00:06:05.940> eye<00:06:07.070> glass<00:06:08.070> piece<00:06:08.430> because<00:06:08.789> that's

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:08.970 
off this eye glass piece because that's

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:10.610 
off this eye glass piece because that's
what<00:06:09.150> sort<00:06:09.300> of<00:06:09.390> forcing<00:06:09.810> it<00:06:09.930> to<00:06:09.960> be<00:06:10.140> right<00:06:10.500> in

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:10.620 
what sort of forcing it to be right in

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:12.260 
what sort of forcing it to be right in
the<00:06:10.710> middle<00:06:10.860> of<00:06:10.979> your<00:06:11.130> vision

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:12.270 
the middle of your vision

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:16.100 
the middle of your vision
mount<00:06:12.990> it's<00:06:13.289> back<00:06:13.680> in<00:06:14.039> the<00:06:14.570> original<00:06:15.570> mount

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:16.110 
mount it's back in the original mount

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:17.990 
mount it's back in the original mount
just<00:06:17.070> to<00:06:17.160> sort<00:06:17.340> of<00:06:17.430> cover<00:06:17.640> up<00:06:17.729> all<00:06:17.970> the

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:18.000 
just to sort of cover up all the

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.409 
just to sort of cover up all the
electronics<00:06:18.870> and<00:06:19.830> then<00:06:20.640> maybe<00:06:20.910> I<00:06:21.030> can<00:06:21.150> mount

00:06:21.409 --> 00:06:21.419 
electronics and then maybe I can mount

00:06:21.419 --> 00:06:24.650 
electronics and then maybe I can mount
it<00:06:21.539> to<00:06:21.600> some<00:06:21.810> glasses<00:06:22.200> so<00:06:22.890> we'll<00:06:23.430> see<00:06:23.640> so<00:06:24.479> here

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:24.660 
it to some glasses so we'll see so here

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:25.720 
it to some glasses so we'll see so here
is

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:25.730 
is

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:28.690 
is
single<00:06:26.570> eye<00:06:26.690> piece<00:06:26.960> it's<00:06:27.890> been<00:06:28.100> mounted<00:06:28.520> into

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:28.700 
single eye piece it's been mounted into

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:30.880 
single eye piece it's been mounted into
the<00:06:28.880> frame<00:06:29.260> except<00:06:30.260> for<00:06:30.440> a<00:06:30.470> little<00:06:30.590> bit<00:06:30.800> of

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:30.890 
the frame except for a little bit of

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:32.320 
the frame except for a little bit of
tape<00:06:31.070> sticking<00:06:31.520> out<00:06:31.640> it<00:06:31.820> actually<00:06:31.940> looks

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:32.330 
tape sticking out it actually looks

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:34.660 
tape sticking out it actually looks
pretty<00:06:32.420> okay<00:06:32.930> and<00:06:33.290> of<00:06:33.860> course<00:06:34.100> you<00:06:34.370> know<00:06:34.460> it's

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:34.670 
pretty okay and of course you know it's

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:36.520 
pretty okay and of course you know it's
just<00:06:34.820> sort<00:06:35.030> of<00:06:35.060> bare<00:06:35.300> wires<00:06:35.600> hanging<00:06:35.960> out<00:06:36.200> here

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:36.530 
just sort of bare wires hanging out here

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:37.660 
just sort of bare wires hanging out here
but<00:06:36.710> they're<00:06:36.830> all<00:06:36.920> taped<00:06:37.160> in<00:06:37.340> I<00:06:37.430> don't<00:06:37.490> think

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:37.670 
but they're all taped in I don't think

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:39.580 
but they're all taped in I don't think
that<00:06:37.970> there's<00:06:38.120> too<00:06:38.870> much<00:06:38.990> danger<00:06:39.410> of<00:06:39.440> them

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:39.590 
that there's too much danger of them

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:43.540 
that there's too much danger of them
getting<00:06:39.770> broken<00:06:41.110> so<00:06:42.110> if<00:06:42.410> I<00:06:42.530> just<00:06:42.800> mount<00:06:43.370> this

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:43.550 
getting broken so if I just mount this

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:46.300 
getting broken so if I just mount this
to<00:06:43.610> some<00:06:43.880> glasses<00:06:44.360> like<00:06:44.540> this<00:06:45.100> then<00:06:46.100> I've

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:46.310 
to some glasses like this then I've

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:48.550 
to some glasses like this then I've
actually<00:06:46.520> got<00:06:46.850> a<00:06:46.880> pretty<00:06:47.360> good<00:06:47.570> little<00:06:47.720> one<00:06:48.530> I

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:48.560 
actually got a pretty good little one I

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:50.320 
actually got a pretty good little one I
headset<00:06:49.400> here

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:50.330 
headset here

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:52.330 
headset here
I<00:06:50.360> think<00:06:51.020> the<00:06:51.200> mounting<00:06:51.650> actually<00:06:52.010> shouldn't

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:52.340 
I think the mounting actually shouldn't

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:54.730 
I think the mounting actually shouldn't
be<00:06:52.430> that<00:06:52.670> complicated<00:06:53.210> this<00:06:53.750> should<00:06:54.410> pretty

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:54.740 
be that complicated this should pretty

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:59.170 
be that complicated this should pretty
well<00:06:54.890> just<00:06:54.920> fit<00:06:57.220> yeah<00:06:58.220> I<00:06:58.520> think<00:06:58.760> this<00:06:59.030> turned

00:06:59.170 --> 00:06:59.180 
well just fit yeah I think this turned

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:00.940 
well just fit yeah I think this turned
out<00:06:59.420> pretty<00:06:59.570> darn<00:06:59.840> well<00:06:59.930> I<00:07:00.080> would<00:07:00.410> highly

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:00.950 
out pretty darn well I would highly

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:04.480 
out pretty darn well I would highly
recommend<00:07:01.370> the<00:07:01.490> my<00:07:01.670> view<00:07:01.850> crystal<00:07:02.300> as<00:07:02.540> a<00:07:03.490> way

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:04.490 
recommend the my view crystal as a way

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:07.330 
recommend the my view crystal as a way
of<00:07:04.520> making<00:07:04.790> a<00:07:05.030> one<00:07:05.240> I<00:07:05.270> had<00:07:05.690> set<00:07:05.930> the<00:07:06.740> second

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:07.340 
of making a one I had set the second

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:09.310 
of making a one I had set the second
installment<00:07:07.670> of<00:07:08.150> this<00:07:08.510> series<00:07:08.930> should<00:07:08.960> be

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:09.320 
installment of this series should be

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:10.660 
installment of this series should be
mounting<00:07:09.650> it<00:07:09.740> to<00:07:09.800> glasses<00:07:10.340> I'm<00:07:10.490> actually

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:10.670 
mounting it to glasses I'm actually

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:12.790 
mounting it to glasses I'm actually
having<00:07:10.970> some<00:07:11.360> safety<00:07:11.600> glasses<00:07:11.960> ship<00:07:12.380> because

00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:12.800 
having some safety glasses ship because

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:14.560 
having some safety glasses ship because
though<00:07:13.340> they're<00:07:13.550> clear<00:07:13.850> and<00:07:13.880> I<00:07:14.090> don't<00:07:14.150> wear

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:14.570 
though they're clear and I don't wear

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:18.010 
though they're clear and I don't wear
prescription<00:07:15.140> lenses<00:07:16.150> that<00:07:17.150> one<00:07:17.690> shouldn't

00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:18.020 
prescription lenses that one shouldn't

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:20.470 
prescription lenses that one shouldn't
take<00:07:18.140> too<00:07:18.170> long<00:07:18.500> and<00:07:18.770> then<00:07:19.760> the<00:07:20.180> third

00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:20.480 
take too long and then the third

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:22.570 
take too long and then the third
installment<00:07:20.810> will<00:07:21.170> be<00:07:21.350> hooking<00:07:21.770> it<00:07:21.890> all<00:07:22.070> up<00:07:22.280> to

00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:22.580 
installment will be hooking it all up to

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:25.330 
installment will be hooking it all up to
the<00:07:22.760> pandoro<00:07:23.450> but<00:07:24.020> that'll<00:07:24.320> be<00:07:24.350> in<00:07:24.920> a<00:07:25.010> month<00:07:25.190> or

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:25.340 
the pandoro but that'll be in a month or

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:27.580 
the pandoro but that'll be in a month or
so<00:07:25.400> because<00:07:25.820> the<00:07:26.390> Pandora<00:07:26.810> isn't<00:07:27.140> shipping<00:07:27.410> it

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:27.590 
so because the Pandora isn't shipping it

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:29.860 
so because the Pandora isn't shipping it
and<00:07:27.980> then<00:07:28.880> I'll<00:07:29.030> have<00:07:29.120> a<00:07:29.180> complete<00:07:29.510> wearable

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:29.870 
and then I'll have a complete wearable

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:32.350 
and then I'll have a complete wearable
computer
