00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
that we had to compose I think I've

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.050

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:19.550 
themes but I also had to make sure that

themes but I also had to make sure that
the<00:01:19.729> score<00:01:20.150> is<00:01:20.450> cohesive<00:01:21.380> enough<00:01:21.890> I<00:01:22.280> took<00:01:22.729> what

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:23.570 
the score is cohesive enough I took what

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:25.330 
the score is cohesive enough I took what
we<00:01:23.780> call<00:01:24.050> the<00:01:24.200> main<00:01:24.350> theme<00:01:24.710> and<00:01:24.979> then<00:01:25.130> I'm

that<00:01:42.649> I<00:01:42.680> previously<00:01:43.039> had<00:01:44.020> attempt<00:01:45.020> music<00:01:45.410> in

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
that I previously had attempt music in

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.219 
that I previously had attempt music in
and<00:01:45.890> a<00:01:46.850> scene<00:01:47.090> would<00:01:47.300> go<00:01:47.450> from<00:01:47.750> being<00:01:47.960> maybe

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
and a scene would go from being maybe

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:52.840 
and a scene would go from being maybe
flat<00:01:48.830> or<00:01:49.160> comic<00:01:49.850> to<00:01:50.840> really<00:01:51.830> engaging<00:01:52.220> me<00:01:52.610> I

think that actually what I really really
enjoyed<00:01:55.820> to<00:01:56.149> work<00:01:56.929> in<00:01:57.080> this<00:01:57.229> game<00:01:57.500> was

exactly<00:02:36.290> what<00:02:36.440> I<00:02:36.470> wrote<00:02:36.560> but<00:02:37.010> then<00:02:37.220> she<00:02:37.459> will

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
exactly what I wrote but then she will

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:47.860 
exactly what I wrote but then she will
make<00:02:37.819> this<00:02:38.000> little<00:02:38.510> change

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.259 

I<00:02:47.900> think<00:02:48.769> it's<00:02:48.950> probably<00:02:49.220> one<00:02:49.550> of<00:02:49.670> Reno's<00:02:49.790> best

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:50.269 
I think it's probably one of Reno's best

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:52.600 
I think it's probably one of Reno's best
schools<00:02:50.569> it's<00:02:51.200> certainly<00:02:51.680> the<00:02:51.800> best<00:02:52.250> score

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
schools it's certainly the best score

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.600 
schools it's certainly the best score
that<00:02:52.790> I<00:02:52.970> flatten<00:02:53.569> it<00:02:53.870> slightly<00:02:53.989> pressie<00:02:54.680> and

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
that I flatten it slightly pressie and

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:59.410
