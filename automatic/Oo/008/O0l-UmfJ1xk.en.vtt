I'm<00:01:19.740> not<00:01:19.979> sure<00:01:20.310> I'm<00:01:20.580> contemplating<00:01:21.240> whether

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
I'm not sure I'm contemplating whether

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.830 
I'm not sure I'm contemplating whether
to<00:01:21.600> do<00:01:21.780> an<00:01:21.930> extra<00:01:22.170> one<00:01:22.320> on<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.500> first<00:01:22.830> fret<00:01:23.840> so

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
to do an extra one on the first fret so

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.749 
to do an extra one on the first fret so
it<00:01:24.960> looks<00:01:25.140> quite<00:01:25.409> even<00:01:25.799> I'm<00:01:26.189> not<00:01:26.460> sure<00:01:26.520> about

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
it looks quite even I'm not sure about

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:31.310 
it looks quite even I'm not sure about
yet<00:01:27.150> saucy<00:01:27.780> and<00:01:29.930> possibility<00:01:30.930> that<00:01:31.049> we<00:01:31.170> might

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
yet saucy and possibility that we might

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.649 
yet saucy and possibility that we might
do<00:01:31.530> some<00:01:31.860> around<00:01:32.579> the<00:01:32.729> headstock<00:01:33.270> as<00:01:33.479> well

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
do some around the headstock as well

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.929 
do some around the headstock as well
some<00:01:34.350> sort<00:01:34.560> of<00:01:34.619> light<00:01:34.829> in<00:01:35.009> there<00:01:35.250> if<00:01:35.520> we<00:01:35.759> can

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
some sort of light in there if we can

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:40.160 
some sort of light in there if we can
afford<00:01:36.630> here<00:01:36.960> and<00:01:38.150> yeah<00:01:39.150> it<00:01:39.540> can<00:01:39.689> be<00:01:39.780> a<00:01:39.930> lot<00:01:40.110> of

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
afford here and yeah it can be a lot of

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.130 
afford here and yeah it can be a lot of
other<00:01:40.290> mods<00:01:41.509> actually<00:01:42.509> going<00:01:42.930> to<00:01:43.049> be

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
other mods actually going to be

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.810 
other mods actually going to be
happening<00:01:43.590> with<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:43.860> body<00:01:44.100> as<00:01:44.250> well<00:01:44.490> think

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
happening with the body as well think

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.330 
happening with the body as well think
probably<00:01:45.290> found<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.439> battery<00:01:46.710> pack<00:01:47.040> for<00:01:47.250> the

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
probably found the battery pack for the

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.270 
probably found the battery pack for the
led<00:01:47.939> frets<00:01:48.390> actually<00:01:49.229> in<00:01:49.290> the<00:01:49.380> pickup<00:01:49.770> socket

led frets actually in the pickup socket

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.280 
led frets actually in the pickup socket
