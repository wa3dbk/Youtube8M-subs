gos is very very unsuccessful so I

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.270 
gos is very very unsuccessful so I

consistency it has like a weird it's a
jelly<00:02:17.959> basically<00:02:18.500> has<00:02:18.650> a<00:02:18.680> jelly<00:02:18.980> consistency

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
jelly basically has a jelly consistency

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:21.550 
jelly basically has a jelly consistency
it's<00:02:20.030> thick<00:02:20.480> but<00:02:20.719> running<00:02:20.959> at<00:02:21.109> the<00:02:21.200> same<00:02:21.319> time

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
it's thick but running at the same time

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.589 
it's thick but running at the same time
if<00:02:21.769> that<00:02:21.920> makes<00:02:22.129> sense<00:02:22.370> um<00:02:23.230> it's<00:02:24.230> really<00:02:24.290> slow

00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:25.599 
if that makes sense um it's really slow

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.550 
or something it's like really ah it was
spilled<00:02:32.480> it<00:02:32.689> let's<00:02:33.379> really<00:02:34.510> go<00:02:35.510> unskilled<00:02:36.379> it

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
spilled it let's really go unskilled it

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.869

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
first but almost the second I applied it

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.530 
first but almost the second I applied it
or<00:02:47.989> a<00:02:48.620> few<00:02:49.129> seconds<00:02:49.430> after<00:02:49.639> I<00:02:49.730> applied<00:02:50.030> it<00:02:50.239> it

very natural botanicals extracts things

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:36.900 
very natural botanicals extracts things
like<00:04:34.960> that<00:04:35.169> but<00:04:35.500> one<00:04:35.770> thing<00:04:36.220> that<00:04:36.430> is<00:04:36.460> severely

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:36.910 
like that but one thing that is severely

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:39.779 
like that but one thing that is severely
lacking<00:04:37.270> is<00:04:37.720> oil<00:04:38.050> and<00:04:38.380> my<00:04:39.099> hair<00:04:39.280> really<00:04:39.550> really

00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:39.789 
lacking is oil and my hair really really

00:04:39.789 --> 00:04:41.219 
lacking is oil and my hair really really
loves<00:04:40.000> oil<00:04:40.330> and<00:04:40.630> I've<00:04:40.750> come<00:04:41.050> to<00:04:41.139> the

00:04:41.219 --> 00:04:41.229 
loves oil and I've come to the

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:45.059 
loves oil and I've come to the
conclusion<00:04:41.259> that<00:04:41.830> I<00:04:42.099> can't<00:04:42.400> use<00:04:43.410> stylers<00:04:44.410> and

00:04:45.059 --> 00:04:45.069 
conclusion that I can't use stylers and

00:04:45.069 --> 00:04:48.330 
conclusion that I can't use stylers and
things<00:04:45.699> like<00:04:45.880> that<00:04:46.500> very<00:04:47.500> frequently<00:04:48.039> or

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:48.340 
things like that very frequently or

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.580 
things like that very frequently or
alone<00:04:48.699> because<00:04:49.240> that<00:04:50.080> don't<00:04:50.289> have<00:04:50.440> oil

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:50.590 
alone because that don't have oil

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:52.560 
alone because that don't have oil
because<00:04:50.979> my<00:04:51.099> hair<00:04:51.280> really<00:04:51.550> really<00:04:51.880> enjoys<00:04:52.539> it

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:52.570 
because my hair really really enjoys it

because my hair really really enjoys it

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:08.320 
very successful and yeah those are the

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:09.930 
very successful and yeah those are the
two<00:05:08.470> main<00:05:08.650> ones<00:05:08.830> that<00:05:09.009> I've<00:05:09.099> used<00:05:09.130> that<00:05:09.550> I

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:09.940 
two main ones that I've used that I

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:11.879 
two main ones that I've used that I
haven't<00:05:10.240> had<00:05:10.300> great<00:05:10.539> results<00:05:10.720> with<00:05:11.110> and<00:05:11.560> the

00:05:11.879 --> 00:05:11.889 
haven't had great results with and the

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:13.439 
haven't had great results with and the
common<00:05:12.250> denominator<00:05:12.370> is<00:05:12.849> that<00:05:13.000> they<00:05:13.180> are

00:05:13.439 --> 00:05:13.449 
common denominator is that they are

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:15.810 
common denominator is that they are
lacking<00:05:13.870> in<00:05:14.199> butters<00:05:14.560> and<00:05:14.830> oils<00:05:15.070> which<00:05:15.639> my

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:15.820 
lacking in butters and oils which my

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:18.540 
lacking in butters and oils which my
hair<00:05:16.060> apparently<00:05:17.020> loves<00:05:17.229> so<00:05:17.949> I'm<00:05:18.190> even<00:05:18.460> though

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:18.550 
hair apparently loves so I'm even though

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:21.260 
hair apparently loves so I'm even though
it<00:05:18.669> gave<00:05:18.789> me<00:05:19.000> really<00:05:19.240> really<00:05:19.539> good<00:05:19.750> definition

00:05:28.399 --> 00:05:28.409 
because it was kind of frizzy this whole

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:32.969 
because it was kind of frizzy this whole
weekend<00:05:29.409> that<00:05:30.039> i<00:05:30.070> used<00:05:30.729> it<00:05:30.970> but<00:05:31.720> it<00:05:32.320> defined<00:05:32.770> my

00:05:32.969 --> 00:05:32.979 
weekend that i used it but it defined my

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:34.680 
weekend that i used it but it defined my
hair<00:05:33.190> really<00:05:33.490> well<00:05:33.820> just<00:05:33.849> left<00:05:34.389> me<00:05:34.509> with<00:05:34.599> a

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:34.690 
hair really well just left me with a

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:38.100 
hair really well just left me with a
really<00:05:35.820> crunchy<00:05:36.820> hole<00:05:37.090> that<00:05:37.479> i<00:05:37.509> still<00:05:37.870> have

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:38.110 
really crunchy hole that i still have

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:39.870 
really crunchy hole that i still have
which<00:05:38.469> is<00:05:38.500> probably<00:05:38.860> what<00:05:39.099> I<00:05:39.159> guess<00:05:39.400> aided<00:05:39.759> in

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:39.880 
which is probably what I guess aided in

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:43.080 
which is probably what I guess aided in
the<00:05:40.650> extra<00:05:41.650> definition<00:05:41.830> is<00:05:42.490> set<00:05:42.699> right<00:05:42.729> here

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:43.090 
the extra definition is set right here

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:44.939 
the extra definition is set right here
still<00:05:43.389> have<00:05:43.539> this<00:05:44.199> part<00:05:44.530> right<00:05:44.590> here<00:05:44.710> is

00:05:44.939 --> 00:05:44.949 
still have this part right here is

00:05:44.949 --> 00:05:48.029 
still have this part right here is
really<00:05:45.310> frizzy<00:05:45.699> and<00:05:46.000> kind<00:05:46.990> of<00:05:47.080> undefined<00:05:47.530> step

00:05:48.029 --> 00:05:48.039 
really frizzy and kind of undefined step

00:05:48.039 --> 00:05:53.399 
really frizzy and kind of undefined step
besides<00:05:49.169> being<00:05:50.169> a<00:05:50.320> braid<00:05:50.620> so<00:05:51.630> yeah<00:05:52.630> that's

still<00:06:10.120> have<00:06:10.300> all<00:06:10.479> my<00:06:10.509> hair<00:06:10.810> pushed<00:06:11.110> forward<00:06:11.650> if

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:11.800 
still have all my hair pushed forward if

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:16.200 
still have all my hair pushed forward if
I<00:06:12.900> wore<00:06:13.900> it<00:06:14.050> like<00:06:14.400> normal<00:06:15.400> it<00:06:15.759> just<00:06:15.969> looked

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:16.210 
I wore it like normal it just looked

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:18.149 
I wore it like normal it just looked
kind<00:06:16.389> of<00:06:16.479> a<00:06:16.659> little<00:06:17.020> more<00:06:17.199> deflated<00:06:17.710> and<00:06:18.039> than

00:06:18.149 --> 00:06:18.159 
kind of a little more deflated and than

00:06:18.159 --> 00:06:20.040 
kind of a little more deflated and than
normal<00:06:18.610> so<00:06:19.210> yeah<00:06:19.360> you<00:06:19.419> can<00:06:19.630> definitely<00:06:19.719> see

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:20.050 
normal so yeah you can definitely see

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:22.800 
normal so yeah you can definitely see
the<00:06:20.080> frizzy<00:06:20.530> parts<00:06:20.800> right<00:06:20.919> here<00:06:20.979> so<00:06:21.460> I<00:06:21.699> guess<00:06:22.690> I

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:22.810 
the frizzy parts right here so I guess I

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:24.810 
the frizzy parts right here so I guess I
didn't<00:06:23.020> add<00:06:23.169> enough<00:06:23.199> I<00:06:23.710> don't<00:06:23.889> know<00:06:24.009> but<00:06:24.520> in<00:06:24.729> a

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:24.820 
didn't add enough I don't know but in a

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:27.120 
didn't add enough I don't know but in a
way<00:06:25.060> I'm<00:06:25.330> it<00:06:25.599> left<00:06:25.780> it<00:06:25.900> pretty<00:06:26.110> free<00:06:26.469> pretty

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:27.130
