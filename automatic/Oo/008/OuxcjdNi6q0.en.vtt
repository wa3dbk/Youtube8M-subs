00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.850
 hello friends here at the 99 palm and today 

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:14.410
 we are in the new tutorial in this 

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:17.770
 tutorial i will explain how to dedicate 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:21.010
 hands sleeve memory so sp that is 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:21.880
 the one cracked and premium that is the one a 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:25.779
 payment 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.650
 let's start to dedicate sleeve reminders 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:27.730
 they will not be there 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:29.890
 there will be no need for many 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.710
 procedures will be enough to go on yours 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:35.890
 profile and certain and the prof the via brera 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:38.680
 I remind you that this window 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:41.380
 procedure is for prizes even if then 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:43.060
 sp doesn't change much 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:47.260
 after this window is open 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:49.120
 you have to check this and this one 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:52.780
 string here you have to choose the number 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:55.870
 of ram to dedicate to minecraft in this 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:01:00.150
 case increase 2000 not gb which are too many 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:03.460
 2,000 megs which are enough for me and are advancing 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:04.059
 then you can choose based on 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.220
 your ram 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:08.979
 after doing this, just crush 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:11.679
 six profiles and you're done 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:14.200
 now let's move on to the open- ended Manichaean sp 

00:01:11.679 --> 00:01:15.520
 sp the procedure will be the same 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.009
 the only flaw will be that you can't 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.380
 increase memory more as 

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:22.829
 you want you always have to crush and 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:26.170
 prof my opinion this other window 

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:29.020
 in this window where to check them off either 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:33.520
 this is what you leave here 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:36.850
 as and in this string remove the w 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.979
 ate had 6 of your own now you'll have more 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.799
 memory in your sleeve 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:45.460
 let's try as you can see if 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:47.109
 crush f3 in the upper right corner e 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:50.049
 will operate a higher number than that 

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:54.100
 It usually in this case to me is 

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:57.639
 came 1987 because I put 2,000 megs 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.810
 of ram served already served sign up or 

00:01:57.639 --> 00:02:00.009
