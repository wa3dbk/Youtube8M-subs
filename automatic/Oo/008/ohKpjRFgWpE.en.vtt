our<00:01:00.120> philosophy<00:01:00.719> has<00:01:00.780> been<00:01:00.840> to<00:01:01.230> keep<00:01:01.410> the

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:01.910 
our philosophy has been to keep the

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.880 
our philosophy has been to keep the
manufacturing<00:01:02.910> here<00:01:03.270> it<00:01:03.660> gives<00:01:03.840> us<00:01:04.110> the

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
manufacturing here it gives us the

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.399 
manufacturing here it gives us the
ability<00:01:05.070> to<00:01:05.280> control<00:01:05.670> our<00:01:06.000> throughput<00:01:06.330> if<00:01:07.229> we

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
ability to control our throughput if we

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:08.840 
ability to control our throughput if we
have<00:01:07.619> prototype<00:01:08.159> designs<00:01:08.549> that<00:01:08.700> we're

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
have prototype designs that we're

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.219 
have prototype designs that we're
working<00:01:09.150> on<00:01:09.299> or<00:01:09.420> if<00:01:09.479> we've<00:01:09.600> got<00:01:09.750> a<00:01:09.780> special

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
working on or if we've got a special

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.750 
working on or if we've got a special
order<00:01:10.409> that's<00:01:10.740> kind<00:01:11.189> of<00:01:11.250> out<00:01:11.369> of<00:01:11.490> sequence

order that's kind of out of sequence

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.910 
order that's kind of out of sequence
with<00:01:12.000> our<00:01:12.119> manufacturing<00:01:12.750> process<00:01:13.229> it<00:01:13.710> allows

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
with our manufacturing process it allows

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.060 
with our manufacturing process it allows
us<00:01:14.130> to<00:01:14.280> respond<00:01:14.670> rapidly<00:01:15.630> and<00:01:16.200> without<00:01:16.770> a<00:01:16.799> lot

us to respond rapidly and without a lot
of<00:01:17.100> added<00:01:17.759> cost<00:01:18.000> when<00:01:18.330> that's<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:18.810> case<00:01:18.900> we<00:01:19.400> do

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
of added cost when that's the case we do

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.700 
of added cost when that's the case we do

that<00:01:31.140> we<00:01:31.229> do<00:01:31.350> even<00:01:31.650> on<00:01:31.799> those<00:01:32.579> components

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
that we do even on those components

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.780 
that we do even on those components
we've<00:01:34.200> got<00:01:34.409> three<00:01:34.920> turning<00:01:35.280> centers<00:01:35.610> we've

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
we've got three turning centers we've

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.090 
we've got three turning centers we've
got<00:01:35.880> to<00:01:36.060> milling<00:01:36.390> centers<00:01:36.720> here<00:01:36.990> and<00:01:37.229> it

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
got to milling centers here and it

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.590 
got to milling centers here and it
really<00:01:38.280> gives<00:01:38.490> us<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.670> flexibility<00:01:39.299> we<00:01:39.420> need

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
really gives us the flexibility we need

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.560 
really gives us the flexibility we need
for<00:01:39.840> all<00:01:40.409> of<00:01:40.590> our<00:01:40.710> components<00:01:41.270> I've<00:01:42.270> done<00:01:42.450> the

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
for all of our components I've done the

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.450 
for all of our components I've done the
fact<00:01:42.780> that<00:01:42.930> we<00:01:43.439> do<00:01:43.560> our<00:01:43.680> own<00:01:43.799> casting<00:01:44.250> here<00:01:44.369> we

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
fact that we do our own casting here we

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.100 
fact that we do our own casting here we
do<00:01:44.549> a<00:01:44.579> very<00:01:44.729> specific<00:01:45.299> type<00:01:45.450> of<00:01:45.479> casting<00:01:45.990> it's

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
do a very specific type of casting it's

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.139 
do a very specific type of casting it's
called<00:01:46.259> centripetal<00:01:46.649> casting<00:01:47.340> so<00:01:47.850> this<00:01:48.000> is

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
called centripetal casting so this is

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.819 
called centripetal casting so this is
actually<00:01:48.570> made<00:01:48.780> in<00:01:48.930> a<00:01:49.020> spinning<00:01:49.259> mold<00:01:49.560> we're

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
actually made in a spinning mold we're

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.230 
actually made in a spinning mold we're
pouring<00:01:50.100> hot<00:01:50.250> aluminum<00:01:50.700> into<00:01:50.909> a<00:01:50.939> spinning

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
pouring hot aluminum into a spinning

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.940 
pouring hot aluminum into a spinning
mold<00:01:51.509> that<00:01:52.049> gives<00:01:52.290> us<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:52.590> ability<00:01:52.920> to

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
mold that gives us the ability to

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.060 
mold that gives us the ability to
control<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:54.090> porosity<00:01:54.240> and<00:01:54.899> the<00:01:55.079> material

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
control the porosity and the material

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.859 
control the porosity and the material
properties<00:01:56.549> in<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:56.880> finished<00:01:57.180> product<00:01:57.390> it

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
properties in the finished product it

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.139 
properties in the finished product it
gives<00:01:58.049> us<00:01:58.200> an<00:01:58.350> excellent<00:01:58.649> end<00:01:59.310> result<00:01:59.969> and

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
gives us an excellent end result and

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.179 
gives us an excellent end result and
then<00:02:00.540> we<00:02:00.750> do<00:02:00.930> depending<00:02:01.320> on<00:02:01.439> the<00:02:01.560> type<00:02:02.159> of

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
then we do depending on the type of

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.429 
then we do depending on the type of
wheel<00:02:02.490> up<00:02:02.880> to<00:02:03.149> about<00:02:03.390> 70<00:02:03.780> percent<00:02:03.960> of<00:02:04.170> it<00:02:04.320> will

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
wheel up to about 70 percent of it will

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.709 
wheel up to about 70 percent of it will
be<00:02:04.560> machined<00:02:04.979> off<00:02:05.159> of<00:02:05.310> this<00:02:05.369> casting<00:02:05.880> but<00:02:06.479> it
