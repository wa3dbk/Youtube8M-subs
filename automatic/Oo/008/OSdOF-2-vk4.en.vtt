00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.689
 project stalker 2 and company was closed 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.970
 gsc game world 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:30.359
 she was closed by the chief director of the game 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.910

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.090
 today gsc game world 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.530
 started again and it is open 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.930
 I give you the answers 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:46.070
 manager of the company dj s game world 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.070
 vitaliya latysheva 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:57.500
 Jesse's game world and creator 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:59.900
 cult game series stalker and cossacks 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.240
 reopened 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.950
 reason to close and the studio served as a whole 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.000
 a combination of problems is not only 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:06.620
 financial difficulties 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.720
 but also the executive's personal decision 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:11.270
 directors then stalker 2 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.910
 was in the middle of working out but we 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:16.490
 began to realize that we were far beyond 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:19.430
 game completion at that quality level 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:22.690
 on which she was supposed to be with us 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:26.150
 teams lacked narrow specialists 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:28.520
 stalker clear sky and stalker call 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:31.090
 Pripyat were more addons than 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.800
 by independent games they are completely 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:37.390
 remained on the stalker shadow of Chernobyl 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:39.710
 we understood that stalker 2 is another project 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:42.520
 it would take to complete 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:46.460
 too much time and by that moment 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:48.040
 his release, the game would be outdated and we 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.150
 there were scenarios 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:52.250
 or rather, we had a complete script 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:55.160
 written by the author of the original script 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.270
 games but this is just a script 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.640
 not a full game 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:02.410
 we are more likely to start developing 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:04.760
 second part than to its end 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:07.100
 the decision was given 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:09.760
 difficult as the team approached the 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:12.230
 release a full-scale game but the team 

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:14.800
 executive director and understood that 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:18.580
 the game will not work so well 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:22.160
 how good should be 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:23.090
 stalker 2 game we ran into a problem 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.370
 in search of funds 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:29.150
 tried to draw attention to the game to us 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:32.360
 offered funding when we already 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:35.720
 were in alpha testing at 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:38.060
 in fact we could pro finance 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:41.600
 all the development itself but were not 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.020
 sure that we can sell the game so 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.460
 way 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:46.790
 There were many difficulties that 

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:49.040
 led to the decision to roll back the development we 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:52.480
 never going to close forever 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:55.130
 but at the time there were some obvious 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.680
 obstacles that we could not 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:03:01.340
 to overcome 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:04.700
 maybe we needed more leaders in 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:08.330
 the team yet we developed several 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:10.340
 location levels in multiple zones 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.590
 characters new engine brand new 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.239
 engine written from scratch which is still in 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:16.019
 that time was already a new engine 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:20.560
 generations 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:27.220
 x3 engine ahead of its time 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:29.140
 it was in 2007 they appeared 2010 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:31.019
 new call of duty engines and 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:34.659
 battlefield so we needed 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:37.989
 He was able to improve and 70 

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:41.500
 80 percent ready it was a big move 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:46.000
 ahead of x rain the engine was 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:49.480
 focused on so far and reset in x-box 360 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:53.349

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:56.769
 playstation all this is preserved with us 

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:59.739
 We have all the materials and all rabotki 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:02.319

 development is in full swing 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:13.750
