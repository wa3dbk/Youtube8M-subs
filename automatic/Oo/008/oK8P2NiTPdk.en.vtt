00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.910
 hello welcome back to another video 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:16.420
 recipe well and the kitchen we are going to do 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:18.369
 a very fresh summer recipe and 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:20.980
 very original is about the gazpacho 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:22.960
 cherries set washes for super 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.290
 pepas and for the ojera and everything 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.290
 accomplished 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.029
 and the last 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:43.330
 now we are going to teach a very 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:45.400
 Simple and quick to kiss cherries alone 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:46.980
 we are going to need a bottle and a 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.680
 straw 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.110
 we put a cherry in the mouth of the 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:55.379
 bottle and with a straw we are going to 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.579
 press until the bone comes out 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:01.629
 Bottle background 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:03.879
 the bone falls down and the cherry is left 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:06.740
 totally hollow 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:09.229
 so we save a lot of time 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:12.020
 because if we do not have to go cutting 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:14.030
 a wick will sing is the bone so let's go 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.130
 putting in the straw or cane as you 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:19.640
 you call and we're removing all the 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:22.610
 bones up to weigh 200 grams of 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:25.520
 cherry pitting let's take advantage 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:28.850
 although we have the previous day and we're going 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:31.460
 to take out 100 grams of bread crumbs 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:34.250
 tomatoes we wash them we remove the stem 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:37.250
 and now we are going to split it into pieces 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:40.369
 medium for later that is not easier 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:44.030
 crush everything in the blender and 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:45.619
 we are putting everything in a bowl in a bowl 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:49.630
 big because first we're going to leave it 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:49.630
 all macerate before crushing 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:56.660
 we do the same with the slice of pepper 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:02:00.110
 red and the 300 of green pepper well in 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:03.260
 medium onion pieces and start 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:06.150
 well in big helmets and we miss everything 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:09.420
 to our bowl 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:11.730
 finally we are going to cut half a tooth 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:14.569
 of garlic and we will remove the germ for 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:17.120
 that then we do not repeat 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:19.280
 well let's also look at the bread 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.159
 In case you're interested I'm using a 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.200
 bread pays that is great and also 

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:26.480
 let's add the 100 milliliters of 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.030
 extra virgin olive oil is a 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.010
 wonder though that and you then 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.139
 you are seeing it according to the taste that you 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.930
 like for example I have also done 

00:02:33.139 --> 00:02:38.540
 three tablespoons of vinegar 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.329
 Sherry but it also depends on your 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:43.849
 taste if you like more or less the vinegar 

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:46.130
 I also add two teaspoons of salt 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:49.130
 all this you are watching 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:52.670
 Now we are going to remove everything very well for 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:56.300
 integrate the flavors we have it ready now 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:58.140
 we have everything mixed except the cherry 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:01.020
 why 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:03.360
 here the great chef martín berasátegui us 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:05.760
 recommends leaving this mixture to macerate 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.770
 is the basis of any office so 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.600
 less about eight hours that is not only 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:11.040
 we do it at night we leave everything 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:15.150
 it's much more closing and the morning 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:17.070
 next we would add the cherry and 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.230
 we already shred what to do to make 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:22.500
 any gazpacho because if we add it 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:24.030
 the cherries now the vinegar and the salt is 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.510
 too aggressive and then 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:31.440
 we would lose a lot the taste of cherry 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:34.400
 let's put the film and leave it all 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.400
 night and the creates 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:44.079
 we have left all night 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:48.420
 the tomato the pepper a stroke and now 

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:48.420
 we are going to add it to the blender jar 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:57.690
 we are going to do it little by little 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.690
 it does not fit anymore 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:13.240
 i 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:28.270
 OK 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:31.390
 already depending on the texture that you 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:34.270
 Like we can add a little bit of 

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:37.660
 water if you think the gazpacho is too thick 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:40.120
 and you want to lighten it you can add 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:43.630
 some water 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:47.080
 and we continue beating the moment of 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:49.949
 try it to see if you need more to the sea 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:49.949
 Mine whatever 

00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:58.949
 if I'm going to pour a little more vinegar 

00:04:55.259 --> 00:05:01.019
 a little salt and this is to taste if 

00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:03.539
 you want a little more oil like 

00:05:01.019 --> 00:05:05.819
 sweetest and finally we will pass 

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:07.829
 by a Chinese colander or a pass through it 

00:05:05.819 --> 00:05:11.099
 to remove all the skin of the pepper 

00:05:07.829 --> 00:05:14.999
 and the tomato and that's going to be a 

00:05:11.099 --> 00:05:17.219
 totally smooth and super texture 

00:05:14.999 --> 00:05:21.479
 nice do not say you do not have a 

00:05:17.219 --> 00:05:23.579
 paint this gazpacho and we put a 

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:26.099
 trickle of olive oil and a couple of 

00:05:23.579 --> 00:05:29.119
 cherries to decorate do not say that it's not going 

00:05:26.099 --> 00:05:29.119
 to look super nice 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:35.570
 If you liked this recipe do not forget 

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:37.760
 I like it and share it with 

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:40.310

 Millán Che for Ice
