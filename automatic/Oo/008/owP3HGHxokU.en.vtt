00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
and I used my on-camera flash to

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.180 
and I used my on-camera flash to
optically<00:00:42.719> trigger<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.230> speed<00:00:43.469> lights<00:00:43.680> just

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
optically trigger the speed lights just

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.310 
optically trigger the speed lights just
like<00:00:44.340> I<00:00:44.370> would<00:00:44.610> my<00:00:44.760> strobes<00:00:45.120> and<00:00:45.480> you<00:00:46.170> can

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
like I would my strobes and you can

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.650 
like I would my strobes and you can
either<00:00:46.469> use<00:00:46.620> a<00:00:46.860> pop-up<00:00:47.309> flash<00:00:47.489> or<00:00:48.149> if<00:00:48.539> you

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
either use a pop-up flash or if you

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.360 
either use a pop-up flash or if you
don't<00:00:48.809> have<00:00:48.960> one<00:00:49.200> like<00:00:49.410> on<00:00:49.559> my<00:00:49.710> d2x

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
don't have one like on my d2x

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.500 
don't have one like on my d2x
that's<00:00:50.640> where<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:50.879> third<00:00:51.059> scheme<00:00:51.329> light

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
that's where the third scheme light

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.580 
that's where the third scheme light
comes<00:00:51.750> in<00:00:51.930> I<00:00:52.940> use<00:00:53.940> su4<00:00:54.750> mode<00:00:54.960> on<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.350> speed

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
comes in I use su4 mode on the speed

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.500 
comes in I use su4 mode on the speed
lights<00:00:55.800> some<00:00:56.399> people<00:00:56.670> use<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:57.120> Nikon

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
lights some people use the Nikon

lights some people use the Nikon
creative<00:00:58.140> lighting<00:00:58.289> system<00:00:58.800> I've<00:00:59.280> had

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
creative lighting system I've had

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.270 
creative lighting system I've had
inconsistent<00:01:00.210> results<00:01:00.600> with<00:01:00.750> it<00:01:00.930> because<00:01:01.530> su4

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
inconsistent results with it because su4

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.189 
inconsistent results with it because su4
mode<00:01:02.430> is<00:01:02.550> so<00:01:02.699> easy<00:01:02.850> to<00:01:02.940> use<00:01:03.239> I've<00:01:03.719> stuck<00:01:03.930> to<00:01:04.080> it

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
mode is so easy to use I've stuck to it

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.219 
mode is so easy to use I've stuck to it
only<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.430> outside<00:01:05.549> of<00:01:05.939> su4<00:01:06.479> mode<00:01:06.689> or<00:01:06.869> any

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
only the outside of su4 mode or any

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.990 
only the outside of su4 mode or any
optical<00:01:07.619> trigger<00:01:07.979> really<00:01:08.340> is<00:01:08.580> if<00:01:08.880> you're

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
optical trigger really is if you're

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.670 
optical trigger really is if you're
working<00:01:09.180> around<00:01:09.479> other<00:01:09.570> photographers<00:01:10.229> their

working around other photographers their

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.640 
working around other photographers their
strokes<00:01:11.040> will<00:01:11.340> trigger<00:01:11.520> yours<00:01:12.560> speaking<00:01:13.560> of

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
strokes will trigger yours speaking of

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.200 
strokes will trigger yours speaking of
triggering<00:01:13.950> that<00:01:14.159> you'll<00:01:14.610> trigger<00:01:14.909> these

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
triggering that you'll trigger these

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.929 
triggering that you'll trigger these
with<00:01:15.780> your<00:01:16.020> on-camera<00:01:16.590> flash<00:01:16.740> set<00:01:17.520> to<00:01:17.729> manual

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
with your on-camera flash set to manual

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.210 
with your on-camera flash set to manual
at<00:01:18.509> a<00:01:18.570> pretty<00:01:18.990> low<00:01:19.020> power<00:01:19.380> so<00:01:19.770> that<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.009> flash

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
at a pretty low power so that the flash

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.700 
at a pretty low power so that the flash
does<00:01:20.460> it<00:01:20.580> do<00:01:20.700> it's<00:01:20.930> multiple<00:01:21.930> metering<00:01:22.409> flash

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
does it do it's multiple metering flash

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.350 
does it do it's multiple metering flash
and<00:01:23.189> mess<00:01:23.520> everything<00:01:23.790> up

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
and mess everything up

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.340 
and mess everything up
so<00:01:25.080> let's<00:01:25.590> take<00:01:25.770> a<00:01:25.799> look<00:01:25.950> at<00:01:26.130> how<00:01:26.250> to<00:01:26.310> set<00:01:26.640> an<00:01:26.759> SP

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350

I say lean be strokes here's why number

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:29.150 
I say lean be strokes here's why number
one<00:03:27.390> reason<00:03:27.840> why<00:03:28.020> I<00:03:28.050> would<00:03:28.230> use<00:03:28.410> these<00:03:28.650> in<00:03:28.980> lieu
