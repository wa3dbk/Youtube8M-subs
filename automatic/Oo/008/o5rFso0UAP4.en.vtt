going to divide it up into pieces ready
for<00:01:26.939> rolling<00:01:27.119> now<00:01:27.929> i'm<00:01:28.020> going<00:01:28.170> to<00:01:28.229> divide<00:01:28.380> this

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
for rolling now i'm going to divide this

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.139 
for rolling now i'm going to divide this
into<00:01:28.830> about<00:01:29.460> 16<00:01:30.210> pieces<00:01:30.509> today<00:01:32.149> obviously

00:01:33.139 --> 00:01:33.149 
into about 16 pieces today obviously

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:35.090 
into about 16 pieces today obviously
that's<00:01:33.689> going<00:01:33.869> to<00:01:33.960> vary<00:01:33.990> depending<00:01:34.829> on

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
that's going to vary depending on

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.380 
that's going to vary depending on

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.840 
thin what will see happening as it cooks
as<00:03:12.360> it'll<00:03:12.990> form<00:03:13.320> just<00:03:13.590> slight<00:03:14.040> little<00:03:14.340> bubbles

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
as it'll form just slight little bubbles

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:16.699 
as it'll form just slight little bubbles
where<00:03:15.209> the<00:03:15.360> surface<00:03:15.840> of<00:03:16.050> the<00:03:16.290> dough<00:03:16.500> will

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
where the surface of the dough will

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:19.250 
where the surface of the dough will
start<00:03:17.130> to<00:03:17.430> rheank<00:03:18.120> little<00:03:18.510> but<00:03:18.750> it's<00:03:18.900> a<00:03:19.020> little

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
start to rheank little but it's a little

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.520 
start to rheank little but it's a little
hard<00:03:19.530> to<00:03:19.709> see<00:03:19.950> here<00:03:20.250> but<00:03:20.870> that<00:03:21.870> tells<00:03:22.170> you<00:03:22.350> that

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
hard to see here but that tells you that

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.130 
hard to see here but that tells you that
it's<00:03:22.980> cooked<00:03:23.310> and<00:03:23.580> it's<00:03:23.700> time<00:03:23.940> to<00:03:23.970> flip<00:03:24.930> it

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
it's cooked and it's time to flip it

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.560 
it's cooked and it's time to flip it
over<00:03:25.290> so<00:03:25.709> we're<00:03:26.370> just<00:03:26.400> about<00:03:26.730> there<00:03:26.910> now<00:03:27.180> we'll

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570 
over so we're just about there now we'll

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:29.180 
over so we're just about there now we'll
just<00:03:27.600> give<00:03:27.900> it<00:03:28.020> a<00:03:28.080> couple<00:03:28.200> more<00:03:28.500> seconds<00:03:28.920> and

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
just give it a couple more seconds and

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.640 
just give it a couple more seconds and
now<00:03:29.239> I'm<00:03:30.239> flipping<00:03:30.959> it<00:03:31.080> using<00:03:31.380> just<00:03:31.590> my

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
now I'm flipping it using just my

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.890 
now I'm flipping it using just my
fingers<00:03:32.220> but<00:03:32.520> you<00:03:33.330> might<00:03:33.510> want<00:03:33.660> to<00:03:33.780> use<00:03:33.840> a

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
fingers but you might want to use a

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.780 
fingers but you might want to use a
spatula<00:03:34.170> it's<00:03:35.010> reasonably<00:03:35.370> easy<00:03:35.550> to<00:03:35.700> work

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790

with<00:03:35.850> that<00:03:36.270> flip<00:03:37.050> it<00:03:37.200> over<00:03:37.320> you<00:03:37.620> know<00:03:37.770> it's

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
with that flip it over you know it's

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:39.949 
with that flip it over you know it's
done<00:03:38.160> when<00:03:38.190> you<00:03:38.430> can<00:03:38.580> see<00:03:38.820> just<00:03:39.030> a<00:03:39.570> little<00:03:39.810> bit

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
done when you can see just a little bit

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:42.680 
done when you can see just a little bit
of<00:03:40.080> this<00:03:40.440> light<00:03:40.830> brown<00:03:41.250> on<00:03:41.610> the<00:03:42.239> other<00:03:42.360> side
