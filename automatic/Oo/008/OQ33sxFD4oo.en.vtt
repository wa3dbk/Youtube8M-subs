 help in cell regeneration with milk 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:58.420
 of oats the finger soluble fibers

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:15.810
 circulation against atherosclerosis 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:18.269
 then using if I want to replace the 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:20.100
 cow's milk for vegetable milk is 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:24.060
 all right 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:27.000
 it was not if you were the reason 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:29.880
 chose to eliminate lactose from its 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.710
 diet will need to complement in its 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:34.290
 food to ingest the nutrients 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:35.640
 which are present in cow's milk that 

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:38.610
 are essential for the smooth operation 

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:41.430
 of your body, for example milk from 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:43.320
 cow is naturally rich in calcium 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:46.860
 already the vegetable milks this nutrient 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:49.800
 needs to be additional but in this case the 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:51.990
 absorption is not always as good as the 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:54.870
 of calcium present in cow's milk 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:57.780
 My recommendation is that you seek 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:59.910
 nutritional guidance to complement 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:03.840
 your diet so that the body does not 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:06.240
 have no nutrient deficiency 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:08.100
 another very important issue though 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:10.020
 rich in nutrients 

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:12.240
 vegetable milks should not be 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:15.810
 used as a substitute for milk 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:18.690
 mother's milk continues to be 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:20.490
 the most complete food for the baby and 

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:22.980
 if necessary replace it with 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:25.080
 any reason talk to your pediatrician 

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:27.600
 and also with your nutritionist at 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:29.970
 market we find several brands of 

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:31.800
 digital milk of good origin but 

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:32.760
 some people choose to do them in 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:35.250
 House 

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:38.820
 If this is your case take some 

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:42.030
 Grandma always wash the 

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:44.490
 seeds and grains do not leave milk in the 

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:47.910
 ideal for long time is that 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:50.040
 you consume in three days at the most 

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:53.010
 you can also use the remains for 

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:55.410
 complete other recipes and aquariums and 

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:58.380
 always thinner sieves 

00:05:55.410 --> 00:06:00.419
 all vegetable milk can be taken pure 

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:03.030
 In addition, vegetable 

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:05.720
 They rely a lot of time and fruit 

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:10.169
 That's why people are what I always say. 

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:12.990
 courage because it comes to being well posted the 

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:15.140
