00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.299
 hello everyone with you flicker oh well 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:17.320
 let's get started to start building 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:20.020
 such a basis 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:22.180
 leave a pause and build when 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:24.370
 build and notice here she is 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:29.080
 built my from birch boards and from 

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:32.739
 we take oak steps further and set 3 months 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:35.289
 2 blocks up so as if well that is 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:38.920
 that's how where where where like on that house I 

00:00:35.289 --> 00:00:41.950
 built three blocks of oak further put where 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:46.360
 you take to the boards make m birch 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:48.040
 boards here also force on our 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.620
 steps we put the glass panel and 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.450
 from above we make from birch steps 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:56.940
 such a thing is not hard guys build 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:59.230
 Well, that is, we do it all around the house 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.540
 when we do it we take birch 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:04.620
 cock and force additive around the house 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:04.620
 do obdochku 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.590
 when drank we make the second layer of winding 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:33.869
 further we make the third layer only possible 

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:38.130
 live leave birch boards further 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:40.439
 take birch pancake boards and put 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.469
 somewhere people we want to do well 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:45.060
 type of roof balcony tab 2 floor well 

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:51.810
 let 's start from here 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:55.140
 from here so here so here so here 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:57.659
 we will have a roof set before 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.729
 glass panel so starting from the second 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.890
 block well yes so you get tired here 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.619
 glass moment here glass 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:07.110
 the tunnel here is glass panels and everything 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:11.160
 glass oil and here is one glass 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:13.799
 as far as we take an oak leave it 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.829
 somehow that balance we watched 

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:18.750
 exactly up all the time well i mean this one 

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:22.769
 who there vodka 2 blocks up it 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:25.500
 put in all directions well whom so 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:27.720
 will come such here still need to deliver 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:31.590
 him here and here you need him too 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:35.849
 put so here to ready here too 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:39.060
 put the oak on 2 blocks of the top and what 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:41.849
 so I â€™m probably missing something 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:45.950
 you put further take the steps and 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:45.950
 draw around all windows 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:52.200
 when we did it 

00:02:49.139 --> 00:02:53.480
 we take birch steps and set 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.909
 them on the glass 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:59.879
 Well, that is, not on the glass itself, but here 

00:02:56.909 --> 00:03:04.560
 long ago so we connect everything here we 

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:07.500
 we seal up with birch boards and further 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:10.439
 next layer of winding will do here 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:13.439
 we do we do we do not 

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:14.069
 we need to do using these layers 

00:03:13.439 --> 00:03:16.530
 windings 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:18.689
 the whole roof so she was some 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:21.349
 form of minutes so here we can do 

00:03:18.689 --> 00:03:25.260
 all of these of simple blocks 

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:28.019
 stark stax all done then next 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.760
 layer slab and so on well i mean by 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:35.010
 completely get the roof here is the result 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:36.840
 there was no will here is the will all ready 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:39.930
 can we get so cool 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.790
 the house was not experimenting there 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:44.370
 live finish shortcomings there 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:48.959
 turned out beautifully and shoot so 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:52.379
 here and I put one block to her like this 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:54.299
 that's what we have so that here 

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:56.609
 there was no glass i was behind gorazhde but in 

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:59.000
 large layers of the roof we upper will 

00:03:56.609 --> 00:03:59.000
 to rule 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:06.200
 It turns out a beautiful house quality 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:07.310
 me here we can raise one so 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:10.189
 I'll clean now 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:12.709
 rain as I do not know you too 

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:15.940
 guys some mood which is not 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:19.039
 so when it rains, I personally kind 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:22.250
 I will enter the game through threats okay hell 

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:23.990
 with him so here we close up to us 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:24.680
 the roof is generally so pretty 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:26.449
 dear 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:29.919
 on the other side here we are now too 

00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:34.630
 for doing everything inside these completely too 

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:38.990
 close up here too need to close up everything 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:39.470
 seems to be ready and what we get 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:42.110
 here 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:43.820
 beautiful building here we throw 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:47.870
 simple in block 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:50.090
 but it was like as we all continue to 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:53.919
 you need to make 9 entrance to be here 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:57.560
 ladder so now from the present blocks 

00:04:53.919 --> 00:05:00.380
 something like this so no no here and so 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:03.470
 let's make an input so that he was 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:06.310
 the dispute is so here ahead so come yes 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:06.310
 we put steps 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:13.030
 here is the entrance of course the ceiling is not very 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:15.400
 so let's do here a little bit 

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:18.820
 lower then I really don't really like 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:21.040
 it turned out so we put the ceiling here 

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:23.050
 your ceiling is a floor that is to say love 

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:27.280
 wrong with diana doing here here 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:29.770
 such a pony is a little ready here for the city 

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:32.320
 it turns out we are beautiful but yes in general 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:34.990
 almost to here language will be bedroom further 

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:37.120
 let's make elvis desirable 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:37.660

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:41.760
 boards to read landing 

00:05:58.449 --> 00:06:03.050

 see what we have here I have it 

00:06:46.249 --> 00:06:49.519
 I will not decorate because I have 

00:06:47.659 --> 00:06:52.039

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:12.889
 anderson 

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:15.139
 because of the cloud chara there will be a descent 

00:07:12.889 --> 00:07:17.300
 mine but since i'm in a flat world and 

00:07:15.139 --> 00:07:18.630
 there are no mines here only with 

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:21.960
 limb 

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:23.580
