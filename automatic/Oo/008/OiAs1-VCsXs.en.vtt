you need the wind the weather conditions
to<00:00:31.109> be<00:00:31.590> able<00:00:31.650> to<00:00:31.740> pick<00:00:31.980> up<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.219> sand<00:00:32.489> to<00:00:32.730> move

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
to be able to pick up the sand to move

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.930 
to be able to pick up the sand to move
it<00:00:33.180> and<00:00:33.390> to<00:00:33.540> deposit<00:00:33.840> it<00:00:34.460> and<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:35.640> way<00:00:35.760> that

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
it and to deposit it and the way that

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.639 
it and to deposit it and the way that
the<00:00:36.030> sand<00:00:36.270> is<00:00:36.420> moved<00:00:36.660> by<00:00:36.809> it<00:00:36.960> is<00:00:37.110> by<00:00:37.260> three

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
the sand is moved by it is by three

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.150 
the sand is moved by it is by three
different<00:00:38.010> methods<00:00:38.899> mechanisms<00:00:39.950> first<00:00:40.950> one

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
different methods mechanisms first one

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.619 
different methods mechanisms first one
is<00:00:41.309> if<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:41.670> wind<00:00:41.850> is<00:00:41.940> strong<00:00:42.210> enough<00:00:42.390> you<00:00:42.510> can

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
is if the wind is strong enough you can

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.060 
is if the wind is strong enough you can
actually<00:00:42.750> pick<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.170> sand<00:00:43.410> up<00:00:43.559> and<00:00:43.739> blow<00:00:43.950> it

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
actually pick the sand up and blow it

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.190 
actually pick the sand up and blow it
along<00:00:44.340> in<00:00:44.579> suspension<00:00:45.450> that<00:00:45.870> we<00:00:46.020> call

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
along in suspension that we call

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.170 
along in suspension that we call
suspended<00:00:46.680> transport

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
suspended transport

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.760 
suspended transport
however<00:00:48.870> if<00:00:48.990> the<00:00:49.080> wind<00:00:49.260> isn't<00:00:49.530> strong<00:00:49.740> enough

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
however if the wind isn't strong enough

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.790 
however if the wind isn't strong enough
to<00:00:50.040> keep<00:00:50.640> it<00:00:50.790> in<00:00:50.880> suspension<00:00:51.480> then<00:00:52.140> it<00:00:52.500> may<00:00:52.740> be

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
to keep it in suspension then it may be

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.100 
to keep it in suspension then it may be
able<00:00:53.010> to<00:00:53.250> get<00:00:53.700> the<00:00:53.850> grains<00:00:54.330> to<00:00:54.510> hop<00:00:54.810> up<00:00:54.930> into

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
able to get the grains to hop up into

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.530 
able to get the grains to hop up into
the<00:00:55.290> air<00:00:55.550> and<00:00:56.550> then<00:00:56.880> to<00:00:57.000> bounce<00:00:57.240> on<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.510> ground

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:57.540 
the air and then to bounce on the ground

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:59.360 
the air and then to bounce on the ground
again<00:00:58.020> and<00:00:58.170> they<00:00:58.230> might<00:00:58.410> pop<00:00:58.620> up<00:00:58.650> again<00:00:58.890> in<00:00:59.280> a

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
again and they might pop up again in a

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.940 
again and they might pop up again in a
sort<00:00:59.550> of<00:00:59.580> a<00:00:59.700> leapfrog<00:01:00.240> sort<00:01:00.750> of<00:01:00.810> motion<00:01:01.020> across

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:01.950 
sort of a leapfrog sort of motion across

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:04.160 
sort of a leapfrog sort of motion across
the<00:01:02.100> beach<00:01:02.280> and<00:01:02.580> up<00:01:02.670> into<00:01:02.880> the<00:01:02.970> dunes<00:01:03.300> that's

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
the beach and up into the dunes that's

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.740 
the beach and up into the dunes that's
something<00:01:04.410> we<00:01:04.470> call<00:01:04.650> saltation<00:01:05.270> and<00:01:06.270> the

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
something we call saltation and the

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.330 
something we call saltation and the
third<00:01:06.960> mechanism<00:01:07.230> by<00:01:07.680> which<00:01:07.710> they<00:01:07.980> could<00:01:08.190> move

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
third mechanism by which they could move

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.760 
third mechanism by which they could move
is<00:01:09.030> when<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:10.020> wind<00:01:10.170> is<00:01:10.320> just<00:01:10.470> strong<00:01:10.710> enough

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
is when the wind is just strong enough

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.120 
is when the wind is just strong enough
to<00:01:11.100> move<00:01:11.370> it<00:01:11.610> along<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.570> ground<00:01:12.600> as<00:01:13.530> a<00:01:13.590> blanket

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
to move it along the ground as a blanket

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.020 
to move it along the ground as a blanket
if<00:01:14.370> you<00:01:14.520> like<00:01:14.730> we<00:01:15.360> call<00:01:15.540> surface<00:01:15.780> creep<00:01:17.030> now

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
if you like we call surface creep now

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.350 
if you like we call surface creep now
when<00:01:18.870> the<00:01:19.200> sand<00:01:19.800> is<00:01:19.950> moving<00:01:20.190> by<00:01:20.910> anything<00:01:21.060> any

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
when the sand is moving by anything any

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.900 
when the sand is moving by anything any
one<00:01:21.570> of<00:01:21.600> those<00:01:21.780> three<00:01:21.990> mechanisms<00:01:22.760> it<00:01:23.760> will

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:23.910 
one of those three mechanisms it will

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:26.840 
one of those three mechanisms it will
only<00:01:24.030> come<00:01:24.390> to<00:01:24.600> stop<00:01:24.900> and<00:01:25.229> be<00:01:25.500> deposited<00:01:26.070> when

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
only come to stop and be deposited when

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.670 
only come to stop and be deposited when
the<00:01:26.940> wind<00:01:27.150> velocity<00:01:27.300> was<00:01:27.840> transporting<00:01:28.530> it

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
the wind velocity was transporting it

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.450 
the wind velocity was transporting it
decreases<00:01:29.430> and<00:01:29.700> that<00:01:30.479> that<00:01:30.810> can<00:01:30.960> occur<00:01:31.460> when

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
decreases and that that can occur when

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.380 
decreases and that that can occur when
the<00:01:32.970> sand<00:01:34.130> encounters<00:01:35.130> an<00:01:35.250> obstacle<00:01:35.360> like<00:01:36.360> a

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
the sand encounters an obstacle like a

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.940 
the sand encounters an obstacle like a
strand<00:01:36.810> line<00:01:37.080> at<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.380> back<00:01:37.530> of<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:37.770> beach

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
strand line at the back of the beach

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.010 
strand line at the back of the beach
composed<00:01:38.550> of<00:01:38.700> driftwood

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
composed of driftwood

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.710 
composed of driftwood
seaweed<00:01:40.710> maybe<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.550> odd<00:01:41.640> dead<00:01:41.940> dolphin<00:01:42.180> also

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
seaweed maybe the odd dead dolphin also

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.920 
seaweed maybe the odd dead dolphin also
and<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:44.100> sand<00:01:44.340> can<00:01:44.610> then<00:01:44.760> be<00:01:45.240> deposited<00:01:45.780> in

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
and the sand can then be deposited in

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.460 
and the sand can then be deposited in
the<00:01:46.020> Leeside<00:01:46.700> sometimes<00:01:47.700> also<00:01:48.090> on<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:48.540> upwind

accumulation<00:01:52.800> of<00:01:53.070> sand<00:01:53.630> so<00:01:54.630> what<00:01:54.750> we<00:01:54.840> call<00:01:54.990> a

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
accumulation of sand so what we call a

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.290 
accumulation of sand so what we call a
shadow<00:01:55.320> June<00:01:55.740> and<00:01:56.490> at<00:01:56.610> this<00:01:56.730> point<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.090> shadow

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:57.300 
shadow June and at this point the shadow

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.660 
shadow June and at this point the shadow
June<00:01:57.630> doesn't<00:01:58.320> have<00:01:58.650> any<00:01:58.890> vegetation<00:01:59.430> on<00:01:59.520> it

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
June doesn't have any vegetation on it

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.880 
June doesn't have any vegetation on it
it's<00:01:59.820> just<00:02:00.060> sand<00:02:00.330> around<00:02:00.990> a<00:02:01.080> particular<00:02:01.230> devil

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
it's just sand around a particular devil

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.940 
it's just sand around a particular devil
piece<00:02:02.100> of<00:02:02.250> debris<00:02:03.050> but<00:02:04.050> if<00:02:04.290> the<00:02:04.680> sand

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
piece of debris but if the sand

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.740 
piece of debris but if the sand
accumulates<00:02:05.340> enough<00:02:05.670> and<00:02:05.880> it<00:02:05.970> gets<00:02:06.150> above<00:02:06.510> the

accumulates enough and it gets above the

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.990 
accumulates enough and it gets above the
the<00:02:07.230> influence<00:02:07.830> of<00:02:07.890> the<00:02:07.980> waves<00:02:08.220> the

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
the influence of the waves the

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.370 
the influence of the waves the
vegetation<00:02:09.570> can<00:02:09.720> actually<00:02:10.019> start<00:02:10.260> to

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
vegetation can actually start to

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.920 
vegetation can actually start to
colonize<00:02:10.830> that<00:02:11.489> shadow<00:02:11.850> June<00:02:12.150> to<00:02:12.750> produce

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
colonize that shadow June to produce

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.440 
colonize that shadow June to produce
then<00:02:13.380> what<00:02:13.620> we<00:02:13.739> call<00:02:13.980> an<00:02:14.130> embryo<00:02:14.519> to

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
then what we call an embryo to

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.500 
then what we call an embryo to
and<00:02:15.569> an<00:02:15.720> embryo<00:02:16.020> tune<00:02:16.290> can<00:02:16.530> be<00:02:16.650> a<00:02:16.680> very<00:02:16.890> small

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
and an embryo tune can be a very small

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.870 
and an embryo tune can be a very small
round<00:02:18.510> circular<00:02:19.610> accumulation<00:02:20.610> of<00:02:20.670> sound

it centered on a piece of debris but

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.680 
it centered on a piece of debris but
eventually<00:02:26.040> if<00:02:26.459> it's<00:02:26.640> a<00:02:26.730> longer<00:02:26.910> strand<00:02:27.390> line

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
eventually if it's a longer strand line

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.220 
eventually if it's a longer strand line

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
continued accumulation of sand and and

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.320 
continued accumulation of sand and and
the<00:02:34.350> increased<00:02:35.280> trapping<00:02:35.700> ability<00:02:36.150> of<00:02:36.239> the

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
the increased trapping ability of the

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
vegetation they can actually start to

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.320 
vegetation they can actually start to

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
coalesce and to merge along the Strand

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.270 
coalesce and to merge along the Strand
line<00:02:42.569> so<00:02:42.870> you<00:02:42.959> have<00:02:43.110> these<00:02:43.280> emerging

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
line so you have these emerging

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.460 
line so you have these emerging
coalescing<00:02:45.180> embryo<00:02:45.989> Tunes

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
coalescing embryo Tunes

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.790 
coalescing embryo Tunes
which<00:02:47.280> eventually<00:02:47.880> produce<00:02:48.480> a<00:02:48.840> linear<00:02:49.470> judy

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
which eventually produce a linear judy

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.190 
which eventually produce a linear judy
feature<00:02:50.100> and<00:02:51.000> it<00:02:51.090> occurs<00:02:51.420> right<00:02:51.690> at<00:02:51.900> the<00:02:51.989> front

starved<00:03:53.440> a<00:03:53.530> settlement<00:03:54.120> when<00:03:55.120> that<00:03:55.270> happens

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:55.690 
starved a settlement when that happens

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:58.620 
starved a settlement when that happens
they<00:03:56.170> are<00:03:56.290> vulnerable<00:03:56.440> to<00:03:56.980> an<00:03:57.910> incision<00:03:58.450> and

00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:58.630 
they are vulnerable to an incision and

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:00.390 
they are vulnerable to an incision and
thus<00:03:59.260> turbines<00:03:59.650> passed<00:03:59.890> by<00:04:00.040> rabbits

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
thus turbines passed by rabbits

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.850 
thus turbines passed by rabbits
burrowing<00:04:00.790> like<00:04:01.480> goats<00:04:02.020> or<00:04:02.290> sheep<00:04:02.319> grazing

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:05.050 
only tourists walking across the beach

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:06.809 
only tourists walking across the beach
across<00:04:05.860> the<00:04:06.010> tooth<00:04:06.190> rather<00:04:06.489> than<00:04:06.580> to<00:04:06.700> the

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:09.940 
beach and in sizing pathways as we have

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:16.349 
beach and in sizing pathways as we have
here<00:04:11.430> when<00:04:12.430> that<00:04:12.580> happens<00:04:14.400> the<00:04:15.400> wind<00:04:16.090> can

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:16.359 
here when that happens the wind can

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:18.659 
here when that happens the wind can
actually<00:04:16.720> get<00:04:16.930> into<00:04:17.109> those<00:04:17.530> pathways<00:04:18.190> and

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:18.669 
actually get into those pathways and

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:21.950 
actually get into those pathways and
start<00:04:19.090> to<00:04:19.329> undercut<00:04:20.169> the<00:04:20.200> dune<00:04:20.560> on<00:04:20.680> the<00:04:20.979> side

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:21.960 
start to undercut the dune on the side

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:24.719 
start to undercut the dune on the side
releasing<00:04:22.960> the<00:04:23.290> sand<00:04:23.979> from<00:04:24.130> underneath<00:04:24.430> the

00:04:24.719 --> 00:04:24.729 
releasing the sand from underneath the

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:27.120 
releasing the sand from underneath the
vegetation<00:04:25.660> in<00:04:25.780> which<00:04:25.900> case<00:04:26.139> we<00:04:26.710> have<00:04:26.919> here

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
vegetation in which case we have here

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:31.800 
vegetation in which case we have here
Marin<00:04:27.639> grasses<00:04:28.090> and<00:04:28.270> sedges

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:36.909 

we<00:04:31.900> play<00:04:32.620> with

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:36.919 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:39.439

00:04:39.439 --> 00:04:39.449 
transported from the toon Ridge to

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:42.469 
transported from the toon Ridge to
behind<00:04:39.900> the<00:04:40.560> fragment<00:04:41.160> to<00:04:41.190> the<00:04:41.340> left<00:04:41.610> and<00:04:42.270> so

00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:42.479 
behind the fragment to the left and so

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:45.110 
behind the fragment to the left and so
the<00:04:42.509> whole<00:04:42.780> Duke<00:04:43.740> we<00:04:44.129> reorient<00:04:44.669> a<00:04:44.789> different

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120 
the whole Duke we reorient a different

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.059 
the whole Duke we reorient a different
what<00:04:45.479> was<00:04:45.659> parallel<00:04:46.259> to<00:04:46.470> the<00:04:46.620> coast

00:04:47.059 --> 00:04:47.069 
what was parallel to the coast

00:04:47.069 --> 00:04:49.879 
what was parallel to the coast
to<00:04:47.520> actually<00:04:47.669> become<00:04:48.259> perpendicular<00:04:49.259> to<00:04:49.680> the

00:04:49.879 --> 00:04:49.889 
to actually become perpendicular to the

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:52.760 
to actually become perpendicular to the
coast<00:04:50.129> and<00:04:50.280> right<00:04:50.550> angles<00:04:51.289> and<00:04:52.289> when<00:04:52.590> that

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:52.770 
coast and right angles and when that

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:54.469 
coast and right angles and when that
happens<00:04:53.129> we<00:04:53.250> call<00:04:53.430> those<00:04:53.580> secondary<00:04:54.150> Jews

00:04:54.469 --> 00:04:54.479 
happens we call those secondary Jews

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:56.029 
happens we call those secondary Jews
because<00:04:54.840> they're<00:04:54.960> no<00:04:55.199> longer<00:04:55.409> in<00:04:55.860> their

00:04:56.029 --> 00:04:56.039 
because they're no longer in their

00:04:56.039 --> 00:04:59.390 
because they're no longer in their
original<00:04:56.250> orientation<00:04:57.319> and<00:04:58.319> of<00:04:58.440> course<00:04:58.650> when

00:04:59.390 --> 00:04:59.400 
original orientation and of course when

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:00.649 
original orientation and of course when
they<00:04:59.520> are<00:04:59.669> in<00:04:59.789> their<00:04:59.909> original<00:05:00.060> orientation

00:05:00.649 --> 00:05:00.659 
they are in their original orientation

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:02.360 
they are in their original orientation
we<00:05:00.930> call<00:05:01.080> those<00:05:01.199> primary<00:05:01.800> Jews<00:05:02.009> because

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:02.370 
we call those primary Jews because

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:04.550 
we call those primary Jews because
they're<00:05:02.520> in<00:05:02.639> their<00:05:02.759> primary<00:05:03.210> position<00:05:03.659> so<00:05:04.409> by

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:04.560 
they're in their primary position so by

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:05.990 
they're in their primary position so by
looking<00:05:04.710> at<00:05:04.949> from<00:05:05.129> the<00:05:05.280> air<00:05:05.430> and<00:05:05.669> a<00:05:05.759> Jude

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.000 
looking at from the air and a Jude

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.480 
looking at from the air and a Jude
system<00:05:06.449> the<00:05:07.139> genes<00:05:07.470> that<00:05:07.650> are<00:05:07.800> still<00:05:08.220> parallel

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:08.490 
system the genes that are still parallel

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:09.379 
system the genes that are still parallel
to<00:05:08.849> the<00:05:08.940> coast

00:05:09.379 --> 00:05:09.389 
to the coast

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:12.230 
to the coast
our<00:05:09.810> primary<00:05:10.139> genes<00:05:10.530> those<00:05:11.280> that<00:05:11.669> we<00:05:11.789> need<00:05:12.000> be

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:12.240 
our primary genes those that we need be

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.420 
our primary genes those that we need be
orientated<00:05:12.750> through<00:05:13.139> stance<00:05:13.470> and<00:05:13.740> starvation

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:14.430 
orientated through stance and starvation

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:17.600 
orientated through stance and starvation
and<00:05:15.060> blowout<00:05:15.509> formation<00:05:16.110> and<00:05:16.919> undercutting

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:17.610 
and blowout formation and undercutting

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:20.870 
and blowout formation and undercutting
to<00:05:18.060> deflation<00:05:18.870> or<00:05:19.169> the<00:05:19.380> wind<00:05:19.590> they<00:05:20.520> become

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:20.880 
to deflation or the wind they become

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:23.059 
to deflation or the wind they become
perpendicular<00:05:21.690> and<00:05:22.440> they<00:05:22.560> are<00:05:22.680> the<00:05:22.770> second

00:05:23.059 --> 00:05:23.069 
perpendicular and they are the second

00:05:23.069 --> 00:05:23.830 
perpendicular and they are the second
degree

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:23.840 
degree

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:27.620 
degree
so<00:05:24.840> there's<00:05:25.020> a<00:05:25.110> whole<00:05:25.370> evolutionary<00:05:26.630> process

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:27.630 
so there's a whole evolutionary process

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:31.940 
so there's a whole evolutionary process
going<00:05:27.900> on<00:05:28.080> there<00:05:28.319> with<00:05:28.620> the<00:05:29.069> sand<00:05:29.699> dunes
