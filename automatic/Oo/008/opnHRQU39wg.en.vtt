on there right now however I'm pretty

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:28.690 
on there right now however I'm pretty
sure<00:03:25.549> that<00:03:25.760> that's<00:03:25.849> a<00:03:26.030> fake<00:03:27.340> so<00:03:28.340> you<00:03:28.430> got<00:03:28.549> to<00:03:28.639> be

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
sure that that's a fake so you got to be

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.150 
sure that that's a fake so you got to be
real<00:03:28.880> careful<00:03:29.120> with<00:03:29.329> that<00:03:29.560> however<00:03:30.560> a<00:03:30.980> good

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.160 
real careful with that however a good

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:32.349 
real careful with that however a good
way<00:03:31.280> to<00:03:31.340> tell<00:03:31.579> is<00:03:31.669> if<00:03:31.760> you<00:03:31.849> want<00:03:32.060> the<00:03:32.180> new

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:32.359 
way to tell is if you want the new

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:34.120 
way to tell is if you want the new
mennonite<00:03:32.780> just<00:03:33.410> make<00:03:33.590> sure<00:03:33.680> that<00:03:33.829> it<00:03:33.950> looks

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130 
mennonite just make sure that it looks

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:36.039 
mennonite just make sure that it looks
like<00:03:34.190> this<00:03:34.370> one<00:03:34.549> I<00:03:34.579> have<00:03:34.760> here<00:03:35.030> the<00:03:35.419> mask<00:03:35.750> is

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:36.049 
like this one I have here the mask is

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:38.140 
like this one I have here the mask is
the<00:03:36.079> best<00:03:36.410> way<00:03:36.560> to<00:03:36.590> tell<00:03:36.859> if<00:03:37.340> like<00:03:37.790> this<00:03:37.970> is

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
the best way to tell if like this is

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.000 
the best way to tell if like this is
hanging<00:03:38.480> too<00:03:38.690> low<00:03:38.720> over<00:03:39.290> a<00:03:39.319> space<00:03:39.650> or

hanging too low over a space or
something<00:03:40.310> like<00:03:40.400> that<00:03:40.720> it's<00:03:41.720> most<00:03:41.989> likely<00:03:42.079> a

00:03:42.339 --> 00:03:42.349 
something like that it's most likely a
