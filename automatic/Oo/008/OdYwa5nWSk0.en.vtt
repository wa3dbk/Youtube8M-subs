inside<00:00:12.990> here<00:00:13.320> has<00:00:13.980> stopped<00:00:14.429> turning<00:00:15.800> and<00:00:17.060> I'm

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
inside here has stopped turning and I'm

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.390 
inside here has stopped turning and I'm
going<00:00:18.210> to<00:00:18.300> take<00:00:18.359> it<00:00:18.420> apart<00:00:18.810> and<00:00:19.109> see<00:00:20.100> if<00:00:20.189> I<00:00:20.250> can

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
going to take it apart and see if I can

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.730 
going to take it apart and see if I can
figure<00:00:20.580> out<00:00:20.699> why<00:00:21.090> and<00:00:21.420> fix<00:00:21.510> it<00:00:21.930> if<00:00:22.109> I<00:00:22.260> can<00:00:22.320> if

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
figure out why and fix it if I can if

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.349 
figure out why and fix it if I can if
not<00:00:22.769> I'm<00:00:23.220> going<00:00:23.400> to<00:00:23.490> keep<00:00:23.640> it<00:00:23.820> till<00:00:24.000> it<00:00:24.119> quits

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
not I'm going to keep it till it quits

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.220 
not I'm going to keep it till it quits
running<00:00:24.619> because<00:00:25.619> it<00:00:25.890> still<00:00:26.099> works<00:00:26.369> but<00:00:27.140> if<00:00:28.140> I

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
running because it still works but if I

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.919 
running because it still works but if I
could<00:00:28.289> figure<00:00:28.529> it<00:00:28.710> out<00:00:28.830> i'm<00:00:28.980> going<00:00:29.250> to<00:00:29.779> what<00:00:30.779> we

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
could figure it out i'm going to what we

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.580 
could figure it out i'm going to what we
got<00:00:32.300> there's<00:00:33.300> a<00:00:33.420> bunch<00:00:33.780> of<00:00:33.960> phillips<00:00:34.320> screws

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
is the bottom of thing turned up so let

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.510 
is the bottom of thing turned up so let
me<00:01:27.630> just<00:01:27.750> tell<00:01:27.960> you<00:01:27.990> this<00:01:28.140> that<00:01:28.500> in<00:01:29.280> a

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
me just tell you this that in a

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.030 
me just tell you this that in a
microwave<00:01:30.000> there's<00:01:30.329> a<00:01:30.390> capacitor<00:01:31.229> that<00:01:31.259> holds

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
microwave there's a capacitor that holds

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:37.219 
microwave there's a capacitor that holds
a<00:01:32.220> bunch<00:01:32.640> of<00:01:33.500> energy<00:01:34.500> and<00:01:35.810> if<00:01:36.810> you're<00:01:37.110> not

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
a bunch of energy and if you're not

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.080 
a bunch of energy and if you're not
careful<00:01:37.470> that<00:01:37.890> could<00:01:37.920> zap<00:01:38.340> you<00:01:38.610> but<00:01:38.790> we're<00:01:38.939> not

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
careful that could zap you but we're not

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.480 
careful that could zap you but we're not
going<00:01:39.420> near<00:01:39.570> that<00:01:39.630> capacitor<00:01:40.380> world<00:01:40.590> or<00:01:41.280> I'm

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
going near that capacitor world or I'm

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.160 
going near that capacitor world or I'm
going<00:01:41.610> to<00:01:41.670> be<00:01:41.790> working<00:01:42.150> on<00:01:42.360> this<00:01:42.479> thing<00:01:42.540> all

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170

crews out ok I got it apart and here's

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.620 
crews out ok I got it apart and here's
the<00:01:55.759> capacitor<00:01:56.759> that<00:01:56.790> you<00:01:57.149> don't<00:01:57.360> want<00:01:57.540> to

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
the capacitor that you don't want to

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:03.889 
the capacitor that you don't want to
touch<00:02:00.290> here's<00:02:01.290> the<00:02:01.380> motor<00:02:02.329> right<00:02:03.329> here<00:02:03.600> this

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
got it when this thing started going bad

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.010 
got it when this thing started going bad
I<00:02:13.810> could<00:02:14.620> hear<00:02:14.920> a<00:02:14.950> grinding<00:02:15.280> noise<00:02:15.810> I'm<00:02:16.810> going

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
work tell you what I'm going to plug it

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:46.500 
work tell you what I'm going to plug it
back<00:02:40.870> in<00:02:41.730> here's<00:02:42.730> the<00:02:42.850> plug<00:02:45.269> I'm<00:02:46.269> going<00:02:46.450> to

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
back in here's the plug I'm going to

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.080 
back in here's the plug I'm going to
take<00:02:46.690> this<00:02:46.870> plug<00:02:47.140> out<00:02:47.320> in<00:02:47.440> the<00:02:47.500> back<00:02:47.940> I'm<00:02:48.940> gonna

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
take this plug out in the back I'm gonna

00:02:49.090 --> 00:03:03.030 
take this plug out in the back I'm gonna
plug<00:02:49.330> it<00:02:49.450> in<00:02:50.070> and<00:03:01.410> so<00:03:02.410> we<00:03:02.440> can<00:03:02.620> get<00:03:02.680> that<00:03:02.830> motor

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
plug it in and so we can get that motor

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.680 
plug it in and so we can get that motor
to<00:03:03.220> work<00:03:03.370> i'll<00:03:03.550> be<00:03:03.670> right<00:03:03.790> back<00:03:03.940> I<00:03:04.150> gotta<00:03:04.360> get

on my regular bench all right don't try
this<00:03:10.450> at<00:03:10.569> home<00:03:10.720> might<00:03:11.650> not<00:03:11.800> be<00:03:11.920> safe<00:03:12.160> there's

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
this at home might not be safe there's

my<00:03:12.880> disclaimer<00:03:13.470> I'm<00:03:14.470> just<00:03:14.620> going<00:03:14.769> to<00:03:14.829> start<00:03:15.160> it

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
my disclaimer I'm just going to start it

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:20.120 
my disclaimer I'm just going to start it
and<00:03:15.459> we'll<00:03:15.790> see<00:03:15.970> if<00:03:16.060> this<00:03:16.239> motor<00:03:16.480> he<00:03:16.750> returns

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:26.870 

no<00:03:20.940> does<00:03:21.390> not<00:03:22.820> so<00:03:23.820> I<00:03:25.160> think<00:03:26.160> what<00:03:26.430> I'll<00:03:26.520> do<00:03:26.640> now

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
no does not so I think what I'll do now

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.470 
no does not so I think what I'll do now
is<00:03:28.040> put<00:03:29.040> a<00:03:29.070> volt<00:03:29.670> meter<00:03:29.730> on<00:03:30.060> here<00:03:30.270> and<00:03:30.360> see<00:03:30.450> if

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
is put a volt meter on here and see if

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.360 
is put a volt meter on here and see if
I'm<00:03:30.630> getting<00:03:30.870> in<00:03:30.960> juice<00:03:31.260> when<00:03:32.070> we<00:03:32.130> get<00:03:32.280> low

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
I'm getting in juice when we get low

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.120 
I'm getting in juice when we get low
volt<00:03:32.550> meter<00:03:32.730> be<00:03:33.060> right<00:03:33.240> back<00:03:33.390> all<00:03:33.660> right<00:03:34.620> i<00:03:34.950> got

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
volt meter be right back all right i got

00:03:35.130 --> 00:04:12.920 
volt meter be right back all right i got
the<00:03:35.810> pro<00:03:36.810> probes<00:03:37.440> in<00:03:37.800> there<00:03:38.070> i<00:03:38.280> did<00:04:11.780> have<00:04:12.780> this

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
the pro probes in there i did have this

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:16.160 
the pro probes in there i did have this
all<00:04:13.110> set<00:04:13.140> up<00:04:13.380> to<00:04:14.210> all<00:04:15.210> right<00:04:15.330> let's<00:04:15.840> just<00:04:16.020> give

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:16.170 
all set up to all right let's just give

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:30.300 
all set up to all right let's just give
it<00:04:16.200> a<00:04:16.380> real<00:04:16.770> fast<00:04:17.220> click<00:04:17.610> here

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:32.020 

well<00:04:31.310> it's<00:04:31.430> saying<00:04:31.580> that<00:04:31.640> we're<00:04:31.850> getting

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.030 
well it's saying that we're getting

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:46.090 
well it's saying that we're getting
juice<00:04:42.910> well<00:04:43.910> I<00:04:43.940> got<00:04:44.090> power<00:04:44.330> coming<00:04:44.920> to<00:04:45.920> the

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:46.100 
juice well I got power coming to the

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:50.200 
juice well I got power coming to the
motor<00:04:46.570> so<00:04:47.570> now<00:04:47.780> all<00:04:48.250> I<00:04:49.250> can<00:04:49.490> guess<00:04:49.880> is<00:04:50.090> the

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:50.210 
motor so now all I can guess is the

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:54.340 
motor so now all I can guess is the
motors<00:04:50.630> bad<00:04:50.900> i<00:04:52.330> may<00:04:53.330> try<00:04:53.540> to<00:04:53.600> take<00:04:53.840> this<00:04:54.020> apart

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:54.350 
motors bad i may try to take this apart

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:57.240 
motors bad i may try to take this apart
with<00:04:54.620> the<00:04:54.710> heck<00:04:54.860> i'm<00:04:55.010> here<00:04:55.280> be<00:04:56.240> right<00:04:56.420> back

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:57.250 
with the heck i'm here be right back

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:59.830 
with the heck i'm here be right back
well<00:04:58.250> I<00:04:58.520> decided<00:04:58.820> I'm<00:04:59.240> not<00:04:59.270> going<00:04:59.570> to<00:04:59.660> take<00:04:59.780> it

00:04:59.830 --> 00:04:59.840 
well I decided I'm not going to take it

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:01.750 
well I decided I'm not going to take it
apart<00:05:00.170> let<00:05:00.410> me<00:05:00.470> show<00:05:00.620> you<00:05:00.650> why<00:05:00.920> when<00:05:01.280> I<00:05:01.340> when<00:05:01.730> I

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:01.760 
apart let me show you why when I when I

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:03.640 
apart let me show you why when I when I
turn<00:05:02.030> this<00:05:02.240> there<00:05:02.870> is<00:05:03.020> something<00:05:03.320> there's

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:03.650 
turn this there is something there's

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:05.770 
turn this there is something there's
some<00:05:03.800> gears<00:05:04.070> or<00:05:04.310> something<00:05:04.610> wrong<00:05:04.880> hold<00:05:05.570> it<00:05:05.690> up

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:05.780 
some gears or something wrong hold it up

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:14.770 
some gears or something wrong hold it up
close<00:05:06.020> so<00:05:06.200> you<00:05:06.230> can<00:05:06.320> hear<00:05:06.530> it<00:05:13.450> you<00:05:14.450> hear<00:05:14.630> them

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:14.780 
close so you can hear it you hear them

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:23.680 
close so you can hear it you hear them
gears<00:05:21.010> and<00:05:22.010> that's<00:05:22.550> what<00:05:22.760> I<00:05:22.790> heard<00:05:23.030> as<00:05:23.270> this

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:23.690 
gears and that's what I heard as this

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:25.180 
gears and that's what I heard as this
thing<00:05:23.900> was<00:05:24.080> getting<00:05:24.230> worse<00:05:24.530> and<00:05:24.770> worse<00:05:24.830> that's

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:25.190 
thing was getting worse and worse that's

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:26.920 
thing was getting worse and worse that's
what<00:05:25.340> I<00:05:25.400> heard<00:05:25.550> was<00:05:25.610> grinding<00:05:26.300> and<00:05:26.450> and

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:26.930 
what I heard was grinding and and

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:28.990 
what I heard was grinding and and
crunching<00:05:27.770> and<00:05:27.980> I'm<00:05:28.400> sure<00:05:28.580> these<00:05:28.730> little

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:29.000 
crunching and I'm sure these little

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.370 
crunching and I'm sure these little
gears<00:05:29.240> in<00:05:29.450> here<00:05:29.660> nylon<00:05:30.250> so<00:05:32.080> I'm<00:05:33.080> just<00:05:33.170> going<00:05:33.290> to

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:33.380 
gears in here nylon so I'm just going to

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:35.860 
gears in here nylon so I'm just going to
leave<00:05:33.470> it<00:05:33.500> out<00:05:33.740> I'll<00:05:34.330> we<00:05:35.330> didn't<00:05:35.540> fix<00:05:35.720> anything

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:35.870 
leave it out I'll we didn't fix anything

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:37.930 
leave it out I'll we didn't fix anything
but<00:05:36.350> we<00:05:36.680> figured<00:05:36.890> out<00:05:37.130> what<00:05:37.520> the<00:05:37.550> little<00:05:37.760> motor

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:37.940 
but we figured out what the little motor

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:39.520 
but we figured out what the little motor
looks<00:05:38.150> like<00:05:38.390> that's<00:05:38.600> pretty<00:05:38.750> cool<00:05:39.020> little<00:05:39.350> a

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:39.530 
looks like that's pretty cool little a

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:43.990 
looks like that's pretty cool little a
little<00:05:40.130> tiny<00:05:40.370> motor<00:05:40.610> like<00:05:40.820> that<00:05:42.220> so<00:05:43.220> I'll<00:05:43.970> just

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:44.000 
little tiny motor like that so I'll just

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.600 
little tiny motor like that so I'll just
use<00:05:44.330> this<00:05:44.360> thing<00:05:44.720> till<00:05:44.930> it<00:05:45.080> quits<00:05:45.680> working<00:05:45.890> it

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:46.610 
use this thing till it quits working it

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:48.250 
use this thing till it quits working it
doesn't<00:05:46.970> heat<00:05:47.120> evenly<00:05:47.510> you've<00:05:47.750> got<00:05:47.900> to<00:05:47.990> stop

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:48.260 
doesn't heat evenly you've got to stop

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:49.780 
doesn't heat evenly you've got to stop
it<00:05:48.290> two<00:05:48.620> or<00:05:48.740> three<00:05:48.770> times<00:05:49.100> and<00:05:49.400> turn<00:05:49.610> your

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:49.790 
it two or three times and turn your

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:52.900 
it two or three times and turn your
plate<00:05:50.090> so<00:05:50.860> so<00:05:51.860> the<00:05:51.980> plate<00:05:52.190> will<00:05:52.370> heat<00:05:52.520> evenly

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:52.910 
plate so so the plate will heat evenly

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:57.760 
plate so so the plate will heat evenly
but<00:05:54.130> anyway<00:05:55.840> I'll<00:05:56.840> put<00:05:56.990> this<00:05:57.110> up<00:05:57.350> it's<00:05:57.620> not

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:57.770 
but anyway I'll put this up it's not

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:59.350 
but anyway I'll put this up it's not
it's<00:05:57.950> not<00:05:58.100> a<00:05:58.160> repair<00:05:58.580> but<00:05:58.880> it's<00:05:59.060> definitely

00:05:59.350 --> 00:05:59.360 
it's not a repair but it's definitely

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:01.450 
it's not a repair but it's definitely
may<00:05:59.840> you<00:06:00.350> know<00:06:00.440> there's<00:06:01.040> a<00:06:01.070> lot<00:06:01.190> of<00:06:01.220> people

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:01.460 
may you know there's a lot of people

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:04.920 
may you know there's a lot of people
haven't<00:06:01.730> seen<00:06:01.910> the<00:06:02.060> inside<00:06:02.720> of<00:06:02.960> a<00:06:03.820> microwave

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:04.930 
haven't seen the inside of a microwave

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:07.090 
haven't seen the inside of a microwave
this<00:06:05.930> isn't<00:06:06.320> the<00:06:06.380> part<00:06:06.590> that<00:06:06.770> makes<00:06:06.920> the

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:07.100 
this isn't the part that makes the

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:09.220 
this isn't the part that makes the
microwave<00:06:07.550> but<00:06:08.360> this<00:06:08.720> year<00:06:08.990> is<00:06:09.110> the

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:09.230 
microwave but this year is the

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:11.530 
microwave but this year is the
transformer<00:06:09.890> and<00:06:10.180> this<00:06:11.180> here<00:06:11.390> is<00:06:11.420> the

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:11.540 
transformer and this here is the

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:14.650 
transformer and this here is the
capacitor<00:06:12.140> and<00:06:12.460> the<00:06:13.460> things<00:06:13.880> that<00:06:13.970> makes<00:06:14.510> the

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:14.660 
capacitor and the things that makes the

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:16.360 
capacitor and the things that makes the
microwave<00:06:15.080> is<00:06:15.230> actually<00:06:15.590> in<00:06:15.740> the<00:06:15.890> top<00:06:16.100> of<00:06:16.310> the

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:16.370 
microwave is actually in the top of the

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:20.250 
microwave is actually in the top of the
microwave<00:06:16.850> and<00:06:18.340> that's<00:06:19.340> the<00:06:19.520> dangerous<00:06:19.910> part

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:20.260 
microwave and that's the dangerous part

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.480 
microwave and that's the dangerous part
so<00:06:21.260> I'm<00:06:21.740> going<00:06:21.890> to<00:06:21.920> put<00:06:22.040> this<00:06:22.070> back<00:06:22.370> together

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:22.490 
so I'm going to put this back together

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:24.340 
so I'm going to put this back together
bring<00:06:22.970> back<00:06:23.180> the<00:06:23.330> kitchen<00:06:23.660> and<00:06:23.810> we<00:06:23.990> won't<00:06:24.140> tell

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:24.350 
bring back the kitchen and we won't tell

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:26.350 
bring back the kitchen and we won't tell
my<00:06:24.500> wife<00:06:24.680> i<00:06:24.860> had<00:06:25.010> this<00:06:25.130> part<00:06:25.460> thanks<00:06:26.240> for

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:26.360 
my wife i had this part thanks for

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:29.680 
my wife i had this part thanks for

the crap they send us I'm going to hang

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:01.850 
the crap they send us I'm going to hang
on<00:06:58.980> to<00:06:59.070> this<00:06:59.160> little<00:06:59.370> motor<00:07:00.500> you<00:07:01.500> never<00:07:01.680> know<00:07:01.740> I

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:01.860 
on to this little motor you never know I

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:04.000 
on to this little motor you never know I
might<00:07:01.980> run<00:07:02.340> across<00:07:02.490> another<00:07:02.940> microwave<00:07:03.480> that

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:04.010 
might run across another microwave that

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:06.590 
might run across another microwave that
you<00:07:05.010> know<00:07:05.130> transformer<00:07:05.850> broke<00:07:06.060> but<00:07:06.300> the<00:07:06.420> motor

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:06.600 
you know transformer broke but the motor

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:09.650 
you know transformer broke but the motor
works<00:07:06.930> and<00:07:07.970> I'm<00:07:08.970> sure<00:07:09.120> they're<00:07:09.300> pretty<00:07:09.480> much

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:09.660 
works and I'm sure they're pretty much

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:13.420 
works and I'm sure they're pretty much
standard<00:07:10.940> so<00:07:11.940> I'll<00:07:12.150> keep<00:07:12.270> my<00:07:12.450> eyes<00:07:12.510> up<00:07:12.810> for<00:07:13.230> a

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:13.430 
standard so I'll keep my eyes up for a

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:16.760 
standard so I'll keep my eyes up for a
junk<00:07:14.430> microwave<00:07:15.050> all<00:07:16.050> right<00:07:16.170> we<00:07:16.290> fixing<00:07:16.620> go<00:07:16.710> to

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:16.770 
junk microwave all right we fixing go to

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:18.080 
junk microwave all right we fixing go to
the<00:07:16.890> kitchen<00:07:17.220> plug<00:07:17.400> it<00:07:17.550> in<00:07:17.670> and<00:07:17.730> make<00:07:17.880> sure<00:07:17.910> it

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:18.090 
the kitchen plug it in and make sure it

00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:33.980 
the kitchen plug it in and make sure it
works<00:07:29.360> all<00:07:30.360> right<00:07:30.690> it<00:07:31.050> works<00:07:31.320> good<00:07:31.740> enough
