00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.570 
I could match the colors from one to the
other<00:00:26.730> so<00:00:27.300> as<00:00:27.420> you<00:00:27.539> can<00:00:27.660> tell<00:00:27.720> it<00:00:28.050> has<00:00:28.580> fairly

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:35.000 
like that everything looks pretty good

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.370 
like that everything looks pretty good
if<00:00:36.000> you<00:00:36.059> look<00:00:36.390> at<00:00:36.510> this<00:00:36.660> one<00:00:36.840> real<00:00:36.960> close<00:00:37.079> it

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
if you look at this one real close it

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.020 
if you look at this one real close it
looks<00:00:37.559> just<00:00:37.739> a<00:00:37.920> little<00:00:37.950> blotchy<00:00:38.399> but<00:00:38.850> if<00:00:38.940> you

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
looks just a little blotchy but if you

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.930 
looks just a little blotchy but if you
look<00:00:39.210> at<00:00:39.360> this<00:00:39.540> one<00:00:39.750> here<00:00:40.050> it<00:00:40.739> kind<00:00:41.610> of<00:00:41.670> has<00:00:41.820> the

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
look at this one here it kind of has the

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.280 
look at this one here it kind of has the
same<00:00:41.969> characteristics<00:00:42.600> you're<00:00:43.079> not<00:00:43.200> gonna

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
same characteristics you're not gonna

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.020 
same characteristics you're not gonna
find<00:00:43.559> one<00:00:44.040> goose<00:00:44.309> there's<00:00:44.640> going<00:00:44.789> to<00:00:44.879> look

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
find one goose there's going to look

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.270 
find one goose there's going to look
identical<00:00:45.329> and<00:00:46.079> if<00:00:46.289> a<00:00:46.410> decoy<00:00:46.710> spread<00:00:46.890> looks

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
identical and if a decoy spread looks

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.029 
identical and if a decoy spread looks
exactly<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:48.149> same<00:00:48.410> yeah<00:00:49.410> they're<00:00:49.620> gonna<00:00:49.739> come

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
exactly the same yeah they're gonna come

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.470 
exactly the same yeah they're gonna come
in<00:00:50.070> and<00:00:50.219> stuff<00:00:50.520> like<00:00:50.670> that<00:00:50.850> but<00:00:51.059> I<00:00:51.149> guess<00:00:51.300> my

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
in and stuff like that but I guess my

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.529 
in and stuff like that but I guess my
point<00:00:51.690> is<00:00:51.930> is<00:00:52.670> if<00:00:53.670> they're<00:00:54.000> so<00:00:54.239> close<00:00:54.510> that

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
point is is if they're so close that

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.510 
point is is if they're so close that
they<00:00:54.930> can<00:00:55.079> see<00:00:55.260> a<00:00:55.289> splotch<00:00:55.680> on<00:00:55.949> a<00:00:56.010> goose<00:00:56.309> you

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
they can see a splotch on a goose you

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:57.889 
they can see a splotch on a goose you
should<00:00:56.699> probably<00:00:56.850> be<00:00:57.030> shooting<00:00:57.449> them<00:00:57.600> and<00:00:57.719> not

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
should probably be shooting them and not

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.410 
should probably be shooting them and not
looking<00:00:58.260> at<00:00:58.410> them<00:00:58.609> but<00:00:59.609> what<00:01:00.059> I'm<00:01:00.149> gonna<00:01:00.239> go

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.600 
gonna look like next what we're gonna do
is<00:04:40.480> we're<00:04:40.660> going<00:04:40.750> to<00:04:40.810> use<00:04:41.020> it's<00:04:41.860> a<00:04:41.950> multi<00:04:42.340> color

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:42.610 
is we're going to use it's a multi color

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:44.820 
is we're going to use it's a multi color
which<00:04:43.570> I<00:04:43.720> was<00:04:43.840> a<00:04:43.870> little<00:04:43.930> nervous<00:04:44.260> using

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:44.830 
which I was a little nervous using

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:46.260 
which I was a little nervous using
that's<00:04:44.920> the<00:04:45.100> first<00:04:45.340> kind<00:04:45.580> but<00:04:45.790> works<00:04:45.970> really

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:46.270 
that's the first kind but works really

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:50.730 
that's the first kind but works really
good<00:04:46.660> and<00:04:48.390> it<00:04:49.390> comes<00:04:49.630> out<00:04:49.780> really<00:04:49.840> fast<00:04:50.410> so<00:04:50.710> you

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:50.740 
good and it comes out really fast so you

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:53.010 
good and it comes out really fast so you
got<00:04:50.950> to<00:04:51.010> be<00:04:51.100> careful<00:04:51.250> with<00:04:51.520> this<00:04:51.700> too<00:04:51.970> and<00:04:52.780> the
