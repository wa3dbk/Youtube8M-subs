00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:19.039
 to bomb all boys and so with 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:23.329
 this furniture we are here with the number 30 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:25.900
 if they are many, I returned from vacation 

00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:28.400
 many of you asked when he returns 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:31.399
 guys it's not that if I'm not the type 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:33.980
 papa if you don't have it put me alert 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:36.350
 if I trivially miss you have to check i 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.809
 prices before making the offers 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:42.410
 it's not that you can't trade 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:45.829
 without these, however, I appreciate the fact 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:48.679
 that we missed you and nothing proceeds 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:51.559
 so in today's banner they are always i 

00:00:48.679 --> 00:00:53.449
 three banners I want to keep as long as I have 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:55.699
 time in short I will try to keep the 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:57.920
 three separate banners when the weather 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:59.870
 will start to run out we will return to the 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.659
 in short, a single bar is 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.699
 went to bed or some news of which 

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:06.409
 I would like to talk to you 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:08.270
 the first is that unfortunately the time a 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:11.090
 arrangement is what it is because I have to 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:14.000
 study you know I have exams 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:16.790
 unfortunately then the videos on this 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.520
 channel will basically remain three i 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:21.050
 two of sale 1 on Thursday 1 a 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.810
 Sunday this week of course 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:27.050
 guys a bit out of phase because obviously 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:30.440
 there were holidays plus a video on 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:32.690
 marketing that will be dedicated to sport 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:35.180
 builder we will try to make another one the 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:37.280
 Saturday but I guarantee nothing in 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.590
 how little time I have said 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.860
 we will try to get you the one on 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.450
 pro club on Saturdays wherever it is in the middle 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.870
 of the week we see a moment me 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:50.260
 I congratulate you on the pro club as a fourth 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:52.180
 scared video of 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:55.960
 let's say mine though some actually 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:58.240
 will be given to give the other news e 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:01.300
 which of course this was cataloged 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:03.010
 as negative news the news 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.540
 another positive news is that the 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:06.610
 undersigned has decided to give one 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:09.040
 sprint so I'll try to take it 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.540
 fuck sissimo put within a couple of 

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:12.700
 weeks 

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:14.560
 thus concluding this series in the 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.680
 best of course the series 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.420
 in short, it will not end with the purchase 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.910
 of means as I have told you tens of 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.560
 sometimes I will continue to give you trades 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:27.430
 however, here it is, once it is taken 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.990
 admitted I will be able to slow down and do 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.910
 completely no more every day but 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:33.190
 maybe one day yes 2 no and then 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:35.230
 devote more time to what I owe 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:38.200
 do because the kids in life are there 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.010
 of priorities is certainly scared is not one 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.380
 priority 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.000
 so how is it not youtube then 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.470
 in short, I will try to give but a sprint 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.390
 let's finish it well with his 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.310
 blessed you once taken 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.740
 obviously I can dedicate myself to something else e 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:53.140
 make other series that already decided what 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:56.500
 will surely be sure you are there 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:58.330
 please watch out for the clips because there 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.190
 I remember you don't have to consider it in 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.870
 how many clip prices are some 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.090
 old times a few times no more 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.080
 usable keep in mind only the 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.500
 banner 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:10.750
 I also remind you to consider that I 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:13.660
 against players with all the modules though 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:14.950
 banner pieces are general prices 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:19.300
 consequently when I bought a 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:22.269
 player 4 4 2 4 1 2 1 2 3 5 2 or 4 3 3 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:24.220
 the prices you have to increase because these 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:28.000
 ways allow you to earn more 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:31.120
 when instead you buy 5 21 25 22 1 and 3 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.160
 the blankets or anything else but 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:37.150
 basically those with the 5 call 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:39.130
 so with 5 you will have to decrease and lower 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:42.250
 the price of both purchase and sale 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:44.290
 of 2 300 credits because otherwise not 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.810
 you place the simple fact that they are 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.970
 modules that accuse few and those 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:51.810
 few and use them are also stingy of 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:54.010
 consequently you have to lower prices 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:56.110
 said the other sales forms 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:58.550
 for silvio gone because more or less yes 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:01.200
 they bypass the except for a few exceptions 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:03.420
 every now and then but they are exceptions 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.680
 the summer to find alone you know 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.390
 very well 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:09.060
 another news is that they made me 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:13.020
 note that there is a type on youtube that has 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:15.900
 a channel that sells a guide in which 

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:18.870
 says to sell a method with which I can 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:22.500
 to make millions of credits in one day 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:23.910
 two days then he promises you billions 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.640
 In a month 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:29.190
 obviously you pay 17 18 euros for one 

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:30.540
 similar thing for this life me 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:32.850
 personally where at least mine 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:35.370
 I do not trust the simple fact 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:37.980
 that if I really wanted to make millions 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:40.490
 of credits every day I was in him 

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:42.810
 I would sell them at very low prices 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:45.120
 mameli I would sell as much as the fuck it takes 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:46.980
 if you make millions of credits the fuck you will 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:48.150
 care about making lots of money by selling 

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:50.010
 in the few at a time 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:52.230
 in the twenty so many ago what the 

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:54.120
 competition at bargain prices and ports 

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:56.880
 at least 30 40 euros a day at home 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:59.700
 if he really manages to make millions of 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:02.310
 Gain credits to the game this type 

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:04.740
 instead it becomes even driving but 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:07.350
 honestly if if I had found a 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:09.360
 I did not share this method 

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:12.360
 but in fact I would exploit it by selling 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:15.360
 credits, that is to say, selling them my 3d not of 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:18.180
 certainly selling as a guide to make them too 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:21.990
 because I quote a phrase from a film by 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:25.320
 a famous cartoon is there if everyone 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:27.450
 they are special the same as saying that not 

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:29.220
 nobody is because because obviously if 

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:31.470
 all have in this case too 

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:33.419
 everyone has the lead basically 

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:35.010
 no one will be able to exploit it properly 

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:37.350
 because there will be competition 

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:39.210
 my advice is out of proportion and not 

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:41.280
 get cabaret from this system from 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:43.860
 these systems because in the end I have it 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:46.410
 said if they really work because 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:48.900
 sell them that is the concept if there 

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:51.450
 it exploits one and perhaps exploits selling 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:53.550
 you believe that by not selling in order to do it 

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:55.020
 we came to the banners like 

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:57.900
 you can well see as usual vi 

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:59.580
 remember that they are divided by quantity of 

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:01.180
 credits, however, nothing forbids you of course 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:02.770
 to not pay attention to 

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:05.740
 concrete that I have indicated if you have 

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:07.810
 150,000 credits you can use those 

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:10.389
 of the second banner but also those of the 

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:12.009
 first if you have and 700 thousand can 

00:06:10.389 --> 00:06:14.830
 use those of the third of the second 

00:06:12.009 --> 00:06:16.330
 and of the first marks you have 60,000 nothing there 

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:19.440
 prohibits the use of players from 

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:21.610
 The third thing is that you understand 12 

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:25.030
 while with the players of the first nor 

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:28.780
 complete 20 30 40 in proportion to i 

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:32.020
 obviously different earnings I don't think of 

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:33.970
 having to tell you nothing else but here 

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:35.530
 see now I remembered the prices 

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:36.370
 they are stable therefore even if you but 

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:38.340
 probably also this week 

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:40.870
 will end with these prices he gave you 

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:44.050
 the players are more or less all of them 

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:45.340
 stable the only unstable seems to me and 

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:47.560
 sharaawy and palaces seem to me 

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:49.259
 get ready because they are a bit dancers 

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:51.729
 those prices rise and fall 

00:06:49.259 --> 00:06:54.699
 strangely fast and here we are 

00:06:51.729 --> 00:06:57.430
 here with the images sent of the works 

00:06:54.699 --> 00:07:00.099
 send me users of our two 

00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:01.810
 standard bearers of the day as you see me 

00:07:00.099 --> 00:07:03.729
 thank their own mandate the 

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:05.620
 images and they thank you for having them 

00:07:03.729 --> 00:07:08.229
 help make credits on these 

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:09.789
 images that obviously do me a lot 

00:07:08.229 --> 00:07:11.620
 pleasure I greet you and refer you to the 

00:07:09.789 --> 00:07:14.699
 next video is known see you at 

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:14.699
 next left us
