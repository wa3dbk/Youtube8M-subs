my<00:00:55.260> case<00:00:55.320> I<00:00:55.920> guess<00:00:56.129> they<00:00:56.610> said<00:00:56.910> that<00:00:57.230> the

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230

he took out a lot and there was a lot of

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.450 
he took out a lot and there was a lot of
scar<00:01:03.660> tissue<00:01:03.960> so<00:01:04.140> usually<00:01:04.769> some<00:01:04.979> people<00:01:05.339> who

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460
