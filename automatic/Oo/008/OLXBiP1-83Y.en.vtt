my wall right on that side but the
detail<00:03:21.860> is<00:03:22.190> almost<00:03:22.519> scary<00:03:23.209> when<00:03:23.450> you<00:03:23.540> look<00:03:23.750> at

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.750 
detail is almost scary when you look at
certain<00:03:24.110> things<00:03:24.680> in<00:03:24.890> the<00:03:24.950> painting<00:03:25.430> and<00:03:25.610> then

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
certain things in the painting and then

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.550 
certain things in the painting and then
you<00:03:25.850> I<00:03:26.090> look<00:03:26.360> at<00:03:26.480> my<00:03:26.600> makeup<00:03:26.780> table<00:03:27.260> I'm<00:03:27.350> like

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959 
that thing you know it looks exactly

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:31.960 
that thing you know it looks exactly
like<00:03:30.290> you<00:03:30.739> know<00:03:30.829> this<00:03:31.010> palette<00:03:31.519> or<00:03:31.640> this<00:03:31.790> piece

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
like you know this palette or this piece

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:34.360 
like you know this palette or this piece
of<00:03:32.090> makeup<00:03:32.510> or<00:03:32.810> the<00:03:33.260> mirror<00:03:33.650> the<00:03:33.890> flowers

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370

whatever it all just totally matches up

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:40.180 
whatever it all just totally matches up
so<00:03:37.280> accurately<00:03:37.940> it<00:03:38.450> is<00:03:38.690> almost<00:03:38.989> scary<00:03:39.410> but<00:03:39.890> um

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190
