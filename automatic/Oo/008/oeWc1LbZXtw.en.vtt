00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.530 

we've<00:00:24.800> devised<00:00:25.160> a<00:00:25.340> small<00:00:25.550> experiment<00:00:25.910> called

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:26.540 
we've devised a small experiment called

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:28.960 
we've devised a small experiment called
BPM<00:00:27.020> to<00:00:27.260> which<00:00:27.560> we<00:00:27.770> are<00:00:27.800> conducting<00:00:28.730> here

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:28.970 
BPM to which we are conducting here

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:31.690 
BPM to which we are conducting here
before<00:00:29.540> the<00:00:29.780> initial<00:00:30.260> tests<00:00:30.650> on<00:00:30.800> PP<00:00:31.100> and<00:00:31.220> 5

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:31.700 
before the initial tests on PP and 5

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.870 
before the initial tests on PP and 5
the<00:00:32.300> idea<00:00:32.690> with<00:00:32.930> BPM<00:00:33.380> -<00:00:33.590> is<00:00:33.860> to<00:00:34.190> do<00:00:34.340> a<00:00:34.370> simple

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:34.880 
the idea with BPM - is to do a simple

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.080 
the idea with BPM - is to do a simple
motor<00:00:35.240> which<00:00:35.900> allows<00:00:35.930> us<00:00:36.410> to<00:00:36.620> evaluate<00:00:37.090> some

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:38.090 
motor which allows us to evaluate some

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:41.560 
motor which allows us to evaluate some
additives<00:00:38.600> to<00:00:38.840> the<00:00:39.230> fluid<00:00:39.739> composition<00:00:40.570> the

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:41.570 
additives to the fluid composition the

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.160 
additives to the fluid composition the
few<00:00:41.809> composition<00:00:42.470> to<00:00:43.220> be<00:00:43.370> used<00:00:43.580> in<00:00:44.090> ppm<00:00:44.450> 2<00:00:44.660> ppm

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:45.170 
few composition to be used in ppm 2 ppm

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.210 
few composition to be used in ppm 2 ppm
5<00:00:45.410> and<00:00:45.710> eventually<00:00:46.100> BPM<00:00:46.520> 100<00:00:47.140> is<00:00:48.140> based<00:00:49.010> on

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:49.220 
5 and eventually BPM 100 is based on

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:55.210 
5 and eventually BPM 100 is based on
ethanol<00:00:49.610> and<00:00:51.820> ethanol<00:00:52.820> and<00:00:53.059> water<00:00:54.220> we're

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:55.220 
ethanol and ethanol and water we're

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.310 
ethanol and ethanol and water we're
diluting<00:00:55.400> the<00:00:55.850> the<00:00:56.090> ethanol<00:00:56.420> water<00:00:56.840> to<00:00:57.110> lower

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:57.320 
diluting the the ethanol water to lower

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.530 
diluting the the ethanol water to lower
the<00:00:57.590> combustion<00:00:58.190> temperature<00:00:58.760> and<00:00:58.970> to

00:00:59.530 --> 00:00:59.540 
the combustion temperature and to

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.970 
the combustion temperature and to
enhance<00:00:59.810> the<00:01:00.760> heat<00:01:01.760> capacity<00:01:02.360> of<00:01:02.390> the<00:01:02.510> mixture

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:02.980 
enhance the heat capacity of the mixture

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:07.810 
enhance the heat capacity of the mixture
however<00:01:04.540> water<00:01:05.540> has<00:01:05.840> the<00:01:06.310> downside<00:01:07.310> that<00:01:07.670> it

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:07.820 
however water has the downside that it

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.440 
however water has the downside that it
it<00:01:08.180> lowers<00:01:08.600> the<00:01:08.810> efficiency<00:01:09.350> of<00:01:09.520> the<00:01:10.520> of<00:01:11.270> the

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
it lowers the efficiency of the of the

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.109 
it lowers the efficiency of the of the
combustion<00:01:11.780> so<00:01:12.590> we<00:01:13.130> are<00:01:13.280> evaluating<00:01:13.670> a

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:14.119 
combustion so we are evaluating a

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:16.570 
combustion so we are evaluating a
another<00:01:14.960> approach<00:01:15.320> where<00:01:15.590> we<00:01:15.740> are<00:01:15.950> adding<00:01:16.100> an

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:16.580 
another approach where we are adding an

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:17.530 
another approach where we are adding an
additive<00:01:17.119> called

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:17.540 
additive called

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.010 
additive called
chaos<00:01:18.050> to<00:01:18.890> the<00:01:18.920> fuel<00:01:19.460> mixture<00:01:19.820> and<00:01:20.119> the<00:01:20.780> idea

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.020 
chaos to the fuel mixture and the idea

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.920 
chaos to the fuel mixture and the idea
is<00:01:21.170> that<00:01:21.200> tiers<00:01:21.860> will<00:01:22.130> allow<00:01:22.399> us<00:01:22.580> to<00:01:22.660> lower<00:01:23.660> the

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:23.930 
is that tiers will allow us to lower the

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.320 
is that tiers will allow us to lower the
water<00:01:24.229> content<00:01:24.619> so<00:01:25.130> we<00:01:25.280> hope<00:01:25.430> if<00:01:25.970> it<00:01:26.180> actually

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:26.330 
water content so we hope if it actually

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:27.809 
water content so we hope if it actually
works

the heat transfer from the combustion to
the<00:02:21.290> chamber<00:02:21.769> wall<00:02:21.980> so<00:02:22.970> we<00:02:23.209> know<00:02:23.360> the<00:02:23.569> effect

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
the chamber wall so we know the effect

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.009 
the chamber wall so we know the effect
is<00:02:24.080> there<00:02:24.290> but<00:02:24.680> we<00:02:24.800> don't<00:02:25.010> know<00:02:25.160> how<00:02:25.519> much<00:02:26.019> we

00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:27.019 
is there but we don't know how much we

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:27.820 
is there but we don't know how much we
can<00:02:27.200> expect<00:02:27.319> from<00:02:27.650> it

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
can expect from it

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.300 
can expect from it
and<00:02:28.220> this<00:02:28.910> is<00:02:29.090> exactly<00:02:29.300> what<00:02:29.630> BPM<00:02:30.319> -<00:02:30.500> will<00:02:30.739> test

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
and this is exactly what BPM - will test

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.600 
and this is exactly what BPM - will test
so<00:02:31.970> we've<00:02:32.840> devised<00:02:33.319> this<00:02:33.590> simple<00:02:34.160> throat<00:02:34.430> less

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
so we've devised this simple throat less

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:39.759 
so we've devised this simple throat less
motor<00:02:34.850> and<00:02:36.400> it<00:02:37.400> is<00:02:37.580> throat<00:02:37.880> less<00:02:38.470> due<00:02:39.470> to<00:02:39.650> the

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:39.769 
motor and it is throat less due to the

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:43.870 
motor and it is throat less due to the
fact<00:02:39.980> that<00:02:40.069> we<00:02:40.340> want<00:02:40.640> the<00:02:41.950> a<00:02:42.950> whole<00:02:43.400> range<00:02:43.670> of

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
fact that we want the a whole range of

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.449 
fact that we want the a whole range of
operating<00:02:44.750> pressures<00:02:45.280> throughout<00:02:46.280> the

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
operating pressures throughout the

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:48.610 
operating pressures throughout the
chamber<00:02:46.790> so<00:02:47.000> so<00:02:47.269> in<00:02:47.420> the<00:02:47.780> conventional<00:02:48.319> rocket

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
chamber so so in the conventional rocket

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.789 
chamber so so in the conventional rocket
engine<00:02:48.890> you<00:02:49.280> have<00:02:49.310> the<00:02:49.610> the<00:02:50.000> throat<00:02:50.239> at<00:02:50.480> the<00:02:50.799> as

00:02:51.789 --> 00:02:51.799 
engine you have the the throat at the as

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:55.690 
engine you have the the throat at the as
the<00:02:52.760> constricting<00:02:53.420> point<00:02:53.660> and<00:02:54.519> that<00:02:55.519> means

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
the constricting point and that means

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.300 
the constricting point and that means
that<00:02:55.910> this<00:02:56.660> the<00:02:57.110> throat<00:02:57.380> is<00:02:57.560> the<00:02:57.830> point<00:02:58.069> where

that this the throat is the point where

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.210 
that this the throat is the point where
the<00:02:58.640> flow<00:02:58.850> transitions<00:02:59.510> into<00:03:00.220> supersonic

the chamber contracts into the throat
which<00:03:45.260> is<00:03:45.410> normally<00:03:45.739> the<00:03:45.829> case<00:03:45.980> and<00:03:46.310> is<00:03:46.700> the

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:46.760 
which is normally the case and is the

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.449 
which is normally the case and is the
case<00:03:46.940> in<00:03:47.239> for<00:03:47.420> instance<00:03:47.720> BP<00:03:47.989> and<00:03:48.109> five<00:03:48.459> this

case in for instance BP and five this

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:53.080 
case in for instance BP and five this
means<00:03:49.700> that<00:03:50.230> by<00:03:51.230> putting<00:03:51.700> thermal<00:03:52.700> elements

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.090 
means that by putting thermal elements

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:56.020 
means that by putting thermal elements
at<00:03:53.420> different<00:03:53.840> points<00:03:54.109> on<00:03:54.459> the<00:03:55.459> outside<00:03:55.819> wall

at different points on the outside wall
here<00:03:56.329> we<00:03:57.019> can<00:03:57.230> look<00:03:57.620> at<00:03:57.859> the<00:03:58.190> the<00:03:59.000> heat

00:03:59.289 --> 00:03:59.299 
here we can look at the the heat

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:02.229 
here we can look at the the heat
transfer<00:04:00.459> at<00:04:01.459> different<00:04:01.910> operating

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:02.239

pressures<00:04:02.660> in<00:04:02.900> the<00:04:03.109> same<00:04:03.350> same<00:04:04.130> motor<00:04:04.489> run<00:04:04.870> so

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
pressures in the same same motor run so

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:09.520 
pressures in the same same motor run so

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530 
ideally what we are gonna do in ppm two

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:12.250 
ideally what we are gonna do in ppm two
is<00:04:09.799> to<00:04:10.100> do<00:04:10.280> a<00:04:10.549> series<00:04:11.209> of<00:04:11.269> tests<00:04:11.810> with

is to do a series of tests with
different

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:10.010 
temperature point will be far beyond

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:12.340 
temperature point will be far beyond
what<00:05:10.280> the<00:05:10.370> two<00:05:10.520> can<00:05:10.760> withstand<00:05:11.350> so

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:12.350 
what the two can withstand so

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:14.830 
what the two can withstand so
essentially<00:05:12.710> the<00:05:12.950> tube<00:05:13.160> will<00:05:13.550> break<00:05:13.780> if<00:05:14.780> you

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:14.840 
essentially the tube will break if you

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:19.510 
essentially the tube will break if you
were<00:05:15.020> allowed<00:05:15.410> to<00:05:15.650> run<00:05:15.800> for<00:05:16.160> long<00:05:16.430> enough<00:05:18.520> the

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:19.520 
were allowed to run for long enough the

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.330 
were allowed to run for long enough the
concept<00:05:20.030> then<00:05:20.240> is<00:05:20.630> that<00:05:21.260> adding<00:05:21.740> tears<00:05:22.040> to

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:22.340 
concept then is that adding tears to

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:27.100 
concept then is that adding tears to
this<00:05:22.490> mixture<00:05:23.169> will<00:05:24.580> retard<00:05:25.580> this<00:05:26.110> evolution

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:27.110 
this mixture will retard this evolution

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:29.170 
this mixture will retard this evolution
in<00:05:27.200> temperature<00:05:27.620> somewhat<00:05:28.010> so<00:05:28.640> instead<00:05:29.120> of

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:29.180 
in temperature somewhat so instead of

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:30.760 
in temperature somewhat so instead of
getting<00:05:29.419> this<00:05:29.900> ramp<00:05:30.169> you<00:05:30.440> will<00:05:30.590> get<00:05:30.740> a

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:30.770 
getting this ramp you will get a

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:32.610 
getting this ramp you will get a
different<00:05:31.070> rail

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:32.620 
different rail

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:36.969 
different rail
presumably<00:05:33.620> a<00:05:33.919> slower<00:05:34.190> way<00:05:34.400> and<00:05:34.669> a<00:05:35.770> offset<00:05:36.770> in

00:05:36.969 --> 00:05:36.979 
presumably a slower way and a offset in

00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:39.340 
presumably a slower way and a offset in
your<00:05:37.190> stagnating<00:05:37.850> temperature<00:05:38.240> still<00:05:39.140> the

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:39.350 
your stagnating temperature still the

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:41.560 
your stagnating temperature still the
temperature<00:05:40.130> here<00:05:40.280> will<00:05:40.460> be<00:05:40.610> too<00:05:40.880> high<00:05:41.060> so<00:05:41.390> the

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:41.570 
temperature here will be too high so the

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:43.300 
temperature here will be too high so the
tube<00:05:41.750> will<00:05:41.930> still<00:05:42.140> fail<00:05:42.380> but<00:05:42.950> it<00:05:43.100> should

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:43.310 
tube will still fail but it should

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:45.550 
tube will still fail but it should
survive<00:05:43.580> a<00:05:43.640> little<00:05:43.850> longer<00:05:44.000> and<00:05:44.419> this<00:05:45.050> Delta

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:45.560 
survive a little longer and this Delta

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:48.730 
survive a little longer and this Delta
in<00:05:45.770> temperature<00:05:46.610> and<00:05:46.850> in<00:05:47.120> ingredient<00:05:47.930> will

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:48.740 
in temperature and in ingredient will

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:52.510 
in temperature and in ingredient will
allow<00:05:49.280> us<00:05:49.460> to<00:05:49.510> quantize<00:05:50.510> the<00:05:51.190> heat<00:05:52.190> transfer

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:52.520 
allow us to quantize the heat transfer

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:55.120 
allow us to quantize the heat transfer
coefficient<00:05:53.080> so<00:05:54.080> from<00:05:54.530> from<00:05:54.680> this<00:05:54.890> simple

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:55.130 
coefficient so from from this simple

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:59.080 
coefficient so from from this simple
experiment<00:05:55.550> we<00:05:55.910> can<00:05:56.120> evaluate<00:05:56.680> what<00:05:58.090> how

00:05:59.080 --> 00:05:59.090 
experiment we can evaluate what how

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:01.450 
experiment we can evaluate what how
efficient<00:05:59.630> is<00:05:59.810> tears<00:06:00.530> what<00:06:01.070> the<00:06:01.190> tears

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:01.460 
efficient is tears what the tears

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:04.630 
efficient is tears what the tears

we're<00:06:07.940> going<00:06:08.120> to<00:06:08.210> do<00:06:08.330> a<00:06:08.360> whole<00:06:08.870> range<00:06:08.900> of

we're going to do a whole range of
