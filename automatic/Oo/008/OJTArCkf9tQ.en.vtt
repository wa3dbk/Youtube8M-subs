00:02:15.789 --> 00:02:15.799 
chicken and I say poached because I

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:18.039 
chicken and I say poached because I
gently<00:02:16.280> simmered<00:02:16.970> this<00:02:17.150> in<00:02:17.360> chicken<00:02:17.870> stock

00:02:18.039 --> 00:02:18.049

gently simmered this in chicken stock
which<00:02:18.769> is<00:02:18.950> going<00:02:19.069> to<00:02:19.130> keep<00:02:19.430> the<00:02:19.700> flavor<00:02:20.000> of<00:02:20.180> the

00:02:20.259 --> 00:02:20.269 
which is going to keep the flavor of the

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:23.440 
which is going to keep the flavor of the
chicken<00:02:20.420> intact<00:02:21.049> and<00:02:21.410> I'd<00:02:21.860> let<00:02:22.340> it<00:02:22.450> simmer

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.560 
chicken intact and I'd let it simmer

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:28.630 
rather than boil and since it's cooked
it<00:02:26.780> can<00:02:26.930> go<00:02:27.109> and<00:02:27.290> right<00:02:27.440> at<00:02:27.560> the<00:02:27.680> end<00:02:27.859> and<00:02:28.130> now

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
it can go and right at the end and now

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.130 
it can go and right at the end and now
we're<00:02:28.880> going<00:02:29.060> to<00:02:29.209> top<00:02:29.420> it<00:02:29.450> with<00:02:29.660> our<00:02:29.780> cheddar

because of the heat missus there's some

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:51.740 
because of the heat missus there's some
heat<00:03:49.110> so<00:03:49.680> my<00:03:49.800> first<00:03:50.040> choice<00:03:50.310> is<00:03:51.150> a<00:03:51.209> Riesling

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
okay now this is a reasoning with a

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:55.580 
okay now this is a reasoning with a
little<00:03:54.570> bit<00:03:54.660> of<00:03:54.750> sweetness<00:03:55.140> do<00:03:55.380> it<00:03:55.440> a<00:03:55.470> little
