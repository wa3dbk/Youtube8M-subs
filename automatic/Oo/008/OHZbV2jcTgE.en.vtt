00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.200 
and collect gems and so on and so forth
now<00:01:29.009> I've<00:01:29.189> mentioned<00:01:29.400> floating<00:01:29.880> around<00:01:29.970> and

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
now I've mentioned floating around and

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.819 
now I've mentioned floating around and
collecting<00:01:30.509> gems<00:01:30.810> a<00:01:30.900> couple<00:01:31.200> times<00:01:31.380> and<00:01:31.619> the

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
collecting gems a couple times and the

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:32.810 
collecting gems a couple times and the
reason<00:01:32.070> I<00:01:32.100> mentioned<00:01:32.369> that<00:01:32.430> is<00:01:32.549> because

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
reason I mentioned that is because

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.300 
reason I mentioned that is because
there's<00:01:33.030> an<00:01:33.150> RPG<00:01:33.659> element<00:01:34.079> to<00:01:34.799> gravity<00:01:35.159> rush

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
there's an RPG element to gravity rush

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.440 
there's an RPG element to gravity rush
as<00:01:35.460> well<00:01:35.610> you<00:01:35.729> can<00:01:35.880> go<00:01:36.060> around<00:01:36.180> and<00:01:36.360> collect

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
as well you can go around and collect

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.230 
as well you can go around and collect
gems<00:01:37.079> and<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:38.280> more<00:01:38.430> gems<00:01:38.610> you<00:01:38.729> get<00:01:38.909> your<00:01:39.030> able

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
gems and the more gems you get your able

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.060 
gems and the more gems you get your able
to<00:01:39.329> level<00:01:39.689> up<00:01:39.840> your<00:01:39.869> character<00:01:40.020> cat<00:01:40.710> and

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
to level up your character cat and

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.609 
to level up your character cat and
you're<00:01:41.700> able<00:01:41.939> to<00:01:42.150> you<00:01:42.840> know<00:01:42.930> add<00:01:43.110> special

you're able to you know add special

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.289 
you're able to you know add special
powers<00:01:44.100> whether<00:01:44.310> it<00:01:44.430> be<00:01:44.520> your<00:01:44.729> gravity<00:01:45.119> kick

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
powers whether it be your gravity kick

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:46.819 
powers whether it be your gravity kick
does<00:01:45.570> more<00:01:45.780> damage<00:01:45.810> or<00:01:46.380> you're<00:01:46.500> able<00:01:46.649> to<00:01:46.710> get

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
voice acting or anything so you have to

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:09.830 
voice acting or anything so you have to

use your imagination a little bit but

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.690 
use your imagination a little bit but
it's<00:02:10.590> actually<00:02:10.890> done<00:02:11.039> really<00:02:11.459> really<00:02:11.489> well

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700

and charming in the way they tell the

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:16.890 
and charming in the way they tell the
stories<00:02:15.489> through<00:02:15.670> the<00:02:15.760> comic<00:02:16.090> book<00:02:16.299> setting<00:02:16.750> I

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
stories through the comic book setting I

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:17.940 
stories through the comic book setting I
really<00:02:17.319> enjoyed<00:02:17.349> I<00:02:17.680> thought<00:02:17.799> it<00:02:17.890> was

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
really enjoyed I thought it was

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:19.619 
really enjoyed I thought it was
different<00:02:18.159> way<00:02:18.370> to<00:02:18.400> do<00:02:18.610> it<00:02:18.790> and<00:02:18.970> it<00:02:19.420> definitely

00:02:19.619 --> 00:02:19.629 
different way to do it and it definitely

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:21.720 
different way to do it and it definitely
got<00:02:19.840> the<00:02:19.989> point<00:02:20.200> across<00:02:20.260> so<00:02:20.470> so<00:02:21.069> few<00:02:21.370> hours<00:02:21.610> in

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
got the point across so so few hours in

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.550 
got the point across so so few hours in
the<00:02:21.819> gravity<00:02:22.180> rush<00:02:22.329> so<00:02:22.629> far<00:02:22.870> so<00:02:23.110> good<00:02:23.140> the

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
the gravity rush so far so good the

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.500 
the gravity rush so far so good the
controls<00:02:23.950> are<00:02:24.129> still<00:02:24.430> a<00:02:24.459> little<00:02:24.819> wonky<00:02:25.269> I

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
controls are still a little wonky I

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.360 
controls are still a little wonky I
don't<00:02:25.810> know<00:02:25.870> if<00:02:25.959> it's<00:02:26.110> me<00:02:26.319> or<00:02:26.349> if<00:02:26.860> the<00:02:27.189> game

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
don't know if it's me or if the game

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.160 
don't know if it's me or if the game
just<00:02:27.670> it's<00:02:27.939> just<00:02:28.000> not<00:02:28.299> going<00:02:28.450> to<00:02:28.510> control<00:02:28.900> with

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
just it's just not going to control with

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.319 
just it's just not going to control with
the<00:02:29.379> precision<00:02:29.769> that<00:02:30.579> I<00:02:30.640> would<00:02:30.849> like<00:02:30.939> it<00:02:31.150> too

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:31.329 
the precision that I would like it too

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:33.059 
the precision that I would like it too
so<00:02:31.569> maybe<00:02:31.750> it's<00:02:31.989> me<00:02:32.109> and<00:02:32.379> we'll<00:02:32.739> get<00:02:32.890> better

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:33.069 
so maybe it's me and we'll get better

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:34.500 
so maybe it's me and we'll get better
with<00:02:33.250> a<00:02:33.280> little<00:02:33.370> bit<00:02:33.609> of<00:02:33.670> practice<00:02:34.150> but

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
with a little bit of practice but

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.509 
with a little bit of practice but
overall<00:02:34.780> that's<00:02:35.079> been<00:02:35.409> my<00:02:35.890> only<00:02:36.040> real<00:02:36.370> issue

00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:36.519 
overall that's been my only real issue

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:38.250 
overall that's been my only real issue
with<00:02:36.760> it<00:02:36.879> so<00:02:37.030> far<00:02:37.060> I've<00:02:37.420> enjoyed<00:02:37.689> the<00:02:37.870> game<00:02:38.019> so

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
with it so far I've enjoyed the game so

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.170 
with it so far I've enjoyed the game so
I<00:02:38.290> have<00:02:38.829> more<00:02:39.010> videos<00:02:39.340> up<00:02:39.370> a<00:02:39.640> little<00:02:39.849> bit<00:02:39.939> later

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
I have more videos up a little bit later

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:41.849 
I have more videos up a little bit later
we'll<00:02:40.870> keep<00:02:41.019> progressing<00:02:41.140> through<00:02:41.620> it<00:02:41.709> and

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:41.859 
we'll keep progressing through it and

00:02:41.859 --> 00:02:43.289 
we'll keep progressing through it and
that's<00:02:42.189> it<00:02:42.280> guys<00:02:42.430> leave<00:02:42.670> me<00:02:42.790> comments<00:02:42.970> let<00:02:43.269> me

00:02:43.289 --> 00:02:43.299 
that's it guys leave me comments let me

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:44.520 
that's it guys leave me comments let me
know<00:02:43.390> if<00:02:43.540> you<00:02:43.629> got<00:02:43.750> gravity<00:02:44.109> rush<00:02:44.319> you're

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
know if you got gravity rush you're

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.110 
know if you got gravity rush you're
thinking<00:02:44.709> about<00:02:44.739> picking<00:02:45.010> it<00:02:45.189> up<00:02:45.280> what<00:02:46.090> you

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
thinking about picking it up what you

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.059 
thinking about picking it up what you
think<00:02:46.420> of<00:02:46.480> it<00:02:46.599> so<00:02:46.659> far<00:02:46.810> and<00:02:47.139> will<00:02:47.709> keep<00:02:47.859> playing

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:48.069 
think of it so far and will keep playing

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:51.389 
think of it so far and will keep playing
