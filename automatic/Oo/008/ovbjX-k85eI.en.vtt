00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
this case was the fact that did not come

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.090 
this case was the fact that did not come
at<00:00:42.390> a<00:00:42.510> screen<00:00:42.809> protector<00:00:42.989> being<00:00:43.620> a<00:00:43.739> rugged

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
at a screen protector being a rugged

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.600 
at a screen protector being a rugged
case<00:00:44.420> but<00:00:45.420> now<00:00:45.719> because<00:00:46.230> of<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.680> iphone<00:00:46.980> 5s

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
case but now because of the iphone 5s

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.600 
case but now because of the iphone 5s
and<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.719> fingerprint<00:00:49.350> sensor<00:00:50.039> on<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.430> home

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
and the fingerprint sensor on the home

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.700 
and the fingerprint sensor on the home
button<00:00:50.640> this<00:00:51.360> is<00:00:51.539> actually<00:00:52.050> a<00:00:52.079> perfect<00:00:52.469> case

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
button this is actually a perfect case

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.529 
button this is actually a perfect case
because<00:00:53.129> it<00:00:53.280> doesn't<00:00:53.640> have<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:54.120> screen

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
because it doesn't have the screen

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.389 
because it doesn't have the screen
protector<00:00:55.020> so<00:00:55.170> you<00:00:55.289> can<00:00:55.440> use<00:00:55.649> that<00:00:55.890> its

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
protector so you can use that its

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.970 
protector so you can use that its
greatest<00:00:56.850> weakness<00:00:57.449> now<00:00:57.660> becomes<00:00:58.170> a<00:00:58.379> string

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
greatest weakness now becomes a string

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.369 
greatest weakness now becomes a string
with<00:00:59.430> all<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.670> case<00:00:59.879> reviews<00:01:00.270> that<00:01:00.449> we<00:01:00.480> do<00:01:00.750> we

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
with all the case reviews that we do we

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.740 
with all the case reviews that we do we
buy<00:01:02.250> these<00:01:02.460> cases<00:01:02.879> and<00:01:03.059> we<00:01:03.149> use<00:01:03.300> them<00:01:03.329> and<00:01:03.629> then

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
buy these cases and we use them and then

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.479 
buy these cases and we use them and then
we<00:01:03.870> rate<00:01:04.049> them<00:01:04.229> so<00:01:04.409> each<00:01:04.619> case<00:01:04.890> we<00:01:05.040> use<00:01:05.220> for<00:01:05.400> at

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
we rate them so each case we use for at

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.460 
we rate them so each case we use for at
least<00:01:05.640> a<00:01:05.850> week<00:01:06.000> and<00:01:06.240> we<00:01:06.780> can<00:01:06.810> definitely<00:01:07.140> tell

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
least a week and we can definitely tell

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.370 
least a week and we can definitely tell
you<00:01:07.680> that<00:01:08.310> this<00:01:08.549> case<00:01:08.880> is<00:01:09.180> pretty<00:01:10.110> tough

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
you that this case is pretty tough

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.160 
you that this case is pretty tough
because<00:01:10.530> well<00:01:11.450> we've<00:01:12.450> dropped<00:01:12.689> it<00:01:12.869> many<00:01:13.110> many

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
because well we've dropped it many many

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:22.070 
because well we've dropped it many many
times<00:01:14.810> it's<00:01:15.810> her<00:01:15.930> phone<00:01:18.830> still<00:01:19.830> recording<00:01:21.080> so

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
times it's her phone still recording so

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.840 
times it's her phone still recording so
this<00:01:22.229> case<00:01:22.619> actually<00:01:22.890> comes<00:01:23.369> in<00:01:23.520> three

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
this case actually comes in three

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.460 
this case actually comes in three
different<00:01:23.880> pieces<00:01:24.509> and<00:01:24.900> it's<00:01:25.140> held<00:01:25.350> together

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
different pieces and it's held together

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.550 
different pieces and it's held together
by<00:01:25.950> six<00:01:26.729> screws<00:01:27.060> and<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.900> main<00:01:28.110> piece<00:01:28.380> is

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
by six screws and the main piece is

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.410 
by six screws and the main piece is
actually<00:01:28.890> this<00:01:29.009> black<00:01:29.549> rubber<00:01:29.939> thing<00:01:30.240> and

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
actually this black rubber thing and

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.090 
actually this black rubber thing and
install<00:01:31.079> in<00:01:31.170> this<00:01:31.200> case<00:01:31.470> is<00:01:31.650> actually<00:01:31.920> kind<00:01:32.070> of

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
install in this case is actually kind of

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.740 
install in this case is actually kind of
painful<00:01:32.369> because<00:01:32.610> these<00:01:33.119> screws<00:01:33.450> you<00:01:33.509> gotta

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
painful because these screws you gotta

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.140 
painful because these screws you gotta
we<00:01:34.650> review<00:01:34.979> cases<00:01:35.220> so<00:01:35.520> we<00:01:35.579> got<00:01:35.729> to<00:01:35.820> take<00:01:35.970> our

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
we review cases so we got to take our

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.550 
we review cases so we got to take our
phones<00:01:36.329> in<00:01:36.600> and<00:01:36.750> out<00:01:36.840> of<00:01:36.960> these<00:01:37.020> cases<00:01:37.259> all<00:01:37.530> the

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
phones in and out of these cases all the

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.499 
phones in and out of these cases all the
time<00:01:37.680> and<00:01:37.979> it's<00:01:38.100> so<00:01:38.250> painful<00:01:38.790> to<00:01:38.820> take<00:01:39.119> it<00:01:39.299> out

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
time and it's so painful to take it out

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.170 
time and it's so painful to take it out
of<00:01:39.540> this<00:01:39.869> case<00:01:40.320> but<00:01:41.100> it<00:01:41.280> does<00:01:41.460> offer<00:01:41.729> a<00:01:41.909> lot<00:01:42.060> of

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
of this case but it does offer a lot of

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.850 
of this case but it does offer a lot of
drop<00:01:42.360> protection<00:01:42.570> but<00:01:43.110> it<00:01:43.200> also<00:01:43.350> offers<00:01:43.829> a

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
drop protection but it also offers a

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.740 
drop protection but it also offers a
minimal<00:01:44.310> amount<00:01:44.369> of<00:01:44.610> water<00:01:44.850> resistance<00:01:45.450> so

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
minimal amount of water resistance so

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.469 
minimal amount of water resistance so
don't<00:01:46.470> go<00:01:46.619> swimming<00:01:46.979> with<00:01:47.070> this<00:01:47.220> at<00:01:47.369> all<00:01:47.700> don't
