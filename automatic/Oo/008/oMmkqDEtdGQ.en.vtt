know<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.280> round<00:02:08.520> of<00:02:08.640> eight<00:02:08.879> I<00:02:09.179> think<00:02:09.390> was<00:02:09.660> the

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
know the round of eight I think was the

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.080 
know the round of eight I think was the
last<00:02:09.989> time<00:02:10.259> was<00:02:10.860> the<00:02:10.950> last<00:02:11.099> thing<00:02:11.250> he<00:02:11.310> got<00:02:11.520> the

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
last time was the last thing he got the

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.490 
last time was the last thing he got the
farthest<00:02:12.420> he<00:02:12.510> got<00:02:12.660> recently

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
farthest he got recently

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.380 
farthest he got recently
generally<00:02:13.950> just<00:02:14.100> in<00:02:14.220> the<00:02:14.310> round<00:02:14.460> of<00:02:14.490> 32<00:02:14.610> or<00:02:14.970> 16

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
generally just in the round of 32 or 16

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.000 
generally just in the round of 32 or 16
into<00:02:16.050> pretty<00:02:16.200> much<00:02:16.260> every<00:02:16.560> star<00:02:16.740> league<00:02:16.920> by

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
into pretty much every star league by

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.680 
into pretty much every star league by
the<00:02:17.070> way<00:02:17.220> and<00:02:17.430> he<00:02:17.640> gets<00:02:17.790> defeated<00:02:18.060> by<00:02:18.300> someone

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
the way and he gets defeated by someone

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.630 
the way and he gets defeated by someone
so<00:02:19.230> maybe<00:02:19.500> it's<00:02:19.680> a<00:02:19.710> combination<00:02:19.920> of<00:02:20.190> bad<00:02:20.400> luck

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
so maybe it's a combination of bad luck

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.570 
so maybe it's a combination of bad luck
or<00:02:20.940> perhaps<00:02:21.480> just<00:02:21.780> uh<00:02:22.050> just<00:02:22.410> not<00:02:23.160> quite<00:02:23.520> there

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
or perhaps just uh just not quite there

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.220 
or perhaps just uh just not quite there
in<00:02:24.000> play<00:02:24.270> even<00:02:24.510> though<00:02:24.600> his<00:02:24.750> win<00:02:24.930> rate<00:02:24.960> is

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
in play even though his win rate is

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.650 
in play even though his win rate is
fairly<00:02:25.710> high<00:02:26.060> statistically<00:02:27.060> he<00:02:27.450> just

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
fairly high statistically he just

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.660 
fairly high statistically he just
doesn't<00:02:27.960> seem<00:02:28.080> to<00:02:28.110> have<00:02:28.350> the<00:02:28.380> the<00:02:29.100> hot<00:02:29.250> spot<00:02:29.490> or

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
doesn't seem to have the the hot spot or

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.760 
doesn't seem to have the the hot spot or
whatever<00:02:29.760> it<00:02:30.060> is<00:02:30.120> needed<00:02:30.480> to<00:02:30.750> to<00:02:31.440> win<00:02:31.620> the<00:02:31.740> game

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
whatever it is needed to to win the game

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.980 
whatever it is needed to to win the game
and<00:02:32.150> you<00:02:33.150> know<00:02:33.270> we're<00:02:33.570> going<00:02:33.690> to<00:02:33.750> see<00:02:33.870> what

and you know we're going to see what

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:37.190 
and you know we're going to see what
happens<00:02:34.320> though<00:02:34.470> this<00:02:35.310> is<00:02:35.550> the<00:02:35.580> round<00:02:36.030> of<00:02:36.200> 64

from<00:03:03.930> the<00:03:04.080> offline<00:03:04.440> preliminaries<00:03:05.040> so<00:03:05.459> he

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
from the offline preliminaries so he

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.690 
from the offline preliminaries so he
also<00:03:05.970> as<00:03:06.300> well<00:03:06.450> had<00:03:06.660> to<00:03:06.780> win<00:03:06.959> a<00:03:07.250> round<00:03:08.250> of<00:03:08.459> eight

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
preliminaries and perhaps even earlier

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:14.930

there<00:03:13.650> were<00:03:13.770> other<00:03:13.920> games<00:03:14.190> just<00:03:14.459> again<00:03:14.670> into

the offline preliminaries I don't know

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:17.870

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
maybe he would just seated was seated at

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.789 
maybe he would just seated was seated at

to<00:06:02.850> go<00:06:03.060> for<00:06:03.240> the<00:06:03.270> aggressive<00:06:03.570> strategy<00:06:04.169> this

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:04.320 
to go for the aggressive strategy this

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:06.890 
to go for the aggressive strategy this
is<00:06:04.440> what<00:06:05.010> saviors<00:06:05.520> to<00:06:05.640> do<00:06:05.760> I'm<00:06:06.030> used<00:06:06.630> to<00:06:06.690> not

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:06.900 
is what saviors to do I'm used to not

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:08.750 
is what saviors to do I'm used to not
build<00:06:07.050> some<00:06:07.350> pins<00:06:07.530> instead<00:06:07.830> he<00:06:08.010> do<00:06:08.130> slings<00:06:08.520> to

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:08.760 
build some pins instead he do slings to

trap<00:06:09.240> the<00:06:09.510> medic<00:06:10.470> marine<00:06:10.710> some<00:06:10.890> quarters<00:06:11.160> you

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:11.430 
trap the medic marine some quarters you

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:12.650 
trap the medic marine some quarters you
know<00:06:11.520> that's<00:06:11.700> so<00:06:11.820> much<00:06:11.940> more<00:06:12.090> of<00:06:12.150> an<00:06:12.270> effective

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:12.660 
know that's so much more of an effective

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:14.710 
know that's so much more of an effective
method<00:06:12.810> however<00:06:13.440> it<00:06:13.770> is<00:06:13.860> more<00:06:14.070> dangerous

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:14.720 
method however it is more dangerous

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:17.420 
method however it is more dangerous
because<00:06:15.720> if<00:06:15.960> you're<00:06:16.110> obviously<00:06:17.070> if<00:06:17.280> your

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:17.430 
because if you're obviously if your

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:19.250 
because if you're obviously if your
links<00:06:17.700> don't<00:06:18.210> get<00:06:18.390> that<00:06:18.600> you<00:06:18.810> will<00:06:18.960> certainly

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:19.260 
links don't get that you will certainly

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:20.719 
links don't get that you will certainly
lose<00:06:19.590> your<00:06:19.650> main<00:06:19.950> and<00:06:20.280> you'll<00:06:20.430> just<00:06:20.550> lose<00:06:20.669> the

00:06:20.719 --> 00:06:20.729 
lose your main and you'll just lose the

00:06:20.729 --> 00:06:23.480 
lose your main and you'll just lose the
game<00:06:21.080> whereas<00:06:22.080> the<00:06:22.200> sunken<00:06:22.560> usually<00:06:23.070> can<00:06:23.220> hold

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:23.490 
game whereas the sunken usually can hold

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:24.710 
game whereas the sunken usually can hold
I<00:06:23.669> mean<00:06:23.820> if<00:06:23.880> you<00:06:23.940> put<00:06:24.090> some<00:06:24.270> guns<00:06:24.419> up<00:06:24.540> at<00:06:24.630> the

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:24.720 
I mean if you put some guns up at the

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:25.790 
I mean if you put some guns up at the
correct<00:06:24.870> time<00:06:25.080> they'll<00:06:25.320> pretty<00:06:25.440> much<00:06:25.530> always

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:25.800 
correct time they'll pretty much always

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:29.300 
correct time they'll pretty much always
hold<00:06:26.180> but<00:06:27.180> they<00:06:27.510> won't<00:06:27.690> be<00:06:27.810> a<00:06:27.840> much<00:06:28.050> use<00:06:28.310> it

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:29.310 
hold but they won't be a much use it

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:31.850 
hold but they won't be a much use it
once<00:06:29.760> you<00:06:29.850> hold<00:06:29.970> off<00:06:30.120> that<00:06:30.300> rush<00:06:30.620> it<00:06:31.620> looks

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:31.860 
once you hold off that rush it looks

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:33.680 
once you hold off that rush it looks
