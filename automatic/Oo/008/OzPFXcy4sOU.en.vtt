meeting<00:02:27.069> with<00:02:27.189> a<00:02:27.219> prospect<00:02:27.989> the<00:02:28.989> one<00:02:29.140> thing<00:02:29.319> I

00:02:29.369 --> 00:02:29.379 
meeting with a prospect the one thing I

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:31.379 
meeting with a prospect the one thing I
can<00:02:29.650> say<00:02:29.920> is<00:02:30.129> if<00:02:30.310> somebody<00:02:30.670> is<00:02:30.760> just<00:02:30.790> really

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:31.389 
can say is if somebody is just really

00:02:31.389 --> 00:02:33.569 
can say is if somebody is just really
harping<00:02:31.840> on<00:02:31.900> the<00:02:32.019> price<00:02:32.260> thing<00:02:32.709> is<00:02:32.920> give<00:02:33.489> them

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:33.579 
harping on the price thing is give them

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:35.610 
harping on the price thing is give them
a<00:02:33.760> range<00:02:34.030> that<00:02:34.209> you<00:02:34.389> work<00:02:34.629> with<00:02:34.840> it<00:02:34.989> so<00:02:35.109> you

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
a range that you work with it so you

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.140 
a range that you work with it so you
could<00:02:35.769> say<00:02:35.950> you<00:02:36.189> know<00:02:36.280> my<00:02:36.459> project<00:02:36.879> typically

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
could say you know my project typically

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.780 
could say you know my project typically
costs<00:02:37.599> from<00:02:37.750> 3,000<00:02:38.530> to<00:02:38.560> 30,000<00:02:39.310> right<00:02:39.459> so

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
costs from 3,000 to 30,000 right so

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:40.890 
costs from 3,000 to 30,000 right so
you're<00:02:39.909> kind<00:02:40.030> of<00:02:40.120> giving<00:02:40.389> them<00:02:40.540> this<00:02:40.719> like

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
you're kind of giving them this like

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.839 
you're kind of giving them this like
ballpark<00:02:41.500> range<00:02:41.829> that's<00:02:42.099> all<00:02:42.310> over<00:02:42.549> the<00:02:42.639> map

00:02:42.839 --> 00:02:42.849 
ballpark range that's all over the map

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:44.459 
ballpark range that's all over the map
but<00:02:43.090> at<00:02:43.420> the<00:02:43.480> same<00:02:43.629> time<00:02:43.900> that<00:02:44.109> might<00:02:44.230> kind<00:02:44.379> of

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:44.469 
but at the same time that might kind of

00:02:44.469 --> 00:02:46.259 
but at the same time that might kind of
go<00:02:44.620> yeah<00:02:45.189> I'm<00:02:45.340> in<00:02:45.459> the<00:02:45.519> right<00:02:45.670> place<00:02:45.939> for<00:02:45.969> the

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:03.819
