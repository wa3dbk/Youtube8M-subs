matte finish wheels and I've talked

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.310 
matte finish wheels and I've talked
about<00:01:18.550> I<00:01:18.670> use<00:01:19.000> these<00:01:19.210> on<00:01:19.390> my<00:01:19.510> wheel<00:01:19.750> cleaning

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:20.320 
about I use these on my wheel cleaning

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
about I use these on my wheel cleaning
demo<00:01:21.010> they're<00:01:21.550> a<00:01:21.580> pain<00:01:22.060> in<00:01:22.360> the<00:01:22.480> butt<00:01:23.340> versus

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340 
demo they're a pain in the butt versus

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.900 
demo they're a pain in the butt versus
the<00:01:24.580> black<00:01:24.970> smooth<00:01:25.710> shiny<00:01:26.710> wheels<00:01:27.130> these<00:01:27.610> have

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:27.910 
the black smooth shiny wheels these have

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:30.600 
the black smooth shiny wheels these have
a<00:01:27.940> slight<00:01:28.420> texture<00:01:28.960> to<00:01:29.260> them<00:01:29.380> and<00:01:29.650> hence<00:01:30.340> the

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:30.610 
a slight texture to them and hence the

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.420 
a slight texture to them and hence the

right around the edge this polished lip
now<00:01:39.490> because<00:01:39.909> of<00:01:40.060> my<00:01:40.180> wheel<00:01:40.420> cleaner<00:01:40.780> which<00:01:41.170> is

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:41.440 
now because of my wheel cleaner which is

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.360 
now because of my wheel cleaner which is
acid<00:01:42.310> based<00:01:42.670> and<00:01:43.890> that<00:01:44.890> is<00:01:45.040> a<00:01:45.070> whole<00:01:45.340> nother

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:45.370

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:47.250 
acid based and that is a whole nother
different<00:01:45.790> discussion<00:01:46.630> so<00:01:46.840> check<00:01:47.080> out<00:01:47.229> that

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:47.260 
different discussion so check out that

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.700 
different discussion so check out that
video<00:01:48.040> as<00:01:48.550> to<00:01:49.030> why<00:01:49.479> on<00:01:49.720> earth<00:01:49.960> Daren<00:01:50.680> would

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:50.710 
video as to why on earth Daren would

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.430 
video as to why on earth Daren would
choose<00:01:51.130> an<00:01:51.430> acid<00:01:51.820> base<00:01:52.060> wheel<00:01:52.420> cleaner<00:01:52.720> well

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:53.440 
choose an acid base wheel cleaner well

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.860 
choose an acid base wheel cleaner well
there's<00:01:53.680> some<00:01:53.830> very<00:01:53.860> specific<00:01:54.670> reasons<00:01:55.090> but

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:55.870 
there's some very specific reasons but

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:58.710 
there's some very specific reasons but
if<00:01:55.990> you<00:01:56.110> look<00:01:56.290> at<00:01:56.440> this<00:01:56.700> wheel<00:01:57.700> perimeter<00:01:58.450> this

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:58.720 
if you look at this wheel perimeter this

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.640 
if you look at this wheel perimeter this
little<00:01:59.080> polished<00:01:59.530> lip<00:01:59.860> I<00:02:00.960> know<00:02:01.960> that<00:02:02.260> it<00:02:02.409> has

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:02.650 
little polished lip I know that it has

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:06.000 
little polished lip I know that it has
some<00:02:03.010> coating<00:02:03.520> on<00:02:03.640> it<00:02:03.670> if<00:02:04.030> it<00:02:04.180> did<00:02:04.390> not<00:02:05.010> unless

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:06.010 
some coating on it if it did not unless

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:08.699 
some coating on it if it did not unless
this<00:02:06.280> was<00:02:06.460> perhaps<00:02:06.670> a<00:02:07.090> forged<00:02:07.810> magnesium

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709 
this was perhaps a forged magnesium

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:11.940 
this was perhaps a forged magnesium
wheel<00:02:08.950> which<00:02:09.280> is<00:02:09.429> possible<00:02:10.149> just<00:02:10.929> unlikely<00:02:11.470> my

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
wheel which is possible just unlikely my

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.600 
wheel which is possible just unlikely my
guess<00:02:12.190> is<00:02:12.400> that<00:02:12.550> it's<00:02:12.700> a<00:02:12.819> forged<00:02:13.330> wheel<00:02:14.610> which

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
guess is that it's a forged wheel which

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:16.950 
guess is that it's a forged wheel which
is<00:02:15.819> better<00:02:16.060> than<00:02:16.240> a<00:02:16.270> cast

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:16.960 
is better than a cast

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:22.650 
is better than a cast
wiill<00:02:17.170> far<00:02:17.890> more<00:02:18.130> stronger<00:02:20.190> stronger<00:02:21.270> any<00:02:22.270> out

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
wiill far more stronger stronger any out

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:27.590 
wiill far more stronger stronger any out
so<00:02:23.610> point<00:02:24.610> is<00:02:24.820> is<00:02:25.060> as<00:02:25.450> I<00:02:25.590> keep<00:02:26.590> driving<00:02:27.070> home

detailing is just that it's all about
the<00:02:30.340> details<00:02:30.930> so<00:02:31.930> while<00:02:32.830> this<00:02:33.040> may<00:02:33.400> seem

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
the details so while this may seem

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:37.860 
the details so while this may seem
overkill<00:02:34.570> or<00:02:36.120> OCD<00:02:37.120> as<00:02:37.630> an

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
a judgment call only you can make I just

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:44.820 
a judgment call only you can make I just
know<00:02:43.630> that<00:02:43.810> I<00:02:43.870> like<00:02:44.080> to<00:02:44.200> get<00:02:44.320> the<00:02:44.440> details

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830

and<00:02:47.140> so<00:02:47.980> I've<00:02:48.160> been<00:02:48.190> noticing<00:02:48.880> that<00:02:48.910> these

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:49.240 
and so I've been noticing that these

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:52.410 
and so I've been noticing that these
this<00:02:49.780> little<00:02:50.140> lip<00:02:50.350> has<00:02:50.560> been<00:02:50.770> degrading<00:02:51.460> over

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
the past few months and therefore it

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.870 
the past few months and therefore it
becomes<00:02:55.450> a<00:02:55.630> problem-solving<00:02:56.620> moment<00:02:57.100> can<00:02:57.850> I

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
becomes a problem-solving moment can I

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.080 
becomes a problem-solving moment can I
improve<00:02:58.450> the<00:02:58.870> look<00:02:59.050> of<00:02:59.200> this<00:02:59.380> polish<00:02:59.890> lip<00:03:00.220> well
