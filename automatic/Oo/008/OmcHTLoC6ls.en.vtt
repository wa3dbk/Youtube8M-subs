00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.520 
if you you know if you go to the markets
you<00:02:47.180> can<00:02:47.269> see<00:02:47.600> them<00:02:48.130> often<00:02:49.130> sold<00:02:49.670> openly<00:02:50.530> with

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
you can see them often sold openly with

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:56.500 
you can see them often sold openly with
police<00:02:51.890> walking<00:02:52.310> around<00:02:52.610> so<00:02:53.350> I<00:02:55.060> I<00:02:56.060> think<00:02:56.269> the

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
police walking around so I I think the

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.660 
police walking around so I I think the
problem<00:02:56.840> would<00:02:56.989> be<00:02:57.110> easy<00:02:57.260> to<00:02:57.410> solve<00:02:57.769> if<00:02:58.010> if<00:02:58.280> the

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
problem would be easy to solve if if the

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:01.569 
problem would be easy to solve if if the
if<00:02:59.560> the<00:03:00.560> police<00:03:00.769> had<00:03:00.950> backing<00:03:01.310> from<00:03:01.400> the

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:01.579 
if the police had backing from the

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:04.180 
if the police had backing from the
government<00:03:02.030> and<00:03:02.180> then<00:03:02.299> they<00:03:02.500> issued<00:03:03.500> larger

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
government and then they issued larger

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:07.599 
government and then they issued larger
fines<00:03:04.489> or<00:03:04.670> even<00:03:04.730> prison<00:03:05.269> sentences<00:03:05.930> I<00:03:06.829> think<00:03:07.400> I

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:07.609 
fines or even prison sentences I think I

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:09.690 
fines or even prison sentences I think I
think<00:03:08.030> the<00:03:08.120> trade<00:03:08.329> could<00:03:08.540> be<00:03:08.690> stopped

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
think the trade could be stopped

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:20.550 
think the trade could be stopped
reasonably<00:03:10.700> quickly

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.620
