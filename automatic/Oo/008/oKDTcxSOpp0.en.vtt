know when dr. Atkins French came out
with<00:01:42.140> the<00:01:43.140> power<00:01:43.890> protein<00:01:44.369> they<00:01:44.729> really

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
with the power protein they really

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.960 
with the power protein they really
killed<00:01:45.479> him<00:01:45.750> and<00:01:45.930> ostracized<00:01:46.590> it<00:01:46.979> didn't<00:01:47.880> have

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
killed him and ostracized it didn't have

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.090 
killed him and ostracized it didn't have
an<00:01:48.060> idea<00:01:48.540> what<00:01:48.689> they<00:01:48.780> were<00:01:48.899> talking<00:01:49.110> about<00:01:49.380> but

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
we knew what really protein did because

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.080 
we knew what really protein did because
they<00:01:58.710> didn't<00:01:58.890> publish<00:01:59.040> I<00:01:59.340> didn't<00:01:59.579> happen<00:01:59.850> for

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090
