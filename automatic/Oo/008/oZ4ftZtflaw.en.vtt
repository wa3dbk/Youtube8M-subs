00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:44.980 
kicking off with the iPhone 6 we can

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.310 
kicking off with the iPhone 6 we can
move<00:00:45.250> the<00:00:45.460> 6<00:00:45.700> plus<00:00:45.820> out<00:00:46.090> of<00:00:46.330> the<00:00:46.450> way<00:00:46.600> pull<00:00:47.260> the

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:47.320 
move the 6 plus out of the way pull the

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.280 
move the 6 plus out of the way pull the
iPhone<00:00:47.680> 6<00:00:48.190> into<00:00:48.610> frame<00:00:48.880> and<00:00:49.030> take<00:00:49.900> our<00:00:50.170> first

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:50.290 
iPhone 6 into frame and take our first

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:51.750 
iPhone 6 into frame and take our first
picture<00:00:50.800> and<00:00:50.920> that's<00:00:50.980> just<00:00:51.250> going<00:00:51.400> to<00:00:51.460> be<00:00:51.610> an

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:51.760 
picture and that's just going to be an

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.510 
picture and that's just going to be an
overview<00:00:52.660> of<00:00:52.840> all<00:00:53.320> of<00:00:53.620> these<00:00:53.800> objects<00:00:54.370> so<00:00:54.490> we

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:54.520 
overview of all of these objects so we

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.250 
overview of all of these objects so we
can<00:00:54.790> see<00:00:54.970> how<00:00:55.090> they<00:00:55.210> perform<00:00:55.390> in<00:00:55.810> good

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:56.260 
can see how they perform in good

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.490 
can see how they perform in good
lighting<00:00:56.530> so<00:00:57.690> I'm<00:00:58.690> going<00:00:58.870> to<00:00:58.900> use<00:00:59.050> that<00:00:59.230> shot

00:00:59.490 --> 00:00:59.500 
lighting so I'm going to use that shot

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.590 
lighting so I'm going to use that shot
as<00:00:59.620> a<00:00:59.650> reference<00:01:00.160> put<00:01:00.670> it<00:01:00.790> to<00:01:00.910> one<00:01:01.030> side<00:01:01.090> and

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:01.600 
as a reference put it to one side and

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.079 
as a reference put it to one side and
try<00:01:02.020> and<00:01:02.140> emulate<00:01:02.410> that<00:01:02.740> shot<00:01:03.040> with<00:01:03.730> our

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:04.089 
try and emulate that shot with our

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:09.419 
try and emulate that shot with our
iPhone<00:01:05.019> 6<00:01:05.619> plus<00:01:06.840> so<00:01:07.840> getting<00:01:08.229> that<00:01:08.350> in<00:01:08.649> there

00:01:09.419 --> 00:01:09.429 
iPhone 6 plus so getting that in there

00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:16.080 
iPhone 6 plus so getting that in there
like<00:01:09.640> so<00:01:12.479> now<00:01:13.479> if<00:01:13.780> we<00:01:14.079> were<00:01:14.259> to<00:01:14.679> switch<00:01:15.670> off

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:16.090 
like so now if we were to switch off

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.980 
like so now if we were to switch off
some<00:01:16.329> of<00:01:16.359> the<00:01:16.539> lights<00:01:18.569> getting<00:01:19.569> the<00:01:19.780> coffee

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 
some of the lights getting the coffee

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:31.130 
some of the lights getting the coffee
cup<00:01:20.229> in<00:01:20.409> frame<00:01:20.679> and<00:01:24.329> with<00:01:25.329> the<00:01:25.420> iPhone<00:01:25.780> 6<00:01:25.990> plus

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.999 
[Music]
now<00:01:34.329> it's<00:01:34.540> worth<00:01:34.780> noting<00:01:35.049> that's<00:01:35.740> something

00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:36.009 
now it's worth noting that's something

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:37.950 
now it's worth noting that's something
that<00:01:36.159> you<00:01:36.250> can<00:01:36.430> do<00:01:36.610> in<00:01:36.759> iOS<00:01:37.060> 8<00:01:37.360> which<00:01:37.600> you<00:01:37.780> might

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:37.960 
that you can do in iOS 8 which you might

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.350 
that you can do in iOS 8 which you might
or<00:01:38.110> might<00:01:38.259> not<00:01:38.320> have<00:01:38.500> seen<00:01:38.950> it<00:01:39.310> before<00:01:39.490> if<00:01:39.880> we

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:40.360 
or might not have seen it before if we

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.289 
or might not have seen it before if we
tap<00:01:40.600> on<00:01:40.750> a<00:01:40.780> focal<00:01:41.229> point<00:01:41.970> we<00:01:42.970> can<00:01:43.149> actually

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:43.299 
tap on a focal point we can actually

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:45.749 
tap on a focal point we can actually
drag<00:01:43.780> our<00:01:43.990> thumb<00:01:44.259> up<00:01:44.500> and<00:01:44.710> that<00:01:45.189> will<00:01:45.369> increase

00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:45.759 
drag our thumb up and that will increase

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:47.969 
drag our thumb up and that will increase
the<00:01:46.030> exposure<00:01:46.450> we're<00:01:47.110> going<00:01:47.289> to<00:01:47.350> take<00:01:47.560> one<00:01:47.799> a

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:47.979 
the exposure we're going to take one a

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:51.270 
the exposure we're going to take one a
higher<00:01:48.909> exposure<00:01:49.509> just<00:01:50.350> until<00:01:50.710> we<00:01:50.740> feel<00:01:51.070> the

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.280 
higher exposure just until we feel the

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.210 
higher exposure just until we feel the
DSLR<00:01:51.850> which<00:01:52.090> is<00:01:52.270> a<00:01:52.299> black<00:01:52.720> element<00:01:53.229> as<00:01:53.500> most<00:01:54.009> of

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:54.220 
DSLR which is a black element as most of

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.370 
DSLR which is a black element as most of
the<00:01:54.310> detail<00:01:54.729> pulled<00:01:55.149> out<00:01:55.330> a<00:01:55.360> bit<00:01:55.659> and<00:01:55.810> that's

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
the detail pulled out a bit and that's

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.550 
the detail pulled out a bit and that's
just<00:01:57.189> about<00:01:57.369> 60-yard<00:01:58.149> percent<00:01:58.659> exposure<00:01:59.170> and

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 
just about 60-yard percent exposure and

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.669 
just about 60-yard percent exposure and
we'll<00:02:00.369> tap<00:02:00.610> on<00:02:00.820> that<00:02:01.030> and<00:02:01.299> then<00:02:01.990> again<00:02:02.320> we'll

00:02:02.669 --> 00:02:02.679 
we'll tap on that and then again we'll

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:08.940 
we'll tap on that and then again we'll
try<00:02:02.860> and<00:02:03.039> emulate<00:02:03.220> that<00:02:03.580> on<00:02:03.789> the<00:02:04.360> 6<00:02:04.630> plus<00:02:07.950> tap

through DSLR up the exposure tap it

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.789 
through DSLR up the exposure tap it

lastly<00:02:47.560> we'll<00:02:48.340> do<00:02:48.489> exactly<00:02:48.970> the<00:02:49.150> same<00:02:49.180> on<00:02:49.630> the

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
lastly we'll do exactly the same on the

00:02:50.260 --> 00:03:00.390 
lastly we'll do exactly the same on the
iPhone<00:02:50.650> 6<00:02:51.100> plus<00:02:56.160> and<00:02:58.560> we<00:02:59.560> are<00:02:59.859> pretty<00:03:00.220> much

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
iPhone 6 plus and we are pretty much

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.069 
iPhone 6 plus and we are pretty much
done<00:03:00.700> there's<00:03:01.120> one<00:03:01.359> thing<00:03:01.510> that<00:03:01.660> we'd<00:03:01.780> like<00:03:01.930> to

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:02.079 
done there's one thing that we'd like to

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:03.420 
done there's one thing that we'd like to
do<00:03:02.200> just<00:03:02.440> because<00:03:02.620> we're<00:03:02.799> pretty<00:03:03.010> geek<00:03:03.280> in

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
do just because we're pretty geek in

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:04.650 
do just because we're pretty geek in
we're<00:03:03.609> guessing<00:03:03.760> you'll<00:03:04.030> want<00:03:04.239> to<00:03:04.299> see<00:03:04.480> how

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660 
we're guessing you'll want to see how

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.840 
we're guessing you'll want to see how
the<00:03:04.720> macro<00:03:04.959> results<00:03:05.950> bear<00:03:06.220> from<00:03:06.489> both<00:03:06.640> of

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:06.850 
the macro results bear from both of

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:08.340 
the macro results bear from both of
these<00:03:06.940> devices<00:03:07.269> so<00:03:07.480> we<00:03:07.690> can<00:03:07.840> pull<00:03:08.019> right<00:03:08.049> up

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.350 
these devices so we can pull right up

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:09.990 
these devices so we can pull right up
close<00:03:08.500> to<00:03:08.739> the<00:03:08.829> copy<00:03:09.040> cup<00:03:09.340> and<00:03:09.549> then

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
close to the copy cup and then

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.910 
close to the copy cup and then
illustrate<00:03:10.569> how<00:03:10.750> much<00:03:10.989> blur<00:03:11.290> we'll<00:03:11.530> get<00:03:11.739> in

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
illustrate how much blur we'll get in

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.479 
illustrate how much blur we'll get in
the<00:03:12.370> DSLR<00:03:13.060> from<00:03:13.299> that<00:03:13.420> F<00:03:13.600> 2.2<00:03:14.319> lens<00:03:14.890> and<00:03:15.190> you
