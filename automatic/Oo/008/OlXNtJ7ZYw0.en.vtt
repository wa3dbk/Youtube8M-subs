 You must have taken the 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.790
 school varsity package you 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.809
 having a snack there at recess in 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.400
 interval 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.250

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.320
 wanting to play the bad part is easy and 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.080
 It 's a wonder, I'll learn how to do it. 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.480
 now he saw possession of this recipe 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.809
 because we make the pasta is not that 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:39.000
 the one for the half half means 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.930
 then what is the basis to keep is 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.480
 wheat flour 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.070
 we will now doing you will 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.500
 You have what you can to 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.450
 wheat and the mixture that this point still 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.309
 that all ingredients win is 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.260
 here in the video description on youtube 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.360
 in the description of who else to show you 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.280
 do not see all the ingredients is that a 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.050
 little salt only an even finely chopped 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.739
 because I only help not only the taste 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:04.830
 understood dollar but in nelson 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.990
 dwarf and here's a great receive this 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:10.439
 secret of this recipe that is sugar 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:19.200
 powder or confectionery sugar or the 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:21.299
 sugar as the mother leaving the butter 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.560
 butter you can run is 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:27.409
 preferably unsalted 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:29.970
 but if you put a well made jump and 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:33.030
 Now we'll do the following to ask. 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:35.040
 but the mass as well as everyone else as 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.159
 we usually make a dough with 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.710
 people go there but to her with one is so the 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:43.380
 fingertip understood not incorporating 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.450
 butter but I will take the child to 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:49.590
 you do not disapprove and let's go then 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:51.630
 He began to take a mexidinha not 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:55.560
 I'm going to do it like this. 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:57.659
 move so let's go then 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.119
 now that ours is already okay 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.670
 be beyond the little dinha and go 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.530
 putting water 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.840
 slowly until we got a 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.270
 point that that point is that it stayed 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:11.900
 in our case it's fine the g1 also pick up here 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:13.160
 o put some of the water and ours 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.239
 get to the point I'm going to show 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.580
 you 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:19.130
 and then we will hug everything until she stays 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.480
 with this consistency there is also no 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:23.000
 awareness that it will appear a 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:26.510
 modeling clay and that in the 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.650
 movie even more on the millstone 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:32.230
 my hand 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:36.890
 this is the point where you leave the mass 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:41.530
 on a surface after a paper 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.530
 butter is going to be all quiet after 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:51.010
 here our march also only gave a 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:54.980
 We got a little stretch here. 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:57.830
 cutter a way to play in the format 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.720
 square for her 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:05.269
 Actually, we'll make a 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:10.160
 exactly right rectangle not only 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:12.799
 same ones too, afterwards, it makes me more 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:16.880
 chubby we're going to make the video now 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:20.750
 rectangle in 2002 exactly in the middle 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:36.370
 so let's go there exactly 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:44.799
 It will be interesting to see now if the 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:44.799
 Guys take guava in cans, she comes 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:55.220
 We do here 

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:57.350
 in guava path centralizes leaving 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:02.709
 same size that we were going to make a 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:02.709
 whole car of them the way of guava 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:10.349
 the mass compress and then we'll get it 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:11.520
 another piece and copper leaves exactly 

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:14.480
 on 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:14.480
 look that 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:25.730
 and now we squeeze the sides and strip 

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:28.470
 a little of the excess in our 

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:29.330
 and then we will doing now 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:32.280
 People are making this move. 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:34.320
 pushing the inside too, it was 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:36.150
 one a little beating and we will 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:38.880
 leaving it goes the size of the nail there 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:46.160
 so 3rd movie fans of the law to close 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:48.780
 Do you even understand why we cut ourselves? 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:53.210
 we cut less than the same size understood 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:53.210
 the judge of this size here 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:00.419
 you can see that she was already very similar 

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:02.970
 with our end result is looks that 

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:04.860
 cute they are also and 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:07.650
 night will make burned preheat oven 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:09.900
 heated for ten minutes at 180 degrees 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:12.590
 we'll be gone for 20 minutes or until 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:15.750
 stay for days then understood 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:18.690
 Let's all do it here and take it to the oven. 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:22.400
 for 20 minutes and I'll show you 

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:22.400
 How did our guava go? 

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:34.820
 that we have reached the end of yet another 

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:37.940

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:50.260
 You here, sacrifice, take a look. 

00:05:54.320 --> 00:06:00.590

00:05:56.410 --> 00:06:02.810
 fully chair table of your 

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:03.920

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:05.630
 much harder 

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:09.380
 but my friends at this time 

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:15.020
