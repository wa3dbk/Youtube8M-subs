00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
gonna call it as the glue mod and how

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.169 
gonna call it as the glue mod and how
you<00:00:28.890> know<00:00:29.010> I<00:00:29.039> just<00:00:29.279> came<00:00:29.490> up<00:00:29.519> with<00:00:29.640> the<00:00:29.849> idea

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
you know I just came up with the idea

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.600 
you know I just came up with the idea
was<00:00:30.539> I<00:00:30.779> wanted<00:00:31.500> it<00:00:31.830> was<00:00:31.949> really<00:00:32.250> annoying<00:00:32.430> for

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
was I wanted it was really annoying for

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.400 
was I wanted it was really annoying for
me<00:00:32.790> like<00:00:33.120> we're<00:00:33.270> building<00:00:33.690> doors<00:00:33.930> and<00:00:34.200> stuff

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
me like we're building doors and stuff

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.889 
me like we're building doors and stuff
that<00:00:34.680> you<00:00:35.160> know<00:00:35.250> when<00:00:35.579> you<00:00:35.670> build<00:00:35.820> a<00:00:36.000> door<00:00:36.210> with

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
that you know when you build a door with

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.569 
that you know when you build a door with
a<00:00:36.930> sticky<00:00:37.410> piston<00:00:37.620> you<00:00:37.950> can<00:00:38.070> only<00:00:38.250> use<00:00:38.550> one

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
a sticky piston you can only use one

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.520 
a sticky piston you can only use one
block<00:00:39.180> like<00:00:39.510> this<00:00:39.540> and<00:00:39.989> you<00:00:40.140> know<00:00:40.230> you<00:00:40.260> can

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
block like this and you know you can

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.650 
block like this and you know you can
push<00:00:40.739> it<00:00:40.950> and<00:00:41.219> pull<00:00:41.460> one<00:00:41.670> block<00:00:41.910> but<00:00:42.480> if<00:00:42.570> you

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
push it and pull one block but if you

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.440 
push it and pull one block but if you
try<00:00:42.870> using<00:00:43.050> two<00:00:43.440> blocks<00:00:43.770> you<00:00:44.520> know<00:00:44.610> push<00:00:44.969> both

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
try using two blocks you know push both

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.479 
try using two blocks you know push both
of<00:00:45.660> those<00:00:45.780> blocks<00:00:46.079> but<00:00:46.649> only<00:00:46.829> pull<00:00:47.160> one<00:00:47.370> of

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
of those blocks but only pull one of

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.369 
of those blocks but only pull one of
them<00:00:47.640> back<00:00:47.850> in<00:00:48.090> and<00:00:48.360> leave<00:00:48.600> one<00:00:48.780> out<00:00:48.899> you<00:00:49.350> know

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
them back in and leave one out you know

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.939 
them back in and leave one out you know
floating<00:00:50.340> here<00:00:51.020> I'm<00:00:52.020> sorry<00:00:52.320> I<00:00:52.440> found<00:00:52.829> that

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
floating here I'm sorry I found that

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.290 
floating here I'm sorry I found that
really<00:00:53.280> annoying<00:00:53.489> and<00:00:53.789> so<00:00:53.879> I<00:00:53.940> came<00:00:54.000> up<00:00:54.270> with

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
really annoying and so I came up with

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.180 
really annoying and so I came up with
this<00:00:54.449> idea<00:00:54.660> for<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.469> glue<00:00:55.649> mod<00:00:55.890> where

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
this idea for the glue mod where

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.680 
this idea for the glue mod where
basically<00:00:56.550> you<00:00:56.730> could<00:00:56.850> put<00:00:57.059> a<00:00:57.090> piece<00:00:57.300> of<00:00:57.480> glue

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
basically you could put a piece of glue

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.380 
basically you could put a piece of glue
between<00:00:58.500> two<00:00:58.920> blocks<00:00:59.309> and<00:00:59.670> then<00:01:00.120> they<00:01:00.239> would

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
between two blocks and then they would

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.270 
between two blocks and then they would
stick<00:01:00.750> together<00:01:00.960> and<00:01:01.410> stay<00:01:01.649> together<00:01:01.710> so

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
stick together and stay together so

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.219 
stick together and stay together so
let's<00:01:02.550> say<00:01:02.640> you<00:01:02.760> could<00:01:02.910> push<00:01:03.149> it<00:01:03.180> like<00:01:03.989> this

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
let's say you could push it like this

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.500 
let's say you could push it like this
and<00:01:04.500> those<00:01:04.949> and<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.489> two<00:01:05.670> blocks<00:01:05.939> would<00:01:06.240> stay

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
and those and the two blocks would stay

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.170 
and those and the two blocks would stay
together<00:01:06.689> now<00:01:07.500> we<00:01:07.560> also<00:01:07.799> I<00:01:08.010> had<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.610> idea<00:01:08.700> you

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
together now we also I had the idea you

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.060 
together now we also I had the idea you
know<00:01:09.299> when<00:01:09.659> you<00:01:09.750> put<00:01:09.990> redstone<00:01:10.260> on<00:01:10.680> top<00:01:10.710> of<00:01:11.010> a

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
know when you put redstone on top of a

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.609 
know when you put redstone on top of a
block<00:01:11.280> and<00:01:11.460> then<00:01:11.549> you<00:01:11.670> push<00:01:11.909> it<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.930> Redstone

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
block and then you push it the Redstone

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.770 
block and then you push it the Redstone
also<00:01:13.950> pops<00:01:14.220> off<00:01:14.490> which<00:01:14.790> is<00:01:14.970> quite<00:01:15.479> annoying

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
also pops off which is quite annoying

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.859 
also pops off which is quite annoying
and<00:01:16.460> so<00:01:17.460> that<00:01:17.610> was<00:01:17.729> another<00:01:17.970> idea<00:01:18.360> that<00:01:18.570> we

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
and so that was another idea that we

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.630 
and so that was another idea that we
could<00:01:19.020> use<00:01:19.500> with<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:19.860> glue<00:01:20.040> mod<00:01:20.220> you<00:01:20.430> know<00:01:20.520> you

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
could use with the glue mod you know you

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:21.859 
could use with the glue mod you know you
put<00:01:20.820> a<00:01:20.850> piece<00:01:21.030> of<00:01:21.060> glue<00:01:21.299> down<00:01:21.479> and<00:01:21.720> then<00:01:21.810> you

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
put a piece of glue down and then you

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.210 
put a piece of glue down and then you
put<00:01:22.140> redstone<00:01:22.350> on<00:01:22.770> it<00:01:24.229> so<00:01:25.229> I<00:01:25.530> talked<00:01:25.890> to<00:01:26.070> my

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
put redstone on it so I talked to my

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.090 
put redstone on it so I talked to my
friend<00:01:26.610> a<00:01:26.850> hippopotamus<00:01:27.500> who<00:01:28.500> is<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:28.829> person

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.410 
this is still very buggy but it's it's
the<00:01:50.970> glue<00:01:51.240> mod<00:01:51.479> um<00:01:51.899> and<00:01:52.939> here<00:01:53.939> I'll<00:01:54.149> show<00:01:54.390> you

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
the glue mod um and here I'll show you

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.840 
the glue mod um and here I'll show you
how<00:01:54.630> it<00:01:54.750> works<00:01:54.869> um<00:01:55.259> so<00:01:56.100> this<00:01:56.250> is<00:01:56.430> this<00:01:56.610> is<00:01:56.820> a

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
how it works um so this is this is a

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.480 
how it works um so this is this is a
glue<00:01:57.119> block<00:01:57.450> so<00:01:58.049> right<00:01:58.259> now<00:01:58.439> what<00:01:58.740> we<00:01:58.890> have<00:01:58.920> is

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
glue block so right now what we have is

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.179 
glue block so right now what we have is
just<00:01:59.570> glue<00:02:00.570> blocks<00:02:00.750> you<00:02:01.049> can't<00:02:01.320> put<00:02:01.860> glue<00:02:02.159> on

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
just glue blocks you can't put glue on

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.609 
just glue blocks you can't put glue on
specific<00:02:03.060> faces<00:02:03.600> of<00:02:03.840> different<00:02:03.990> objects

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
specific faces of different objects

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.560 
specific faces of different objects
right<00:02:05.100> now<00:02:05.189> he<00:02:05.250> just<00:02:05.640> has<00:02:05.790> a<00:02:05.820> glue<00:02:06.090> block<00:02:06.360> there

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
right now he just has a glue block there

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.930 
right now he just has a glue block there
again<00:02:06.780> this<00:02:06.960> is<00:02:07.140> um<00:02:07.380> theta<00:02:08.160> he's<00:02:08.520> you<00:02:08.879> know

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
again this is um theta he's you know

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:09.740 
again this is um theta he's you know
still<00:02:09.209> working<00:02:09.509> on<00:02:09.599> it

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
still working on it

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.320 
still working on it
anyways<00:02:10.500> so<00:02:11.489> how<00:02:11.670> it<00:02:11.849> works<00:02:11.879> is<00:02:12.390> all<00:02:12.870> you<00:02:13.110> do

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
anyways so how it works is all you do

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.750 
anyways so how it works is all you do
he<00:02:13.540> put<00:02:13.750> a<00:02:13.780> block<00:02:14.380> right<00:02:14.740> a<00:02:14.890> glue<00:02:15.220> block<00:02:15.460> and

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
he put a block right a glue block and

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.780 
he put a block right a glue block and
then<00:02:16.330> you<00:02:16.990> can<00:02:17.170> put<00:02:17.380> you<00:02:17.590> know<00:02:17.650> another<00:02:18.010> just<00:02:18.640> a

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
then you can put you know another just a

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.930 
then you can put you know another just a
regular<00:02:19.090> block<00:02:19.330> blue<00:02:19.930> block<00:02:20.400> and<00:02:21.400> a<00:02:21.490> regular

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
regular block blue block and a regular

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.390 
regular block blue block and a regular
block<00:02:22.210> and<00:02:22.450> so<00:02:23.170> on<00:02:23.440> and<00:02:23.680> so<00:02:23.860> forth<00:02:24.100> and

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
block and so on and so forth and

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.760 
block and so on and so forth and
basically<00:02:24.940> how<00:02:25.120> it<00:02:25.240> works<00:02:25.270> is<00:02:25.690> you<00:02:26.110> know<00:02:26.590> I

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:26.770 
basically how it works is you know I

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:28.800 
basically how it works is you know I
pushed<00:02:27.070> the<00:02:27.250> lever<00:02:27.370> you<00:02:28.120> know<00:02:28.210> pushes<00:02:28.630> all<00:02:28.780> of

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
pushed the lever you know pushes all of

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.380 
pushed the lever you know pushes all of
them<00:02:28.990> out<00:02:29.140> and<00:02:29.380> then<00:02:29.920> when<00:02:30.010> I<00:02:30.040> pull<00:02:30.250> back<00:02:30.490> it

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
them out and then when I pull back it

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.050 
them out and then when I pull back it
pushes<00:02:31.720> them<00:02:31.870> all<00:02:32.050> in<00:02:32.230> which<00:02:33.010> is<00:02:33.190> this<00:02:33.670> is<00:02:33.850> this

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
pushes them all in which is this is this

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.820 
pushes them all in which is this is this
is<00:02:34.240> amazing<00:02:34.750> you<00:02:34.870> can<00:02:34.900> do<00:02:35.140> a<00:02:35.170> lot<00:02:35.500> of<00:02:35.530> really

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
is amazing you can do a lot of really

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:37.080 
is amazing you can do a lot of really
cool<00:02:36.070> stuff<00:02:36.220> with<00:02:36.490> this<00:02:36.610> and<00:02:36.820> I'll<00:02:36.880> show<00:02:37.060> you

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
cool stuff with this and I'll show you

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.030 
cool stuff with this and I'll show you
some<00:02:37.330> stuff<00:02:37.540> that<00:02:37.690> I<00:02:37.750> did<00:02:37.990> later<00:02:38.170> and<00:02:38.560> then<00:02:38.920> the

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
some stuff that I did later and then the

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.910 
some stuff that I did later and then the
other<00:02:39.220> cool<00:02:39.490> thing<00:02:39.730> is<00:02:39.910> watch<00:02:40.330> this<00:02:40.660> I<00:02:40.900> can<00:02:41.740> put

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
other cool thing is watch this I can put

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.980 
other cool thing is watch this I can put
redstone<00:02:42.160> on<00:02:42.580> top<00:02:42.610> here<00:02:43.180> and<00:02:44.310> it<00:02:45.810> will<00:02:46.810> move

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:46.990 
redstone on top here and it will move

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:49.800 
redstone on top here and it will move
with<00:02:47.320> it<00:02:47.350> so<00:02:48.280> you<00:02:48.340> can<00:02:48.640> it<00:02:49.090> doesn't<00:02:49.450> pop<00:02:49.570> off

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
with it so you can it doesn't pop off

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.130 
with it so you can it doesn't pop off
anymore<00:02:50.200> especially<00:02:50.320> when<00:02:50.800> there's<00:02:50.950> blue<00:02:51.130> um

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
anymore especially when there's blue um

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.600 
anymore especially when there's blue um
so<00:02:53.140> this<00:02:53.290> is<00:02:53.500> this<00:02:53.650> is<00:02:53.709> basically<00:02:54.220> the<00:02:54.490> glue

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
so this is this is basically the glue

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.880 
so this is this is basically the glue
mod<00:02:54.910> and<00:02:55.180> it<00:02:55.420> doesn't<00:02:55.810> I<00:02:55.959> think<00:02:56.500> it<00:02:56.650> has<00:02:56.860> the

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
mod and it doesn't I think it has the

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:59.040 
mod and it doesn't I think it has the
potential<00:02:57.370> of<00:02:57.760> being<00:02:58.000> implemented<00:02:58.420> into<00:02:58.930> the

00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.050 
potential of being implemented into the

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:01.530 
potential of being implemented into the
actual<00:02:59.380> Minecraft<00:02:59.950> game<00:03:00.250> you<00:03:01.209> know<00:03:01.300> the

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
actual Minecraft game you know the

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.660 
actual Minecraft game you know the
actual<00:03:01.870> game<00:03:02.080> because<00:03:02.920> it's<00:03:03.100> not<00:03:03.280> it's<00:03:03.550> not

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
actual game because it's not it's not

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.510 
actual game because it's not it's not
like<00:03:03.730> a<00:03:04.030> Minecraft<00:03:04.959> changing<00:03:05.740> altering<00:03:06.340> you

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:06.520 
like a Minecraft changing altering you

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:08.130 
like a Minecraft changing altering you
know<00:03:06.640> some<00:03:07.120> sort<00:03:07.300> of<00:03:07.390> really<00:03:07.630> hard<00:03:07.840> thing<00:03:08.110> to

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
know some sort of really hard thing to

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.740 
know some sort of really hard thing to
do<00:03:08.440> it's<00:03:09.340> just<00:03:09.430> a<00:03:09.730> pretty<00:03:10.030> simple<00:03:10.360> idea<00:03:10.510> that

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
do it's just a pretty simple idea that

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.390 
do it's just a pretty simple idea that
won't<00:03:11.050> really<00:03:11.230> change<00:03:11.320> anything<00:03:12.160> in

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
won't really change anything in

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.100 
won't really change anything in
Minecraft<00:03:12.850> but<00:03:12.940> just<00:03:13.120> make<00:03:13.300> you'll<00:03:13.870> be<00:03:14.020> able

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110 
Minecraft but just make you'll be able

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:16.530 
Minecraft but just make you'll be able
to<00:03:14.290> make<00:03:14.530> cooler<00:03:14.920> things<00:03:15.310> so<00:03:16.060> let<00:03:16.240> me<00:03:16.330> show<00:03:16.480> you

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
to make cooler things so let me show you

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:17.880 
to make cooler things so let me show you
some<00:03:16.780> of<00:03:16.810> the<00:03:16.990> stuff<00:03:17.230> I've<00:03:17.380> done<00:03:17.410> with<00:03:17.739> this

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
some of the stuff I've done with this

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:21.360 
some of the stuff I've done with this
again<00:03:18.459> this<00:03:18.670> is<00:03:18.880> in<00:03:19.390> still<00:03:19.959> in<00:03:20.110> pre<00:03:20.470> you<00:03:21.250> know

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
again this is in still in pre you know

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:23.610 
again this is in still in pre you know
release<00:03:22.330> and<00:03:22.600> everything<00:03:22.959> so<00:03:23.110> you<00:03:23.200> just<00:03:23.350> do<00:03:23.500> me

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
release and everything so you just do me

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.100 
release and everything so you just do me
a<00:03:23.650> beta<00:03:23.920> but<00:03:24.670> soon<00:03:25.209> in<00:03:25.360> the<00:03:25.450> future<00:03:25.480> he's<00:03:25.959> gonna

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:26.110 
a beta but soon in the future he's gonna

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:27.420 
a beta but soon in the future he's gonna
make<00:03:26.290> a<00:03:26.350> new<00:03:26.560> block<00:03:26.830> where<00:03:27.100> you're<00:03:27.190> gonna<00:03:27.310> be

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
make a new block where you're gonna be

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:30.240 
make a new block where you're gonna be
able<00:03:27.550> to<00:03:28.050> click<00:03:29.050> glue<00:03:29.290> in<00:03:29.470> specific<00:03:30.010> places

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
able to click glue in specific places

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.460 
able to click glue in specific places
because<00:03:30.730> right<00:03:30.910> now<00:03:31.090> you<00:03:31.750> have<00:03:31.959> to<00:03:32.110> have<00:03:32.260> the

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
because right now you have to have the

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:34.979 
because right now you have to have the
glue<00:03:32.680> block<00:03:32.950> floating<00:03:33.519> or<00:03:33.940> else<00:03:34.150> it<00:03:34.450> will<00:03:34.720> if

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:34.989 
glue block floating or else it will if

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:36.509 
glue block floating or else it will if
it's<00:03:35.260> touching<00:03:35.530> another<00:03:35.890> block<00:03:36.160> here<00:03:36.400> we'll

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:36.519 
it's touching another block here we'll

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:38.490 
it's touching another block here we'll
try<00:03:36.700> pushing<00:03:37.000> everything<00:03:37.360> on<00:03:37.750> another<00:03:38.230> thing

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
try pushing everything on another thing

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.180 
try pushing everything on another thing
to<00:03:38.620> note<00:03:38.830> is<00:03:39.930> pistons<00:03:40.930> will<00:03:41.110> still<00:03:41.380> if<00:03:41.680> even<00:03:42.100> if

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190 
to note is pistons will still if even if

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:43.140 
to note is pistons will still if even if
you<00:03:42.280> build<00:03:42.459> like<00:03:42.550> a<00:03:42.640> little<00:03:42.880> structure

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
you build like a little structure

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:45.660 
you build like a little structure
pistons<00:03:44.019> will<00:03:44.230> still<00:03:44.470> only<00:03:44.680> push<00:03:45.040> 12<00:03:45.430> with<00:03:45.640> the

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670 
pistons will still only push 12 with the

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:48.300 
pistons will still only push 12 with the
blocks<00:03:45.970> so<00:03:46.300> just<00:03:47.200> to<00:03:47.260> keep<00:03:47.380> that<00:03:47.560> in<00:03:47.650> mind<00:03:47.830> but

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
blocks so just to keep that in mind but

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:54.030 
blocks so just to keep that in mind but
for<00:03:48.459> example<00:03:48.940> on<00:03:50.040> hippopotamuses<00:03:51.040> channel<00:03:53.040> he

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
for example on hippopotamuses channel he

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.270 
for example on hippopotamuses channel he
put<00:03:54.519> up<00:03:54.670> this<00:03:54.940> really<00:03:55.209> cool<00:03:55.800> circuit<00:03:56.800> that<00:03:57.070> he

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 
put up this really cool circuit that he

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:58.920 
put up this really cool circuit that he
made<00:03:57.459> so<00:03:57.670> i'm<00:03:57.850> just<00:03:57.880> recreating<00:03:58.480> it<00:03:58.720> this

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 
made so i'm just recreating it this

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:02.040 
made so i'm just recreating it this
circuit<00:03:59.709> was<00:03:59.890> are<00:04:00.250> created<00:04:00.700> by<00:04:00.820> primus<00:04:01.510> but

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:02.050 
circuit was are created by primus but

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:03.570 
circuit was are created by primus but
basically<00:04:02.320> you<00:04:02.500> know<00:04:02.590> how<00:04:02.769> it<00:04:02.890> works<00:04:03.100> is<00:04:03.370> you

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:03.580 
basically you know how it works is you

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:07.800 
basically you know how it works is you
know<00:04:04.380> flip<00:04:05.380> this<00:04:05.680> lever<00:04:05.980> and<00:04:06.630> these<00:04:07.630> get

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:07.810 
know flip this lever and these get

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:09.200 
know flip this lever and these get
pushed<00:04:08.080> in<00:04:08.290> and

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:09.210 
pushed in and

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:13.570 
pushed in and
and<00:04:09.300> then<00:04:09.990> you<00:04:10.080> flip<00:04:10.230> this<00:04:10.500> lever<00:04:10.800> here<00:04:12.380> and

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:13.580 
and then you flip this lever here and

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:15.170 
and then you flip this lever here and
then<00:04:14.580> there<00:04:14.730> you<00:04:14.760> go

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
then there you go

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.010 
then there you go
circuit<00:04:15.960> so<00:04:16.500> that<00:04:16.530> that's<00:04:17.100> a<00:04:17.220> cool

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:18.020 
circuit so that that's a cool

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:20.270 
circuit so that that's a cool
implementation<00:04:19.020> or<00:04:19.200> an<00:04:19.290> implication<00:04:19.740> of<00:04:20.040> the

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
implementation or an implication of the

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.910 
implementation or an implication of the
blue<00:04:21.180> mod<00:04:21.420> or<00:04:21.870> basically<00:04:22.350> you<00:04:22.440> can<00:04:22.590> turn<00:04:22.770> that

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:22.920 
blue mod or basically you can turn that

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:26.870 
blue mod or basically you can turn that
on<00:04:23.100> and<00:04:23.160> off<00:04:23.400> and<00:04:23.760> um<00:04:24.210> you<00:04:24.990> know<00:04:25.110> the<00:04:25.880> redstone

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
on and off and um you know the redstone

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.570 
on and off and um you know the redstone
stays<00:04:27.210> on<00:04:27.420> so<00:04:27.720> it's<00:04:28.110> it's<00:04:28.590> it's<00:04:28.830> a<00:04:29.010> really<00:04:29.310> cool

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
stays on so it's it's it's a really cool

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.670 
stays on so it's it's it's a really cool
really<00:04:30.180> cool<00:04:30.210> thing<00:04:30.540> you<00:04:30.570> can<00:04:30.660> do<00:04:30.960> now<00:04:31.140> here's

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
really cool thing you can do now here's

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.440 
really cool thing you can do now here's
another<00:04:31.890> example<00:04:32.040> this<00:04:32.460> is<00:04:32.670> I<00:04:32.910> built<00:04:33.300> this

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:33.450 
another example this is I built this

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:34.820 
another example this is I built this
really<00:04:33.690> quickly<00:04:33.990> you<00:04:34.260> know<00:04:34.410> it's<00:04:34.560> just<00:04:34.620> this

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:34.830 
really quickly you know it's just this

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:37.490 
really quickly you know it's just this
cool<00:04:35.040> little<00:04:35.190> thing<00:04:35.460> and<00:04:36.050> this<00:04:37.050> just<00:04:37.290> kind<00:04:37.410> of

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 
cool little thing and this just kind of

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.630 
cool little thing and this just kind of
shows<00:04:37.740> you<00:04:39.620> you<00:04:40.620> know<00:04:40.680> you<00:04:40.770> can<00:04:40.980> push<00:04:41.280> blocks

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:41.640 
shows you you know you can push blocks

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:44.540 
shows you you know you can push blocks
multiple<00:04:42.360> amounts<00:04:43.260> especially<00:04:43.380> Pistons<00:04:44.310> and

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:44.550 
multiple amounts especially Pistons and

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:48.320 
multiple amounts especially Pistons and
you<00:04:44.610> can<00:04:44.730> power<00:04:44.970> and<00:04:45.600> you<00:04:45.690> turn<00:04:45.900> it<00:04:46.020> off<00:04:47.330> that's

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:48.330 
you can power and you turn it off that's

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:54.850 
you can power and you turn it off that's
weird<00:04:48.920> what<00:04:49.920> happened<00:04:50.280> there<00:04:50.460> oh<00:04:52.550> oh<00:04:53.550> I<00:04:53.670> know

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:54.860 
weird what happened there oh oh I know

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:59.660 
weird what happened there oh oh I know
okay<00:04:55.860> yeah<00:04:56.250> whoops<00:04:56.870> I<00:04:57.870> had<00:04:58.830> it<00:04:58.980> set<00:04:59.250> long<00:04:59.430> and

00:04:59.660 --> 00:04:59.670 
okay yeah whoops I had it set long and

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:04.220 
okay yeah whoops I had it set long and
you<00:04:59.730> just<00:04:59.910> reset<00:05:00.240> it<00:05:01.730> there<00:05:02.730> yeah<00:05:02.880> okay<00:05:03.480> so<00:05:04.110> now

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:04.230 
you just reset it there yeah okay so now

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:07.460 
you just reset it there yeah okay so now
it's<00:05:04.350> good<00:05:04.500> so<00:05:05.070> anyways<00:05:05.550> so<00:05:05.790> as<00:05:06.660> you<00:05:07.290> can<00:05:07.410> see

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:07.470 
it's good so anyways so as you can see

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:11.570 
it's good so anyways so as you can see
it<00:05:08.430> opens<00:05:09.020> and<00:05:10.020> closes<00:05:10.560> so<00:05:10.920> like<00:05:11.100> in<00:05:11.250> the

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:11.580 
it opens and closes so like in the

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:14.210 
it opens and closes so like in the
future<00:05:11.940> when<00:05:12.320> you<00:05:13.320> know<00:05:13.440> there<00:05:13.740> aren't<00:05:13.890> glue

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:14.220 
future when you know there aren't glue

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:16.940 
future when you know there aren't glue
the<00:05:14.760> blocks<00:05:15.600> on<00:05:15.870> all<00:05:15.990> faces<00:05:16.470> you<00:05:16.650> know<00:05:16.710> I<00:05:16.800> have

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:16.950 
the blocks on all faces you know I have

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:17.750 
the blocks on all faces you know I have
a<00:05:16.980> little<00:05:17.130> fault<00:05:17.430> here

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:17.760 
a little fault here

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:20.060 
a little fault here
you<00:05:18.480> can<00:05:18.630> make<00:05:18.780> really<00:05:19.020> big<00:05:19.260> doors<00:05:19.590> that<00:05:19.860> slide

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:20.070 
you can make really big doors that slide

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:21.710 
you can make really big doors that slide
it<00:05:20.460> to<00:05:20.670> the<00:05:20.700> side<00:05:20.820> or<00:05:21.270> anything<00:05:21.300> like<00:05:21.660> that

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:21.720 
it to the side or anything like that

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:23.540 
it to the side or anything like that
where<00:05:22.140> you<00:05:22.230> know<00:05:22.380> with<00:05:22.530> this<00:05:22.680> type<00:05:23.130> of<00:05:23.160> them

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:23.550 
where you know with this type of them

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:26.750 
where you know with this type of them
thing<00:05:24.420> where<00:05:24.710> the<00:05:25.710> Pistons<00:05:26.160> push<00:05:26.400> push<00:05:26.730> push

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:26.760 
thing where the Pistons push push push

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:28.400 
thing where the Pistons push push push
push<00:05:27.060> and<00:05:27.630> pull<00:05:27.780> pull<00:05:27.960> pull<00:05:28.020> pull

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:28.410 
push and pull pull pull pull

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:32.360 
push and pull pull pull pull
again<00:05:29.280> machine<00:05:29.900> that's<00:05:30.900> just<00:05:31.200> kind<00:05:32.010> of<00:05:32.040> simple

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:32.370 
again machine that's just kind of simple

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:34.010 
again machine that's just kind of simple
stuff<00:05:32.610> and<00:05:32.940> so<00:05:33.120> you<00:05:33.180> you<00:05:33.510> kind<00:05:33.750> of<00:05:33.780> get<00:05:33.900> the

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:34.020 
stuff and so you you kind of get the

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:36.170 
stuff and so you you kind of get the
idea<00:05:34.050> of<00:05:34.500> what<00:05:34.710> kind<00:05:35.220> of<00:05:35.340> cool<00:05:35.610> stuff<00:05:35.940> you're

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:36.180 
idea of what kind of cool stuff you're

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:37.220 
idea of what kind of cool stuff you're
gonna<00:05:36.240> be<00:05:36.450> able<00:05:36.540> to<00:05:36.660> do<00:05:36.810> with<00:05:36.930> this<00:05:37.050> in<00:05:37.170> the

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:37.230 
gonna be able to do with this in the

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:39.470 
gonna be able to do with this in the
future<00:05:37.560> when<00:05:37.680> a<00:05:37.740> phone<00:05:37.980> comes<00:05:38.430> out<00:05:38.610> and<00:05:38.880> so<00:05:39.450> I

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:39.480 
future when a phone comes out and so I
