00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.470 
does increase your job might think it's
cost<00:03:28.889> would<00:03:29.010> hit<00:03:29.189> the<00:03:29.310> spikes<00:03:29.609> no<00:03:30.150> that's

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
cost would hit the spikes no that's

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.239 
cost would hit the spikes no that's
another<00:03:30.810> thing<00:03:30.989> to<00:03:31.170> know<00:03:31.290> about<00:03:31.319> this<00:03:31.709> and

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:32.249 
another thing to know about this and

00:03:32.249 --> 00:03:33.879 
another thing to know about this and
instant<00:03:32.670> death<00:03:32.790> isn't<00:03:33.030> nice

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:33.889 
instant death isn't nice

00:03:33.889 --> 00:03:38.390 
instant death isn't nice
so<00:03:34.889> there<00:03:35.549> we<00:03:35.639> go<00:03:35.819> tornado<00:03:36.420> map<00:03:36.719> done<00:03:37.290> and<00:03:37.799> it

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
so there we go tornado map done and it

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.830 
so there we go tornado map done and it
looks<00:03:38.549> like<00:03:38.609> an<00:03:38.879> uncovered<00:03:39.269> another<00:03:39.569> piece

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
looks like an uncovered another piece

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.839 
looks like an uncovered another piece
and<00:03:40.019> a<00:03:40.079> puzzle<00:03:40.439> what<00:03:41.010> could<00:03:41.129> it<00:03:41.189> mean<00:03:41.250> we'll

00:03:41.839 --> 00:03:41.849 
and a puzzle what could it mean we'll

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:45.890 
and a puzzle what could it mean we'll
soon<00:03:42.090> find<00:03:42.120> out<00:03:42.769> now<00:03:43.769> with<00:03:44.159> that<00:03:44.780> then<00:03:45.780> I'll

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
soon find out now with that then I'll

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:47.750 
soon find out now with that then I'll
make<00:03:46.200> many<00:03:46.409> service<00:03:46.769> to<00:03:46.920> himself<00:03:47.129> Burt<00:03:47.519> there

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
make many service to himself Burt there

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:48.110 
make many service to himself Burt there
you<00:03:47.819> go

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
you go

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.750 
you go
