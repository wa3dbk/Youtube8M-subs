here that's just like these single pegs
just<00:03:13.970> for<00:03:14.209> back<00:03:14.630> of<00:03:14.780> it<00:03:15.549> under<00:03:16.549> Spence<00:03:16.790> right

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
just for back of it under Spence right

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.349 
just for back of it under Spence right
here<00:03:17.299> and<00:03:17.569> two<00:03:18.500> hatches<00:03:18.980> right<00:03:19.130> there<00:03:19.370> life

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:20.359 
here and two hatches right there life

here and two hatches right there life
preserver<00:03:20.810> stickers<00:03:21.410> and<00:03:21.920> then<00:03:22.130> just<00:03:22.579> dump

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790 
preserver stickers and then just dump

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:26.590 
preserver stickers and then just dump
this<00:03:24.220> thing<00:03:25.220> right<00:03:25.430> there<00:03:25.609> sooo<00:03:26.269> on<00:03:26.420> the<00:03:26.510> other

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:26.600 
this thing right there sooo on the other

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:31.059 
this thing right there sooo on the other
side<00:03:27.489> fence<00:03:28.489> right<00:03:28.700> there<00:03:28.760> stickers<00:03:29.889> and<00:03:30.889> this

00:03:31.059 --> 00:03:31.069 
side fence right there stickers and this

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:35.199 
side fence right there stickers and this
comes<00:03:32.000> out<00:03:32.269> on<00:03:33.519> whole<00:03:34.519> thing<00:03:34.790> that's<00:03:35.030> what

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 
comes out on whole thing that's what

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:38.979 
comes out on whole thing that's what
it's<00:03:35.389> like<00:03:35.660> and<00:03:36.170> it's<00:03:37.000> just<00:03:38.000> like<00:03:38.150> a<00:03:38.359> spacer

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:38.989 
it's like and it's just like a spacer

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:46.569 
it's like and it's just like a spacer
here<00:03:40.989> and<00:03:41.989> then<00:03:42.290> this<00:03:42.500> also<00:03:45.250> comes<00:03:46.250> it<00:03:46.459> like

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:46.579 
here and then this also comes it like

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:50.740 
here and then this also comes it like
this<00:03:46.730> I<00:03:48.130> think<00:03:49.130> you<00:03:49.609> you<00:03:49.970> build<00:03:50.239> the<00:03:50.329> main<00:03:50.510> body

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:50.750 
this I think you you build the main body

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.470 
this I think you you build the main body
then<00:03:51.200> you<00:03:51.350> build<00:03:51.500> the<00:03:51.650> front<00:03:52.060> then<00:03:53.060> you<00:03:53.269> build

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.480 
then you build the front then you build

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:59.890 
then you build the front then you build
this<00:03:54.290> and<00:03:54.829> then<00:03:55.250> you<00:03:55.280> build<00:03:55.579> this<00:03:58.599> and<00:03:59.599> put

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
this and then you build this and put

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.530 
this and then you build this and put
them<00:04:00.019> on<00:04:00.400> but<00:04:01.400> I'm<00:04:01.609> kind<00:04:01.970> of<00:04:02.060> thinking<00:04:02.150> about

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:02.540 
them on but I'm kind of thinking about

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:05.110 
them on but I'm kind of thinking about
taking<00:04:02.900> this<00:04:03.109> apart<00:04:03.609> cause<00:04:04.609> some<00:04:04.970> of<00:04:05.060> the

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 
taking this apart cause some of the

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.949 
taking this apart cause some of the
pieces<00:04:05.630> like<00:04:06.620> these<00:04:07.549> are<00:04:07.760> mainly<00:04:07.910> 51<00:04:08.750> by

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:08.959 
pieces like these are mainly 51 by

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:14.740 
pieces like these are mainly 51 by
Saturn<00:04:09.829> this<00:04:10.130> one's<00:04:10.310> like<00:04:10.400> a<00:04:10.519> 1<00:04:10.700> by<00:04:10.880> 8<00:04:13.750> what

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:14.750 
Saturn this one's like a 1 by 8 what

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:16.930 
Saturn this one's like a 1 by 8 what
some<00:04:15.200> of<00:04:15.230> these<00:04:15.410> like<00:04:15.799> one<00:04:16.190> by<00:04:16.340> fours<00:04:16.639> right

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 
some of these like one by fours right

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:22.149 
some of these like one by fours right
here<00:04:17.180> a<00:04:17.359> lot<00:04:18.019> of<00:04:18.169> one<00:04:18.289> by<00:04:18.410> fours<00:04:19.450> but<00:04:20.450> then<00:04:21.159> so

00:04:22.149 --> 00:04:22.159 
here a lot of one by fours but then so

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:23.890 
here a lot of one by fours but then so
this<00:04:22.370> doesn't<00:04:22.550> break

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:23.900 
this doesn't break

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:27.219 
this doesn't break
I<00:04:23.960> want<00:04:24.259> them<00:04:24.380> one<00:04:24.979> piece<00:04:25.190> off<00:04:25.810> the<00:04:26.810> bottom<00:04:27.110> you

00:04:27.219 --> 00:04:27.229 
I want them one piece off the bottom you

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:29.650 
I want them one piece off the bottom you
can<00:04:27.290> see<00:04:27.380> they're<00:04:27.740> kinda<00:04:28.250> make<00:04:29.240> it<00:04:29.389> to<00:04:29.540> my

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:29.660 
can see they're kinda make it to my

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:32.460 
can see they're kinda make it to my
there<00:04:29.930> two<00:04:30.080> by<00:04:30.199> fours<00:04:30.639> the<00:04:31.639> sick<00:04:31.820> ones<00:04:32.060> and

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
there two by fours the sick ones and

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:36.370 
there two by fours the sick ones and
those<00:04:33.470> would<00:04:33.889> be<00:04:33.949> really<00:04:34.430> good<00:04:34.759> for<00:04:35.380> building

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:36.380 
those would be really good for building

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:40.659 
those would be really good for building
like<00:04:38.199> walls<00:04:39.199> and<00:04:39.530> stuff<00:04:39.740> right<00:04:40.340> where<00:04:40.520> you

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:40.669 
like walls and stuff right where you

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:42.510 
like walls and stuff right where you
read<00:04:41.030> have<00:04:41.210> the<00:04:41.330> holes<00:04:41.539> in<00:04:41.690> the<00:04:41.810> house<00:04:41.990> like

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:42.520 
read have the holes in the house like

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.070 
read have the holes in the house like
those<00:04:43.520> wall<00:04:43.789> type<00:04:44.060> of<00:04:44.150> walls<00:04:44.330> those<00:04:44.780> would<00:04:44.960> be

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:45.080 
those wall type of walls those would be

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.140 
those wall type of walls those would be
really<00:04:45.320> good<00:04:45.530> for<00:04:45.680> building<00:04:45.860> those<00:04:46.160> because

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:47.150 
really good for building those because

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:48.760 
really good for building those because
there's<00:04:47.330> a<00:04:47.389> lot<00:04:47.449> of<00:04:47.720> them<00:04:47.960> I'm<00:04:48.410> thinking<00:04:48.620> about

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:48.770 
there's a lot of them I'm thinking about

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:50.529 
there's a lot of them I'm thinking about
taking<00:04:48.919> this<00:04:49.190> apart<00:04:49.460> and<00:04:49.639> doing<00:04:49.850> that<00:04:50.000> I'm<00:04:50.389> not

00:04:50.529 --> 00:04:50.539 
taking this apart and doing that I'm not

00:04:50.539 --> 00:04:56.860 
taking this apart and doing that I'm not
sure<00:04:50.600> if<00:04:50.780> I'm<00:04:50.870> not<00:04:51.050> going<00:04:51.440> to<00:04:54.400> and<00:04:55.400> like<00:04:56.150> one

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:56.870 
sure if I'm not going to and like one

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:58.450 
sure if I'm not going to and like one
bad<00:04:57.050> thing<00:04:57.080> about<00:04:57.229> mega<00:04:57.560> bloks<00:04:57.889> there's

00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:58.460 
bad thing about mega bloks there's

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:00.300 
bad thing about mega bloks there's
nothing<00:04:58.760> really<00:04:58.910> to<00:04:59.030> the<00:04:59.360> set<00:04:59.570> it's<00:04:59.840> just<00:05:00.110> like

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:00.310 
nothing really to the set it's just like

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:05.230 
nothing really to the set it's just like
go<00:05:01.310> to<00:05:01.370> look<00:05:01.699> at<00:05:02.889> no<00:05:03.889> like<00:05:04.340> figures<00:05:04.820> are<00:05:05.060> in<00:05:05.150> a

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:05.240 
go to look at no like figures are in a

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:09.460 
go to look at no like figures are in a
hang<00:05:07.360> so<00:05:08.360> this<00:05:08.479> is<00:05:08.510> pretty<00:05:08.750> much<00:05:08.870> this

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:09.470 
hang so this is pretty much this

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:14.320 
hang so this is pretty much this
