00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
but how do we get to this from a slide

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.900 
but how do we get to this from a slide
that<00:00:24.180> started<00:00:24.689> out<00:00:24.809> like<00:00:24.989> this<00:00:25.520> the<00:00:26.520> key<00:00:26.730> is

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
that started out like this the key is

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.880 
that started out like this the key is
understanding<00:00:27.210> how<00:00:27.660> slides<00:00:28.050> layouts<00:00:28.500> and

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
understanding how slides layouts and

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.120 
understanding how slides layouts and
placeholders<00:00:29.550> work<00:00:29.790> let's<00:00:30.329> take<00:00:30.540> a<00:00:30.570> look

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:31.130 
placeholders work let's take a look

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:33.440 
placeholders work let's take a look
placeholders<00:00:32.130> are<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.520> areas<00:00:32.910> on<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.210> slide

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
placeholders are the areas on the slide

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.470 
placeholders are the areas on the slide
enclosed<00:00:33.930> by<00:00:34.170> little<00:00:34.500> dotted<00:00:34.829> lines

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:35.480 
enclosed by little dotted lines

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.010 
enclosed by little dotted lines
placeholders<00:00:36.480> can<00:00:36.690> contain<00:00:37.079> text<00:00:38.989> some<00:00:39.989> of

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
placeholders can contain text some of

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.080 
placeholders can contain text some of
them<00:00:40.260> can<00:00:40.469> even<00:00:40.500> contain<00:00:41.100> things<00:00:41.310> like<00:00:41.490> tables

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
them can even contain things like tables

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.020 
them can even contain things like tables

and pictures just hover over the

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.670 
and pictures just hover over the
commands<00:00:45.360> in<00:00:45.540> the<00:00:45.690> placeholder<00:00:46.230> to<00:00:46.350> see<00:00:46.530> what

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
commands in the placeholder to see what

you can do the way these placeholders

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.440 
you can do the way these placeholders
are<00:00:49.470> arranged<00:00:49.980> on<00:00:50.130> the<00:00:50.160> slide<00:00:50.520> has<00:00:50.880> to<00:00:50.910> do<00:00:51.270> with

of a section header to open a menu of

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.770 
of a section header to open a menu of
all<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.100> different<00:01:11.280> slide<00:01:11.820> layouts<00:01:11.850> all<00:01:12.509> we

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
all the different slide layouts all we

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.510 
all the different slide layouts all we
have<00:01:12.929> to<00:01:13.109> do<00:01:13.259> is<00:01:13.439> click<00:01:13.679> the<00:01:13.859> layout<00:01:14.189> command

have to do is click the layout command

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.120 
have to do is click the layout command
in<00:01:14.759> the<00:01:15.270> slides<00:01:15.539> group<00:01:15.689> here<00:01:16.619> we<00:01:16.740> can<00:01:16.889> see<00:01:17.100> that

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
in the slides group here we can see that

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.039 
in the slides group here we can see that
this<00:01:17.460> slide<00:01:17.700> is<00:01:17.909> using<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.389> two<00:01:18.569> content

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
this slide is using the two content

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.109 
this slide is using the two content
layout<00:01:19.139> but<00:01:19.889> based<00:01:20.100> on<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.429> thumbnail<00:01:20.819> for

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
layout but based on the thumbnail for

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.179 
layout but based on the thumbnail for
section<00:01:21.689> header<00:01:21.929> I<00:01:22.200> think<00:01:22.590> this<00:01:22.799> one<00:01:23.009> would<00:01:23.159> be

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
section header I think this one would be

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.020 
section header I think this one would be
a<00:01:23.310> better<00:01:23.549> fit<00:01:23.819> just<00:01:24.569> click<00:01:24.840> to<00:01:24.869> change<00:01:25.259> and

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
a better fit just click to change and

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:27.980 
a better fit just click to change and
this<00:01:27.030> is<00:01:27.270> perfect

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
this is perfect

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.510 
this is perfect
PowerPoint<00:01:28.530> immediately<00:01:29.039> takes<00:01:29.310> the

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
contents of my placeholders applies the

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.499 
contents of my placeholders applies the
new<00:01:31.799> layout<00:01:32.280> and<00:01:32.520> even<00:01:32.850> modifies<00:01:33.270> the

formatting to better fit the purpose of

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.940 
formatting to better fit the purpose of

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
perfect but needs a little reworking

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.389 
perfect but needs a little reworking
this<00:01:42.479> looks<00:01:42.810> great<00:01:43.109> for<00:01:43.289> example<00:01:43.409> but<00:01:44.219> the

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
this looks great for example but the

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:14.210 
here I thought I'd show you how to use
the<00:02:12.000> command<00:02:12.390> just<00:02:13.110> go<00:02:13.349> to<00:02:13.410> the<00:02:13.590> insert<00:02:13.950> tab

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
the command just go to the insert tab

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.699 
and click text box
textboxes<00:02:19.239> are<00:02:19.450> especially<00:02:19.750> useful<00:02:20.170> if<00:02:20.590> you

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:20.709 
textboxes are especially useful if you

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:22.500 
textboxes are especially useful if you
ever<00:02:20.890> decide<00:02:21.310> to<00:02:21.340> use<00:02:21.610> a<00:02:21.640> blank<00:02:21.970> slide<00:02:22.209> that
