it's<00:02:19.970> like<00:02:20.239> five<00:02:20.930> guys<00:02:21.200> running<00:02:21.650> the

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:21.769 
it's like five guys running the

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:24.220 
it's like five guys running the
100-meter<00:02:22.370> sprint<00:02:22.760> and<00:02:23.239> then<00:02:23.720> the<00:02:23.840> starter

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
100-meter sprint and then the starter

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.440 
100-meter sprint and then the starter
pistol<00:02:24.620> goes<00:02:24.799> one<00:02:25.489> can<00:02:25.700> run<00:02:25.880> away<00:02:25.970> and<00:02:26.329> then

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
pistol goes one can run away and then

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:27.640 
pistol goes one can run away and then
the<00:02:26.480> other<00:02:26.570> four<00:02:26.930> find<00:02:27.230> that<00:02:27.410> they've<00:02:27.530> had

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
the other four find that they've had

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.500 
the other four find that they've had
their<00:02:27.860> shoelaces<00:02:28.040> tied<00:02:28.549> together<00:02:28.760> whether

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
their shoelaces tied together whether

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.420 
their shoelaces tied together whether
it's<00:02:29.660> a<00:02:29.750> game<00:02:29.930> or<00:02:30.110> no<00:02:30.260> it's<00:02:30.680> still<00:02:30.860> not<00:02:31.010> fair<00:02:31.190> so

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
it's a game or no it's still not fair so

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.520 
it's a game or no it's still not fair so
yeah<00:02:31.610> I<00:02:31.940> did<00:02:32.660> that<00:02:32.750> video<00:02:32.900> Berryman

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
yeah I did that video Berryman

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.500 
yeah I did that video Berryman
apparently<00:02:34.400> had<00:02:34.519> a<00:02:34.549> lot<00:02:34.760> of<00:02:34.790> flack<00:02:35.090> about<00:02:35.120> it<00:02:35.360> a

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
apparently had a lot of flack about it a

and hackers reset and he got reset so

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:48.640 
and hackers reset and he got reset so
clearly<00:02:47.120> was<00:02:47.360> but<00:02:47.570> at<00:02:47.750> about<00:02:48.079> it<00:02:48.230> and<00:02:48.320> decided

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
clearly was but at about it and decided

to threaten to shoot me over went to his

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:53.410 
to threaten to shoot me over went to his
house<00:02:51.260> which<00:02:51.709> is<00:02:51.950> pretty<00:02:52.489> unlikely<00:02:52.850> because

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
house which is pretty unlikely because

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.210

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:06.480 
gonna go and visit a man who I
ported<00:03:05.080> for<00:03:05.290> hacking<00:03:05.650> because<00:03:06.160> I<00:03:06.250> think<00:03:06.430> you

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:06.490 
ported for hacking because I think you

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:08.130 
ported for hacking because I think you
might<00:03:06.610> shoot<00:03:06.880> me<00:03:07.060> but<00:03:07.510> there's<00:03:07.720> a<00:03:07.780> chance<00:03:07.990> I

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
might shoot me but there's a chance I

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:09.210 
might shoot me but there's a chance I
might<00:03:08.170> knock<00:03:08.440> on<00:03:08.590> his<00:03:08.709> door<00:03:08.740> and<00:03:08.980> he'll<00:03:09.100> have

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
might knock on his door and he'll have

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.690 
might knock on his door and he'll have
tea<00:03:09.430> and<00:03:09.580> cake<00:03:09.790> instead<00:03:10.150> what<00:03:10.870> a<00:03:10.900> prick<00:03:11.260> anyway

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
tea and cake instead what a prick anyway

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.860 
tea and cake instead what a prick anyway
kind<00:03:12.700> of<00:03:12.760> going<00:03:12.970> off<00:03:13.060> the<00:03:13.180> subject<00:03:13.390> here<00:03:13.720> in

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
kind of going off the subject here in

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:14.940 
kind of going off the subject here in
the<00:03:13.990> background<00:03:14.380> you've<00:03:14.500> probably<00:03:14.709> noticed

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
the background you've probably noticed

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.730 
the background you've probably noticed
pre<00:03:15.580> the<00:03:16.000> game<00:03:16.180> starting<00:03:16.780> why<00:03:17.110> I<00:03:17.140> to<00:03:17.319> always

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:17.740 
pre the game starting why I to always

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:19.110 
pre the game starting why I to always
tend<00:03:17.980> to<00:03:18.069> do<00:03:18.190> and<00:03:18.340> this<00:03:18.400> is<00:03:18.580> a<00:03:18.610> modern<00:03:18.940> warfare

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
tend to do and this is a modern warfare

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.610 
tend to do and this is a modern warfare
2<00:03:19.450> thinking<00:03:19.870> if<00:03:19.959> you<00:03:20.050> don't<00:03:20.230> do<00:03:20.350> this<00:03:20.470> I

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
2 thinking if you don't do this I

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.229 
2 thinking if you don't do this I
suggest<00:03:20.950> you<00:03:21.040> do<00:03:21.220> it<00:03:21.340> if<00:03:21.459> you<00:03:21.580> play<00:03:21.760> free<00:03:22.030> for

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 
suggest you do it if you play free for

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:23.640 
suggest you do it if you play free for
all<00:03:22.300> but<00:03:22.630> you<00:03:22.690> probably<00:03:22.930> do<00:03:23.140> do<00:03:23.290> it<00:03:23.350> anyway<00:03:23.620> so

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
all but you probably do do it anyway so

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:26.490 
all but you probably do do it anyway so
I'm<00:03:24.010> just<00:03:24.250> it's<00:03:24.580> just<00:03:24.670> hot<00:03:25.060> air<00:03:25.090> why<00:03:26.080> always<00:03:26.290> do

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
I'm just it's just hot air why always do

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.050 
I'm just it's just hot air why always do
is<00:03:26.620> always<00:03:27.010> have<00:03:27.130> a<00:03:27.160> scan<00:03:27.459> through<00:03:27.670> people's

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
is always have a scan through people's

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:29.760 
is always have a scan through people's
loud<00:03:28.330> outs<00:03:28.569> and<00:03:28.870> have<00:03:29.170> a<00:03:29.200> look<00:03:29.350> at<00:03:29.470> the<00:03:29.590> games

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:29.770 
loud outs and have a look at the games

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:32.160 
loud outs and have a look at the games
already<00:03:29.980> in<00:03:30.190> process<00:03:30.720> and<00:03:31.720> this<00:03:31.840> came<00:03:32.080> from

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
already in process and this came from

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:33.809 
already in process and this came from
modern<00:03:32.470> warfare<00:03:32.620> 2<00:03:32.950> with<00:03:33.160> the<00:03:33.190> whole<00:03:33.340> poster

00:03:33.809 --> 00:03:33.819 
modern warfare 2 with the whole poster

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:36.000 
modern warfare 2 with the whole poster
thing<00:03:34.030> it<00:03:34.750> was<00:03:34.870> a<00:03:34.900> little<00:03:35.170> sandy<00:03:35.440> ravaged<00:03:35.739> tip

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
thing it was a little sandy ravaged tip

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:37.800 
thing it was a little sandy ravaged tip
which<00:03:36.370> I<00:03:36.640> found<00:03:36.910> to<00:03:37.030> be<00:03:37.120> very<00:03:37.209> very<00:03:37.570> helpful

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
which I found to be very very helpful

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:37.060 
and bear it back out but I decided to

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:39.540

put on the m16 and go ham because the

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:42.390 
put on the m16 and go ham because the
m16<00:04:40.060> is<00:04:40.300> generally<00:04:40.750> a<00:04:40.780> one-hit<00:04:41.229> kill<00:04:41.470> even
