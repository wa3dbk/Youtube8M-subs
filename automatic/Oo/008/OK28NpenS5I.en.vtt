00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 the test of chevrolet montana week 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.410
 sport that attracts looks by design by 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.540
 Bucket size 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.090
 but the weak engine pickup sees the 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:16.560
 qualities and defects pointed out by 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:19.740
 corn on the outside beautiful viola on inside bread 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:23.070
 but what does this saying have to 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:25.920
 to see with the new mountain is that underneath 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.890
 of this screen inspired by agile body 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.750
 the new compact pickup truck of the GM hides a 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.660
 platform that is older than 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:36.180
 that she replaced or is 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.550
 same as the veteran Corsican classic who is 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.309
 of two generations past 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.079
 everything to reduce costs of production 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.200
 for those who expected something new from gm 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:49.559
 another disappointment since the agile them the same 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:52.260
 sorry philosophy because this old 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.149
 platform brings some problems where 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.670
 not allow stability to be 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:59.370
 wait for a new car a good one 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.800
 sound insulation does not have the 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.900
 front subchassi as in the current corsa 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.330
 at least draws attention 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:10.150
 with the size that puts it between pickups 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.750
 compact and medium forward fell very 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:12.550
 good 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.400
 the new one- hour shock with the 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:17.620
 bust and the bucket has 1,100 liters of 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:20.350
 ability to carry large 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:22.990
 volumes of the spouse and that 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.760
 pleases fans of this type of car only 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.400
 still lacking a version with 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:29.730
 cabin stretched a road and know the 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:33.310
 that make the greatest success 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:35.940
 the space behind the seats is reasonable and 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:38.920
 in this version sports nets and porta-objects 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:40.900
 help you take a couple of things 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.150
 people with well- adjusted 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:45.580
 but the interior should have 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:47.350
 best quality and finer grips 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:50.080
 neat in general 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:52.380
 to compensate does not jump so much even empty 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:55.390
 favoring comfort 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:58.210
 a cool detail of the new mountain is the 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:01.000
 rear visibility for sure. 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:03.100
 the best among pickup trucks in the 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.290
 It's a wonder but the format of the 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:09.220
 glass cover and the hopper cover 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:11.650
 makes speaking task easier. 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:14.290
 in a bucket an intelligent solution to 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:17.110
 key on the cover allows protection 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:19.570
 objects left inside it and the 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.580
 system drive that only the steppe 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:24.760
 avoiding thefts 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:28.180
 the mechanics there are no news uses the engine 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:30.670
 chevrolet 1.4 econoflex and provides 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:33.100
 excellent 102 horses when stocked 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:36.160
 with alcohol and allows for 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:38.890
 reasonable but when it is empty with 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:41.100
 loads in which a lack of torque is only 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:46.900
 possible of the engine with larger displacement 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:49.750
 At this time of longing for the old mdb 1.8 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.970
 the problem is also reflected in the consumption 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.079
 which should be better for the engine 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.239
 this big 

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:57.670
 how much acceleration it takes to have 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:03:01.269
 consistent answers mainly 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:03.099
 when it is charged it ends up spending a 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:07.000
 position to drive higher in relation to 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:09.489
 to foreign exchange coupons and awards 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.260
 the pleasure of driving is only 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:14.049
 committed in the corners 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:16.510
 I do not have a tendency to leave training anymore 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:19.930
 the other death in all the items of 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:21.870
 safety and standard equipment but 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:24.609
 do not be fooled by this good relationship 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:26.680
 cost-benefit a larger engine and 

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:29.579
 more modern chassis and should 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.579
 part of package 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:41.030
 curious to know the notes 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:45.410
 so let's go and who does not know 7 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:49.930

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:57.350
 the chevrolet montana 1.4 sport has 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:59.870
 price of 44 thousand and forty reais 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:02.180
 the only option is the metallic paint 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:03.020
 which costs another eight hundred twenty-seven 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:06.430
