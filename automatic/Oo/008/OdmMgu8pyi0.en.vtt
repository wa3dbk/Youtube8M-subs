strong Lorene figure if you don't have
one<00:03:22.680> yet<00:03:22.829> I'd<00:03:23.129> say<00:03:23.400> get<00:03:23.579> this<00:03:23.790> one<00:03:23.940> this<00:03:24.180> is<00:03:24.239> the

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:24.389 
one yet I'd say get this one this is the

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:26.240 
one yet I'd say get this one this is the
I<00:03:24.750> think<00:03:25.109> this<00:03:25.379> is<00:03:25.500> the<00:03:25.560> best<00:03:25.650> paint<00:03:25.949> job<00:03:26.129> and

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
I think this is the best paint job and

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:27.800 
I think this is the best paint job and
everything<00:03:26.400> so<00:03:27.359> this<00:03:27.540> is<00:03:27.569> the<00:03:27.659> best

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
everything so this is the best

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.050 
everything so this is the best
