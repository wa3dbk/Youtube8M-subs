 the audi forum neckarsulm 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:17.349
 it is here since may 2005 

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:20.800
 the prestigious construction of the brand 

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:23.380
 the four rings on three floors 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:26.020
 extends the 18-meter high building 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:29.650
 and offers customers insights into the 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:31.240
 History of the brand current models and 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:35.470
 handing over a new car for 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:37.840
 Self-collector since the opening 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:40.800
 the glass construction registers over one 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.800
 million visitors 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:49.360
 In the middle of 2007, the site gets a place 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:51.550
 new highlight for the visitors audi 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.410
 decides one two years ago 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:54.220
 Sports car in the Neckarsulm plant too 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:56.920
 manufacture 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:59.500
 The Audi R8 is said to be the competence of the brand 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.690
 reflect in the body lightweight construction 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:04.379
 and against established sports cars 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:04.379
 push through 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:11.500
 Audi now has around 16,000 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:13.000
 sports car sold worldwide in 2010 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.990
 you decide one more thing 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.050
 draufzulegen 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:21.880
 one limited to 333 pieces 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:24.869
 special series of audi r8 gt more power 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:27.560
 less weight for the unit price of 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.299
 193,000 euros 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:33.009
 the new high performance is being built 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:33.009
 Sports car in the Neckarsulm plant 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.580
 we have here at neckarsulm 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:42.560
 already the beginning of nineties so 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.850
 started aluminum vehicles too 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:48.680
 develop and build 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:50.450
 194, the audi a8 went into series here and 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.360
 at the same time was the audi 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.430
 aluminum center founded here around the 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.930
 material aluminum still further and 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.360
 to examine more deeply 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:03.860
 Audi has been producing for over 17 years 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:07.580
 aluminum cars 1994 comes the 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:09.860
 top class sedan a8 on the market the 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:13.090
 first mass-produced car with self-supporting 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:16.010
 body through the alu spaceframe 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.350
 construction loses the limousine around 40 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:21.410
 percent of weight 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:22.330
 the construction of the first eight weighs only 245 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.739
 kilo 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:27.620
 Meanwhile, the diet has all 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:29.780
 Of course, the model achieves that 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.850
 lightweight construction meanwhile also goes on 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.400
 on many other materials 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:36.350
 was extended from now the 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.700
 audi leitbau center is no longer 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:39.650
 only on the report on aluminum 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:43.570
 focused but also different 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:47.390
 Focus on other lightweight construction materials 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:49.230
 in sports car r8 popular audi his race 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.599
 Gene again 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.849
 the r8 is not a simple variation 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:57.269
 his sister model and lamborghini 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:03:00.060
 He barely shares gallardo with him 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:03.569
 Aluminum chassis and four-wheel drive 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:07.739
 the engine of the first r8 was after the 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:11.069
 modular principle from the audi rs4 its 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:13.799
 but had beginnings in racing already 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:16.110
 In the thirties, auto union starts 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:18.230
 the ideal weight distribution through 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:21.450
 the medium engine design is achieved 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:24.390
 in the 80s audi celebrated big 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:26.000
 racing successes with the ur quattro dem 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:28.650
 first mass-produced vehicle with 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.930
 permanent four-wheel drive the 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:34.349
 term r8, however, comes from the 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:37.660
 Racing prototypes since 1999 

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:41.320
 participate in the 24 hours of le mans 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:43.600
 with 61 victories in 74 races is 

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:45.550
 the racing car audi r8 one of the 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.590
 most successful sports prototypes of all 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:49.330
 times 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:51.670
 2005 ends his career in 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:52.650
 road sports car with the same name becomes 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:54.850
 built 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:58.060
 the study is presented publicly 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:59.560
 during the iaa 2003 from the then audi 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.260
 Chef Martin Winterkorn 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:04.030
 After the reaction of the audience 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.830
 is positive is audi out 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:06.540
 the study of a series sports car 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:09.160
 to build 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:11.490
 2006 then how much he version as 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:14.440
 audi r8 left on the street 

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:16.660
 diploma engineer rainer greedy is 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:31.080
 head of sports car manufacturing and is 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:31.080
 we are convinced by the material aluminum 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:38.950
 have normal as the front lag 

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:40.630
 why do you do that is smarter 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:44.260
 lightweight construction here at the r8 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:46.090
 application finds around 210 kilo raw bodies 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.670
 achieve weight without attachments too 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:50.470
 can crash at a very good rate 

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:52.150
 stiffness person needs stiffness 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:53.500
 Of course, the lightweight intelligence 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:55.750
 to use I can bring them to you 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:57.310
 show an example if you are here 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:59.100
 longitudinal members look at them 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:00.910
 relatively inconspicuous but he has one 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:03.460
 specific inner life 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:04.930
 As you can see we have here continuously 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:07.720
 stiffen that too a beach party 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:09.370
 profile which is produced in this way 

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:11.260
 by passing the material through a slot 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:13.590
 Aperture pressed through and then generates 

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:16.510
 asked staff in this geometry 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:18.220
 brought this part here to use 

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:20.080
 and through these intelligent ones inside 

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:22.600
 Of course, stiffeners take that exactly 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:24.190
 in the finally justice on 

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:27.090
 the developers for this vehicle 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:27.090
 also calculated
