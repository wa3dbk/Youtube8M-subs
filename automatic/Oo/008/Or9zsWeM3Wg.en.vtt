00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520
 you come back in this second video of 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:08.569
 today guys where this is how that 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.569
 the beginning of inter 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.509
 here are the files in between a video 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.529
 welcome guys in this second 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.570
 video of today's gp special dedicated to 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.759
 you have just 38 inter then stay 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.710
 still a bit laughing anyway, she 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:33.510
 we are really talking about the event 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.790
 is carried out by computer and 9 May a 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.140
 parma understood what we did and 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.339
 nothing to come along to reveal it is 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.440
 instead they played a game in the square 

00:00:38.339 --> 00:00:42.930
 occupied all the tampered space 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.030
 two tents in one had placed the 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.460
 overclock station and or panic nitrogen 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.680
 with an ICS and 99 icepower masses 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.260
 reveal to us the yellow one that in short 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:55.650
 ultra figar beast and above it was mounted 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:58.170
 in 7 59 60x which should start from 3 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:01.680
 gb for now they have taken it to 5.7 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.989
 gigahertz with voltage 1.69 2 107.7 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.240
 moment of pique then in truth 5.6 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.280
 who read exactly made a big one 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.110
 overclock and I think we did too 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.020
 a nice record in boys' temperature 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.420
 they were 110 degrees minus that is the nitrogen arrives 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.400
 at least 220 and the one to deprive and them 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.720
 like a processor then hangs underneath 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.060
 one completed the tour work alan held at 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.950
 less than to 110 clarici during test ie 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.810
 absurd things then used 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.100
 also in skates we will do some pictures 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.409
 see a kind of what they are called 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.060
 by thermal ones if not and it is called proper 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.920
 xstrata mick e. heat gun 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.260
 practically when and processor gone 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.940
 under too hot temperatures by appointment 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.979
 and warmed up so to start again because below 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.540
 the fewer 125 processors go off hex 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.710
 that it doesn't work anymore and therefore it 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.360
 warms up to restart 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.010
 sure he did a good job then we have 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.050
 even the kingston things 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:48.330
 it seems to me the new agriteatro ramps 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:51.150
 the father predicted them by 3000 3g thanks 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:52.920
 why not ddr4 to 760 in short then 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:53.580
 in short, everything else where dailan did 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.930
 a great job 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.700
 beyond all this there was also one 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.100
 fantastic simulation station or 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.780
 of two of simulator factory that 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.210
 practically makes available the 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.550
 brand new combined project card think 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.780
 a bit of opus rick taylor swift era 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:08.940
 made available head tip 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.380
 computer science and at the same time you also see in 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.050
 all its subsidiaries of its associates 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.540
 because it is supplying sulpizi 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.640
 limiting yourself to trying will make you try e 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.950
 see how it works but other than that 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.840
 precisely two factory simulators 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.970
 faction proposed this one 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.410
 position with the chair behind the wheel all 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.270
 and hit the computer and made us 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.400
 try the curious rift that we in a 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:32.160
 video so long ago we used to scream 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.780
 But we were there all the fun 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.700
 best thing in the world made boys 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.020
 we have already done scans in live since 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.459
 Confitarma for herat services and 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.350
 I often say so many things that in the video I don't 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:41.700
 we have time idv is in short has us 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.950
 followed because it really is really a 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.540
 nice job seems to be in fact hoping 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.130
 to buy the curtains myself 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.230
 agree that we'll see a little more from 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.520
 me but also to tell you how it works 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.080
 that thing there when I am 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.880
 put I thought I had what it was 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.980
 in the cockpit of the car I touched 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.840
 the monitor screen because I thought there 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.519
 was the camera to look for les 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.200
 combes 8 pisa keys at auction house part 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:03.480
 we invite you to go and repeat theirs 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.920
 memo page of two of factory 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.360
 simulator you can see the videos there 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.010
 they did it because we are here too 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.750
 just page and go to their store 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.489
 which is located in three videos in the province of 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.930
 bergamo where you can find beyond that 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:15.360
 this simulation also loco luz e 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.810
 so to try everything in other words 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.640
 world 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:20.160
 in short they were also the boys of 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:22.920
 finding the stuff is paying for it 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:25.320
 2k games we had two beautiful ram 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.280
 if not bring home anything but skill 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.140
 to greet all who are 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.970
 come to see us who lived but you have been 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:31.380
 the top of the top can also eat turned 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.959
 offered by a girl who was relative 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:36.560
 to a certified 15 beast logic 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:38.780
 certified grab 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.849
 and then nothing follows the given precisely the 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.890
 aqap hunter shop that we say is 

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:45.349
 maybe half of what Bergamo is about 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:47.420
 but it practically forms the contents 

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:49.670
 they are the same as those issued per master 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:52.130
 king ie all the various well 33 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:52.610
 PC play stations are a 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:54.019
 value 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:56.569
 they also have position three 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:58.130
 screens with short, prevent a hood 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:00.920
 formatica slightly smaller words 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:02.900
 of canteens with the same things if you are in 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:05.540
 if you are from Reggio Emilia, go and do it 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.860
 a jump because it's nice as a store and 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.360
 no full boys concludes let's say 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:09.830
 that there were also to our friends of 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:11.780
 e.coli who made a lot of fun with photos 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:14.319
 detailed that surely are 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:16.519
 superior to those pictures we take 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:18.859
 however now November quarters 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:21.049
 thank luca she was there with us in short 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:24.139
 cut the fall though if you want 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:25.610
 go of the photos you go up it is also 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:27.290
 view to play definitely has it 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:29.270
 made an article within the meaning no 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:31.430
 we salute you and I recommend boys to 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:33.500
 next event that becomes roche ea 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:35.720
 carrara surely at the end of May 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:37.850
 beginning of June we will also be there so there 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.380
 let's see there, but don't lose yourself next 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:41.419
 institutions at the head because they are is 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:43.190
 truly topless trade the 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:44.510
 shop so nitrogen high schools 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:49.520
 they make a liquid nitrogen event 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:51.110
 always first forum or go to work 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:52.430
 and no kid screwing up for 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:54.890
 Thursday I made both 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:56.539
 of the weapon Thursday indeed three because 

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:59.680
 he believed there was live in tonight 

00:04:56.539 --> 00:05:01.820
 exclusive a new guest of ms ai 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:03.140
 guys today Thursday pro you owe 

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:04.220
 was June 3 on youtube or watch 

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:06.080
 video denise karbon 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:08.450
 cs practically if you also want to 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:10.280
 mammon great do it today us 

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:13.070
 special day they let know in 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:14.900
 turn and then I'll see you tonight them 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:16.039
 do the Sunday internal course and then 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:18.080
 the mail you broke activates 

00:05:16.039 --> 00:05:23.020
 based on a path of non-social life 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:23.020
 it really wouldn't look good bye guys
