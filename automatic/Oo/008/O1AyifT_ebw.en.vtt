00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.790
 hello girls hello guys welcome back to that 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.770
 beautiful at last with you again and today 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.469
 I didn't want to talk about make up but I wanted to 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.639
 talk to you about something you ask me 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:14.429
 especially often with emails 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.859
 private or you know that I in 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.080
 past I had a skin that has passed 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.510
 from the cicatricial machines problem 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.890
 dermatological has a skin that is itself 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.830
 sensitized to aggressive treatments 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.439
 and tending however pimples and blackheads 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.840
 I don't want to play doctor and 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.210
 I am not addressing those with skin 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.700
 therefore, in dermatological situations 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.340
 I'm talking about an acne skin with 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.440
 serious inflammations but I speak of one 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.660
 skin like mine is very mixed or 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.450
 fat in a non pathological way but of 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.860
 intrinsic characteristic of the title vi 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.530
 he says buffon blackheads 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.989
 goodbye yes because it's something I don't have 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.300
 found only on me but over the years 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.860
 I listened to my beautician work 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.809
 also on the institute's clients for the 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.629
 what work we have had 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.670
 incredible results and me first and 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.049
 so I really want to talk about what 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.810
 is the wheel string that has me 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.890
 changed life and that regularly 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:10.470
 when my skin returns to be 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:14.930
 particularly mixed I propose again on di 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:17.850
 me first then the first rule 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:19.619
 constancy the results are not obtained in 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.450
 one day especially when we have 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.930
 a skin that has a characteristic 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:27.150
 innate of that type I talk about 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.590
 one of a skin carrot in which it must 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.140
 be carried out regularly 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.210
 weekly but that really changes the 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.680
 skin or at least changed it to me and to many 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.630
 people 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.509
 first of all the cleansing on a skin 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.630
 mixed girls always deduction areas 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:44.640
 rinsing always because you have to remove 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.970
 excess sebum I advise you to 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:50.070
 example a gel formulation why not 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:53.100
 containing them does not go to i to produce 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:55.200
 I follow on the skin is always the tonic 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.280
 tonic and fundamental if possible 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.140
 without alcohol 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.710
 unless you have a need is 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.060
 particularly antibacterial effect 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.549
 always because regular from the ph 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.259
 having said that these are the three products 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.060
 all of which have changed my life 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:11.340
 of the same brand that it said to a 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.740
 professional beauty brand that 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.180
 we have 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:16.600
 we had in the spa where I worked 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:19.660
 for many years and in particular yes 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.380
 plays peeling in this way once 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.110
 per week 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:25.990
 a scrub as you prefer the skype is 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.940
 a bag manufacturer so you don't have to 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:29.890
 just choose the intensity of the 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.960
 dispossession then the arrogance of 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:35.560
 exfoliating grain based on what it is 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:37.030
 reactive your skin des quatre the 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.070
 disco a green is a product that exists 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.860
 in this company type from the 50s and 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:43.960
 it is called in slang descaling because 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.450
 because it has a lot of action 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:48.460
 particular that is called conic 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.230
 that is, he manages to enter the pole a 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:52.840
 empty it and bring it to the surface 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:55.390
 what's inside so the thing 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.850
 crazy of this product is really 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:00.490
 how it changes the color also of the 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:01.990
 leather when we use it maximum 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:03.820
 twice a week 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:05.110
 maximum you have to be very careful 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:08.560
 use because it is important 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:10.300
 rinse it well and moisten the 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.610
 skin with warm water is taken 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.590
 a small walnut is worked well on the 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:17.650
 leather with sponges or with a cloth in 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:19.810
 microfibre , rinsing wet wipes 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.610
 hands and oar tasting on the skin 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.350
 without product you will see that the 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:24.940
 product seems to appear 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:27.640
 suddenly because he returns to 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.440
 excited and rinsed surface 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.150
 this operation must be done three times 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:34.240
 to make sure you have eliminated 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.220
 just the whole product that I went into 

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:37.990
 depth 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.880
 then you always know that tonic 

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:42.640
 therefore water always eliminates water 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:44.830
 reapplied the tonic applied the masca 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:47.770
 deafening is a powerful mask a 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:50.200
 clay base 15 minutes posing and 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:52.030
 you can on two fundamental uses on 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:54.730
 the whole skin if you have a skin from 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:57.040
 very mixed with fat or only in areas 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:04:00.700
 where you have imperfections for a skin from 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:02.470
 normal amistÃ  is portentous girls me 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:04.570
 continue to buy it at buy it at 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:08.770
 buy it and had it at home for all 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:10.600
 life and a bit fiant these not 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:13.660
 be very particular see if not 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:16.209
 an oily composition is actually one 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:18.070
 more alcoholic composition is possible 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:21.120
 apply on the cotton pad e 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:23.310
 buffered directly on the imperfection 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:26.370
 or I put a few drops in it 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:28.050
 fluid 24 hours I was going to apply 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:31.410
 on the skin this once a day 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:32.850
 you can then do it depending on my type 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:34.979
 of skin there is no water to make our own 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:36.660
 because to show you why I finish it 

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:39.330
 it looks like the same brand because me 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:40.979
 like how I told you to use so many times 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:42.930
 a project that is started and finished 

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:45.180
 they do not take a product here and there 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:47.060
 with different products and active ingredients 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:49.500
 that can cost between them 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:51.720
 I used the dramatic fluids that it is 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:54.240
 a very light moisturizer looks like water 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:55.860
 that magnificent or the cream and para 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.960
 travis that precisely specifies instead 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:59.789
 when the skin is really oily 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:02.820
 periods when my skin was put on 

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:05.430
 little bit worse the skin changes from 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:07.229
 so I can guarantee you so 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:09.000
 among other things I do not have to make you 

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:11.910
 see but of this company always 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.560
 uses flights munitions limonese is one 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:15.600
 complete line but in this case of 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:18.449
 I used the mask and it is a mask 

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:19.979
 that through the photon risks a 

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:21.840
 very particular active ingredient 

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:24.120
 increases the immune defenses of 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:26.220
 leather and then strengthens it 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:27.750
 why check browse can 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:30.510
 attack the skin especially one 

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:32.160
 skin that is me but reactive and therefore me 

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:34.380
 once a week did the nascar 

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:36.300
 serban and once weekly munitions 

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:37.410
 this is my experience but 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:39.479
 the experience I had also 

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:42.510
 working on so many people I can 

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:44.280
 ensure that of all that I have 

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:46.860
 tried in my life and I've tried 

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:48.630
 really many with these products 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:51.120
 I put my hand on the fire to me they have 

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:55.620
 changed my life so I know I don't 

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:57.419
 they are cheap though rather than 

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:59.550
 try so many crap or what not 

00:05:57.419 --> 00:06:01.500
 change nothing is better in my opinion 

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:02.970
 have a more professional approach 

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:04.710
 because these are not cosmetics 

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:07.080
 generic and just a line 

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:09.720
 professional that I really have 

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:11.289
 changed life without being aggressive 

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:14.589
 is 

00:06:11.289 --> 00:06:15.999
 without having particular risks also 

00:06:14.589 --> 00:06:17.529
 on reactive skin because mine is 

00:06:15.999 --> 00:06:18.879
 very reactive 

00:06:17.529 --> 00:06:20.919
 I hope there have been many girls 

00:06:18.879 --> 00:06:23.639
 I send you a big kiss and see you 

00:06:20.919 --> 00:06:23.639
 to the next video
