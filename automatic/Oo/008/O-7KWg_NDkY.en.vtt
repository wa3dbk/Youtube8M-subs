 what scientists want to see feel the first semifinal in hamburg 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:26.409
 from the Europa League 

00:00:26.409 --> 00:00:29.249
 That does not only mean a German English confrontation 

00:00:29.249 --> 00:00:33.300
 also a duel between two old spiers of fc groningen eric nÃ¨ve land and marcus 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.030
 mountain came 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:36.230
 h we have had 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:38.230

 he left early Tuesday afternoon and 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:44.150
 let us do that 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.250
 who ravaged much of Europe last week 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.090
 Latvia came in Groningen in the fall of 2010 and immediately made a big impression 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:01.320
 by scoring during his debut against FC Twente now keep empty but an end 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.530
 The netherlands scores the end of in its first match for Groningen 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.970
 It lands a 114 games for FC Groningen to 48 goals one of those 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.960
 goals was the first official goals 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.740
 euroborg at neverland sij 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.600
 appears from and just then makes his first official goal in the Euroborg 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.880
 Marcus Berg came to Groningen in the summer of 2007 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.960
 as a successor to louis laros 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:31.830
 Roxette played more of six months together when FC Groningen came in one 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:33.400
 match both to score 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.400
 too dangerous on 25 November 2007 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.850
 leave voluntarily 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:54.850
 however, he has a good player 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.880
 Playing with him in it is a very good one 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.850
 there is one with splashing home year or so yaris 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.939
 that says it is a good player charity 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:08.790
 some 

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:10.579
 it getting better and better 

00:02:10.579 --> 00:02:13.579
 an internal supervision wft leaked yesterday 

00:02:15.789 --> 00:02:19.999
 my first it remains the country colors fc groningen the netherlands are in gorleben 

00:02:19.999 --> 00:02:25.269
 magic hat of the IJssel region left in early 2008 with another London to 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:26.719
 found playing football 

00:02:26.719 --> 00:02:30.009
 it has not become a great success of the norwegian striker in the netherlands 

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:32.550
 mainly on the couch it has been very good 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:33.929
 and of course not too far 

00:02:33.929 --> 00:02:37.249
 it was played and not in the base 

00:02:37.249 --> 00:02:39.129
 normally only 

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:42.099
 played the premier league and a second row 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:45.099
 we have been able to experience things and that is 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:50.849
 Hedel became very nice Voorburg is the transition to behold in mid-2009 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:51.309
 Which 

00:02:51.309 --> 00:02:53.189
 also not a success story 

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:55.790
 he has ruud van nistelrooy in front of him and also came 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.129
 but few to score the bundesliga and the larger year 

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:02.939
 yes the club is a big club like that 

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:07.239
 and his city according to so I think 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:09.879
 unfortunately on a large mountain while purchasing a 

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:10.869
 not in action 

00:03:10.869 --> 00:03:14.489
 they were both allowed to walk why, but they don't get play minutes when they are not years old 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:15.949
 play freely 

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:18.769
 one has defended in the match and 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:21.769
 you don't have to put the attack and test it 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:24.849
 fell on the couch 

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:27.620
 The Netherlands returns to the Norwegian Stavanger after this season 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:30.930
 to play football there at his old club viking that was 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.329
 6 time for something it's easy to no 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:35.819
 in the test whole family one 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:38.609
 work it down 

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:40.879
 mountain of hope that follows 

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:44.049
 season in hamburg to show that he is indeed a high-scoring striker 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:47.349
 with his old teammates from fc groningen sustained anyway 

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:50.889
 always in its own debt in the Netherlands is indeed recovered 

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:56.029
 thus a substitute became two substitutions in the game 

00:03:57.039 --> 00:04:00.339
 the rest becomes the plus that tweeted 

00:04:00.339 --> 00:04:03.679
 market is set for the animals to say 

00:04:03.679 --> 00:04:06.679
 I've ever had better 

00:04:07.369 --> 00:04:10.369
 currently here in the Netherlands 

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:14.509
 he didn't scare 

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:29.179
 their own club and to thank the fans for the work of up to 16 years and 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:35.600
 yes have nice time when it stretches the city is a beautiful city and the 

00:04:35.599 --> 00:04:37.849
 club is saying nicest yes 

00:04:37.849 --> 00:04:40.189
 the fans from oath 

00:04:40.189 --> 00:04:45.049
 de gucht cnn that his phone is no longer at stake 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:50.300
 is there in time still the bee they play yes I think 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:51.320
 string 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:54.370
 I also want to annoy human rights
