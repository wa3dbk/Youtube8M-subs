more<00:03:41.770> easy<00:03:41.920> things<00:03:42.670> that<00:03:42.820> I<00:03:42.910> like<00:03:43.090> about<00:03:43.210> it

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
more easy things that I like about it

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.450 
more easy things that I like about it
the<00:03:43.510> most<00:03:43.600> there<00:03:43.990> are<00:03:44.110> two<00:03:44.260> things<00:03:44.500> is<00:03:44.950> that<00:03:45.250> we

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:45.460 
the most there are two things is that we

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:47.760 
the most there are two things is that we
have<00:03:45.640> a<00:03:45.670> cove<00:03:46.060> here<00:03:46.390> where<00:03:46.690> wind<00:03:46.930> tries<00:03:47.620> to

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:47.770 
have a cove here where wind tries to

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:50.280 
have a cove here where wind tries to
blow<00:03:47.980> us<00:03:48.160> away<00:03:48.400> from<00:03:48.790> the<00:03:49.060> dock<00:03:49.300> and<00:03:49.690> it's<00:03:49.960> made

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
blow us away from the dock and it's made

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.490 
blow us away from the dock and it's made
it<00:03:50.410> much<00:03:50.440> easier<00:03:50.620> to<00:03:51.600> get<00:03:52.600> the<00:03:52.720> boat<00:03:52.960> in<00:03:53.200> the

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
it much easier to get the boat in the

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.650 
it much easier to get the boat in the
stall<00:03:53.770> and<00:03:54.160> the<00:03:54.760> second<00:03:55.090> thing<00:03:55.210> I<00:03:55.360> like<00:03:55.510> about

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:55.660 
stall and the second thing I like about

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:58.080 
stall and the second thing I like about
it<00:03:55.990> is<00:03:56.140> that<00:03:56.680> it's<00:03:56.830> made<00:03:57.010> my<00:03:57.190> wife<00:03:57.370> much<00:03:57.760> more

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
it is that it's made my wife much more

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.270 
it is that it's made my wife much more
confident<00:03:59.050> about<00:03:59.110> taking<00:03:59.500> the<00:03:59.590> boat<00:03:59.770> out<00:03:59.830> and

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
confident about taking the boat out and

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.550 
confident about taking the boat out and
so<00:04:01.030> we're<00:04:01.450> getting<00:04:01.540> a<00:04:01.750> lot<00:04:01.930> more<00:04:02.140> use<00:04:02.320> out<00:04:02.500> of

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
so we're getting a lot more use out of

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:20.550 
so we're getting a lot more use out of
the<00:04:02.710> boat<00:04:18.480> my<00:04:19.480> system<00:04:19.900> is<00:04:19.989> a<00:04:20.020> little<00:04:20.140> different

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 
the boat my system is a little different

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.410 
the boat my system is a little different
than<00:04:20.709> what<00:04:20.980> I<00:04:21.040> think<00:04:21.370> that<00:04:21.520> those<00:04:21.700> I<00:04:21.910> guys<00:04:22.150> have

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:22.420 
than what I think that those I guys have

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:25.820 
than what I think that those I guys have
done<00:04:22.600> normally<00:04:23.080> we<00:04:23.500> are<00:04:23.710> we<00:04:24.430> retrofitted<00:04:25.060> a

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
done normally we are we retrofitted a

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:29.730 
done normally we are we retrofitted a
hydraulic<00:04:26.830> lift<00:04:27.040> and<00:04:27.430> they<00:04:27.970> put<00:04:28.350> the<00:04:29.350> bullseye

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:29.740 
hydraulic lift and they put the bullseye

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.460 
hydraulic lift and they put the bullseye
system<00:04:30.190> instead<00:04:30.520> of<00:04:30.580> both<00:04:30.820> boards<00:04:31.270> on<00:04:31.750> here<00:04:32.290> as

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
system instead of both boards on here as

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:35.370 
system instead of both boards on here as
you<00:04:33.280> can<00:04:33.310> see<00:04:33.610> I<00:04:33.640> have<00:04:33.820> a<00:04:33.850> really<00:04:34.180> narrow<00:04:34.660> slip

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:35.380 
you can see I have a really narrow slip

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.470 
you can see I have a really narrow slip
I<00:04:35.680> mean<00:04:35.980> I've<00:04:36.190> got<00:04:36.400> concrete<00:04:36.910> all<00:04:37.210> the<00:04:37.360> way

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:37.480 
I mean I've got concrete all the way

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:40.380 
I mean I've got concrete all the way
around<00:04:37.810> my<00:04:37.960> boat<00:04:38.200> so<00:04:38.770> if<00:04:39.090> anything<00:04:40.090> goes<00:04:40.270> wrong

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:40.390 
around my boat so if anything goes wrong

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:42.390 
around my boat so if anything goes wrong
when<00:04:40.750> I'm<00:04:40.870> parking<00:04:41.260> it<00:04:41.380> I'm<00:04:41.770> going<00:04:42.070> to<00:04:42.130> scratch

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:42.400 
when I'm parking it I'm going to scratch

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.400 
when I'm parking it I'm going to scratch
my<00:04:42.580> boat<00:04:42.790> you<00:04:43.660> know<00:04:43.780> what<00:04:43.900> I<00:04:43.930> was<00:04:44.050> afraid<00:04:44.290> of

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:44.410 
my boat you know what I was afraid of

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:46.800 
my boat you know what I was afraid of
when<00:04:44.860> I<00:04:44.890> was<00:04:45.490> retrofitting<00:04:46.150> to<00:04:46.240> slip<00:04:46.540> as<00:04:46.720> I

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:46.810 
when I was retrofitting to slip as I

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:48.270 
when I was retrofitting to slip as I
couldn't<00:04:47.110> get<00:04:47.200> my<00:04:47.320> boat<00:04:47.530> in<00:04:47.680> now<00:04:47.830> to<00:04:47.890> here<00:04:48.100> in<00:04:48.190> a

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:48.280 
couldn't get my boat in now to here in a

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:51.870 
couldn't get my boat in now to here in a
rough<00:04:48.460> day<00:04:48.730> so<00:04:49.600> what<00:04:50.020> we<00:04:50.170> were<00:04:50.700> thinking<00:04:51.700> of<00:04:51.760> is

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:51.880 
rough day so what we were thinking of is

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:53.460 
rough day so what we were thinking of is
the<00:04:52.030> bullseye<00:04:52.360> system<00:04:52.660> actually<00:04:52.810> grabbed<00:04:53.230> my

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:53.470 
the bullseye system actually grabbed my

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:55.680 
the bullseye system actually grabbed my
boat<00:04:53.710> and<00:04:54.430> kind<00:04:54.730> of<00:04:54.820> straightens<00:04:55.270> it<00:04:55.360> out<00:04:55.510> and

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:55.690 
boat and kind of straightens it out and

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:57.900 
boat and kind of straightens it out and
puts<00:04:55.870> it<00:04:55.990> in<00:04:56.320> the<00:04:56.530> dock<00:04:56.710> it's<00:04:57.490> just<00:04:57.760> really

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:57.910 
puts it in the dock it's just really

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:00.350 
puts it in the dock it's just really
like<00:04:58.150> having<00:04:58.390> two<00:04:59.200> people<00:04:59.440> grab<00:04:59.890> your<00:05:00.100> boat
