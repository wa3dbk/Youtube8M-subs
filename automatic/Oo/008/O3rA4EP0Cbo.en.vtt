00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:12.820 
they all get back together because the

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:14.400 
they all get back together because the
Lord<00:04:13.030> could<00:04:13.180> happen<00:04:13.600> in<00:04:13.690> one<00:04:13.870> year<00:04:13.900> so<00:04:14.380> I

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:14.410 
Lord could happen in one year so I

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:16.860 
Lord could happen in one year so I
wonder<00:04:14.950> how<00:04:15.459> many<00:04:15.519> really<00:04:16.150> will<00:04:16.329> come<00:04:16.600> back

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:16.870

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.420 
now besides that shutter do we actually
see<00:04:19.150> the<00:04:20.109> reasons<00:04:20.500> why<00:04:20.650> she<00:04:20.919> could<00:04:21.039> turn<00:04:21.190> into

00:05:08.719 --> 00:05:08.729 
but he states in this chapter he hasn't

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:10.310 
but he states in this chapter he hasn't
trained<00:05:08.970> at<00:05:09.090> all<00:05:09.240> he's<00:05:09.510> only<00:05:09.539> trained<00:05:10.169> to

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:10.320 
trained at all he's only trained to

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.529 
trained at all he's only trained to
resist<00:05:10.470> fish<00:05:11.010> just<00:05:11.310> a<00:05:11.430> little<00:05:11.789> bit<00:05:11.910> more<00:05:12.150> so

00:05:12.529 --> 00:05:12.539 
resist fish just a little bit more so

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:14.330 
resist fish just a little bit more so
kind<00:05:13.139> of<00:05:13.229> disappointing<00:05:13.800> because<00:05:14.039> there

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:14.340 
kind of disappointing because there

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:15.230 
kind of disappointing because there
could<00:05:14.400> have<00:05:14.490> been<00:05:14.550> a<00:05:14.669> little<00:05:14.880> bit<00:05:15.120> more

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:15.240 
could have been a little bit more

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:16.909 
could have been a little bit more
potential<00:05:15.840> for<00:05:16.020> happy<00:05:16.380> for<00:05:16.560> instance<00:05:16.860> he

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:16.919 
potential for happy for instance he

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:18.710 
potential for happy for instance he
could<00:05:17.070> have<00:05:17.160> upgraded<00:05:17.880> his<00:05:18.090> waist<00:05:18.360> where<00:05:18.599> he

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:18.720 
could have upgraded his waist where he

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:20.480 
could have upgraded his waist where he
could<00:05:18.840> fly<00:05:18.960> it<00:05:19.080> greater<00:05:19.410> distances<00:05:19.949> maybe<00:05:20.190> fly

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:20.490 
could fly it greater distances maybe fly

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:22.310 
could fly it greater distances maybe fly
faster<00:05:21.120> I<00:05:21.150> mean<00:05:21.419> there<00:05:21.990> could<00:05:22.110> have<00:05:22.169> been<00:05:22.229> a

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:22.320 
faster I mean there could have been a

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:24.290 
faster I mean there could have been a
lot<00:05:22.470> more<00:05:22.530> stuff<00:05:22.919> there<00:05:23.130> but<00:05:23.280> I<00:05:23.340> mean<00:05:23.460> I<00:05:23.580> didn't

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:24.300 
lot more stuff there but I mean I didn't

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:25.850 
lot more stuff there but I mean I didn't
expect<00:05:24.599> much<00:05:24.750> with<00:05:24.990> happy<00:05:25.229> at<00:05:25.320> all<00:05:25.410> i<00:05:25.470> really
