that<00:06:22.130> in<00:06:22.340> the<00:06:22.370> rain<00:06:22.700> boosted<00:06:23.450> this<00:06:23.630> probably

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:24.020 
that in the rain boosted this probably

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:25.930

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:29.900 
but still that's pretty dang good to

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:35.970 
but still that's pretty dang good to
