so<00:00:50.399> let<00:00:50.489> me<00:00:50.579> show<00:00:50.670> you<00:00:50.730> how<00:00:50.850> to<00:00:50.910> put<00:00:51.059> them<00:00:51.120> on

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
so let me show you how to put them on

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.170 
so let me show you how to put them on
real<00:00:51.420> quick<00:00:51.660> it's<00:00:52.440> easier<00:00:52.739> to<00:00:52.829> wrap<00:00:53.640> them<00:00:53.910> with

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
real quick it's easier to wrap them with

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.380 
real quick it's easier to wrap them with
your<00:00:54.510> bare<00:00:54.750> skin<00:00:55.070> instead<00:00:56.070> of<00:00:56.300> over<00:00:57.300> your

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
your bare skin instead of over your

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.209 
your bare skin instead of over your
pants<00:00:57.690> because<00:00:57.930> you<00:00:58.260> get<00:00:58.500> a<00:00:58.530> better<00:00:58.739> grip<00:00:59.010> out

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
pants because you get a better grip out

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.410 
pants because you get a better grip out
of<00:00:59.340> them<00:01:00.530> and<00:01:01.530> wait<00:01:02.250> what<00:01:02.820> you<00:01:02.910> do<00:01:03.059> you<00:01:03.239> got<00:01:03.390> to

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
of them and wait what you do you got to

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.100 
of them and wait what you do you got to
roll<00:01:03.660> it<00:01:03.840> up<00:01:04.549> and<00:01:05.549> I<00:01:06.299> like<00:01:06.510> to<00:01:06.600> start<00:01:06.869> from<00:01:06.990> the

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
roll it up and I like to start from the

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.060 
roll it up and I like to start from the
top<00:01:07.320> and<00:01:08.270> then<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.810> first<00:01:10.020> one<00:01:10.140> I<00:01:10.590> wrap<00:01:10.920> it

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
top and then the first one I wrap it

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.140 
top and then the first one I wrap it
around<00:01:11.189> and<00:01:11.610> make<00:01:12.600> sure<00:01:13.850> make<00:01:14.850> sure<00:01:14.880> it

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
around and make sure make sure it

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.649 
around and make sure make sure it
doesn't<00:01:15.299> slip<00:01:15.570> out<00:01:15.750> and<00:01:16.280> I<00:01:17.280> keep<00:01:17.909> my<00:01:18.090> legs<00:01:18.479> a

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
doesn't slip out and I keep my legs a

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.310 
doesn't slip out and I keep my legs a
little<00:01:18.750> bit<00:01:19.200> slightly<00:01:20.009> bent<00:01:20.400> and<00:01:21.020> then<00:01:22.020> I

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
little bit slightly bent and then I

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.789 
little bit slightly bent and then I
overlap<00:01:22.890> it<00:01:23.070> about<00:01:23.310> halfway<00:01:23.700> around<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.799> band

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
overlap it about halfway around the band

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:32.370 
overlap it about halfway around the band
here<00:01:27.020> and<00:01:28.020> I<00:01:28.590> keep<00:01:28.740> going

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.249 

and<00:01:33.380> right<00:01:34.070> when<00:01:34.189> it<00:01:34.280> is<00:01:34.369> about<00:01:34.520> this<00:01:34.720> and<00:01:35.720> I'll

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:36.259 
and right when it is about this and I'll

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:40.179 
and right when it is about this and I'll
just<00:01:36.409> tuck<00:01:36.799> it<00:01:36.920> in<00:01:37.070> and<00:01:38.740> you<00:01:39.740> want<00:01:39.890> to<00:01:39.950> tuck<00:01:40.070> it

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:40.189 
just tuck it in and you want to tuck it

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:42.670 
just tuck it in and you want to tuck it
in<00:01:40.310> good<00:01:40.490> because<00:01:40.930> if<00:01:41.930> you<00:01:42.170> don't<00:01:42.259> have<00:01:42.439> it<00:01:42.530> in

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:42.680 
in good because if you don't have it in

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.529 
in good because if you don't have it in
tight<00:01:43.280> and<00:01:43.399> you<00:01:43.520> go<00:01:43.610> down<00:01:43.820> on<00:01:43.850> a<00:01:44.090> squat<00:01:44.360> it's

00:01:44.529 --> 00:01:44.539 
tight and you go down on a squat it's

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:47.080 
tight and you go down on a squat it's
going<00:01:44.659> to<00:01:44.720> pop<00:01:44.899> off<00:01:45.110> I<00:01:45.640> see<00:01:46.640> a<00:01:46.670> lot<00:01:46.850> of<00:01:46.880> people

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
going to pop off I see a lot of people

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:48.899 
going to pop off I see a lot of people
doing<00:01:47.240> this<00:01:47.450> if<00:01:47.689> they<00:01:47.899> don't<00:01:47.930> roll<00:01:48.320> it<00:01:48.470> up

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:48.909 
doing this if they don't roll it up

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:51.130 
doing this if they don't roll it up
you're<00:01:49.909> not<00:01:50.000> going<00:01:50.179> to<00:01:50.240> get<00:01:50.360> it<00:01:50.509> in<00:01:50.689> it's<00:01:50.869> tight

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
you're not going to get it in it's tight

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.130 
you're not going to get it in it's tight
and<00:01:51.439> you<00:01:51.799> have<00:01:51.950> it<00:01:52.490> takes<00:01:52.700> a<00:01:52.820> lot<00:01:53.360> it<00:01:53.659> takes<00:01:54.049> a

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
and you have it takes a lot it takes a

00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:01.420 
and you have it takes a lot it takes a
longer<00:01:54.320> time<00:01:54.649> to<00:01:54.880> put<00:01:55.880> them<00:01:56.030> on

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:01.430 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:06.250 

so<00:02:02.000> the<00:02:02.660> trick<00:02:02.900> is<00:02:02.930> to<00:02:03.080> roll<00:02:03.410> them<00:02:03.590> up<00:02:05.260> alright

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:06.260 
so the trick is to roll them up alright

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:07.660 
so the trick is to roll them up alright
I'm<00:02:06.350> going<00:02:06.500> to<00:02:06.530> show<00:02:06.650> you<00:02:06.710> again<00:02:07.040> Angela<00:02:07.430> keys

I'm going to show you again Angela keys
gasp<00:02:07.970> bones

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:47.540 

and<00:02:43.170> I<00:02:43.230> like<00:02:43.470> to<00:02:43.590> get<00:02:43.710> this<00:02:43.980> pretty<00:02:44.700> snug<00:02:46.550> you

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
and I like to get this pretty snug you

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:51.110 
and I like to get this pretty snug you
don't<00:02:47.700> want<00:02:47.850> to<00:02:47.940> over-tighten<00:02:48.240> them<00:02:50.120> because

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
don't want to over-tighten them because

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:57.200 
don't want to over-tighten them because
you<00:02:51.240> can't<00:02:51.450> go<00:02:51.600> as<00:02:51.780> deep<00:02:55.520> but<00:02:56.520> on<00:02:56.760> the<00:02:56.880> really

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:57.210 
you can't go as deep but on the really

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:01.400 
you can't go as deep but on the really
heavy<00:02:57.450> sets<00:02:59.240> I'll<00:03:00.240> tie<00:03:00.510> them<00:03:00.780> up<00:03:00.870> pretty<00:03:01.230> good

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
heavy sets I'll tie them up pretty good

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:02.630 
heavy sets I'll tie them up pretty good
because<00:03:01.650> I<00:03:01.830> know<00:03:01.890> I'm<00:03:02.100> not<00:03:02.190> going<00:03:02.310> to<00:03:02.370> go<00:03:02.490> as

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
because I know I'm not going to go as

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.780 
because I know I'm not going to go as
deep<00:03:02.670> on<00:03:03.060> weights<00:03:03.450> I<00:03:03.570> usually<00:03:03.930> haven't<00:03:04.320> tried

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
deep on weights I usually haven't tried

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:09.950 
deep on weights I usually haven't tried
so<00:03:05.790> there<00:03:06.720> you<00:03:06.840> go<00:03:06.900> try<00:03:07.680> it<00:03:07.710> out<00:03:07.890> and<00:03:08.930> you'll<00:03:09.930> be

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:09.960 
so there you go try it out and you'll be

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:13.040 
so there you go try it out and you'll be
able<00:03:10.110> to<00:03:10.230> push<00:03:10.350> a<00:03:10.440> little<00:03:10.530> bit<00:03:10.680> more<00:03:10.740> weight
