over here in this corner I'm gonna put a
tube<00:03:10.910> and<00:03:11.690> I'm<00:03:12.500> gonna<00:03:12.680> run<00:03:13.510> that's<00:03:14.510> another

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
tube and I'm gonna run that's another

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.790 
tube and I'm gonna run that's another
piece<00:03:15.170> of<00:03:15.230> pipe<00:03:15.620> and<00:03:16.030> strap<00:03:17.030> it<00:03:17.239> to<00:03:17.269> each<00:03:17.540> one

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:17.800 
piece of pipe and strap it to each one

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.680 
piece of pipe and strap it to each one
but<00:03:18.800> it's<00:03:19.100> gonna<00:03:19.340> run<00:03:19.580> all<00:03:19.880> the<00:03:20.180> way<00:03:20.330> to<00:03:20.390> this

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
but it's gonna run all the way to this

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:24.550 
but it's gonna run all the way to this
other<00:03:20.959> corner<00:03:21.320> and<00:03:22.060> I'm<00:03:23.060> gonna<00:03:23.239> put<00:03:23.390> a<00:03:23.560> tee

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
other corner and I'm gonna put a tee

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.050 
other corner and I'm gonna put a tee
right<00:03:24.830> there<00:03:25.100> and<00:03:25.220> then<00:03:25.370> hook<00:03:25.580> it<00:03:25.760> up<00:03:25.910> to<00:03:26.030> that

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060 
right there and then hook it up to that

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:27.940 
right there and then hook it up to that
pipe<00:03:26.420> that<00:03:26.660> it's<00:03:26.780> running<00:03:27.050> off<00:03:27.140> way<00:03:27.650> across

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950 
pipe that it's running off way across

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:31.660 
pipe that it's running off way across
and<00:03:28.220> what's<00:03:28.370> that's<00:03:28.610> going<00:03:28.880> to<00:03:28.970> be<00:03:29.150> for<00:03:29.480> it<00:03:30.670> so

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:31.670 
and what's that's going to be for it so

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:33.430 
and what's that's going to be for it so
if<00:03:31.910> that<00:03:32.180> wall<00:03:32.570> over<00:03:32.840> there<00:03:33.080> I'll<00:03:33.230> move<00:03:33.410> back

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440 
if that wall over there I'll move back

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.240 
if that wall over there I'll move back
and<00:03:33.980> forth<00:03:34.220> and<00:03:34.550> I<00:03:35.390> don't<00:03:35.450> like<00:03:35.810> that<00:03:36.190> so<00:03:37.190> you

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 
and forth and I don't like that so you

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.420 
and forth and I don't like that so you
can<00:03:37.489> see<00:03:37.670> how<00:03:37.850> it's<00:03:38.090> kind<00:03:38.360> of<00:03:38.420> got<00:03:38.690> the<00:03:38.810> plastic

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
can see how it's kind of got the plastic

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:43.479 
can see how it's kind of got the plastic
slack<00:03:40.430> so<00:03:40.850> once<00:03:41.630> I<00:03:41.810> put<00:03:42.049> that<00:03:42.260> pipe<00:03:43.190> running

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:43.489 
slack so once I put that pipe running

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:46.180 
slack so once I put that pipe running
all<00:03:43.700> across<00:03:43.790> and<00:03:44.150> tie<00:03:44.330> it<00:03:44.390> to<00:03:44.540> each<00:03:44.870> each<00:03:45.709> run

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:46.190 
all across and tie it to each each run

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:48.729 
all across and tie it to each each run
you'll<00:03:47.150> reinforce<00:03:47.540> it<00:03:48.110> and<00:03:48.320> it<00:03:48.410> won't<00:03:48.530> be

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:48.739 
you'll reinforce it and it won't be

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:51.670 
you'll reinforce it and it won't be
moving<00:03:49.010> there<00:03:49.450> so<00:03:50.450> and<00:03:51.049> I'll<00:03:51.200> keep<00:03:51.440> the

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 
moving there so and I'll keep the

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.490 
moving there so and I'll keep the
tightness<00:03:52.160> to<00:03:52.549> the<00:03:52.670> plastic<00:03:53.239> so<00:03:53.989> but<00:03:54.290> that's

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:54.500 
tightness to the plastic so but that's

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:58.500 
tightness to the plastic so but that's
the<00:03:54.650> only<00:03:54.739> thing<00:03:54.890> that<00:03:55.370> I<00:03:55.400> have<00:03:55.670> found

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:02.710 

but<00:03:59.510> anyway<00:04:00.310> make<00:04:01.310> sure<00:04:01.340> you<00:04:01.910> tie<00:04:02.180> this<00:04:02.239> thing

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.720 
but anyway make sure you tie this thing

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:09.210 
but anyway make sure you tie this thing
down<00:04:03.220> to<00:04:04.220> the<00:04:04.250> ground<00:04:05.019> either<00:04:06.610> down<00:04:08.049> around

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:12.200 
the bottom drives the stakes down about

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:16.270 
the bottom drives the stakes down about
two<00:04:13.040> foot<00:04:13.310> down<00:04:13.459> to<00:04:13.519> the<00:04:13.670> ground<00:04:14.030> and

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:30.870 
down cuz it will close because I had it

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:33.800 
down cuz it will close because I had it
we<00:04:31.620> had<00:04:31.800> some<00:04:32.130> a<00:04:32.400> storm<00:04:32.820> coming<00:04:33.270> in<00:04:33.360> here<00:04:33.630> while

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:33.810 
we had some a storm coming in here while

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:36.920 
we had some a storm coming in here while

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:36.930 
back and I like to lost my greenhouse

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:39.920 
back and I like to lost my greenhouse
but<00:04:37.800> you<00:04:37.950> can<00:04:38.130> see<00:04:38.370> where<00:04:38.610> the<00:04:38.730> water<00:04:39.330> feels<00:04:39.660> up

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
but you can see where the water feels up

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:42.680 
but you can see where the water feels up
right<00:04:40.200> there<00:04:40.440> after<00:04:40.820> pulled<00:04:41.820> it<00:04:42.030> completely

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690 
right there after pulled it completely

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:47.270 
right there after pulled it completely
off<00:04:42.960> the<00:04:43.230> side<00:04:44.010> of<00:04:44.220> the<00:04:44.340> house<00:04:44.750> so<00:04:45.750> I<00:04:46.130> got<00:04:47.130> all

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.280 
off the side of the house so I got all

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.190 
off the side of the house so I got all
that<00:04:47.460> fix<00:04:47.850> you<00:04:48.210> think<00:04:48.479> it's<00:04:48.630> going<00:04:48.900> to<00:04:48.960> have<00:04:49.050> to

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:49.200 
that fix you think it's going to have to

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.770 
that fix you think it's going to have to
do<00:04:49.889> some<00:04:50.130> serious<00:04:50.340> blowing<00:04:51.060> to<00:04:51.180> pull<00:04:51.419> it<00:04:51.570> away

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:51.780 
do some serious blowing to pull it away

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:54.800 
do some serious blowing to pull it away
now<00:04:52.020> so<00:04:52.470> but<00:04:53.340> anyway<00:04:53.760> I've<00:04:54.030> got<00:04:54.240> it<00:04:54.330> fastened

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:54.810 
now so but anyway I've got it fastened

00:04:54.810 --> 00:05:00.350 
now so but anyway I've got it fastened
around<00:04:54.900> but<00:04:55.320> that<00:04:56.330> is<00:04:57.650> my<00:04:58.650> update<00:04:59.240> for<00:05:00.240> my

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:00.360 
around but that is my update for my

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:05.320 
around but that is my update for my
greenhouse<00:05:01.070> which<00:05:02.070> I<00:05:02.400> am<00:05:02.639> going<00:05:03.090> to<00:05:03.590> build<00:05:04.590> a

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:05.330 
greenhouse which I am going to build a

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:10.219 
greenhouse which I am going to build a
window<00:05:06.330> in<00:05:07.160> this<00:05:08.160> area<00:05:08.580> here<00:05:09.060> and<00:05:09.210> build<00:05:10.080> a

00:05:10.219 --> 00:05:10.229 
window in this area here and build a

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:12.950 
window in this area here and build a
window<00:05:10.830> over<00:05:11.160> there<00:05:11.340> that<00:05:11.639> I<00:05:12.090> can<00:05:12.840> either

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:12.960 
window over there that I can either

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:18.710 
window over there that I can either
remove<00:05:13.500> or<00:05:14.010> I<00:05:14.100> can<00:05:14.400> open<00:05:15.650> so<00:05:16.850> that's<00:05:17.850> that<00:05:18.510> will

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:18.720 
remove or I can open so that's that will

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:20.270 
remove or I can open so that's that will
be<00:05:18.840> in<00:05:19.020> the<00:05:19.169> future<00:05:19.620> I<00:05:19.650> don't<00:05:19.800> know<00:05:19.919> how<00:05:20.100> long

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:20.280 
be in the future I don't know how long

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:22.310 
be in the future I don't know how long
it<00:05:20.520> would<00:05:20.640> be<00:05:20.850> because<00:05:21.570> I<00:05:21.720> really<00:05:21.990> don't<00:05:22.110> need

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:22.320 
it would be because I really don't need

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:27.050 
it would be because I really don't need
a<00:05:22.669> window<00:05:23.669> right<00:05:23.910> now<00:05:24.150> to<00:05:24.210> it<00:05:24.630> so<00:05:25.190> anyway<00:05:26.190> but

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:27.060 
a window right now to it so anyway but

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:30.469 
a window right now to it so anyway but
you<00:05:27.240> can<00:05:27.450> see<00:05:27.660> it's<00:05:27.960> running<00:05:28.940> 30<00:05:29.940> and<00:05:30.180> 40

00:05:30.469 --> 00:05:30.479 
you can see it's running 30 and 40
