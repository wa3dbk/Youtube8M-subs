were very popular on the web several

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:32.750 
were very popular on the web several
years<00:00:30.279> ago<00:00:30.519> and<00:00:30.699> I<00:00:30.820> film<00:00:31.090> and<00:00:31.300> whatnot<00:00:31.710> so<00:00:32.710> I

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:32.760 
years ago and I film and whatnot so I

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:37.260 
years ago and I film and whatnot so I
decided<00:00:33.760> to<00:00:34.200> pick<00:00:35.200> up<00:00:35.350> his<00:00:35.530> DVD<00:00:36.430> the<00:00:36.879> second<00:00:37.210> in

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:37.270 
decided to pick up his DVD the second in

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:39.240 
decided to pick up his DVD the second in
the<00:00:37.390> series<00:00:37.540> I<00:00:37.899> skipped<00:00:38.559> over<00:00:38.620> the<00:00:38.829> first<00:00:38.860> in

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:39.250 
the series I skipped over the first in

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:41.369 
the series I skipped over the first in
the<00:00:39.340> series<00:00:39.489> because<00:00:39.879> that<00:00:40.420> one<00:00:40.629> seems<00:00:41.079> to<00:00:41.260> be

00:00:41.369 --> 00:00:41.379 
the series because that one seems to be

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:43.740 
the series because that one seems to be
more<00:00:41.559> about<00:00:41.770> rigging<00:00:42.219> and<00:00:42.550> rigging<00:00:43.300> is<00:00:43.450> much

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:43.750 
more about rigging and rigging is much

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:48.569 
more about rigging and rigging is much
more<00:00:45.210> software<00:00:46.210> dependent<00:00:46.809> and<00:00:47.020> I<00:00:47.949> didn't

00:00:48.569 --> 00:00:48.579 
more software dependent and I didn't

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:50.100 
more software dependent and I didn't
think<00:00:48.670> I<00:00:48.789> would<00:00:48.850> get<00:00:49.059> that<00:00:49.239> much<00:00:49.510> out<00:00:49.780> of<00:00:49.989> it

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:50.110 
think I would get that much out of it

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:52.170 
think I would get that much out of it
but<00:00:51.039> maybe<00:00:51.520> I'll<00:00:51.699> get<00:00:51.850> that<00:00:51.940> one<00:00:52.059> in<00:00:52.090> the

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:52.180 
but maybe I'll get that one in the

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.439 
but maybe I'll get that one in the
future

00:00:52.439 --> 00:00:52.449 
future

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:54.299 
future
I<00:00:52.600> have<00:00:53.170> the<00:00:53.410> second<00:00:53.800> and<00:00:53.890> third<00:00:54.039> in<00:00:54.190> the

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:54.309 
I have the second and third in the

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:56.520 
I have the second and third in the
volume<00:00:54.640> volumes<00:00:55.390> in<00:00:55.539> the<00:00:55.570> series<00:00:55.629> and<00:00:56.079> I'll<00:00:56.410> be

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:56.530 
volume volumes in the series and I'll be

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:58.740 
volume volumes in the series and I'll be
reviewing<00:00:57.010> the<00:00:57.100> the<00:00:57.340> third<00:00:57.550> volume<00:00:57.820> later<00:00:58.539> on

00:00:58.740 --> 00:00:58.750 
reviewing the the third volume later on

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:03.119 
reviewing the the third volume later on
so<00:00:59.559> as<00:00:59.829> for<00:01:00.300> part<00:01:01.300> 2<00:01:01.510> which<00:01:01.989> basically<00:01:02.620> deals

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:03.129 
so as for part 2 which basically deals

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:06.000 
so as for part 2 which basically deals
with<00:01:03.219> the<00:01:03.910> principles<00:01:04.750> of<00:01:05.010> character

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:06.010 
with the principles of character

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:09.540 
with the principles of character
animation<00:01:06.550> I<00:01:06.700> found<00:01:07.660> this<00:01:07.750> DVD<00:01:08.110> to<00:01:08.410> be<00:01:08.590> an

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:09.550 
animation I found this DVD to be an

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:11.340 
animation I found this DVD to be an
excellent<00:01:10.000> product<00:01:10.210> and<00:01:10.540> if<00:01:11.050> you're<00:01:11.260> a

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:11.350 
excellent product and if you're a

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.050 
excellent product and if you're a
beginner<00:01:11.770> starting<00:01:12.580> out<00:01:12.700> in<00:01:12.790> character

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.060 
beginner starting out in character

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.540 
beginner starting out in character
animation<00:01:13.210> maybe<00:01:14.110> you're<00:01:14.920> looking<00:01:15.040> at<00:01:15.280> your

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:15.550 
animation maybe you're looking at your

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:18.180 
animation maybe you're looking at your
animation<00:01:16.060> and<00:01:16.300> it<00:01:16.450> looks<00:01:16.660> a<00:01:16.750> bit<00:01:16.780> flat<00:01:17.140> a<00:01:17.470> bit

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:18.190 
animation and it looks a bit flat a bit

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:20.820 
animation and it looks a bit flat a bit
lifeless<00:01:18.370> and<00:01:18.790> you<00:01:19.510> don't<00:01:19.690> know<00:01:19.780> why<00:01:19.960> then

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:20.830 
lifeless and you don't know why then

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.190 
lifeless and you don't know why then
this<00:01:21.160> is<00:01:21.310> an<00:01:21.430> excellent<00:01:21.850> place<00:01:22.000> of<00:01:22.150> stars<00:01:22.360> so

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200 
this is an excellent place of stars so

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.570 
this is an excellent place of stars so
for<00:01:23.350> example<00:01:23.650> if<00:01:23.710> you<00:01:23.800> look<00:01:23.890> at<00:01:24.040> the<00:01:24.100> chapters

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:24.580 
for example if you look at the chapters

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.170 
for example if you look at the chapters
of<00:01:24.760> the<00:01:24.850> DVD<00:01:25.240> it<00:01:25.630> goes<00:01:25.900> into<00:01:26.230> some<00:01:26.860> of<00:01:26.980> the

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
of the DVD it goes into some of the

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.340 
of the DVD it goes into some of the
principles<00:01:28.180> of<00:01:28.330> character<00:01:28.720> animations<00:01:29.140> such

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:29.350 
principles of character animations such

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.210 
principles of character animations such
as<00:01:29.530> arcs<00:01:30.280> anticipation<00:01:31.410> moving<00:01:32.410> hold<00:01:32.650> squash

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:33.220 
as arcs anticipation moving hold squash

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.360 
as arcs anticipation moving hold squash
and<00:01:33.490> squash<00:01:33.970> and<00:01:34.150> stretch<00:01:35.370> exaggeration

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:36.370 
and squash and stretch exaggeration

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:38.160 
and squash and stretch exaggeration
weight<00:01:36.550> stuff<00:01:37.030> like<00:01:37.180> that<00:01:37.360> follow-through

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
weight stuff like that follow-through

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.410 
weight stuff like that follow-through
these<00:01:38.590> are<00:01:38.800> principles<00:01:39.400> that<00:01:39.760> have<00:01:40.390> been

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:40.420 
these are principles that have been

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.300 
these are principles that have been
outlined<00:01:40.810> by<00:01:41.050> the<00:01:41.110> Disney<00:01:41.410> animators<00:01:41.980> years

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.310 
outlined by the Disney animators years

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.970 
outlined by the Disney animators years
ago<00:01:42.580> every<00:01:43.480> character<00:01:43.990> animation<00:01:44.440> book<00:01:44.740> or

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:44.980 
ago every character animation book or

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:48.000 
ago every character animation book or
DVD<00:01:45.580> training<00:01:46.330> software<00:01:46.660> will<00:01:47.290> tell<00:01:47.890> you

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:48.010 
DVD training software will tell you

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:49.410 
DVD training software will tell you
these<00:01:48.190> are<00:01:48.250> important<00:01:48.790> but<00:01:48.970> they<00:01:49.240> just

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
these are important but they just

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:50.940 
these are important but they just
basically<00:01:49.630> tell<00:01:50.050> you<00:01:50.140> the<00:01:50.260> theory<00:01:50.530> behind<00:01:50.680> it

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 
basically tell you the theory behind it

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.520 
basically tell you the theory behind it
and<00:01:51.460> what<00:01:52.030> I<00:01:52.090> liked<00:01:52.330> about<00:01:52.390> this<00:01:52.660> DVD<00:01:52.870> is<00:01:53.260> that

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
and what I liked about this DVD is that

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.730 
and what I liked about this DVD is that
he<00:01:53.650> actually<00:01:53.800> shows<00:01:54.220> you<00:01:54.490> an<00:01:54.700> actual

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
he actually shows you an actual

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.500 
he actually shows you an actual
animation<00:01:56.740> and<00:01:57.190> and<00:01:57.460> how<00:01:57.670> it<00:01:57.910> these

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:58.510 
animation and and how it these

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:00.390 
animation and and how it these
principles<00:01:59.050> are<00:01:59.140> used<00:01:59.410> in<00:01:59.650> the<00:01:59.770> animation<00:02:00.250> and

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:00.400 
principles are used in the animation and

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.660 
principles are used in the animation and
he<00:02:00.490> actually<00:02:00.820> shows<00:02:01.060> you<00:02:01.300> how<00:02:02.110> to<00:02:02.170> actually<00:02:02.670> do

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670 
he actually shows you how to actually do

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
in in an actual practical environment

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.760 
in in an actual practical environment
and<00:02:12.820> he<00:02:13.390> shows

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
and he shows

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:17.910 
and he shows
little<00:02:15.190> bits<00:02:15.370> of<00:02:15.430> animation<00:02:15.970> basically<00:02:16.920> how

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
little bits of animation basically how

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.220 
little bits of animation basically how
these<00:02:18.100> would<00:02:18.280> be<00:02:18.430> used<00:02:19.030> for<00:02:19.210> example<00:02:19.660> when<00:02:20.200> a

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
these would be used for example when a

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.790 
these would be used for example when a
character<00:02:20.500> is<00:02:20.650> punching<00:02:21.040> another<00:02:21.130> character

things like that things that are very

things like that things that are very
practical<00:02:36.010> that<00:02:36.220> you're<00:02:36.520> going<00:02:36.730> to<00:02:36.790> have<00:02:36.970> your

characters<00:02:37.570> doing<00:02:37.810> in<00:02:38.230> your<00:02:38.620> animations<00:02:39.190> so

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
characters doing in your animations so

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.650 
characters doing in your animations so
in<00:02:40.660> that<00:02:41.050> aspect<00:02:41.230> I<00:02:41.560> would<00:02:41.740> say<00:02:41.920> this<00:02:42.130> DVD<00:02:42.910> is<00:02:43.030> a

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
in that aspect I would say this DVD is a

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.860 
in that aspect I would say this DVD is a
great<00:02:44.260> purchase<00:02:45.000> it's<00:02:46.000> only<00:02:46.210> I<00:02:46.330> think<00:02:46.600> twenty

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
great purchase it's only I think twenty

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:50.190 
great purchase it's only I think twenty
dollars<00:02:47.280> it's<00:02:48.280> about<00:02:48.430> an<00:02:48.670> hour<00:02:48.880> and<00:02:49.030> a<00:02:49.510> half<00:02:49.690> it

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
dollars it's about an hour and a half it

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.600 
dollars it's about an hour and a half it
says<00:02:50.410> one<00:02:50.680> hour<00:02:50.860> and<00:02:51.040> twenty<00:02:51.280> two<00:02:51.370> minute

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
says one hour and twenty two minute

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:54.510 
says one hour and twenty two minute
runtime<00:02:51.880> on<00:02:52.060> his<00:02:52.330> website<00:02:52.720> so<00:02:53.500> that's<00:02:54.070> quite

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:54.520 
runtime on his website so that's quite

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.180 
runtime on his website so that's quite
reasonable<00:02:54.670> considering<00:02:55.540> that<00:02:55.630> most

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
reasonable considering that most

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.510 
reasonable considering that most
tutorial<00:02:57.750> dvds<00:02:58.750> are<00:02:59.110> quite<00:02:59.830> expensive<00:03:00.010> some

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:00.520 
tutorial dvds are quite expensive some

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.610 
tutorial dvds are quite expensive some
of<00:03:00.640> them<00:03:00.730> are<00:03:00.940> forty<00:03:01.450> to<00:03:01.600> sixty<00:03:01.780> seventy

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
of them are forty to sixty seventy

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.920 
of them are forty to sixty seventy
eighty<00:03:02.680> dollars<00:03:03.160> even<00:03:03.310> so<00:03:04.120> that's<00:03:04.660> quite

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
eighty dollars even so that's quite

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.830 
eighty dollars even so that's quite
reasonable<00:03:05.080> especially<00:03:05.650> what<00:03:05.980> you<00:03:06.100> get<00:03:06.840> any

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
reasonable especially what you get any

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.120 
reasonable especially what you get any
kind<00:03:08.050> of<00:03:08.140> negatives<00:03:08.530> I<00:03:08.650> would<00:03:08.770> have<00:03:08.890> to<00:03:08.980> say

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.130 
kind of negatives I would have to say

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:11.640 
kind of negatives I would have to say
the<00:03:09.280> only<00:03:09.520> thing<00:03:09.670> maybe<00:03:10.510> is<00:03:10.870> the<00:03:11.260> section<00:03:11.560> on

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
the only thing maybe is the section on

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.460 
the only thing maybe is the section on
character<00:03:11.980> design<00:03:12.870> he<00:03:13.870> does<00:03:14.020> a<00:03:14.050> section<00:03:14.410> on

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
character design he does a section on

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:17.730 
character design he does a section on
character<00:03:14.800> design<00:03:15.400> which<00:03:15.640> is<00:03:15.850> I<00:03:16.660> didn't<00:03:17.470> find

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:17.740 
character design which is I didn't find

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:20.160 
character design which is I didn't find
very<00:03:17.860> useful<00:03:18.010> myself<00:03:18.670> now<00:03:18.910> if<00:03:19.300> you<00:03:19.510> don't<00:03:19.840> know

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170 
very useful myself now if you don't know

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:21.479 
very useful myself now if you don't know
what<00:03:20.410> types<00:03:20.650> of<00:03:20.800> characters<00:03:21.130> you<00:03:21.220> want<00:03:21.370> to

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:21.489 
what types of characters you want to

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:23.720 
what types of characters you want to
make<00:03:21.730> or<00:03:21.970> how<00:03:22.300> to<00:03:22.360> design<00:03:22.810> a<00:03:22.870> character<00:03:23.290> at<00:03:23.380> all

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
make or how to design a character at all

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.520 
make or how to design a character at all
it<00:03:24.730> might<00:03:24.910> be<00:03:25.060> useful<00:03:25.420> I<00:03:25.600> already<00:03:26.110> have<00:03:26.290> a<00:03:26.320> lot

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
it might be useful I already have a lot

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:29.610 
it might be useful I already have a lot
of<00:03:26.650> characters<00:03:27.040> built<00:03:27.989> and/or<00:03:28.989> have<00:03:29.290> designs

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
of characters built and/or have designs

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.979 
of characters built and/or have designs
for<00:03:29.860> them<00:03:30.070> so<00:03:30.370> I<00:03:30.580> didn't<00:03:31.510> get<00:03:31.570> much<00:03:31.750> out<00:03:31.900> of

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
for them so I didn't get much out of

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:34.410 
for them so I didn't get much out of
this<00:03:32.110> section<00:03:32.320> I<00:03:32.590> kind<00:03:33.250> of<00:03:33.280> basically<00:03:33.640> looked

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 
this section I kind of basically looked

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:35.940 
this section I kind of basically looked
at<00:03:34.540> it<00:03:34.630> once<00:03:34.810> and<00:03:34.959> kind<00:03:35.170> of<00:03:35.230> skipped<00:03:35.590> over<00:03:35.709> it

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
at it once and kind of skipped over it

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.190 
at it once and kind of skipped over it
also<00:03:36.340> the<00:03:36.700> section<00:03:36.940> on<00:03:37.150> rotoscoping<00:03:37.810> even

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 
also the section on rotoscoping even

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:39.840 
also the section on rotoscoping even
though<00:03:38.350> some<00:03:39.010> of<00:03:39.130> you<00:03:39.190> out<00:03:39.250> there<00:03:39.340> might<00:03:39.610> end

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:39.850 
though some of you out there might end

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:43.500 
though some of you out there might end
up<00:03:39.970> using<00:03:40.920> video<00:03:41.920> as<00:03:42.790> a<00:03:42.850> template<00:03:43.450> for

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510 
up using video as a template for

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:45.270 
up using video as a template for
animation<00:03:44.140> in<00:03:44.200> the<00:03:44.260> background<00:03:44.650> he'll<00:03:45.070> show

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
animation in the background he'll show

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.310 
animation in the background he'll show
you<00:03:45.340> how<00:03:45.519> to<00:03:45.580> do<00:03:45.760> that<00:03:45.940> how<00:03:46.180> to<00:03:46.209> put<00:03:46.630> video<00:03:46.989> into

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:47.320 
you how to do that how to put video into

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.410 
you how to do that how to put video into
the<00:03:47.350> background<00:03:48.190> of<00:03:48.340> your<00:03:48.549> animated<00:03:49.209> scene

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.420 
the background of your animated scene

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.630 
the background of your animated scene
and<00:03:49.660> then<00:03:50.290> have<00:03:50.440> you<00:03:50.530> animate<00:03:50.950> over<00:03:51.250> top<00:03:51.459> of

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:51.640 
and then have you animate over top of

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.539 
and then have you animate over top of
that<00:03:51.790> but<00:03:52.660> since<00:03:53.440> it's<00:03:53.620> it's<00:03:54.100> really<00:03:54.430> only

00:03:54.539 --> 00:03:54.549 
that but since it's it's really only

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:57.360 
that but since it's it's really only
useful<00:03:54.790> in<00:03:55.269> in<00:03:55.480> certain<00:03:55.870> rare<00:03:55.989> cases<00:03:56.230> I<00:03:56.590> didn't

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
useful in in certain rare cases I didn't

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:00.360 
useful in in certain rare cases I didn't
see<00:03:57.940> that<00:03:58.090> one<00:03:58.330> as<00:03:58.540> being<00:03:59.320> a<00:03:59.500> very<00:04:00.190> useful

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
see that one as being a very useful

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.940 
see that one as being a very useful
aspect<00:04:01.150> either<00:04:01.330> I<00:04:01.570> would<00:04:02.290> have<00:04:02.500> rather<00:04:02.650> that

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:02.950 
aspect either I would have rather that

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:04.560 
aspect either I would have rather that
he<00:04:03.070> take<00:04:03.250> those<00:04:03.430> two<00:04:03.580> sections<00:04:03.820> and<00:04:04.180> remove

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:04.570 
he take those two sections and remove

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:08.640 
he take those two sections and remove
those<00:04:04.810> and<00:04:05.140> add<00:04:06.040> more<00:04:06.280> examples<00:04:06.730> of<00:04:07.350> weight<00:04:08.350> or

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
those and add more examples of weight or

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:11.460 
those and add more examples of weight or
moving<00:04:09.010> holds<00:04:09.400> or<00:04:09.810> exaggeration<00:04:10.810> for<00:04:11.110> example

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:11.470 
moving holds or exaggeration for example

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.979 
moving holds or exaggeration for example
other<00:04:12.160> than<00:04:12.430> that<00:04:12.580> everything<00:04:13.269> in<00:04:13.360> the<00:04:13.630> DVD<00:04:13.870> is

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:13.989 
other than that everything in the DVD is

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:14.610 
other than that everything in the DVD is
great

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:14.620 
great

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:18.420 
great
I<00:04:14.680> believe<00:04:15.130> it's<00:04:15.280> NTSC<00:04:16.440> standard<00:04:17.440> DVD<00:04:18.010> so<00:04:18.400> I

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:18.430 
I believe it's NTSC standard DVD so I

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:19.979 
I believe it's NTSC standard DVD so I
don't<00:04:18.820> know<00:04:18.940> about<00:04:19.030> the<00:04:19.209> region<00:04:19.479> coding<00:04:19.870> if

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:19.989 
don't know about the region coding if

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:24.060 
don't know about the region coding if
you're<00:04:21.030> here<00:04:22.030> in<00:04:22.090> the<00:04:22.180> States<00:04:22.450> then<00:04:23.070> obviously

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.070 
you're here in the States then obviously

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:25.860 
you're here in the States then obviously
you<00:04:24.490> will<00:04:24.520> have<00:04:24.640> no<00:04:24.849> problems<00:04:25.240> playing<00:04:25.510> it<00:04:25.720> I

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:25.870 
you will have no problems playing it I

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:27.400 
you will have no problems playing it I
don't<00:04:26.229> know<00:04:26.349> about

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:27.410 
don't know about

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:29.410 
don't know about
over<00:04:27.650> in<00:04:27.740> Europe<00:04:27.770> where<00:04:28.520> they<00:04:28.670> use<00:04:28.850> pal<00:04:29.120> and

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:29.420 
over in Europe where they use pal and

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:32.140 
over in Europe where they use pal and
whatnot<00:04:29.800> but<00:04:30.800> if<00:04:31.400> you're<00:04:31.580> over<00:04:31.700> in<00:04:31.760> Europe<00:04:32.000> and

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:32.150 
whatnot but if you're over in Europe and

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:33.340 
whatnot but if you're over in Europe and
you're<00:04:32.300> getting<00:04:32.450> DVDs<00:04:32.870> from<00:04:33.050> the<00:04:33.110> states

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:33.350 
you're getting DVDs from the states

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:35.260 
you're getting DVDs from the states
you're<00:04:33.650> probably<00:04:33.860> used<00:04:34.130> to<00:04:34.220> some<00:04:35.030> sort<00:04:35.240> of

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:35.270 
you're probably used to some sort of

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:37.900 
you're probably used to some sort of
conversion<00:04:35.690> process<00:04:36.110> or<00:04:36.230> whatever<00:04:36.380> so<00:04:37.310> that

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:37.910 
conversion process or whatever so that

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:40.540 
conversion process or whatever so that
is<00:04:38.630> it<00:04:38.990> for<00:04:39.050> this<00:04:39.380> DVD<00:04:39.620> I<00:04:39.740> would<00:04:40.130> of<00:04:40.340> course

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:40.550 
is it for this DVD I would of course

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:42.850 
is it for this DVD I would of course
definitely<00:04:41.000> recommend<00:04:41.660> it<00:04:41.810> if<00:04:41.990> I<00:04:42.500> had<00:04:42.650> to<00:04:42.680> give

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:42.860 
definitely recommend it if I had to give

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:44.920 
definitely recommend it if I had to give
a<00:04:42.890> number<00:04:43.250> value<00:04:43.700> on<00:04:43.820> it<00:04:44.030> I'd<00:04:44.180> give<00:04:44.600> it<00:04:44.720> maybe

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:44.930 
a number value on it I'd give it maybe

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:48.490 
a number value on it I'd give it maybe
in<00:04:45.200> an<00:04:45.380> 8<00:04:46.010> or<00:04:46.040> an<00:04:46.280> 8.5<00:04:46.880> 8<00:04:47.180> probably<00:04:47.600> an<00:04:47.660> 8.5<00:04:48.260> out

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:48.500 
in an 8 or an 8.5 8 probably an 8.5 out

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:50.920 
in an 8 or an 8.5 8 probably an 8.5 out
of<00:04:48.530> 10<00:04:48.970> the<00:04:49.970> other<00:04:50.090> thing<00:04:50.270> is<00:04:50.390> is<00:04:50.570> if<00:04:50.780> you're

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:50.930 
of 10 the other thing is is if you're

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:53.470 
of 10 the other thing is is if you're
looking<00:04:51.260> for<00:04:51.500> specifics<00:04:52.160> on<00:04:52.400> using<00:04:53.150> a<00:04:53.210> certain

master<00:04:56.420> in<00:04:56.840> in<00:04:57.080> this<00:04:57.320> series<00:04:58.310> of<00:04:58.430> DVDs<00:04:59.050> which

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:00.050 
master in in this series of DVDs which

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:02.170 
master in in this series of DVDs which
is<00:05:00.200> animation<00:05:00.800> animation<00:05:01.490> master<00:05:01.880> is<00:05:01.940> what<00:05:02.150> I

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:02.180 
is animation animation master is what I

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:04.660 
is animation animation master is what I
started<00:05:02.570> out<00:05:02.690> using<00:05:02.900> for<00:05:03.740> for<00:05:04.130> animating<00:05:04.640> but

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:04.670 
started out using for for animating but

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:07.540 
started out using for for animating but
animation<00:05:05.630> masters<00:05:05.930> is<00:05:06.140> not<00:05:06.320> a<00:05:06.620> prominent

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:07.550 
animation masters is not a prominent

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:09.190 
animation masters is not a prominent
piece<00:05:07.670> of<00:05:07.820> software<00:05:08.150> anymore<00:05:08.600> and<00:05:08.780> and

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:09.200 
piece of software anymore and and

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:12.370 
piece of software anymore and and
doesn't<00:05:09.740> really<00:05:10.660> play<00:05:11.660> well<00:05:11.870> with<00:05:12.050> the<00:05:12.200> rest

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:12.380 
doesn't really play well with the rest

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:15.220 
doesn't really play well with the rest
of<00:05:12.470> the<00:05:12.560> world<00:05:12.710> you<00:05:12.920> can't<00:05:13.130> use<00:05:13.490> the<00:05:14.420> types<00:05:15.020> of

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:15.230 
of the world you can't use the types of

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:16.630 
of the world you can't use the types of
formats<00:05:15.650> of<00:05:15.740> models<00:05:16.130> that<00:05:16.280> the<00:05:16.370> rest<00:05:16.520> of<00:05:16.580> the

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:16.640 
formats of models that the rest of the

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:18.490 
formats of models that the rest of the
world<00:05:16.790> uses<00:05:17.060> so<00:05:17.840> it<00:05:18.080> doesn't<00:05:18.410> really

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:18.500 
world uses so it doesn't really

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:20.560 
world uses so it doesn't really
integrate<00:05:18.980> well<00:05:19.280> with<00:05:19.430> anything<00:05:19.670> it's<00:05:20.390> not

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:20.570 
integrate well with anything it's not

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:22.630 
integrate well with anything it's not
really<00:05:20.780> used<00:05:20.960> used<00:05:21.620> except<00:05:21.950> for<00:05:22.130> hobbyists

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:22.640 
really used used except for hobbyists

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:25.720 
really used used except for hobbyists
so<00:05:23.590> you're<00:05:24.590> not<00:05:24.710> going<00:05:24.830> to<00:05:24.890> get<00:05:25.070> much<00:05:25.340> in<00:05:25.670> the

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:25.730 
so you're not going to get much in the

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:28.270 
so you're not going to get much in the
way<00:05:26.120> of<00:05:26.320> specifics<00:05:27.320> on<00:05:27.470> using<00:05:27.860> a<00:05:27.890> certain

way of specifics on using a certain

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:30.460 
way of specifics on using a certain
piece<00:05:28.400> of<00:05:28.430> software<00:05:28.880> but<00:05:29.510> what<00:05:30.020> he<00:05:30.110> does<00:05:30.290> show

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:30.470 
piece of software but what he does show

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:33.340 
piece of software but what he does show
you<00:05:30.790> posing<00:05:31.790> a<00:05:31.850> character<00:05:32.270> using<00:05:33.050> the<00:05:33.140> dope

you posing a character using the dope

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:35.770 
you posing a character using the dope
sheet<00:05:33.730> using<00:05:34.730> the<00:05:34.850> timeline<00:05:35.240> and<00:05:35.420> that's<00:05:35.600> her

software out there is going to have that

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:46.330 
software out there is going to have that
it's<00:05:44.450> just<00:05:44.660> gonna<00:05:44.780> be<00:05:45.020> how<00:05:45.800> its<00:05:45.980> implemented

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:46.340 
it's just gonna be how its implemented

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:48.790 
it's just gonna be how its implemented
is<00:05:46.900> different<00:05:47.900> from<00:05:48.020> one<00:05:48.230> piece<00:05:48.380> of<00:05:48.410> software

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:48.800 
is different from one piece of software

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.740 
is different from one piece of software
to<00:05:48.919> the<00:05:49.130> next<00:05:49.400> so<00:05:49.880> you're<00:05:50.210> going<00:05:50.360> to<00:05:50.419> have<00:05:50.570> to

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:50.750 
to the next so you're going to have to

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:52.510 
to the next so you're going to have to
learn<00:05:50.900> that<00:05:51.260> aspect<00:05:51.950> of<00:05:52.100> it<00:05:52.190> on<00:05:52.340> your<00:05:52.460> own

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:52.520 
learn that aspect of it on your own
