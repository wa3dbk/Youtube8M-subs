00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:05.250
 good human staff even back showing you how to use beck 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.209
 transparent textures magui ming bender nest 

00:00:09.209 --> 00:00:13.939
 I'm going to make here a very simple example, rather interesting, yes to whoever 

00:00:13.939 --> 00:00:15.649
 starting 

00:00:15.649 --> 00:00:18.769
 It is sacred that you are seeing December. 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:22.220
 that will serve our example 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.729
 for me to apply transparency on it I'll tax chauÃ­ 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.100
 in the case having two point two here but it can be any one 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.000
 the film library in the leisure tech 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.940
 I'll be able to choose the one that this great 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.610
 only so if the applicator half now is thank you will stay 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.890
 transparent and not the white part here that is what I want 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.630
 so I'll give a check go 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:49.900
 understand that the selection 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.180
 now all white dots at the time the application 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.180
 lula transparency will stay 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.710
 so I'm going in layer 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:02.210
 transparency 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.670
 add channel 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.620
 I'll go back there 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.330
 with the right button layer 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.140
 transparency 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.140
 color for ufpa 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:18.390
 already vital white just a little bit 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.590
 ready now let's save save what we save common 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:25.160
 only because transparency works 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.910
 It's good, we save people. 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:30.200
 in the teixeira extension 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.200
 That afternoon is not going to be nice. 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.460
 one of them 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.780
 spock abbey 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.780
 kiir saves 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.060
 I already left an example ready 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.060
 to make it faster 

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:11.969
 here is the following have to weigh 

00:02:11.969 --> 00:02:14.969
 this plan is going to be our great 

00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:19.009
 so let's split the screen already 

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:22.009
 put an image editor and open it 

00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:25.669
 The big lake I just did. 

00:02:25.669 --> 00:02:28.649
 ensures that it generates 

00:02:28.649 --> 00:02:31.649
 now come here by 

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:33.689
 the negative phase 

00:02:33.689 --> 00:02:36.689
 will open the big media 

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:39.269
 only so it is 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:42.269
 the pedagogical 

00:02:42.859 --> 00:02:45.859
 it will not be transparent also in the 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:51.129
 here I'll have to do in the panel here is fine video editing 

00:02:54.779 --> 00:02:57.779
 He remembered passing here is the laerte teacher. 

00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:00.919
 but it seemed to me not the most to me 

00:03:00.919 --> 00:03:03.919
 the man is here for you to see 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:07.599
 just click this button that is high 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:11.609
 I can already see the ball on the other side. 

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:13.729
 only that has a problem 

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:17.839
 the boy it on the other side also does not have smooth texture on one side 

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:20.419
 How do we do it? 

00:03:20.419 --> 00:03:22.499
 in that same minor 

00:03:22.499 --> 00:03:24.779
 Right here, Uncle leaves. 

00:03:24.779 --> 00:03:26.259
 and fires it 

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:28.999
 that the texture is getting both sides 

00:03:28.999 --> 00:03:31.999
 It's now just to tighten the perh. 

00:03:32.649 --> 00:03:34.299
 it's working 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:36.059
 we call in 

00:03:36.059 --> 00:03:39.059
 bo because a texture quickly months something 

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:43.329
 It will get more interesting. 

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:46.829
 a grass 

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:51.229
 there tickets 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:55.569
 only that year in which there is transparency also that it does not 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:59.019
 grass green 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:02.359
 Only, that's okay, when we press the pt. 

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:05.639
 She's going to play badly. 

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:07.049
 good is this 

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:09.659
 I hope I've helped 

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:13.579
 I'm asking you, it's starting, it's going to be fine tonight. 

00:04:14.719 --> 00:04:16.019
 said and until the next
