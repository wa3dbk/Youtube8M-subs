what I can see is you can see it you saw
this<00:00:27.060> person<00:00:27.570> whoever<00:00:28.079> he<00:00:28.439> or<00:00:28.950> she<00:00:29.189> was<00:00:29.840> was

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
this person whoever he or she was was

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.440 
this person whoever he or she was was
using<00:00:31.230> synthetic<00:00:31.439> oil<00:00:32.300> changing<00:00:33.300> the<00:00:33.420> oil

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
using synthetic oil changing the oil

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.319 
using synthetic oil changing the oil
every<00:00:33.989> 10,000<00:00:34.620> miles

00:00:35.319 --> 00:00:35.329

every 10,000 miles
but<00:00:36.329> I<00:00:36.360> thought<00:00:36.780> synthetic<00:00:37.530> was<00:00:37.800> supposed<00:00:38.370> to

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
but I thought synthetic was supposed to

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.000 
but I thought synthetic was supposed to
be<00:00:38.579> better<00:00:38.789> than<00:00:39.090> conventional<00:00:39.930> well<00:00:40.500> yeah<00:00:40.800> it

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
be better than conventional well yeah it

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.860 
be better than conventional well yeah it
is<00:00:41.160> better<00:00:41.370> but<00:00:41.760> you're<00:00:42.120> not<00:00:42.239> supposed<00:00:42.629> to<00:00:42.690> go

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
is better but you're not supposed to go

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.279 
is better but you're not supposed to go
over<00:00:43.140> five<00:00:43.379> most<00:00:44.339> manufacturers<00:00:45.179> is<00:00:45.390> a<00:00:45.539> 10,000

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
over five most manufacturers is a 10,000

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:52.669 
over five most manufacturers is a 10,000
or<00:00:46.890> even<00:00:47.429> 12<00:00:48.050> but<00:00:49.050> as<00:00:49.499> you<00:00:49.649> can<00:00:49.800> see<00:00:50.359> all<00:00:51.679> the

or even 12 but as you can see all the

00:00:52.679 --> 00:00:59.469 
or even 12 but as you can see all the

Wow
so<00:01:01.530> this<00:01:01.769> is<00:01:01.979> the<00:01:02.159> screen<00:01:02.550> where<00:01:03.449> it<00:01:03.510> picks<00:01:03.780> up

00:01:03.919 --> 00:01:03.929 
so this is the screen where it picks up

00:01:03.929 --> 00:01:09.590 
so this is the screen where it picks up
the<00:01:04.110> oil<00:01:04.320> and<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:05.040> oil<00:01:05.159> pan<00:01:06.380> so<00:01:07.380> that<00:01:07.409> it<00:01:07.650> is<00:01:08.600> is

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
the oil and the oil pan so that it is is

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.980 
the oil and the oil pan so that it is is
all<00:01:09.870> this<00:01:10.110> dirt<00:01:10.770> and<00:01:11.010> gunk<00:01:12.000> gets<00:01:12.390> underneath

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
all this dirt and gunk gets underneath

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.250 
all this dirt and gunk gets underneath
while<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.680> pump<00:01:13.920> is<00:01:14.190> functioning<00:01:14.970> the<00:01:15.260> screen

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:16.260 
while the pump is functioning the screen

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.670 
while the pump is functioning the screen
gets<00:01:16.530> clogged<00:01:16.890> up<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:18.020> oil<00:01:19.020> doesn't<00:01:19.290> go<00:01:19.620> to

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
gets clogged up the oil doesn't go to

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:25.430 
gets clogged up the oil doesn't go to
the<00:01:20.010> head<00:01:20.220> or<00:01:21.770> camshaft<00:01:22.770> and<00:01:22.980> so<00:01:23.990> you<00:01:24.990> can<00:01:25.170> see

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:25.440 
the head or camshaft and so you can see

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:33.560 
the head or camshaft and so you can see
this<00:01:26.280> is<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.640> head<00:01:27.290> and<00:01:31.850> in<00:01:32.850> how<00:01:33.180> many<00:01:33.360> miles

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
this is the head and in how many miles

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:39.080 
this is the head and in how many miles
did<00:01:33.900> this<00:01:34.190> vehicle<00:01:35.190> have<00:01:35.340> on<00:01:35.460> an<00:01:35.580> 85<00:01:36.050> Wow<00:01:38.090> so

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
did this vehicle have on an 85 Wow so

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.150 
did this vehicle have on an 85 Wow so
this<00:01:39.300> is<00:01:39.480> one<00:01:39.660> of<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:39.840> camshaft<00:01:41.240> so<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.420> oil

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:43.160 
this is one of the camshaft so the oil

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.190 
this is one of the camshaft so the oil
when<00:01:44.160> it's<00:01:44.310> picked<00:01:44.790> up<00:01:45.030> from<00:01:45.270> here<00:01:45.630> shoots

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
when it's picked up from here shoots

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.440 
when it's picked up from here shoots
through<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.620> block<00:01:46.860> through<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.490> head<00:01:47.700> to

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
through the block through the head to

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.890 
through the block through the head to
the<00:01:48.540> camp<00:01:48.920> so<00:01:49.920> as<00:01:50.040> you<00:01:50.160> can<00:01:50.340> see<00:01:50.690> because<00:01:51.690> the

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:51.900 
the camp so as you can see because the

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:57.770 
the camp so as you can see because the
lack<00:01:52.140> of<00:01:52.350> oil<00:01:52.590> see<00:01:53.220> this<00:01:53.400> cars<00:01:56.360> supposed<00:01:57.360> to<00:01:57.690> be

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
lack of oil see this cars supposed to be

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:03.860 
lack of oil see this cars supposed to be
very<00:01:58.020> smooth<00:02:00.050> so<00:02:01.050> this<00:02:01.320> is<00:02:01.530> due<00:02:01.920> to<00:02:02.870> using

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:03.870 
very smooth so this is due to using

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:06.650 
very smooth so this is due to using
synthetic<00:02:04.230> oil<00:02:04.860> and<00:02:05.220> not<00:02:05.700> changing<00:02:06.240> it<00:02:06.420> like

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:06.660 
synthetic oil and not changing it like
