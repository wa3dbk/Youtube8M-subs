00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 It's guys who are the ninth game and I'm going today. 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:10.860
 speak here about the rockers or 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:15.839
 Portuguese is funnel it and we will see how 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:18.890
 is that the graffiti artists sound two bars of 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:23.699
 iron on the side below and a 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:26.670
 good number to that makes here a hop 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:29.460
 So what's the use for you? 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:33.600
 Look, you can access it, you can. 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:36.719
 put things inside it here you 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.040
 you can connect one copy with the other 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.079
 there 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.340
 here this function several copies a 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.610
 on top of each other 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:47.460
 you put the item here 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:50.730
 it goes down until it reaches the last 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:53.789
 last itu rate at home one more time 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:57.239
 if button and until here and it arrives until the 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:59.219
 useful and rock you can not only access 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.489
 he put the item you can play here 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.420
 on top because it has a hole that 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:09.540
 you play the item 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:12.600
 then it goes in and goes down everything here 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:15.840
 has several can you can ride direction 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:18.330
 he will play the item because they are all 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:22.080
 down but they can improve to 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:27.060
 down to the left to the right to 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:29.430
 front to back to all the senses - 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:34.710
 Up you can not put a whopper to 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:37.110
 up does not work and how do you 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:41.250
 connects multiple labels even has to have 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:43.409
 the foot that is the last one going to be used 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.930
 then you press shift because if you notice 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:49.950
 shift you will be leaving then if you open 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:52.560
 shift and right click on block the whopper 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:57.140
 connected is the one you play and have here 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.140
 who is going to come here and come in? 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:07.610
 There you can extend this line here. 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:07.610
 enough you throw yourself in the last 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:15.390
 plays here and it goes on until you get there 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:17.550
 in the latter you can even play in the 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.800
 There's no difference either way. 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:23.640
 Everyone is so grateful to talk and this is the 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:26.790
 last one is where it will arrive and we will see 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.170
 how is hopi behaves near the line 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.209
 stone 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.730
 When I answered, it's off. 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:36.000
 usually time will arrive here will 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:39.150
 pass and you will arrive here at the destination 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.269
 now if an activated stone network has 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:45.810
 Look no hopi he stops transmitting 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:48.150
 pass the item he hit and so far and 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.810
 it does not pass gets inside the rotter no 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.049
 goes by 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:54.840
 so I play here this one goes 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:57.060
 passing and this from here like I have a 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.700
 net stone on it it will not pass no 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.799
 will reach her there the moment I 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.739
 As a kid, he's back on the run. 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:07.620
 By then he goes through that last one then 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:09.690
 Europe is different from others because 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.959
 the others usually are triggered 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:15.750
 with active redstone already broken route 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:19.100
 works with straight stone off and 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:23.970
 When you turn it stops working. 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:26.010
 if you turn the break on some block 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:30.600
 that you can put things time like 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:32.370
 chest you play the eternal hop he will play 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:37.349
 direct vol 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:39.000
 It's the same thing with the dispense here. 

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:47.700
 they throw an iron bar 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:49.920
 Come here with the troop too and also 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:52.620
 with the furnace only that the furnace is 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:56.010
 different because here the furnace has 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:04:00.660
 three spaces so doing is very cool 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:03.599
 Look at this break from above it goes. 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:05.669
 fill the space that space here that 

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:06.299
 it is the space of the thing that is going to be who 

00:04:05.669 --> 00:04:08.639
 Woods 

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:11.609
 the side hopi that you vote for 

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:14.579
 will fill the space of the 

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:17.579
 fuel you will use clothes 

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:20.549
 low will get the product and will pass 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:21.079
 meaning you can save a lot of time 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:22.759
 here it looks 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:27.620
 let's get something to give to 

00:04:22.759 --> 00:04:30.340
 stay like a raw steak and a fuel 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:30.340
 coal 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:38.449
 You throw the steak up here and attack 

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:40.330
 here you play some beats here 

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:43.129
 hopi from above 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:45.800
 there you see that they came here in the 

00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:48.639
 top and fuel on the side 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:53.090
 What is coal played here? 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:54.710
 there begins to affect already and when it went well 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:58.699
 and stayed ze du he goes straight to this 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:05:03.199
 hop and goes straight main รณ show with 

00:04:58.699 --> 00:05:05.360
 here it's really cool there dude there you 

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:08.530
 will see this can be extended here 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:11.509
 You know you can press shift will 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:17.840
 extending here is you boot here will be the 

00:05:11.509 --> 00:05:20.210
 coal here it goes all away will come 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:22.639
 in the cars here is not everything either. 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:29.360
 time you boot up you vote amount is 

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:30.560
 here is passing by is not instantaneous 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:33.860
 goes from 1 to 1 

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:37.300
 one of the items the same thing here in 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:37.300
 any other place 

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:45.980
 come from an album now I'll see the 

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:47.690
 break with a comparator or 

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:50.419
 compared as I already said in another 

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:52.610
 video he compares how many blocks 

00:05:50.419 --> 00:05:55.790
 here then if you put items from the 

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:56.540
 block hop will only have a signal because only 

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:57.800
 has a 

00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:01.070
 but if you increase the quantity 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:05.030
 load is increasing here from the 

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:07.580
 comparator and if you put an opera 1 

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:09.650
 mine in the other so look you go 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:12.800
 play here there 

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:15.760
 aiming at him you tighten shift here 

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:20.510
 it was referred you break up 

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:23.210
 press again to shift and will then become a 

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:25.370
 blu a rocker connected on the other ie 

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:27.740
 they will be exchanging items all the time 

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:30.710
 if button item here is going to go 

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:32.960
 coming back and forth and with these 

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:36.860
 this thing there you can put a 

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:39.800
 comparator and you can make a clock 

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:42.260
 the watch when it has a look as soon as 

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:44.240
 stays on and off the network history 

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.680
 you vote in block here will be 

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:48.020
 passing from 1 to 1 

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:51.020
 then you know that the text comparator 

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:53.270
 block there is one and nothing a nothing there goes 

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:55.729
 turning off and how the load 

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:58.930
 reply reply button to give a load 

00:06:55.729 --> 00:07:01.400
 better and here you have already done your 

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:03.410
 rockers watch 

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:05.500
 here I can get in question for 

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:05.500
 example 

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:16.810
 Well, it's cool, man. This is the guy. 

00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:19.960
 all about the Hopi this is a good tutorial 

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:21.060
 basic because op and it is very useful 

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:25.330
 I hope you have enjoyed 

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:27.130
 learned enough will give 

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:30.070
