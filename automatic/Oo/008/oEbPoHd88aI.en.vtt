00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.649
 hello just a few friends here 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:13.940
 new picture will be here 

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:16.980
 me and my team yes i want to go too 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:19.529
 yes, we'll be back with him 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:23.250
 show how to make a nice bathroom 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:25.070
 Can build one with a shower in the 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.300
 Loo with the sink and bath tubs 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:33.989
 Now say we enter first 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:35.820
 for the first time always a level 1 can 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.210
 sometimes a few things show here too 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:43.020
 For example, we have this with this half 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:49.860
 blocks wants to say stone level we have 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:54.840
 3 x 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 He makes such a three 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:58.739
 make eight stone steps easy 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:02.219
 there and here the space of 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.750
 seven i mean yes seven you need 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:07.229
 here 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.250
 That works with the shower as it comes 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:13.530
 the water from above 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:14.810
 if there is nothing to expect in there 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:19.530
 installed 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:23.790
 Extorres is just fun with that 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:28.439
 best to play around with it here 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:31.259
 toilet brain right here you see the 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:35.159
 Although only briefly but you can also 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:38.430
 reinvent the theoretical switch lever 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:40.500
 but that he shit out a bit 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.229
 that just made me a bit stupid and 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.840
 that she did it here 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.640
 the Swiss always has to show that way 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:52.460
 city ​​his faucet as well as there 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.460
 always to the water tub 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:10.410
 Okay, now we'll show you this 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:16.700
 Here, as already mentioned, 3 x 3 x 128 curls 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:20.220
 and yes, only at the beginning did I mold 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:27.380
 So here is a stone stairway so 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:29.220
 So brick wall divides stone 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:32.010
 staircase it does not matter 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:37.080
 gray wool you can also another 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:39.870
 course sees no exception and exception 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.550
 here a kettle fills in here and there 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.220
 her water comes here again 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:49.200
 Cool button in and your trap doors 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:52.260
 So you can do it now 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.370
 a nice sink i would say 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.690
 You could do that, too 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.360
 expand here somehow with 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:03:01.800
 the flip flop if we still have you 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:05.040
 no water you can get here somewhere 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.420
 could build something like that behind 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.739
 we do maybe later 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.290
 I'll show you now with the first 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:12.510
 Fully closed is where you could here 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:15.780
 I do a whole toilette born 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:18.750
 yes then the water drained was a 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:23.489
 that can be shit like that 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:27.239
 Just lie here with the c in the 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:29.790
 middle or in the middle in the filled 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:34.230
 kettle and then here again very important 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:36.330
 the switch means to the water me 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:39.960
 Do you make your chance 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:45.150
 a beautiful parade were as this is where 

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:49.110
 here at stone steps below one 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:53.640
 stone by stone stone stop here 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:55.440
 it then so and you here and then here in 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.260
 These three look here is something 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.070
 left 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:02.820
 do you want this too? 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:09.030
 stone blocks back in and then do 

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:11.850
 that serves you a lever and then you have 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:15.780
 then make your plant bath 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:18.180
 we first tell the shower the stem 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:21.290
 me now because you have to do that now 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:25.980
 still connect with redstone behind 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:31.790
 this is exactly in the vicinity of glass dar 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:35.930
 a beer glass purely so two windows with it 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:35.930
 others can also look nice 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:41.580
 Here you fill this with iron blocks and 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:43.680
 So you get out and in again 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:46.850
 does not come and with that the water does not 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:50.370
 This should be able to flow through here 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:53.760
 stage of the stairs as you want to call because 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:56.150
 pure makes the switch up there or 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.150
 here 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:01.280
 and then you start with the redstone 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:03.900
 Wiring to 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:06.150
 i am i just i would run out 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:07.080
 say that she would be so bad yes 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:13.260
 I say that now with the 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:20.990
 redstone does not start this you speak 

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:23.390
 so quiet advice so built that then stop 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:26.780
 then there comes 

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:34.130
 the pistes of casual pistons exactly 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:37.000
 sticky piston German built it all 

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:40.840
 too little for Germany 

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:43.430
 and then you're doing something like that here 

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:45.800
 could that be synonymous with you on each one 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:53.680
 We wanted to do other material 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:57.740
 Shit not sorry and do there 

00:05:53.680 --> 00:06:04.700
 pure water and then that's just out there 

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:09.470
 and shower exactly could also drip like that 

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:15.200
 so three make drops as they already do 

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:16.670
 long shower here you go in with it 

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:19.100
 Also good back out there is the staircase 

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:21.710
 that's why you can switch off and on 

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:23.570
 we like that with the outside 

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:24.920
 turn on because otherwise it would be 

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:30.170
 gone through and that would be a bit 

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:37.040
 stupid and here and covered the then 

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:38.960
 just the app store and that was it 

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:40.930
 actually already if ye can in 

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:43.610
 make a window clean 

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:46.400
 that 's it then that's your decision 

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:49.190
 where you use fans and how 

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:51.110
 if you do what stones here 

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:53.930
 uses whether we insert stones 

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:58.340
 the other half blocks makes the rhine 

00:06:53.930 --> 00:07:01.220
 or that is what you want the market exactly 

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:05.810
 this role will take whether you stone 

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:08.770
 or doctors this is theirs 

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:14.259
 decision and yes 

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:17.500
 that 's it for now with the net 

00:07:14.259 --> 00:07:18.879
 Bild would be happy about abos likes 

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:21.009
 best he writes in the comments 

00:07:18.879 --> 00:07:26.440
 what we did well what you did 

00:07:21.009 --> 00:07:29.520
 could improve and then until the time 

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:29.520
 next last one up
