about Paducah is the tap tone got an

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.580 
about Paducah is the tap tone got an
outstanding<00:00:16.880> tap<00:00:17.880> tone<00:00:18.180> this<00:00:18.900> guitar<00:00:19.320> body

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
outstanding tap tone this guitar body

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.859 
outstanding tap tone this guitar body
has<00:00:19.770> actually<00:00:20.070> been<00:00:20.189> hollowed<00:00:20.460> out<00:00:20.689> and<00:00:21.689> I

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
has actually been hollowed out and I

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.560 
has actually been hollowed out and I
glued<00:00:22.199> two<00:00:22.949> pieces<00:00:23.310> together<00:00:23.490> you<00:00:24.420> can

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
glued two pieces together you can

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.109 
glued two pieces together you can
usually<00:00:24.720> find<00:00:24.960> Paducah<00:00:25.590> and<00:00:25.800> longer<00:00:26.670> widths

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
usually find Paducah and longer widths

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.599 
usually find Paducah and longer widths
so<00:00:27.689> I<00:00:27.720> get<00:00:27.930> a<00:00:27.960> lot<00:00:28.109> of<00:00:28.140> one-piece<00:00:28.650> tops<00:00:29.010> out<00:00:29.460> of

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
so I get a lot of one-piece tops out of

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:35.450 
so I get a lot of one-piece tops out of
put<00:00:29.760> two<00:00:31.099> sounds<00:00:32.099> outstanding<00:00:34.070> it's<00:00:35.070> a<00:00:35.130> rigid

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
put two sounds outstanding it's a rigid

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.510 
put two sounds outstanding it's a rigid
wood<00:00:36.110> when<00:00:37.110> you<00:00:37.200> first<00:00:37.500> cut<00:00:37.770> it<00:00:37.890> it's<00:00:38.100> bright

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
wood when you first cut it it's bright

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.760 
wood when you first cut it it's bright
red<00:00:38.550> and<00:00:39.360> then<00:00:39.510> over<00:00:39.690> time<00:00:39.870> it<00:00:39.930> does<00:00:40.140> oxidize

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
red and then over time it does oxidize

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.450 
red and then over time it does oxidize
to<00:00:41.190> more<00:00:42.030> of<00:00:42.090> a<00:00:42.180> brownish<00:00:43.170> so<00:00:43.890> this<00:00:44.070> piece<00:00:44.250> was

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
to more of a brownish so this piece was

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.940 
to more of a brownish so this piece was
covered<00:00:44.820> up<00:00:44.940> and<00:00:45.350> still<00:00:46.350> is<00:00:46.440> pretty<00:00:46.710> bright

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
covered up and still is pretty bright

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.740 
covered up and still is pretty bright
right<00:00:47.190> if<00:00:47.340> you<00:00:47.460> use<00:00:47.879> that<00:00:48.059> special<00:00:48.300> finish

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
right if you use that special finish

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.330 
right if you use that special finish
that<00:00:48.930> doesn't<00:00:49.170> access<00:00:49.379> you<00:00:49.680> can<00:00:49.800> almost<00:00:50.010> get

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
that doesn't access you can almost get

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.990 
that doesn't access you can almost get
to<00:00:51.289> keeping<00:00:52.289> it<00:00:52.410> this<00:00:52.559> bright<00:00:52.860> red<00:00:53.070> color<00:00:53.340> it's

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
to keeping it this bright red color it's

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.380 
to keeping it this bright red color it's
good<00:00:54.149> for<00:00:54.329> finger<00:00:54.600> boards<00:00:54.960> and<00:00:55.590> ideal<00:00:56.390> it's

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
good for finger boards and ideal it's

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.099 
good for finger boards and ideal it's
not<00:00:57.570> ideal<00:00:57.899> for<00:00:58.109> necks<00:00:58.379> it<00:00:58.890> does<00:00:59.160> tend<00:00:59.520> to

00:01:00.099 --> 00:01:00.109 
not ideal for necks it does tend to

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:04.630 
not ideal for necks it does tend to
split<00:01:01.109> down<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.469> cracks<00:01:01.770> like<00:01:03.229> here

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:04.640 
split down the cracks like here

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.090 
split down the cracks like here
I've<00:01:05.640> seen<00:01:05.939> it<00:01:06.060> split<00:01:06.530> just<00:01:07.530> because<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:07.979> way

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
I've seen it split just because the way

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.649 
I've seen it split just because the way
the<00:01:08.250> boards<00:01:08.610> grow<00:01:08.970> so<00:01:09.420> long<00:01:09.659> very<00:01:10.619> tall<00:01:10.890> trees

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:11.659 
the boards grow so long very tall trees

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:14.270 
the boards grow so long very tall trees
the<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.930> wood<00:01:13.140> does<00:01:13.380> have<00:01:13.560> a<00:01:13.590> tendency<00:01:13.950> to

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
the the wood does have a tendency to

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.300 
the the wood does have a tendency to
check<00:01:14.670> it's<00:01:15.540> a<00:01:15.570> great<00:01:15.840> sounding<00:01:16.320> wood<00:01:16.560> it<00:01:17.130> is

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
check it's a great sounding wood it is

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.219 
check it's a great sounding wood it is
dense<00:01:17.640> but<00:01:17.970> also<00:01:18.330> you'll<00:01:18.570> be<00:01:18.630> able<00:01:18.780> to<00:01:19.020> find

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
dense but also you'll be able to find

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.350 
dense but also you'll be able to find
pieces<00:01:19.680> that<00:01:19.830> are<00:01:19.920> lightweight<00:01:20.189> you<00:01:21.180> know<00:01:21.299> you

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
pieces that are lightweight you know you

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.630 
pieces that are lightweight you know you
always<00:01:21.600> want<00:01:21.900> to<00:01:21.990> kind<00:01:22.200> of<00:01:22.320> find<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:22.979> top<00:01:23.460> of

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
always want to kind of find the top of

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.130 
always want to kind of find the top of
the<00:01:23.700> tree<00:01:23.939> versus<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.479> bottom<00:01:24.600> of<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:24.900> tree

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
the tree versus the bottom of the tree

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.740 
the tree versus the bottom of the tree
so<00:01:25.830> your<00:01:26.220> lighter<00:01:26.400> more<00:01:26.610> less<00:01:27.030> dense<00:01:27.270> pieces

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
so your lighter more less dense pieces

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.830 
so your lighter more less dense pieces
are<00:01:27.930> I<00:01:28.549> really<00:01:29.549> enjoy<00:01:29.790> using<00:01:30.000> this<00:01:30.270> wood<00:01:30.540> in

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
are I really enjoy using this wood in

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.870 
are I really enjoy using this wood in
terms<00:01:31.020> of<00:01:31.170> how<00:01:31.259> it<00:01:31.350> takes<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.680> stain<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.670> red

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
terms of how it takes the stain the red

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.440 
terms of how it takes the stain the red
contrast<00:01:33.540> looks<00:01:34.350> outstanding

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 
contrast looks outstanding

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.200 
contrast looks outstanding
against<00:01:36.450> maple<00:01:36.900> or<00:01:37.290> walnut<00:01:37.920> you<00:01:38.430> know<00:01:38.520> it<00:01:38.909> fits

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
against maple or walnut you know it fits

like<00:01:44.159> I<00:01:44.310> said<00:01:44.369> workability<00:01:44.939> with<00:01:45.299> padukas<00:01:45.840> is

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
like I said workability with padukas is

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.109 
like I said workability with padukas is
really<00:01:46.470> nice<00:01:46.649> this<00:01:47.070> is<00:01:47.220> that<00:01:47.369> same<00:01:47.610> Makita
