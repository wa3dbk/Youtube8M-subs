San<00:00:24.930> Jose<00:00:24.960> I<00:00:25.470> don't<00:00:25.980> think<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:26.220> city<00:00:26.400> of<00:00:26.490> San

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
San Jose I don't think the city of San

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.310 
San Jose I don't think the city of San
Francisco<00:00:27.060> would<00:00:27.210> do<00:00:27.390> anything<00:00:27.630> about<00:00:27.900> it<00:00:28.050> I

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
Francisco would do anything about it I

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.500 
Francisco would do anything about it I
think<00:00:28.560> if<00:00:28.650> they<00:00:28.800> had<00:00:29.130> all<00:00:29.490> this<00:00:29.760> data<00:00:30.150> they're

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
think if they had all this data they're

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.049 
think if they had all this data they're
collecting<00:00:30.539> I<00:00:31.320> mean<00:00:31.710> that's<00:00:31.830> me<00:00:32.220> seem<00:00:32.489> obvious

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
collecting I mean that's me seem obvious

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.420 
collecting I mean that's me seem obvious
a<00:00:33.239> great<00:00:33.660> app<00:00:33.870> it's<00:00:34.110> a<00:00:34.170> great<00:00:34.350> idea<00:00:34.379> but<00:00:34.920> like

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
a great app it's a great idea but like

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:36.680 
a great app it's a great idea but like
that<00:00:35.610> seems<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:36.000> biggest<00:00:36.239> risk<00:00:36.420> for<00:00:36.600> this

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
that seems the biggest risk for this

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.140 
that seems the biggest risk for this
company<00:00:36.989> so<00:00:37.699> it's<00:00:38.699> interesting<00:00:38.850> you

time<00:00:49.769> you<00:00:50.369> know<00:00:50.400> I<00:00:50.610> think<00:00:50.729> it's<00:00:50.940> 48<00:00:51.869> hours<00:00:52.140> you

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
time you know I think it's 48 hours you

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:53.899 
time you know I think it's 48 hours you
know<00:00:52.949> and<00:00:53.159> you<00:00:53.250> know<00:00:53.369> I<00:00:53.400> think<00:00:53.549> what<00:00:53.790> the

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:53.909 
know and you know I think what the

00:00:53.909 --> 00:00:56.149 
know and you know I think what the
important<00:00:54.299> thing<00:00:54.449> here<00:00:54.479> is<00:00:54.780> a<00:00:55.260> lot<00:00:55.860> of<00:00:55.979> times

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:56.159 
important thing here is a lot of times

00:00:56.159 --> 00:00:57.680 
important thing here is a lot of times
when<00:00:56.280> people<00:00:56.339> make<00:00:56.670> reports<00:00:57.030> they<00:00:57.360> don't<00:00:57.570> go

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
when people make reports they don't go

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.840 
when people make reports they don't go
to<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:57.869> right<00:00:57.989> person<00:00:58.199> and<00:00:58.500> this<00:00:59.220> solves<00:00:59.760> that

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
to the right person and this solves that

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.789 
to the right person and this solves that
problem<00:00:59.909> because<00:01:00.659> reports<00:01:01.140> are<00:01:01.260> categorized

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:01.799 
problem because reports are categorized

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:04.310 
problem because reports are categorized
into<00:01:02.220> the<00:01:02.460> right<00:01:02.670> unit<00:01:03.119> and<00:01:03.510> oftentimes

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
into the right unit and oftentimes

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.020 
into the right unit and oftentimes
people<00:01:04.619> get<00:01:04.860> frustrated<00:01:05.100> like<00:01:05.610> you<00:01:05.820> and<00:01:05.970> they

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
people get frustrated like you and they

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.280 
people get frustrated like you and they
say<00:01:06.150> okay<00:01:06.240> I<00:01:06.390> make<00:01:06.540> it<00:01:06.659> reports<00:01:06.960> nothing's

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
happening so what you end up doing is

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.280 
happening so what you end up doing is
you<00:01:09.180> look<00:01:09.330> at<00:01:09.450> a<00:01:09.479> map<00:01:09.690> like<00:01:09.870> when<00:01:10.020> we<00:01:10.140> showed

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
you look at a map like when we showed

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.200 
you look at a map like when we showed
earlier<00:01:10.470> there's<00:01:10.830> no<00:01:10.890> flags<00:01:11.250> private<00:01:12.120> if

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
earlier there's no flags private if

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.450 
earlier there's no flags private if
people<00:01:12.480> are<00:01:12.570> continuing<00:01:13.200> to<00:01:13.230> report<00:01:13.830> and

people are continuing to report and
you're<00:01:14.550> building<00:01:14.940> the<00:01:15.030> excitement<00:01:15.480> about

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:15.510 
you're building the excitement about

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:17.000 
you're building the excitement about
getting<00:01:15.930> things<00:01:16.110> done<00:01:16.380> all<00:01:16.560> of<00:01:16.590> a<00:01:16.680> sudden<00:01:16.950> you

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:17.010 
getting things done all of a sudden you

getting things done all of a sudden you
start<00:01:17.310> to<00:01:17.430> see<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.790> clusters<00:01:18.270> form<00:01:18.960> and<00:01:19.170> then

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:19.230 
start to see the clusters form and then

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:20.750 
start to see the clusters form and then
efforts<00:01:19.620> can<00:01:19.770> be<00:01:19.800> concentrated<00:01:20.550> to<00:01:20.610> make<00:01:20.730> a

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:20.760 
efforts can be concentrated to make a

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.420 
efforts can be concentrated to make a
real<00:01:21.030> difference<00:01:21.320> that's<00:01:22.320> what<00:01:22.500> we<00:01:22.710> have<00:01:23.220> done

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
real difference that's what we have done
