it's just some tips that I came across
on<00:00:31.060> a<00:00:31.089> website<00:00:31.739> over<00:00:32.739> two<00:00:32.920> years<00:00:33.220> ago<00:00:33.550> and<00:00:34.150> I've

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:34.420 
on a website over two years ago and I've

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.740 
on a website over two years ago and I've
been<00:00:34.449> using<00:00:34.960> this<00:00:35.640> technique<00:00:36.640> for<00:00:37.089> you<00:00:37.629> know

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:37.750 
been using this technique for you know

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.410 
been using this technique for you know
for<00:00:37.989> this<00:00:38.110> for<00:00:38.680> this<00:00:38.830> time<00:00:39.100> and<00:00:39.489> it<00:00:39.760> really<00:00:40.059> has

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:40.420 
for this for this time and it really has

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:42.630 
for this for this time and it really has
worked<00:00:40.449> for<00:00:40.989> me<00:00:41.140> and<00:00:41.290> maybe<00:00:41.860> it<00:00:42.040> will<00:00:42.220> work<00:00:42.430> for

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:42.640 
worked for me and maybe it will work for

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:43.289 
worked for me and maybe it will work for
you

00:00:43.289 --> 00:00:43.299 
you

00:00:43.299 --> 00:00:45.329 
you
I<00:00:43.330> don't<00:00:43.839> like<00:00:44.019> washing<00:00:44.260> my<00:00:44.619> hair<00:00:44.860> every<00:00:45.159> day

I don't like washing my hair every day

00:00:45.339 --> 00:00:49.350 
I don't like washing my hair every day
because<00:00:45.909> I<00:00:45.940> think<00:00:46.769> it<00:00:47.769> dries<00:00:48.100> your<00:00:48.430> hair<00:00:48.460> it

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:49.360 
because I think it dries your hair it

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.869 
because I think it dries your hair it
doesn't<00:00:49.540> allow<00:00:50.040> the<00:00:51.040> goodness<00:00:51.430> that<00:00:51.489> your

00:00:51.869 --> 00:00:51.879 
doesn't allow the goodness that your

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:53.969 
doesn't allow the goodness that your
hair<00:00:52.180> naturally<00:00:52.360> has<00:00:52.930> like<00:00:53.229> some<00:00:53.530> natural

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:53.979 
hair naturally has like some natural

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:56.820 
hair naturally has like some natural

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:56.830 
oils to actually stay in your hair so I

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:59.310 
oils to actually stay in your hair so I
like<00:00:57.400> to<00:00:57.580> wash<00:00:57.760> my<00:00:57.790> hair<00:00:58.210> maybe<00:00:58.449> twice<00:00:58.869> a<00:00:58.900> week

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:01.600 
if I do it more than that it's maybe

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.600 
if I do it more than that it's maybe
because<00:01:01.869> I'm<00:01:02.260> on<00:01:02.439> holiday<00:01:02.920> and<00:01:03.250> you<00:01:03.309> know<00:01:03.549> you

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:08.560 
you want to wash your hair if you you

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.499 
you want to wash your hair if you you
know<00:01:08.680> more<00:01:08.890> often<00:01:09.250> but<00:01:09.460> you<00:01:09.939> know<00:01:10.060> when<00:01:10.329> I'm<00:01:10.479> at

something like this a little bit smaller

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:53.219 
something like this a little bit smaller
that<00:01:51.189> you<00:01:51.249> don't<00:01:51.579> have<00:01:51.759> to<00:01:51.939> twist<00:01:52.229> twice

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:53.229
