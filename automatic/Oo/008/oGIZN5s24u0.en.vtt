00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
you have relatively fine sand you will

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.929 
you have relatively fine sand you will
get<00:01:11.880> every<00:01:12.630> bit<00:01:12.659> of<00:01:12.900> that<00:01:13.560> rain<00:01:13.979> stick<00:01:14.280> covered

get every bit of that rain stick covered
with<00:01:15.299> sand<00:01:15.570> and<00:01:16.070> then<00:01:17.070> you<00:01:17.220> have<00:01:17.400> a<00:01:17.430> very<00:01:17.880> very

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
with sand and then you have a very very

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.870 
with sand and then you have a very very
unique<00:01:18.450> look<00:01:19.020> to<00:01:19.049> your<00:01:19.470> rain<00:01:19.680> stick<00:01:19.880> now

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
unique look to your rain stick now

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.060 
unique look to your rain stick now
another<00:01:21.420> thing<00:01:21.540> that<00:01:21.900> you<00:01:22.020> could<00:01:22.259> do<00:01:22.500> would<00:01:22.890> be

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
another thing that you could do would be

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.980 
another thing that you could do would be
to<00:01:23.100> use<00:01:23.340> different<00:01:23.820> colors<00:01:24.210> of<00:01:24.240> sand<00:01:24.780> and

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
to use different colors of sand and

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.260 
to use different colors of sand and
spread<00:01:25.799> them<00:01:25.950> out<00:01:26.070> across<00:01:26.400> your<00:01:26.700> paper<00:01:26.939> towel

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
spread them out across your paper towel

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.260 
spread them out across your paper towel
and<00:01:27.540> then<00:01:28.140> roll<00:01:28.470> your<00:01:28.500> paint<00:01:29.280> your<00:01:29.850> rain<00:01:30.090> stick

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
and then roll your paint your rain stick

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.210 
and then roll your paint your rain stick
slowly<00:01:30.720> through<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.170> colors<00:01:31.530> of<00:01:31.560> sand<00:01:32.009> and

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
slowly through the colors of sand and

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.300 
slowly through the colors of sand and
then<00:01:32.820> you<00:01:32.939> would<00:01:33.060> have<00:01:33.090> again<00:01:33.780> sand<00:01:34.770> and<00:01:35.130> the

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
then you would have again sand and the

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.160 
then you would have again sand and the
texture<00:01:35.790> but<00:01:36.000> also<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.479> different<00:01:36.810> colors

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
texture but also the different colors

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.380 
texture but also the different colors
once<00:01:38.100> your<00:01:38.340> glue<00:01:38.549> and<00:01:38.759> your<00:01:38.880> sand<00:01:39.180> is

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
once your glue and your sand is

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.260 
once your glue and your sand is
completely<00:01:40.259> dry<00:01:40.530> you<00:01:41.189> may<00:01:41.430> want<00:01:41.610> to<00:01:41.790> coat<00:01:42.240> it

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
completely dry you may want to coat it

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.710
