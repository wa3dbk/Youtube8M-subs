00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
ahead and talk about it now this is a

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.460 
ahead and talk about it now this is a
little<00:00:15.120> bit<00:00:15.269> difficult<00:00:15.450> I'm<00:00:15.900> not<00:00:16.049> gonna<00:00:16.199> lie

little bit difficult I'm not gonna lie

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.250 
little bit difficult I'm not gonna lie
but<00:00:16.800> I<00:00:17.190> think<00:00:17.550> it's<00:00:17.670> definitely<00:00:18.119> doable<00:00:18.390> first

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
but I think it's definitely doable first

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.900 
but I think it's definitely doable first

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
will of the style so you're gonna start

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.889 
will of the style so you're gonna start
at<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.309> back<00:00:56.579> of<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:56.879> part<00:00:57.149> you're<00:00:57.750> gonna

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
at the back of the part you're gonna

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.049 
at the back of the part you're gonna
braid<00:00:58.199> forward<00:00:58.680> toward<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.190> face<00:00:59.340> doing<00:00:59.910> a

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
braid forward toward the face doing a

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.299 
braid forward toward the face doing a
Dutch<00:01:00.300> braid<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:01.440> reason<00:01:01.739> that<00:01:01.829> you<00:01:01.949> do<00:01:02.129> that

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
Dutch braid the reason that you do that

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:03.889 
Dutch braid the reason that you do that
is<00:01:02.579> so<00:01:02.730> that<00:01:02.850> it<00:01:02.969> looks<00:01:03.180> really<00:01:03.270> pretty<00:01:03.660> when

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
is so that it looks really pretty when

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.509 
is so that it looks really pretty when
it<00:01:04.019> gets<00:01:04.170> up<00:01:04.350> to<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.710> face<00:01:04.860> cuz<00:01:05.129> it's<00:01:05.280> a<00:01:05.339> lot

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
it gets up to the face cuz it's a lot

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.670 
it gets up to the face cuz it's a lot
thicker<00:01:05.909> and<00:01:06.090> bigger<00:01:06.540> so<00:01:06.930> it<00:01:07.049> has<00:01:07.229> kind<00:01:07.590> of

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
thicker and bigger so it has kind of

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.469 
thicker and bigger so it has kind of
more<00:01:07.830> of<00:01:07.950> a<00:01:08.010> statement<00:01:08.310> to<00:01:08.610> it<00:01:08.760> and<00:01:09.119> you<00:01:09.299> don't

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
more of a statement to it and you don't

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.210 
more of a statement to it and you don't
have<00:01:09.600> any<00:01:09.840> weird<00:01:10.140> like<00:01:10.470> areas<00:01:10.890> where<00:01:11.070> there's

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
have any weird like areas where there's

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.130 
have any weird like areas where there's
no<00:01:11.430> braid<00:01:11.790> yet<00:01:12.090> if<00:01:12.270> that<00:01:12.390> makes<00:01:12.570> any<00:01:12.750> sense

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
no braid yet if that makes any sense

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.109 
no braid yet if that makes any sense
so<00:01:13.680> you<00:01:13.740> just<00:01:13.890> braid<00:01:14.130> forward<00:01:14.580> until<00:01:14.850> you<00:01:14.970> get

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
so you just braid forward until you get

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.520 
so you just braid forward until you get
to<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.330> hairline<00:01:15.630> and<00:01:15.840> then<00:01:16.080> go<00:01:16.229> ahead<00:01:16.320> and

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
to the hairline and then go ahead and

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.260 
to the hairline and then go ahead and
turn<00:01:16.680> your<00:01:16.740> hands<00:01:17.159> and<00:01:17.310> start<00:01:17.520> braiding<00:01:17.759> along

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
turn your hands and start braiding along

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.330 
turn your hands and start braiding along
the<00:01:18.420> hairline<00:01:18.630> and<00:01:19.049> you<00:01:19.830> want<00:01:20.009> to<00:01:20.070> keep<00:01:20.159> this

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.080 
about medium tension here we're gonna go
back<00:01:22.619> and<00:01:22.830> kind<00:01:23.189> of<00:01:23.310> pull<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.700> braid<00:01:23.880> out<00:01:24.060> a

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
back and kind of pull the braid out a

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.700 
back and kind of pull the braid out a
little<00:01:24.420> bit<00:01:24.540> to<00:01:24.720> make<00:01:24.810> it<00:01:24.869> as<00:01:25.110> big<00:01:25.320> as<00:01:25.530> possible

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
little bit to make it as big as possible

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.980 
little bit to make it as big as possible
especially<00:01:26.700> if<00:01:27.090> you<00:01:27.210> have<00:01:27.360> fine<00:01:27.600> hair<00:01:27.630> like

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
especially if you have fine hair like

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.600 
especially if you have fine hair like
mine<00:01:28.259> because<00:01:28.829> you're<00:01:29.100> definitely<00:01:29.250> going<00:01:29.549> to

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
mine because you're definitely going to

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:30.800 
mine because you're definitely going to
need<00:01:29.670> to<00:01:29.909> do<00:01:30.000> that<00:01:30.150> to<00:01:30.270> get<00:01:30.360> that<00:01:30.509> big

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
need to do that to get that big

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.319 
need to do that to get that big
voluminous<00:01:31.110> braid<00:01:31.560> like<00:01:31.740> she<00:01:31.950> had<00:01:32.159> and<00:01:32.520> then

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
voluminous braid like she had and then

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:34.640 
voluminous braid like she had and then
you're<00:01:33.509> just<00:01:33.600> gonna<00:01:33.750> keep<00:01:33.990> braiding<00:01:34.229> until

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
you're just gonna keep braiding until

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.410 
you're just gonna keep braiding until
you<00:01:34.829> completely<00:01:35.400> incorporate<00:01:35.939> all<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:36.270> hair

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
you completely incorporate all the hair

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.030 
you completely incorporate all the hair
from<00:01:36.540> that<00:01:36.600> section<00:01:36.990> so<00:01:37.320> you<00:01:37.380> should<00:01:37.650> get<00:01:37.860> down

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
from that section so you should get down

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.399 
from that section so you should get down
to<00:01:38.430> the<00:01:39.090> top<00:01:39.240> of<00:01:39.390> your<00:01:39.479> ear<00:01:39.720> or<00:01:39.960> maybe<00:01:40.170> even

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
to the top of your ear or maybe even

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:41.749 
to the top of your ear or maybe even
just<00:01:40.500> a<00:01:40.590> little<00:01:40.619> bit<00:01:40.829> behind<00:01:41.220> your<00:01:41.610> ear

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
just a little bit behind your ear

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.310 
just a little bit behind your ear
depending<00:01:42.180> on<00:01:42.270> how<00:01:42.390> you<00:01:42.450> took<00:01:42.630> that<00:01:42.689> section

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
depending on how you took that section

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.319 
depending on how you took that section
and<00:01:43.590> then<00:01:44.159> of<00:01:44.340> course<00:01:44.399> once<00:01:44.759> you<00:01:44.909> get<00:01:45.090> there

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
and then of course once you get there

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:46.850 
and then of course once you get there
all<00:01:45.540> you're<00:01:45.659> going<00:01:45.810> to<00:01:45.930> do<00:01:46.049> is<00:01:46.259> braid<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:46.710> rest

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
all you're going to do is braid the rest

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.010 
all you're going to do is braid the rest
of<00:01:47.009> the<00:01:47.100> hair<00:01:47.280> normally<00:01:47.820> and<00:01:48.689> once<00:01:48.869> you've

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
of the hair normally and once you've

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.420 
of the hair normally and once you've
braided<00:01:49.200> all<00:01:49.530> that<00:01:49.770> hair<00:01:49.950> you<00:01:50.070> want<00:01:50.220> to<00:01:50.310> go

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
braided all that hair you want to go

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.340 
braided all that hair you want to go
ahead<00:01:50.549> and<00:01:50.880> secure<00:01:51.240> it<00:01:51.299> with<00:01:51.420> a<00:01:51.479> small<00:01:51.780> band<00:01:52.049> to

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
ahead and secure it with a small band to

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.929 
ahead and secure it with a small band to
make<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.590> rest<00:01:52.740> of<00:01:52.890> this<00:01:53.009> hairstyle<00:01:53.220> easier

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
make the rest of this hairstyle easier

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.880 
make the rest of this hairstyle easier
so<00:01:54.689> that<00:01:54.720> it's<00:01:55.020> not<00:01:55.110> unraveling<00:01:55.680> when<00:01:55.799> you're

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
so that it's not unraveling when you're

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:56.840 
so that it's not unraveling when you're
trying<00:01:55.979> to<00:01:56.070> work<00:01:56.219> on<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.369> hairstyle<00:01:56.729> because

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
trying to work on the hairstyle because

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.840 
trying to work on the hairstyle because
that<00:01:57.180> would<00:01:57.360> not<00:01:57.479> be<00:01:57.719> any<00:01:57.960> fun

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
that would not be any fun

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:00.850 
that would not be any fun
so<00:01:59.630> once<00:01:59.810> all<00:01:59.990> that<00:02:00.170> Sun<00:02:00.440> you're<00:02:00.590> gonna<00:02:00.680> go

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
so once all that Sun you're gonna go

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:02.500 
so once all that Sun you're gonna go
ahead<00:02:00.979> and<00:02:01.159> take<00:02:01.430> your<00:02:01.580> fingers<00:02:01.940> and<00:02:01.970> begin<00:02:02.390> to

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:02.510 
ahead and take your fingers and begin to

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:04.450 
ahead and take your fingers and begin to
pull<00:02:02.720> the<00:02:02.750> brain<00:02:03.050> apart<00:02:03.380> a<00:02:03.560> little<00:02:03.710> bit<00:02:03.920> but

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 
pull the brain apart a little bit but

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:05.980 
pull the brain apart a little bit but
that's<00:02:04.550> gonna<00:02:04.760> do<00:02:05.000> is<00:02:05.210> to<00:02:05.390> make<00:02:05.540> it<00:02:05.570> look<00:02:05.690> about

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
that's gonna do is to make it look about

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.469 
that's gonna do is to make it look about
twice<00:02:06.710> as<00:02:06.920> big<00:02:07.130> at<00:02:07.340> least<00:02:07.370> as<00:02:07.880> it<00:02:08.119> was<00:02:08.240> before

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
twice as big at least as it was before

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:09.880 
twice as big at least as it was before
so<00:02:08.840> it<00:02:08.929> makes<00:02:09.080> you<00:02:09.200> look<00:02:09.259> like<00:02:09.410> you<00:02:09.500> have<00:02:09.679> more

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
so it makes you look like you have more

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:11.440 
so it makes you look like you have more
hair<00:02:10.100> and<00:02:10.130> it<00:02:10.459> creates<00:02:10.789> more<00:02:10.850> of<00:02:11.060> a<00:02:11.120> statement

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
hair and it creates more of a statement

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.780 
hair and it creates more of a statement
a<00:02:11.690> little<00:02:11.870> bit<00:02:11.959> more<00:02:12.110> visual<00:02:12.290> fact<00:02:12.770> as<00:02:12.950> well<00:02:13.100> so

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
a little bit more visual fact as well so

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.190 
a little bit more visual fact as well so
you<00:02:13.880> want<00:02:14.000> to<00:02:14.090> start<00:02:14.240> at<00:02:14.300> the<00:02:14.390> bottom<00:02:14.540> and<00:02:14.870> do

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
you want to start at the bottom and do

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.540 
you want to start at the bottom and do
that<00:02:15.320> going<00:02:15.620> toward<00:02:15.890> the<00:02:15.950> top<00:02:16.130> until<00:02:16.490> you

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
that going toward the top until you

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.340 
that going toward the top until you
reach<00:02:16.670> the<00:02:16.850> very<00:02:17.000> top<00:02:17.060> of<00:02:17.240> the<00:02:17.450> braid<00:02:17.660> and<00:02:17.930> you

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.350 
reach the very top of the braid and you

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.090 
reach the very top of the braid and you
have<00:02:18.530> your<00:02:18.770> braids<00:02:19.670> nicely<00:02:20.270> but<00:02:20.480> luminize

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
alright and what's that done we're going

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.970 
alright and what's that done we're going
to<00:02:23.150> go<00:02:23.209> ahead<00:02:23.390> and<00:02:23.690> do<00:02:23.900> another<00:02:24.050> Dutch<00:02:24.680> braid

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
to go ahead and do another Dutch braid

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:26.770 
to go ahead and do another Dutch braid
on<00:02:25.190> the<00:02:25.340> other<00:02:25.490> side<00:02:25.790> of<00:02:25.880> the<00:02:25.970> part<00:02:26.180> what's

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
on the other side of the part what's

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.150 
on the other side of the part what's
different<00:02:27.140> about<00:02:27.170> this<00:02:27.500> one<00:02:27.709> is<00:02:27.860> that<00:02:28.040> you're

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
different about this one is that you're

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.860 
different about this one is that you're
actually<00:02:28.340> rating<00:02:28.790> this<00:02:28.910> one<00:02:29.090> on<00:02:29.270> the<00:02:29.480> back<00:02:29.690> of

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
actually rating this one on the back of

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.210 
actually rating this one on the back of
the<00:02:29.959> section<00:02:30.320> rather<00:02:30.440> than<00:02:30.709> next<00:02:31.040> to<00:02:31.130> the

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
the section rather than next to the

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.900 
the section rather than next to the
hairline

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
hairline

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:33.850 
hairline
that's<00:02:32.540> how<00:02:32.660> Demi<00:02:32.930> Lovato's<00:02:33.320> hair<00:02:33.530> was<00:02:33.680> done

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
that's how Demi Lovato's hair was done

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.320 
that's how Demi Lovato's hair was done
and<00:02:34.070> I<00:02:34.160> kind<00:02:34.340> of<00:02:34.400> liked<00:02:34.640> it<00:02:34.760> because<00:02:34.970> that

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
and I kind of liked it because that

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:36.910 
and I kind of liked it because that
keeps<00:02:35.510> all<00:02:35.810> the<00:02:35.900> visual<00:02:36.200> interest<00:02:36.500> on<00:02:36.739> that

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
keeps all the visual interest on that

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.280 
keeps all the visual interest on that
one<00:02:37.190> really<00:02:37.550> big<00:02:37.730> braid<00:02:38.030> but<00:02:38.930> you<00:02:39.020> can<00:02:39.140> always

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
one really big braid but you can always

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:40.420

works with your hair links what I did

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:03.570 
works with your hair links what I did
first<00:04:01.960> was<00:04:02.170> to<00:04:02.440> pin<00:04:02.620> this<00:04:02.770> one<00:04:02.830> braids<00:04:03.280> going

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:03.580 
first was to pin this one braids going

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:05.190 
first was to pin this one braids going
toward<00:04:03.850> the<00:04:03.970> right<00:04:04.180> just<00:04:04.840> so<00:04:04.960> that<00:04:05.080> I<00:04:05.110> could

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.200 
toward the right just so that I could

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.420 
toward the right just so that I could
continue<00:04:05.680> working<00:04:05.800> with<00:04:06.100> it

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:06.430 
continue working with it

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:08.730 
continue working with it
but<00:04:06.970> before<00:04:07.270> I<00:04:07.300> did<00:04:07.450> that<00:04:07.600> because<00:04:08.140> I<00:04:08.410> only<00:04:08.530> had

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:08.740 
but before I did that because I only had

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:10.170 
but before I did that because I only had
a<00:04:08.770> little<00:04:08.980> bit<00:04:09.100> of<00:04:09.220> hair<00:04:09.460> left<00:04:09.730> from<00:04:10.150> that

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 
a little bit of hair left from that

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.570 
a little bit of hair left from that
first<00:04:10.570> Dutch<00:04:10.990> braid<00:04:11.290> I<00:04:11.500> went<00:04:12.100> ahead<00:04:12.160> and<00:04:12.280> put

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:12.580 
first Dutch braid I went ahead and put

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:14.010 
first Dutch braid I went ahead and put
it<00:04:12.700> underneath<00:04:12.970> the<00:04:13.240> second<00:04:13.570> Dutch<00:04:13.720> braiding

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:14.020 
it underneath the second Dutch braiding

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:16.110 
it underneath the second Dutch braiding
kind<00:04:14.470> of<00:04:14.680> hit<00:04:14.830> it<00:04:14.860> except<00:04:15.370> for<00:04:15.400> that<00:04:15.580> one<00:04:15.850> end

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:16.120 
kind of hit it except for that one end

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.120 
kind of hit it except for that one end
that<00:04:16.269> was<00:04:16.420> sticking<00:04:16.630> out<00:04:16.900> so<00:04:17.140> that<00:04:17.709> I<00:04:17.739> wouldn't

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.130 
that was sticking out so that I wouldn't

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:19.830 
that was sticking out so that I wouldn't
have<00:04:18.220> to<00:04:18.340> deal<00:04:18.489> with<00:04:18.670> it<00:04:18.850> and<00:04:19.030> then<00:04:19.570> with<00:04:19.690> the

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
have to deal with it and then with the

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.479 
have to deal with it and then with the
remaining<00:04:20.079> braids<00:04:20.440> that<00:04:20.620> I<00:04:20.650> had<00:04:20.890> left<00:04:21.130> I<00:04:21.310> made

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489 
remaining braids that I had left I made

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:23.700 
remaining braids that I had left I made
kind<00:04:21.609> of<00:04:21.700> a<00:04:21.850> smile<00:04:22.150> it<00:04:22.510> shape<00:04:22.930> to<00:04:23.140> continue<00:04:23.590> the

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:23.710 
kind of a smile it shape to continue the

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:25.440 
kind of a smile it shape to continue the
shape<00:04:23.890> of<00:04:24.040> the<00:04:24.160> crown<00:04:24.340> going<00:04:24.700> around<00:04:25.090> my<00:04:25.240> head

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:25.450 
shape of the crown going around my head

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:27.180 
shape of the crown going around my head

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:48.310 
different just depending on how the

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:50.250 
different just depending on how the
braids<00:04:48.610> worked<00:04:48.910> out<00:04:49.090> so<00:04:49.720> once<00:04:49.900> you<00:04:49.990> get<00:04:50.110> all

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:50.260
