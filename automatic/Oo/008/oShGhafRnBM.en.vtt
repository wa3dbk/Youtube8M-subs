00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:32.579
 good after it's mine I'm arthritis and I'm playing guitar mans in their 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.180
 class 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.180
 the singer mary j the singer of moriarty 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:38.929
 listening 

00:00:38.929 --> 00:00:41.040
 their meat 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.410
 death gear and craftsmen 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.620
 past cc home we have a performance is a leader 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.730
 the American territory is full of songs 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.430
 and here we come from there 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:54.870
 brian lenihan 18 133 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.870
 but music are stories 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.440
 fictional or real characters invented in real life 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.180
 stone precisely 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.260
 prince moriarty in august 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.350
 but in fact we do not like to give tickets to this musical press that 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.680
 the mandate we always wrote his songs in a small room 9 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:14.770
 square meters 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.790
 so there was m people call him as they did so so it's very 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.880
 difficult to write music except that various and stories 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:26.080
 concert to count the concerts confront or 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.270
 Kombouare 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.230
 so we were inspired by real facts 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:33.040
 everyone listened to very different music 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.580
 but down to 500 people 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:37.940
 Bouthillier listened to very different things with 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:40.080
 very different personalities 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:45.360
 and so this music is a kind of mixture its influences and everyone pulls 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.680
 a little blanket 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.250
 and at the same time 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.800
 s everything is done based improvisation bakou apa there is no rule for 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.640
 the songs of each song is very different is made 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.260
 they do not feel the one before that the press 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.470
 we play here because we have a menu 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.930
 we won in prison in France which is called the heels of the towers in dany 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:07.310
 so it's the adami it's the association of the musicians of the performers who 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.610
 awards prizes every year unlike part this year ago i 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.179
 believe with us broken rock there 

00:02:13.179 --> 00:02:16.179
 do a lot of other artists and for those who cons 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:20.739
 suddenly the guests by a lot of festivals we played hockey do not have 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:24.139
 played at benicassim in spain another 

00:02:24.139 --> 00:02:26.739
 at francofolies de la rochelle 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:29.779
 menongue spring of eurockÃ©ennes bourges egypt 

00:02:29.779 --> 00:02:32.419
 bourges spring so here 

00:02:32.419 --> 00:02:35.419
 so that allows us to access a club that is stival 

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:40.559
 we had already heard of the festival montreux jazz festival 

00:02:41.339 --> 00:02:44.549
 it is a very beautiful festival it is one of the biggest festivals eneurope 

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:49.590
 for these men who what does it make us to play here bc it's a form of 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.119
 recognition 

00:02:52.119 --> 00:02:53.020
 so I think that 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:55.979
 thanks to the dali precisely that gives me 

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:57.799
 this possibility retirement 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:00.799
 we may not have been right away 

00:03:03.219 --> 00:03:06.109
 first on the first disc produced 

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:09.109
 it's made to you and it does not ring or 

00:03:11.219 --> 00:03:14.119
 it's been a long adventure because we have been very long 

00:03:14.119 --> 00:03:17.919
 we met for his elder in 18 137 30 years we work together 

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:22.179
 and in fact the songs existed since 

00:03:22.179 --> 00:03:24.759
 some luck has long existed other sounds are very 

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:26.409
 recent 

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:29.499
 and as we worked for a very long time in this cellar 

00:03:29.499 --> 00:03:32.639
 of 9 square meters and together we met several times a week 

00:03:35.089 --> 00:03:38.249
 there was a moment it was necessary to take the songs out of the case 

00:03:38.249 --> 00:03:40.799
 and gave this album 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:43.789
 and for the album in fact it's% 

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:45.379
 the story 

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:48.180
 several characters who do not necessarily meet each other who do not know each other 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:51.180
 which are different eras 

00:03:52.779 --> 00:03:55.569
 and not to mention that we recorded live 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:56.819
 so 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:00.509
 in the same room in an attic near the tomb of merlin the enchanter 

00:04:01.779 --> 00:04:04.269
 in France 

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:07.609
 m so a big room of all the others around 

00:04:08.679 --> 00:04:11.769
 the microphone like that here it was very naive as a man 

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:17.489
 and the title uses twitter according to the union have left glossy drawer 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:18.729
 tunisia 

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:20.239
 well lonely 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:22.860
 in fact it's an hour and a postcard that we 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:26.340
 we could not find titles for the album 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:30.540
 arturo a flea market to find a postcard I vote and I do not know the beginning 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:31.830
 of the century cross 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:33.110
 and it was a snow 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:36.479
 the vision of a victory or an old ghost town makes it a 

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:38.410
 cayenne train station in a ghost town 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:39.490
 postbus 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:43.390
 the dakar postcards written for this little essay and June 25th 

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:46.389
 decided to keep and the picture 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:48.699
 and what he had written on the back 

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:50.680
 now we are more likely to 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:51.900
 as at the time of 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.819
 from the time when filming with film 

00:04:54.819 --> 00:04:57.289
 at the time of silver photography 

00:04:57.289 --> 00:05:00.289
 at the time we record with magnetic tapes 

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:06.769
 in fact we do not take care of it at all we have people who are 

00:05:06.769 --> 00:05:09.689
 occupy for us 

00:05:09.689 --> 00:05:12.689
 but unfortunately it's not worthy something that has seen us 

00:05:13.849 --> 00:05:15.849
 especially expensive except 

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:19.039
 we did a treasure hunt 

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:21.699
 so a riddle in celebration 

00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:25.020
 in order to yield to several indices 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:27.900
 is one of the clues is a website 6 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:30.300
 where people have to go 

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:32.990
 and he was at the base of the minimum 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:36.090
 so people there are quite a few people who have already solved it so I think we 

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:38.180
 we had to stop the site 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:42.370
 better but then that on giving way suddenly we can find in Switzerland 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:44.800
 in france in belgium in a lot of countries 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:48.330
 so it's normal so use the allow 

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:50.779
 but social networks 

00:05:50.779 --> 00:05:53.779
 eni is present because it is a glitter handicap 

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:55.490
 the best 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:58.710
 which has three selections of good songs 

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:01.710
 Come see us in concert if it's not tonight to give 

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:05.360
 come see us 

00:06:06.129 --> 00:06:09.169
 because we do not like we love when people come and see us after 

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:13.309
 the concert talked about my talk to us about what you like in music 

00:06:13.309 --> 00:06:15.360
 if you liked the concern 

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:18.729
 that's what counts for us it's this exchange actually 

00:06:20.479 --> 00:06:23.479
 I hope I wish we will return to Switzerland 

00:06:24.059 --> 00:06:26.100
 we also work in charge of space for them 

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:29.700
 jokes concert of the European concerts of tom waits which sees the 

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:32.319
 sign because the places for sale 

00:06:32.319 --> 00:06:32.909
 modolo
