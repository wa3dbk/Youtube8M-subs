sucks you know obviously they knew this
ahead<00:04:30.120> of<00:04:30.180> time<00:04:30.390> because<00:04:30.810> they<00:04:31.170> didn't<00:04:31.410> just

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620 
ahead of time because they didn't just

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:33.590 
ahead of time because they didn't just
put<00:04:31.890> this<00:04:32.040> sneaker<00:04:32.370> out<00:04:32.610> without<00:04:32.940> test

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
wearing it and whatnot but you know this

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.060 
wearing it and whatnot but you know this
sneaker<00:04:36.450> they<00:04:36.630> obviously<00:04:36.810> wanted<00:04:37.620> to<00:04:37.800> have

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:38.070 
sneaker they obviously wanted to have

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:40.160

this<00:04:38.250> crazy<00:04:38.790> effect<00:04:39.330> and<00:04:39.510> the<00:04:39.570> only<00:04:39.690> way<00:04:39.870> to<00:04:39.900> do

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:40.170 
this crazy effect and the only way to do

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:41.690 
this crazy effect and the only way to do
that<00:04:40.350> is<00:04:40.590> for<00:04:40.830> them<00:04:40.950> to<00:04:40.980> carve<00:04:41.340> into<00:04:41.520> the

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:41.700 
that is for them to carve into the

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:44.450 
that is for them to carve into the
leather<00:04:41.910> but<00:04:42.540> with<00:04:42.750> doing<00:04:43.140> that<00:04:43.350> means<00:04:44.070> that

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460 
leather but with doing that means that

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:45.920 
leather but with doing that means that
it's<00:04:44.670> not<00:04:44.850> going<00:04:45.060> to<00:04:45.150> be<00:04:45.300> a<00:04:45.330> long-lasting
