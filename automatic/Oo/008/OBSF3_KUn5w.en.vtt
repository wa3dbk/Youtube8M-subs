00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 imagine you learning in the first 18 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.299
 years of his life that the earth is flat by 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.010
 all elementary and high school you 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.290
 grew up listening to the flat earth 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:13.259
 we live and exercise boring of 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.730
 physical then if you're lucky you'll arrive 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.770
 in college butt 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.050
 they show each other for the first time 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.840
 and say sorry for lying earth on 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:25.350
 Round truth well, unfortunately this is it. 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.630
 what do we do with you probably 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.099
 learned with the objects always attract 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.720
 based on their masses 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.850
 So you probably grew up thinking 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.710
 that light can not be affected by 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.120
 gravity because it has no mass I 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.730
 I thought so 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.309
 now see only the source of gravity is not 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.469
 mass is the energy and the moment what 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.840
 light certainly possesses common matter 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.550
 It is also clear then the light is not only 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.620
 curved when passing through a star 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.660
 planet the black hole but the light also 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.239
 back back to the planet the star 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.370
 black hole to be more accurate well 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.109
 little but very little is not zero 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.670
 anyway the question is that the law 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.649
 nilton of gravity is only 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.870
 approximation good enough for us 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:07.830
 take to the moon but it is not perfect 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.340
 general relativity is best spoken in 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.110
 moon 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.790
 you probably also learned that 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.710
 if a sheep moves and two kilometers 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.060
 per hour compared to yesterday and if three 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.340
 moves two kilometers per hour in 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.720
 same direction in relation to the ground 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.100
 to see this moving to four 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.720
 kilometers per hour in relation to the ground 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.950
 two kilometers an hour but two 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.009
 kilometers per hour equals four 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.710
 miles per hour right and wrong 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.729
 experiments with special relativity 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.950
 have confirmed that speed is not 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.439
 we are simply and therefore sheep 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.880
 is moving at a speed 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:37.400
 infinitesimally less than four 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.900
 kilometers per hour in relation to the ground 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:42.119
 and the formula that correctly predicts this 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:45.119
 deviation of the speed edit is one 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.590
 but two on one but see one times v2 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.479
 about squared 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.399
 It does not change much but again 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.290
 land seems flat is no longer the 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.939
 earth is not flat and if I have distanced myself 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.259
 ten thousand kilometers from my cat and 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.119
 continue walking for another 10,000 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:59.100
 kilometers will not be 20 thousand 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.830
 My cat's miles will only be 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.200
 12 thousand 750 km away 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:07.470
 in fact the further you can be of 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:10.080
 anything on earth is 12,750 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.460
 kilometers the earth distance limits the 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.810
 which we normally know as the 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:14.310
 diameter of the earth 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.810
 the same way when you try 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.520
 add two speeds 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.010
 there is a cosmic speed limit of 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.270
 300 million meters per second that is 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.370
 the speed of light 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.240
 therefore only because the earth looks like a pana 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.680
 our eyes 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.230
 the speeds simply seem to 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.120
 select and the light does not appear to be attracted 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.980
 gravitationally this is an excuse 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:35.810
 to confuse us with our children 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.810
 about the true nature of things
