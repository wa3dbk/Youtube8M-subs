want to deal with first we want to make
sure<00:00:22.830> that<00:00:23.160> our<00:00:23.220> callsign<00:00:23.820> is<00:00:23.850> going<00:00:24.539> to<00:00:24.630> have

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
sure that our callsign is going to have

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.980 
sure that our callsign is going to have
the<00:00:24.900> proper<00:00:25.109> aircraft<00:00:25.680> manufacturer<00:00:26.720> so<00:00:27.720> if

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
the proper aircraft manufacturer so if

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.410 
the proper aircraft manufacturer so if
the<00:00:28.289> callsign<00:00:28.830> is<00:00:28.859> beach<00:00:29.369> one<00:00:29.820> Victor<00:00:30.179> Bravo

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
the callsign is beach one Victor Bravo

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.209

00:04:56.399 --> 00:04:56.409 
so we've actually got two of the

00:04:56.409 --> 00:04:57.959 
so we've actually got two of the
controllers<00:04:57.009> with<00:04:57.370> the<00:04:57.460> same<00:04:57.699> background

00:04:57.959 --> 00:04:57.969 
controllers with the same background

00:04:57.969 --> 00:05:01.230 
controllers with the same background
chatter<00:04:58.800> which<00:04:59.800> is<00:05:00.009> a<00:05:00.039> very<00:05:00.430> realistic<00:05:00.819> and

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:01.240 
chatter which is a very realistic and

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:04.080 
chatter which is a very realistic and
smaller<00:05:01.509> forest<00:05:02.259> a<00:05:02.319> lot<00:05:02.469> of<00:05:02.590> times<00:05:02.879> the<00:05:03.879> same

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:04.090 
smaller forest a lot of times the same

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:05.850 
smaller forest a lot of times the same
frequency<00:05:04.659> will<00:05:04.930> serve<00:05:05.440> more<00:05:05.650> than<00:05:05.710> one

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:05.860 
frequency will serve more than one

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:08.550 
frequency will serve more than one
purpose<00:05:05.979> and<00:05:06.990> then<00:05:07.990> we're<00:05:08.169> done

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:08.560 
purpose and then we're done

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:12.080 
purpose and then we're done
so<00:05:08.710> close<00:05:09.520> this<00:05:09.789> and<00:05:10.199> you're<00:05:11.199> ready<00:05:11.560> to<00:05:11.770> fly

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:12.090 
so close this and you're ready to fly

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:15.690 
so close this and you're ready to fly
thanks<00:05:13.090> for<00:05:13.330> watching
