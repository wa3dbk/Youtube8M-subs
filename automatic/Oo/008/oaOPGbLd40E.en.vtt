your<00:01:16.799> opponent<00:01:17.130> might<00:01:17.310> decide<00:01:17.670> can<00:01:17.850> you<00:01:17.970> fire

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
your opponent might decide can you fire

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.410 
your opponent might decide can you fire
multiple<00:01:18.840> barrels<00:01:19.380> at<00:01:19.530> you<00:01:19.909> if<00:01:20.909> story<00:01:21.150> has<00:01:21.390> a

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
multiple barrels at you if story has a

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.679 
multiple barrels at you if story has a
ham<00:01:21.689> like<00:01:21.930> Jack's<00:01:22.799> or<00:01:23.009> tens<00:01:23.250> you<00:01:24.119> might<00:01:24.299> think

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
ham like Jack's or tens you might think

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.240 
ham like Jack's or tens you might think
it's<00:01:24.840> best<00:01:25.049> if<00:01:25.290> you<00:01:25.500> just<00:01:25.530> flat<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:26.040> flop

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
it's best if you just flat the flop

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.170 
it's best if you just flat the flop
because<00:01:26.490> you<00:01:26.610> could<00:01:26.759> be<00:01:26.850> fighting

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
because you could be fighting

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:34.010 
because you could be fighting
potentially<00:01:27.720> with<00:01:27.840> a<00:01:28.040> seven<00:01:29.040> or<00:01:29.100> an<00:01:29.250> eight<00:01:33.020> and

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
potentially with a seven or an eight and

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.640 
potentially with a seven or an eight and
Plus<00:01:34.409> this<00:01:34.950> bet<00:01:35.369> kind<00:01:35.610> of<00:01:36.200> valios<00:01:37.200> yourself

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
Plus this bet kind of valios yourself

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.359 
Plus this bet kind of valios yourself
where<00:01:37.920> if<00:01:38.880> dario<00:01:39.360> has<00:01:39.750> a<00:01:40.259> hand<00:01:40.829> that<00:01:40.979> dominates

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
where if dario has a hand that dominates

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.630 
where if dario has a hand that dominates
you<00:01:41.490> like<00:01:41.640> kings<00:01:41.909> or<00:01:42.090> aces<00:01:42.860> you<00:01:43.860> suddenly<00:01:44.520> get

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
you like kings or aces you suddenly get

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.109 
you like kings or aces you suddenly get
all<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:44.880> money<00:01:45.000> in<00:01:45.180> on<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.390> flop<00:01:45.630> in<00:01:47.000> yeah<00:01:48.000> we

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
all the money in on the flop in yeah we

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.490 
all the money in on the flop in yeah we
say<00:01:48.270> that<00:01:48.450> dario<00:01:48.750> has<00:01:48.930> a<00:01:49.049> love<00:01:49.259> and<00:01:49.380> a<00:01:49.439> tea

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
say that dario has a love and a tea

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.560 
say that dario has a love and a tea
behind<00:01:49.890> I<00:01:50.159> think<00:01:50.430> is<00:01:50.759> a<00:01:50.790> little<00:01:51.030> bit<00:01:51.180> more<00:01:51.360> than

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
behind I think is a little bit more than

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.160 
behind I think is a little bit more than
like<00:01:52.140> 1,500<00:01:53.040> or<00:01:53.159> so<00:01:53.189> and<00:01:53.759> he's<00:01:54.540> gonna<00:01:54.689> shop<00:01:54.990> so

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
like 1,500 or so and he's gonna shop so

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.300 
like 1,500 or so and he's gonna shop so
that's<00:01:55.320> what<00:01:55.439> he<00:01:55.530> was<00:01:55.680> considering<00:01:56.189> he's

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
that's what he was considering he's

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.350 
that's what he was considering he's
trying<00:01:56.520> to<00:01:56.579> decide<00:01:56.909> you<00:01:56.939> know<00:01:57.119> he's<00:01:57.270> gonna

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
trying to decide you know he's gonna

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.830 
trying to decide you know he's gonna
call<00:01:57.570> 450<00:01:58.200> and<00:01:58.740> leave<00:01:58.979> a<00:01:59.009> thousand<00:01:59.549> behind<00:01:59.909> or

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
call 450 and leave a thousand behind or

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.200 
call 450 and leave a thousand behind or
is<00:02:00.990> he<00:02:01.110> gonna<00:02:01.229> go<00:02:01.439> for<00:02:01.469> it<00:02:01.799> he<00:02:01.860> shoved<00:02:02.640> and

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
is he gonna go for it he shoved and

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.310 
is he gonna go for it he shoved and
James<00:02:04.170> instakill<00:02:04.740> and<00:02:05.070> Daria<00:02:05.670> has<00:02:05.790> a<00:02:05.820> like<00:02:06.390> the

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
James instakill and Daria has a like the

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.949 
James instakill and Daria has a like the
one<00:02:07.500> type<00:02:07.770> of<00:02:07.799> hand<00:02:11.030> it<00:02:12.030> looks<00:02:12.239> like<00:02:12.390> jeans<00:02:12.720> as

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
one type of hand it looks like jeans as

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:13.460 
one type of hand it looks like jeans as
tall

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
tall

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.620 
tall
I<00:02:13.790> think<00:02:14.790> if<00:02:14.850> you<00:02:14.940> end<00:02:15.120> up<00:02:15.210> calling<00:02:15.390> he's

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
I think if you end up calling he's

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.460 
I think if you end up calling he's
basically<00:02:15.900> poss<00:02:16.200> committed<00:02:16.560> himself<00:02:18.470> tardy

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
basically poss committed himself tardy

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.680 
basically poss committed himself tardy
has<00:02:19.620> a<00:02:19.650> one<00:02:20.040> type<00:02:20.370> of<00:02:20.400> hand<00:02:20.790> that<00:02:21.240> when<00:02:21.570> he

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
has a one type of hand that when he

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.890 
has a one type of hand that when he
shoves<00:02:22.290> changed<00:02:22.860> piece<00:02:23.370> and<00:02:23.820> that's<00:02:24.750> the

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
shoves changed piece and that's the

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:30.230 
shoves changed piece and that's the
straight<00:02:25.110> draw<00:02:26.180> but<00:02:27.180> he<00:02:27.740> I<00:02:28.740> think<00:02:29.670> started

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
straight draw but he I think started

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.450 
straight draw but he I think started
chuffing<00:02:30.630> range<00:02:30.810> in<00:02:30.990> general<00:02:31.350> are<00:02:31.620> draws<00:02:32.040> and

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460 
chuffing range in general are draws and

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:35.650 
chuffing range in general are draws and
then<00:02:32.880> hands<00:02:33.540> at<00:02:33.720> BJ's<00:02:33.990> Queen

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
then hands at BJ's Queen

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.560 
then hands at BJ's Queen
so<00:02:36.660> really<00:02:36.960> against<00:02:37.230> artists<00:02:37.560> range<00:02:38.390> James<00:02:39.390> I

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
so really against artists range James I

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:43.190 
so really against artists range James I
think<00:02:39.750> guaranteed<00:02:40.380> to<00:02:40.590> be<00:02:40.740> it<00:02:41.640> has<00:02:41.910> a<00:02:42.200> range

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
think guaranteed to be it has a range

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:54.590 
think guaranteed to be it has a range
overall<00:02:48.890> he<00:02:49.890> does<00:02:50.130> call<00:02:50.460> there<00:02:50.730> we<00:02:50.820> go<00:02:53.600> they're

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
overall he does call there we go they're

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.210 
overall he does call there we go they're
gonna<00:02:54.750> run<00:02:54.990> it<00:02:55.050> twice

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.250 

so<00:02:59.220> Tory<00:02:59.490> needs<00:02:59.820> a<00:02:59.910> five<00:03:00.180> or<00:03:00.210> ten<00:03:00.360> gets<00:03:01.080> there

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
so Tory needs a five or ten gets there

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:06.170 
so Tory needs a five or ten gets there
the<00:03:01.380> first<00:03:01.530> time<00:03:02.540> straight<00:03:04.760> James<00:03:05.760> saying<00:03:05.940> hey

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:13.310 
top two that might be good they haven't

Dario gets a straight twice and he's
