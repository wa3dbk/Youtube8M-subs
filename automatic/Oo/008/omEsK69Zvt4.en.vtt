fight your biggest advantage against

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.300 
fight your biggest advantage against
mother's<00:01:45.180> back<00:01:47.900> we<00:01:48.900> will<00:01:49.020> find<00:01:49.350> it<00:01:49.470> out<00:01:49.560> but<00:01:50.280> I

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
mother's back we will find it out but I

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.330 
mother's back we will find it out but I
think<00:01:50.670> that<00:01:51.410> you<00:01:52.410> cannot<00:01:52.800> take<00:01:53.100> the

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
think that you cannot take the

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.600 
think that you cannot take the
experience<00:01:53.820> out<00:01:54.120> of<00:01:54.800> anything<00:01:55.800> so<00:01:56.220> i<00:01:56.250> think

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
experience out of anything so i think

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.450 
experience out of anything so i think
that<00:01:56.820> experience<00:01:57.570> is<00:01:57.810> is<00:01:58.110> very<00:01:58.380> important<00:01:58.830> but

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
that experience is is very important but

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:00.530 
that experience is is very important but
there's<00:01:59.640> a<00:01:59.670> lot<00:01:59.790> of<00:01:59.820> other<00:02:00.030> things<00:02:00.300> too

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
there's a lot of other things too

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.469 
there's a lot of other things too
because<00:02:01.170> it's<00:02:01.500> a<00:02:01.620> chain<00:02:01.920> of<00:02:02.420> advantages<00:02:03.420> that

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
because it's a chain of advantages that

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.540 
because it's a chain of advantages that
makes<00:02:05.060> makes<00:02:06.060> a<00:02:06.509> champion<00:02:07.020> be<00:02:07.590> a<00:02:07.619> champion<00:02:07.650> and

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
makes makes a champion be a champion and

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.080 
makes makes a champion be a champion and
why<00:02:09.420> did<00:02:10.320> you<00:02:10.350> choose<00:02:10.649> mario's<00:02:11.459> for<00:02:11.790> this

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
why did you choose mario's for this

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.060 
why did you choose mario's for this
fight<00:02:12.320> particularly<00:02:13.320> because<00:02:13.470> of<00:02:13.739> his<00:02:13.890> size

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:14.070 
fight particularly because of his size

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:17.150 
fight particularly because of his size
mainly<00:02:14.489> i<00:02:14.670> think<00:02:15.420> that's<00:02:16.260> what<00:02:16.590> the<00:02:16.770> fans<00:02:16.980> want

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
mainly i think that's what the fans want

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.600 
mainly i think that's what the fans want
to<00:02:17.430> see<00:02:17.459> his<00:02:17.850> undefeated<00:02:18.350> he<00:02:19.350> stole<00:02:19.800> he<00:02:20.550> is

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
to see his undefeated he stole he is
