00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.710 

we<00:01:03.480> chose<00:01:03.809> kind<00:01:04.260> of<00:01:04.379> a<00:01:04.500> neutral<00:01:05.330> color<00:01:06.330> palette

interior the neutrals and the white and
the<00:01:14.520> plaster<00:01:14.970> walls<00:01:15.210> helped<00:01:15.630> to<00:01:15.840> expand<00:01:16.409> the

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
the plaster walls helped to expand the

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.820 
the plaster walls helped to expand the
space<00:01:16.890> and<00:01:17.659> create<00:01:18.659> flow<00:01:19.140> in<00:01:19.500> a<00:01:19.920> smaller<00:01:20.310> home

space and create flow in a smaller home
we<00:01:22.830> tried<00:01:23.189> to<00:01:23.369> put<00:01:23.700> our<00:01:24.240> most<00:01:25.700> money<00:01:26.700> into<00:01:27.299> the

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
we tried to put our most money into the

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.249 
we tried to put our most money into the
broad<00:01:27.720> large<00:01:28.259> surfaces<00:01:29.220> we<00:01:30.119> chose<00:01:30.479> materials

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
broad large surfaces we chose materials

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.859 
broad large surfaces we chose materials
that<00:01:31.680> would<00:01:31.890> show<00:01:32.250> where<00:01:32.610> and<00:01:33.060> get<00:01:33.540> better

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
that would show where and get better

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.450 
that would show where and get better
with<00:01:34.200> time<00:01:34.500> like<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.430> floor<00:01:35.880> is<00:01:36.210> a<00:01:36.350> recycled

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
with time like the floor is a recycled

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.609 
with time like the floor is a recycled
red<00:01:38.460> and<00:01:38.640> white<00:01:38.850> oak<00:01:39.180> from<00:01:40.049> a<00:01:40.170> warehouse<00:01:40.409> in

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
red and white oak from a warehouse in

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.880 
red and white oak from a warehouse in
Georgia<00:01:41.310> and<00:01:42.060> I<00:01:42.150> think<00:01:42.420> it<00:01:42.570> added<00:01:42.869> kind<00:01:43.799> of

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
Georgia and I think it added kind of

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.700 
Georgia and I think it added kind of
instinct<00:01:44.520> character<00:01:45.060> to<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.390> home

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710
