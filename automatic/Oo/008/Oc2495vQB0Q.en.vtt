00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:09.109
 to see how they installed cyanogenmod 4.4 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:09.109
 points 2 kitkat for the motorola hits 

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:13.040
 good then what we're going to need 

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:16.010
 a folder based on the video causes 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:18.230
 that has these three files have the 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:19.720
 gaps and the breast in mont then what 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:23.779
 let's make it is cellular flesh connected 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:26.710
 let's move these two folders to here 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:26.710
 to the root of the cell 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:32.320
 and then we also have this folder that 

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:34.809
 it's as if we're going to be with 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:37.809
 record and in the cellular logical engine 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:39.520
 good to do this to do it the 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:40.780
 pick up and we need to have the drivers 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.120
 of the motorola that we can find 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:46.739
 with the engine that of vice manager that is 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.739
 the official program and motorola 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:51.850
 good if we can see here from happening to 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.580
 our files and what we are going to do 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.410
 Now it 's turning on the cell phone and 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:58.000
 let's learn the fast boot mode but 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:59.590
 then to enter facebook what 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.330
 let's do is have the button 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:03.360
 turn on and the volume down 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:05.860
 pressed to time about three seconds 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:09.160
 and we're going to let them go and we see that 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:12.300
 we were in facebook mode we connect 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:12.300
 the cell phone to the computer 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:20.460
 and we are going to open this file that 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:24.260
 call install recovery 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:26.549
 list and we see that you already installed the recovery 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:29.310
 good once you have finished installing 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:31.890
 the recovery let's go into it 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:35.250
 then we are going to press the button 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:38.840
 lower the volume and the up and see 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.840
 that already went into recovery mode 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:45.360
 well then before installing the rom 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:48.780
 let's go to white datafactory reset 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.520
 let's turn on and this eliminates us 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.770
 all the applications that we have in 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.650
 the cell phone is therefore necessary to launch 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:02:00.330
 a rom 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:02:02.580
 and now let's copy the cache we give 10 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.920
 and ready now we are going to install 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:08.880
 Here we navigate with the download and upload 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:11.970
 the volume we are going to turn on we are another 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:14.130
 once and we enter folder 0 if we see 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.290
 is already selected view now let's 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:19.350
 look for the rom that we just installed 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.650
 to go to the phone that is already 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:24.019
 not on a motorcycle 11 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:28.700
 we select them with turn on yes 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:30.860
 and just start to install the rom in the 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.989
 good cell phone after this we're going to 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.909
 have to install the gaps that are the 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:37.689
 google apps or where is the place 

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:37.689
 thor youtube 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:47.069
 well once it's over we're going 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:49.560
 now to look for the gaps like the 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:52.590
 thief want ojÃ©n and we're going to light 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:57.209
 yes and again turn on I 'm not going to 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.209
 consider the google apps 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:06.189
 and ready with this we have the rom of 

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:10.330
 cyanogenmod installed and now we are going to 

00:03:06.189 --> 00:03:13.210
 give between woods and senate and goes 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:15.900
 to restart the cell phone mode with the 

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:15.900
 rom installed 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:20.069
 good at the beginning yes but now as 

00:03:17.969 --> 00:03:24.290
 about two minutes without starting because the 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:24.290
 first time the rom was installed 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:36.120
 good as we can see here already finished 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:37.409
 of loading the room and you can take out only 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.920
 what remains is to make the configurations 

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:42.900
 normal then good if for some 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:46.139
 reason they are left loading and loading 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:48.060
 at the beginning since he does not answer them 

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:50.370
 when the little ball is spinning it's because 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:53.280
 will be lola the chip that was not site 2 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:55.889
 which is one for the USA and another global 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:58.469
 so it does not work with one 

00:03:55.889 --> 00:04:00.540
 you can try the other good then 

00:03:58.469 --> 00:04:02.310
 this is the rom of cyanogenmod for the 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:04.109
 engine or people if you do have 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:06.269
 problems when installing it because I can 

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:08.579
 comment and I can answer them if 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:10.650
 I know how to solve the problem and 

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:12.329
