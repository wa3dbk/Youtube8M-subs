00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.859 

I<00:01:45.950> really<00:01:46.950> like<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.729> tremolo<00:01:47.969> I'm<00:01:48.570> used

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
I really like the the tremolo I'm used

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.569 
I really like the the tremolo I'm used
to<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.110> style<00:01:49.320> tremolo<00:01:50.090> and<00:01:51.320> it's<00:01:52.320> it<00:01:53.070> matches

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
to the style tremolo and it's it matches

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.580 
to the style tremolo and it's it matches
everything<00:01:53.939> I've<00:01:54.090> seen<00:01:54.270> before<00:01:54.719> as<00:01:55.229> far<00:01:55.469> as

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
everything I've seen before as far as

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.440 
everything I've seen before as far as
the<00:01:55.710> weight<00:01:55.920> of<00:01:56.219> it<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.549> castings<00:01:57.060> all<00:01:57.270> look

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
the weight of it the castings all look

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.899 
the weight of it the castings all look
good<00:01:57.659> it's<00:01:57.899> nice<00:01:58.049> and<00:01:58.320> solid<00:01:58.909> humbucker

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
good it's nice and solid humbucker

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.669 
good it's nice and solid humbucker
pickups<00:02:00.270> were<00:02:00.569> invented<00:02:00.929> in<00:02:00.990> the<00:02:01.049> late<00:02:01.229> 50s

00:02:01.669 --> 00:02:01.679 
pickups were invented in the late 50s

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:04.910 
pickups were invented in the late 50s
very<00:02:02.490> much<00:02:02.700> still<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.179> heyday<00:02:03.539> of<00:02:03.929> rockabilly

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
very much still the heyday of rockabilly

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:05.990 
very much still the heyday of rockabilly
and<00:02:05.220> that<00:02:05.610> era

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
and that era

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.180 
and that era
I<00:02:06.179> think<00:02:06.360> these<00:02:06.479> sound<00:02:06.780> fine<00:02:07.020> either<00:02:07.380> they

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
I think these sound fine either they

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.680 
I think these sound fine either they
sound<00:02:08.459> good<00:02:08.610> they're<00:02:09.209> actually<00:02:09.479> pretty

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
sound good they're actually pretty

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.229 
sound good they're actually pretty
bright<00:02:09.869> for<00:02:09.989> humbucker<00:02:10.709> so<00:02:11.069> I<00:02:11.549> think<00:02:12.060> they

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
bright for humbucker so I think they

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:18.860 
bright for humbucker so I think they
work<00:02:12.390> alright

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.380 

I<00:02:18.959> think<00:02:19.739> this<00:02:19.920> is<00:02:20.069> a<00:02:20.099> really<00:02:20.489> solid<00:02:20.700> platform

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
I think this is a really solid platform

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.080 
I think this is a really solid platform
for<00:02:21.659> anybody<00:02:22.110> who's<00:02:22.470> looking<00:02:22.860> to<00:02:22.890> get<00:02:23.069> into<00:02:23.129> a

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
for anybody who's looking to get into a

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.970 
for anybody who's looking to get into a
hollow<00:02:24.659> body<00:02:24.900> guitar<00:02:25.049> if<00:02:25.470> you've<00:02:25.590> never<00:02:25.739> had

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
hollow body guitar if you've never had

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.220 
hollow body guitar if you've never had
one<00:02:26.159> before<00:02:26.280> highly<00:02:27.239> recommend<00:02:27.720> trying<00:02:27.930> one

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
one before highly recommend trying one

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.949 
one before highly recommend trying one
out<00:02:28.409> I<00:02:29.250> think<00:02:30.000> there<00:02:30.120> are<00:02:30.180> a<00:02:30.209> lot<00:02:30.239> of<00:02:30.330> fun

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
out I think there are a lot of fun

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.380 
out I think there are a lot of fun
I<00:02:30.989> think<00:02:31.500> people<00:02:32.459> sometimes<00:02:32.580> shy<00:02:33.090> away<00:02:33.239> from

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
I think people sometimes shy away from

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:34.670 
I think people sometimes shy away from
them<00:02:33.720> because<00:02:33.900> they<00:02:34.080> think<00:02:34.200> it's<00:02:34.409> a<00:02:34.500> little

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
them because they think it's a little

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.490 
them because they think it's a little
bit<00:02:34.799> too<00:02:35.329> old-fashioned<00:02:36.329> in<00:02:36.450> a<00:02:36.540> sense<00:02:36.810> or<00:02:37.140> it's

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
bit too old-fashioned in a sense or it's

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.170 
bit too old-fashioned in a sense or it's
too<00:02:37.739> much<00:02:37.890> of<00:02:37.920> an<00:02:38.099> acoustic<00:02:38.549> guitar<00:02:38.579> it's<00:02:39.060> not

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
too much of an acoustic guitar it's not

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.569 
too much of an acoustic guitar it's not
a<00:02:39.209> real<00:02:39.480> rocking<00:02:39.840> guitar<00:02:40.280> you<00:02:41.280> can<00:02:41.430> pretty

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:41.579 
a real rocking guitar you can pretty

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:48.350 
a real rocking guitar you can pretty
much<00:02:41.670> rock<00:02:41.970> out<00:02:42.180> on<00:02:42.450> a<00:02:42.540> hollow<00:02:42.900> body<00:02:43.079> any<00:02:43.560> time

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.020 

it's<00:02:49.360> gonna<00:02:49.480> be<00:02:49.690> a<00:02:50.200> lot<00:02:50.440> more<00:02:50.710> alive<00:02:51.430> than<00:02:51.880> a

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
it's gonna be a lot more alive than a
