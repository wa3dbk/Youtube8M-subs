00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:10.740
 Yes Leon channel is a mini plastic train coalesced dx hyper train emperor's 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:16.790
 First introduced Hyper Train Terminal Mode This time the remaining two types of train conditions 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:16.790
 Review Hyper Train Teikoku of Hyper Train and Robot State 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:28.550
 Transform from terminal mode to hyper lesser 

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:29.510
 The transformation process is slightly different from deluxe pan, first it splits the parts here 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:37.220
 Take 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:39.000
 If you fold the arm and then you'll get a protrusion here and that's part of it 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:44.930
 Here the hollow here 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:50.540
 Plug it in and turn it over and over 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:52.010
 Kansai hyper lesser mode Yes Yes The procedure is slightly different 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:57.410
 Has completed 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:01:04.250
 The deformation is from the hand Yes the whole is like this 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:04.920
 It is also the same as the Deluxe Edition silhouette after deformation to the other real upper side and the lower side 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.080
 Properly car 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:14.020
 I'm able to run around because I am 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:17.170
 You can also set the Deluxe Saturday Hyper Lesser in this hole and store it in 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:20.979
 It will be closed down until quite a fine place 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:24.460
 It is a seal , but the plastic part of the original base is 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:27.980
 It 's exactly like the color of the deluxe version, so it 's really complete 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:30.540
 This kind of fine modeling part compared to the high deluxe version 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:37.020
 It is perfect to the minute 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:39.060
 In the end, it's transformed into robot mode, which is also very easy, and first of all, take off the hyper train and turn it 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:44.909
 Change and stand 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:49.499
 Insert here the hole to defeat hyper train to the top 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:55.920
 It seems to be a trunk hyper train body Yes deformation saying it is Lax Saturday 

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:59.219
 Overall it will be robot mode If you change the orientation if there is such a pretty volume 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:04.900
 I feel like Lescher is standing 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:09.340
 Just gimmicks different from the relaxed version How joints are 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:16.390
 I'm going up, it's quite different from this alone 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:17.590
 You can reproduce the scene from issues a missile from a finger is the Te hyper train this is 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:24.890
 Quite comfortable 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:28.920
 However, I would like to divide the hips and legs so that the base rotates around the rest. 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:35.640
 Well there is no such gimmick 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:39.720
 However, I think that it is good to move even a little if I think so because Deluxe was superbly upright 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:45.120
 Yes you can as compared with the other train of the same mini plastic series 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:45.630
 The terminal state was quite huge, but it is so big compared to robot towns 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.910
 is not it 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:52.270
 But three-step deformation is completely reproduced and grass 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:55.500
 Phase unchanged Minipura Ow from works of the two joint parts 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:55.500
 It is terribly can say 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:12.209
 anmelden 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:30.920
 Introduce b plastic train wants to ex hyper train Emperor like by entering Shimasa 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:36.080
 In the introduced the 3 mode deformable hyper 0 range alone so far in the next video 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:39.300
 Miura more than to express rainbow review using only over plastic series of 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:41.870
 The train was an introduction of the dx fiper train emperor 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.870
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:54.380
 When Yes Subscribe latest videos will be easier to see
