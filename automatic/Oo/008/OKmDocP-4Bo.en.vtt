00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.010 
video this is where the hole was on this

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.260 
video this is where the hole was on this
connection<00:00:47.010> right<00:00:47.129> before<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.640> plenum<00:00:48.059> and

it was sucking in air and getting to
leave<00:00:50.940> fuel<00:00:51.360> mixture<00:00:51.780> now<00:00:51.930> you<00:00:51.989> could<00:00:52.230> look

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
leave fuel mixture now you could look

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.410 
leave fuel mixture now you could look
over<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:52.829> years<00:00:53.129> you<00:00:53.850> don't<00:00:53.969> have<00:00:54.149> to<00:00:54.270> be<00:00:54.390> a

much<00:02:26.390> like<00:02:27.390> good<00:02:27.630> friends<00:02:27.959> down<00:02:28.140> there<00:02:28.350> give

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
much like good friends down there give

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.760 
much like good friends down there give
me<00:02:28.590> a<00:02:28.709> little<00:02:29.510> break<00:02:30.510> on<00:02:30.750> the<00:02:30.870> play<00:02:31.110> so<00:02:31.170> it's

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
me a little break on the play so it's

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:36.380 
me a little break on the play so it's
seventeen<00:02:32.310> and<00:02:32.580> seven<00:02:34.640> so<00:02:35.640> less<00:02:35.940> than<00:02:35.970> thirty

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
seventeen and seven so less than thirty

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.250 
seventeen and seven so less than thirty
bucks<00:02:36.980> we<00:02:37.980> get<00:02:38.160> to<00:02:38.310> fix<00:02:38.580> it<00:02:38.820> now<00:02:39.090> it<00:02:39.780> connects

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
bucks we get to fix it now it connects

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.770 
bucks we get to fix it now it connects
into<00:02:40.680> the<00:02:40.950> plant<00:02:41.220> I'm<00:02:41.340> over<00:02:41.670> here<00:02:42.030> so<00:02:42.660> we

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
into the plant I'm over here so we

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.960 
into the plant I'm over here so we
should<00:02:42.989> get<00:02:43.110> a<00:02:43.170> nice<00:02:43.410> tight<00:02:43.769> fit<00:02:43.800> in<00:02:44.430> this<00:02:44.760> new

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
should get a nice tight fit in this new

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.320 
should get a nice tight fit in this new
grommet<00:02:45.480> so<00:02:45.660> let<00:02:45.810> me<00:02:45.900> put<00:02:46.080> that<00:02:46.200> in<00:02:46.350> position

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330 
grommet so let me put that in position

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.970 
grommet so let me put that in position
you<00:02:48.330> know<00:02:48.450> in<00:02:48.630> all<00:02:48.780> honesty<00:02:48.810> this<00:02:49.440> is<00:02:49.590> probably

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
you know in all honesty this is probably

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.100 
you know in all honesty this is probably
a<00:02:50.070> repair<00:02:50.610> where<00:02:50.850> you<00:02:51.000> don't<00:02:51.480> really<00:02:51.600> have<00:02:51.930> to

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
a repair where you don't really have to

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.259 
a repair where you don't really have to
know<00:02:52.170> all<00:02:52.530> that<00:02:52.560> much<00:02:53.040> chemical<00:02:53.819> to<00:02:53.910> figure

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
know all that much chemical to figure

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:57.020 
know all that much chemical to figure
out<00:02:54.420> because<00:02:54.800> it's<00:02:55.800> basically<00:02:56.250> just<00:02:56.370> popping

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
out because it's basically just popping

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.509 
out because it's basically just popping
in<00:02:57.150> on<00:02:57.269> both<00:02:57.480> places<00:02:58.040> now<00:02:59.040> this<00:02:59.310> should

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
in on both places now this should

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:01.750 
in on both places now this should
probably<00:02:59.790> fit<00:03:00.060> a<00:03:00.120> whole<00:03:00.239> bunch<00:03:00.540> of<00:03:00.630> tiger<00:03:00.870> I

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
probably fit a whole bunch of tiger I

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.920 
probably fit a whole bunch of tiger I
could<00:03:02.760> just<00:03:02.910> filled<00:03:03.120> spiders<00:03:03.510> more<00:03:03.720> than

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
could just filled spiders more than

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:09.140 
could just filled spiders more than
already<00:03:04.700> and<00:03:05.700> babies<00:03:06.450> in<00:03:06.600> there<00:03:06.840> now<00:03:07.910> you<00:03:08.910> just

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
already and babies in there now you just

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.229 
already and babies in there now you just
pulled<00:03:09.420> it<00:03:09.540> back<00:03:09.690> out<00:03:10.850> yeah

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
pulled it back out yeah

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:15.229 
pulled it back out yeah
it's<00:03:12.450> most<00:03:12.690> secure<00:03:13.170> for<00:03:13.440> sure<00:03:13.980> so<00:03:14.970> now<00:03:15.180> that

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
it's most secure for sure so now that

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:18.350 
it's most secure for sure so now that
should<00:03:15.690> be<00:03:15.720> a<00:03:15.840> nice<00:03:16.140> tight<00:03:16.530> connection<00:03:16.970> no<00:03:17.970> air

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
should be a nice tight connection no air

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.949 
should be a nice tight connection no air
shouldn't<00:03:18.810> leak<00:03:18.900> past<00:03:19.200> it<00:03:20.480> you<00:03:21.480> got<00:03:21.630> a<00:03:21.660> trip

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
shouldn't leak past it you got a trip

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:23.780 
shouldn't leak past it you got a trip
out<00:03:22.140> of<00:03:22.170> town<00:03:22.320> clean<00:03:22.890> so<00:03:23.250> we<00:03:23.400> want<00:03:23.549> to<00:03:23.610> make

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
out of town clean so we want to make

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:28.910 
out of town clean so we want to make
sure<00:03:24.980> everything<00:03:25.980> is<00:03:26.010> going<00:03:26.489> to<00:03:26.610> be<00:03:26.730> cool<00:03:27.920> it

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
sure everything is going to be cool it

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:34.599

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:44.210 
this said 95 my advice would be to check
that<00:03:41.760> thing<00:03:42.030> before<00:03:42.239> it<00:03:42.420> starts<00:03:42.810> to<00:03:42.959> go<00:03:43.220> now

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:45.229 
that thing before it starts to go now
you<00:03:44.250> got<00:03:44.489> to<00:03:44.579> remember<00:03:44.820> that's<00:03:45.060> a

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
you got to remember that's a

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:47.780 
you got to remember that's a
high-pressure<00:03:45.780> hose<00:03:46.019> and<00:03:46.560> a<00:03:46.799> fuel<00:03:47.160> line<00:03:47.370> was

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
high-pressure hose and a fuel line was

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.819 
high-pressure hose and a fuel line was
only<00:03:48.060> a<00:03:48.090> temporary<00:03:48.420> fix<00:03:49.079> you<00:03:49.290> know<00:03:49.350> you<00:03:49.500> want

even though this is a 95 Town Car it it

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:14.780 
even though this is a 95 Town Car it it
still<00:04:13.109> has<00:04:13.140> the<00:04:13.590> connections<00:04:14.159> so<00:04:14.340> it<00:04:14.459> must<00:04:14.670> be

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
still has the connections so it must be

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:16.039 
still has the connections so it must be
a<00:04:14.819> late-model

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
a late-model

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:21.800 
a late-model
