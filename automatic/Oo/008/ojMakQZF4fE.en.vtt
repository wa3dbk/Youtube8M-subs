00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:36.530

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.150

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
creatures were coming from and perhaps

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.760 
creatures were coming from and perhaps
seal<00:01:43.450> this<00:01:43.750> door<00:01:45.840> would<00:01:46.840> he<00:01:47.050> even<00:01:47.200> be<00:01:47.470> caught

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.070 
inside he didn't know but he needed to

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.720 
inside he didn't know but he needed to
stop<00:01:51.400> the<00:01:51.640> flow<00:01:52.000> of<00:01:52.030> evil<00:01:52.570> into<00:01:53.020> his<00:01:53.260> world<00:01:53.730> at

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:54.730 
stop the flow of evil into his world at

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:58.860

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
knowledge is strong if he knows enough

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.200

of<00:02:16.120> what<00:02:16.360> to<00:02:16.510> do<00:02:17.220> perhaps<00:02:18.220> he<00:02:18.430> can<00:02:18.580> seal<00:02:19.000> this

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:19.210 
of what to do perhaps he can seal this

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:28.740 
of what to do perhaps he can seal this
doorway<00:02:22.980> okay<00:02:26.970> this<00:02:27.970> looks<00:02:28.210> like<00:02:28.360> a<00:02:28.420> dangerous

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
doorway okay this looks like a dangerous

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:35.120 
doorway okay this looks like a dangerous
one<00:02:29.260> so<00:02:31.140> why<00:02:32.140> don't<00:02:32.350> we<00:02:32.440> use<00:02:34.020> the<00:02:35.020> information

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
one so why don't we use the information

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:40.860 
one so why don't we use the information
from<00:02:36.130> the<00:02:37.090> book<00:02:37.720> of<00:02:37.870> nameless<00:02:38.140> cults<00:02:39.870> perhaps

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
from the book of nameless cults perhaps

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.770 
from the book of nameless cults perhaps
it<00:02:41.110> can<00:02:41.230> give<00:02:41.440> Harvey<00:02:42.060> a<00:02:43.060> lead<00:02:43.720> on<00:02:44.050> how<00:02:45.040> best<00:02:45.340> to

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
it can give Harvey a lead on how best to

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.800
