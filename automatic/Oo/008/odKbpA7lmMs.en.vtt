00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.580
 how to strengthen embroidery flizelinom start 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.849
 We will understand what is flizelin 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.349
 this is such a material most often 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.590
 he happens to be no canna 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.660
 phaeton of different density for example here 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.430
 here I have it thin enough 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.970
 can use more dense 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.369
 material 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.010
 looking for what purpose you need it 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.930
 we need to strengthen 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.300
 embroidery from the wrong side in order 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.640
 to make it more plump here 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.759
 Here, for example, I have a new to new 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.829
 so she is quite like that 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:37.620
 tight hard sometimes canva 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:40.290
 which is more subtle and indeed such 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.440
 it is desirable to strengthen the canvas too 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:46.070
 at the same time you will do more 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:49.309
 high-quality embroidery that is all here 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:52.289
 errors will miller less noticeable and 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:54.329
 the canvas itself will be less transparent and 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:59.039
 accordingly because the back will have 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:01.469
 us flizelin here flizelin here it is usually 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:04.530
 here it happens here such here it happens 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.689
 White flowers are just black here here 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.420
 written even here are the signs as needed 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:12.060
 take care of him as we strengthen 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:15.540
 embroidery for a start we need to carve out 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.759
 a piece of non-woven fabric of the right size here 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.549
 here I have already cut out such 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:23.130
 square 

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:25.290
 embroidery put the wrong side up 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.619
 we should already have it 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.119
 about smoother at the level of ymca to be because 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.460
 otherwise if you will 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:35.280
 iron the embroidery along with or green then 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:38.100
 may be generally very ugly 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.770
 folds get so we take a smooth 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:44.000
 already prepared embroidery take a piece 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:46.470
 Flizelina and here the main thing we have 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.619
 stick it with the right side i.e. 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:53.670
 him we need to touch the side where 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:56.490
 is the glue we need it a little bit 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:59.759
 I feel so pimply here 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.649
 here it is this country we have this glue 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:04.409
 by the side 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:06.540
 we apply flizelin to embroidery that is 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.970
 the side without glue should now have 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.800
 us upstairs 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:12.800
 neatly application combined msi 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.630
 edge 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:19.290
 very smoothly we should have everything 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:24.120
 smooth and iron on the middle 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:27.750
 temperature starting from the edges neatly 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:32.040
 glue flizelin here with this 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:35.390
 it is important that we get it smooth 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:37.770
 straightened without folds 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:41.160
 maybe it will be different with us 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:42.450
 see on the front side if even 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.270
 it turns out wrong 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:48.060
 yet you are not well glued 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:50.870
 flizelin can be tacked off and fixed 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:54.209
 position well so slowly 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:57.170
 little by little we glue it 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:57.170
 flizelin to embroidery 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:05.400
 this way we do it 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:08.040
 the same as during ironing 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.870
 embroidery should be used under the soft 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.840
 the substrate so that it does not have 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:15.120
 spoiled did not become flat here and become 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.769
 us embroidery is more dense here 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.330
 I have a thin fleece about if you 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:21.890
 it will be even denser, respectively 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:21.890
 embroidery will be more dense
