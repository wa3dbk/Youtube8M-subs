00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:19.070 
run braided line with it

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.170 
run braided line with it
we'll<00:00:20.070> save<00:00:20.279> that<00:00:20.310> for<00:00:20.490> another<00:00:20.670> generation

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
we'll save that for another generation

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.700 
we'll save that for another generation
but<00:00:21.480> we<00:00:21.539> run<00:00:21.689> a<00:00:21.750> braided<00:00:22.080> line<00:00:22.260> but<00:00:22.439> what<00:00:22.650> I

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
but we run a braided line but what I

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.740 
but we run a braided line but what I
want<00:00:22.859> to<00:00:22.920> do<00:00:23.039> here<00:00:23.279> is<00:00:23.310> show<00:00:23.430> you<00:00:23.699> how<00:00:24.539> we're

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
done is I take a basic swivel guys right

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.670 
done is I take a basic swivel guys right
here<00:00:33.390> and<00:00:33.630> I<00:00:33.690> talked<00:00:34.260> a<00:00:34.350> little<00:00:34.410> bit<00:00:34.559> about

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
here and I talked a little bit about

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.350 
here and I talked a little bit about
that<00:00:34.950> here<00:00:35.070> in<00:00:35.130> a<00:00:35.160> second<00:00:35.520> but<00:00:35.640> I<00:00:35.969> thread<00:00:36.239> the

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
that here in a second but I thread the

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.000 
that here in a second but I thread the
basic<00:00:36.719> swivel<00:00:37.050> on<00:00:37.200> right<00:00:37.590> like<00:00:37.739> that

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
basic swivel on right like that

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.220 
basic swivel on right like that
then<00:00:38.760> I<00:00:38.850> throw<00:00:39.090> on<00:00:39.120> a<00:00:39.239> small<00:00:39.660> bead<00:00:39.899> six

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
then I throw on a small bead six

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.940 
then I throw on a small bead six
millimeter<00:00:40.620> bead<00:00:40.890> and<00:00:41.129> then<00:00:41.700> I<00:00:41.850> tie<00:00:42.090> on<00:00:42.329> a<00:00:42.950> good

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
millimeter bead and then I tie on a good

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.420 
millimeter bead and then I tie on a good
heavy<00:00:44.190> cross<00:00:44.550> lock<00:00:44.879> snap<00:00:45.600> right<00:00:45.899> here<00:00:46.430> now

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
heavy cross lock snap right here now

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.940 
heavy cross lock snap right here now
what<00:00:47.640> this<00:00:47.789> does<00:00:48.020> is<00:00:49.020> this<00:00:49.260> bead<00:00:49.500> is<00:00:49.530> on<00:00:49.800> here

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
what this does is this bead is on here

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.369 
what this does is this bead is on here
just<00:00:50.070> to<00:00:50.190> protect<00:00:50.550> that<00:00:50.670> knot<00:00:50.940> and<00:00:51.379> what

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
just to protect that knot and what

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.100 
just to protect that knot and what
happens<00:00:52.829> with<00:00:53.399> this<00:00:53.520> braided<00:00:53.940> line<00:00:54.149> you<00:00:54.930> can

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
happens with this braided line you can

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.779 
happens with this braided line you can
run<00:00:55.260> this<00:00:55.410> straight<00:00:55.710> cross<00:00:55.980> lock<00:00:56.280> stamp<00:00:56.579> right

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
run this straight cross lock stamp right

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.220 
run this straight cross lock stamp right
here<00:00:57.059> now<00:00:57.629> if<00:00:57.870> you<00:00:57.989> were<00:00:58.079> running

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
here now if you were running

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.930 
here now if you were running
monofilament<00:00:58.770> you'd<00:00:59.100> probably<00:00:59.340> want<00:00:59.640> to<00:00:59.699> run

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
monofilament you'd probably want to run

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.080 
monofilament you'd probably want to run
across<00:01:00.210> lock<00:01:00.780> with<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.260> barrel<00:01:01.530> swivel

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:02.090 
across lock with the barrel swivel

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:03.889 
across lock with the barrel swivel
reason<00:01:03.090> being<00:01:03.239> is<00:01:03.449> that<00:01:03.480> you're<00:01:03.660> gonna<00:01:03.750> get

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
reason being is that you're gonna get

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.690 
reason being is that you're gonna get
some<00:01:04.019> wine<00:01:04.229> twist<00:01:04.619> with<00:01:04.830> it<00:01:05.040> with<00:01:05.519> this

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
some wine twist with it with this

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.010 
some wine twist with it with this
braided<00:01:05.939> line<00:01:06.210> I<00:01:06.390> don't<00:01:06.570> have<00:01:06.659> to<00:01:06.750> worry<00:01:06.900> about

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
braided line I don't have to worry about

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.719 
braided line I don't have to worry about
line<00:01:07.290> twists<00:01:07.619> you<00:01:07.830> can<00:01:07.950> twist<00:01:08.130> it<00:01:08.310> up<00:01:08.430> and<00:01:08.640> it's

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
line twists you can twist it up and it's

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.460 
line twists you can twist it up and it's
not<00:01:08.880> gonna<00:01:09.030> hurt<00:01:09.270> a<00:01:09.390> thing<00:01:09.600> especially<00:01:10.110> for

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
not gonna hurt a thing especially for

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:11.690 
not gonna hurt a thing especially for
using<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.740> spinning<00:01:11.040> reel<00:01:11.159> with<00:01:11.280> level<00:01:11.580> one

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
using the spinning reel with level one

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:12.890 
using the spinning reel with level one
you<00:01:11.850> don't<00:01:11.909> really<00:01:12.000> have<00:01:12.180> to<00:01:12.299> worry<00:01:12.479> about<00:01:12.630> it

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
you don't really have to worry about it

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.770 
you don't really have to worry about it
but<00:01:13.590> right<00:01:13.740> here<00:01:13.799> I've<00:01:14.070> tied<00:01:14.310> direct<00:01:14.670> now<00:01:15.540> what

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
but right here I've tied direct now what

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.770 
but right here I've tied direct now what
we're<00:01:15.930> gonna<00:01:15.990> do<00:01:16.290> on<00:01:16.560> this<00:01:16.890> end<00:01:17.070> right<00:01:17.220> here<00:01:17.780> is

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
we're gonna do on this end right here is

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.570 
we're gonna do on this end right here is
where<00:01:19.049> my<00:01:19.200> drift<00:01:19.439> rig<00:01:19.650> is<00:01:19.770> gonna<00:01:19.950> go<00:01:20.130> then<00:01:20.460> I've

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
where my drift rig is gonna go then I've

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.160 
where my drift rig is gonna go then I've
got<00:01:20.759> this<00:01:20.880> tied<00:01:21.150> up<00:01:21.330> short<00:01:21.600> here<00:01:21.659> so<00:01:21.930> we<00:01:22.049> can

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
got this tied up short here so we can

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.050 
got this tied up short here so we can
keep<00:01:22.259> it<00:01:22.409> all<00:01:22.530> in<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.680> frame<00:01:22.950> but<00:01:23.700> here's<00:01:23.880> my

keep it all in the frame but here's my

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.670 
keep it all in the frame but here's my
side<00:01:24.330> drift<00:01:24.600> and<00:01:24.750> rig<00:01:24.900> right<00:01:25.140> here<00:01:25.170> whether<00:01:25.590> I

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
side drift and rig right here whether I

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.590 
side drift and rig right here whether I
put<00:01:25.890> eggs<00:01:26.100> yarn<00:01:26.490> shrimp<00:01:26.880> whatever<00:01:27.180> I<00:01:27.240> put<00:01:27.450> on

here<00:01:27.780> here's<00:01:28.320> my<00:01:28.470> side<00:01:28.710> drift<00:01:29.009> rig<00:01:29.220> when<00:01:29.880> i<00:01:29.909> pre

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
here here's my side drift rig when i pre

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.929 
here here's my side drift rig when i pre
tie<00:01:30.390> all<00:01:30.659> these<00:01:30.930> up<00:01:31.229> I<00:01:31.560> tie<00:01:32.070> Sergent<00:01:32.549> loops<00:01:32.700> in

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
tie all these up I tie Sergent loops in

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.969 
tie all these up I tie Sergent loops in
the<00:01:33.030> end<00:01:33.150> of<00:01:33.299> them<00:01:33.390> right<00:01:33.570> here<00:01:33.710> then<00:01:34.710> all<00:01:34.829> I<00:01:34.860> do
