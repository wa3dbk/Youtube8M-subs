this<00:02:38.910> is<00:02:39.030> a<00:02:39.060> rule<00:02:39.360> and<00:02:39.720> like<00:02:40.530> they're<00:02:40.680> actually

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
this is a rule and like they're actually

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.830 
this is a rule and like they're actually
doing<00:02:41.250> this<00:02:41.519> then<00:02:41.790> they<00:02:42.000> should<00:02:42.269> like<00:02:42.420> tell<00:02:42.780> us

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
doing this then they should like tell us

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.110 
doing this then they should like tell us
because<00:02:43.680> that's<00:02:44.099> actually<00:02:44.430> like<00:02:44.519> interesting

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
because that's actually like interesting

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.059 
because that's actually like interesting
you<00:02:45.239> could<00:02:45.360> come<00:02:45.599> up<00:02:45.780> and<00:02:45.900> have<00:02:46.500> the<00:02:46.680> people

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.069 
you could come up and have the people

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:49.220 
you could come up and have the people
you<00:02:47.100> know<00:02:47.370> go<00:02:48.120> for<00:02:48.330> that<00:02:48.450> one<00:02:48.690> save<00:02:48.959> and<00:02:49.140> then

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
you know go for that one save and then

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.259 
you know go for that one save and then
you<00:02:49.290> have<00:02:49.440> in<00:02:49.560> your<00:02:49.680> head<00:02:49.890> you<00:02:50.069> know<00:02:50.220> okay<00:02:51.120> if

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
you have in your head you know okay if

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:52.250 
you have in your head you know okay if
he<00:02:51.360> does<00:02:51.480> another<00:02:51.690> one<00:02:51.840> he's<00:02:52.019> disqualified

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
he does another one he's disqualified

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:53.930 
he does another one he's disqualified
let<00:02:52.799> it's<00:02:52.920> something<00:02:53.130> to<00:02:53.190> keep<00:02:53.370> out<00:02:53.549> for<00:02:53.760> I'm

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
let it's something to keep out for I'm

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.190 
let it's something to keep out for I'm
not<00:02:54.060> sure<00:02:54.239> why<00:02:54.420> they<00:02:54.510> haven't<00:02:54.810> told<00:02:54.930> us<00:02:55.080> that

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
not sure why they haven't told us that

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:55.880 
not sure why they haven't told us that
that's<00:02:55.350> weird

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
that's weird

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.250 
that's weird
I<00:02:55.920> actually<00:02:56.580> haven't<00:02:56.940> even<00:02:57.180> like<00:02:57.420> now<00:02:58.019> that<00:02:58.230> I

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
I actually haven't even like now that I

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:59.780 
I actually haven't even like now that I
know<00:02:58.380> this<00:02:58.799> you<00:02:59.040> know<00:02:59.130> I<00:02:59.190> haven't<00:02:59.430> known<00:02:59.670> this

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
know this you know I haven't known this

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.160 
know this you know I haven't known this
before<00:02:59.910> but<00:03:00.239> now<00:03:00.420> that<00:03:00.450> I<00:03:00.630> know<00:03:00.690> this<00:03:00.900> I<00:03:01.019> might

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
before but now that I know this I might

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:02.750 
before but now that I know this I might
look<00:03:01.350> out<00:03:01.590> for<00:03:01.799> and<00:03:01.950> see<00:03:02.100> if<00:03:02.160> the<00:03:02.250> rule<00:03:02.459> still

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
look out for and see if the rule still

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:03.590 
look out for and see if the rule still
applies

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
applies

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.080 
applies
so<00:03:04.170> next<00:03:04.350> tag-team<00:03:04.799> match<00:03:04.950> you<00:03:05.130> watched<00:03:05.370> watch

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
so next tag-team match you watched watch

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:07.520 
so next tag-team match you watched watch
out<00:03:06.299> and<00:03:06.480> see<00:03:06.600> if<00:03:06.720> the<00:03:06.810> partner<00:03:07.170> makes<00:03:07.319> more

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
out and see if the partner makes more

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:08.930 
out and see if the partner makes more
than<00:03:07.709> one<00:03:07.980> save<00:03:08.250> because<00:03:08.459> I<00:03:08.640> don't<00:03:08.790> know<00:03:08.850> if

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
than one save because I don't know if

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.610 
than one save because I don't know if
this<00:03:09.060> rule<00:03:09.269> is<00:03:09.299> still<00:03:09.540> around<00:03:09.780> but<00:03:10.319> apparently
