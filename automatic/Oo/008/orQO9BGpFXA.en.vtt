explain<00:01:09.810> a<00:01:10.530> little<00:01:11.070> bit<00:01:11.250> on<00:01:11.430> how<00:01:11.670> it<00:01:11.820> works

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
explain a little bit on how it works

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.050 
explain a little bit on how it works
it's<00:01:12.330> basically<00:01:12.950> you<00:01:13.950> just<00:01:13.979> play<00:01:14.700> a<00:01:14.729> quick

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
it's basically you just play a quick

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.820 
it's basically you just play a quick
game<00:01:15.119> and<00:01:15.689> after<00:01:16.229> you<00:01:16.320> play<00:01:16.530> a<00:01:16.560> quick<00:01:16.770> game

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
game and after you play a quick game

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.770 
game and after you play a quick game
assuming<00:01:17.369> that<00:01:17.670> you<00:01:17.759> win<00:01:17.939> you<00:01:18.090> get<00:01:18.240> two<00:01:18.479> draft

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
assuming that you win you get two draft

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.719 
assuming that you win you get two draft
picks<00:01:19.130> but<00:01:20.130> then<00:01:21.119> you<00:01:22.049> um<00:01:22.470> once<00:01:23.280> you<00:01:23.400> get<00:01:23.580> those

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
picks but then you um once you get those

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.469 
picks but then you um once you get those
two<00:01:24.030> draft<00:01:24.390> picks<00:01:24.540> you<00:01:25.409> just<00:01:25.680> go<00:01:26.460> exit<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.330> app

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
two draft picks you just go exit the app

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.359 
two draft picks you just go exit the app
and<00:01:28.520> you<00:01:29.520> basically<00:01:30.619> restart<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:31.799> app<00:01:31.950> and

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
and you basically restart the app and

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.219 
and you basically restart the app and
you<00:01:32.670> go<00:01:32.820> back<00:01:32.850> on<00:01:33.090> it<00:01:33.299> and<00:01:33.600> I<00:01:33.659> don't<00:01:33.810> have<00:01:33.960> to

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229

but that's ok so as you can see i won

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.039 
but that's ok so as you can see i won
the<00:02:45.340> game<00:02:45.519> so<00:02:45.730> i<00:02:45.760> have<00:02:46.090> two<00:02:46.480> draft<00:02:46.900> picks

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:47.049 
the game so i have two draft picks

the game so i have two draft picks
remaining<00:02:47.739> but<00:02:48.250> what<00:02:48.430> i<00:02:48.610> do<00:02:48.670> instead<00:02:49.329> of

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
remaining but what i do instead of

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:51.300 
remaining but what i do instead of
picking<00:02:49.750> the<00:02:49.900> cards<00:02:50.260> i<00:02:50.410> just<00:02:50.680> go<00:02:50.860> to<00:02:50.920> the<00:02:51.099> home
