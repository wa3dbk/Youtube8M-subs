00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:04.930
 we have biological 

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:07.090
 weapons that can destroy 

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:08.389
 all of us 

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:09.839
 we have bombs that can 

00:00:09.839 --> 00:00:12.070
 destroy no planet planet for the position 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:14.339
 solar system sun 

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:17.339
 tell me why we need it 

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:21.349
 for what 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.779
 I bet you think you bet 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.810
 I'm at a dead end but actually living 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.150
 there is one destination 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:33.420
 destination 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.330
 they are led by two roads 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:37.530
 this destination is complete 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.650
 perfect and filling 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:41.550
 we can reach it slowly by 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.200
 suffering or faster and more enjoyable 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.550
 by way of light and change 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:48.990
 it turns out that the path of suffering is altogether 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:51.540
 didn't get it just a set of effects on 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:52.610
 our life 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:55.220
 which occur due to the fact that we are not 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.190
 accept consciously participating in your 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.570
 development is slow useful 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:01.630
 teach on evolution which we call 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:03.490
 historians who wonder where 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:06.450
 started and it is not clear where we will lead 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.660
 light changes this way by 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:10.650
 which revealing our property 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.100
 nature and nature of the force directing us 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.100
 we get to the bottom of this 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.500
 natural gas and traffic targets 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.369
 the anomaly of us to him even 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.180
 start following her 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.640
 and the path of suffering only pushes 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.030
 we touch the form of physical 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.170
 circumstances with which causes us 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.960
 suffering enough for us not to 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:33.550
 realized made internal changes 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:36.270
 allows you to move forward 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.840
 100 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.010
 and since we are very different from 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:40.890
 filming managers of development 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.320
 what we resist npo chechen it 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.580
 impact as a painful way 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:47.560
 misery is an evolution of selfishness on 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.200
 over 1000 anniversary 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.490
 we are constantly inventing more 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:53.020
 and more way to get complications 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:54.270
 from nature 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.690
 and it seemed to go on like this 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:57.240
 infinitely 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.509
 and it always promised but hope for the future we 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:01.659
 thought that in the next generation 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:03.860
 we will be more health we will heal 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.390
 how can kings cross the ocean and 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.580
 to open distant countries we will fly to 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.940
 space explored reach 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.739
 political and personal freedoms 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:15.080
 build cars that year for us 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.099
 work we will enjoy 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:19.599
 but everything happened completely turnaround we 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:21.799
 enjoy but finally 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:24.129
 drifted apart and so 

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:26.849
 weapons of mass destruction which 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:28.810
 we see it just at the button and 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:29.889
 suffering 

00:02:29.889 --> 00:02:32.379
 indicating that our customers have reached 

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:34.589
 the final form of its development 

00:02:34.589 --> 00:02:36.929
 we can't all help move forward 

00:02:36.929 --> 00:02:39.549
 humanity is deadlocked in all 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:41.779
 areas of their activities because 

00:02:41.779 --> 00:02:44.929
 that selfishness and is able to propel us further 

00:02:44.929 --> 00:02:46.819
 and there is a need for something 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:49.139
 we also need something completely different 

00:02:49.139 --> 00:02:50.110
 order 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.080
 this is the first manifestation of the need 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.659
 spiritual in all mankind 

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:57.099
 and humanity must now begin 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:02:58.639
 develop consciously with 

00:02:58.639 --> 00:02:59.500
 perfect 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.040
 but you would sho law of nature if we 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.230
 let's go the way of light called culture 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.790
 then we can feel this completely today 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:08.570
 inside start living your next 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:11.780
 condition of their own choice and 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:12.750
 then there is no need 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.640
 compelling physical 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:15.979
 push from behind 

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:18.979
 let's go back to where he came 

00:03:23.429 --> 00:03:26.229
