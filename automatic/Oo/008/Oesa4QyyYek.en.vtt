the difference now he has run once at
the<00:04:23.639> track<00:04:23.880> before<00:04:24.200> and<00:04:25.200> was

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:25.600 
the track before and was

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:30.330

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:32.500 
class before without winning as well so

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.070 
class before without winning as well so
they'd<00:04:33.160> be<00:04:33.370> question<00:04:33.820> marks<00:04:34.150> but<00:04:34.330> what<00:04:34.750> we<00:04:34.840> can

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:35.080 
they'd be question marks but what we can

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.620 
they'd be question marks but what we can
do<00:04:35.290> is<00:04:35.410> we<00:04:35.560> can<00:04:35.710> click<00:04:36.040> the<00:04:36.430> place<00:04:36.820> radio

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:37.630

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:40.510 
button and we can see what difference

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:43.080 
button and we can see what difference
that<00:04:40.600> makes<00:04:40.810> the<00:04:41.410> camera<00:04:41.740> in<00:04:41.830> Highland<00:04:42.310> now<00:04:43.030> we

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:49.050 
can see that one of the runs in this
grade<00:04:46.240> was<00:04:46.720> a<00:04:46.750> placed<00:04:47.170> effort<00:04:47.910> although<00:04:48.910> we
