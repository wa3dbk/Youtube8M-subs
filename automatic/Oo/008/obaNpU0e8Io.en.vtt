lots of clicking and whirring so you've

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:33.510 
lots of clicking and whirring so you've
got<00:02:31.480> your<00:02:31.870> suspension<00:02:32.620> rope<00:02:32.860> to<00:02:33.220> go<00:02:33.310> all<00:02:33.490> the

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
way up to the real heads and the very

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:36.950 
way up to the real heads and the very
top<00:02:35.620> but<00:02:36.010> down

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:36.960 
top but down

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.210 
top but down
obviously<00:02:37.960> this<00:02:38.080> counter<00:02:38.500> weights<00:02:38.740> within

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
obviously this counter weights within

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.820 
obviously this counter weights within
the<00:02:39.340> lit<00:02:39.490> shaft<00:02:39.790> as<00:02:40.030> well<00:02:40.270> yeah<00:02:40.930> so<00:02:41.530> that<00:02:41.710> these

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830 
the lit shaft as well yeah so that these

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:44.160 
the lit shaft as well yeah so that these
aren't<00:02:42.100> having<00:02:42.280> the<00:02:42.430> works<00:02:42.670> of<00:02:42.850> art<00:02:43.060> and<00:02:43.990> if

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
aren't having the works of art and if

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.020 
aren't having the works of art and if
push<00:02:45.010> comes<00:02:45.250> to<00:02:45.340> shove<00:02:45.610> and<00:02:45.880> there's

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
push comes to shove and there's

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:55.590 
push comes to shove and there's
emergency<00:02:53.760> because<00:02:54.760> obviously<00:02:54.970> it's<00:02:55.240> moving

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:55.600 
emergency because obviously it's moving

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.110 
emergency because obviously it's moving
unguarded<00:02:56.320> equipment<00:02:56.980> although<00:02:57.850> there's<00:02:58.060> a

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
unguarded equipment although there's a

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.000 
unguarded equipment although there's a
bit<00:02:58.300> of<00:02:58.330> a<00:02:58.420> collar<00:02:58.630> on<00:02:58.750> it<00:02:58.930> but<00:02:59.530> we<00:02:59.650> have<00:02:59.770> to<00:02:59.800> go

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
bit of a collar on it but we have to go

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:01.979 
bit of a collar on it but we have to go
in<00:03:00.160> there<00:03:00.340> and<00:03:00.550> there's<00:03:00.700> a<00:03:00.790> brake<00:03:01.060> release

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:01.989 
in there and there's a brake release

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:06.150 
in there and there's a brake release
with<00:03:02.290> that<00:03:02.410> little<00:03:04.440> face<00:03:05.440> it<00:03:05.650> this<00:03:05.739> place<00:03:05.890> if

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
with that little face it this place if

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.100 
with that little face it this place if
you<00:03:06.220> can<00:03:06.400> see<00:03:06.580> where<00:03:06.760> this<00:03:06.880> this<00:03:07.600> bracket<00:03:08.050> is

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.110 
you can see where this this bracket is

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:09.600 
you can see where this this bracket is
with<00:03:08.320> the<00:03:08.410> bolt<00:03:08.590> going<00:03:08.770> through<00:03:09.070> it's

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:09.610 
with the bolt going through it's

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:12.510 
with the bolt going through it's
basically<00:03:10.030> like<00:03:10.180> two<00:03:10.480> big<00:03:10.690> drum<00:03:11.280> yeah<00:03:12.280> break

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:12.520 
basically like two big drum yeah break

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.940 
basically like two big drum yeah break
those<00:03:12.850> I<00:03:13.000> guess<00:03:13.180> and<00:03:13.600> all<00:03:13.870> you<00:03:14.020> do<00:03:14.170> is<00:03:14.200> you<00:03:14.440> hold

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
those I guess and all you do is you hold

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.340 
those I guess and all you do is you hold
that<00:03:15.160> and<00:03:15.910> it<00:03:16.060> just<00:03:16.090> ease<00:03:16.600> them<00:03:16.900> off<00:03:17.020> and<00:03:17.260> you

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:17.350 
that and it just ease them off and you

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:19.680 
that and it just ease them off and you
can<00:03:17.500> just<00:03:17.530> inch<00:03:17.890> into<00:03:18.459> the<00:03:18.580> little<00:03:19.570> tiny

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
can just inch into the little tiny

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:26.220 
can just inch into the little tiny
little<00:03:19.989> mic<00:03:20.350> okay

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:34.530 

and<00:03:28.620> almost<00:03:29.620> ketchup<00:03:29.950> you<00:03:30.040> later<00:03:30.220> right

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.600 

gets<00:03:35.080> quite<00:03:35.319> more<00:03:35.620> minions<00:03:35.950> somewhere<00:03:36.430> that's

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:36.610 
gets quite more minions somewhere that's

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:38.400 
gets quite more minions somewhere that's
why<00:03:36.730> it's<00:03:36.879> got<00:03:37.060> some<00:03:37.270> layout<00:03:37.569> handing<00:03:37.959> unit<00:03:38.260> in

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
why it's got some layout handing unit in

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:41.400 
why it's got some layout handing unit in
here<00:03:39.540> especially<00:03:40.540> if<00:03:40.629> they're<00:03:40.780> being<00:03:40.930> used<00:03:41.230> a

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410 
here especially if they're being used a

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:45.660 
here especially if they're being used a
lot<00:03:41.560> at<00:03:41.680> the<00:03:41.769> time<00:03:44.069> yeah<00:03:45.069> we<00:03:45.280> know<00:03:45.430> we're<00:03:45.640> on

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670 
lot at the time yeah we know we're on

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:48.479 
lot at the time yeah we know we're on
those<00:03:45.970> we're<00:03:46.330> under<00:03:46.800> underneath<00:03:47.800> screen

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:48.489 
those we're under underneath screen

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:51.960 
those we're under underneath screen
whatever<00:03:48.970> no<00:03:49.930> oh<00:03:50.200> yeah<00:03:50.650> no<00:03:50.860> idea<00:03:51.130> and<00:03:51.760> they

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970 
whatever no oh yeah no idea and they

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:53.940 
whatever no oh yeah no idea and they
stay<00:03:52.330> and<00:03:52.569> they're<00:03:53.050> cream<00:03:53.319> inside<00:03:53.739> the

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:53.950 
stay and they're cream inside the

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:56.910 
stay and they're cream inside the
equipment<00:03:54.190> lighting<00:03:54.640> so<00:03:55.540> we<00:03:55.690> had<00:03:55.900> no<00:03:56.709> energy

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:56.920 
equipment lighting so we had no energy

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.339 
equipment lighting so we had no energy
has<00:03:57.280> be<00:03:57.550> like<00:03:57.819> one<00:03:58.150> side<00:03:58.480> of<00:03:58.660> this<00:03:58.750> new

maybe<00:06:56.570> they<00:06:56.990> can<00:06:57.110> measure<00:06:57.320> how<00:06:57.560> many<00:06:57.680> twisting

00:06:58.300 --> 00:06:58.310 
maybe they can measure how many twisting

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:03.880 
maybe they can measure how many twisting
archimedean<00:06:59.090> probably<00:06:59.660> insanity<00:07:02.620> but<00:07:03.620> again

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:03.890 
archimedean probably insanity but again

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:06.190 
archimedean probably insanity but again
it's<00:07:04.100> a<00:07:04.220> typical<00:07:04.670> idea<00:07:05.060> that<00:07:05.360> it's<00:07:05.960> not<00:07:06.050> just

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:06.200 
it's a typical idea that it's not just

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:09.880 
it's a typical idea that it's not just
one<00:07:06.650> rule<00:07:06.920> its<00:07:07.760> it<00:07:08.480> is<00:07:08.660> it<00:07:08.990> is<00:07:09.140> one<00:07:09.410> rule<00:07:09.650> but

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:09.890 
one rule its it is it is one rule but

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:11.320 
one rule its it is it is one rule but
because<00:07:10.160> it's<00:07:10.310> going<00:07:10.430> around<00:07:10.550> so<00:07:10.880> many<00:07:11.000> public

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:11.330 
because it's going around so many public

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:24.340 
because it's going around so many public
yeah

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:24.350 

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:30.790 

I<00:07:27.910> love<00:07:28.910> engineering<00:07:29.090> me<00:07:29.630> or<00:07:30.230> what<00:07:30.410> they<00:07:30.620> do

00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:30.800 
I love engineering me or what they do

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:34.450 
I love engineering me or what they do
you<00:07:31.100> have<00:07:31.250> sky<00:07:31.490> -<00:07:31.550> nah<00:07:32.480> I<00:07:33.140> watch<00:07:33.680> they<00:07:34.340> have

00:07:34.450 --> 00:07:34.460 
you have sky - nah I watch they have

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:35.920 
you have sky - nah I watch they have
these<00:07:34.550> crew<00:07:34.790> that<00:07:34.970> non-core<00:07:35.360> how<00:07:35.540> it's<00:07:35.690> made

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:35.930 
these crew that non-core how it's made

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:39.910 
these crew that non-core how it's made
and<00:07:36.310> it'll<00:07:37.310> be<00:07:37.430> anything<00:07:38.090> from<00:07:38.390> making<00:07:38.920> crisps

00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:39.920 
and it'll be anything from making crisps

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:44.830 
and it'll be anything from making crisps
-<00:07:41.440> I<00:07:42.440> only<00:07:42.860> saw<00:07:42.980> that<00:07:43.340> yeah<00:07:43.610> and<00:07:43.880> it's<00:07:44.060> you<00:07:44.330> just

00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:44.840 
- I only saw that yeah and it's you just

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:48.320 
- I only saw that yeah and it's you just
see<00:07:45.080> the<00:07:45.140> end

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:48.330 

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:50.850 

and<00:07:49.330> there's<00:07:49.720> a<00:07:49.810> little<00:07:49.960> place<00:07:50.140> down<00:07:50.290> the<00:07:50.680> road

00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:50.860 
and there's a little place down the road

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:54.660 
and there's a little place down the road
called<00:07:51.190> Mayfield<00:07:51.850> engineering
