00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:16.859
 I am Marxism 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.859
 last year a new one was awarded 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:23.869
 because true 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:31.160
 that only at the end of pre-vocational secondary education so just before I have nothing to worry about 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.500
 leaked out a little late 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:39.300
 to choose a the caterpillar herculis network but specified for after the summer holidays 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.490
 and 

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:44.390
 for pants as soon as the horse and hard ride the pain core still inside 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:45.590
 can flow 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:49.320
 having done that but it wasn't really anything that fits me there 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:56.450
 two years ago 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:59.920
 then the real work of her husband started as there but I left the 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.350
 training hall of training 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:07.930
 much more until 2005 was read I started thinking of well I know I was 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:09.060
 working on that 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.490
 that's why it isn't 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.780
 the approach to those little things in practice 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.850
 then i thought i just go out and work i liked it too 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.880
 doing is in the levenaar why I do not go to school where there is a gap in the neighborhood 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.340
 and in that profession 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.620
 that's how I came to think but actually I like it and I go for it 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:29.030
 just do her 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.030
 the festival 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.310
 it can not sit still and therefore really be of the party 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.430
 and therefore 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:42.920
 I just go to work four days a week and many of them go to school every week 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.920
 in the event of a collision, therefore, theory 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.979
 what is the difference between percent to 59 points disclosed 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:56.260
 everything out again showing that you use your work 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:00.370
 you 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:03.250
 it is currently very weird there 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.420
 for her they are a man's world and not more special you just have to be one 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:08.159
 coma 

00:02:08.159 --> 00:02:10.529
 appreciate that too 

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:14.099
 there are many then you expect there too 

00:02:14.649 --> 00:02:17.649
 in front of 

00:02:18.399 --> 00:02:19.670
 the 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.670
 the 

00:02:23.869 --> 00:02:28.749
 the telco you big on earth that people said hence that's something but yes we 

00:02:28.749 --> 00:02:31.029
 just try it 

00:02:31.029 --> 00:02:34.719
 He thinks but I will not listen to what happens with the plus 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:39.849
 Yes it is just an important to throw the good courses early 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:43.159
 you know you have grown for many, many years 

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:45.919
 that's just the most important thing 

00:02:45.919 --> 00:02:47.109
 Who
