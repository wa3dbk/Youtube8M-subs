00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 good guys that so very good 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.700
 welcome the raid domain we are going to 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.080
 say from this decade by far 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:14.059
 please do not be 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:15.530
 and well so let's cheat but 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:17.870
 well let's see if we can look at a 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:22.990
 little the super stitches 

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:27.200
 with which I believe that he has already killed me 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:29.480
 that today the uncle does not have any flag 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.730
 but that's secondary you know he prefers 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.640
 stay up there camping for 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:36.460
 see if you catch any in plan 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:38.980
 telepathically 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:42.570
 mathematically you have eaten a champion 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:42.570
 that you do not see and this 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:48.470
 good 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.470
 outside also 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:55.220
 let's open this one a little bit 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:58.420
 let's go here 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.420
 we have here below 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.720
 we recharged we are going to make some dots 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:08.140
 more before this legacy ends 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:11.350
 if you are finishing the round 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:13.600
 people do not notice well above I've 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:16.120
 I got the streak and I do not know how long 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:19.060
 it is once 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:21.640
 I am a great example 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.619
 for what I'm talking about I'm a great 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.409
 example 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:27.729
 71 let's see if we can finish this 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:29.740
 although we got enough in points 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:31.180
 because we have entered already we have the three 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.850
 flags and we're getting enough 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:36.970
 points but I want to see what has been 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.649
 butt the bullets have given him given 15 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:40.390
 shovels that man let's see now if 

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:42.009
 we can get to take out I do not know what it is 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:45.280
 crossed, I think we need a lot to 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:46.600
 have it and if we have to remove it what 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.369
 we have here the let's go to me live 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.899
 you know what I like to do to myself 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:51.640
 I knocked down directly although the 50 points 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:52.330
 of cear I would come pretty enough 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.690
 all right 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:57.310
 but I will go straight 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:59.140
 villar when in reality you should 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.570
 because you get too many points 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:04.220
 depends depends if my team gets in yes 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:07.300
 yes I'm not going to just stand 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.300
 because there is nothing like 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:13.810
 this man from above to control the 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:16.120
 zone ends creating a little bit of my 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.879
 partner is going to catch her 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.200
 so I'm going to go in too and with 

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:24.870
 this took me out 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.870
 this is going to kill me that does not take no 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:33.560
 I'm leaving, I have to go, I have to 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.560
 split 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.540
 in order to show you 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.990
 perfect to triple 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.159
 the threat eliminated 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.080
 OK 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:05.980
 we will see prevalent 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.120
 let's catch them while we have 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.620
 again 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.770
 because both you lift or the mass or 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:15.100
 metal and that man beat the c4 there 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:16.480
 so come on we have another time to put a 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:19.560
 use either but I'll let 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.560
 catch we see that if I do not get 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:32.180
 we are running working and killing 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.180
 over here and killing over there 

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:40.090
 out friend on the way 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:48.210
 perfect see you got a streak of 15 

00:03:45.689 --> 00:03:50.910
 in the blink of an eye 

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:54.110
 quite not cited also enough 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:54.110

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:12.310

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:20.630
 now to see how milk I can stand 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:24.970

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:23.449
 position but now 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:26.180
 my mother for real that these games 

00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:28.759

 they kill you what happens that is not different 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:38.889
 sometimes 

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:42.020
 there are many many bouts of 25 that do not 

00:05:38.889 --> 00:05:43.850
 I'm going to go up because look because some 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:46.669

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:49.619
 raise these people as we do 

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:50.879
 it ended up biting again yet still 48 4 no 

00:05:49.619 --> 00:05:52.469
 it has been wrong although it could have been 

00:05:50.879 --> 00:05:54.719
 much better has got me the streak of 25 

00:05:52.469 --> 00:05:55.889
 in the end if I get some streak there in 

00:05:54.719 --> 00:05:57.419
 plan destroyer that has been quite 

00:05:55.889 --> 00:05:59.099
 cool that's why I liked the game 

00:05:57.419 --> 00:06:00.779
 you're going to have it in the channel because I 

00:05:59.099 --> 00:06:02.279
 have liked that kind of hairline so 

00:06:00.779 --> 00:06:04.499
 Well I hope that I have molado we are going to 

00:06:02.279 --> 00:06:05.849
 see at the end if it has taken me out there 

00:06:04.499 --> 00:06:07.199
 low turbo or some mobility is 

00:06:05.849 --> 00:06:09.749
 interesting is that once also 

00:06:07.199 --> 00:06:11.249
 It's cool because you say good, it does not get me another 

00:06:09.749 --> 00:06:14.789
 nuclear but at least it has been a 

00:06:11.249 --> 00:06:15.899
 brutal so cool that he is also 

00:06:14.789 --> 00:06:18.749

00:06:15.899 --> 00:06:20.039
 medallita that was also have them and 

00:06:18.749 --> 00:06:23.129
 I think I do not know I think he did not send 

00:06:20.039 --> 00:06:25.139
 none or if not a super low not 

00:06:23.129 --> 00:06:26.699

00:06:25.139 --> 00:06:27.689
