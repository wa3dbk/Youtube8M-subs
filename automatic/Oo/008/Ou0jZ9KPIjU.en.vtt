some<00:06:08.360> reason

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:08.840 
some reason

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:15.460 
some reason
what<00:06:10.570> okay<00:06:11.600> what<00:06:12.290> could<00:06:12.590> this<00:06:13.250> problem<00:06:13.700> be<00:06:14.470> we

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:15.470 
what okay what could this problem be we

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:25.810 
what okay what could this problem be we
start<00:06:15.770> the<00:06:15.890> motor<00:06:16.070> up<00:06:22.270> its<00:06:23.270> source<00:06:24.700> well<00:06:25.700> that

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:25.820 
start the motor up its source well that

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:29.050 
start the motor up its source well that
means<00:06:27.250> you're<00:06:28.250> probably<00:06:28.370> on<00:06:28.580> the<00:06:28.640> block<00:06:28.850> our

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:04.180 
off from here but if it keeps going

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:05.680 
off from here but if it keeps going
maybe<00:07:05.180> yeah

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:05.690 
maybe yeah

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:09.420 
maybe yeah
this<00:07:06.500> thing's<00:07:06.710> plot<00:07:06.980> so<00:07:07.490> we<00:07:07.760> start<00:07:08.450> back<00:07:08.540> up

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:09.430 
this thing's plot so we start back up

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:24.129 
this thing's plot so we start back up
without<00:07:10.430> a<00:07:10.970> little<00:07:21.550> better<00:07:22.550> from<00:07:22.850> here<00:07:23.139> you

00:07:24.129 --> 00:07:24.139 
without a little better from here you

00:07:24.139 --> 00:07:26.190 
without a little better from here you
cannot<00:07:24.470> try<00:07:24.800> and<00:07:24.889> fix<00:07:25.010> it<00:07:25.100> yourself<00:07:25.220> from<00:07:25.610> here

00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:26.200 
cannot try and fix it yourself from here

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:29.080 
cannot try and fix it yourself from here
but<00:07:27.200> you<00:07:27.230> can<00:07:27.530> probably<00:07:27.740> you<00:07:28.639> know<00:07:28.760> pull<00:07:29.000> the

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:29.090 
but you can probably you know pull the

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:31.480 
but you can probably you know pull the
whole<00:07:29.210> motor<00:07:29.419> apart<00:07:29.750> and<00:07:29.900> see<00:07:30.050> why<00:07:31.040> he<00:07:31.310> was

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:31.490 
whole motor apart and see why he was

00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:32.080 
whole motor apart and see why he was
doing<00:07:31.760> this

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:32.090 
doing this
