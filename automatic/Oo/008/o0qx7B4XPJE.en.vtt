much<00:01:56.979> sugar<00:01:57.220> is<00:01:57.310> in<00:01:57.399> it<00:01:57.610> the<00:01:58.569> pecans<00:01:59.050> they

00:01:59.309 --> 00:01:59.319 
much sugar is in it the pecans they

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:00.660 
much sugar is in it the pecans they
sound<00:01:59.619> healthy<00:01:59.979> but<00:02:00.129> there's<00:02:00.310> actually<00:02:00.459> quite

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
sound healthy but there's actually quite

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.330 
sound healthy but there's actually quite
a<00:02:00.819> bit<00:02:01.000> of<00:02:01.090> fat<00:02:01.270> in<00:02:01.300> a<00:02:01.509> pecan<00:02:01.899> and<00:02:02.080> there<00:02:02.979> seem

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
a bit of fat in a pecan and there seem

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:04.770 
a bit of fat in a pecan and there seem
to<00:02:03.369> be<00:02:03.520> glazed<00:02:03.849> with<00:02:04.119> some<00:02:04.300> sort<00:02:04.509> of<00:02:04.599> honey

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:04.780 
to be glazed with some sort of honey

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.109 
to be glazed with some sort of honey
glades<00:02:05.140> so<00:02:05.709> I<00:02:05.739> mean<00:02:06.069> there<00:02:06.670> could<00:02:06.819> be<00:02:06.849> a<00:02:06.910> lot<00:02:07.060> of

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:07.119 
glades so I mean there could be a lot of

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:08.880 
glades so I mean there could be a lot of
hidden<00:02:07.300> sugar<00:02:07.569> in<00:02:07.720> this<00:02:07.810> meal<00:02:07.989> that<00:02:08.440> I<00:02:08.649> don't

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
hidden sugar in this meal that I don't

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:10.710 
hidden sugar in this meal that I don't
know<00:02:09.039> about<00:02:09.160> and<00:02:09.459> same<00:02:10.090> with<00:02:10.119> this<00:02:10.360> this

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
know about and same with this this

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.150 
know about and same with this this
garlic<00:02:11.080> toast<00:02:11.290> there<00:02:11.470> could<00:02:11.709> be<00:02:11.739> quite<00:02:11.980> a<00:02:12.010> bit

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
garlic toast there could be quite a bit

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.589 
garlic toast there could be quite a bit
of<00:02:12.220> fat<00:02:12.400> in<00:02:12.430> the<00:02:12.610> butter<00:02:12.819> on<00:02:12.910> the<00:02:13.120> garlic<00:02:13.420> toast

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:13.599 
of fat in the butter on the garlic toast

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:15.510 
of fat in the butter on the garlic toast
so<00:02:14.080> although<00:02:14.379> that<00:02:14.709> I<00:02:14.920> mean<00:02:15.250> that<00:02:15.370> looks

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
so although that I mean that looks

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.040 
so although that I mean that looks
pretty<00:02:15.849> healthy<00:02:16.000> I<00:02:16.209> don't<00:02:16.390> if<00:02:16.450> you<00:02:16.510> can<00:02:16.660> see

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
pretty healthy I don't if you can see

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:18.780 
pretty healthy I don't if you can see
that<00:02:17.080> I<00:02:17.470> mean<00:02:17.739> there's<00:02:18.069> no<00:02:18.190> way<00:02:18.370> you'd<00:02:18.580> guess

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
that I mean there's no way you'd guess

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.089 
that I mean there's no way you'd guess
that<00:02:19.060> that<00:02:19.239> might<00:02:19.810> be<00:02:20.080> a<00:02:20.379> high-calorie<00:02:20.920> meal

00:02:21.089 --> 00:02:21.099 
that that might be a high-calorie meal

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:23.610 
that that might be a high-calorie meal
but<00:02:21.790> i<00:02:21.970> would<00:02:22.120> i<00:02:22.510> would<00:02:22.689> bet<00:02:23.140> that<00:02:23.170> this<00:02:23.560> is

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
but i would i would bet that this is

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.100 
but i would i would bet that this is
significantly<00:02:24.579> more<00:02:24.670> calories

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
significantly more calories

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:27.570 
significantly more calories
and<00:02:26.170> I<00:02:26.260> would<00:02:26.410> need<00:02:26.590> to<00:02:26.650> eat<00:02:26.890> right<00:02:27.130> now<00:02:27.190> so<00:02:27.490> I'm

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
and I would need to eat right now so I'm

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:28.860 
and I would need to eat right now so I'm
probably<00:02:27.790> only<00:02:28.090> going<00:02:28.210> to<00:02:28.300> eat<00:02:28.420> half<00:02:28.630> of<00:02:28.750> this

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
probably only going to eat half of this

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.320 
probably only going to eat half of this
and<00:02:29.350> pack<00:02:29.620> the<00:02:29.770> rest<00:02:29.890> up<00:02:30.130> but<00:02:30.670> most<00:02:30.970> people<00:02:31.240> are

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
and pack the rest up but most people are

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.300 
and pack the rest up but most people are
just<00:02:31.450> going<00:02:31.600> to<00:02:31.660> eat<00:02:31.840> this<00:02:32.440> whole<00:02:32.650> serving<00:02:33.190> as

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
just going to eat this whole serving as

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.370 
just going to eat this whole serving as
if<00:02:33.460> it<00:02:33.610> was<00:02:33.730> one<00:02:34.120> meal<00:02:34.330> and<00:02:34.570> not<00:02:34.840> assume<00:02:34.990> at<00:02:35.260> all

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
if it was one meal and not assume at all

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.190 
if it was one meal and not assume at all
that<00:02:35.590> salad<00:02:36.520> that<00:02:36.640> looks<00:02:36.820> this<00:02:36.910> unassuming<00:02:37.720> is

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
that salad that looks this unassuming is

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.410 
that salad that looks this unassuming is

could actually have a significant amount

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.630 
could actually have a significant amount
of<00:02:40.570> fat<00:02:40.720> sugar<00:02:40.990> and<00:02:41.140> calories<00:02:41.650> it<00:02:42.010> I'm<00:02:42.370> too

advance<00:03:21.760> yeah<00:03:22.510> I<00:03:22.780> think<00:03:23.080> the<00:03:23.260> take-home

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
advance yeah I think the take-home

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.800 
advance yeah I think the take-home
message<00:03:23.680> here<00:03:24.250> is<00:03:24.280> that<00:03:24.400> you<00:03:24.940> can't<00:03:25.270> win<00:03:25.630> your

to sabotage your success and if you
fought<00:04:07.120> like<00:04:07.330> that<00:04:07.570> you're<00:04:07.750> becoming

consumed<00:04:10.090> with<00:04:10.120> this<00:04:10.540> but<00:04:11.049> what<00:04:11.260> is<00:04:11.470> the

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:11.890 
consumed with this but what is the

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:14.340 
consumed with this but what is the
problem<00:04:12.190> is<00:04:12.430> that<00:04:12.459> this<00:04:13.000> starts<00:04:13.870> to<00:04:13.930> build<00:04:14.170> up

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:14.350 
problem is that this starts to build up

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:16.050 
problem is that this starts to build up
over<00:04:14.500> time<00:04:14.680> when<00:04:15.370> you<00:04:15.489> start<00:04:15.730> eating<00:04:15.970> like

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 
over time when you start eating like

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.270 
over time when you start eating like
this<00:04:16.120> one<00:04:17.049> week<00:04:17.320> to<00:04:17.620> week<00:04:17.799> three<00:04:18.010> weeks<00:04:18.190> all

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 
this one week to week three weeks all

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.070 
this one week to week three weeks all
these<00:04:18.430> little<00:04:18.700> meals<00:04:19.000> they<00:04:19.209> pile<00:04:19.690> up<00:04:19.840> and

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:20.080 
these little meals they pile up and

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:22.110 
these little meals they pile up and
that's<00:04:20.440> what<00:04:20.799> starts<00:04:21.070> cancelling<00:04:21.640> out<00:04:21.729> a<00:04:21.760> you

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
that's what starts cancelling out a you

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.430 
that's what starts cancelling out a you
know<00:04:22.210> an<00:04:22.300> entire<00:04:22.570> week<00:04:22.810> of<00:04:22.930> training<00:04:23.140> so

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440
