00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:19.730 
to start with my right so what I'm doing

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:22.030 
to start with my right so what I'm doing
is<00:01:20.180> I'm<00:01:20.330> just<00:01:20.570> checking<00:01:20.870> to<00:01:21.020> see<00:01:21.380> if<00:01:21.410> the

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:22.040

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:29.020 
that it doesn't look too overdone or too
small<00:01:27.800> because<00:01:28.130> that<00:01:28.340> would<00:01:28.460> just<00:01:28.490> throw<00:01:28.910> off

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
small because that would just throw off

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.150 
small because that would just throw off
the<00:01:29.270> whole<00:01:29.420> look<00:01:29.660> and<00:01:29.900> since<00:01:30.590> it<00:01:30.740> does<00:01:30.920> fit

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:31.160 
the whole look and since it does fit

the whole look and since it does fit
right<00:01:31.340> to<00:01:31.460> my<00:01:31.550> I<00:01:31.580> automatically<00:01:32.360> I<00:01:32.480> there<00:01:32.900> is

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.110 
right to my I automatically I there is

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.080 
right to my I automatically I there is
no<00:01:33.500> need<00:01:33.680> for<00:01:33.890> me<00:01:34.010> to<00:01:34.040> use<00:01:34.310> the<00:01:34.520> scissors<00:01:34.730> in

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
no need for me to use the scissors in

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.150 
no need for me to use the scissors in
other<00:01:35.690> cases<00:01:36.080> with<00:01:36.440> other<00:01:36.590> brands<00:01:36.950> of

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:37.160 
other cases with other brands of

other cases with other brands of
eyelashes<00:01:37.700> you<00:01:37.820> might<00:01:38.030> need<00:01:38.210> to<00:01:38.270> use<00:01:38.450> the

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:38.660 
eyelashes you might need to use the

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:44.100 
eyelashes you might need to use the
scissors<00:01:38.870> but<00:01:39.230> in<00:01:39.350> my<00:01:39.470> case<00:01:39.500> I<00:01:39.890> didn't<00:01:40.190> have<00:01:40.370> to

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.110 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:46.380 

so<00:01:44.830> the<00:01:44.950> very<00:01:45.160> next<00:01:45.370> step<00:01:45.640> after<00:01:45.880> you<00:01:46.180> have

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.390 
so the very next step after you have

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.570 
so the very next step after you have
sized<00:01:46.660> them<00:01:46.930> right<00:01:47.140> and<00:01:47.290> it<00:01:47.410> looks<00:01:47.620> good<00:01:47.860> you

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:48.580 
sized them right and it looks good you

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:50.250 
sized them right and it looks good you
