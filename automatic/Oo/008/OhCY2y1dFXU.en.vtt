these two towers first is I think of

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.410 
these two towers first is I think of
towers<00:01:43.530> can<00:01:44.159> be<00:01:44.280> split<00:01:44.490> up<00:01:44.579> there's<00:01:44.939> towers

towers can be split up there's towers
that<00:01:45.570> are<00:01:45.630> good<00:01:45.899> for<00:01:45.930> that<00:01:46.380> you're<00:01:46.860> getting<00:01:46.950> in

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:48.350 
that are good for that you're getting in
the<00:01:47.250> game<00:01:47.399> tires<00:01:47.729> that<00:01:47.909> are<00:01:47.939> good<00:01:48.119> for<00:01:48.149> the

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
the game tires that are good for the

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.910 
the game tires that are good for the
middle<00:01:48.600> of<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:48.720> game<00:01:48.869> and<00:01:49.140> towers<00:01:49.740> that<00:01:49.860> are

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
middle of the game and towers that are

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.210 
middle of the game and towers that are
great<00:01:50.369> for<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:50.790> end<00:01:51.060> of<00:01:51.329> the<00:01:51.420> game<00:01:52.040> so<00:01:53.040> the

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
great for the end of the game so the

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.740 
great for the end of the game so the
towers<00:01:53.520> that<00:01:53.610> are<00:01:53.670> did<00:01:53.880> for<00:01:54.060> the<00:01:54.119> beginning<00:01:54.540> of

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
towers that are did for the beginning of

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.499 
towers that are did for the beginning of
the<00:01:54.869> game<00:01:55.020> obviously<00:01:55.460> towers<00:01:56.460> like<00:01:56.670> the<00:01:57.210> dart

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
the game obviously towers like the dart

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:02.620 
the game obviously towers like the dart
monkey<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.560> tax<00:01:58.950> shooter<00:01:59.520> the<00:02:00.270> UM<00:02:01.009> was<00:02:02.009> a<00:02:02.040> fog

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
monkey the tax shooter the UM was a fog

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.389 
monkey the tax shooter the UM was a fog
ninja<00:02:03.630> monkey<00:02:03.960> and<00:02:04.320> sometimes<00:02:04.829> a<00:02:04.979> bomb<00:02:05.159> tower

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
ninja monkey and sometimes a bomb tower

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:06.950 
ninja monkey and sometimes a bomb tower
although<00:02:05.790> that's<00:02:06.030> usually<00:02:06.360> more<00:02:06.540> towards<00:02:06.810> the

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
although that's usually more towards the

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.589 
although that's usually more towards the
middle<00:02:07.170> um<00:02:07.560> and<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.879> reason<00:02:09.000> those<00:02:09.239> are<00:02:09.420> good

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
middle um and the reason those are good

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.630 
middle um and the reason those are good
is<00:02:09.780> because<00:02:10.170> usually<00:02:10.770> they're<00:02:11.129> really<00:02:11.400> cheap

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
is because usually they're really cheap

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.350 
is because usually they're really cheap
and

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
and

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.210 
and
the<00:02:12.510> parts<00:02:12.870> they<00:02:13.050> give<00:02:13.200> you<00:02:13.350> really<00:02:13.620> good<00:02:13.650> but

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
the parts they give you really good but

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.730 
the parts they give you really good but
once<00:02:14.910> you<00:02:15.000> get<00:02:15.090> arm<00:02:15.240> to<00:02:15.420> later<00:02:15.660> levels<00:02:15.930> they're

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
once you get arm to later levels they're

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:20.540 
once you get arm to later levels they're
not<00:02:16.950> as<00:02:17.190> good<00:02:17.340> on<00:02:17.960> the<00:02:18.960> middlegame<00:02:19.860> towers<00:02:20.400> I

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
not as good on the middlegame towers I

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.670

that<00:03:23.610> it's<00:03:23.790> not<00:03:23.940> that<00:03:24.000> big<00:03:24.390> video<00:03:24.600> if<00:03:24.810> you

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
that it's not that big video if you

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.690 
that it's not that big video if you
don't<00:03:25.049> get<00:03:25.170> it<00:03:25.320> super<00:03:25.590> seen<00:03:25.739> what<00:03:26.190> you<00:03:26.430> really

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
don't get it super seen what you really

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.210 
don't get it super seen what you really
want<00:03:27.060> is<00:03:27.239> the<00:03:27.480> plasma<00:03:28.290> vision<00:03:28.620> super<00:03:28.920> monkey

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
want is the plasma vision super monkey

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.370 
want is the plasma vision super monkey
now<00:03:29.790> the<00:03:29.850> reason<00:03:30.269> this<00:03:30.510> is<00:03:30.570> so<00:03:30.690> much<00:03:31.170> better

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
now the reason this is so much better

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.620 
now the reason this is so much better
than<00:03:31.560> the<00:03:31.739> laser<00:03:31.950> vision<00:03:32.160> laser<00:03:32.880> vision<00:03:33.180> looks

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
than the laser vision laser vision looks

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.300 
than the laser vision laser vision looks
like<00:03:33.930> it'd<00:03:34.110> be<00:03:34.290> just<00:03:34.320> as<00:03:34.680> good<00:03:34.830> I<00:03:34.890> mean<00:03:35.160> you

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
like it'd be just as good I mean you

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:36.890 
like it'd be just as good I mean you
know<00:03:35.459> the<00:03:35.489> sheathing<00:03:35.880> 20<00:03:36.090> Lawrence<00:03:36.720> is

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
know the sheathing 20 Lawrence is

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.440 
know the sheathing 20 Lawrence is
shooting<00:03:37.230> really<00:03:37.380> fast<00:03:37.709> wait<00:03:38.400> you<00:03:38.880> don't<00:03:39.209> know

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
shooting really fast wait you don't know

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.240 
shooting really fast wait you don't know
is<00:03:39.720> the<00:03:39.900> plasma<00:03:40.350> vision<00:03:40.680> from<00:03:40.920> what<00:03:41.100> I<00:03:41.130> can

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
is the plasma vision from what I can

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.310 
is the plasma vision from what I can
tell<00:03:41.370> it<00:03:41.730> sheets<00:03:41.940> like<00:03:42.150> four<00:03:42.660> to<00:03:42.840> eight<00:03:43.019> times

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.320 
tell it sheets like four to eight times

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:46.729 
tell it sheets like four to eight times
as<00:03:43.620> fast<00:03:43.830> and<00:03:44.220> then<00:03:44.610> we<00:03:44.820> um<00:03:45.120> you<00:03:45.660> get<00:03:45.930> the<00:03:46.410> next

rubber monkey um yeah I think it's the
Robo<00:03:52.019> monkey<00:03:52.380> it's<00:03:52.500> something<00:03:52.769> like<00:03:52.799> that<00:03:53.130> um

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:53.580 
Robo monkey it's something like that um

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:56.690 
Robo monkey it's something like that um
you<00:03:54.510> want<00:03:54.750> it<00:03:54.870> to<00:03:55.170> be<00:03:55.350> able<00:03:55.709> to<00:03:56.280> have<00:03:56.549> the

you want it to be able to have the

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.280 
you want it to be able to have the
plasma<00:03:57.090> vision<00:03:57.390> because<00:03:57.780> of<00:03:57.900> what<00:03:58.019> I<00:03:58.049> just

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
plasma vision because of what I just

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.470 
plasma vision because of what I just
said<00:03:58.470> but<00:03:58.709> here's<00:03:59.340> the<00:03:59.400> thing<00:03:59.489> when<00:04:00.180> you<00:04:00.330> going

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880 
know is after the the sunlight is after

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:10.340 
know is after the the sunlight is after
the<00:04:05.970> plasma<00:04:06.420> vision<00:04:06.750> on<00:04:06.980> you<00:04:08.900> this<00:04:09.900> video<00:04:10.170> when

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:10.350 
the plasma vision on you this video when

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:12.620 
the plasma vision on you this video when
you<00:04:10.440> get<00:04:10.560> a<00:04:10.820> technological<00:04:11.820> terror<00:04:12.060> whatever

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:12.630 
you get a technological terror whatever

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:14.690 
you get a technological terror whatever
the<00:04:12.900> thing<00:04:12.930> is<00:04:13.290> that's<00:04:13.560> the<00:04:13.860> road<00:04:14.070> well<00:04:14.250> monkey

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
the thing is that's the road well monkey

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.360 
the thing is that's the road well monkey
you<00:04:15.390> shoot<00:04:15.870> twice<00:04:16.290> as<00:04:16.530> fast<00:04:16.680> basically<00:04:17.250> right

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
you shoot twice as fast basically right

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:18.920 
you shoot twice as fast basically right

he's got two arms and shoes twice as
fast<00:04:19.109> that's<00:04:19.290> new<00:04:19.560> and<00:04:20.070> you<00:04:20.160> get<00:04:20.280> a<00:04:20.310> sungard

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
fast that's new and you get a sungard

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:23.480 
fast that's new and you get a sungard
however<00:04:21.479> he<00:04:21.930> shoots<00:04:22.140> three<00:04:22.560> times<00:04:22.770> as<00:04:22.950> fast<00:04:22.979> so

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
however he shoots three times as fast so

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:24.350 
however he shoots three times as fast so
you<00:04:23.550> gotta<00:04:23.880> kind<00:04:23.940> of

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
you gotta kind of

you gotta kind of
that's<00:04:24.599> so<00:04:24.750> like<00:04:24.900> in<00:04:25.080> this<00:04:25.229> situation<00:04:25.650> I

00:04:26.119 --> 00:04:26.129 
that's so like in this situation I

00:04:26.129 --> 00:04:28.999 
that's so like in this situation I
really<00:04:26.520> wanted<00:04:27.270> to<00:04:27.330> get<00:04:27.569> SN<00:04:28.110> God<00:04:28.319> but<00:04:28.650> at<00:04:28.860> the

00:04:28.999 --> 00:04:29.009 
really wanted to get SN God but at the

00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:30.409 
really wanted to get SN God but at the
time<00:04:29.039> I<00:04:29.250> wasn't<00:04:29.610> going<00:04:29.789> to<00:04:29.879> be<00:04:29.969> able<00:04:30.060> to<00:04:30.240> do

time I wasn't going to be able to do

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:33.320 
time I wasn't going to be able to do
that<00:04:30.599> before<00:04:30.870> I<00:04:31.139> ran<00:04:31.710> out<00:04:31.979> of<00:04:32.009> money<00:04:32.250> and<00:04:32.520> the

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
that before I ran out of money and the

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:34.700 
that before I ran out of money and the
balloons<00:04:33.810> are<00:04:33.930> starting<00:04:34.199> to<00:04:34.229> come<00:04:34.349> on<00:04:34.500> really

85<00:05:01.319> for<00:05:02.009> easy<00:05:02.189> i<00:05:02.370> believe<00:05:02.610> it's<00:05:02.759> 15<00:05:03.330> for<00:05:03.719> medium

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:04.500 
85 for easy i believe it's 15 for medium

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:07.939 
85 for easy i believe it's 15 for medium
i<00:05:04.650> think<00:05:04.860> it's<00:05:05.009> 6py<00:05:05.960> but<00:05:06.960> um<00:05:07.259> yeah<00:05:07.860> I<00:05:07.919> don't

00:05:07.939 --> 00:05:07.949 
i think it's 6py but um yeah I don't

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:09.769 
i think it's 6py but um yeah I don't
usually<00:05:08.310> play<00:05:08.639> medium<00:05:09.029> as<00:05:09.180> you<00:05:09.360> play<00:05:09.539> even

00:05:09.769 --> 00:05:09.779 
usually play medium as you play even

00:05:09.779 --> 00:05:13.999 
usually play medium as you play even
easier<00:05:10.050> hard<00:05:10.529> that<00:05:12.529> basically<00:05:13.529> what<00:05:13.800> you<00:05:13.889> want

00:05:13.999 --> 00:05:14.009 
easier hard that basically what you want

00:05:14.009 --> 00:05:17.990 
easier hard that basically what you want
to<00:05:14.159> do<00:05:14.310> is<00:05:14.669> once<00:05:15.150> you<00:05:15.360> get<00:05:15.569> to<00:05:15.810> round<00:05:16.500> 85<00:05:17.340> when

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000 
to do is once you get to round 85 when

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.309 
to do is once you get to round 85 when
there's<00:05:18.360> a<00:05:18.979> zomg<00:05:19.979> the<00:05:20.370> Zeppelin<00:05:21.180> of<00:05:21.419> mighty

00:05:22.309 --> 00:05:22.319 
there's a zomg the Zeppelin of mighty

00:05:22.319 --> 00:05:24.469 
there's a zomg the Zeppelin of mighty
gargantuan<00:05:23.069> this<00:05:23.759> I<00:05:23.939> think<00:05:24.000> is<00:05:24.180> what<00:05:24.360> it's

00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:24.479 
gargantuan this I think is what it's

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:27.469 
gargantuan this I think is what it's
called<00:05:24.509> doesn't<00:05:25.469> really<00:05:25.529> matter<00:05:25.889> but<00:05:26.550> you

00:05:27.469 --> 00:05:27.479 
called doesn't really matter but you

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:29.240 
called doesn't really matter but you
want<00:05:27.659> to<00:05:27.750> place<00:05:27.930> down<00:05:28.199> the<00:05:28.409> bomb<00:05:28.589> tower<00:05:28.860> and

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:29.250 
want to place down the bomb tower and

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:31.490 
want to place down the bomb tower and
their<00:05:29.400> last<00:05:29.639> upgrade<00:05:29.940> they're<00:05:30.690> like<00:05:30.990> whatever

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:31.500 
their last upgrade they're like whatever

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:32.930 
their last upgrade they're like whatever
it<00:05:31.680> is<00:05:31.770> where<00:05:32.039> you<00:05:32.129> click<00:05:32.339> it<00:05:32.490> once<00:05:32.729> and

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:32.940 
it is where you click it once and

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:35.450 
it is where you click it once and
destroys<00:05:33.539> the<00:05:33.779> nearest<00:05:34.169> be<00:05:34.949> a<00:05:34.979> fee<00:05:35.370> or

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:35.460 
destroys the nearest be a fee or

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:37.550 
destroys the nearest be a fee or
whatever<00:05:35.819> you<00:05:36.569> want<00:05:36.750> to<00:05:36.839> get<00:05:36.990> that<00:05:37.169> because

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:37.560 
whatever you want to get that because

00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:39.349 
that are just completely wrecked house

00:05:39.349 --> 00:05:41.510 
that are just completely wrecked house
those<00:05:40.349> are<00:05:40.529> really<00:05:40.650> important<00:05:41.099> to<00:05:41.129> get<00:05:41.279> that

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:41.520 
those are really important to get that

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:43.760 
those are really important to get that
those<00:05:41.819> are<00:05:41.969> really<00:05:42.150> only<00:05:42.389> necessary<00:05:43.080> on<00:05:43.620> the

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:43.770 
those are really only necessary on the

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:46.640 
those are really only necessary on the
last<00:05:43.979> level<00:05:44.339> um<00:05:45.089> oh<00:05:45.449> one<00:05:45.930> thing<00:05:45.960> I<00:05:46.199> did<00:05:46.349> forget

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:57.180 
fire one and that is far better than the
