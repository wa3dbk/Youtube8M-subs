 this is all in the download section 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.630
 backgrounds and tones because as android words 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.630
 cam is that you can perform 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:59.850
 then the decoration of the images 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:01.620
 in this case for example we can take 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:03.360
 some photographic these can take 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.340

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.890
 albums 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:12.030
 I'm going to select any one that 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:14.820
 take here randomly a while ago and 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:17.760
 So here, look at everything you have 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:20.130
 what to do is give the symbol more and 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.830
 they choose they do not select the characters or 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:24.420
 the objects that they wish to incorporate if 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:27.300
 you want to incorporate the angry logo 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:29.100
 birds we want to place some of the 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:31.320
 birds 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:33.750
 even here they have the wave has the 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:36.900
 dynamite of the eggs and let's choose 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:38.670
 here to the king of the pigs when 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.680
 they select all the objects then 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.820
 they will appear here above and what 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.240
 have now simply that 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:45.310
 position it 

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:48.850
 this note that here they can then 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:51.720
 handle even to give you some 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:51.720
 effects let's go here 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:57.370
 sorry I got out of the camera look 

00:03:54.939 --> 00:04:00.220
 as the letters then they can 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:03.579
 position and then they are placing then 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:06.159
 all the characters look here for 

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:08.280
 at least this we can incorporate here 

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:08.280
 down 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:14.630
 and we put them here then to this other 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:17.150
 friend now put the eggs as 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:19.660
 we place for less than half and now 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:19.660
 we go 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.750
 as I do here 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:30.950
 this we can decorate it like this 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:34.130
 see how it is here they can save it 

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:35.570
 to share or eliminate or even 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:37.160
 return then the selection of 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:39.950
