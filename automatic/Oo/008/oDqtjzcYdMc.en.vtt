00:00:00.899 --> 00:00:06.819
 Hi everyone, glad to see you on my own 

00:00:03.759 --> 00:00:09.250
 channel today i would like to tell how 

00:00:06.819 --> 00:00:12.430
 can easily and quickly sharpen knives 1 

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:16.500
 grinder if suddenly you notice that 

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:21.240
 your grinder to turn the meat was bad 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:30.810
 can on at home sharpen 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:33.310
 knives and vtoril knife get it too knife 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.410
 in order to grind it is not necessary 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:42.360
 buy there any special loads 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:42.360
 i use sand paper like this 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:54.310
 we lay on a flat surface and press 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:56.430
 two fingers start circular 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:56.430
 movements 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:04.980
 rotate but i do it counterclockwise 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.980
 arrows 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:35.820
 in just a few seconds the knife became 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:37.010
 very sharp some more who have us 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.510
 completely stupid 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:41.510
 need of course will work a little longer 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:55.750
 The most important thing is that the knife is tight 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:55.750
 full surface sandpaper 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:03.240
 That's the way I sharpen knives 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:25.550
 now he is very sharp and we donâ€™t know 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:30.940
 camera is visible or not but very sharp then 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:30.940
 do the same thing with the lattice we lay down 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:47.659
 either side 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:21.079
 to improve the effect you can with your 

00:03:19.219 --> 00:03:28.599
 wet the surface with soapy sandpaper 

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:28.599
 water but I won't do it yet 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:55.650
 here so the same can be done with 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:55.650
 the other side of the lattice 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:23.720
 so here is so easy and relaxed in 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:26.230
 home conditions yourself can be literally 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:28.940
 five to ten minutes 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:31.520
 grind knife for meat grinder 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:36.850
 I will be glad if the video is to someone 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:36.850
 liked it all, thank you, bye
