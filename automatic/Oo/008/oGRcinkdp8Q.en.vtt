00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:41.020 
and I can't anyway um the next one our

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:43.770 
and I can't anyway um the next one our
plates<00:05:41.260> golf<00:05:41.500> or<00:05:42.120> choices<00:05:43.120> for<00:05:43.330> the<00:05:43.390> next<00:05:43.600> one

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:43.780 
plates golf or choices for the next one

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:45.210 
plates golf or choices for the next one
so<00:05:43.900> i'm<00:05:43.960> not<00:05:44.080> sure<00:05:44.140> if<00:05:44.350> that<00:05:44.380> gives<00:05:44.680> me<00:05:44.890> a<00:05:44.920> ten

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:45.220 
so i'm not sure if that gives me a ten

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:48.030 
so i'm not sure if that gives me a ten
percent<00:05:45.340> chance<00:05:45.730> or<00:05:45.970> two<00:05:46.360> percent<00:05:46.780> chance<00:05:47.040> so

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:48.040 
percent chance or two percent chance so

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:50.370 
percent chance or two percent chance so
be<00:05:48.220> five<00:05:48.670> purple<00:05:49.120> things<00:05:49.480> in<00:05:49.630> total<00:05:50.020> to<00:05:50.050> choose

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:50.380 
be five purple things in total to choose

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:56.430 
be five purple things in total to choose
from<00:05:51.570> so<00:05:52.570> hopefully<00:05:54.570> it's<00:05:55.570> not<00:05:55.780> that<00:05:55.960> case

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:56.440 
from so hopefully it's not that case

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:59.670 
from so hopefully it's not that case
