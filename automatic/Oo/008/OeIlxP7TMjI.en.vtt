00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:26.400
 we dance 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:30.910
 showroom so today you 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:33.010
 introduced my box of passage 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:36.879
 so there is a lot of stuff they have 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:39.309
 changed so at first started there 

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:43.210
 it is the GT500 so dna brown and blue to 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:44.739
 the handle to the experienced so this 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:46.780
 compartment that finally this 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:48.760
 comparatively is spreading which is in 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.360
 up and done like a species of 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.559
 stools that we put on for 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.300
 seal you think of a horse too much 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:57.760
 large letter groups where are 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.799
 your voice there and it can hold 45 kg but 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.710
 it's gone for me I dream I do 

00:00:59.799 --> 00:01:05.379
 exactly 1 45 and the other meaning 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:07.500
 here he was making little stickers 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:11.770
 full doubt and togo 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:13.210
 this is the little thing for 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.530
 put kids so there are a lot of 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.750
 things that are loaded apart from the 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:20.880
 first compartment so in the 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:23.229
 first mans party there is my soft brush 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.430
 that she is very very bad 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:27.790
 the members of the touch because she 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:30.490
 is really dusty there I'm going 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:32.500
 you show it in detail we are nothing 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:35.530
 soft hike finally me I call them the 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:38.200
 very round or hungry because strauss 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:40.000
 a little bit better I do not know because 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:44.439
 usually the world keys in the most 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:48.039
 big of the fne had the field badra game 

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:51.909
 well it reminds me of the foot mount 

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:56.439
 so it's a foot cure plus brush with 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:58.270
 at the pointy tip at the end so there is the 

00:01:56.439 --> 00:02:00.369
 brush that is much better rather than 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.649
 to use two to acquire 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:04.899
 rather than use the cap because 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:06.729
 that I finally cross villages 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:10.390
 really need if you do with the 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:12.660
 chaval h1 cap and we are less 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:17.100
 to inhabit the beginning elbows feet 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:20.470
 I would like to state here the early blow 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.420
 it's a little better but it's more if 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.150
 really of idea 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.880
 tired of using the plug after the 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.560
 put back on the starback is the 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.260
 red symbol then after to put it 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.550
 Body really clean my 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.280
 Landaise writer so she too 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.630
 dusty but fortunately according to him 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.870
 every corner because small 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:42.480
 mosquitoes begin to after to lose 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.770
 it's paul hilaire french he has 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.350
 a lot of hair do not know how 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:47.910
 said that would have to explain to me because I 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:50.849
 do not know how much I actually do 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.680
 understand the ponies the chin while 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:55.670
 in winter an elder will have to explain myself 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:58.940
 really so here's the plug after 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:02.790
 so here I have a very simple plug 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:05.220
 very jealous and now account 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.530
 there are enough short points I find 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:11.100
 I spent a little short we have a final 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:14.280
 a great big pain is a ringworm 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:16.680
 so do not use it to unravel 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.330
 it was to take off on the same 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.459
 if sometimes there is a copy of the ama that 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:22.709
 in my same at the same time 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:24.450
 that finally they themselves so that me and 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:26.220
 alain of momentum and a brush for 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.500
 the box of the coup I demets the demonstrates 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.959
 finally the footprint I run down beer is 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.930
 fears and after I can him to make 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:35.880
 net effects to my little mosquito 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:37.910
 well, even if he will have some super little ones 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:40.620
 because there is cyber little train 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:42.630
 but already I do it my good man is 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:45.600
 bad so that will test myself in my 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:47.690
 duo compartment after in the 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:52.890
 kaeppelin trick kappelin's compartment 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:55.380
 gold I have a bag for the lovers 10 to 1.7 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:57.690
 for the air show 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:01.430
 see the carrots of the carrots 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:04.350
 apples make lots of stuff like that 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:05.510
 I also ask those who are more 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:08.220
 experienced than me 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:10.950
 is chocolate good for 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:12.850
 the horses because they have linky who 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:15.220
 gave it to his horse 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:16.959
 I do not know if it's good or not me 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:19.060
 I do not think so but I ask you when 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:19.660
 even because we never know 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:24.360
 do not know too much 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:24.360
 after I have a scarf if it's cold 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:30.720
 Bottles of water 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:34.780

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:35.410
 an elastic a malaise like a 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:37.240
 elastic 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:39.610
 I was pretty big like that 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:42.960
 at home but mostly touched the full of 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:49.150

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:55.240
 not with others 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:57.640
 finally never when I go up because 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:00.040
 that when I say to myself that if we are a 

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:02.080
 splinter when we go up and cows pretty much 

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:04.600
 it can fly off it can be scary or 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:06.550
 horse so it made me like the world 

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:08.700
 all the time in a briefcase in a 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:10.990

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:42.640

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:57.450
 which my laptop may 2 still at 

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:59.600
 background so that it protects better 

00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:04.070
 after gmail

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:19.150
 there I put my esteem and anywhere to 

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:22.540
 presume my bag of treats 

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:26.290
 we have water bottles I put it as 

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:33.700
 here we know for the duo compartment 

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:40.970
 so is there for the compartment said 

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:44.930
 at r2 so first I take my mind 

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:47.150
 Finnish so there but here and there but 

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:48.470
 well deep down but if you have a 

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:50.540
 I do not think it's going very well 

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:52.340
 market it will work well but I will 

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:54.350
 advise the little ones you have 

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:59.450
 small and richard gasket like that does 

00:06:54.350 --> 00:07:02.300
 like that after that I take it 

00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:06.470
 my caps and I put it there he wants 

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:10.540
 push towards the end normally here it's 

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:15.140
 a small space where I have no mercy 

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:18.020
 and here after here I put my mind 

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:20.440
 my writing my sweet brush like that 

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:23.120
 why she was going a little space 

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:25.640
 to put a bedding world without 

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:26.780
 Even dairy instead of Mecca like this 

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:29.390
 on all the business because I 

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:32.320
 do not think it's not good I put it 

00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:34.820
 there I put my country and I put a 

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:37.420
 minimum of head but here I believe and I 

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:40.340
 did not really risk it in the east 

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:42.620
 in short, here is my sanding box and 

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:45.260
 how to eat it how songs 

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:47.300
 I rank it despite 500 as the 

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:48.500
 Sunday as you think but witness 

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:49.670
 comments I replied to my 

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:51.260
 question please is what the 

00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:53.000
 chocolate is good for horses 

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:54.590
 because I really saw a girl 

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:58.900
 in his prelate really gave some 

00:07:54.590 --> 00:08:03.230
 hot chocolate she even gave me the 

00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:03.850
 almost 2 1 how to say three or four 

00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:09.310
 parts 

00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:09.310
