00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:06.839

00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:08.790
 greet you gentlemen your shorts and 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.269

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.269

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.220
 hot tea 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.930
 all sap is more convenient to cook your right 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.150
 hand gesture called facepalm 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.400
 so how do i talk a lot 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.670
 the show is very cool very cool 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.170
 just super cool you know saw so much 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.070
 these servers tell themselves so many times 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:35.250
 and you can't be worse either 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:38.280
 and the worst series I talked about 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:41.550
 every third and always always wrong 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:44.940
 Pro come across such schoolchildren who 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:47.190
 complete on and the silliest mistakes in the most 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.100
 simple things why am I leading all this 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.379
 Now you yourself will understand everything today 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.129
 enjoy the show called 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:55.469
 zombie virus part 2 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.340
 although judging by the cap sung-based part i 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:01.760
 should have read 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.760
 zombie virus part 2 okay, let's go 

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:11.490
 Today virus that simply do not have hung 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.580
 never superfluous but hello 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:18.110
 before the show is nonsense 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:18.110
 although it is schoolchildren what I wonder 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:35.820
 show dork clicks me 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.329
 contusion in the right ear 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.250
 you remove it from the microphone and no one 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:44.700
 it seemed strange that a zombie says and 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.920
 Copper hit a man with a sword and then did not even 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:50.509
 resists and knows no sound but 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.509
 it is clear silence the brick and postpones 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:02.530
 Ivanovka 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.720
 don't lie you have no brain if you have 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:15.660
 would not have guessed what you are holding 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:20.440
 snow it will be vegetative time 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:22.690
 I will take away from there now the boy did not give up 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:26.080
 such a difficult word to utter a brain 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:28.420
 overheated oh yeah what am I what brains do u 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.130
 schoolboy zombie and we also found out that 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.410
 they shoot on some street server 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:44.500
 but the kickstarter message in the chat says 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:46.330
 for itself and so on 56 second second 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:55.620
 the schoolboy finally started talking better he 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:55.620
 silent and prey and I certainly stood you 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:09.239
 tasteless I put my channel on the fact that he 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.239
 threw the usual block of land 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:15.340
 you feel this moment as ambassador 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.300
 rejoiced at his guts to and bright 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.040
 emotions he experienced 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.720
 although normal people without guts live 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.150
 not long this guy could hold out 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:24.010
 some time though ok people without 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:28.680
 brains do not live these two feel 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:28.680
 himself quite comfortable without them he's delicious 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:46.380
 eat it my hand she I you on youtube that 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:46.380
 stuck zones flaps 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:04:13.909
 watched a barrel school 

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:19.180
 hard case now i will rub 

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:19.180
 lying on the grave I will go to bury myself 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:34.120
 but he sent the schoolboy himself to paradise 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:34.120
 my version of it in the area in full there look 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.750
 here explain these two inscriptions 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:46.300
 swing 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:48.970
 it's such an idea it's all right 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:51.340
 be on the script yes though and how are you 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:59.820
 devil height script and then hardly you 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:59.820
 speak but that 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:08.939
 no matter how many blunders in this series are 

00:05:06.599 --> 00:05:11.099
 traumatized my psyche the most 

00:05:08.939 --> 00:05:13.139
 I get the yellows and boston and spot in 

00:05:11.099 --> 00:05:16.039
 the center of the screen you understand that some people 

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:16.039
 forgot to set up bandicam 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:27.419
 so you want to say it 

00:05:25.439 --> 00:05:28.379
 schoolboy with a rooster voice called 

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:40.259
 petrovich 

00:05:28.379 --> 00:05:42.000
 I am one of you two for the first time 

00:05:40.259 --> 00:05:44.550
 the story of the zombie series runs away from 

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.889
 student that he still Julia after 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:06:11.719
 attack properly so that not a little 

00:05:46.889 --> 00:06:16.439
 it seemed I was sitting easier 

00:06:11.719 --> 00:06:18.629
 you never go out for reference this 

00:06:16.439 --> 00:06:20.939
 door wooden you open it button 

00:06:18.629 --> 00:06:22.589
 the required attribute is not that 

00:06:20.939 --> 00:06:29.599
 there was that there was no door you can open and 

00:06:22.589 --> 00:06:29.599
 without her, I took you away 

00:06:32.569 --> 00:06:44.719
 walked out the door at you now she's closed 

00:06:36.389 --> 00:06:44.719
 always wears a dog I had once 

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:58.210
 area and it was so long ago I have not seen 

00:06:55.389 --> 00:06:59.650
 such a rare bullshit me already fingers 

00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:01.780
 on hand is not enough that all the bread and 

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:03.520
 list at least me most 

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:05.680
 pleased with their stupidity complete absence 

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:07.690
 script and operator who tried 

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:10.419
 make your voice just below the game hit 

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:13.120
 it all caused me during the first 

00:07:10.419 --> 00:07:14.919
 watching the wild laugh of the series three of 

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:17.350
 ten in just some funny moments 

00:07:14.919 --> 00:07:20.350
 But in general, dislikes from me are dear 

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:22.660
 schoolchildren and you dear viewers can 

00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:25.229
