00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.860
 very important where everyone 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:51.340
 I was waiting to know in relation 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:56.140
 to Portuguese audio which version would be 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:02:01.910
 which is the double 5.1 digital in Portuguese 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:07.310
 and dubbing in Portuguese is the dubbing of 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:09.229
 89 made by gabriela ferreira then 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:12.380
 a lot of people were wanting this 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:14.720
 dubbing that was aaa the best in 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:18.860
 first dubbing is gabriela 's fall 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:24.470
 Ferreira 89 and that is still dubbing 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:28.190
 well that is very good voiceover is not 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:32.660
 confirmed on the blog she is 89 here 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:35.709
 taking the glove we have on the cover the 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.709
 same glove thing 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.939
 the spine of the studio 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.010
 the reverse is the same thing 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:03:00.050
 One thing I'm going to talk about here is the 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:04.770
 trailers at the beginning of this movie 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:09.120
 is already showed the trailer in blu-ray version 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:11.970
 from mogli the wolf boy who is my movie 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:16.230
 Favorite in disney without a doubt in 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:19.140
 first mobile and that was 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:21.840
 twisting to know was about dubbing 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:24.450
 and they put the original dubbing that 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.700
 did not have noble regulation I already have 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:31.500
 trailer waits now when it will be 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:35.130
 released in the little mermaid has the trailer 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:37.290
 of mobile on blu ray already warning about the 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:39.060
 sale but did not tell the date 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.430
 so here in back here to 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:49.890
 Little mermaid, we have a fitting only 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:52.650
 of advertisements here the disk in 3d already 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:57.720
 I put the disk in 3d it was pretty cool to 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:04:00.390
 aa quality image editing 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:02.550
 the depth is not much not much 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:05.280
 depth but but it is very interesting 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:07.640
 Well cool is worth seeing in 3d without 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.640
 doubt 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:14.300
 and here the disk in 2d 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:28.940
 Also cool to the image 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:35.440
 but the 3d image is much better and here 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:35.440
 an internal article quits 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:03.159
 so this is personal 

00:04:57.379 --> 00:05:03.159
