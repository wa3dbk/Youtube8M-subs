00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.210
 see man as a very clear trend 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.550
 that the count of that ornament for it 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.019
 window or on the door in front of the wall 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.509
 but how does it make exactly and how 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.469
 they look like this is an example 

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:15.240
 and we do that through such a 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.470
 hairs what you see here brackets 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.300
 its branch forest 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.970
 can make that for or like this where 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.560
 even a lantern hung on it 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.970
 you can choose to make hanging 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.980
 or lying down I find it lying down 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.380
 easiest they get 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.980
 this way down and get rid of me 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.960
 to work 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.300
 which I also very easily determine how 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.829
 long will be a piece so exactly me 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.829
 grab the pendulum in the first place 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:43.280
 that have length 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.280
 pack a knife very much 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.920
 and get off here I don't pick exactly 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.690
 same length 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.059
 I think that is the only thing I need 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.520
 to do is to put a button in it 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:54.870
 now I have the two very different to this 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.000
 those brackets are then I want next to it 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.309
 it some wind going to work in this case 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.620
 again the linen that is braided and 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.600
 I am not going to talk to anyone else in between 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.159
 and I am going to see that it is just that 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.659
 slightly longer than the other giel else 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.700
 each one low we by task the oak one 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.689
 beautiful v-shaped crack they can get 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.689
 I have this length 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.690
 the same on the other hand 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 now maybe go with the decorations 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.620
 most important thing is that you take care of it 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.870
 a balance is both i do in it 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:25.550
 middle top and the largest items and 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:27.890
 to the side and down I 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:30.020
 smaller items find that home 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:33.670
 I really want to have this on top of this 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.670
 heart pain pistols 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:39.280
 then look where you want we still have 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.280
 have this point 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:45.230
 look where your nice story is 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:48.280
 it this point then press it again and then 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:48.280
 the last rose last 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:55.100
 does 123 casually then this is nice 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:57.260
 place as next 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.790
 because of those wooden hearts there is then 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.530
 a loop yes I have a little shorter 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:05.660
 and you hang it on top of it 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:08.450
 upper parenthesis and a simple I go it 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:09.890
 on this side when strike down on the 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.880
 on the other hand for balance 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:15.380
 just longer so I keep it here 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.360
 and then I actually also want it at the bottom 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:20.150
 one I just have a knot here 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.700
 requests and then I didn't come up with small ones 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.850
 roses for the finishing touch 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.950
 more than I am going to finish more 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:30.110
 this is how you grab the next rose 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.790
 you have short again and this is how you go along 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.209
 decorate my full until then you think and 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.209
 i'm to 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.280
 so well i find the pink trail divided 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.019
 and as a finishing touch it is me 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.360
 nice to have that with this kind 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:48.730
 twigs to work but that iron wire there 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.860
 is crumbling a bit 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.390
 what becomes more playful and yes I am here 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.879
 just in between 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:57.099
 they can get geentje number there is also a 

00:02:54.879 --> 00:03:02.430
 other side too 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:02.430
 so you also make the trailer 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.970
 so well I think it is so complete 

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:08.970
 become fun
