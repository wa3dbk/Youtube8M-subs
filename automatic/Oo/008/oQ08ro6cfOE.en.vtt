00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.150
 hello how are you today I have a 

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:07.609
 solution to the problem that I have seen in 

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:10.219
 several forums and in some videos of 

00:00:07.609 --> 00:00:13.400
 youtube that solve it by deleting a 

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:15.740
 file of the iphone with some program 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.720
 and the kind of selection that I'm going to give you 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.939
 it's much simpler 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:23.119
 this happens and I realized when 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:25.449
 you connect your phone your iphone to a 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:25.449
 screen 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:32.920
 either plasma or some other kind of 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:36.670
 device for some reason headquarters 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:39.040
 configure or something happens and it does not take away 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.170
 the sound what is this we can see 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.070
 here 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.070
 that the volume 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:49.289
 does not come out does not play anything if it connects 

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:52.710
 one of the hearing aids because if we can hear 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:57.690
 something but in this case we do not have 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:01:00.439
 audio output via the iphone what 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.990
 I will do it is very simple simply 

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:05.930
 I realized that 

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:08.740
 when I connect it to the screen by 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.740
 middle of the hdmi 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:14.380
 will be unconfigured 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:18.480
 but the moment you plugged it in the 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.480
 stereo of my car the stereo 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:25.240
 there we have the sound as we can see 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.240
 yes 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.880
 okay 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:50.210
 and the sound we're hearing is because 

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:50.210
 middle of the stereo 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:56.380
 but in this case 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.380
 when I disconnected it 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:02.640
 as we see already recovers 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:04.530
 the ring volume 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.080
 Y 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:10.310
 if I play again 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:12.319
 the iphone already has sound 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.700
 this solution is very simple and not 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:15.349
 you can try having someone else 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.740
 device in the body defense and 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:19.920
 phone 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:22.350
 I suppose if they have a dock to 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.240
 speakers so that they sound horns 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:26.270
 External what could I do not have 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:29.360
 tried me but 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:31.100
 they could do it and I guess they should 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.700
 have some other device by which 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:36.290
 I'm doing this situation 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:39.190
 I hope you serve them and they like you 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.190
 Thank you
