to<00:00:18.750> pop<00:00:18.990> up<00:00:19.050> on<00:00:19.350> my<00:00:19.380> screen<00:00:19.760> before<00:00:20.760> I<00:00:20.970> said<00:00:21.180> I

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
to pop up on my screen before I said I

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.689 
to pop up on my screen before I said I
actually<00:00:21.539> know<00:00:21.960> who<00:00:22.170> I<00:00:22.230> play<00:00:22.500> in<00:00:22.680> these<00:00:22.800> two

actually know who I play in these two
games<00:00:23.970> and<00:00:24.269> i<00:00:24.840> figured<00:00:25.140> i<00:00:25.289> would<00:00:25.470> show<00:00:25.680> since<00:00:26.340> i

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
games and i figured i would show since i

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.150 
games and i figured i would show since i
am<00:00:26.580> getting<00:00:26.849> a<00:00:26.910> lot<00:00:27.119> of<00:00:27.150> minutes<00:00:27.449> now<00:00:27.599> i

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:28.160 
am getting a lot of minutes now i

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.930 
am getting a lot of minutes now i
figured<00:00:29.160> i<00:00:29.340> would<00:00:29.550> show<00:00:30.349> two<00:00:31.349> games<00:00:31.619> each<00:00:31.949> part

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
figured i would show two games each part

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.310 
figured i would show two games each part
as<00:00:33.149> opposed<00:00:34.110> to<00:00:34.380> the<00:00:34.620> normal<00:00:34.980> three<00:00:35.550> and<00:00:36.320> then

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
as opposed to the normal three and then

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.510 
as opposed to the normal three and then
try<00:00:37.950> and<00:00:37.980> show<00:00:38.820> this<00:00:39.120> series<00:00:39.510> more<00:00:40.370> because<00:00:41.370> if

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
try and show this series more because if

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.260 
try and show this series more because if

i don't have to play the third game it

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.639 
i don't have to play the third game it
