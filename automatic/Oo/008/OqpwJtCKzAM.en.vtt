one

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:35.400 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:41.770 

you<00:00:35.850> just<00:00:36.060> might<00:00:36.210> want<00:00:36.480> to<00:00:36.600> get<00:00:36.690> it

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:41.780 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.120 

what<00:00:42.440> we<00:00:42.559> have<00:00:42.770> here<00:00:42.800> basically

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:46.130 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:51.100 

is<00:00:47.440> definitely<00:00:48.440> a<00:00:48.740> well<00:00:48.980> packed<00:00:49.930> bubble<00:00:50.930> wrap

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:51.110 
is definitely a well packed bubble wrap

00:00:51.110 --> 00:01:00.600 
is definitely a well packed bubble wrap
everywhere<00:00:55.450> and<00:00:56.620> a<00:00:57.620> grand<00:00:57.890> star<00:00:58.250> destroyer

open i really don't damage that while
I'm<00:02:46.410> building<00:02:46.830> it<00:02:46.920> because<00:02:47.130> it's<00:02:47.280> very

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
I'm building it because it's very

00:02:47.430 --> 00:03:02.360 
I'm building it because it's very
possible<00:02:52.100> good-sized<00:02:53.100> bridge<00:03:01.130> bottom<00:03:02.130> pieces

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
possible good-sized bridge bottom pieces

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.490

I<00:03:05.959> can't<00:03:06.959> speak<00:03:07.230> to<00:03:07.260> its<00:03:07.530> accuracy<00:03:08.810> but<00:03:13.760> it's

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
I can't speak to its accuracy but it's

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.190 
I can't speak to its accuracy but it's
definitely<00:03:14.970> really<00:03:15.510> really<00:03:15.930> sharp

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
definitely really really sharp

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:21.110 
definitely really really sharp
everywhere<00:03:16.890> every<00:03:17.790> single<00:03:18.150> line<00:03:20.120> you'd

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
everywhere every single line you'd

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.930 
everywhere every single line you'd
really<00:03:21.269> think<00:03:21.660> this<00:03:21.840> was<00:03:21.989> machined<00:03:22.670> I'd<00:03:23.670> like

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
really think this was machined I'd like

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:28.449 
really think this was machined I'd like
some<00:03:24.150> kind<00:03:24.390> of<00:03:24.510> heavy<00:03:24.930> plastic

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:28.459 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:36.730 

central<00:03:29.459> spine<00:03:29.790> nice

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:36.740 

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:38.530 

I've<00:03:37.310> been<00:03:37.520> thinking<00:03:37.730> that<00:03:38.090> it<00:03:38.210> might<00:03:38.240> just

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
I've been thinking that it might just

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.230 
I've been thinking that it might just
seal<00:03:38.840> down<00:03:39.050> the<00:03:39.260> bottom<00:03:39.910> like<00:03:40.910> a<00:03:40.940> regular

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:41.240 
seal down the bottom like a regular

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:45.790 
seal down the bottom like a regular
commercial<00:03:41.720> kit<00:03:42.110> would<00:03:44.350> but<00:03:45.350> that<00:03:45.620> is<00:03:45.770> a

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:45.800 
commercial kit would but that is a

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:49.570 
commercial kit would but that is a
really<00:03:46.100> nice<00:03:46.400> touch<00:03:47.590> and<00:03:48.590> it's<00:03:48.740> really<00:03:48.830> tight

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:49.580 
really nice touch and it's really tight

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:54.430 
really nice touch and it's really tight
fit<00:03:49.910> all<00:03:50.750> along<00:03:51.140> their<00:03:52.450> minor<00:03:53.450> minor<00:03:53.870> amounts

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:54.440 
fit all along their minor minor amounts

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.790 
fit all along their minor minor amounts
of<00:03:54.530> mold<00:03:54.740> flashing<00:03:55.340> there<00:03:55.520> but<00:03:56.800> negligible

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:57.800 
of mold flashing there but negligible

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:59.500 
of mold flashing there but negligible

how great it is and especially for the

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:23.719 
how great it is and especially for the
price<00:04:22.260> that<00:04:22.380> it<00:04:22.680> was<00:04:22.800> going<00:04:23.070> around<00:04:23.190> out<00:04:23.580> at

00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:23.729 
price that it was going around out at

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:26.420 
price that it was going around out at
the<00:04:23.850> time<00:04:24.320> it<00:04:25.320> was<00:04:25.410> a<00:04:25.470> few<00:04:25.740> hundred<00:04:25.860> dollars

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
the time it was a few hundred dollars

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:32.559 
the time it was a few hundred dollars
but<00:04:26.669> wow<00:04:26.880> this<00:04:27.120> really<00:04:27.330> shows

00:04:32.559 --> 00:04:32.569 

00:04:32.569 --> 00:04:49.530 

here<00:04:33.569> we<00:04:33.720> go<00:04:33.870> landing<00:04:34.740> Bay

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:49.540 

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:51.390 

so<00:04:50.080> there's<00:04:50.260> at<00:04:50.380> least<00:04:50.410> three<00:04:50.650> pieces<00:04:51.040> put

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:51.400 
so there's at least three pieces put

00:04:51.400 --> 00:05:03.560 
so there's at least three pieces put
together<00:04:51.520> that's<00:04:51.940> a<00:04:52.030> really<00:04:52.390> great<00:04:52.510> size<00:04:52.870> too

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:03.570 

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:06.780 

then<00:05:04.570> two<00:05:04.840> sets<00:05:05.080> of<00:05:05.200> trenches<00:05:05.680> should<00:05:06.430> be<00:05:06.550> a

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:06.790 
then two sets of trenches should be a

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:15.740 
then two sets of trenches should be a
couple<00:05:06.940> more<00:05:07.330> out<00:05:07.600> there's<00:05:07.990> one<00:05:10.290> there's<00:05:11.290> two

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:15.750 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:18.170 

so<00:05:16.350> let<00:05:16.740> me<00:05:16.770> lay<00:05:17.070> all<00:05:17.220> the<00:05:17.370> pieces<00:05:17.580> out<00:05:17.850> here

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:18.180 
so let me lay all the pieces out here

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:21.620 
so let me lay all the pieces out here
and<00:05:18.830> see<00:05:19.830> what<00:05:19.860> we<00:05:20.040> got<00:05:20.310> is<00:05:20.640> definitely<00:05:21.390> a<00:05:21.420> lot
