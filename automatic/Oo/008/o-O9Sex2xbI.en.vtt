you feel about them going back to the
stage<00:04:14.970> I<00:04:15.359> mean<00:04:16.079> they<00:04:16.200> started<00:04:16.530> they<00:04:16.650> pulled<00:04:16.890> a

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:16.979 
stage I mean they started they pulled a

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:18.800 
stage I mean they started they pulled a
lot<00:04:17.130> of<00:04:17.250> it<00:04:17.340> together<00:04:17.640> I<00:04:17.940> feel<00:04:18.299> like<00:04:18.419> they<00:04:18.570> made

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
lot of it together I feel like they made

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:20.000 
lot of it together I feel like they made
they<00:04:19.200> should<00:04:19.350> have<00:04:19.440> taken<00:04:19.560> like<00:04:19.799> maybe

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
they should have taken like maybe

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:21.380 
they should have taken like maybe
another<00:04:20.160> minute<00:04:20.519> so<00:04:20.640> like<00:04:20.789> make<00:04:21.090> sure<00:04:21.239> that

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:21.390 
another minute so like make sure that

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:22.279 
another minute so like make sure that
they<00:04:21.479> knew<00:04:21.720> what<00:04:21.840> they<00:04:21.870> were<00:04:21.989> going<00:04:22.079> to<00:04:22.140> do

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:22.289 
they knew what they were going to do

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:23.990 
they knew what they were going to do
perhaps<00:04:22.860> think<00:04:23.250> about<00:04:23.370> the<00:04:23.460> strategy<00:04:23.880> yeah

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
perhaps think about the strategy yeah

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.100 
perhaps think about the strategy yeah
because<00:04:24.210> if<00:04:24.419> I<00:04:24.510> they<00:04:24.630> just<00:04:24.780> like<00:04:24.900> yeah<00:04:25.020> they
