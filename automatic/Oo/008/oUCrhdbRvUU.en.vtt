bad I could go 80 and 80 and four and

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.170 
bad I could go 80 and 80 and four and
then<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:37.620> next<00:00:37.649> game<00:00:38.280> go<00:00:38.520> for<00:00:38.790> and<00:00:38.940> 80<00:00:39.030> it

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
then the next game go for and 80 it

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.110 
then the next game go for and 80 it
seemed<00:00:39.390> like<00:00:39.570> so<00:00:39.840> really<00:00:40.520> really<00:00:41.520> hard<00:00:41.760> for<00:00:42.030> me

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
seemed like so really really hard for me

seemed like so really really hard for me
to<00:00:42.210> play<00:00:42.360> that<00:00:42.510> game<00:00:42.570> it<00:00:42.960> was<00:00:43.020> it<00:00:43.260> was<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.500> most

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
to play that game it was it was the most

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.500 
to play that game it was it was the most
difficult<00:00:43.770> call<00:00:44.280> of<00:00:44.399> duty<00:00:44.579> that<00:00:44.700> I've<00:00:44.820> had<00:00:45.000> to

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
difficult call of duty that I've had to

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:46.639 
difficult call of duty that I've had to
play<00:00:45.690> and<00:00:45.870> it's<00:00:45.960> not<00:00:46.079> like<00:00:46.200> I<00:00:46.289> couldn't<00:00:46.469> get

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
play and it's not like I couldn't get

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.560 
play and it's not like I couldn't get
decent<00:00:47.190> scoring<00:00:47.460> killed<00:00:48.000> games<00:00:48.239> I<00:00:48.360> mean<00:00:48.510> I

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
decent scoring killed games I mean I

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.119 
decent scoring killed games I mean I
definitely<00:00:48.629> could<00:00:49.110> get<00:00:49.230> some<00:00:49.350> 80<00:00:49.500> pluses<00:00:49.920> but

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
definitely could get some 80 pluses but

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.799 
definitely could get some 80 pluses but
it<00:00:50.489> was<00:00:50.640> so<00:00:50.760> inconsistent<00:00:51.000> that<00:00:51.420> I<00:00:51.449> just<00:00:51.690> did

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
it was so inconsistent that I just did

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.990 
it was so inconsistent that I just did
not<00:00:51.930> have<00:00:52.079> any<00:00:52.230> fun<00:00:52.410> with<00:00:52.559> it<00:00:52.680> now<00:00:52.820> they<00:00:53.820> did

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
not have any fun with it now they did

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.869 
not have any fun with it now they did
its<00:00:54.239> skill<00:00:54.899> based<00:00:55.199> matchmaking<00:00:56.010> as<00:00:56.550> well<00:00:56.730> as

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
its skill based matchmaking as well as

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.209 
its skill based matchmaking as well as
like<00:00:57.090> off<00:00:57.570> of<00:00:57.780> a<00:00:57.870> host<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:58.260> whatever<00:00:58.770> you<00:00:59.129> know

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
like off of a host and whatever you know

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.470 
like off of a host and whatever you know
I'm<00:00:59.280> not<00:00:59.399> the<00:00:59.460> most<00:00:59.640> technical<00:01:00.059> person<00:01:00.329> with

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
I'm not the most technical person with

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.569 
I'm not the most technical person with
this<00:01:01.350> sort<00:01:01.620> of<00:01:01.680> stuff<00:01:01.829> but<00:01:02.160> I<00:01:02.219> do<00:01:02.340> know<00:01:02.550> that

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
this sort of stuff but I do know that

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.719 
this sort of stuff but I do know that
obviously<00:01:03.059> skill<00:01:03.629> base<00:01:03.809> was<00:01:03.989> kind<00:01:04.170> of<00:01:04.199> a<00:01:04.320> weird

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:04.729 
obviously skill base was kind of a weird

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:07.690 
obviously skill base was kind of a weird
combination<00:01:05.729> to<00:01:06.090> do<00:01:06.210> along<00:01:06.840> with

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700 
combination to do along with

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.620 
combination to do along with
geographical<00:01:08.700> locations<00:01:09.240> and<00:01:09.390> everything

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
geographical locations and everything

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.570 
geographical locations and everything
else<00:01:09.780> I<00:01:09.960> mean<00:01:10.080> it<00:01:10.170> made<00:01:10.680> it<00:01:10.799> kind<00:01:10.920> of<00:01:11.040> difficult

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
else I mean it made it kind of difficult

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.690 
else I mean it made it kind of difficult
to<00:01:12.090> make<00:01:12.390> sure<00:01:12.600> that<00:01:12.810> you<00:01:13.740> got<00:01:13.920> in<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.400> proper

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
to make sure that you got in the proper

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.520 
to make sure that you got in the proper
lobby<00:01:14.880> with<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.479> proper<00:01:15.990> people<00:01:16.170> that<00:01:16.409> you

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
lobby with the proper people that you

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.380 
lobby with the proper people that you
should<00:01:16.710> probably<00:01:16.799> be<00:01:17.100> playing<00:01:17.610> against<00:01:18.000> now<00:01:18.150> I

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
should probably be playing against now I

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.090 
should probably be playing against now I
guess<00:01:18.900> some<00:01:19.290> of<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.439> changes<00:01:19.590> that<00:01:19.830> they're

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
guess some of the changes that they're

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.460 
guess some of the changes that they're
going<00:01:20.189> to<00:01:20.280> be<00:01:20.369> doing<00:01:21.049> according<00:01:22.049> two<00:01:22.170> drifters

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
going to be doing according two drifters

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.770 
going to be doing according two drifters
video<00:01:22.710> could<00:01:23.610> potentially<00:01:24.119> help<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.600> lag

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
video could potentially help the lag

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.510 
video could potentially help the lag
compensation<00:01:25.290> but<00:01:25.560> makes<00:01:26.189> me<00:01:26.280> kind<00:01:26.490> of

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
compensation but makes me kind of

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.980 
compensation but makes me kind of
curious<00:01:26.580> what<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.450> difference<00:01:27.780> was<00:01:27.930> that

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
curious what the difference was that

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.289 
curious what the difference was that
they've<00:01:28.320> done<00:01:28.590> from<00:01:29.310> let's<00:01:29.850> say<00:01:30.000> modern

something better it's always like two
steps<00:01:52.259> forward<00:01:52.530> and<00:01:52.740> three<00:01:52.829> steps<00:01:52.979> back<00:01:53.460> in<00:01:53.670> my

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
steps forward and three steps back in my

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.179 
steps forward and three steps back in my
opinion<00:01:54.060> modern<00:01:54.659> warfare<00:01:54.780> 2<00:01:55.020> to<00:01:55.320> me<00:01:55.439> was<00:01:55.740> was

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
opinion modern warfare 2 to me was was

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.249 
opinion modern warfare 2 to me was was
great<00:01:56.549> the<00:01:56.969> connections<00:01:57.390> in<00:01:57.509> this<00:01:57.630> game<00:01:57.840> were

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
great the connections in this game were

00:01:58.259 --> 00:01:59.929 
great the connections in this game were
great<00:01:58.469> if<00:01:58.619> you<00:01:58.710> had<00:01:58.860> a<00:01:58.890> gameplay<00:01:59.549> where<00:01:59.729> it<00:01:59.850> was

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
great if you had a gameplay where it was

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.240 
great if you had a gameplay where it was
a<00:01:59.969> bad<00:02:00.210> connection<00:02:00.500> it<00:02:01.500> you<00:02:01.680> know<00:02:01.799> it<00:02:01.920> wasn't

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
a bad connection it you know it wasn't

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.859 
a bad connection it you know it wasn't
the<00:02:02.310> best<00:02:02.490> but<00:02:02.640> at<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:02.969> same<00:02:03.149> time<00:02:03.329> when<00:02:03.810> you

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
the best but at the same time when you

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.350 
the best but at the same time when you
got<00:02:04.020> a<00:02:04.049> good<00:02:04.229> connection<00:02:04.530> it<00:02:04.890> was<00:02:05.210> good<00:02:06.210> for

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
got a good connection it was good for

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.690 
got a good connection it was good for
you<00:02:06.479> at<00:02:06.600> least<00:02:06.630> and<00:02:06.960> and<00:02:07.290> it<00:02:07.770> was<00:02:07.979> a<00:02:08.009> it<00:02:08.520> was<00:02:08.550> a

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
you at least and and it was a it was a

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.729 
you at least and and it was a it was a
toss-up<00:02:09.119> but<00:02:10.020> you<00:02:10.170> knew<00:02:10.349> that<00:02:10.530> it<00:02:10.619> was<00:02:10.709> a

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
toss-up but you knew that it was a

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.520 
toss-up but you knew that it was a
toss-up<00:02:11.129> it's<00:02:11.849> games<00:02:12.270> like<00:02:12.450> black<00:02:12.629> ops<00:02:12.840> 2

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
toss-up it's games like black ops 2

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.110 
toss-up it's games like black ops 2
it's<00:02:14.069> a<00:02:14.130> little<00:02:14.220> bit<00:02:14.340> different<00:02:14.670> because<00:02:14.730> I

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
it's a little bit different because I

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.760 
it's a little bit different because I
could<00:02:15.360> have<00:02:15.450> a<00:02:15.510> four<00:02:15.780> bar<00:02:15.930> and<00:02:16.200> I<00:02:16.440> could<00:02:16.680> be

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
could have a four bar and I could be

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.140 
could have a four bar and I could be
hosting<00:02:17.160> and<00:02:17.370> I<00:02:17.400> could<00:02:17.550> still<00:02:17.790> be<00:02:17.819> playing

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
hosting and I could still be playing

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.390 
hosting and I could still be playing
like<00:02:18.360> shit<00:02:18.680> modern<00:02:19.680> warfare<00:02:19.800> two<00:02:20.040> if<00:02:20.190> you<00:02:20.280> had

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
like shit modern warfare two if you had

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.890 
like shit modern warfare two if you had
a<00:02:20.430> four<00:02:20.670> bar<00:02:20.790> you<00:02:20.970> knew<00:02:21.120> you<00:02:21.240> had<00:02:21.390> some<00:02:21.630> sort<00:02:21.870> of

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
a four bar you knew you had some sort of

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.199 
a four bar you knew you had some sort of
a<00:02:22.020> slight<00:02:22.260> advantage<00:02:22.520> same<00:02:23.520> thing<00:02:23.790> for<00:02:23.819> when

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
a slight advantage same thing for when

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:25.640 
a slight advantage same thing for when
you<00:02:24.300> had<00:02:24.420> a<00:02:24.450> 3<00:02:24.690> bar<00:02:24.840> you<00:02:25.020> knew<00:02:25.140> you<00:02:25.319> were<00:02:25.440> at

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
you had a 3 bar you knew you were at

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.160 
you had a 3 bar you knew you were at
some<00:02:25.830> sort<00:02:26.069> of<00:02:26.100> slight<00:02:26.400> disadvantage<00:02:26.760> so<00:02:27.240> the

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
some sort of slight disadvantage so the

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.590 
some sort of slight disadvantage so the
fact<00:02:28.380> that<00:02:28.470> that<00:02:28.860> yes<00:02:29.100> you<00:02:29.850> have<00:02:30.030> host

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
fact that that yes you have host

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.420 
fact that that yes you have host
advantages<00:02:31.170> and<00:02:31.319> disadvantages<00:02:31.980> is<00:02:32.220> one

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
advantages and disadvantages is one

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:33.710 
advantages and disadvantages is one
thing<00:02:32.610> but<00:02:32.730> the<00:02:32.819> fact<00:02:33.030> that<00:02:33.120> the<00:02:33.569> lag

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
thing but the fact that the lag

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.120 
thing but the fact that the lag
compensation<00:02:34.200> was<00:02:34.440> set<00:02:34.590> up<00:02:34.680> the<00:02:35.010> way

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
compensation was set up the way

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.580 
compensation was set up the way
whichever<00:02:35.489> way<00:02:35.700> it<00:02:35.819> was<00:02:35.970> you<00:02:36.540> can<00:02:36.750> actually

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
whichever way it was you can actually

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.400 
whichever way it was you can actually
play<00:02:37.800> and<00:02:38.100> compensate<00:02:38.819> yourself<00:02:39.209> to<00:02:39.660> the<00:02:39.870> the

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
play and compensate yourself to the the

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.050 
play and compensate yourself to the the
connection<00:02:40.770> that<00:02:40.860> you<00:02:40.890> had<00:02:41.100> la<00:02:41.610> cops<00:02:41.850> to

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
connection that you had la cops to

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.270 
connection that you had la cops to
completely<00:02:42.510> went<00:02:42.720> away<00:02:42.810> with<00:02:43.050> that<00:02:43.170> like<00:02:43.410> if<00:02:44.190> I

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
completely went away with that like if I

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.800 
completely went away with that like if I
have<00:02:44.400> a<00:02:44.459> four<00:02:44.700> bar<00:02:44.819> again<00:02:45.120> it<00:02:45.270> just<00:02:45.300> it<00:02:45.600> doesn't

with that i think that's honestly the

that<00:03:17.820> they're<00:03:17.940> going<00:03:18.060> to<00:03:18.120> make<00:03:18.209> steps<00:03:18.450> forward

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
that they're going to make steps forward

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:20.630 
that they're going to make steps forward
or<00:03:19.079> not<00:03:19.110> it<00:03:19.590> sounds<00:03:19.950> like<00:03:19.980> from<00:03:20.370> what<00:03:20.459> he<00:03:20.579> said

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
or not it sounds like from what he said

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.280

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
that we're going to do connections

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:23.780 
that we're going to do connections
versus<00:03:22.620> where<00:03:22.799> you<00:03:22.920> are<00:03:23.070> on<00:03:23.190> the<00:03:23.280> net<00:03:23.459> versus

where you are on the globe and that

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.190 
where you are on the globe and that
could<00:03:25.650> potentially<00:03:25.950> change<00:03:26.519> things<00:03:27.090> but<00:03:28.019> I

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
could potentially change things but I

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.830 
could potentially change things but I
don't<00:03:28.620> I<00:03:28.769> honestly<00:03:29.160> don't<00:03:29.459> know<00:03:29.579> how<00:03:30.540> it's

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
don't I honestly don't know how it's

don't I honestly don't know how it's
going<00:03:30.959> to<00:03:31.019> end<00:03:31.200> up<00:03:31.650> happening<00:03:32.010> I<00:03:32.250> just<00:03:32.430> know

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610 
going to end up happening I just know

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:34.009 
going to end up happening I just know
that<00:03:32.790> they're<00:03:33.180> definitely<00:03:33.329> making<00:03:33.630> some<00:03:33.780> sort

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
that they're definitely making some sort

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:35.630 
that they're definitely making some sort
of<00:03:34.110> changes<00:03:34.470> at<00:03:34.680> least<00:03:34.860> from<00:03:35.370> what<00:03:35.489> he<00:03:35.610> said

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
of changes at least from what he said

of changes at least from what he said
that<00:03:36.030> they're<00:03:36.239> hearing<00:03:36.510> that<00:03:37.110> it<00:03:37.650> was<00:03:37.829> a

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
that they're hearing that it was a

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:40.460 
that they're hearing that it was a
problem<00:03:38.190> I<00:03:38.459> just<00:03:39.180> I'm<00:03:39.450> kind<00:03:40.140> of<00:03:40.200> feel<00:03:40.440> like

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
problem I just I'm kind of feel like

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.090 
problem I just I'm kind of feel like
I've<00:03:40.680> lost<00:03:40.829> faith<00:03:42.170> with<00:03:43.170> the<00:03:43.290> newer<00:03:43.410> game<00:03:43.620> and

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
I've lost faith with the newer game and

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.009 
I've lost faith with the newer game and
and<00:03:44.400> they're<00:03:45.090> they're<00:03:45.390> going<00:03:45.540> to<00:03:45.600> just<00:03:45.900> go

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
and they're they're going to just go

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:47.420 
and they're they're going to just go
through<00:03:46.049> and<00:03:46.440> completely<00:03:47.040> wreck<00:03:47.280> things

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
through and completely wreck things

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.130 
through and completely wreck things
again<00:03:47.760> and<00:03:47.790> try<00:03:48.359> to<00:03:48.420> compensate<00:03:48.720> and<00:03:48.989> then

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
again and try to compensate and then

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.470 
again and try to compensate and then
make<00:03:49.530> things<00:03:49.769> worse<00:03:50.519> again<00:03:50.730> but<00:03:51.000> that's<00:03:51.359> just
