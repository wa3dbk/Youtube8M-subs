00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
going to navy and here still playing

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.000

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
there in the background comes back and

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.620 
there in the background comes back and
even<00:00:23.730> though<00:00:23.820> continues<00:00:24.210> playing<00:00:24.359> the<00:00:24.510> only

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
even though continues playing the only

even though continues playing the only
thing<00:00:24.779> is<00:00:24.930> muted<00:00:25.260> for<00:00:25.529> a<00:00:25.590> moment<00:00:25.830> is<00:00:26.160> the<00:00:26.460> music

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.529 
thing is muted for a moment is the music
i<00:00:28.369> think<00:00:29.369> you<00:00:29.460> can<00:00:29.609> do<00:00:29.699> the<00:00:29.820> same<00:00:29.849> yep<00:00:30.210> it's<00:00:30.390> got

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
i think you can do the same yep it's got

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.970 
i think you can do the same yep it's got
the<00:00:30.630> on-screen<00:00:30.869> back<00:00:31.529> to<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:31.830> wards<00:00:32.189> a<00:00:32.420> DVD

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:33.980 
the on-screen back to the wards a DVD

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:40.470 
the on-screen back to the wards a DVD
generally<00:00:34.980> a<00:00:35.040> bit<00:00:35.160> quicker

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:40.480 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:01:11.640 

so<00:00:41.050> let's<00:00:41.290> just<00:00:41.470> test<00:00:41.680> up<00:00:41.890> there

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:11.650 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:13.860 

looks<00:01:12.370> like<00:01:12.460> regular<00:01:12.880> dvds<00:01:13.300> load<00:01:13.480> up<00:01:13.630> a<00:01:13.720> lot

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:13.870

I mentioned in another review I'm not as

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.240 
I mentioned in another review I'm not as
sensitive<00:03:02.720> as<00:03:02.930> I<00:03:03.110> would<00:03:03.260> like<00:03:03.470> it<00:03:03.799> could<00:03:04.129> be<00:03:04.159> a

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
sensitive as I would like it could be a

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.069 
sensitive as I would like it could be a
bit<00:03:04.400> quicker<00:03:04.760> you<00:03:05.420> know<00:03:05.540> if<00:03:05.599> you're<00:03:05.750> really<00:03:05.870> in

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:06.079 
bit quicker you know if you're really in

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:07.750 
bit quicker you know if you're really in
a<00:03:06.109> rush<00:03:06.200> to<00:03:06.560> turn<00:03:06.739> the<00:03:06.829> volume<00:03:07.129> up<00:03:07.220> or<00:03:07.400> down<00:03:07.579> it

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
a rush to turn the volume up or down it

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:14.140 
a rush to turn the volume up or down it
might<00:03:07.879> take<00:03:08.120> you<00:03:08.299> a<00:03:08.329> fair<00:03:08.569> bit<00:03:11.980> the

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
to their ipod this is likely to be a bit

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.960 
to their ipod this is likely to be a bit
of<00:03:20.989> a<00:03:21.049> bottle<00:03:21.379> in<00:03:22.040> conjunction<00:03:22.489> with<00:03:22.610> the<00:03:22.760> fact

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
of a bottle in conjunction with the fact

of a bottle in conjunction with the fact
that<00:03:23.060> as<00:03:23.239> i<00:03:23.360> mentioned<00:03:23.689> in<00:03:23.750> a<00:03:23.810> previous<00:03:23.840> review

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
that as i mentioned in a previous review

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:33.370 
that as i mentioned in a previous review
it<00:03:24.650> doesn't<00:03:25.310> charge<00:03:25.489> my<00:03:25.760> ipod<00:03:27.069> bring<00:03:28.069> up

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.020 

although<00:03:34.100> if<00:03:34.220> you<00:03:34.280> can<00:03:34.430> make<00:03:34.550> that<00:03:34.670> up<00:03:34.820> very

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
although if you can make that up very

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:36.280 
although if you can make that up very
well<00:03:35.090> but<00:03:35.480> that's<00:03:35.630> pretty<00:03:35.750> much<00:03:35.870> is<00:03:36.050> running

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
well but that's pretty much is running

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:44.830 
well but that's pretty much is running
off<00:03:36.350> the<00:03:36.380> ipods<00:03:36.800> of<00:03:36.920> tunnel<00:03:37.160> batteries<00:03:43.480> the<00:03:44.480> TV

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 
I've been understood as pretty much akin

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.680 
I've been understood as pretty much akin
to<00:03:53.900> most<00:03:54.470> digital<00:03:54.830> TV<00:03:55.310> tuners<00:03:55.670> but<00:03:56.450> when<00:03:56.600> you

also mentioned in my previous unit was

also mentioned in my previous unit was
we<00:04:05.720> thought<00:04:05.750> that<00:04:05.930> the<00:04:06.200> navigation<00:04:07.090> had<00:04:08.090> to<00:04:08.180> be

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:08.270 
we thought that the navigation had to be

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:10.900 
we thought that the navigation had to be
loaded<00:04:08.450> up<00:04:08.720> it<00:04:09.220> will<00:04:10.220> need<00:04:10.370> to<00:04:10.400> be<00:04:10.520> done<00:04:10.700> this

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:10.910 
loaded up it will need to be done this

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:13.270 
loaded up it will need to be done this
if<00:04:11.150> you<00:04:11.420> left<00:04:12.080> it<00:04:12.230> at<00:04:12.320> the<00:04:12.350> navigation<00:04:12.980> screen

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:13.280 
if you left it at the navigation screen

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:17.050 
if you left it at the navigation screen
like<00:04:14.440> so<00:04:15.440> when<00:04:15.830> your<00:04:15.950> last<00:04:16.220> using<00:04:16.549> the<00:04:16.640> vehicle

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:17.060 
like so when your last using the vehicle

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.110 
like so when your last using the vehicle
it<00:04:17.570> will<00:04:17.870> load<00:04:18.080> up<00:04:18.110> but<00:04:19.070> if<00:04:19.160> it's<00:04:19.370> virtually

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.120 
it will load up but if it's virtually

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.640 
it will load up but if it's virtually
your<00:04:20.299> side<00:04:20.480> with<00:04:20.630> the<00:04:20.690> car<00:04:20.900> and<00:04:21.260> say<00:04:21.560> the<00:04:21.680> radio

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:23.650 
your side with the car and say the radio

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:25.690 
your side with the car and say the radio
it<00:04:24.650> will<00:04:24.770> actually<00:04:24.860> automatically<00:04:25.370> load<00:04:25.580> it

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:25.700 
it will actually automatically load it

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:46.690 
it will actually automatically load it
in<00:04:25.790> the<00:04:25.820> background<00:04:26.330> while<00:04:26.420> cars<00:04:26.900> first<00:04:27.140> stop

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:46.700 

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:49.690 

is<00:04:47.240> that<00:04:47.420> it<00:04:47.540> for<00:04:47.720> my<00:04:47.810> review<00:04:47.840> today<00:04:48.460> this<00:04:49.460> is<00:04:49.550> a

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:49.700 
is that it for my review today this is a

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:52.320 
is that it for my review today this is a
follow-up<00:04:49.970> of<00:04:50.120> the<00:04:50.240> previous<00:04:50.630> reviews

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:52.330 
follow-up of the previous reviews

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.490 
follow-up of the previous reviews
specifically<00:04:53.330> about<00:04:53.480> the<00:04:53.600> sound<00:04:54.290> quality

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:54.500 
specifically about the sound quality

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:56.290 
specifically about the sound quality
which<00:04:54.890> we're<00:04:55.040> going<00:04:55.160> to<00:04:55.310> test<00:04:55.670> last<00:04:55.910> time<00:04:56.180> in

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:56.300 
which we're going to test last time in

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:59.500 
which we're going to test last time in
the<00:04:56.360> unit<00:04:57.580> again<00:04:58.580> from<00:04:58.790> what<00:04:58.940> I<00:04:58.970> can<00:04:59.060> tell<00:04:59.210> this

00:04:59.500 --> 00:04:59.510 
the unit again from what I can tell this

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:01.960 
the unit again from what I can tell this
unit<00:04:59.840> is<00:04:59.930> a<00:05:00.110> significant<00:05:00.710> step<00:05:00.830> up<00:05:01.160> from<00:05:01.760> all

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:01.970 
unit is a significant step up from all

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:03.580 
unit is a significant step up from all
the<00:05:02.060> units<00:05:02.300> I've<00:05:02.450> seen<00:05:02.810> and<00:05:03.050> played<00:05:03.350> with

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:03.590 
the units I've seen and played with

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:06.160 
the units I've seen and played with
before<00:05:04.030> it<00:05:05.030> even<00:05:05.150> seems<00:05:05.510> to<00:05:05.690> be<00:05:05.780> a<00:05:05.810> bit<00:05:05.870> better

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:06.170 
before it even seems to be a bit better

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:11.250 
before it even seems to be a bit better
than<00:05:06.350> my<00:05:06.500> factory<00:05:06.890> GPS<00:05:07.340> unit<00:05:07.700> in<00:05:07.790> some<00:05:07.940> regards

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:11.260 

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.140 

with<00:05:12.260> some<00:05:12.530> slight<00:05:13.100> alterations<00:05:13.790> I<00:05:13.970> can

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:14.150 
with some slight alterations I can

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:15.940 
with some slight alterations I can
easily<00:05:14.240> see<00:05:14.540> this<00:05:14.720> unit<00:05:15.050> becoming<00:05:15.620> direct

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:15.950 
easily see this unit becoming direct

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:17.710 
easily see this unit becoming direct
