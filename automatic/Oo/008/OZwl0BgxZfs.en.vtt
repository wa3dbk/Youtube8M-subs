here um I went to a test one gig versus

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.870 
here um I went to a test one gig versus
two<00:00:09.150> kink<00:00:09.480> for<00:00:09.809> mid-range<00:00:10.349> cards<00:00:11.070> now<00:00:11.250> I<00:00:11.490> want

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
two kink for mid-range cards now I want

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.259 
two kink for mid-range cards now I want
to<00:00:11.910> make<00:00:12.059> this<00:00:12.210> a<00:00:12.269> fair<00:00:12.900> test<00:00:14.059> easily<00:00:15.059> if<00:00:15.150> I

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
to make this a fair test easily if I

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.240 
to make this a fair test easily if I
turn<00:00:15.540> and<00:00:15.809> tightly<00:00:16.470> listing<00:00:16.800> all<00:00:16.920> the<00:00:17.010> way<00:00:17.100> up

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
turn and tightly listing all the way up

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.750 
turn and tightly listing all the way up
settings<00:00:18.090> all<00:00:18.390> the<00:00:18.960> way<00:00:19.109> up<00:00:19.320> text<00:00:20.070> resolution

settings all the way up text resolution

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.960 
settings all the way up text resolution
all<00:00:20.910> the<00:00:21.480> way<00:00:21.600> up<00:00:21.840> I'm<00:00:22.680> gonna<00:00:23.310> get<00:00:23.609> a<00:00:23.640> very

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
all the way up I'm gonna get a very

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.870 
all the way up I'm gonna get a very
biased<00:00:24.619> answer<00:00:25.619> so<00:00:25.949> why<00:00:26.039> did<00:00:26.279> I<00:00:26.430> turn<00:00:26.490> the

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
biased answer so why did I turn the

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.200 
biased answer so why did I turn the
settings<00:00:27.240> down<00:00:27.420> instead<00:00:28.289> of<00:00:28.439> 8<00:00:28.710> X<00:00:28.949> AAA<00:00:29.640> or

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
settings down instead of 8 X AAA or

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.330 
settings down instead of 8 X AAA or
excuse<00:00:30.539> me<00:00:30.570> MSA<00:00:31.230> I<00:00:31.260> turned<00:00:31.710> down<00:00:31.800> four<00:00:32.160> notches

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
excuse me MSA I turned down four notches

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.720 
excuse me MSA I turned down four notches
the<00:00:33.030> SMA<00:00:33.510> which<00:00:34.230> weren't<00:00:34.469> cars<00:00:34.739> a<00:00:35.070> bit<00:00:35.489> less

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
the SMA which weren't cars a bit less

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.670 
the SMA which weren't cars a bit less
power<00:00:36.030> it's<00:00:36.540> very<00:00:36.719> reasonable<00:00:37.320> for<00:00:37.500> like<00:00:37.649> a

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
power it's very reasonable for like a

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.069 
power it's very reasonable for like a
mid-range<00:00:38.100> cart<00:00:38.460> texture<00:00:39.210> resolution<00:00:39.360> stay

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.990 
doing this video so what I'll do is let
me<00:01:26.909> timeout<00:01:27.210> right<00:01:27.540> now<00:01:27.750> it<00:01:27.990> is<00:01:28.200> 201<00:01:29.100> a.m.<00:01:29.549> my

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
me timeout right now it is 201 a.m. my

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.399 
me timeout right now it is 201 a.m. my
time<00:01:30.329> which<00:01:30.630> at<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:30.900> bottom<00:01:31.170> left<00:01:31.350> hand

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
time which at the bottom left hand

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.120 
time which at the bottom left hand
corner<00:01:31.619> and<00:01:32.390> it'll<00:01:33.390> be<00:01:33.659> about<00:01:33.869> -<00:01:34.229> OH<00:01:34.259> -<00:01:34.409> maybe

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.740 
corner and it'll be about - OH - maybe
the<00:01:35.280> two<00:01:35.460> through<00:01:35.790> in<00:01:35.850> this<00:01:35.909> video<00:01:36.180> ends<00:01:36.450> when

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750
