unholy<00:01:01.410> dps<00:01:01.739> well<00:01:02.309> i<00:01:02.579> know<00:01:02.850> that<00:01:02.969> frost<00:01:03.480> is

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
unholy dps well i know that frost is

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.950 
unholy dps well i know that frost is
like<00:01:04.100> priority<00:01:05.100> system<00:01:05.309> I<00:01:05.700> think<00:01:06.150> currently

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
like priority system I think currently

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.370 
like priority system I think currently
and<00:01:07.590> I<00:01:08.280> think<00:01:08.640> it'll<00:01:08.760> stay<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.450> same<00:01:09.659> though<00:01:10.350> I

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
and I think it'll stay the same though I

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.740 
and I think it'll stay the same though I
do<00:01:10.920> have<00:01:10.979> to<00:01:11.159> say<00:01:11.280> one<00:01:11.700> thing<00:01:11.880> at<00:01:12.150> least<00:01:12.330> about

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
do have to say one thing at least about

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.160 
do have to say one thing at least about
frost<00:01:13.140> 3<00:01:13.799> is<00:01:14.070> that<00:01:14.580> it<00:01:15.330> really<00:01:15.689> doesn't<00:01:16.080> have

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
frost 3 is that it really doesn't have

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.520 
frost 3 is that it really doesn't have
the<00:01:16.470> type<00:01:16.680> of<00:01:16.710> talents<00:01:17.610> that<00:01:17.820> for<00:01:18.030> example<00:01:18.530> or

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
the type of talents that for example or

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.999 
the type of talents that for example or
gain<00:01:19.860> mates<00:01:20.100> has<00:01:20.400> which<00:01:20.909> is<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:22.009> counterspell

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
gain mates has which is the counterspell

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.100 
gain mates has which is the counterspell
talent<00:01:23.430> if<00:01:23.640> you<00:01:23.909> can<00:01:24.210> dispel<00:01:24.600> something

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
talent if you can dispel something

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.609 
talent if you can dispel something
you'll<00:01:25.619> get<00:01:25.830> spell<00:01:26.159> power<00:01:26.369> certain<00:01:27.210> amount

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:27.619 
you'll get spell power certain amount

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:31.609 
you'll get spell power certain amount
from<00:01:28.619> it<00:01:28.799> that's<00:01:29.790> really<00:01:30.360> not<00:01:30.509> a<00:01:30.810> lot<00:01:31.079> of<00:01:31.320> that

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
from it that's really not a lot of that

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.440 
from it that's really not a lot of that
type<00:01:31.860> of<00:01:31.890> talents<00:01:32.759> here<00:01:33.060> I<00:01:33.090> don't<00:01:33.390> think

because i really like talents that give

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.469 
because i really like talents that give
you<00:01:40.110> constant<00:01:40.439> benefit<00:01:41.159> rather<00:01:41.850> than<00:01:42.180> those

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
you constant benefit rather than those

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.889 
you constant benefit rather than those
that<00:01:42.720> are<00:01:42.899> situational<00:01:43.799> like<00:01:44.070> the

00:01:44.889 --> 00:01:44.899 
that are situational like the

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:48.020 
that are situational like the
counterspell<00:01:45.899> one<00:01:46.170> because<00:01:46.979> you<00:01:47.340> really

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
counterspell one because you really

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.030 
counterspell one because you really
don't<00:01:48.180> know<00:01:48.479> at<00:01:48.930> this<00:01:49.290> point<00:01:49.409> how<00:01:49.799> much

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
don't know at this point how much

counter<00:01:50.579> spelling<00:01:50.909> York<00:01:51.210> on<00:01:51.360> you<00:01:51.540> do<00:01:51.750> if<00:01:52.470> it<00:01:52.799> is

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
counter spelling York on you do if it is

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.880 
counter spelling York on you do if it is
worth<00:01:53.280> to<00:01:53.310> put<00:01:53.850> those<00:01:54.180> points<00:01:54.780> in<00:01:54.930> it<00:01:55.170> or<00:01:55.409> just

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
worth to put those points in it or just

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:01.490 
worth to put those points in it or just
skip<00:01:56.460> it<00:01:57.320> so<00:01:58.320> in<00:01:58.560> my<00:01:59.219> mind<00:01:59.250> frost<00:01:59.850> is<00:02:00.500> looking

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
skip it so in my mind frost is looking

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.639 
skip it so in my mind frost is looking
good<00:02:01.680> from<00:02:01.979> that<00:02:02.280> perspective<00:02:03.110> but<00:02:04.110> now<00:02:04.259> one

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
good from that perspective but now one

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.980 
good from that perspective but now one
what's<00:02:04.920> the<00:02:05.130> main<00:02:05.369> point<00:02:05.640> in<00:02:06.119> the<00:02:06.270> video<00:02:06.390> which

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
what's the main point in the video which

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.180 
what's the main point in the video which
was<00:02:07.259> their<00:02:07.770> new<00:02:08.129> root<00:02:08.459> system<00:02:09.000> so<00:02:09.950> well<00:02:10.950> the

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
was their new root system so well the

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.830 
was their new root system so well the
best<00:02:11.370> way<00:02:11.489> to<00:02:11.640> show<00:02:11.819> it<00:02:11.970> to<00:02:12.150> you<00:02:12.480> is<00:02:12.750> to<00:02:12.780> use<00:02:13.290> it

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
best way to show it to you is to use it

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.100 
best way to show it to you is to use it
so<00:02:14.769> let's<00:02:15.310> go<00:02:15.519> ahead<00:02:15.550> and<00:02:15.790> use<00:02:16.150> icy<00:02:16.420> tots<00:02:16.690> twice

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
so let's go ahead and use icy tots twice

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.309 
so let's go ahead and use icy tots twice
and<00:02:17.440> then<00:02:17.620> plague<00:02:17.950> strike<00:02:18.489> as<00:02:19.180> you<00:02:19.780> can<00:02:19.870> see<00:02:20.050> my

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:20.319 
and then plague strike as you can see my

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:23.910 
and then plague strike as you can see my
room's<00:02:20.680> got<00:02:20.950> used<00:02:21.310> up<00:02:21.610> there<00:02:22.180> but<00:02:22.989> only<00:02:23.620> one

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
room's got used up there but only one

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.900 
room's got used up there but only one
from<00:02:24.280> its<00:02:24.489> type<00:02:24.879> is<00:02:25.590> recharging<00:02:26.590> that's<00:02:27.489> the

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
from its type is recharging that's the

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:31.050 
from its type is recharging that's the
main<00:02:28.120> change<00:02:28.629> in<00:02:28.959> the<00:02:29.230> room<00:02:29.410> system<00:02:30.010> only<00:02:30.670> one

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
main change in the room system only one

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.470 
main change in the room system only one
type<00:02:31.390> of<00:02:31.420> room<00:02:31.870> can<00:02:32.290> be<00:02:32.790> well<00:02:33.790> one<00:02:34.090> of<00:02:34.209> each

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
type of room can be well one of each

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.240 
type of room can be well one of each
type<00:02:35.400> room<00:02:36.400> can<00:02:36.670> of<00:02:36.910> runes<00:02:37.629> can<00:02:38.019> be<00:02:38.290> recharging

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
type room can of runes can be recharging

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.900 
type room can of runes can be recharging
at<00:02:39.489> one<00:02:39.760> time<00:02:40.090> so<00:02:41.220> that<00:02:42.220> will<00:02:42.340> change<00:02:42.580> a<00:02:42.730> lot<00:02:42.849> of

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
at one time so that will change a lot of

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:46.080 
at one time so that will change a lot of
your<00:02:43.209> rotations<00:02:43.930> really<00:02:44.349> because<00:02:44.769> now<00:02:45.700> if<00:02:45.910> you

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
your rotations really because now if you

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.140 
your rotations really because now if you
do<00:02:46.569> this<00:02:46.870> then<00:02:47.230> you<00:02:47.890> really<00:02:48.549> gonna<00:02:48.700> use<00:02:48.940> those

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
do this then you really gonna use those

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.309 
do this then you really gonna use those
spells<00:02:49.569> for<00:02:50.319> a<00:02:50.349> while<00:02:50.730> and<00:02:51.730> when<00:02:52.150> you<00:02:52.329> can<00:02:52.660> you

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:53.319 
spells for a while and when you can you

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:55.470 
spells for a while and when you can you
just<00:02:53.560> go<00:02:53.709> use<00:02:53.739> it<00:02:54.160> and<00:02:54.340> then<00:02:54.760> similar<00:02:55.209> weight

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
just go use it and then similar weight

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.490 
just go use it and then similar weight
so<00:02:56.489> I'm<00:02:57.489> bidding<00:02:57.760> that'll<00:02:58.239> change<00:02:58.510> rotations

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
so I'm bidding that'll change rotations

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.240 
so I'm bidding that'll change rotations
a<00:02:59.680> lot<00:03:00.510> I'm<00:03:01.510> not<00:03:01.629> sure<00:03:01.870> how<00:03:02.440> they<00:03:02.709> are<00:03:02.829> gonna<00:03:03.010> go

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
a lot I'm not sure how they are gonna go

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.530 
a lot I'm not sure how they are gonna go
and<00:03:04.650> yeah<00:03:05.650> I<00:03:05.680> have<00:03:05.950> no<00:03:06.129> clue<00:03:06.310> of<00:03:06.400> that<00:03:06.849> really

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
and yeah I have no clue of that really

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.350 
and yeah I have no clue of that really
because<00:03:08.290> as<00:03:08.769> I<00:03:08.829> said<00:03:09.099> I<00:03:09.340> don't<00:03:09.610> play<00:03:09.790> at<00:03:09.910> abs

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360 
because as I said I don't play at abs

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.910 
because as I said I don't play at abs
deathknight<00:03:11.230> I<00:03:11.739> don't<00:03:12.489> really<00:03:12.819> like<00:03:12.970> melee

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
deathknight I don't really like melee

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.039 
deathknight I don't really like melee
characters<00:03:14.920> except<00:03:15.430> broke<00:03:15.810> which<00:03:16.810> I'm

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:17.049 
characters except broke which I'm

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:20.069 
characters except broke which I'm
leveling<00:03:17.470> in<00:03:18.130> beta<00:03:18.549> and<00:03:18.760> i<00:03:19.120> will<00:03:19.269> make<00:03:19.569> one<00:03:19.870> in

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:20.079 
leveling in beta and i will make one in

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:23.759 
leveling in beta and i will make one in
life<00:03:20.319> but<00:03:20.739> yeah<00:03:21.329> i'm<00:03:22.329> getting<00:03:22.750> awfully<00:03:23.620> off

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:23.769 
life but yeah i'm getting awfully off

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:27.330 
life but yeah i'm getting awfully off
topic<00:03:24.160> here<00:03:24.569> but<00:03:25.569> yeah<00:03:26.530> let's<00:03:26.739> go<00:03:26.889> back<00:03:27.100> so

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
topic here but yeah let's go back so

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.059 
topic here but yeah let's go back so
that's<00:03:28.180> pretty<00:03:28.540> much<00:03:28.720> the<00:03:28.780> main<00:03:29.049> chains<00:03:29.470> in

00:03:30.059 --> 00:03:30.069 
that's pretty much the main chains in

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:33.690 
that's pretty much the main chains in
this<00:03:30.459> rune<00:03:31.239> system<00:03:31.750> and<00:03:32.190> well<00:03:33.190> there's<00:03:33.519> the

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
this rune system and well there's the

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.819 
this rune system and well there's the
change<00:03:33.970> that<00:03:34.180> haste<00:03:34.450> now<00:03:34.810> affects<00:03:35.230> this

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:35.829 
change that haste now affects this

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:39.420 
change that haste now affects this
regeneration<00:03:36.519> rate<00:03:37.030> so<00:03:38.250> they'll<00:03:39.250> be

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
regeneration rate so they'll be

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.339 
regeneration rate so they'll be
interesting<00:03:39.970> to<00:03:40.120> see<00:03:40.239> how<00:03:40.269> much<00:03:40.630> haste<00:03:41.079> a

00:03:41.339 --> 00:03:41.349 
interesting to see how much haste a

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:45.150 
interesting to see how much haste a
fixed<00:03:41.829> it<00:03:42.069> really<00:03:42.819> all<00:03:43.150> cozy<00:03:43.690> and<00:03:43.950> yeah<00:03:44.950> I've

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.160 
fixed it really all cozy and yeah I've

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.539 
fixed it really all cozy and yeah I've
got<00:03:45.549> it<00:03:45.700> it's<00:03:46.109> well<00:03:47.109> seven<00:03:47.410> percent<00:03:47.829> for<00:03:48.160> me<00:03:48.340> at

00:03:48.539 --> 00:03:48.549 
got it it's well seven percent for me at

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:53.610 
got it it's well seven percent for me at
the<00:03:48.849> moment<00:03:48.880> so<00:03:49.359> I<00:03:51.180> wonder<00:03:52.180> if<00:03:52.299> I<00:03:52.419> could<00:03:52.660> I<00:03:52.930> need

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
the moment so I wonder if I could I need

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.979 
the moment so I wonder if I could I need
test<00:03:54.040> this<00:03:54.370> without<00:03:54.760> my<00:03:54.910> haste<00:03:55.389> gear<00:03:55.720> to<00:03:55.840> see

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:55.989 
test this without my haste gear to see

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:58.559 
test this without my haste gear to see
how<00:03:56.139> much<00:03:56.349> slower<00:03:56.680> it<00:03:57.099> is<00:03:57.280> without<00:03:57.639> any<00:03:58.030> haste

00:03:58.559 --> 00:03:58.569 
how much slower it is without any haste

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:01.470 
how much slower it is without any haste
but<00:03:59.560> I<00:03:59.680> think<00:03:59.739> doesn't<00:04:00.430> mean<00:04:00.549> that<00:04:00.760> haste<00:04:01.150> will

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 
but I think doesn't mean that haste will

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:05.930 
but I think doesn't mean that haste will
be<00:04:01.720> a<00:04:02.290> stat<00:04:02.919> that<00:04:03.480> designate<00:04:04.480> will<00:04:04.840> one<00:04:05.169> of

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
be a stat that designate will one of

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:09.390 
be a stat that designate will one of
course<00:04:06.940> there's<00:04:07.299> not<00:04:07.510> much<00:04:07.900> that's<00:04:08.530> left<00:04:08.980> one

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
course there's not much that's left one

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.390 
course there's not much that's left one
because<00:04:09.849> I'm<00:04:10.180> opener<00:04:10.889> penetration<00:04:11.889> is<00:04:12.040> corn

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 
because I'm opener penetration is corn

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:17.120 
because I'm opener penetration is corn
and<00:04:13.230> yeah<00:04:14.230> oh<00:04:14.500> yeah<00:04:15.190> bit<00:04:15.430> games<00:04:15.730> there<00:04:16.239> I'm<00:04:16.539> so

all I really have to say about death

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:42.220 
all I really have to say about death
