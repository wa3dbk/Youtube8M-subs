00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:18.990
 that outfit must also take something 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.820
 because in this way jump into it 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.080
 also does not look good in nature and 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.080
 then we will do something about it 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.679
 Yes 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.210
 this is indeed much better 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:38.370
 have even more tips 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:39.239
 yes if you wash your clothes you have 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.850
 a problem 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.340
 because image like deer foxes swine 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.989
 they can see a certain substance 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.460
 is in the fabric softener 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.829
 that sounds strange but they can be kind 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.629
 see a blue glow over your clothes and 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.470
 afterwards she smells very strong 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.970
 of course 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:55.800
 so try washing your clothes without 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:57.000
 detergent and without fabric softener 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.100
 In addition, it is of course important that 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.870
 You have no perfume on it and whatever one 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.089
 own air that you spray on in the morning 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.040
 is something that can do very well 

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:07.710
 smell your clothes therefore example 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.210
 hang out outside for two nights 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.670
 take all odors out and take it 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.540
 scent of nature at a last tip 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.060
 and that is 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.650
 take into account the wind the wind is rising 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.509
 moment from there 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.670
 so we go against the wind is moving around 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.659
 prevent the wild smell from us 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.070
 diamond 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.560
 that last bit of what you smell 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.780
 do they smell that anyway and to that 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:36.179
 prevent us from going against the wind 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:38.299
 move when speech is possible too 

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:38.299
 stay 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:48.200
 we are now going to try to become a fox 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.820
 and if you never want to 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.840
 Then you really need to take care of something quickly 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:54.140
 have a low position 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:57.380
 The advantage of that is that you just go on 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:06.200
 eye level comes with that fox and that you 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:07.520
 becomes part of his world like you 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.290
 can try to take a picture of the 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.060
 next bird and you fly anyway 

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:13.730
 in the end always it happens to me 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.380
 sometimes unfortunately but a good trick 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.060
 what you can do is the following 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:22.190
 I can in your own back yard 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:24.080
 hang up fat balls and peanut garland 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.550
 but according to also love water it is 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.750
 also a crib with a small 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:29.270
 little water in it 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.500
 decoys closer and if you really 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:32.300
 To do well you make course 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.100
 use a shrill straw and then 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.140
 you stay away from the birds 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.520
 you place a nice branch and on that 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:42.080
 way you get in a nice way 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:43.910
 the photo I have nice nature photos too 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.430
 make such a camera necessary or can it 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:48.320
 also with a simple camera 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.510
 no, a simple device is also natural 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:53.630
 enough to take beautiful photos with 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:55.160
 such a large device is beautiful and it is 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.989
 handy it always animals closer 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.580
 but it is also very heavy and sometimes 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:00.470
 difficult work 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:03.780
 if you keep on tips that I can bring 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:05.130

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.959

 simple device the animals on a whole 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.750
