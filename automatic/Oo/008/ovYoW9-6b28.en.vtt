00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:13.570 
you can do is you can just right click

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:16.260 
you can do is you can just right click
on<00:03:13.870> that<00:03:14.020> copy<00:03:14.890> it<00:03:15.160> drop<00:03:15.880> it<00:03:16.000> on<00:03:16.090> dropbox

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:16.270 
on that copy it drop it on dropbox

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:18.450 
on that copy it drop it on dropbox
somewhere<00:03:16.930> keep<00:03:17.410> this<00:03:17.590> one<00:03:17.800> in<00:03:17.830> there<00:03:18.130> so<00:03:18.400> you

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:18.460 
somewhere keep this one in there so you

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:20.820 
somewhere keep this one in there so you
just<00:03:18.550> have<00:03:18.850> it<00:03:19.030> in<00:03:19.150> there<00:03:19.720> but<00:03:20.020> you<00:03:20.500> can<00:03:20.650> back

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:20.830 
just have it in there but you can back

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:23.040 
just have it in there but you can back
up<00:03:21.010> that<00:03:21.160> sh<00:03:21.520> sh<00:03:21.850> blob<00:03:22.150> in<00:03:22.360> the<00:03:22.450> future<00:03:22.840> if<00:03:22.960> a

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:23.050 
up that sh sh blob in the future if a

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:25.050 
up that sh sh blob in the future if a
tool<00:03:23.290> comes<00:03:23.710> out<00:03:23.920> not<00:03:24.370> guaranteeing<00:03:24.910> that

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
tool comes out not guaranteeing that

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.660 
tool comes out not guaranteeing that
there<00:03:25.540> will<00:03:25.810> be<00:03:25.990> a<00:03:26.020> joke<00:03:26.290> or<00:03:26.530> a<00:03:26.560> downgrade<00:03:27.100> 48.3

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
there will be a joke or a downgrade 48.3

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.960 
there will be a joke or a downgrade 48.3
but<00:03:29.160> people<00:03:30.160> have<00:03:30.280> told<00:03:30.490> me<00:03:30.640> that<00:03:30.730> the

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
but people have told me that the

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.050 
but people have told me that the
possibility<00:03:31.600> is<00:03:31.630> pretty<00:03:32.290> high<00:03:32.500> so<00:03:33.160> if<00:03:33.580> that

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
possibility is pretty high so if that

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.030 
possibility is pretty high so if that
does<00:03:34.450> indeed<00:03:34.810> happen<00:03:35.260> you'll<00:03:35.410> be<00:03:35.560> able<00:03:35.650> to<00:03:35.800> use

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
does indeed happen you'll be able to use

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.580 
does indeed happen you'll be able to use
this<00:03:36.450> you'll<00:03:37.450> when<00:03:37.660> you'll<00:03:37.960> probably<00:03:38.290> need

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
this you'll when you'll probably need

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.580 
this you'll when you'll probably need
this<00:03:39.120> sh-sh<00:03:40.120> blob<00:03:40.390> in<00:03:40.570> order<00:03:40.930> to<00:03:41.410> facilitate

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
this sh-sh blob in order to facilitate

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:43.890 
this sh-sh blob in order to facilitate
that<00:03:42.250> downgrade<00:03:42.850> if<00:03:43.120> you<00:03:43.270> don't<00:03:43.510> have<00:03:43.690> this

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
that downgrade if you don't have this

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.210 
that downgrade if you don't have this
then<00:03:44.110> you're<00:03:44.200> putting<00:03:44.500> yourself<00:03:44.560> in<00:03:44.890> a<00:03:44.950> much

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
then you're putting yourself in a much

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.780 
then you're putting yourself in a much
worse<00:03:45.250> position<00:03:46.060> for<00:03:46.959> a<00:03:46.990> downgrade

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
worse position for a downgrade

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:50.610 
worse position for a downgrade
possibility<00:03:48.790> so<00:03:49.060> make<00:03:49.450> sure<00:03:49.480> even<00:03:50.470> if<00:03:50.560> you're

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
possibility so make sure even if you're

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.290 
possibility so make sure even if you're
not<00:03:50.680> jailbroken<00:03:51.220> right<00:03:51.370> now<00:03:51.490> save<00:03:51.790> your<00:03:51.910> SHSH

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:52.300 
not jailbroken right now save your SHSH

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:54.030 
not jailbroken right now save your SHSH
blobs<00:03:52.510> it's<00:03:53.020> the<00:03:53.140> least<00:03:53.320> you<00:03:53.440> can<00:03:53.620> do<00:03:53.800> it<00:03:53.950> only

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
blobs it's the least you can do it only

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.760 
blobs it's the least you can do it only
takes<00:03:54.310> a<00:03:54.459> few<00:03:54.550> seconds<00:03:55.360> and<00:03:55.570> it<00:03:55.900> just<00:03:56.110> sort<00:03:56.680> of

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:56.770 
takes a few seconds and it just sort of

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:58.380 
takes a few seconds and it just sort of
gives<00:03:57.040> you<00:03:57.130> a<00:03:57.190> peace<00:03:57.400> of<00:03:57.430> mind<00:03:57.760> even<00:03:58.000> if<00:03:58.150> there

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:58.390 
gives you a peace of mind even if there

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:00.300 
gives you a peace of mind even if there
doesn't<00:03:58.959> happen<00:03:59.140> to<00:03:59.350> be<00:03:59.500> a<00:03:59.530> downgrade<00:03:59.890> at

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310 
doesn't happen to be a downgrade at

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:02.430 
doesn't happen to be a downgrade at
least<00:04:00.459> you<00:04:00.580> know<00:04:00.730> you<00:04:00.790> had<00:04:01.270> the<00:04:01.900> possibility

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440 
least you know you had the possibility

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.320 
least you know you had the possibility
or<00:04:03.130> at<00:04:03.340> least<00:04:03.520> made<00:04:03.700> it<00:04:03.820> possible<00:04:04.000> for

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:04.330 
or at least made it possible for

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:07.140 
or at least made it possible for
yourself<00:04:04.840> don't<00:04:05.530> let<00:04:05.770> the<00:04:06.580> signing<00:04:06.910> window

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150 
yourself don't let the signing window

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.900 
yourself don't let the signing window
48.3<00:04:07.660> close<00:04:08.020> without<00:04:08.320> doing<00:04:08.860> this<00:04:09.040> so<00:04:09.280> that<00:04:09.760> is

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:09.910 
48.3 close without doing this so that is

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:11.610 
48.3 close without doing this so that is
how<00:04:10.030> you<00:04:10.060> do<00:04:10.360> it<00:04:10.510> on<00:04:10.630> a<00:04:10.660> Mac<00:04:11.050> now<00:04:11.320> I'm<00:04:11.410> going<00:04:11.560> to

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620 
how you do it on a Mac now I'm going to

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.370 
how you do it on a Mac now I'm going to
show<00:04:11.650> you<00:04:11.830> how<00:04:11.920> you<00:04:12.130> do<00:04:12.400> it<00:04:12.520> on<00:04:12.640> windows<00:04:13.380> okay

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:14.380 
show you how you do it on windows okay

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:15.990 
show you how you do it on windows okay
so<00:04:14.440> i've<00:04:14.680> downloaded<00:04:14.830> tinyumbrella<00:04:15.580> on

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 
so i've downloaded tinyumbrella on

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.780 
so i've downloaded tinyumbrella on
windows<00:04:16.420> this<00:04:16.930> is<00:04:17.140> again<00:04:17.620> the<00:04:17.650> bundle<00:04:18.340> package

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:18.790 
windows this is again the bundle package

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:21.690 
windows this is again the bundle package
so<00:04:18.940> it<00:04:18.970> includes<00:04:19.299> the<00:04:19.660> java<00:04:19.930> runtime<00:04:20.489> so<00:04:21.489> we'll

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:21.700 
so it includes the java runtime so we'll

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:23.970 
so it includes the java runtime so we'll
just<00:04:21.880> open<00:04:22.000> up<00:04:22.180> tinyumbrella<00:04:22.570> here

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:23.980 
just open up tinyumbrella here

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:27.360 
just open up tinyumbrella here
that<00:04:24.250> folder<00:04:24.930> and<00:04:25.930> again<00:04:26.530> my<00:04:26.680> device<00:04:26.950> is<00:04:27.160> not

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.370 
that folder and again my device is not

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:30.240 
that folder and again my device is not
connected<00:04:28.120> to<00:04:28.630> my<00:04:29.050> computer<00:04:29.080> yet<00:04:29.590> for<00:04:30.190> this

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.250 
connected to my computer yet for this

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:32.400 
connected to my computer yet for this
demonstration<00:04:30.600> alright<00:04:31.600> so<00:04:31.810> the<00:04:32.080> interface

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:32.410 
demonstration alright so the interface

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:34.050 
demonstration alright so the interface
looks<00:04:32.560> very<00:04:32.830> similar<00:04:33.070> to<00:04:33.280> the<00:04:33.430> mac<00:04:33.670> interface

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:34.060 
looks very similar to the mac interface

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:36.720 
looks very similar to the mac interface
right<00:04:34.410> so<00:04:35.410> all<00:04:35.440> you<00:04:35.740> need<00:04:35.770> to<00:04:35.920> do<00:04:36.130> is<00:04:36.340> just<00:04:36.370> plug

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:36.730 
right so all you need to do is just plug

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:39.450 
right so all you need to do is just plug
your<00:04:36.760> device<00:04:36.970> in<00:04:37.740> to<00:04:38.740> your<00:04:38.800> computer<00:04:38.920> like

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:39.460 
your device in to your computer like

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:45.450 
your device in to your computer like
this<00:04:42.960> so<00:04:43.960> it<00:04:43.990> recognize<00:04:44.500> my<00:04:44.740> phone<00:04:45.010> and<00:04:45.220> there

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:45.460 
this so it recognize my phone and there

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.580 
this so it recognize my phone and there
it<00:04:45.550> goes<00:04:45.760> so<00:04:46.030> it's<00:04:46.150> connected<00:04:46.600> and<00:04:46.810> just<00:04:47.440> like

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:47.590 
it goes so it's connected and just like

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:49.500 
it goes so it's connected and just like
on<00:04:47.710> the<00:04:47.800> Mac<00:04:47.980> it's<00:04:48.220> fetching<00:04:48.430> the<00:04:48.700> SHSH<00:04:49.480> blobs

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:49.510 
on the Mac it's fetching the SHSH blobs

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:51.960 
on the Mac it's fetching the SHSH blobs
like<00:04:50.230> this<00:04:50.470> so<00:04:50.770> no<00:04:51.520> matter<00:04:51.640> if<00:04:51.850> we<00:04:51.910> were

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:51.970 
like this so no matter if we were

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:53.310 
like this so no matter if we were
running<00:04:52.090> Windows<00:04:52.510> or<00:04:52.750> if<00:04:52.840> you're<00:04:52.960> running<00:04:53.080> on

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:53.320 
running Windows or if you're running on

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:55.920 
running Windows or if you're running on
a<00:04:53.380> Mac<00:04:53.710> you<00:04:54.490> can<00:04:54.610> easily<00:04:54.910> save<00:04:55.330> your<00:04:55.450> SHSH

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:55.930 
a Mac you can easily save your SHSH

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:58.410 
a Mac you can easily save your SHSH
blobs<00:04:56.140> for<00:04:56.560> future<00:04:57.040> downgrade<00:04:57.520> possibilities

00:04:58.410 --> 00:04:58.420 
blobs for future downgrade possibilities

00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:59.760
