I'm<00:02:14.370> going<00:02:14.550> to<00:02:14.580> get<00:02:14.730> cooler<00:02:15.090> AC<00:02:15.270> output<00:02:15.720> at

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
I'm going to get cooler AC output at

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.450 
I'm going to get cooler AC output at
idle<00:02:16.350> because<00:02:16.500> I'm<00:02:16.740> going<00:02:16.860> to<00:02:16.920> move<00:02:17.070> the<00:02:17.220> same

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
idle because I'm going to move the same

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.460 
idle because I'm going to move the same
amount<00:02:17.490> of<00:02:17.880> airflow<00:02:18.480> regardless<00:02:19.260> of<00:02:19.380> my

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
amount of airflow regardless of my

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:25.500 
amount of airflow regardless of my
engine<00:02:19.800> speed

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.570 

so<00:02:26.510> before<00:02:26.900> I<00:02:26.930> drop<00:02:27.290> in<00:02:27.440> the<00:02:27.560> radiator<00:02:27.980> I<00:02:28.280> need

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
so before I drop in the radiator I need

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.880 
so before I drop in the radiator I need
to<00:02:28.670> attach<00:02:29.000> this<00:02:29.300> bracket<00:02:29.360> right<00:02:29.930> here<00:02:29.990> you

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
to attach this bracket right here you

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:32.560 
to attach this bracket right here you
can<00:02:31.040> see<00:02:31.250> we<00:02:31.400> use<00:02:31.550> the<00:02:31.730> stock<00:02:31.970> bolts<00:02:32.390> right

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:32.570 
can see we use the stock bolts right

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:33.640 
can see we use the stock bolts right
here<00:02:32.630> and<00:02:32.990> right<00:02:33.140> here

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
here and right here

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.890 
here and right here
but<00:02:34.010> we've<00:02:34.130> also<00:02:34.370> added<00:02:34.670> the<00:02:34.940> tea<00:02:35.150> nut<00:02:35.420> which

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
but we've also added the tea nut which

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.960 
but we've also added the tea nut which
is<00:02:35.930> going<00:02:36.170> to<00:02:36.230> go<00:02:36.380> down<00:02:36.560> here<00:02:36.590> as<00:02:37.100> well<00:02:37.760> as<00:02:37.940> up

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
is going to go down here as well as up

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.870 
is going to go down here as well as up
here<00:02:38.440> make<00:02:39.440> special<00:02:39.890> note<00:02:39.920> it's<00:02:40.310> important

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
here make special note it's important

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.670 
here make special note it's important

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
that this is flush with your frame right

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.830 
that this is flush with your frame right
here<00:02:43.070> so<00:02:43.580> that<00:02:43.610> the<00:02:43.850> radiator<00:02:44.240> fan<00:02:44.480> will<00:02:44.660> fit

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
here so that the radiator fan will fit

00:02:44.840 --> 00:03:01.260 
here so that the radiator fan will fit
in<00:02:44.960> there<00:02:45.080> properly

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:01.270 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:03.640 

I'm<00:03:02.270> going<00:03:02.570> to<00:03:02.660> go<00:03:02.840> ahead<00:03:02.960> and<00:03:03.320> leave<00:03:03.470> this

but<00:03:56.780> I<00:03:57.200> do<00:03:57.530> have<00:03:57.890> another<00:03:58.130> choice<00:03:58.459> I<00:04:03.220> really

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:04.220 
but I do have another choice I really

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.280 
but I do have another choice I really
like<00:04:04.430> the<00:04:04.580> look<00:04:04.730> of<00:04:04.820> this<00:04:04.970> summer<00:04:05.239> plunge

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.290 
like the look of this summer plunge

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:08.380 
like the look of this summer plunge
which<00:04:06.769> by<00:04:06.950> the<00:04:06.980> way<00:04:07.129> flex-a-lite<00:04:07.610> offers<00:04:08.090> and

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:08.390 
which by the way flex-a-lite offers and

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:10.869 
which by the way flex-a-lite offers and
we're<00:04:09.019> going<00:04:09.170> to<00:04:09.230> go<00:04:09.319> ahead<00:04:09.439> and<00:04:09.739> change<00:04:10.069> the

00:04:10.869 --> 00:04:10.879 
we're going to go ahead and change the

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:13.780 
we're going to go ahead and change the
dimension<00:04:11.390> of<00:04:11.480> this<00:04:11.629> brother<00:04:11.930> kid<00:04:12.430> so<00:04:13.430> then<00:04:13.640> I

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:13.790 
dimension of this brother kid so then I

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:15.580 
dimension of this brother kid so then I
can<00:04:14.000> use<00:04:14.209> this<00:04:14.420> channel<00:04:14.870> here<00:04:15.140> without<00:04:15.409> a

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.590 
can use this channel here without a

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:23.629 
can use this channel here without a
yellow<00:04:15.890> float<00:04:16.190> a

00:04:23.629 --> 00:04:23.639 

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:26.040 

now<00:04:24.639> we're<00:04:24.850> going<00:04:24.940> to<00:04:25.000> hook<00:04:25.180> up<00:04:25.360> the<00:04:25.510> controls

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.050 
now we're going to hook up the controls

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:28.590 
now we're going to hook up the controls
and<00:04:26.410> here's<00:04:26.710> the<00:04:26.860> terminals<00:04:27.370> so<00:04:28.180> we've<00:04:28.330> got

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:28.600 
and here's the terminals so we've got

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.390 
and here's the terminals so we've got
the<00:04:28.780> B<00:04:28.960> terminal<00:04:29.440> here<00:04:29.889> which<00:04:30.070> is<00:04:30.250> the

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 
the B terminal here which is the
