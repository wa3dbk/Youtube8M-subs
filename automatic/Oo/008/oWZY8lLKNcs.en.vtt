00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
course my regular one and my racecar

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.670 
course my regular one and my racecar
dition<00:00:32.969> fully<00:00:33.480> upgraded<00:00:34.050> with<00:00:34.200> the<00:00:34.469> same

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
dition fully upgraded with the same

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.950 
dition fully upgraded with the same
upgrades<00:00:35.100> except<00:00:35.489> for<00:00:35.640> a<00:00:35.700> couple<00:00:35.910> of<00:00:36.329> cosmetic

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
upgrades except for a couple of cosmetic

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.260 
upgrades except for a couple of cosmetic
ones<00:00:37.170> that<00:00:37.380> wouldn't<00:00:37.739> affect<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:38.640> top<00:00:38.879> speed

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
ones that wouldn't affect the top speed

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.850 
ones that wouldn't affect the top speed
and<00:00:39.510> then<00:00:39.719> I<00:00:39.750> put<00:00:39.960> them<00:00:40.110> down<00:00:40.379> on<00:00:40.410> this

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
and then I put them down on this

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.160 
and then I put them down on this
racetrack<00:00:41.219> that<00:00:42.000> I<00:00:42.030> created<00:00:42.480> earlier<00:00:42.780> today

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
racetrack that I created earlier today

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.220 
racetrack that I created earlier today
specifically<00:00:44.010> for<00:00:44.340> testing<00:00:44.820> out<00:00:44.969> two<00:00:45.960> cars

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
specifically for testing out two cars

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.440 
specifically for testing out two cars
that<00:00:46.559> are<00:00:46.770> supposed<00:00:47.370> to<00:00:47.489> be<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:48.030> same<00:00:48.300> and

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
that are supposed to be the same and

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.900 
that are supposed to be the same and
speed<00:00:48.660> because<00:00:48.989> I<00:00:49.020> wanted<00:00:49.410> to<00:00:49.590> make<00:00:49.710> sure<00:00:49.910> that

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
speed because I wanted to make sure that

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.850 
speed because I wanted to make sure that
I<00:00:50.940> could<00:00:51.149> tell<00:00:51.420> where<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.500> cars<00:00:52.770> were

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
I could tell where the cars were

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.590 
I could tell where the cars were
actually<00:00:53.520> faster<00:00:53.730> if<00:00:54.149> there<00:00:54.360> was<00:00:54.570> a

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
actually faster if there was a

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.049 
actually faster if there was a
difference<00:00:55.289> between<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:56.309> two<00:00:56.430> of<00:00:56.460> them<00:00:56.579> so<00:00:56.910> as

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
difference between the two of them so as

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.279 
difference between the two of them so as
you<00:00:57.180> guys<00:00:57.270> can<00:00:57.480> see<00:00:57.539> in<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:57.809> beginning<00:00:57.960> they

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
you guys can see in the beginning they

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.139 
you guys can see in the beginning they
hit<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.559> same<00:00:58.859> two<00:00:59.370> checkpoints<00:00:59.670> at<00:01:00.120> a

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
hit the same two checkpoints at a

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.049 
hit the same two checkpoints at a
relatively<00:01:00.840> similar<00:01:01.260> time<00:01:01.829> so<00:01:02.730> they<00:01:02.850> don't

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
relatively similar time so they don't

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.219 
relatively similar time so they don't
appear<00:01:03.300> to<00:01:03.359> have<00:01:03.510> a<00:01:03.570> difference<00:01:04.019> in

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
appear to have a difference in

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.500 
appear to have a difference in
acceleration<00:01:04.979> but<00:01:05.430> as<00:01:05.640> we<00:01:05.880> go<00:01:06.000> further<00:01:06.240> into

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
acceleration but as we go further into

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.260 
acceleration but as we go further into
the<00:01:06.720> race<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:07.470> Dinka<00:01:07.950> just<00:01:08.310> a<00:01:08.430> racecar<00:01:08.909> dition

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
the race the Dinka just a racecar dition

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.450 
the race the Dinka just a racecar dition
is<00:01:09.600> definitely<00:01:10.260> gaining<00:01:10.500> a<00:01:10.770> lot<00:01:10.920> more<00:01:11.100> speed

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
is definitely gaining a lot more speed

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.000 
is definitely gaining a lot more speed
and<00:01:11.610> it's<00:01:12.240> reaching<00:01:12.600> its<00:01:12.780> maximum<00:01:12.930> speed<00:01:13.650> at<00:01:13.979> a

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
and it's reaching its maximum speed at a

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.120 
and it's reaching its maximum speed at a
much<00:01:14.430> higher<00:01:14.460> pace<00:01:15.000> than<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:15.990> than<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.500> dinka

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
much higher pace than the than the dinka

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.800 
much higher pace than the than the dinka
jesser<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.640> regular<00:01:18.060> edition<00:01:18.299> so<00:01:18.630> it

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
jesser the regular edition so it

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.740 
jesser the regular edition so it
definitely<00:01:19.110> does<00:01:19.650> appear<00:01:20.520> to<00:01:20.549> be<00:01:20.670> faster<00:01:21.270> than

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
definitely does appear to be faster than

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.390 
definitely does appear to be faster than
the<00:01:21.900> regular<00:01:22.140> Dinka<00:01:22.680> gesture<00:01:23.040> so<00:01:23.250> it's

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
the regular Dinka gesture so it's

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.219 
the regular Dinka gesture so it's
definitely<00:01:23.880> worth<00:01:24.150> the<00:01:24.299> upgrade<00:01:24.330> if<00:01:24.930> you<00:01:25.049> do

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
definitely worth the upgrade if you do

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.440 
definitely worth the upgrade if you do
have<00:01:25.380> a<00:01:25.409> gesture<00:01:26.070> or<00:01:26.100> a<00:01:26.310> master<00:01:26.970> crow<00:01:27.150> in<00:01:27.330> your

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
have a gesture or a master crow in your

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.539 
have a gesture or a master crow in your
garage<00:01:27.630> it<00:01:28.320> would<00:01:28.439> be<00:01:28.560> worth<00:01:28.740> it<00:01:28.920> to<00:01:28.950> sell<00:01:29.310> that

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
garage it would be worth it to sell that

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.460 
garage it would be worth it to sell that
vehicle<00:01:29.970> and<00:01:30.180> then<00:01:30.299> to<00:01:30.479> upgrade<00:01:30.900> it<00:01:31.049> to<00:01:31.079> the

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
vehicle and then to upgrade it to the

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.550 
vehicle and then to upgrade it to the
new<00:01:31.710> racecar<00:01:31.979> dition<00:01:32.640> of<00:01:32.759> that<00:01:33.509> car<00:01:33.810> so<00:01:34.200> to

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
new racecar dition of that car so to

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.160 
new racecar dition of that car so to
wrap<00:01:34.680> things<00:01:34.920> up<00:01:35.630> definitely<00:01:36.630> worth<00:01:36.810> it<00:01:36.990> to

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
wrap things up definitely worth it to

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.289 
wrap things up definitely worth it to
upgrade<00:01:37.590> to<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:38.040> race<00:01:38.310> car<00:01:38.579> versions<00:01:38.970> of<00:01:39.150> the

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
upgrade to the race car versions of the

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.719 
upgrade to the race car versions of the
mask<00:01:39.509> row<00:01:39.840> and<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.200> gesture<00:01:40.710> I<00:01:40.890> did<00:01:41.340> tested

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
mask row and the gesture I did tested

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.969
