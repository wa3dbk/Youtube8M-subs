00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:04.890
 in the equator of summer we started 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.419
 new season of videos and content 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.390
 web was actually all programmed 

00:00:06.419 --> 00:00:12.410
 for early September but that 

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:15.019
 I can tell you 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:18.860
 Today I'm going to propose a few 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:21.710
 looks but in a different way it's not going 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:25.720
 to have gone through styling, but it's going 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.720
 to have a common denominator the color 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:30.560
 I will show the different ways of 

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:34.340
 combine aquamarine color with water 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:38.600
 marine is like a blue more alive than 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:41.809
 pastel blue in the same range as the 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:44.840
 mint green that the mint and good the same 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:46.910
 range is - that 's blue is not green but 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.820
 for the time to combine the effects of 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:52.550
 combine it is very similar is a 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.559
 color protagonist no doubt in spring 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.809
 and in summer we will see how to get him 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:58.850
 also the whole party is a very color 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:02.360
 grateful because it favors almost everything 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.620
 types of skin tones hair if 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.110
 we do not know how to combine well if the 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:08.060
 color combination the hair and in the 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.950
 skin 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.770
 softens a lot we have to highlight more 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:15.110
 the traits or pick up the hair leave them 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.090
 loose a bit as we go 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.550
 knowing we are seeing the tonalities 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:22.280
 that come in handy and that's why the 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:25.930
 Beauty and fashion go hand in hand because 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:29.470
 well one complements the other 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:31.210
 we go to the mess as in a matter of 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:32.080
 combination of colors as with 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:36.130
 any other color 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:39.640
 the combination with neutrals is perfect 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:42.670
 it's a basic but safe bet 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:46.300
 in neutral for example a also a 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:48.700
 little caramel vanilla white broken 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.800
 all that kind of colors is doing very well 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.290
 but we go to my proposals and I'm going 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.870
 counting 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:57.450
 this color next to the min or mint green 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:02:00.060
 As we have already mentioned, he is the protagonist 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:03.770
 since spring and there is no combination more 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.770
 spring than white and aquamarine 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.130
 the silver supplements work very 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.200
 all right 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.990
 soft that does not stand out but that 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.820
 complement if you see in this case the 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:18.570
 collar goes inside the shirt so that 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:20.900
 Do not be a protagonist in short skirts or 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:22.950
 long trousers the effect is the same 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:26.130
 imagine this blouse with a cigarette 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.900
 white or one heel the result respect 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.980
 The combination is the same but with 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.980
 more comfortable clothes 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.780
 White enhances the simplicity of the look 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.550
 makes it more elegant and manages to flirt 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.260
 the colors that we use for example if 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:43.160
 we put a third color like a rose 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.160
 cake on what 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:50.570
 If what we are looking for is a more formal look 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.370
 for work an event and so on 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:54.590
 Black is the best water companion 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.390
 marina for summer nights is left 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.970
 really beautiful enhancing the color of 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:00.160
 our skin even if it is this white 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:02.700
 like me 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:05.209
 [Music] 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.209
 i 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.040
 in this case the add-ons can 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.459
 have something more prominence and use 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.459
 golden 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:24.220
 I wear a dress and jacket but 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:26.950
 imagine the blouse that I have taught you in 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:29.470
 the previous look with black pants or 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:32.290
 the short that comes next with 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:34.300
 a black square silk shirt for 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.640
 a night out 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:38.500
 hearing the topic of fluorine to do 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.940
 something different in summer and use those 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.190
 garments of light tones 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:44.710
 we can use as a contrast items with 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:48.040
 much force for example a red or a 

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:50.260
 coral a navy blue in this case the 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.990
 key of the look is to combine fabrics with the 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:56.310
 same movement a two layer effect 

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:56.310
 vaporous chilly 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:13.000
 as an outer garment it is very easy to 

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:15.430
 wear this color a jacket blazer or 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.989
 You will always be able to combine it 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:20.470
 for your day to day or the most looks 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:24.630
 comfortable easier with a denim both 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:24.630
 clear as dark long or short 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.769
 [Music] 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:52.380
 Being big clothes I would not put 

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:55.940
 a lot of color contrast the whites 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:55.940
 denim fabrics are perfect 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:08.730
 [Music] 

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:22.690
 two 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:28.310
 as good weather is running out 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:30.830
 What you can do is make a 

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:34.370
 little that color of your closet 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:36.260
 uses two softer contrasts and 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:38.420
 Overlay garments jackets that 

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:40.040
 is that that garment looks very little 

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:41.950
 give that touch of color or directly 

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:44.930
 What you can do is use 

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:47.650
 complements with that tonality is worth what 

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:51.160
 what you get is a look 

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:53.770
 cool and cheerful but in colder times 

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:56.800
 and my obsession with this has already been used 

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:59.860
 color during this week we will go 

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:02.620
 giving these looks and many more 

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:04.990
 in detail on social media if 

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:07.449
 you have seen a little my inactivity in 

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:09.430
 this case has been for lack and problems 

00:06:07.449 --> 00:06:10.960
 of connection but when I'm counting 

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:13.330
 a little less my day to day also 

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:15.280
 by snap chat apart from instagram and 

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:18.419
 all the networks and we see ourselves the 

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:21.510
 next Sunday in the same place and as 

00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:23.889
 I usually do things the other way around 

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:26.070
 welcome once again to beauty by 

00:06:23.889 --> 00:06:26.070
 state
