on kind of the front of her face or on

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.760 
on kind of the front of her face or on
the<00:04:58.889> side<00:04:59.099> of<00:04:59.130> her<00:04:59.340> face<00:04:59.550> instead<00:05:00.180> of<00:05:00.770> instead

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:01.770 
the side of her face instead of instead

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:04.820 
the side of her face instead of instead
of<00:05:01.830> her<00:05:02.250> totally<00:05:02.610> being<00:05:02.820> lit<00:05:03.030> up<00:05:03.590> so<00:05:04.590> all<00:05:04.740> we

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:04.830 
of her totally being lit up so all we

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:07.040 
of her totally being lit up so all we
did<00:05:05.240> yeah<00:05:06.240> I<00:05:06.270> think<00:05:06.419> that's<00:05:06.630> what<00:05:06.780> we<00:05:06.870> did

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:07.050

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:09.860 
did yeah I think that's what we did
pretty<00:05:07.289> much<00:05:07.909> so<00:05:08.909> I<00:05:08.940> have<00:05:09.180> a<00:05:09.210> feeling<00:05:09.419> that<00:05:09.720> all

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:09.870 
pretty much so I have a feeling that all
