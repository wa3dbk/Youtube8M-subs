00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
I guess the former Colonel Bishop wanted

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:50.830 
I guess the former Colonel Bishop wanted
it<00:03:49.739> back

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
it back

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.320 
it back
hmm<00:03:51.840> all<00:03:51.989> right<00:03:52.200> yeah<00:03:52.830> I<00:03:53.220> thought<00:03:53.670> Silas<00:03:54.180> was

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.330 
hmm all right yeah I thought Silas was
