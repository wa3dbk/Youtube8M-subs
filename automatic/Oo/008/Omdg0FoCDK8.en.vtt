00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
magazine we're just doing it for fun

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:12.200 
magazine we're just doing it for fun
we're<00:00:11.219> seeing<00:00:11.400> what<00:00:11.519> tricks<00:00:11.759> I<00:00:11.849> can<00:00:11.880> learn<00:00:12.150> how

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
we're seeing what tricks I can learn how

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.780 
we're seeing what tricks I can learn how
much<00:00:12.570> I<00:00:12.690> can<00:00:12.840> push<00:00:13.019> myself<00:00:13.309> today<00:00:14.309> I'm<00:00:14.639> going

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
much I can push myself today I'm going

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.220 
much I can push myself today I'm going
to<00:00:14.849> try<00:00:14.969> to<00:00:15.059> learn<00:00:15.240> moving<00:00:15.780> heel<00:00:15.960> flips

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
to try to learn moving heel flips

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.529 
to try to learn moving heel flips
because<00:00:16.680> I<00:00:16.949> got<00:00:17.430> heel<00:00:17.609> flips<00:00:17.880> stationary<00:00:18.390> and

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
because I got heel flips stationary and

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:19.970 
because I got heel flips stationary and
I<00:00:18.570> think<00:00:18.779> that<00:00:18.900> a<00:00:18.930> moving<00:00:19.230> heel<00:00:19.470> flip<00:00:19.710> would<00:00:19.800> be

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
I think that a moving heel flip would be

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.560 
I think that a moving heel flip would be
sick<00:00:20.250> off<00:00:20.430> stairs<00:00:20.880> or<00:00:21.119> something<00:00:21.390> like<00:00:21.510> that

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
sick off stairs or something like that

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.810 
sick off stairs or something like that
so<00:00:22.439> I'm<00:00:22.529> just<00:00:22.710> going<00:00:22.830> to<00:00:22.890> practice<00:00:23.130> it<00:00:23.490> until<00:00:23.609> I

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
so I'm just going to practice it until I

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.340

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:50.079 
so I'm close I'm just I'm tired I think

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:51.660 
so I'm close I'm just I'm tired I think
what<00:01:50.439> I<00:01:50.470> need<00:01:50.799> to<00:01:50.920> do<00:01:51.009> is<00:01:51.130> I<00:01:51.250> just<00:01:51.310> need<00:01:51.549> to

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
what I need to do is I just need to

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.020 
what I need to do is I just need to
flick<00:01:51.969> fast<00:01:52.890> and<00:01:53.890> just<00:01:54.100> jump<00:01:54.310> up<00:01:54.429> really<00:01:54.850> high

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
flick fast and just jump up really high

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.660 
flick fast and just jump up really high
it<00:01:55.569> just<00:01:55.600> takes<00:01:55.960> a<00:01:56.110> lot<00:01:56.259> of<00:01:56.289> effort<00:01:56.679> so<00:01:57.579> it's

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
it just takes a lot of effort so it's

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.249 
it just takes a lot of effort so it's
hard<00:01:57.850> to<00:01:57.909> do<00:01:58.000> it<00:01:58.060> every<00:01:58.329> time<00:01:58.539> so<00:01:58.960> that's<00:01:59.140> what

00:01:59.249 --> 00:01:59.259

I<00:02:16.840> really<00:02:17.170> can<00:02:17.380> do<00:02:17.560> it<00:02:19.829> getting<00:02:20.829> further<00:02:21.459> away

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
I really can do it getting further away

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.220

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
from sure you know I'm just being

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.160 
from sure you know I'm just being
sluggish<00:02:27.209> when<00:02:28.209> I<00:02:28.299> do<00:02:28.360> the<00:02:28.569> pop<00:02:28.780> I'm<00:02:29.110> not

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
sluggish when I do the pop I'm not

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:34.190 
sluggish when I do the pop I'm not
really<00:02:29.530> committing<00:02:29.920> to<00:02:29.950> it<00:02:30.780> I'm<00:02:31.780> just<00:02:31.840> tired

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
really committing to it I'm just tired

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.509 
really committing to it I'm just tired
that<00:02:35.200> time<00:02:35.350> I<00:02:35.380> really<00:02:35.739> put<00:02:35.950> some<00:02:36.100> oomph<00:02:36.250> into

00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:36.519 
that time I really put some oomph into

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:43.379 
that time I really put some oomph into
it<00:02:37.230> but<00:02:38.230> the<00:02:38.799> mechanics<00:02:39.250> were<00:02:39.370> wrong<00:02:39.519> I<00:02:42.389> went

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:43.389 
it but the mechanics were wrong I went

00:02:43.389 --> 00:02:45.660 
it but the mechanics were wrong I went
to<00:02:43.480> flick<00:02:43.720> that<00:02:43.930> time<00:02:44.200> but<00:02:45.100> the<00:02:45.220> board<00:02:45.459> was

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
to flick that time but the board was

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.120 
to flick that time but the board was
going<00:02:45.880> in<00:02:46.000> the<00:02:46.060> wrong<00:02:46.180> direction<00:02:46.829> so<00:02:47.829> I<00:02:47.889> didn't

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
going in the wrong direction so I didn't

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:52.830 
going in the wrong direction so I didn't
