it<00:05:39.310> doesn't<00:05:39.669> hurt<00:05:39.820> doesn't<00:05:40.300> hurt<00:05:40.419> at<00:05:40.600> all<00:05:40.690> I

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:40.990 
it doesn't hurt doesn't hurt at all I

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:42.510 
it doesn't hurt doesn't hurt at all I
didn't<00:05:41.200> even<00:05:41.290> hurt<00:05:41.530> afterwards<00:05:41.950> but<00:05:42.250> it

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:42.520 
didn't even hurt afterwards but it

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:44.610 
didn't even hurt afterwards but it
burned<00:05:42.790> and<00:05:43.060> the<00:05:43.600> reason<00:05:43.930> why<00:05:44.050> that<00:05:44.260> was<00:05:44.440> was

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:44.620 
burned and the reason why that was was

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:47.670 
burned and the reason why that was was
because<00:05:44.890> my<00:05:45.040> pores<00:05:45.570> we're<00:05:46.570> still<00:05:46.810> open<00:05:47.050> so

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:47.680 
because my pores we're still open so

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:50.190 
because my pores we're still open so
what<00:05:48.370> I<00:05:48.400> would<00:05:48.550> caution<00:05:48.970> you<00:05:49.270> what<00:05:49.630> I<00:05:49.660> realized

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:50.200 
what I would caution you what I realized

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:52.230 
what I would caution you what I realized
is<00:05:50.350> that<00:05:50.410> I<00:05:50.800> probably<00:05:51.310> should<00:05:51.610> have<00:05:51.760> a<00:05:51.820> wash<00:05:52.060> my

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:52.240
