twist and then of course some of them

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.710 
twist and then of course some of them
will<00:01:00.729> crack<00:01:01.239> and<00:01:02.129> split<00:01:03.129> and<00:01:03.850> if<00:01:04.449> there's

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:04.720 
will crack and split and if there's

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:16.120 
on the bottom of the shingle you're

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.720 
on the bottom of the shingle you're
probably<00:01:16.390> gonna<00:01:16.600> have<00:01:16.750> a<00:01:16.840> water<00:01:17.170> leak<00:01:17.730> here's

probably gonna have a water leak here's
a<00:01:18.790> good<00:01:18.910> example<00:01:18.970> of<00:01:19.480> what<00:01:19.660> I'm<00:01:19.780> talking<00:01:20.200> about

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
a good example of what I'm talking about

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.260 
a good example of what I'm talking about
the<00:01:21.310> shingle<00:01:22.030> below<00:01:22.630> the<00:01:23.380> arrow<00:01:23.800> not<00:01:24.460> directly

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:25.270 
the shingle below the arrow not directly

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:27.000 
the shingle below the arrow not directly
below<00:01:25.540> you<00:01:25.720> can<00:01:25.960> see<00:01:26.290> where<00:01:26.500> there's<00:01:26.650> three

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:27.010 
below you can see where there's three

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:29.940 
below you can see where there's three
pieces<00:01:27.690> where<00:01:28.690> the<00:01:28.900> shingle<00:01:29.230> is<00:01:29.350> split<00:01:29.740> into

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950 
pieces where the shingle is split into

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.220 
pieces where the shingle is split into
three<00:01:30.070> pieces<00:01:30.550> and<00:01:31.120> someone<00:01:31.720> just<00:01:31.870> simply

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:32.230 
three pieces and someone just simply

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:35.100 
three pieces and someone just simply
nailed<00:01:32.470> it<00:01:32.650> back<00:01:32.920> together<00:01:33.220> and<00:01:33.940> what<00:01:34.930> that

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110 
nailed it back together and what that

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.610 
nailed it back together and what that
does<00:01:35.470> is<00:01:35.830> allows<00:01:36.760> water<00:01:37.330> when<00:01:38.080> it<00:01:38.200> hits<00:01:38.440> the

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:38.620 
does is allows water when it hits the

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:42.120 
does is allows water when it hits the
siding<00:01:39.130> to<00:01:39.850> drain<00:01:40.750> into<00:01:41.170> the<00:01:41.440> crack<00:01:41.740> where<00:01:41.980> the

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 
siding to drain into the crack where the

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.080 
siding to drain into the crack where the
arrow<00:01:42.370> is<00:01:42.990> down<00:01:43.990> the<00:01:44.590> side<00:01:44.860> of<00:01:45.130> the<00:01:45.310> wall<00:01:45.580> and

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
arrow is down the side of the wall and

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:52.440 
arrow is down the side of the wall and
in<00:01:46.510> to<00:01:47.350> the<00:01:48.250> house<00:01:48.960> so<00:01:50.850> this<00:01:51.850> shingle<00:01:52.120> should

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450 
in to the house so this shingle should

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.960 
in to the house so this shingle should
have<00:01:52.570> been<00:01:52.690> replaced<00:01:53.230> instead<00:01:54.070> of<00:01:54.310> nailed

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:54.970 
have been replaced instead of nailed

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.810 
have been replaced instead of nailed
together<00:01:55.390> like<00:01:55.720> that<00:01:55.750> so<00:01:56.290> again<00:01:57.190> just<00:01:57.520> to
