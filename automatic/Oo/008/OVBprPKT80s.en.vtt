00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:17.270

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:05.440
 to validate if I already want to be 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:07.660
 invalidated no no we will not validate the 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:10.560
 years remaining to him to be bachiller 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:17.619
 Villameca gets into the night to see if 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:20.680
 he is proud of you 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:22.380

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.600

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.940

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.950
 by God if I have everything here I do not 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:44.410

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.470

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.430
 excited unless you have a 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:06.030
 idea to save a little and get 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:07.740
 those school texts I already know that and it has 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.709

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.270
 comment well thank you look what happens 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.970
 is that the grandfather is entering to validate 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:44.620
 3rd grade of primary school and mother a list of 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.900
 school text I'm calling towards the 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.580
 neighborhood neighbors to see if they have the 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.620

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.690
 exchange I have some here from 2nd of 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:55.210
 primary and if you have third 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:57.250
 we can change then the age you would like 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:59.710
 because here there is nothing either not 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:02.800

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:04.210
 suddenly there are some nacho and grandfather 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:11.890

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.940

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:22.840

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.800
 recording and the tape was entangled or 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:29.890

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:35.340
 hits there with the phone 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:39.080
 and he started 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:41.480
 to mark the alkaline line 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:44.240
 to the derby that the call was cut off 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:46.220
