owner operators start as an owner

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.810 
owner operators start as an owner
operator<00:00:40.530> at<00:00:40.860> the<00:00:40.980> fleet<00:00:41.190> they<00:00:41.340> were<00:00:41.399> just<00:00:41.640> at

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
operator at the fleet they were just at

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.549 
operator at the fleet they were just at
typically<00:00:42.510> they'll<00:00:42.750> have<00:00:42.930> an<00:00:43.020> owner/operator

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
typically they'll have an owner/operator

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.340 
typically they'll have an owner/operator
fleet<00:00:43.770> but<00:00:44.010> and<00:00:45.000> that's<00:00:45.809> not<00:00:45.989> to<00:00:46.110> say<00:00:46.230> that

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
fleet but and that's not to say that

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.959 
fleet but and that's not to say that
that's<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.620> right<00:00:46.770> way<00:00:46.829> to<00:00:46.950> go<00:00:47.190> either<00:00:47.399> you

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
that's the right way to go either you

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.880 
that's the right way to go either you
know<00:00:48.059> it's<00:00:48.180> a<00:00:48.270> real<00:00:48.510> Rubik's<00:00:48.989> Cube<00:00:49.590> when<00:00:49.800> you

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
know it's a real Rubik's Cube when you

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.709 
know it's a real Rubik's Cube when you
start<00:00:50.160> comparing<00:00:50.340> pay<00:00:50.789> packages<00:00:51.390> so<00:00:51.600> you

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
start comparing pay packages so you

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.569 
start comparing pay packages so you
really<00:00:52.050> got<00:00:52.170> to<00:00:52.289> do<00:00:52.379> your<00:00:52.500> homework<00:00:52.559> and<00:00:53.129> you

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
really got to do your homework and you

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.100 
really got to do your homework and you
know<00:00:53.670> you<00:00:53.760> should<00:00:53.940> have<00:00:53.969> a<00:00:54.090> spreadsheet<00:00:54.480> out

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
know you should have a spreadsheet out

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.529 
know you should have a spreadsheet out
of<00:00:55.559> what<00:00:55.800> each<00:00:56.010> carriers<00:00:56.520> gross<00:00:56.879> revenue<00:00:57.390> is

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
of what each carriers gross revenue is

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.810 
of what each carriers gross revenue is
you<00:00:58.379> should<00:00:58.590> have<00:00:58.800> what<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.309> carrier<00:00:59.579> pays

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
you should have what the carrier pays

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.340 
you should have what the carrier pays
for<00:01:00.180> cuz<00:01:00.390> it'll<00:01:00.570> all<00:01:00.629> pay<00:01:00.930> for<00:01:00.960> different

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
for cuz it'll all pay for different

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.229 
for cuz it'll all pay for different
things<00:01:01.710> and<00:01:02.039> they'll<00:01:02.460> all<00:01:02.640> be<00:01:02.670> things<00:01:03.030> that

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
things and they'll all be things that

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.299 
things and they'll all be things that
they<00:01:03.359> don't<00:01:03.480> pay<00:01:03.750> for<00:01:04.049> so<00:01:04.260> you<00:01:04.799> really<00:01:05.100> have<00:01:05.250> to

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
they don't pay for so you really have to

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.310 
they don't pay for so you really have to
filter<00:01:05.850> through<00:01:06.030> all<00:01:06.119> this<00:01:06.510> information<00:01:06.750> to

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
filter through all this information to

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.480 
filter through all this information to
find<00:01:07.500> out<00:01:07.590> what<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:07.830> number<00:01:08.070> looks<00:01:08.250> at<00:01:08.400> the

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
find out what the number looks at the

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.730 
find out what the number looks at the
bottom<00:01:08.729> of<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:08.880> page<00:01:09.060> so<00:01:09.689> an<00:01:09.900> example<00:01:10.500> of<00:01:10.590> that

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
bottom of the page so an example of that

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.580 
bottom of the page so an example of that
and<00:01:11.460> one<00:01:11.700> carrier<00:01:12.060> might<00:01:12.270> pay<00:01:12.479> or<00:01:13.049> advertise

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
and one carrier might pay or advertise

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.700 
and one carrier might pay or advertise
another<00:01:13.890> ten<00:01:14.159> cents<00:01:14.460> a<00:01:14.549> mile<00:01:15.020> compared<00:01:16.020> to<00:01:16.200> say

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
another ten cents a mile compared to say

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.950 
another ten cents a mile compared to say
carrier<00:01:17.040> air<00:01:17.189> compared<00:01:17.610> to<00:01:17.700> carrier<00:01:18.000> B<00:01:18.240> but

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
carrier air compared to carrier B but

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.390 
carrier air compared to carrier B but
that<00:01:19.140> 10<00:01:19.320> cents<00:01:19.560> a<00:01:19.650> mile<00:01:19.830> looks<00:01:20.100> huge

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
that 10 cents a mile looks huge

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.910 
that 10 cents a mile looks huge
especially<00:01:20.759> if<00:01:21.270> you're<00:01:21.479> you<00:01:21.720> know<00:01:21.810> doing

especially if you're you know doing

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.780 
especially if you're you know doing
120,000<00:01:22.920> miles<00:01:23.070> a<00:01:23.220> year<00:01:23.250> that's<00:01:23.400> twelve

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
120,000 miles a year that's twelve

120,000 miles a year that's twelve
thousand<00:01:24.119> dollars<00:01:24.710> but<00:01:25.970> what<00:01:26.970> it<00:01:27.210> doesn't<00:01:27.479> say

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 
thousand dollars but what it doesn't say

thousand dollars but what it doesn't say
once<00:01:28.890> you<00:01:28.979> investigate<00:01:29.520> a<00:01:29.549> little<00:01:29.610> bit

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
once you investigate a little bit

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.370 
once you investigate a little bit
further<00:01:30.119> you<00:01:30.270> may<00:01:30.390> find<00:01:30.630> out<00:01:30.840> that<00:01:30.990> that<00:01:31.140> carry

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
further you may find out that that carry

pays a dime a mile less it will likely

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.350 
pays a dime a mile less it will likely
result<00:01:53.070> more<00:01:53.399> money<00:01:53.640> in<00:01:53.729> your<00:01:53.790> pocket<00:01:54.210> because

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:53.800 
encourage people ask is dasa ask the

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.910 
encourage people ask is dasa ask the
recruiter<00:02:54.280> what<00:02:54.550> their<00:02:54.700> turnover<00:02:55.239> rate<00:02:55.420> is<00:02:55.920> if

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
recruiter what their turnover rate is if

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.949 
recruiter what their turnover rate is if
they<00:02:57.340> don't<00:02:57.640> know<00:02:57.940> what<00:02:58.180> their<00:02:58.330> turnover<00:02:58.810> rate

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
they don't know what their turnover rate

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:00.990 
they don't know what their turnover rate
is<00:02:59.170> then<00:02:59.800> they're<00:02:59.980> not<00:03:00.070> measuring<00:03:00.430> it<00:03:00.760> and

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
is then they're not measuring it and

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.090 
is then they're not measuring it and
look<00:03:01.840> quite<00:03:02.050> likely<00:03:02.320> they<00:03:02.440> don't<00:03:02.590> really<00:03:02.739> care

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 
look quite likely they don't really care

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.150 
look quite likely they don't really care
and<00:03:03.430> that's<00:03:03.670> that's<00:03:04.000> a<00:03:04.150> bad<00:03:04.330> sign<00:03:04.860> so<00:03:05.860> you<00:03:05.920> want

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
and that's that's a bad sign so you want

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.820 
and that's that's a bad sign so you want
to<00:03:06.250> know<00:03:06.510> what<00:03:07.510> that<00:03:07.660> turnover<00:03:08.110> rate<00:03:08.290> is<00:03:08.470> they

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:08.830 
to know what that turnover rate is they

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:10.050 
to know what that turnover rate is they
should<00:03:09.040> be<00:03:09.160> able<00:03:09.220> to<00:03:09.310> show<00:03:09.489> you<00:03:09.550> numbers

you<00:05:04.400> know<00:05:04.850> it's<00:05:05.090> typically<00:05:05.419> going<00:05:05.570> to<00:05:05.630> be

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:05.690 
you know it's typically going to be

00:05:16.089 --> 00:05:16.099 
company so you know it's hard to just

00:05:16.099 --> 00:05:18.370 
company so you know it's hard to just
jump<00:05:16.250> at<00:05:16.400> the<00:05:16.490> first<00:05:16.699> one<00:05:16.940> and<00:05:16.970> without<00:05:17.810> really

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:18.380 
jump at the first one and without really

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:20.800 
jump at the first one and without really
looking<00:05:18.680> at<00:05:18.800> some<00:05:19.010> comparison<00:05:19.610> companies<00:05:20.599> to

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:20.810 
looking at some comparison companies to

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:23.050 
looking at some comparison companies to
see<00:05:21.229> how<00:05:21.320> they<00:05:21.470> all<00:05:21.500> one<00:05:22.340> stacks<00:05:22.580> up<00:05:22.789> against

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:23.060 
see how they all one stacks up against

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:25.089 
see how they all one stacks up against
the<00:05:23.180> other<00:05:23.270> and<00:05:24.229> once<00:05:24.380> you<00:05:24.500> have<00:05:24.710> found<00:05:24.949> a

00:05:25.089 --> 00:05:25.099 
the other and once you have found a

00:05:25.099 --> 00:05:26.920 
the other and once you have found a
carrier<00:05:25.430> to<00:05:25.490> go<00:05:25.639> work<00:05:25.789> for<00:05:26.060> what<00:05:26.599> can<00:05:26.720> you<00:05:26.840> do

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:26.930 
carrier to go work for what can you do

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:29.290 
carrier to go work for what can you do
to<00:05:27.020> make<00:05:27.139> sure<00:05:27.260> that<00:05:27.410> it<00:05:27.530> works<00:05:27.710> out<00:05:27.919> I<00:05:28.300> think

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:29.300 
to make sure that it works out I think

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:30.820 
to make sure that it works out I think
you've<00:05:29.630> got<00:05:29.840> to<00:05:29.870> do<00:05:30.080> your<00:05:30.229> part<00:05:30.530> in<00:05:30.620> these

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:30.830 
you've got to do your part in these

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:32.650 
you've got to do your part in these
things<00:05:31.130> it's<00:05:31.430> it's<00:05:31.669> a<00:05:32.000> business<00:05:32.360> relationship

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:32.660 
things it's it's a business relationship

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:36.460 
things it's it's a business relationship
so<00:05:33.349> you<00:05:33.620> know<00:05:34.190> a<00:05:34.820> legitimate<00:05:35.810> question<00:05:35.930> when

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:36.470 
so you know a legitimate question when

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:37.870 
so you know a legitimate question when
you're<00:05:36.590> interviewing<00:05:37.010> and<00:05:37.280> Carrie<00:05:37.460> would<00:05:37.699> be

you're interviewing and Carrie would be

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:39.790 
you're interviewing and Carrie would be
what<00:05:38.360> what<00:05:38.870> mechanism<00:05:39.380> do<00:05:39.470> you<00:05:39.530> have<00:05:39.650> in<00:05:39.770> place

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:39.800 
what what mechanism do you have in place

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:42.129 
what what mechanism do you have in place

can I do when things are when I see

can I do when things are when I see
things<00:05:53.780> are<00:05:54.020> starting<00:05:54.260> to<00:05:54.289> go<00:05:54.409> sideways

things are starting to go sideways

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:56.500 
things are starting to go sideways
because<00:05:55.220> typically<00:05:55.789> if<00:05:55.880> the<00:05:55.909> carrier<00:05:56.240> sees

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:56.510 
because typically if the carrier sees

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:01.370 
they're going to get on it pretty quick

for you to go and talk to somebody if

for you to go and talk to somebody if
you're<00:06:08.599> not<00:06:08.840> getting<00:06:09.260> the<00:06:09.409> things<00:06:09.680> that<00:06:09.889> you

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:10.010 
you're not getting the things that you

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:11.409 
you're not getting the things that you
thought<00:06:10.220> were<00:06:10.280> there<00:06:10.610> when<00:06:10.789> you<00:06:10.909> signed<00:06:11.180> on<00:06:11.300> to

00:06:11.409 --> 00:06:11.419 
thought were there when you signed on to

00:06:11.419 --> 00:06:13.210 
thought were there when you signed on to
that<00:06:11.539> carrier<00:06:11.900> and<00:06:12.349> we've<00:06:12.800> touched<00:06:12.949> on<00:06:13.130> this

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:13.220 
that carrier and we've touched on this

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:14.760 
that carrier and we've touched on this
before<00:06:13.610> but<00:06:13.729> I<00:06:13.789> think<00:06:13.849> it<00:06:14.120> bears<00:06:14.300> repeating

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:14.770 
before but I think it bears repeating

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:17.740 
before but I think it bears repeating
how<00:06:15.770> much<00:06:15.949> does<00:06:16.130> it<00:06:16.159> cost<00:06:16.460> to<00:06:17.090> switch<00:06:17.330> from<00:06:17.539> one

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:17.750 
how much does it cost to switch from one

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:19.899 
how much does it cost to switch from one
carrier<00:06:18.110> to<00:06:18.440> another<00:06:18.710> why<00:06:19.250> is<00:06:19.310> that<00:06:19.430> something

00:06:19.899 --> 00:06:19.909 
carrier to another why is that something

00:06:19.909 --> 00:06:21.520 
carrier to another why is that something
which<00:06:20.300> should<00:06:20.419> not<00:06:20.479> be<00:06:20.539> taken<00:06:20.930> lightly<00:06:20.960> if<00:06:21.409> you

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:21.530 
which should not be taken lightly if you

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:23.320 
which should not be taken lightly if you
do<00:06:21.680> have<00:06:21.860> a<00:06:21.889> disagreement<00:06:22.490> with<00:06:22.789> someone<00:06:23.060> and

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:23.330 
do have a disagreement with someone and

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:25.390 
do have a disagreement with someone and
you<00:06:24.199> find<00:06:24.440> yourself<00:06:24.560> a<00:06:24.860> little<00:06:24.979> upset<00:06:25.370> that

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:25.400 
you find yourself a little upset that

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:28.270 
you find yourself a little upset that
particular<00:06:25.849> day<00:06:26.500> it's<00:06:27.500> just<00:06:27.620> not<00:06:27.979> good

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:30.430 
business practice in my previous life

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:32.469 
business practice in my previous life
when<00:06:31.430> I<00:06:31.460> was<00:06:31.610> running<00:06:31.820> a<00:06:31.880> motor<00:06:32.029> carrier<00:06:32.270> we

00:06:32.469 --> 00:06:32.479 
when I was running a motor carrier we

00:06:32.479 --> 00:06:33.690 
when I was running a motor carrier we
would<00:06:32.630> never<00:06:32.840> hire<00:06:33.110> anybody

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:33.700 
would never hire anybody

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:37.020 
would never hire anybody

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:37.030 
had had two jobs in 12 months we just

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:38.700 
had had two jobs in 12 months we just
knew<00:06:37.120> they<00:06:37.300> were<00:06:37.360> financially<00:06:37.990> weak<00:06:38.200> and<00:06:38.440> we

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:38.710 
knew they were financially weak and we

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:40.110 
knew they were financially weak and we
knew<00:06:38.830> if<00:06:38.980> anything<00:06:39.280> was<00:06:39.400> to<00:06:39.520> happen<00:06:39.550> in<00:06:40.000> a

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:40.120 
knew if anything was to happen in a

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:41.700 
knew if anything was to happen in a
short<00:06:40.450> timeframe<00:06:40.690> with<00:06:41.110> our<00:06:41.230> company<00:06:41.590> they'd

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:41.710 
short timeframe with our company they'd

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:43.320 
short timeframe with our company they'd
probably<00:06:41.860> be<00:06:42.130> asking<00:06:42.490> us<00:06:42.610> for<00:06:42.640> money<00:06:42.850> so<00:06:43.210> we

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:43.330 
probably be asking us for money so we

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:45.810 
probably be asking us for money so we
wouldn't<00:06:43.540> do<00:06:43.660> it<00:06:44.310> you<00:06:45.310> know<00:06:45.370> if<00:06:45.520> you<00:06:45.670> were<00:06:45.730> to

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:45.820 
wouldn't do it you know if you were to

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:47.220 
wouldn't do it you know if you were to
leave<00:06:45.940> a<00:06:45.970> carrier<00:06:46.390> for<00:06:46.570> two<00:06:46.660> cents<00:06:46.900> a<00:06:47.020> mile

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:47.230 
leave a carrier for two cents a mile

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:49.310 
leave a carrier for two cents a mile
here's<00:06:47.530> here's<00:06:47.860> the<00:06:47.920> numbers<00:06:48.340> and<00:06:48.790> you<00:06:49.030> did

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:49.320 
here's here's the numbers and you did

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:53.010 
here's here's the numbers and you did
120,000<00:06:50.320> miles<00:06:50.500> a<00:06:50.800> year<00:06:51.640> that's<00:06:52.150> 2,400

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:53.020 
120,000 miles a year that's 2,400

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:55.050 
120,000 miles a year that's 2,400
dollars<00:06:53.110> so<00:06:53.830> 2,400<00:06:54.490> bucks<00:06:54.580> is<00:06:54.790> that<00:06:54.910> worth

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:55.060 
dollars so 2,400 bucks is that worth

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:56.040 
dollars so 2,400 bucks is that worth
changing<00:06:55.450> and<00:06:55.750> care

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:56.050 
changing and care

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:58.020 
changing and care
it<00:06:56.200> might<00:06:56.530> sound<00:06:56.800> attractive<00:06:57.130> to<00:06:57.490> some<00:06:57.700> people

00:06:58.020 --> 00:06:58.030 
it might sound attractive to some people

00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:01.320 
it might sound attractive to some people
but<00:06:58.840> you've<00:06:59.200> got<00:06:59.470> to<00:06:59.710> here's<00:07:00.700> the<00:07:00.820> process<00:07:01.210> you

going to put you through some hoops that

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:24.300 
going to put you through some hoops that
are<00:07:22.120> going<00:07:22.210> to<00:07:22.270> take<00:07:22.480> some<00:07:22.690> time<00:07:23.130> you<00:07:24.130> know<00:07:24.160> in

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:24.310 
are going to take some time you know in

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:26.130 
are going to take some time you know in
that<00:07:24.430> time<00:07:24.850> is<00:07:25.060> typically<00:07:25.450> anywhere<00:07:25.720> from<00:07:26.080> a

00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:26.140 
that time is typically anywhere from a

00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:28.590 
that time is typically anywhere from a
weekend<00:07:26.440> half<00:07:26.620> to<00:07:26.770> two<00:07:26.950> weeks<00:07:27.270> so<00:07:28.270> if<00:07:28.480> you

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:28.600 
weekend half to two weeks so if you

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:30.090 
weekend half to two weeks so if you
think<00:07:28.780> about<00:07:28.990> the<00:07:29.350> grocery<00:07:29.710> owner<00:07:29.770> that's

00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:30.100 
think about the grocery owner that's

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:31.770 
think about the grocery owner that's
involved<00:07:30.610> in<00:07:30.700> that<00:07:30.820> that<00:07:30.880> could<00:07:31.270> be<00:07:31.300> six<00:07:31.660> to

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:31.780 
involved in that that could be six to

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:33.530 
involved in that that could be six to
eight<00:07:31.840> thousand<00:07:32.290> dollars<00:07:32.560> in<00:07:32.620> gross<00:07:32.860> revenue

00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:33.540 
eight thousand dollars in gross revenue

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:36.000 
eight thousand dollars in gross revenue
you<00:07:34.540> know<00:07:34.660> that<00:07:35.050> is<00:07:35.230> gross<00:07:35.410> revenue<00:07:35.800> so<00:07:35.920> you

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:36.010 
you know that is gross revenue so you

00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:37.380 
you know that is gross revenue so you
don't<00:07:36.160> have<00:07:36.340> the<00:07:36.460> variable<00:07:36.820> cost<00:07:37.060> and<00:07:37.300> there

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:37.390 
don't have the variable cost and there

00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:38.760 
don't have the variable cost and there
so<00:07:37.540> you<00:07:37.630> don't<00:07:37.780> have<00:07:37.870> your<00:07:37.930> fuel<00:07:38.260> in<00:07:38.470> there<00:07:38.680> and

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:38.770 
so you don't have your fuel in there and

00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:39.960 
so you don't have your fuel in there and
you<00:07:38.830> don't<00:07:38.920> have<00:07:39.010> some<00:07:39.190> maintenance<00:07:39.400> cost<00:07:39.760> but

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:39.970 
you don't have some maintenance cost but

00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:41.130 
you don't have some maintenance cost but
you<00:07:40.000> still<00:07:40.270> have<00:07:40.390> that<00:07:40.420> truck<00:07:40.720> payment<00:07:40.870> in

00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:41.140 
you still have that truck payment in

00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:42.720 
you still have that truck payment in
there<00:07:41.320> and<00:07:41.680> you<00:07:41.860> still<00:07:42.100> have<00:07:42.190> your<00:07:42.250> personal

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:42.730 
there and you still have your personal

00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:45.030 
there and you still have your personal
obligations<00:07:43.300> so<00:07:43.840> even<00:07:44.320> if<00:07:44.410> you<00:07:44.470> cut<00:07:44.710> that<00:07:44.890> in

00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:45.040 
obligations so even if you cut that in

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:46.800 
obligations so even if you cut that in
half<00:07:45.070> let's<00:07:45.700> cut<00:07:45.880> it<00:07:46.000> in<00:07:46.090> half<00:07:46.240> and<00:07:46.510> say<00:07:46.630> that

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:46.810 
half let's cut it in half and say that

00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:48.420 
half let's cut it in half and say that
the<00:07:46.930> true<00:07:47.110> cost<00:07:47.380> of<00:07:47.560> that<00:07:47.680> is<00:07:47.860> three<00:07:48.100> to<00:07:48.220> four

00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:48.430 
the true cost of that is three to four

00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:50.100 
the true cost of that is three to four
thousand<00:07:48.850> dollars<00:07:49.090> well<00:07:49.690> you<00:07:49.780> just<00:07:49.930> made<00:07:50.080> a

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:50.110 
thousand dollars well you just made a

00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:52.050 
thousand dollars well you just made a
twenty<00:07:50.440> four<00:07:50.620> hundred<00:07:50.650> dollar<00:07:51.040> move<00:07:51.340> so

00:07:52.050 --> 00:07:52.060 
twenty four hundred dollar move so

00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:53.340 
twenty four hundred dollar move so
you're<00:07:52.180> sixteen<00:07:52.510> hundred<00:07:52.780> bucks<00:07:52.960> in<00:07:53.080> the<00:07:53.170> debt

00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:53.350 
you're sixteen hundred bucks in the debt

00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:54.690 
you're sixteen hundred bucks in the debt
you've<00:07:53.590> interrupted<00:07:53.860> your<00:07:54.190> cash<00:07:54.400> flow

00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:54.700 
you've interrupted your cash flow

00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:58.080 
you've interrupted your cash flow
significantly<00:07:56.040> so<00:07:57.040> you<00:07:57.640> do<00:07:57.790> that<00:07:57.970> a<00:07:58.000> couple

00:07:58.080 --> 00:07:58.090 
significantly so you do that a couple

00:07:58.090 --> 00:08:00.090 
significantly so you do that a couple
times<00:07:58.540> in<00:07:58.690> a<00:07:58.750> year<00:07:58.930> and<00:07:58.990> you're<00:07:59.110> probably<00:07:59.290> you
