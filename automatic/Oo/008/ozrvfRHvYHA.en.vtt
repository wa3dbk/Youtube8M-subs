00:00:03.589 --> 00:00:07.070 

see<00:00:04.589> how<00:00:04.770> the<00:00:04.830> gridlines<00:00:05.480> map<00:00:06.480> and<00:00:06.779> follow

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
see how the gridlines map and follow

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.350 
see how the gridlines map and follow
exactly<00:00:07.350> where<00:00:07.919> that<00:00:08.099> flow<00:00:08.309> is<00:00:08.490> so<00:00:09.120> you<00:00:09.210> can

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
exactly where that flow is so you can

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.000 
exactly where that flow is so you can
see<00:00:09.599> those<00:00:09.780> vortices<00:00:09.960> underneath<00:00:10.650> you<00:00:10.860> can

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
see those vortices underneath you can

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.370 
see those vortices underneath you can
see<00:00:11.190> the<00:00:11.309> curls<00:00:11.639> of<00:00:11.910> the<00:00:12.030> grid<00:00:12.269> as<00:00:12.480> they<00:00:12.900> map<00:00:13.139> to

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
see the curls of the grid as they map to

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:14.870 
see the curls of the grid as they map to
that<00:00:13.559> flow<00:00:13.830> and<00:00:14.009> so<00:00:14.130> we're<00:00:14.610> tracking

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
that flow and so we're tracking

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.180 
that flow and so we're tracking
temperature<00:00:15.660> and<00:00:15.870> density<00:00:15.990> and<00:00:16.320> every<00:00:16.890> single

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
temperature and density and every single

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.460 
temperature and density and every single
flow<00:00:17.369> property<00:00:17.760> that<00:00:17.910> we've<00:00:18.029> got<00:00:18.289> what<00:00:19.289> would

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
flow property that we've got what would

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.349 
flow property that we've got what would
be<00:00:19.560> low<00:00:19.710> density<00:00:20.100> where<00:00:20.189> it's<00:00:20.340> hot<00:00:20.550> and<00:00:20.789> you'll

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
be low density where it's hot and you'll

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.330 
be low density where it's hot and you'll
see<00:00:21.570> all<00:00:21.810> the<00:00:22.020> acoustic<00:00:22.410> waves<00:00:22.650> start

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
see all the acoustic waves start

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.509 
see all the acoustic waves start
traveling<00:00:23.699> around<00:00:23.939> so<00:00:24.410> as<00:00:25.410> it<00:00:25.529> expands<00:00:26.039> first

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
traveling around so as it expands first

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:27.650 
traveling around so as it expands first
the<00:00:26.670> bottom<00:00:26.939> of<00:00:27.029> the<00:00:27.090> left-hand<00:00:27.449> sides

reflect<00:00:28.699> and<00:00:29.699> you've<00:00:29.820> still<00:00:30.029> got<00:00:30.179> pretty

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
reflect and you've still got pretty

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:31.400 
reflect and you've still got pretty
steady<00:00:30.630> burning<00:00:30.960> although<00:00:31.109> you<00:00:31.199> can<00:00:31.320> already

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
steady burning although you can already

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:32.420 
steady burning although you can already
see<00:00:31.679> in<00:00:31.769> the<00:00:31.830> bottom<00:00:32.040> left<00:00:32.219> hand<00:00:32.279> corner

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.190 
see in the bottom left hand corner
things<00:00:32.940> are<00:00:33.090> changing<00:00:33.420> you<00:00:33.480> can<00:00:33.600> see<00:00:33.750> lots<00:00:33.989> of

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
things are changing you can see lots of

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.200 
things are changing you can see lots of
these<00:00:34.350> waves<00:00:34.920> traveling<00:00:35.550> outlets<00:00:35.880> from<00:00:36.059> it

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
these waves traveling outlets from it

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.690 
these waves traveling outlets from it
some<00:00:36.719> come<00:00:36.930> in<00:00:37.079> reflecting<00:00:37.530> off<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.649> top<00:00:37.980> slam

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
some come in reflecting off the top slam

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.670 
some come in reflecting off the top slam
into<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:39.059> bottle<00:00:39.329> and<00:00:39.420> start<00:00:39.719> distorting<00:00:40.379> it

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
into the bottle and start distorting it

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.410 
into the bottle and start distorting it
and<00:00:40.800> compressing<00:00:41.250> it<00:00:41.370> leading<00:00:41.940> up<00:00:42.090> ahead<00:00:42.239> of

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
and compressing it leading up ahead of

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.700 
and compressing it leading up ahead of
it<00:00:42.600> you've<00:00:42.719> got<00:00:42.870> all<00:00:43.079> these<00:00:43.200> other<00:00:43.379> acoustic

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
it you've got all these other acoustic

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.010 
it you've got all these other acoustic
waves<00:00:44.129> adding<00:00:44.579> on<00:00:44.700> to<00:00:44.850> each<00:00:44.969> other<00:00:45.180> and<00:00:45.780> so<00:00:45.899> we

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
waves adding on to each other and so we

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.229 
waves adding on to each other and so we
turn<00:00:46.200> on<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:46.379> grid<00:00:46.620> and<00:00:46.850> remember<00:00:47.850> I<00:00:47.879> said<00:00:48.000> to

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
turn on the grid and remember I said to

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.029 
turn on the grid and remember I said to
you<00:00:48.300> when<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.750> grid<00:00:48.989> is<00:00:49.110> really<00:00:49.379> refined<00:00:49.739> all

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
you when the grid is really refined all

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.350 
you when the grid is really refined all
you<00:00:50.160> see<00:00:50.340> is<00:00:50.430> a<00:00:50.460> white<00:00:50.730> blur<00:00:51.000> because<00:00:51.180> the

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
you see is a white blur because the

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.779 
you see is a white blur because the
cells<00:00:51.600> are<00:00:51.750> so<00:00:52.020> incredibly<00:00:52.500> fine<00:00:52.710> you<00:00:53.280> can<00:00:53.460> see

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
cells are so incredibly fine you can see

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.360 
cells are so incredibly fine you can see
the<00:00:53.969> grid<00:00:54.300> tracking<00:00:55.110> each<00:00:55.649> of<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.039> wave<00:00:56.190> front

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
the grid tracking each of the wave front

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.279 
the grid tracking each of the wave front
of<00:00:56.640> these<00:00:56.699> acoustic<00:00:57.210> waves<00:00:57.390> if<00:00:57.989> you<00:00:58.079> look<00:00:58.170> on

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
of these acoustic waves if you look on

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.380 
of these acoustic waves if you look on
the<00:00:58.410> left<00:00:58.590> hand<00:00:58.800> side<00:00:58.890> blue<00:00:59.789> air<00:00:59.940> is<00:01:00.090> actually

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
the left hand side blue air is actually

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:01.729 
the left hand side blue air is actually
where<00:01:00.539> it's<00:01:00.660> burning<00:01:01.079> it's<00:01:01.140> where<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.410> flame

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
where it's burning it's where the flame

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.070 
where it's burning it's where the flame
is<00:01:01.770> and<00:01:02.399> you<00:01:02.520> can<00:01:02.699> see<00:01:02.879> this<00:01:03.000> it's<00:01:03.270> tracking<00:01:03.780> so

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
is and you can see this it's tracking so

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.109 
is and you can see this it's tracking so
much<00:01:04.260> detail<00:01:04.500> in<00:01:04.769> flame<00:01:05.070> I'll<00:01:05.729> show<00:01:05.939> you<00:01:06.000> on

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
much detail in flame I'll show you on

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.310 
much detail in flame I'll show you on
the<00:01:06.210> next<00:01:06.390> video<00:01:06.510> exactly<00:01:07.020> what<00:01:07.140> kind<00:01:07.290> of

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
the next video exactly what kind of

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.350 
the next video exactly what kind of
detail<00:01:07.619> is<00:01:07.710> tracking<00:01:08.100> it's<00:01:08.610> just<00:01:08.880> at<00:01:09.210> this

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
detail is tracking it's just at this

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.359 
detail is tracking it's just at this
point<00:01:09.600> and<00:01:10.200> so<00:01:10.590> you<00:01:10.680> can<00:01:10.799> see<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.070> flame

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
point and so you can see the flame

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.460 
point and so you can see the flame
beginning<00:01:11.850> to<00:01:11.970> form<00:01:12.210> and<00:01:12.780> it<00:01:12.869> gets<00:01:12.990> hotter<00:01:13.260> and

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
beginning to form and it gets hotter and

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.469 
beginning to form and it gets hotter and
hotter<00:01:13.590> in<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:13.979> core<00:01:14.189> and<00:01:14.460> it's<00:01:14.939> burning<00:01:15.360> in

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
hotter in the core and it's burning in

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:16.969 
hotter in the core and it's burning in
that<00:01:15.630> bubble<00:01:15.840> that<00:01:16.080> you<00:01:16.170> saw<00:01:16.350> expanding<00:01:16.890> it

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
that bubble that you saw expanding it

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.310 
that bubble that you saw expanding it
first<00:01:17.220> and<00:01:17.549> again<00:01:18.090> what<00:01:18.240> you'll<00:01:18.360> see<00:01:18.570> is<00:01:18.720> the

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
first and again what you'll see is the

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.260 
first and again what you'll see is the
pressure<00:01:19.590> wave<00:01:19.740> travels<00:01:20.490> down<00:01:20.700> and<00:01:20.909> hits<00:01:21.090> it

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
pressure wave travels down and hits it

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.760 
pressure wave travels down and hits it
it<00:01:21.360> starts<00:01:21.689> distorting<00:01:22.170> that<00:01:22.320> flame<00:01:22.560> it

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
it starts distorting that flame it

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.710 
it starts distorting that flame it
pushes<00:01:23.100> it<00:01:23.220> down<00:01:23.369> in<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:23.640> top<00:01:23.850> and<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.630> bottom

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
pushes it down in the top and the bottom

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:25.969 
pushes it down in the top and the bottom
left<00:01:24.990> hand<00:01:25.049> corner<00:01:25.229> is<00:01:25.500> a<00:01:25.560> bit<00:01:25.680> of<00:01:25.740> unburned

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
left hand corner is a bit of unburned

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.530 
left hand corner is a bit of unburned
gas<00:01:26.280> something<00:01:26.640> just<00:01:26.759> reflected<00:01:27.270> out<00:01:27.360> of<00:01:27.450> a

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
gas something just reflected out of a

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.420 
gas something just reflected out of a
corner<00:01:27.810> there<00:01:27.990> and<00:01:28.409> you<00:01:28.470> can<00:01:28.619> see<00:01:28.829> it<00:01:28.890> rolling

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
corner there and you can see it rolling

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:30.920 
corner there and you can see it rolling
up<00:01:29.549> around<00:01:29.939> that<00:01:30.210> area<00:01:30.420> you<00:01:30.479> can<00:01:30.600> see<00:01:30.750> that

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
up around that area you can see that
