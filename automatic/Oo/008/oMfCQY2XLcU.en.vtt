00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
the right is becoming extremely crowded

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.100 
the right is becoming extremely crowded
and<00:03:19.820> your<00:03:20.000> team<00:03:20.180> can't<00:03:20.450> handle<00:03:20.720> it<00:03:20.840> then<00:03:20.870> of

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.110 
and your team can't handle it then of

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:22.770 
and your team can't handle it then of
course<00:03:21.350> switch<00:03:21.650> sides<00:03:21.950> and<00:03:22.100> give<00:03:22.280> them<00:03:22.459> a<00:03:22.489> hand

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
course switch sides and give them a hand

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.390 
course switch sides and give them a hand
but<00:03:23.780> if<00:03:23.900> you<00:03:24.019> control<00:03:24.410> one<00:03:24.620> engagement<00:03:24.950> on<00:03:25.220> one

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
but if you control one engagement on one

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.819 
but if you control one engagement on one
side<00:03:25.730> then<00:03:26.030> you're<00:03:26.180> really<00:03:26.560> you're<00:03:27.560> doing

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:27.829 
side then you're really you're doing

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:29.110

yourself and your team a favor because

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.729 
yourself and your team a favor because
that<00:03:29.360> way<00:03:29.510> you're<00:03:29.690> lowering<00:03:30.200> the<00:03:30.350> odds<00:03:30.500> of<00:03:30.620> you

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:30.739 
that way you're lowering the odds of you

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:32.020 
that way you're lowering the odds of you
getting<00:03:30.860> killed<00:03:31.160> but<00:03:31.340> you're<00:03:31.489> also<00:03:31.640> able<00:03:31.880> to

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
getting killed but you're also able to

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:33.940 
getting killed but you're also able to
control<00:03:32.390> one<00:03:32.630> area<00:03:32.930> and<00:03:33.140> you<00:03:33.620> weren't<00:03:33.739> too

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:33.950

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
I hop in the tank here because no one

liked to have been engineer because that

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.330 
liked to have been engineer because that
way<00:03:41.209> if<00:03:41.299> I<00:03:41.420> take<00:03:41.690> and<00:03:41.870> repair<00:03:42.140> or<00:03:42.380> if<00:03:42.769> I<00:03:42.950> taken

way if I take and repair or if I taken

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:44.350 
way if I take and repair or if I taken
damage<00:03:43.459> I<00:03:43.640> would've<00:03:43.790> been<00:03:43.850> able<00:03:43.940> to<00:03:44.090> repair

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:44.360

I'd<00:03:49.400> be<00:03:49.579> just<00:03:49.790> as<00:03:49.910> effective<00:03:50.090> even<00:03:50.660> if<00:03:50.810> I

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 
I'd be just as effective even if I

I'd be just as effective even if I

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
wasn't running engineer because this way

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.340 
wasn't running engineer because this way
I'm<00:03:52.489> forced<00:03:53.239> to<00:03:53.299> be<00:03:53.450> playing<00:03:53.720> more<00:03:53.900> patient

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:54.350 
I'm forced to be playing more patient

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:56.259 
I'm forced to be playing more patient
because<00:03:54.560> I'm<00:03:54.680> not<00:03:54.799> guaranteed<00:03:55.459> that

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:56.269 
because I'm not guaranteed that

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:59.500 
because I'm not guaranteed that

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:49.620

it's<00:04:49.770> like<00:04:50.009> it<00:04:50.159> you<00:04:50.669> can<00:04:50.819> get<00:04:50.970> boxed<00:04:51.389> in<00:04:51.509> from

it's like it you can get boxed in from
all<00:04:51.840> sides<00:04:51.870> and<00:04:52.409> then<00:04:52.500> 23<00:04:52.860> RPGs<00:04:53.310> are<00:04:53.340> disabled

but I tend to like I was alluded to

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:49.909 
but I tend to like I was alluded to
earlier<00:05:47.340> I<00:05:47.669> tend<00:05:48.000> to<00:05:48.120> play<00:05:48.360> less<00:05:49.289> aggressive

00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:49.919 
earlier I tend to play less aggressive

00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:52.640 
earlier I tend to play less aggressive
when<00:05:50.190> I<00:05:50.250> know<00:05:50.400> I<00:05:51.000> don't<00:05:51.719> have<00:05:52.020> the<00:05:52.259> ability<00:05:52.349> to

repair or when I don't have a teammate
willing<00:05:54.960> to<00:05:55.199> repair<00:05:55.620> it's<00:05:56.370> just<00:05:56.669> the<00:05:56.909> logical

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:57.090 
willing to repair it's just the logical

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:58.670 
willing to repair it's just the logical
choice<00:05:57.419> to<00:05:57.630> keep<00:05:58.050> yourself<00:05:58.289> and<00:05:58.590> your

in<00:06:03.509> controlling<00:06:03.900> this<00:06:04.110> area<00:06:04.440> and<00:06:04.620> I<00:06:05.039> think<00:06:05.219> it

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:05.310 
in controlling this area and I think it

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:06.950 
in controlling this area and I think it
was<00:06:05.400> a<00:06:05.430> perfect<00:06:05.789> illustration<00:06:05.880> as<00:06:06.419> eloquently

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:06.960 
was a perfect illustration as eloquently

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:09.439 
was a perfect illustration as eloquently
shown<00:06:07.229> in<00:06:07.469> the<00:06:07.620> video<00:06:07.710> here<00:06:08.219> exactly<00:06:08.729> how<00:06:09.090> that

00:06:09.439 --> 00:06:09.449 
shown in the video here exactly how that

00:06:09.449 --> 00:06:12.920 
shown in the video here exactly how that
went<00:06:09.659> about<00:06:10.190> but<00:06:11.190> again<00:06:11.599> don't<00:06:12.599> immediately

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:12.930 
went about but again don't immediately

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:14.600 
went about but again don't immediately
assume<00:06:13.469> the<00:06:13.500> middle<00:06:13.860> is<00:06:13.979> exactly<00:06:14.340> where<00:06:14.520> you

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:14.610 
assume the middle is exactly where you

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:16.180 
assume the middle is exactly where you

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:16.190 
should go if you've seen this footage

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:19.680 
from me because it worked out this match

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:22.490 
from me because it worked out this match
because<00:06:20.539> the<00:06:21.539> team<00:06:21.750> was<00:06:21.900> doing<00:06:22.110> a<00:06:22.169> good<00:06:22.289> job<00:06:22.349> of
