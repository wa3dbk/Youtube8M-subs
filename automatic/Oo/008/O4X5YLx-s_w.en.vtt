00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.780
 I hope there is a little light in the 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:36.970

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:39.040

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.579

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.270
 how good is my channel if you want to see it 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:52.720

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:54.890
 I really do not want to play so 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:56.960
 I will try to play one minute two minutes if 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.300
 I see that I am very afraid of unemployment and it is already 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.760
 is that I do not want I do not like we're going to 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.610
 give it to play and we're already going there 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.629
 we go 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:06.629
 to see what happens here 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:14.110
 man metal man to see the game is 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.690
 an indie game and you see the graphics so 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:18.520
 bad that you have in fact is very 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:20.830
 mouse or if you are watching but it gets worse 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.330
 my mouse I do not know why but good 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:24.520
 game is an indie is badly done 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.410
 obviously but this one does not and that does not 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:29.280
 like nothing guys is iplayer just me 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:31.810
 like nothing to see finds five 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.360
 amuletos bug you are not looking for is a bug 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:37.509
 something like that and destroys the spell of 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:40.960
 signs ok we have to go there 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:44.140
 I gather it my mother my mother that I 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:47.759
 I'm serious and it's strange to play 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.759
 with him with the mouse there 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.920
 I hope that music is like it is 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.189
 sell to the leader plays only one 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.480
 time and one and no more so I do not like it 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.070
 nothing this 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:02.890
 I deduce that we have to go there 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:06.010
 because here we have not been made spells 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.960
 so it 's like a spell not so 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:10.720
 we will have to go there to see no no 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:13.450
