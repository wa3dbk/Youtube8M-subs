yeah<00:00:57.090> you<00:00:57.149> can<00:00:57.300> jump<00:00:57.750> on<00:00:57.870> them<00:00:58.020> right<00:00:58.410> when

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
yeah you can jump on them right when

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.619 
yeah you can jump on them right when
they<00:00:58.680> pop<00:00:58.859> out<00:00:58.980> of<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.129> ground<00:00:59.210> to<00:01:00.210> kill<00:01:00.449> them

they pop out of the ground to kill them

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.179 
they pop out of the ground to kill them
but<00:01:01.230> it's<00:01:01.530> easy<00:01:01.680> just<00:01:01.800> to<00:01:02.100> avoid<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:02.460> wrenches

00:01:04.179 --> 00:01:04.189 
but it's easy just to avoid the wrenches

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:10.960 
but it's easy just to avoid the wrenches
like<00:01:05.189> I<00:01:05.339> almost<00:01:05.519> did<00:01:05.790> not<00:01:05.970> do<00:01:06.260> good<00:01:07.260> job<00:01:07.700> or

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:10.970 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.660 

maybe<00:01:11.970> I<00:01:12.090> shouldn't<00:01:12.420> spend<00:01:12.630> jump<00:01:13.549> and<00:01:14.549> this

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
maybe I shouldn't spend jump and this

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.550 
maybe I shouldn't spend jump and this
music's<00:01:15.119> so<00:01:15.240> I<00:01:15.270> pick<00:01:15.509> us<00:01:15.600> on<00:01:15.750> like<00:01:15.900> an<00:01:16.020> organ<00:01:16.439> or

something
jazz<00:01:17.810> synthesizer<00:01:19.490> boom<00:01:20.490> boom<00:01:22.130> power<00:01:23.130> up

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
jazz synthesizer boom boom power up

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.539 
jazz synthesizer boom boom power up
maybe<00:01:23.970> a<00:01:24.240> quick<00:01:25.170> nope<00:01:25.530> but<00:01:26.009> we<00:01:26.130> can<00:01:26.310> go<00:01:26.400> down

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
maybe a quick nope but we can go down

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.210 
maybe a quick nope but we can go down
the<00:01:26.640> pipe<00:01:26.900> because<00:01:27.900> if<00:01:28.170> we<00:01:28.320> couldn't<00:01:28.560> I'd<00:01:28.829> be

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
the pipe because if we couldn't I'd be

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.179 
the pipe because if we couldn't I'd be
toast<00:01:29.840> yes<00:01:30.840> if<00:01:31.020> your<00:01:31.170> unless<00:01:31.560> when<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:31.920> screen

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
toast yes if your unless when the screen

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.030 
toast yes if your unless when the screen
moves<00:01:32.430> by<00:01:33.590> cuz<00:01:34.590> they'll<00:01:34.710> probably<00:01:34.860> get

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
moves by cuz they'll probably get

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.350 
moves by cuz they'll probably get
crushed<00:01:35.280> against<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.909> wall

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.920 

so<00:01:40.650> jump<00:01:41.650> on<00:01:41.770> these<00:01:41.950> wheels<00:01:42.220> are<00:01:42.550> capturing

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
so jump on these wheels are capturing

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.750 
so jump on these wheels are capturing
theme<00:01:43.930> on<00:01:44.080> this<00:01:44.170> level<00:01:44.410> not<00:01:44.860> really<00:01:45.130> the<00:01:45.280> same

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:45.760 
theme on this level not really the same

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.480 
theme on this level not really the same
yeah<00:01:46.600> it's<00:01:47.380> not<00:01:47.500> super<00:01:47.860> wheels<00:01:48.070> all<00:01:48.250> over<00:01:48.430> the

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.490 
yeah it's not super wheels all over the

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:53.760 
yeah it's not super wheels all over the
place<00:01:49.590> I'm<00:01:50.590> arguing<00:01:51.190> with<00:01:51.430> myself<00:01:52.590> and<00:01:53.590> look

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
place I'm arguing with myself and look

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:55.250 
place I'm arguing with myself and look
at<00:01:53.860> all<00:01:53.950> the<00:01:54.070> clouds<00:01:54.370> in<00:01:54.820> the<00:01:54.910> background

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:55.260 
at all the clouds in the background

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.780 
at all the clouds in the background
because<00:01:56.260> when<00:01:56.440> we<00:01:56.560> got<00:01:56.710> here<00:01:56.920> we<00:01:57.100> were<00:01:57.250> walking

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:57.790 
because when we got here we were walking

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:59.300 
because when we got here we were walking
on<00:01:57.880> clouds

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
on clouds

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.940 
on clouds
does<00:02:00.310> that<00:02:00.400> make<00:02:00.580> sense<00:02:01.650> not<00:02:02.650> really

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
does that make sense not really

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:08.340 
does that make sense not really
