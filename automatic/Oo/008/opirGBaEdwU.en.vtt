00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
hamster application from which you which

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.320 
hamster application from which you which
we<00:01:56.190> were<00:01:56.369> trying<00:01:56.670> to<00:01:56.820> install<00:01:57.090> the

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:57.330 
we were trying to install the

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:02.590 
we were trying to install the
application<00:01:58.290> now<00:01:58.890> it<00:01:59.100> should<00:01:59.220> get<00:01:59.400> installed

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.440 

install<00:02:03.600> this<00:02:03.720> or<00:02:03.869> not<00:02:04.940> so<00:02:05.940> right<00:02:06.090> now<00:02:06.300> it<00:02:06.360> is

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
install this or not so right now it is

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.999 
install this or not so right now it is
decoding<00:02:07.110> this<00:02:07.200> application<00:02:09.860> solution<00:02:10.860> is

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
decoding this application solution is

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.940 
decoding this application solution is
very<00:02:11.760> quick<00:02:12.120> so<00:02:12.690> it<00:02:12.810> seems<00:02:13.110> that<00:02:13.200> this

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
very quick so it seems that this

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.400 
very quick so it seems that this
particular<00:02:14.190> application<00:02:14.820> might<00:02:15.750> be<00:02:15.989> already

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
particular application might be already

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.650 
particular application might be already
on<00:02:16.680> the<00:02:17.190> inside<00:02:17.640> the<00:02:18.000> memory<00:02:18.300> of<00:02:18.510> this

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
on the inside the memory of this

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.199 
on the inside the memory of this
particular<00:02:19.500> tablet<00:02:19.709> so<00:02:20.370> that<00:02:20.610> is<00:02:20.790> why<00:02:20.910> it<00:02:20.970> is

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
particular tablet so that is why it is

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:22.970 
particular tablet so that is why it is
getting<00:02:21.390> installed<00:02:21.810> so<00:02:22.350> basically<00:02:22.680> the<00:02:22.890> app

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
getting installed so basically the app

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.110 
getting installed so basically the app
store<00:02:23.220> application<00:02:23.400> or<00:02:23.820> any<00:02:23.850> other

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
store application or any other

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.940 
store application or any other
application<00:02:24.420> which<00:02:24.900> use<00:02:25.080> one<00:02:25.530> to<00:02:25.680> install

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
application which use one to install

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.880 
application which use one to install
other<00:02:26.670> than<00:02:26.970> go<00:02:27.390> from<00:02:27.690> Android<00:02:28.050> Market<00:02:28.440> maybe

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
other than go from Android Market maybe

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.580 
other than go from Android Market maybe
from<00:02:29.130> a<00:02:29.250> pendrive<00:02:29.670> or<00:02:29.820> some<00:02:30.090> USB<00:02:30.390> source<00:02:30.780> then

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
from a pendrive or some USB source then

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.770 
from a pendrive or some USB source then
you<00:02:31.739> can<00:02:32.010> you<00:02:32.459> have<00:02:32.670> to<00:02:32.820> enable<00:02:33.030> the<00:02:33.360> unknown

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780
