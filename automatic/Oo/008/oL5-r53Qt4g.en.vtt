00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 good morning everyone and common are 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.210
 dvd.it was the facebook meeting at 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.970
 our site in description and today I am 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.219
 with a new video with a little why 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.740
 unfortunately the weather was what it was in 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.710
 more and more servers have been added today 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:20.279
 break the chestnuts then just now as well 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.960
 at 8 it's crazy we could come on 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.430
 play to record a video a package 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.519
 opening because I went out in packages 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.960
 from 50,000 so we open three packages 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.570
 of 50 thousand 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.480
 hoping that at 114,000 find again 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:36.090
 even a little bit earlier than at least 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:39.210
 I can keep them good hopefully 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.969
 now go see that it looks like i 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:45.440
 servers do what they want 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.440
 let's see if he can at least leave here 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:54.899
 here then that after ten minutes 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:56.730
 the shop has finally started e 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.149
 then we open these packages with 12 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.920
 players all gold and all rare 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:06.450
 114 thousand credits therefore there are missing 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:08.240
 let me deal with 36,000 36 thousand 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.159
 guys today are good at math 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.080
 evidence of you that the reaction times of the 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.840
 game are what they are 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.670
 here are the insults of laupen and it is 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.860
 insulted in a manner of speaking and immediately 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.150
 left and tells me that I found a 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.040
 player of my favorite team 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.830
 so I found a player from 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:29.790
 rome because I found maicon see that 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:34.460

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:37.409

 I didn't notice it but it's okay with me 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.899
 point I will have to cry then 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.219
 let's start with the second few we leave 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.170
 obviously because once he has 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:01.259
 opened the first there he left with the second 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:04.710
 package and see if this time it is 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:10.500

 substance I found really little and not 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.740
 me 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:20.310
 the de facto 50,000 credits is one 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:25.470
 which, however, fills my soul 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:27.660
 really a very nice thing this is 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.610
 so after he threw me out 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.010
 time after i had to go i 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.240
 credits of andry canon afte 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.520
 He threw me out again 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:38.070
 in short, after half an hour we are here nova 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:40.110
 to record hoping to succeed open 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:41.520
 at least the last 50,000 package 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.170
 since even the first two were born of 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.910
 shit this is a day of 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.830
 shit 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:48.840
 translated we open the latter package 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:50.280
 take a ride in the chair look at me 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.380
 in all my beauty I make a 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:56.130
 ride in the chair you should see me like 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:57.750
 I got sick of the package now 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:00.920
 obviously not siap and I make time to 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:04.470
 do the jerk another branch twenty times 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:06.510

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:10.740
 bad jovetic 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:12.300
 moutinho abbot santana in itself would be 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:16.650
 also a nice package but being that 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:18.120
 these are worth an escarpment in the ass is 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.010
 in short, a nice package 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.740
 because we know we like them 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:25.940
 no ass, no one in my ass 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:29.070
 jovetic and benzema 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:34.800
 if sending it to the club and the rest 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:37.340
 I delete everything from 114 thousand plus credits 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:39.959
 that I have passed after we return to 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:42.630
 14,000 credits and for my happiness 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:45.570
 we have a package of 7500 or rather no mi 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:48.180
 300 to 15,000 are missing for the curate every 

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:50.280
 300 credits that served our hero 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:53.340
 to open the package we go to 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:55.560
 open a package of course for 15,000 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.840
 because you know that you can't finish one 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.840

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:11.370
 but at least we have something good 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:16.620
