can still

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.260 
can still
it's<00:03:25.230> okay<00:03:25.770> skinny<00:03:26.190> tires<00:03:26.520> you've<00:03:27.030> got<00:03:27.180> to

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:27.270 
it's okay skinny tires you've got to

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:29.690 
it's okay skinny tires you've got to
watch<00:03:27.420> how<00:03:27.660> much<00:03:27.810> grip<00:03:28.140> you've<00:03:28.380> got<00:03:28.620> but<00:03:29.550> it's

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
watch how much grip you've got but it's

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.590 
watch how much grip you've got but it's
very<00:03:30.030> very<00:03:30.600> point-and-shoot<00:03:31.560> this<00:03:32.420> the<00:03:33.420> only

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
very very point-and-shoot this the only

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:34.910 
very very point-and-shoot this the only
thing<00:03:33.750> is<00:03:33.840> the<00:03:33.960> brakes<00:03:34.260> obviously<00:03:34.770> we've<00:03:34.890> got

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
thing is the brakes obviously we've got

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.540 
thing is the brakes obviously we've got
discs<00:03:35.310> at<00:03:35.430> the<00:03:35.520> front<00:03:35.760> drums<00:03:36.180> at<00:03:36.450> the<00:03:36.660> back

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:37.550 
discs at the front drums at the back

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:40.670 
discs at the front drums at the back
don't<00:03:38.550> expect<00:03:39.060> modern<00:03:39.510> take<00:03:39.750> our<00:03:40.050> performance

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
don't expect modern take our performance

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.620 
don't expect modern take our performance
but<00:03:41.400> I<00:03:41.430> suppose<00:03:41.790> this<00:03:41.940> lightness<00:03:42.330> actually

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
but I suppose this lightness actually

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:44.510 
but I suppose this lightness actually
helps<00:03:42.870> it<00:03:42.960> they're<00:03:43.080> not<00:03:43.230> as<00:03:43.410> bad<00:03:43.770> as<00:03:44.100> a<00:03:44.160> lot<00:03:44.280> of

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:44.520 
helps it they're not as bad as a lot of

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.730 
helps it they're not as bad as a lot of
classic<00:03:45.150> braking<00:03:45.720> systems<00:03:46.170> that<00:03:46.380> I've<00:03:46.470> tried

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:46.740 
classic braking systems that I've tried

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:50.630 
classic braking systems that I've tried
in<00:03:47.070> the<00:03:47.220> past<00:03:48.380> just<00:03:49.380> over<00:03:49.770> nine<00:03:49.980> thousand

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 
in the past just over nine thousand

were built and to be perfectly honest

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.900
