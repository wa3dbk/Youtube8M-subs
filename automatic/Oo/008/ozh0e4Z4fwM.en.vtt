00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:11.190

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:13.620
 tell about the last bought me 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.830
 I think the books from the video will be interesting 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:20.039
 those who like my videos on the book 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:25.670
 subject and who generally shares my 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:29.759
 treatment interests with whom we have views 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:30.900
 bookstore match and want to start 100 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:35.060
 why is this big 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:37.230
 want to start the more practical thing is 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:40.610
 English course 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:44.039
 I decided to repeat English somehow 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:47.870
 I have not actively used it for a long time 

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:47.870
 and I know what 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:55.199
 by the bank the best books and 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.940
 English textbooks are produced 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:01.350
 suitable for independent work on 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:04.410
 this still drive goes so I think 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.790
 such a book will be very me 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:08.190
 useful all use 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.150
 the very beginning and until the very end that is 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.850
 united 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:16.340
 where I understand two books is what comes out 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.340
 first volume 2 here at once two houses 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.770
 English combined 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:23.930
 even in Kazan a full course here you know 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:26.560
 the bank is the best author of textbooks on 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.560
 English language 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:33.800
 then what book will tell you 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:37.700
 let's talk about fat first 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:39.530
 this is not an art book visiting 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:43.940
 I just like a lion fat 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:46.360
 the era of the late 19th early 20th century and in 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:49.040
 Recently, I became interested without 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:53.030
 a biography of a lion fat and in general here 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:55.520
 such an autobiographical book but such 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:58.960
 I am not an ordinary person at all 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:02.650
 seen since the tour can be met and 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:09.070
 extracts from letters and photographs and 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:14.420
 decoration yes any items 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:19.489
 the interior of the parish besides here 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:22.190
 there are recipes for dishes that a lion ate fat 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:24.350
 before he became a vegetarian and 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.150
 after and in general it is as all in 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:29.870
 shuffle as if not separate some 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:36.799
 The main parts are the mix in a very 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:38.660
 colorfully so presented if you 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:41.330
 fans if this era too 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.650
 interesting and interested in creativity and 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.180
 same 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:47.079
 I don't think of joy either 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.980
 the book is very and not without the work itself 

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:50.730
 Lev Tolstoy 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.000
 What I read is not very 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.860
 famous 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.280
 the fact that the school did not pass but not 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:58.500
 less I have already begun to read of course how 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.480
 it seemed to me 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.540
 This book is unpublished at 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:06.069
 least for me personally from not knowing 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.609
 confession and a life and now I want to read 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:11.109
 these searches 

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:14.859
 I think it will be very interesting after all 

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:16.750
 wise man further dive a little 

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:19.720
 in the economic topic after all 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.400
 an economist by training and I still 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.109
 so far everything is interesting 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.250
 economy well, apparently for good reason 

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:26.799
 Received education 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:28.599
 and as soon as this book came out 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:30.370
 new how economy works for me 

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:32.560
 for some reason I immediately wanted to read it 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.959
 I did not want to read more 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:37.810
 because I still want to understand 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:39.609
 the cause of crises and in general is that 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:42.400
 the moment is happening in the economy 

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:44.739
 at the institute we were taught as it was before 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.680
 what were these earlier theories 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:49.060
 classical theories of demand and consumption 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:51.280
 Now it is clear that all this is not 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.470
 the market economy is fully operational 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.480
 not working and fully controlled 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:57.639
 the state also does not work and here 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:01.329
 the search for this truth in the last resort 

00:03:57.639 --> 00:04:03.730
 of this economic ideal 

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:06.280
 equilibrium can't say perfect 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:09.159
 economic system and the right 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.959
 look at this system here I am very 

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:14.859
 I will try to find here in this book as 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:18.010
 it unites all the theories i think will 

00:04:14.859 --> 00:04:20.370
 I wonder it will be interesting even 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:24.789
 I think it will be interesting to those who also 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:27.909
 interested in the economy and who do not 

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:28.900
 indifferent everything that happens in 

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:32.410
 international 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:33.400
 dancing in the world is another of the novelties this 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:37.080
 book to be 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:40.080
 or be relevant when in the century 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:42.789
 consumerism propaganda use 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:46.330
 It seems to me a great book for 

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:47.590
 brainwashing and of course i 'm sure 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:51.430
 happiness does not depend on how much 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:54.669
 much money do you have in your pocket even more frequently 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:56.560
 it happens that people who have a very 

00:04:54.669 --> 00:05:00.070
 big fortune a lot of money on 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:02.680
 really happy and those who study or 

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:04.510
 can already find happiness and 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:07.810
 the pleasure of some simple ordinary 

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:10.960
 things like comparing with them of course 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:13.660
 many times happier so if you 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:15.160
 also the topic is interesting read more 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:18.250
 one book on financial and economic 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:20.770
 subject well none the less one of the section 

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:23.050
 from the category of fiction this 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:25.660
 Theodore Dreiser's book 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:28.449
 I have long wanted to read it and heard 

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:31.120
 many positive reviews and generally 

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:33.430
 see this series of 100 main books then 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:37.090
 there is this one of the 100 books that you 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:40.750
 must read to be educated 

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:44.710
 man to broaden your horizons 

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:47.220
 I haven't started yet, but I 'm already trembling 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:47.220
 when 

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:53.940
 we end a little secret how am i 

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:56.940
 manage to read a large number of books 

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:58.740
 Well, firstly it is motivation without it 

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:00.620
 anywhere if you have no desire to read 

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:04.530
 most likely you will not force yourself 

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:07.980
 need to find interesting topics that you 

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:10.880
 Currently interested in these spheres 

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:14.630
 generally need to probe and try to find 

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:16.760
 books are just the same on these topics and the best 

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:19.680
 books to society 

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:20.910
 well, or some proven publications on 

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:22.280
 at least then you are definitely not 

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:26.660
 will be disappointed 

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:29.490
 another way of mine besides motivation 

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:30.090
 I very quickly manage to read books in 

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:33.120
 traffic jam 

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:36.570
 especially if someone else is driving 

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:39.450
 you at this time you have at this time and 

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:41.760
 free time and just need not 

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:43.169
 forget to book a little book 

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:45.210
 some interesting which you read 

00:06:43.169 --> 00:06:49.340
 maybe if it's a long journey 

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:51.600
 and on the way my books just fly away 

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:54.600
 here behind 

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:58.200
 sometimes I can read him already 

00:06:54.600 --> 00:07:01.680
 second start in general if you drive 

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:02.820
 then how can you buy a car 

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:05.010
 audio books 

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:06.419
 by the way this is hanging out on 

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:08.110
 much more efficient than just 

00:07:06.419 --> 00:07:11.850
 listening to the radio if 

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:15.130
 will listen to audio books there to teach the world 

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:17.590
 languages ​​are undoubtedly 

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:20.680
 in traffic and generally on the road you spend 

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:24.760
 much time of illness so here are 

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:28.650
 my simple secrets to everyone until we meet again 

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:28.650
 and up to the new videos for now
