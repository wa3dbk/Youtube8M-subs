840 series solid state hard drive now
and<00:00:26.640> also<00:00:27.000> 12<00:00:27.359> gigs<00:00:27.570> of<00:00:27.720> ram<00:00:27.840> so<00:00:27.869> I<00:00:28.170> don't

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
and also 12 gigs of ram so I don't

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.140 
and also 12 gigs of ram so I don't
really<00:00:28.560> think<00:00:28.650> it's<00:00:28.980> my<00:00:29.070> computer<00:00:29.970> that's

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
really think it's my computer that's

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.860 
really think it's my computer that's
causing<00:00:30.630> issues<00:00:31.910> now<00:00:32.910> I<00:00:32.940> was<00:00:33.300> also<00:00:33.600> running

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
causing issues now I was also running

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.530 
causing issues now I was also running
dxtory<00:00:34.469> while<00:00:34.800> recording<00:00:35.130> so<00:00:35.540> that's

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
dxtory while recording so that's

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.049 
dxtory while recording so that's
probably<00:00:36.870> part<00:00:37.200> of<00:00:37.380> what<00:00:37.890> was<00:00:38.010> going<00:00:38.219> on<00:00:38.309> but

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
probably part of what was going on but

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.819 
probably part of what was going on but
anyway<00:00:39.390> here's<00:00:39.660> a<00:00:39.719> little<00:00:40.050> clip<00:00:40.469> of<00:00:40.500> what<00:00:40.800> I

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
anyway here's a little clip of what I

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.090 
anyway here's a little clip of what I
was<00:00:41.070> getting<00:00:41.989> and<00:00:42.989> you<00:00:43.200> can<00:00:43.350> see<00:00:43.559> how<00:00:43.860> it<00:00:44.070> just

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
was getting and you can see how it just

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.160 
was getting and you can see how it just
started<00:00:44.789> flickering<00:00:44.969> and<00:00:45.420> it<00:00:45.510> would<00:00:45.629> go

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
started flickering and it would go

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.590 
started flickering and it would go
you<00:00:46.559> get<00:00:46.710> all<00:00:46.800> jumpy<00:00:47.219> and<00:00:47.460> then<00:00:47.640> like<00:00:48.210> a<00:00:48.300> minute

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
you get all jumpy and then like a minute

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.139 
you get all jumpy and then like a minute
later<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:48.870> game<00:00:49.170> would<00:00:49.350> crash<00:00:49.620> I<00:00:50.340> would<00:00:51.000> be

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
later the game would crash I would be

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.029 
later the game would crash I would be
playing<00:00:51.449> for<00:00:51.899> about<00:00:52.110> an<00:00:52.199> hour<00:00:52.350> and<00:00:52.680> get<00:00:52.829> to<00:00:52.949> the

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
playing for about an hour and get to the

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.549 
playing for about an hour and get to the
end<00:00:53.160> of<00:00:53.280> a<00:00:53.370> mission<00:00:53.550> and<00:00:54.050> as<00:00:55.050> soon<00:00:55.260> as<00:00:55.289> it's

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
end of a mission and as soon as it's

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.010 
end of a mission and as soon as it's
going<00:00:55.800> to<00:00:56.100> go<00:00:56.430> into<00:00:56.610> like<00:00:56.789> a<00:00:56.850> cinematic<00:00:57.480> or<00:00:57.690> an

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
going to go into like a cinematic or an

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.619 
going to go into like a cinematic or an
animation<00:00:58.469> it<00:00:58.890> would<00:00:59.039> crash<00:00:59.370> and<00:00:59.399> yeah<00:01:00.390> yeah

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
animation it would crash and yeah yeah

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.029 
animation it would crash and yeah yeah
it<00:01:00.930> probably<00:01:01.230> happened<00:01:01.500> like<00:01:01.649> seven<00:01:01.949> or<00:01:01.980> eight

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
it probably happened like seven or eight

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.770 
it probably happened like seven or eight
times<00:01:02.250> but<00:01:02.730> you<00:01:03.210> know<00:01:03.300> our<00:01:03.449> team<00:01:03.629> would<00:01:03.719> play

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
times but you know our team would play

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.750 
times but you know our team would play
in<00:01:04.019> a<00:01:04.140> mission<00:01:04.439> for<00:01:04.619> an<00:01:04.739> hour<00:01:04.979> and<00:01:05.339> you've<00:01:05.549> died

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
in a mission for an hour and you've died

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.160 
in a mission for an hour and you've died
a<00:01:05.790> few<00:01:06.000> times<00:01:06.060> and<00:01:06.420> you<00:01:06.510> finally<00:01:06.840> get<00:01:07.020> through

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
a few times and you finally get through

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.980 
a few times and you finally get through
the<00:01:07.320> end<00:01:07.439> only<00:01:08.040> to<00:01:08.460> have<00:01:08.909> a<00:01:08.970> crash<00:01:09.330> you<00:01:09.659> save

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
the end only to have a crash you save

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.609
