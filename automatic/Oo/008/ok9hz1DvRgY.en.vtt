go a bit excessive on the archers here I

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:06.630 
go a bit excessive on the archers here I
didn't<00:02:05.500> want<00:02:05.530> to<00:02:05.739> have<00:02:05.829> to<00:02:05.950> do<00:02:06.099> that<00:02:06.280> through

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
didn't want to have to do that through

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:11.520 
didn't want to have to do that through
this<00:02:06.759> more<00:02:07.030> than<00:02:07.149> once<00:02:09.690> but<00:02:10.690> my<00:02:10.869> archers<00:02:11.380> are

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
this more than once but my archers are

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:17.910 
this more than once but my archers are
only<00:02:11.709> level<00:02:12.430> two<00:02:15.269> my<00:02:16.269> Rams<00:02:16.660> are<00:02:16.930> level<00:02:17.200> four<00:02:17.470> so

only level two my Rams are level four so

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.740 
only level two my Rams are level four so
that's<00:02:18.129> why<00:02:18.340> I<00:02:18.370> was<00:02:18.910> able<00:02:19.060> to<00:02:19.239> get<00:02:19.480> through

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
that's why I was able to get through

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:33.190 
that's why I was able to get through
this<00:02:19.900> one<00:02:20.829> wall<00:02:21.129> with<00:02:21.430> two<00:02:21.700> Rams

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200
