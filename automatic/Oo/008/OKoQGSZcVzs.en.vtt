this and just switched over just to coat

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:47.900 
this and just switched over just to coat
the<00:02:43.950> side<00:02:45.110> let<00:02:46.110> that<00:02:46.260> heat<00:02:46.530> up<00:02:46.769> when<00:02:47.640> it<00:02:47.760> gets

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
the side let that heat up when it gets

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.640 
the side let that heat up when it gets
hot<00:02:48.090> if<00:02:48.209> you<00:02:48.329> feel<00:02:48.720> the<00:02:48.840> top<00:02:49.110> of<00:02:49.230> it<00:02:49.319> like<00:02:49.470> that

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
hot if you feel the top of it like that

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.020 
hot if you feel the top of it like that
you<00:02:49.890> can<00:02:50.010> feel<00:02:50.160> the<00:02:50.190> heat<00:02:50.459> then<00:02:50.670> you<00:02:50.760> know<00:02:50.880> it's

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
seconds when that's hot will be few

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:27.379 
seconds when that's hot will be few
minute<00:03:24.829> ok<00:03:25.829> this<00:03:25.950> is<00:03:26.100> getting<00:03:26.220> hot<00:03:26.579> right<00:03:27.209> now

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:27.389

says<00:03:37.829> Ringo<00:03:38.310> to<00:03:39.620> come<00:03:40.620> in<00:03:40.829> a<00:03:40.889> little<00:03:40.920> hot<00:03:41.310> over

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
says Ringo to come in a little hot over

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.089 
says Ringo to come in a little hot over
to<00:03:41.910> the<00:03:42.840> first<00:03:43.139> one<00:03:43.319> always<00:03:43.470> goes<00:03:43.799> a<00:03:43.829> bit

00:03:44.089 --> 00:03:44.099 
to the first one always goes a bit

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:46.069 
to the first one always goes a bit
running<00:03:44.519> and<00:03:44.760> after<00:03:45.000> that<00:03:45.150> you<00:03:45.810> get<00:03:45.930> the<00:03:46.049> right

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:46.079 
running and after that you get the right

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:49.750 
running and after that you get the right
temperature<00:03:46.799> so<00:03:47.340> I'm<00:03:47.639> good<00:03:48.359> a<00:03:48.450> few<00:03:48.690> minutes

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 
temperature so I'm good a few minutes

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.370 
temperature so I'm good a few minutes
just<00:03:50.760> check<00:03:51.359> it<00:03:51.569> don't<00:03:51.840> leave<00:03:51.989> it<00:03:52.109> in<00:03:52.200> too<00:03:52.290> long

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380 
just check it don't leave it in too long

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:54.979 
just check it don't leave it in too long
because<00:03:52.680> it<00:03:52.829> will<00:03:53.099> just<00:03:53.340> keep<00:03:53.690> lifting<00:03:54.690> it<00:03:54.959> a

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
because it will just keep lifting it a

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:57.530 
because it will just keep lifting it a
little<00:03:55.230> bit<00:03:55.440> like<00:03:56.430> that<00:03:56.639> to<00:03:56.940> see<00:03:57.150> what<00:03:57.299> a<00:03:57.329> home

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
little bit like that to see what a home

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.159 
little bit like that to see what a home
run<00:03:58.079> businesses<00:03:58.530> give<00:03:59.099> it<00:03:59.160> a<00:03:59.190> couple<00:03:59.370> seconds

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:00.169 
run businesses give it a couple seconds

00:04:00.169 --> 00:04:05.059 
run businesses give it a couple seconds
and<00:04:01.169> that<00:04:01.290> should<00:04:01.500> be<00:04:01.590> ok<00:04:03.590> ok<00:04:04.590> off<00:04:04.739> the<00:04:04.889> top<00:04:05.040> of

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:05.069 
and that should be ok ok off the top of

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:06.920 
and that should be ok ok off the top of
seconds<00:04:05.669> but<00:04:05.940> don't<00:04:06.150> leave<00:04:06.329> to<00:04:06.540> walk<00:04:06.720> away

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
seconds but don't leave to walk away

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:09.770

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 
go see that's getting Brown that's ok

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:16.360 
go see that's getting Brown that's ok
and<00:04:14.549> the<00:04:14.880> other<00:04:15.000> side<00:04:15.329> should<00:04:15.599> be<00:04:15.720> the<00:04:15.870> same

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:16.370 
and the other side should be the same

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010 
going to be absorbed into bread to sleep

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:26.710 
going to be absorbed into bread to sleep
like<00:04:23.219> that<00:04:23.280> for<00:04:23.610> few<00:04:23.789> minutes<00:04:25.039> ok<00:04:26.039> before<00:04:26.219> you

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:26.720 
like that for few minutes ok before you

like that for few minutes ok before you
just<00:04:27.500> turn<00:04:27.710> it<00:04:27.740> over<00:04:28.010> one<00:04:28.280> more<00:04:28.310> time<00:04:28.490> to<00:04:28.880> check

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.150 
just turn it over one more time to check

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:32.440 
just turn it over one more time to check
oh<00:04:30.130> look<00:04:31.130> at<00:04:31.250> that<00:04:31.280> that's<00:04:31.520> perfect<00:04:32.120> that<00:04:32.270> is

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:32.450 
oh look at that that's perfect that is

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:35.290 
oh look at that that's perfect that is
that<00:04:32.960> it<00:04:33.290> should<00:04:33.530> be<00:04:33.880> okay<00:04:34.880> now<00:04:34.910> we<00:04:35.150> take

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:35.300 
that it should be okay now we take

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.410 
that it should be okay now we take
thousand<00:04:35.690> percent<00:04:35.900> before<00:04:36.440> you<00:04:36.530> do<00:04:36.740> just<00:04:37.420> toss

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:38.420 
thousand percent before you do just toss
