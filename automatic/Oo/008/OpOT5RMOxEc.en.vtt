00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:05.519
 good youtube pictures thanks to the 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.229
 positive comments to the likes and already 

00:00:05.519 --> 00:00:09.299
 all the visualizations of the guide 

00:00:07.229 --> 00:00:11.460
 rice today we present a guide to 

00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:13.820
 hot Ecuador I hope you enjoy 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.820
 of the video 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:22.590
 Y 

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:31.230
 passive de cali is divided into two 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.970
 disciplinary forms of forces the 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.570
 basic attacks of kling meat in a 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:38.340
 6% more magic damage that increases by 1% 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.370
 for every 6 skill power points 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.739
 discipline of power to cali I get 6% 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.420
 of spell vampirism that increasing 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.570
 1 percent for every six points of the 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.730
 additional attack damage 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:53.270
 now corresponds to the cob that is brand 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:56.750
 the quality killer is a brand that 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:58.820
 this lasts 4 seconds and it can burst 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.620
 with that with a car such is better 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.690
 do it with this second option was scored 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:06.470
 such that because that way more damage is hit and 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:08.570
 recover energy but if hit the whole 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:13.450
 which can mean your death or is very 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:15.430
 risky get better by double 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.740
 to lime and leaves the range of its visibility 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:19.780
 in a mantle that gives magic resistance 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:23.050
 and armor in addition to those that go through 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:25.409
 this mantle is reduced their speed 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:28.229
 in the map 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.909
 the increasing slash that in life is 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:33.060
 a guide petting a rotation 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:35.700
 hit harm mix or to her pe 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.850
 sadistic pepsi range and can be used together 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:41.070
 with the q as I explained earlier 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.259
 Shady dance or better known as the 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.110
 Lute here or stability allows you to 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:48.570
 Cali move with your goals speed 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.020
 I know how the three times is reflected 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.640
 a load of every time you kill 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.539
 best of all is that this ability if 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.539
 it has no energy cost 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:07.349
 well, we start with an amplifier book and 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.489
 an emotion these are the general because 

00:02:07.349 --> 00:02:11.709
 depending if you're playing one of a 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:13.900
 p that breaks you there you have to change it 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:15.430
 will initial priority is to leave with that 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.590
 because that's how we can do the revolver 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:20.860
 gestec and from that we can make stable 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:24.989
 pistols that for the projectile to throw 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.989
 it helps us pretty much to score the combos 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.870
 in the end all the skins have always 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:32.430
 varied from the situation but the items 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.560
 important that almost always have 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.630
 that arming would be the saber gun and the 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.730
 appearance of the lic 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:41.370
 also a magical penetration fee 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:44.850
 Sorcerer's boots have nothing 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:49.890
 more but that also depends a lot on 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:52.080
 how would you go an example will be a 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:55.200
 saber gun a sorcerer's boots a 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:58.470
 it was a curse of milk or a 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:01.710
 lizbeth a lock where discount overro 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:04.470
 deadly rada and a relais luis tasset 

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:07.470
 because the mouse powers us all the 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:09.450
 skin and that yields a lot with a cali and 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.880
 with everything you know general light king 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:16.010
 of acs and it gives you enough to accept the 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.010
 good combos those would be 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:23.060
 as seen in the table it is first uploaded 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:28.090
 the q altercation with the and finally the 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:28.090
 double obviously respecting in last 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:33.780
 good of the concepts of allison and 

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:38.280
 unions with which we go from one 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:41.970
 difficult line is good that if you do not see 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:45.870
 so much but just in case the lines that 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:48.030
 they are easy since you with trias would be 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:50.629
 with a line against war and a line 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.629
 against cactus 

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:56.770
 well first we can see here the 

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:58.660
 masters the most common for cali are 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:01.380
 the 21 9 and if they want then in the video 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:01.380
 To see them 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:07.950
 you play the runes the usual legal and 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:10.720
 they would be marks of penetration and life 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:13.180
 Seals of life by level of children of 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:16.200
 magic damage for fun by level and 15 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.200
 Magical damage scents 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:21.560
 the roaming tips that is 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:23.650
 critical to quality from 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:26.530
 level 6 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:27.770
 the running that is as you want other 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:30.379
 lines 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:33.440
 and is usually effective with this for 

00:04:30.379 --> 00:04:36.560
 example champions like din house but 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:39.110
 this character is very effective if 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:41.210
 you are zachary remember that always very 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:43.159
 important was the choice to be made and 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:46.280
 that thanks to the last one will be very 

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:48.889
 difficult and be careful with the pins or 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:50.840
 be the pink wards are going to do what 

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:53.870
 main thing the main thing that you are going to 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:55.879
 count use the w as a vision element 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:58.400
 in some cases always very helpful 

00:04:55.879 --> 00:05:00.800
 and the optimum is to get away from the tanks 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:03.229
 since here you have it and you have to have 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:05.090
 several keller over to be able to kill them 

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:07.920
 easy 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:09.700
 I hope you like this guide 

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:11.710
 good 

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:14.620
 for modern videos do not forget to 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:17.070
 subscribe them and subscribe follows auto and 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:17.070
 good said
