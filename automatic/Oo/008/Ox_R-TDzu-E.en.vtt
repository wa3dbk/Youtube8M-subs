00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
usually after you cook something it's

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.169 
usually after you cook something it's
too<00:02:07.930> hot<00:02:08.170> to<00:02:08.200> eat<00:02:08.500> immediately<00:02:08.769> right<00:02:09.429> anyway

too hot to eat immediately right anyway

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:12.630 
too hot to eat immediately right anyway
and<00:02:10.479> so<00:02:11.140> when<00:02:11.380> you<00:02:11.470> put<00:02:11.650> the<00:02:11.739> frozen<00:02:12.160> shrimp<00:02:12.489> in
