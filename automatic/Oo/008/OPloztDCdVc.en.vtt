00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:28.570 
nice they definitely format them better
in<00:02:27.410> this<00:02:27.530> edition<00:02:27.920> because<00:02:28.010> well<00:02:28.250> it's<00:02:28.370> bigger

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
in this edition because well it's bigger

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.490 
in this edition because well it's bigger
they<00:02:28.760> a<00:02:28.790> more<00:02:29.000> room<00:02:29.210> and<00:02:29.840> yet<00:02:30.170> looks<00:02:30.320> better

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
they a more room and yet looks better

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.230 
they a more room and yet looks better
but<00:02:30.950> yeah<00:02:31.160> you<00:02:31.220> have<00:02:31.580> all<00:02:31.730> the<00:02:31.850> interviews

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:32.240 
but yeah you have all the interviews

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.540 
but yeah you have all the interviews
back<00:02:32.450> here<00:02:32.810> in<00:02:33.320> the<00:02:33.470> single<00:02:33.740> line<00:02:33.950> so<00:02:34.130> you

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 
back here in the single line so you

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:36.970 
back here in the single line so you
don't<00:02:34.580> get<00:02:34.940> too<00:02:35.210> much<00:02:35.480> new<00:02:35.870> content<00:02:36.200> with<00:02:36.740> this

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
don't get too much new content with this

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.820 
don't get too much new content with this
but<00:02:37.880> it<00:02:38.240> still<00:02:38.540> is<00:02:38.720> the<00:02:38.750> best<00:02:39.110> addition<00:02:39.350> to<00:02:39.620> buy

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
but it still is the best addition to buy

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.010 
but it still is the best addition to buy
I<00:02:39.860> think<00:02:40.400> anyway<00:02:41.030> here's<00:02:41.330> the<00:02:41.390> visited<00:02:41.900> issue

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.020 
I think anyway here's the visited issue

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.980 
I think anyway here's the visited issue
actually<00:02:42.410> let's<00:02:43.130> just<00:02:43.190> compare<00:02:43.760> the<00:02:44.630> spine

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:44.990 
actually let's just compare the spine

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:48.550 
actually let's just compare the spine
with<00:02:45.940> with<00:02:46.940> these<00:02:47.150> single<00:02:47.390> volumes<00:02:47.930> as<00:02:48.380> you

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
with with these single volumes as you

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.610 
with with these single volumes as you
can<00:02:48.710> see<00:02:48.950> they<00:02:49.160> packed<00:02:49.750> pretty<00:02:50.750> much<00:02:50.959> three

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
can see they packed pretty much three

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.680 
can see they packed pretty much three
volumes<00:02:52.040> into<00:02:52.490> the<00:02:52.670> size<00:02:52.940> of<00:02:53.180> two<00:02:53.360> volumes

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
volumes into the size of two volumes

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.110 
volumes into the size of two volumes
which<00:02:54.290> is<00:02:54.470> really<00:02:54.770> cool<00:02:55.010> so<00:02:55.730> it's<00:02:55.880> not<00:02:55.970> gonna

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
which is really cool so it's not gonna

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.380 
which is really cool so it's not gonna
take<00:02:56.300> up<00:02:56.420> much<00:02:56.480> space<00:02:56.540> on<00:02:56.930> your<00:02:57.050> shelf<00:02:57.440> and

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
take up much space on your shelf and

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.970 
take up much space on your shelf and
wall<00:02:59.390> looks<00:02:59.630> awesome<00:03:00.050> that's<00:03:00.410> really<00:03:00.590> thin<00:03:00.830> is

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
wall looks awesome that's really thin is

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:02.770 
wall looks awesome that's really thin is
that<00:03:01.130> it's<00:03:01.459> just<00:03:01.640> really<00:03:01.730> cool<00:03:02.000> that<00:03:02.300> they<00:03:02.600> did

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
that it's just really cool that they did

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:05.320 
that it's just really cool that they did
that<00:03:03.370> and<00:03:04.370> it's<00:03:04.490> actually<00:03:04.760> thicker<00:03:05.030> than

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.330 
that and it's actually thicker than

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.710 
that and it's actually thicker than
Ava's<00:03:05.750> big<00:03:06.140> I<00:03:06.880> mean<00:03:07.910> thinner<00:03:08.120> has<00:03:08.330> any<00:03:08.480> of<00:03:08.600> this

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
Ava's big I mean thinner has any of this

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.949 
Ava's big I mean thinner has any of this
big<00:03:09.020> what<00:03:09.320> am<00:03:09.380> I<00:03:09.470> saying

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
big what am I saying

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:21.550 
big what am I saying
and<00:03:14.500> yeah<00:03:19.300> paper<00:03:20.300> quality<00:03:20.570> of<00:03:20.810> of<00:03:20.930> is<00:03:21.080> big<00:03:21.320> is

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
and yeah paper quality of of is big is

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.400 
and yeah paper quality of of is big is
thicker<00:03:21.920> it's<00:03:22.400> definitely<00:03:22.760> better<00:03:22.940> so<00:03:23.810> yeah

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
thicker it's definitely better so yeah

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:26.560 
thicker it's definitely better so yeah
it<00:03:24.769> doesn't<00:03:24.920> have<00:03:25.130> these<00:03:25.340> things<00:03:25.580> and<00:03:26.239> on<00:03:26.420> this

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:26.570 
it doesn't have these things and on this

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:29.320 
it doesn't have these things and on this
edition<00:03:26.860> the<00:03:27.860> biz<00:03:28.040> bigs<00:03:28.280> are<00:03:28.519> definitely<00:03:29.090> a

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:29.330 
edition the biz bigs are definitely a

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:33.580 
edition the biz bigs are definitely a
higher<00:03:30.260> production<00:03:30.709> quality<00:03:32.200> but<00:03:33.200> this<00:03:33.470> is

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
higher production quality but this is

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:37.870 
higher production quality but this is
still<00:03:33.830> a<00:03:35.530> pretty<00:03:36.530> good<00:03:36.890> on<00:03:37.160> the<00:03:37.310> bus<00:03:37.519> pretty

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:37.880

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:41.209 
didn't just go with a Visby because the

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:43.660 
didn't just go with a Visby because the
physics<00:03:41.600> are<00:03:41.840> very<00:03:42.650> great<00:03:42.950> on<00:03:43.130> the<00:03:43.250> buses<00:03:43.550> my

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:43.670 
physics are very great on the buses my

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:45.820 
physics are very great on the buses my
favorite<00:03:44.120> on<00:03:44.330> the<00:03:44.480> buses<00:03:44.810> that<00:03:45.290> any<00:03:45.410> company

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:45.830

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.260 
high quality but yeah they work with

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.160 
high quality but yeah they work with
this<00:03:51.440> which<00:03:51.920> is<00:03:51.950> kind<00:03:52.310> of<00:03:52.370> strange<00:03:52.519> but<00:03:53.170> it's

and the quality of the pages and the
quality<00:04:13.070> of<00:04:13.160> artwork<00:04:14.920> artwork<00:04:15.920> they<00:04:16.190> don't

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:16.340 
quality of artwork artwork they don't

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:25.920 
quality of artwork artwork they don't
look<00:04:16.459> as<00:04:16.729> clear<00:04:17.419> in<00:04:17.540> here<00:04:18.340> and<00:04:20.830> yeah

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:25.930 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:29.620 

they<00:04:26.930> took<00:04:27.140> the<00:04:27.410> cover<00:04:28.540> illustration<00:04:29.540> of

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:29.630 
they took the cover illustration of

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:33.730 
they took the cover illustration of
volume<00:04:29.960> 2<00:04:30.320> and<00:04:30.530> actually<00:04:31.100> to<00:04:31.790> use<00:04:31.910> for<00:04:32.740> the

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:33.740 
volume 2 and actually to use for the

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.130 
volume 2 and actually to use for the
representation<00:04:34.370> of<00:04:34.700> 1<00:04:35.000> through<00:04:35.240> 3<00:04:35.420> so<00:04:35.900> that's

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:36.140 
representation of 1 through 3 so that's

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:37.570 
representation of 1 through 3 so that's
pretty<00:04:36.320> interesting<00:04:36.410> they<00:04:37.010> can<00:04:37.160> just<00:04:37.310> go<00:04:37.430> with

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580 
pretty interesting they can just go with

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:39.070 
pretty interesting they can just go with
