00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:05.110
 hello happy new year this is going to be the 

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:08.170
 first video of the year and I'll bring you 

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:10.530
 a new series is that I want to do that 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:12.780
 it would be anti hole 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.789
 did not say of the stick this product did not 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.160
 I liked what I give back if not anti hall 

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:18.990
 stick this product now has a lot 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.470
 fame everyone loves what they are 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.750
 buying all youtubers and has 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:28.110
 very good looking but I will not buy it 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.790
 so it would be like a little bit helping us 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:32.040
 to contain them a bit because I do not know if 

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:33.989
 it happens to you but I'm a little 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.940
 peeled I can not be buying me 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.649
 everything that comes out because I'm in 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.200
 weapons I'm not broke but it would end 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.790
 in ruin then clear although there are 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.399
 a lot of things that are super good 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:47.149
 you have to be very selective because you are not 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.120
 to spend a lot of makeup 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:51.430
 so 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:54.100
 the first product that I'm going to talk about 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:57.070
 this anti hole would be the naked paddles 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:59.559
 from urban decay because I'm not going to 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:01.780
 I'll buy what I teach I 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:04.900
 gone accumulating more or less throughout 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:08.649
 the years in neutral tones these would be 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:12.390
 all mate and as you can see there are warm tones 

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:12.390
 and cold of neutral 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:20.460
 these are my bright and there are also 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.460
 cold and warm tones of neutrals 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.270
 this is the scene palette that you already 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.799
 I taught 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.719
 all these are the ones that are 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:30.670
 Brand new ones that are missing are placed 

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:33.490
 in the palette that you have shown before 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:36.130
 then in the hall of nix I bought a 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:39.070
 palette of these I think they come 12 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:41.110
 shadows and apart is that they are also 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:44.049
 neutral the 12 not found but 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:46.930
 in 12 well in shades 6 mate and 6 

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:49.330
 bright in cool and warm tones and 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:52.960
 this is warm tones all 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:55.600
 bright then I also have the 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:58.570
 natural of es lic to see 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:01.260
 who suffered an accident so you can 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:04.110
 see that I had to press them again 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:06.870
 but having children who do not care 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.150
 requires makeup to break and 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:11.820
 finally I show you is loose because 

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:15.600
 I love using it daily and you can see 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:18.360
 that is almost like new because you're 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.460
 immense shadows are 3 and a half grams and 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.860
 then he ensures that he uses it daily for 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:24.150
 fill in the eyebrows to then 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:28.020
 define the basin this is my color 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:29.640
 everyone's favorite then 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.800
 as you can see I have a collection is 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.860
 sufficiently large of neutrals like 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:37.440
 so I do not have to buy the pallets 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:40.290
 first maker the naked 1 are very shades 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.970
 golden that is fine but the golden 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.910
 It is not the color that I use the most 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:47.000
 annually that is the grayish brown 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:49.310
 Type satin top of mac 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.870
 or the one that has just been taught that is mate 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:54.220
 and it's a gray brown is this is my 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:57.110
 favorite color range then 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:03:00.260
 golden I have as you have seen I have a 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:02.510
 heap and the only ones that I do not have much 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.250
 but because I do not use them would be those of 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:08.240
 the range of the naked 3 that are brown 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:11.750
 pink then if we look and this says 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:14.480
 you know how much you use brown to see are 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:17.060
 there are some here that has been for years 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:20.930
 I have them and as you can see some yes 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:22.400
 that you notice the use but less is that 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:24.440
 it's pretty used and I've had it 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.080
 to replace once because the fit 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:29.120
 the others are not used as much as the 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:31.690
 vanilla if I give it a use that you do not see 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.820
 but the rest 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:35.710
 then we need so many browns 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:38.140
 Well , the truth is I have plenty of 

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:39.880
 done I have too many this palette but 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:41.580
 because it was a bargain if it should not 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:44.190
 have bought it because I already have everything 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:46.890
 so 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:48.030
 naked for whom for those who 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:51.180
 are you starting your collection 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:52.980
 you want or you have a reduced collection 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:55.110
 and you want to expand it with a group of 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:57.030
 shadows of good quality because yes that 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:58.380
 tester of the urban dj I have the one of 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:02.420
 anniversary that these are colors 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:02.420
 varied and here there are neutral 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:09.319
 and if the quality is very good less and 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:11.900
 I think it's this that is super glitter 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:14.829
 and it falls that it's a horror but so 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:14.829
 others are great 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:21.350
 and if the pallets are highly recommended 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:24.020
 naked but only for someone good only 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:26.000
 or if you can allow it to be perfect 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:27.800
 here I do not enter there or you can 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.800
 spend 500 euros a month on makeup 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:33.740
 Chapo is perfect for you but 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:35.389
 this is more for those who are stripped 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:37.690
 if you already have a good collection of 

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:41.150
 brown is not essential the naked 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:44.090
 If you have a very small collection or 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:45.560
 of shadows type s is kiko that yes they are 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:47.389
 ok but the quality is different 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:49.699
 so if I would tell you then look 

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:51.830
 Christmas and ask you the naked because 

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:54.349
 It's worth it, I would recommend you more 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:57.139
 naked 2 because it's more neutral has 

00:04:54.349 --> 00:04:59.840
 golden and has cold color the law that you 

00:04:57.139 --> 00:05:01.699
 it's not golden and the and the naked 3 here in 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:03.740
 I do not see Spain very much because it's for 

00:05:01.699 --> 00:05:06.110
 it has more pinkish white skin and 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:09.020
 we do not all but most of the 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:11.090
 Spanish we are more pulling yellow 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:13.550
 so 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:16.010
 this would be my anti hole I will not buy 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:18.500
 none naked none none none 

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:21.169
 because I'm going more than served toned 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:23.690
 browns always leave a thousand walls in 

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:26.030
 brown tones and there are other more complete 

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:27.620
 that have more matte tones or more 

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:30.979
 matt and shiny tones the naked 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:33.949
 tend to be very bright if you already 

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:37.130
 I tell you it 's very well worth it but 

00:05:33.949 --> 00:05:39.470
 only when you do not have problems of 

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:42.320
 money and you can spend whatever you want 

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:44.600
 or you have a very low evaluation and 

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:47.530
 you want to expand a little bit so far 

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:47.530
 the first anti hall
