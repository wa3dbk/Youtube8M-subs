00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
trailer I said that I've always felt

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.119 
trailer I said that I've always felt
that<00:00:51.449> while<00:00:51.629> Batman<00:00:51.899> was<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.410> true<00:00:52.620> identity

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
that while Batman was the true identity

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.400 
that while Batman was the true identity
in<00:00:53.219> Bruce<00:00:53.430> Wayne<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.850> mask<00:00:54.090> Superman<00:00:55.050> was<00:00:55.260> the

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
in Bruce Wayne the mask Superman was the

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.290 
in Bruce Wayne the mask Superman was the
opposite<00:00:55.949> Clark<00:00:56.579> Kent<00:00:56.879> was<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.120> true

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
opposite Clark Kent was the true

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.689 
opposite Clark Kent was the true
identity<00:00:57.750> while<00:00:57.870> Superman<00:00:58.350> was<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.770> mask<00:00:59.010> and

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
identity while Superman was the mask and

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.430 
identity while Superman was the mask and
that<00:00:59.850> apparently<00:01:00.329> annoyed<00:01:00.660> a<00:01:00.899> lot<00:01:01.140> of<00:01:01.289> you

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
while I have to say the opposite theory

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.530

annoys me so let's discuss first let's
go<00:01:06.689> at<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:06.840> theory<00:01:07.200> that's<00:01:07.380> apparently<00:01:07.770> being

instead of contrast because in the end I

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:57.800

think we can all agree that the best

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:59.539 
think we can all agree that the best
thing<00:03:57.989> for<00:03:58.019> the<00:03:58.230> character<00:03:58.650> would<00:03:59.160> be<00:03:59.280> to<00:03:59.370> pick

00:03:59.539 --> 00:03:59.549 
thing for the character would be to pick

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:01.789 
thing for the character would be to pick
a<00:03:59.579> single<00:03:59.910> theory<00:04:00.420> and<00:04:00.600> stick<00:04:00.840> with<00:04:00.959> it<00:04:01.019> even

00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:01.799 
a single theory and stick with it even

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:04.849 
a single theory and stick with it even
