00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 head sports come i have one here 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.670
 top practice for home maybe 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:07.470
 even the best that exists and how they are 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.540
 These failure steps with the short ones 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.790
 not only a top exercise for your legs 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:15.620
 but offered the perfect exercise for the 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.620
 Butt is showing you right now 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:23.670
 if we have to train at home yes 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.199
 not especially for equipment da2 short 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.599
 but now almost everyone else has 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.039
 I think yes my videos look and 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.359
 we have the advantage if it is short 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.189
 that we also have a little bit here 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.890
 weight can tackle and so one 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.600
 ideal legs exercises for at home 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:38.340
 and that would be the first 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.079
 failure steps and I have three times 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.980
 Variations of brought along we start 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.410
 with the first 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.420
 we are just about to do this here 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.280
 easy failure steps or kate go 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.300
 nice down with upper body has 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:55.350
 Right now we're going to switch back page 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:58.199
 go down here and go back shows 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:01.230
 summer failure step go straight red 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.370
 upper body and more back when we 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:07.500
 now above all understands 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:09.869
 namely air and absolute exception 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.580
 go up in this mild flu 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.850
 slight failure step at the 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:17.549
 variation has a goal especially the 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.229
 burden here in the thigh 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.570
 front who is a very very 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.920
 Beautiful thigh exercises in the fall 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.930
 and of course we can also come here 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.009
 weight play more weight on it 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.049
 we make the whole thing more difficult 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.329
 Of course, here is one out of or 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.590
 yes balance history we have to 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.600
 that balance we have here 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.520
 not so shaky are therefore first 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.920
 best start with less weight 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.020
 with three times twelve repetitions about 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.390
 if we do a little bit more the 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.310
 Laying stress on the butt 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.470
 buttocks run we also 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.939
 actually the perfect exercise for women 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.829
 for example, hey how can I say 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.479
 crisp in my butt at home 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.720
 trained and we can ideally with 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.619
 the two dumbbells by the 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.630
 failure step variations bit 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.490
 we are changing something and we are doing something 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.850
 more kretschmann sees it all 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.799
 Out is for the balance 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.689
 a difficult we make beautiful forest 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:10.190
 selection step now go straight 

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:13.310
 down and back and now have 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:19.280
 we have a much higher blood eos so 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:21.940
 in the popo went down and now we have 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:25.130
 grab here we show the front here 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:26.270
 fast on the other side if you can 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.670
 We cry 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:31.880
 go down here is the tension 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:33.739
 load ots slightly higher that means we 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.850
 had the first time briefly perhaps the 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:40.060
 Failure mild flu is normal 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:42.650
 life the failure step down straight 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:45.290
 more the thighs front and 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.060
 Now we have the wide house here 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:50.090
 especially hidden for the women 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:52.610
 interesting nice down more stretching in 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:55.310
 blood eos in the buttocks so the perfect 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:56.989
 butt exercise for the women that were 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:00.010
 the two variations once the latte 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:04.010
 and once the wide failure slide 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:05.810
 first thigh front then 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.820
 buttocks more strained if we still 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.959
 we want to be able to intensify the 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:11.900
 extend away as we unite us 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:16.220
 studies or known behind or one 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:18.609
 small box to put the back foot 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.810
 want here have to go up to the front 

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:22.310
 and the way right with it 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:26.329
 and now we can go much further 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:31.790
 go down the screen and again 

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:35.090
 high here we can load 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:37.870
 Of course, with such a chair of course 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:39.470
 still change and harden 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:42.130
 difficulty levels a bit higher 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:45.049
 even the balance becomes more difficult 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:45.620
 kides down here and can do it 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:47.859
 change 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:50.810
 we just have three variations 

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:52.370
 can we do at home with 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:55.010
 just two short others very very 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:58.190
 warm ecm july no air conditioning one 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:00.019
 beautiful but as you said if you yours 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:02.030
 butt drive the legs super 

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:02.530
 want to train at home then tried 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:04.180
 this one 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:05.950
 simply the action from variation of a 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:08.650
 slight thighs 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:11.080
 front side variation two second 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:13.840
 straddles for a claim almost 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:16.570
 sure law separated and thus one 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:18.489
 chair or a small box we have 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:19.870
 the burden would be even higher at the beginning 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:21.609
 less weight at three times twelve 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:23.440
 Repetitions with balance and 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:25.710
 balance makes it all the time 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:28.630
 I would be glad if you want 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:30.970
