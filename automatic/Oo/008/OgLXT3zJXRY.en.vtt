00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
personalize option and we've covered the

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.450 
personalize option and we've covered the
first<00:00:19.560> three<00:00:20.130> settings<00:00:21.000> the<00:00:21.359> window<00:00:21.750> colored

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:22.460 
first three settings the window colored

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.750 
first three settings the window colored
desktop<00:00:23.460> background<00:00:23.939> and<00:00:24.240> screen<00:00:25.170> saver

desktop background and screen saver

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.009 
desktop background and screen saver
we're<00:00:26.760> going<00:00:26.910> to<00:00:26.970> look<00:00:27.060> at<00:00:27.180> sounds<00:00:27.750> in<00:00:27.930> a

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
we're going to look at sounds in a

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:28.700 
we're going to look at sounds in a
little<00:00:28.320> bit

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
little bit

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.349 
little bit
first<00:00:29.519> of<00:00:29.670> all<00:00:29.730> we're<00:00:29.849> going<00:00:29.939> to<00:00:30.000> look<00:00:30.060> at

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
first of all we're going to look at

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.860 
first of all we're going to look at
Mouse<00:00:30.810> pointers<00:00:31.669> so<00:00:32.669> if<00:00:32.910> you<00:00:33.000> select<00:00:33.180> Mouse

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
Mouse pointers so if you select Mouse

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.040 
Mouse pointers so if you select Mouse
pointers<00:00:34.969> I'll<00:00:35.969> open<00:00:36.210> up<00:00:36.300> a<00:00:36.420> dialogue<00:00:36.840> and

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
pointers I'll open up a dialogue and

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.380 
pointers I'll open up a dialogue and
this<00:00:37.680> allows<00:00:37.980> us<00:00:38.160> to<00:00:38.250> configure<00:00:38.430> settings<00:00:38.850> for

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
this allows us to configure settings for

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.319 
this allows us to configure settings for
the<00:00:40.110> look<00:00:40.320> of<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.590> mouse<00:00:40.739> pointer<00:00:41.309> and<00:00:41.700> also

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
the look of the mouse pointer and also

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.350 
the look of the mouse pointer and also
how<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.570> mouse<00:00:42.899> behaves<00:00:43.550> in<00:00:44.550> this<00:00:45.030> particular

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
how the mouse behaves in this particular

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.529 
how the mouse behaves in this particular
case<00:00:45.780> you'll<00:00:46.710> notice<00:00:47.100> that<00:00:47.399> I<00:00:47.640> actually<00:00:48.059> have

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
case you'll notice that I actually have

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.680 
case you'll notice that I actually have
a<00:00:48.780> slightly<00:00:49.230> different<00:00:49.820> dialogue<00:00:50.820> compared

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
a slightly different dialogue compared

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.170 
a slightly different dialogue compared
to<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:51.960> standard<00:00:52.199> dialogue<00:00:52.890> and<00:00:53.190> this<00:00:54.030> is

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
to the standard dialogue and this is

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.650 
to the standard dialogue and this is
because<00:00:54.510> I<00:00:54.840> have<00:00:55.140> a<00:00:55.520> touchpad<00:00:56.520> on<00:00:56.969> my<00:00:57.420> laptop

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
because I have a touchpad on my laptop

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.060 
because I have a touchpad on my laptop
so<00:00:58.109> my<00:00:58.980> actual<00:00:59.129> touchpad<00:00:59.989> drivers<00:01:01.070> install

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
so my actual touchpad drivers install

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.219 
so my actual touchpad drivers install
certain<00:01:02.820> settings<00:01:03.359> that<00:01:03.570> I<00:01:03.629> can<00:01:03.870> configure

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
certain settings that I can configure

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.429 
certain settings that I can configure
from<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:04.920> mouse<00:01:05.070> properties<00:01:06.080> and<00:01:07.080> you<00:01:07.320> can

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
from the mouse properties and you can

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.920 
from the mouse properties and you can
see<00:01:07.650> here<00:01:07.920> that<00:01:07.950> we<00:01:08.189> have<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:09.030> devices<00:01:09.420> drop

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
see here that we have the devices drop

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.830 
see here that we have the devices drop
down<00:01:10.820> this<00:01:11.820> is<00:01:12.000> all<00:01:12.150> within<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:12.540> buttons<00:01:12.869> tab

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
down this is all within the buttons tab

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.789 
down this is all within the buttons tab
and<00:01:15.840> we<00:01:16.049> have<00:01:17.000> right-handed<00:01:18.000> left-handed

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:18.799 
and we have right-handed left-handed

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:22.580 
and we have right-handed left-handed
configuration<00:01:20.659> we<00:01:21.659> also<00:01:21.869> have<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.380> double

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
configuration we also have the double

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.310 
configuration we also have the double
click<00:01:22.950> speed<00:01:23.250> so<00:01:23.430> I<00:01:23.460> can<00:01:23.670> slow<00:01:23.970> that<00:01:24.210> or<00:01:24.570> speed

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
click speed so I can slow that or speed

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:31.100 
click speed so I can slow that or speed
that<00:01:26.420> and<00:01:27.439> the<00:01:28.439> click<00:01:28.650> lock

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.770 

on<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.100> next<00:01:32.280> tab<00:01:32.490> we<00:01:33.120> have<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:33.270> pointers

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
on the next tab we have the pointers

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.260 
on the next tab we have the pointers
option<00:01:34.650> and<00:01:35.580> we<00:01:35.670> have<00:01:35.790> various<00:01:36.240> different

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
option and we have various different

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.610 
option and we have various different
schemes<00:01:37.230> for<00:01:38.220> different<00:01:38.700> styles<00:01:38.910> of<00:01:39.120> pointers

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:39.620 
schemes for different styles of pointers

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:41.840 
schemes for different styles of pointers
at<00:01:40.620> the<00:01:40.710> moment<00:01:41.070> this<00:01:41.160> is<00:01:41.310> on<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:41.490> default

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
at the moment this is on the default

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.540 
at the moment this is on the default
windows<00:01:42.330> Aero<00:01:42.980> you<00:01:43.980> may<00:01:44.100> use<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.340> drop<00:01:44.520> down

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:44.550 
windows Aero you may use the drop down

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:47.480 
windows Aero you may use the drop down
menu<00:01:45.060> you<00:01:45.240> can<00:01:46.230> see<00:01:46.410> we<00:01:46.530> have<00:01:46.620> a<00:01:46.650> whole<00:01:46.860> raft<00:01:47.130> of

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
menu you can see we have a whole raft of

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.980 
menu you can see we have a whole raft of
different<00:01:47.720> schemes<00:01:48.720> that<00:01:49.020> we<00:01:49.110> can<00:01:49.260> use<00:01:50.990> so

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
different schemes that we can use so

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.760 
different schemes that we can use so
let's<00:01:52.260> try<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:52.620> dinosaur<00:01:53.460> one<00:01:54.410> you<00:01:55.410> can<00:01:55.560> see

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
let's try the dinosaur one you can see

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.840 
let's try the dinosaur one you can see
there<00:01:56.040> the<00:01:56.910> pointer<00:01:57.360> changes<00:01:57.390> to<00:01:58.260> a<00:01:58.850> yellow

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
there the pointer changes to a yellow

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.310 
there the pointer changes to a yellow
gold<00:02:00.690> colored<00:02:01.620> type<00:02:02.190> pointer<00:02:03.110> and<00:02:04.110> if<00:02:04.229> we

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
gold colored type pointer and if we

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.570 
gold colored type pointer and if we
scroll<00:02:04.560> down<00:02:04.620> you<00:02:04.860> see<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:05.100> different<00:02:05.490> ones

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:05.580 
scroll down you see the different ones

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.139 
scroll down you see the different ones
which<00:02:06.540> are<00:02:06.690> going<00:02:06.720> to<00:02:06.900> be<00:02:07.080> used<00:02:07.670> if<00:02:08.670> we<00:02:08.729> select

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
which are going to be used if we select

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.640 
which are going to be used if we select
this<00:02:09.240> scheme<00:02:11.900> let's<00:02:12.900> have<00:02:13.080> a<00:02:13.110> look<00:02:13.320> at<00:02:13.440> another

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
this scheme let's have a look at another

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.210 
this scheme let's have a look at another
scheme<00:02:13.980> let's<00:02:14.910> go<00:02:15.120> to<00:02:15.180> the<00:02:15.420> old<00:02:15.660> fashioned

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
scheme let's go to the old fashioned

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.730 
scheme let's go to the old fashioned
scheme<00:02:17.300> and<00:02:18.300> you<00:02:19.050> can<00:02:19.170> see<00:02:19.320> there<00:02:19.530> that<00:02:19.680> we

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
scheme and you can see there that we

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:24.740 
scheme and you can see there that we
have<00:02:19.830> an<00:02:19.920> old-fashioned<00:02:20.840> hand<00:02:23.600> if<00:02:24.600> we

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
have an old-fashioned hand if we

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.330 
have an old-fashioned hand if we
actually<00:02:25.020> want<00:02:25.200> to<00:02:25.230> test<00:02:25.500> this<00:02:25.620> out<00:02:25.830> we<00:02:25.890> can<00:02:26.220> go

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
actually want to test this out we can go

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.420 
actually want to test this out we can go
to<00:02:26.400> the<00:02:26.550> apply<00:02:26.820> button<00:02:28.040> and<00:02:29.040> if<00:02:29.160> we<00:02:29.280> select

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
to the apply button and if we select

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
actually turned into a different mouse

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.479 
actually turned into a different mouse
pointer<00:02:34.380> and<00:02:36.200> if<00:02:37.200> I<00:02:37.350> do<00:02:37.860> any<00:02:38.010> the<00:02:38.130> actions

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.560 

we<00:02:54.590> have<00:02:54.740> the<00:02:54.860> option<00:02:54.980> here<00:02:55.340> at<00:02:55.430> the<00:02:55.490> bottom<00:02:55.820> to
