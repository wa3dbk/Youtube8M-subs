00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.660 
arrived
nine<00:02:04.940> hours<00:02:05.270> early<00:02:05.930> so<00:02:06.110> I<00:02:06.920> wasn't<00:02:07.220> ready<00:02:07.520> at

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
nine hours early so I wasn't ready at

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.749 
nine hours early so I wasn't ready at
all<00:02:07.820> I<00:02:08.509> pulled<00:02:08.990> my<00:02:09.080> tractor<00:02:09.470> outside<00:02:09.860> real

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
all I pulled my tractor outside real

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:12.730 
all I pulled my tractor outside real
quick<00:02:10.789> and<00:02:11.270> he<00:02:11.810> set<00:02:11.990> all<00:02:12.110> the<00:02:12.200> pellets<00:02:12.350> down

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
quick and he set all the pellets down

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:16.090 
quick and he set all the pellets down
and<00:02:13.010> then<00:02:13.459> pushed<00:02:13.940> a<00:02:14.530> pellet<00:02:15.530> pushed<00:02:15.860> this

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100 
and then pushed a pellet pushed this

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.060 
and then pushed a pellet pushed this
pellet<00:02:16.820> back<00:02:17.300> basically<00:02:17.870> so<00:02:18.500> I<00:02:18.530> have<00:02:18.739> four

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.070 
pellet back basically so I have four

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:23.620 
pellet back basically so I have four
pallets<00:02:19.790> four<00:02:20.330> tonnes<00:02:20.660> of<00:02:21.070> pellets<00:02:22.390> ready<00:02:23.390> for

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
pallets four tonnes of pellets ready for

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:26.650 
pallets four tonnes of pellets ready for
consumption<00:02:24.110> and<00:02:24.610> completely<00:02:25.610> in<00:02:25.850> the<00:02:25.970> way<00:02:26.120> of

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
consumption and completely in the way of

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.979 
consumption and completely in the way of
this<00:02:26.870> door<00:02:27.110> so<00:02:28.150> although<00:02:29.150> it<00:02:29.510> would<00:02:29.660> be<00:02:29.690> nice

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:29.989 
this door so although it would be nice

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:33.580 
this door so although it would be nice
to<00:02:30.350> just<00:02:31.070> leave<00:02:31.459> them<00:02:31.760> on<00:02:31.850> the<00:02:32.000> pallets<00:02:32.590> and

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
to just leave them on the pallets and

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.660 
to just leave them on the pallets and
take<00:02:34.250> a<00:02:34.280> bag<00:02:34.520> off<00:02:34.790> put<00:02:35.690> it<00:02:35.780> in<00:02:35.900> the<00:02:35.989> boiler<00:02:36.350> I

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
take a bag off put it in the boiler I

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.130 
take a bag off put it in the boiler I
just<00:02:37.670> don't<00:02:37.880> want<00:02:38.030> it<00:02:38.120> in<00:02:38.270> the<00:02:38.360> way<00:02:38.510> so<00:02:38.930> I'm

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
just don't want it in the way so I'm

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:40.330 
just don't want it in the way so I'm
probably<00:02:39.260> going<00:02:39.530> to<00:02:39.590> move<00:02:39.800> each<00:02:40.040> bag

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
probably going to move each bag

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.780 
probably going to move each bag
individually<00:02:41.150> to<00:02:41.900> some<00:02:42.200> other<00:02:42.350> location<00:02:42.790> I'm

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
individually to some other location I'm

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:45.640 
individually to some other location I'm
thinking<00:02:44.209> in<00:02:44.360> here<00:02:44.600> for<00:02:44.840> now<00:02:44.959> so<00:02:45.230> this<00:02:45.350> is<00:02:45.410> my

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
thinking in here for now so this is my

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.800 
thinking in here for now so this is my
water<00:02:45.920> storage<00:02:46.370> tank<00:02:46.700> I<00:02:46.970> think<00:02:47.390> I'm<00:02:47.690> just

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
water storage tank I think I'm just

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.960 
water storage tank I think I'm just
going<00:02:48.020> to<00:02:48.110> kind<00:02:48.320> of<00:02:48.380> stack<00:02:49.130> them<00:02:49.340> in<00:02:49.430> here<00:02:49.489> all

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
going to kind of stack them in here all

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:51.940 
going to kind of stack them in here all
the<00:02:50.000> way<00:02:50.239> up<00:02:50.269> to<00:02:50.510> the<00:02:50.630> ceiling<00:02:50.810> and<00:02:51.200> then

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
the way up to the ceiling and then

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.990 
the way up to the ceiling and then
probably<00:02:52.400> go<00:02:52.489> back<00:02:52.820> there<00:02:53.440> can't<00:02:54.440> really<00:02:55.000> show

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
probably go back there can't really show

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.949 
probably go back there can't really show
you<00:02:56.060> very<00:02:56.360> well<00:02:56.540> probably<00:02:56.900> go<00:02:57.290> back<00:02:57.470> here<00:02:58.040> and

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
you very well probably go back here and

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:03.550 
you very well probably go back here and
stack<00:02:59.959> them<00:03:00.110> over<00:03:00.350> there<00:03:00.470> somewhere<00:03:01.900> so<00:03:02.900> so<00:03:03.500> I

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
stack them over there somewhere so so I

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.190 
stack them over there somewhere so so I
can<00:03:03.709> get<00:03:03.799> my<00:03:03.920> tractor<00:03:04.250> back<00:03:04.340> inside<00:03:04.760> but<00:03:05.720> yeah

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
can get my tractor back inside but yeah

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.150 
can get my tractor back inside but yeah
so<00:03:07.660> four<00:03:08.660> tons<00:03:08.989> ready<00:03:09.410> I<00:03:09.650> think<00:03:09.680> I'm<00:03:09.950> going<00:03:10.070> to

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 
so four tons ready I think I'm going to

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.509 
so four tons ready I think I'm going to
use<00:03:10.250> more<00:03:10.489> than<00:03:10.549> this<00:03:10.850> this<00:03:11.269> year<00:03:12.519> interesting

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:13.519 
use more than this this year interesting

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:17.110 
use more than this this year interesting
fact<00:03:13.820> one<00:03:14.540> tonne<00:03:14.930> of<00:03:14.959> pellets<00:03:15.739> is<00:03:16.010> equal<00:03:16.880> to<00:03:17.090> a

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
fact one tonne of pellets is equal to a

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.280 
fact one tonne of pellets is equal to a
cord<00:03:17.780> and<00:03:18.080> a<00:03:18.140> half<00:03:18.410> of<00:03:18.709> wood<00:03:19.209> so<00:03:20.209> if<00:03:20.870> you<00:03:21.110> think

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
cord and a half of wood so if you think

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.740 
cord and a half of wood so if you think
about<00:03:21.410> the<00:03:21.709> cost<00:03:21.950> difference<00:03:22.459> a<00:03:22.790> cord<00:03:23.570> of<00:03:23.720> wood

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
about the cost difference a cord of wood

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:25.509 
about the cost difference a cord of wood
around<00:03:24.140> here<00:03:24.650> depending<00:03:25.100> on<00:03:25.220> the<00:03:25.310> time<00:03:25.489> of

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:25.519 
around here depending on the time of

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:28.210 
around here depending on the time of
year<00:03:25.880> and<00:03:26.150> season<00:03:26.450> or<00:03:26.870> whatnot<00:03:27.019> is<00:03:27.380> about<00:03:27.620> 200

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
year and season or whatnot is about 200

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:32.740 
year and season or whatnot is about 200
225<00:03:30.130> for<00:03:31.130> a<00:03:31.160> quart<00:03:31.400> of<00:03:31.489> wood<00:03:31.670> and<00:03:31.970> I<00:03:32.120> got<00:03:32.360> a<00:03:32.390> cord

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750 
225 for a quart of wood and I got a cord

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:37.270 
225 for a quart of wood and I got a cord
1/2<00:03:33.079> quart<00:03:33.380> and<00:03:33.560> a<00:03:33.620> half<00:03:33.650> of<00:03:34.010> wood<00:03:35.000> for<00:03:36.280> 195

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280 
1/2 quart and a half of wood for 195

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.789 
1/2 quart and a half of wood for 195
basically<00:03:37.910> so<00:03:38.120> it<00:03:38.239> is<00:03:38.420> actually<00:03:38.810> cheaper<00:03:39.620> than

00:03:39.789 --> 00:03:39.799 
basically so it is actually cheaper than

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:42.490 
basically so it is actually cheaper than
cord<00:03:40.070> wood<00:03:40.280> you<00:03:41.030> don't<00:03:41.239> have<00:03:41.420> to<00:03:41.570> stack<00:03:41.870> it<00:03:42.140> you

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 
cord wood you don't have to stack it you

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.259 
cord wood you don't have to stack it you
don't<00:03:42.680> have<00:03:42.860> to<00:03:43.010> dry<00:03:43.340> it<00:03:43.400> you<00:03:43.850> don't<00:03:44.150> have<00:03:44.180> to

00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:44.269 
don't have to dry it you don't have to

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:46.690 
don't have to dry it you don't have to
season<00:03:44.600> it<00:03:44.840> split<00:03:45.410> it<00:03:45.620> any<00:03:45.799> of<00:03:46.220> that<00:03:46.340> stuff<00:03:46.489> of

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:46.700 
season it split it any of that stuff of

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.250 
season it split it any of that stuff of
course<00:03:46.880> if<00:03:47.030> you<00:03:47.180> if<00:03:47.450> you're<00:03:47.600> splitting<00:03:47.870> it<00:03:48.140> and

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.260 
course if you if you're splitting it and

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.229 
course if you if you're splitting it and
cutting<00:03:48.530> it<00:03:48.590> and<00:03:48.620> stacking<00:03:48.920> it<00:03:49.190> then<00:03:49.340> it's

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:50.239 
cutting it and stacking it then it's

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:52.930 
cutting it and stacking it then it's
essentially<00:03:51.140> free<00:03:51.680> except<00:03:52.130> for<00:03:52.340> all<00:03:52.700> your
