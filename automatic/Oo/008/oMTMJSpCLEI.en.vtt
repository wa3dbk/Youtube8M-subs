00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:32.619 
project right now it's pretty hard to

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:36.840 
project right now it's pretty hard to
estimate<00:01:33.780> how<00:01:34.780> much<00:01:34.960> the<00:01:35.259> loss<00:01:35.649> is<00:01:35.979> now<00:01:36.640> we're

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:36.850 
estimate how much the loss is now we're

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.260 
estimate how much the loss is now we're
expecting<00:01:37.270> 24<00:01:37.720> to<00:01:37.840> 48<00:01:38.140> our<00:01:38.380> closure<00:01:39.030> may<00:01:40.030> even

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
expecting 24 to 48 our closure may even

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.539 
expecting 24 to 48 our closure may even
be<00:01:40.390> longer<00:01:40.540> than<00:01:40.810> that<00:01:40.869> it<00:01:41.170> depends<00:01:41.500> on<00:01:41.619> how

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:42.549 
be longer than that it depends on how

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:44.249 
be longer than that it depends on how
badly<00:01:42.880> the<00:01:43.210> freeway<00:01:43.539> has<00:01:43.600> been<00:01:43.810> damaged
