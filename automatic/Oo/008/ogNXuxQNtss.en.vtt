spot a shamrock greenhouse window box by
its<00:00:12.240> lushness<00:00:12.929> I<00:00:13.259> trimmed<00:00:13.980> the<00:00:14.099> plant<00:00:14.309> back

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
its lushness I trimmed the plant back

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.460 
its lushness I trimmed the plant back
several<00:00:14.910> times<00:00:15.179> when<00:00:15.780> it's<00:00:15.900> in<00:00:16.020> the<00:00:16.109> box<00:00:16.320> in

several times when it's in the box in

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:17.990 
several times when it's in the box in
the<00:00:16.529> greenhouse<00:00:16.859> and<00:00:17.190> it<00:00:17.369> creates<00:00:17.670> a<00:00:17.820> very

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
the greenhouse and it creates a very

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.720 
the greenhouse and it creates a very
thick<00:00:18.359> lush<00:00:18.720> growth<00:00:19.080> and<00:00:19.380> it<00:00:19.859> makes<00:00:20.520> all<00:00:20.699> the

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
plants in to mingle and so it's not this

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
the amount of water going in but it's

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.240 
the amount of water going in but it's
difficult<00:00:39.989> to<00:00:40.350> control<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:40.770> amount<00:00:41.040> of<00:00:41.100> water

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250

difficult to control the amount of water
going<00:00:41.520> out<00:00:41.760> if<00:00:42.059> there's<00:00:42.540> no<00:00:42.660> holes<00:00:42.930> in<00:00:43.230> this

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
going out if there's no holes in this

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.709 
going out if there's no holes in this
particular<00:00:43.829> case<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.489> customer<00:00:44.910> has<00:00:45.300> a<00:00:45.329> sunny

particular case the customer has a sunny
location<00:00:45.930> and<00:00:46.500> so<00:00:47.160> we're<00:00:47.370> going<00:00:47.520> to<00:00:47.579> put

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
location and so we're going to put

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.819 
location and so we're going to put
plants<00:00:48.180> that<00:00:48.360> do<00:00:48.539> well<00:00:48.809> in<00:00:48.840> sunny<00:00:49.230> locations

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829

gonna put plants that are very easy to

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.099 
gonna put plants that are very easy to
grow<00:00:56.430> but<00:00:56.670> they<00:00:57.149> grow<00:00:57.360> big<00:00:57.600> so<00:00:57.870> you<00:00:57.930> have

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
about the maximum in this case I'm

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.179 
about the maximum in this case I'm
probably<00:01:17.340> gonna<00:01:17.549> pick<00:01:17.790> out<00:01:17.970> a<00:01:18.000> a<00:01:18.740> purple<00:01:19.740> and

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
probably gonna pick out a a purple and

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.109 
probably gonna pick out a a purple and
we'll<00:01:20.549> put<00:01:20.790> three<00:01:21.150> in<00:01:21.180> with<00:01:21.900> those<00:01:22.049> forgeries

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:23.119 
we'll put three in with those forgeries

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:26.120 
we'll put three in with those forgeries
here's<00:01:24.119> a<00:01:24.240> Pink's<00:01:25.140> two<00:01:25.439> two<00:01:25.710> different<00:01:25.979> types

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
here's a Pink's two two different types

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.620 
here's a Pink's two two different types
of<00:01:26.250> plants<00:01:26.520> we<00:01:26.610> have<00:01:26.640> a<00:01:26.729> calibrachoa<00:01:27.119> and<00:01:27.540> then

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
of plants we have a calibrachoa and then

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.719 
of plants we have a calibrachoa and then
we<00:01:27.720> have<00:01:27.840> another<00:01:27.990> petunia<00:01:28.619> and<00:01:29.100> I<00:01:29.369> think<00:01:29.610> that

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
we have another petunia and I think that

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.940 
we have another petunia and I think that
works<00:01:29.939> real<00:01:30.150> well<00:01:30.180> with<00:01:30.540> these<00:01:30.720> two<00:01:31.530> cause<00:01:31.740> we

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
works real well with these two cause we

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.710 
works real well with these two cause we
already<00:01:32.070> have<00:01:32.310> here<00:01:32.520> there<00:01:33.299> is<00:01:33.420> a<00:01:33.450> little

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
already have here there is a little

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.539 
already have here there is a little
variation<00:01:34.439> in<00:01:34.500> this<00:01:34.650> pink<00:01:34.890> but<00:01:35.100> because<00:01:35.369> this

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
variation in this pink but because this

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:36.800 
variation in this pink but because this
calibrachoa<00:01:36.000> is<00:01:36.270> gonna<00:01:36.420> go<00:01:36.570> in<00:01:36.689> the<00:01:36.780> middle

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
calibrachoa is gonna go in the middle

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.140 
calibrachoa is gonna go in the middle
and<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.920> two<00:01:38.070> petunias<00:01:38.549> are<00:01:38.640> gonna<00:01:38.729> go<00:01:38.939> on<00:01:39.060> the

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
and the two petunias are gonna go on the

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.749 
and the two petunias are gonna go on the
ends<00:01:39.450> I<00:01:39.659> think<00:01:40.650> they<00:01:40.860> all<00:01:40.979> work<00:01:41.130> together<00:01:41.250> this

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
ends I think they all work together this

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.580 
ends I think they all work together this
caliper<00:01:42.540> coat<00:01:42.750> is<00:01:42.869> going<00:01:42.899> to<00:01:43.049> grow<00:01:43.170> about<00:01:43.259> yay

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
caliper coat is going to grow about yay

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.649 
caliper coat is going to grow about yay

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
high and all this stuff is gonna cover

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.039 
high and all this stuff is gonna cover
the<00:01:47.939> whole<00:01:47.970> front<00:01:48.299> of<00:01:48.329> the<00:01:48.420> box<00:01:48.600> you're<00:01:48.750> never

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
the whole front of the box you're never

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.840 
the whole front of the box you're never
gonna<00:01:49.200> see<00:01:49.470> this<00:01:49.649> box<00:01:49.890> in<00:01:50.100> about<00:01:50.310> two<00:01:50.490> months

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
gonna see this box in about two months

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.760 
gonna see this box in about two months
actually<00:01:51.420> in<00:01:51.810> one<00:01:52.049> month<00:01:52.229> when<00:01:52.380> you<00:01:52.409> pick<00:01:52.649> this

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
actually in one month when you pick this

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.289 
actually in one month when you pick this
box<00:01:53.040> up<00:01:53.280> you<00:01:53.820> know<00:01:53.939> I<00:01:53.970> can<00:01:54.090> be<00:01:54.149> able<00:01:54.210> to

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
box up you know I can be able to

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.109 
box up you know I can be able to
identify<00:01:54.689> the<00:01:54.750> box<00:01:55.049> and<00:01:55.619> you<00:01:55.979> just<00:01:56.460> snap<00:01:56.850> it

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
identify the box and you just snap it

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.249 
identify the box and you just snap it
you<00:01:57.180> hear<00:01:57.329> it<00:01:57.390> snap<00:01:57.509> in<00:01:57.810> there<00:01:57.930> it's<00:01:58.079> off

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
you hear it snap in there it's off

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.859 
you hear it snap in there it's off
before<00:01:58.950> Sean<00:01:59.219> begins<00:01:59.430> planting<00:02:00.240> he<00:02:00.509> breaks

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
before Sean begins planting he breaks

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.800 
before Sean begins planting he breaks
off<00:02:01.200> all<00:02:01.530> of<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:01.829> flowers<00:02:02.420> painful<00:02:03.420> as<00:02:03.600> that

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
off all of the flowers painful as that

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.130 
off all of the flowers painful as that
seems<00:02:04.200> if<00:02:04.740> I<00:02:04.950> were<00:02:05.850> to<00:02:06.180> not<00:02:06.360> do<00:02:06.540> anything<00:02:06.840> to

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
seems if I were to not do anything to

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.350 
seems if I were to not do anything to
this<00:02:07.290> plant<00:02:07.590> this<00:02:08.099> branch<00:02:08.459> right<00:02:08.580> here<00:02:08.759> this

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
this plant this branch right here this

this plant this branch right here this
one<00:02:09.599> here<00:02:09.840> and<00:02:09.989> this<00:02:10.110> one<00:02:10.349> here<00:02:10.379> you<00:02:10.619> know<00:02:10.679> the

one here and this one here you know the

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.650 
one here and this one here you know the
ones<00:02:10.950> you<00:02:11.009> see<00:02:11.580> sticking<00:02:11.879> out<00:02:12.060> would<00:02:12.480> just

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
ones you see sticking out would just

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.940 
ones you see sticking out would just
continue<00:02:12.840> on<00:02:13.170> growing

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
continue on growing

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.559 
continue on growing
suck<00:02:14.160> up<00:02:14.190> all<00:02:14.459> the<00:02:14.520> juice<00:02:14.819> of<00:02:15.000> the<00:02:15.120> plant<00:02:15.150> and

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
suck up all the juice of the plant and

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:18.949 
suck up all the juice of the plant and
have<00:02:16.050> five<00:02:16.410> long<00:02:17.209> branches<00:02:18.209> coming<00:02:18.450> off<00:02:18.629> and

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
have five long branches coming off and

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:20.930 
have five long branches coming off and
it's<00:02:19.590> just<00:02:19.650> not<00:02:19.920> appealing<00:02:20.160> and<00:02:20.550> the<00:02:20.790> other

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
it's just not appealing and the other

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.119 
it's just not appealing and the other
thing<00:02:21.150> too<00:02:21.330> is<00:02:21.360> these<00:02:21.900> little<00:02:22.170> the<00:02:22.890> flower

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:23.129 
thing too is these little the flower

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:25.220 
thing too is these little the flower
acts<00:02:23.430> like<00:02:23.610> a<00:02:23.640> sail<00:02:24.000> so<00:02:24.569> when<00:02:24.720> the<00:02:24.810> wind<00:02:25.019> blows

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
acts like a sail so when the wind blows

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.930 
acts like a sail so when the wind blows
it's<00:02:25.739> gonna<00:02:25.860> it's<00:02:26.220> gonna<00:02:26.280> just<00:02:26.519> keep<00:02:26.640> moving

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
it's gonna it's gonna just keep moving

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.190 
it's gonna it's gonna just keep moving
this<00:02:27.030> branch<00:02:27.300> back<00:02:27.540> and<00:02:27.750> forth<00:02:27.930> until<00:02:28.080> it

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
this branch back and forth until it

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.530 
this branch back and forth until it
snaps<00:02:28.560> off<00:02:28.890> maybe<00:02:29.519> grows<00:02:29.879> a<00:02:29.910> little<00:02:30.209> bit<00:02:30.330> more

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
snaps off maybe grows a little bit more

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.960 
snaps off maybe grows a little bit more
and<00:02:31.230> you<00:02:31.290> get<00:02:31.410> a<00:02:31.440> lousy<00:02:31.620> looking<00:02:32.069> plant<00:02:32.340> but<00:02:32.849> by

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
and you get a lousy looking plant but by

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.570 
and you get a lousy looking plant but by
clipping<00:02:33.269> this<00:02:33.480> off<00:02:33.690> like<00:02:34.560> this<00:02:34.769> each<00:02:35.250> one<00:02:35.459> of

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
clipping this off like this each one of

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.690 
clipping this off like this each one of
these<00:02:35.670> it's<00:02:36.390> forcing<00:02:36.900> these<00:02:37.319> Leafs<00:02:37.709> that<00:02:38.160> grow

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
these it's forcing these Leafs that grow

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.250 
these it's forcing these Leafs that grow
branches<00:02:38.910> out<00:02:39.300> rate<00:02:39.480> at<00:02:39.569> the<00:02:39.690> rate<00:02:39.930> but<00:02:40.110> where

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
branches out rate at the rate but where

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.990 
branches out rate at the rate but where
the<00:02:40.349> leaf<00:02:40.530> is<00:02:40.709> and<00:02:41.190> so<00:02:41.370> in<00:02:41.489> this<00:02:41.580> case<00:02:41.819> I'll

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
the leaf is and so in this case I'll

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.600 
the leaf is and so in this case I'll
probably<00:02:42.150> get<00:02:42.390> three<00:02:42.599> or<00:02:42.720> four<00:02:43.610> branches

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
probably get three or four branches

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.030 
probably get three or four branches
instead<00:02:45.360> of<00:02:45.660> just<00:02:45.840> that<00:02:46.019> one<00:02:46.200> next<00:02:46.799> thing

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
instead of just that one next thing

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.699 
instead of just that one next thing
we're<00:02:47.160> gonna<00:02:47.220> add<00:02:47.610> some<00:02:47.690> nutrients<00:02:48.709> time

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
we're gonna add some nutrients time

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:52.750 
we're gonna add some nutrients time
release<00:02:50.040> or<00:02:50.549> controlled<00:02:51.120> release<00:02:51.410> fertilizer

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
release or controlled release fertilizer

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.270 
release or controlled release fertilizer
basically<00:02:53.760> what<00:02:53.940> it<00:02:54.030> is<00:02:54.150> it's<00:02:54.360> a<00:02:54.950> coated<00:02:55.950> resin

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
basically what it is it's a coated resin

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.100 
basically what it is it's a coated resin
coated<00:02:56.610> fertilizer<00:02:57.090> that<00:02:57.390> when<00:02:57.989> the

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
coated fertilizer that when the

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.259 
coated fertilizer that when the
temperature<00:02:58.230> reset<00:02:58.920> reaches<00:02:59.430> 70<00:02:59.730> degrees<00:03:00.030> and

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269 
temperature reset reaches 70 degrees and

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:02.300 
temperature reset reaches 70 degrees and
above<00:03:00.569> and<00:03:00.959> water<00:03:01.349> is<00:03:01.470> applied<00:03:01.709> to<00:03:02.010> it<00:03:02.160> it

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
above and water is applied to it it

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.580 
above and water is applied to it it
releases<00:03:02.640> its<00:03:02.910> fertilizer<00:03:03.360> so<00:03:03.959> I<00:03:03.989> put<00:03:04.260> that<00:03:04.380> in

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
releases its fertilizer so I put that in

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.710 
releases its fertilizer so I put that in
there<00:03:04.709> just<00:03:04.950> because<00:03:05.340> I<00:03:05.579> know<00:03:05.940> the<00:03:06.360> person<00:03:06.690> is

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
there just because I know the person is

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.089 
there just because I know the person is
probably<00:03:06.840> not<00:03:07.140> going<00:03:07.260> to<00:03:07.319> fertilize<00:03:07.530> anyways

00:03:08.089 --> 00:03:08.099 
probably not going to fertilize anyways

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:10.880 
probably not going to fertilize anyways
near<00:03:08.360> enough<00:03:09.360> and<00:03:09.900> I<00:03:09.930> still<00:03:10.200> recommend<00:03:10.500> using

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
near enough and I still recommend using

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.490 
near enough and I still recommend using
a<00:03:11.099> liquid<00:03:11.430> water<00:03:12.420> soluble<00:03:12.720> fertilizer

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
a liquid water soluble fertilizer
