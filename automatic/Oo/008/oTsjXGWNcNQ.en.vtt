00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 and many had asked me which 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.990
 they were my favorite songs of 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:09.680
 video games so in this video 

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:09.680
 they will know 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:15.400
 i 

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:22.080
 or what transa mais I had not seen them and 

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:24.750
 I thought I had lost the lever 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.570
 my guitar but it was not after 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:31.530
 almost two months of not knowing anything about said 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:33.840

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:41.180

 Many had asked me on twitter 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.660
 what were my favorite songs 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.520
 of video games and it was difficult to choose a 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.860
 'top ten' because the truth is that they are 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.510
 more than 10 songs that I liked 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.970
 around all my life being a 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:58.730
 gamer but I remind you one thing is a 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:01.010
 very personal top do not take it so 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:03.050

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:42.680

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:45.520

 mexico like duck adventures despite 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.040
 be a game that was not so difficult 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:09.780
 It also has an excellent soundtrack 

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:13.880
 but this song in specific 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.880
 it really moves me 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.540

 shawn jay or zone j as I want to say 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.590
 are these songs that really you 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.750
 they make you feel at the last level and that is 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.060
 it really makes you feel the level is 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.340
 a kind of factory and really the 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:50.570
 song transports you like this guy 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.570
 of stage let's listen 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.150
 or 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:10.280
 in position number 6 we have a final 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:12.260
 fantasy 7 with the song of the first 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.630
 level there is no strange fixation 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.970
 for the first levels bombing frame 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:19.100
 reactor and talk about the end soundtrack 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:22.870
 fantasy 7 is talking about big words 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:22.870
 so let's listen 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:33.120
 Y 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:40.270
 the number 5 job I'm giving it to 

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:42.700
 the song of megaman 2 doctor willy 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:44.410
 stage one or the first stage of the 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.910
 doctor's strength will I know that 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:49.050
 many believed that he was going to put this 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:49.050
 first song 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:01.569
 and at number 4 we have another 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:03.700
 megaman song but this time it's a 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:05.739
 song of a most recent mega man of 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:07.750
 mega man 10 that came out in 2010 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:09.700
 and again it is one of the songs of 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:14.250
 the doctor will and so 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:14.250
 do not continue to listen to the number 4 post 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:27.560
 and for this third place we have a 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:30.439
 Arcadia game that fascinated me 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:31.779
 you already know what the girl is going to 

00:04:30.439 --> 00:04:33.620
 this song that I am going to mention 

00:04:31.779 --> 00:04:35.389
 it quickly became one of my 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:37.639
 favorite so much so I've come to 

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:40.550
 listen to the easy diary about ten times 

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:42.560
 good come ok ok ok maybe a little more 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:44.569
 the truth is that it is quite incredible 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.979
 since it has the rhythm of the beige truman 

00:04:44.569 --> 00:04:50.830
 which makes this song be 

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:50.830
 pretty turned on and in turn difficult 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:07.770
 and at number 2 we have a 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:10.800
 super nintendo game song 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:12.570
 yoshi's island or super mario world 2 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:14.460
 as many know it and the song that 

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:17.400
 I chose from this game is the song of 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:20.100
 final boss is going to be or baby is going to be 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:23.930
 a worthy song quite worthy of a 

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:23.930
 final boss let's hear him 

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:28.410
 all right 

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:40.050
 this number one position is going to take 

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:41.970
 one of the most incredible games that 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:44.340
 never played super mario bros 

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:45.960
 super mario bros in the legend of being 

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:48.030
 needy and one of the songs that 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:49.110
 I'm going to put this game again 

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:51.420
 have to see when you are fighting 

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:53.760
 against one of the bosses or bosses 

00:05:51.420 --> 00:06:12.600
 difficult, let's listen to the post 

00:05:53.760 --> 00:06:14.190
 number one and put together this top was pretty 

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:16.050
 difficult for me because being alone 

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:17.940
 ten songs I had to leave out 

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:19.590
 enough games this has been all for 

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:21.270
