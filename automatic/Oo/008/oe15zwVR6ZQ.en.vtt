00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:07.379
 Hello dear poppy I try now 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:12.090
 with the photo of this record edge too 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:19.520
 show that at the beginning of the series is it 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:19.520
 simply knit all reasonably fairly 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:39.790
 the special feature comes at the end of the series 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:44.050
 and you trick the last three 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:47.379
 not mesh but the rides is 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:49.500
 put forward like knitting to the left 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:54.070
 and the last three stitches will be 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:57.720
 so I'm off here now 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:01:01.449
 that means rides forward 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:05.409
 first measures broad mass third mass 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:08.170
 stand does my thread hangs 44 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:11.470
 Do not turn before the last three measures 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:14.020
 the work is over and now it is the 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:17.590
 next the new series and found quite 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:20.340
 normal with the right dimensions to the first 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:24.549
 tighten the chamber a bit tighter 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:26.829
 second kick the fourth sometimes goes like that 

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:30.250
 a little bit heavier but also completely 

00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:35.170
 normal and now you wear again 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:37.960
 the same procedure at the end and at the end 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:41.140
 is on each side whether left or right 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:45.069
 always the last three stitches 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:46.740
 do not stretch it trick it again 

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:52.240
 here to the end 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:55.389
 I hope it is still in the film that are 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:59.469
 my last three stitches after thread 

00:01:55.389 --> 00:02:03.700
 front first take off second take off 

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:13.920
 third stand rides is forward by 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:17.580
 trainer and measured again with right 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.580
 Continue knitting 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:36.050
 Kleist is the one idea for Qatar 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:39.900
 finds it's all very pretty 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:41.850
 because she also knew both sides 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.310
 looks the same with me sometimes 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:46.680
 The land mass is a bit big 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:49.040
 and I really like it all 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.040
 Well
