taking these bolts off and using my
special<00:00:21.560> tightening<00:00:22.560> tool<00:00:22.830> I<00:00:23.900> did<00:00:24.900> take<00:00:25.109> the

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
special tightening tool I did take the

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.230 
special tightening tool I did take the
intake<00:00:25.560> manifold<00:00:26.189> off<00:00:26.369> completely<00:00:26.939> with

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
intake manifold off completely with

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.690 
intake manifold off completely with
exception<00:00:27.900> of<00:00:29.840> electrical<00:00:30.840> system<00:00:31.320> and<00:00:31.700> I

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
exception of electrical system and I

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:41.479 
exception of electrical system and I
left<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:34.040> intake<00:00:38.690> manifold<00:00:39.690> intact<00:00:40.340> which<00:00:41.340> I

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
left the intake manifold intact which I

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.229 
left the intake manifold intact which I
thought<00:00:41.730> would<00:00:41.850> make<00:00:41.879> it<00:00:42.120> easier<00:00:42.510> to<00:00:42.570> install
