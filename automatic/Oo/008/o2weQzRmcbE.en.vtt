00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:34.530
 black in pretty body 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:40.800
 Omsk I was here such a box 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:46.740
 purple have a few 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:51.750
 particular advantages we see 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:55.200
 Intelligent zoom 65 magnification 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:01:01.120
 optics schneider pretty good 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:03.960
 battery lasts for 4 hours with more than 1 and 9 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.960
 megapixels 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:13.690
 Video removed also have built-in 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:16.260
 inside the apparatus an inter studio for 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:22.960
 video and photo processing 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:26.590
 connect the content via usb cable to 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:30.729
 your computer is installed with 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:34.420
 your break with your permission in the 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:35.250
 studio and you can use it now 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.090
 even 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:43.960
 update to latest version 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:47.229
 such a box was all there was 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:51.760
 In principle, there is nothing on the box 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:52.479
 aside the region directly to 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:58.110
 apparatus 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:02:02.770
 Well dressed but standard like all 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:06.119
 palm is placed again the same 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:09.190
 most advertising will not be repeated 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:14.050
 optical zoom 65 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:17.530
 If the full zoom is 72, in my opinion, we all 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:24.100
 remember how it looks from the front 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:26.290
 here with us . open not open 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:28.420
 turn off the device, he warns about 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:34.709
 Tom Erika reminds you that 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:34.709
 must turn on and open come back . 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:48.730
 Here is our battery which is enough for 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:50.440
 4 hours here is inserted snaps with 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:54.299

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:12.160

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:18.030
 this is a fashion outlet to control between 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:27.780
 video filming and what you have already taken 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:34.720

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:38.160
