the<00:01:25.590> only<00:01:25.770> drawbacks<00:01:26.520> to<00:01:26.850> this<00:01:27.000> type<00:01:27.270> of<00:01:27.299> thing

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
the only drawbacks to this type of thing

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.490 
the only drawbacks to this type of thing
is<00:01:28.009> that<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.189> way<00:01:29.880> it<00:01:30.090> is<00:01:30.119> almost<00:01:31.079> gives<00:01:31.350> your

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
is that the way it is almost gives your

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.010 
is that the way it is almost gives your
hand<00:01:31.829> and<00:01:32.040> awkward<00:01:32.490> hold<00:01:32.820> so<00:01:33.570> certain

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
hand and awkward hold so certain

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.560 
hand and awkward hold so certain
movements<00:01:34.590> are<00:01:34.710> restricted<00:01:35.100> for<00:01:36.030> example<00:01:36.479> if

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
movements are restricted for example if

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.319 
movements are restricted for example if
I<00:01:36.720> was<00:01:36.869> going<00:01:37.110> to<00:01:37.170> do<00:01:37.290> a<00:01:37.320> hang<00:01:37.650> clean<00:01:38.030> my<00:01:39.030> wrists

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
I was going to do a hang clean my wrists

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.840 
I was going to do a hang clean my wrists
would<00:01:39.689> hit<00:01:39.990> on<00:01:40.320> this<00:01:40.920> side<00:01:41.159> when<00:01:41.460> I<00:01:41.490> do<00:01:41.610> the

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
would hit on this side when I do the

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.679 
would hit on this side when I do the
transition<00:01:44.149> still<00:01:45.149> works<00:01:45.360> effectively

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
transition still works effectively

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.920 
transition still works effectively
though

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:47.930

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.830 
though
all<00:01:48.740> in<00:01:49.010> all<00:01:49.160> I<00:01:49.550> would<00:01:49.820> have<00:01:50.150> to<00:01:50.300> say<00:01:50.480> that<00:01:50.510> this
