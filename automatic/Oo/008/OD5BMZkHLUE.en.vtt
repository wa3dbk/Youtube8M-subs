00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 it's huge engine sits at mid 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.150
 length of its wings in pods 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.859
 equipped with special air inlets for 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.280
 control the flow according to the 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:10.889
 speed 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.480
 this system is very important it is 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.690
 thanks to him that this device has 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.100
 of exceptional power the 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.710
 speed reached by the blackbird 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.390
 explains the slimming of cl they are 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.010
 made largely in structure 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.680
 honeycomb and contain 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.420
 fuel but the bulk of 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.250
 this one is in five big 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.150
 tanks that occupies the almost 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.150
 entire fuselage 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.719
 in 1958 at the time of the design from to 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:45.579
 12 

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:47.860
 the most modern combat aircraft 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:50.739
 did not exceed mc2 their range of action 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:52.149
 and their operational ceilings was 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:53.079
 completely inadequate for 

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:55.870
 spy missions 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:58.510
 this new plane had to be completely 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:00.219
 revolutionary new materials 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.829
 indispensable and new machines 

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:05.610
 to manufacture them had to be designed to 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:05.610
 start from nothing 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.530
 lockheed already had some 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.690
 experience of machining parts in 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.520
 titanium but that could not constitute 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:21.200
 a starting point in view of the 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.240
 alloys that would have to be employed 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.980
 on this plane he had to be able to 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.860
 withstand very high temperatures 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:30.020
 for very long periods to mach 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.250
 3 parts of its coating 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:35.120
 was going to reach temperatures 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:36.410
 between 400 and 600 degrees this 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:39.470
 explains why his cell was 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:41.960
 made of 93% titanium alloy 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.460
 even though this metal is very expensive and 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.210
 that we had to spend a lot of money 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.210
 for its development 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.430
 metals designed to withstand 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.840
 exceptional efforts must be 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.210
 made in conditions just as 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.160
 exceptional some of the pieces 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.990
 mistresses of this device were 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:02.119
 formed with gigantic presses 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:05.090
 planned to operate at more than 800 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:07.160
 degrees before the blackbird he did not exist 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.239
 no machine of this kind so he 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.100
 had to be developed 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:12.140
 throughout the development of the 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:13.610
 blackbird its builder has been 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.680
 forced to experiment with new 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:18.170
 methods to obtain coins 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.120
 resistant and homogeneous it took a 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.950
 large number of tests their cost did 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.940
 never been revealed but it is 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.940
 certainly very high
