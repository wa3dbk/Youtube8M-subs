00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
counted 13 different mouth shapes I felt

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.390 
counted 13 different mouth shapes I felt
that<00:01:36.509> that<00:01:36.570> was<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:37.110> minimum<00:01:37.619> that<00:01:37.829> was

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
that that was the minimum that was

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.130 
that that was the minimum that was
needed<00:01:38.909> so<00:01:38.939> and<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:40.020> way<00:01:40.170> I<00:01:40.200> did<00:01:40.560> this<00:01:40.770> was<00:01:42.140> to

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
needed so and the way I did this was to

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.780 
needed so and the way I did this was to
just<00:01:43.380> start<00:01:43.619> with<00:01:43.860> a<00:01:43.890> few<00:01:44.159> simple<00:01:44.460> mouth

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
just start with a few simple mouth

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.730 
just start with a few simple mouth
shapes<00:01:45.149> and<00:01:45.500> I<00:01:46.500> would<00:01:46.710> run<00:01:47.369> my<00:01:47.579> animation

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
shapes and I would run my animation

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.280 
shapes and I would run my animation
against<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:49.860> soundtrack<00:01:50.430> and<00:01:51.290> whatever

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
against the soundtrack and whatever

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.620 
against the soundtrack and whatever
mouth<00:01:52.979> shape<00:01:53.280> seemed<00:01:53.640> to<00:01:53.729> be<00:01:53.880> missing<00:01:54.030> I<00:01:54.450> would

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
mouth shape seemed to be missing I would

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.499 
mouth shape seemed to be missing I would
just<00:01:54.810> go<00:01:55.020> in<00:01:55.049> and<00:01:55.530> I<00:01:55.619> would<00:01:55.799> draw<00:01:56.009> it<00:01:56.420> and<00:01:57.420> I

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
just go in and I would draw it and I

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.469 
just go in and I would draw it and I
just<00:01:57.780> created<00:01:58.110> as<00:01:58.409> many<00:01:58.700> mouth<00:01:59.700> shapes<00:02:00.090> as<00:02:00.329> I

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
just created as many mouth shapes as I

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.740 
just created as many mouth shapes as I
needed<00:02:01.969> there's<00:02:02.969> actually<00:02:03.420> a<00:02:03.450> lot<00:02:03.719> more

mouth<00:02:11.670> shapes<00:02:12.000> I<00:02:12.300> could<00:02:12.480> probably<00:02:12.720> talk<00:02:13.020> for

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
mouth shapes I could probably talk for

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.430 
mouth shapes I could probably talk for
half<00:02:13.500> an<00:02:13.710> hour<00:02:13.830> on<00:02:14.670> that<00:02:15.000> alone<00:02:15.450> and<00:02:15.870> maybe<00:02:16.110> at

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
mouse I included the entire lower half

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.090 
mouse I included the entire lower half
of<00:02:58.959> the<00:02:59.080> face<00:02:59.220> because<00:03:00.220> of<00:03:00.370> the<00:03:00.430> fact<00:03:00.700> that<00:03:02.100> the

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 
of the face because of the fact that the

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.059 
of the face because of the fact that the
the<00:03:03.130> jaw<00:03:04.120> has<00:03:04.450> to<00:03:04.660> open<00:03:05.110> the<00:03:05.410> beard<00:03:05.650> has<00:03:05.860> to

00:03:06.059 --> 00:03:06.069 
the jaw has to open the beard has to

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:11.479 
the jaw has to open the beard has to
enemy<00:03:06.600> and<00:03:08.010> the<00:03:09.010> face<00:03:09.489> has<00:03:09.970> to<00:03:10.209> widen<00:03:10.569> and

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
enemy and the face has to widen and

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:15.750 
enemy and the face has to widen and
narrow<00:03:12.489> as<00:03:12.880> the<00:03:13.420> mouth<00:03:14.190> narrows<00:03:15.190> and<00:03:15.340> widens

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
narrow as the mouth narrows and widens

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.010 
narrow as the mouth narrows and widens
so<00:03:16.720> that's<00:03:17.410> why<00:03:17.709> I<00:03:17.739> did<00:03:18.069> it<00:03:18.190> that<00:03:18.400> way<00:03:19.020> instead

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:20.020 
so that's why I did it that way instead

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:22.890 
so that's why I did it that way instead
of<00:03:20.350> just<00:03:20.709> say<00:03:21.459> putting<00:03:21.819> the<00:03:21.940> mouse<00:03:22.090> on<00:03:22.360> top<00:03:22.600> of

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
of just say putting the mouse on top of

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.740 
of just say putting the mouse on top of
a<00:03:23.019> head<00:03:23.620> because<00:03:24.370> that<00:03:24.519> whole<00:03:24.850> bottom<00:03:25.209> half<00:03:25.420> of

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
a head because that whole bottom half of

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.830 
a head because that whole bottom half of
the<00:03:25.870> head<00:03:26.080> needs<00:03:26.800> to<00:03:26.920> animate<00:03:27.519> to<00:03:28.450> give<00:03:28.630> you<00:03:28.810> a

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
the head needs to animate to give you a

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.830 
the head needs to animate to give you a
nice<00:03:29.110> kind<00:03:29.920> of<00:03:30.010> squishy-squashy<00:03:30.970> organic

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
nice kind of squishy-squashy organic

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:37.770 
nice kind of squishy-squashy organic
feeling<00:03:32.680> to<00:03:33.430> it<00:03:33.610> so<00:03:36.030> anyway<00:03:37.030> the<00:03:37.269> next<00:03:37.569> thing

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
feeling to it so anyway the next thing

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:47.420 
feeling to it so anyway the next thing
let<00:03:38.739> me<00:03:38.830> just<00:03:39.040> turn<00:03:39.280> back

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.220 

okay

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.270 

so<00:03:50.830> I<00:03:51.129> did<00:03:51.370> all<00:03:51.520> my<00:03:52.290> my<00:03:53.290> eye<00:03:53.319> shapes<00:03:53.800> my<00:03:54.099> brow

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
so I did all my my eye shapes my brow

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.210 
so I did all my my eye shapes my brow
shapes<00:03:54.610> my<00:03:54.910> mouth<00:03:55.330> shapes<00:03:55.690> all<00:03:56.319> in<00:03:56.769> the<00:03:56.950> front

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
shapes my mouth shapes all in the front

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.930 
shapes my mouth shapes all in the front
view<00:03:57.629> then<00:03:58.629> what<00:03:59.620> I<00:03:59.650> did<00:03:59.800> is<00:03:59.950> I<00:04:00.220> created<00:04:00.280> my

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:00.940 
view then what I did is I created my

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.800 
view then what I did is I created my
first<00:04:00.970> bone<00:04:01.510> layer<00:04:02.670> or<00:04:03.670> my<00:04:03.879> bow<00:04:04.269> in<00:04:04.420> action

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.810 
first bone layer or my bow in action

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:11.430 
first bone layer or my bow in action
actually<00:04:05.050> and<00:04:07.530> so<00:04:09.599> then<00:04:10.599> what<00:04:10.840> I<00:04:10.900> had<00:04:11.140> to<00:04:11.290> do

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:11.440 
actually and so then what I had to do

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:18.750 
actually and so then what I had to do
was<00:04:14.130> to<00:04:15.130> get<00:04:15.340> my<00:04:15.580> 3/4<00:04:16.389> view<00:04:16.570> over<00:04:17.049> here<00:04:17.440> I<00:04:17.760> had

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:18.760 
was to get my 3/4 view over here I had

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:23.159 
was to get my 3/4 view over here I had
to<00:04:18.880> drag<00:04:19.120> every<00:04:19.570> single<00:04:20.079> eye<00:04:21.210> layer<00:04:22.210> eyebrow

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:23.169 
to drag every single eye layer eyebrow

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:26.190 
to drag every single eye layer eyebrow
layer<00:04:23.470> the<00:04:23.830> glasses<00:04:24.100> the<00:04:24.700> beret<00:04:24.880> the<00:04:25.030> nose<00:04:25.900> the

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:26.200 
layer the glasses the beret the nose the

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:31.070 
layer the glasses the beret the nose the
ears<00:04:26.470> the<00:04:26.770> mouth<00:04:27.930> the<00:04:28.930> beard<00:04:29.169> and<00:04:29.440> everything

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 
ears the mouth the beard and everything

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.170 
ears the mouth the beard and everything
so<00:04:32.080> that's<00:04:32.530> about<00:04:32.740> oh<00:04:33.190> I<00:04:33.550> don't<00:04:33.700> know<00:04:33.910> probably

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:34.180 
so that's about oh I don't know probably

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:42.060 
so that's about oh I don't know probably
about<00:04:34.450> 2000<00:04:38.910> 20<00:04:39.910> letters<00:04:40.210> that<00:04:40.630> I<00:04:40.660> had<00:04:40.930> to<00:04:41.080> you

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:42.070 
about 2000 20 letters that I had to you

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:43.740 
about 2000 20 letters that I had to you
know<00:04:42.160> just<00:04:42.400> to<00:04:42.550> get<00:04:42.700> that<00:04:42.820> one<00:04:42.880> view<00:04:43.419> with<00:04:43.630> the

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:43.750 
know just to get that one view with the

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:47.340 
know just to get that one view with the
3/4<00:04:44.350> angle<00:04:44.770> and<00:04:44.979> then<00:04:45.760> same<00:04:46.180> thing<00:04:46.320> when<00:04:47.320> I

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:47.350 
3/4 angle and then same thing when I

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:49.530 
3/4 angle and then same thing when I
rotated<00:04:47.919> it<00:04:48.070> in<00:04:48.250> the<00:04:48.370> other<00:04:48.580> direction<00:04:48.850> this

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:49.540 
rotated it in the other direction this

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:56.040 
rotated it in the other direction this
is<00:04:49.600> on<00:04:49.960> the<00:04:50.169> y-axis<00:04:51.100> so<00:04:54.060> to<00:04:55.060> drag<00:04:55.300> over<00:04:55.539> all<00:04:55.840> the

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:56.050 
is on the y-axis so to drag over all the

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:58.940 
is on the y-axis so to drag over all the
points<00:04:56.470> and<00:04:56.710> you<00:04:57.070> know<00:04:57.610> correct<00:04:58.060> the

00:04:58.940 --> 00:04:58.950 
points and you know correct the

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:01.290 
points and you know correct the
perspective<00:04:59.950> of<00:05:00.220> the<00:05:00.370> glasses<00:05:00.880> and<00:05:01.090> the<00:05:01.180> eyes

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:01.300 
perspective of the glasses and the eyes

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.120 
perspective of the glasses and the eyes
and<00:05:01.330> everything<00:05:01.780> I'm<00:05:02.380> sure<00:05:02.620> a<00:05:02.650> lot<00:05:02.830> of<00:05:02.889> you

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:03.130 
and everything I'm sure a lot of you

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:07.140 
and everything I'm sure a lot of you
have<00:05:03.310> been<00:05:03.490> through<00:05:03.550> this<00:05:03.880> too<00:05:06.150> now

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:07.150 
have been through this too now

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:09.690 
have been through this too now
ordinarily<00:05:07.979> what<00:05:08.979> I<00:05:09.010> had<00:05:09.190> been<00:05:09.400> doing<00:05:09.520> before

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:09.700 
ordinarily what I had been doing before

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:12.570 
ordinarily what I had been doing before
that<00:05:10.300> is<00:05:10.539> I<00:05:10.870> actually<00:05:11.229> would<00:05:11.710> sit<00:05:12.100> down<00:05:12.160> with

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:12.580 
that is I actually would sit down with

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:14.370 
that is I actually would sit down with
pencil<00:05:13.090> and<00:05:13.210> paper<00:05:13.360> and<00:05:13.570> I<00:05:13.840> would<00:05:14.020> draw

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:14.380 
pencil and paper and I would draw

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:18.360 
pencil and paper and I would draw
exactly<00:05:15.370> what<00:05:15.610> each<00:05:15.789> shape<00:05:16.830> looked<00:05:17.830> like<00:05:18.010> in<00:05:18.280> a

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:18.370 
exactly what each shape looked like in a

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:22.409 
exactly what each shape looked like in a
3/4<00:05:19.120> view<00:05:19.360> or<00:05:19.660> an<00:05:20.260> up<00:05:20.410> and<00:05:20.560> a<00:05:20.680> down<00:05:21.090> view<00:05:22.090> and

00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:22.419 
3/4 view or an up and a down view and

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:24.719 
3/4 view or an up and a down view and
then<00:05:23.110> I'd<00:05:23.260> scan<00:05:23.560> it<00:05:23.770> and<00:05:23.919> I<00:05:24.010> would<00:05:24.190> bring<00:05:24.430> it<00:05:24.580> in

00:05:24.719 --> 00:05:24.729 
then I'd scan it and I would bring it in

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:27.240 
then I'd scan it and I would bring it in
and<00:05:25.000> that<00:05:25.690> gave<00:05:25.930> me<00:05:25.960> a<00:05:26.169> kind<00:05:26.470> of<00:05:26.530> a<00:05:26.650> template<00:05:27.070> to

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:27.250 
and that gave me a kind of a template to

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:31.680 
and that gave me a kind of a template to
work<00:05:27.280> over<00:05:28.530> but<00:05:29.530> in<00:05:29.650> this<00:05:29.860> case<00:05:30.510> it<00:05:31.510> was<00:05:31.660> a

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:31.690 
work over but in this case it was a

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:36.990 
work over but in this case it was a
fairly<00:05:32.050> simple<00:05:35.130> designed<00:05:36.130> character<00:05:36.729> so<00:05:36.970> that

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:37.000 
fairly simple designed character so that

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.830 
fairly simple designed character so that
Nell<00:05:37.360> just<00:05:37.660> wing<00:05:37.870> it<00:05:37.900> you<00:05:38.229> know<00:05:38.380> and<00:05:39.690> it's<00:05:40.690> a

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:40.840 
Nell just wing it you know and it's a

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.690 
Nell just wing it you know and it's a
kind<00:05:41.289> of<00:05:41.349> a<00:05:41.440> tedious<00:05:41.650> thing<00:05:42.130> where<00:05:42.340> you<00:05:42.490> have

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:42.700 
kind of a tedious thing where you have

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:44.339 
kind of a tedious thing where you have
to<00:05:42.820> go<00:05:42.970> back<00:05:43.180> and<00:05:43.419> forth<00:05:43.690> you<00:05:43.900> have<00:05:43.960> to<00:05:44.169> take

00:05:44.339 --> 00:05:44.349 
to go back and forth you have to take

00:05:44.349 --> 00:05:46.379 
to go back and forth you have to take
your<00:05:44.530> best<00:05:44.680> guess<00:05:45.010> as<00:05:45.280> to<00:05:45.310> exactly<00:05:45.970> where<00:05:46.210> the

00:05:46.379 --> 00:05:46.389 
your best guess as to exactly where the

00:05:46.389 --> 00:05:48.540 
your best guess as to exactly where the
features<00:05:46.840> are<00:05:47.020> going<00:05:47.229> to<00:05:47.320> be<00:05:47.530> and<00:05:47.830> then<00:05:48.430> you

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:48.550 
features are going to be and then you

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:51.690 
features are going to be and then you
test<00:05:48.849> it<00:05:49.090> you<00:05:49.270> know<00:05:49.419> by<00:05:50.190> moving<00:05:51.190> your<00:05:51.370> lever

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:51.700 
test it you know by moving your lever

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:54.690 
test it you know by moving your lever
back<00:05:52.000> and<00:05:52.030> forth<00:05:52.479> and<00:05:52.720> seeing<00:05:53.190> whether<00:05:54.190> the

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:54.700 
back and forth and seeing whether the

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:57.990 
back and forth and seeing whether the
character<00:05:55.150> looks<00:05:55.419> solid<00:05:55.750> or<00:05:56.169> not<00:05:56.380> and<00:05:57.000> if

00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:58.000 
character looks solid or not and if

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.750 
character looks solid or not and if
there's<00:05:58.210> any<00:05:58.419> weird<00:05:58.780> irregularity

00:05:59.750 --> 00:05:59.760 
there's any weird irregularity

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:01.280 
there's any weird irregularity
you<00:06:00.000> know<00:06:00.120> you<00:06:00.210> have<00:06:00.450> to<00:06:00.570> go<00:06:00.690> back<00:06:00.870> and<00:06:01.110> fix

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:01.290 
you know you have to go back and fix

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:02.990 
you know you have to go back and fix
them<00:06:01.530> so<00:06:01.710> that<00:06:01.950> that<00:06:02.670> was<00:06:02.820> pretty

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:03.000 
them so that that was pretty

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.370 
them so that that was pretty
time-consuming<00:06:05.300> also<00:06:06.300> I<00:06:06.630> did<00:06:06.990> the<00:06:07.140> same<00:06:07.320> thing

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:07.380 
time-consuming also I did the same thing

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:14.420 
time-consuming also I did the same thing
for<00:06:08.540> the<00:06:09.540> up<00:06:09.840> and<00:06:10.020> down<00:06:12.080> so<00:06:13.080> I<00:06:13.530> got<00:06:14.040> that<00:06:14.190> worked

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:14.430 
for the up and down so I got that worked

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:16.880 
for the up and down so I got that worked
pretty<00:06:14.670> well<00:06:14.910> but<00:06:15.180> the<00:06:15.690> the<00:06:16.110> really<00:06:16.590> cool

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:16.890 
pretty well but the the really cool

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:18.470 
pretty well but the the really cool
thing<00:06:17.220> I<00:06:17.370> thought<00:06:17.580> was<00:06:17.790> the<00:06:17.940> fact<00:06:18.150> that<00:06:18.330> you

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:18.480 
thing I thought was the fact that you

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:23.150 
thing I thought was the fact that you
can<00:06:18.630> combine<00:06:19.140> these<00:06:20.840> and<00:06:21.840> so<00:06:22.380> now<00:06:22.680> I've<00:06:22.890> got

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:23.160 
can combine these and so now I've got

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:28.310 
can combine these and so now I've got
any<00:06:24.060> number<00:06:24.540> of<00:06:24.750> different<00:06:24.990> head<00:06:25.650> angles<00:06:27.320> that

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:28.320 
any number of different head angles that

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:31.870 
any number of different head angles that
I<00:06:28.380> can<00:06:28.740> use

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:31.880 

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:38.000 

so<00:06:33.500> what<00:06:34.500> else<00:06:34.710> let's<00:06:35.010> see<00:06:35.220> so<00:06:35.570> also<00:06:36.570> I<00:06:36.980> did<00:06:37.980> a

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:38.010 
so what else let's see so also I did a

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:41.990 
so what else let's see so also I did a
bone<00:06:38.310> here<00:06:38.760> for<00:06:39.240> his<00:06:40.140> head<00:06:40.410> angle<00:06:40.860> I<00:06:41.100> didn't

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:42.000 
bone here for his head angle I didn't

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.030 
bone here for his head angle I didn't
use<00:06:42.150> it<00:06:42.180> very<00:06:42.480> much<00:06:42.690> I<00:06:42.930> used<00:06:43.140> that<00:06:43.290> very<00:06:43.560> subtly

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:44.040 
use it very much I used that very subtly

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:49.610 
use it very much I used that very subtly
and<00:06:45.500> then<00:06:46.500> I<00:06:46.620> made<00:06:46.830> another<00:06:47.100> one<00:06:48.200> so<00:06:49.200> he<00:06:49.440> can

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:49.620 
and then I made another one so he can

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:52.310 
and then I made another one so he can
lean<00:06:50.370> into<00:06:50.610> camera<00:06:51.240> and<00:06:51.420> go<00:06:51.780> back<00:06:51.990> a<00:06:52.020> little

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:52.320 
lean into camera and go back a little

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:53.630 
lean into camera and go back a little
bit<00:06:52.560> you<00:06:52.800> know<00:06:53.070> I<00:06:53.100> should<00:06:53.370> have<00:06:53.490> done

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:53.640 
bit you know I should have done

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:56.930 
bit you know I should have done
something<00:06:53.700> on<00:06:54.210> the<00:06:54.330> body<00:06:54.540> but<00:06:54.930> I<00:06:54.960> didn't<00:06:55.940> and

00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:56.940 
something on the body but I didn't and

00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:59.810 
something on the body but I didn't and
then<00:06:57.240> this<00:06:58.200> is<00:06:58.380> a<00:06:58.410> really<00:06:59.010> important<00:06:59.550> thing

00:06:59.810 --> 00:06:59.820 
then this is a really important thing

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:03.470 
then this is a really important thing
that<00:07:00.330> I<00:07:00.650> did<00:07:01.650> this<00:07:02.430> is<00:07:02.580> a<00:07:02.670> stretch<00:07:02.970> and<00:07:03.000> squash

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:03.480 
that I did this is a stretch and squash

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:09.460 
that I did this is a stretch and squash
bone<00:07:04.220> okay<00:07:05.220> now<00:07:05.670> when<00:07:06.660> you're<00:07:06.810> watching<00:07:07.020> the

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:09.470 
bone okay now when you're watching the

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:15.430 
bone okay now when you're watching the
animation<00:07:10.470> play<00:07:11.000> you<00:07:12.000> don't<00:07:12.030> really<00:07:14.240> see<00:07:15.240> it

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:15.440 
animation play you don't really see it

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:18.350 
animation play you don't really see it
but<00:07:16.440> you<00:07:16.620> feel<00:07:16.650> it<00:07:17.190> so<00:07:17.430> I'm<00:07:17.670> just<00:07:17.850> going<00:07:18.060> to<00:07:18.120> run

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:18.360 
but you feel it so I'm just going to run

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:19.280 
but you feel it so I'm just going to run
it<00:07:18.480> real<00:07:18.690> quick<00:07:18.930> here

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:19.290 
it real quick here

00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:23.240 
it real quick here
it<00:07:19.820> means<00:07:20.820> date<00:07:21.350> like<00:07:22.350> if<00:07:22.470> you<00:07:22.530> don't<00:07:22.650> dig<00:07:22.920> and

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:23.250 
it means date like if you don't dig and

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:25.970 
it means date like if you don't dig and
you<00:07:23.280> say<00:07:23.580> dig<00:07:23.880> I<00:07:24.210> dig<00:07:24.600> whoo<00:07:24.930> you're<00:07:25.050> on<00:07:25.170> like

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:25.980 
you say dig I dig whoo you're on like

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:27.800 
you say dig I dig whoo you're on like
I'm<00:07:26.160> the<00:07:26.490> wrong<00:07:26.640> cat<00:07:26.970> it's<00:07:27.210> the<00:07:27.390> wrong<00:07:27.570> word

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:27.810 
I'm the wrong cat it's the wrong word

00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:34.040 
I'm the wrong cat it's the wrong word
they<00:07:28.350> it<00:07:28.890> means<00:07:29.190> dig<00:07:29.610> so<00:07:30.330> anyway<00:07:32.750> that's<00:07:33.750> a

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:34.050 
they it means dig so anyway that's a

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:37.000 
they it means dig so anyway that's a
it's<00:07:34.320> a<00:07:34.410> good<00:07:34.590> way<00:07:34.830> to<00:07:34.860> give<00:07:35.310> your<00:07:35.550> animation<00:07:36.270> a

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:37.010 
it's a good way to give your animation a

00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:40.160 
it's a good way to give your animation a
more<00:07:38.010> organic<00:07:38.460> feel<00:07:39.000> I<00:07:39.330> think<00:07:39.660> a<00:07:39.840> lot<00:07:40.020> of<00:07:40.050> the

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:40.170 
more organic feel I think a lot of the

00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:42.140 
more organic feel I think a lot of the
problems<00:07:40.680> with<00:07:40.860> this<00:07:40.980> kind<00:07:41.310> of<00:07:41.370> animation<00:07:41.760> is

00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:42.150 
problems with this kind of animation is

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:45.530 
problems with this kind of animation is
the<00:07:42.180> fact<00:07:42.540> that<00:07:43.400> the<00:07:44.400> characters<00:07:45.030> look<00:07:45.330> rather

00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:45.540 
the fact that the characters look rather

00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:47.810 
the fact that the characters look rather
wooden<00:07:46.140> they<00:07:47.040> look<00:07:47.220> like<00:07:47.370> they're<00:07:47.580> made<00:07:47.790> out

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:47.820 
wooden they look like they're made out

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:50.540 
wooden they look like they're made out
of<00:07:48.060> cement<00:07:48.300> or<00:07:48.570> something<00:07:48.960> like<00:07:49.080> that

00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:50.550 
of cement or something like that

00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:55.070 
of cement or something like that
so<00:07:51.030> I<00:07:52.220> like<00:07:53.220> to<00:07:53.250> put<00:07:53.640> a<00:07:53.850> lot<00:07:54.240> of<00:07:54.360> distortion

00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:55.080 
so I like to put a lot of distortion

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:55.810 
so I like to put a lot of distortion
into<00:07:55.470> my

00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:55.820 
into my

00:07:55.820 --> 00:08:02.740 
into my
nation<00:07:57.520> so<00:07:59.290> anyway<00:08:00.290> I<00:08:00.910> think<00:08:01.910> that<00:08:02.360> gives<00:08:02.630> you

00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:02.750 
nation so anyway I think that gives you

00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:05.110 
nation so anyway I think that gives you
a<00:08:02.840> rough<00:08:03.110> idea<00:08:03.230> of<00:08:03.830> how<00:08:04.190> I<00:08:04.220> went<00:08:04.490> about<00:08:04.610> doing

00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:05.120 
a rough idea of how I went about doing

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:08.170 
a rough idea of how I went about doing
that<00:08:05.270> and<00:08:06.160> it<00:08:07.160> was<00:08:07.250> a<00:08:07.310> lot<00:08:07.460> of<00:08:07.490> fun<00:08:07.730> doing<00:08:07.940> it

00:08:08.170 --> 00:08:08.180 
that and it was a lot of fun doing it
