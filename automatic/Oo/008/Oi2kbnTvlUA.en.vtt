00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:06.026
 (question) I heard someone say 

00:00:06.026 --> 00:00:08.812
 There are many lost people in the Baptist Church. 

00:00:08.812 --> 00:00:10.910
 I thought I was saved, 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:14.467
 They will at least attend the Sunday worship. 

00:00:15.327 --> 00:00:17.335
 I often hear people say this, 

00:00:17.335 --> 00:00:18.532
 This is very worrying. 

00:00:18.532 --> 00:00:20.049
 I want to know what you think about it. 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:23.416
 (Paul Walsh) First, this is all true. 

00:00:23.416 --> 00:00:26.372
 We are, and not only limited to Baptist, 

00:00:29.098 --> 00:00:32.338
 Not limited to this, in today's evangelicalism, this is very embarrassing. 

00:00:32.338 --> 00:00:34.808
 The reason is, first, 

00:00:34.808 --> 00:00:37.498
 The gospel that is preached is not the gospel at all. 

00:00:37.498 --> 00:00:39.750
 The gospel is simplified. 

00:00:40.574 --> 00:00:43.416
 God man Christ 

00:00:43.416 --> 00:00:46.170
 Hanging on the wood, dying under the wrath of his heavenly Father, 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.034
 Resurrected from the dead, 

00:00:48.034 --> 00:00:49.788
 Sitting on the right side of the Father, 

00:00:49.788 --> 00:00:51.496
 Call everyone and tell everyone 

00:00:51.496 --> 00:00:52.724
 Repent and believe; 

00:00:52.724 --> 00:00:54.636
 Confirmation of salvation confidence 

00:00:54.636 --> 00:00:56.488
 It is the result of their lives. 

00:00:56.488 --> 00:00:57.840
 We simplify this to 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.922
 "Five things that God wants you to know," 

00:00:59.922 --> 00:01:01.191
 Or "four spiritual laws," 

00:01:01.191 --> 00:01:02.730
 If you agree with every point, 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.860
 Then make a little prayer, 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.370
 Someone should spend less time preaching, 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:10.748
 The minister who spends more time studying the Bible declares that you are saved. 

00:01:10.748 --> 00:01:14.174
 I am stubborn about this. 

00:01:15.184 --> 00:01:17.233
 It is this view, our gospel (simplified.) 

00:01:17.233 --> 00:01:19.132
 second, 

00:01:23.936 --> 00:01:27.108
 I have never regarded Catholicism as a church. 

00:01:27.108 --> 00:01:29.410
 But when I come to see Catholicism, 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:31.491
 Look at the Anglican Church, 

00:01:31.491 --> 00:01:33.332
 And when things happened in the UK, 

00:01:33.332 --> 00:01:36.494
 What happened in New England, 

00:01:36.878 --> 00:01:38.282
 And what is happening now; 

00:01:38.282 --> 00:01:41.208
 In my opinion, the devil is always working, 

00:01:41.208 --> 00:01:44.134
 People take it for granted and think that these people are saved. 

00:01:44.134 --> 00:01:47.060
 In the end, people seem to spend the least time 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.902
 Distinguish "what is the gospel", 

00:01:49.902 --> 00:01:51.918
 And whether a person is truly saved. 

00:01:51.918 --> 00:01:54.412
 If people just go to the front desk and do a prayer, 

00:01:54.412 --> 00:01:57.335
 We announced that he was saved and began discipleship with him. 

00:01:57.493 --> 00:02:00.469
 Maybe we should spend a few months on this person, 

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:03.315
 So that they have a biblical grasp. 

00:02:03.315 --> 00:02:05.471
 Our church is full of lost people, 

00:02:05.471 --> 00:02:06.497
 Most of the reasons 

00:02:06.497 --> 00:02:09.783
 Superficial from the pastor. 

00:02:09.783 --> 00:02:12.175
 Most of them have church growth planning, 

00:02:12.175 --> 00:02:14.955
 Let their church look like a playground, 

00:02:14.955 --> 00:02:18.365
 The gospel they preached was just like the Arabian Nights. 

00:02:19.815 --> 00:02:25.185
 (Mike Tomlinson) This is not just a question that is now available. 

00:02:25.649 --> 00:02:28.635
 I am reading Bink this week. 

00:02:28.635 --> 00:02:31.571
 He is sometimes very discouraged. 

00:02:32.062 --> 00:02:33.857
 He seems to be very harsh in his speech. 

00:02:33.857 --> 00:02:35.580
 But in his time, 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.303
 In the period of 1930 and 1940, 

00:02:38.693 --> 00:02:40.526
 He said, "I want to 

00:02:40.526 --> 00:02:44.194
 Among all American believers, 

00:02:44.824 --> 00:02:47.032
 Whether 2% of people are born again. ” 

00:02:47.032 --> 00:02:48.974
 (Bink) is even the greatest, 

00:02:48.974 --> 00:02:51.756
 The most famous preacher in the United States today, 

00:02:51.756 --> 00:02:53.741
 Said: In my church, 

00:02:53.741 --> 00:02:56.103
 If there are 5 percent of the people who believe in it 

00:02:56.103 --> 00:02:58.505
 It is a Christian, I will be very happy. 

00:02:58.505 --> 00:03:01.030
 Another concept is important: 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.858
 a kind, 

00:03:04.188 --> 00:03:05.294
 kind hearted 

00:03:05.294 --> 00:03:07.220
 Church discipline. 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.463
 I think this is very strange: 

00:03:09.463 --> 00:03:11.576
 People do not practice church discipline, 

00:03:11.576 --> 00:03:13.229
 Because they love the church 

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:15.382
 Better than Jesus loves the church. 

00:03:15.382 --> 00:03:16.647
 Jesus told them 

00:03:16.647 --> 00:03:18.422
 Go to church discipline, 

00:03:18.422 --> 00:03:20.769
 Not for sinners, we are all guilty, 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:22.827
 But for those who don’t bear fruit, 

00:03:22.827 --> 00:03:24.755
 Rebels who do not want to repent. 

00:03:26.785 --> 00:03:28.539
 One more thing is terrible: 

00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:30.993
 We are separated from liberalism. 

00:03:30.993 --> 00:03:33.124
 Many sects have a movement, 

00:03:33.124 --> 00:03:34.875
 Especially at the Southern Baptist Church, 

00:03:34.875 --> 00:03:36.704
 Seeing that liberalism is over, 

00:03:36.704 --> 00:03:39.613
 Less than a decade, 

00:03:39.613 --> 00:03:41.982
 We immediately entered neoliberalism. 

00:03:41.982 --> 00:03:43.218
 My point is, 

00:03:43.218 --> 00:03:44.692
 Neo-liberalism 

00:03:44.692 --> 00:03:46.536
 It is basically a church growth movement. 

00:03:46.536 --> 00:03:48.329
 Everything you do is based on 

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:50.742
 Marketing strategy, 

00:03:51.542 --> 00:03:54.376
 "Tell us what church you want, we will give you that church." 

00:03:54.376 --> 00:03:58.716
 Instead of asking God what kind of bride he wants. 

00:04:00.953 --> 00:04:03.786
 (Bill MacLeod) I have a daughter named Joanna. 

00:04:03.786 --> 00:04:05.502
 She said that she was saved, 

00:04:05.502 --> 00:04:08.097
 Baptized and joined the church, 

00:04:08.097 --> 00:04:12.193
 Looks like a true Christian, 

00:04:12.193 --> 00:04:14.742
 When she went to school, 

00:04:14.742 --> 00:04:17.716
 She always puts the Bible on top of other textbooks. 

00:04:17.716 --> 00:04:19.798
 The school principal told us: 

00:04:19.798 --> 00:04:21.576
 “We really like having your daughter at our school.” 

00:04:21.576 --> 00:04:23.054
 I said, "Why?" He said: 

00:04:23.054 --> 00:04:25.802
 "If anything happens to steal a chicken and touch a dog, your daughter found it. 

00:04:25.802 --> 00:04:28.330
 Will show the matter to the public," 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.836
 He said, "We are very happy that she is here." 

00:04:32.154 --> 00:04:34.334
 One night during the revival, she came to me, 

00:04:34.334 --> 00:04:37.979
 Said: "Dad, I want to be saved." 

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:41.818
 I said, "What? You mean that you are cold and back?" 

00:04:41.833 --> 00:04:44.509
 She said: "Dad, I never know the Lord. 

00:04:44.509 --> 00:04:47.323
 I know how to say this, I learned the Christian language from you and my mother, 

00:04:47.323 --> 00:04:50.158
 But I never knew the Lord. ” 

00:04:50.158 --> 00:04:52.371
 I took her to Christ. 

00:04:52.581 --> 00:04:56.428
 Before the revival, I had an assistant pastor. 

00:04:56.635 --> 00:04:58.442
 Is a very good lead singer, 

00:04:58.442 --> 00:05:01.209
 Very good at teaching children, 

00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:04.147
 He is with us for six months, or eight months. 

00:05:04.147 --> 00:05:07.522
 But the deacon and I feel that he has no results. 

00:05:07.737 --> 00:05:08.879
 We talked to him, 

00:05:08.879 --> 00:05:11.142
 In the end we have to ask him to leave, 

00:05:11.985 --> 00:05:13.529
 He left. 

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:16.843
 During the revival, he called me in the field. 

00:05:16.843 --> 00:05:17.997
 He says: 

00:05:18.327 --> 00:05:19.680
 "Last night when I prayed, 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.562
 God let me see 

00:05:21.562 --> 00:05:23.614
 I have never been reborn. 

00:05:23.614 --> 00:05:27.295
 Can I come to Saskatoon to meet you? ” 

00:05:27.295 --> 00:05:28.496
 I said, "No problem." 

00:05:28.496 --> 00:05:30.881
 We got together and got together with some pastors. 

00:05:30.881 --> 00:05:32.573
 He knelt down and we all fell down. 

00:05:32.573 --> 00:05:33.975
 We are coaching him, 

00:05:33.975 --> 00:05:35.697
 He prayed. 

00:05:35.887 --> 00:05:38.087
 I'll never forget, 

00:05:38.087 --> 00:05:39.653
 He suddenly shouted to: 

00:05:39.653 --> 00:05:42.529
 "God is real! God is real!" 

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:44.917
 What a big change! 

00:05:45.685 --> 00:05:47.541
 There are probably many such people, 

00:05:47.541 --> 00:05:48.452
 Know the language of the Christian, 

00:05:48.452 --> 00:05:50.323
 I have heard it from other people, 

00:05:50.323 --> 00:05:53.046
 But they don't know the Lord. 

00:05:55.814 --> 00:06:00.035
 (Bob Jennings) This is for the Lord Jesus. 

00:06:00.035 --> 00:06:01.586
 It must also be a burden, 

00:06:01.586 --> 00:06:04.997
 Because once, it surprised me, almost all, 

00:06:04.997 --> 00:06:08.047
 If not all metaphors, 

00:06:08.047 --> 00:06:09.676
 The teachings of the Lord 

00:06:09.676 --> 00:06:12.655
 Both are related to true and false conversion. 

00:06:12.655 --> 00:06:15.157
 For example, two people who build a house, 

00:06:15.157 --> 00:06:17.699
 Sowing and soil, 

00:06:17.699 --> 00:06:19.408
 Wheat and hazelnuts, 

00:06:19.408 --> 00:06:21.607
 Sheep and goats, 

00:06:21.607 --> 00:06:23.474
 Almost all metaphors 

00:06:23.474 --> 00:06:26.511
 All related to this. 

00:06:28.421 --> 00:06:29.572
 (Moderator) Brothers, what else do you want to say? 

00:06:29.583 --> 00:06:31.777
 (Bink) The largest mission workshop today is the church. 

00:06:31.777 --> 00:06:33.527
 Or the so-called "church."
