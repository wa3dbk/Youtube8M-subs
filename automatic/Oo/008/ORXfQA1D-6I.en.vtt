a<00:01:49.320> closer<00:01:49.619> look<00:01:49.770> at<00:01:50.009> these<00:01:50.189> because<00:01:50.520> that's

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
a closer look at these because that's

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.999

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
you see the value that's in these things

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:43.699 
you see the value that's in these things
and<00:03:42.480> you<00:03:42.750> just<00:03:42.780> have<00:03:43.080> no<00:03:43.110> idea<00:03:43.470> what's<00:03:43.620> gonna

don't know until maybe games workshop
starts<00:03:50.790> I'll<00:03:50.970> and<00:03:51.120> bits<00:03:51.239> themselves<00:03:51.780> but

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
starts I'll and bits themselves but

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:53.979 
starts I'll and bits themselves but
we're<00:03:52.470> all<00:03:52.530> going<00:03:52.620> to<00:03:52.739> need<00:03:52.860> bits<00:03:53.070> so<00:03:53.400> let's

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:53.989 
we're all going to need bits so let's

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:56.810 
we're all going to need bits so let's
let's<00:03:54.989> try<00:03:55.260> to<00:03:55.320> make<00:03:55.769> it<00:03:55.800> through<00:03:56.100> and<00:03:56.280> see<00:03:56.489> see

the new ones so here's right now here's
our<00:04:35.520> our<00:04:36.210> giblet<00:04:36.750> bin<00:04:36.900> it's<00:04:37.710> pretty<00:04:38.010> deep<00:04:38.250> I

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:38.430 
our our giblet bin it's pretty deep I

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:41.480 
our our giblet bin it's pretty deep I
mean<00:04:38.580> you<00:04:38.669> can<00:04:38.760> kind<00:04:39.000> of<00:04:39.770> you<00:04:40.770> talking<00:04:41.190> three

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 
mean you can kind of you talking three

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:43.430 
mean you can kind of you talking three
four<00:04:41.520> inches<00:04:42.000> of<00:04:42.060> just<00:04:42.330> solid<00:04:42.570> solid<00:04:43.080> bits

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:43.440 
four inches of just solid solid bits

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:45.770 
four inches of just solid solid bits
just<00:04:43.680> and<00:04:44.070> this<00:04:44.160> is<00:04:44.340> this<00:04:44.669> is<00:04:44.790> just<00:04:44.970> not<00:04:45.630> even

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:45.780 
just and this is this is just not even

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:47.420 
just and this is this is just not even
taking<00:04:46.050> it<00:04:46.230> down<00:04:46.380> on<00:04:46.530> what<00:04:46.680> we<00:04:46.800> have<00:04:46.980> and<00:04:47.280> then

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.430 
taking it down on what we have and then

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:51.320 
taking it down on what we have and then
there's<00:04:48.030> a<00:04:48.180> ton<00:04:48.480> more<00:04:48.960> of<00:04:49.290> a<00:04:50.120> bits<00:04:51.120> that<00:04:51.270> are

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:51.330 
there's a ton more of a bits that are

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:53.380 
there's a ton more of a bits that are
basically<00:04:51.570> just<00:04:51.960> you<00:04:52.140> know<00:04:52.230> just<00:04:52.830> kind<00:04:53.040> of<00:04:53.070> a

basically just you know just kind of a
certain<00:04:54.390> a<00:04:54.510> certain<00:04:54.570> bits<00:04:55.140> product<00:04:55.620> just<00:04:55.919> kind

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:56.100 
certain a certain bits product just kind

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:57.500 
certain a certain bits product just kind
of<00:04:56.160> something<00:04:56.310> like<00:04:56.490> that<00:04:56.550> or<00:04:57.060> you<00:04:57.270> know<00:04:57.360> just

and then this is just basically you know
you<00:05:15.870> might<00:05:16.110> get<00:05:16.260> one<00:05:16.440> or<00:05:16.470> two<00:05:16.590> of<00:05:16.770> these<00:05:16.860> screws

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:17.160 
you might get one or two of these screws

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:19.219 
you might get one or two of these screws
and<00:05:17.370> each<00:05:17.460> one<00:05:17.700> just<00:05:17.940> kind<00:05:18.300> of<00:05:18.390> like<00:05:18.780> random

00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:19.229 
and each one just kind of like random

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:21.890 
and each one just kind of like random
things<00:05:19.760> just<00:05:20.760> or<00:05:21.000> these<00:05:21.330> might<00:05:21.540> get<00:05:21.690> cut<00:05:21.870> down

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:21.900 
things just or these might get cut down

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:24.620 
things just or these might get cut down
if<00:05:22.380> they're<00:05:22.800> small<00:05:23.070> enough<00:05:23.130> to<00:05:23.370> go<00:05:23.669> into<00:05:23.880> this

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:24.630 
if they're small enough to go into this

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:26.600 
if they're small enough to go into this
bin<00:05:24.840> here<00:05:25.200> so<00:05:25.410> a<00:05:25.440> lot<00:05:25.830> of<00:05:25.860> planning<00:05:26.160> actually

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:26.610 
bin here so a lot of planning actually

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:27.890 
bin here so a lot of planning actually
goes<00:05:26.729> into<00:05:26.760> this<00:05:27.150> we<00:05:27.330> just<00:05:27.360> don't<00:05:27.690> rip

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:27.900 
goes into this we just don't rip

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:29.240 
goes into this we just don't rip
everything<00:05:28.169> down<00:05:28.320> and<00:05:28.470> store<00:05:28.860> it<00:05:28.919> in<00:05:29.010> a<00:05:29.070> bag

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:29.250 
everything down and store it in a bag

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:30.920 
everything down and store it in a bag
because<00:05:29.490> I<00:05:29.669> went<00:05:29.880> that<00:05:30.360> wouldn't<00:05:30.660> be<00:05:30.720> good<00:05:30.750> for

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:30.930 
because I went that wouldn't be good for

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:33.020 
because I went that wouldn't be good for
anybody<00:05:31.200> I<00:05:31.680> think<00:05:31.950> these<00:05:32.070> are<00:05:32.130> actually

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:33.030 
anybody I think these are actually

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:37.490 
anybody I think these are actually
slated<00:05:34.020> to<00:05:34.110> get<00:05:34.229> cut<00:05:34.500> down<00:05:34.530> here<00:05:35.160> so<00:05:36.380> we'll<00:05:37.380> be
