so<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:40.590> little<00:01:40.829> secret<00:01:41.040> about<00:01:41.070> that<00:01:41.340> is<00:01:41.520> if

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
so the little secret about that is if

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.429 
so the little secret about that is if
you<00:01:41.790> roll<00:01:42.030> to<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:42.240> ledge<00:01:42.479> and<00:01:42.780> down<00:01:43.170> throw<00:01:43.380> a

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
you roll to the ledge and down throw a

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.380 
you roll to the ledge and down throw a
turn<00:01:43.649> up<00:01:43.799> depending<00:01:44.640> on<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.759> level<00:01:45.119> I<00:01:45.329> believe

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
turn up depending on the level I believe

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.969 
turn up depending on the level I believe
there<00:01:45.810> hit<00:01:45.930> the<00:01:45.960> stage<00:01:46.229> and<00:01:46.409> lose<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:46.619> tip<00:01:46.799> box

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
there hit the stage and lose the tip box

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.859 
there hit the stage and lose the tip box
or<00:01:47.579> it'll<00:01:47.880> go<00:01:48.030> straight<00:01:48.299> down<00:01:48.390> and<00:01:48.450> hit<00:01:48.689> them

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
or it'll go straight down and hit them

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.690 
or it'll go straight down and hit them
and<00:01:49.110> hit<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.350> opponent<00:01:49.560> right<00:01:50.220> right<00:01:50.670> right

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
and hit the opponent right right right

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:51.050 
and hit the opponent right right right
right

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
right

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.490 
right
and<00:01:51.210> so<00:01:51.360> because<00:01:51.479> battlefield<00:01:52.170> has<00:01:52.350> that

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
and so because battlefield has that

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.230 
and so because battlefield has that
janky<00:01:52.860> ledge<00:01:53.009> that's<00:01:53.340> technically<00:01:53.790> not<00:01:53.850> there

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
janky ledge that's technically not there

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.999 
janky ledge that's technically not there
if<00:01:54.450> you<00:01:54.869> throw<00:01:55.049> a<00:01:55.140> turnip<00:01:55.500> straight<00:01:55.740> down<00:01:55.890> on

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
if you throw a turnip straight down on

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.440 
if you throw a turnip straight down on
battlefields<00:01:56.460> ledge<00:01:56.610> it<00:01:56.850> will<00:01:57.030> hit<00:01:57.299> the

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
battlefields ledge it will hit the

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.209 
battlefields ledge it will hit the
opponent

00:01:58.209 --> 00:01:58.219 
opponent

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:59.889 
opponent
and<00:01:58.880> I<00:01:58.939> might<00:01:59.060> even<00:01:59.090> like<00:01:59.359> bounce<00:01:59.570> them<00:01:59.780> up

00:01:59.889 --> 00:01:59.899 
and I might even like bounce them up

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:03.010 
and I might even like bounce them up
into<00:02:00.109> stage<00:02:00.350> or<00:02:00.530> something<00:02:00.619> great<00:02:01.030> okay<00:02:02.030> so<00:02:02.299> I

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
into stage or something great okay so I

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.539 
into stage or something great okay so I
think<00:02:03.140> dreamland<00:02:03.619> it<00:02:03.710> works<00:02:03.859> on<00:02:04.039> FD<00:02:04.429> it

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:04.549 
think dreamland it works on FD it

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:06.550 
think dreamland it works on FD it
doesn't<00:02:04.850> FD<00:02:05.060> it<00:02:05.149> loses<00:02:05.420> the<00:02:05.509> hitbox<00:02:05.840> it<00:02:06.319> does

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
doesn't FD it loses the hitbox it does

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.380 
doesn't FD it loses the hitbox it does
yeah<00:02:07.009> on<00:02:07.250> FD<00:02:07.520> if<00:02:07.640> you<00:02:07.729> throw<00:02:07.909> a<00:02:07.939> turn<00:02:08.090> down<00:02:08.269> like

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
yeah on FD if you throw a turn down like

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:09.850 
yeah on FD if you throw a turn down like
that<00:02:08.509> on<00:02:08.599> the<00:02:08.690> ledge<00:02:08.840> you<00:02:09.019> lose<00:02:09.440> the<00:02:09.560> hitbox

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
that on the ledge you lose the hitbox

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.949 
that on the ledge you lose the hitbox
and<00:02:10.129> if<00:02:10.849> you<00:02:10.940> do<00:02:11.030> it<00:02:11.090> on<00:02:11.180> platforms<00:02:11.660> it<00:02:11.780> keeps

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:11.959 
and if you do it on platforms it keeps

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:13.119 
and if you do it on platforms it keeps
the<00:02:12.049> hitbox<00:02:12.349> so<00:02:12.590> you<00:02:12.650> can<00:02:12.769> do<00:02:12.830> something<00:02:13.010> about

00:02:13.119 --> 00:02:13.129 
the hitbox so you can do something about

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:17.979 
the hitbox so you can do something about
this<00:02:13.430> random<00:02:14.390> peach<00:02:14.540> tag<00:02:14.780> yeah<00:02:16.660> so<00:02:17.660> I<00:02:17.690> really<00:02:17.959> I

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:17.989

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
really love the the pacing of this

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:20.979 
really love the the pacing of this
matchup<00:02:19.489> because<00:02:19.700> Marth<00:02:20.150> clearly<00:02:20.750> wins<00:02:20.900> the

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:20.989 
matchup because Marth clearly wins the

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:23.140 
matchup because Marth clearly wins the
neutral<00:02:21.230> game<00:02:21.379> but<00:02:22.220> has<00:02:22.489> a<00:02:22.519> really<00:02:22.910> hard<00:02:23.030> time

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
neutral game but has a really hard time

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:24.580 
neutral game but has a really hard time
fishing<00:02:23.599> and<00:02:23.750> finishing<00:02:24.080> it<00:02:24.170> up<00:02:24.260> and<00:02:24.470> has<00:02:24.560> to

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
fishing and finishing it up and has to

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.670 
fishing and finishing it up and has to
take<00:02:24.769> a<00:02:24.830> lot<00:02:25.010> of<00:02:25.040> risks<00:02:25.430> to<00:02:25.610> do<00:02:25.700> that<00:02:25.849> right<00:02:26.030> I

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
take a lot of risks to do that right I

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.509 
take a lot of risks to do that right I
don't<00:02:27.680> know<00:02:27.799> if<00:02:27.860> he<00:02:27.920> has<00:02:28.010> to<00:02:28.069> take<00:02:28.160> right<00:02:28.370> it

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:28.519 
don't know if he has to take right it

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:30.100 
don't know if he has to take right it
depends<00:02:28.760> on<00:02:28.819> how<00:02:28.970> good<00:02:29.330> he<00:02:29.569> wants<00:02:29.840> to<00:02:29.930> kill

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
depends on how good he wants to kill

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:31.750 
depends on how good he wants to kill
because<00:02:30.650> he<00:02:30.799> can<00:02:30.920> just<00:02:31.069> swat<00:02:31.280> away<00:02:31.310> at<00:02:31.579> peach

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
because he can just swat away at peach

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.400 
because he can just swat away at peach
for<00:02:31.940> ages<00:02:32.239> when<00:02:32.360> she's<00:02:32.510> recovering<00:02:32.870> uh-huh

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
I think that's the thing those whenever

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:33.520 
I think that's the thing those whenever
you<00:03:32.269> whenever<00:03:32.540> they<00:03:32.659> switch<00:03:32.900> characters<00:03:33.170> and

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530 
you whenever they switch characters and

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:34.780 
you whenever they switch characters and
especially<00:03:33.739> to<00:03:33.950> Kirk<00:03:34.129> you're<00:03:34.249> used<00:03:34.489> to<00:03:34.579> like

of figure out where his good time to get

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.110 
of figure out where his good time to get
in<00:03:41.930> will<00:03:42.079> be<00:03:42.249> yeah<00:03:43.280> our<00:03:43.549> models<00:03:43.819> definitely

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590 
feeling about right now and it's giving

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:47.379 
feeling about right now and it's giving
up<00:03:45.680> a<00:03:45.739> lot<00:03:45.859> of<00:03:45.920> damage<00:03:46.159> just<00:03:46.340> with<00:03:46.849> why<00:03:47.120> I<00:03:47.150> can

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:47.389 
up a lot of damage just with why I can

00:03:47.389 --> 00:03:49.330 
up a lot of damage just with why I can
just<00:03:47.689> slightly<00:03:48.049> off<00:03:48.170> these<00:03:48.530> but<00:03:48.739> I<00:03:48.769> don't<00:03:49.280> know

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
just slightly off these but I don't know

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:51.039 
just slightly off these but I don't know
I<00:03:49.370> think<00:03:49.579> it's<00:03:50.359> just<00:03:50.450> a<00:03:50.569> matter<00:03:50.719> of<00:03:50.840> how<00:03:50.989> long

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:51.049 
I think it's just a matter of how long

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:52.750 
I think it's just a matter of how long
it<00:03:51.260> takes<00:03:51.409> for<00:03:51.439> a<00:03:51.560> lot<00:03:51.680> of<00:03:51.799> download<00:03:52.129> once<00:03:52.670> he

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 
it takes for a lot of download once he

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:53.860 
it takes for a lot of download once he
figures<00:03:53.000> that<00:03:53.090> the<00:03:53.209> best<00:03:53.359> way<00:03:53.510> to<00:03:53.540> get<00:03:53.719> in<00:03:53.840> or
