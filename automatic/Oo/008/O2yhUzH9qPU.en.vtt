00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
core game but it appears to be a lot

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.620 
core game but it appears to be a lot
more<00:01:27.360> severe<00:01:27.840> than<00:01:28.020> that<00:01:28.229> which<00:01:28.590> again<00:01:29.630> really

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
more severe than that which again really

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.960 
more severe than that which again really
really<00:01:30.930> sucks<00:01:31.680> even<00:01:32.100> if<00:01:32.189> you<00:01:32.310> didn't<00:01:32.640> really

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.460 
really sucks even if you didn't really

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
always it's always very rough when that

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.630 
always it's always very rough when that
sort<00:01:42.210> of<00:01:42.240> stuff<00:01:42.509> happens<00:01:43.020> I<00:01:43.409> mean<00:01:44.040> they<00:01:44.399> have

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
sort of stuff happens I mean they have

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.700 
sort of stuff happens I mean they have
stated<00:01:45.090> and<00:01:45.479> it<00:01:45.570> seems<00:01:45.930> like<00:01:46.110> that<00:01:46.560> they're

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
stated and it seems like that they're

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.560 
stated and it seems like that they're
looking<00:01:47.009> for<00:01:47.369> other<00:01:47.490> opportunities<00:01:47.939> and

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
looking for other opportunities and

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:49.789 
looking for other opportunities and
other<00:01:48.659> options<00:01:49.200> for<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:49.530> command<00:01:49.770> and

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
other options for the command and

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.889 
other options for the command and
conquer<00:01:50.130> franchise<00:01:50.670> so<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:50.970> game<00:01:51.240> may<00:01:51.869> be

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
conquer franchise so the game may be

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.469 
conquer franchise so the game may be
cancelled<00:01:52.020> and<00:01:52.950> may<00:01:53.460> be<00:01:53.520> dead<00:01:53.820> but<00:01:53.850> the

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
cancelled and may be dead but the

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.770 
cancelled and may be dead but the
franchise<00:01:54.840> of<00:01:54.990> course<00:01:55.259> is<00:01:55.500> not<00:01:56.100> and<00:01:56.600> I<00:01:57.600> mean<00:01:57.719> it

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
franchise of course is not and I mean it

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.840 
franchise of course is not and I mean it
may<00:01:57.930> be<00:01:57.990> a<00:01:58.079> few<00:01:58.380> years<00:01:58.409> before<00:01:58.740> we<00:01:59.189> see<00:01:59.219> another

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
may be a few years before we see another

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.080 
may be a few years before we see another
command<00:02:00.210> and<00:02:00.360> conquer<00:02:00.719> game<00:02:00.960> and<00:02:01.640> well<00:02:02.640> maybe

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
command and conquer game and well maybe

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.639 
command and conquer game and well maybe
it<00:02:03.270> won't<00:02:03.360> be<00:02:03.479> generals<00:02:03.869> to<00:02:04.110> maybe<00:02:04.380> it'll<00:02:04.619> be

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
it won't be generals to maybe it'll be

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.109 
it won't be generals to maybe it'll be
something<00:02:05.100> else<00:02:05.460> maybe<00:02:05.670> it'll<00:02:05.909> be<00:02:06.000> an

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
something else maybe it'll be an

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.889 
something else maybe it'll be an
entirely<00:02:06.479> new<00:02:06.659> universe<00:02:08.149> but<00:02:09.149> I<00:02:09.209> mean<00:02:09.479> for<00:02:09.869> the

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
entirely new universe but I mean for the

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.809 
entirely new universe but I mean for the
most<00:02:10.110> part<00:02:10.470> this<00:02:11.009> is<00:02:11.190> not<00:02:11.310> the<00:02:11.489> first<00:02:11.520> time

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
most part this is not the first time

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.280 
most part this is not the first time
that<00:02:12.000> this<00:02:12.330> has<00:02:12.390> happened

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
that this has happened

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.530 
that this has happened
and<00:02:13.409> I<00:02:13.769> think<00:02:14.150> everything-everything<00:02:15.150> will

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
and I think everything-everything will

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.170 
and I think everything-everything will
go<00:02:15.659> on<00:02:15.870> it's<00:02:16.200> very<00:02:17.069> sad<00:02:17.370> to<00:02:17.400> see<00:02:17.760> but<00:02:18.000> I<00:02:18.030> mean

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
go on it's very sad to see but I mean

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.240 
go on it's very sad to see but I mean
it's<00:02:18.359> not<00:02:18.480> going<00:02:18.719> to<00:02:18.870> be<00:02:18.959> changing<00:02:19.560> most<00:02:20.069> of

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
it's not going to be changing most of

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:21.349 
it's not going to be changing most of
your<00:02:20.400> lives<00:02:20.609> who<00:02:20.849> are<00:02:20.969> watching<00:02:21.150> this

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:21.359 
your lives who are watching this

00:02:21.359 --> 00:02:23.119 
your lives who are watching this
probably<00:02:21.719> and<00:02:21.989> everyone<00:02:22.680> watching<00:02:22.859> this

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:23.129 
probably and everyone watching this

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:24.740 
probably and everyone watching this
isn't<00:02:23.459> really<00:02:23.700> going<00:02:24.000> to<00:02:24.120> be<00:02:24.209> affected<00:02:24.629> by

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
isn't really going to be affected by

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.970 
isn't really going to be affected by
this<00:02:25.849> but<00:02:26.849> I<00:02:26.879> a<00:02:26.969> so<00:02:27.420> it'll<00:02:28.170> be<00:02:28.200> pretty<00:02:28.530> much<00:02:28.769> the

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
this but I a so it'll be pretty much the

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.309 
this but I a so it'll be pretty much the
same<00:02:29.189> on<00:02:29.459> the<00:02:29.670> channel<00:02:30.239> I<00:02:30.450> mean<00:02:30.629> the<00:02:30.840> generals

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
same on the channel I mean the generals

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:33.199 
same on the channel I mean the generals
two<00:02:31.530> videos<00:02:31.859> will<00:02:32.069> be<00:02:32.220> up<00:02:32.370> so<00:02:32.700> if<00:02:32.819> you<00:02:32.939> wanted

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
two videos will be up so if you wanted

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:36.050 
two videos will be up so if you wanted
to<00:02:33.299> see<00:02:33.480> those<00:02:33.750> then<00:02:34.250> you<00:02:35.250> can<00:02:35.430> still<00:02:35.760> have

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
to see those then you can still have

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.789 
to see those then you can still have
your<00:02:36.299> chance<00:02:36.659> to<00:02:36.870> see<00:02:36.989> them<00:02:37.170> that<00:02:37.560> wasn't

00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:37.799 
your chance to see them that wasn't

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:39.140 
your chance to see them that wasn't
going<00:02:37.920> to<00:02:38.010> be<00:02:38.069> going<00:02:38.400> anywhere<00:02:38.790> at<00:02:38.939> least<00:02:39.000> not

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
going to be going anywhere at least not

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.990 
going to be going anywhere at least not
for<00:02:39.389> a<00:02:39.480> while<00:02:39.540> and<00:02:40.400> so<00:02:41.400> yeah<00:02:41.549> I<00:02:41.579> just<00:02:41.730> wanted<00:02:41.970> to

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
for a while and so yeah I just wanted to

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.050 
for a while and so yeah I just wanted to
share<00:02:42.180> kind<00:02:42.389> of<00:02:42.450> my<00:02:42.510> thoughts<00:02:42.689> and<00:02:42.959> feelings

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
share kind of my thoughts and feelings

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.789 
share kind of my thoughts and feelings
baseline<00:02:45.060> is<00:02:45.209> that<00:02:45.420> it<00:02:45.510> really<00:02:45.750> sucks<00:02:46.170> but<00:02:46.590> it

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:46.799 
baseline is that it really sucks but it

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:48.349 
baseline is that it really sucks but it
seems<00:02:47.220> like<00:02:47.370> there's<00:02:47.760> still<00:02:47.849> hope<00:02:48.120> for<00:02:48.180> the

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:48.359 
seems like there's still hope for the

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:49.789 
seems like there's still hope for the
command<00:02:48.599> and<00:02:48.689> conquer<00:02:48.930> franchise<00:02:49.379> and<00:02:49.560> maybe

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:49.799 
command and conquer franchise and maybe

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:51.800 
command and conquer franchise and maybe
they'll<00:02:50.400> kind<00:02:50.579> of<00:02:50.790> do<00:02:50.970> what<00:02:51.150> they<00:02:51.299> did<00:02:51.359> before

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
they'll kind of do what they did before

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.990 
they'll kind of do what they did before
and<00:02:52.049> they'll<00:02:52.500> sort<00:02:52.739> of<00:02:52.889> shut<00:02:53.159> down<00:02:53.459> the<00:02:53.639> studio

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
and they'll sort of shut down the studio

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.240 
and they'll sort of shut down the studio
and<00:02:54.299> make<00:02:54.329> a<00:02:54.480> new<00:02:54.780> studio<00:02:55.200> composed<00:02:55.769> of<00:02:56.010> many

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
and make a new studio composed of many

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.670 
and make a new studio composed of many
of<00:02:56.430> the<00:02:56.579> people<00:02:56.879> who<00:02:57.480> were<00:02:57.659> at<00:02:57.900> victory<00:02:58.409> games

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
of the people who were at victory games

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.679 
of the people who were at victory games
I'm<00:02:58.950> hoping<00:02:59.340> that<00:02:59.579> that's<00:03:00.060> what<00:03:00.299> they<00:03:00.419> do<00:03:00.480> and

00:03:00.679 --> 00:03:00.689 
I'm hoping that that's what they do and

00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:03.879 
I'm hoping that that's what they do and
then<00:03:00.810> they<00:03:00.900> just<00:03:00.930> sort<00:03:01.230> of<00:03:01.349> start<00:03:02.040> a<00:03:02.129> fresh<00:03:02.489> and

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:03.889 
then they just sort of start a fresh and

00:03:03.889 --> 00:03:06.679 
then they just sort of start a fresh and
kind<00:03:04.889> of<00:03:04.980> just<00:03:05.189> build<00:03:05.609> a<00:03:05.730> new<00:03:05.879> brand<00:03:06.299> around

00:03:06.679 --> 00:03:06.689 
kind of just build a new brand around

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:10.190 
kind of just build a new brand around
the<00:03:07.200> studio<00:03:07.769> but<00:03:08.700> hopefully<00:03:09.209> all<00:03:09.930> of<00:03:09.959> those

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
the studio but hopefully all of those

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.420 
the studio but hopefully all of those
people<00:03:10.439> who<00:03:10.620> worked<00:03:10.829> on<00:03:10.950> command<00:03:11.280> and<00:03:11.370> control

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
people who worked on command and control

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.069 
people who worked on command and control
the<00:03:11.819> people<00:03:12.060> who<00:03:12.150> put<00:03:12.299> a<00:03:12.329> lot<00:03:12.569> of<00:03:12.599> time<00:03:12.930> a<00:03:12.959> lot

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:13.079 
the people who put a lot of time a lot

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:16.309 
the people who put a lot of time a lot
of<00:03:13.319> effort<00:03:13.590> into<00:03:13.769> that<00:03:14.340> game<00:03:14.750> will<00:03:15.750> find

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:16.319 
of effort into that game will find

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:18.439 
of effort into that game will find
themselves<00:03:16.470> still<00:03:17.310> employed<00:03:17.849> and<00:03:18.090> hopefully

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:18.449 
themselves still employed and hopefully

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:19.819 
themselves still employed and hopefully
still<00:03:18.690> working<00:03:18.959> on<00:03:19.049> a<00:03:19.079> game<00:03:19.260> that<00:03:19.440> they<00:03:19.560> love

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:19.829 
still working on a game that they love

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:22.969 
still working on a game that they love
and<00:03:20.659> as<00:03:21.659> for<00:03:21.959> white<00:03:22.139> was<00:03:22.349> canceled<00:03:22.739> it<00:03:22.829> was

00:03:22.969 --> 00:03:22.979 
and as for white was canceled it was

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:25.520 
and as for white was canceled it was
mostly<00:03:23.370> because<00:03:23.699> of<00:03:23.970> alpha<00:03:24.810> feedback<00:03:25.260> I<00:03:25.290> mean

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
mostly because of alpha feedback I mean

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.229 
mostly because of alpha feedback I mean
it<00:03:25.590> was<00:03:25.680> very<00:03:25.979> clear<00:03:26.400> from<00:03:26.639> the<00:03:26.819> very<00:03:26.849> first

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
it was very clear from the very first

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:29.599 
it was very clear from the very first
day<00:03:27.569> of<00:03:27.989> the<00:03:28.139> closed<00:03:28.440> alpha<00:03:28.709> that<00:03:29.040> this<00:03:29.220> game

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:29.609 
day of the closed alpha that this game

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:31.789 
day of the closed alpha that this game
was<00:03:29.849> not<00:03:30.180> what<00:03:30.449> many<00:03:30.659> people<00:03:30.840> intended<00:03:31.620> this

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799 
was not what many people intended this

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:33.949 
was not what many people intended this
is<00:03:31.919> not<00:03:32.129> what<00:03:32.340> people<00:03:32.459> had<00:03:32.729> vented<00:03:33.030> envisioned

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
is not what people had vented envisioned

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:35.360 
is not what people had vented envisioned
and<00:03:34.169> this<00:03:34.260> is<00:03:34.409> not<00:03:34.620> what<00:03:34.829> we<00:03:34.859> had<00:03:35.040> come<00:03:35.250> to

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
and this is not what we had come to

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:36.920 
and this is not what we had come to
expect<00:03:35.669> from<00:03:35.819> a<00:03:36.000> command<00:03:36.239> and<00:03:36.389> conquer<00:03:36.720> game

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
expect from a command and conquer game

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.719 
expect from a command and conquer game
and<00:03:37.199> again<00:03:37.739> I<00:03:37.769> had<00:03:38.010> been<00:03:38.159> hoping<00:03:38.340> that<00:03:38.639> they

00:03:38.719 --> 00:03:38.729 
and again I had been hoping that they

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:40.189 
and again I had been hoping that they
would<00:03:38.819> sort<00:03:39.030> of<00:03:39.180> take<00:03:39.329> it<00:03:39.449> back<00:03:39.569> to<00:03:39.720> square<00:03:39.959> one

00:03:40.189 --> 00:03:40.199 
would sort of take it back to square one

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:42.349 
would sort of take it back to square one
sort<00:03:40.500> of<00:03:40.560> re-evaluate<00:03:40.769> the<00:03:41.370> core<00:03:41.699> game<00:03:42.030> and

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:42.359 
sort of re-evaluate the core game and

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:44.599 
sort of re-evaluate the core game and
not<00:03:42.959> just<00:03:43.290> scrap<00:03:43.799> everything<00:03:43.979> but<00:03:44.340> of<00:03:44.430> course

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:44.609 
not just scrap everything but of course

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:46.339 
not just scrap everything but of course
that's<00:03:44.729> not<00:03:44.940> my<00:03:45.090> decision<00:03:45.299> that's<00:03:46.169> of<00:03:46.319> course

00:03:46.339 --> 00:03:46.349 
that's not my decision that's of course

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:48.530 
that's not my decision that's of course
one<00:03:46.799> hundred<00:03:47.069> percent<00:03:47.099> up<00:03:47.579> to<00:03:47.849> and<00:03:48.150> the<00:03:48.269> right

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
one hundred percent up to and the right

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.469 
one hundred percent up to and the right
of<00:03:48.840> the<00:03:49.349> folks<00:03:49.590> over<00:03:49.769> at<00:03:50.010> EA<00:03:50.489> who<00:03:50.879> control<00:03:51.299> all

00:03:51.469 --> 00:03:51.479 
of the folks over at EA who control all

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:53.569 
of the folks over at EA who control all
of<00:03:51.510> that<00:03:51.810> I'm<00:03:52.590> sure<00:03:52.799> many<00:03:52.949> of<00:03:53.099> you<00:03:53.159> are<00:03:53.430> just

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:53.579 
of that I'm sure many of you are just

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:56.479 
of that I'm sure many of you are just
thinking<00:03:54.030> hey<00:03:54.269> screw<00:03:55.139> EA<00:03:55.319> but<00:03:56.069> that<00:03:56.280> doesn't

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:56.489 
thinking hey screw EA but that doesn't

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:58.939 
thinking hey screw EA but that doesn't
really<00:03:56.549> accomplish<00:03:57.120> anything<00:03:57.239> and<00:03:57.919> I<00:03:58.919> mean

00:03:58.939 --> 00:03:58.949 
really accomplish anything and I mean

00:03:58.949 --> 00:04:00.589 
really accomplish anything and I mean
there's<00:03:59.459> not<00:03:59.579> a<00:03:59.639> whole<00:03:59.760> lot<00:03:59.819> that<00:03:59.970> anyone<00:04:00.359> can

00:04:00.589 --> 00:04:00.599 
there's not a whole lot that anyone can

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:05.239 
there's not a whole lot that anyone can
do<00:04:01.079> other<00:04:01.439> than<00:04:01.859> just<00:04:01.919> say<00:04:02.340> it<00:04:02.579> really<00:04:02.819> sucks
