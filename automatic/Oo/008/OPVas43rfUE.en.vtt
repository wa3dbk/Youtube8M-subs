00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
can just see how good the actual bass

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:36.279 
can just see how good the actual bass
response<00:01:14.549> is<00:01:15.060> from<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.600> subwoofer

00:01:36.279 --> 00:01:36.289 

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:38.840

the sound quality from these speakers is

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.149 
the sound quality from these speakers is
not<00:01:39.179> bad<00:01:39.420> at<00:01:39.600> all<00:01:39.749> it<00:01:40.259> does<00:01:40.469> tend<00:01:40.679> to<00:01:40.770> sound<00:01:41.039> a

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
not bad at all it does tend to sound a

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.559 
not bad at all it does tend to sound a
little<00:01:41.310> bass<00:01:41.609> heavy<00:01:41.999> if<00:01:42.119> you<00:01:42.270> have<00:01:42.420> the

only things that I can really complain
about<00:02:19.829> other<00:02:20.160> a<00:02:20.250> few<00:02:20.610> of<00:02:20.700> the<00:02:20.819> cables<00:02:21.269> are

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
about other a few of the cables are

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.059 
about other a few of the cables are
hardwired<00:02:21.900> in<00:02:22.110> which<00:02:22.290> just<00:02:22.680> makes<00:02:22.890> it<00:02:22.980> a

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
hardwired in which just makes it a

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:24.559 
hardwired in which just makes it a
little<00:02:23.220> bit<00:02:23.370> more<00:02:23.489> difficult<00:02:24.030> from<00:02:24.239> a<00:02:24.299> cable

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569

management<00:02:25.170> point<00:02:25.319> of<00:02:25.470> view<00:02:25.530> but<00:02:26.250> again<00:02:26.400> it's

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:26.579 
management point of view but again it's

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:28.430 
management point of view but again it's
not<00:02:26.640> really<00:02:26.970> a<00:02:27.000> huge<00:02:27.329> issue<00:02:27.480> the<00:02:27.989> speakers

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
not really a huge issue the speakers

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.170 
not really a huge issue the speakers
have<00:02:28.620> this<00:02:28.709> feature<00:02:28.950> where<00:02:29.340> when<00:02:29.579> no<00:02:29.819> sound

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
have this feature where when no sound

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.309 
have this feature where when no sound
has<00:02:30.299> been<00:02:30.450> played<00:02:30.690> through<00:02:30.900> them<00:02:31.049> for<00:02:31.200> a<00:02:31.290> short

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
has been played through them for a short

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:33.080 
has been played through them for a short
while<00:02:31.650> they<00:02:31.890> will<00:02:32.010> turn<00:02:32.220> off<00:02:32.430> this<00:02:32.700> is<00:02:32.879> pretty

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
while they will turn off this is pretty

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.789 
while they will turn off this is pretty
nice<00:02:33.329> for<00:02:33.569> an<00:02:33.660> energy<00:02:33.959> saving<00:02:34.260> point<00:02:34.470> of<00:02:34.620> view

00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:34.799 
nice for an energy saving point of view

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:36.080 
nice for an energy saving point of view
the<00:02:35.040> only<00:02:35.190> known<00:02:35.489> thing<00:02:35.670> is<00:02:35.760> when<00:02:35.940> they<00:02:36.030> do

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
the only known thing is when they do

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.030 
the only known thing is when they do
come<00:02:36.390> back<00:02:36.510> on<00:02:36.690> again<00:02:36.810> they<00:02:37.109> take<00:02:37.319> five<00:02:37.680> or<00:02:37.829> six

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
come back on again they take five or six

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.039 
come back on again they take five or six
seconds<00:02:38.430> to<00:02:38.489> boot<00:02:38.760> up<00:02:38.970> this<00:02:39.629> is<00:02:39.810> pretty

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:40.049 
seconds to boot up this is pretty

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:41.270 
seconds to boot up this is pretty
annoying<00:02:40.410> if<00:02:40.620> you<00:02:40.739> want<00:02:40.920> to<00:02:40.980> listen<00:02:41.160> to

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
annoying if you want to listen to

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.650 
annoying if you want to listen to
something<00:02:41.670> quickly<00:02:41.910> and<00:02:42.030> it<00:02:42.180> can<00:02:42.209> get<00:02:42.510> on<00:02:42.630> your

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
something quickly and it can get on your

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.539 
something quickly and it can get on your
nerves<00:02:42.780> after<00:02:43.260> a<00:02:43.290> while<00:02:43.440> but<00:02:44.040> again<00:02:44.220> it's<00:02:44.370> not

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:44.549 
nerves after a while but again it's not

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:46.490 
nerves after a while but again it's not
really<00:02:44.880> a<00:02:44.910> major<00:02:45.239> issue<00:02:45.510> so<00:02:46.170> to<00:02:46.230> wrap<00:02:46.440> things

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
really a major issue so to wrap things

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.440 
really a major issue so to wrap things
up<00:02:46.829> these<00:02:47.010> speakers<00:02:47.459> are<00:02:47.519> pretty<00:02:47.910> nice<00:02:48.180> for

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
up these speakers are pretty nice for

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:49.879 
up these speakers are pretty nice for
what<00:02:48.599> they<00:02:48.780> cost<00:02:48.989> they're<00:02:49.260> about<00:02:49.500> forty

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:49.889 
what they cost they're about forty

00:02:49.889 --> 00:02:51.470

these<00:02:53.609> speakers<00:02:54.090> are<00:02:54.150> very<00:02:54.510> bass<00:02:54.720> heavy

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
these speakers are very bass heavy

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:57.199 
these speakers are very bass heavy
thanks<00:02:55.319> to<00:02:55.560> the<00:02:55.680> dedicated<00:02:56.280> so<00:02:56.489> buffer<00:02:56.849> even

with the bass style turned down low the

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:00.409 
with the bass style turned down low the
bass<00:02:58.950> is<00:02:59.160> still<00:02:59.340> pretty<00:02:59.579> prominent<00:03:00.090> and<00:03:00.209> other

it

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.729 
it
I've<00:03:02.430> also<00:03:02.700> tested<00:03:03.269> the<00:03:03.359> creative<00:03:03.840> T<00:03:04.109> 20s

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
I've also tested the creative T 20s

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:05.930 
I've also tested the creative T 20s
personally<00:03:05.310> I<00:03:05.370> prefer<00:03:05.730> these<00:03:05.880> because

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
personally I prefer these because

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.610 
personally I prefer these because
they're<00:03:06.450> a<00:03:06.480> little<00:03:06.660> bit<00:03:06.780> more<00:03:07.019> rounded<00:03:07.500> in

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
they're a little bit more rounded in

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.110 
they're a little bit more rounded in
terms<00:03:07.859> of<00:03:08.010> the<00:03:08.099> sound<00:03:08.280> everything<00:03:08.790> is<00:03:08.849> kind<00:03:09.030> of

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
terms of the sound everything is kind of

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.240 
terms of the sound everything is kind of
balanced<00:03:09.480> nicely<00:03:10.049> and<00:03:10.230> they're<00:03:10.709> not<00:03:10.829> quite<00:03:11.220> as

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
balanced nicely and they're not quite as

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.460 
balanced nicely and they're not quite as
bass<00:03:11.669> heavy<00:03:11.910> although<00:03:12.540> these<00:03:12.690> do<00:03:12.959> cost<00:03:13.290> a

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
bass heavy although these do cost a

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:14.839 
bass heavy although these do cost a
little<00:03:13.620> bit<00:03:13.769> more<00:03:14.099> I<00:03:14.310> found<00:03:14.579> that<00:03:14.730> these

00:03:14.839 --> 00:03:14.849 
little bit more I found that these

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:16.699 
little bit more I found that these
speakers<00:03:15.299> were<00:03:15.450> a<00:03:15.480> great<00:03:15.780> companion<00:03:16.169> for<00:03:16.410> a<00:03:16.470> TV

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
speakers were a great companion for a TV

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:18.470 
speakers were a great companion for a TV
for<00:03:17.099> example<00:03:17.160> for<00:03:17.849> watching<00:03:18.150> things<00:03:18.389> like

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
for example for watching things like
