 I rent a landlord 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:54.540
 explained that now 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.130
 experience a fuel economy system and 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:58.840
 reduce toxicity and 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.480
 exhaust values ​​because he 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.280
 chuck can tell you what is onboard 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.980
 computer but earlier fuel consumption 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:08.720
 Someone whose car is not always 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.690
 exceeded 10 liters per 100 kilometers yes a

 after installing the system consumption 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.260
 fuel has declined and now will not 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.800
 more than 9 ti liters of kvass cant confusion

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.040
 i see water canisters set right 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.090
 the trunk is different but right on the bottom here we are 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.080
 it and mounted water from here by gravity 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.230
 systems come in 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:01.450
 when I easily unfasten them 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.400
 can be removed no they remain in place 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.730
 just stretched then they can again 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:09.799
 at cost cruelty
