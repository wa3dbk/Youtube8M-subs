00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.420 
learnt throughout your studies it also
makes<00:02:07.750> our<00:02:07.900> projects<00:02:08.500> a<00:02:08.770> lot<00:02:09.009> more

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:09.430 
makes our projects a lot more

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:11.070 
makes our projects a lot more
interesting<00:02:10.149> and<00:02:10.210> creative<00:02:10.420> because<00:02:10.930> we've

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
interesting and creative because we've

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.620 
interesting and creative because we've
got<00:02:11.260> such<00:02:11.470> a<00:02:11.710> wide<00:02:11.920> array<00:02:11.950> of<00:02:12.300> resources<00:02:13.300> to

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
got such a wide array of resources to

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:14.220 
got such a wide array of resources to
choose<00:02:13.840> from

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
choose from

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.440 
choose from
with<00:02:14.650> the<00:02:14.800> learning<00:02:15.130> field<00:02:15.370> they<00:02:15.880> appreciate

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
with the learning field they appreciate

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:17.700 
with the learning field they appreciate
the<00:02:16.660> fact<00:02:16.870> that<00:02:17.050> they're<00:02:17.170> able<00:02:17.290> to<00:02:17.500> actually

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:17.710 
the fact that they're able to actually

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:20.280 
the fact that they're able to actually
guide<00:02:18.550> their<00:02:18.880> own<00:02:19.030> learning<00:02:19.690> and<00:02:20.020> use

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
guide their own learning and use

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.590 
guide their own learning and use
different<00:02:20.470> books<00:02:20.890> as<00:02:21.070> they<00:02:21.220> so<00:02:21.490> fit<00:02:21.790> and<00:02:22.510> I

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
different books as they so fit and I

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.240 
different books as they so fit and I
think<00:02:22.810> that's<00:02:22.990> probably<00:02:23.260> the<00:02:23.530> most<00:02:23.680> important

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
think that's probably the most important

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.070 
think that's probably the most important
aspect<00:02:24.610> of<00:02:24.700> it<00:02:24.760> so<00:02:24.970> I<00:02:25.060> can<00:02:25.240> divide<00:02:25.360> my<00:02:25.780> class

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
aspect of it so I can divide my class

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.950 
aspect of it so I can divide my class
into<00:02:26.800> say<00:02:27.100> five<00:02:27.370> groups<00:02:27.760> give<00:02:28.360> them<00:02:28.510> each<00:02:28.660> a

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:28.960 
into say five groups give them each a

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.530 
into say five groups give them each a
textbook<00:02:29.560> I<00:02:29.950> have<00:02:30.400> a<00:02:30.430> spokesperson<00:02:30.910> from<00:02:31.390> that

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
textbook I have a spokesperson from that

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.449 
textbook I have a spokesperson from that
group<00:02:31.780> then<00:02:32.470> we<00:02:32.560> look<00:02:32.740> for<00:02:32.920> common<00:02:33.070> threads

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
group then we look for common threads

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:36.090 
group then we look for common threads
and<00:02:33.970> have<00:02:34.540> a<00:02:34.570> class<00:02:34.840> discussion<00:02:35.140> and<00:02:35.740> that

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100 
and have a class discussion and that

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.070 
and have a class discussion and that
provides<00:02:36.580> a<00:02:36.700> springboard<00:02:37.180> for<00:02:37.540> us<00:02:37.780> to<00:02:37.959> move

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
provides a springboard for us to move

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.720 
provides a springboard for us to move
forward<00:02:38.530> and<00:02:38.620> they<00:02:38.740> can<00:02:38.920> have<00:02:39.040> it<00:02:39.220> in<00:02:39.580> the

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
forward and they can have it in the

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.750 
forward and they can have it in the
classroom<00:02:40.180> they<00:02:40.330> can<00:02:40.360> have<00:02:40.600> it<00:02:40.720> at<00:02:40.840> home<00:02:41.080> and

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
classroom they can have it at home and

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.900 
classroom they can have it at home and
you<00:02:42.760> know<00:02:42.880> speeds<00:02:43.300> up<00:02:43.630> our<00:02:44.020> ability<00:02:45.010> to<00:02:45.280> plan

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
you know speeds up our ability to plan

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:47.760 
you know speeds up our ability to plan
our<00:02:46.120> lessons<00:02:46.510> and<00:02:46.750> there's<00:02:47.080> a<00:02:47.110> lot<00:02:47.260> less<00:02:47.470> to

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:47.770 
our lessons and there's a lot less to

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:49.620 
our lessons and there's a lot less to
kind<00:02:47.980> of<00:02:48.070> worry<00:02:48.340> about<00:02:48.490> because<00:02:49.330> we<00:02:49.450> have

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
kind of worry about because we have

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:52.650 
kind of worry about because we have
everything<00:02:49.900> in<00:02:50.140> one<00:02:50.170> place<00:02:50.500> as<00:02:50.770> all<00:02:51.670> education

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
everything in one place as all education

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.980 
everything in one place as all education
is<00:02:52.810> we're<00:02:53.200> evolving<00:02:53.530> and<00:02:54.130> I<00:02:54.910> can't<00:02:55.510> predict

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:55.990 
is we're evolving and I can't predict

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:57.930 
is we're evolving and I can't predict
what<00:02:56.410> it<00:02:56.530> will<00:02:56.680> look<00:02:56.830> like<00:02:56.890> in<00:02:57.250> ten<00:02:57.459> years<00:02:57.670> I

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
what it will look like in ten years I

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:59.730 
what it will look like in ten years I
can<00:02:58.360> only<00:02:58.510> tell<00:02:58.780> you<00:02:58.840> it<00:02:59.110> will<00:02:59.260> be<00:02:59.290> different

00:02:59.730 --> 00:02:59.740 
can only tell you it will be different

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:00.720 
can only tell you it will be different
than<00:02:59.860> it<00:03:00.010> is<00:03:00.040> today

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
than it is today

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.650 
than it is today
but<00:03:01.300> I<00:03:01.330> am<00:03:01.600> sure<00:03:01.959> that<00:03:02.709> learning<00:03:03.400> field<00:03:03.670> is<00:03:04.150> is

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660 
but I am sure that learning field is is

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.229 
but I am sure that learning field is is
an<00:03:05.320> important<00:03:05.830> part<00:03:06.190> of<00:03:06.489> not<00:03:06.820> only<00:03:06.850> the

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239 
an important part of not only the

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:13.100 
an important part of not only the
present<00:03:07.660> but<00:03:07.780> the<00:03:07.900> future

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.170
