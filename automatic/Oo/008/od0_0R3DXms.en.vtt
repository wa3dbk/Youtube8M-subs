it's easy to find

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.370

unlike<00:01:59.700> diamond<00:02:00.119> candles<00:02:00.540> which<00:02:00.719> just<00:02:01.020> roll

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
unlike diamond candles which just roll

the<00:02:04.020> outside<00:02:04.350> which<00:02:04.590> sometimes<00:02:05.130> comes<00:02:05.399> loose

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
the outside which sometimes comes loose

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:06.980 
the outside which sometimes comes loose
and<00:02:05.880> you<00:02:06.000> have<00:02:06.119> to<00:02:06.270> burn<00:02:06.420> the<00:02:06.540> candle<00:02:06.810> all<00:02:06.899> the

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
and you have to burn the candle all the

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.290 
and you have to burn the candle all the
way<00:02:07.079> down<00:02:07.229> to<00:02:07.409> get<00:02:07.500> the<00:02:07.619> price<00:02:07.879> so<00:02:08.879> that<00:02:09.090> is<00:02:09.270> a

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
way down to get the price so that is a

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.140 
way down to get the price so that is a
good<00:02:09.569> thing<00:02:09.750> about<00:02:09.899> the<00:02:10.170> way<00:02:10.289> she<00:02:10.349> does<00:02:10.590> this
