00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:07.950
 Now we will show how to lay the wire 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:14.540
 well or a wiring harness from roughly speaking 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:14.540
 fuse covers to trunk 

00:00:15.109 --> 00:00:22.580
 so actually it's very simple 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:22.580
 open the door seals first 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:33.460
 you can still deploy 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:35.760
 we take away the carpet of correctional faces 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:35.760
 what 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:50.050
 then do the same back door 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:52.480
 burn the same thing rather sealer 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:56.760
 behind the only thing that will be necessary than 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.760
 understand the seat 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:10.660
 on the complexity is what is it 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:13.980
 shield wire behind the trim of the rack for this 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:13.980
 we use this device 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:23.400
 ordinary pond hard pond hard truth 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:27.280
 tied to the end of the wire and drag 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:30.610
 preferably of course under the carpet and the 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.970
 skin until he comes out here he got out 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.970
 it is seen 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.340
 pull up on the desired length 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:02:05.400
 just laying and also trying under 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:02:08.690
 carpet here and then raised it 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.690
 unscrew the clip 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:26.070
 we can insert 1 pass 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:37.840
 luggage compartment is very easy like this 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:41.370
 just pushing the cool chip 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.370
 and when to chop off 1 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:03:04.230
 here we will see that there is a very large gap 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:11.700
 the most here we stretch the wire from the unit 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:16.020
 salon set everything in reverse 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:22.910
 okay don't forget that coumarin is holding on 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:22.910
 also understand u 2 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:34.990
 there is no big load on the wire 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:37.420
 there are vibrations which rag movers 

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:41.020
 there are no parts either 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:45.330
 just respect him everywhere carpet 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:45.330
 if you close pay 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:57.900
 absolutely the same from the other side the door with 

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:57.900
 that side cars do 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:06.480
 work literally five minutes 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:21.519
 Well that's all 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:21.519
 and here we are already connecting where is she to you
