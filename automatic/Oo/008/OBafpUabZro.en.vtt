a match you would like to see sure I

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.849 
that it is time for a ride back heel
turn<00:00:57.059> I<00:00:57.090> think<00:00:57.239> that<00:00:57.570> that's<00:00:57.690> the<00:00:57.989> way<00:00:58.140> to<00:00:58.199> go<00:00:58.590> I

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
turn I think that that's the way to go I

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.250 
turn I think that that's the way to go I
think<00:00:59.460> WWE<00:00:59.760> has<00:01:00.180> booked<00:01:00.480> themselves<00:01:00.989> into<00:01:01.230> a

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
think WWE has booked themselves into a

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.500 
think WWE has booked themselves into a
corner<00:01:01.350> with<00:01:01.829> Ryback<00:01:02.280> he's<00:01:02.940> lost<00:01:03.149> five

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
corner with Ryback he's lost five

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.920 
corner with Ryback he's lost five
straight<00:01:03.719> pay<00:01:04.049> per<00:01:04.110> views<00:01:04.439> in<00:01:04.589> a<00:01:04.680> row<00:01:04.890> and<00:01:05.930> what

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
straight pay per views in a row and what

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.149 
straight pay per views in a row and what
else<00:01:07.080> is<00:01:07.229> there<00:01:07.350> for<00:01:07.409> him<00:01:07.650> to<00:01:07.770> do<00:01:07.890> at<00:01:08.010> this

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
else is there for him to do at this

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.620 
else is there for him to do at this
point<00:01:08.220> I<00:01:08.520> think<00:01:08.549> he's<00:01:08.909> lost<00:01:09.060> a<00:01:09.270> lot<00:01:09.299> of<00:01:09.450> his

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
point I think he's lost a lot of his

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.100 
point I think he's lost a lot of his
momentum<00:01:10.080> that<00:01:10.200> he<00:01:10.320> had<00:01:10.530> six<00:01:11.280> months<00:01:11.460> ago<00:01:12.110> the

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
momentum that he had six months ago the

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.929 
momentum that he had six months ago the
problem<00:01:13.680> I<00:01:13.860> think<00:01:13.890> with<00:01:14.159> turning<00:01:14.610> him<00:01:14.700> he'll

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
problem I think with turning him he'll

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.270 
problem I think with turning him he'll
there's<00:01:15.600> two<00:01:15.780> things<00:01:15.990> first<00:01:16.560> thing<00:01:16.860> is<00:01:17.070> you

turn him heel he loses the one thing
that<00:01:19.590> really<00:01:20.070> gets<00:01:20.610> him<00:01:20.820> over<00:01:20.970> with<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.240> fans

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
that really gets him over with the fans

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.330 
that really gets him over with the fans
and<00:01:21.720> that's<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.140> feed<00:01:22.350> me<00:01:22.530> more<00:01:22.560> chants<00:01:23.100> no

they won't be chanting that anymore the

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.760 
they won't be chanting that anymore the
second<00:01:26.040> thing<00:01:26.220> is<00:01:26.750> you<00:01:27.750> turn<00:01:27.990> my<00:01:28.200> back<00:01:28.409> heel

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
second thing is you turn my back heel

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.740 
second thing is you turn my back heel
you<00:01:28.950> push<00:01:29.220> him<00:01:29.340> as<00:01:29.490> a<00:01:29.520> monster<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:30.210> problem<00:01:30.630> is

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
you push him as a monster the problem is

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.050 
you push him as a monster the problem is
you<00:01:30.780> already<00:01:31.290> have<00:01:31.500> done<00:01:31.710> similar<00:01:32.220> monster

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
you already have done similar monster

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.420 
you already have done similar monster
pushes<00:01:33.479> with<00:01:33.689> Mark<00:01:33.930> Henry<00:01:34.380> and<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.680> Big<00:01:35.400> Show

pushes with Mark Henry and the Big Show

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.340 
pushes with Mark Henry and the Big Show
so<00:01:36.060> it's<00:01:36.210> something<00:01:36.479> that's<00:01:36.630> been<00:01:36.720> done

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
so it's something that's been done

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.719 
so it's something that's been done
several<00:01:37.740> times<00:01:38.100> in<00:01:38.490> recent<00:01:38.729> months<00:01:40.729> it's

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
several times in recent months it's

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:42.980 
several times in recent months it's
there<00:01:42.060> they're<00:01:42.270> really<00:01:42.509> in<00:01:42.570> a<00:01:42.630> tough<00:01:42.810> spot

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
there they're really in a tough spot

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.660 
there they're really in a tough spot
right<00:01:43.140> now<00:01:43.439> with<00:01:43.590> Ryback<00:01:43.950> as<00:01:44.159> to<00:01:44.280> what<00:01:44.430> to<00:01:44.549> do

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
right now with Ryback as to what to do

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.460 
right now with Ryback as to what to do
with<00:01:44.820> him<00:01:44.939> but<00:01:45.090> I<00:01:45.149> think<00:01:45.509> that<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:46.049> best<00:01:46.229> way

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
with him but I think that the best way

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:47.929 
with him but I think that the best way
to<00:01:46.530> go<00:01:46.710> right<00:01:46.920> now<00:01:46.950> you<00:01:47.159> have<00:01:47.640> to<00:01:47.759> take<00:01:47.909> a

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
to go right now you have to take a

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.870 
to go right now you have to take a
chance<00:01:48.240> turn<00:01:49.020> him<00:01:49.170> heel<00:01:49.229> have<00:01:50.220> him<00:01:50.460> go<00:01:50.640> over

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
chance turn him heel have him go over

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.490 
chance turn him heel have him go over
somebody<00:01:51.210> big<00:01:51.420> like<00:01:51.659> Sheamus<00:01:52.110> and<00:01:52.320> then<00:01:52.409> you

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
somebody big like Sheamus and then you

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.130 
somebody big like Sheamus and then you
get<00:01:52.619> set<00:01:52.860> up<00:01:52.890> Ryback<00:01:53.630> for<00:01:54.630> a<00:01:54.659> match<00:01:54.869> with<00:01:55.110> John

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
get set up Ryback for a match with John

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.130 
get set up Ryback for a match with John
Cena<00:01:55.320> after<00:01:56.040> WrestleMania<00:01:56.670> and<00:01:57.659> you<00:01:57.750> can<00:01:57.899> play

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
Cena after WrestleMania and you can play

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.959 
Cena after WrestleMania and you can play
up<00:01:58.350> the<00:01:58.500> fact<00:01:58.530> that<00:01:58.920> John<00:01:59.250> Cena<00:01:59.460> was<00:01:59.700> the<00:01:59.790> one

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
up the fact that John Cena was the one

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.179 
up the fact that John Cena was the one
that<00:02:00.149> eliminated<00:02:00.810> him<00:02:01.020> at<00:02:01.290> the<00:02:01.920> Royal<00:02:02.130> Rumble

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
that eliminated him at the Royal Rumble

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.249 
that eliminated him at the Royal Rumble
and<00:02:02.700> you<00:02:02.850> can<00:02:03.000> just<00:02:03.240> go<00:02:03.420> from<00:02:03.600> there<00:02:03.689> that

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
and you can just go from there that

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.950 
and you can just go from there that
seems<00:02:04.590> to<00:02:04.740> be<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:04.860> best<00:02:05.159> direction<00:02:05.549> to<00:02:05.850> go<00:02:06.000> for

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
seems to be the best direction to go for

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.199 
seems to be the best direction to go for
Ryback<00:02:07.140> in<00:02:07.619> my<00:02:07.740> opinion<00:02:08.069> have<00:02:08.610> him<00:02:08.789> turn<00:02:08.940> he'll

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
Ryback in my opinion have him turn he'll

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.479 
Ryback in my opinion have him turn he'll
get<00:02:09.810> a<00:02:09.840> big<00:02:10.020> win<00:02:10.200> at<00:02:10.319> WrestleMania<00:02:10.890> 29<00:02:11.160> and

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
get a big win at WrestleMania 29 and

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.600 
get a big win at WrestleMania 29 and
then<00:02:11.610> go<00:02:11.760> on<00:02:11.910> to<00:02:12.000> face<00:02:12.239> John<00:02:12.510> Cena

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
then go on to face John Cena

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.360 
then go on to face John Cena

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
the world heavyweight championship

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.470 
the world heavyweight championship
losing<00:02:19.500> its<00:02:19.830> value<00:02:20.190> it<00:02:20.400> has<00:02:20.849> been<00:02:21.000> the<00:02:21.150> opener

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
losing its value it has been the opener

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.390 
losing its value it has been the opener
match<00:02:21.690> or<00:02:21.989> very<00:02:22.170> early<00:02:22.230> for<00:02:22.739> a<00:02:23.010> lot<00:02:23.280> of

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
match or very early for a lot of

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.920 
match or very early for a lot of
pay-per-views<00:02:23.880> it<00:02:24.060> honestly<00:02:24.420> seems<00:02:24.720> like<00:02:24.900> a

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
pay-per-views it honestly seems like a

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.010 
pay-per-views it honestly seems like a
midcard<00:02:25.200> title<00:02:25.770> now<00:02:25.890> uh<00:02:26.700> it<00:02:27.060> has<00:02:27.270> austin's

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
midcard title now uh it has austin's

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:29.870 
midcard title now uh it has austin's
value<00:02:28.349> it's<00:02:28.500> been<00:02:28.680> losing<00:02:28.920> its<00:02:29.220> value<00:02:29.580> for

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
value it's been losing its value for

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.030 
value it's been losing its value for
quite<00:02:30.120> a<00:02:30.150> while<00:02:30.390> now<00:02:30.450> I<00:02:30.660> think<00:02:31.050> since<00:02:31.709> the

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
quite a while now I think since the

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.260 
quite a while now I think since the
world<00:02:32.250> title<00:02:32.670> went<00:02:32.910> back<00:02:33.120> to<00:02:33.330> SmackDown<00:02:33.900> in

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.270 
world title went back to SmackDown in

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:37.910 
world title went back to SmackDown in
2008-2009<00:02:36.270> whenever<00:02:36.750> it<00:02:36.870> was<00:02:37.020> from<00:02:37.739> that

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
2008-2009 whenever it was from that

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.920 
2008-2009 whenever it was from that
point<00:02:38.160> on<00:02:38.340> the<00:02:38.489> world<00:02:38.670> title<00:02:39.090> has<00:02:39.269> really<00:02:39.630> felt

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
point on the world title has really felt

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.949 
point on the world title has really felt
like<00:02:40.019> a<00:02:40.489> secondary<00:02:41.489> title<00:02:42.000> essentially<00:02:42.660> I

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
like a secondary title essentially I

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:44.449 
like a secondary title essentially I
like<00:02:43.560> to<00:02:43.709> look<00:02:43.800> at<00:02:44.010> it<00:02:44.160> as<00:02:44.280> the

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
like to look at it as the

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:46.009 
like to look at it as the
Intercontinental<00:02:45.060> title<00:02:45.090> at<00:02:45.420> this<00:02:45.569> point<00:02:45.870> I

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:46.019 
Intercontinental title at this point I

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:47.690 
Intercontinental title at this point I
mean<00:02:46.170> that's<00:02:46.739> what<00:02:46.980> it<00:02:47.069> feels<00:02:47.250> like<00:02:47.340> to<00:02:47.489> me

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
mean that's what it feels like to me

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.110 
mean that's what it feels like to me
it's<00:02:48.180> not<00:02:48.269> even<00:02:48.450> a<00:02:49.080> world<00:02:49.500> title<00:02:49.920> and<00:02:50.370> the

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
it's not even a world title and the

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.820 
it's not even a world title and the
Intercontinental<00:02:51.810> title<00:02:51.840> and<00:02:52.319> the<00:02:52.500> u.s.

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.550 
Intercontinental title and the u.s.
title<00:02:53.040> feel<00:02:53.430> even<00:02:53.910> lower<00:02:54.090> than<00:02:54.209> that<00:02:54.540> but<00:02:55.440> yeah

you know they just they like to open up
the<00:03:03.180> pay<00:03:03.299> per<00:03:03.360> views<00:03:03.660> with<00:03:03.810> a<00:03:03.840> big<00:03:04.080> match<00:03:04.260> so

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
the pay per views with a big match so

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.380 
the pay per views with a big match so
that<00:03:04.709> their<00:03:04.920> mindset<00:03:05.430> is<00:03:05.580> that<00:03:05.790> since<00:03:06.120> it's<00:03:06.209> a

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
that their mindset is that since it's a

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.420 
that their mindset is that since it's a
world<00:03:06.569> title<00:03:06.810> and<00:03:07.200> it's<00:03:07.319> not<00:03:07.500> the<00:03:07.620> WB<00:03:08.010> retitle

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
world title and it's not the WB retitle

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.160 
world title and it's not the WB retitle
they'll<00:03:08.940> put<00:03:09.150> that<00:03:09.299> in<00:03:09.420> the<00:03:09.510> beginning<00:03:09.630> and

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
they'll put that in the beginning and

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.100 
they'll put that in the beginning and
start<00:03:10.200> off<00:03:10.500> the<00:03:10.620> show<00:03:10.650> and<00:03:10.950> a<00:03:11.010> hot<00:03:11.190> note<00:03:11.400> I

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110 
start off the show and a hot note I

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.539 
start off the show and a hot note I
think<00:03:13.110> that<00:03:13.530> they<00:03:13.650> should<00:03:13.680> have<00:03:14.190> the<00:03:14.340> world

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:14.549 
think that they should have the world

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:16.729 
think that they should have the world
title<00:03:14.940> match<00:03:14.970> either<00:03:15.420> you<00:03:16.049> know<00:03:16.140> alternate

title match either you know alternate

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:18.620 
title match either you know alternate

for whatever reason they feel the world
title<00:03:26.280> is<00:03:26.640> not<00:03:26.880> that<00:03:27.060> important<00:03:27.570> and<00:03:27.750> you<00:03:28.590> know

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
title is not that important and you know

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.430 
title is not that important and you know
Smackdown<00:03:29.250> is<00:03:29.579> the<00:03:29.820> by<00:03:30.450> far<00:03:30.480> in<00:03:30.900> the<00:03:30.989> secondary

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
Smackdown is the by far in the secondary

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.680 
Smackdown is the by far in the secondary
brand<00:03:31.859> and<00:03:32.160> there's<00:03:32.670> not<00:03:32.820> really<00:03:33.030> need<00:03:33.420> to

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
brand and there's not really need to

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:38.120 
brand and there's not really need to
elevate<00:03:34.560> that<00:03:34.859> title<00:03:36.470> and<00:03:37.470> I<00:03:37.560> think<00:03:37.859> the<00:03:38.100> only

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
elevate that title and I think the only

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.340 
elevate that title and I think the only
reason<00:03:38.640> we<00:03:38.940> haven't<00:03:39.150> seen<00:03:39.480> a<00:03:39.540> merger<00:03:40.079> at<00:03:40.170> this

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.350 
reason we haven't seen a merger at this

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:42.500 
reason we haven't seen a merger at this
point<00:03:40.650> is<00:03:40.799> because<00:03:41.190> they're<00:03:41.850> still<00:03:42.209> doing

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
point is because they're still doing

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.930 
point is because they're still doing
Smackdown<00:03:43.440> branded<00:03:43.950> house<00:03:44.160> shows<00:03:44.519> and<00:03:44.880> they

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
Smackdown branded house shows and they

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.640 
Smackdown branded house shows and they
want<00:03:45.120> to<00:03:45.150> have<00:03:45.269> a<00:03:45.329> world<00:03:45.540> title<00:03:45.780> match<00:03:45.989> on<00:03:46.470> the

want to have a world title match on the
Smackdown<00:03:47.070> shows<00:03:47.959> but<00:03:48.959> I<00:03:48.989> think<00:03:49.620> at<00:03:49.739> some

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
Smackdown shows but I think at some

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.610 
Smackdown shows but I think at some
point<00:03:49.980> you<00:03:50.489> might<00:03:50.670> just<00:03:50.910> want<00:03:51.209> to<00:03:51.239> consider

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620 
point you might just want to consider

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:54.650 
point you might just want to consider
merging<00:03:52.620> titles<00:03:53.370> and<00:03:53.670> just<00:03:53.970> having<00:03:54.150> one<00:03:54.420> world

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
merging titles and just having one world

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.770 
merging titles and just having one world
title<00:03:55.079> that's<00:03:55.230> just<00:03:55.470> my<00:03:55.650> opinion<00:03:56.660> all<00:03:57.660> right

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
title that's just my opinion all right

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.830 
title that's just my opinion all right
this<00:03:57.989> one<00:03:58.200> comes<00:03:58.440> from<00:03:58.530> LT<00:03:59.190> surreal<00:03:59.760> with<00:04:00.540> Jack

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
this one comes from LT surreal with Jack

Swagger's<00:04:01.290> title<00:04:01.650> match<00:04:01.769> possibly<00:04:02.430> in

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:02.609 
Swagger's title match possibly in

Swagger's title match possibly in
jeopardy<00:04:02.970> who<00:04:03.630> do<00:04:03.750> you<00:04:03.840> think<00:04:03.870> should<00:04:04.079> replace

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
jeopardy who do you think should replace

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:06.680

him<00:04:04.680> to<00:04:04.829> face<00:04:05.010> Del<00:04:05.370> Rio<00:04:05.579> at<00:04:05.880> WrestleMania<00:04:06.480> I

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
him to face Del Rio at WrestleMania I

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:08.630 
him to face Del Rio at WrestleMania I
think<00:04:07.380> it's<00:04:07.500> a<00:04:07.590> no-brainer<00:04:07.739> here<00:04:08.280> I<00:04:08.310> think

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640 
think it's a no-brainer here I think

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.370 
think it's a no-brainer here I think
that<00:04:08.850> if<00:04:09.090> you're<00:04:09.660> not<00:04:09.840> going<00:04:10.019> to<00:04:10.079> have<00:04:10.170> Jack

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:10.380 
that if you're not going to have Jack

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:11.599 
that if you're not going to have Jack
Swagger<00:04:10.829> in<00:04:10.920> the<00:04:11.010> title<00:04:11.310> match<00:04:11.430> of

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:11.609 
Swagger in the title match of

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:14.930 
Swagger in the title match of
WrestleMania<00:04:11.870> then<00:04:12.870> you<00:04:13.170> have<00:04:13.470> Dolph<00:04:14.459> Ziggler

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940 
WrestleMania then you have Dolph Ziggler

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.690 
WrestleMania then you have Dolph Ziggler
cash<00:04:15.420> it<00:04:15.690> in<00:04:15.750> on<00:04:15.900> Del<00:04:16.139> Rio<00:04:16.350> you<00:04:17.070> could<00:04:17.310> do<00:04:17.430> some

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:17.700 
cash it in on Del Rio you could do some

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:19.610 
cash it in on Del Rio you could do some
angle<00:04:18.060> where<00:04:18.269> you<00:04:18.479> know<00:04:18.600> Jack<00:04:19.169> Swagger<00:04:19.470> and

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
angle where you know Jack Swagger and

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:20.960 
angle where you know Jack Swagger and
don't<00:04:19.829> worry<00:04:19.950> you'll<00:04:20.100> have<00:04:20.250> their<00:04:20.459> match<00:04:20.700> or

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
don't worry you'll have their match or

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:23.240 
don't worry you'll have their match or
they<00:04:21.030> have<00:04:21.150> a<00:04:21.180> confrontation<00:04:21.570> on<00:04:21.989> Raw<00:04:22.229> Del<00:04:23.010> Rio

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
they have a confrontation on Raw Del Rio

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:24.900 
they have a confrontation on Raw Del Rio
takes<00:04:23.610> out<00:04:23.820> Swagger<00:04:24.390> and<00:04:24.599> then

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:24.910 
takes out Swagger and then

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.350 
takes out Swagger and then
Ziggler<00:04:25.810> comes<00:04:26.170> out<00:04:26.410> and<00:04:26.680> finally<00:04:27.580> cashes<00:04:28.240> it

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:28.360 
Ziggler comes out and finally cashes it

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.210 
Ziggler comes out and finally cashes it
in<00:04:28.480> and<00:04:28.780> beats<00:04:29.020> Del<00:04:29.290> Rio<00:04:29.470> and<00:04:29.650> then<00:04:29.770> del<00:04:30.070> Rio

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
in and beats Del Rio and then del Rio

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.070 
in and beats Del Rio and then del Rio
tries<00:04:30.970> to<00:04:31.150> regain<00:04:31.510> the<00:04:31.690> title<00:04:31.870> at

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080 
tries to regain the title at

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.140 
tries to regain the title at
WrestleMania<00:04:32.680> I<00:04:32.890> think<00:04:33.550> that<00:04:33.580> that<00:04:33.700> that's

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:34.150 
WrestleMania I think that that that's

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:35.700 
WrestleMania I think that that that's
the<00:04:34.450> best<00:04:34.630> way<00:04:34.810> to<00:04:34.870> go<00:04:35.080> if<00:04:35.290> you're<00:04:35.440> not<00:04:35.500> going

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:35.710 
the best way to go if you're not going

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:37.740 
the best way to go if you're not going
to<00:04:35.800> have<00:04:35.890> swagger<00:04:36.430> involved<00:04:36.850> and<00:04:37.030> some<00:04:37.600> people

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:37.750 
to have swagger involved and some people

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:40.230 
to have swagger involved and some people
might<00:04:37.990> say<00:04:38.260> if<00:04:38.740> this<00:04:39.520> thing<00:04:39.790> was<00:04:39.910> swagger

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.240 
might say if this thing was swagger

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.940 
might say if this thing was swagger
didn't<00:04:40.420> even<00:04:40.600> happen<00:04:40.810> that<00:04:41.260> you<00:04:41.290> should<00:04:41.680> still

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:41.950 
didn't even happen that you should still

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:43.860 
didn't even happen that you should still
do<00:04:42.130> this<00:04:42.340> and<00:04:42.670> get<00:04:43.030> swagger<00:04:43.330> out<00:04:43.510> of<00:04:43.630> the<00:04:43.720> match

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:43.870 
do this and get swagger out of the match

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:46.650 
do this and get swagger out of the match
and<00:04:44.370> put<00:04:45.370> Ziggler<00:04:45.610> in<00:04:45.910> there<00:04:46.090> I'm<00:04:46.300> sure<00:04:46.540> a<00:04:46.570> lot

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:46.660 
and put Ziggler in there I'm sure a lot

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:49.040 
and put Ziggler in there I'm sure a lot
of<00:04:46.810> people<00:04:46.900> would<00:04:47.170> prefer<00:04:47.440> that<00:04:47.670> rather<00:04:48.670> than

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050 
of people would prefer that rather than

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:51.000 
of people would prefer that rather than

happened with with him being arrested

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:01.950 
happened with with him being arrested
because<00:04:59.890> I<00:05:00.040> was<00:05:00.160> really<00:05:00.640> enjoying<00:05:00.940> that<00:05:01.630> stuff
