00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:48.720
 on you 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.720
 the ball went through 1 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.200
 with it 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.140
 and round 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:07.550
 that has to do too 

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:31.879
 Game heavy storm 

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:38.309
 USD has risen 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:49.909
 arise from the game remove most of them to zero 

00:02:50.649 --> 00:02:53.649
 to reduce until the final game Zuges 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:56.989
 Dale McTavish the licks 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:58.869
 Begin FuPa 

00:02:58.869 --> 00:03:01.689
 Make 2400 people 

00:03:01.689 --> 00:03:04.689
 some drive Cacau by no means 

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:08.309
 Shalits was probably 

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:11.089
 no concrete compensation 

00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:14.089
 601 points for Steiner 

00:03:42.399 --> 00:03:45.229
 Fischer steps into consideration 

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:48.229
 not a word 

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:57.099
 that's double points 

00:03:59.979 --> 00:04:01.789
 by intention 

00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:04.579
 would have the train from Kelis in the first leg 

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:07.579
 to reduce to zero 

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:10.629
 until 2007 

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:12.529
 if you cover fees 

00:04:12.529 --> 00:04:13.289
 with their medals
