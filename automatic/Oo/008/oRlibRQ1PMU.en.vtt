00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
to make a huge star out of Bray Wyatt's

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.650 
to make a huge star out of Bray Wyatt's
if<00:02:50.930> he<00:02:51.350> wins<00:02:51.590> against<00:02:52.250> John<00:02:52.459> Cena<00:02:52.760> and<00:02:53.090> surely

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
if he wins against John Cena and surely

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.120 
if he wins against John Cena and surely
this<00:02:53.780> has<00:02:53.930> got<00:02:54.110> to<00:02:54.140> be<00:02:54.230> the<00:02:54.380> last<00:02:54.530> match<00:02:54.800> John

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
this has got to be the last match John

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:57.100 
this has got to be the last match John
Cena<00:02:55.400> has<00:02:55.640> against<00:02:55.970> Bray<00:02:56.209> Wyatt<00:02:56.239> hopefully

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110 
Cena has against Bray Wyatt hopefully

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:59.199 
Cena has against Bray Wyatt hopefully
and<00:02:57.650> that's<00:02:57.980> one<00:02:58.190> of<00:02:58.220> the<00:02:58.310> reasons<00:02:58.700> why<00:02:58.850> maybe

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
and that's one of the reasons why maybe

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:01.660 
and that's one of the reasons why maybe
it<00:02:59.450> might<00:02:59.690> not<00:03:00.050> be<00:03:00.110> a<00:03:00.560> win<00:03:00.950> for<00:03:00.980> Bray<00:03:01.370> Wyatt

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
it might not be a win for Bray Wyatt

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.420 
it might not be a win for Bray Wyatt
because<00:03:02.000> usually<00:03:02.209> a<00:03:02.450> few<00:03:02.810> ends<00:03:03.440> with<00:03:04.010> the<00:03:04.220> face

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
because usually a few ends with the face

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.759 
because usually a few ends with the face
winning<00:03:04.910> usually<00:03:05.540> usually<00:03:06.080> because<00:03:06.560> brought

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:06.769 
winning usually usually because brought

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:09.280 
winning usually usually because brought
laser<00:03:06.980> against<00:03:07.580> Triple<00:03:07.880> H<00:03:08.030> didn't<00:03:08.840> end<00:03:09.080> that

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
laser against Triple H didn't end that

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.290 
laser against Triple H didn't end that
way<00:03:09.530> so<00:03:10.040> maybe<00:03:10.220> they'll<00:03:10.459> do<00:03:10.700> that<00:03:10.910> but<00:03:11.180> if

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:11.300 
way so maybe they'll do that but if

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:13.870 
way so maybe they'll do that but if
usually<00:03:11.660> if<00:03:12.080> you<00:03:12.470> want<00:03:12.680> to<00:03:12.830> close<00:03:13.040> a<00:03:13.069> feud<00:03:13.489> the

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880 
usually if you want to close a feud the

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.850 
usually if you want to close a feud the
face<00:03:14.180> usually<00:03:14.870> wins<00:03:15.110> but<00:03:15.350> we're<00:03:15.470> already<00:03:15.709> in

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:15.860 
face usually wins but we're already in

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:18.130 
face usually wins but we're already in
the<00:03:15.980> third<00:03:16.190> match<00:03:16.489> if<00:03:16.819> Bray<00:03:17.450> Wyatt<00:03:17.480> versus

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140 
the third match if Bray Wyatt versus

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.380 
the third match if Bray Wyatt versus
John<00:03:18.380> Cena<00:03:18.680> so<00:03:19.250> if<00:03:19.459> they<00:03:19.579> give<00:03:19.730> John<00:03:19.940> Cena<00:03:20.180> the

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:20.390 
John Cena so if they give John Cena the

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:22.960 
John Cena so if they give John Cena the
the<00:03:20.870> win<00:03:21.019> here<00:03:21.320> the<00:03:21.650> feudal<00:03:22.010> ends<00:03:22.400> but<00:03:22.760> if<00:03:22.850> they

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
the win here the feudal ends but if they

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:24.550 
the win here the feudal ends but if they
give<00:03:23.150> great<00:03:23.299> why<00:03:23.570> the<00:03:23.630> win<00:03:23.930> here<00:03:24.170> maybe<00:03:24.410> the

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
give great why the win here maybe the

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.410 
give great why the win here maybe the
few<00:03:24.769> won't<00:03:24.980> be<00:03:25.070> it<00:03:25.160> won't<00:03:25.280> be<00:03:25.670> over<00:03:25.700> but<00:03:26.150> do<00:03:26.329> we

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
few won't be it won't be over but do we
