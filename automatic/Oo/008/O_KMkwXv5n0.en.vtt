00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:22.890
 Hi, I 'm going to show you how to make a 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:26.910
 cupcake confimÃ³ I'm going to use the number 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:30.060
 39 for the bottom of the cupcake the 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.460
 loves saiz and with a roller crushes him jce 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.700
 to make a plate 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:38.730
 then you cut the shape of the 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:41.340
 part of the cupcake below and I've 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:44.489
 added some brands with some lines 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:47.040
 deep so that it has texture 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:50.100
 let's use the brown number 7 for the 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:53.220
 base of the cupcake we knead and crush 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:56.370
 with the roller we will place the base 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:01:00.680
 turquoise underneath and so we can cut 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.680
 with a straight cutter 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:06.170
 I recommend that you put a pin in the 

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:09.220
 center of the two parts thus will remain 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.220
 better united 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:17.280
 with the help of a brush let's give it 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.280
 texture 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:28.140
 I sign efe number 205 with this color 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:32.100
 let's make the crap cake cream 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:36.320
 let's make a very long trickle and what 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.320
 let's wrap the cupcake 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.870
 Y 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:54.020
 we are going to put a pin with the head in the 

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:57.850
 top part so that you can hang it 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.850
 on a keychain or necklace 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:08.640
 green 53 yellow 16 red 24 with these 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:11.400
 three colors we are going to make a 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.110
 fine long churrito of each color and what 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.050
 cut with the help of a cutter 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.840
 little bit by little piece and have 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:21.300
 careful not to carry you and now we only 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:24.300
 it remains to place all the pieces 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:27.350
 randomly and then we put it 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.350
 in the oven 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:36.390
 once it's baked, we're going to give it 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:38.069
 a coat of varnish with more shine or 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.290
 less brightness and we're also going to 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:43.170
 prepare it with our chains for 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:46.200
 put it on necklace or keychain as more 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.970
 like it and so with this we will have 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.070
 finished 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:53.400
 I hope you liked it a lot
