to<00:00:47.880> this<00:00:48.030> flu<00:00:48.600> season<00:00:48.630> the<00:00:49.170> CDC<00:00:49.620> even<00:00:49.980> came<00:00:50.220> out

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
to this flu season the CDC even came out

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.690 
to this flu season the CDC even came out
and<00:00:50.610> they<00:00:50.700> said<00:00:50.940> that<00:00:51.150> well<00:00:51.680> 52%<00:00:52.680> of<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:52.950> virus

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:53.700 
and they said that well 52% of the virus

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.460 
and they said that well 52% of the virus
samples<00:00:54.090> that<00:00:54.180> we<00:00:54.300> collected<00:00:54.780> for<00:00:55.020> this<00:00:55.140> year

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:55.470 
samples that we collected for this year

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:58.310 
samples that we collected for this year
are<00:00:56.220> actually<00:00:56.640> different<00:00:57.300> than<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.870> strains

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
are actually different than the strains

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.190 
are actually different than the strains
that<00:00:58.500> we<00:00:58.590> actually<00:00:58.680> have<00:00:58.950> in<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.250> vaccine<00:00:59.850> so

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:00.200 
that we actually have in the vaccine so

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.319 
that we actually have in the vaccine so
not<00:01:01.200> really<00:01:01.440> that<00:01:01.560> effective<00:01:01.860> at<00:01:02.190> all<00:01:02.329> my

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
not really that effective at all my

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:04.880 
not really that effective at all my
personal<00:01:03.690> opinion<00:01:04.140> is<00:01:04.290> that<00:01:04.470> even<00:01:04.710> if<00:01:04.800> they

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
personal opinion is that even if they

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.530 
personal opinion is that even if they
did<00:01:05.040> match<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.460> strains<00:01:05.760> perfectly<00:01:06.330> there's

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
did match the strains perfectly there's

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.050 
did match the strains perfectly there's
so<00:01:06.690> many<00:01:06.950> accessory<00:01:07.950> ingredients<00:01:08.880> in<00:01:08.970> the

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
so many accessory ingredients in the

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.000 
so many accessory ingredients in the
vaccines<00:01:09.510> that<00:01:09.810> they<00:01:09.990> do<00:01:10.050> more<00:01:10.620> harm<00:01:10.680> than

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
vaccines that they do more harm than

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.140 
vaccines that they do more harm than
good<00:01:11.159> and<00:01:11.750> you<00:01:12.750> know<00:01:12.870> I'm<00:01:13.020> not<00:01:13.200> going<00:01:13.500> to<00:01:14.150> jump

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
good and you know I'm not going to jump

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.530

on<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.600> autism<00:01:16.050> train<00:01:16.530> and<00:01:16.830> start<00:01:17.580> debating

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
on the autism train and start debating

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.710 
on the autism train and start debating
that<00:01:18.720> I<00:01:18.990> think<00:01:19.620> vaccines<00:01:20.250> is<00:01:20.460> something<00:01:20.880> just

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
that I think vaccines is something just

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.480 
that I think vaccines is something just
as<00:01:21.960> polar<00:01:22.710> as<00:01:23.300> abortion<00:01:24.500> were<00:01:25.500> no<00:01:26.190> side

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
as polar as abortion were no side

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.060 
as polar as abortion were no side
whatever<00:01:26.909> when<00:01:27.290> but<00:01:28.290> I<00:01:28.320> do<00:01:28.470> want<00:01:28.710> to<00:01:28.740> call<00:01:28.920> to

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
whatever when but I do want to call to

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.920 
whatever when but I do want to call to
light<00:01:29.250> one<00:01:29.490> of<00:01:29.580> my<00:01:29.700> own<00:01:29.850> little<00:01:30.210> theories<00:01:30.659> here

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
light one of my own little theories here

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.510 
light one of my own little theories here
I<00:01:31.080> don't<00:01:31.920> have<00:01:32.010> any<00:01:32.510> specific<00:01:33.510> research<00:01:33.960> yet

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
I don't have any specific research yet

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.940 
I don't have any specific research yet
basis<00:01:35.520> on<00:01:35.700> it's<00:01:35.880> just<00:01:35.909> purely<00:01:36.299> theoretical

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
basis on it's just purely theoretical

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.500 
basis on it's just purely theoretical
but<00:01:37.950> if<00:01:38.040> there's<00:01:38.220> any<00:01:38.460> laboratories<00:01:39.210> that<00:01:39.330> do

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:39.510 
but if there's any laboratories that do

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:41.000 
but if there's any laboratories that do
some<00:01:39.690> testing<00:01:39.990> it'd<00:01:40.140> be<00:01:40.229> interesting<00:01:40.380> to<00:01:40.710> what

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:41.010 
some testing it'd be interesting to what

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:45.530 
some testing it'd be interesting to what
they<00:01:41.190> find<00:01:41.520> out<00:01:42.560> so<00:01:43.560> it<00:01:43.979> is<00:01:44.070> about<00:01:44.580> autoimmune

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
they find out so it is about autoimmune

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.130 
they find out so it is about autoimmune
disorders<00:01:46.229> what<00:01:47.220> is<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:47.729> target<00:01:48.360> of<00:01:48.659> vaccines

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
disorders what is the target of vaccines

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.690 
disorders what is the target of vaccines
in<00:01:49.260> the<00:01:49.320> first<00:01:49.560> place<00:01:49.770> it<00:01:49.950> is<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.250> immune

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
in the first place it is the immune

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.960 
in the first place it is the immune
system<00:01:51.240> so<00:01:51.900> is<00:01:52.229> it<00:01:52.350> that<00:01:52.500> crazy<00:01:53.040> to<00:01:53.430> think<00:01:53.670> that

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
system so is it that crazy to think that

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.060 
system so is it that crazy to think that
there<00:01:54.150> are<00:01:54.180> some<00:01:54.540> side<00:01:54.869> effects<00:01:55.260> to<00:01:56.040> our

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
there are some side effects to our

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.460 
there are some side effects to our
immune<00:01:56.400> system<00:01:56.939> caused<00:01:57.390> by<00:01:57.420> vaccines<00:01:58.170> that

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:58.470 
immune system caused by vaccines that

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.070 
immune system caused by vaccines that
were<00:01:58.590> not<00:01:58.770> accounting<00:01:59.340> for<00:01:59.369> and<00:01:59.909> so<00:02:00.330> I<00:02:00.659> wrote<00:02:01.049> a

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:01.080 
were not accounting for and so I wrote a

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.719

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
disorders are on the rise what do you

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.010 
disorders are on the rise what do you
think<00:02:10.289> of<00:02:10.410> it<00:02:10.500> as<00:02:10.770> nuts<00:02:11.130> eggs<00:02:11.490> fish<00:02:12.030> shellfish

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
think of it as nuts eggs fish shellfish

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.910 
think of it as nuts eggs fish shellfish
like

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
like

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.140 
like
insects<00:02:14.660> heck<00:02:15.660> even<00:02:15.810> seasonal<00:02:16.710> allergies<00:02:17.250> the

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
insects heck even seasonal allergies the

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.870 
insects heck even seasonal allergies the
CDC<00:02:18.600> said<00:02:18.870> that<00:02:19.050> food<00:02:19.800> allergies<00:02:20.040> are<00:02:20.370> almost

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
CDC said that food allergies are almost

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.580 
CDC said that food allergies are almost
20%<00:02:21.600> increased<00:02:22.530> from<00:02:22.740> 1997<00:02:23.490> to<00:02:23.640> 2007<00:02:24.270> and<00:02:24.600> it's

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
20% increased from 1997 to 2007 and it's

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.420 
20% increased from 1997 to 2007 and it's
probably<00:02:25.890> increased<00:02:26.490> even<00:02:26.880> more<00:02:27.090> since<00:02:27.690> then

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
probably increased even more since then

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.770 
probably increased even more since then
same<00:02:29.430> thing<00:02:29.610> with<00:02:29.760> food<00:02:29.940> allergies<00:02:30.450> there's<00:02:30.720> a

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
same thing with food allergies there's a

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.870 
same thing with food allergies there's a
lot<00:02:30.930> of<00:02:31.050> asthma<00:02:31.470> and<00:02:31.530> skin<00:02:31.860> allergies<00:02:32.340> on<00:02:32.610> the

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
lot of asthma and skin allergies on the

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.530 
lot of asthma and skin allergies on the
rise<00:02:33.060> and<00:02:33.330> most<00:02:33.930> interestingly<00:02:34.640> they<00:02:35.640> have

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
rise and most interestingly they have

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.500 
rise and most interestingly they have
between<00:02:37.020> 1997<00:02:37.890> and<00:02:38.190> 2007<00:02:40.459> hospitalizations

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
between 1997 and 2007 hospitalizations

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:43.910 
between 1997 and 2007 hospitalizations
with<00:02:42.510> regards<00:02:42.930> to<00:02:43.080> food<00:02:43.230> allergies<00:02:43.470> has

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
with regards to food allergies has

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.610 
with regards to food allergies has
increased<00:02:44.400> three<00:02:45.209> over<00:02:45.989> three<00:02:46.020> and<00:02:46.410> a<00:02:46.440> half

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
increased three over three and a half

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.680 
increased three over three and a half
times<00:02:47.780> so<00:02:48.780> I<00:02:48.810> wanted<00:02:49.080> to<00:02:49.170> look<00:02:49.860> into<00:02:50.100> this<00:02:50.370> and

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
times so I wanted to look into this and

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:53.630 
times so I wanted to look into this and
you<00:02:51.690> know<00:02:51.810> it's<00:02:52.050> it's<00:02:52.680> not<00:02:52.890> empirical<00:02:53.489> base

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
you know it's it's not empirical base

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.790 
you know it's it's not empirical base
it's<00:02:53.970> just<00:02:54.209> me<00:02:54.750> observing<00:02:55.670> some<00:02:56.670> trends<00:02:57.180> and

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:57.800 
it's just me observing some trends and

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:02.300 
it's just me observing some trends and
if<00:02:58.800> you<00:02:59.010> look<00:02:59.250> at<00:02:59.489> a<00:03:00.110> common<00:03:01.110> component<00:03:01.590> with<00:03:02.280> a

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
if you look at a common component with a

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.500 
if you look at a common component with a
lot<00:03:02.580> of<00:03:02.670> these<00:03:02.760> vaccines<00:03:03.560> there<00:03:04.560> is<00:03:04.860> an

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
lot of these vaccines there is an

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.900 
lot of these vaccines there is an
adjuvant<00:03:06.890> some<00:03:07.890> of<00:03:07.980> them<00:03:08.100> have<00:03:08.310> aluminum

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
adjuvant some of them have aluminum

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.110 
adjuvant some of them have aluminum
adjutants<00:03:09.510> and<00:03:09.660> so<00:03:09.750> what<00:03:10.170> is<00:03:10.320> an<00:03:10.530> adjuvant

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
adjutants and so what is an adjuvant

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.900 
adjutants and so what is an adjuvant
well<00:03:12.350> most<00:03:13.350> people<00:03:13.650> think<00:03:13.800> of<00:03:14.010> vaccines<00:03:14.550> as

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
well most people think of vaccines as

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.080 
well most people think of vaccines as
just<00:03:15.780> the<00:03:16.050> virus<00:03:16.560> antigen<00:03:17.220> being<00:03:17.700> injected

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
just the virus antigen being injected

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.560 
just the virus antigen being injected
into<00:03:18.480> the<00:03:18.570> body<00:03:18.720> and<00:03:19.049> that<00:03:19.650> the<00:03:19.860> body<00:03:20.570> responds

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
into the body and that the body responds

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:24.039 
into the body and that the body responds
to<00:03:21.750> that<00:03:22.110> antigen<00:03:22.709> and<00:03:22.860> makes<00:03:23.010> antibodies

00:03:24.039 --> 00:03:24.049 
to that antigen and makes antibodies

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:27.530 
to that antigen and makes antibodies
well<00:03:25.049> in<00:03:25.410> a<00:03:25.829> reality<00:03:26.400> the<00:03:26.940> body<00:03:27.150> doesn't

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
well in a reality the body doesn't

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.569 
well in a reality the body doesn't
actually<00:03:27.660> respond<00:03:28.230> that<00:03:28.410> way<00:03:28.620> it<00:03:28.920> needs<00:03:29.400> a

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:29.579 
actually respond that way it needs a

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:30.860 
actually respond that way it needs a
little<00:03:29.700> bit<00:03:29.820> of<00:03:30.000> coaching<00:03:30.239> and<00:03:30.540> need<00:03:30.690> some

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
little bit of coaching and need some

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.410 
little bit of coaching and need some
help<00:03:31.140> and<00:03:31.290> so<00:03:32.250> what<00:03:32.459> they<00:03:32.579> put<00:03:32.820> is<00:03:33.060> this

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
help and so what they put is this

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.630 
help and so what they put is this
adjuvant<00:03:34.320> in<00:03:34.680> there<00:03:34.860> specifically<00:03:35.430> in

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
adjuvant in there specifically in

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.670 
adjuvant in there specifically in
aluminum<00:03:36.150> and<00:03:36.329> Japan<00:03:36.660> and<00:03:37.079> what<00:03:37.200> it<00:03:37.290> does<00:03:37.470> is

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
aluminum and Japan and what it does is

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.740 
aluminum and Japan and what it does is
it<00:03:37.829> hyper<00:03:38.250> stimulates<00:03:38.940> the<00:03:39.150> body's<00:03:39.450> immune

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
it hyper stimulates the body's immune

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.880 
it hyper stimulates the body's immune
system<00:03:40.280> to<00:03:41.280> the<00:03:41.910> point<00:03:41.940> of<00:03:42.420> where<00:03:42.750> you<00:03:43.530> know<00:03:43.650> it

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
system to the point of where you know it

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.310 
system to the point of where you know it
can<00:03:44.459> recognize<00:03:44.730> the<00:03:45.480> antigens<00:03:46.019> that<00:03:46.110> have

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:46.320 
can recognize the antigens that have

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.920 
can recognize the antigens that have
been<00:03:46.500> injected<00:03:47.160> into<00:03:47.250> the<00:03:47.459> body<00:03:47.640> and<00:03:48.060> so<00:03:48.720> if

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
been injected into the body and so if

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.140 
been injected into the body and so if
you<00:03:49.049> think<00:03:49.230> of<00:03:49.380> these<00:03:49.579> adjutants<00:03:50.579> hyper

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
you think of these adjutants hyper

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.780 
you think of these adjutants hyper
stimulating<00:03:51.959> the<00:03:52.079> immune<00:03:52.170> system<00:03:52.769> and<00:03:52.980> you

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
stimulating the immune system and you

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.620 
stimulating the immune system and you
think<00:03:54.120> about<00:03:54.269> the<00:03:55.519> increase<00:03:56.519> of<00:03:56.790> vaccines

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
think about the increase of vaccines

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:01.569 
think about the increase of vaccines
that<00:03:58.440> we've<00:03:58.680> had<00:03:58.920> I<00:03:58.950> mean<00:03:59.250> from<00:03:59.489> from<00:04:00.110> 1980<00:04:01.110> to

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:01.579 
that we've had I mean from from 1980 to

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:05.000 
that we've had I mean from from 1980 to
2012<00:04:02.579> or<00:04:03.239> even<00:04:03.810> to<00:04:03.900> current<00:04:04.230> day<00:04:04.380> there's<00:04:04.769> just

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 
2012 or even to current day there's just

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.580 
2012 or even to current day there's just
an<00:04:05.130> enormous<00:04:05.370> amount<00:04:05.579> of<00:04:06.260> vaccines<00:04:07.260> in<00:04:07.470> the

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
an enormous amount of vaccines in the

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:09.050 
an enormous amount of vaccines in the
schedule<00:04:07.980> that<00:04:08.100> we<00:04:08.160> never<00:04:08.459> had<00:04:08.670> before<00:04:08.820> and

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
schedule that we never had before and

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.640 
schedule that we never had before and
and<00:04:09.799> oddly<00:04:10.799> enough<00:04:11.040> you're<00:04:12.030> seeing<00:04:12.390> kids<00:04:12.870> come

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
and oddly enough you're seeing kids come

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:14.780 
and oddly enough you're seeing kids come
out<00:04:13.680> with<00:04:14.010> all<00:04:14.310> these<00:04:14.519> allergies

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
out with all these allergies

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:16.789 
out with all these allergies
specifically<00:04:15.780> in<00:04:15.930> the<00:04:16.019> school's<00:04:16.320> peanut

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 
specifically in the school's peanut

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:18.860 
specifically in the school's peanut
allergies<00:04:17.340> and<00:04:17.579> all<00:04:17.910> these<00:04:18.090> things<00:04:18.359> and<00:04:18.479> so<00:04:18.630> is

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
allergies and all these things and so is

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:21.390 
allergies and all these things and so is
it<00:04:19.260> that<00:04:19.410> crazy<00:04:19.799> to<00:04:20.130> think

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400 
it that crazy to think

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.390 
it that crazy to think
or<00:04:22.300> hyper<00:04:22.680> stimulating<00:04:23.680> the<00:04:23.800> immune<00:04:23.889> system

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:24.400 
or hyper stimulating the immune system

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:25.680 
or hyper stimulating the immune system
with<00:04:24.550> these<00:04:24.669> add<00:04:24.880> Japan's<00:04:25.180> with<00:04:25.360> all<00:04:25.540> these

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:25.690 
with these add Japan's with all these

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:27.980 
with these add Japan's with all these
extra<00:04:26.020> vaccines<00:04:26.530> that<00:04:26.740> kids<00:04:26.979> are<00:04:27.100> getting<00:04:27.220> and

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:27.990 
extra vaccines that kids are getting and

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:30.450 
extra vaccines that kids are getting and
could<00:04:28.990> it<00:04:29.110> be<00:04:29.260> hyper<00:04:29.530> stimulating<00:04:30.250> the<00:04:30.370> immune

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460 
could it be hyper stimulating the immune

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:32.480 
could it be hyper stimulating the immune
system<00:04:30.970> to<00:04:31.000> a<00:04:31.210> point<00:04:31.479> of<00:04:31.660> where<00:04:31.840> it<00:04:32.110> is

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490 
system to a point of where it is

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:35.879 
system to a point of where it is
mistakingly<00:04:34.080> recognizing<00:04:35.080> things<00:04:35.410> that<00:04:35.710> are

00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:35.889 
mistakingly recognizing things that are

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:39.030 
mistakingly recognizing things that are
not<00:04:36.100> the<00:04:36.479> vaccine<00:04:37.479> antigen<00:04:38.110> maybe<00:04:38.770> it's

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:39.040 
not the vaccine antigen maybe it's

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:42.000 
not the vaccine antigen maybe it's
looking<00:04:39.430> at<00:04:39.750> things<00:04:40.750> like<00:04:40.840> peanuts<00:04:41.470> and<00:04:41.710> latex

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:42.010 
looking at things like peanuts and latex

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:44.450 
looking at things like peanuts and latex
and<00:04:42.220> all<00:04:42.340> these<00:04:42.490> other<00:04:42.699> things<00:04:42.760> that<00:04:43.090> are<00:04:43.210> now

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460 
and all these other things that are now

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:48.360 
and all these other things that are now
people<00:04:45.460> are<00:04:45.699> being<00:04:45.850> sensitized<00:04:46.630> to<00:04:47.050> so<00:04:48.040> I

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:48.370 
people are being sensitized to so I

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:50.250 
people are being sensitized to so I
think<00:04:48.790> this<00:04:49.030> is<00:04:49.150> a<00:04:49.180> real<00:04:49.419> interesting<00:04:49.630> point

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:50.260 
think this is a real interesting point

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.990 
think this is a real interesting point
that<00:04:50.350> definitely<00:04:51.280> demands<00:04:51.699> further<00:04:52.660> research

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 
that definitely demands further research

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.580 
that definitely demands further research
you<00:04:55.000> know<00:04:55.120> the<00:04:55.330> thing<00:04:55.690> about<00:04:55.720> this<00:04:56.110> is<00:04:56.380> it's

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:56.590 
you know the thing about this is it's

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:59.600 
you know the thing about this is it's
it's<00:04:56.979> very<00:04:57.510> difficult<00:04:58.510> to<00:04:58.840> see<00:04:59.139> long-term

00:04:59.600 --> 00:04:59.610 
it's very difficult to see long-term

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:02.570 
it's very difficult to see long-term
trends<00:05:00.610> you<00:05:00.729> know<00:05:00.760> it's<00:05:01.030> it's<00:05:01.780> not<00:05:02.050> as

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.580 
trends you know it's it's not as

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:06.060 
trends you know it's it's not as
apparent<00:05:03.580> as<00:05:03.960> some<00:05:04.960> of<00:05:05.050> these<00:05:05.139> adverse<00:05:05.620> events

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:06.070 
apparent as some of these adverse events

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:07.740 
apparent as some of these adverse events
where<00:05:06.250> you<00:05:06.340> get<00:05:06.490> a<00:05:06.520> vaccine<00:05:06.910> and<00:05:07.210> then<00:05:07.360> the<00:05:07.570> kid

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:07.750 
where you get a vaccine and then the kid

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:09.659 
where you get a vaccine and then the kid
starts<00:05:08.050> convulsing<00:05:08.260> I<00:05:08.740> mean<00:05:08.889> this<00:05:08.979> this<00:05:09.460> is

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:09.669 
starts convulsing I mean this this is

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:12.960 
starts convulsing I mean this this is
more<00:05:09.880> of<00:05:09.970> a<00:05:10.030> long-term<00:05:10.570> study<00:05:11.310> and<00:05:12.310> you<00:05:12.760> also

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:12.970 
more of a long-term study and you also

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:14.730 
more of a long-term study and you also
don't<00:05:13.240> have<00:05:13.360> a<00:05:13.479> really<00:05:13.750> good<00:05:13.900> control<00:05:14.289> and

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:14.740 
don't have a really good control and

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:16.590 
don't have a really good control and
there's<00:05:15.039> not<00:05:15.250> a<00:05:15.280> lot<00:05:15.580> of<00:05:15.729> people<00:05:16.449> out<00:05:16.570> there

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:16.600 
there's not a lot of people out there

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.750 
there's not a lot of people out there
that<00:05:16.990> are<00:05:17.169> refusing<00:05:17.620> the<00:05:17.949> vaccines<00:05:18.430> to

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:18.760 
that are refusing the vaccines to

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:21.000 
that are refusing the vaccines to

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:21.010 
compare to is as a as an absolute

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:25.440 
compare to is as a as an absolute
negative<00:05:21.310> control<00:05:21.910> but<00:05:22.710> anyways<00:05:23.940> I<00:05:24.940> just

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:25.450 
negative control but anyways I just

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:28.140 
negative control but anyways I just
thought<00:05:25.870> that<00:05:26.169> this<00:05:27.099> was<00:05:27.310> just<00:05:27.340> awesome<00:05:27.970> just

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:28.150 
thought that this was just awesome just

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:32.610 
thought that this was just awesome just
absolute<00:05:29.020> vaccine<00:05:29.919> propaganda<00:05:30.760> and<00:05:31.620> don't

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:32.620 
absolute vaccine propaganda and don't

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:35.339 
absolute vaccine propaganda and don't
worry<00:05:32.800> you'll<00:05:33.460> love<00:05:33.490> it<00:05:33.960> thanks<00:05:34.960> for<00:05:35.080> watching
