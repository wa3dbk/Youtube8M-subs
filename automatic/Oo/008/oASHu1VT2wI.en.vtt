00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
knife in detail I have the frame rate

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.160 
knife in detail I have the frame rate
all<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:35.850> way<00:00:35.940> up<00:00:36.030> to<00:00:36.149> 640<00:00:39.020> that's<00:00:40.020> not

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
all the way up to 640 that's not

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.660 
all the way up to 640 that's not
actually<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:40.620> frame<00:00:40.890> rate<00:00:41.100> that's<00:00:41.370> just<00:00:41.579> the

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
actually the frame rate that's just the

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:42.610 
actually the frame rate that's just the
shutter<00:00:41.910> speed

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:42.620 
shutter speed

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.220 
shutter speed
it's<00:00:43.620> normally<00:00:44.040> at<00:00:44.190> 30<00:00:44.750> it's<00:00:45.750> so<00:00:45.930> bright<00:00:46.200> out

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
it on concrete it's the nice stone

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:19.710 
it on concrete it's the nice stone
washing<00:01:08.450> the<00:01:09.450> useless<00:01:09.900> rotoblock

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:19.720 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:30.120 

it's<00:01:20.110> the<00:01:20.290> blade

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.130 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.660 

there's<00:01:31.130> the<00:01:31.280> lockup<00:01:31.730> which<00:01:33.520> actually<00:01:34.520> got

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
there's the lockup which actually got

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.420 
there's the lockup which actually got
more<00:01:34.940> solid<00:01:35.450> as<00:01:35.600> it<00:01:35.660> worn<00:01:36.200> in<00:01:36.410> it<00:01:36.920> has<00:01:37.130> less

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:37.430 
more solid as it worn in it has less

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.170 
more solid as it worn in it has less
lockup<00:01:37.970> now<00:01:38.180> than<00:01:38.480> it<00:01:38.570> did<00:01:38.690> or<00:01:39.470> less<00:01:40.180> movement

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:41.180 
lockup now than it did or less movement

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.120 
lockup now than it did or less movement
in<00:01:41.540> the<00:01:41.630> lock<00:01:41.810> than<00:01:42.140> when<00:01:42.260> it<00:01:42.380> did<00:01:42.560> when<00:01:42.980> it<00:01:43.070> was

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
in the lock than when it did when it was

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:49.480 
in the lock than when it did when it was
new<00:01:43.220> so<00:01:43.700> that's<00:01:44.570> good<00:01:47.260> the<00:01:48.260> g10<00:01:48.680> is<00:01:48.890> nice<00:01:49.160> and

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
new so that's good the g10 is nice and

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.820 
new so that's good the g10 is nice and
grippy<00:01:49.910> it's<00:01:50.480> a<00:01:50.570> nice<00:01:50.810> color<00:01:51.170> green

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:51.830 
grippy it's a nice color green

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:53.830 
grippy it's a nice color green
hopefully<00:01:52.790> it's<00:01:52.940> representing<00:01:53.510> that<00:01:53.630> color

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
hopefully it's representing that color

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:59.260 
hopefully it's representing that color
nicely<00:01:57.160> it's<00:01:58.160> overall<00:01:58.520> just<00:01:58.700> a<00:01:58.850> really

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
nicely it's overall just a really

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.220 
nicely it's overall just a really
well-built<00:01:59.690> knife<00:02:00.020> it's<00:02:00.920> not<00:02:01.190> the<00:02:01.370> prettiest

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:02.230 
well-built knife it's not the prettiest

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:05.080 
well-built knife it's not the prettiest
sure<00:02:03.230> the<00:02:03.440> fit<00:02:03.620> finish<00:02:03.920> isn't<00:02:04.340> like<00:02:04.520> a<00:02:04.550> custom

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
sure the fit finish isn't like a custom

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:19.619 
sure the fit finish isn't like a custom
but<00:02:05.210> it's<00:02:05.440> $175<00:02:06.440> now<00:02:06.850> what<00:02:07.850> can<00:02:08.060> you<00:02:08.119> expect

00:02:19.619 --> 00:02:19.629 

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:25.420
