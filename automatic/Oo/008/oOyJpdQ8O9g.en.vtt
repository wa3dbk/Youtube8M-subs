00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:05.339
 OK, a multi-generation fast field test. 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.960
 As you can see that we have a waypoint to join, we will use to navigate to that waypoint 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.530
 There is no direction screen for internet connection. 

00:00:13.529 --> 00:00:13.779
 [Rear] 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:19.208
 It's off to the left a little, 77 meters 

00:00:22.208 --> 00:00:26.960
 [Swim] 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.960
 This is getting closer and closer 

00:01:00.528 --> 00:01:05.528
 Cross the road 

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:23.149
 [Color bars get wider and wider, the more we get] 

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:27.640
 And we are here 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:34.640
 And we are here 

00:01:34.959 --> 00:01:39.459
 Such as photos 

00:01:39.459 --> 00:01:46.459
 OK, while we are here, let's see if there are any caches near any geocaches. 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:54.090
 So after adding the tab, the site content, I have logged in 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.150
 It should be possible to pull up the geocache page. 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:09.150
 Yes, it has a geotag and you can see the location of the waypoint at the bottom. 

00:02:09.938 --> 00:02:10.199
 Not the focus of attention. 

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:17.199
 Ok, add a little. Now let's go to that. 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:25.300
 The distance of 188 meters will definitely be in front. Again, if you look closely, you can see 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.880
 Purple, corresponding to the purple on the bar, its choice so that its display 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:32.229
 In the compass. It's this way. 

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:39.229
 [wind noise] 

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:49.629
 The future, and the right point. 

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:25.199
 Going to the right, moving forward, we are very close, 

00:03:24.848 --> 00:03:27.039
 We are at a distance of 41 meters. 

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:34.039
 You can see that it is getting bigger and bigger. 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:36.950
 This bridge is somewhere here. 

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:52.949
 It must be somewhere, so now I have to find it.
