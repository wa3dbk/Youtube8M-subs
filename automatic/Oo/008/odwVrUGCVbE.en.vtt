00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.450
 sensational semi-permanent polish 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.980
 so I bought them at crossroads I 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.990
 you will put everything on the blog 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.969
 and I chose the color ping 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.340
 crumples so that's pretty pale pink 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.300
 super pretty really I love it so I 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.369
 will show you how I 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.380
 apply it for a super result 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.859
 own super nice so if that you 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.810
 interested 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.550
 stay connected and do not forget to 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.609
 So you subscribe it presents the 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.980
 like that you have a led lamp you 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.710
 have a gel primeur a cottage base and top 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.329
 coat cleaner ngo varnish 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.180
 of course as well as a hymn of 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.800
 sticks and small wipes without 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.410
 fiber actually for past surplus when 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.180
 we clean so go here I go 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.920
 show you all that 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.329
 firstly we start with the anthem is 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.730
 long all the surface of the ngo for 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.680
 to be able to adhere the varnish 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.960
 that's really going to allow you to 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.969
 to hold long polish so on 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.340
 the box if it is written that the varnish 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.440
 lasts two weeks with the brilliant that 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.809
 five years for two weeks me it's 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.610
 stayed really bright intensely but 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.840
 the worm does not start from the end 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.549
 a week and a half but frankly 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.900
 I'm not disappointed at all because it's 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.000
 it's really good 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.040
 then you take a little wipe 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.040
 and the little fertilizer cleaner you 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.840
 rub well long to clean and 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.659
 actually removed nail residues 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.610
 fuck we'll say and then we protect 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.140
 long with the gene prime hours but 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.340
 this step I do not have movie is so there 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.430
 I show you directly the application 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.869
 gel base and top coat so do well 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.180
 be careful not to touch 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.369
 cuticles and do not forget to 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.770
 to pass a last layer after 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.920
 long for really well fortified and 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.180
 to apply the color until there 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.490
 as I put myself everywhere I 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.720
 removed the gel with a small boat is 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.920
 because if not when you put under 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.259
 the language 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.040
 you feel satrapi chalco so that's it 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.810
 30 seconds 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.640
 then I apply to color so 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.900
 the same I am very close to kits 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.310
 but never touch them 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:59.189
 because otherwise it'll make you a 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.830
 little by little a pile up a little 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:03.960
 hard so that's it I really wanted or 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.610
 well on the nail and again I 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.280
 spend a last layer really at 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.289
 long ends that's how 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.400
 fortified power make sure that it 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.670
 better than they have no hitch 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.670
 etc. 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:22.099
 then I remove the batteries where 

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:23.450
 I passed and we put all this under the 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:25.489
 uv lamp for a minute 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.930
 so I advise you pass is 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:28.310
 also advised in the kit to do 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.159
 a second layer so the same 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:33.439
 one more minute and then we're done 

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:34.879
 all that with the gene top coat so that's 

00:02:33.439 --> 00:02:36.950
 the same you used at the beginning 

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:38.450
 we do not forget to put 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.310
 a last layer after long 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:43.159
 to really see the nail polish 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:47.719
 and we do not put another 30 seconds 

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:48.950
 the lamp uv then we take a 

00:02:47.719 --> 00:02:50.900
 final I have everything I used 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.459
 always the same and the cleaner for one 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.709
 rubs well to remove all 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:56.959
 gel residues and your angles are 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:59.000
 finished so year and even more scared 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:00.799
 a single business hitch your nails 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.090
 are perfect for two weeks the 

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:04.489
 first it lasted a week and a half 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:06.139
 but really they are perfect it moves 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:07.280
 not to the color is super pretty her 

00:03:06.139 --> 00:03:09.980
 brilliant as if you came from 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.329
 apply it me I was super happy 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.430
 and really I think it's a 

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:14.659
 investment that's worth it so if 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.579
