lead the back oh yeah that's oh and
that's<00:02:30.870> the<00:02:31.019> very<00:02:31.049> bottom<00:02:32.060> you<00:02:33.060> see<00:02:33.469> there<00:02:34.469> is

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:35.269 
that's the very bottom you see there is

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:41.270 
that's the very bottom you see there is
bedrock<00:02:36.530> there's<00:02:37.530> diamond<00:02:39.260> um<00:02:40.260> I<00:02:40.859> tried

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
bedrock there's diamond um I tried

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.309 
bedrock there's diamond um I tried
getting<00:02:41.670> a<00:02:41.730> texture<00:02:42.090> pack<00:02:42.299> with<00:02:42.870> clear<00:02:43.200> the

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
getting a texture pack with clear the

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:45.979 
getting a texture pack with clear the
last<00:02:43.530> it<00:02:43.769> would<00:02:43.859> be<00:02:43.950> easier<00:02:44.280> to<00:02:44.310> see<00:02:44.689> but<00:02:45.689> that

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
last it would be easier to see but that

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:50.210 
last it would be easier to see but that
then<00:02:46.139> work<00:02:46.290> out<00:02:46.909> so<00:02:47.909> I<00:02:47.939> just<00:02:48.180> uh<00:02:48.629> fish<00:02:49.049> if<00:02:49.379> I

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
then work out so I just uh fish if I

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.039 
then work out so I just uh fish if I
were<00:02:50.370> you<00:02:50.549> I<00:02:50.579> would<00:02:50.939> get<00:02:51.090> the<00:02:51.269> clear<00:02:51.480> glass<00:02:51.780> or

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049 
were you I would get the clear glass or

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:54.830 
were you I would get the clear glass or
when<00:02:52.319> the<00:02:52.470> noi<00:02:52.650> you<00:02:52.829> guys<00:02:52.980> are<00:02:53.159> building<00:02:53.340> and<00:02:53.840> I

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
when the noi you guys are building and I

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.959 
when the noi you guys are building and I
think<00:02:55.109> that<00:02:55.290> would<00:02:55.500> tea<00:02:56.489> trees<00:02:56.760> will<00:02:56.939> be

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:56.969 
think that would tea trees will be

00:02:56.969 --> 00:03:02.659 
think that would tea trees will be
enough<00:02:57.299> for<00:02:57.840> points<00:02:58.760> because<00:02:59.760> of<00:03:00.030> the<00:03:01.669> since

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:02.669 
enough for points because of the since

00:03:02.669 --> 00:03:04.190 
enough for points because of the since
