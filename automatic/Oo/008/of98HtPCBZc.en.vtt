ring<00:00:00.329> already<00:00:00.900> one<00:00:01.290> tenth<00:00:01.530> over<00:00:01.829> here<00:00:09.800> looking

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
ring already one tenth over here looking

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:20.830 
ring already one tenth over here looking
at<00:00:10.920> that<00:00:15.560> that's<00:00:16.560> one<00:00:16.859> half<00:00:17.190> tenths<00:00:19.820> it's

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:20.840 
at that that's one half tenths it's

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:27.109 
at that that's one half tenths it's
probably<00:00:21.840> too<00:00:22.080> there<00:00:24.859> you<00:00:25.859> know<00:00:26.039> and<00:00:26.310> it

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
probably too there you know and it

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:36.650 
probably too there you know and it
remains<00:00:27.480> it<00:00:27.660> to<00:00:28.099> come<00:00:29.099> back<00:00:29.130> a<00:00:29.340> little<00:00:29.460> bit<00:00:29.929> too

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.770 

and<00:00:37.290> I<00:00:37.470> cannot<00:00:37.890> see<00:00:38.489> it<00:00:39.090> just<00:00:39.270> dips<00:00:39.540> at<00:00:39.690> the

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
and I cannot see it just dips at the

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:48.350 
and I cannot see it just dips at the
bottom<00:00:40.079> there<00:00:41.270> so<00:00:45.440> there's<00:00:46.440> no<00:00:46.650> obvious<00:00:47.360> bump

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
bottom there so there's no obvious bump

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.970 
bottom there so there's no obvious bump
just<00:00:49.170> check<00:00:49.470> outside<00:00:51.200> over<00:00:52.200> your<00:00:52.440> slow<00:00:52.620> spot

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
just check outside over your slow spot

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.030 
just check outside over your slow spot
in<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.220> middle<00:00:53.340> of<00:00:53.489> level<00:00:53.879> but<00:00:54.470> it<00:00:55.470> seems<00:00:55.860> to

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:56.040 
in the middle of level but it seems to

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:03.020 
in the middle of level but it seems to
want<00:00:56.220> to<00:00:56.280> spin<00:00:57.350> um<00:00:59.239> join<00:01:00.239> 0<00:01:00.570> it<00:01:01.790> let's<00:01:02.790> go<00:01:02.970> the

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
want to spin um join 0 it let's go the

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:14.160 
want to spin um join 0 it let's go the
wrong<00:01:03.210> way<00:01:06.710> canter<00:01:07.710> intuitive

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.020 

and<00:01:14.799> you<00:01:14.890> know<00:01:15.009> much<00:01:15.159> why<00:01:15.369> you<00:01:15.430> got<00:01:15.640> the<00:01:15.759> stand

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.030 
and you know much why you got the stand

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:17.609 
and you know much why you got the stand
set<00:01:16.240> up<00:01:16.360> as<00:01:16.509> to<00:01:16.659> which<00:01:16.810> way<00:01:16.990> you<00:01:17.049> gotta<00:01:17.229> turn<00:01:17.439> it

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:17.619 
set up as to which way you gotta turn it

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:30.330 
set up as to which way you gotta turn it
I<00:01:19.229> cannot<00:01:20.229> see

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:37.550 

that<00:01:30.939> obvious<00:01:32.880> lump<00:01:33.880> in<00:01:34.060> the<00:01:34.179> middle<00:01:34.210> here

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:47.050 

whoa<00:01:38.560> just<00:01:39.130> come<00:01:39.340> off<00:01:42.659> um

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:52.450 

and<00:01:47.869> yet<00:01:48.520> it<00:01:49.520> seems<00:01:49.790> to<00:01:49.939> me<00:01:50.710> if<00:01:51.710> we<00:01:51.950> move<00:01:52.189> these

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 
and yet it seems to me if we move these

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.609 
and yet it seems to me if we move these
did<00:01:53.149> took<00:01:53.299> the<00:01:53.420> video<00:01:53.570> aliens<00:01:54.020> really<00:01:54.290> as<00:01:54.590> a

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:54.619 
did took the video aliens really as a

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:57.910 
did took the video aliens really as a
technology<00:01:55.159> and<00:01:55.990> it<00:01:56.990> just<00:01:57.229> seems<00:01:57.439> to<00:01:57.560> float

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
technology and it just seems to float

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:03.219 
technology and it just seems to float
just<00:01:58.579> a<00:01:58.700> little<00:01:58.820> bit<00:02:00.220> no<00:02:01.220> I<00:02:01.579> just<00:02:02.229> another

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
just a little bit no I just another

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:09.880 
just a little bit no I just another
thing<00:02:03.380> I<00:02:03.530> tried<00:02:03.830> was<00:02:04.100> um<00:02:05.890> to<00:02:07.360> be<00:02:08.360> able<00:02:08.450> to<00:02:08.890> yeah

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
thing I tried was um to be able to yeah

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.040 
thing I tried was um to be able to yeah
this<00:02:10.039> it's<00:02:10.280> very<00:02:10.489> hard<00:02:10.700> to<00:02:10.759> do<00:02:10.970> because<00:02:11.150> of<00:02:11.540> the

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
this it's very hard to do because of the

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:19.150 
this it's very hard to do because of the
surface<00:02:12.470> finish<00:02:12.769> is<00:02:13.120> um<00:02:16.090> like<00:02:17.090> a<00:02:17.950> about<00:02:18.950> tone

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
surface finish is um like a about tone

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:25.030 
surface finish is um like a about tone
finish<00:02:21.100> where<00:02:22.100> I<00:02:22.130> can<00:02:23.470> when<00:02:24.470> push<00:02:24.709> any<00:02:24.890> other

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
finish where I can when push any other

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.530 
finish where I can when push any other
in<00:02:25.190> the<00:02:25.220> level<00:02:26.470> whether<00:02:27.470> i<00:02:27.560> can<00:02:27.709> see<00:02:28.190> a<00:02:28.540> rock

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
in the level whether i can see a rock

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:36.430 
in the level whether i can see a rock
but<00:02:33.310> there<00:02:34.310> is<00:02:34.459> a<00:02:34.489> the<00:02:35.299> slaughters<00:02:35.780> jitter<00:02:36.140> but

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
but there is a the slaughters jitter but

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:37.809 
but there is a the slaughters jitter but
I<00:02:36.470> think<00:02:36.830> it's<00:02:37.040> more<00:02:37.130> to<00:02:37.489> do<00:02:37.580> with<00:02:37.670> the<00:02:37.790> fact

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:37.819 
I think it's more to do with the fact

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:41.320 
I think it's more to do with the fact
that<00:02:38.120> I'm<00:02:39.069> actually<00:02:40.069> moving<00:02:40.700> the<00:02:41.000> level

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
that I'm actually moving the level

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.400 
that I'm actually moving the level
physically<00:02:41.870> obviously<00:02:42.680> those<00:02:43.780> the<00:02:44.780> pumps<00:02:45.230> and

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
physically obviously those the pumps and

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:54.039 
physically obviously those the pumps and
bumps<00:02:46.010> and<00:02:46.640> lumps<00:02:46.970> on<00:02:47.209> them<00:02:49.870> hammertone<00:02:53.049> make

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:54.049 
bumps and lumps on them hammertone make

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:57.520 
bumps and lumps on them hammertone make
it<00:02:54.200> move<00:02:54.350> all<00:02:54.560> over<00:02:54.590> the<00:02:54.890> place<00:02:55.130> so<00:02:55.430> I<00:02:56.530> really

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
it move all over the place so I really

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:05.380 
it move all over the place so I really
can't<00:02:57.829> see<00:02:59.170> any<00:03:01.569> rock<00:03:02.569> and<00:03:03.310> yet<00:03:04.310> like<00:03:04.760> I<00:03:04.790> say<00:03:05.150> it

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
can't see any rock and yet like I say it

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:10.449 
can't see any rock and yet like I say it
just<00:03:05.569> feels<00:03:05.870> like<00:03:06.049> it's<00:03:08.890> just<00:03:09.890> floating<00:03:10.220> a

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:10.459 
just feels like it's just floating a

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:16.140 
just feels like it's just floating a
little<00:03:10.700> bit<00:03:10.819> on<00:03:11.450> the<00:03:11.720> on<00:03:11.989> the<00:03:12.049> plate<00:03:12.650> so<00:03:13.239> love<00:03:14.239> a

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
little bit on the on the plate so love a

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:21.390 
little bit on the on the plate so love a
bit<00:03:17.150> of<00:03:17.180> a<00:03:17.510> no<00:03:18.470> idea<00:03:18.769> of<00:03:18.980> what<00:03:19.190> um<00:03:19.489> what<00:03:19.989> I'm

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
bit of a no idea of what um what I'm

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.710 
bit of a no idea of what um what I'm
whether<00:03:22.400> or<00:03:22.579> not<00:03:22.700> that's<00:03:22.880> that's<00:03:23.329> good<00:03:23.569> enough

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 
whether or not that's that's good enough

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:25.210 
whether or not that's that's good enough
whether<00:03:24.049> or<00:03:24.200> not<00:03:24.290> I<00:03:24.350> should<00:03:24.440> scrape<00:03:24.889> the<00:03:25.040> cuts

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
whether or not I should scrape the cuts

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:28.209 
whether or not I should scrape the cuts
out<00:03:25.430> a<00:03:25.459> level<00:03:25.850> a<00:03:25.910> little<00:03:26.120> bit
