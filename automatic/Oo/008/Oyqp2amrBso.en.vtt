what are your thoughts on the entire CM
Punk<00:00:03.149> situation<00:00:03.600> right<00:00:03.780> now<00:00:03.870> I<00:00:04.170> don't<00:00:04.410> know<00:00:04.650> I

00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:04.859 
Punk situation right now I don't know I

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.049 
Punk situation right now I don't know I
I<00:00:05.130> think<00:00:05.250> he<00:00:05.520> loves<00:00:05.730> the<00:00:05.850> business<00:00:06.890> and<00:00:08.059> having

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
I think he loves the business and having

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:10.850 
I think he loves the business and having
said<00:00:09.300> that<00:00:09.330> that<00:00:09.780> makes<00:00:10.139> me<00:00:10.290> think<00:00:10.440> that<00:00:10.590> he

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
said that that makes me think that he

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.999 
said that that makes me think that he
may<00:00:11.070> want<00:00:11.400> to<00:00:11.490> come<00:00:11.639> back<00:00:11.670> during<00:00:11.940> him<00:00:12.150> honor

00:00:12.999 --> 00:00:13.009 
may want to come back during him honor

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:15.379 
may want to come back during him honor
because<00:00:14.009> he<00:00:14.099> certainly<00:00:14.490> doesn't<00:00:14.820> need<00:00:15.120> to<00:00:15.269> go

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
because he certainly doesn't need to go

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.180 
because he certainly doesn't need to go
back<00:00:15.540> for<00:00:15.780> the<00:00:15.839> money<00:00:15.960> he'll<00:00:16.379> never<00:00:16.650> need

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
back for the money he'll never need

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.340 
back for the money he'll never need
another<00:00:17.490> dollar<00:00:18.029> of<00:00:18.390> intimate<00:00:18.990> Vince

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
another dollar of intimate Vince

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:20.840 
another dollar of intimate Vince
McMahon's<00:00:19.680> money<00:00:19.890> if<00:00:20.070> he<00:00:20.130> doesn't<00:00:20.550> want<00:00:20.730> it

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
McMahon's money if he doesn't want it

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.460 
McMahon's money if he doesn't want it
right<00:00:21.270> um<00:00:21.539> so<00:00:23.269> it's<00:00:24.269> conceivable<00:00:24.900> that<00:00:25.289> he

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
right um so it's conceivable that he

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.349 
right um so it's conceivable that he
would<00:00:25.590> come<00:00:25.740> back<00:00:25.830> to<00:00:25.890> Ring<00:00:26.189> of<00:00:26.279> Honor<00:00:26.460> you

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.120 
I always thought Raven had a great mind
for<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.369> business<00:01:05.700> and<00:01:06.150> if<00:01:06.930> he<00:01:07.170> was<00:01:07.320> put<00:01:07.950> in<00:01:08.070> a

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
for the business and if he was put in a

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.830 
for the business and if he was put in a
position<00:01:08.250> where<00:01:08.700> he<00:01:08.909> was<00:01:09.030> just<00:01:09.299> creative<00:01:09.689> and

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
position where he was just creative and

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.570 
position where he was just creative and
not<00:01:09.960> talent<00:01:10.409> I<00:01:10.470> think<00:01:10.799> he'd<00:01:11.070> be<00:01:11.189> outstanding

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
not talent I think he'd be outstanding

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.980 
not talent I think he'd be outstanding
Tommy<00:01:12.390> Dreamer<00:01:12.750> uh<00:01:13.850> Bubba<00:01:14.850> is<00:01:15.180> is<00:01:15.540> got<00:01:15.750> a<00:01:15.780> good

mind<00:01:16.140> for<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.439> business<00:01:16.770> and<00:01:16.950> I<00:01:16.979> think<00:01:17.070> if<00:01:17.310> he

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
mind for the business and I think if he

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.499 
mind for the business and I think if he
was<00:01:17.610> put<00:01:17.790> in<00:01:17.850> a<00:01:17.880> position<00:01:18.030> where<00:01:18.900> he<00:01:19.590> was<00:01:19.770> just

was put in a position where he was just
writing<00:01:21.509> creative<00:01:22.080> I<00:01:22.229> think<00:01:22.439> he<00:01:22.590> would<00:01:22.740> have<00:01:22.979> a

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
writing creative I think he would have a

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.800 
writing creative I think he would have a
lot<00:01:23.280> to<00:01:23.460> offer<00:01:23.549> not<00:01:23.850> that<00:01:24.000> he<00:01:24.060> doesn't<00:01:24.450> but<00:01:24.600> you

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.700 
think that they need guys that have
wrestled<00:01:47.369> and<00:01:47.579> have<00:01:48.030> wrestling<00:01:48.540> a<00:01:48.840> wrestling

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.679 
wrestled and have wrestling a wrestling
mentality<00:01:50.340> on<00:01:50.520> that<00:01:50.909> creative<00:01:51.240> team<00:01:51.450> and

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
mentality on that creative team and

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.780 
mentality on that creative team and
right<00:01:51.930> now<00:01:52.079> they<00:01:52.290> don't<00:01:52.439> have<00:01:52.560> any<00:01:52.950> money<00:01:53.250> it's

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
right now they don't have any money it's

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.550 
right now they don't have any money it's
all<00:01:54.060> guys<00:01:54.240> that<00:01:54.540> have<00:01:54.659> never<00:01:54.810> wrestled<00:01:55.350> and

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
all guys that have never wrestled and

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.880 
all guys that have never wrestled and
that<00:01:56.549> are<00:01:56.850> I<00:01:57.149> feel<00:01:58.140> like<00:01:58.320> they're<00:01:58.469> writing

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
that are I feel like they're writing

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.160 
that are I feel like they're writing
stuff<00:01:59.189> that's<00:01:59.430> not<00:01:59.670> wrestling<00:02:00.090> it's<00:02:00.570> it's<00:02:00.960> one

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
stuff that's not wrestling it's it's one

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.569 
stuff that's not wrestling it's it's one
of<00:02:01.229> those<00:02:01.320> things<00:02:01.590> where<00:02:01.799> they're<00:02:02.280> trying<00:02:02.460> to

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
of those things where they're trying to

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.490 
of those things where they're trying to
write<00:02:02.759> stuff<00:02:03.000> that's<00:02:03.240> entertainment<00:02:03.899> and<00:02:04.049> we

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
write stuff that's entertainment and we

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:05.810 
write stuff that's entertainment and we
might<00:02:04.680> sprinkle<00:02:05.130> wrestling<00:02:05.460> match<00:02:05.640> in

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
might sprinkle wrestling match in

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.600 
might sprinkle wrestling match in
between<00:02:06.210> and<00:02:06.509> as<00:02:06.630> a<00:02:06.659> result<00:02:07.110> the<00:02:08.039> storylines

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
between and as a result the storylines

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.780 
between and as a result the storylines
aren't<00:02:09.000> really<00:02:09.209> meshing<00:02:09.780> with<00:02:10.050> a<00:02:10.790> wrestling

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
aren't really meshing with a wrestling

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.140 
aren't really meshing with a wrestling
style

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
style

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:14.850
