00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:09.030
 just implement that I headed to the 

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:11.639
 intention to resurface but the cap of 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.840
 the striped chivas of guadalajara 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.580
 met in a park on avenue 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.619
 Cuauhtémoc for the purpose of encouraging 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.580
 to the flock where they understood how 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.580
 Senior Sunday 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:31.650
 the journey was less runaway than in 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.090
 other occasions since the background 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.710
 of the forms of chivas are pretty 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.650
 negative and now prefer the bass 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.780
 profile go on this occasion until pay 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:42.410
 a passage in the minibuses no longer what 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.410
 kidnapped 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.630
 and the arrival gives them what is already 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.880
 I expected police surveillance by all 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:55.290
 sides like the little children to 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:58.850
 whom you have to take to your seat 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:58.850
 so they do not make mischief 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.730
 on the field the tapatía directive 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:12.310
 he presumed the behavior of his 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:14.560
 young but of the others of those who 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.810
 they play they just notified us that 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.300
 we were champions category 2000 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.190
 defeating atletico de madrid 2-0 and 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:23.860
 we had eliminated the villarreal 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:25.090
 they are the chivitas meanwhile outside 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.890
 of the stadium and in view of the 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.750
 popularity of the visit was 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:30.310
 difficult to know what shirt 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.670
 sell more among the distinguished 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.670
 concurrence 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.500
 in the university agency as it is 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.900
 custom the hymn of the 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.409
 premises without the visitor in the field 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.940
 but with the boos of their bias 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:53.130
 then gave way to the rojiblancos and 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:55.439
 everyone greeted each other before stepping on the 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.119
 field to play the volpe he realized 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.399
 that there were photo and video cameras and 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.369
 preferred to get on the court before 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.930
 mixed with photojournalists 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:05.670
 slow way like the bullfighters when 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.770
 part in place and went directly to 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.750
 sit on your bench without directing a 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.050
 look no longer say hello to joseph 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.050
 luis trejo 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.330
 and so the encounter with two began 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.310
 equipment that respected moderately 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.960
 but that they taught in the same first 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.210
 time they wanted time 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:25.250
 opportunities in both doors though 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:28.240
 the archers prevailed in the duels 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.240
 before the attack 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.709
 It was not the full but the entrance showed 

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:35.930
 that the two teams were looking for 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:37.730
 classification to the line 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.650
 in the second part there were changes 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.569
 tactics in chivas that ended up 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.519
 decompose the team what 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:46.400
 they used the cougars to do the 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:48.939
 play that would make the screams burst and 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.939
 the balls 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.350
 then the chivas changes were with 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:02.930
 players from the bench what ended 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:04.640
 to define the auriazul victory even more 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.070
 the opportunities were greater for the 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:09.530
 trejo team who gained clear life 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:11.750
 from the game to the volpe balls to the 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:14.000
 sticks and approaches of greater danger 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:17.530
 for cougars that was closer to the 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.530
 second that chivas the tie 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.750
 and so the game ended and the players 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:23.850
 as they congratulated each other 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:27.000
 congratulates for being invited to a 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:29.640
 very good party on the other side faces 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.370
 long they followed one another and the colophon of this 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:34.170
 party put it the volpe who left 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:38.010
 making signals and tactics to giovanni 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:42.200
 very very tactical squares 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:42.200
 although today they were useless
