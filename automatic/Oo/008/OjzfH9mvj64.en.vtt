00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:06.919
 Hello, I want to show now 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:10.170
 Senpai mouth igruha big enough and 

00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:12.630
 mysteriously big game that got 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.330
 on this unit because there is only 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.699
 only 4 gigabytes and with installation cool 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.550
 large applications are available 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:23.210
 particular difficulty particular this 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.560
 the game takes less than 1 gigabyte so 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:28.529
 she climbed here 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:42.000
 quite a decent way she goes now 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:45.629
 show you and so the game has loaded 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.960
 quite a long time and I am so 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:51.920
 I understand that I now have to fight with 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.920
 by a stroke 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:59.390
 I do not like this bazaar but what to do 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.390
 turning faces 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:16.530
 I have already passed this part 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:19.830
 again here as a whole show you 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:22.880
 find graphics very terrible i just 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:28.979
 most minimal megapixel 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:31.430
 very very pixel graphics and ship 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.430
 moving 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:36.049
 rotates 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:02:04.860
 so now we will swim away in order to 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:06.720
 fall with another ship we all 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:11.580
 now successfully and deal 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:15.050
 there are some slowdowns so that 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.050
 could find on aviv 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:31.820
 and we are almost close and here 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:39.190
 this ship will be the bazaar again 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:43.810
 and our task is to destroy the ship 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:43.810
 than we are now successfully and loans 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:08.469
 so you 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:23.360
 Excellent from the first I will be 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:26.950
 Attack 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.950
 i'm back 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:54.510
 so I select bail Tattoos 

00:03:48.999 --> 00:03:54.510
 and in the end now it's time to have it 

00:03:58.139 --> 00:04:04.859
 finish infinitely very mediocre 

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:07.780
 so say that big games on this 

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:10.769
 smartphones will go no, well, more precisely 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:13.209
 here went but with some qualities 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:16.780
 install other bigger games don't 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:19.889
 it will turn out to be quite small 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:23.199
 riman jungle wounds any there too 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:26.320
 maybe tower defense and simple and 

00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:28.660
 simple games for him yes everything else 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:30.849
 certainly not quite fit all thanks
