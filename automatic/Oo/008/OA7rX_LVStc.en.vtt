00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.450 

now<00:01:16.690> this<00:01:16.840> next<00:01:16.990> part<00:01:17.260> will<00:01:18.040> seem<00:01:18.250> a<00:01:18.280> little

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:18.460 
now this next part will seem a little

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:20.070 
now this next part will seem a little
harder<00:01:18.880> than<00:01:19.030> it<00:01:19.120> actually<00:01:19.240> is<00:01:19.600> it's<00:01:19.780> not<00:01:19.930> too

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:20.080 
harder than it actually is it's not too

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:26.480 
harder than it actually is it's not too
bad<00:01:20.290> it's

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.149 

you<00:01:27.490> started<00:01:27.820> off<00:01:27.939> with<00:01:28.619> fourth<00:01:29.619> string<00:01:29.860> fifth

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:30.159 
you started off with fourth string fifth

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:40.890 
you started off with fourth string fifth
fret<00:01:30.189> and<00:01:30.610> we're<00:01:31.420> gonna<00:01:31.540> go

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:40.900 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.510 

and<00:01:41.320> then<00:01:41.440> you're<00:01:41.560> just<00:01:41.680> gonna<00:01:41.860> slide<00:01:42.280> it<00:01:42.430> up

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.520 
and then you're just gonna slide it up

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:43.980 
and then you're just gonna slide it up
we're<00:01:42.700> gonna<00:01:42.790> be<00:01:42.880> using<00:01:43.270> the<00:01:43.360> fourth<00:01:43.690> string

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
we're gonna be using the fourth string

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.200 
we're gonna be using the fourth string
and<00:01:44.200> the<00:01:44.620> second<00:01:45.010> string<00:01:45.250> together<00:01:45.730> and<00:01:46.090> those

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 
and the second string together and those

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:47.280 
and the second string together and those
are<00:01:46.330> the<00:01:46.420> only<00:01:46.540> two<00:01:46.720> strings<00:01:46.990> were<00:01:47.110> going<00:01:47.230> to

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:47.290 
are the only two strings were going to

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:49.380 
are the only two strings were going to
be<00:01:47.380> using<00:01:47.710> and<00:01:48.010> at<00:01:48.640> the<00:01:48.730> pattern<00:01:49.060> there's<00:01:49.270> only

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
be using and at the pattern there's only

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:50.550 
be using and at the pattern there's only
two<00:01:49.570> different<00:01:49.840> patterns<00:01:49.990> so<00:01:50.230> it's<00:01:50.410> actually

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560 
two different patterns so it's actually

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.220 
two different patterns so it's actually
not<00:01:51.490> that<00:01:51.550> hard<00:01:51.940> to<00:01:52.000> do<00:01:52.120> yeah<00:01:52.990> we're<00:01:53.140> gonna

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:53.230 
not that hard to do yeah we're gonna

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:55.140 
not that hard to do yeah we're gonna
slide<00:01:53.590> it<00:01:53.710> up<00:01:53.830> to<00:01:54.040> the<00:01:54.160> ninth<00:01:54.490> fret<00:01:54.730> and<00:01:55.030> the

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:55.150 
slide it up to the ninth fret and the

00:01:55.150 --> 00:02:04.030 
slide it up to the ninth fret and the
eighth<00:01:55.330> fret<00:01:59.730> and<00:02:00.730> you<00:02:00.970> slide<00:02:01.600> it<00:02:01.630> up

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.040 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.860 

and<00:02:04.580> you<00:02:04.640> get<00:02:04.790> the<00:02:04.880> same<00:02:05.060> pattern<00:02:05.270> two<00:02:05.660> frets

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:05.870 
and you get the same pattern two frets

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:10.060 
and you get the same pattern two frets
down<00:02:06.140> but<00:02:06.530> you<00:02:06.620> slide<00:02:06.830> it<00:02:06.950> up<00:02:08.680> and<00:02:09.680> we're<00:02:09.979> gonna

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:10.070 
down but you slide it up and we're gonna

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:12.520

go on the same string the same strings

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.980 
go on the same string the same strings
but<00:02:12.770> the<00:02:13.040> different<00:02:13.550> pattern<00:02:13.970> we're<00:02:14.720> going<00:02:14.870> on

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:14.990 
but the different pattern we're going on
