00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
create a vacuum leak something like that

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.140 
create a vacuum leak something like that
it's<00:01:11.760> not<00:01:11.909> designed<00:01:12.270> for<00:01:12.750> a<00:01:12.990> specific<00:01:13.850> EGR<00:01:14.850> or

something<00:01:15.450> like<00:01:15.540> that<00:01:15.600> and<00:01:16.350> then<00:01:16.500> liquid<00:01:16.890> fuel

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
something like that and then liquid fuel

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.600 
something like that and then liquid fuel
test<00:01:17.600> no<00:01:18.600> leak<00:01:18.840> so<00:01:19.110> that<00:01:19.350> passes<00:01:19.770> also<00:01:20.040> we're

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
test no leak so that passes also we're

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.260 
test no leak so that passes also we're
good<00:01:20.759> we're<00:01:21.030> good<00:01:22.430> now<00:01:23.430> we<00:01:23.490> are<00:01:23.700> doing<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:24.060> gas

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
good we're good now we are doing the gas

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:32.149 
good we're good now we are doing the gas
cap

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.430 

so<00:01:32.399> we<00:01:32.549> have<00:01:32.670> a<00:01:32.700> little

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:34.440 
so we have a little

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.850 
so we have a little
here<00:01:35.040> you<00:01:35.160> put<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.430> gas<00:01:35.610> cap<00:01:35.910> on<00:01:36.860> pressurize

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
here you put the gas cap on pressurize

00:01:37.860 --> 00:02:00.820 
here you put the gas cap on pressurize
the<00:01:38.070> cap<00:01:38.310> adjust<00:01:38.910> the<00:01:39.210> pressure<00:01:39.390> test

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.040 
the functional portion of the test which

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.170 
the functional portion of the test which
is<00:02:04.310> the<00:02:04.520> obd<00:02:05.030> on-board<00:02:06.070> diagnostic<00:02:07.070> scan<00:02:07.340> gas

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:08.180 
is the obd on-board diagnostic scan gas

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:10.240 
is the obd on-board diagnostic scan gas
cap<00:02:08.479> tests<00:02:08.930> and<00:02:09.229> this<00:02:09.410> vehicle<00:02:09.649> does<00:02:09.860> not<00:02:10.130> need

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
cap tests and this vehicle does not need

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.330 
cap tests and this vehicle does not need
a<00:02:10.310> time<00:02:10.520> and<00:02:10.670> check<00:02:10.820> is<00:02:11.000> electronic<00:02:11.660> so<00:02:12.340> the

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
a time and check is electronic so the

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:14.770 
a time and check is electronic so the
gas<00:02:13.550> cap<00:02:13.850> check<00:02:14.120> that<00:02:14.330> was<00:02:14.450> something<00:02:14.630> that

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
gas cap check that was something that

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.570 
gas cap check that was something that
was<00:02:14.960> totally<00:02:15.380> surprising<00:02:15.800> a<00:02:16.040> new<00:02:16.160> to<00:02:16.280> me<00:02:16.400> when

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
was totally surprising a new to me when

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.300 
was totally surprising a new to me when
I<00:02:16.610> brought<00:02:16.850> the<00:02:17.000> BMW<00:02:17.600> n<00:02:17.780> is<00:02:18.140> it<00:02:18.500> new<00:02:18.800> in<00:02:19.100> the

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
I brought the BMW n is it new in the

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.180 
I brought the BMW n is it new in the

state or it has it been long lasting
probably<00:02:22.190> several<00:02:22.580> years<00:02:22.850> now<00:02:23.030> they've<00:02:23.510> been

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
probably several years now they've been

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.630 
probably several years now they've been
doing<00:02:23.720> that<00:02:23.930> if<00:02:24.440> you<00:02:24.560> think<00:02:24.680> about<00:02:24.830> it<00:02:25.010> if<00:02:25.310> you

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
doing that if you think about it if you

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.120 
doing that if you think about it if you
got<00:02:25.760> 20<00:02:26.390> gallons<00:02:26.900> of<00:02:27.050> gas<00:02:27.260> sloshing<00:02:28.040> around

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.070 
got 20 gallons of gas sloshing around
that<00:02:28.610> creates<00:02:28.940> a<00:02:29.030> lot<00:02:29.240> of<00:02:29.420> vapors<00:02:29.720> that<00:02:29.750> would

that creates a lot of vapors that would

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.440 
that creates a lot of vapors that would
normally<00:02:30.200> be<00:02:30.470> burned<00:02:30.800> in<00:02:30.980> the<00:02:31.070> engine<00:02:31.450> but

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
normally be burned in the engine but

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.120 
normally be burned in the engine but
they're<00:02:32.600> just<00:02:32.810> escaping<00:02:33.230> if<00:02:33.500> the<00:02:33.620> gas<00:02:33.890> cap<00:02:34.100> is

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
they're just escaping if the gas cap is

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.380 
they're just escaping if the gas cap is
no<00:02:34.400> good

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
no good

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.300 
no good
and<00:02:36.720> how<00:02:36.900> frequent<00:02:37.410> do<00:02:37.530> people<00:02:37.860> find<00:02:38.069> their

gas<00:02:38.490> caps<00:02:38.819> have<00:02:39.000> to<00:02:39.120> be<00:02:39.240> replaced<00:02:39.510> because<00:02:39.780> it

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
gas caps have to be replaced because it

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.199 
gas caps have to be replaced because it
is<00:02:40.170> really<00:02:40.800> hot<00:02:41.010> and<00:02:41.250> dry<00:02:41.430> here<00:02:41.459> I'm<00:02:41.910> sure

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
is really hot and dry here I'm sure

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:45.710 
is really hot and dry here I'm sure
rubber<00:02:42.510> gaskets<00:02:43.050> would<00:02:43.200> dry<00:02:43.830> out<00:02:44.300> 2<00:02:45.300> out<00:02:45.330> of<00:02:45.480> 10

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
rubber gaskets would dry out 2 out of 10

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.280 
rubber gaskets would dry out 2 out of 10
right<00:02:46.050> around

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.740 

so<00:02:49.290> now<00:02:49.440> I'm<00:02:49.590> inputting<00:02:49.800> the<00:02:50.280> information<00:02:50.760> for

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
the results of the visual inspection so

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.650 
the results of the visual inspection so

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
create a vacuum leak something like that

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110 
something like that and then liquid fuel

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:31.580 
something like that and then liquid fuel
test<00:03:28.610> no<00:03:29.610> leak<00:03:29.820> so<00:03:30.120> that<00:03:30.330> passes<00:03:30.750> also<00:03:31.020> we're

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
test no leak so that passes also we're

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.270 
test no leak so that passes also we're
good<00:03:31.770> we're<00:03:32.010> good<00:03:33.410> now<00:03:34.410> we<00:03:34.470> are<00:03:34.680> doing<00:03:34.890> the<00:03:35.040> gas

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
good we're good now we are doing the gas

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:43.090 
good we're good now we are doing the gas
cap

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:43.100 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:45.450 

so<00:03:43.400> we<00:03:43.520> have<00:03:43.670> a<00:03:43.700> little

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:45.460 
so we have a little

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:48.840 
so we have a little
here<00:03:46.030> you<00:03:46.150> put<00:03:46.330> the<00:03:46.420> gas<00:03:46.600> cap<00:03:46.900> on<00:03:47.850> pressurize

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:48.850 
here you put the gas cap on pressurize

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:51.060 
here you put the gas cap on pressurize
the<00:03:49.060> cabin<00:03:49.090> just<00:03:49.900> the<00:03:50.200> pressure<00:03:50.410> test<00:03:50.740> on<00:03:50.980> the

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:51.070 
the cabin just the pressure test on the

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:57.780 
the cabin just the pressure test on the
cat<00:03:54.540> well<00:03:55.540> you'll<00:03:56.380> kill<00:03:56.710> the<00:03:57.100> fill<00:03:57.370> Piper's

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:57.790 
cat well you'll kill the fill Piper's

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:01.350 
cat well you'll kill the fill Piper's
could<00:03:58.030> do<00:03:59.100> that<00:04:00.100> really<00:04:00.670> doesn't<00:04:00.910> kind<00:04:01.210> of

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:01.360 
could do that really doesn't kind of

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.750 
could do that really doesn't kind of
apply<00:04:01.660> anymore<00:04:02.110> used<00:04:03.010> to<00:04:03.160> be<00:04:03.310> one<00:04:03.490> there<00:04:03.610> with

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 
apply anymore used to be one there with

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.540 
apply anymore used to be one there with
leaded<00:04:04.000> gas<00:04:04.330> and<00:04:04.720> unleaded<00:04:04.990> gas<00:04:05.350> they<00:04:06.310> would

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:06.550 
leaded gas and unleaded gas they would

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:08.610 
leaded gas and unleaded gas they would
have<00:04:07.150> to<00:04:07.330> have<00:04:07.480> a<00:04:07.510> restrictor<00:04:08.140> in<00:04:08.320> the<00:04:08.410> film

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
have to have a restrictor in the film

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:10.860 
have to have a restrictor in the film
neck<00:04:08.800> so<00:04:09.250> you<00:04:09.340> could<00:04:09.550> not<00:04:09.760> put<00:04:10.000> leaded<00:04:10.390> gas<00:04:10.600> in

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:10.870 
neck so you could not put leaded gas in

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:13.020 
neck so you could not put leaded gas in
there<00:04:11.050> they<00:04:11.650> still<00:04:11.890> have<00:04:12.070> it<00:04:12.100> on<00:04:12.280> here<00:04:12.580> for

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.030 
there they still have it on here for

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:16.470 
there they still have it on here for
some<00:04:13.870> reason<00:04:14.730> that<00:04:15.730> this<00:04:16.000> ethanol

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:16.480 
some reason that this ethanol

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:19.410 
some reason that this ethanol
combination<00:04:17.320> gas<00:04:17.530> used<00:04:17.800> here<00:04:18.070> yes<00:04:18.760> it<00:04:18.910> is<00:04:19.000> and

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:19.420 
combination gas used here yes it is and

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:22.740 
combination gas used here yes it is and
is<00:04:19.630> that<00:04:19.780> fine<00:04:20.110> it's<00:04:20.610> that's<00:04:21.610> fine<00:04:21.790> lesser

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:22.750 
is that fine it's that's fine lesser

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.400 
is that fine it's that's fine lesser
emissions<00:04:23.400> he<00:04:24.400> has<00:04:24.550> about<00:04:24.820> the<00:04:24.880> same<00:04:24.970> actually

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 
emissions he has about the same actually

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:29.010 
emissions he has about the same actually
yeah<00:04:26.410> I<00:04:26.820> think<00:04:27.820> it's<00:04:28.000> more<00:04:28.090> like<00:04:28.390> natural<00:04:28.810> gas

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:29.020 
yeah I think it's more like natural gas

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.080 
yeah I think it's more like natural gas
the<00:04:29.320> emissions<00:04:29.680> are<00:04:29.830> still<00:04:30.040> there<00:04:30.280> but<00:04:30.940> you

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.090 
the emissions are still there but you

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:34.970 
the emissions are still there but you
can't<00:04:31.330> see<00:04:31.420> them<00:04:31.690> this<00:04:32.340> on<00:04:33.340> gasoline<00:04:33.850> if<00:04:34.510> the

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:34.980 
can't see them this on gasoline if the

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:37.650 
can't see them this on gasoline if the
if<00:04:35.980> there's<00:04:36.220> a<00:04:36.280> missions<00:04:36.910> you<00:04:37.030> can<00:04:37.180> see<00:04:37.390> it<00:04:37.540> in

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:37.660 
if there's a missions you can see it in

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:40.320 
if there's a missions you can see it in
black<00:04:38.020> smoke<00:04:38.470> but<00:04:39.190> on<00:04:39.310> natural<00:04:39.760> gas<00:04:39.790> or

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.330 
black smoke but on natural gas or

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:45.330 
black smoke but on natural gas or
propane<00:04:42.300> it's<00:04:43.300> it's<00:04:43.780> a<00:04:43.930> clear<00:04:44.320> lyst<00:04:44.530> gas<00:04:45.010> so

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:45.340 
propane it's it's a clear lyst gas so

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.070 
propane it's it's a clear lyst gas so
you<00:04:45.400> can't<00:04:45.700> see<00:04:45.910> the<00:04:46.060> emissions<00:04:46.480> even<00:04:46.990> though

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.080 
you can't see the emissions even though

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:48.270 
you can't see the emissions even though
they're<00:04:47.230> still<00:04:47.440> there<00:04:47.470> they're<00:04:47.830> measurable

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:48.280 
they're still there they're measurable

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:51.360 
they're still there they're measurable
but<00:04:48.610> you<00:04:48.700> can't<00:04:48.940> see<00:04:49.150> it<00:04:49.240> so<00:04:49.750> is<00:04:50.080> ethanol<00:04:50.950> used

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:51.370 
but you can't see it so is ethanol used

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:54.150 
but you can't see it so is ethanol used
primarily<00:04:51.640> in<00:04:51.970> the<00:04:52.090> winter<00:04:52.510> here<00:04:52.750> then<00:04:52.960> to<00:04:53.170> cut

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:54.160 
primarily in the winter here then to cut

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.460 
primarily in the winter here then to cut
emissions<00:04:54.280> or<00:04:54.700> year-round<00:04:54.970> carry<00:04:55.900> a<00:04:56.020> mix<00:04:56.290> of

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:56.470 
emissions or year-round carry a mix of
