some<00:00:32.940> of<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.090> brands<00:00:33.480> is<00:00:33.600> an<00:00:34.170> m10<00:00:34.590> or<00:00:34.770> a<00:00:34.800> metric

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
some of the brands is an m10 or a metric

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.520 
some of the brands is an m10 or a metric
10<00:00:35.460> it's<00:00:35.640> very<00:00:35.820> close<00:00:36.149> to<00:00:36.180> a<00:00:36.420> 3/8<00:00:36.899> diameter<00:00:37.140> so

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
10 it's very close to a 3/8 diameter so

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.830 
10 it's very close to a 3/8 diameter so
sometimes<00:00:37.980> it's<00:00:38.129> hard<00:00:38.309> to<00:00:38.370> tell<00:00:38.690> the<00:00:39.690> other

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
sometimes it's hard to tell the other

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.430 
sometimes it's hard to tell the other
size<00:00:40.200> is<00:00:40.590> 3/8<00:00:41.280> by<00:00:41.820> 24<00:00:42.570> threads<00:00:42.930> per<00:00:43.140> inch<00:00:43.170> or

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
size is 3/8 by 24 threads per inch or

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.500 
size is 3/8 by 24 threads per inch or
3/8<00:00:43.860> 20<00:00:44.579> 40<00:00:45.620> so<00:00:46.620> for<00:00:46.829> example<00:00:47.340> I<00:00:47.550> have<00:00:48.090> here<00:00:48.360> one

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
3/8 20 40 so for example I have here one

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:03.860 
the tubular nut you're going to take a

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.190 
the tubular nut you're going to take a
metric<00:01:04.860> 3<00:01:05.189> allen<00:01:05.549> wrench<00:01:05.760> and<00:01:06.090> you're<00:01:07.080> gonna

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
metric 3 allen wrench and you're gonna

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.940 
metric 3 allen wrench and you're gonna
unthread<00:01:07.799> that<00:01:08.040> pull<00:01:08.909> out<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.240> tubular<00:01:09.570> nut

unthread that pull out the tubular nut

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:17.030 
unthread that pull out the tubular nut
we'll<00:01:10.950> just<00:01:11.189> do<00:01:11.340> that<00:01:14.960> replace<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.619> tubular

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
we'll just do that replace the tubular

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.789 
we'll just do that replace the tubular
not<00:01:17.220> with<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.490> size<00:01:17.670> you<00:01:17.909> need<00:01:18.090> and<00:01:18.590> then<00:01:19.590> put

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
not with the size you need and then put

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.700 
not with the size you need and then put
the<00:01:19.920> pin<00:01:20.130> back<00:01:20.159> in<00:01:20.369> very<00:01:21.030> very<00:01:21.330> simple<00:01:21.750> on<00:01:22.439> the

take out that size that it came with and
in<00:01:44.640> this<00:01:44.880> case<00:01:45.710> I've<00:01:46.710> got<00:01:46.799> a<00:01:47.250> 3/8<00:01:48.090> 24<00:01:49.520> insert

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
in this case I've got a 3/8 24 insert

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.850 
in this case I've got a 3/8 24 insert
the<00:01:50.700> size<00:01:50.909> that<00:01:51.180> you<00:01:51.270> need<00:01:51.299> and<00:01:51.810> put<00:01:52.710> the

the size that you need and put the
assembly<00:01:53.100> back<00:01:53.490> together<00:01:53.720> so<00:01:54.720> very<00:01:54.990> very

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
assembly back together so very very

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.399 
assembly back together so very very
simple<00:01:55.710> to<00:01:55.829> accomplish<00:01:56.420> it<00:01:57.420> takes<00:01:58.140> a<00:01:58.229> few
