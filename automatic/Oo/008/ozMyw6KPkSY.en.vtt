00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
also new processors now also we have a

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.140 
also new processors now also we have a
biggest<00:01:12.960> shift<00:01:13.200> in<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:13.770> port's<00:01:14.250> included<00:01:14.729> so

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
biggest shift in the port's included so

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.770 
biggest shift in the port's included so
but<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:15.869> new<00:01:16.140> super<00:01:16.770> thin<00:01:17.100> design<00:01:17.479> you've<00:01:18.479> got

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
but the new super thin design you've got

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.530 
but the new super thin design you've got
no<00:01:19.320> Ethernet<00:01:19.710> port<00:01:19.920> port<00:01:20.250> simply<00:01:20.580> too<00:01:20.700> big<00:01:20.759> but

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
no Ethernet port port simply too big but

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.510 
no Ethernet port port simply too big but
you<00:01:21.659> have<00:01:21.810> two<00:01:21.960> Thunderbolt<00:01:22.470> ports<00:01:22.770> and<00:01:22.950> as<00:01:23.369> we

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
you have two Thunderbolt ports and as we

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.520 
you have two Thunderbolt ports and as we
know<00:01:23.549> you<00:01:23.700> can<00:01:24.000> have<00:01:24.210> a<00:01:24.240> thunderbolt<00:01:24.990> ethernet

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
know you can have a thunderbolt ethernet

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.170 
know you can have a thunderbolt ethernet
adapter<00:01:26.009> so<00:01:26.250> if<00:01:26.400> you<00:01:26.490> still<00:01:26.670> need<00:01:26.820> to<00:01:26.880> hook<00:01:27.030> up

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
adapter so if you still need to hook up

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.700 
adapter so if you still need to hook up
to<00:01:27.479> a<00:01:27.509> wired<00:01:27.810> connection<00:01:28.140> you<00:01:28.409> would<00:01:28.530> do<00:01:28.590> it

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
to a wired connection you would do it

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.310 
to a wired connection you would do it
that<00:01:28.920> way<00:01:29.150> also<00:01:30.150> gone<00:01:30.329> is<00:01:30.450> a<00:01:30.509> firewire<00:01:30.990> port

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
that way also gone is a firewire port

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.609 
that way also gone is a firewire port
but<00:01:31.590> included<00:01:32.310> is<00:01:32.460> an<00:01:32.790> HDMI<00:01:33.600> out<00:01:33.900> port<00:01:33.960> so<00:01:34.590> you

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
but included is an HDMI out port so you

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.219 
but included is an HDMI out port so you
can<00:01:34.829> hook<00:01:34.950> directly<00:01:35.430> up<00:01:35.579> to<00:01:35.880> a<00:01:36.229> television

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
can hook directly up to a television

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.069 
can hook directly up to a television
using<00:01:37.740> HDMI<00:01:38.280> right<00:01:39.030> from<00:01:39.240> this<00:01:39.420> new<00:01:39.659> MacBook
