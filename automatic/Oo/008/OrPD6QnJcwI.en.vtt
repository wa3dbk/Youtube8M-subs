00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.760 
then I have some on and as you can see
it's<00:01:58.880> a<00:01:59.000> pretty<00:01:59.030> thick<00:01:59.659> consistency<00:02:00.380> it<00:02:00.590> is

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
it's a pretty thick consistency it is

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:02.440 
it's a pretty thick consistency it is
kind<00:02:01.130> of<00:02:01.190> running<00:02:01.430> a<00:02:01.700> little<00:02:01.820> bit<00:02:02.060> down<00:02:02.270> my

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
kind of running a little bit down my

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.810 
kind of running a little bit down my
hand<00:02:02.690> but<00:02:03.380> not<00:02:03.560> too<00:02:03.770> much<00:02:03.950> which<00:02:04.340> is<00:02:04.580> just

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:04.820 
hand but not too much which is just

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.120 
hand but not too much which is just
perfect<00:02:05.030> because<00:02:05.659> I<00:02:05.900> hate<00:02:06.290> foundations<00:02:07.040> that

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
perfect because I hate foundations that

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.190 
perfect because I hate foundations that
are<00:02:07.280> really<00:02:07.729> kind<00:02:07.850> of<00:02:08.000> gooey<00:02:08.239> and<00:02:08.539> sticky<00:02:08.720> like

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
are really kind of gooey and sticky like

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.069 
are really kind of gooey and sticky like
for<00:02:09.440> example<00:02:09.999> Revlon<00:02:10.999> Colorstay<00:02:11.299> that<00:02:11.780> one<00:02:11.930> is

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:12.079 
for example Revlon Colorstay that one is

00:02:12.079 --> 00:02:14.559 
for example Revlon Colorstay that one is
really<00:02:12.499> thick<00:02:12.829> and<00:02:13.069> it<00:02:13.400> just<00:02:13.609> feels<00:02:13.969> horrible

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:14.569 
really thick and it just feels horrible

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:15.630 
really thick and it just feels horrible
on<00:02:14.870> your<00:02:14.989> skin

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
on your skin

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.520 
on your skin

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
and also really runny foundations they

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.740 
and also really runny foundations they
they<00:02:18.400> just<00:02:18.580> feel<00:02:18.790> weird<00:02:19.090> I<00:02:19.330> mean<00:02:19.360> it's<00:02:19.690> a

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
they just feel weird I mean it's a

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.300 
they just feel weird I mean it's a
foundation<00:02:19.870> it's<00:02:20.470> not<00:02:20.680> supposed<00:02:20.980> to<00:02:21.040> be<00:02:21.160> like

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:22.770 
foundation it's not supposed to be like
water<00:02:21.550> it's<00:02:21.790> not<00:02:21.820> supposed<00:02:22.150> to<00:02:22.240> run<00:02:22.480> down<00:02:22.660> your

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780

face which I'm this consistency is

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.480 
face which I'm this consistency is
probably<00:02:27.010> like<00:02:27.580> the<00:02:27.910> best<00:02:28.570> in<00:02:28.930> between<00:02:29.410> let<00:02:30.370> me

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:30.490 
probably like the best in between let me

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:32.790 
probably like the best in between let me

foundation so that is saying something
the<00:03:43.239> finish<00:03:43.690> yeah<00:03:44.049> the<00:03:44.260> finish<00:03:44.500> I<00:03:44.680> said<00:03:44.980> is

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
the finish yeah the finish I said is

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.990 
the finish yeah the finish I said is
kind<00:03:45.820> of<00:03:45.880> in-between<00:03:47.549> coverage<00:03:48.549> it<00:03:48.880> doesn't

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
kind of in-between coverage it doesn't

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.110 
kind of in-between coverage it doesn't
actually<00:03:49.239> say<00:03:49.720> anything<00:03:49.799> about<00:03:50.910> it<00:03:51.910> being

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
actually say anything about it being

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:57.479 
actually say anything about it being
light<00:03:52.450> or<00:03:54.390> light<00:03:55.390> or<00:03:55.959> your<00:03:56.890> do<00:03:57.010> the<00:03:57.070> same<00:03:57.250> thing

00:03:57.479 --> 00:03:57.489 
light or light or your do the same thing

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:00.090 
light or light or your do the same thing
about<00:03:58.269> coverage<00:03:58.720> I<00:03:58.900> would<00:03:59.170> say<00:03:59.410> this<00:03:59.680> is<00:03:59.920> a

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:00.100 
about coverage I would say this is a

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:03.840 
about coverage I would say this is a
medium<00:04:00.519> coverage<00:04:00.760> but<00:04:01.650> more<00:04:02.650> so<00:04:02.890> towards<00:04:03.700> the

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:03.850 
medium coverage but more so towards the

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:06.600 
medium coverage but more so towards the
light<00:04:04.090> kind<00:04:04.570> of<00:04:04.660> area<00:04:05.010> because<00:04:06.010> you<00:04:06.430> can

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:06.610 
light kind of area because you can

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:08.759 
light kind of area because you can
easily<00:04:06.880> make<00:04:07.299> this<00:04:07.630> really<00:04:08.230> light<00:04:08.440> coverage

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:08.769 
easily make this really light coverage

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:11.100 
easily make this really light coverage
if<00:04:09.130> you<00:04:09.160> use<00:04:09.459> a<00:04:09.489> tiny<00:04:09.940> amount<00:04:10.390> and<00:04:10.600> it<00:04:10.780> is<00:04:10.810> gonna

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:11.110 
if you use a tiny amount and it is gonna

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:13.319 
if you use a tiny amount and it is gonna
work<00:04:11.200> really<00:04:11.620> well<00:04:11.890> and<00:04:12.220> you<00:04:12.579> can<00:04:12.610> also<00:04:12.940> build

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:13.329 
work really well and you can also build

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:15.509 
work really well and you can also build
it<00:04:13.540> up<00:04:13.600> really<00:04:13.840> easy<00:04:14.110> as<00:04:14.320> well<00:04:14.560> so<00:04:14.920> as<00:04:15.190> I<00:04:15.280> said

00:04:15.509 --> 00:04:15.519 
it up really easy as well so as I said

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:19.530 
it up really easy as well so as I said
the<00:04:15.640> color<00:04:15.790> that<00:04:16.030> I<00:04:16.060> have<00:04:16.479> is<00:04:16.840> w3<00:04:17.799> and<00:04:18.280> this<00:04:19.209> is

the color that I have is w3 and this is

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:21.840 
the color that I have is w3 and this is
a<00:04:19.900> perfect<00:04:20.620> match

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:25.620 
I don't think I've ever found a
foundation<00:04:24.160> that<00:04:24.460> the<00:04:24.670> color<00:04:24.910> just<00:04:25.150> matches

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:25.630 
foundation that the color just matches

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:27.330

more<00:05:34.180> breakouts<00:05:34.630> so<00:05:35.140> I<00:05:35.170> recommend<00:05:35.800> this

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:35.890 
more breakouts so I recommend this

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:38.400 
more breakouts so I recommend this
foundation<00:05:36.520> to<00:05:36.700> pretty<00:05:36.940> much<00:05:37.180> all<00:05:37.510> skin<00:05:37.930> types

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:38.410 
foundation to pretty much all skin types

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:40.920 
foundation to pretty much all skin types
except<00:05:39.220> for<00:05:39.400> maybe<00:05:39.580> really<00:05:40.120> really<00:05:40.750> oily

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:40.930 
except for maybe really really oily

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:43.500 
except for maybe really really oily
because<00:05:41.470> it<00:05:41.590> is<00:05:41.830> not<00:05:42.220> on<00:05:42.370> that<00:05:42.580> foundation<00:05:43.240> and

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:43.510 
because it is not on that foundation and

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:45.990 
because it is not on that foundation and
also<00:05:43.930> super<00:05:44.380> dry<00:05:44.560> skin<00:05:44.980> I<00:05:45.100> also<00:05:45.370> don't<00:05:45.640> think

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:46.000 
also super dry skin I also don't think

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.370 
also super dry skin I also don't think
this<00:05:46.180> is<00:05:46.210> going<00:05:46.420> to<00:05:46.480> be<00:05:46.600> suitable<00:05:46.870> just

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:47.380 
this is going to be suitable just

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:49.170 
this is going to be suitable just
because<00:05:47.740> it's<00:05:48.190> not<00:05:48.430> a<00:05:48.550> moisturizing

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:49.180 
because it's not a moisturizing

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:51.330 
because it's not a moisturizing
foundation<00:05:49.810> it<00:05:50.380> does<00:05:50.650> make<00:05:50.830> your<00:05:50.950> skin<00:05:51.280> feel

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:51.340 
foundation it does make your skin feel

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:53.520 
foundation it does make your skin feel
really<00:05:51.940> nice<00:05:52.090> kind<00:05:52.570> of<00:05:52.630> at<00:05:53.080> the<00:05:53.200> end<00:05:53.320> of<00:05:53.440> the

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:53.530 
really nice kind of at the end of the

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:55.470 
really nice kind of at the end of the
day<00:05:53.710> after<00:05:54.130> you<00:05:54.220> remove<00:05:54.490> it<00:05:54.520> it<00:05:54.790> does<00:05:55.060> not<00:05:55.090> feel

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:55.480 
day after you remove it it does not feel

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:57.270 
day after you remove it it does not feel
drying<00:05:55.900> or<00:05:56.290> nothing<00:05:56.560> like<00:05:56.680> that<00:05:56.740> but<00:05:57.160> it

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:57.280 
drying or nothing like that but it

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:59.760 
drying or nothing like that but it
doesn't<00:05:57.730> have<00:05:57.970> any<00:05:58.300> added<00:05:58.540> I<00:05:58.930> don't<00:05:59.560> think

00:05:59.760 --> 00:05:59.770 
doesn't have any added I don't think

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:03.180 
doesn't have any added I don't think
ingredients<00:06:00.490> that<00:06:01.650> will<00:06:02.650> show<00:06:02.800> your<00:06:02.920> skin

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:03.190 
ingredients that will show your skin

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:05.040 
ingredients that will show your skin
which<00:06:03.370> is<00:06:03.550> what<00:06:03.760> you<00:06:03.970> want<00:06:04.120> to<00:06:04.210> do<00:06:04.360> if<00:06:04.600> you<00:06:04.840> have

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:05.050 
which is what you want to do if you have

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:08.610 
which is what you want to do if you have
dry<00:06:05.320> skin<00:06:05.350> so<00:06:06.310> um<00:06:06.760> for<00:06:07.720> normal<00:06:08.050> skin<00:06:08.200> for

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:08.620 
dry skin so um for normal skin for

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:11.310 
dry skin so um for normal skin for
combination<00:06:09.400> for<00:06:09.850> dry<00:06:10.240> but<00:06:10.510> not<00:06:10.690> super<00:06:11.110> dry

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:11.320 
combination for dry but not super dry

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:14.100 
combination for dry but not super dry
for<00:06:11.590> oiling<00:06:11.950> it<00:06:12.130> but<00:06:12.310> not<00:06:12.430> super<00:06:13.030> oily<00:06:13.360> this

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:14.110 
for oiling it but not super oily this

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:16.200 
for oiling it but not super oily this
would<00:06:14.380> be<00:06:14.590> definitely<00:06:15.160> a<00:06:15.250> really<00:06:15.580> good<00:06:15.730> choice

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:16.210 
would be definitely a really good choice

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:18.150 
would be definitely a really good choice
now<00:06:16.870> I<00:06:16.900> haven't<00:06:17.200> actually<00:06:17.380> read<00:06:17.770> this<00:06:17.950> before

now I haven't actually read this before
on<00:06:18.640> packaging<00:06:19.180> but<00:06:20.050> it<00:06:20.200> does<00:06:20.380> say<00:06:20.680> that<00:06:20.740> this

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:21.190 
on packaging but it does say that this

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:24.210 
on packaging but it does say that this
this<00:06:22.000> foundation<00:06:22.630> infuses<00:06:23.470> skin<00:06:23.770> with<00:06:23.950> a<00:06:23.980> ray

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:24.220 
this foundation infuses skin with a ray

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:26.550 
this foundation infuses skin with a ray
of<00:06:24.250> light<00:06:24.570> illuminating<00:06:25.570> your<00:06:25.690> complexion<00:06:26.080> as

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:30.040 
if lit from within and this does

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:32.310 
if lit from within and this does
actually<00:06:30.490> describe<00:06:30.970> what<00:06:31.720> the<00:06:31.840> foundation

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:32.320 
actually describe what the foundation

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:33.370 
actually describe what the foundation
does<00:06:32.500> which<00:06:32.830> is<00:06:32.860> really

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:33.380 
does which is really

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:35.170 
does which is really
great<00:06:33.560> because<00:06:34.010> usually<00:06:34.220> the<00:06:34.580> drugstore<00:06:35.150> you

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:35.180 
great because usually the drugstore you

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:37.180 
great because usually the drugstore you
don't<00:06:35.540> get<00:06:35.750> what<00:06:36.050> they<00:06:36.230> say<00:06:36.560> in<00:06:36.620> the<00:06:36.740> packaging

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:37.190 
don't get what they say in the packaging

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:39.370 
don't get what they say in the packaging
I<00:06:37.310> mean<00:06:37.490> I<00:06:37.730> don't<00:06:38.240> ever<00:06:38.570> get<00:06:38.780> what<00:06:39.080> they<00:06:39.200> say

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:39.380 
I mean I don't ever get what they say

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:42.100 
I mean I don't ever get what they say
it's<00:06:40.310> pretty<00:06:40.400> much<00:06:40.700> all<00:06:40.940> made<00:06:41.120> up<00:06:41.330> like<00:06:41.600> fancy

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:42.110 
it's pretty much all made up like fancy

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:45.760 
it's pretty much all made up like fancy
words<00:06:42.500> but<00:06:43.280> with<00:06:43.490> this<00:06:43.700> it<00:06:44.000> does<00:06:44.060> actually<00:06:44.810> now

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:45.770 
words but with this it does actually now

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:47.440 
words but with this it does actually now
that<00:06:45.950> I<00:06:45.980> think<00:06:46.040> about<00:06:46.370> it<00:06:46.640> it<00:06:46.730> does<00:06:46.970> actually

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:47.450 
that I think about it it does actually

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:49.900 
that I think about it it does actually
give<00:06:47.600> you<00:06:47.720> that<00:06:47.810> kind<00:06:48.260> of<00:06:48.640> really<00:06:49.640> radiant
