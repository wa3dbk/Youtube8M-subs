00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
360 block it's going to be coming in a

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.640 
360 block it's going to be coming in a
circular<00:00:27.330> fashion<00:00:27.599> and<00:00:28.260> we're<00:00:28.380> just<00:00:28.439> going<00:00:28.619> to

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
circular fashion and we're just going to

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:29.960 
circular fashion and we're just going to
imagine<00:00:28.920> that<00:00:29.189> he's<00:00:29.279> trying<00:00:29.460> to<00:00:29.580> stab<00:00:29.820> me

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
imagine that he's trying to stab me

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.429 
imagine that he's trying to stab me
directly<00:00:30.330> in<00:00:30.420> the<00:00:30.510> neck<00:00:30.779> right<00:00:31.050> there

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
directly in the neck right there

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.889 
directly in the neck right there
now<00:00:31.769> we<00:00:32.340> know<00:00:32.579> that<00:00:33.030> if<00:00:33.239> I<00:00:33.360> use<00:00:33.510> a<00:00:33.540> good

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
now we know that if I use a good

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.799 
now we know that if I use a good
bursting<00:00:34.829> 360<00:00:35.460> block<00:00:35.730> I<00:00:36.090> should<00:00:36.450> be<00:00:36.570> able<00:00:36.660> to

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
bursting 360 block I should be able to

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.260 
bursting 360 block I should be able to
block<00:00:37.020> stop<00:00:38.010> his<00:00:38.190> forward<00:00:38.489> progress<00:00:38.670> and<00:00:39.120> get

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
block stop his forward progress and get

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.869 
block stop his forward progress and get
away<00:00:39.510> so<00:00:39.840> in<00:00:40.140> a<00:00:40.469> perfect<00:00:40.920> world<00:00:41.129> I<00:00:41.489> would

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
away so in a perfect world I would

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.420 
away so in a perfect world I would
either<00:00:42.140> block<00:00:43.140> there<00:00:43.500> or<00:00:43.920> I'm<00:00:44.160> going<00:00:44.280> to<00:00:44.309> go

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
either block there or I'm going to go

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.549 
either block there or I'm going to go
two<00:00:44.879> on<00:00:44.910> one<00:00:45.360> and<00:00:45.660> then<00:00:46.079> just<00:00:46.230> get<00:00:46.379> out<00:00:46.530> of

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
two on one and then just get out of

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.380 
two on one and then just get out of
there<00:00:46.800> okay<00:00:47.070> but<00:00:47.489> we're<00:00:47.670> just<00:00:47.700> assuming<00:00:48.239> that

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
there okay but we're just assuming that

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.360 
there okay but we're just assuming that
I<00:00:48.420> absolutely<00:00:48.660> must<00:00:49.440> deal<00:00:49.829> with<00:00:50.010> this<00:00:50.129> thing

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
I absolutely must deal with this thing

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.400 
I absolutely must deal with this thing
and<00:00:50.520> see<00:00:50.730> it<00:00:50.850> all<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.149> way<00:00:51.270> through<00:00:51.600> to<00:00:52.289> the

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
and see it all the way through to the

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:53.540 
and see it all the way through to the
disarm<00:00:52.800> so<00:00:52.949> that's<00:00:53.100> what<00:00:53.190> we're<00:00:53.280> going<00:00:53.370> to<00:00:53.430> be

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
disarm so that's what we're going to be

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.279 
disarm so that's what we're going to be
covering<00:00:53.760> so<00:00:54.390> when<00:00:54.600> I<00:00:54.629> do<00:00:54.750> this<00:00:55.050> it's

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
covering so when I do this it's

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.110 
covering so when I do this it's
important<00:00:55.710> to<00:00:55.800> remember<00:00:56.010> we<00:00:56.370> have<00:00:56.399> to<00:00:56.820> train

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
important to remember we have to train

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.389 
important to remember we have to train
with<00:00:57.360> realistic<00:00:57.899> angles<00:00:58.649> one<00:00:59.070> of<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.219> most

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
with realistic angles one of the most

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.099 
with realistic angles one of the most
common<00:00:59.730> mistakes<00:00:59.879> people<00:01:00.149> make<00:01:00.359> is<00:01:00.690> they're

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
common mistakes people make is they're

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.810 
common mistakes people make is they're
too<00:01:01.260> nice<00:01:01.530> to<00:01:01.770> their<00:01:01.890> partner<00:01:02.250> so<00:01:02.460> he's<00:01:02.640> like

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
too nice to their partner so he's like

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.280 
too nice to their partner so he's like
dinner<00:01:03.030> try<00:01:03.180> to<00:01:03.239> hit<00:01:03.420> me<00:01:03.449> with<00:01:03.570> his<00:01:03.840> arm<00:01:04.049> or

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
dinner try to hit me with his arm or

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.600 
dinner try to hit me with his arm or
something<00:01:04.619> where<00:01:04.769> I<00:01:04.799> don't<00:01:04.920> really<00:01:05.159> have<00:01:05.460> to

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
something where I don't really have to

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.640 
something where I don't really have to
change<00:01:06.210> my<00:01:06.390> angle<00:01:06.720> it's<00:01:06.869> just<00:01:07.020> super<00:01:07.290> easy<00:01:07.320> to

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
change my angle it's just super easy to

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.530 
change my angle it's just super easy to
block<00:01:07.830> it<00:01:08.070> if<00:01:08.220> he's<00:01:08.549> actually<00:01:08.790> aiming<00:01:09.240> let's

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
block it if he's actually aiming let's

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.090 
block it if he's actually aiming let's
watch<00:01:09.720> what<00:01:09.900> his<00:01:09.990> angle<00:01:10.260> looks<00:01:10.439> like<00:01:10.619> okay

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
watch what his angle looks like okay

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.800 
watch what his angle looks like okay
that's<00:01:11.369> great<00:01:11.580> so<00:01:12.090> if<00:01:12.210> I'm<00:01:12.330> blocking<00:01:12.659> like

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
that's great so if I'm blocking like

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.560 
that's great so if I'm blocking like
this<00:01:13.049> go<00:01:13.439> ahead<00:01:13.850> he's<00:01:14.850> going<00:01:15.030> to<00:01:15.090> power<00:01:15.240> right

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
this go ahead he's going to power right

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.510 
this go ahead he's going to power right
through<00:01:15.780> there<00:01:15.930> so<00:01:16.770> it's<00:01:16.920> important<00:01:17.369> that<00:01:17.400> I

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
through there so it's important that I

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.300 
through there so it's important that I
move<00:01:17.759> forward<00:01:18.180> and<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:19.020> turn<00:01:19.530> so<00:01:20.009> I'm<00:01:20.159> not

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
move forward and the turn so I'm not

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.410 
move forward and the turn so I'm not
just<00:01:20.520> walking<00:01:20.700> straight<00:01:21.180> out<00:01:21.420> I'm<00:01:22.380> turning

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
just walking straight out I'm turning

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.420 
just walking straight out I'm turning
moving<00:01:24.420> forward<00:01:24.810> and<00:01:24.930> jamming<00:01:25.830> it<00:01:25.950> that<00:01:26.280> way

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
moving forward and jamming it that way

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.370 
moving forward and jamming it that way
my<00:01:26.580> body<00:01:26.820> is<00:01:27.119> directly<00:01:27.479> behind<00:01:27.689> both<00:01:28.080> of<00:01:28.140> my

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
my body is directly behind both of my

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.370 
my body is directly behind both of my
blocks<00:01:28.680> here<00:01:28.979> I'm<00:01:29.130> using<00:01:29.460> my<00:01:29.820> ulna<00:01:30.360> bones<00:01:30.659> my

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
blocks here I'm using my ulna bones my

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.800 
blocks here I'm using my ulna bones my
one<00:01:31.650> closest<00:01:32.250> to<00:01:32.280> his<00:01:32.610> centerline<00:01:33.180> is<00:01:33.360> going

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
one closest to his centerline is going

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.090 
one closest to his centerline is going
to<00:01:33.869> be<00:01:33.960> blocking<00:01:34.229> right<00:01:34.560> in<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.799> middle<00:01:34.979> of

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
to be blocking right in the middle of

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.399 
to be blocking right in the middle of
the<00:01:35.159> bicep<00:01:35.640> my<00:01:36.299> other<00:01:36.540> one<00:01:36.810> closest<00:01:37.259> to<00:01:37.290> the

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
the bicep my other one closest to the

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.230 
the bicep my other one closest to the
knife<00:01:37.710> is<00:01:37.979> going<00:01:38.250> to<00:01:38.369> be<00:01:38.460> blocking<00:01:38.700> right<00:01:39.030> in

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
knife is going to be blocking right in

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.539 
knife is going to be blocking right in
between<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:40.020> crook<00:01:40.290> of<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.530> elbow<00:01:40.560> and<00:01:41.009> the

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
between the crook of the elbow and the

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.170 
between the crook of the elbow and the
wrist<00:01:41.579> so<00:01:42.329> that<00:01:42.360> placement<00:01:42.990> looks<00:01:43.079> like<00:01:43.290> this

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.180 
wrist so that placement looks like this

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:48.920 
wrist so that placement looks like this
moving<00:01:45.180> in<00:01:46.280> turning<00:01:47.280> and<00:01:47.460> jamming<00:01:48.060> now<00:01:48.509> we're

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
moving in turning and jamming now we're

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.780 
moving in turning and jamming now we're
not<00:01:49.049> doing<00:01:49.229> this<00:01:49.439> too<00:01:49.680> hard<00:01:49.890> if<00:01:50.159> you<00:01:50.579> do<00:01:50.700> it

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
not doing this too hard if you do it

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.190 
not doing this too hard if you do it
even<00:01:51.060> just<00:01:51.329> a<00:01:51.420> little<00:01:51.450> bit<00:01:51.689> harder<00:01:52.049> than<00:01:52.110> that

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
even just a little bit harder than that

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.289 
even just a little bit harder than that
it<00:01:52.590> can<00:01:52.860> really<00:01:53.100> deaden<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:53.640> arm<00:01:53.909> so<00:01:54.149> that's

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
it can really deaden the arm so that's

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:55.850 
it can really deaden the arm so that's
an<00:01:54.450> effect<00:01:54.720> that<00:01:54.780> we're<00:01:55.290> really<00:01:55.439> looking<00:01:55.530> for

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
an effect that we're really looking for

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.300 
an effect that we're really looking for
so<00:01:56.520> I<00:01:56.549> move<00:01:56.820> in<00:01:57.030> twist<00:01:57.390> jam<00:01:58.170> from<00:01:58.799> there<00:01:59.009> I'm

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
so I move in twist jam from there I'm

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.609 
so I move in twist jam from there I'm
immediately<00:01:59.969> want<00:02:00.240> to<00:02:00.299> take<00:02:00.450> my<00:02:00.600> hand<00:02:01.110> closest

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
immediately want to take my hand closest

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.440 
immediately want to take my hand closest
to<00:02:01.740> the<00:02:01.829> knife<00:02:02.009> and<00:02:02.280> just<00:02:02.700> simply<00:02:02.969> grab<00:02:03.270> them

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
to the knife and just simply grab them

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.870 
to the knife and just simply grab them
to<00:02:03.600> see<00:02:03.780> clamping<00:02:04.259> his<00:02:04.500> wrist<00:02:04.890> and<00:02:05.100> now<00:02:05.579> I<00:02:05.610> need

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
to see clamping his wrist and now I need

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.700 
to see clamping his wrist and now I need
to<00:02:05.969> assume<00:02:06.240> that<00:02:06.450> while<00:02:06.659> I<00:02:06.689> may<00:02:07.020> have<00:02:07.229> deadened

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
to assume that while I may have deadened

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.240 
to assume that while I may have deadened
his<00:02:07.890> arm<00:02:08.099> it<00:02:08.399> might<00:02:08.759> be<00:02:08.910> tingling<00:02:09.330> or<00:02:09.599> number

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
his arm it might be tingling or number

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.040 
his arm it might be tingling or number
and<00:02:10.340> pain<00:02:10.640> he's<00:02:11.240> still<00:02:11.480> in<00:02:11.600> the<00:02:11.690> fight<00:02:11.900> though

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
and pain he's still in the fight though

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:13.960 
and pain he's still in the fight though
he<00:02:12.230> can<00:02:12.380> still<00:02:12.590> wrap<00:02:12.860> up<00:02:13.070> he<00:02:13.280> can<00:02:13.400> still<00:02:13.670> do

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
he can still wrap up he can still do

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:15.820 
he can still wrap up he can still do
something<00:02:14.270> so<00:02:14.570> I've<00:02:14.720> got<00:02:14.930> to<00:02:15.020> really<00:02:15.440> really

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
something so I've got to really really

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:16.810 
something so I've got to really really
go<00:02:16.070> quickly

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:16.820 
go quickly

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:19.750 
go quickly

myself and wrap around his arm now it's

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.430 
myself and wrap around his arm now it's
important<00:02:59.150> if<00:02:59.270> it's<00:02:59.420> a<00:02:59.540> big<00:02:59.750> guy<00:02:59.959> like<00:03:00.200> this

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
important if it's a big guy like this

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.680 
important if it's a big guy like this
sometimes<00:03:01.160> it<00:03:01.280> can<00:03:01.370> be<00:03:01.400> difficult<00:03:01.520> to<00:03:02.150> bend

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
sometimes it can be difficult to bend

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:05.050 
sometimes it can be difficult to bend
the<00:03:02.870> arm<00:03:03.080> so<00:03:03.560> if<00:03:03.680> I<00:03:03.770> go<00:03:03.950> straight<00:03:04.220> around<00:03:04.790> his

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
the arm so if I go straight around his

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:06.550 
the arm so if I go straight around his
arm<00:03:05.270> and<00:03:05.540> grab<00:03:05.870> my<00:03:06.050> own<00:03:06.170> wrist

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
arm and grab my own wrist

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.590 
arm and grab my own wrist
sometimes<00:03:07.310> I<00:03:07.459> go<00:03:07.580> to<00:03:07.610> turn<00:03:07.880> back<00:03:08.060> towards<00:03:08.360> him

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600 
sometimes I go to turn back towards him

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.140 
sometimes I go to turn back towards him
and<00:03:08.840> his<00:03:09.500> arm<00:03:09.680> isn't<00:03:09.860> moving<00:03:10.160> his<00:03:10.730> arms<00:03:11.000> too

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
and his arm isn't moving his arms too

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:12.790 
and his arm isn't moving his arms too
long<00:03:11.360> so<00:03:11.810> I<00:03:11.840> need<00:03:12.020> to<00:03:12.080> be<00:03:12.200> sure<00:03:12.230> that<00:03:12.500> I<00:03:12.560> bend

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:12.800 
long so I need to be sure that I bend

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.979 
long so I need to be sure that I bend
his<00:03:12.950> arm<00:03:13.070> first<00:03:13.400> so<00:03:13.640> how<00:03:13.760> I<00:03:13.790> achieve<00:03:14.180> that<00:03:14.209> is<00:03:14.540> I

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:14.989 
his arm first so how I achieve that is I

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:16.750 
his arm first so how I achieve that is I
take<00:03:15.019> my<00:03:15.230> thumb<00:03:15.620> kind<00:03:15.950> of<00:03:16.010> like<00:03:16.100> my<00:03:16.250> ridge<00:03:16.489> hand

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
take my thumb kind of like my ridge hand

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.240 
take my thumb kind of like my ridge hand
surface<00:03:17.239> I<00:03:17.450> wrap<00:03:18.050> around<00:03:18.080> right<00:03:18.860> in<00:03:18.890> the<00:03:19.070> crook

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
surface I wrap around right in the crook

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.360 
surface I wrap around right in the crook
of<00:03:19.370> the<00:03:19.459> elbow<00:03:19.489> I<00:03:20.060> hit<00:03:20.600> that<00:03:20.810> that<00:03:21.350> bends<00:03:21.709> it<00:03:21.950> so

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
of the elbow I hit that that bends it so

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:24.280 
of the elbow I hit that that bends it so
I'm<00:03:22.459> pointing<00:03:23.390> the<00:03:23.600> nice<00:03:23.780> essentially
