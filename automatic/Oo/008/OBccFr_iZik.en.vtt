this<00:00:14.700> is<00:00:14.910> the<00:00:15.059> new<00:00:15.539> Aston<00:00:16.260> Martin<00:00:16.619> Rapide<00:00:16.800> s

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
this is the new Aston Martin Rapide s

this is the new Aston Martin Rapide s
and<00:00:17.759> if<00:00:18.060> you're<00:00:18.180> thinking<00:00:18.330> to<00:00:18.599> yourself<00:00:18.930> well

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
and if you're thinking to yourself well

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.170 
and if you're thinking to yourself well
I<00:00:19.710> can<00:00:20.040> see<00:00:20.160> it<00:00:20.250> has<00:00:20.400> a<00:00:20.430> new<00:00:20.669> grille<00:00:20.970> but

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
I can see it has a new grille but

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.790 
I can see it has a new grille but
otherwise<00:00:21.570> it<00:00:21.840> doesn't<00:00:21.990> look<00:00:22.230> particularly

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
otherwise it doesn't look particularly

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.170 
otherwise it doesn't look particularly
new<00:00:23.310> to<00:00:23.550> me<00:00:23.789> I'd<00:00:24.539> rather<00:00:24.720> take<00:00:25.020> your<00:00:25.230> point

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:26.180 
new to me I'd rather take your point

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.999 
new to me I'd rather take your point
that's<00:00:27.180> because<00:00:27.450> Aston<00:00:28.020> Martin<00:00:28.439> doesn't<00:00:28.770> make

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:29.009 
that's because Aston Martin doesn't make

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:31.370 
that's because Aston Martin doesn't make

we'll put new carpets in the West Wing

we'll put new carpets in the West Wing
it's<00:00:53.999> just<00:00:54.329> very<00:00:55.079> small<00:00:55.530> incremental<00:00:56.429> gradual

00:00:56.989 --> 00:00:56.999 
it's just very small incremental gradual

it's just very small incremental gradual
changes<00:00:58.339> now<00:00:59.339> the<00:00:59.399> big<00:00:59.640> change<00:01:00.030> this<00:01:00.239> time<00:01:00.479> is

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
changes now the big change this time is

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.709 
changes now the big change this time is
that<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:00.899> engine<00:01:01.640> 62<00:01:02.640> v12<00:01:03.149> naturally

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
that the engine 62 v12 naturally

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.479 
that the engine 62 v12 naturally
aspirated<00:01:03.960> has<00:01:04.440> great<00:01:04.680> engine<00:01:05.010> and<00:01:05.159> now<00:01:05.280> makes

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
aspirated has great engine and now makes

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:06.890 
aspirated has great engine and now makes
80<00:01:05.700> horsepower<00:01:05.970> more<00:01:06.420> than<00:01:06.570> it<00:01:06.659> did<00:01:06.750> before

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
80 horsepower more than it did before

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.109 
80 horsepower more than it did before
this<00:01:07.650> is<00:01:07.830> a<00:01:07.880> 550

00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:10.119 
this is a 550

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:12.029 
this is a 550
which<00:01:10.659> means<00:01:10.929> it'll<00:01:11.109> do<00:01:11.259> 60<00:01:11.649> in<00:01:11.740> less<00:01:11.890> than

00:01:12.029 --> 00:01:12.039 
which means it'll do 60 in less than

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:14.429 
which means it'll do 60 in less than
five<00:01:12.250> seconds<00:01:12.729> it'll<00:01:13.000> go<00:01:13.149> on<00:01:13.179> to<00:01:13.420> 190<00:01:14.170> miles<00:01:14.350> an

00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:14.439 
five seconds it'll go on to 190 miles an

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:16.770 
five seconds it'll go on to 190 miles an
hour<00:01:14.560> but<00:01:14.920> probably<00:01:15.700> as<00:01:15.880> importantly<00:01:16.420> that

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780 
hour but probably as importantly that

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.980 
hour but probably as importantly that
engine<00:01:17.140> sits<00:01:17.640> 19<00:01:18.640> millimeters<00:01:19.240> lower<00:01:19.539> in<00:01:19.869> the

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 
engine sits 19 millimeters lower in the

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.319 
engine sits 19 millimeters lower in the
chassis<00:01:20.200> now<00:01:20.439> as<00:01:21.369> benefits<00:01:21.850> for<00:01:22.000> the<00:01:22.060> center

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:22.329 
chassis now as benefits for the center

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:24.380 
chassis now as benefits for the center
of<00:01:22.450> gravity<00:01:22.539> but<00:01:22.960> it<00:01:23.079> also<00:01:23.289> crucially

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
of gravity but it also crucially

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.059 
of gravity but it also crucially
benefits<00:01:25.390> pedestrian<00:01:26.020> impact<00:01:26.500> protection

00:01:27.059 --> 00:01:27.069 
benefits pedestrian impact protection

00:01:27.069 --> 00:01:29.520 
benefits pedestrian impact protection
and<00:01:27.399> that's<00:01:27.640> one<00:01:28.539> of<00:01:28.569> the<00:01:28.719> reasons<00:01:29.049> behind<00:01:29.170> all

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:29.530 
and that's one of the reasons behind all

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:31.200 
and that's one of the reasons behind all
those<00:01:29.649> changes

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.210 
those changes

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.600 
those changes
but<00:01:32.020> they're<00:01:32.140> all<00:01:32.290> detail<00:01:32.799> changes<00:01:33.400> and<00:01:33.549> you

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:33.610 
but they're all detail changes and you

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:35.100 
but they're all detail changes and you
know<00:01:33.729> what<00:01:33.940> as<00:01:34.090> you<00:01:34.119> sit<00:01:34.479> in<00:01:34.659> the<00:01:34.810> front<00:01:34.840> seat

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110 
know what as you sit in the front seat

for<00:01:39.580> not<00:01:39.880> noticing<00:01:40.810> very<00:01:41.170> many<00:01:41.409> of<00:01:41.500> them<00:01:41.710> I

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:41.860 
for not noticing very many of them I

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:43.440 
for not noticing very many of them I
mean<00:01:42.070> it's<00:01:42.159> still<00:01:42.310> very<00:01:42.460> listening<00:01:43.300> in<00:01:43.360> the

mean it's still very listening in the

mean it's still very listening in the

front the back so case lie difficult to
get<00:01:45.700> into<00:01:45.880> but<00:01:46.270> it's<00:01:46.390> quite<00:01:46.570> comfortable<00:01:46.810> when

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:47.080 
get into but it's quite comfortable when

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:52.330 
most of this astronaut Eve remains as it

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.080 
most of this astronaut Eve remains as it
was<00:01:52.479> before<00:01:52.690> and<00:01:53.140> that<00:01:53.320> includes<00:01:53.890> Aston<00:01:54.850> says

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
was before and that includes Aston says

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.050 
was before and that includes Aston says
the<00:01:55.690> fact<00:01:55.990> that<00:01:56.080> it<00:01:56.290> is<00:01:56.470> still<00:01:56.770> a<00:01:57.130> sports<00:01:57.790> car

the fact that it is still a sports car
at<00:01:58.300> heart<00:01:59.550> so<00:02:00.550> the<00:02:00.610> question<00:02:00.970> is<00:02:01.119> can<00:02:01.930> a<00:02:01.990> 2-ton

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:20.590 

and<00:02:13.160> the<00:02:13.400> answer<00:02:14.950> is<00:02:16.120> yeah<00:02:17.120> absolutely<00:02:19.510> it's<00:02:20.510> a

and the answer is yeah absolutely it's a

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.530 
and the answer is yeah absolutely it's a
heavy<00:02:20.810> car<00:02:21.140> but<00:02:21.550> the<00:02:22.550> weight<00:02:22.760> is<00:02:23.030> so<00:02:23.270> well

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
heavy car but the weight is so well

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.330 
heavy car but the weight is so well
distributed<00:02:24.200> between<00:02:24.320> the<00:02:24.590> two<00:02:24.740> axles

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
distributed between the two axles

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.130 
distributed between the two axles
he<00:02:25.970> is<00:02:26.150> just<00:02:26.450> perfectly<00:02:27.440> balanced

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
he is just perfectly balanced

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:34.840 
he is just perfectly balanced
that<00:02:29.770> engine<00:02:30.280> is<00:02:31.200> absolutely<00:02:32.200> stupendous

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.750 

but<00:02:35.360> the<00:02:35.510> handling<00:02:35.960> balance<00:02:36.350> is<00:02:36.530> just<00:02:36.760> sublime

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
but the handling balance is just sublime

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.420 
but the handling balance is just sublime
and<00:02:38.210> it's<00:02:38.330> got<00:02:38.450> a<00:02:38.480> big<00:02:38.660> long<00:02:38.780> wheelbase<00:02:39.430> the

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
and it's got a big long wheelbase the

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:45.100 
and it's got a big long wheelbase the
Indians<00:02:40.790> where<00:02:40.970> you<00:02:41.090> want<00:02:41.240> it<00:02:41.330> to<00:02:41.420> be
