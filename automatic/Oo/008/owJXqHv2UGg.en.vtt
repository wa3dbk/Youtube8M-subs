look realistic is mainly about trying to

turned<00:00:37.020> upside<00:00:37.410> down<00:00:37.940> the<00:00:38.940> specific<00:00:39.390> question

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
turned upside down the specific question

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.869 
turned upside down the specific question
was<00:00:40.110> about<00:00:40.230> the<00:00:40.379> continents<00:00:41.129> of<00:00:41.219> my<00:00:41.399> world<00:00:41.640> map

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
was about the continents of my world map

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.360 
was about the continents of my world map
and<00:00:42.180> how<00:00:42.510> they<00:00:42.719> look<00:00:42.930> realistic<00:00:43.649> like<00:00:44.010> some

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
and how they look realistic like some

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.420 
and how they look realistic like some
land<00:00:44.640> masses<00:00:44.910> broke<00:00:45.840> away<00:00:46.020> from<00:00:46.200> other<00:00:47.070> land

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
land masses broke away from other land

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.150 
land masses broke away from other land
masses<00:00:47.850> and<00:00:48.390> that's<00:00:49.289> really<00:00:49.680> all<00:00:49.829> there<00:00:49.980> is<00:00:50.039> to

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
masses and that's really all there is to

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.889 
masses and that's really all there is to
it<00:00:50.520> I'm<00:00:50.700> no<00:00:51.030> geologist

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
it I'm no geologist

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.540 
it I'm no geologist
I<00:00:51.960> just<00:00:52.170> started<00:00:52.559> by<00:00:52.710> drawing<00:00:52.770> some<00:00:53.309> shapes

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
I just started by drawing some shapes

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.880 
I just started by drawing some shapes
then<00:00:54.000> in<00:00:54.329> a<00:00:54.390> few<00:00:54.539> places<00:00:54.809> I<00:00:55.110> made<00:00:55.289> shapes<00:00:55.620> that

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
then in a few places I made shapes that

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.350 
then in a few places I made shapes that
looked<00:00:56.100> a<00:00:56.280> little<00:00:56.309> bit<00:00:56.789> like<00:00:57.030> they<00:00:57.210> were

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
looked a little bit like they were

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.319 
looked a little bit like they were
carved<00:00:57.660> out<00:00:58.020> of<00:00:58.230> those<00:00:58.410> first<00:00:58.800> shapes<00:00:59.329> the

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
carved out of those first shapes the

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.270 
carved out of those first shapes the
rest<00:01:00.570> is<00:01:00.930> mainly<00:01:01.500> roughing<00:01:02.100> up<00:01:02.219> the

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
rest is mainly roughing up the

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.160 
rest is mainly roughing up the
coastlines<00:01:02.850> until<00:01:03.270> you<00:01:03.390> are<00:01:03.480> happy<00:01:03.719> with<00:01:03.899> the

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
coastlines until you are happy with the

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.399 
coastlines until you are happy with the
result<00:01:05.090> the<00:01:06.090> important<00:01:06.510> things<00:01:06.750> are<00:01:06.990> don't

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
result the important things are don't

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.500 
result the important things are don't
make<00:01:07.650> them<00:01:07.830> fit<00:01:08.100> to<00:01:08.490> exactly

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
make them fit to exactly

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.600 
make them fit to exactly
unless<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:09.960> land<00:01:10.170> masses<00:01:10.409> are<00:01:10.740> very<00:01:11.250> close

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
unless the land masses are very close

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.060 
unless the land masses are very close
together<00:01:11.850> and<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.990> break<00:01:13.200> was<00:01:13.409> very<00:01:13.619> recent

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
together and the break was very recent

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.520 
together and the break was very recent
and<00:01:14.220> don't<00:01:15.030> make<00:01:15.150> everything<00:01:15.540> seem<00:01:15.960> to<00:01:16.259> fit

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
and don't make everything seem to fit

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.800 
and don't make everything seem to fit
together<00:01:16.710> like<00:01:16.950> a<00:01:17.159> big<00:01:17.430> puzzle<00:01:17.630> you<00:01:18.630> want<00:01:18.780> a

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
together like a big puzzle you want a

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.660 
together like a big puzzle you want a
few<00:01:19.020> bits<00:01:19.229> that<00:01:19.590> look<00:01:19.860> like<00:01:20.040> they<00:01:20.250> probably

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
few bits that look like they probably

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.690 
few bits that look like they probably
fit<00:01:21.270> together<00:01:21.659> a<00:01:21.780> long<00:01:22.049> time<00:01:22.110> ago<00:01:22.710> and<00:01:22.979> a<00:01:23.009> lot

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
fit together a long time ago and a lot

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.370 
fit together a long time ago and a lot
of<00:01:23.729> parts<00:01:24.030> that<00:01:24.299> are<00:01:24.420> just<00:01:24.450> doing<00:01:25.049> their<00:01:25.350> own

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
of parts that are just doing their own

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.620 
of parts that are just doing their own
thing<00:01:25.890> and<00:01:26.159> hopefully<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.240> viewer<00:01:27.420> will

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
thing and hopefully the viewer will

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.260 
thing and hopefully the viewer will
subconsciously<00:01:28.229> see<00:01:28.920> that<00:01:29.280> all<00:01:29.520> as<00:01:29.549> making

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
subconsciously see that all as making

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.300 
subconsciously see that all as making
sense<00:01:30.630> because<00:01:31.049> that's<00:01:31.380> kind<00:01:31.770> of<00:01:31.860> how<00:01:32.009> Earth's

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
sense because that's kind of how Earth's

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.539 
sense because that's kind of how Earth's
continents<00:01:32.790> are<00:01:33.590> it's<00:01:34.590> not<00:01:34.770> too<00:01:34.979> hard<00:01:35.220> to<00:01:35.280> make

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
continents are it's not too hard to make

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.730

that<00:03:00.909> wasn't<00:03:01.239> much<00:03:01.390> of<00:03:01.420> a<00:03:01.599> guide<00:03:01.810> but<00:03:02.290> I<00:03:02.440> think

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:02.829 
that wasn't much of a guide but I think

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:04.559 
that wasn't much of a guide but I think
if<00:03:02.950> you<00:03:03.069> keep<00:03:03.250> those<00:03:03.459> ideas<00:03:03.700> in<00:03:04.060> mind<00:03:04.299> while

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:04.569 
if you keep those ideas in mind while

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:06.300 
if you keep those ideas in mind while
working<00:03:04.840> on<00:03:05.079> your<00:03:05.290> own<00:03:05.319> map<00:03:05.680> it<00:03:06.069> should

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
working on your own map it should

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.099 
working on your own map it should
definitely<00:03:06.549> help<00:03:07.120> you<00:03:07.239> get<00:03:07.450> some<00:03:07.629> results<00:03:07.750> you

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:08.109 
definitely help you get some results you

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:10.020 
definitely help you get some results you
can<00:03:08.260> be<00:03:08.349> proud<00:03:08.590> of<00:03:08.829> the<00:03:09.519> other<00:03:09.670> thing<00:03:09.940> you

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
can be proud of the other thing you

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.869 
can be proud of the other thing you
remember<00:03:10.390> is<00:03:10.540> try<00:03:11.470> to<00:03:11.500> avoid<00:03:11.709> spending<00:03:12.489> too

00:03:12.869 --> 00:03:12.879 
remember is try to avoid spending too

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:14.640 
remember is try to avoid spending too
much<00:03:12.909> time<00:03:13.150> adding<00:03:13.780> detail<00:03:14.140> to<00:03:14.170> the<00:03:14.470> map

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
much time adding detail to the map

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.410 
much time adding detail to the map
whether<00:03:15.250> you're<00:03:15.459> writing<00:03:15.640> a<00:03:15.790> novel<00:03:16.000> or

jamming a role-playing game I find it's

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.309 
jamming a role-playing game I find it's
usually<00:03:18.459> better<00:03:18.730> to<00:03:18.849> leave<00:03:19.180> space<00:03:19.599> for<00:03:19.630> adding
