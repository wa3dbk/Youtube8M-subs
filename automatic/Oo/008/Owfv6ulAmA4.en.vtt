00:00:12.909 --> 00:00:18.680
 hello today unpacking here 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:20.870
 this probably all well known and 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:23.750
 restrained and tried by all in 

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:26.180
 quadric hood 816 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:28.910
 and yet I decided to order it, and 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:36.649
 look at what old our model 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:39.109
 that she is capable because 818 is mine 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:41.329
 even surprised nothing really expected 

00:00:39.109 --> 00:00:45.249
 from him more is possible from this model 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:49.300
 you can expect something more kit 

00:00:45.249 --> 00:00:53.420
 includes instructions for that everything is clear a 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:54.979
 the processor is exactly the same 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:58.159
 only missing a pair of buttons 

00:00:54.979 --> 00:01:00.729
 here is a side button too 

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:07.100
 plans and here unscrews 

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:09.110
 so himself quadric quadric spare hemp 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.590
 as I understood, but to us, if we found 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.110
 take off 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.910
 I understood everything with him we remove all 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:19.570
 protection then this to the cannon us separately 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:23.860
 had put exactly yes there is a hole 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:27.160
 well, in short, either green or blue 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:31.070
 square quadric charge 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:35.300
 so funny with bulbs and here 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:36.440
 the tip is inserted well actually normal 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:39.560
 standard complete set of all 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:41.300
 quadcopter okay then try it 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:46.400
 run 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:49.040
 and then 67 stabilization should should 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:52.640
 pretty good pretty pretty 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:54.760
 good to fly which side we have 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:58.490
 probably with any 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:02:02.440
 here everything is plastic no 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:09.010
 There are no soft spring rezinochek 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:14.500
 on the contrary, it’s pretty normal 

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:18.760
 so you need to visit the equipment set 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:23.410
 so here is 818 about nothing surprised 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.410
 so let's see how this flies 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:33.650
 maybe 100 will be cool maybe 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:35.560
 what else is better may be worse how how 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:43.810
 939 opened. 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:43.810
 just awful so ready 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:52.970
 and this is some kind of Turk there is one not 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.400
 it is necessary here again we have one fashion 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:57.940
 perhaps we are spending 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:01.640
 let 's mods on 2 sims will somehow 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:06.440
 better this is our coup and 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:09.740
 most likely go I do not know what is all 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:15.760
 squeaked I don’t know what then 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:18.680
 let's see so no he needs to do it 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.100
 so no lighting as I understood it is not 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.870
 him 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:25.340
 and here is one she found in front and all 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:28.150
 there is nothing more therefore night flights on 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.150
 he will be gone 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.620
 signboards 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:52.330
 Well, nothing like such a soft sound 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:57.700
 rustling in him is published and let's 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:04:11.130
 try ways to unprotect it like this 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:11.130
 like retype until the front-ass drove 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:25.120
 defenseless immediately became lighter and a little bit 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:27.160
 We add gas it already up therefore so 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.750
 here he flew me unusually well 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:31.180
 actually here such a hell with us somehow 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:33.940
 puts on if that was right before 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:39.840
 such a framed actually just 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:47.620
 stick it in here and get a UFO like that 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:48.490
 Well, nothing and we'll see 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:52.180
 to test him 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:56.530
 and then I will tell in general what he is bad and 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:05:00.240
 what good is it worth it to take at all 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:00.240
 bye thanks for coming to see you soon
