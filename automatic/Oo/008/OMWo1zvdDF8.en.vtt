00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.480
 Tiger is a team that has not lost 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:25.500
 to your house 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:29.060
 which is also logical favorite 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.660
 and how good is it 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.610
 regardless of who has good 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.329
 players is well run then it is 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.039
 a very difficult match 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:38.300
 you will come to play your part in 

00:00:37.039 --> 00:00:40.239
 try to get the best result 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:44.420
 possible to go on Sunday to the Olympic 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:47.780
 if we will seek to play this first 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:50.479
 match one way but none 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.799
 way we're going to give up on winning that a 

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:54.079
 team that has aspirations can not 

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:56.539
 go out to speculate or defend yourself to nothing 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:01:00.109
 more then we come willing 

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:01.219
 to see how the game is presented on 

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:03.739
 tiger team has men 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:05.119
 important but the roadrunner also 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:06.799
 It has its own and also an excellent 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:09.110
 motivation to get to this 

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:11.390
 final instance yes because at the end of 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.220
 accounts we have not loaded with 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.140
 that pressure 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.630
 that tigers has loaded during all the 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.550
 year and that we practically everything 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.700
 that comes is gain 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:24.590
 let's play without inhibitions 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.570
 and good that the pressures are still 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.950
 still it gives them luck Mr. 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.950
 thanks thanks 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:37.780
 I think there are teams at best that do not 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:41.049
 they find directions and they have 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:43.710
 difficulties finding the way but 

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:47.710
 there are teams like tears there are teams in 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:50.040
 our country and in the world that they own 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:53.640
 that gift or that 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:57.620
 that charisma that can hardly be 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:02:02.460
 get with investments or with 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:04.430
 advertising or with many many 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.600
 movements or with changes of 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:09.660
 frequent coaches have and so on 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:13.550
 Tigers is destined because it is inside 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:19.060
 from the city of Monterrey 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:19.060
 stuck in the hearts of many people 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:25.930
 I'm not a champion, I do not even want to think 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.930
 in europe
