00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.390
 1 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:39.320
 your game of Lille has progressed a lot 

00:00:36.409 --> 00:00:43.070
 at the physical level and at the mental level 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:45.280
 also compared to the back these 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:48.199
 regional that even that's the 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.439
 rather late Corsican godfather he did 

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:52.850
 that in his youth for his qualities 

00:00:50.439 --> 00:00:56.809
 but this joy that comes right in 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:01:00.500
 maturity the 56 years old is there he has more than 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:01.460
 six years old and he really made a jump from 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.610
 quality 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:07.089
 even at the mental level not go to 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.089
 physical 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:15.860
 I 'm going very easy on his job 

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:17.179
 it's about being at it does not have it 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.039
 not need much there 

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:22.459
 at the same time it has no waste at 

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:25.729
 individuals let themselves be tempted 

00:01:22.459 --> 00:01:27.890
 a judgment the choice then we 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:29.209
 is working these carcasses boss is this to 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.429
 to say if they are a bit it's not the 

00:01:29.209 --> 00:01:33.909
 morning but it's the afternoon 

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:37.140
 race and 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:37.140
 it's really a trotter may 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:58.210
 in the t90 was not really lucky 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:02:00.190
 I would say very unlucky he knows 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.560
 that it is a horse which sÃ©millant 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:05.380
 performant if the facts hidden by coming 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.490
 from the back in this case the input when 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.570
 you are completely out of look and you 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:12.220
 can not wait to get out of the box 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:14.950
 up to 50 m from the pole at 100 meters 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:17.620
 pole and finishes very well there are 400 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:21.040
 places and it could have been in the 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:23.280
 annals and 2,3 surely beyond the 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.280
 race 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:31.220
 on 1.5 rosso have sometimes we come to 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.900
 functionally that the most beautiful 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.650
 world race 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.959
 there are players who are capable 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:39.470
 to go very quickly from the start to the finish 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:40.760
 and I think for him it is a better 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:45.500
 race like that even though they have a lot 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:48.320
 fast who in tactical race where there are 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:50.810
 elastics years ago of 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:53.090
 meal they stop and it is necessary that the 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.450
 last 500 meters that's not his 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.040
 thing 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.620
 the oil is able to follow every 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:00.320
 trains even when I was very quickly 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:03.170
 evidence that he has a record of a 10 was 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:06.019
 able to finish well also necessarily 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:10.400
 kind there is alas updated from the world that 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:13.930
 will not be easy task but why 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.930
 not see him waiting
