00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.790
 mon mome first impressions sorry 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:08.400
 I wanted to say fornitura in my first 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.620
 impressions if you ever wondered 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.900
 why do they want so much money end and jake 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.580
 in the basement of your tree house let me 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.970
 tell you that I follow it too 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:20.250
 asking ha ha ha ha ha but good at 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.289
 less in this chapter we see that finally 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.570
 they will put all that money to good use 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.970
 the psychic elephant reappears 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.039
 ancestral sincerely I have always 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.380
 believed that this elephant is not in itself a 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.239
 animal is to say what I mean is 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.790
 that I think is not an organism 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:38.100
 I do not live nor supernatural, I always 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.260
 I thought it's some kind of weapon 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.360
 super powerful that was created during the 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.860
 great mushroom war this I say 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.750
 due to the characteristics that 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.149
 present as for example that voice 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.670
 robotic the pair of shotguns by way of 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.410
 Fangs the stairs to the sides like 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.170
 if it were a military tank 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.719
 especially camouflaged as an elephant 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.910
 without law they decide that they should spend everything 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.219
 that money is to put it to good use 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.530
 although good if you squander the money 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.810
 was considered good use okay 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.090
 you know what I mean 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.460
 we are seeing more themes for 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.380
 adults or rather adult humor in 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.170
 When this series of adventure why 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.869
 I say this good, you think about what 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.579
 next in that another caricature 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:22.170
 considered for children would touch topics 

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:24.810
 like the ones we've been seeing 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.210
 lately issues like this one 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.850
 episode the bribe for example that you 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.220
 they are teaching the children sincerely 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.409
 nothing new just one more of the sad ones 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.259
 realities of this world since time 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:39.360
 unmemorable money can do everything with 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.640
 money you can not just buy yourself good and 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.520
 Fine furniture that you do not need too 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.350
 you can buy one of the most things 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:49.020
 representative of purchasing power 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:51.060
 meat because I say this so good when 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.610
 the economy of your house is in good 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.229
 conditions your parents or yourself possess 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.959
 enough money to buy 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.819
 meat to eat is not the same buy 

00:01:57.959 --> 00:02:02.069
 a kilo of meat that costs the most 

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:04.500
 economic around about six or seven 

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:07.470
 dollars to buy a kilo of beans whose 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.060
 cost is five or seven times lower if 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.130
 do you have enough money 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.620
 obviously you prefer to eat meat to eat 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:16.140
 beans another of the things more 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.720
 before is the ease with which you can 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:21.330
 let's say it like that buy from the authorities 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.430
 that is to say breaking the law in a way 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.650
 legally illegal if it is that I 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:28.170
 they understand throughout this chapter 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.209
 we observe how people are transformed 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.489
 by the power of gift money that gentleman 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:34.530
 that everyone seduces very easily and 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:37.079
 causing fast do everything 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.480
 he asks so is ladies and gentlemen 

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:42.060
 mighty gentleman is money don the 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.040
 money moves the world and that money is the 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.170
 that will make you do anything with such 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.239
 to get it later we can 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.129
 observe another one of the many examples in 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:52.500
 those that the money returns computation to 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:55.079
 any and as if it were about 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.540
 a video game was already getting rid of 

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:59.609
 the obstacles is to say people 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:02.040
 responsible for the security of that kingdom 

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:04.349
 giving them a bag of more money and 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.540
 more bribes when they finally achieve 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:08.400
 arrive with the princess dwells she takes the 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.920
 gesture of her and of giving her all 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.379
 money as an insult and condemn them to 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.569
 receive an exemplary punishment I do not know to 

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:17.880
 you but this scene reminded me of 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:19.380
 cameo of fini jake in futurama when 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.980
 they are about to die of the 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.170
 way more 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.909
 painful possible all the melted gold 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.970
 falls into one of the most computations of the 

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:28.680
 village the police chief imagine the 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:31.080
 terrible pain that must have suffered 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.120
 this subject well I do not think that 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:35.700
 there is more to say than not 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.860
 already expressed before you 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:40.049
 what do they think about it now of 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:42.959
 adventure is definitely no longer for 

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:45.060
 kids think it over or tell me if 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:46.799
 you were parents 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.840
 I would like some of your children to see 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:50.940
 how money can be used so 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:53.640
 wrong for selfish and mean profits 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:55.829
 it's something if it makes this very clear 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.840
 chapter the confusion generated by the 

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:59.549
 wealth and the power of money is a 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.370
 reality today and that has endured 

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:04.739
 since immemorial times powerful 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:08.660
 gentleman is don money is all for today 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:08.660
