we've always had a lot of trouble

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.199 
we've always had a lot of trouble
getting<00:02:22.980> the<00:02:23.160> moisture<00:02:23.280> into<00:02:23.550> the<00:02:23.760> young<00:02:23.940> to

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
getting the moisture into the young to

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:26.930 
getting the moisture into the young to
the<00:02:24.330> soil<00:02:24.569> and<00:02:24.780> we<00:02:25.709> we<00:02:26.280> put<00:02:26.459> the<00:02:26.580> magnetic

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
the soil and we we put the magnetic

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.040 
the soil and we we put the magnetic
water<00:02:27.660> system<00:02:28.020> through<00:02:28.260> and<00:02:29.510> within<00:02:30.510> six

water system through and within six
weeks<00:02:31.290> we<00:02:31.860> found<00:02:32.130> that<00:02:32.250> the<00:02:32.400> water<00:02:32.580> block<00:02:33.150> was

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
weeks we found that the water block was

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.000 
weeks we found that the water block was
actually<00:02:33.510> a<00:02:33.540> lot<00:02:33.720> a<00:02:33.959> lot<00:02:34.410> more<00:02:34.620> wetter<00:02:34.890> than

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
actually a lot a lot more wetter than

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.860 
actually a lot a lot more wetter than
the<00:02:35.069> aggressive<00:02:35.489> blocks<00:02:35.730> we<00:02:36.420> actually<00:02:36.720> had

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
the aggressive blocks we actually had

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.990 
the aggressive blocks we actually had
the<00:02:36.959> back<00:02:37.110> offer<00:02:37.380> watering<00:02:37.770> a<00:02:37.980> safe<00:02:38.430> water<00:02:38.670> I

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
the back offer watering a safe water I

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.080 
the back offer watering a safe water I
definitely<00:02:39.599> would<00:02:39.720> say<00:02:39.840> between<00:02:40.290> 25<00:02:40.650> 3%<00:02:41.370> the

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
definitely would say between 25 3% the

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.180 
definitely would say between 25 3% the
water<00:02:42.330> is<00:02:42.630> pumped<00:02:42.900> through<00:02:43.110> magnets<00:02:43.709> fixed
