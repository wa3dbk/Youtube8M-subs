00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
weird situation and it's sort of that a

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:44.080 
weird situation and it's sort of that a
place<00:01:42.619> so<00:01:43.069> what's<00:01:43.249> so<00:01:43.429> from<00:01:43.670> what<00:01:43.819> we<00:01:43.939> found

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
place so what's so from what we found

place so what's so from what we found
Bauer<00:01:44.359> pretty<00:01:44.659> territorial<00:01:45.079> so<00:01:45.590> if<00:01:45.679> something

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:45.979 
Bauer pretty territorial so if something

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:47.349 
Bauer pretty territorial so if something

so<00:01:49.549> then<00:01:50.479> what<00:01:50.630> about<00:01:50.719> this<00:01:50.929> deep<00:01:51.409> driver<00:01:51.710> the

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
so then what about this deep driver the

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:53.739 
so then what about this deep driver the
deeper<00:01:52.189> driving<00:01:52.520> Luis<00:01:52.759> when<00:01:53.509> would<00:01:53.630> you<00:01:53.659> use

00:01:53.739 --> 00:01:53.749 
deeper driving Luis when would you use

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:56.139 
deeper driving Luis when would you use
that<00:01:53.899> one<00:01:54.369> basically<00:01:55.369> we<00:01:55.579> use<00:01:55.729> that<00:01:55.880> around

00:01:56.139 --> 00:01:56.149 
that one basically we use that around

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:58.690 
that one basically we use that around
the<00:01:56.329> standing<00:01:57.020> timber<00:01:57.170> around<00:01:57.530> our<00:01:58.460> Peter

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
the standing timber around our Peter

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.580 
the standing timber around our Peter
fast<00:01:58.939> Dan<00:01:59.179> but<00:01:59.450> in<00:01:59.600> the<00:01:59.689> other<00:01:59.810> Dan's<00:02:00.049> we<00:02:00.229> sort

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
fast Dan but in the other Dan's we sort

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.499 
fast Dan but in the other Dan's we sort
of<00:02:00.619> fish<00:02:00.770> it<00:02:00.889> around<00:02:01.039> the<00:02:01.130> drop-offs<00:02:01.490> this<00:02:02.359> is

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:02.509 
of fish it around the drop-offs this is

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:04.270 
of fish it around the drop-offs this is
a<00:02:02.539> done<00:02:02.990> de<00:02:03.079> barro<00:02:03.289> by<00:02:03.590> storm<00:02:03.950> and<00:02:04.159> it's

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
a done de barro by storm and it's

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.170 
a done de barro by storm and it's
actually

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.180 
actually

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:06.820 
actually
he's<00:02:05.330> special<00:02:05.510> so<00:02:05.810> it's<00:02:06.380> actually<00:02:06.590> designed

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:06.830 
he's special so it's actually designed

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:08.109 
he's special so it's actually designed
for<00:02:07.040> Aussie<00:02:07.280> conditions<00:02:07.700> so<00:02:07.850> it's<00:02:08.000> actually

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
for Aussie conditions so it's actually

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:09.940 
for Aussie conditions so it's actually
designed<00:02:08.479> for<00:02:08.690> our<00:02:08.810> fish<00:02:09.020> so<00:02:09.289> therefore<00:02:09.860> this

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
designed for our fish so therefore this

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:11.470 
designed for our fish so therefore this
comes<00:02:10.160> with<00:02:10.280> bigger<00:02:10.610> hooks<00:02:10.850> straight<00:02:11.300> out<00:02:11.450> of

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
comes with bigger hooks straight out of

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:12.730 
comes with bigger hooks straight out of
the<00:02:11.570> packet<00:02:11.900> yep

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
the packet yep

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.130 
the packet yep
they<00:02:12.950> actually<00:02:13.100> dive<00:02:13.520> down<00:02:13.730> to<00:02:14.390> about<00:02:14.900> ten

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
they actually dive down to about ten

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.560 
they actually dive down to about ten
foot<00:02:15.880> so<00:02:16.880> they<00:02:17.000> get<00:02:17.120> down<00:02:17.300> there<00:02:17.450> pretty

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:17.570 
foot so they get down there pretty

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:19.000 
foot so they get down there pretty
quickly<00:02:17.870> and<00:02:18.050> they<00:02:18.140> also<00:02:18.320> float<00:02:18.680> back<00:02:18.860> up

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
quickly and they also float back up

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.320 
quickly and they also float back up
really<00:02:19.160> quickly<00:02:19.430> which<00:02:19.670> is<00:02:19.760> really<00:02:20.000> important

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
really quickly which is really important

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:21.670 
really quickly which is really important

quality hooks straight out of the pack

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.660 
quality hooks straight out of the pack
now<00:02:50.840> what<00:02:51.080> about<00:02:51.170> the<00:02:51.440> soft<00:02:52.070> plastics<00:02:52.430> here<00:02:52.550> so

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
now what about the soft plastics here so

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:53.800 
now what about the soft plastics here so
we've<00:02:52.790> got<00:02:52.820> two<00:02:53.030> different<00:02:53.330> types<00:02:53.480> of<00:02:53.630> soft

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
we've got two different types of soft

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.300 
we've got two different types of soft
plastics<00:02:54.200> we've<00:02:54.350> got<00:02:54.500> one<00:02:54.650> which<00:02:54.830> is<00:02:54.950> a<00:02:54.980> float

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
plastics we've got one which is a float

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.070 
plastics we've got one which is a float
up<00:02:55.489> and<00:02:55.850> this<00:02:56.000> one<00:02:56.150> with<00:02:56.300> a<00:02:56.330> weight<00:02:56.570> in<00:02:56.750> it<00:02:56.870> so

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080 
up and this one with a weight in it so

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:58.479 
up and this one with a weight in it so
what's<00:02:57.590> the<00:02:57.680> difference<00:02:57.830> between<00:02:58.250> the<00:02:58.340> two

00:02:58.479 --> 00:02:58.489 
what's the difference between the two

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:00.610 
what's the difference between the two
and<00:02:58.640> when<00:02:58.730> would<00:02:58.880> you<00:02:58.940> use<00:02:59.030> each<00:02:59.390> so<00:03:00.020> basically

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
and when would you use each so basically

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.280 
and when would you use each so basically
with<00:03:00.920> the<00:03:01.510> bait-and-switch<00:03:02.510> floors<00:03:03.050> we

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
with the bait-and-switch floors we

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:04.930 
with the bait-and-switch floors we
basically<00:03:03.590> use<00:03:03.950> them<00:03:04.220> it<00:03:04.580> comes<00:03:04.820> with

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
basically use them it comes with

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.699 
basically use them it comes with
interchangeable<00:03:05.090> weight<00:03:05.840> yep<00:03:06.170> so<00:03:06.500> we<00:03:06.560> use

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
interchangeable weight yep so we use

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:08.800 
interchangeable weight yep so we use
them<00:03:06.890> around<00:03:07.550> different<00:03:08.000> water<00:03:08.330> columns<00:03:08.630> so

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
them around different water columns so

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:10.120 
them around different water columns so
if<00:03:09.020> we're<00:03:09.170> using<00:03:09.350> these<00:03:09.560> around<00:03:09.739> weed<00:03:09.950> beds

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.130 
if we're using these around weed beds

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:11.440 
if we're using these around weed beds
will<00:03:10.310> obviously<00:03:10.519> go<00:03:10.760> to<00:03:10.820> the<00:03:11.000> lighter<00:03:11.209> weight

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
will obviously go to the lighter weight

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:12.940 
will obviously go to the lighter weight
yep<00:03:11.660> we're<00:03:11.870> using<00:03:12.049> it<00:03:12.230> in<00:03:12.320> deeper<00:03:12.560> water<00:03:12.769> than

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
yep we're using it in deeper water than

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:14.740 
yep we're using it in deeper water than
we<00:03:13.100> obviously<00:03:13.489> go<00:03:13.760> to<00:03:13.790> the<00:03:13.940> heavier<00:03:14.209> bait<00:03:14.420> okay

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
we obviously go to the heavier bait okay

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:16.270 
we obviously go to the heavier bait okay
so<00:03:14.810> that<00:03:15.019> comes<00:03:15.200> with<00:03:15.380> a<00:03:15.410> different<00:03:15.799> size<00:03:15.950> LED

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
so that comes with a different size LED

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:17.740 
so that comes with a different size LED
