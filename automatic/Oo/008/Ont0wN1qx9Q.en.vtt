00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:54.620
 be all the files what you have to 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.620
 to do is to erase everything I just did 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:58.920
 we selected this and we had it 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.019

 we execute this 20 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:02.170
 but not very fast 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.170
