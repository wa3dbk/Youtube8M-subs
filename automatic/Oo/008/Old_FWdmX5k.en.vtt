oh<00:01:56.630> that's<00:01:56.990> a<00:01:57.140> huge<00:01:57.560> hit<00:01:57.890> Eddie<00:01:58.070> no<00:01:58.759> that's

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
oh that's a huge hit Eddie no that's

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.640 
oh that's a huge hit Eddie no that's
terrible<00:01:59.210> in<00:01:59.479> fact<00:01:59.689> they<00:01:59.810> did<00:01:59.990> this<00:02:00.290> is<00:02:00.500> what

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:00.650 
terrible in fact they did this is what

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:02.109 
terrible in fact they did this is what
happens<00:02:00.979> at<00:02:01.100> the<00:02:01.189> end<00:02:01.220> of<00:02:01.460> the<00:02:01.579> race<00:02:01.729> I<00:02:01.909> have

happens at the end of the race I have

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:05.380 
happens at the end of the race I have
never<00:02:02.450> seen<00:02:03.049> a<00:02:03.290> car<00:02:03.710> like<00:02:03.880> Vito<00:02:04.880> mirrors<00:02:05.210> do

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:36.739 
differently next time around and he

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:38.170 
differently next time around and he
definitely<00:02:36.920> would<00:02:37.280> not<00:02:37.400> do<00:02:37.549> that<00:02:37.700> in<00:02:37.760> practice

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
definitely would not do that in practice

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.600 
definitely would not do that in practice
that<00:02:38.329> was<00:02:38.450> just<00:02:38.780> too<00:02:39.110> risky<00:02:39.530> all<00:02:40.160> right<00:02:40.340> then

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
that was just too risky all right then

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:43.050 
that was just too risky all right then
