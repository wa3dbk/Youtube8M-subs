return spring after you've pulled the

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:12.000 
return spring after you've pulled the
governor<00:00:11.110> out<00:00:11.139> so<00:00:11.530> I'm<00:00:11.590> just<00:00:11.710> going<00:00:11.860> to<00:00:11.950> do

governor out so I'm just going to do
this<00:00:12.130> short<00:00:12.430> vid<00:00:12.640> to<00:00:12.760> show<00:00:12.910> you<00:00:13.000> how<00:00:13.120> to<00:00:13.180> do<00:00:13.360> it

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:13.510 
this short vid to show you how to do it

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:15.900 
this short vid to show you how to do it
it's<00:00:13.600> a<00:00:13.660> lot<00:00:13.780> easier<00:00:13.990> than<00:00:14.320> you<00:00:14.440> think<00:00:14.910> the

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:15.910 
it's a lot easier than you think the

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:17.130 
it's a lot easier than you think the
problem<00:00:16.240> is<00:00:16.360> once<00:00:16.540> you<00:00:16.660> have<00:00:16.779> taken<00:00:16.960> the

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:17.140 
problem is once you have taken the

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:19.290 
problem is once you have taken the
governor<00:00:17.970> disconnected<00:00:18.970> the<00:00:19.029> governor

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:19.300 
governor disconnected the governor

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.600 
governor disconnected the governor
remove<00:00:19.660> that<00:00:19.810> governor<00:00:20.170> wheel<00:00:20.520> when<00:00:21.520> you

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:21.610 
remove that governor wheel when you

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:23.220 
remove that governor wheel when you
start<00:00:21.880> the<00:00:21.970> engine<00:00:22.000> it's<00:00:22.360> going<00:00:22.419> to<00:00:22.540> run<00:00:22.989> wide

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:23.230 
start the engine it's going to run wide

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:24.479 
start the engine it's going to run wide
open<00:00:23.529> because<00:00:23.619> the<00:00:23.800> governor<00:00:24.099> is<00:00:24.130> not<00:00:24.279> there

00:00:24.479 --> 00:00:24.489 
open because the governor is not there

00:00:24.489 --> 00:00:28.470 
open because the governor is not there
to<00:00:24.610> bring<00:00:24.759> it<00:00:24.880> back<00:00:25.060> to<00:00:25.919> back<00:00:26.919> the<00:00:27.130> no<00:00:27.970> throttle

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:28.480 
to bring it back to back the no throttle

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.139 
to bring it back to back the no throttle
this<00:00:29.470> arm<00:00:29.739> here<00:00:30.130> is<00:00:30.310> what<00:00:30.520> controls<00:00:30.880> your

00:00:31.139 --> 00:00:31.149 
this arm here is what controls your

00:00:31.149 --> 00:00:32.729 
this arm here is what controls your
throttle<00:00:31.509> on<00:00:31.630> the<00:00:31.720> carburetor<00:00:32.169> provided

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:32.739 
throttle on the carburetor provided

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:35.549 
throttle on the carburetor provided
you're<00:00:32.860> using<00:00:33.100> the<00:00:33.340> stock<00:00:33.700> linkage<00:00:34.570> and<00:00:35.290> if<00:00:35.410> we

00:00:35.549 --> 00:00:35.559 
you're using the stock linkage and if we

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:38.640 
you're using the stock linkage and if we
take<00:00:35.710> a<00:00:35.770> look<00:00:36.070> here<00:00:36.370> you'll<00:00:37.180> see<00:00:37.570> that<00:00:38.320> as<00:00:38.500> I'm

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:38.650 
take a look here you'll see that as I'm

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:43.160 
take a look here you'll see that as I'm
moving<00:00:38.980> this<00:00:39.100> arm<00:00:40.200> it<00:00:41.200> actually<00:00:41.650> moves<00:00:41.980> the

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
moving this arm it actually moves the

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.170 
moving this arm it actually moves the
throttle<00:00:44.170> on<00:00:44.350> the<00:00:44.650> carburetor<00:00:45.160> so<00:00:46.030> what

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:46.180 
throttle on the carburetor so what

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:47.610 
throttle on the carburetor so what
happens<00:00:46.570> is<00:00:46.810> you<00:00:46.960> take<00:00:47.110> that<00:00:47.200> governor<00:00:47.500> wheel

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:47.620 
happens is you take that governor wheel

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:49.380 
happens is you take that governor wheel
off<00:00:47.800> the<00:00:47.950> engine<00:00:48.190> fires<00:00:48.460> and<00:00:48.790> it<00:00:48.850> goes<00:00:49.000> to<00:00:49.150> wide

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:49.390 
off the engine fires and it goes to wide

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:51.390 
off the engine fires and it goes to wide
open<00:00:49.840> because<00:00:50.350> there's<00:00:50.620> nothing<00:00:51.130> there<00:00:51.370> to

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:51.400 
open because there's nothing there to

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.850 
open because there's nothing there to
tell<00:00:52.030> it<00:00:52.180> to<00:00:52.270> come<00:00:52.450> back<00:00:52.660> to<00:00:53.200> an<00:00:53.320> idle<00:00:53.710> and

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:53.860 
tell it to come back to an idle and

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:55.410 
tell it to come back to an idle and
that's<00:00:54.550> what<00:00:54.700> we're<00:00:54.820> going<00:00:54.970> to<00:00:55.030> fix<00:00:55.240> here
