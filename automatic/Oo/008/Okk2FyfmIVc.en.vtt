00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:01.410 
I'm sorry going to affect that command

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:03.500 
I'm sorry going to affect that command

center very much wasn't a rented the the
vultures<00:00:03.899> and<00:00:04.049> not<00:00:04.170> the<00:00:04.290> best<00:00:04.470> it<00:00:05.069> could<00:00:05.279> have

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400 
vultures and not the best it could have

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.450 
vultures and not the best it could have
done<00:00:05.549> a<00:00:05.580> lot<00:00:05.670> more<00:00:05.819> damage<00:00:05.940> though<00:00:06.180> and<00:00:07.429> not<00:00:08.429> a

coming<00:00:08.790> in<00:00:08.880> to<00:00:09.030> polish<00:00:09.480> off<00:00:09.630> the<00:00:09.809> the<00:00:10.170> army<00:00:10.469> so

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
coming in to polish off the the army so

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.259 
coming in to polish off the the army so
I<00:00:13.160> felt<00:00:14.160> that<00:00:14.280> this<00:00:14.340> was<00:00:14.429> an<00:00:14.639> effective<00:00:14.969> recall

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
I felt that this was an effective recall

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:16.580 
I felt that this was an effective recall
but<00:00:15.450> it<00:00:15.540> doesn't<00:00:15.839> seem<00:00:15.929> to<00:00:15.990> have<00:00:16.170> been<00:00:16.350> the

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
but it doesn't seem to have been the

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.029 
but it doesn't seem to have been the
best<00:00:16.920> and<00:00:17.510> not<00:00:18.510> a<00:00:18.539> basic<00:00:19.320> getting<00:00:19.529> as<00:00:19.619> forces

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
best and not a basic getting as forces

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.640 
best and not a basic getting as forces
surrounded<00:00:20.580> oh<00:00:21.240> my<00:00:21.600> god<00:00:21.840> another<00:00:22.230> recall

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
surrounded oh my god another recall

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.259 
surrounded oh my god another recall
didn't<00:00:23.460> know<00:00:23.550> he<00:00:23.640> had<00:00:23.699> enough<00:00:23.939> energy<00:00:24.060> for

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
didn't know he had enough energy for

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.929 
didn't know he had enough energy for
that<00:00:24.539> second<00:00:24.900> second<00:00:25.500> arbiter<00:00:25.830> but<00:00:26.340> there<00:00:26.820> it

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
that second second arbiter but there it

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.700 
that second second arbiter but there it
is<00:00:27.029> so<00:00:27.420> this<00:00:27.810> is<00:00:27.900> actually<00:00:27.990> a<00:00:28.170> total<00:00:28.529> turn

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
is so this is actually a total turn

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.800 
is so this is actually a total turn

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
around now not now be cos more forces

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
guess the observer didn't make a pass to

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.940 
guess the observer didn't make a pass to
terrace<00:00:39.239> and<00:00:40.050> bits<00:00:40.500> just<00:00:40.559> going<00:00:40.770> to<00:00:40.829> be<00:00:40.890> able

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
terrace and bits just going to be able

terrace and bits just going to be able
to<00:00:41.100> get<00:00:41.219> rid<00:00:41.430> of<00:00:41.460> this<00:00:41.670> expansion<00:00:42.320> taking<00:00:43.320> out

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
to get rid of this expansion taking out

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.690 
to get rid of this expansion taking out
their<00:00:43.559> command<00:00:43.860> center<00:00:44.190> so<00:00:44.340> that's<00:00:44.520> going<00:00:44.640> to

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
their command center so that's going to

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.660 
their command center so that's going to
go<00:00:44.820> down<00:00:45.000> and<00:00:45.710> i'm<00:00:46.710> not<00:00:46.860> having<00:00:47.190> to<00:00:47.340> send<00:00:47.520> in

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
go down and i'm not having to send in

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.010 
go down and i'm not having to send in
more<00:00:47.850> reinforcements<00:00:48.450> to<00:00:48.480> get<00:00:48.719> rid<00:00:48.840> of<00:00:48.899> this

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
more reinforcements to get rid of this

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.610 
more reinforcements to get rid of this
and<00:00:49.230> like<00:00:50.070> last<00:00:50.489> time<00:00:51.199> you<00:00:52.199> would<00:00:52.320> think<00:00:52.350> that

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
and like last time you would think that

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.740 
and like last time you would think that
nada<00:00:53.190> would<00:00:53.430> have<00:00:53.550> more<00:00:53.789> forces<00:00:54.360> coming<00:00:54.570> out

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
nada would have more forces coming out

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:55.910 
nada would have more forces coming out
of<00:00:54.780> this<00:00:54.930> than<00:00:55.170> be<00:00:55.350> so<00:00:55.530> but<00:00:55.680> i<00:00:55.710> don't<00:00:55.890> think

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
of this than be so but i don't think

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.080 
of this than be so but i don't think
that<00:00:56.129> will<00:00:56.190> be<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.399> case<00:00:56.430> this<00:00:56.610> time<00:00:56.760> and<00:00:57.000> i

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
that will be the case this time and i

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:57.950 
that will be the case this time and i
think<00:00:57.270> this<00:00:57.360> will<00:00:57.539> be<00:00:57.690> able<00:00:57.780> to

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
think this will be able to

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.319 
think this will be able to
counter-attack<00:00:58.350> with<00:00:58.739> a<00:00:59.180> larger<00:01:00.180> force

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
counter-attack with a larger force

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.180 
counter-attack with a larger force
production<00:01:00.739> versions<00:01:01.739> with<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:01.920> middle<00:01:02.129> of

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
arbiters which he produced earlier now

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.810 
arbiters which he produced earlier now
going<00:01:06.990> to<00:01:07.049> have<00:01:07.170> some<00:01:07.530> decent<00:01:07.979> status<00:01:08.369> energy

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
going to have some decent status energy

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.880 
going to have some decent status energy
in<00:01:08.939> them<00:01:09.060> which<00:01:09.420> will<00:01:09.600> start<00:01:09.810> not<00:01:10.110> as<00:01:10.229> forces

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
in them which will start not as forces

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.789 
in them which will start not as forces
pushing<00:01:11.100> across<00:01:11.430> that's<00:01:11.790> what<00:01:12.510> I<00:01:12.540> feel<00:01:12.900> will

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
pushing across that's what I feel will

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.370 
pushing across that's what I feel will
be<00:01:13.920> happening<00:01:14.159> surely<00:01:14.610> a<00:01:14.840> lot<00:01:15.840> of<00:01:15.930> bases<00:01:16.200> being

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
be happening surely a lot of bases being

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.620 
be happening surely a lot of bases being
mined<00:01:16.590> outs<00:01:16.799> as<00:01:17.220> well<00:01:17.460> so<00:01:17.759> yeah<00:01:18.390> things

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
mined outs as well so yeah things

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.480 
mined outs as well so yeah things
looking<00:01:18.960> a<00:01:19.049> bit<00:01:19.080> bleak<00:01:19.409> in<00:01:19.680> terms<00:01:20.070> of<00:01:20.220> economy

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
looking a bit bleak in terms of economy

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.130 
looking a bit bleak in terms of economy
well<00:01:21.119> at<00:01:21.210> least<00:01:21.330> they<00:01:21.570> will<00:01:21.720> start<00:01:21.990> looking

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
well at least they will start looking

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.109 
well at least they will start looking
that<00:01:22.380> way<00:01:22.500> another<00:01:23.189> couple<00:01:23.549> of<00:01:23.580> arbiters<00:01:23.939> are

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
that way another couple of arbiters are

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.640 
that way another couple of arbiters are
not<00:01:24.299> going<00:01:24.420> to<00:01:24.509> go<00:01:24.600> for<00:01:24.810> status<00:01:25.080> field<00:01:25.229> they're

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
not going to go for status field they're

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.440 
not going to go for status field they're
going<00:01:25.860> straight<00:01:26.189> for<00:01:26.369> not<00:01:26.520> as<00:01:26.670> unprotected

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450
