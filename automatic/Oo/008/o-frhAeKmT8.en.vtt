hit<00:00:50.399> by<00:00:50.430> a<00:00:50.579> huge<00:00:50.879> tsunami<00:00:51.270> but<00:00:51.809> Tokyo<00:00:52.260> is<00:00:52.410> a

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
hit by a huge tsunami but Tokyo is a

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:58.130 
hit by a huge tsunami but Tokyo is a
vast<00:00:53.629> agglomeration<00:00:54.629> of<00:00:55.010> of<00:00:56.360> urban<00:00:57.360> scape<00:00:57.930> and

vast agglomeration of of urban scape and
it<00:00:58.859> certainly<00:00:59.070> stretches<00:00:59.609> all<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.760> way<00:00:59.910> out

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
it certainly stretches all the way out

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.900 
it certainly stretches all the way out
