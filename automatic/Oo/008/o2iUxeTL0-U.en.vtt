was<00:00:47.940> not<00:00:48.000> to<00:00:48.270> increase<00:00:49.079> so<00:00:49.320> much<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.710> power

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
was not to increase so much the power

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.770 
was not to increase so much the power
but<00:00:50.850> to<00:00:51.590> take<00:00:52.590> weight<00:00:53.010> off<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.730> car<00:00:54.120> so<00:00:54.539> the

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
but to take weight off the car so the

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.400 
but to take weight off the car so the
weight<00:00:54.960> has<00:00:55.260> been<00:00:55.289> decreased<00:00:56.219> on<00:00:56.610> this<00:00:56.879> car

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:57.410 
weight has been decreased on this car

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:03.380 
weight has been decreased on this car
from<00:00:58.410> approximately<00:00:59.149> 3,800<00:01:00.149> pounds<00:01:00.719> to<00:01:02.390> not

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
from approximately 3,800 pounds to not

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.990 
from approximately 3,800 pounds to not
twenty-nine<00:01:04.199> hundred<00:01:04.339> pounds<00:01:05.339> so<00:01:05.610> it's<00:01:05.850> a

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
twenty-nine hundred pounds so it's a

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.450 
twenty-nine hundred pounds so it's a
significant<00:01:06.810> weight<00:01:07.350> reduction<00:01:07.920> and<00:01:08.040> that<00:01:08.189> is

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
significant weight reduction and that is

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.670 
significant weight reduction and that is
important<00:01:08.970> for<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.270> road<00:01:09.479> for<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:10.020> racetrack

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
important for the road for the racetrack

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.520 
important for the road for the racetrack
and<00:01:11.299> even<00:01:12.299> though<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.750> horsepower<00:01:13.229> has

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
and even though the horsepower has

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.929 
and even though the horsepower has
increased<00:01:14.070> because<00:01:14.610> of<00:01:16.580> motorsport<00:01:17.580> engine

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
increased because of motorsport engine

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.480 
increased because of motorsport engine
management<00:01:18.210> system<00:01:18.960> and<00:01:19.140> an<00:01:19.799> open<00:01:20.100> exhaust

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
management system and an open exhaust

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.660 
management system and an open exhaust
the<00:01:20.880> horsepower<00:01:21.420> came<00:01:21.750> up<00:01:21.930> to<00:01:22.110> approximately

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
the horsepower came up to approximately

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:28.580 
the horsepower came up to approximately
680<00:01:23.670> and<00:01:24.350> so<00:01:25.350> 680<00:01:26.159> horsepower<00:01:26.570> with<00:01:27.590> 2,900

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
680 and so 680 horsepower with 2,900

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.749 
680 and so 680 horsepower with 2,900
pounds<00:01:28.619> that<00:01:29.159> is<00:01:29.310> a<00:01:29.340> serious<00:01:30.439> GT<00:01:31.439> racer<00:01:31.759> just
