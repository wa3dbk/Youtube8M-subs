fine as I can find at the hardware store

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.730 
fine as I can find at the hardware store
and<00:01:35.570> you<00:01:36.570> really<00:01:36.960> need<00:01:37.110> to<00:01:37.229> have<00:01:37.320> some<00:01:37.530> special

and you really need to have some special

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.499 
and you really need to have some special
order<00:01:38.130> stuff<00:01:38.310> to<00:01:38.460> get<00:01:38.610> any<00:01:38.790> more<00:01:38.939> than<00:01:39.119> that<00:01:39.299> I

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
order stuff to get any more than that I

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:44.690 
order stuff to get any more than that I
haven't<00:01:40.140> seen<00:01:40.670> ceramic<00:01:42.860> sandpaper<00:01:43.860> in<00:01:44.159> that

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
haven't seen ceramic sandpaper in that

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.160 
haven't seen ceramic sandpaper in that
finite<00:01:44.909> rate<00:01:45.149> I've<00:01:45.270> only<00:01:45.420> seen<00:01:45.659> it<00:01:45.750> go<00:01:45.840> down<00:01:45.990> to

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
finite rate I've only seen it go down to

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.740 
finite rate I've only seen it go down to
like<00:01:46.380> 120<00:01:47.159> because<00:01:47.700> it's<00:01:47.880> usually<00:01:48.149> designed

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
like 120 because it's usually designed

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.810 
like 120 because it's usually designed
for<00:01:48.899> heavy-duty<00:01:49.290> industrial<00:01:50.130> belt<00:01:50.399> Sanders

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
for heavy-duty industrial belt Sanders

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.139 
for heavy-duty industrial belt Sanders
and<00:01:51.030> there<00:01:51.750> again<00:01:52.110> that<00:01:52.350> ceramic<00:01:53.220> material<00:01:53.759> is

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
and there again that ceramic material is

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.580 
and there again that ceramic material is
some<00:01:54.450> of<00:01:54.540> the<00:01:54.600> hardest<00:01:54.750> material<00:01:55.380> on<00:01:55.500> the

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
some of the hardest material on the

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.249 
some of the hardest material on the
planet<00:01:55.619> next<00:01:56.189> to<00:01:56.280> diamonds<00:01:56.460> and<00:01:56.840> it's<00:01:57.840> it's

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
planet next to diamonds and it's it's

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.109 
planet next to diamonds and it's it's
just<00:01:58.710> as<00:01:58.860> hard<00:01:59.070> as<00:01:59.189> the<00:01:59.340> silicon<00:01:59.759> carbide

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
just as hard as the silicon carbide

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.719 
just as hard as the silicon carbide
pretty<00:02:00.360> much<00:02:00.740> if<00:02:01.740> not<00:02:01.799> maybe<00:02:02.219> even<00:02:02.549> a<00:02:02.640> little

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
pretty much if not maybe even a little

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.630 
pretty much if not maybe even a little
bit<00:02:02.969> harder<00:02:03.329> and<00:02:03.450> as<00:02:04.380> it<00:02:04.740> breaks<00:02:04.890> down<00:02:05.040> it's

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
bit harder and as it breaks down it's

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:06.920 
bit harder and as it breaks down it's
going<00:02:05.790> to<00:02:05.850> break<00:02:06.060> down<00:02:06.329> and<00:02:06.600> it's<00:02:06.780> going<00:02:06.869> to

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
going to break down and it's going to

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.199 
going to break down and it's going to
release<00:02:07.320> new<00:02:07.649> aggregate<00:02:08.280> with<00:02:08.520> sharp<00:02:08.849> angle

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
release new aggregate with sharp angle

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.420 
release new aggregate with sharp angle
sharp<00:02:09.479> points<00:02:09.780> to<00:02:10.259> continue<00:02:10.860> cutting<00:02:11.129> through

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
sharp points to continue cutting through

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.710 
sharp points to continue cutting through
them

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
them

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.040 
them
really<00:02:12.020> need<00:02:12.430> so<00:02:13.430> those<00:02:13.820> are<00:02:14.030> the<00:02:14.120> the<00:02:14.420> basic

here<00:02:17.600> for<00:02:18.050> automotive<00:02:18.590> and<00:02:18.770> metal<00:02:19.610> it's<00:02:19.820> going

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
here for automotive and metal it's going

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:21.100 
here for automotive and metal it's going
to<00:02:20.030> be<00:02:20.150> great<00:02:20.390> it's<00:02:20.540> going<00:02:20.690> to<00:02:20.780> work<00:02:20.930> out

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
to be great it's going to work out

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.590 
to be great it's going to work out
perfect<00:02:21.560> it's<00:02:22.250> five<00:02:22.490> bucks<00:02:22.820> for<00:02:23.060> five<00:02:23.090> sheets
