 hello with you evgeny kartashov and 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.830
 monster photo site 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:14.280
 We continue to get acquainted with the equipment 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.759
 firms 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:20.519
 red devil which gave us for 

00:00:17.759 --> 00:00:22.890
 review online store photo percent for 

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:25.369
 thank them so much now we 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.109
 consider a practical shoot 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:31.649
 taking a portrait with a few 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:34.410
 unusual lighting scheme top under 

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:36.780
 some corner we have 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.990
 source looked land one thousand two hundred 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:43.200
 millimeters well, it is clear that this is ours 

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:44.490
 will be like sheared that is the source form 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.150
 she completely repeats the form 

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:50.280
 strip box and a little lower angle 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:54.480
 we have the source of the filler 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:57.090
 Light is a source with lamps of length 600 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.610
 millimeters and it will highlight us 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.610
 shadows and leaves 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:04.559
 several back and side plays a role 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:08.250
 Backlight is small 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:10.010
 control hich window hairstyle power 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.650
 sources are as follows 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:15.930
 top source full power bottom 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.930
 the source we have included two central 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:21.690
 lamps i.e. fill light it is always 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.550
 should be less power otherwise 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:26.340
 we just won't have any on our face 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:29.040
 shadow or very bad 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:32.549
 bottom source source fill 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:35.030
 light will kill the overhead light it also 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.710
 very bad for shooting 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:41.460
 then we will have the effect 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:44.520
 light from the bottom it turns out such an effect 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.619
 as if the person is looking at a fire or 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:50.359
 on something that shines below and 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:53.219
 the face doesnâ€™t look so good 

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:56.219
 let's measure now lit to 

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:59.880
 us exactly set the camera settings i 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:03.240
 I'll take a flash meter here will stand 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:06.270
 model including in metering mode 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:09.539
 constant light and make up 400 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:13.379
 Exposure one 125 as I will shoot 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:16.620
 with a focal length lens 85 

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:20.730
 millimeters such an extract it will save 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:22.860
 i'm guaranteed from the stirrer and when 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:26.370
 this will not allow much bully 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:31.920
 iso value and so i measure the light on 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:35.220
 the level of the face the diaphragm turns 6 3 but 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:37.890
 you need to consider that the skin is lighter than 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:40.250
 gray card all flash meter and they 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.390
 graduating cao gray map and 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:45.269
 accordingly i will need to 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.079
 stage add exposure that is 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:50.160
 about 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:51.239
 I can focus on the value 4 or 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.790
 near 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:57.780
 slightly less than 5 6 for example aperture 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:59.720
 5 so now i will invite the model today 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.609
 we will only have Alberti 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.750
 which you already know well and we 

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:05.940
 have prepared 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:09.090
 multiple style look 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:12.480
 pin-up i think you like it and so 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.250
 get down to shooting now we'll get started 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.690
 to shoot 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:18.120
 shooting with such a scheme of light 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:20.370
 made here from this side that is 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:23.310
 our sources are similar 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:25.349
 shell valves is a variant of the scheme 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.220
 shell but with a horizontal 

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:29.160
 location 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:32.970
 there are several such light sources 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:35.160
 kicked out a kind of strip boxes and so 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.400
 Now we will shoot a portrait of a large 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.909
 plan 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:42.819
 approximately on the chest and see what 

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:45.970
 we will be reminded that we 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:48.250
 use three sources of lighting also 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:50.769
 here one source works for 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:52.780
 filming but now its operator 

00:03:50.769 --> 00:04:02.409
 a little bit in such a way that 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:04:04.500
 he didn't get on the model as you can see we 

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:07.540
 you got very soft lighting 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:09.760
 downright and enveloping it 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:12.870
 happens due to the fact that 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:14.590
 the strip we have stretched horizontally and 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:16.389
 respectively in horizontal 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:18.970
 direction is soft enough 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:21.639
 the source is vertical it is somewhat 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:23.770
 Harder because the size in this 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:25.900
 case in the vertical plane is less 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:26.849
 let's try another option with 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.530
 off 

00:04:26.849 --> 00:04:33.039
 filling source this should give 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:35.650
 us deeper shadows and better volume 

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:38.530
 here still filling happens due to 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:40.570
 the fact that we have around a white background that is 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:42.130
 we shoot on a frame loop me this 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:44.530
 it turns out kind of such 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:46.630
 natural shadow filling and so i 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:49.139
 turn off this source and do more 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:49.139
 one frame 

00:04:56.479 --> 00:05:00.559
 put your face a little bit 

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:09.979
 a little step back personally 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:26.940
 coat hanger sizes 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:35.220
 given even a little will move back up to 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:37.319
 god damn fine wonderful little 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:44.629
 shoulders when will come back up to fold on 

00:05:37.319 --> 00:05:44.629
 left neck yes yes yes here and more 

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:57.920
 Now as you can see the shadows have become 

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:59.690
 somewhat deeper and better manifested 

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:02.950
 volume on the face of the model 

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:06.020
 this way when shooting choosing 

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:10.160
 power of the filling source we can 

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:11.480
 getting different shadow depths so we 

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:13.970
 you were considered 

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:16.760
 such an interesting scheme for shooting 

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:20.090
 portraits using firm sources 

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:23.000
 red devil I remind that it is sources on 

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:25.610
 lumenis cent lamps the next lesson 

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:28.310
 we will look at another interesting scheme 

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:30.680
 for a portrait that resembles 

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:33.110
 shooting for Esquire magazine 

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:35.380
 that is, we will use two strips 

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:37.790
 which are located on the sides and 

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:40.520
 respectively, the eyes of the model will appear 

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:42.920
 such oblong slightly curved 

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:44.950
 highlights and so see you next 

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:44.950
 the lesson
