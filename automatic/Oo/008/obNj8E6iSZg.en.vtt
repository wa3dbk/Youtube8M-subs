reason why I got the shoes was because

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.550 
reason why I got the shoes was because
they<00:01:15.000> were<00:01:15.060> on<00:01:15.180> sale<00:01:15.210> for<00:01:15.600> 100<00:01:15.930> bucks<00:01:16.080> they

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
they were on sale for 100 bucks they

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.620 
they were on sale for 100 bucks they
didn't<00:01:16.950> have<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.340> leather<00:01:17.729> ones<00:01:17.970> available

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
didn't have the leather ones available

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.600

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
so I take over the synthetic ones but I

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.969 
so I take over the synthetic ones but I

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
leather ones are way better because you

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.710 
leather ones are way better because you
