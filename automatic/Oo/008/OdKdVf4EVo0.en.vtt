got the bottom of the buckets filled in
and<00:00:20.220> what<00:00:20.640> I<00:00:20.670> did<00:00:20.910> is<00:00:21.060> I<00:00:21.500> just<00:00:22.500> put<00:00:22.710> two<00:00:22.980> coffee

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
and what I did is I just put two coffee

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.240 
and what I did is I just put two coffee
cans<00:00:23.640> worth<00:00:23.939> of<00:00:24.410> Larry's<00:00:25.410> potting<00:00:25.830> mix<00:00:26.039> in

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
cans worth of Larry's potting mix in

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.070 
cans worth of Larry's potting mix in
there<00:00:26.460> and<00:00:26.580> soap<00:00:26.849> get<00:00:27.029> gowns<00:00:27.300> so<00:00:27.539> to<00:00:27.720> make<00:00:27.900> sure

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
there and soap get gowns so to make sure

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.689 
there and soap get gowns so to make sure
that<00:00:28.260> the<00:00:28.410> slow<00:00:28.560> Annette<00:00:29.010> cup<00:00:29.250> was<00:00:29.429> really

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
that the slow Annette cup was really

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.740 
that the slow Annette cup was really
soaked<00:00:30.060> I<00:00:30.439> pre<00:00:31.439> filled<00:00:31.740> my<00:00:32.009> gutter<00:00:32.460> pipe<00:00:32.750> also

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
soaked I pre filled my gutter pipe also

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.650 
soaked I pre filled my gutter pipe also
so<00:00:34.260> that<00:00:34.440> it<00:00:34.559> would<00:00:35.090> immediately<00:00:36.090> start

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
so that it would immediately start

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.799 
so that it would immediately start
wicking<00:00:37.280> and<00:00:38.280> I<00:00:38.489> just<00:00:38.670> decided<00:00:39.120> I<00:00:39.390> would<00:00:39.570> fill

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
wicking and I just decided I would fill

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.350 
wicking and I just decided I would fill
them<00:00:39.930> in<00:00:40.079> place<00:00:40.700> seems<00:00:41.700> to<00:00:41.820> make<00:00:41.969> it<00:00:42.000> a<00:00:42.180> lot

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
them in place seems to make it a lot

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.360 
them in place seems to make it a lot
easier<00:00:42.390> rather<00:00:43.050> than<00:00:43.260> carrying<00:00:43.680> full<00:00:43.950> buckets

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
easier rather than carrying full buckets

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.569 
easier rather than carrying full buckets
of<00:00:45.379> potting<00:00:46.379> mix<00:00:46.590> around<00:00:46.920> and<00:00:47.070> trying<00:00:47.280> to<00:00:47.399> set

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
of potting mix around and trying to set

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.020 
of potting mix around and trying to set
them<00:00:47.700> on<00:00:47.820> there<00:00:48.260> and<00:00:49.670> having<00:00:50.670> something<00:00:50.910> for

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
them on there and having something for

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.090 
them on there and having something for
to<00:00:51.120> accident<00:00:51.600> or<00:00:52.320> maybe<00:00:52.469> hurt<00:00:52.680> in<00:00:52.770> my<00:00:52.829> back

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
to accident or maybe hurt in my back

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.049 
to accident or maybe hurt in my back
again<00:00:53.460> so<00:00:54.239> here's<00:00:54.449> what<00:00:54.629> we<00:00:54.719> do<00:00:54.840> we<00:00:54.960> just<00:00:55.140> take

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:56.059 
again so here's what we do we just take

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:58.220 
again so here's what we do we just take
coffee<00:00:57.059> can't<00:00:57.329> fill<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.629> wheelbarrow<00:00:58.050> up

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
coffee can't fill the wheelbarrow up

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.580 
coffee can't fill the wheelbarrow up
with<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.500> mix<00:00:58.680> took<00:00:58.920> taking<00:00:59.399> a<00:00:59.460> coffee<00:00:59.670> can

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:00.590 
with the mix took taking a coffee can

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:05.570 
with the mix took taking a coffee can
filling<00:01:01.590> it<00:01:01.710> up<00:01:01.800> with<00:01:02.359> potting<00:01:03.359> soil<00:01:04.580> dumping

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
filling it up with potting soil dumping

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.770 
filling it up with potting soil dumping
it<00:01:05.670> in<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:05.909> bag<00:01:07.970> and<00:01:08.970> I'm<00:01:09.150> only<00:01:09.299> putting<00:01:09.540> two

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
it in the bag and I'm only putting two

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.100 
it in the bag and I'm only putting two
cans<00:01:10.049> in<00:01:10.320> at<00:01:10.439> a<00:01:10.500> time<00:01:11.420> so<00:01:12.420> that'll<00:01:12.780> make<00:01:12.810> it

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
cans in at a time so that'll make it

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.310 
cans in at a time so that'll make it
easier<00:01:13.939> to<00:01:14.939> wet<00:01:15.600> it<00:01:15.630> down<00:01:15.900> and<00:01:16.200> get<00:01:16.290> it

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
easier to wet it down and get it

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.800 
easier to wet it down and get it
thoroughly<00:01:16.590> saturated<00:01:17.340> so<00:01:18.270> that<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.509> wicking

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
thoroughly saturated so that the wicking

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.469 
thoroughly saturated so that the wicking
process<00:01:19.320> will<00:01:19.530> work<00:01:19.740> better

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:23.479 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:27.080

I've<00:04:54.980> got<00:04:55.160> this<00:04:55.310> nice<00:04:55.550> little<00:04:55.760> wand<00:04:56.060> here<00:04:56.450> it

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:56.600 
I've got this nice little wand here it

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:00.370 
I've got this nice little wand here it
makes<00:04:56.750> it<00:04:56.900> real<00:04:57.080> easy<00:04:57.110> to<00:04:57.410> to<00:04:58.400> water<00:04:58.640> these<00:04:59.380> you

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:00.380 
makes it real easy to to water these you

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:02.980 
makes it real easy to to water these you
get<00:05:00.500> the<00:05:00.590> water<00:05:00.770> right<00:05:01.010> down<00:05:01.630> around<00:05:02.630> the<00:05:02.780> base

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:02.990 
get the water right down around the base

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:07.630 
get the water right down around the base
of<00:05:03.020> the<00:05:03.790> plant<00:05:04.790> without<00:05:06.280> giving<00:05:07.280> the<00:05:07.370> plant

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:07.640 
of the plant without giving the plant

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:13.390 
of the plant without giving the plant
all<00:05:08.440> wet<00:05:09.440> and<00:05:09.470> dirt<00:05:09.890> all<00:05:10.070> over<00:05:10.100> it<00:05:11.200> it's<00:05:12.400> pretty

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:13.400 
all wet and dirt all over it it's pretty

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:14.080 
all wet and dirt all over it it's pretty
good

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:14.090 
good

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:15.880 
good
just<00:05:14.450> give<00:05:14.600> it<00:05:14.720> about<00:05:14.780> 10<00:05:15.110> seconds<00:05:15.590> of<00:05:15.710> water

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:15.890 
just give it about 10 seconds of water

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:19.450 
just give it about 10 seconds of water
that's<00:05:16.130> probably<00:05:16.550> enough<00:05:17.410> to<00:05:18.410> wet<00:05:18.980> that<00:05:19.220> down

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:19.460 
that's probably enough to wet that down

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:21.790 
that's probably enough to wet that down
I'll<00:05:20.210> let<00:05:20.390> that<00:05:20.420> soak<00:05:20.810> in<00:05:21.080> and<00:05:21.350> then<00:05:21.410> I'll<00:05:21.590> add

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:21.800 
I'll let that soak in and then I'll add

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.340 
I'll let that soak in and then I'll add
the<00:05:21.830> rest<00:05:22.100> of<00:05:22.160> the<00:05:22.220> body<00:05:22.460> mix<00:05:22.820> up<00:05:23.000> to<00:05:23.990> where<00:05:24.170> the

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:24.350 
the rest of the body mix up to where the

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:26.980 
the rest of the body mix up to where the
it<00:05:24.830> needs<00:05:25.040> to<00:05:25.160> go<00:05:25.340> which<00:05:26.150> is<00:05:26.180> probably<00:05:26.750> going

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:26.990 
it needs to go which is probably going

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:29.350 
it needs to go which is probably going
to<00:05:27.050> be<00:05:27.310> right<00:05:28.310> up<00:05:28.430> to<00:05:28.580> about<00:05:28.760> right<00:05:29.030> here<00:05:29.300> so

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:29.360 
to be right up to about right here so

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:33.060 
to be right up to about right here so
maybe<00:05:29.810> another<00:05:30.020> can<00:05:30.940> can<00:05:31.940> and<00:05:32.120> a<00:05:32.180> half<00:05:32.360> and

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:33.070 
maybe another can can and a half and

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:35.650 
maybe another can can and a half and
we'll<00:05:34.070> be<00:05:34.220> set<00:05:34.520> then<00:05:34.850> I'll<00:05:34.940> add<00:05:35.090> the<00:05:35.240> tension

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:35.660 
we'll be set then I'll add the tension

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:38.310 
we'll be set then I'll add the tension
and<00:05:35.870> fertilizer<00:05:36.350> around<00:05:36.770> the<00:05:36.890> outside

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:38.320 
and fertilizer around the outside

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:40.090 
and fertilizer around the outside
