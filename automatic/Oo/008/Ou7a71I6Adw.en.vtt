00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
micro levels and next I made this

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.680 
micro levels and next I made this
cupcake<00:02:24.180> and<00:02:24.680> um<00:02:25.850> this<00:02:26.850> one<00:02:27.090> didn't<00:02:27.390> turn<00:02:27.420> out

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
cupcake and um this one didn't turn out

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.780 
cupcake and um this one didn't turn out
so<00:02:27.750> great<00:02:28.080> there's<00:02:28.680> a<00:02:28.770> giant<00:02:29.280> air<00:02:29.430> bubble

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
so great there's a giant air bubble

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.330 
so great there's a giant air bubble
right<00:02:30.030> there<00:02:30.300> and<00:02:30.770> besides<00:02:31.770> that<00:02:31.920> there's

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
right there and besides that there's

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.620 
right there and besides that there's
also<00:02:32.550> this<00:02:32.880> um<00:02:33.240> large<00:02:34.140> like<00:02:35.000> crack<00:02:36.000> or<00:02:36.030> a<00:02:36.300> line

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
also this um large like crack or a line

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.900 
also this um large like crack or a line
that's<00:02:37.020> going<00:02:37.500> down<00:02:37.650> it's<00:02:38.430> probably<00:02:38.700> because

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
that's going down it's probably because

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.880 
that's going down it's probably because
of<00:02:39.060> the<00:02:39.239> glaze<00:02:39.510> so<00:02:39.750> i<00:02:39.780> might<00:02:40.020> just<00:02:40.050> reglaze<00:02:40.680> it

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
of the glaze so i might just reglaze it

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.850 
of the glaze so i might just reglaze it
and<00:02:41.390> hopefully<00:02:42.390> it'll<00:02:42.930> disappear<00:02:43.410> but<00:02:43.680> I

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
and hopefully it'll disappear but I

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.500 
and hopefully it'll disappear but I
colored<00:02:44.430> the<00:02:44.610> back<00:02:44.820> with<00:02:45.450> um<00:02:47.030> homemade<00:02:48.030> resin
