00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
a really emotional moment and since I

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:42.610 
a really emotional moment and since I

figured it out so early a lot of that

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.559 
figured it out so early a lot of that
emotion<00:03:43.099> was<00:03:43.219> sucked<00:03:43.579> out<00:03:43.730> it<00:03:44.090> wasn't<00:03:44.359> so

00:03:44.559 --> 00:03:44.569 
emotion was sucked out it wasn't so

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:46.719 
emotion was sucked out it wasn't so
strongly<00:03:45.219> foreshadowed<00:03:46.219> it<00:03:46.400> would<00:03:46.519> have<00:03:46.609> been

00:03:46.719 --> 00:03:46.729 
strongly foreshadowed it would have been

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:49.059 
strongly foreshadowed it would have been
a<00:03:46.819> lot<00:03:47.000> more<00:03:47.180> effective<00:03:47.510> a<00:03:47.989> lesser<00:03:48.440> issue<00:03:48.650> but

00:03:49.059 --> 00:03:49.069 
a lot more effective a lesser issue but

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:50.740 
a lot more effective a lesser issue but
still<00:03:49.310> something<00:03:49.639> I<00:03:49.760> want<00:03:50.030> to<00:03:50.150> bring<00:03:50.299> up<00:03:50.479> is<00:03:50.720> I

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:50.750 
still something I want to bring up is I

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:52.750 
still something I want to bring up is I

thought was pretty cool when someone

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:43.060 
thought was pretty cool when someone
uses<00:04:41.389> a<00:04:41.539> spell<00:04:41.990> they<00:04:42.259> leave<00:04:42.440> a<00:04:42.470> circle

standing<00:04:43.490> on<00:04:43.580> the<00:04:43.729> circle<00:04:44.090> will<00:04:44.210> give<00:04:44.419> you<00:04:44.539> the

00:04:44.649 --> 00:04:44.659 
standing on the circle will give you the

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:47.290 
standing on the circle will give you the
effect<00:04:45.080> be<00:04:45.500> it<00:04:45.650> a<00:04:45.830> flame<00:04:46.310> circle<00:04:46.789> your<00:04:46.970> sword

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:10.550 
able to do a strong attack that will

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:12.640

felt<00:05:14.450> like<00:05:14.540> there<00:05:14.690> was<00:05:14.840> a<00:05:14.990> lot<00:05:15.440> of<00:05:15.710> potential

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:16.430 
felt like there was a lot of potential

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:18.550 
felt like there was a lot of potential
but<00:05:16.640> not<00:05:16.850> much<00:05:17.210> was<00:05:17.420> really<00:05:17.750> done<00:05:18.020> with<00:05:18.200> it

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:18.560 
but not much was really done with it

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:20.740 
but not much was really done with it
and<00:05:18.650> unfortunately<00:05:19.550> the<00:05:19.910> controls<00:05:20.330> do<00:05:20.510> feel<00:05:20.690> a

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:20.750 
and unfortunately the controls do feel a

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:22.900 
and unfortunately the controls do feel a
little<00:05:20.900> bit<00:05:21.080> sloppy<00:05:21.410> as<00:05:21.740> well<00:05:22.010> there<00:05:22.490> isn't

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:22.910 
little bit sloppy as well there isn't

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:25.090 
little bit sloppy as well there isn't
much<00:05:23.180> depth<00:05:23.510> outside<00:05:24.140> of<00:05:24.320> combat<00:05:24.590> either

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:25.100

much depth outside of combat either
sadly<00:05:25.550> you<00:05:26.030> can<00:05:26.180> upgrade<00:05:26.390> your<00:05:26.720> weapons<00:05:27.140> and

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:27.350 
sadly you can upgrade your weapons and

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:30.520 
sadly you can upgrade your weapons and
armor<00:05:27.800> but<00:05:28.250> it's<00:05:28.520> nothing<00:05:29.300> special<00:05:29.690> and<00:05:30.110> you

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:30.530 
armor but it's nothing special and you

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:32.980 
armor but it's nothing special and you
only<00:05:30.710> learn<00:05:31.130> new<00:05:31.460> skills<00:05:31.730> by<00:05:32.210> leveling<00:05:32.780> up

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:32.990 
only learn new skills by leveling up

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:35.050 
only learn new skills by leveling up
which<00:05:33.230> I<00:05:33.320> thought<00:05:33.500> was<00:05:33.620> pretty<00:05:33.890> lame<00:05:34.280> a<00:05:34.610> skill

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:35.060 
which I thought was pretty lame a skill

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:36.880 
which I thought was pretty lame a skill
tree<00:05:35.270> of<00:05:35.360> some<00:05:35.540> sort<00:05:35.960> would<00:05:36.350> have<00:05:36.470> been<00:05:36.590> nice

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:36.890 
tree of some sort would have been nice

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:39.010 
tree of some sort would have been nice
and<00:05:37.430> unfortunately<00:05:38.060> the<00:05:38.180> game<00:05:38.360> is<00:05:38.540> lacking<00:05:38.750> in

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:39.020 
and unfortunately the game is lacking in

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:41.320 
and unfortunately the game is lacking in
this<00:05:39.170> regard<00:05:39.640> regardless<00:05:40.640> the<00:05:40.850> combat<00:05:41.240> itself

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:41.330 
this regard regardless the combat itself

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:44.800 
this regard regardless the combat itself
is<00:05:41.780> still<00:05:42.230> fun<00:05:42.680> and<00:05:43.010> it<00:05:43.250> remains<00:05:43.730> engaging<00:05:44.510> for

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:44.810 
is still fun and it remains engaging for

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:46.570 
is still fun and it remains engaging for
the<00:05:44.900> duration<00:05:45.140> of<00:05:45.470> the<00:05:45.680> game<00:05:45.710> of<00:05:46.190> which<00:05:46.400> this

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:46.580 
the duration of the game of which this

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:50.440 
the duration of the game of which this
game<00:05:46.760> lasts<00:05:47.000> about<00:05:47.150> 20<00:05:47.570> hours<00:05:48.730> in<00:05:49.730> the<00:05:50.000> end<00:05:50.150> the

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:50.450 
game lasts about 20 hours in the end the

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:52.570 
game lasts about 20 hours in the end the
last<00:05:50.810> story<00:05:51.110> is<00:05:51.290> a<00:05:51.380> pretty<00:05:51.710> good<00:05:51.890> game<00:05:52.040> but

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:52.580 
last story is a pretty good game but

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:55.150 
last story is a pretty good game but
it's<00:05:52.760> still<00:05:52.970> fairly<00:05:53.270> flawed<00:05:53.960> it<00:05:54.380> feels<00:05:54.830> like

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:55.160 
it's still fairly flawed it feels like

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:57.160 
it's still fairly flawed it feels like
it<00:05:55.370> lacks<00:05:55.640> some<00:05:56.000> polish<00:05:56.600> not<00:05:56.780> in<00:05:56.870> the<00:05:56.960> sense

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:57.170 
it lacks some polish not in the sense

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:58.420 
it lacks some polish not in the sense
that<00:05:57.230> there<00:05:57.440> are<00:05:57.560> glitches<00:05:57.890> and<00:05:58.250> stuff

00:05:58.420 --> 00:05:58.430 
that there are glitches and stuff

00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:59.770 
that there are glitches and stuff
because<00:05:58.670> I<00:05:58.730> didn't<00:05:58.910> really<00:05:59.000> encounter<00:05:59.600> that

00:05:59.770 --> 00:05:59.780 
because I didn't really encounter that

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:02.050 
because I didn't really encounter that
but<00:06:00.410> more<00:06:00.770> in<00:06:00.920> the<00:06:00.950> sense<00:06:01.070> that<00:06:01.400> it<00:06:01.700> felt<00:06:01.940> like

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:02.060 
but more in the sense that it felt like

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:03.790 
but more in the sense that it felt like
there<00:06:02.240> should<00:06:02.450> have<00:06:02.540> been<00:06:02.630> more<00:06:02.960> here<00:06:03.440> but

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:03.800 
there should have been more here but

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.860 
there should have been more here but
there<00:06:03.980> wasn't<00:06:04.310> either<00:06:04.610> way<00:06:04.940> it's<00:06:05.570> still<00:06:05.690> a

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:05.870 
there wasn't either way it's still a

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:07.780 
there wasn't either way it's still a
pretty<00:06:06.320> good<00:06:06.440> game<00:06:07.010> and<00:06:07.220> I<00:06:07.280> think<00:06:07.460> it's<00:06:07.580> worth

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:07.790 
pretty good game and I think it's worth

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:09.790 
pretty good game and I think it's worth
checking<00:06:07.880> out<00:06:08.390> for<00:06:08.660> sure<00:06:08.930> I<00:06:09.140> would<00:06:09.470> say<00:06:09.620> it's

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:09.800 
checking out for sure I would say it's

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:11.650 
checking out for sure I would say it's
not<00:06:09.860> only<00:06:10.070> one<00:06:10.340> of<00:06:10.430> the<00:06:10.490> best<00:06:10.700> RPGs<00:06:10.940> on<00:06:11.510> the

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:11.660 
not only one of the best RPGs on the

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:13.210 
not only one of the best RPGs on the
weak<00:06:11.840> but<00:06:12.020> probably<00:06:12.380> what<00:06:12.590> in<00:06:12.680> the<00:06:12.770> best<00:06:12.980> games

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:13.220 
weak but probably what in the best games

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:15.790 
weak but probably what in the best games
on<00:06:13.340> the<00:06:14.000> weed<00:06:14.180> period<00:06:14.870> definitely<00:06:15.410> worth<00:06:15.770> the

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:15.800 
on the weed period definitely worth the

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:18.190 
on the weed period definitely worth the
effort<00:06:16.370> operation<00:06:17.060> rainfall<00:06:17.750> went<00:06:17.990> through

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:18.200 
effort operation rainfall went through

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:20.170 
effort operation rainfall went through
in<00:06:18.560> order<00:06:18.740> to<00:06:18.830> get<00:06:19.010> this<00:06:19.130> game<00:06:19.400> release<00:06:19.700> this

in order to get this game release this

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:33.550 

everyone<00:06:31.340> it's<00:06:31.880> good<00:06:32.090> old<00:06:32.260> shameless<00:06:33.260> self

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:33.560 
everyone it's good old shameless self

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:35.740 
everyone it's good old shameless self
plugging<00:06:34.040> shameless<00:06:34.820> self-promotion<00:06:35.450> I

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:35.750 
plugging shameless self-promotion I

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:37.660 
plugging shameless self-promotion I
still<00:06:36.140> don't<00:06:36.470> know<00:06:36.590> which<00:06:37.130> one<00:06:37.310> I<00:06:37.340> prefer

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:37.670 
still don't know which one I prefer

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:39.460 
still don't know which one I prefer
plugging<00:06:38.540> or<00:06:38.750> promotion

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:39.470 
plugging or promotion

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:42.910 
plugging or promotion
I<00:06:39.500> guess<00:06:39.830> plugging<00:06:40.760> is<00:06:41.170> like<00:06:42.170> plugging

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:42.920 
I guess plugging is like plugging

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:45.040 
I guess plugging is like plugging
someone<00:06:43.520> else<00:06:43.760> but<00:06:44.600> I<00:06:44.660> guess<00:06:44.810> you<00:06:44.930> could

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:45.050 
someone else but I guess you could

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:49.000 
someone else but I guess you could
promote<00:06:45.500> someone<00:06:45.860> else<00:06:46.160> to<00:06:46.550> a<00:06:48.010> promotion

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:49.010 
promote someone else to a promotion

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:50.010 
promote someone else to a promotion
because<00:06:49.160> it<00:06:49.430> sounds<00:06:49.700> more<00:06:49.910> professional

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:50.020 
because it sounds more professional

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:52.330 
because it sounds more professional
although<00:06:51.020> this<00:06:51.140> isn't<00:06:51.350> even<00:06:51.560> a<00:06:51.740> professional

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:52.340 
although this isn't even a professional

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:55.480 
although this isn't even a professional
thing<00:06:53.000> at<00:06:53.300> the<00:06:53.600> end<00:06:53.630> this<00:06:53.930> is<00:06:54.110> like<00:06:54.320> casual<00:06:55.220> and
