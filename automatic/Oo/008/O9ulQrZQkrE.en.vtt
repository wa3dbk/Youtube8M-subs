the music crack there's these air vents
these<00:00:38.309> holes<00:00:38.640> little<00:00:39.149> pin<00:00:39.360> holes<00:00:39.629> so<00:00:40.350> that

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
these holes little pin holes so that

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.440 
these holes little pin holes so that

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
when the lid is shut and the case parts

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.299 
when the lid is shut and the case parts
are<00:00:42.600> shut<00:00:42.840> there's<00:00:43.200> sound<00:00:43.530> penetrating

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
are shut there's sound penetrating

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.279

really just gives it outstanding town
and<00:00:48.840> so<00:00:49.230> also<00:00:49.739> this<00:00:50.070> has<00:00:50.250> a<00:00:50.280> practice<00:00:50.879> pedal

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
and so also this has a practice pedal

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.029 
and so also this has a practice pedal
when<00:00:51.360> you<00:00:51.420> push<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:51.750> pedal<00:00:52.020> down<00:00:52.140> once<00:00:52.500> it

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
when you push the pedal down once it

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.130 
when you push the pedal down once it
locks<00:00:53.280> in<00:00:53.520> place<00:00:53.550> but<00:00:54.180> it<00:00:54.300> makes<00:00:54.510> it<00:00:54.660> makes<00:00:54.989> it

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
locks in place but it makes it makes it

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.380
