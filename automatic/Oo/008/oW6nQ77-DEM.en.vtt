to the normal game the extra stage is a
bit<00:00:51.210> more<00:00:51.570> based<00:00:52.020> on<00:00:52.500> trial<00:00:53.219> and<00:00:53.489> error

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
bit more based on trial and error

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.139 
bit more based on trial and error
gameplay<00:00:54.360> and<00:00:54.660> that<00:00:55.219> at<00:00:56.219> first<00:00:56.610> it<00:00:56.879> seems

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
gameplay and that at first it seems

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.299 
gameplay and that at first it seems
impossible<00:00:57.480> but<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:58.230> more<00:00:58.410> you<00:00:58.559> play<00:00:58.710> the

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
impossible but the more you play the

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.100 
impossible but the more you play the
more<00:00:59.550> it<00:00:59.940> gets<00:01:00.510> really<00:01:00.899> really<00:01:01.199> easy<00:01:02.960> this<00:01:03.960> is

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
more it gets really really easy this is

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.609 
more it gets really really easy this is
a<00:01:04.140> bit<00:01:04.379> less<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.860> case<00:01:05.070> for<00:01:05.729> USD<00:01:06.450> and<00:01:06.720> it

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
a bit less the case for USD and it

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.500 
a bit less the case for USD and it
happens<00:01:08.010> that<00:01:08.310> this<00:01:08.490> extra<00:01:08.939> stain<00:01:09.180> is<00:01:09.360> my

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:11.959 
useful for extra mode like it almost

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:17.220 
useful for extra mode like it almost
always<00:02:12.580> begins<00:02:13.580> with<00:02:13.700> aimed<00:02:14.390> shots<00:02:14.959> like<00:02:15.230> this

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:20.209 
and then you want to kill these fairies

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:25.960 
and then you want to kill these fairies
before<00:02:20.720> they<00:02:20.959> can<00:02:21.170> do<00:02:21.350> anything<00:02:24.310> this<00:02:25.310> this<00:02:25.790> is

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
before they can do anything this this is

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.300 
before they can do anything this this is
actually<00:02:26.270> a<00:02:26.300> bit<00:02:26.420> easier<00:02:26.600> with<00:02:27.050> mr.<00:02:27.470> Akers<00:02:28.040> a

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
actually a bit easier with mr. Akers a

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:35.500 
actually a bit easier with mr. Akers a
shot<00:02:29.150> move<00:02:29.660> a<00:02:29.690> bit<00:02:29.900> slow<00:02:30.260> i<00:02:30.290> think<00:02:32.140> lalala<00:02:34.510> then

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
shot move a bit slow i think lalala then

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:40.600 
shot move a bit slow i think lalala then
is<00:02:35.840> the<00:02:36.200> part<00:02:36.500> I<00:02:36.709> really<00:02:37.130> like<00:02:38.230> is<00:02:39.230> it<00:02:39.980> is<00:02:40.400> the

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
is the part I really like is it is the

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:47.380 
is the part I really like is it is the
usual<00:02:40.760> pure<00:02:41.420> dodging<00:02:42.019> ball<00:02:46.000> might<00:02:47.000> as<00:02:47.209> well

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
usual pure dodging ball might as well

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.580 
usual pure dodging ball might as well

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:25.610 
this section is much much much easier

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:30.600 
this section is much much much easier
than<00:05:26.030> what<00:05:26.240> we<00:05:26.419> get<00:05:26.599> in<00:05:26.780> stage<00:05:27.050> 4<00:05:27.440> but<00:05:28.190> as<00:05:28.960> usual

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:30.610 
than what we get in stage 4 but as usual

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:38.110 
than what we get in stage 4 but as usual
not<00:05:31.610> the<00:05:31.789> reason<00:05:31.940> to<00:05:32.479> lose<00:05:32.990> concentration

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:38.120 

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:41.950 

I<00:05:38.210> just<00:05:38.960> really<00:05:39.229> like<00:05:39.470> I<00:05:40.120> think<00:05:41.120> it's<00:05:41.300> very

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:41.960 
I just really like I think it's very

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:43.900 
I just really like I think it's very
very<00:05:42.380> well<00:05:42.560> balanced<00:05:43.160> in<00:05:43.310> terms<00:05:43.580> of

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:43.910 
very well balanced in terms of

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:49.390 
very well balanced in terms of
difficulty<00:05:44.470> very<00:05:45.470> very<00:05:46.400> random<00:05:47.020> laughs<00:05:48.400> but

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:49.400 
difficulty very very random laughs but

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:51.700 
difficulty very very random laughs but
usually<00:05:50.150> doable<00:05:50.630> when<00:05:51.110> you<00:05:51.229> don't<00:05:51.380> play<00:05:51.620> like

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:51.710 
usually doable when you don't play like

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:59.280 
usually doable when you don't play like
an<00:05:52.070> idiot<00:05:56.260> which<00:05:57.260> is<00:05:57.440> usually<00:05:58.310> how<00:05:58.520> I<00:05:58.550> play

00:05:59.280 --> 00:05:59.290 
an idiot which is usually how I play

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:04.210
