experimental<00:00:20.699> I<00:00:21.180> do<00:00:21.300> not<00:00:21.779> suggest<00:00:22.470> you<00:00:23.010> run

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
experimental I do not suggest you run

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.349 
experimental I do not suggest you run
these<00:00:23.460> as<00:00:23.699> a<00:00:24.420> daily<00:00:24.779> driver<00:00:25.460> um<00:00:26.460> basically

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
these as a daily driver um basically

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.330 
these as a daily driver um basically
these<00:00:28.050> are<00:00:28.109> actually<00:00:28.590> two<00:00:28.769> different<00:00:28.800> roms

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
these are actually two different roms

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.150 
these are actually two different roms
but<00:00:29.670> very<00:00:29.939> very<00:00:30.150> similar<00:00:30.529> I<00:00:31.529> think<00:00:31.980> actually

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
but very very similar I think actually

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.930 
but very very similar I think actually
it's<00:00:32.399> built<00:00:33.180> off<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:33.750> same<00:00:34.079> source<00:00:34.620> code<00:00:34.980> both

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
it's built off the same source code both

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.610 
it's built off the same source code both
are<00:00:36.120> for<00:00:36.450> that<00:00:36.630> one<00:00:36.809> that<00:00:36.989> one<00:00:37.200> this<00:00:37.469> is

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
are for that one that one this is

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.920 
are for that one that one this is
actually<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.040> aokp<00:00:38.969> version<00:00:39.450> for<00:00:39.690> those<00:00:39.809> of

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
actually the aokp version for those of

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.880 
actually the aokp version for those of
you<00:00:40.079> don't<00:00:40.350> know<00:00:40.410> what<00:00:40.559> aokp<00:00:41.280> is<00:00:41.660> basically

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:42.890 
you don't know what aokp is basically

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.610 
you don't know what aokp is basically
it's<00:00:43.890> built<00:00:44.250> off<00:00:44.660> cyanogenmod<00:00:45.660> rom<00:00:45.690> and<00:00:46.230> added

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
it's built off cyanogenmod rom and added

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.029 
it's built off cyanogenmod rom and added
a<00:00:46.649> couple<00:00:46.829> more<00:00:46.980> features<00:00:47.520> and<00:00:47.930> here<00:00:48.930> we<00:00:49.050> go<00:00:49.320> so

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
a couple more features and here we go so

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.209 
a couple more features and here we go so
I've<00:00:50.129> got<00:00:50.309> four<00:00:50.610> dot<00:00:50.789> one<00:00:51.059> dot<00:00:51.090> one<00:00:51.629> and<00:00:52.219> the

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
I've got four dot one dot one and the

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.189 
I've got four dot one dot one and the
one<00:00:53.370> on<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:53.670> right<00:00:53.699> is<00:00:53.910> team<00:00:54.360> dirts<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:54.899> this

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
one on the right is team dirts and this

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.229 
one on the right is team dirts and this
one<00:00:55.379> I<00:00:55.410> think<00:00:55.559> is<00:00:56.160> a<00:00:56.969> helicopter<00:00:57.930> a<00:00:58.140> Yates<00:00:59.239> both

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239

then
and<00:01:55.289> this<00:01:55.770> could<00:01:56.070> be<00:01:56.280> potentially<00:01:56.520> a<00:01:57.090> daily

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
and this could be potentially a daily

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.920 
and this could be potentially a daily
driver<00:01:57.659> for<00:01:58.170> you<00:01:58.579> and<00:01:59.579> there<00:02:00.149> can<00:02:00.420> be<00:02:00.450> still
