00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.440
 hello to all of you guys to have found how 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:18.830
 you can see today we are in the company of 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:23.060
 meizu mx 4 that you can buy at 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:26.000
 the aid website baidu.com found 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:29.359
 however link in description it is 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.119
 of the 16 gb model but it is one 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:34.340
 gray coloring own engine from 16 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:36.019
 giga even if already available 32 gig 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.610
 unfortunately we have this 16 gig 

00:00:36.019 --> 00:00:39.830
 because the moment we have 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:43.699
 purchased the smartphone the version 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:45.409
 32gb still wasn't available 

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:47.600
 and above all there have been delays 

00:00:45.409 --> 00:00:49.250
 so much so that if we had bought the 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.350
 32gb version through the joke 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.089
 even received before this 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.979
 so let's say let's go see it right away 

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:57.019
 what is it about 

00:00:54.979 --> 00:01:05.180
 then we go to open to remove the 

00:00:57.019 --> 00:01:07.659
 seal the box to see if it is 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:12.680
 manages to open without destroying 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:21.440
 chopping ok we immediately find ours 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:23.990
 really very elegant medium a lot 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.610
 nice but let's go then to see 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.440
 actually in the coming days of 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:30.140
 what is it then about the bank 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:33.520
 we immediately find or rather see before 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.520
 what's inside the box 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.000
 first of all this is as if it were a 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:40.400
 book this box explains to us in Chinese 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.600
 because the phone comes from China and 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.000
 then we find the last page on 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:48.820
 phone with let 's see what's on his 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:53.229
 internal even if we succeed is the 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:56.740
 charger and cable usb charger from 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:56.740
 two amps 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:03.680
 micro usb usb cable for life 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:06.530
 nothing else this is the maze box 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.360
 while the very minimal box for 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.649
 regarding the phone instead 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:13.660
 we remove the plastic in and 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:13.660
 annoying that we find on the back 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:22.370
 so we have a back cover 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:25.220
 in polycarbonate 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:27.770
 this is plastic even if to the touch vi 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.900
 I will say it almost seems like it is 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:31.670
 aluminum I know you can open in 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:35.030
 some way 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:39.470
 here we go to remove it back cover 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:42.440
 in polycarbonate and in the back we find 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.860
 a double non-removable battery 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:48.590
 20 megapixel camera flash 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:50.240
 where to place our sim card top 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.640
 we find the headphone jack here is the 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:54.170
 frame is really very metal 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.840
 very nice elegant and coloring 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.640
 really very very beautiful then we find 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.459
 top here power button 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:05.019
 microphone and jack switch off 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:07.519
 headphones on the left side we find the 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:09.890
 rocker volume volume rocker 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:13.459
 then we find another microphone at the bottom 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:15.260
 the speaker as an iphone and the micro usb 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:19.070
 for charging and on the right side 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:22.310
 instead it is empty move that sincerely 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:24.080
 I prefer however it is preferred to the button 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:26.120
 switch on your right side 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:27.980
 in addition to the volume button on the 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.600
 left because actually in here 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:32.090
 high is almost uncomfortable 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.750
 the display is 5.3 inch which 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.880
 despite the size I must say 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:38.910
 being practically without frames 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:41.460
 it is however very portable for 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:43.170
 example compared to an iphone 6 plus vi 

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:45.840
 I say that the size difference is 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:48.720
 exactly this then a phone 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:51.000
 much more portable we are well at 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:54.209
 soon with a complete review 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:58.640
 I will test hello in the coming days 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:58.640
 everyone goes to daniele for hi-tech space
