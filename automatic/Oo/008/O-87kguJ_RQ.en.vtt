00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:04.769 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:08.190 

now<00:04:05.769> I<00:04:05.799> guess<00:04:06.689> you're<00:04:07.689> looking<00:04:07.719> you<00:04:08.079> ain't

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:08.200

now I guess you're looking you ain't
cooking<00:04:08.500> so<00:04:09.189> we're<00:04:09.280> gonna<00:04:09.370> let<00:04:09.519> this<00:04:09.640> go<00:04:09.849> for

00:04:09.869 --> 00:04:09.879 
cooking so we're gonna let this go for

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:11.910 
cooking so we're gonna let this go for
all<00:04:10.150> right<00:04:10.299> guys<00:04:10.480> we're<00:04:10.840> it's<00:04:10.959> one<00:04:11.500> hour<00:04:11.650> in

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:11.920 
all right guys we're it's one hour in

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:13.559 
all right guys we're it's one hour in
and<00:04:12.159> I<00:04:12.340> guess<00:04:12.519> the<00:04:12.760> neighbors<00:04:13.060> are<00:04:13.239> doing<00:04:13.359> a

00:04:13.559 --> 00:04:13.569 
and I guess the neighbors are doing a

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:18.810 
and I guess the neighbors are doing a
fireworks<00:04:14.019> display<00:04:14.140> for<00:04:14.890> me<00:04:17.519> but<00:04:18.519> anyway

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:18.820 
fireworks display for me but anyway

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:21.420 
fireworks display for me but anyway
we're<00:04:19.120> at<00:04:19.269> we're<00:04:20.019> running<00:04:20.259> around<00:04:20.350> three<00:04:20.799> 300

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:21.430 
we're at we're running around three 300

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:24.570 
we're at we're running around three 300
or<00:04:21.820> so<00:04:22.000> these<00:04:22.600> chunks<00:04:23.289> are<00:04:23.380> hard<00:04:23.590> to<00:04:23.830> kind<00:04:24.490> of

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:24.580 
or so these chunks are hard to kind of

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:26.999 
or so these chunks are hard to kind of
regulate<00:04:24.940> the<00:04:25.060> heat<00:04:25.270> but<00:04:25.650> like<00:04:26.650> they<00:04:26.770> say<00:04:26.949> if

00:04:26.999 --> 00:04:27.009 
regulate the heat but like they say if

00:04:27.009 --> 00:04:28.379 
regulate the heat but like they say if
you're<00:04:27.490> looking<00:04:27.729> you<00:04:27.850> ain't<00:04:28.000> cooking<00:04:28.270> but
