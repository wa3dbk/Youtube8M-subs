00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 and hello with you sahaj and we 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.779
 We are preparing to upgrade the server to the version 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.370
 164 minecraft most mods 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.010
 actually already paid version appeared 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.259
 but unfortunately so far there is no launcher in 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.690
 you launcher under the version of minecraft 16 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.789
 any therefore actually I decided 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.289
 record such a small video in the same way 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.670
 way my players actually get there 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.250
 to the server as soon as the update will be 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.840
 produced and so i can say 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.510
 first thing you need 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.109
 need the most common vanilla trend 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.970
 minecraft 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.689
 I have it already installed so I have it 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.689
 just run 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:41.160
 actually you all know very well how 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:45.810
 it looks actually i'm already here for 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:48.630
 the vagina of the body is genin so we got 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:50.130
 in maykravt further as soon as you do it 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:52.050
 done you will need to click on 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:55.380
 play button to change 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.130
 actually downloaded my binary files 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:59.160
 up to version 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:00.750
 164 click on the play button you have it 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.850
 downloaded close mikroft in 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.050
 Basically you will look like 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.450
 something like this 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:09.790
 click on the play I have been kraft lane 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.860
 downloaded therefore everything is enough 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.870
 quickly happened and exited minecraft 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:18.150
 click smokes after this again 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:18.150
 run our lancer 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.720
 all good for whom I silently we need 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.490

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.740

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.060
 in the video description 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:35.070
 here we choose the version of the rivers no 164 on 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.020
 This moment is 916 and the version I have on 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:41.990
 it is now running the server push 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.990
 on a reference and try the installer 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.420
 go through ado fly 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:54.159
 and actually download the installer itself 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:56.020
 ford 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:58.469
 as soon as we did it we 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.469
 run 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:03.520
 further he actually asks where 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:06.040
 us main mikroft is it really 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.899
 right place and then there are options 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.239
 install old client install 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:11.739
 server or just unpack we need 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:13.380
 select install client click a button 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:16.840

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:18.280
 sex son became a client profile forge for 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.390
 version 916 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:24.170
 now if we run again 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.170
 our minecraft 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:30.670
 we see what we have here 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.670
 another profile who is called forge 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:35.170
 Here he choose against the forge and click 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.990
 edit profile button 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:40.840
 what we need to do here we put 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:42.700
 tick the game directory and specify here 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.110
 Minecraft way where we 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:49.470
 there will be a server build 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:51.880
 Well, let's say the team indicated 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.890
 next we need to tick 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.690
 take a lancer and say what type 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:57.250
 zoan cheer up on this way if on 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:59.080
 something will happen wrong with our build 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.330
 we will be able to see the log itself for 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:03.690
 what we can not boot in addition 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:07.510
 We put a check jam argument and here 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:09.240
 write the next magic 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:12.600
 combination 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:14.700
 xx sperm says equals 256m it needs 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:16.440
 in order to minecraft with mods could 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:20.220
 normally start click the button with 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:22.200
 their profile after that that archive which 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.060
 you already downloaded on my website links 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.880
 not yet but it will appear there not only 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:29.730
 I will be ready to lay out 164 internet 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.830
 actually this archive will be in itself 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:36.800
 contain daddy stealth and in her 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:39.180
 minecraft itself select all files 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:43.010
 looking for daddy humongous which by the way 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:46.820
 he himself does not create need to create and 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:50.820
 we copy all contents in this folder 

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:54.360
 unpack unpacked now 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:58.040
 come back voucher here we all 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:58.040
 ok and press play 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:04.860
 mancraft began spinning minkravt to 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.750
 started loading 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:08.010
 here we can switch to development 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:11.820
 console to see 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:13.110
 actually what happens in this 

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:15.360
 assembly we got a little less 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:19.709
 bots not collecting what I added part 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:20.450
 Mods apparently the authors of the modifications a little 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:23.460
 differently 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:24.660
 released versions for 164 because it was 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.510
 so let's say build craft 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:28.800
 despite the fact that he put one file 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:32.130
 in fact there were six inside 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:34.610
 mods well this is a special case like 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:36.720
 the rule is still one file one mod 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:38.760
 we actually see a large number 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:42.530
 errors because the build is still in 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:42.530
 state such alpha-beta 

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:48.869
 half of the texture is not enough but not 

00:04:46.709 --> 00:04:51.719
 less we loaded minekravt as we 

00:04:48.869 --> 00:04:53.309
 We see version maynkrafta 16,498 mods 

00:04:51.719 --> 00:04:56.209
 then click on the multiplayer 

00:04:53.309 --> 00:04:56.209
 enter the address 

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:59.910
 proper to 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:02.330
 I will demonstrate even now 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:02.330
 server 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:12.539
 server starts 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.810
 and the server started 

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:20.270
 press the join key 

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:25.230
 and click the multiplayer button click 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:25.230
 join button 

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:30.550
 the world is plunging 

00:05:30.969 --> 00:05:36.459
 hello piggy and as we see with us 

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:41.579
 quite a good place to respawn 

00:05:36.459 --> 00:05:41.579
 it turned out for some reason really 

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:48.560
 everything looks a little strange without 

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:50.560
 optifine so better own such 

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:51.710
 here we will have spam on the version 

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:55.870
 164 

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:55.870
 well see you on the server is happy
