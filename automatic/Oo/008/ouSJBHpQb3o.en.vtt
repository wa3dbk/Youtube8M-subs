 hello bastards had a good time wanting to make a new video but 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.900
 I have a very dry and tied brain and I got divine inspiration the title 

00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:12.070
 says it all so let's start I wanted to leave these covers for the end but 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:16.320
 do not deserve to wait so long the band is nuclear of tui sun to good band of 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.580
 classic death metal but that does not matter to us right now let's see 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.499
 his horrible creations to acquisition jajajajajajajaja xdddd 

00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:29.339
 I'm not deceived these guys let their children make their covers 

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:33.170
 that kind of drawings are worthy of the last page of a notebook but not 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:38.550
 of a cover xd to admire in this other what good mix of colors totally 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.100
 it's art ahead of its time lie is a whore fuck xd 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.130
 another album of my favorites that has a shit for cover is the golf band 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:51.730
 in his disc of the same name let's see hahahahaha that pathetic hahahahaha 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:54.990

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:59.870
 God I can only say better luck for the next the next one is from me 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.040
 favorite band to see that I'm not a fan body the first time I saw this 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.070
 thing I said that's all 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:11.130
 and to think that this thing was censored in some countries I guess that by pre 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.710
 this other would not be so bad if it were not for the small detail that 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:19.010
 they forgot to color it with so much black and white I have no idea what the fuck 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:23.720
 I am seeing here I leave a gift to the friends of beast gol must I wish and 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.430
 well they improve that shit 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.630
 this cover is double-function you can play to find the members of the 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.970
 band as well as waldo xd i will point out to those who managed to see there is 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:38.190
 one there is another one that I think it's a head what the fuck is this 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:42.790
 what a good time you can spend with the planet if you do not see the immortal hahaha 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.720
 but of those many have already mocked before so let's move on to the next 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.190

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.250
 can compete with this acquisition 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:11.939
 there is a riddle 

00:02:11.939 --> 00:02:14.189
 which is worse than a bad cover 

00:02:14.189 --> 00:02:17.189
