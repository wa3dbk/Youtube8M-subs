season already they've beaten Clemson in
the<00:00:24.900> Virgin<00:00:25.230> Islands<00:00:25.710> I<00:00:25.859> watched<00:00:26.519> them<00:00:26.789> play

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
the Virgin Islands I watched them play

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.390 
the Virgin Islands I watched them play
against<00:00:27.359> a<00:00:27.449> very<00:00:27.660> talented<00:00:28.050> front<00:00:28.619> line<00:00:28.830> at

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
against a very talented front line at

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.290 
against a very talented front line at
LSU<00:00:30.240> and<00:00:30.480> really<00:00:31.199> the<00:00:31.349> game<00:00:31.560> was<00:00:31.969> about<00:00:32.969> three

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
LSU and really the game was about three

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.510 
LSU and really the game was about three
possessions<00:00:33.719> throughout<00:00:34.410> I<00:00:34.440> think<00:00:34.829> LSU<00:00:35.100> ended

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
possessions throughout I think LSU ended

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.030 
possessions throughout I think LSU ended
up<00:00:35.610> beating<00:00:35.850> them<00:00:36.090> by<00:00:36.239> about<00:00:36.480> ten<00:00:36.840> so<00:00:37.230> coming

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
up beating them by about ten so coming

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.310

damage in the second half Jerome Hill
number<00:00:54.420> 34<00:00:54.960> is<00:00:55.050> difficult<00:00:55.590> to<00:00:55.739> deal<00:00:55.949> with

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
number 34 is difficult to deal with

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.680 
number 34 is difficult to deal with
because<00:00:56.160> he's<00:00:56.699> also<00:00:56.879> an<00:00:57.149> excellent<00:00:57.390> passer

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
no question tonight was 15 assists to

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.580 
no question tonight was 15 assists to
one<00:04:05.489> turnover<00:04:05.759> and<00:04:06.629> if<00:04:06.900> you<00:04:06.989> think<00:04:07.019> about<00:04:07.290> that

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
one turnover and if you think about that

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:09.559 
one turnover and if you think about that
that's<00:04:07.769> a<00:04:08.069> very<00:04:08.400> dominating<00:04:09.030> type<00:04:09.359> of

00:04:09.559 --> 00:04:09.569 
that's a very dominating type of

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:11.990 
that's a very dominating type of
performance<00:04:09.870> as<00:04:10.439> a<00:04:10.470> playmaker<00:04:10.799> and<00:04:11.189> you<00:04:11.909> know

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
performance as a playmaker and you know

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.610 
performance as a playmaker and you know
I<00:04:12.030> thought<00:04:12.269> Parker<00:04:12.659> did<00:04:12.840> a<00:04:12.900> good<00:04:13.049> job<00:04:13.109> in<00:04:13.530> the

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
I thought Parker did a good job in the

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.860 
I thought Parker did a good job in the
second<00:04:14.040> half<00:04:14.189> on<00:04:14.370> defense<00:04:14.849> to<00:04:15.180> the<00:04:15.419> more

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:17.629 
second half on defense to the more
situations<00:04:16.590> that<00:04:16.799> he's<00:04:16.979> in<00:04:17.190> and<00:04:17.370> the<00:04:17.430> more<00:04:17.609> he

00:04:17.629 --> 00:04:17.639 
situations that he's in and the more he

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:20.149 
situations that he's in and the more he
understands<00:04:18.479> college<00:04:19.289> defense<00:04:19.739> the<00:04:19.949> better

00:04:20.149 --> 00:04:20.159 
understands college defense the better

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:23.089 
understands college defense the better
he'll<00:04:20.459> get<00:04:20.700> and<00:04:21.079> he<00:04:22.079> did<00:04:22.260> a<00:04:22.289> better<00:04:22.500> job<00:04:22.620> in<00:04:22.979> his
