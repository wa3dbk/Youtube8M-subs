00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.080
 hi to all and with these two tests 

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:09.820
 mobile.fr we are on the stand of lg 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:12.250
 it's a lot of people 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:14.680
 bazaar but we discovered something pretty 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:17.230
 Nice to show you then we are sure 

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:20.590
 at the g flex level and you've already seen 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:22.270
 jex ex with its semi curved screen 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:24.910
 flexible with also the battery is 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:27.970
 there we actually took out of his design 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:30.070
 you see it here for example that 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:32.829
 looks like that in working well 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:35.020
 heard with the flexible battery finally 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:39.789
 the battery yes semi flexible and curved 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:44.079
 right here it actually looks like that 

00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:45.789
 it is very very thin and curved and we 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:48.699
 exactly the same slab oled 

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:51.100
 oled plastic curved right here in 

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:52.329
 one that works the same way except 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.729
 that here she is much more 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:57.159
 more in curves as you can the 

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:57.459
 find it not quite 

00:00:57.159 --> 00:00:59.229
 well 

00:00:57.459 --> 00:01:00.370
 which is pretty interesting I think of 

00:00:59.229 --> 00:01:02.799
 note on it is that with this 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.989
 curve despite the curve see the middle 

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:06.549
 green green here you do not have any 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:08.740
 change in brightness no 

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:11.200
 change of light in order to 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:13.960
 discover it so it's rather rather 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.100
 nice me I think I think that 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.610
 it's still a good techno who 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.830
 offers us 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:21.760
 she is here the mix between the screen 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:23.080
 flexible and curved flexible and the 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.750
 battery that goes with I know that there is 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:29.220
 many of you who have who esteem 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:32.910
 that it's useless and we are 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:35.070
 in the state I'm not necessarily against 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:37.110
 I am I agree with you 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.640
 ultimately not even what I think 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.960
 that we can very well use a 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.190
 smartphone that is not curved there is 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.590
 it does not bring much 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.090
 honestly apart if you have a 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.100
 better actually a better 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.600
 immersion and added strength that 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.250
 it's two things we'd like 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.130
 test then the first point is going to be 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.660
 easy immersion the second point on 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.550
 the solidity I do not know if we will make a 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:59.630
 small drop thesis of the fleix that would 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:02.580
 nice I think when he will be out 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:05.550
 but anyway lg is convinced that 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:07.950
 that really in a few years all 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:10.500
 smartphones will be curved or 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:13.260
 almost so that shows that there is when 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.570
 even a big trend apparently and 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.459
 that it's not just an element 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.209
 technological to say look at us we 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:20.459
 is able to do it 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:21.300
 finally good said tell me besides this 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:23.760
 as you think in the comments 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:26.400
 about two here is there 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:30.530
 a future with curved screens on mobile 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.530
 of course go to more
