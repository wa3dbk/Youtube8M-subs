00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:20.140 
need a magnet so we'll start off by

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:25.200 
need a magnet so we'll start off by
using<00:00:20.619> the<00:00:21.070> Philips<00:00:21.730> screwdriver<00:00:22.449> and<00:00:24.210> we're

around<00:00:27.730> the<00:00:28.090> gearshift<00:00:29.019> knob<00:00:29.109> and<00:00:29.650> it<00:00:29.890> just

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:30.160 
around the gearshift knob and it just

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.369 
around the gearshift knob and it just
comes<00:00:30.699> off<00:00:30.910> so<00:00:31.630> you<00:00:31.689> have<00:00:31.720> to<00:00:31.900> start<00:00:32.169> from<00:00:32.290> the

clips that go when you're going to be

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:39.959 
clips that go when you're going to be
putting<00:00:36.040> it<00:00:36.219> back<00:00:36.370> after<00:00:38.250> you<00:00:39.250> have<00:00:39.370> to<00:00:39.550> first

00:00:39.959 --> 00:00:39.969

00:00:42.299 --> 00:00:42.309 
put these in and then put it down so

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:44.040 
put these in and then put it down so
which<00:00:42.910> is<00:00:43.059> going<00:00:43.239> to<00:00:43.300> move<00:00:43.450> it<00:00:43.570> to<00:00:43.719> the<00:00:43.840> side

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:44.050 
which is going to move it to the side

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.010 
which is going to move it to the side
and<00:00:44.969> right<00:00:45.969> away<00:00:46.210> you're<00:00:46.390> going<00:00:46.420> to<00:00:46.600> see<00:00:46.780> two

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:47.020 
and right away you're going to see two

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.250 
and right away you're going to see two
Philips<00:00:47.410> screws<00:00:47.469> and<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:49.059> next<00:00:49.719> step<00:00:49.899> is<00:00:50.079> to

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:50.260 
Philips screws and the next step is to

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:55.610 
Philips screws and the next step is to
remove<00:00:50.350> all<00:00:50.850> knobs<00:00:51.850> of<00:00:52.329> the<00:00:52.600> heater<00:00:53.440> controls

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
remove all knobs of the heater controls

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.959 
remove all knobs of the heater controls
so<00:00:56.620> once<00:00:56.949> you<00:00:57.100> remove<00:00:57.399> them<00:00:57.520> you're<00:00:57.699> going<00:00:57.850> to

00:00:57.959 --> 00:00:57.969 
so once you remove them you're going to

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:00.209 
so once you remove them you're going to
see<00:00:58.180> two<00:00:58.480> more<00:00:58.690> screws<00:00:59.110> so<00:00:59.469> we're<00:00:59.860> going<00:00:59.980> to<00:01:00.039> go

00:01:00.209 --> 00:01:00.219 
see two more screws so we're going to go

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:02.459 
see two more screws so we're going to go
ahead<00:01:00.460> and<00:01:00.640> remove<00:01:00.789> these<00:01:01.059> four<00:01:01.390> screws<00:01:01.469> so

00:01:02.459 --> 00:01:02.469 
ahead and remove these four screws so

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:04.350

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:06.700 
this whole panel around the radio is

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:07.920 
this whole panel around the radio is
going<00:01:06.760> to<00:01:06.970> come<00:01:07.119> off<00:01:07.299> and<00:01:07.600> we're<00:01:07.720> going<00:01:07.869> to

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:07.930 
going to come off and we're going to

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.100 
three on the other side so we're just

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.270 
three on the other side so we're just
going<00:01:27.400> to<00:01:27.460> put<00:01:27.880> this<00:01:28.090> to<00:01:28.360> the<00:01:28.390> side<00:01:29.130> we're<00:01:30.130> not

going to put this to the side we're not
going<00:01:30.460> to<00:01:30.549> disconnect<00:01:31.119> it<00:01:31.509> as<00:01:31.750> there's<00:01:32.439> the

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:32.799 
going to disconnect it as there's the

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:36.569 
going to disconnect it as there's the
water<00:01:33.729> for<00:01:34.000> the<00:01:34.090> airbag<00:01:34.450> and<00:01:35.189> once<00:01:36.189> you<00:01:36.310> remove

that<00:01:36.610> you're<00:01:36.939> going<00:01:37.090> to<00:01:37.210> see<00:01:37.420> a<00:01:37.659> 10<00:01:38.500> I<00:01:38.740> mean

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:39.549 
that you're going to see a 10 I mean

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:42.270 
that you're going to see a 10 I mean
four<00:01:40.030> 10<00:01:40.750> millimeter<00:01:40.799> bolts<00:01:41.799> holding<00:01:42.159> the

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.280 
four 10 millimeter bolts holding the

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.880 
four 10 millimeter bolts holding the
radio<00:01:42.579> and<00:01:43.049> this<00:01:44.049> is<00:01:44.200> where<00:01:44.350> we're<00:01:44.500> gonna<00:01:44.590> use

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:44.890 
radio and this is where we're gonna use

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.020 
radio and this is where we're gonna use
our<00:01:45.720> at<00:01:46.799> 10<00:01:47.799> millimeter<00:01:48.189> socket<00:01:48.280> with<00:01:48.909> an

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030 
our at 10 millimeter socket with an

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.870 
our at 10 millimeter socket with an
extension<00:01:49.119> and<00:01:49.780> I<00:01:50.649> mentioned<00:01:51.430> the<00:01:51.490> magnet

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
extension and I mentioned the magnet

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.730 
extension and I mentioned the magnet
before<00:01:52.240> when<00:01:52.869> you're<00:01:53.020> getting<00:01:53.290> the<00:01:53.439> screws

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:53.740 
before when you're getting the screws

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.580 
before when you're getting the screws
out<00:01:53.950> it's<00:01:54.310> good<00:01:54.939> to<00:01:55.060> have<00:01:55.210> a<00:01:55.240> magnet<00:01:55.750> so<00:01:56.020> you

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
out it's good to have a magnet so you

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.249 
out it's good to have a magnet so you
can<00:01:56.740> remove<00:01:57.100> them<00:01:57.360> with<00:01:58.360> with<00:01:58.750> the<00:01:58.869> magnet

00:01:59.249 --> 00:01:59.259 
can remove them with with the magnet

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:01.230 
can remove them with with the magnet
instead<00:01:59.770> of<00:01:59.979> them<00:02:00.159> falling<00:02:00.549> behind<00:02:00.700> the<00:02:00.969> radio

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:01.240 
instead of them falling behind the radio

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:02.760 
instead of them falling behind the radio
so<00:02:01.600> we're<00:02:01.750> going<00:02:01.840> to<00:02:01.930> go<00:02:02.079> ahead<00:02:02.200> and<00:02:02.590> remove

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
so we're going to go ahead and remove

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.060

00:06:05.379 --> 00:06:05.389 
this is this pocket above the above the

00:06:05.389 --> 00:06:09.219 
this is this pocket above the above the
radio<00:06:05.930> so<00:06:06.919> you<00:06:07.430> can<00:06:07.639> drill<00:06:08.300> a<00:06:08.330> hole<00:06:08.600> in<00:06:08.870> the

00:06:09.219 --> 00:06:09.229 
radio so you can drill a hole in the

00:06:09.229 --> 00:06:12.340 
radio so you can drill a hole in the
bottom<00:06:09.620> here<00:06:09.889> and<00:06:10.570> just<00:06:11.570> have<00:06:11.720> the<00:06:11.840> two<00:06:11.960> cables

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:12.350 
bottom here and just have the two cables

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:16.570 
bottom here and just have the two cables
coming<00:06:12.590> out<00:06:12.770> through<00:06:13.009> here<00:06:13.310> and<00:06:14.590> once<00:06:15.590> you

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:16.580 
coming out through here and once you

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:18.460 
coming out through here and once you
finish<00:06:16.910> listening<00:06:17.240> you<00:06:17.660> can<00:06:17.720> just<00:06:17.990> hide<00:06:18.320> the

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:18.470 
finish listening you can just hide the

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:21.040 
finish listening you can just hide the
cables<00:06:18.860> there<00:06:19.100> and<00:06:19.280> close<00:06:19.729> it<00:06:19.970> so<00:06:20.720> we<00:06:20.840> think

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:21.050 
cables there and close it so we think

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:25.360 
cables there and close it so we think
it's<00:06:21.229> pretty<00:06:21.860> good<00:06:22.070> spot<00:06:22.370> and<00:06:24.039> that's<00:06:25.039> pretty

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:25.370 
it's pretty good spot and that's pretty

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:27.640 
it's pretty good spot and that's pretty
much<00:06:25.520> it<00:06:25.820> that's<00:06:25.850> for<00:06:26.389> the<00:06:26.630> installation<00:06:26.930> star

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:27.650 
much it that's for the installation star

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:31.480 
much it that's for the installation star
so<00:06:28.310> this<00:06:28.460> was<00:06:28.669> the<00:06:28.820> video<00:06:28.970> for<00:06:30.009> GTA<00:06:31.009> car<00:06:31.250> kits
