Rubik's Cube tutorial and I will be

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.230 
Rubik's Cube tutorial and I will be
teaching<00:00:06.029> you<00:00:06.390> the<00:00:06.720> layers<00:00:07.170> method<00:00:08.059> but<00:00:09.059> first

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
teaching you the layers method but first

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.490 
teaching you the layers method but first
things<00:00:09.480> first<00:00:09.570> we're<00:00:10.170> going<00:00:10.260> to<00:00:10.349> need<00:00:10.410> to

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
things first we're going to need to

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.940 
things first we're going to need to
learn<00:00:10.650> some<00:00:10.710> basic<00:00:11.429> Rubik's<00:00:11.790> Cube<00:00:12.059> notation

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:12.950 
learn some basic Rubik's Cube notation

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:17.710 
learn some basic Rubik's Cube notation
alright<00:00:13.950> so<00:00:14.549> each<00:00:14.880> side<00:00:15.269> is<00:00:15.710> given<00:00:16.710> a<00:00:16.920> letter

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:17.720 
alright so each side is given a letter

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:22.429 
alright so each side is given a letter
the<00:00:18.720> top<00:00:18.930> side<00:00:19.230> is<00:00:19.529> up<00:00:19.949> and<00:00:20.400> that<00:00:20.550> is<00:00:20.699> you<00:00:21.439> all

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
the top side is up and that is you all

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.609 
the top side is up and that is you all
right<00:00:22.710> left<00:00:23.519> side<00:00:23.789> is<00:00:24.119> l<00:00:25.220> right<00:00:26.220> side<00:00:26.550> is<00:00:26.820> are

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:27.619 
right left side is l right side is are

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:34.400 
right left side is l right side is are
the<00:00:28.619> face<00:00:28.920> is<00:00:29.279> f<00:00:30.289> the<00:00:31.289> back<00:00:31.560> side<00:00:31.890> b<00:00:32.759> and<00:00:33.410> the

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
the face is f the back side b and the

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:40.549 
the face is f the back side b and the
bottom<00:00:34.800> is<00:00:34.950> d<00:00:37.670> now<00:00:38.670> when<00:00:38.879> you<00:00:39.000> see<00:00:39.329> a<00:00:39.600> letter<00:00:40.290> by

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
bottom is d now when you see a letter by

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.369 
bottom is d now when you see a letter by
itself<00:00:41.149> that<00:00:42.149> means<00:00:42.360> you<00:00:42.570> turn<00:00:42.809> that<00:00:43.079> face

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
itself that means you turn that face

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:50.060 
itself that means you turn that face
clockwise<00:00:44.329> once<00:00:46.640> alright<00:00:48.680> so<00:00:49.680> if<00:00:49.800> you<00:00:49.920> were<00:00:49.980> to

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
clockwise once alright so if you were to

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:58.040 
clockwise once alright so if you were to
see<00:00:51.079> d<00:00:52.079> by<00:00:52.320> itself<00:00:53.750> down<00:00:54.750> clockwise<00:00:55.530> once<00:00:57.050> now

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
see d by itself down clockwise once now

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.430 
see d by itself down clockwise once now
if<00:00:58.410> you<00:00:58.770> see<00:00:58.949> a<00:00:58.980> letter<00:00:59.160> with<00:00:59.399> an<00:00:59.520> apostrophe

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
if you see a letter with an apostrophe

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.130 
if you see a letter with an apostrophe
that<00:01:01.440> means<00:01:02.359> prime<00:01:03.359> which<00:01:04.110> is

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
that means prime which is

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.310 
that means prime which is
counterclockwise<00:01:05.600> so<00:01:06.600> if<00:01:06.720> you<00:01:06.840> were<00:01:06.930> just<00:01:07.140> say

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
counterclockwise so if you were just say

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.170 
counterclockwise so if you were just say
see<00:01:07.860> our<00:01:08.240> prime<00:01:09.240> that<00:01:09.990> would<00:01:10.170> be<00:01:10.350> our<00:01:11.180> counter

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
see our prime that would be our counter

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.899 
see our prime that would be our counter
clockwise<00:01:12.950> or<00:01:13.950> L<00:01:14.420> counterclockwise<00:01:16.909> all

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
clockwise or L counterclockwise all

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.990 
clockwise or L counterclockwise all
right<00:01:18.229> now<00:01:19.229> let's<00:01:19.409> get<00:01:19.590> started<00:01:20.009> alright<00:01:20.820> so

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
right now let's get started alright so

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.370 
right now let's get started alright so
once<00:01:21.150> you<00:01:21.240> have<00:01:21.270> your<00:01:21.390> boobs<00:01:21.659> keep<00:01:21.780> scrambled

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
once you have your boobs keep scrambled

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.820 
once you have your boobs keep scrambled
you<00:01:23.070> can<00:01:23.250> begin<00:01:23.369> to<00:01:23.490> solve<00:01:23.790> it<00:01:24.590> now<00:01:25.590> for<00:01:25.770> the

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
you can begin to solve it now for the

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.410 
you can begin to solve it now for the
layers<00:01:26.009> method<00:01:26.520> you're<00:01:27.090> going<00:01:27.210> to<00:01:27.270> want<00:01:27.360> to

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
layers method you're going to want to

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.620 
layers method you're going to want to
make<00:01:27.600> a<00:01:27.930> white<00:01:28.799> cross<00:01:29.180> with<00:01:30.180> these<00:01:30.390> edge

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
make a white cross with these edge

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.800 
make a white cross with these edge
pieces<00:01:31.790> so<00:01:32.790> we<00:01:32.820> already<00:01:33.090> have<00:01:33.180> one<00:01:33.450> in<00:01:33.570> place

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
pieces so we already have one in place

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.149 
pieces so we already have one in place
right<00:01:34.079> here<00:01:34.850> now<00:01:35.850> you<00:01:35.909> look<00:01:36.210> at<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:37.350> opposite

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
right here now you look at the opposite

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.370 
right here now you look at the opposite
edge<00:01:38.369> which<00:01:38.880> is<00:01:39.000> right<00:01:39.240> here<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.810> color<00:01:40.049> on

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
edge which is right here the color on

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.429 
edge which is right here the color on
the<00:01:40.500> other<00:01:40.710> side<00:01:41.040> it's<00:01:41.520> green<00:01:41.939> now<00:01:42.439> what

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
the other side it's green now what

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.200 
the other side it's green now what
you're<00:01:43.530> going<00:01:43.649> to<00:01:43.710> want<00:01:43.799> to<00:01:43.860> do<00:01:44.009> is<00:01:44.250> find<00:01:45.060> a

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
you're going to want to do is find a

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:51.010 
you're going to want to do is find a
green<00:01:45.540> center<00:01:46.140> and<00:01:47.720> then<00:01:48.720> line<00:01:49.439> those<00:01:49.770> two<00:01:50.070> up

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
green center and then line those two up

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.950 
green center and then line those two up
all<00:01:52.020> right<00:01:52.229> now<00:01:52.500> we<00:01:52.560> have<00:01:52.740> that<00:01:52.890> lined<00:01:53.100> up<00:01:53.960> now

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
all right now we have that lined up now

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.709 
all right now we have that lined up now
we're<00:01:55.140> going<00:01:55.259> to<00:01:55.409> do<00:01:55.530> is<00:01:56.119> find<00:01:57.119> more<00:01:57.509> white

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
we're going to do is find more white

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.819 
we're going to do is find more white
edges<00:01:58.610> here's<00:01:59.610> a<00:01:59.670> white<00:01:59.850> edge<00:01:59.969> right<00:02:00.149> here<00:02:00.829> so

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
edges here's a white edge right here so

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:08.770 
edges here's a white edge right here so
we're<00:02:02.490> going<00:02:02.579> to<00:02:02.820> put<00:02:02.939> that<00:02:03.119> one<00:02:03.329> on<00:02:03.540> top

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:28.430 

what's<00:02:18.980> you<00:02:19.980> series<00:02:20.490> it<00:02:20.670> is<00:02:25.010> happening<00:02:27.440> it's

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
what's you series it is happening it's

00:02:28.440 --> 00:03:21.500 
what's you series it is happening it's
not<00:02:28.680> even<00:02:28.830> my<00:02:29.070> cube<00:02:41.720> broke<00:02:56.989> my<00:02:57.989> life<00:03:20.510> and

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
not even my cube broke my life and

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.549 
not even my cube broke my life and
that's<00:03:22.470> how<00:03:22.709> you<00:03:22.769> solve<00:03:22.980> a<00:03:23.160> 3<00:03:23.400> by<00:03:23.519> 3
