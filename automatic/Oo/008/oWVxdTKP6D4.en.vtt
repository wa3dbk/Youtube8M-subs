00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:04.810
 greetings friends and welcome to this 

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:06.759
 where as manage video title as 

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:09.820
 we will be giving the results of the 

00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:12.040
 monte and night raw today 3 of 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:13.240
 February of the year 2014 but in 30 in 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.339
 matter as you always know that 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.600
 little bee in the box is my link follow 

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:18.970
 subscribing without starting the channel 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:21.970
 meaning like here too 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:26.640
 is the link for facebook and likewise 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:26.640
 do not forget to check the page 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.469
 www.radiosolobasket.com a strong the 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:53.079
 lack of the main event air especially 

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:55.449
 now that without doing he injured in a in a 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:59.499
 house and the lack of time before 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:01:02.829
 it really gives us a result of a robbery 

00:00:59.499 --> 00:01:04.630
 very mediocre taking into account the the 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:06.880
 epoch in which we find ourselves not that 

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:10.060
 it's really the way 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:13.270
 summary number 30 starts modeling the rock 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:15.939
 with a stupid promo from orton of the 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:18.070
 that the truth is that we are already 

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:21.369
 mother always hear the same thing seems 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:23.049
 triple h and stephanie saying that he is going 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:25.149
 to face daniel bryan in the main 

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:27.880
 event but good let's go to what follows 

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:30.610
 we quickly have a fight of three 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:34.450
 against three where the shield takes 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:36.700
 a victory against mystery with 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.880
 kingston and they watch that they are really a 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.170
 very very fast fight 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.319
 obviously you have to keep getting 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:46.599
 the desire domain of entering your 

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:48.490
 combat against the whites and it fits 

00:01:46.599 --> 00:01:52.420
 highlight that román ring takes to a 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:56.110
 very very strong blow to the height of the 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:59.380
 eyebrow courtesy of a knee unintentionally 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:01.829
 accidental that billington gives but 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:04.790
 well at the end of the day in a fight that 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:07.460
 you saw what was going 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:09.860
 then there is a promo cut by the 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:12.260
 Guayas also the particular thing if I do 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.730
 enjoy the strange and bizarre cuts 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.760
 of the guayas not at the end of the day I 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:19.520
 I think since the wyatt debuted 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.740
 it was talked about a lot, not a 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.990
 confrontation between these two factions 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:26.480
 and then we will have elimination 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:28.010
 elimination chamber to my point of view 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.280
 I think that being better in verse 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:33.350
 medium but good is what there is as 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.510
 they say out there and good gentlemen after 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:37.550
 we have a fight where cristian is 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.230
 facing the jack swagger here fits 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:42.080
 clarify that also jack swagger comes out 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:44.390
 bleeding if it 's a strong blow in the in 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:47.209
 the mouth and well I do not know why out there I 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:50.540
 I think he's already smelling me that he's going to 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:53.300
 to be imminent the breaking of the all 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:55.160
 americans in the near future after 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.840
 we have the championships in pairs where 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:00.470
 the champions the new way out the 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:03.230
 they would be defending their titles against 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:05.450
 choreo road siguado is in one in a 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:08.570
 Steel cage really good fight 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:10.490
 I must say I say these four have a 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:12.920
 excellent chemistry of the quadrilateral 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:15.080
 and at the end it is worth highlighting a moonsault 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:18.410
 that corey brock is thrown from him 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:20.570
 from the top of the cage 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:22.220
 I was really just bastard 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:24.020
 I think a little bit of error out there already 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:27.230
 that I think swiftly 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:29.390
 jesse james must have been a little 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:32.360
 later to catch either 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:34.670
 cody ross the two took a madrazo 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:38.990
 very impressive but the levels out 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:41.180
 they retain their championships in pairs 

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:43.010
 then we go to a fight of procedure 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:45.470
 o'neal trailers the new one is eros in the 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:47.390
 rough after the break of the 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:50.420
 iron on player takes victory 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:52.550
 about nothing more and nothing less than zack 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:54.260
 ryder I did not even remember that this bastard 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:57.560
 existed but good 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:04:00.470
 then we have a dance segment 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:03.500
 where we have the debut in row de de emma 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:05.150
 watson and well I really think that time 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.760
 say this let's go to what follows is the 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:09.980
 museum a victory over clarisa that 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.480
 comes out in a fight that I think had a 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:13.520
 very good amount of time but 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:15.200
 really because there is nothing impressive 

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:16.310
 what to say 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.380
 about this not 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:20.989
 and then we have a segment where 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:23.660
 cambric 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:25.460
 comes out in the ring appears Alberto 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:28.370
 river if someone is interested in seeing 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:30.440
 Alberto of the river against batista because 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:32.599
 please burn me for the reasons 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:35.660
 why because I really do not think 

00:04:32.599 --> 00:04:37.669
 it makes no sense alberto del río and 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:41.240
 against batista I really think I know 

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:43.130
 they took out of the sleeve totally and then and 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:46.069
 well, I know you can say no 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:47.990
 this simply to give a fight to 

00:04:46.069 --> 00:04:50.030
 batista in mini teinver and 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:52.310
 unfortunately Albert of the river is going to 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:54.979
 be the me see for batista in that fight 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:56.810
 then we have a fight of also from 

00:04:54.979 --> 00:05:00.020
 three against three now the wyatt are 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:01.849
 they were facing the cross is displayed 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:04.430
 boots and nothing more and nothing less than two 

00:05:01.849 --> 00:05:06.319
 still the whites obviously have 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:07.880
 that to take the pity victory that at 

00:05:06.319 --> 00:05:09.349
 they told him that 34 

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:11.080
 Sígler would have preferred that they saw each other 

00:05:09.349 --> 00:05:13.819
 in any of the other two idiots 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:16.039
 but good really because the guayas 

00:05:13.819 --> 00:05:18.199
 keeping the pace strong for your 

00:05:16.039 --> 00:05:20.720
 confrontation against the field after 

00:05:18.199 --> 00:05:22.880
 we have a divas fight where naomi 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:24.889
 a victory over aksana and 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:26.690
 as I had already mentioned in 

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:27.380
 previously really what good talent 

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:30.530
 is 

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:33.380
 Naomi really is this girl is one 

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:36.470
 of the best talents that the 

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:38.810
 olive atole today back in that in 

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:41.330
 that what room if it were not for this 

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:44.510
 chava and by natalia and obviously yale 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:46.550
 and this but rather in yale and no no 

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:49.310
 has so much captan cya technique in the 

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:51.170
 ring but rather it's one is a quality 

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:53.540
 impressive in the promos a fight 

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:55.820
 psychological are not bad in the ring but 

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:58.400
 It is not the best but really the omnia 

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:59.720
 this girl raffs hard and then 

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:01.880
 let's hope he has a 

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:04.130
 opportunity for the title is paid a 

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:06.380
 victory in the fight not so bad against 

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:08.600
 healthy and really fits here fits 

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:12.440
 point out that also aksana I put a 

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:15.830
 click click impress kneed 

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:17.930
 the height of the eye to aa naomi where by 

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:20.840
 some moments it looked like I did not know 

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:22.760
 where was not really a hit then 

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:24.710
 I do not know whether to say it as bad 

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:27.350
 because it left that it looked very intentional 

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:29.330
 but I do like that he was half average 

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:31.460
 that has won me but not really good 

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:33.440
 good fight to do to do 

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:37.250
 nothing more and nothing less 

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:38.720
 fight between the divas and finally 

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:40.700
 we have what would be the main 

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:42.770
 event randy orton facing daniel 

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:45.170
 Bryan really a very good fight and 

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:47.960
 above all what he boasts is that already 

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:50.090
 Bryant takes the clean victory 123 

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:51.800
 against randy orton I'm surprised that 

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:54.230
 orton does the job to daniel bryan 

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:55.880
 I really applaud him and it fits 

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:59.300
 highlight that all over the world night raw 

00:06:55.880 --> 00:07:02.000
 they follow the the songs of 

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:04.730
 100% pop daniel bryan daniel bryan 

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.790
 really for the whole length of the world and 

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:11.120
 neutral and will surely continue with the 

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:13.790
 spend the day on the way to the great 

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:15.650
 event in the operations is already finished a 

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:17.690
 monte night raw that really there is not 

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:19.220
 much to really say many of the 

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:23.710
 stories because they did not even have 

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:26.540
 some progress and good to highlight 

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:28.880
 the intervention of kane in in the fight 

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:30.770
 from daniel bryan and randy orton this does not 

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:32.870
 had repercussions of announcing the 

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:35.150
 victory but good gentlemen so we just 

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:36.849
 the night raw we hope that the next 

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:39.159
 Well, have a 

00:07:36.849 --> 00:07:41.589
 a much more interesting programming 

00:07:39.159 --> 00:07:44.050
 over all the way to the great see the 

00:07:41.589 --> 00:07:46.749
 great event that would be the super 

00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:49.059
 wrestling bowl in the double 

00:07:46.749 --> 00:07:51.399
 theology and good gentlemen continue without 

00:07:49.059 --> 00:07:55.740
 bailing the channel keep subscribing 

00:07:51.399 --> 00:07:55.740
 of like and we are seeing biker
