00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:08.429
 the rush hour rotterdam pieces played 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.010
 rotterdam strong skaters for your country according to a playable is a problem 

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:15.009
 the festival is climbed perfectly such strong figures 

00:00:16.169 --> 00:00:19.800
 You state I have to be an administrative person like the upset ones 

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:22.030
 analysts predict to be an amplifier 

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:25.509
 as long as they are stuck 

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:29.009
 it is not for nothing that the pieces are a heavy storm according to lockheed that murder 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:31.809
 not like the cyclists 

00:00:31.809 --> 00:00:34.809
 all on behalf of the management of ing i am 18 years old

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:43.980
 specialized assistance 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.090
 thirteenth 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.670
 I could redo 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:47.930
 juggling 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:49.830
 and that war 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:54.710
 since in construction pascal actually aware that this school would be here 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:55.890
 come 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.060
 and it is 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:00.060
 very close to me because I already live in Rotterdam 

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:06.240
 yesterday the tracks were the netherlands in tilburg 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.970
 and everyone else 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.040
 I am I have loved the top of Columbia that I already knew you people 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.670
 and teachers 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.670
 it's closer so it was for me and all 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:23.460
 camps easier 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.600
 send by the press 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.600
 the best two per cent less profit to be disturbed 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.440
 it also strengthened without problem saying they didn't know it a lot stronger 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.440
 spyker center becomes 4 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.000
 they have since invested without a trace, it is a service and quality 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:47.170
 I'm just through 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.170
 set up 6 by 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.250
 a trial number of these objects I am 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.560
 now five years involved in an accident with a hot air balloon I just don't have enough 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.140
 of so 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.140
 an exteriors my principles of it is a special sensors 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.780
 since being a swiss nestlÃ©, the beauty between two sets was too strong 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.279
 before 6 

00:02:13.279 --> 00:02:16.279
 the response is super proud with a crisis plan 

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:22.629
 the municipality has been a striking work of art since our church this is not 

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:23.859
 one with roo 

00:02:23.859 --> 00:02:27.629
 It was then about one of the plans I later abandoned 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:31.209
 usually no I mean request theaters or 

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:38.209
 cancer fabrications hit 9 

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:44.189
 what a strong start as the best drivers also to do with a strong one 

00:02:44.189 --> 00:02:47.189
 have earned personality 

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:56.879
 20 euros a little bit 

00:02:58.699 --> 00:03:00.749
 very little bit of piano 

00:03:00.749 --> 00:03:02.249
 traffic becomes 

00:03:02.249 --> 00:03:04.779
 for me it's a kind of important role 

00:03:04.779 --> 00:03:05.859
 be out of it 

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:09.169
 I personally think that its market value 

00:03:09.169 --> 00:03:10.409
 9 

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:12.209
 worth two million dollars 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:15.239
 so it is possible that the car was standing with a player 

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:17.579
 2 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:20.089
 Leroy Fer is to be present 

00:03:20.089 --> 00:03:23.089
 that's what the trainer says 

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:26.599
 also end up 

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:31.399
 it is no good to get a little bit of money and it seems here 

00:03:31.399 --> 00:03:34.109
 come 

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:37.569
 and it is 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:39.940
 super intermediaries a customer 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.130
 10,000 euro drivers in the world play my coming 

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:47.529
 people who work around 

00:03:47.529 --> 00:03:49.979
 as long as there is an effort 

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:54.159
 and that it is therefore not at all so best I am still right and now I have 

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:57.049
 understand them afterwards 

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:00.749
 most show what I can expect they can stay 

00:04:24.029 --> 00:04:26.680
 fortunately still doubt 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.680
 the shrinking world broadcaster 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.009
 but example in this way 

00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:36.009
 are a fan during the night 

00:04:47.779 --> 00:04:50.800
 like i hope i like this one 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.800
 nice finish 

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:03.520
 and you can check that 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:04.330
 for the company
