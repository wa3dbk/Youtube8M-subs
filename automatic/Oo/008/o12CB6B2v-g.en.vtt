hey guys welcome to another minecraft
tutorial<00:00:02.970> I<00:00:03.179> just<00:00:03.570> quickly<00:00:03.810> rigged<00:00:04.170> up<00:00:04.319> a

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:04.470 
tutorial I just quickly rigged up a

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.920 
tutorial I just quickly rigged up a
cobblestone<00:00:04.830> generator<00:00:05.279> yo<00:00:06.000> show<00:00:06.720> you<00:00:06.779> guys

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
cobblestone generator yo show you guys

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.530 
cobblestone generator yo show you guys
how<00:00:06.990> to<00:00:07.140> do<00:00:07.350> that<00:00:07.529> and<00:00:07.770> let<00:00:08.639> us<00:00:08.790> set<00:00:08.970> it<00:00:09.059> up<00:00:09.150> with

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
how to do that and let us set it up with

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.270 
how to do that and let us set it up with
a<00:00:09.599> bunch<00:00:09.929> of<00:00:10.050> Pistons<00:00:10.500> but<00:00:10.740> automatically

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
a bunch of Pistons but automatically

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.370 
a bunch of Pistons but automatically
build<00:00:11.580> a<00:00:11.670> wall<00:00:11.910> we<00:00:12.570> can<00:00:12.780> build<00:00:12.900> a<00:00:13.049> floor

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
build a wall we can build a floor

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.070 
build a wall we can build a floor
whatever<00:00:13.679> you<00:00:13.889> want<00:00:14.070> pretty<00:00:14.250> much<00:00:14.990> so<00:00:15.990> what

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
whatever you want pretty much so what

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.840 
whatever you want pretty much so what
I've<00:00:16.199> got<00:00:16.440> here<00:00:16.470> is<00:00:16.830> the<00:00:17.130> cobblestone

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
I've got here is the cobblestone

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.410 
I've got here is the cobblestone
generator<00:00:17.880> it's<00:00:18.810> just<00:00:19.050> one<00:00:19.230> block<00:00:19.439> a<00:00:19.500> lava<00:00:20.420> one

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
generator it's just one block a lava one

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.210 
generator it's just one block a lava one
blank<00:00:21.990> block<00:00:22.260> you<00:00:22.470> just<00:00:22.619> put<00:00:22.769> cobblestone

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
blank block you just put cobblestone

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.950 
blank block you just put cobblestone
there<00:00:23.400> where<00:00:23.580> you<00:00:23.640> building<00:00:23.939> it<00:00:24.000> and<00:00:24.240> then<00:00:24.930> a

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
there where you building it and then a

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.810 
there where you building it and then a
double<00:00:25.410> water<00:00:25.650> block<00:00:25.949> we've<00:00:26.310> just<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:26.640> hole

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
double water block we've just the hole

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.429 
double water block we've just the hole
on<00:00:26.849> this<00:00:27.150> side<00:00:27.390> to<00:00:27.599> make<00:00:27.689> the<00:00:27.840> water<00:00:28.050> flow<00:00:28.289> that

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
on this side to make the water flow that

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.259 
on this side to make the water flow that
way<00:00:28.619> instead<00:00:29.250> of<00:00:29.490> going<00:00:29.670> this<00:00:29.760> way<00:00:29.970> and<00:00:30.000> making

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
way instead of going this way and making

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.990 
way instead of going this way and making
upset<00:00:30.689> him<00:00:30.840> here<00:00:31.520> and<00:00:32.520> then<00:00:32.669> you<00:00:32.759> just<00:00:32.880> get

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
upset him here and then you just get

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.400 
upset him here and then you just get
your<00:00:33.090> piston<00:00:33.300> pushing<00:00:33.870> it<00:00:33.960> out<00:00:34.020> pretty<00:00:34.320> much

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
your piston pushing it out pretty much

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.840 
your piston pushing it out pretty much
and<00:00:36.230> now<00:00:37.230> this<00:00:37.380> bits<00:00:37.620> all<00:00:37.739> about<00:00:37.980> timing<00:00:38.309> what

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
and now this bits all about timing what

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.720 
and now this bits all about timing what
I've<00:00:38.969> got<00:00:39.030> is<00:00:39.210> 4<00:00:39.540> ep<00:00:39.870> 20<00:00:40.160> all<00:00:41.160> on<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:41.520> max

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
I've got is 4 ep 20 all on the max

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.660 
I've got is 4 ep 20 all on the max
timing<00:00:42.320> that<00:00:43.320> seems<00:00:43.620> to<00:00:43.739> be<00:00:43.829> about<00:00:44.160> right<00:00:44.430> for

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
timing that seems to be about right for

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.139 
timing that seems to be about right for
when<00:00:44.820> their<00:00:45.059> cobblestones<00:00:45.600> forms<00:00:46.340> the<00:00:47.340> piston

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
when their cobblestones forms the piston

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.060 
when their cobblestones forms the piston
will<00:00:48.270> push<00:00:48.480> it<00:00:48.629> out<00:00:48.780> as<00:00:49.440> long<00:00:49.469> as<00:00:49.620> nothing<00:00:49.829> is

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
will push it out as long as nothing is

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.779 
will push it out as long as nothing is
blocking<00:00:50.250> it<00:00:50.460> down<00:00:50.760> further<00:00:51.570> down<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:51.960> track

00:00:52.779 --> 00:00:52.789 
blocking it down further down the track

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:55.010 
blocking it down further down the track
and<00:00:53.789> there<00:00:54.059> we<00:00:54.180> go<00:00:54.300> it's<00:00:54.480> pushing<00:00:54.719> it<00:00:54.930> out

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
and there we go it's pushing it out

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.220 
and there we go it's pushing it out
pretty<00:00:55.230> good<00:00:55.379> now<00:00:55.590> and<00:00:56.719> I've<00:00:57.719> just<00:00:57.899> got<00:00:58.079> that

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
pretty good now and I've just got that

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.799 
pretty good now and I've just got that
activated<00:00:58.710> by<00:00:58.949> button<00:00:59.430> you<00:01:00.329> can<00:01:00.449> use<00:01:00.629> whatever

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
activated by button you can use whatever

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.840 
activated by button you can use whatever
you<00:01:01.020> want<00:01:01.260> I've<00:01:01.949> just<00:01:02.010> got<00:01:02.280> a<00:01:02.309> bottom<00:01:02.520> because

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
you want I've just got a bottom because

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.570 
you want I've just got a bottom because
I've<00:01:02.940> got<00:01:03.059> it<00:01:03.149> setting<00:01:03.449> off<00:01:03.539> both<00:01:03.809> my<00:01:03.840> I'm

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:04.580 
I've got it setting off both my I'm

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.390 
I've got it setting off both my I'm
little<00:01:05.580> loops<00:01:05.820> at<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.060> same<00:01:06.330> time<00:01:07.220> so<00:01:08.220> once

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
little loops at the same time so once

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.950 
little loops at the same time so once
you've<00:01:08.520> got<00:01:08.640> that<00:01:08.670> redstone<00:01:09.210> loop<00:01:09.570> set<00:01:09.810> up

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
you've got that redstone loop set up

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.600 
you've got that redstone loop set up
that'll<00:01:10.320> be<00:01:10.409> pushing<00:01:10.770> out<00:01:10.890> cobblestone<00:01:11.430> just

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
that'll be pushing out cobblestone just

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.450 
that'll be pushing out cobblestone just
going<00:01:11.790> straight<00:01:12.000> across<00:01:12.210> and<00:01:12.710> you'll<00:01:13.710> have<00:01:13.830> 16

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
going straight across and you'll have 16

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.899 
going straight across and you'll have 16
blocks<00:01:14.670> i<00:01:14.909> think<00:01:15.090> it<00:01:15.180> is<00:01:15.270> it<00:01:15.479> stops<00:01:15.750> right<00:01:16.470> here

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:16.909 
blocks i think it is it stops right here

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:19.039 
blocks i think it is it stops right here
and<00:01:17.909> then<00:01:18.030> if<00:01:18.119> you<00:01:18.210> want<00:01:18.390> it<00:01:18.450> to<00:01:18.540> go<00:01:18.659> up<00:01:18.869> and

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
and then if you want it to go up and

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.380 
and then if you want it to go up and
build<00:01:19.259> a<00:01:19.350> wall<00:01:19.560> or<00:01:19.860> a<00:01:19.950> cross<00:01:20.640> to<00:01:20.850> build<00:01:21.000> a<00:01:21.090> floor

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
build a wall or a cross to build a floor

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.330 
build a wall or a cross to build a floor
just<00:01:22.140> need<00:01:22.320> to<00:01:22.409> set<00:01:22.560> up<00:01:22.650> another<00:01:22.860> little<00:01:23.189> red

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
just need to set up another little red

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.300 
just need to set up another little red
stone<00:01:23.640> loop<00:01:23.880> I<00:01:24.180> like<00:01:24.990> to<00:01:25.140> use<00:01:25.290> 5<00:01:25.590> repeaters<00:01:26.159> for

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
stone loop I like to use 5 repeaters for

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.130 
stone loop I like to use 5 repeaters for
this<00:01:26.430> one<00:01:26.580> because<00:01:27.299> you<00:01:27.450> want<00:01:27.600> it<00:01:27.630> to<00:01:27.750> be<00:01:27.780> a<00:01:27.900> bit

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
this one because you want it to be a bit

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.450 
this one because you want it to be a bit
longer<00:01:28.320> delay<00:01:28.799> to<00:01:28.860> make<00:01:29.159> sure<00:01:29.340> the

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
longer delay to make sure the

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.719 
longer delay to make sure the
cobblestones<00:01:29.970> getting<00:01:30.270> pushed<00:01:30.509> out<00:01:30.689> and<00:01:31.729> this

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
cobblestones getting pushed out and this

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.719 
cobblestones getting pushed out and this
repeater<00:01:33.240> er<00:01:33.659> is<00:01:33.869> just<00:01:34.740> to<00:01:34.860> extend<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.340> signal

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
repeater er is just to extend the signal

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.929 
repeater er is just to extend the signal
to<00:01:35.759> make<00:01:36.000> sure<00:01:36.150> it<00:01:36.240> gets<00:01:36.299> to<00:01:36.450> all<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.780> Pistons

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:37.939 
to make sure it gets to all the Pistons

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:40.249 
to make sure it gets to all the Pistons
once<00:01:38.939> you've<00:01:39.119> done<00:01:39.270> that<00:01:39.329> pretty<00:01:39.689> much<00:01:39.900> just

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
once you've done that pretty much just

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.399 
once you've done that pretty much just
the<00:01:40.380> basic<00:01:40.890> wiring<00:01:41.159> and<00:01:41.430> up<00:01:41.549> I've<00:01:41.880> just<00:01:42.659> got<00:01:43.140> a

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
the basic wiring and up I've just got a

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.499 
the basic wiring and up I've just got a
redstone<00:01:44.070> torch<00:01:44.220> underneath<00:01:44.909> this<00:01:45.090> one<00:01:45.299> and

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
redstone torch underneath this one and

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.319 
redstone torch underneath this one and
then<00:01:46.350> just<00:01:47.070> direct<00:01:47.460> link<00:01:47.790> straight<00:01:48.119> to<00:01:48.270> the

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
then just direct link straight to the

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.630 
then just direct link straight to the
other<00:01:48.450> piston<00:01:48.840> so<00:01:49.470> you<00:01:49.530> go<00:01:49.710> redstone<00:01:50.399> torch

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
other piston so you go redstone torch

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.380 
other piston so you go redstone torch
down<00:01:50.909> direct<00:01:51.750> link<00:01:52.280> down<00:01:53.280> for<00:01:53.700> a<00:01:53.850> click<00:01:54.119> and

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
down direct link down for a click and

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.440 
down direct link down for a click and
etc<00:01:54.689> all<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.320> way<00:01:55.439> across<00:01:56.149> once<00:01:57.149> you've<00:01:57.299> got

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
etc all the way across once you've got

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.620 
etc all the way across once you've got
that<00:01:57.479> set<00:01:57.869> up<00:01:57.899> on<00:01:58.890> it'll<00:01:59.189> do<00:01:59.540> it's<00:02:00.540> a

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
that set up on it'll do it's a

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.120 
that set up on it'll do it's a
cobblestone<00:02:00.960> generator<00:02:01.110> pushes<00:02:01.890> it<00:02:02.040> out

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
cobblestone generator pushes it out

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.609 
cobblestone generator pushes it out
there<00:02:02.399> and<00:02:02.820> you'll<00:02:03.570> see<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:03.930> Pistons<00:02:04.530> are

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
there and you'll see the Pistons are

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.880 
there and you'll see the Pistons are
pushing<00:02:04.920> it<00:02:05.009> up<00:02:05.130> and<00:02:05.340> it's<00:02:05.490> building<00:02:05.790> a<00:02:05.880> wall

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
pushing it up and it's building a wall

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.529 
pushing it up and it's building a wall
so<00:02:07.890> this<00:02:08.099> block<00:02:08.369> usually<00:02:09.000> takes<00:02:09.209> a<00:02:09.330> bit<00:02:09.509> to

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
so this block usually takes a bit to

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:10.790 
so this block usually takes a bit to
fill<00:02:09.840> up<00:02:10.020> because<00:02:10.170> it's<00:02:10.379> getting<00:02:10.590> close<00:02:10.770> to

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
fill up because it's getting close to

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:11.690 
fill up because it's getting close to
the<00:02:11.069> end

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
the end

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.220 
the end
let's<00:02:11.819> fill<00:02:12.060> it<00:02:12.180> up<00:02:12.270> and<00:02:12.629> just<00:02:12.810> gets<00:02:12.989> pushed

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
let's fill it up and just gets pushed

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.280 
let's fill it up and just gets pushed
under<00:02:13.440> the<00:02:13.500> last<00:02:13.680> piston<00:02:14.069> up<00:02:14.640> it<00:02:14.819> goes<00:02:15.290> there's

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
under the last piston up it goes there's

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.309 
under the last piston up it goes there's
the<00:02:16.440> ball<00:02:16.620> getting<00:02:16.890> created<00:02:17.430> right<00:02:17.550> there

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:23.509 

sometimes<00:02:22.319> it<00:02:22.440> messes<00:02:22.590> them<00:02:22.890> it's<00:02:23.099> all<00:02:23.280> about

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
sometimes it messes them it's all about

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:25.339 
sometimes it messes them it's all about
the<00:02:23.670> timing<00:02:23.879> you<00:02:24.480> can<00:02:24.629> walk<00:02:24.750> around<00:02:25.019> of<00:02:25.200> that<00:02:25.319> a

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:25.349 
the timing you can walk around of that a

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:27.680 
the timing you can walk around of that a
bit<00:02:25.560> if<00:02:25.680> you<00:02:25.769> want<00:02:25.950> but<00:02:26.280> is<00:02:26.910> the<00:02:27.150> basic<00:02:27.540> layout

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
bit if you want but is the basic layout

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.080 
bit if you want but is the basic layout
anyway<00:02:28.230> I'll<00:02:29.190> show<00:02:29.430> you<00:02:29.489> what<00:02:29.610> happens<00:02:29.970> just

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
anyway I'll show you what happens just

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.790 
anyway I'll show you what happens just
say<00:02:30.300> someone<00:02:30.660> comes<00:02:30.840> along<00:02:30.959> minds<00:02:31.380> to<00:02:31.620> your

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
say someone comes along minds to your

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:37.550 
say someone comes along minds to your
wall<00:02:33.080> BAM<00:02:34.640> replaced<00:02:35.640> almost<00:02:36.450> instantly<00:02:37.080> the

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
wall BAM replaced almost instantly the

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.890 
wall BAM replaced almost instantly the
first<00:02:37.830> round<00:02:38.010> of<00:02:38.190> blocks<00:02:38.480> then<00:02:39.480> if<00:02:39.599> you<00:02:39.690> hit

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
first round of blocks then if you hit

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.960 
first round of blocks then if you hit
more<00:02:41.330> it'll<00:02:42.330> fill<00:02:42.599> up<00:02:42.720> eventually<00:02:43.049> but<00:02:43.970> it's

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
more it'll fill up eventually but it's

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.330 
more it'll fill up eventually but it's
pretty<00:02:45.239> good<00:02:45.450> so<00:02:45.930> I<00:02:46.260> hope<00:02:46.680> you<00:02:46.830> guys<00:02:46.860> enjoyed

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
pretty good so I hope you guys enjoyed

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.070 
pretty good so I hope you guys enjoyed
