00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 training in how the 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:07.350
 Indians are fÃ©lix agreste from Pernambuco 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.110
 helps farmers to produce a 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.120
 Rich material to help crops 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.849
 the method used to make the 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.090
 composting was presented on the 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:20.279
 Your jailson who liked the initiative 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:24.810
 I think it's a very important thing because it's 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:27.269
 we did not have the support that is 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.859
 having today understood what it is like to see 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.880
 these people to teach people do 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:35.160
 with toll 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:37.200
 is organic fertilizer and to improve 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.660
 income situation in the field or any type 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.790
 of organic material can be used 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.280
 to make composting having to 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:47.700
 respect only the 10 centimeters 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.430
 dedicated to the product rich in nitrogen and 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.140
 30 centimeters rich in carbon with 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.539
 pasture the set of techniques 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.300
 applied to stimulate decomposition 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.309
 of organic materials by organisms 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.680
 heterotrophic aerobic sus with 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.760
 purpose of obtaining in the shortest time 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.189
 possible 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.369
 stable material rich in 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:11.150
 humic and mineral nutrients with 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:14.180
 physical and chemical biological attributes 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:17.340
 above the agronomic aspect 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:19.619
 those found in the raw material 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.960
 fertilizer consists of several steps 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.830
 You have to search the woods well before 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.200
 use it 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.240
 preferably with forage harvester instead 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.250
 forage because the forage 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.310
 quite the woods and and can cause 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.630
 fermentation instead of what we want 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.790
 after this step you put a 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:40.250
 30 cm layer of this bush 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:42.869
 cut a layer of 10 centimeters 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.520
 manure of crop residue and thus 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.560
 successively until more or less one 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.149
 meter in height because it's easy 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.350
 handle that has to be mixing after 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.049
 she is done 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.640
 in this way burnings can and must 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:56.070
 be avoided 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.450
 the pound of the bush she first you go 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.310
 losing all this organic material 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.170
 You could be taking advantage of 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.869
 to use them better not only in their 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.549
 property as well as you will 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.649
 killing all the microorganisms in the 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.840
 solo ie you are still 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:12.780
 reusing the material for your own good 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.800
 to save on courses in addition to 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.290
 be burning 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.670
 A good thing you're going to be killing the 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.890
 microphone of their soil that they are 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.080
 generally beneficial to plants and 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.610
 help control even micro organisms 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.870
 that may kill the plants do not 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.690
 causes illnesses etc. 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.850
 several advantages are observed with 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.010
 practice of composting the tormentor 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:35.040
 composting both point of 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:38.730
 social view and from the point of view 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:41.610
 because he enjoys everything 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:45.750
 material you have on your property and 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:48.770
 it practically triples the organ that 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.790
 he composed to have that dung is 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:53.940
 added together with everything he has in 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.310
 property he gets no material 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.830
 of excellent colleague of Henriquez 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:00.480
 then compost and I 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.760
 I believe the pro flag 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.260
 especially hurry this transition from 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.810
 conventional agriculture for 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:09.720
 organic agriculture then composting 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:12.720
 it is fundamental, besides this positive side, 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:15.570
 farmer still saves and much to 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:17.220
 use this type of fertilizer today 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:20.430
 two thousand and five hundred reais for a 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:22.850
 chicken manure and then with the 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:25.850
 each destination can still do up to five 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:25.850
 karrada
