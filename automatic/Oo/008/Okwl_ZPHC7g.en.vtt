and are in line not that much of an

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:07.539 
and are in line not that much of an
issue<00:03:06.440> just<00:03:06.829> because<00:03:06.860> it<00:03:07.250> has<00:03:07.340> a<00:03:07.370> strong

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:07.549 
issue just because it has a strong

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:09.940 
issue just because it has a strong
volume<00:03:08.209> output<00:03:08.360> so<00:03:08.900> voices<00:03:09.290> are<00:03:09.379> audible<00:03:09.709> and

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
volume output so voices are audible and

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.699 
volume output so voices are audible and
clear<00:03:10.329> but<00:03:11.329> on<00:03:11.569> our<00:03:11.810> callers<00:03:12.200> end<00:03:12.410> there's<00:03:12.620> a

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709 
clear but on our callers end there's a

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:14.229 
clear but on our callers end there's a
little<00:03:12.950> bit<00:03:13.040> more<00:03:13.370> of<00:03:13.489> an<00:03:13.579> issue<00:03:13.760> on<00:03:14.060> their

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:14.239 
little bit more of an issue on their

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:16.420 
little bit more of an issue on their
side<00:03:14.599> we<00:03:14.959> do<00:03:15.079> appreciate<00:03:15.379> that<00:03:15.590> has<00:03:15.920> noise

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
side we do appreciate that has noise

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.129 
side we do appreciate that has noise
cancellation<00:03:17.090> technology<00:03:17.389> so<00:03:17.870> it<00:03:17.959> actually

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:18.139 
cancellation technology so it actually

00:03:18.139 --> 00:03:20.770 
cancellation technology so it actually
mutes<00:03:18.650> out<00:03:18.889> any<00:03:19.160> distracting<00:03:20.120> background

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
mutes out any distracting background

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:22.240 
mutes out any distracting background
noise<00:03:20.959> so<00:03:21.109> the<00:03:21.290> only<00:03:21.440> that's<00:03:21.709> heard<00:03:21.950> on<00:03:22.130> our

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
noise so the only that's heard on our

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.640 
noise so the only that's heard on our
callers<00:03:22.670> end<00:03:22.880> is<00:03:23.030> our<00:03:23.480> voice<00:03:23.810> but<00:03:24.170> at<00:03:24.350> the<00:03:24.470> same

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
callers end is our voice but at the same

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:27.129 
callers end is our voice but at the same
time<00:03:24.889> it<00:03:25.400> does<00:03:25.609> come<00:03:25.880> with<00:03:25.910> some<00:03:26.139> distortion

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:27.139 
time it does come with some distortion

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:28.870 
time it does come with some distortion
which<00:03:27.349> tends<00:03:27.620> to<00:03:27.769> produce<00:03:27.920> a<00:03:28.220> little<00:03:28.609> bit<00:03:28.730> of<00:03:28.819> a

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:28.880 
which tends to produce a little bit of a

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.839 
which tends to produce a little bit of a
hollowness<00:03:29.420> with<00:03:29.599> voices<00:03:30.280> however<00:03:31.280> we<00:03:31.670> gotta

hollowness with voices however we gotta

hollowness with voices however we gotta

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:18.560 
charge so a little bit below the six

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.440 
charge so a little bit below the six
hours<00:04:18.829> it's<00:04:18.979> waiting<00:04:19.220> for<00:04:19.459> but<00:04:19.609> luckily<00:04:19.849> it

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:20.450 
hours it's waiting for but luckily it

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:22.779 
hours it's waiting for but luckily it
has<00:04:20.750> a<00:04:20.780> rapid<00:04:21.440> recharging<00:04:22.039> system<00:04:22.550> so

00:04:22.779 --> 00:04:22.789 
has a rapid recharging system so

00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:25.570 
has a rapid recharging system so
basically<00:04:22.969> five<00:04:23.870> minutes<00:04:24.229> of<00:04:24.500> charging<00:04:25.159> yield

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:25.580 
basically five minutes of charging yield

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:27.850 
basically five minutes of charging yield
enough<00:04:25.849> for<00:04:26.120> one<00:04:26.330> hours<00:04:26.720> worth<00:04:26.750> of<00:04:27.169> usage<00:04:27.379> so

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:27.860 
enough for one hours worth of usage so

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:29.800 
enough for one hours worth of usage so
basically<00:04:28.340> you<00:04:28.819> can<00:04:28.970> have<00:04:29.000> it<00:04:29.270> fully<00:04:29.449> charged

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810 
basically you can have it fully charged

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:31.839 
basically you can have it fully charged
in<00:04:30.020> less<00:04:30.169> than<00:04:30.319> half<00:04:30.530> an<00:04:30.650> hour<00:04:30.800> so<00:04:31.669> the

00:04:31.839 --> 00:04:31.849 
in less than half an hour so the

00:04:31.849 --> 00:04:35.709
