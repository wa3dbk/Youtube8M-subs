00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.279
 from the outside like a two-story train 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.020
 inside to the cabin on Tversky 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.540
 Carriage Works presented 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.280
 double-deck cars with seating 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.190
 after a forced break in work 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.670
 enterprises and staff cuts on 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.400
 tvts 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.500
 This is the first large-scale presentation of workshops 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.000
 one can see the skeleton of the future car as 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.060
 explains the designers did it 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.279
 as lightweight as possible with a weight of 66 tons 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.880
 and more than five meters he should 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.289
 accelerate to 160 kilometers per hour 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.210
 lightweight material is plywood and 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.550
 lightweight furniture design juice 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.890
 run - in dvuhetazhki still be held on 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.899
 route door is bogogo but without passengers 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.719
 total federal passenger company 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.969
 ordered this year 15 wagons 5 with 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.700
 improved interior 10 with standard 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:50.010
 car capacity is 60 seats in business and 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.079
 102 in economy class their planned 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.520
 run the day express route 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.350
 Moscow Voronezh 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.449
 the train will go no more than six with 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.989
 half hours and replace the reserved seats 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:03.690
 trains but will the ticket price change 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:06.869
 approximate ticket price will be less 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:09.869
 rather than by bus 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:13.020
 ticket price ranges from 600 to 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:15.270
 800 to 1000 rubles in the plans of a daughter 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.650
 iron to render the post of similar cars 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.600
 per year they will run in 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.610
 Krasnodar region and between Moscow and 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.590
 Petersburg and so ride on 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.500
 double-decker cars will be able to Tverites 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.990
 the life of such a car is 40 years 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.930
 payback comes closer to old age 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.720
 about twenty four years will be the term 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.750
 payback of this car and we choose 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.920
 no minimum time or minimum 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.500
 payback period 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.390
 and choose a tariff that would be acceptable 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.610
 for the passenger interior space 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.829
 wagons were designed by Italian 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.079
 designers performed the idea in Russia 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:51.420
 therefore 90 percent wagons 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:53.189
 Russian so for example the effect looks 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.320
 star sky for expansion 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:57.689
 spaces there are other know-hows 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.890
 first passenger class traffic in 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.960
 car depends not only on 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.969
 numerous electronics stuffed 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.159
 here but it's individual comfort 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:07.500
 passenger for example before shipping this 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.539
 car conductor will be able to deploy all 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.560
 chairs in the direction of movement is done 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.950
 it's easy enough 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.870
 such chairs can 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.780
 tractors allows you to comfortably accommodate 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:19.650
 any passenger and face 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:23.590
 driving direction 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:26.830
 changed in the electrical part in 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:29.860
 parts of the flaws that were first 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.670
 wagons on communication and on the internet here 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.680
 this too 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:36.040
 improved we can release such 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:38.980
 wagons of the order of 100 to 120 and 150 wagons 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:41.290
 per year with a production capacity of 1200 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.660
 carriages per year even 100 two floors for 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:47.380
 the same is not enough and while the plans for 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:49.510
 2015 only order for 239 cars 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:51.840
 Marina and builders cleaned screw 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.840
