 Hi! Jakob - Unisport WebTV. 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:13.570
 As many of you have probably found out, is the new Nike Magista 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:18.100
 Like any other soccer boots - it's actually the opposite 

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.340
 of, well, obvious reasons, 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:27.310
 And today I am here to give you more insight into the technology behind Nike Magista 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:32.010
 where we start by looking at the FIT part of the boot. 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:35.510
 So if you're wondering why Nike Magista is made with a Flyknit top, 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.810
 and what this Dynamic Fit Collar is 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:42.260
 make on a football boot, then hang on! 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.310
 After a lot of feedback from their players, Nike decided 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.590
 to remove all distractions from Magista to allow the player to 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:55.200
 move more fluidly 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.900
 and to do so, the Nike Magista made as an extension of not only the foot, 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:06.110
 But actually the whole body, and therefore they introduced Dynamic Fit 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.860
 to allow Magista to sneak around not just your foot, 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.420
 But also your ankle and give you an extreme 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.790
 close feeling on the foot 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:20.160
 Like a sock, actually - and let the boot follow your smallest movement 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.540
 In the beginning, it was not Nike's intention to create a boot 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.320
 with an ankle sock, but after a lot of tests 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.890
 It dawned on them that it was the best solution 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:33.220
 and to remove all distractions 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:39.760
 Throw away the rule set and introduce the Dynamic Fit Collar - then that problem is also solved! 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.580
 Magista is also made with an upper part of Flyknit 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:49.750
 That is polyester yarn that is woven with great precision - and yes, it sounds pretty high-tech 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.750
 whichever it is! 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:57.340
 And Flyknit allows Nike to make a soft, rather stretchy upper 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:03.540
 which is thin where you need flexibility and a familiar thicker where there must be support 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:07.370
 And basically it allows the boot to really sneak around the foot like a sock 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.630
 but also to give some kind of 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.300
 support and stability that you would actually expect from one 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:19.280
 a football boot. And with Flyknit, Nike would make you forget you 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.460
 actually have something on their feet 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.060
 and therefore can say that all distractions are chilled out of the window ... 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.060
 Farveeeeeeller! 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:34.530
 Of course, there are a number of other small details when it comes to the fitting 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:39.080
 in Magista - but you have to wait a bit to hear more about it 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.910
 until we get our review. 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.480
 But until then I would like to know what you think about Magista and whether you are looking forward to it 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.510
 you to try the pussy in the boot. 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.000
 You can tell me by writing a comment in the box 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.050
 below. Because that was all I had for today - 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.780
 But we are later seen here in Unisport WebTV. 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:59.820
 I thank you! Cheerio.
