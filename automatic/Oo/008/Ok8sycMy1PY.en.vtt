00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:13.019
 so let's take a look at this 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.000
 you have to increase and accomplish foiling 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.279
 to make a gold ingot of gold 16 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.100
 ingot iron chorus of 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.990
 earth and eros two different things and 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.500
 fish and cook fish then 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.029
 first thing 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.130
 let's make the cane thing from 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.300
 peach then stack there are the 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.510
 frizzy stack coach 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:33.540
 then maybe that's what I think is mine 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.430
 memory does not deceive me and well oh my God 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:40.350
 we will be able to fish like we do at home 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:43.710
 or it would be epic indeed not because not from 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.960
 our view does not give on the sea on the stage 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.300
 maybe we can fish there or set 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:58.230
 let's try it let's try it absolutely 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:01:00.690
 come here no no not so ok with calm 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.840
 I expose myself almost to give back 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:07.860
 mob is fine we find so you're fishing 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:10.020
 what is sure does not seem you are 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:14.159
 fishing espe 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:16.740
 this is how my laziness works 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.539
 pushes you to go all the way to the sea 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.360
 the maximum for us toads ok come on 

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:23.840
 we go to telara on the beach and 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.579
 let's kill this barbarous way 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:29.030
 wait for me to eat because 

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:29.030
 is dying 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:38.009
 amm and admits that it is enough not to die 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:40.560
 don't die ok this i think is a good one 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.360
 place for pescara and then we'll have to 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.489
 get even in iron 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.959
 I think I have some iron aside 

00:01:44.489 --> 00:01:47.849
 if we or foiled everyone would really be 

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:49.079
 stupid otherwise I can go 

00:01:47.849 --> 00:01:51.780
 quietly a cave and I think that 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:54.569
 It is not difficult to find one each 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:02:00.810
 a hole in the sea or my god ok this 

00:01:54.569 --> 00:02:02.729
 recent fishing from the gods that cacchio ps 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.579
 first piece that it only takes one just us 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:07.649
 excellent tournament fish get from the iron and 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.729
 iron, iron, iron like it 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.340
 we hold 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.260
 then I think I have a little aside 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.829
 wait first let's take a look 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.889
 in black 

00:02:13.829 --> 00:02:20.400
 there's no reason to bend your head 

00:02:16.889 --> 00:02:21.900
 maybe before you broke it 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:27.209
 usually the exquisite security does not 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:28.950
 can break it down and nothing 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:31.799
 so ok then we have a small one 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.600
 likely to have iron at home but 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:35.549
 I don't want to risk making the road 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.319
 a lot of times then boarding from 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:38.549
 a new adventure full of finding of the 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:40.470
 lighthouse in this cave and parliament 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:43.400
 I will find it right away but it wo n't matter 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.400
 however an epic adventure 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:51.250
 over here it was an odyssey 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:54.069
 crazy against motorcycle too much iron 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:55.540
 also we can come back now we are all right 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:57.250
 now the next goal we give 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.709
 take a look at the big achievements 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.630
 goal will be to make gods 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:03.970
 miss then get the diamonds this 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:05.800
 it will be something a little more complicated too 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:08.769
 because stupidly I have already got ha 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:10.000
 minerals that calcium already dug 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:11.830
 I say the diamonds I found in 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.599
 surface I don't know if you remember 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:15.819
 a few episodes ago I found some 

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:17.440
 here around and I immediately climbed them I would have 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:19.989
 had to save them to do that civ 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:22.000
 ment in a short time but is sorry 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:23.829
 pinotti as you well know and therefore has it 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.319
 already done so because he felt my thread 

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:28.930
 god minerals don cavalli and therefore has it 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:32.470
 done because he has his mental problems 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:35.200
 so in any case let's say ok 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:37.360
 of saplings very interesting reads 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.890
 our little house every time we go up 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.760
 since I had the brilliant idea of 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:42.489
 make the house 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.799
 summonte go up every time is a mess 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:47.500
 crazy but luckily there are these 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:50.680
 nice shortcuts we see I can not do 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:54.010
 I know I don't think I'm carpio ok we do it 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:55.870
 the usual way or in an era c 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:58.049
 here it was the first diamond is not that 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:00.579
 there is another one but it is not me 

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:02.290
 wisely left it around and so 

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:04.030
 may but in any case I have to do first 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:05.170
 of other achievements because if it took 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.959
 the diamond would be now anyway 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:09.549
 wasted by diamant killing where you are where 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:10.590
 you're from martucci or not from anybody 

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:13.120
 part 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:14.889
 you are a genius who knows how many times I have 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.690
 made this way people I have to decide 

00:04:14.889 --> 00:04:18.100
 to complete those fucking stairs that 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.440
 lead in all directions so as to 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:22.780
 being able to access the house more 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:25.330
 more comfortable because every time you go up 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:28.510
 it is a continuous blasphemy 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:30.849
 what a joy perhaps of rays on the stairs come on 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:32.770
 show me the timi scales that there are 

00:04:30.849 --> 00:04:34.090
 beautiful ladders here not maybe we are 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:35.220
 coming back no matter must 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:40.480
 understand where they are 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:41.890
 pumpkin here tele here excellent 8 excellent that 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:44.620
 not found the stairs to climb up to 

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:47.110
 case will be child's play 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:49.510
 so we found our fish 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:53.290
 we found our hironori 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:56.050
 then we put and cook to calcium 

00:04:53.290 --> 00:05:00.370
 enough coals be the clay clay clay 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:04.150
 my god i'm full of crap then you 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:10.260
 we wait here for the gray 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:13.150
 great for nice sand bricks but who 

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:14.680
 must organize everything 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:16.150
 here with slaps I love a bit of aaron or 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:19.150
 half of the col 

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:21.280
 here we put the fish and the rest of the 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:22.840
 crona ok now in theory we should 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:24.700
 complete these two easily in a 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:27.220
 blink of an eye and then we can dedicate ourselves 

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:29.350
 looking for diamonds to continue 

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:32.650
 our climb to all the mens menswear 

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:36.610
 then recapping diamonds then me 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:37.150
 would like to dedicate myself to inter or la 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:39.550
 rock band 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:42.580
 perhaps the easiest pedro and this is 

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:44.170
 the tear of gas I think for this 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:45.610
 we should go into the never ministra a 

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:47.560
 casino permitting maybe to go there though 

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:50.170
 we already have a lighter I don't know not 

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:52.630
 I know I don't dive 

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:54.850
 it's the case with blaze so you have to go 

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:56.620
 get out some blaze local prior is 

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:58.410
 this will be a mess because I don't know 

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:01.990
 absolutely like making potions 

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:03.970
 company to go type when you go into the 

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:06.220
 land unlocks this cause i guess e 

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:08.020
 then you get dragon egg 

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:10.150
 killing the money if I'm not mistaken from 

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:12.160
 read on flash we could not eat 

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:15.520
 let's put it inside our own 

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:18.700
 beautiful in the pantry I read inside 

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:22.150
 our own that ours is good 

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:24.570
 ingotto today we have now taken off where 

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:27.400
 if we were to put them here the rowling 

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:30.550
 perfect now what remains to us 

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:33.130
 to do is to find the diamond and see if 

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:36.370
 we can continue this this 

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:37.930
 research teach us romance will not be 

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:40.180
 easy this mission because obviously 

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:41.169
 thanks to the bad luck of auctions that is so great 

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:43.150
 trust me 

00:06:41.169 --> 00:06:45.819
 first he found diamond surfaces and 

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:47.259
 now he will find absolutely no one there 

00:06:45.819 --> 00:06:49.599
 I bet what you want for ends 

00:06:47.259 --> 00:06:51.520
 because it is obvious that it will fall like this and there are 

00:06:49.599 --> 00:06:54.099
 of the interesting chocobos I could try 

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:55.930
 to convert them to my darkest cause e 

00:06:54.099 --> 00:06:58.719
 fights my ears with my religion 

00:06:55.930 --> 00:07:01.020
 ism if you want you can also participate 

00:06:58.719 --> 00:07:03.639
 you the regions have to do other than 

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:04.990
 say it in the comments 

00:07:03.639 --> 00:07:06.310
 nothing because it's not that we have st 

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:08.860
 great organization because we have it 

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:11.020
