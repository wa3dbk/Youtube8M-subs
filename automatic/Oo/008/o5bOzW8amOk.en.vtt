00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:06.090

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.120
 you entertained 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:28.620
 but the actual fun is only created 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.300
 in a cooperative game 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:32.010

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:35.970
 you should revive the times 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.440
 undead to head this year arsenal 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.180
 comes completely from the second 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.290
 world war as the primary waffle world here 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.550
 a sniper rifle 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.200
 as the customer was for one 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:45.090
 submachine gun or a shotgun 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.280
 and to support one 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.020
 handgun for the necessary boom 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.479
 care style grenades 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.580
 stumbling blocks and dynamite bundles like 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.979
 also the mission is strong the gameplay 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.840
 repetitive with the sniper rifle cleared 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.090
 The zombies rise up at a distance 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.620
 close packed the secondary weapon and 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.799
 should be a big pile on one 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:06.540
 stain stand pacted explosives is 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:08.369
 the only alternative is the mode 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.780
 horde whereby the only difference is 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.640
 that she stays here in one place 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.650
 multiply 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.600
 against waves of nazis to defend us 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.430
 on the part of the presentation , there are only 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.959
 Little to complain the game on permanently 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.970
 liquid the smoke and light effects 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:21.709
 work naturally and take care of 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.420
 mood in playing with this 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:25.580
 Scenario usually moves 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.530
 color palette mostly in shades of gray and leaves 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.090
 only a little variation to you want 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.680
 complete that fell in the then 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.209
 time you can dive the 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.950
 Activate week show mode 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:36.640
 then the game presents itself 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.840
 completely in black and white 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.760
 There are three in the campaign 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.830
 episodes with five chapters each 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.209
 a chapter will take about one 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:46.250
 hour depending on which 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:47.090
 Difficulty you play sometimes 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.800
 a little longer 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.500
 In addition, you have the Horde mode 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.450
 With five cards available everything can 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.519
 be played online in co- op mode 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.560
 For this you can play other players 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:58.850
 join themselves to open a lobby 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.800
 or play with friends 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:03.080
 the only progress in the game itself 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:05.239
 you only see in a statistic and on 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:07.160
 bestlists award receive the 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:08.269
 only in the form of professionals in this way 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.370
 play it too 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:11.870
 otherwise there is no real goal 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.130
 for you except the certainty 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.420
 chapter ended 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:16.760
 you can not unlock weapons 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:18.739
 no alternative costumes for the eight 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.660
 gain playable characters and also 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:22.340
 otherwise the game offers no incentive 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:23.989
 to play a certain level or 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.730
 to achieve something special 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:26.930
 It would be a shame, after all 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:28.850
 The weapons have been light 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:30.739
 to make modifiable or some 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:33.140
 to make weapons available later 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:34.730
 so you end up with only one 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:40.450
 big playground of zombies on the 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:43.670
 you can let off steam the billing 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:46.130
 pretty if still dull optic stable 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:48.380
 online connection on the level of the page 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:51.049
 a proper amount none 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:53.690
 playable progress little alternate 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:55.400
 for friends happy zombie slaughter 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:56.329
 Zombie Army Trilogy offers a time 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.920
 long entertainment 

00:03:56.329 --> 00:03:59.269
 you should be on a story and 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:00.470
 You will become a diversified house 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:02.329
 However, be disappointed 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:04.100
 is it just a matter of a few nazis 

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:07.269
 to miss a headshot comes here 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:07.269
 certainly cost on euro
