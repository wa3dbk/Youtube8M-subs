00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
feel the most up to date is under the

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
feel the most up to date is under the
hood<00:02:31.180> on<00:02:32.180> the<00:02:32.300> practical<00:02:32.720> front<00:02:32.959> the<00:02:33.140> biggest

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
hood on the practical front the biggest

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.290 
hood on the practical front the biggest
change<00:02:33.950> and<00:02:34.190> the<00:02:34.250> thing<00:02:34.430> I<00:02:34.520> like<00:02:34.700> the<00:02:34.730> most<00:02:34.880> is

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300 
change and the thing I like the most is

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.270 
change and the thing I like the most is
the<00:02:35.420> motor<00:02:35.750> it's<00:02:36.200> a<00:02:36.260> nice<00:02:36.440> common<00:02:36.890> rail<00:02:37.069> motor

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
the motor it's a nice common rail motor

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.759 
the motor it's a nice common rail motor
so<00:02:37.910> are<00:02:38.000> lots<00:02:38.239> of<00:02:38.360> grunt<00:02:38.630> it's<00:02:38.959> smooth<00:02:39.230> so<00:02:39.680> it

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:39.769 
so are lots of grunt it's smooth so it

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:42.100 
so are lots of grunt it's smooth so it
just<00:02:39.980> feels<00:02:40.160> easier<00:02:41.060> to<00:02:41.180> work<00:02:41.360> on<00:02:41.750> a<00:02:41.810> daily

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:34.190 

but<00:03:32.819> then<00:03:32.969> when<00:03:33.150> talking<00:03:33.480> about<00:03:33.629> current<00:03:34.049> babe

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
but then when talking about current babe

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.479 
but then when talking about current babe
I<00:03:34.819> mean<00:03:35.819> on<00:03:36.269> the<00:03:36.420> inside<00:03:36.450> this<00:03:37.200> is<00:03:37.439> very<00:03:38.159> basic

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
I mean on the inside this is very basic

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:40.580 
I mean on the inside this is very basic
you<00:03:39.209> do<00:03:39.329> get<00:03:39.480> locks<00:03:39.719> on<00:03:39.870> the<00:03:39.959> doors<00:03:40.200> of<00:03:40.409> course

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
you do get locks on the doors of course

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.679 
you do get locks on the doors of course
and<00:03:41.370> that's<00:03:41.459> of<00:03:41.670> little<00:03:41.909> use<00:03:42.060> without<00:03:42.209> a<00:03:42.390> roof

00:03:42.679 --> 00:03:42.689 
and that's of little use without a roof

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:45.589 
and that's of little use without a roof
and<00:03:43.370> of<00:03:44.370> course<00:03:44.640> if<00:03:44.849> you<00:03:44.969> don't<00:03:45.090> have<00:03:45.329> a<00:03:45.359> roof

00:03:45.589 --> 00:03:45.599 
and of course if you don't have a roof

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:47.360 
and of course if you don't have a roof
you<00:03:45.810> get<00:03:46.079> what<00:03:46.500> I<00:03:46.530> am<00:03:46.650> getting<00:03:46.769> here<00:03:46.950> which<00:03:47.219> is
