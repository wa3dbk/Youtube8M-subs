connected

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.920 

and<00:02:11.340> let's<00:02:12.340> see<00:02:12.610> if<00:02:12.640> we<00:02:12.850> have<00:02:13.150> any<00:02:13.420> active

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
and let's see if we have any active

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.640 
and let's see if we have any active
users<00:02:15.090> so<00:02:16.090> let's<00:02:16.750> go<00:02:16.990> ahead<00:02:17.110> and<00:02:17.500> do<00:02:17.620> a

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
users so let's go ahead and do a

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:29.340 
users so let's go ahead and do a
connection<00:02:18.220> test<00:02:27.330> when<00:02:28.330> this<00:02:28.570> worked<00:02:28.930> for<00:02:29.200> me

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.350 
connection test when this worked for me

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:34.980 
connection test when this worked for me
I<00:02:29.620> tried<00:02:30.010> it<00:02:30.130> about<00:02:31.980> twice<00:02:33.300> so<00:02:34.300> there's<00:02:34.900> a

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:34.990 
I tried it about twice so there's a

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:43.250 
I tried it about twice so there's a
little<00:02:35.320> indicator<00:02:35.800> pops<00:02:36.160> up<00:02:36.459> the<00:02:36.670> sound<00:02:42.180> and

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
little indicator pops up the sound and

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:48.300 
little indicator pops up the sound and
this<00:02:44.260> actually<00:02:44.920> failed<00:02:45.459> for<00:02:46.150> me<00:02:46.350> but<00:02:47.350> I<00:02:47.830> went

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
this actually failed for me but I went

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.750
