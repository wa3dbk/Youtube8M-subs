00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:05.850
 hello all I'm that I draw miles 

00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:05.850
 about wigs 

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:13.389
 perhaps our suitcases that are used to 

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:18.130
 the hair was for example to make up 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:19.750
 ok with the wigs and I really do not 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:22.210
 the floor use a lot 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.710
 These are somewhat more resistant and are usually 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:27.220
 sell them the Chinese to me personally 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:30.599
 I do not like them very much they seem very thin 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:32.800
 but still I will teach you how to put 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.629
 personally, the ones I like the most are 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.800
 which I always use because 

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:37.800
 They are quite resistant 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:53.500
 to put on a wig in need of a 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:56.020
 coletero has picked up a song 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:59.560
 some hairpins and if I want I do not 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:01.040
 use it because it not only reduces repressive 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:03.890
 action but good 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:07.030
 basically a person collect 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.030
 what is the taste 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.890
 once we have hope, more or less 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.409
 picked up we take the little hand and then the 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.380
 we put in our head from behind 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:31.020
 forward and then we collect 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.409
 all the remaining hair so that it is not 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.409
 nothing 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:29.280
 place the long lord I wear it 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.500
 directly with pigtail 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.819
 so that it is not read in all the hair the 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:37.069
 It's true that I seem to be trying 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:37.069
 very bad to give an account 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:42.880
 a wig has put it on my back 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.880
 for me it is the easiest way to teach 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:48.240
 how to put it 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:51.540
 in front once placed directly 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:53.230
 is combed and the truth is that what has 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.300
 been pretty 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:58.950
 destroyed has to fix several 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:03.900
 times but that's why it's so bad to see 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.900
 but good in the end is pretty good 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:49.120
 once we have the wig we put the 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:53.110
 accessories that we want to our look and 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:55.680
 we combed the rope 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:57.989
 or if 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:00.900
 if you want to condemn never the best 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:04.330
 AK rifle or some kind of special faithful 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:07.440
 for wigs 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:07.440
 I the truth 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:28.630
 the glasses 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:44.630
 and well we have the wig on 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.729
 two 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:55.910
 that part of the video I'm going to teach 

00:04:52.980 --> 00:05:00.000
 practically the same thing but with magic 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:02.760
 good i do not usually use it but never 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.040
 well there most people in the 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:08.150
 mesh that they have so good I do not know 

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:08.150
 loses nothing to teach it 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:22.320
 he does not just use it but he had to rotate the 

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:24.389
 true that the only one I have and the 

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:26.789
 truth is that I do not like anything but 

00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:29.150
 nothing like picks up that I did not even 

00:05:26.789 --> 00:05:29.150
 I have collected 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:45.620
 here I have put it places it in front 

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:49.250
 and I recommend putting it ahead 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:52.249
 but well I like it more from behind 

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:54.319
 we have to adjust 

00:05:52.249 --> 00:05:56.539
 the little things to bring me more I do not know how 

00:05:54.319 --> 00:05:58.519
 call now the truth but good 

00:05:56.539 --> 00:06:02.529
 find a video about that explaining more 

00:05:58.519 --> 00:06:02.529
 or less the part of the wig 

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:12.330
 and it is already 

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:15.790
 if you liked the video I would try it 

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:19.180
 to subscribe if you have any 

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:22.259
 petition to live future 

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:22.259
 unless to see 

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:27.810
 I have many ideas, I really know who 

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:30.840
 he is interested but well I will try to continue 

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:33.260
 Uploading videos when you can and from the 

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:33.260
