00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.630 
my opinions let me tell you my personal
point<00:00:25.019> of<00:00:25.289> view<00:00:25.350> on<00:00:25.769> the<00:00:25.890> Batgirl

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
point of view on the Batgirl

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.259 
point of view on the Batgirl
I<00:00:26.670> think<00:00:27.570> Batgirl<00:00:28.320> is<00:00:28.619> huge<00:00:29.189> by<00:00:29.460> this<00:00:29.670> point<00:00:30.000> I

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
I think Batgirl is huge by this point I

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.049 
I think Batgirl is huge by this point I
think<00:00:30.660> she's<00:00:31.380> probably<00:00:31.679> an<00:00:31.920> a-list<00:00:32.489> character

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
think she's probably an a-list character

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.090 
think she's probably an a-list character
by<00:00:33.210> now<00:00:33.420> Barbara<00:00:34.020> Gordon<00:00:34.320> was<00:00:34.469> obviously<00:00:34.860> the

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
by now Barbara Gordon was obviously the

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.520 
by now Barbara Gordon was obviously the
second<00:00:35.610> Batgirl<00:00:36.120> but<00:00:36.570> she<00:00:36.870> is<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.110> Batgirl

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
second Batgirl but she is the Batgirl

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.229 
second Batgirl but she is the Batgirl
most<00:00:37.829> people<00:00:38.160> think<00:00:38.370> of<00:00:38.610> when<00:00:39.000> they<00:00:39.030> hear

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
most people think of when they hear

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.049 
most people think of when they hear
Batgirl<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.649> first<00:00:40.890> Batgirl<00:00:41.160> series<00:00:41.760> was

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
Batgirl the first Batgirl series was

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.600 
Batgirl the first Batgirl series was
released<00:00:42.420> in<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.719> year<00:00:43.070> 2000<00:00:44.070> and<00:00:44.280> it

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
released in the year 2000 and it

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.360 
released in the year 2000 and it
followed<00:00:45.030> Cassandra<00:00:45.719> Cain<00:00:45.989> not<00:00:46.739> Barbara

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
followed Cassandra Cain not Barbara

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:48.170 
followed Cassandra Cain not Barbara
Gordon

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
Gordon

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.029 
Gordon
so<00:00:48.360> if<00:00:48.480> Barbara<00:00:48.809> never<00:00:48.989> had<00:00:49.200> her<00:00:49.320> own<00:00:49.500> Batgirl

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
so if Barbara never had her own Batgirl

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.200 
so if Barbara never had her own Batgirl
series<00:00:50.520> why<00:00:51.149> is<00:00:51.480> she<00:00:51.870> so<00:00:52.199> iconic<00:00:52.829> why<00:00:53.520> is<00:00:53.879> she

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
series why is she so iconic why is she

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.439 
series why is she so iconic why is she
so<00:00:54.649> huge<00:00:55.649> I<00:00:56.190> think<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.760> time<00:00:57.030> that<00:00:57.210> she<00:00:57.360> was

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
so huge I think the time that she was

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.689 
so huge I think the time that she was
made<00:00:57.719> has<00:00:58.050> a<00:00:58.079> lot<00:00:58.379> to<00:00:58.530> do<00:00:58.680> with<00:00:58.800> it<00:00:59.039> she<00:00:59.250> was

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
made has a lot to do with it she was

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.060 
made has a lot to do with it she was
made<00:00:59.850> in<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.120> 60s<00:01:00.660> and<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.079> 60s<00:01:01.620> through<00:01:01.829> to

loved the one thing that surprised me is

00:02:39.219 --> 00:02:41.429 
loved the one thing that surprised me is
that<00:02:39.310> I<00:02:39.669> like<00:02:39.879> the<00:02:40.150> leather<00:02:40.389> jacket<00:02:40.900> a<00:02:40.989> lot<00:02:41.200> and

00:02:41.429 --> 00:02:41.439 
that I like the leather jacket a lot and

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:44.339 
that I like the leather jacket a lot and
usually<00:02:41.829> I<00:02:42.040> don't<00:02:42.700> like<00:02:42.879> leather<00:02:43.540> on<00:02:43.810> heroes

00:02:44.339 --> 00:02:44.349 
usually I don't like leather on heroes

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:47.309 
usually I don't like leather on heroes
like<00:02:44.859> I<00:02:45.010> hate<00:02:45.489> it<00:02:45.790> when<00:02:46.180> a<00:02:46.239> writer<00:02:46.569> puts<00:02:47.109> the

00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:47.319 
like I hate it when a writer puts the

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:50.459 
like I hate it when a writer puts the
x-men<00:02:47.919> in<00:02:48.159> leather<00:02:48.760> I<00:02:49.180> think<00:02:49.629> it<00:02:49.750> was<00:02:49.930> Cyclops

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:50.469 
x-men in leather I think it was Cyclops

00:02:50.469 --> 00:02:52.800 
x-men in leather I think it was Cyclops
at<00:02:50.739> one<00:02:50.889> point<00:02:51.159> that<00:02:51.340> said<00:02:51.639> well<00:02:52.329> you<00:02:52.540> know<00:02:52.659> we

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
at one point that said well you know we

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:54.809 
at one point that said well you know we
already<00:02:52.959> have<00:02:53.319> superpowers<00:02:53.769> so<00:02:54.340> the<00:02:54.669> leather

00:02:54.809 --> 00:02:54.819 
already have superpowers so the leather

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:57.179 
already have superpowers so the leather
was<00:02:55.090> just<00:02:55.299> making<00:02:55.599> people<00:02:55.719> even<00:02:56.199> more<00:02:56.590> nervous

00:02:57.179 --> 00:02:57.189 
was just making people even more nervous

00:02:57.189 --> 00:02:59.280 
was just making people even more nervous
I<00:02:57.430> think<00:02:58.000> the<00:02:58.090> leather<00:02:58.299> works<00:02:58.629> because<00:02:59.139> of<00:02:59.169> the

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
I think the leather works because of the

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.740 
I think the leather works because of the
new<00:02:59.530> attitude<00:03:00.219> batgirls<00:03:00.730> gonna<00:03:00.969> have<00:03:01.239> she's

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
new attitude batgirls gonna have she's

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.390 
new attitude batgirls gonna have she's
gonna<00:03:01.870> have<00:03:02.169> this<00:03:02.319> essence<00:03:02.919> of<00:03:03.129> joy<00:03:03.370> that

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
gonna have this essence of joy that

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.699 
gonna have this essence of joy that
really<00:03:03.879> hasn't<00:03:04.150> been<00:03:04.359> there<00:03:04.750> in<00:03:04.780> her<00:03:05.139> run<00:03:05.349> so

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
really hasn't been there in her run so

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:08.789 
really hasn't been there in her run so
far<00:03:06.069> which<00:03:06.669> allows<00:03:07.150> the<00:03:07.480> leather<00:03:07.750> to<00:03:08.079> work<00:03:08.319> I

00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:08.799 
far which allows the leather to work I

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:10.920 
far which allows the leather to work I
really<00:03:09.310> do<00:03:09.519> have<00:03:09.730> high<00:03:10.030> hopes<00:03:10.299> for<00:03:10.510> this<00:03:10.750> new

really do have high hopes for this new
run<00:03:11.109> on<00:03:11.260> Batgirl<00:03:11.709> it<00:03:12.129> could<00:03:12.370> possibly<00:03:12.519> be<00:03:12.849> the

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
run on Batgirl it could possibly be the

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.199 
run on Batgirl it could possibly be the
best<00:03:13.449> run<00:03:13.750> on<00:03:13.989> Batgirl<00:03:14.500> since<00:03:15.209> Stephanie

Barbara<00:03:31.810> has<00:03:32.109> to<00:03:32.409> love<00:03:32.650> what<00:03:33.009> she's<00:03:33.310> doing<00:03:33.819> she

00:03:34.499 --> 00:03:34.509 
Barbara has to love what she's doing she

00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:36.509 
Barbara has to love what she's doing she
chose<00:03:35.049> to<00:03:35.409> become<00:03:35.560> a<00:03:35.769> hero

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:36.519 
chose to become a hero

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:39.089 
chose to become a hero
and<00:03:36.729> when<00:03:36.879> people<00:03:37.120> told<00:03:37.599> her<00:03:37.810> no<00:03:38.109> she<00:03:38.439> just

00:03:39.089 --> 00:03:39.099 
and when people told her no she just

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:40.020 
and when people told her no she just
kept<00:03:39.430> going

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
kept going

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:42.899 
kept going
so<00:03:40.509> obviously<00:03:41.019> she<00:03:41.470> loves<00:03:41.829> what<00:03:42.129> she's<00:03:42.430> doing

00:03:42.899 --> 00:03:42.909 
so obviously she loves what she's doing

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:45.179 
so obviously she loves what she's doing
so<00:03:43.120> there<00:03:43.569> has<00:03:43.810> to<00:03:43.840> be<00:03:44.109> that<00:03:44.409> essence<00:03:44.949> of<00:03:45.159> joy

so there has to be that essence of joy

00:03:45.189 --> 00:03:47.939 
so there has to be that essence of joy
all<00:03:45.939> in<00:03:46.120> all<00:03:46.269> I<00:03:46.449> like<00:03:46.689> the<00:03:46.810> new<00:03:46.930> costume<00:03:47.470> I<00:03:47.680> like

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
series might be DC's answer to Marvel's

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:57.179 
series might be DC's answer to Marvel's
