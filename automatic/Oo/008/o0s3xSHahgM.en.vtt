 youtube a greeting I'm conical and today as 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.250
 You see I bring you the first a boxing of 5 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.340

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.689
 of you alone if you see well my 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.739
 videos you saw that a few days ago 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:30.149
 I did a boxing as a mini preview of 

00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:32.399
 four album envelopes that came from 

00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:34.380
 gift with the magazine but today 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.430
 I'll start what would be a boxing 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:40.970
 proper of the envelopes 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:44.060
 here you see that by the way the design 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:46.390
 is the same does not change does not change anything 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:46.390
 one to another 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.489
 usually it's usually that way 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.100
 for the world's collections of 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.829
 Euro and other football only 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.559
 what changes forgiveness only what 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.329
 change is the color of the edge of the 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.450
 envelopes in some countries of is of 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.420
 different color 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:08.840
 but what would come to be the design 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:11.420
 let's say the cover of the envelope is the same 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:15.549
 around the world 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.549
