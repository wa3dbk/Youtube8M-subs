00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:12.210
 it is precisely this medium so I 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.059
 today I come with a video that 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.859
 going to talk acne again so I 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.960
 look on this topic actually because 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.840
 during the month of january february I 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:25.470
 had a new skin problems and 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.390
 especially acne actually it's because 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.420
 of a misstep that I used and which 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:34.290
 did not suit me at all 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:37.920
 toddlers and a lot of problems of 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:40.739
 dryness the button that more stress 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.800
 exam stress of my internship 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:48.000
 as part of my studies the cold of 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:52.160
 winter has made my skin 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.210
 catastrophic during this period 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.940
 so suddenly I'm directly 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.140
 go back to my dermatologist to see 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.030
 I did not want it to get worse 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.160
 even if it did not really 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.320
 to worsen in the nose use pub 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.129
 foundation but in case I 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.799
 preferred to go see a dermatologist 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.390
 Besides, that's what I give you 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.580
 as first advice is to go see 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:16.549
 a dermatologist anne a dermatologist 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.549
 then will give you the drug care 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:22.710
 adequate cream 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:24.270
 so I had two way so me 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.130
 again taken what is is achievable 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.549
 I had a lot of questions about 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.079
 to this antibiotic so it has not hurt 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.990
 of you actually ask me if I 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.490
 included capsules a day 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.850
 yes me it is the prescription that 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.299
 I had 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:41.159
 now it's true that in the record 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.659
 it is stated that for adults 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.479
 can take capsules each day where 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:47.689
 it is stated that for Guinea it is 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:50.850
 one capsule a day for three months 

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:53.640
 manas it may well depend on the type 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.850
 of acne the age of the person of your 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.460
 age to you and 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:01.070
 I do not know what type of acne and the age of 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.650
 the thin person teen throw it's 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:06.770
 logical kate as your 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:08.509
 dermatologist prescribes a dose 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.489
 less than what I'm going to 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:13.630
 take 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:17.709
 so then my dermatologist told me 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:21.110
 given a lotion she herself 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:24.170
 she who noted the formula and this is the 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.400
 pharmacist who made the lotion so 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.600
 to know that we help you because 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.000
 that I do not know if they do not have 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:31.720
 name in fact but a big one it's just a 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.519
 motion that serves to clean my skin is 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.319
 went toey correctly all the buttons 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:38.390
 before applying the cream 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:40.730
 so if you have a cleansing care 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.900
 you can use that the main 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:45.140
 it is that the skin is clean 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:48.200
 before applying the cream then the 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:53.180
 cream that I had to use these benza 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:55.010
 that in 5% gel so that's a cream 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.930
 it's a little bit about the video 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:00.560
 previous is a little in style 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:03.140
 adrian et al but sincerely if i have 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.390
 make a comparison because I have 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:06.680
 reuse tianian at the beginning before going 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:09.200
 see my dermatologist 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.900
 but it is true that it is false but 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:14.180
 between you the world there are traces 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:16.370
 and scars somehow more 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:18.010
 far from the redness after the disappearance 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.900
 of the button 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.910
 it is true that with Algerian cabinet is not 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.019
 also not on all the buttons on 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:26.570
 some 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:27.079
 on the other hand with balzac I did not have this 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:31.540
 problem 

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:34.970
 so if you used jay z and that 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:36.500
 it did not have any positive results on 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:41.380
 you find that it is not enough 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:44.829
 strong maybe go get dany zac 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:49.730
 so it's also in the pharmacy 

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:52.220
 it is without a medical prescription and 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:54.710
 I think the price must be more or 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:57.800
 less in the same as axial sorting 

00:03:54.710 --> 00:04:00.650
 of these between 12 and 14 euros some 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:01.420
 something something for the 6 for 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:09.350
 application 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:11.030
 so it's a cream like that here it is 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:12.950
 so in fact we have to put some 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:16.850
 dinner only after having 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:18.770
 studied the skin is in very thin layers 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:20.590
 and this only on the buttons that it 

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:23.030
 was a bit like triac nehal but 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:25.180
 awesome actually you had to put some 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:27.620
 really pretty much of course every button 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.900
 here in fact you just have to put one 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:32.120
 very thin layer 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:35.480
 I think after two or three 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:38.030
 applications or two or three days the 

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:40.040
 turning knob really to shrink and 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:42.200
 to disappear but completely so 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:48.020
 line leaves no scar no 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:49.460
 redness yeah so I do not know if 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:51.410
 you have other questions anyway 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:55.520
 than ask them in this video in the 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:57.830
 previous video about on acne or so 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:59.570

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:01.280

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:04.190

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:34.940
 redness and also how 

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:36.650
 get rid completely since actually 

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:39.620
 you have to do vascular laser and 

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:42.370
